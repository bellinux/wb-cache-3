50|$|Worldwide {{consumption}} of <b>phenadoxone</b> has actually increased slightly {{in recent years}} {{according to a recent}} report from the World Health Organisation. Like its drug subcategory prototype methadone, <b>phenadoxone</b> can be used as the opioid analgesic in Brompton Mixture, aka Brompton cocktail. <b>Phenadoxone</b> is most used at the current time in Denmark and various countries in eastern Europe.|$|E
50|$|Keto: <b>phenadoxone,</b> methadone, dipipanone, etc.|$|E
50|$|The {{synthesis}} is {{the same}} as for <b>phenadoxone,</b> with the exception that piperidine is used in lieu of morpholine.|$|E
50|$|<b>Phenadoxone</b> is {{generally}} considered to be a strong opioid analgesic and is regulated {{in much the same way}} as morphine where it is used. The usual starting dose is 10-20 mg and it has a duration of analgesic effect of 1 to 4 hours. By comparison, methadone has an analgesic effect lasting from 3 to 6 hours although for use in opioid maintenance the dose is different from that used for analgesia and the sought effect of suppressing withdrawal symptoms for 24-48 hours but after a small time euphoria disapear and block euphoria from praticaly all other opioids.. <b>Phenadoxone</b> is not used at this time for purptoses other than pain relief.|$|E
50|$|Chemically, {{dipipanone}} {{belongs to}} the class of opioids called the 4,4-diphenylheptane-3-ones. It closely resembles methadone, the only structural difference being the N,N-dimethyl moiety of methadone being replaced with a piperidine ring. Other related compounds with equivalent activity where the piperidine ring {{has been replaced by}} other groups, include the morpholine derivative <b>phenadoxone,</b> as well as the corresponding pyrrolidine derivative.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Phenadoxone</b> has a US DEA ACSCN of 9637 and {{recently}} {{has had a}} zero annual manufacturing quota under the Controlled Substances Act 1970 [...] Its withdrawal from US distribution prior to the promulgation of said act is {{a large part of}} its Schedule I designation; it is, however, used as a legitimate medication in other countries and consumption is increasing worldwide as indicated below.|$|E
50|$|<b>Phenadoxone</b> (Heptalgin, Morphidone, Heptazone) is an opioid {{analgesic}} {{of the open}} chain class (methadone and relatives) invented in Germany by Hoechst in 1947. It {{is one of a}} handful of useful synthetic analgesics which were used in the United States for various lengths of time in the 20 or so years after the end of the Second World War but which were withdrawn from the market for various or no known reason and which now are mostly in Schedule I of the United States' Controlled Substances Act of 1970, or (like phenazocine and bezitramide) in Schedule II but not produced or marketed in the US. Others on this list are ketobemidone (Ketogin), dextromoramide (Dimorlin, Palfium and others), phenazocine (Narphen and Prinadol), dipipanone (Diconal, Pipadone and Wellconal), piminodine (Alvodine), propiram (Algeril), anileridine (Leritine) and alphaprodine (Nisentil).|$|E
5000|$|The {{interaction}} of carisoprodol with essentially all opioids, and other centrally acting analgesics, but especially [...] {{those of the}} codeine-derived subgroup of the semisynthetic class (codeine, ethylmorphine, dihydrocodeine, hydrocodone, oxycodone, nicocodeine, benzylmorphine, the various acetylated codeine derivatives including acetyldihydrocodeine, dihydroisocodeine, nicodicodeine and others) [...] which allows {{the use of a}} smaller dose of the opioid to have a given effect , is useful in general and especially where skeletal muscle injury and/or spasm is {{a large part of the}} problem. The potentiation effect is also useful in other pain situations and is also especially useful with opioids of the open-chain class, such as methadone, levomethadone, ketobemidone, <b>phenadoxone</b> and others. In recreational drug users, deaths have resulted from carelessly combining overdoses of hydrocodone and carisoprodol. Another danger of misuse of carisoprodol and opiates is the potential to aspirate while unconscious.|$|E
40|$|In the rat, {{the ratio}} of the {{analgesic}} to the respiratory depressant potency was the same for morphine, codeine, diamorphine, methadone, dipipanone, piperidylisomethadone, <b>phenadoxone,</b> dextromoramide, and propoxyphene. The relative respiratory depressant activity of pethidine tended to be less, but the difference was not significant. The ratio of the analgesic dose to the dose preventing transport of a charcoal meal in the rat was about the same for morphine, codeine, pethidine, methadone, <b>phenadoxone,</b> dimethylthiambutene, and propoxyphene; the relative activities of these compounds in inhibiting the peristaltic reflex of the isolated guinea-pig ileum were also similar. However, because of differences in the slopes of regression lines in the charcoal meal test, some compounds (for example, morphine) had a greater effect on gastrointestinal propulsion than others (for example, pethidine) when given at moderate analgesic dose levels...|$|E
40|$|Morphine {{depresses}} the twitch and tetanus of stimulated guinea-pig ileum {{by reducing}} acetylcholine released from cholinergic nerve endings. Acetylcholine output per shock falls to {{roughly the same}} residual amount at varying stimulation rates. Since normal output per shock declines with increasing stimulus frequency, the proportionate effect of morphine diminishes as stimulus frequency rises. Acute “tolerance” to morphine and a state of “morphinedependence” can be produced. <b>Phenadoxone,</b> dihydromorphinone, metopon, methadone, and heroin are more active, codeine and pethidine less active, than morphine. Nalorphine also depresses the twitch and can desensitize the gut both to itself and to morphine...|$|E
