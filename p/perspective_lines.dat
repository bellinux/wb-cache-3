In like manner, the aiguilles of Chamouni, which present {{themselves}} to the traveller, as he looks up to them from the village, under an outline approximating to that rudely indicated at C in the next figure, are in reality buttresses projecting from an intermediate ridge. Let A be {{supposed to be a}} castle wall, with slightly elevated masses of square-built buttresses at intervals. Then, by a process of dilapidation, these buttresses might easily be brought to assume in their perspective of ruin the forms indicated at B, which, with certain modifications, is the actual shape of the Chamouni aiguilles. The top of the Aiguille Charmoz is not the point under d, but that under e. The deception is much increased by the elevation of the whole castle wall on the green bank before spoken of, which raises its foundation several thousand feet above the eye, and thus, giving amazing steepness to all the <b>perspective</b> <b>lines,</b> produces an impression of the utmost possible isolation of peaks, where, in reality, there is a well-supported, and more or less continuous, though sharply jagged, pile of solid walls.|$|E
60|$|There {{was nobody}} to receive them but Richards, for the {{servants}} {{had been paid}} off, and only a keeper {{and his wife were}} living in the kitchen in charge. There was a fire in the library, where the Colonel had business to transact with Richards, while the ladies and children proceeded with their explorations. It was rather awful at first in the twilight gloom of the great hall, with a painted mythological ceiling, and cold white pavement, varied by long <b>perspective</b> <b>lines</b> of black lozenges, on which every footfall echoed. The first door that they opened led into a vast and dreary dining- room, with a carpet, forming a crimson roll at one end, and long ranks of faded leathern chairs sitting in each other's laps. At one end hung a huge picture by Snyders, of a bear hugging one dog in his forepaws and tearing open the ribs of another with his hind ones. Opposite was a wild boar impaling a hound with his tusk, and the other walls were occupied by Herodias smiling at the contents of her charger, Judith dropping the gory head into her bag, a brown St. Sebastian writhing among the arrows; and Juno extracting the painfully flesh and blood eyes of Argus to set them in her peacock's tail.|$|E

50|$|According to the {{reconstruction}} Masaccio started by producing a rough {{drawing of the}} composition and <b>perspective</b> <b>lines</b> on the wall. The drawing was covered with fresh plaster for making the fresco. To ensure the precise transfer of the <b>perspective</b> <b>lines</b> from the sketch to the plaster, Masaccio inserted a nail in at the vanishing point under {{the base of the}} cross and attached strings to it, which he pressed in (or carved into) the plaster.

Two strategies based on <b>perspective</b> <b>line</b> detec-tion are presented: an image-based approach and a position-based approach for visual servoing. Both are fully described including stability analysis and experimental results on real robots,discussing limitations and benefits of each approach supporting the experimental results with theoretical con-cepts. Next, it is proposed a switching approach {{in order to obtain}} a new controller with better performance when compared with both previous controllers acting alone. The stability at switching times is proved by considering Multi-ple Lyapunov Functions. I...|$|R

Using the staircase method, 40 participants adjusted the sizes of blank cards presented in the upper visual field to the size of playing cards presented in the lower visual field. During the presentation of the stimuli, pictorial depth cues were displayed in the computer screen and participants were asked to typify the strategy used to judge the perceived sizes. The horizon and the <b>perspective</b> <b>line</b> gradient contributed to the overestimation of the perceived size of blank cards in about 8 and 12 %, respectively, and size comparisons were coherent with the constancy of size...|$|R
50|$|Some of her painted around 1932-33 were {{reflected}} the common interests {{of those of}} other contemporary painters. These paintings show objects being broken down into forms based on their colours similar to Cézanne, and have a cubist manipulation {{of some of the}} imagery. Her House With Trees, 1935, shows houses in pink, with unnatural blues for some of the bushes surrounding them. A distortion of the realist colours is apparent, with distortion also of the <b>perspective</b> <b>lines</b> of the actual house.|$|E
5000|$|In {{cinematography}} {{and photography}} panning means swiveling a still or video camera horizontally from a fixed position.This motion {{is similar to}} the motion of a person when they turn their head on their neck from left to right. In the resulting image, the view seems to [...] "pass by" [...] the spectator as new material appears {{on one side of the}} screen and exits from the other, although <b>perspective</b> <b>lines</b> reveal that the entire image is seen from a fixed point of view.|$|E
5000|$|A line {{of force}} in Faraday's {{extended}} sense is synonymous with Maxwell's line of induction. According to J.J. Thomson, Faraday usually discusses lines of force as chains of polarized particles in a dielectric, yet sometimes Faraday discusses them as having an existence all their own as in stretching across a vacuum. In addition to lines of force, J.J. Thomson—similar to Maxwell—also calls them tubes of electrostatic inductance, or simply Faraday tubes. [...] From the 20th century <b>perspective,</b> <b>lines</b> of force are energy linkages embedded in a 19th-century unified field theory that led to more mathematically and experimentally sophisticated concepts and theories, including Maxwell's equations, electromagnetic waves, and Einstein's relativity.|$|E
6000|$|For instance, no {{mountain}} in the Alps produces a more vigorous impression of peakedness than the Matterhorn. In Professor Forbes's work on the Alps, it is spoken of as an [...] "obelisk" [...] of rock, and represented with little exaggeration in his seventh plate under the outline Fig. 31. Naturally, in glancing, whether at the plate or the mountain, we assume the mass to be a peak, and suppose the line a b to be the steep slope of its side. But that <b>line</b> is a <b>perspective</b> <b>line.</b> It is in reality perfectly horizontal, corresponding to e f in the penthouse roof, Fig. 30.|$|R
50|$|Among all the {{heritage}} of Lin Kegong, “The Countryside in the UK” was the earliest {{that can be seen}} by us. In this picture, the beautiful of a river in Bristow, UK was depicted. Attracted by light reflected by the river, Lin Kegong applied the <b>perspective</b> <b>line</b> disappearance method to show the near sight and the distant view. Then he showed the actual distance by means {{of the size of the}} crossing waterway and the bridge. In this picture, the leveling method is applied while quite a few marks can be traced out of its subtlety and sensitivity. The vigorous and glossy traces also reflected that such a method is a most widely used method in watercolor painting.|$|R
40|$|We seek {{to detect}} the {{vanishing}} points implied by design sketches of engineering products. Adapting previous ap- proaches, developed in computer vision for analysis of vectorised photographic images, is unsatisfactory, as they do not allow for the inherent imperfection of sketches. Human perception seems not to be disturbed by such imperfections. Hence, we have de- signed and implemented a vanishing point detection algorithm which mimics the human perception process and tested it with <b>perspective</b> <b>line</b> drawings derived from engineering sketches of polyhedral objects. The new algorithm is fast, easily- implemented, returns the approximate locations of the main vanishing points and identifies those groups of lines in 2 D which correspond to groups of parallel edges in the 3 D object...|$|R
5000|$|An early {{example of}} an {{impossible}} object comes from Apolinère Enameled, a 1916 advertisement painted by Marcel Duchamp. It depicts a girl painting a bed-frame with white enamelled paint, and deliberately includes conflicting <b>perspective</b> <b>lines,</b> to produce an impossible object. To emphasise the deliberate impossibility of the shape, {{a piece of the}} frame is missing.Swedish artist Oscar Reutersvärd {{was one of the first}} to deliberately design many impossible objects. He has been called [...] "the father of impossible figures". In 1934 he drew the Penrose triangle, some years before the Penroses. In Reutersvärd's version the sides of the triangle are broken up into cubes.|$|E
5000|$|The {{discrepancy}} between objects at various distances from the viewer may indicate Vermeer used a camera obscura, according to Cant. Liedtke {{points out that}} a pinhole discovered in the canvas [...] "has really punctured {{the theory of the}} camera obscura ... The idea that Vermeer traced compositions in an optical device ... is rather naive when you consider that the light lasts maybe 10 seconds, but the painting took at least months to paint." [...] Instead, The pin in the canvas would have been tied to a string with chalk on it, which the painter would have snapped to get <b>perspective</b> <b>lines,</b> Liedtke said in a 2009 interview.|$|E
50|$|In {{common with}} other {{depictions of the}} Last Supper from this period, Leonardo seats the diners {{on one side of}} the table, so that none of them has his back to the viewer. Most {{previous}} depictions excluded Judas by placing him alone on the opposite side of the table from the other eleven disciples and Jesus, or placing halos around all the disciples except Judas. Leonardo instead has Judas lean back into shadow. Jesus is predicting that his betrayer will take the bread at the same time he does to Saints Thomas and James to his left, who react in horror as Jesus points with his left hand to a piece of bread before them. Distracted by the conversation between John and Peter, Judas reaches for a different piece of bread not noticing Jesus too stretching out with his right hand towards it (Matthew 26: 23). The angles and lighting draw attention to Jesus, whose head is located at the vanishing point for all <b>perspective</b> <b>lines.</b>|$|E
