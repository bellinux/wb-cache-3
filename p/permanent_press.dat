This treatment has a lasting effect on the fabric, namely in shirts, trousers, and slacks. <b>Permanent</b> <b>press</b> was invented in 1964 by Ruth Rogan Benerito, research leader of the Physical Chemistry Research Group of the Cotton Chemical Reactions Laboratory.|$|E

Some acrylamide {{is used in the}} manufacture of dyes and the manufacture of other monomers.|$|E

2500|$|Early Boy Scout uniforms were {{copies of}} the U.S. Army uniforms of the time. Scouts {{generally}} wore knickers with leggings, a button-down choke-collar coat and the campaign hat. Adults wore a Norfolk jacket with knickers or trousers. In 1916, Congress banned civilians from wearing uniforms that were similar in appearance {{to those of the}} U.S. armed forces {{with the exception of the}} BSA. The uniform was redesigned in 1923—the coat and leggings were dropped and the neckerchief standardized. In the 1930s, shorts replaced knickers and their wear was encouraged by the BSA. The garrison (flat) cap was introduced in 1943. In 1965, the uniform's material was changed from wool and cotton to <b>permanent</b> <b>press</b> cloth, although the older material uniforms continued to be sold and used through the late 1960s. The Improved Scouting Program in 1972 included a major overhaul of badges and other insignia, replacing many two color patches with multicolor versions. Also introduced was a red beret and a dark green shirt for [...] "Leadership Corps" [...] members (ages 14–15) in a Scout troop. This was done to relate those older Boy Scouts to Explorers, which wore the same uniform shirt, but by the early 1980s, the red beret and the Leadership Corps concept had been discarded.|$|E

2500|$|For most people, {{irritation}} from formaldehyde {{is temporary}} and reversible, though formaldehyde can cause allergies and {{is part of}} the standard patch test series. In 2005–06, it was the seventh-most-prevalent allergen in patch tests (9.0%). [...] People with formaldehyde allergy are advised to avoid formaldehyde releasers as well (e.g., Quaternium-15, imidazolidinyl urea, and diazolidinyl urea). People who suffer allergic reactions to formaldehyde tend to display lesions on the skin in the areas that have had direct contact with the substance, such as the neck or thighs (often due to formaldehyde released from <b>permanent</b> <b>press</b> finished clothing) or dermatitis on the face (typically from cosmetics). Formaldehyde has been banned in cosmetics in both Sweden and Japan. The eyes are most sensitive to formaldehyde exposure: The lowest level at which many people can begin to smell formaldehyde is about 0.05 ppm and the highest level is 1 ppm. The maximum concentration value at the workplace is 0.3 ppm. In controlled chamber studies, individuals begin to sense eye irritation at about 0.5 ppm; 5 to 20 percent report eye irritation at 0.5 to 1 ppm; and greater certainty for sensory irritation occurred at 1 ppm and above. While some agencies have used a level as low as 0.1 ppm as a threshold for irritation, the expert panel found that a level of 0.3 ppm would protect against nearly all irritation. In fact, the expert panel found that a level of 1.0 ppm would avoid eye irritation—the most sensitive endpoint—in 75–95% of all people exposed.|$|E

40|$|In {{this work}} is {{described}} a piezoelectric motor whose stator is composed of a cylindrical steel axis fitted {{at the center of}} a thin piezoelectric membrane. The rotor consists of a cylindrical <b>permanent</b> magnet, <b>pressed</b> in contact with the top surface of the axis, by means of magnetic forces. A travelling wave, at the natural flexural vibration of the thin piezoelectric membrane, is excited via piezoelectric effect. The vertical displacement of the membrane is geometrically amplified by the central axis, obtaining a wide precessional motion of the axis. The novelty of the proposed motor is a new transmission mechanism, which is based on the precessional motion. With this motor we obtained a relatively high speed (≈ 4000 rpm) by using a commercial piezoelectric membrane (φ 32 mm, thickness 0. 2 mm), driven at relatively low voltage (± 18 V...|$|R

40|$|The piezomotor is {{composed}} of a stator, a steel axle, and a rotor. In the stator, which consists of a piezoelectric membrane, a flexural traveling wave is excited via piezoelectric effect. The rotating flexural displacement of the membrane excites a wide precessional wave in the axle; this wave propagates as in a waveguide, producing a precessional motion in the terminal surface of the axle. The rotor consists of a cylindrical <b>permanent</b> magnet, <b>pressed</b> {{in contact with the}} top surface of the axle by means of the magnetic force. In this way, a continuous slipping takes place between the terminal surface of the axle and the rotor. We demonstrate that the acoustic waveguide can transfer a good mechanical power (max torque 1. 5 × 10 − 5  Nm, max rotational velocity 3500 rpm) with unique design flexibility in a variety of different microsystem applications...|$|R
2500|$|Despite their name, aerogels are solid, rigid, and dry {{materials}} {{that do not}} resemble a gel in their physical properties: the name {{comes from the fact}} that they are made from gels. Pressing softly on an aerogel typically does not leave even a minor mark; pressing more firmly will leave a <b>permanent</b> depression. <b>Pressing</b> extremely firmly will cause a catastrophic breakdown in the sparse structure, causing it to shatter like glass– a property known as friability; although more modern variations do not suffer from this. Despite the fact that it is prone to shattering, it is very strong structurally. Its impressive load bearing abilities are due to the dendritic microstructure, in which spherical particles of average size (2–5nm) are fused together into clusters. These clusters form a three-dimensional highly porous structure of almost fractal chains, with pores just under 100nm. The average size and density of the pores can be controlled during the manufacturing process.|$|R
