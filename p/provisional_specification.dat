50|$|If a South African {{inventor}} applies for a patent, {{the application}} {{is accompanied by}} a provisional or complete specification. A <b>provisional</b> <b>specification</b> is lodged at CIPC if the inventor is still testing or developing the product or process. The <b>provisional</b> <b>specification</b> affords temporary protection for 12 months, extendible locally for three months, and forms the basis for a complete patent application and foreign patent applications. Once the invention has been fully developed and tested, a fresh patent application, with complete specification, is filed. If the product or process has already been technically finalised from the start, only a complete specification is lodged.|$|E
50|$|SPIR {{prior to}} the 2015 SPIR-V release {{was based on the}} LLVM Intermediate Representation. A <b>provisional</b> <b>specification</b> for SPIR 1.0 was {{announced}} in 2012. Version 1.2 was announced at SIGGRAPH 2013, with version 2.0 following at the same conference a year later.|$|E
50|$|The {{specific}} affordances of {{time-based media}} and live interaction with code {{has led to}} a number of novel developments and uses in programming language design. Through mutual embedding of imperative and declarative subsystems, the programming language SuperCollider permitted to build a library that allows incomplete and <b>provisional</b> <b>specifications</b> which can be rewritten at runtime.|$|R
50|$|Term {{of every}} patent in India is 20 {{years from the}} date of filing of patent application, {{irrespective}} of whether it is filed with <b>provisional</b> or complete <b>specification.</b> However, in case of applications filed under PCT the term of 20 years begins from International filing date.|$|R
40|$|The GraphBLAS C <b>specification</b> <b>provisional</b> release 1. 0 is complete. To {{manage the}} scope of the project, we had to defer {{important}} functionality to a future version of the specification.   For example, we are well aware that many algorithms benefit from an inspector-executor execution strategy.   We also know that users would benefit from a number of standard predefined semirings as well as more general user-defined types. These and other features are described in this paper {{in the context of a}} future release of the GraphBLAS C API...|$|R
50|$|For {{the purpose}} of the state regulation, ethanol is defined as ethyl alcohol that is at least 99% pure ethanol by volume that meets American Society of Testing and Materials (ASTM) {{specification}} D4806. Biodiesel is a monoalkyl ester derived from vegetable oils, rendered animal fats, or renewable lipids or a combination of those ingredients, and meets the requirements of ASTM PS 121, the <b>provisional</b> <b>specification</b> for biodiesel.|$|E
5000|$|The {{ratification}} {{and release}} of the OpenCL 2.1 <b>provisional</b> <b>specification</b> was announced on March 3, 2015 at the Game Developer Conference in San Francisco. It was released on November 16, 2015. It introduced the OpenCL C++ kernel language, based on a subset of C++14, while maintaining support for the preexisting OpenCL C kernel language. Vulkan and OpenCL 2.1 share SPIR-V as an intermediate representation allowing high-level language front-ends to share a common compilation target. Updates to the OpenCL API include: ...|$|E
40|$|Satellites in {{geosynchronous}} orbit have been experiencing operational anomalies. These anomalies {{are believed to}} be due to the environment charging the spacecraft surfaces to a point where discharges occur. In designing future satellites for long term operation at geosynchronous altitude, it is important that designers have a specification that will give the total time per year, the particle flux density, and particle energies that their satellites can be expected to encounter in these substorm environmental conditions. The limited data currently available on the environmental conditions was used to generate the <b>provisional</b> <b>specification</b> given...|$|E
40|$|Past {{generations of}} access control systems, {{when faced with}} an access request, have issued a “yes ” (resp. “no”) answer to the access request {{resulting}} in access being granted (resp. denied). In this paper, we argue that for the world’s rapidly proliferating business to business (B 2 B) applications and auctions, “yes/no ” responses are just not enough. We propose {{the notion of a}} “provisional authorization ” which intuitively says “You may perform the desired access provided you cause condition C to be satisfied. ” For instance, a user accessing an online brokerage may receive some information if he fills out his name/address, but not otherwise. While a variety of such provisional authorization mechanisms exist on the web, they are all hardcoded on an application by application basis. We show that given (almost) any logic L, we may define a <b>provisional</b> authorization <b>specification</b> language pASL L. pASL L is based on the declarative, polynomially evaluable authorization specification language ASL proposed by Jajodia et al. We define programs in pASL L, and specify how given any access request, we must find a “weakest” precondition under which the access can be granted (in the worst case, if this weakest precondition is “false ” this amounts to a denial). We develop a model theoretic semantics for pASL L and show how it can be applied to online sealed-bid auction servers and online contracting...|$|R
5000|$|The {{similarities}} between the LP12 and the Ariston RD11 resulted in a patent case: Ariston vs. Linn, or more correctly, Fergus Fons Ltd, Hamish Robertson vs. Ivor Tiefenbrun. In 1972, the late Jack Yan Tiefenbrun filed a pair of <b>provisional</b> patent <b>specifications</b> for a simple point-contact bearing, and followed them up in June 1973 with a complete specification claiming 'improvements in, or relating to, gramophone record playing apparatus'. The application was accepted by the British Patent Office and published as BP1394611. In May 1975, following {{the publication of the}} Tiefenbrun patent, an opposition was lodged by turntable manufacturer Fergus Fons Ltd and the late William James Hamish Robertson. The patent was opposed on various grounds, including that 'what was being claimed as new, was in fact old', and that the idea was 'lacking in inventive step' over what was already known. A further ground of opposition was that the invention had been 'obtained' from Hamish Robertson, and was his original idea rather than that of Jack Tiefenbrun. Jack Tiefenbrun had formed Castle Precision Engineering (Glasgow) Ltd some 15 years earlier. Hamish Robertson had a company called Thermac in 1967, which became Ariston in 1970, and Ariston Audio in 1973. In 1970 Jack's son Ivor formed a friendship with Hamish. In 1971 Ivor made a prototype turntable with a ball bearing, and then went to Israel. While Ivor was away, Jack and Hamish changed the ball bearing to a single point bearing. Robertson's company Thermac then ordered forty of the turntables from Castle Precision Engineering Ltd. In 1971, and now operating as Ariston, Hamish showed the turntable under the model name RD11 at the Harrogate show, and set up a distribution network with C. J. Walker and Company. By the end of 1972 relations between Robertson and the Tiefenbruns had broken down. This allegedly led to a threat to Robertson that a copyright action would be brought against him if he had the RD11 turntable made elsewhere than at Castle Precision Engineering. In February 1973 Linn Products Ltd was formed to sell turntables made by Castle Precision Engineering. Robertson left Ariston, which by now had been taken over by Dunlop Westayr Ltd, and became director Fergus Fons Ltd. In the end The Robertsons’ opposition to the Tiefenbrun patent was rejected.|$|R
30|$|As the {{expression}} ‘Responsible Innovation’ and its expanded version are still of recent coinage, they should properly {{give rise to}} some wonder and surprise. This new combination of words duly invites the question to what extent innovation can actually be ‘responsible’ and what sense of ‘responsibility’ might be implied in this connection. To explore this question, we start by turning to the classical authors Max Weber and John Dewey to give a <b>provisional</b> <b>specification</b> {{to the notion of}} responsibility, which can serve as a baseline for our discussion of Responsible Innovation in the area of biofuels.|$|E
40|$|The BS 7988 {{standard}} is now formally published, and is broadly {{in line with}} the <b>provisional</b> <b>specification</b> presented by John Kleeman, David Keech and Stephen Wright to this conference last year. Compliance with the standard requires quality assurance across a wide range of areas - hardware, software, network, data storage and human issues are all covered. It requires consideration of security, reliability and accessibility. In this session we will work collectively to build a provisional framework for a QA system to cover those areas of the Standard that fall within the remit of conference delegates, principally those relating to software development. The output of the session will be a draft of a quality audit that can be published as part of the conference proceedings. While clearly this will be very much a first-stage document, we hope that it will provide pointers for further work in this area...|$|E

40|$|The rapid {{increase}} in data volume and data availability along {{with the need for}} continual quality assured searching and indexing information of such data requires efficient and effective metadata management strategies. From this perspective, the necessity for adequate, well-managed and high quality Metadata is becoming increasingly essential for successful long-term high quality data preservation. Metadata's assistance in reconstruction or accessibility of preserved data, however, bears the same predicament as that of the efficient use of digital information over time: long-term metadata quality and integrity assurance notwithstanding the rapid evolvements of metadata formats and related technology. Therefore, in order to ascertain the overall quality and integrity of metadata over a sustained period of time, thereby assisting in successful long-term digital preservation, effective long-term metadata curation is indispensable. This paper presents an approach to long-term metadata curation, which involves a <b>provisional</b> <b>specification</b> of the core requirements of long-term metadata curation. In addition, the paper introduces “Metadata Curation Record”, expressed {{in the form of an}} XML Schema, which essentially captures additional statements about both data objects and associated metadata to aid long-term digital curation. The paper also presents a metadata schema mapping/migration tool, which may be regarded as a fundamental stride towards an efficient and curation-aware metadata migration strategy. 1...|$|E
