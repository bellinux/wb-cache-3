5000|$|The Convention was revised in Geneva in 1972, 1978 and 1991. Both the 1978 and the 1991 Acts set out {{a minimum}} scope of {{protection}} and offer member States the possibility of taking national circumstances into account in their legislation. Under the 1978 Act, the minimum scope of the plant breeder's right requires that the holder's prior authorisation {{is necessary for the}} production for purposes of commercial marketing, the offering for sale and the marketing of <b>propagating</b> <b>material</b> of the protected variety. The 1991 Act contains more detailed provisions defining the acts concerning <b>propagating</b> <b>material</b> in relation to which the holder's authorisation is required. The breeder's authorisation is also required in relation to any of the specified acts done with harvested material of the variety, unless the breeder has had reasonable opportunity to exercise their right in relation to the <b>propagating</b> <b>material,</b> or if not doing so could constitute an [...] "Omega Threat" [...] situation. Under that provision, for example, a flower breeder who protects their variety in the Netherlands could block importation of cut flowers of that variety into the Netherlands from Egypt, which does not grant plant breeders' rights, because the breeder had no opportunity to exercise any rights in Egypt. Member countries also have the option to require the breeder's authorization with respect to the specified acts as applied to products directly obtained from the harvested material (such as flour or oil from grain, or juice from fruit), unless the breeder has had reasonable opportunity to exercise their right in relation to the harvested material.|$|E

5000|$|... ==Cultivation== Leucadendron {{plants are}} {{conventionally}} propagated through seedlings {{as well as}} cuttings. The seeds reach maturity over a duration of a year. This time of germination and emergence depends {{on the type of}} Leucadendron genus. When using cuttings as <b>propagating</b> <b>material,</b> the season as well as the type of material used can affect the success rate of the cultivation. Cuttings are preferred as <b>propagating</b> <b>material,</b> because it provides uniform offspring whereas seedlings produces genetic variability in the offspring. The Leucadendron genus are more prone to genetic variation than a genus that tend to self-fertilize, because of their cross-pollinating nature. In the natural habitat the Leucadendron grows exceptionally well, {{but in the case of}} cultivation the specific needs of the plant has to be readily available to allow optimal production to produce high quality cut flowers and foliage. Steps for cultivation include soil evaluation, clearing, drainage, chemical correction, and the physical preparation should be critically considered five months prior to planting Leucadendrons.The selection criteria for cultivating Leucadendron genera is of great importance and should be based on the agricultural ability of the plant as well as the current market standards.|$|E

40|$|Castanea is a {{hardwood}} forest genus of considerable agro-economic importance for both timber and nut production. Chestnuts {{are one of}} the most significant nut crops in the temperate zone. However, this species is threatened by pollution, social factors, economical changes, and two major fungal diseases: ink disease (Phytophthora spp.), and chestnut blight canker (Cryphonectria parasitica). Similar to other wood species, chestnuts are difficult to propagate both generatively by seed and vegetatively by means of grafting or cuttings. Biotechnological methods such as in vitro culture have been developed in the last few years as an alternative to conventional vegetative propagation. Biotechnology plays a very important role not only in the propagation of selected individuals (being used at a commercial level), but also in its short-term preservation, and offers the possibility of preserving the <b>propagated</b> <b>material</b> in the medium-term (cold storage) or long-term using cryopreservation...|$|R

50|$|The crop can be {{cultivated}} in paddies (2-7.5m wide {{by up to}} 100m long to allow for mechanization) or in a hydroponic culture. As it is an aquatic plant, it should always be submerged in approx. 10 cm of water. The crop needs continuously high soil temperatures, ideally 14-15.5 Â°C. At 13.6 Â°C, the corms begin to sprout. Soil is ideally a sandy loam with pH 6.5 to 7.2. The plant produces two types of subterranean rhizomes. Under long-daylength conditions, rhizomes grow horizontally and then turn upwards forming daughter plants. Under short-daylength conditions, the rhizomes grow downward and produce a corm at the tip. The photoperiod also significantly influences how fast the corms grow. Corms begin to develop much more slowly if the photoperiod exceeds 12 hours. The corms are also the <b>propagating</b> <b>material.</b> Alternatively, transplants can be used. Machinery such as tractor-mounted vegetable planters {{can be used for}} plantation.|$|E
50|$|The {{foundations}} for the inspection services were {{laid in the}} late nineteenth century when a growing demand became apparent for safeguards regarding the quality of <b>propagating</b> <b>material</b> and seed. This need resulted in several inspection initiatives. In 1919 the Central Committee for the Inspection of Plants was established, followed by the Inspection Institute for Seeds and Planting Materials. Both organisations competed in their seed inspection activities. The establishment in 1932 of the Netherlands General Inspection Service for Agricultural Seeds and Seed Potatoes (NAK) signalled the end of the confusion. From then on, the inspection of agricultural crops was centralised. The first merger was between the then Netherlands General Inspection Service for Arboricultural Crops (NAKB) (1941) and the Netherlands General Inspection Service for Floricultural Crops (NAKS) (1947). This resulted in the creation of the NAKB. In 2000 the new NAKB and NAKG (the Netherlands General Inspection Service for Vegetable and Flower Seeds, 1941) merged to form the current Naktuinbouw.|$|E

40|$|Photonic {{crystals}} are a novel {{class of}} optical materials that, almost certainly, will underpin major advances in future communication and computer technology. In a photonic crystal, the periodic distribution of refractive index {{gives rise to}} interferometric action which leads to band gaps, or frequency ranges for which light cannot <b>propagate.</b> <b>Material</b> or structural defects in the crystal can give rise to localised states, or field modes, that are the analogues of impurity modes in semiconductors, changing the radiation dynamics of the crystal and providing the ability to mould the flow of light {{in a variety of}} ways.

The latter are of particular significance as they provide a framework for investigating fabrication tolerances for realistic crystals. Key words and phrase...|$|R
40|$|Summary: Fuchsia (Fuchsia excorticata) {{has been}} heavily browsed and often killed by brushtail possums (Trichosurus vulpecula) in many New Zealand {{indigenous}} forests, but remains healthy at some sites despite long histories of possum occupation. To determine whether fuchsia varied genetically in its palatability to possums, material from six widely dispersed stands (provenances) was propagated, and leaf chemistry, leaf morphology, growth rate, and palatability to captive possums was compared. Leaf specific gravity, nitrogen, and phosphorous levels in field-collected foliage varied between palatable and apparently unpalatable provenances of fuchsia. However, these variables, and palatability to captive possums, {{were similar in}} <b>propagated</b> <b>material</b> from all provenances. To test the hypothesis that selective browsing had eliminated the more palatable or susceptible genotypes at sites where possums have been present for long periods, we tested the relationship between variation within provenances of measured variables and length of possum occupation at each site, but no significant relationships were found. These results suggest that phenotypic or situational differences rather than genetic variation between the six provenances may help explain observed regional differences in fuchsia health...|$|R

40|$|Since the {{worldwide}} grapevine planting {{boom in the}} 1990 s, {{there have been numerous}} reports of sporadic young vine failures and early decline of young vineyards. In many cases, the leading causes of these problems have been traced to defective, but often asymptomatic, <b>propagating</b> and planting <b>materials</b> infected with trunk disease pathogens, or with other defects that affect vine establishment, vigour and longevity. Current propagation practices favour cross-contamination by trunk disease pathogens and impose physiological stress that affects the quality of finished vines.

40|$|Most {{restoration}} projects {{strive to}} create a sustainable plant community but exclusive use of vegetatively <b>propagated</b> <b>material</b> may be preventing this goal. The dioecious willows and cottonwoods of the Salicaceae are widely used in riparian restoration projects. Hardwood cuttings have traditionally been used to propagate these species in nurseries, and live stakes, branched cuttings, and poles are also used in bioengineering structures for bank stabilization. Woody cuttings are collected either from the project site or from stooling beds in nurseries during the winter dormant period. Unfortunately, {{little attention has been}} given to the sex of the donor plants. The potential problem is that a proper mixture of male and female plants may not be present in the hardwood cuttings or rooted cuttings destined for the restoration siteâin the worst case they may be entirely 1 sex or the other. Fortunately, it is relatively easy to distinguish male and female plants. Collecting cuttings from many different plants and from a known ratio of males and females will ensure that the resultant plants will be able to produce viable seeds and achieve the ultimate goal of a sustainable plant community...|$|R
40|$|In {{the period}} 1998 â 2001 {{significant}} numbers of vine samples of different varieties, grafted onto different rootstocks, ready for out-planting or planted and declined a few months or years later, were collected or sent to our laboratory to investigate the presence of phytopathogenic fungi. Three hundred eighty rooted cuttings ready for outplanting, 1250 young vines planted and exhibiting decline symptoms {{in the first year}} of establishment, 82 vines two to nine years old and 27 old vines exhibiting the classical esca symptoms were examined. Isolations yielded the fungi Phaeomoniella chlamydospora, Fomitiporia punctata and Stereum hirsutum, as well as other fungi of the genera Phaeoacremonium, Cylindrocarpon and Botryosphaeria. The low incidence of these fungi isolated in a low percentage of samples suggested that they could not by themselves be the cause of young grapevine decline. Abiotic causes, such as lesions from improperly healed rootstock disbudding sites and graft unions made in the nursery, as well as improper storage and transportation conditions of the <b>propagated</b> <b>material</b> must also have played a role and made the decline more acute.
