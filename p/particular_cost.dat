40|$|The {{main goal}} of this thesis is {{evaluation}} of different approaches to product costing.

40|$|Abstract — In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} the problem of motion planning and control of a kinematically redundant manipulator which is used on forestry machines for logging. Once a desired path is specified in the 3 D world frame, a trajectory can be planned and executed such that all joints are synchronized and path-constrained. A speed profile can be chosen according to <b>particular</b> <b>costs</b> (time, fuel consumption, etc.) and certain constraints of the mechanical construction and dynamics. We suggest a time-independent control scheme for the planned trajectory which is built upon the standard reference tracking controllers. Experimental tests underline the benefits and efficiency of the model-based trajectory planning and show success of the proposed control strategy...|$|R

40|$|Considerable neuroimaging {{research}} in humans {{indicates that the}} frontal pole cortex (FPC), also known as Brodmann area 10, contributes to many aspects of cognition. Despite these findings, however, its fundamental function and mechanism remain unclear. Recent neurophysiological results from the FPC of monkeys have implications about both. Neurons in the FPC seem to encode chosen goals at feedback time and nothing else. Goals, the places and objects that serve as targets for action, come in many forms and arise from many cognitive processes. The FPC's signal, although surprisingly simple for neurons {{at the apex of}} a prefrontal hierarchy, could promote learning about which kinds of goals and goal-generating processes produce <b>particular</b> <b>costs</b> and benefits, thereby improving future choices...|$|R
40|$|In the United States child {{adoption}} costs vary considerably, {{ranging from}} no out-of-pocket expense to $ 50, 000 or more. What are the causes for {{the variability in}} adoption expenses? We administered a survey {{to a sample of}} Michigan adoptive families to link adoptive parent characteristics, child characteristics, and adoption-related expenses and subsidies. We then estimate “hedonic ” regressions in which adoption cost is a function of child characteristics. The analysis shows that most of the variation in adoption costs is explained by child characteristics. In <b>particular,</b> <b>costs</b> lower for older children, children of African descent, and special needs children. Findings inform policies regarding the transition of children from foster care to adoptive families...|$|R

50|$|Variable {{costs are}} costs that change in {{proportion}} to the good or service that a business produces. Variable costs are also the sum of marginal costs over all units produced. They can also be considered normal costs. Fixed costs and variable costs make up the two components of total cost. Direct costs, however, are costs that can easily be associated with a <b>particular</b> <b>cost</b> object. However, not all variable costs are direct costs. For example, variable manufacturing overhead costs are variable costs that are indirect costs, not direct costs. Variable costs are sometimes called unit-level costs as they vary with the number of units produced.|$|E
50|$|Jindal led in {{the primary}} for the first general {{election}} berth with 33 percent of the vote.

Ieyoub drew 223,513 votes (16 percent), some 27,000 raw votes below his Senate showing seven years earlier. Leach finished in fourth place with 187,872 (14 percent).

50|$|The team's {{struggles in}} the late 1990s were {{due in part to}} {{ownership}} instability. COMSAT bought the NHL's Quebec Nordiques in 1995 and moved them to Denver as the Colorado Avalanche.

In <b>particular,</b> <b>cost</b> overruns associated with the construction of Pepsi Center had shareholders up in arms.

40|$|Taking {{into account}} the link between energy demand and equip-ment choice, leads to {{a new model of}} energy demand where the key {{variables}} are energy prices, price volatility and the costs of equipment. In particular we show that adjustment to changes in relative energy prices are generally asymmetric, as the adjustment involves adaptation of equipment costs. As a consequence, the optimal equipment choice in the long run could imply short-term allocative ine ¢ ciency in en-ergy use. This model {{can be seen as a}} mix or a generalization of the Putty-Putty versus Putty-Clay models of energy use. Depending on the technology and in <b>particular</b> <b>costs</b> of energy equipment, the model gives drastically di¤erent predictions about the e¤ect of energy prices and uncertainty on energy demand...|$|R

50|$|Overhead is {{an ongoing}} {{business}} expense which cannot directly be allocated to a <b>particular</b> <b>cost</b> unit, {{which is why they}} belong to the so-called hidden costs. Despite not directly creating profits, they do still contribute to the ongoing business activities. Overhead can, for instance, be in the form of company cars. Buying a company car and maintaining it is a business expense, which is not profitable as such. However, a company car is seen as an asset and employees can use the car to go to meetings or to run errands, so that the company car eventually {{turns out to be a}} good investment. Another example of overhead expenses is budget dedicated for travel entertainment. These expenses do not create direct profit but are still vital to the business.|$|E
50|$|In business, {{overhead}} or overhead expense {{refers to}} an ongoing expense of operating a business; it {{is also known as}} an operating expense. Overheads are the expenditure which cannot be conveniently traced to or identified with any <b>particular</b> <b>cost</b> unit. Therefore, overheads cannot be immediately associated with the products or services being offered, thus do not directly generate profits. However, overheads are still vital to business operations as they provide critical support for the business to carry out profit making activities. For example, overhead costs such as the rent for a factory allows workers to manufacture products which can then be sold for a profit. Such expenses are incurred for output generally and not for particular work order; e.g., wages paid to watch and ward staff, heating and lighting expenses of factory, etc. Overheads are also very important cost element along with direct materials and direct labor.|$|E
5000|$|One key {{objective}} of cost engineering is {{to arrive at}} accurate cost estimates and schedules and to avoid cost overruns and schedule slips. Cost engineering goes beyond preparing cost estimates and schedules by helping manage resources and supporting assessment and decision making. [...] "The discipline of ‘cost engineering’ can be considered to encompass {{a wide range of}} cost-related aspects of engineering and programme management, but in <b>particular</b> <b>cost</b> estimating,cost analysis/cost assessment, design-to-cost, schedule analysis/planning and risk assessment." [...] The broad array of cost engineering topics represent the intersection of the fields of project management, business management, and engineering. Most people have a limited view of what engineering encompasses. The most obvious perception is that engineering addresses technical issues such as the physical design of a structure or system. However, beyond the physical manifestation of a design of a structure or system (for example, a building), there are other dimensions to consider such as the money, time, and other resources that were invested {{in the creation of the}} building. Cost engineers refer to these investments collectively as [...] "costs".|$|E
