50|$|Initially, {{the clinic}} had spartan {{premises}} - an old shop, possessing a cold tap only, {{and with the}} waiting room furnished with wooden benches. However, in 1957 a bequest of £2000 allowed the <b>purchase</b> <b>of</b> <b>premises</b> in Dean Terrace, a Georgian town house carefully chosen for its secluded location. The clinic remained there for over 50 years, until it moved to Chalmers Community Clinic in Lauriston Place, at that point becoming a combined family planning, well woman and sexual and reproductive health clinic.|$|E

50|$|After {{the turn}} of the century the town's key {{function}} changed from gold mining to service town for the surrounding dairy and fruit- growing district. Accordingly, the QNB turned to commerce and agriculture to provide the Gympie branch's business. Over time the commercial centre of the town moved eastward down Mary Street in response to commercial activity centering upon the railway station. As a result, the QNB Board sanctioned the <b>purchase</b> <b>of</b> <b>premises</b> at the corner of Mary and Monkland Streets in 1937 for its operations and approved the sale of the Channon Street bank premises. In the following year it was sold. The building was used by industrial service businesses until its purchase by the Widgee Shire Council in 1990.|$|E
50|$|By his will, dated 1 October 1623, {{besides a}} long list of smaller legacies, he left money for lectureships at St. Paul's, at St. Dunstan's, and one for the Newgate prisoners; but his chief bequest was £3,000 for the <b>purchase</b> <b>of</b> <b>premises</b> 'fit to make a college for a {{corporation}} of all the ministers, parsons, vicars, lecturers, and curates within London and suburbs thereof; as also for a convenient house or place fast by, to make a convenient almeshouse for twenty persons, viz. ten men and ten women.' This was afterwards known as Sion College, designed as a guild of the clergy of the city of London and its suburbs, placing them in the same position as most other callings and professions who enjoyed charters of incorporation, and with common privileges and property. To the exertions of John Simpson, his cousin, and one of his executors are chiefly due the charter obtained in 1630 incorporating the college, and also the erection of the building at London Wall in 1629, where the library remained until it moved to a new building on the Victoria Embankment in 1886. Simpson was the builder and founder of the major library of the institution.|$|E
50|$|The {{association}} {{began with}} fewer than 20 members but, despite this, an insurance scheme was set in place for its membership. In the ensuing years, the BCA gradually developed to take the form that it does today.When the British Chiropractic Association announced the <b>purchase</b> <b>of</b> <b>premises</b> in Bournemouth {{for the establishment of}} a chiropractic college in 1964, the number of chiropractors practising in the UK was quite small.The opening of the Anglo-European College of Chiropractic, in 1965, led to a steady increase in the numbers of chiropractors in the UK and, in 2010, there were more than 1,300 practicing members and over 600 student members. Today, members have practices spanning the whole of the United Kingdom and BCA members are graduates of 20 different internationally accredited chiropractic educational institutions. The association only accepts into membership graduates of a Chiropractic degree course validated by a member of the Council of Chiropractic Education International (CCEI). Individual applicants must also ensure their course meets the requirements of the UK regulator, the General Chiropractic Council.The association provides a wide range of services for members and as an information source for the public. The association celebrated its 80th anniversary in 2005.|$|E

50|$|Many village {{residents}} were unhappy {{about the loss}} of the village shop so a public meeting was arranged to discuss the possibilities of getting the shop back in business.

40|$|Australian {{community}} {{radio stations}} are licensed to service and represent a kaleidoscope of {{communities across the}} vast Australian continent distinguished by geography and/or interest. They are, by law, required to adopt a non-profit status; and while they seek and accept sponsorship from local businesses and organisations, all finances gained must be directed back into stations {{in one way or}} another. Usually, this takes the form of training, <b>purchase</b> <b>of</b> <b>premises,</b> employment of staff, purchase of equipment, and so on. This chapter seeks to pursue the authors' combined interest in community broadcasters which do not fit within what is termed 'generalist' stations - those serving a broad, usually geographically-defined audience - focussing instead on Indigenous and ethnic community broadcasting in Australia. It places considerations about the role of these community media into the discourse of contemporary public debates about refugees, asylum-seekers and Indigenous Australians. No Full Tex...|$|E

50|$|Tithe payment was an {{obligation}} on those working {{the land to}} pay ten per cent {{of the value of}} certain types of agricultural produce for the upkeep of the clergy and maintenance of the assets of the church. After the Reformation in Ireland of the 16th century, the assets of the church were allocated by King Henry VIII to the new established church. The majority in Ireland who remained loyal to the old religion were then obliged to make tithe payments which were directed away from their own church to the reformed one. This increased the financial burden on subsistence farmers, many of whom were at the same time making voluntary contributions to the construction or <b>purchase</b> <b>of</b> new <b>premises</b> to provide Roman Catholic places of worship. The new established church was supported by only a minority of the population, seventy-five percent of whom continued to adhere to Roman Catholicism.|$|R

He was educated at Botwnnog grammar school (as was his cousin John Owen, who later became Bishop of St Davids). [...] From there, he proceeded to Jesus College, Oxford where he matriculated in 1873. [...] In 1877, he graduated with a B.A. degree in Literae Humaniores, obtaining his M.A. in 1882. [...] In about 1878, he became headmaster of the Willow Street Academy, a private school in Oswestry, Shropshire. In the 1881 census, the school was recorded as having fourteen boarders aged from ten to twenty four, and a schoolmaster and a housekeeper in addition to Owen. [...] The school’s success led, in 1883, to the <b>purchase</b> <b>of</b> new <b>premises</b> - a house called The Lawn, on Church Street, Oswestry, that had previously been the residence of members of a local wealthy family - and the school was known as Oswestry High School, or the Boys High School. [...] Owen remained as headmaster and the excellent record of the school led to it drawing pupils from across Wales.|$|R

40|$|PELAJ, V. The {{proposal}} {{for improving the}} situation of the family farm. Bachelor thesis. Brno: Mendelova univerzita, 2013 The aim of the thesis is to give a {{proposal for}} improving {{the situation of the}} farm Pelaj, which is focused on breeding of pigs. The work consists of the Theoretical part and the Practical part. The Theoretical part is elaborated on the basis of information obtained from the expert literature. The Practical part includes the analysis of the external and internal environment and the proposal for improving the current situation coming from the analysis. For the analysis of the internal environment the method of the key factors, the financial analysis and the SAP analysis were used. The results of the analysis of the current situation reveal that the appropriate way to improve the situation is to increase the volume of production greatly. That can be realized by <b>purchasing</b> <b>of</b> other <b>premises</b> and then their follow-up reconstruction. In the conclusion some steps that have been already done by the owners of the farm to improve its current situation are mentioned as well as the others that the owners are going to realize in the near future...|$|R
50|$|After {{a period}} of disinterest and lack of funds, the {{institution}} was restored in the 1390s by King Władysław II Jagiełło and his wife Saint Hedwig, the daughter of King Louis of Hungary and Poland. The royal couple decided that, instead <b>of</b> building new <b>premises</b> for the university, {{it would be better}} to buy an existing edifice; it was thus that a building on Żydowska Street, which had previously been the property of the Pęcherz family, was found and acquired in 1399. The Queen donated all of her personal jewelry to the university, allowing it to enroll 203 students. The faculties of astronomy, law and theology attracted eminent scholars: for example, John Cantius, Stanisław of Skarbimierz, Paweł Włodkowic, Jan of Głogów, and Albert Brudzewski, who from 1491 to 1495 was one of Nicolaus Copernicus teachers. The university was the first university in Europe to establish independent chairs in Mathematics and Astronomy. This rapid expansion in the universitys faculty necessitated the <b>purchase</b> <b>of</b> larger <b>premises</b> in which to house them; it was thus that the building known today as the Collegium Maius, with its quadrangle and beautiful arcade, came into being towards the beginning of the 15th century. The Collegium Maius qualities, many of which directly contributed to the sheltered, academic atmosphere at the university, became widely respected, helping the university establish its reputation as a place of learning in Central Europe.|$|R

60|$|The amiable John Evelyn, in his ‘Diary,’ {{mentions}} his visiting Mr. Boyle at Chelsea, on the 9th March, 1661, {{in company}} “with that excellent person and philosopher, Sir Robert Murray,” where they “saw divers {{effects of the}} eolipile for weighing air.” And {{in the same year}} M. de Monconys, a French traveller in England, says, “L’après diné je fus avec M. Oldenburg, {111} et mon fils, à deux milles de Londres en carosse pour cinq chelins à un village nommé le petit Chelsey, voir M. Boyle.” Now at this period there probably was no other house at Little Chelsea of sufficient importance to be the residence of the Hon. Robert Boyle, where he could receive strangers in his laboratory and show them his great telescope; and, moreover, notwithstanding what has been said to prove the impossibility of Locke having visited Lord Shaftesbury on this spot, local tradition continues to assert that Locke’s work on the ‘Human Understanding’ was commenced in the retirement of one of the summer-houses of Lord Shaftesbury’s residence. This certainly may have been the case if we regard Locke as a visitor to his brother philosopher, Boyle, and admit his tenancy of the mansion previous to that of Lord Shaftesbury, to whom Locke, it is very probable, communicated the circumstance, and which might have indirectly led to his lordship’s <b>purchase</b> <b>of</b> the <b>premises.</b> Be that as it may, it is an interesting association, with something more than mere fancy for its support, to contemplate a communion between two of the master-minds of the age, and the influence which their conversation possibly had upon that of the other.|$|R
5000|$|On {{the death}} of her father, Elma and her new husband {{inherited}} the family brewery business. Her father's will had made provision for the brewery to be sold, with the proceeds, together with the family estates, to be held in trust for Elma. Despite this, Elma decided to retain the brewery and continue the family business under the management of William Ward, who was executor of her father's will and Elma's cousin, being the son of Daniel's eldest sister, Betsey. During the early years after her marriage, Mrs. Yerburgh left the management of the brewery to William Ward, while she was occupied with family matters, including the birth of her two children. The couple spent most of their time living at Princes Gate in South Kensington and at Billinge Scar, near Blackburn, interspersed with visits to the other family estates before settling at Woodfold Hall. [...] Prior to {{the death of}} Daniel Thwaites, plans had been drawn up to incorporate the business into a limited company. These had been postponed {{as a result of his}} death, but were finally put in place in March 1897, after William Ward had left the business. Mrs. Yerburgh transferred the business into the new company, Daniel Thwaites & Co. Limited, for the total of £850,000 (of which £250,000 was placed in the Daniel Thwaites Settlement) in a mixture of ordinary shares, preference shares, debenture stock and cash, with the general public subscribing for £134,000 in new preference shares. Following incorporation, the brewery business continued to expand with a programme of modernisation, extension to the brewery buildings and the <b>purchase</b> <b>of</b> licensed <b>premises.</b>|$|R

40|$|This paper {{evaluates the}} impact of the recent Social Assistance System Modernization Project on the three {{outcomes}} – probability of application, probability of getting any assistance, and probability of participation in more than two social assistance programs. Allowing for heterogeneous effect of the Project measures on poor and non-poor families, we find that in general the re-engineering of the system considerably improves targeting. For example, the <b>purchase</b> <b>of</b> new computers and modernization of computer networks improves targeting of the system by decreasing both the application and participation rate among the non-poor and increasing among the poor. Single window application procedure has positive impact on the participation of both groups of population, although the impact on the poor is twice larger in magnitude.
