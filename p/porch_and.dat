5|$|The cathedral is {{situated}} {{adjacent to a}} large lawned area, Cathedral Green, which is approached by three ancient gateways, Brown's Gatehouse, Penniless <b>Porch</b> <b>and</b> Chain Gate. On the green is the 12th-century Old Deanery, largely rebuilt in the late 15th century by Dean Gunthorpe and remodelled by Dean Bathurst in the late 17th century. No longer the dean's residence, it is used as offices for the diocese.|$|E

5|$|The {{first scene}} of the episode, {{depicting}} the celebration of King Joffrey's name day, was filmed on Dubrovnik's Fort Lovrijenac (also called St. Lawrence Fortress).

5|$|A Gothic {{screen was}} also {{added to the}} Norman nave at Peterborough, {{but this is an}} {{architectural}} oddity with no precedent or successor. The screen is composed of three enormous open arches, the two outer ones being much wider than that which frames the central door. The overwhelming composition is somewhat spoilt by the later <b>porch</b> <b>and</b> the fact that two towers of very different height pop up from behind the screen. Despite this, it is {{regarded as one of the}} supreme masterpieces of Gothic, revealing the enormous diversity and imagination of English medieval architects.|$|E
5|$|Built between 1117 and 1508, Peterborough Cathedral is {{remarkable}} as the least altered of the Norman cathedrals with only its famous Early English west front, with its later <b>porch</b> <b>and</b> the Perpendicular rebuilding {{of the eastern}} ambulatory by John Wastell being in different styles. J.L. Cartwright wrote of the west front that it is “as magnificent an entrance to a sacred building as could well be imagined.” The long wooden roof of the nave is original and has retained its painting from 1220.|$|E

The landmark Balustrade or front <b>porch</b> <b>and</b> steps {{leading up to the}} Library became an intimate public space where one could sit and read, wait, chat or simply watch the world go by.|$|E
5|$|St Edern's {{is built}} in the Perpendicular style using local stone, with blocks of cut {{sandstone}} as the external face. The roof is made from slate with stone copings and has a bellcote at the west end, with one bell (dating probably from the 17th century). There is one external buttress to the south-east of the nave to help support {{the weight of the}} building, and there are crosses {{on the roof of the}} <b>porch</b> <b>and</b> at the east end of the nave and chancel roofs.|$|E
5|$|St George's Church is a 14th-century stone {{building}} with slate roof. The roof was thatched until 1863, {{when the church}} was heavily restored. In 1886, it was struck by lightning and required extensive rebuilding. Today, the church consists of a chancel, nave, north <b>porch,</b> <b>and</b> south vestry. The octagonal bowl font still has an original lead lining. St. George's Church, a Grade II* listed building, {{is part of the}} Ely Team Ministry. The Baptist chapel was erected in 1867 on the site of its 1839 predecessor.|$|E

5|$|The Church of St Peter in Staple Fitzpaine was {{originally}} {{built in the}} Norman style, and has a Norman doorway reset in the south aisle. The chancel dates from the 14th century; the north aisle was added and the church refenestrated in the 15th century. The tower dates from about 1500. The south <b>porch</b> <b>and</b> the vestry are much more recent, dating from 1841. The crenellated 3-stage tower, has merlons pierced with trefoil headed arches set on a quatrefoil pierced parapet. The church has been designated by English Heritage as a grade I listed building.|$|E
5|$|The Town Hall {{was built}} in 1778, with the <b>porch</b> <b>and</b> arcade being added in 1861 and the balcony and round windows in 1932. It is a Grade II listed building. It {{replaced}} the former {{on the site of}} the Market and Assize Hall in the Market Place, and a Canonical House also known as 'The Exchequer', on the authority of an Act of Parliament dated 1779. The building also houses the magistrates courts and other offices. The Assize court last sat here in October 1970.|$|E
5|$|Thomas Chatterton, {{whose father}} was sexton of St Mary Redcliffe, {{was born in the}} house next to the church in 1752. He studied the church records in a room above the south <b>porch,</b> <b>and</b> wrote several works which he {{attempted}} to pass as genuine medieval documents. He committed suicide in London at the age of seventeen. In 1795 the church saw the marriages of Samuel Taylor Coleridge to Sara Fricker and Robert Southey to Sarah's sister Elizabeth.|$|E

50|$|Daniel Craycraft House is a {{historic}} home located at Noblesville, Hamilton County, Indiana. It was built in 1892, and is a large 2 1/2-story, Queen Anne style frame dwelling. It features a three-story, square corner tower; cross-gables; steep gable-on-hip roof; <b>porches</b> <b>and</b> balconies; and contrasting textures and materials.|$|R

5|$|From about 1493 until 1525 the {{architect}} {{appears to have}} been Seth Derwall, succeeded by George Derwall until 1537. Seth Derwall completed the south transept to a Perpendicular Gothic design, as seen in the transomed windows of the clerestory. He also built the central tower, southwest <b>porch</b> <b>and</b> cloisters. Work commenced on the south west tower in 1508, but it had not risen above the roofline {{at the time of the}} dissolution of the monasteries, and has never been completed. The central tower, rising to , is a “lantern tower” with large windows letting light into the crossing. Its external appearance has been altered by the addition of four battlemented turrets by George Gilbert Scott in the 19thcentury.|$|E
5|$|In 1904, {{the station}} {{building}} was expanded with a <b>porch</b> <b>and</b> additional waiting room. From 1938 to 2000, train services {{were provided by}} the Nederlandse Spoorwegen (Netherlands Railways), when the Maatschappij tot Exploitatie van Staatsspoorwegen merged with the Hollandsche IJzeren Spoorweg-Maatschappij (Hollandic Iron Railroad Company). In 1942, during the German occupation of the Netherlands in World War II, approximately 500 Jews from Winschoten were transported by train to the Westerbork transit camp {{and from there to}} Nazi concentration camps in Germany and Poland, where 446 of them were killed. As a result of the war, the German border at the railway was closed for passenger transport from 1944 to 1954. In 1967, the roofed bus station was built next to the station building. In {{the last quarter of the}} 20th century, the station building's porch was replaced.|$|E
5|$|Opposite the entrance, {{and running}} across {{the middle of the}} court, was the great hall of the castle, with a grand <b>porch</b> <b>and</b> steps leading up to the first floor, where prestigious guests would have been entertained amongst carved wall-panels and murals. The design of the hall may have {{emulated}} Gaunt's hall at Kenilworth; at the very least, it was a powerful symbol of Thomas's authority and status. The west side of the inner court included the castle kitchen, bakery, well and other service facilities; on the east side was the lord's great chamber and a range of other accommodation for other guests. Behind the great hall was a smaller courtyard or garden. Thomas appears to have built up his new castle in stages, with the curtain wall being built first, with the corner towers added afterwards.|$|E

5|$|Parsons {{was anxious}} {{to learn about the}} {{condition}} of his family and property at Wappocomo; he also needed an additional change of clothing and a blanket. Accompanied by Lieutenant Blue and Adam Parrish, he traveled west along the Northwestern Turnpike to around Pleasant Dale, then followed a series of roads and paths until nighttime, when they reached Sugar Hollow two miles north of Romney. Parsons stayed behind in the hollow, while Blue and Parrish started out for Wappocomo to retrieve a set of Parsons' clothes. Knowing that the Union Army kept a 24-hour guard at the main house, Blue circled around {{to the rear of the}} mansion and knocked on the window of his uncle, Garrett W. Blue, who was residing with the Parsons family. Garrett Blue warned his nephew about the Union Army soldiers possibly stationed on the home's front <b>porch,</b> <b>and</b> he subsequently fetched Parsons' daughter, Kate, who provided Lt. Blue with a parcel for her father.|$|E
5|$|The Great Hall {{was built}} in the mid-15th century, and in the early 16th century the {{entrance}} <b>porch</b> <b>and</b> oriel room was added to {{the eastern side of the}} hall, and the great parlour and little parlour to the south of the hall, with bedrooms above. Sometime after the Lyte family sold the Manor in 1755, tenants moved in and the house gradually fell into disrepair. In 1810 it was reported by a neighbour that the north range 'had lately been destroyed and a farm house built on the site', (this north range is dated by architectural historians to the late 18th century) and by the time John Buckler came to draw the house in 1835 the west range had also disappeared.|$|E
5|$|The {{remaining}} part of {{the south}} nave, the oldest section of the present structure, dates from medieval times; the north doorway and tracery (patterns of stonework in the windows) point to the 14th century. In about 1500, the church was enlarged {{by the addition of}} a south <b>porch</b> <b>and</b> a second nave to the north. An arcade (row of arches) was constructed between the two naves. Enlargement by adding a second nave was not as common in Anglesey as elsewhere in Wales. Llanidan is one of three examples on the island; the others are St Beuno's, Aberffraw and St Cwyfan's, Llangwyfan). It is uncertain whether St Nidan's was enlarged because of a growth in the numbers attending the church or because of the generosity of a benefactor.|$|E
25|$|The {{entrance}} <b>porches</b> <b>and</b> doorways to {{each house}} are considered particularly impressive. The details differ slightly {{from house to}} house, but most have open-topped pediments, entablatures, semicircular fanlights and Tuscan-style pilasters.|$|R
50|$|The {{usable area}} of the cathedral is 2800 m2. The {{capacity}} exceeds 3,000 persons. The top of the main cross is 62 m above ground level. The cathedral includes the main altar {{in honor of the}} Transfiguration, the southern and northern altars, choirs, <b>and</b> the west <b>porch,</b> north <b>and</b> south <b>porches,</b> <b>and</b> the basement. The height of the iconostasis (icon wall) at the altar is 15 m.|$|R
