40|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown that a single {{injection}} of endotoxin inhibits renal cortical fibrinolytic activity in the rabbit. This suggests that the initial injection of endotoxin may <b>prepare</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> generalized Shwartzman reaction by depletion of cortical fibrinolytic activity. A fibrin slide technic was used to determine whether Thorotrast® and cortisone <b>prepare</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> generalized Schwartzman reaction by a similar mechanism. Renal cortical fibrinolytic activity was inhibited following Thorotrast injection, but no inhibition could be detected following cortisone injection. This suggests that Thorotrast, like endotoxin, <b>prepares</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> generalized Shwartzman reaction by depletion of cortical fibrinolytic activity. Failure to demonstrate inhibition of lytic activity following cortisone injection may indicate that cortisone <b>prepares</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> generalized Shwartzman reaction by another mechanism, or that the fibrin slide technic was unable to detect quantitative changes in lytic activity...|$|R
