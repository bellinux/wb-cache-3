5|$|One of {{the private}} {{investigators}} was David Edgar, a retired detective inspector, hired {{on the recommendation of}} the head of Manchester's Serious Crime Squad. Edgar released an e-fit in August 2009 of a woman said to have asked two British men in Barcelona, Spain, shortly after the disappearance, whether they were there to deliver her new daughter. Other private initiatives included a Portuguese lawyer financing the search of a reservoir near <b>Praia</b> da Luz in February 2008, and the use of ground radar by a South African property developer, Stephen Birch, who said in 2012 that scans showed there were bones beneath the driveway of a house in <b>Praia</b> da Luz.|$|E

5|$|In June 2016 Operation Grange {{officers}} {{interviewed a}} victim of the deceased broadcaster Clement Freud, who was accused that year of having a history of child sexual abuse. Freud had had a home in <b>Praia</b> da Luz, and had befriended the McCanns in July 2007, weeks after the disappearance. His family said he was in the UK when Madeleine went missing.|$|E
5|$|A {{man from}} Northern Ireland was {{discussed}} in the media {{in connection with the}} disappearance. After being released from prison for the sexual assault of his four daughters, he had moved to Carvoeiro, Portugal, not far from <b>Praia</b> da Luz, and was there when Madeleine went missing. He died in 2013. Another focus of Operation Grange was Urs Hans von Aesch, a deceased Swiss man implicated in the 2007 murder, in Switzerland, of five-year-old Ylenia Lenhard. Ylenia disappeared on 31 July 2007, nearly three months after Madeleine, and was found dead in September as a result of toluene poisoning. Von Aesch was living in Spain when Madeleine disappeared.|$|E
5|$|The {{pre-season}} {{began on}} 4 July 2005 with medical exams, {{followed by the}} first training session on the next day, with two thousand supporters present at the Estádio da Luz.

5|$|A {{tropical}} storm warning was issued for Cape Verde upon the storm's formation, {{as well as}} a hurricane watch in light of forecasts of additional intensification. When Fred showed definitive signs of strengthening, the alerts were replaced by a hurricane warning, marking the first occasion of a hurricane-level notice in the nation's history. On the morning of August31, TACV Cabo Verde Airlines suspended its flights from the capital of <b>Praia</b> to Dakar; all operations at the airports of Boa Vista, Sal, and São Vicente were halted soon after squalls began to spread across the islands. Officials urged shipping interests on all islands to secure their vessels and remain in port. A national music festival was canceled in Porto Novo, on the northernmost island of Santo Antão.|$|E
5|$|Amaral {{was himself}} an arguido in {{relation}} to his investigation of another case, the disappearance of Joana Cipriano. One day after Madeleine's disappearance, Amaral was made arguido, and a month later {{he was charged with}} making a false statement. Four other officers were charged with assault. Eight-year-old Joana had vanished in 2004 from Figueira, seven miles (11km) from <b>Praia</b> da Luz. Her body was never found, and no murder weapon was identified. Her mother and the mother's brother were convicted of her murder after confessing, but the mother retracted her confession, saying she had been beaten by police. Amaral was not present when the beating is alleged to have taken place, but he was accused of having covered up for others. The other detectives were acquitted. Amaral was convicted of perjury in May 2009 and received an 18-month suspended sentence.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} days of the inquiry, the Portuguese police searched through images seized from {{paedophile}} investigations, and Madeleine's parents were shown photographs of sex offenders in case they recognized them from <b>Praia</b> de Luz. Several British paedophiles were of interest. In May 2009 investigators working for the McCanns tried to question one, Raymond Hewlett; he had allegedly told someone he knew what happened to Madeleine, but he retracted and died of cancer in Germany in December that year. Scotland Yard made inquiries about two paedophiles who have been in jail in Scotland since 2010 for murder. The men were running a window-cleaning service in the Canary Islands when Madeleine went missing.|$|E

5|$|Nani {{was born}} on 17 November 1986 in <b>Praia,</b> the capital of Cape Verde, off the West African coast. Nani emigrated {{with his family to}} Portugal at an early age. He was raised by his aunt Antónia in the Santa Filomena estate in the Amadora {{district}} of Lisbon after being abandoned by his parents. At age five, his father left for a holiday in Cape Verde but never returned, and when he was 12 years old, his mother left Portugal {{to start a new life}} in the Netherlands. Nani has nine siblings from his mother, of which he is the youngest, and five from his father. Nani gained his nickname from an elder sister at a young age.|$|E
5|$|On August 31, a large {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} {{the west coast}} of Africa. A tropical system along the wave axis contained a low pressure area as well as an impressive outflow pattern, though initially its convection was disorganized and limited. By September 1 a cyclonic circulation with a diameter of 690miles (1115km) was evident on satellite imagery, well to the southeast of the Cape Verde Islands. Several hurricane forecast models anticipated development and strengthening. As it tracked quickly westward, the convection organized and developed into rainbands– bands of showers and thunderstorms that spiral cyclonically toward the storm center– and late on September 1 meteorologists began tracking the system using the Dvorak technique. Low amounts of wind shear and favorable outflow allowed vigorous deep convection to develop and persist near the center, and by 1800UTC on September 2 the system developed into Tropical Depression Nine about 450miles (730km) southwest of <b>Praia,</b> Cape Verde.|$|E
5|$|On August14, 2015, a {{well-defined}} tropical wave, accompanied by significant surface pressure falls, traversed Western Africa and emerged over the Atlantic Ocean that evening. A broad surface low developed along the wave on August15. Embedded within monsoon flow, various environmental factors enabled gradual {{development of the}} disturbance, including low wind shear, above-average sea surface temperatures, moderate moisture content, and favorable diffluence. A subtropical ridge to the north steered the system generally west-northwest throughout its entire existence. On August17, the surface low became increasingly defined and convection more persistent. It subsequently acquired enough organization to be classified a tropical depression—the fourth of the 2015season—at 06:00UTC on August18. At this time, it was situated about 825mi (1,325km) west-southwest of <b>Praia,</b> Cape Verde.|$|E

5|$|Scotland Yard issued another {{appeal in}} March 2014 for {{information}} {{about a man who}} had entered holiday homes occupied by British families in four incidents in the western Algarve between 2004 and 2006, two of them in <b>Praia</b> da Luz. On those occasions he sexually assaulted five white girls, aged 7–10, in their beds. The man spoke English with a foreign accent and his speech was slow and perhaps slurred. He had short, dark, unkempt hair, tanned skin, and in the view of three victims a distinctive smell; he may have worn a long-sleeved burgundy top, perhaps with a white circle on the back. These were among 12 incidents in the area between 2004 and 2010. The Polícia Judiciária reportedly believed the intruder in the four incidents between 2004 and 2006 was Euclides Monteiro, the former Ocean Club employee from Cape Verde who died in 2009.|$|E
5|$|The Tapas Seven {{were interviewed}} by Leicestershire police in England in April 2008, with the Polícia Judiciária in attendance. The Polícia Judiciária planned the {{following}} month to hold a reconstruction in <b>Praia</b> da Luz, using the McCanns and Tapas Seven rather than actors, but the Tapas Seven declined to participate. The poor relationship between the McCanns and Portuguese police was evident again that month when, {{on the day the}} couple were at the European Parliament to promote a monitoring system for missing children, transcripts of their interviews with the Polícia Judiciária were leaked to Spanish television. The national director of the Polícia Judiciária, Alípio Ribeiro, resigned not long after this, citing media pressure from the investigation; he had publicly said the police had been hasty in naming the McCanns as suspects. As of May 2008 Portuguese prosecutors were examining several charges against the McCanns, including child abandonment, abduction, homicide and concealment of a corpse.|$|E
5|$|After {{taking on}} {{supplies}} at Las Palmas, Lucas sailed to <b>Praia</b> on Cape Verde, before continuing south on 29 May {{in the direction}} of the Brazilian coast, hoping to profit from favourable winds and currents. In fact, due to persistent calms, a position off the Brazilian shore was only reached on 27 June. Because of the delay, Lucas decided not to supply himself but to sail directly to the Cape. Because Lucas made no stops on his journey between Cape Verde and the Cape, the fact that his voyage took far longer than a journey of this distance should have taken has surprised several authors. Historian C. Northcote Parkinson ascribed the delay, at least partially, to the poor quality of seamanship among Lucas's crews. The Batavian expeditionary force did not speak to another vessel during this time and thus had no information regarding British dispositions when it eventually reached the Cape on 26 July. They first reconnoitred Saldanha Bay, then Table Bay to the south, and eventually on 6 August they anchored in Saldanha Bay.|$|E

5|$|After the {{resignation}} of the last Liberal Cabinet, PedroII invited the rival Conservative Party to form a new cabinet. With his party no longer in control, Paranhos lost much of his influence. The Liberal Party was not willing to accept its loss of power. The most radical faction of the Liberals in the province of Pernambuco, known as the Partido da <b>Praia</b> ("Party of the Beach"), openly advocated a rebellion. Nominally Liberal, the praieiros were associated with the Courtier Faction. The proposed rebellion would be an attempt of this branch of the Courtier Faction to regain control of the government. The praieiros had little support, and public opinion was also against them. The group was unable to convince {{the vast majority of the}} population that a revolt would bring them any benefits. On 2 February 1849, the limited uprising of the praieiros was completely defeated after attacking Recife, the capital of Pernambuco. Even though Paranhos had condemned it, the Praiera rebellion, combined with the downfalls of his patron and the Liberal Party, made a continued political career impossible. He turned his focus once again to his work in journalism.|$|E
5|$|Although {{tropical}} cyclones in {{the extreme}} eastern Atlantic are typically propelled westward by high pressures from a subtropical ridge, this depression took an atypical northwestward path along a breach in the ridge from a previous disturbance. Its cyclonic structure steadily improved as a sharply curved rainband, resembling the precursor to an eye, tightened around the center. At 06:00UTC on August30, the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Fred 390mi (625km) east-southeast of <b>Praia,</b> Cape Verdeamong the four easternmost locations for a tropical storm to form since modern record-keeping began in 1851. A steady trend of intensification ensued while Fred moved through a region with ample tropical moisture, light upper winds, and above-average sea surface temperatures. The storm developed a thick, circular central dense overcast with good outflow, and the eye feature became well established {{at all levels of}} the circulation. Based on these characteristics, as well as satellite intensity estimates of 75mph (120km/h) winds, Fred was upgraded to a Category1 hurricane at 00:00UTC, August31. Then centered 165mi (270km) east-southeast of Sal, Cape Verde, it became the easternmost tropical cyclone ever to attain hurricane status in the tropical Atlantic.|$|E
5|$|On August26, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) began {{monitoring}} {{a tropical}} wave between the western coast of Africa and the Cape Verde Islands. Later that day, a low-level circulation center formed beneath the wave and began strengthening. Convective activity {{associated with the}} low became increasingly organized, and at around 1200UTC on August27, the NHC classified the system as Tropical Depression Thirteen; at the time, it was located approximately 255miles (410kilometres) south-southeast of <b>Praia,</b> Cape Verde. Operationally, the NHC did not begin to issue advisories on the depression until 2100UTC on August28. Tracking nearly due west {{in response to an}} anticyclone to the north and an area of moderate wind shear, the depression was forecast to slowly strengthen over the next several days. Early on August29, satellite intensity estimates of maximum sustained winds within the depression reached 40mph (65km/h), indicating that it had intensified into a tropical storm. At this time, the NHC assigned the name Luis to the system. Gradual strengthening took place throughout August29 as Luis tracked towards the west-northwest. Increased wind shear displaced convection from the center of circulation, preventing further intensification.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigated}} if {{the differences}} in density and nematode communities of intertidal sediments from two Brazilian sheltered sandy beaches were related to environmental characteristics. The upper tide level (UTL) and the low tide level (LTL) of both beaches were surveyed in January (austral summer) and June 2001 (austral winter) during low-spring tides, by collecting samples of nematodes and sediments. Differences in density between beaches, tidal level and seasons, and nematode community structure were investigated. Sediments from both beaches were composed of medium to very coarse sand. The highest nematode densities were found at the UTL, and significant differences between beaches, tidal levels and months were found. A total of 54 genera were found and the genera composition on both sheltered beaches was similar to other exposed worldwide sandy beaches. The density {{and structure of the}} nematode community at both beaches clearly varied along the spatial and temporal scales. Gravel percentage was the most important variable explaining the spatial distribution of the nematodes, determining the four sub-communities; this suggests that the sediment characteristics influence the nematode community, rather than physical hydrodynamic forces. Temperature and salinity were suggested to be important variables affecting the temporal variation. Foi investigado se a diferen&# 231;a entre a densidade e a comunidade de nemat&# 243;deos dos sedimentos entre-mar&# 233;s de duas <b>praias</b> arenosas protegidas no Brasil estava relacionada com caracter&# 237;sticas ambientais. Durante as mar&# 233;s de siz&# 237;gia de janeiro (ver&# 227;o austral) e junho (inverno austral) de 2001, amostras de sedimentos e nemat&# 243;deos foram coletadas no m&# 233;dio litoral superior (UTL) e o m&# 233;dio litoral inferior (LTL).
