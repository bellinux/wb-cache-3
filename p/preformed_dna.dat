40|$|AbstractThe yeast Sir 2 / 3 / 4 p {{complex is}} found in {{abundance}} at telomeres, where it participates {{in the formation of}} silent heterochromatin and telomere maintenance. Here, we show that Sir 3 p is released from telomeres in response to DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), binds to DSBs, and mediates their repair, independent of cell mating type. Sir 3 p relocalization is S phase specific and, importantly, requires the DNA damage checkpoint genes MEC 1 and RAD 9. MEC 1 is a homolog of ATM, mutations in which cause ataxia telangiectasia (A-T), a disease characterized by various neurologic and immunologic abnormalities, a predisposition for cancer, and a cellular defect in repair of DSBs. This novel mode by which <b>preformed</b> <b>DNA</b> repair machinery is mobilized by DNA damage sensors may have implications for human diseases resulting from defective DSB repair...|$|E
40|$|Use of {{metabolic}} inhibitors {{provides an}} effective {{approach to the}} study of metabolic requirements of virus reproduction (1). In the area of nucleic acid metabolism {{it has been shown that}} inhibition of host deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) synthesis does not inhibit the multiplication of Newcastle disease (2 - 4) or poliomyelitis virus (2). Thus, host DNA synthesis is apparently not required for the production of several ribonucleic acid (RNA) -containing viruses; whether <b>preformed</b> <b>DNA</b> is necessary is not known. The present study is concerned with the question whether host RNA plays a role in the reproduction of DNA-containing viruses. This question was explored with the aid of 5, 6 -dichloro- 1 -/ 3 -~ribofuranosylbenzimidazole (DRB) 1 and with ribonuclease (RNase). In this communication the inhibitory effects of DRB on adenosine- 8 -C n uptake into cell RNA, on C 14 -L-alanine uptake into cell proteins, and on cellular oxygen consumption are described. Blocking of the inhibitory effect of DRB on influenza virus multiplication by adenosine will be reported. I...|$|E
40|$|Glucocorticoid hormone {{is shown}} to {{markedly}} suppress DNA synthesis {{in a line of}} rat hepatoma cells in vitro. In the presence of 300 nM hydrocortisone or 30 nM dexamethasone the incorporation of radioactive thymidine falls to 50 % of control levels by 36 hr, and at higher concentrations of hormone inhibition can be noted as early as 12 hr and is nearly complete by 24 hr. This inhibition of radioactive thymidine incorporation reflects a true suppression of DNA synthesis, is accompanied by a corresponding inhibition of cell proliferation, and is readily reversible upon subsequent removal of hormone. In contrast to previously described effects of the glucocorticoid hormones on various cells of lymphoid origin, the inhibition of DNA synthesis in these hepatoma cells is not accompanied by appreciable cell lysis or by degradation of <b>preformed</b> <b>DNA,</b> and even when [3 H]thymidine incorporation into DNA is inhibited by 90 % or more, incorporation of [14 C]uridine into RNA proceeds with little change. These findings all parallel previous observations on the effects of glucocorticoid hormone on the livers of intact animals and suggest that studies on the mechanism of the inhibition of DNA synthesis in the present more isolated system may lead {{to a better understanding of}} the means by which these compounds inhibit liver growth in vivo...|$|E
40|$|Ligand-induced {{stabilization}} of G-quadruplex structures {{formed by the}} human telomeric DNA is an active area of research. The compounds which stabilize the G-quadruplexes often lead to telomerase inhibition. Herein we present the results of interaction of new monomeric and dimeric ligands having 1, 3 -phenylene-bis(piperazinyl benzimidazole) unit with G-quadruplex DNA (G 4 DNA) formed by human telomeric repeat d(G(3) T(2) A) (3) G(3) ]. These ligands efficiently stabilize the <b>preformed</b> G 4 <b>DNA</b> {{in the presence of}} 100 mM monovalent alkali metal ions. Also, the G 4 DNA formed in the presence of low concentrations of ligands in 100 mM K+ adopts a highly stable parallel-stranded conformation. The G-quadruplexes formed {{in the presence of the}} dimeric compound are more stable than that induced by the corresponding monomeric counterpart. The dimeric ligands having oligo-oxyethylene spacers provide much higher stability to the <b>preformed</b> G 4 <b>DNA</b> and also exert significantly higher telomerase inhibition activity. Computational aspects have also been discussed...|$|R

40|$|The {{synthesis}} of polyoma DNA was studied in isolated nuclei from hydroxyurea-inhibited 3 T 6 cells infected with polyoma virus. During incubation of nuclei under conditions suitable for polyoma DNA synthesis in vitro, the short DNA fragments with a sedimentation coefficient of 4 S formed in vivo (hydroxyurea fragments) became associated with <b>preformed,</b> replicating <b>DNA</b> strands. Centrifugation in dye-buoyant density gradients {{showed that the}} fragments formed part {{of the structure of}} the replicative intermediate of polyoma DNA. The proportion of “young” replicative intermediates was larger after hydroxyurea inhibition than in uninhibited controls. Hydroxyurea fragments appear to be closely related to the 4 S fragments formed as normal intermediates during discontinuous {{synthesis of}} polyoma DNA...|$|R
40|$|NF-Y is a CCAAT-binding trimer {{with two}} histonic subunits, NF-YB and NF-YC, {{resembling}} H 2 A-H 2 B. We previously {{showed that the}} short conserved domains of NF-Y efficiently bind to the major histocompatibility complex class II Ea Y box in DNA nucleosomized with purified chicken histones. Using wild-type NF-Y and recombinant histones, we find that NF-Y associates with H 3 -H 4 early during nucleosome assembly, under conditions in which binding to naked DNA is not observed. In such assays, the NF-YB–NF-YC dimer forms complexes with H 3 -H 4, for whose formation the CCAAT box is not required. We investigated whether they represent octamer-like structures, using DNase I, micrococcal nuclease, and exonuclease III, and found a highly positioned nucleosome on Ea, whose boundaries were mapped; addition of NF-YB–NF-YC {{does not lead to}} the formation of octameric structures, but changes in the digestion patterns are observed. NF-YA can bind to such <b>preformed</b> <b>DNA</b> complexes in a CCAAT-dependent way. In the absence of DNA, NF-YB–NF-YC subunits bind to H 3 -H 4, but not to H 2 A-H 2 B, through the NF-YB histone fold. These results indicate that (i) the NF-Y histone fold dimer can efficiently associate DNA during nucleosome formation; (ii) it has an intrinsic affinity for H 3 -H 4 but does not form octamers; and (iii) the interactions between NF-YA, NF-YB–NF-YC, and H 3 -H 4 or nucleosomes are not mutually exclusive. Thus, NF-Y can intervene at different steps during nucleosome formation, and this scenario might be paradigmatic for other histone fold proteins involved in gene regulation...|$|E
40|$|DNA origami {{represents}} {{a class of}} highly programmable macromolecules. Their moderate mechanical rigidity allows them to undergo conformational changes in response to external signals. Such capability is promising for sensing and actuating applications at the nanoscale. In this work, we present our progress in understanding the mechanical properties of DNA origami by probing their structural reconfiguration kinetics. By fitting the evolution of species population into a set of chemical reaction equations and relating the kinetic rates to the mechanical rigidity of the DNA origami design, we determined the rigidity of DNA crossovers, an essential structural motif in DNA origami, for the first time. The results enable us to build a complete mechanical model that characterizes the dynamic behavior of a DNA origami model system. By {{taking advantage of the}} intrinsic flexibility of DNA, we demonstrated several new structural reconfiguration schemes. Single-layered DNA origami tiles are shown to cyclize and open up with high yield in response to the addition of linker and releaser DNA. Progressive fine-tuning of DNA origami structures are demonstrated by modulating their internal stress with the binding of chemical adducts. By enrolling photo-responsive molecules whose DNA binding affinity is switchable, photo-control over DNA origami conformation can be achieved conveniently. Direct DNA photo-damage by short and medium-wavelength UV light is also shown to affect DNA origami conformation by relieving internal stresses. Finally, a 2 ̆ 2 Lego 2 ̆ 2 approach is developed. By choosing the correct linkers, <b>preformed</b> <b>DNA</b> origami building-blocks are demonstrated to assemble into different supra-structures. Reversible assembly and reconfiguration are then demonstrated with such supra-structures. ...|$|E
40|$|DNA barcoding is a {{technique}} in which species identification is performed using universal DNA sequences from a small fragment of the genome (Lahaye et al. 2007). Biodiversity characterization/conservation {{would be one of}} the main benefits of the widespread application of barcoding, in terms of speed, low cost, reliability, and improved resolution power. In combination with scuba diving, it could become a useful complement for ecological and taxonomical assessments of aquatic vegetation. Here, this method was tested for the first time on plants inhabiting a wetland area. Our objective was to provide a test for future in situ application of DNA Barcodes by evaluating the efficacy of species discrimination under the criteria of methods and natural cooccurrence of the species in the ecosystem. After collecting and identifying ca. 40 specimens, DNA Barcoding was performed using the three most efficient markers (trnH-psbA, rbclA, rpoC 1) proposed by the Consortium for the Barcode Of Life (CBOL). Investigated plants were collected in the WWF protected wetland area “Lago di Alviano” which covers around 900 hectares of ecosystems important for migratory birds as well as many other animals and plants. Among the studied species, many are typically present in natural eutrophic lakes with Magnopotamion or Hydrocharition-type vegetation in Europe. Two of them are floating on the water, five are submerged, thirteen emerged or living very close to water and five sampled species are trees closely related to water habitats. Nine species are also widely used for phytoremediation. Finally, we <b>preformed</b> <b>DNA</b> Barcoding of Amorpha fructicosa, an invasive plant nowadays becoming a serious problem in European wetlands.

All three subunits of TFIIIB, TBP, Brf (the TFIIB-related subunit) and B", {{are required for}} transcription of supercoiled and linear duplex DNA, but we show here that B" is non-essential on a promoter that has been partly pre-opened by unpairing a short segment of the transcription bubble. These findings expose a striking similarity between transcriptional initiation by pol II, pol III and bacterial RNA polymerases: a <b>preformed</b> single-stranded <b>DNA</b> bubble upstream of the transcriptional start removes the dependence of pol II on TFIIE, TFIIH and ATP hydrolysis, and the dependence of pol III on B"; the favored placement of the transcription bubble for B"-independent transcription by pol III overlaps a DNA segment that interacts sequence specifically as single-stranded DNA with the sigma(70) initiation subunit of Escherichia coli RNA polymerase holoenzyme...|$|R
40|$|Transcriptional {{activation}} {{often requires}} the rapid assembly of complexes between dimeric transcription factors and specific DNA sites. Here {{we show that}} members of the basic region leucine zipper and basic region helix–loop–helix zipper transcription factor families follow an assembly pathway in which two protein monomers bind DNA sequentially and form their dimerization interface while bound to DNA. Nonspecific protein or DNA competitors have little effect on the rate of assembly along this pathway, but slow a competing pathway in which <b>preformed</b> dimers bind <b>DNA.</b> The sequential monomer-binding pathway allows the protein to search for and locate a specific DNA site more quickly, resulting in greater specificity prior to equilibrium...|$|R
40|$|A tetramer of HIV- 1 {{integrase}} (IN) stably {{associates with}} the viral DNA ends {{to form a}} fully functional concerted integration intermediate. LEDGF/p 75, a key cellular binding partner of the lentiviral enzyme, also stabilizes a tetrameric form of IN. However, functional assays have indicated {{the importance of the}} order of viral DNA and LEDGF/ p 75 addition to IN for productive concerted integration. Here, we employed Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) to monitor assembly of indi-vidual IN subunits into tetramers in the presence of viral DNA and LEDGF/p 75. The IN–viral DNA and IN–LEDGF/p 75 complexes yielded significantly different FRET values suggesting two distinct IN conformations in these complexes. Furthermore, the order of addition experiments indicated that FRET for the <b>preformed</b> IN–viral <b>DNA</b> complex remained unchanged upon its subsequent binding to LEDGF/p 75, whereas pre-incubation of LEDGF/ p 75 and IN followed by addition of viral DNA yielded FRET very similar to the IN–LEDGF/p 75 complex. These findings provide new insights into the structural organization of IN subunits in func-tional concerted integration intermediates and suggest that differential multimerization of IN in the presence of various ligands could be exploited as a plausible therapeutic target for development of allosteric inhibitors...|$|R
40|$|Alkaline sucrose {{sedimentation}} {{studies of}} DNA from mouse lymphoma cells (L 5178 Y) treated with caffeine {{have demonstrated the}} following effects. Caffeine (at a concentration of 1. 6 mM) does not introduce strand breaks into <b>preformed</b> <b>DNA</b> nor does it inhibit the rejoining of γ-ray-induced strand breaks. Although it {{does not affect the}} over-all rate of DNA synthesis, pulse labeling experiments show that the DNA strands synthesized in its presence are smaller than those made in its absence. This could be the result of (a) DNA being made in shorter replicating units or (b) small gaps in the daughter DNA strands within normal-sized replicating units. These two alternative models were indirectly distinguished as follows. After a pulse label with thymidine- 3 H in the presence of caffeine, cells were incubated without caffeine in bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd). During this incubation, growing strands are elongated and hypothetical gaps (model b) filled in with bromuracil (BrUra) -substituted DNA. The BrUra-containing DNA segments will now be of different lengths on the two models. With smaller replicating units (a) the “elongation segments” will be somewhat smaller than but the same order of magnitude as those in untreated cells, whereas with small gaps (b) the “filled-in gap segments” would be expected to be at least an order of magnitude smaller. The BrUra-containing regions of DNA can be selectively broken open by exposing the cells to light at 313 nm. The exposure required to break open the BUra-substituted regions is inversely related to, and hence gives a measure of, the size of these regions. In caffeine-treated cells these regions were found to be somewhat smaller than but of comparable size with those in untreated cells; {{this is consistent with the}} DNA being synthesized in smaller units and argues against the presence of small gaps in the daughter strands...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{demonstrates}} bottom-up {{fabrication of}} a fully addressable non-repetitive network on the nanometer scale, assembled by synthetic DNA molecules. Each side constitutes a unique sequence of 10 bases, i. e. 3. 4 nm in length, {{and can be}} considered the smallest practical unit of DNA in a nanotechnological context. Working with units of this length scale ensures a system fit for non-mundane molecular nanotechnology. The thesis features a progressive growth of the nanostructure, from {{the formation of the}} single-ringed hexagonal unit-cell to an asymmetric four-ring network of 17 nodes. Each structure is formed in a one-step self-assembly reaction. Alongside construction of the DNA-based nanostructural template, the thesis also illustrates three different aspects of functionalization. Firstly, a fixation strategy infusing stability in the delicate network by chemical ligation. The click chemistry based strategy will pave the way for modular build-up of larger nanostructures. Results show that multiple site-specific click reactions can perform simultaneously and independently of each other on a hybridized DNA template. Fixated modules are resistant to denaturing agent and can be freeze-dried. The second important aspect is incorporation of these DNA nanoconstructs onto lipid bilayers, for development of soft-surface nanotechnology. This creates controllable new interfaces in an aspiration towards membrane-integrated applications, e. g. mimicking a photosynthetic reaction centre. This thesis features two different molecular anchors: a multi-functional porphyrin moiety and a more universal lipid anchor. Both anchors are shown to align a DNA nanostructure with the membrane surface, a conformational arrangement that also depends on position of anchoring points. The last theme of this thesis is triplex recognition as a method for site-specific functionalization of <b>preformed</b> <b>DNA</b> nanostructures. The specific function of energy transfer is demonstrated in a simple photonic device, which can be switched ON and OFF by slight adjustment of pH. This DNA-based nanoscopic system is envisioned as a platform for high-precision control over molecular processes towards nanotechnological applications. It is part of an ambition in molecular nanoscience to fabricate systems from the bottom-up, based on principles of self-assembly and with functional complexity on levels not achievable by a conventional top-down perspective to nanoscience. The great leap of molecular nanoscience stems from inspiration of biological systems. New advancement in technological progress is possible by harvesting benefits of Darwinian evolution...|$|E
40|$|Replication of the streptococcal plasmid pIP 501 is {{regulated}} by two components, CopR and the antisense RNA, RNAIII. CopR represses transcription {{of the essential}} repR mRNA about 10 - to 20 -fold and, additionally, prevents convergent transcription of sense and antisense RNAs. It has been demonstrated that CopR binds as a <b>preformed</b> dimer. <b>DNA</b> binding and dimerization constants were determined and amino acids were identified {{that are involved in}} DNA binding and dimerization. It was demonstrated that the C-terminal 20 aa of CopR are not involved in either activity, but play an important role for CopR stability. Furthermore, {{it was found that the}} C terminus of CopR is structured containing a b-strand structure, most probably between the alternating hydrophilic and hydrophobic amino acids 76 and 84 (QVTLELEME). In this study stability motifs within the C terminus of CopR were dissected. Both the cognate and a heterologous (QVTVTVTVT) b-strand structure between amino acids 76 and 84 within the C terminus stabilized CopR (CopR derivative CopVT). In contrast, substitution by a predicted a-helix (QVTLKLKMK) or a predicted unstructured sequence (QVTPEPEPE) caused severe and moderate destabilization, respectively. E 80 seemed to be the only important C-terminal glutamic acid residue. Deletion of seven C-terminal amino acids from either wild-type CopR or CopVT reduced the half-life to C 50 % indicating that this C-terminal sequence is a second stability motif...|$|R
40|$|Replication of the thermosensitive drug {{resistance}} factor Rts 1 was {{studied at the}} nonpermissive temperature (42 degrees C). It was concluded from the following observations that replication of this plasmid takes place at 42 degrees C without involving the covalently closed circular (CCC) form of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). (i) DNA-DNA- reassociation kinetics studies with purified Rts 1 DNA showed that Rts 1 DNA increased several-fold during cell growth at 42 degrees C while very little, if any, CCC DNA was synthesized. (ii) When Escherichia coli 20 S 0 (Rts 1) was labeled with [3 H]thymidine at 42 degrees C, {{a significant amount of}} radioactive DNA hybridizable to Rts 1 DNA was formed. This DNA was found in a fraction where DNA other than CCC DNA was expected in alkaline sucrose density gradient centrifugation analysis. When E. coli 20 S 0 (Rts 1) was labeled at 32 degrees C, the labeled CCC DNA did not disappear during a chase period at 42 degrees C. This indicates that <b>preformed</b> CCC <b>DNA</b> does not participate in replication at the nonpermissive temperature. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that there are two modes of replication of Rts 1 DNA, one involving a CCC molecule and the other not involving this form, and that only the latter mode takes place at the nonpermissive temperature...|$|R
40|$|Achieving {{stabilization}} of telomeric DNA in G-quadruplex conformation by Various organic compounds {{has been an}} important goal for the medicinal chemists seeking to develop new anticancer agents. Several compounds are known to stabilize G-quadruplexes. However, relatively few are known to induce their formation and/or alter the topology, of the <b>preformed</b> quadruplex <b>DNA.</b> Herein, four compounds having the 1, 3 -phenylene-bis(piperazinyl benzimidazole) unit as a basic skeleton have been synthesized, and their interactions with the 24 -mer telomeric DNA sequences from Tetrahymena thermophilia d(T(2) G(4)) (4) have been investigated using high-resolution techniques Such as circular dichroism (CD) spectropolarimetry, CD melting, emission spectroscopy, and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The data obtained, in the presence of one of three ions (Li+, Na+, or K+), indicate that all the new compounds have a high affinity for G-quadruplex DNA, and the strength of the binding with G-quadruplex depends on (1) phenyl ring substitution, (ii) the piperazinyl side chain, and (iii) the type of monovalent cation present in the buffer. Results further Suggest that these compounds are able to abet the conversion of the Intramolecular quadruplex into parallel stranded intermolecular G-quadruplex DNA. Notably, these compounds are also capable of inducing and stabilizing the parallel stranded quadruplex from randomly structured DNA {{in the absence of any}} stabilizing cation. The kinetics of the structural changes Induced by these compounds could be followed by recording the changes in the CD signal as a function of time. The implications of the findings mentioned above are discussed in this paper...|$|R

The total value of the power of exclusion (PE) and the random match probability (MP) were respectively 0. 99999988 and 5. 2 × 10 – 18. Therefore the polymorphism of examined genetic markers within the Investigator HD-plex multiplex allows for a significant increase of the evidence value.

40|$|A {{system to}} study {{mismatch}} repair in vitro in HeLa cell extracts was developed. <b>Preformed</b> heteroduplex plasmid <b>DNA</b> containing two single base pair mismatches within the SupF gene of Escherichia coli {{was used as}} a substrate in a mismatch repair assay. Repair of {{one or both of the}} mismatches to the wild-type sequence was measured by transformation of a lac(Am) E. coli strain in which the presence of an active supF gene could be scored. The E. coli strain used was constructed to carry mutations in genes associated with mismatch repair and recombination (mutH, mutU, and recA) so that the processing of the heteroduplex DNA by the bacterium was minimal. Extract reactions were carried out by the incubation of the heteroduplex plasmid DNA in the HeLa cell extracts to which ATP, creatine phosphate, creatine kinase, deoxynucleotides, and a magnesium-containing buffer were added. Under these conditions about 1 % of the mismatches were repaired. In the absence of added energy sources or deoxynucleotides, the activity in the extracts was significantly reduced. The addition of either aphidicolin or dideoxynucleotides reduced the mismatch repair activity, but only aphidicolin was effective in blocking DNA polymerization in the extracts. It is concluded that mismatch repair in these extracts is an energy-requiring process that is dependent on an adequate deoxynucleotide concentration. The results also indicate that the process is associated with some type of DNA polymerization, but the different effects of aphidicolin and dideoxynucleotides suggest that the mismatch repair activity in the extracts cannot simply be accounted for by random nick-translation activity alone...|$|R
40|$|DIM (3, 3 �-di-indolylmethane), an {{abundant}} dietary component of cruciferous vegetables, exhibits {{a wide spectrum}} of pharmacological properties. In the present study, we show that DIM is a potent inhibitor of Leishmania donovani topoisomerase I with an IC 50 of 1. 2 μM. Equilibrium dialysis shows that DIM binds strongly to the free enzyme with a binding constant of 9. 73 × 10 − 9 M. The binding affinity of DIM to the small subunit is 8. 6 -fold more than that of the large subunit of unusual LdTOP 1 LS (bi-subunit L. donovani topoisomerase I). DIM stabilizes topoisomerase I–DNA cleavage complexes in vitro and also in vivo. Like CPT (camptothecin), DIM inhibits the religation step when the drug was added to <b>preformed</b> topoisomerase I– <b>DNA</b> binary complex. Hence, DIM is similar to CPT with respect to its ability to form the topoisomerase I-mediated ‘cleavable complexes’ in vitro and in vivo. But unlike CPT, DIM interacts with both free enzyme and substrate DNA. Therefore DIM is non-competitive class I inhibitor of topoisomerase I. DIM also inhibits the relaxation activity of the CPT-resistant mutant enzyme LdTOP 1 � 39 LS (N-terminal deletion of amino acids 1 – 39 of LdTOP 1 LS). The IC 50 values of DIM in simultaneous and enzyme pre-incubation relaxation assays were 3. 6 and 2. 9 μM respectively, which are higher than that of wild-type topoisomerase I (LdTOP 1 LS), indicating that the affinity of DIM to LdTOP 1 � 39 LS is less than that for LdTOP 1 LS. This is the first report on DIM as an L. donovani topoisomerase I poison. Our study illuminates a new mode of action of enzyme inhibition by DIM that might be exploited for rational drug design in human leishmaniasis...|$|R
40|$|The E 1 helicase of papillomaviruses is {{required}} for replication of the viral double-stranded DNA genome, in conjunction with cellular factors. DNA replication is initiated at the viral origin by the assembly of E 1 monomers into oligomeric complexes that have unwinding activity. In vivo, this process is catalyzed by the viral E 2 protein, which recruits E 1 specifically at the origin. For bovine papillomavirus (BPV) E 1 a minimal DNA-binding domain (DBD) has been identified N-terminal to the enzymatic domain. In this study, we characterized the DBD of human papillomavirus 11 (HPV 11), HPV 18, and BPV E 1 using a quantitative DNA binding assay based on fluorescence anisotropy. We found that the HPV 11 DBD binds DNA with an affinity and sequence requirement {{comparable to those of}} the analogous domain of BPV but that the HPV 18 DBD has a higher affinity for nonspecific DNA. By comparing the DNA-binding properties of a dimerization-defective protein to those of the wild type, we provide evidence that dimerization of the HPV 11 DBD occurs only on two appropriately positioned E 1 binding-sites and contributes approximately a 10 -fold increase in binding affinity. In contrast, the HPV 11 E 1 helicase purified as <b>preformed</b> hexamers binds <b>DNA</b> with little sequence specificity, similarly to a dimerization-defective DBD. Finally, we show that the amino acid substitution that prevents dimerization reduces the ability of a longer E 1 protein to bind to the origin in vitro and to support transient HPV DNA replication in vivo, but has little effect on its ATPase activity or ability to oligomerize into hexamers. These results are discussed in light of a model of the assembly of replication-competent double hexameric E 1 complexes at the origin...|$|R
40|$|The present {{dissertation}} {{deals with}} the fabrication of one-dimensional nanostructures based on DNA templates. The aim hereby {{is the development of}} novel, conducting, DNA-based materials, which may at the end allow the programmable assembly of DNA-based electronic nanostructures, like nanoswitches and conductive nanowires. DNA is a suitable template because of its one-dimensional structure and its extraordinary self recognition properties. Due to the sequence of base pairs and the possibility to direct this sequence by modern methods for the synthesis of DNA the template is furthermore to a certain degree programmable. The multitude of binding sites at the DNA bases and the charged backbone as well as the possibility to incorporate artificial bases instead of the natural ones allows a modification of DNA with metal ions and nanoparticles. For the synthesis of the one-dimensional nanostructures presented in this work native DNA strands as well as artificially synthesized DNA duplexes were utilized. Two main strategies for the metallization are described: the immobilization of <b>preformed</b> nanoparticles to <b>DNA</b> templates and the continuous metallization of DNA strands for the generation of continuous metal nanowires. One approach investigated in this work is the immobilization of amine terminated Fe/Pt nanoparticles to neighbouring GC base pairs in native plasmid DNA via the DNA binding complex cisplatin. In this context, a variety of water soluble Fe/Pt particles stabilized by different amines were synthesized via a ligand exchange reaction and studied by means of transmission electron microscopy. The coupling of ethylenediamine stabilized Fe/Pt particles to native plasmid DNA with cisplatin could be shown by AFM. This method yielded partly decorated strands, due to a low selectivity for binding sites, and was therefore not investigated in detail. However, the versatile surface functionalization of the water soluble Fe/Pt nanoparticles in combination with the extraordinary magnetic properties of the material opens the opportunity of diverse biomedical applications. Spatially defined DNA-nanoparticle-assemblies could be obtained by immobilization of azide terminated Au nanoparticles to artificial DNA duplexes. Those DNA duplexes which were synthesized by PCR incorporate artificial alkyne labeled thymine and cytosine derivatives instead of the native bases within their sequence. The immobilization of azide terminated nanoparticles to the alkyne functionalized template could be accomplished via the Cu(I) -catalyzed Huisgen cycloaddition, the so called ‘click’ reaction. The azide functionalized Au particles were obtained by direct synthesis as well as by ligand exchange reactions in one- and two-phase systems. The resulting nanoparticles with sizes between 1 - 4 nm were characterized by means of AFM, TEM, UV/Vis, and ATR. After the reaction with the alkyne labeled templates, one-dimensional nanoparticle arrays could be obtained as proven in detailed TEM and AFM studies. It could be observed that the array consists of uniform nanoparticles with regular particle distance presumably caused by the space requirement of the ligand shell around the particles. A second main goal in this work was the generation of continuously metallized nanowires with tunable diameters. Therefore again alkyne labeled DNA duplexes were utilized which were reacted with a sugar azide in a further step to generate reductive groups {{on the surface of the}} strands. Incubation with Tollens solution yielded Ag nucleation sites on the DNA, which could be covered with a Ag or Au layer in a further step. The resulting structures could be characterized by means of AFM and SEM. In case of the bimetallic Ag/Au wires diameters of 10 nm and smaller could be obtained. In time dependent metallization experiments the metallization time could be identified as a size-defining variable. Furthermore, the Ag nanowires, which were synthesized according to a similar method, were characterized by means of SEM and EDX. The latter showed a diameter between 50 nm and 100 nm and could be used for electrical addressing with a nanomanipulator unit incorporated into the chamber of the SEM. A long-term objective emerging from this thesis will be the combination of both methods, the site specific continuous metallization of DNA and the spatially defined immobilization of preformed metal clusters on the DNA strand. The feasibility of both methods has been demonstrated here. In combination they give prospect to functional DNA-based devices generated by self-assembly processes in solution...|$|R
