6000|$|Frank H. Irwin, company E, 93rd Pennsylvania--died May 1, '65--My {{letter to}} his mother--Dear madam: No doubt you and Frank's friends have heard the sad fact of his death in {{hospital}} here, through his uncle, or the lady from Baltimore, who took his things. (I have not seen them, only heard of them visiting Frank.) I will write you a few lines--as a casual friend that sat by his death-bed. Your son, corporal Frank H. Irwin, was wounded near fort Fisher, Virginia, March 25th, 1865--the wound was in the left knee, pretty bad. He was sent up to Washington, was receiv'd in ward C, Armory-square hospital, March 28th--the wound became worse, and on the 4th of April the leg was amputated a little above the knee--the operation was perform' d by Dr. Bliss, {{one of the best}} surgeons in the army--he did the whole operation himself--there was a good deal of bad matter gather'd--the bullet was found in the knee. For a couple of weeks afterwards he was doing pretty well. I visited and sat by him frequently, as he was fond of having me. The last ten or twelve days of April I saw that his case was critical. He previously had some fever, with cold spells. The last week in April he was much of the time flighty--but always mild and gentle. He died first of May. The actual cause of death was <b>pyaemia,</b> (the absorption of the matter in the system instead of its discharge.) Frank, as far as I saw, had everything requisite in surgical treatment, nursing, &c. He had watches much of the time. He was so good and well-behaved and affectionate, I myself liked him very much. I was in the habit of coming in afternoons and sitting by him, and soothing him, and he liked to have me--liked to put his arm out and lay his hand on my knee--would keep it so a long while. Toward the last he was more restless and flighty at night--often fancied himself with his regiment--by his talk sometimes seem'd as if his feelings were hurt by being blamed by his officers for something he was entirely innocent of--said, [...] "I never in my life was thought capable of such a thing, and never was." [...] At other times he would fancy himself talking as it seem'd to children or such like, his relatives I suppose, and giving them good advice; would talk to them a long while. All the time he was out of his head not one single bad word or idea escaped him. It was remark'd that many a man's conversation in his senses was not half as good as Frank's delirium. He seem'd quite willing to die--he had become very weak and had suffer'd a good deal, and was perfectly resign'd, poor boy. I do not know his past life, but I feel as if it must have been good. At any rate what I saw of him here, under the most trying circumstances, with a painful wound, and among strangers, I can say that he behaved so brave, so composed, and so sweet and affectionate, it could not be surpass'd. And now like many other noble and good men, after serving his country as a soldier, he has yielded up his young life at the very outset in her service. Such things are gloomy--yet there is a text, [...] "God doeth all things well"--the meaning of which, after due time, appears to the soul.|$|E

50|$|The main coagulase-positive {{staphylococcus}} is Staphylococcus aureus, {{although not}} all strains of Staphylococcus aureus are coagulase positive. These bacteria can survive on dry surfaces, increasing the chance of transmission. S. aureus is also implicated in toxic shock syndrome; during the 1980s some tampons allowed {{the rapid growth of}} S. aureus, which released toxins that were absorbed into the bloodstream. Any S. aureus infection can cause the staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome, a cutaneous reaction to exotoxin absorbed into the bloodstream. It can also cause a type of septicaemia called <b>pyaemia.</b> The infection can be life-threatening. Problematically, Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has become a major cause of hospital-acquired infections, and is being, MRSA has also been recognized with increasing frequency in community-acquired infections.

5000|$|Borrelia {{bacteria}} are well described elsewhere {{in association with}} Ixodes ticks for causing Lyme disease in humans, but this disease also affects domestic dogs. Borrelia anserina is transmitted by Argas persicus to poultry, causing avian borreliosis in {{a wide spread of}} tropical and subtropical countries. [...] Anaplasma phagocytophilum (formerly Ehrlichia phagocytophila) is a bacterium of deer that spreads to sheep where it causes tick-borne fever in Europe, resulting in abortion by ewes and temporary sterility of rams. This bacterium invades and proliferates in neutrophil cells of the blood. This depletes these antibacterial cells and renders the host susceptible to opportunistic infections by Staphylococcus aureus bacteria which invade joints and cause the crippling disease of sheep called tick <b>pyaemia.</b> Anaplasma marginale infects marginal areas of red blood cells of cattle and causes anaplasmosis wherever boophilid ticks occur as transmitters. Anaplasma centrale tends to infect the central region of red blood cells, and is sufficiently closely related to An. marginale to have been used from long ago as a live vaccine to protect cattle against the more virulent An. marginale. Sheep and goats suffer disease from infection with Anaplasma ovis which is transmitted similarly to the anaplasmas described above. Ehrlichia ruminantium (formerly Cowdria ruminantium) is transmitted mainly by Amblyomma hebraeum and Am. variegatum in Africa, causing the severe disease heartwater in cattle, sheep, and goats. This disease is named after the prominent sign of pericardial edema. The bacteria infect the brain, causing prostration. Heartwater also occurs on the Caribbean islands, having spread there on shipments of cattle from Africa about 150 years ago, before anything was known of tick transmitted microbes. 11 ...|$|E
50|$|Unearthed in Frei-Laubersheim in 1872 was the Frei-Laubersheim fibula, a Frankish {{artefact}} {{bearing a}} partially legible runic inscription. It {{is believed to}} date from about the 6th century AD, and it represents proof that the Frei-Laubersheim area was settled in those days. In 767/768 and 771 - some two centuries later - Frei-Laubersheim had its first documentary mentions as Liubherisheim in two donation documents that bestowed holdings upon Lorsch Abbey, and are therefore found in the Lorsch codex. Transferred to the Abbey by these acts were, among other things, vineyards within what are now Frei-Laubersheim’s limits. Frei-Laubersheim can thus look back on a history well over 1,200 years long, {{as well as a}} winegrowing tradition of that same length. During the Middle Ages, many monasteries had holdings in the village at their disposal. Among these very early on, besides Lorsch, was Prüm Abbey in the Eifel, which in an 823 exchange agreement acquired, besides holdings in Grolsheim, Horrweiler and Stein-Bockenheim, also property within Frei-Laubersheim’s limits. It is assumed that the village then belonged to the Altenbamberg region of the Bishopric of Verdun. Unmistakably, Tholey Abbey’s holdings leant on Verdun’s. Tholey was the village’s most influential monastery. Besides collation rights (the right to assign priests), which were part of the general use of the ecclesiastical estate and other kinds of income, the abbot collected all the produce and wine tithes. The monastery further owned an estate whose building complex is still preserved today and is mainly found within the Görtz property. The holders of power within the village throughout the Middle Ages and beyond were the Counts of Sponheim and their heirs (who were various and often changed after the Sponheims died out). Besides these lords, other nobles also held other rights in Frei-Laubersheim, mostly relating to smaller landholds. According to the official description of the Amt of Kreuznach from the former “Further” County of Sponheim, in 1601, Frei-Laubersheim was a big village with 92 households or hearths. This would yield a population figure of some 400 souls. In 1672, the village only had a few more than 200 inhabitants, proof of how sorely it had suffered in the ravages of the Thirty Years' War (1618-1648). When broad swathes of the Palatinate and the Rhineland were laid waste in the Nine Years' War (known in Germany as the Pfälzischer Erbfolgekrieg, or War of the Palatine Succession), Frei-Laubersheim, too, was affected. The number of Reformed families sank from 60 to 37. Well-to-do townsmen’s houses, the church and the rectory lay in ruins. Beginning in 1707, Frei-Laubersheim belonged wholly to Electoral Palatinate {{as a result of a}} partition agreement. It was assigned to the Oberamt of Kreuznach. In the late 18th century, the village had 115 families with 464 souls, along with two churches and two schoolhouses alongside the 115 private houses. The municipal area was made up of 1,123 Morgen of cropland, 9 Morgen of vineyards, 75 Morgen of meadows and 745 Morgen of woods. After the French had overrun and occupied the German lands on the Rhine’s left bank in 1794, the region belonged from 1798 to the French First Republic, and more locally to the newly created Department of Mont-Tonnerre (or Donnersberg in German) and the Canton of Wöllstein. Frei-Laubersheim was also the seat of a mairie (“mayoralty”) as of 1800, to which Volxheim also belonged. As they did throughout Rhenish Hesse in the time of French Revolutionary rule, liberty poles, tricolour cockades and red Phrygian caps held their place in Frei-Laubersheim’s everyday life. The simple peasants now became citizens, the clergyman a “folk teacher” and the church a “gathering house”. Thus was the situation after the French Revolutionary troops’ arrival in 1797 described by Pastor Fritsch, who worked as the Evangelical clergyman in Frei-Laubersheim from 1899 to 1934. In 1813 and 1814, part of the beaten Napoleonic army came through Frei-Laubersheim on its retreat, bringing with them Lazarettfieber (literally “field hospital fever” - this was a general term for any of a number of sicknesses, including gangrene, <b>pyaemia,</b> shingles and typhus), and this claimed 57 lives. A few months later, a new misfortune befell the village when 60,000 Russian troops on their way to the Battle of Waterloo marched through the village’s streets. Such a great number of them could not have been billeted very easily, or comfortably. Under the terms of the Congress of Vienna, the land now known as Rhenish Hesse (or Rheinhessen in German, even though it is nowadays no longer in Hesse) was assigned to the Grand Duchy of Hesse. Quite possibly, in connection with the Revolutions of 1848, things such as freedom, constitution and parliament were already being hotly debated, but at the same time, one of the leading minds of the Freischärler ("irregulars") movement was living with the Frei-Laubersheim Evangelical clergyman, Pastor Matty. Details, however, are unknown. On the other hand, much is known about Frei-Laubersheim’s population development in the earlier half of the 19th century. There were 590 citizens in the village in 1815, at the time when the Napoleonic Wars ended. By 1854, this had risen to 771. The century’s last decades brought quiet times, and clubs began to form in the village, as they did elsewhere in the land. Frei-Laubersheim’s oldest is the singing club, founded in 1882. A volunteer fire brigade followed in 1886 and a gymnastic and sport club in 1900. A particularly important event in the village’s history was the opening of the railway from Sprendlingen to Fürfeld in 1898. Frei-Laubersheim got its own station on the line. The Bawettche, as the line was known locally, ran until 1954, at least for passengers. Goods service continued for a while, but in the end, the tracks were torn up in 1960. In 1880, the schoolhouse that still stands today was built. In 1917 came electric light, from neighbouring Bad Kreuznach. Only in 1954 was the watermain built. Until then, people in Frei-Laubersheim fetched water from one of the many household wells.|$|E
