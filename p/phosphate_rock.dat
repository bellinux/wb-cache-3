5|$|In 1951, Albright and Wilson built a {{chemical}} {{works on the}} opposite side of the dock from the power stations. The chemical works produced white phosphorus from <b>phosphate</b> <b>rock</b> imported, through the docks, into the UK. <b>Phosphate</b> <b>rock</b> was stored in concrete silos on the dockside until it was required. Electricity provided by the local power stations was used to run six 7.5megawatt electric arc furnaces (45MW total) that reduced the <b>phosphate</b> <b>rock.</b> The phosphorus was then moved in sealed railway tanks to Oldbury and to Kirkby. After the closure of the factory the decontamination included the removal of yellow (spontaneously combustible) and red allotropes of phosphorus. The site is now home to Portishead volunteer coastguard.|$|E
5|$|Uranium is more {{plentiful}} than antimony, tin, cadmium, mercury, or silver, and it {{is about}} as abundant as arsenic or molybdenum. Uranium is found in hundreds of minerals, including uraninite (the most common uranium ore), carnotite, autunite, uranophane, torbernite, and coffinite. Significant concentrations of uranium occur in some substances such as <b>phosphate</b> <b>rock</b> deposits, and minerals such as lignite, and monazite sands in uranium-rich ores (it is recovered commercially from sources with as little as 0.1% uranium).|$|E
5|$|Nauru is a <b>phosphate</b> <b>rock</b> {{island with}} rich {{deposits}} near the surface, which allowed easy strip mining operations. It has some remaining phosphate resources which, , are not economically viable for extraction. Nauru boasted the highest per-capita income enjoyed by any sovereign {{state in the}} world during the late 1960s and early 1970s. When the phosphate reserves were exhausted, and the island's environment had been seriously harmed by mining, the trust that had been established to manage the island's wealth diminished in value. To earn income, Nauru briefly became a tax haven and illegal money laundering centre. From 2001 to 2008, and again from 2012, it accepted aid from the Australian Government in exchange for hosting the Nauru Regional Processing Centre. As a result of heavy dependence on Australia, many sources have identified Nauru as a client state of Australia.|$|E
40|$|The {{industrial}} {{use of the}} <b>phosphate</b> <b>rocks</b> in the Ryukyu Islands were studied and following results were obtained: (1) It {{may be possible to}} use as powdered phosphate fertilizer because of the following reasons: (a) The <b>phosphate</b> <b>rocks</b> in the Ryukyu Islands contain, as compared with the rocks in the others, less fluorine and much more zinc, manganese, and copper. (b) The <b>phosphate</b> <b>rocks</b> in, [...] the Ryukyu Islands have a high value of 2 % citric acid soluble phosphoric acid. (2) The high value of 2 % citric acid soluble phosphoric acid of the fused phosphate produced from Ryukyu's phosphorite and serpentine makes the <b>phosphate</b> <b>rocks</b> in the Ryukyu Islands an invaluably useful phosphorite as a raw material of fused phosphate fertilizer...|$|R

25|$|The {{concentration}} of cadmium in phosphorus-containing fertilizers varies considerably {{and can be}} problematic. For example, mono-ammonium phosphate fertilizer may have a cadmium content of as low as 0.14 mg/kg or as high as 50.9 mg/kg. This is because the <b>phosphate</b> <b>rock</b> used in their manufacture can contain as much as 188 mg/kg cadmium (examples are deposits on Nauru and the Christmas islands). Continuous use of high-cadmium fertilizer can contaminate soil and plants. Limits to the cadmium content of phosphate fertilizers has been considered by the European Commission. Producers of phosphorus-containing fertilizers now select <b>phosphate</b> <b>rock</b> based on the cadmium content.|$|E

There are important deposits of <b>phosphate</b> <b>rock</b> in a number of areas; Jiangxi, Guangxi, Yunnan and Hubei. Production has been accelerating every year. As of 2013 China is producing 97,000,000 metric tons of <b>phosphate</b> <b>rock</b> a year. Pyrites occur in several places; Liaoning, Hebei, Shandong, and Shanxi have the most important deposits.

Likewise, the presence of humic acid–tryptophan complex and Trp significantly increases plant-available <b>phosphate</b> compared with <b>rock</b> <b>phosphate,</b> up to levels {{similar to those of}} superphosphate.

25|$|The {{radioactive}} {{content of}} the fertilizers varies considerably and depends both on their concentrations in the parent mineral and on the fertilizer production process. Uranium-238 concentrations can range from 7 to 100 pCi/g in <b>phosphate</b> <b>rock</b> and from 1 to 67 pCi/g in phosphate fertilizers. Where high annual rates of phosphorus fertilizer are used, this can result in uranium-238 concentrations in soils and drainage waters that are several times greater than are normally present.

Potentially toxic trace elements in coal include arsenic, beryllium, cadmium, barium, chromium, copper, lead, mercury, molybdenum, nickel, radium, selenium, thorium, uranium, vanadium, and zinc. Approximately 10% of the mass of coals burned in the United States consists of unburnable mineral material that becomes ash, so the concentration of most trace elements in coal ash is approximately 10 times the concentration in the original coal.

During World War II, Molotov cocktails made of phosphorus dissolved in petrol were distributed in Britain to specially selected civilians within the British resistance operation, for defence; and phosphorus incendiary bombs were used in war on a large scale.
