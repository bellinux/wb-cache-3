40|$|Recent {{years have}} seen to appear some new {{developments}} in adapting whole powder pattern profile fitting techniques to severe cases of ill-crystallized materials, including nanocrystalline ones. The Rietveld method is intrinsically unable to consider diffuse scattering since it concentrates on the Bragg scattering. Nevertheless, some defects can be described reasonably as leading to a mean statistical effect inside the average cell (small and uncorrelated atomic displacements). Only those "periodical " defects can be seriously considered in a whole profile approach depending on a hkl-based description of the diffracted intensity. If assimilation to a <b>periodical</b> <b>effect</b> is normal {{in the case of}} size line-broadening, this is much less evident for all the possible effects due to all kinds of dislocations. Indeed, dislocations are building locally some arrangements completely different from the mean unit cell, but they certainly do have statistical effects on the neighboring cells by displacing atoms trying ro resorb the faults. Anisotropic broadening is now undertaken by spherical harmonic expansions rather than by ellipsoid second rank tensors models. The approach is phenomenological, but efforts are made in order to add some physical meaning. Many brilliant demonstrations starting from the well established Fourier coefficients description of diffraction profile are ending almost invariably into a pseudo-Voigt profile shape, certainly losing a bit of the original general sense by successive approximations. A review will be given of the new developments during the last five years, with a special emphasize on the meaning of some oversimplifications...|$|E

30|$|A {{mathematical}} model describing continuous microbial culture and harvest in a chemostat, incorporating a control strategy and defined by impulsive differential equations, is presented and investigated. Theoretical {{results indicate that}} the model has a microbe-extinction periodic solution, which is globally attractive if the threshold R_ 1 is less than unity, and the model is permanent if the threshold R_ 2 is greater than unity. Further, we consider the control strategy under time delay and <b>periodical</b> impulsive <b>effect.</b> Analysis shows that continuous microbial culture and harvest process can be implemented by adjusting time delay, impulsive period or input amount of flocculant. Finally, we give an example with numerical simulations to illustrate the control strategy.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} effects of voltage sags caused by faults on doubly-fed {{induction}} generators to overcome grid faults. A wide range of sag duration and depth values is considered. It is observed that sag duration influence is <b>periodical.</b> Sag <b>effects</b> depend on duration and depth and on the fault-clearing process as well. Two approaches of the model are compared: the most accurate approach, discrete sag, considers that the fault is cleared in the successive natural fault-current zeros of affected phases, leading to a voltage recovery in several steps; the least accurate approach, abrupt sag, considers that the fault is cleared instantaneously in all affected phases, leading to a one-step voltage recovery. Comparison between both sag models reveals that the fault-clearing process smoothes sag effects. The study assumes that the rotor-side converter can keep constant the transformed rotor current in the synchronous reference frame, thus providing insights into wind turbine fault ride-through capability. The voltage limit of the rotor-side converter is considered to show the situations where the rotor current can be controlled. Finally, a table and a 3 D figure summarizing {{the effects of}} the most severe grid faults on the rotor-side converter to overcome the most severe faults are provided. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Many factors complicate {{earthquake}} sequences, {{including the}} heterogeneity and self-similarity of the geological medium, the hierarchical structure of faults and stresses, and small-scale {{variations in the}} stresses from different sources. A seismic process {{is a type of}} nonlinear dissipative system demonstrating opposing trends towards order and chaos. Transitions from equilibrium to unstable equilibrium and local dynamic instability appear when there is an inflow of energy; reverse transitions appear when energy is dissipating. Several metastable areas of a different scale exist in the seismically active region before an earthquake. Some earthquakes are preceded by precursory phenomena of a different scale in space and time. These include long-term activation, seismic quiescence, foreshocks in the broad and narrow sense, hidden <b>periodical</b> vibrations, <b>effects</b> of the synchronization of seismic activity, and others. Such phenomena indicate that the dynamic system of lithosphere is moving to a new state – catastrophe. A number of examples of medium-term and short-term precursors is shown in this paper. However, no precursors identified to date are clear and unambiguous: the percentage of missed targets and false alarms is high. The weak fluctuations from outer and internal sources play a great role on the eve of an earthquake and the occurrence time of the future event depends on the collective behavior of triggers. The main task is to improve the methods of metastable zone detection and probabilistic forecasting...|$|R
40|$|Mandelbrot (1963) {{has been}} the first to {{question}} the simple logic of the Capital Asset Pricing Model (Elton e Gruber 1981). In financial markets, he pointed out, are present complex phenomena as the Noah <b>effect</b> (<b>periodical</b> large shocks) and the Joseph effect (positive trends tend to be followed by positive trends; {{the same is true for}} negative trends). The author believes that even more complex underlying patterns may be found. In this paper, which is of a pure experimental nature, and whose aim is at the moment purely descriptive, the likelyhood of the existence of a complex web of straight lines, so popular in technical analysis, is investigated and it is found that it has a credible foundation. A cyclic non-periodic structure of trends comes to the surface in addition. These results, as many others referenced to in the bibliography, question seriously wether even modern statistical theory (Gnedenko and Kolmogorov 1954) may be adequate to describe such complex phenomena...|$|R
60|$|Again, {{the motion}} of a planet is a {{progressive}} effect, produced by causes at once permanent and progressive. The orbit of a planet is determined (omitting perturbations) by two causes: first, {{the action of the}} central body, a permanent cause, which alternately increases and diminishes as the planet draws nearer to or goes farther from its perihelion, and which acts at every point in a different direction; and, secondly, the tendency of the planet to continue moving in the direction and with the velocity which it has already acquired. This force also grows greater as the planet draws nearer to its perihelion, because as it does so its velocity increases, and less, as it recedes from its perihelion; and this force {{as well as the other}} acts at each point in a different direction, because at every point the action of the central force, by deflecting the planet from its previous direction, alters the line in which it tends to continue moving. The motion at each instant is determined by the amount and direction of the motion, and the amount and direction of the sun’s action, at the previous instant; and if we speak of the entire revolution of the planet as one phenomenon (which, as it is periodical and similar to itself, we often find it convenient to do), that phenomenon is the progressive effect of two permanent and progressive causes, the central force and the acquired motion. Those causes happening to be progressive in the particular way which is called <b>periodical,</b> the <b>effect</b> necessarily is so too; because the quantities to be added together returning in a regular order, the same sums must also regularly return.|$|R
40|$|The {{essential}} {{theme of}} this paper is to highlight the condition of health and hygiene in the British Bengal from the perspective of official documents and vernacular writings, with special emphasis on the journals and <b>periodicals.</b> The fatal <b>effects</b> of the epidemics like malaria and cholera, the insanitary condition of the rural Bengal and the cultivated indifference of the British Raj made the lives of the poor natives miserable and ailing. The authorities had a tendency to blame the colonized for their illiteracy and callousness which became instrumental for the outbreak of the epidemics. On the other, in the late 19 th and the beginning of the 20 th, the vernacular literature played the role of a catalyst in awakening health awareness, highlighting the issues related with ill-health, insanitation and malnourishment. More importantly, it became an active link between the society and culture on the one hand, and health and people on the other. The present researcher wants to highlight these opposite trajectories of mentalities with a different connotation. The ideologies of the Raj and the native political aspirations often reflected in the colonial writings, where the year 1880 was considered as a landmark in the field of public health policies. On the other, the dichotomy between the masters and the colonized took a prominent shape during 1930 s. Within these fifty years; the health of the natives witnessed many upheavals grounded on the social, economic and cultural tensions...|$|R
40|$|Though an {{occasional}} feature {{of society and}} politics prior to the late-seventeenth century, it is only after the Restoration that news became a more permanent aspect of British culture. Through the 1660 s to the early 1700 s, regular news emerged and developed, consumed enthusiastically by an increasingly-politicised public. Historians of the era and genre have looked to this period {{to explain how the}} news press developed its modern characteristics – its periodicity and claim to authenticity; its structure and style. In so doing, the focus of their attentions have overwhelmingly looked to the emergence and development of the print <b>periodical,</b> and its <b>effect</b> on society. The examination of periodical news across the later seventeenth century has taken on a Whiggish perception of print news development, largely neglecting the significance of more ‘traditional’ news forms. Older forms of news dissemination, such as scribal, pamphletary, and oral news, in fact offer an earlier representation of the characteristics that have been attributed to print – and often {{to a greater extent than}} their contemporary printed counterpart. Whether it is in terms of accepted accuracy of content, extent of coverage, or contemporaneity, these older forms of news provide a level of stability and modernity that can only rarely be seen in the print papers of the day. As such, their contribution to the development of news is deserving of further consideration. Using a case-study approach to examine specific time-frames and current events within the chosen period, this thesis considers the impact of news on politics and society, and how the ‘traditional’ forms of news, particularly manuscript, offer a comparatively more ‘modern’ approach to the provision of news information across the later-seventeenth century...|$|R

D.) : Bilkent University, Deparment of Turkish Literature, İhsan Doğramacı Bilkent University, 2014. In this study, I examine {{why and how}} madness—an overarching concept that is positioned as the opposite of rationality and functions {{as a way of}} showing what is abnormal—has been associated with femininity in Turkish literature. Beginning with the 19 th century, I will discuss genderized forms of madness in literature in conjunction with the paradigmatic changes these forms underwent in connection to the Turkish modernization process. In this manner, I will clarify in <b>periodical</b> terms the <b>effects</b> on literature of norms determined by such closely interrelated social variables as political conditions, the development of modern psychiatry, the women’s movement, and the transformation of gender-related social policies. Beginning in the 1890 s, and particularly in the works of male authors, there is a notable prevalence of female characters who go mad as a result of free love and unrestrained sexuality, characters who were drawn under the influence of such contemporary psychiatric notions as hysteria and degeneration. In this context, it is clear that this oft-repeated image is a literary reflection of tacit patriarchal anxieties concerning a loss of authority in the face of women’s struggles for equality and basic rights, struggles that had become an important issue of the Ottoman project of modernization and that took center stage in contemporary debates on societal change. At the same time, those female authors of the period who dealt with the subject of female madness in their works approached the issue differently than male authors in that they took up the matter in terms of women’s place(s) in society. It can also be observed that, in more general terms, the connection made between female madness—as opposed to male rationality and willpower—and the supposed danger to the social order of a female sexuality characterized as “sedition” continued to rear its head through the social gender roles that were given shape under the emergent nationalism of republican modernization. Moreover, in the period after the establishment of the republic, in opposition to the ostensibly new type of woman that emerged as women became “rationalized,” as well as becoming more masculine and losing their aura of mystery, traditional female beauty and sexual attraction became an object of nostalgia for male desire and, once again, came to be resurrected in the form of madness. In the post- 1960 period, a social realist aesthetic became dominant in literature in parallel with the rise of leftist politics. Modernist enterprises that defended aesthetic autonomy came to be criticized within the framework of psychopathology, and female authors—who were among the pioneers of this anti-aesthetic that was medicalized as a bourgeois disease—came {{face to face with a}} double dilemma in terms of having to prove themselves as a result of the gender hierarchy that was in place. However, even as female authors who sought autonomy both aesthetically and intellectually as well as individually were highly praised, they also came to be associated with madness in a romanticized manner that ultimately rendered their literary originality quite indistinct. As a result, the work of Leylâ Erbil, Sevim Burak, and Tezer Özlü—whose names are often connected with madness and at the same time taken as exemplars for contemporary female authors—have remained little studied by critics. In this study, I conduct detailed analyses that focus on one work by each of these authors in which they are considered to have, in different ways, pushed the limits of literature. In this manner, the study will question the specific aesthetic relationship each of these authors and works establishes with madness. by Hilâl Aydın. Ph. D...|$|R
