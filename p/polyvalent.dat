5|$|A {{group of}} {{antibodies}} {{can be called}} monovalent (or specific) if they have affinity for the same epitope, or for the same antigen (but potentially different epitopes on the molecule), or for the same strain of microorganism (but potentially different antigens on or in it). In contrast, a group of antibodies can be called <b>polyvalent</b> (or unspecific) if they have affinity for various antigens or microorganisms. Intravenous immunoglobulin, if not otherwise noted, consists of <b>polyvalent</b> IgG. In contrast, monoclonal antibodies are monovalent for the same epitope.|$|E
5|$|In {{times of}} armed {{conflict}} and war, the SBS and SAS are required to operate in small parties in enemy-controlled territory. Operations of this nature require men of courage and high morale who have excellent tactical awareness be it knowledge of special tactics or simply knowing one's place in a <b>polyvalent</b> unit. Self-discipline neatly ties into this. Intelligence, reliability, determination and also being physically fit are key skills.|$|E
5|$|Also held in {{the city}} is Delahoya, Romania's oldest {{electronic}} music festival, established in 1997. Electric Castle Festival, which takes place at Bánffy Castle in nearby Bonțida, had an audience of over 30,000 people for its first edition in 2013 and was nominated by European Festivals Awards for the Best New Festival and Best Medium Size Festival awards. By 2016, over 120,000 were in attendance. Untold Festival, which began in 2015, is Romania's largest music festival. Held mainly in the Cluj Arena, and also at the <b>Polyvalent</b> Hall, it drew over 300,000 in its second edition.|$|E
5|$|The venom of {{the black}} mamba is {{extremely}} toxic. Its bites can deliver about 100–120mg of venom on average and the maximum dose recorded is 400mg. It is reported that before antivenom was widely available, the mortality rate from a bite was nearly 100%. The bite of a black mamba can potentially cause collapse in humans within 45 minutes, or less. Without effective antivenom therapy, death typically occurs in 7–15 hours. Presently, there is a <b>polyvalent</b> antivenom produced by the South African Institute for Medical Research to treat black mamba bites from many localities, and a new antivenom is currently being developed by the Universidad de Costa Rica's Instituto Clodomiro Picado.|$|E

25|$|Eastern Orthodox Christian {{theology}} is the theology particular to the Eastern Orthodox Church (officially the Orthodox Catholic Church). It {{is characterized by}} monotheistic Trinitarianism, belief in the Incarnation of the essentially divine Logos or only-begotten Son of God, a balancing of cataphatic theology with apophatic theology, a hermeneutic defined by a <b>polyvalent</b> Sacred Tradition, a concretely catholic ecclesiology, a robust theology of the person, and a principally recapitulative and therapeutic soteriology.|$|E
25|$|From these materials, pectin is {{extracted}} by adding hot dilute acid at pH-values from 1.5 – 3.5. During {{several hours of}} extraction, the protopectin loses some of its branching and chain length and goes into solution. After filtering, the extract is concentrated in vacuum and the pectin then precipitated by adding ethanol or isopropanol. An old technique of precipitating pectin with aluminium salts is no longer used (apart from alcohols and <b>polyvalent</b> cations, pectin also precipitates with proteins and detergents).|$|E
25|$|Identification of {{the snake}} is {{important}} in planning treatment in {{certain areas of the}} world, but is not always possible. Ideally the dead snake would be brought in with the person, but in areas where snake bite is more common, local knowledge may be sufficient to recognize the snake. However, in regions where <b>polyvalent</b> antivenoms are available, such as North America, identification of snake is not a high priority item. Attempting to catch or kill the offending snake also puts one at risk for re-envenomation or creating a second person bitten, and generally is not recommended.|$|E
25|$|Antivenom is {{injected}} into the person intravenously, and works by binding to and neutralizing venom enzymes. It cannot undo damage already caused by venom, so antivenom treatment should be sought as soon as possible. Modern antivenoms are usually <b>polyvalent,</b> making them effective against the venom of numerous snake species. Pharmaceutical companies which produce antivenom target their products against the species native to a particular area. Although some people may develop serious adverse reactions to antivenom, such as anaphylaxis, in emergency situations this is usually treatable and hence the benefit outweighs the potential consequences of not using antivenom. Giving adrenaline (epinephrine) to prevent adverse effect to antivenom before they occur might be reasonable where they occur commonly. Antihistamines {{do not appear to}} provide any benefit in preventing adverse reactions.|$|E
25|$|The {{treatment}} for a snakebite is as variable as the bite itself. The most common and effective method is through antivenom (or antivenin), a serum made from the venom of the snake. Some antivenom is species-specific (monovalent) while some is made for use with multiple species in mind (<b>polyvalent).</b> In the United States for example, all species of venomous snakes are pit vipers, {{with the exception of}} the coral snake. To produce antivenom, a mixture of the venoms of the different species of rattlesnakes, copperheads, and cottonmouths is injected into the body of a horse in ever-increasing dosages until the horse is immunized. Blood is then extracted from the immunized horse. The serum is separated and further purified and freeze-dried. It is reconstituted with sterile water and becomes antivenom. For this reason, people who are allergic to horses are more likely to suffer an allergic reaction to antivenom. Antivenom for the more dangerous species (such as mambas, taipans, and cobras) is made in a similar manner in India, South Africa, and Australia, although these antivenoms are species-specific.|$|E

In 2007, Beyoncé also performed in Cluj-Napoca, at the Ion Moina Stadium. In 2010, Iron Maiden included the city in their Final Frontier World Tour. The Cluj Arena was inaugurated in 2011 with concerts by Scorpions and Smokie, the main event drawing over 40,000 people; other events followed, for instance Roxette in 2012 and Deep Purple in 2013. Smaller events occur regularly at the <b>Polyvalent</b> Hall, the Opera and the Students' House of Culture.

500|$|William III's {{birthday}} fell on 4November, and for orthodox Whigs the {{two days}} therefore became an important double anniversary. [...] William ordered that the thanksgiving service for 5November be amended to include thanks for his [...] "happy arrival" [...] and [...] "the Deliverance of our Church and Nation". In the 1690s he re-established Protestant rule in Ireland, and the Fifth, occasionally marked by the ringing of church bells and civic dinners, was consequently eclipsed by his birthday commemorations. [...] From the 19th century, 5November celebrations there became sectarian in nature. [...] Its celebration in Northern Ireland remains controversial, unlike in Scotland where bonfires continue to be lit in various cities. [...] In England though, as one of 49official holidays, for the ruling class 5November became overshadowed by {{events such as the}} birthdays of Admiral Edward Vernon, or John Wilkes, and under George II and George III, {{with the exception of the}} Jacobite Rising of 1745, it was largely [...] "a polite entertainment rather than an occasion for vitriolic thanksgiving". [...] For the lower classes, however, the anniversary was a chance to pit disorder against order, a pretext for violence and uncontrolled revelry. At some point, for reasons that are unclear, it became customary to burn Guy Fawkes in effigy, rather than the pope. [...] Gradually, Gunpowder Treason Day became Guy Fawkes Day. [...] In 1790 The Times reported instances of children [...] "...begging for money for Guy Faux", and a report of 4November 1802 described how [...] "a set of idle fellows... with some horrid figure dressed up as a Guy Faux" [...] were convicted of begging and receiving money, and committed to prison as [...] "idle and disorderly persons". The Fifth became [...] "a polysemous occasion, replete with <b>polyvalent</b> cross-referencing, meaning all things to all men". [...] Lower class rioting continued, with reports in Lewes of annual rioting, intimidation of [...] "respectable householders" [...] and the rolling through the streets of lit tar barrels. [...] In Guildford, gangs of revellers who called themselves [...] "guys" [...] terrorised the local population; proceedings were concerned more with the settling of old arguments and general mayhem, than any historical reminiscences. [...] Similar problems arose in Exeter, originally the scene of more traditional celebrations. [...] In 1831 an effigy was burnt of the new Bishop of Exeter Henry Phillpotts, a High Church Anglican and High Tory who opposed Parliamentary reform, and who was also suspected of being involved in [...] "creeping popery". [...] A local ban on fireworks in 1843 was largely ignored, and attempts by the authorities to suppress the celebrations resulted in violent protests and several injured constables.|$|E

2500|$|Vaccines may be {{monovalent}} (also called univalent) or multivalent (also called <b>polyvalent).</b> A {{monovalent vaccine}} {{is designed to}} immunize against a single antigen or single microorganism. A multivalent or <b>polyvalent</b> vaccine is designed to immunize against two or more strains of the same microorganism, or against two or more microorganisms. The valency of a multivalent vaccine may be denoted with a Greek or Latin prefix (e.g., tetravalent or quadrivalent). [...] In certain cases, a monovalent vaccine may be preferable for rapidly developing a strong immune response.|$|E

The trawlers operate only on the mainland shelf and target demersal species such as horse mackerel, blue whiting, octopus and crustaceans.|$|E
2500|$|A mordant is a {{substance}} {{used to set}} dyes on fabrics or tissue sections by forming a coordination complex with the dye, which subsequently attaches to the fabric or tissue. [...] A mordant often contains a <b>polyvalent</b> metal ion, commonly aluminium or iron, {{as is the case}} with mixtures of aluminium triacetate with aluminium sulfacetate or with basic aluminium diacetate. [...] Aluminium triacetate mordants have been used with cotton, other cellulose-based fibres, and silk. [...] They have also been combined with ferrous acetate to produce different colours.|$|E
2500|$|When {{molecules}} on {{the surface}} of a cell are crosslinked, they are moved to one end of the cell to form a [...] "cap". This phenomenon, the process of which is called cap formation, was discovered in 1971 on lymphocytes and is a property of amoebae and all locomotory animal cells except sperm. The crosslinking is most easily achieved using a <b>polyvalent</b> antibody to a surface antigen on the cell. Cap formation can be visualised by attaching a fluorophore, such as fluorescein, to the antibody.|$|E
2500|$|The Portuguese fishing {{industry}} is fairly large and diversified. [...] Fishing vessels classified {{according to the}} area in which they operate, can be divided into local fishing vessels, coastal fishing vessels and long-distance fishing vessels. [...] The local fleet is mainly composed of small traditional vessels (less than 5 GRT), comprising, in 2004, 87% of the total fishing fleet and accounting for 8% of the total tonnage. These vessels are usually equipped to use more than one fishing method, such as hooks, gill nets and traps, and constitute the so-called <b>polyvalent</b> segment of the fleet.|$|E

2500|$|The Cape cobras venom {{is made up}} of potent postsynaptic {{neurotoxins}} {{and might}} also contain cardiotoxins, that affect the respiratory system, nervous system, and the heart. The mouse SC [...] for this species' venom is 0.72, while the IV and IP [...] values are 0.4mg/kg and 0.6mg/kg, respectively. The average venom yield per bite is 100 to 150mg according to Minton. The mortality rate for untreated bites is not exactly known, but is thought to be high. This can be due to various factors including the amount of venom injected, psychological state of the bitten subject, the penetration of one or both fangs, and so on. Mechanical ventilation and symptom management is often enough to save a victim's life, but cases of serious Cape cobra envenomation will require antivenom. When death does occur, it normally takes anywhere from an hour (in severe cases) to ten hours (or more) and it is often as a result of respiratory failure, due to the onset of paralysis. The antivenom used in case of a bite is a <b>polyvalent</b> antivenom produced by the South African Institute of Medical Research (SAIMR).|$|E
