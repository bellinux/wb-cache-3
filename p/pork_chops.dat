500|$|The {{success of}} [...] "Boogie Chillen'" [...] brought {{numerous}} offers for John Lee Hooker to record for other record companies. [...] Because he received little remuneration from {{the sales of}} his record, Hooker readily accepted the opportunities to generate income. This led to his recording {{using a variety of}} pseudonyms, including Texas Slim, Little <b>Pork</b> <b>Chops,</b> Delta John, Birmingham Sam, the Boogie Man, Johnny Williams, John Lee Booker, John Lee Cooker, and others for such labels as King, Danceland, Regent, Savoy, Acorn, Prize, Staff, Gotham, Gone, Chess, and Swing Time.|$|E

500|$|Writer Bill Oakley {{suggested}} the episode's barbecue scenes. Cohen's first draft contained a more philosophical argument between Lisa and Homer about eating meat, but Oakley told Cohen {{that the story}} needed something more specific {{to serve as the}} basis of Homer and Lisa's dispute. George Meyer, a writer known among the staff for his [...] "bizarre physical jokes", contributed the idea of the barbecue pig getting caught in the spillway and flying into the air. Cohen credits writer John Swartzwelder for inspiring the scene in which Homer finds it impossible to believe that bacon, ham, and <b>pork</b> <b>chops</b> could possibly come from the same animal. [...] According to Cohen it was based on a real statement made by Swartzwelder, who was going on and on about how amazing the pig is for the variety of cuts of meat that come from it.|$|E
500|$|Waters was {{reportedly}} reduced to tears {{by the sight}} of his former bandmate, who was asked by fellow visitor Andrew King how he had managed to gain so much weight. Barrett said he had a large refrigerator in his kitchen, and that he had been eating lots of <b>pork</b> <b>chops.</b> He also mentioned that he was ready to avail the band of his services, but while listening to the mix of [...] "Shine On", showed no signs of understanding its relevance to his plight. He joined the guests at Gilmour's wedding reception in the EMI canteen, but left without saying goodbye. None of the band members saw him from that day on until his death in 2006. Although the lyrics had already been created, Barrett's presence on that day may have influenced the final part of the song – a subtle refrain performed by Wright from [...] "See Emily Play" [...] is audible {{towards the end of the}} album.|$|E
500|$|Many {{aspects of}} Gaga's career are {{referenced}} in the episode. [...] "You're All My Little Monsters", a musical number specifically {{created for the}} episode, is a parody of Gaga's relationship with her devout [...] "Little Monsters"—a phrase Gaga uses to refer to her fans. To Spin columnist Devon Maloney, the song was ultimately an overtly cartoonized version of her single [...] "Born This Way" [...] (2011) that embraces the [...] "freakiness" [...] of Springfield. Several of Gaga's outfits and looks emulate several iconic costumes the singer had previously worn, such as the [...] "Living Dress" [...] and pyrotechnic leotard she wore during her endeavors on The Monster Ball Tour, {{as well as her}} wardrobe at the 53rd Grammy Awards. One in particular, a dress consisting of <b>pork</b> <b>chops,</b> is a parody of the singer's meat dress, which she wore at the 2010 MTV Video Music Awards. During the credits of [...] "Lisa Goes Gaga", main character Homer Simpson performs a rendition of [...] "Poker Face" [...] (2009). At the end of the episode, a title card promotes the Maggie-starring short film The Longest Daycare, which was shown before [...] (2012).|$|E

50|$|The Shanghai-style fried <b>pork</b> <b>chop</b> is a {{local variety}} of breaded cutlet. It is {{particularly}} popular as street food. The <b>pork</b> <b>chop</b> is coated with bread flour before being fried to avoid too much greasiness and to be crispy outside but tender inside. Back to {{the old days when}} supplies were badly needed in Shanghai, soda crackers were crushed to replace bread flour, which produced a different unique flavor. In Shanghai, the <b>pork</b> <b>chop</b> is enjoyed together with the special local la jiang you sauce, whose taste and ingredients are somewhat different from the British Worcestershire sauce.|$|R

In July 1969, Old Ebbitt Grill was one of 171 firms in the city cited for non-payment of taxes. A tax claim was also filed by the federal government, and the business was unable to satisfy the claim. [...] On June 5, 1970, Old Ebbitt Grill was closed by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for failure to pay $10,995.15 in taxes going back to 1965.|$|E
2500|$|After {{the end of}} World War II, Poland {{fell under}} Soviet / Communist occupation. Some {{restaurants}} were nationalized. The communists envisioned a net of lunch rooms called [...] "bufet" [...] for the workers at various companies, and milk bars for the public. The majority of restaurants that survived the 1940s and 1950s were state-owned. Workplace lunch rooms promoted mostly inexpensive meals, including soups of all kinds, meatballs and <b>pork</b> <b>chops,</b> and staples such as placki ziemniaczane (potato pancakes), placki z jablkami (apple pancakes), kopytka (potato gnocchi), leniwe (farmer's cheese gnocchi served sweet) and pierogi. A typical second course consisted of meat cutlet served with potatoes or buckwheat and [...] "surówka" [...] (raw, julienned vegetables). The popular Polish kotlet schabowy is a breaded cutlet similar to the Austrian Wiener schnitzel and the Italian and Spanish Milanesa.|$|E
