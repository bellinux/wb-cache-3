Due to nonuniform spacing of seeds along the rows and lack of control on planting depth, this machine aggravates the growth related problems and degrades the quality of a sensitive crop such as oilseed rape.

Around the turn to the 20 th century, two very different <b>precision</b> <b>seed</b> drill methods were developed almost at the same time. Band seeding made it possible to achieve nearly perfect single grain sowing. For this purpose, individual, equally spaced seeds were embedded into bands of paper or cotton. In the field, these seed tapes were then unreeled from large drums. The pneumatic system proposed in 1897, by contrast, introduced grain singling using a vacuum for the first time. Although band seeding presented a satisfactory technological solution, it was never widely applied. Pneumatic systems, on the other hand, took long to catch on and only started to be successful in the late 1960 s. Up to then, these innovative systems had to be considered as failures. Changing the period under review, however, may completely reverse the assessment of whether an innovation is a success or a failure...|$|E

In the experiment, 30 %, 40 % and 50 % of the field area was tilled respectively with the strips in 22. 5, 30 and 37. 5 cm widths, which were obtained by changing the positions of flanges and blade connections of the rotary hoe.

A {{computational fluid dynamics}} (CFD) model was developed that calculates the airflow and dust particle movement around the machine. To this end, the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations are solved around the 3 D geometry of seed drillers to obtain the airflow field {{as a result of}} the airjet(s) emitted from the fan exhaust of the pneumatic machines. In addition, the track of dust particles is calculated from the emission sources on the machine into the surrounding air using a Lagrangian tracking procedure of representative dust particles. In this contribution, the model is used to calculate the dust emission, distribution and deposition around static drillers operated in a closed environment. The pneumatic drills chosen were: an overpressure based pneumatic bulk drilling machine (Kuhn Venta nc 3000) and a vacuum based <b>precision</b> <b>seed</b> drill with and without deflectors (Gaspardo ST Stella 300). The machine and dust characteristics were measured and are presented in separate contributions. The measured properties of the emitted dust particles (particle size distribution, density and shape) and the airflow characteristics from the machine (fan outlet direction, air velocity magnitude at outlet) were used in the CFD model as inputs, while the machine and tractor geometry were obtained from CAD drawings. The CFD model predicted the behavior of the dust particles around the static machines. The dust cloud was calculated for a representative number of 10 000 particles from the measured size distribution.

40|$|Autonomous {{technology}} in agriculture offers many products that reduce distractions and fatigue experienced by machinery operators, including automatic path guidance, variable rate product delivery, and <b>precision</b> <b>seed</b> placement. However, {{the size and}} complexity of modern mechanical harvesting operations have limited the ability of autonomous technology to significantly reduce total negative effects on grain combine operators. Combine operators are highly susceptible to fatigue because several tasks must be performed simultaneously to ensure safe machine operation. These duties include monitoring internal threshing and crop flow intake, maintaining row alignment, avoiding foreign material intake, and overseeing unloading grain. The primary goal of this project was to design a decision support system for autonomous unloading of combines. When unloading grain on-the-go, operators divert more attention away from critical tasks to focus on grain delivery to the adjacent cart. An autonomous system {{eliminating the need for}} combine operators to focus on unloading on-the-go potentially reduces operator stress and grain spillage. Critical to the decision support system for autonomous unloading was the input of a two-dimensional fill grid used to describe the grain height in the cart. The inverse distance weighting method, an estimation technique common to spatial data modeling, was used to estimate points in the fill grid of a grain cart prone to being immeasurable or highly variable. This method was successful in estimating missing points in a grain cart under difficult delivery conditions to within 15 cm of underestimation and 25 cm of overestimation. A model to predict the weight of grain in a grain cart was developed using the average grain height measured in the cart. The model demonstrated high robustness by producing mean errors that changed by less than 2 % of the total cart volume when the delivery conditions strayed from typical conditions to highly biased conditions. The decision support system that was developed exhibited robust performance when critical features of the system were tested at typical levels. Field testing validated the potential to apply the decision support system to autonomous combine unloading systems by producing predictable and consistent final cart volumes that were within 5 % of the total volume...|$|E

The study first examined the effect of plant density at a constant rectangularity of 1 : 1. Seed was hand-sown at 178, 400, 625, 816, 1111 and 1600 plants m- 2 (cv. White Spanish) in 1980 and 51, 69, 83, 100, 178 and 400 plants m- 2 (cv. Pukekohe Longkeeper) in 1981. Total, ware and pickling bulb yields followed parabolic relationships with plant density and were highest at 420, 148 and 666 plants m- 2 respectively. Increases in plant density reduced plant size, mean bulb weight, plant fresh and dry weights, number of leaves, cumulative leaf length, time to maturity {{and the proportion of}} round bulbs, but did not affect the soluble solids content, bulb ratio or percentage dry matter per plant. Density had no effect on bulb uniformity but could be used to determine the distribution of size grades within the crop. The second part of the study examined the effect of plant arrangement at a constant density. Seed (cv.

Plant arrangement had no significant effect on total bulb yield, mean bulb size or bulb uniformity but altered bulb shape. Yield and number of round bulbs decreased as rectangularity increased.

Trinexapac-ethyl (TE), chlormequat chloride (CM), paclobutrazol (PB), propiconazole (PPC), diquat (DQ), flazasulfuron (FS), glyphosate (GP), ethephon (EP), and gibberellic acid (GA) were applied to pot-grown âPatriotâ hybrid bermudagrass turf in eight different application rates, ranging for each product from the minimum expected effective rate to a potentially harmful rate.

As the gray-scale {{value of the}} seeds coated with magnetic powder {{is very close to}} the electromagnet, the method of seed feature extraction based on morphological image processing is proposed and performance testing model of <b>precision</b> metering <b>seed</b> is put forward. The results of comparison between machine vision and manual detection showed that the relative error of preciseness was less than 3 % and coefficient of variation and standard deviation were less than 5 %, which indicated the system is of high accuracy when used in real-time detection...|$|R
30|$|<b>Precision</b> farming, whereby <b>seed</b> is {{automatically}} sown in varying intensities according to GPS field data on variability in soil humidity and fertility, {{held in the}} laptop in the farmerâs tractor cab, makes for enhanced efficiency and effectiveness in this increasingly high-tech farming model. But the prospective is that farmer co-operation {{would enable them to}} undertake local, small-scale biorefining. SugarGrass is fermentable for extracting the juice that becomes ethanol to be used on farm or sold. But the dried remnants can also be used either as fodder or as feedstock for yet another bioenergy variant, biomass power station burning.|$|R
