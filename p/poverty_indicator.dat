40|$|<b>Poverty</b> <b>indicators</b> are {{generally}} identified {{on the basis}} of household consumption expenditure data drawn from nationally representative household budget surveys. In this study, we explore the potential role for more qualitative methods in generating <b>poverty</b> <b>indicators</b> and profiles that incorporate local perspectives on poverty. More specifically, {{on the basis of}} participatory wealth rankings, we identify covariates that could serve as <b>poverty</b> <b>indicators.</b> Furthermore, we check the performance of these indicators when using a more conventional indicator or well-being. To do so, we conducted participatory wealth rankings in four villages in the Southern Highlands of Tanzania. Then, we administered a small questionnaire-based survey to the ranked households to probe for possible <b>poverty</b> <b>indicators</b> that can broadly be classified under four categories, namely household characteristics, human capital, housing and durables, productive assets. We find that most of the routinely used <b>poverty</b> <b>indicators</b> remain valid, but for some, we also find interesting differences. Copyright 2007 The author 2006.

40|$|This paper investigates whether two popular <b>poverty</b> <b>indicators,</b> namely income <b>poverty</b> and {{material}} deprivation, reach similar {{conclusions about the}} poverty reduction effects of income transfers. Such evaluations generally use income poverty. It is well-known, however, that <b>poverty</b> <b>indicators</b> regularly disagree about a person’s poverty status. What is less known is whether such disagreement also confounds estimates of a program’s poverty reduction effects. This paper compares the targeting performance of social assistance, housing and family transfers in countries with different welfare states namely Germany, France, Ireland, the Netherlands, Sweden and the United Kingdom. It finds that a transfer’s targeting performance does not differ much when defining the transfer’s target group either as the poorest income quintile or the poorest material deprivation quintile. Yet, when combining the information from both indicators, transfers appear much more effective in reaching those groups that both <b>poverty</b> <b>indicators</b> identify {{as part of the}} target group. Transfers also appear much more efficient in excluding non-target populations. For the groups on which the <b>poverty</b> <b>indicators</b> disagree, more analysis is needed. Triangulation between <b>poverty</b> <b>indicators</b> thus improves the validity of program evaluations as it enables a better separation between (potential) poverty measurement issues and the measurement of a program’s (potential) effects...|$|R

40|$|There is no {{international}} {{consensus on}} what poverty {{is and how}} it should be measured. The most commonly used <b>poverty</b> <b>indicator,</b> income level, is limited as it ignores the multidimensional character of poverty. Because the choice of an indicator reflects societal values and developmental goals, and because what gets measured gets attention from policy makers and society, the choice of a <b>poverty</b> <b>indicator</b> is important. It sets priorities for policies and programs and determines outcomes of development. The paper reviews qualifications of a good indicator and proposes child malnutrition as an appropriate <b>poverty</b> <b>indicator.</b> It points out that implications of allowing poverty to affect children go beyond individual children to the health, well being and productivity of future generations and of society as a whole. It finds child nutrition to be a more comprehensive than income level as it is reflective of desirable outcomes of development i. e. improvement in gender equality, intra-household distribution, and health environment quality. Using Indonesia as a case study, the paper evaluates the practicality of adopting child malnutrition as a <b>poverty</b> <b>indicator</b> for ADB's rural development projects. Strengths and weaknesses of three child malnutrition indicators: stunting, wasting, and underweight are reviewed in the context of different development interventions. The paper concludes that child malnutrition is highly relevant conceptually but the practical use as a <b>poverty</b> <b>indicator</b> varies by country due to the limitation on data availability.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the levels {{and changes in}} <b>poverty</b> <b>indicators</b> of the rural and urban population in India disaggregated by social and economic groups. The analysis {{is based on the}} comparable estimates of poverty on the mixed reference period computed from the unit record data for the 50 th (1993 - 94) and the 55 th (1999 - 2000) rounds of the Consumer Expenditure Surveys conducted by the National Sample Survey Organisation. The issue is how far different social and economic groups shared the overall decline in poverty in the 1990 s. Four <b>poverty</b> <b>indicators</b> are considered, namely, headcount ratio, the depth and severity measures (PGI and FGT*) as also the absolute size of the poor population. The social groups most vulnerable to poverty have been identified to be the scheduled caste households and the scheduled tribe households with both these groups having above average levels of <b>poverty</b> <b>indicators</b> in the rural and the urban population. Among the economic groups, the most vulnerable groups are the agricultural labour households (rural) and the casual labour households (urban) each having {{the highest levels of the}} <b>poverty</b> <b>indicators</b> in their respective population segments. In terms of changes in poverty in the 1990 s, it is found that while the scheduled caste and the agricultural labour (rural) and the casual labour (urban) households experienced declines in poverty on par with the total population, the scheduled tribe households fared badly in both the segments. A further disaggregated analysis brings out the consequences for poverty of combined social and economic vulnerabilities. The paper also presents <b>poverty</b> <b>indicators</b> adjusted for between-(economic and social) group disparity and discusses the implications of the empirical results for the design of a strategy for poverty reduction.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the effect of}} population ageing on macroeconomic aggregates. The author´s objective is to verify, whether there exists any relationship of the population ageing factors and the GDP growth rate, social expenditures growth rate and the consumption growth rate. Econometric models are based on theoretical specifications of Faruqee´s life-cycle model and Prettner´s R&D model with overlapping generations. The degree of economic development is also taken into account. Furthermore, the author modified the R&D model by incorporation of the <b>poverty</b> <b>indicator</b> and its application on available datasets. The research is focused on five European countries in 1995 - 2013. The Ordinary Least Squares method is used to gain estimated results in regression analyses. The author managed to prove an existing relationship between the old age dependency ratio and the social expenditures in all countries except Switzerland. The impact of the population ageing factor on the consumption growth rate {{turned out to be}} significant in all of those countries. Substantial fluctuations are shown only in Bulgaria and in the Czech Republic. The GDP growth rate seems to be influenced by ageing factor in the Czech Republic and in the Ukraine alone.
