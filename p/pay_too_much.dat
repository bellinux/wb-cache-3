The primary obstacle is that except for professors of transportation economics and a cadre of vocal environmentalists, few people are in favor of considerably higher charges for peak-period travel. Middle-class motorists often complain they already <b>pay</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> in gasoline taxes and registration fees to drive their cars, and that to pay more during congested periods would add insult to injury. In the United States, few politicians are willing to champion the cause of congestion pricing for fear of reprisal from their constituents. Critics also argue that charging more to drive is elitist policy, pricing the poor off of roads so that the wealthy can move about unencumbered. It is for all these reasons that peak-period pricing remains a pipe dream in the minds of many." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a 1971 {{interview}} with Dick Cavett, Knievel {{stated that he}} was uninsurable following the Caesars' crash. [...] Knievel said he was turned down 37 times from Lloyd's of London, stating, [...] "I have trouble getting life insurance, accident insurance, hospitalization and even insurance for my automobile...Lloyd's of London has rejected me 37 times so if you hear the rumor that they insure anybody, don't <b>pay</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> attention to it." [...] Four years later, a clause in Knievel's contract to jump 14 buses at Kings Island required a one-day $1 million liability insurance to the amusement park. [...] Lloyd's of London offered the liability insurance for what was called a [...] "laughable $17,500". [...] Knievel eventually paid $2,500 to a U.S.-based insurance company.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the book}} Intentional Interruption: Breaking Down Learning Barriers to Professional Practice, Steven Katz and Lisa Ain Dack {{identified}} six mental barriers to learning in PLCs: [...] "we don't think through all possibilities; {{we focus on}} confirming our hypotheses and not challenging them; we <b>pay</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> attention to things that are vivid; we consider ourselves to be exceptions; we hesitate to take action in a new direction; we don't want others to see our vulnerabilities". Katz and Dack opt for a psychological definition of learning: [...] "Learning is the process through which experience causes permanent change in knowledge or behaviour". It is the characteristic of permanence which raises the bar for all professional learning, because learning as permanent change is not easy or natural to achieve. Katz and Dack urge designers of professional learning to avoid the [...] "activity trap" [...] of assuming that participation in a protocol or process guarantees real learning has occurred or putting so much emphasis on the activity that learning is lost in the shuffle.|$|E

2500|$|C.R.B. Combellack openly {{challenges}} Ousby's {{interpretation of}} the Informer's identity. He feels that since, [...] "Shakespeare's objections to false accusations against him are the very {{subject matter of the}} poem, an Informer who lays information against another is particularly apropos in the poem". Combellack subscribes to the idea that there are four characters represented in Sonnet 125: the Speaker, the Friend, the Informer, and the Suborner. He believes that the actions of the first quatrain were accusations leveled against Shakespeare as the Speaker. For Combellack, Shakespeare becomes the canopy-bearer as a means of advancement toward fame and fortune. In the second quatrain, Shakespeare shows how those who participate in these grand gestures often <b>pay</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> and lose a great deal only to have their gestures be seen as empty. Combellack sees the third quatrain as the offer of genuine love to the Friend, [...] "uncomplicated by any secondary thought of self-interest, in return for love". The couplet then changes tone once more as Combellack views it. He sees it as Shakespeare defending himself against gossip by pointing out how [...] "outrageously untrue gossip" [...] could not possibly be believed by his Friend. There is more hope in Combellack's interpretation of Sonnet 125, because he sees the altruism of the love offered by Shakespeare and how vehemently he denies the rumors against him.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} regret-related feedback information on bidding behavior in sealed-bid first-price auctions. Two types of regret are possible in this auction format. A winner of the auction may regret <b>paying</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> relative to the second highest bid, and a loser may regret missing an opportunity to win at a favorable price. In theory, under very general conditions, being sensitive to winning and <b>paying</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> should result in lower average bids, and being sensitive to missing opportunities to win at a favorable price should result in higher bids. For example, the U. S. Government's policy of revealing losing bids may cause regret-sensitive bidders to anticipate regret and bid conservatively, decreasing the government's revenue. We test these predictions in the laboratory and find strong support for both. auctions, competitive bidding, regret, learning, experimental economics...|$|R
60|$|It {{has been}} said by some critics, who judge of Cooper by his failures, {{that he had no}} skill in drawing female characters.

60|$|If {{we leave}} this {{question}} apart, I {{think it will}} be the experience of the careful observer that there is a summit of healthful looks in England, which we do not touch in America, whatever the large table-land or foot-hill average we reach; and in like manner there is an exceptional distinction of presence as one encounters it, rarely enough, in the London streets, which one never encounters with us. I am not envying the one, or at least not regretting the other. Distinction is the one thing for which I think humanity certainly pays too much; only, in America, we <b>pay</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> for too many other things to take any great comfort in our want of distinction. I own the truth without grief or shame, while I enjoy the sight of distinction in England as I enjoy other spectacles for which I cannot help letting the English <b>pay</b> <b>too</b> <b>much.</b> I was not appreciably the poorer myself, perhaps I was actually the richer, in seeing, one fine chill Sunday afternoon, in the aristocratic region where I was taking my walk, the encounter of an elderly gentleman and lady who bowed to each other on the pavement before me, and then went and came their several ways. In him I saw that his distinction was passive and resided largely in his drab spats, but hers I beheld active, positive, as she marched my way with the tall cane that helped her steps, herself tall in proportion, with a head, ashen gray, held high, and a straight well-fitted figure dressed in such keeping that there was nothing for the eye to dwell on in her various black. She looked not only authoritative; people often do that with us; she looked authorized; she had been empowered by the vested rights and interests to look so her whole life; one could not be mistaken in her, any more than in the black trees and their electric-green buds in the high-fenced square, or in the vast, high, heavy, handsome houses where, in the cellary or sepulchral cold, she would presently resume the rheumatic pangs of which the comparative warmth of the outer air had momentarily relieved her stately bulk.|$|E
