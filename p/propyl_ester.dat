However, only methyl ester conversion (20. 83 %) was possible in Pen-taclethra macrophylla oil. In Jatropha curcas using KOH catalyst, only methyl ester (80 %) formation was possible.

40|$|The {{recently}} observed depletion in {{the petroleum}} resources, which also mainly constituted carbon dioxide emission {{and global warming}} problems call for renewable and sustainable alternative fuels. Oils were extracted from various seeds: Jatropha curcas (Botuje), Pentaclethra macrophylla (Apara) and soybean, using petroleum ether (40 - 60 ℃). Alkali catalyzed transesterification of the oils (biodiesel pro-duction) {{in the presence of}} different kinds of alcohol (methanol, ethanol and propanol) were carried out using sodium hydroxide as catalyst. In the case of Jatropha oil, potassium hydroxide served as catalyst. Effect of catalysts to obtain optimum biofuel was established. In the case of soybean oil, fatty acid methyl ester, FAME, (96 %), fatty acid ethyl ester, FAEE, (84 %) and fatty acid <b>propyl</b> <b>ester,</b> FAPE, (37. 50 %) were pro-duced. In waste palm kernel oil, methyl ester (72. 92 %) and ethyl ester (46. 25 %) were obtained. In refined palm kernel oil, methyl ester (70. 83 %), ethyl ester (66. 67 %) and (14. 17 %) <b>propyl</b> <b>ester</b> were produced. However, only methyl ester conversion (20. 83 %) was possible in Pen-taclethra macrophylla oil. In Jatropha curcas using KOH catalyst, only methyl ester (80 %) formation was possible. Moreover, yields were af-fected as the alcohol alkyl became bulkier giving relatively lower value of biodiesel. Sulphur content (0. 01) obtained for each of the biofuel was satisfactory when compared with ASTM standard (0. 05 maximum). The cetane value of soybean oil (45. 5), refined palm kernel oil (46) and used oil (44. 6) were quite reasonable compared with the special standard (47). The combustion energy of the fuels from refined palm kernel oil, waste palm kernel oil and soybean are 39, 36 and 45. 5 respectively. The total glycerol content (Gc) of the methyl and ethyl esters emanat-ed from soybean are quite reasonable and fell within standar...|$|E

Pictet-Spengler condensation of 7 -furoylamino- 2 -formylquinoline- 5, 8 -dione (55) with (3 -methyltryptophan methyl ester (4), Ltryptophan methyl ester (56), L-tryptophan ethyl ester (57), L-tryptophan <b>propyl</b> <b>ester</b> (58), L-tryptophan butyl ester (59), L-tryptophan isoamyl ester (60), L-tryptophan cyclohexyl ester (61), L-tryptophan octyl ester (62), L-tryptamine (63), in xylene, or anisole afforded ten lavendamycin analogs. Aldehyde 55 was prepared {{according to the}} following general procedure. Nitration of 8 -hydroxy- 2 -methylquinoline (30) gave 8 -hydroxy- 2 -methyl- 5, 7 dinitroquinoline (31). Compound 31 was then hydrogenated and acylated with 2 -furoyl chloride (or acetic anhydride) to yield 5, 7 -difuroylamino- 8 -hydroxy- 2 -methylquinoline (53) or 5, 7 -diacetamino- 8 -acetoxy- 2 -methyl- quinoline (33). Compounds 53 and 33 were oxidized by potassium dichromate to give the corresponding 5, 8 -diones 54, and 27. Treatment of 53, and 27 with selenium dioxide in refluxing wet dioxane afforded compounds 55 and 28. Compound 4 was previously prepared by other members of our group, compounds 56, 57, 59, and 62 were obtained through the neutralization of the corresponding Ltryptophan ester hydrochlorides with a 14 % ammonium hydroxide solution followed by extraction. Compounds 58, 60, 61 were synthesized via a Fischer esterification of Ltryptophan with : propyl alcohol, isoamyl alcohol, and cyclohexyl alcohol saturated with hydrogen chloride. The structures of compounds 53, 54, 55, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, and 44 were confirmed through 1 H NMR, IR, EIMS, and HRMS. Elemental analyses of 53, 54, and 55 are also included.

40|$|In recent years, {{there has}} been an {{increasing}} concern in the field of endocrine disruption over the presence of various endocrine disrupting chemicals in Pharmaceuticals and Personal care products (PPCPs). This concern has also been as PPCPs are most widely used and had led to introduction of thousands of new and complex chemicals that enter the environment in large quantities. The effect of the chemicals has not only been restricted to human who are exposed directly to the chemicals or the animals which gets exposed to the chemicals through wide variety of veterinary drugs, but also the aquatic organisms and other form of Wildlife which are non target and indirectly gets exposed to the chemicals through individual human activity. Parabens includes a group of compound of which methylparaben, butylparaben, ethylparaben, propylparaben are most widely used as preservatives in various PPCPs. Recent concern over the use of parabens has been drawn by the scientific community as these chemicals are reported to exert a weak estrogenic activity, with butylparaben showing the most potent activity among methyl-, ethyl- and <b>propyl</b> <b>esters</b> in in vitro recombinant yeast assay and in in vivo uterotrophic assay. Human exposure to butylparaben which occur mainly through inhalation, ingestion, or eye or skin contact, from intake of foods or drugs or use of cosmetics and personal care products where butylparaben is mainly used as a preservative. Effects of butylparaben are studied in various animal model systems like rodents to determine the possible effects in human which showed various effects which include defects in male reproductive system like increase in weight of epididymis, also change in serum testosterone level and a significant increase in uterine weight in ovariectomized and immature rats. Other effects include irritation to the respiratory tract, allergic skin reactions, atrophy of lymphoid tissue in the spleen, thymus, and lymph nodes and multifocal degeneration and necrosis in the liver parenchyma were also observed. The aquatic effects of butylparaben include the feminization of male fish and alteration of the behaviors of either sex at part-per-trillion concentrations. A multitude of other aquatic effects are possible because hormone systems are central to the development, functioning, and reproduction of most organisms...|$|R
40|$|Nitrification {{inhibitory}} {{activity was}} found in root tissue extracts of Brachiaria humidicola, a tropical pasture grass. Two active inhibitory compounds were isolated by activity-guided fractionation, using recombinant Nitrosomonas europaea containing luxAB genes derived from the bioluminescent marine gram-negative bacterium Vibrio harveyi. The compounds were identified as methyl-p-coumarate and methyl ferulate, respectively. Their nitrification inhibitory properties were confirmed in chemically synthesized preparations of each. The IC 50 values of chemically synthesized preparations were 19. 5 and 4. 4 Î¼M, respectively.
