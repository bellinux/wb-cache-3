Recently, interest in development of appropriate prosthetic devices which would stimulate osseointegration into osteoporotic, appendicular, axial and mandibular bone has intensified. Augmentation of osteopenic lumbar vertebrae with bioactive ceramics (vertebroplasty) is another area that will require testing in the appropriate animal model. Using experimental animal models for the study of these different facets of osteoporosis minimizes some of the difficulties associated with studying the disease in humans, namely time and behavioral variability among test subjects. New experimental drug therapies and orthopaedic implants can potentially be tested on large numbers of animals subjected to a level of experimental control impossible in human clinical research...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The pig is {{emerging}} as a model species that bridges the gap between rodents and humans in research. In particular, the miniature pig (referred to hereafter as the minipig) is increasingly being used as non-rodent species in pharmacological and toxicological studies. However, there is as yet a lack of validated behavioral tests for pigs, although {{there is evidence that}} the spatial holeboard task can be used to assess the working and reference memory of pigs. In the present study, we compared the learning performance of commercial <b>pigs</b> <b>and</b> Göttingen <b>minipigs</b> in a holeboard task. Methods Biperiden, a muscarinic M 1 receptor blocker, is used to induce impairments in cognitive function in animal research. The two groups of pigs were treated orally with increasing doses of biperiden (0. 05 – 20 [*]mg. kg - 1) after they had reached asymptotic performance in the holeboard task. Results Both the conventional <b>pigs</b> <b>and</b> the Göttingen <b>minipigs</b> learned the holeboard task, reaching nearly errorless asymptotic working and reference memory performance within approximately 100 acquisition trials. Biperiden treatment affected reference, but not working, memory, increasing trial duration and the latency to first hole visit at doses[*]≥[*] 5 [*]mg. kg - 1. Conclusion Both pig breeds learned the holeboard task and had a comparable performance. Biperiden had only a minor effect on holeboard performance overall, and mainly on reference memory performance. The effectiveness needs to be evaluated further before definitive conclusions can be drawn about the ability of this potential cognition impairer in pigs. </p...|$|R
40|$|Minipigs {{are widely}} used as a large animal model for {{cartilage}} repair. However, many in vitro studies are based on porcine chondrocytes derived from abundantly available premature hybrid pigs. It remains unclear whether pig line-dependent differences exist which could limit the comparability between in vitro and in vivo results using either hybrid or miniature pig articular chon-drocytes. Porcine knee joint femoral cartilage was isolated from 3 - to 5 -month-old hybrid <b>pigs</b> <b>and</b> Göttingen <b>minipigs.</b> Cartilage from both pig lines was analysed for thickness, zonality, cell content, size and proteoglycan deposition. Cultured articular chon-drocytes from both pig lines were investigated for gene and/or protein expression of cartilage-specific proteins such as type II collagen, aggrecan, the chondrogenic transcription factor Sox 9, non-specific type I collagen and the cell-matrix receptor b 1 -integrin. Cartilage was significantly thinner in the miniature pig compared to the hybrid pig, but {{the differences between the}} medial and lateral femur condyles did not reach a significant level. Knee joint cartilage zone formation started only in the <b>minipig,</b> whereas cellularity <b>and</b> cell diameters were comparable in both pig lines. Blood vessels could be detected in the hybrid pig but not the minipig cartilage. Sulphated proteoglycan deposition was more pronounced in cartilage zones II–IV of both pig lines.

40|$|The {{gastrointestinal}} (GI) {{tract of}} humans and animals is colonized by microorganisms immediately after birth. The composition of the GI tract microbiota undergoes remarkable alterations during early age, reaches a relative stable status in adulthood, and is driven by external factors such as habitual diet, location along the intestine, antibiotic therapy and maternal microbiota, and intrinsic factors such as host species and genotype. Whereas usually faecal samples are used for assessing {{the impact on the}} microbiota in human intervention studies, in vitro and animal models provide an easier way to collect many (invasive) samples, have multiple comparisons and regulating the genotype background. Animal models, and in particular mammalian models, provide an alternative way to study the in vivo responses to beneficial, commensal and pathogenic microorganisms in the GI tract, including studies that aim to see the impact of the host system as well. The main animals used to study the mammalian GI tract are rodents (mainly mice and rats) and pigs. Rodent and pig models, including gnotobiotic and humanized rodents and <b>pigs</b> <b>and</b> <b>minipigs,</b> have been extensively employed in gut microbiota studies, and especially the piglet model has been suggested as an appropriate model for human infant studies. With pig models, several intestinal sampling techniques can be applied in kinetic microbiota studies, including small intestinal segment perfusion and cannulation.

40|$|The aim of {{this review}} article is to provide an {{overview}} of the role of pigs as a biomedical model for humans. The usefulness and limitations of porcine models have been discussed in terms of metabolic, cardiovascular, digestive and bone diseases in humans. Domestic <b>pigs</b> <b>and</b> <b>minipigs</b> are the main categories of pigs used as biomedical models. One drawback of minipigs is that they are in short supply and expensive compared with domestic pigs, which in contrast cost more to house, feed and medicate. Different porcine breeds show different responses to the induction of specific diseases. For example, ossabaw minipigs provide a better model than Yucatan for the metabolic syndrome as they exhibit obesity, insulin resistance and hypertension, all of which are absent in the Yucatan. Similar metabolic/physiological differences exist between domestic breeds (e. g. Meishan v. Pietrain). The modern commercial (e. g. Large White) domestic pig has been the preferred model for developmental programming due to the 2 - to 3 -fold variation in body weight among littermates providing a natural form of foetal growth retardation not observed in ancient (e. g. Meishan) domestic breeds. Pigs have been increasingly used to study chronic ischaemia, therapeutic angiogenesis, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and abdominal aortic aneurysm as their coronary anatomy and physiology are similar to humans. Type 1 and II diabetes can be induced in swine using dietary regimes and/or administration of streptozotocin. Pigs are a good and extensively used model for specific nutritional studies as their protein and lipid metabolism is comparable with humans, although pigs are not as sensitive to protein restriction as rodents. Neonatal and weanling pigs have been used to examine the pathophysiology and prevention/treatment of microbial-associated diseases and immune system disorders. A porcine model mimicking various degrees of prematurity in infants receiving total parenteral nutrition has been established to investigate gut development, amino acid metabolism and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Endoscopic therapeutic methods for upper gastrointestinal tract bleeding are being developed. Bone remodelling cycle in pigs is histologically more similar to humans than that of rats or mice, and is used {{to examine the relationship between}} menopause and osteoporosis. Work has also been conducted on dental implants in pigs to consider loading; however with caution as porcine bone remodels slightly faster than human bone. We conclude that pigs are a valuable translational model to bridge the gap between classical rodent models and humans in developing new therapies to aid human health. ...|$|E
40|$|This {{habilitation}} thesis investigated how {{the use of}} {{computed tomography}} (CT) with subsequent 2 D and 3 D reformations can contribute in animal experiments and to the 3 R concept in terms of reduction, refinement and replacement. Especially computed tomographic scans have a high value in the comprehensive analysis of animal experimental projects due to the short acquisition time. The low-risk imaging of the animal by CT and postprocessing of the acquired volume data sets {{make it possible to}} answer questions even far beyond the initial question. The habilitation thesis presented here demonstrates the value of CT for animal studies and especially in the areas of replacement, reduction and refinement according to the 3 R principles of Russell and Burch: We could detect pulmonary changes on CT representing influence of non-physiological positioning on lung perfusion and ventilation (see page 13). Also we were able to image the reasons for limitations of veno-venous hemofiltration and present alternatives (see page 23). For refinement of the animal model "Minipig" the central vessels were measured in vivo by CT at different time points and then correlated to histology. For the first time a data pool was generated, which -without restriction of fixation and shrinkage- is comparable to what will be encountered during surgery or interventional procedures (see page 35). Furthermore, the influence of weight and growth on the vascular system of minipigs aged between 16 - 20 months could be relativized. The evaluation of a vein cuff, which has been tested according its position, function and biocompatibility, was done exclusively on CT data sets. With the help of CT most of the questions could be answered {{during the course of the}} trial without killing the animals. The aspect of reduction (less animals) was successfully implemented here (see page 40). Two aspects of physiological and pathophysiological changes were successfully represented by means of computed tomographic volume data sets : It has been shown that -and how- a complete occlusion of the aorta can be completely compensated without clinical symptoms in female domestic pigs due to specific collaterals (see page 51). Finally, the concept of the critical defect size was called into question observating bone defects in the mandible of minipigs. Different defect sizes far beyond the size considered as critical showed extensive new bone formation in CT and in volumetric assessment (see page 65). At the same time the limitations of an animal model and the consequences were addressed in this study. The knowledge gained here can be used to prevent experimental projects, as these data shows once again that a well-established animal models need to be examined further because of insufficient physiological description. Additionally, a pool of data acquired from all studies in domestic <b>pigs</b> <b>and</b> <b>minipigs</b> enables further evaluation with new questions and without further scans or measurements. For example, one given publication did not require any additional animal testing but was based on the existing data of the image archive. Questions on musculoskeletal system, maturation and growth, for example, can be answered or planned and optimized from such a data pool. Imaging techniques like CT provide a potential that goes far beyond answering the initial questions of a trial...|$|E

Although low-resolution CNV maps are produced in many domestic animals, and several reports have been published about the CNVs of porcine genome, the differences between Chinese <b>and</b> western <b>pigs</b> still remain to be elucidated. In this study, we used Porcine SNP 60 BeadChip and PennCNV algorithm to perform a genome-wide CNV detection in 302 individuals from six Chinese indigenous breeds (Tongcheng, Laiwu, Luchuan, Bama, Wuzhishan <b>and</b> Ningxiang <b>pigs),</b> three western breeds (Yorkshire, Landrace and Duroc) and one hybrid (Tongcheng 6 Duroc). A total of 348 CNV Regions (CNVRs) across genome were identified, covering 150. 49 Mb of the pig genome or 6. 14 % of the autosomal genome sequence. In these CNVRs, 213 CNVRs were found to exist only in the six Chinese indigenous breeds, and 60 CNVRs only in the three western breeds.

40|$|Our current {{knowledge}} {{regarding the}} efficacy of factors stimulating collateral artery growth in the peripheral circulation primarily stems from models in small animals. However, experimental models in large sized animals are a prerequisite for extrapolation of growth factor therapy to patients with peripheral atherosclerotic obstructive disease. Therefore, we have developed a novel porcine femoral artery ligation model using non-invasive and invasive evaluation techniques. In 12 young farm <b>pigs</b> <b>and</b> nine older <b>minipigs,</b> a ligation of the superficial femoral artery was performed. Using an intra-arterial catheter, phosphate buffered saline (PBS) was administered with a first-pass over the collateral vascular bed. Directly after ligation as well as after 2 weeks of continuous infusion of PBS, perfusion of the leg was measured using various flow and pressure parameters. Using a pump driven extracorporal system, collateral conductance was determined under maximal vasodilatation. Conductance decreased after acute ligation to similar levels in both young farm pigs {{as well as the}} older minipigs (both 9. 3 % of normal perfusion) and recovered after 2 weeks to a higher value in farm pigs compared with minipigs (22. 4 vs. 12. 7 % of normal; P < 0. 05). Angiography using both X-ray and magnetic resonance imaging was performed to visualize the formed collateral arteries. To {{the best of our knowledge}} this is the first in vivo pig model for hemodynamic assessment of growth of collateral arteries in the peripheral circulation, that is suitable for evaluation of arteriogenic effects of growth factors or genes.

30|$|Several animal {{models are}} {{available}} for articular cartilage research. As described in the above, the biological repair response must resemble what is seen in a clinical situation, but {{the size of the}} animal, the cartilage thickness, and ethical concerns must also be considered before choosing a suitable model. Small animal models as the rabbit are frequently used in articular cartilage research, but the model suffers from a high level of endogenous repair making the model best suited for proof-of-concept studies rather than clinical translation (Chu et al. 2010). The dog, sheep and goat models are roughly {{the same size as the}} <b>minipig,</b> <b>and</b> all have been used in cartilage repair studies. The articular cartilage of the dog <b>and</b> <b>minipig</b> shares the same collagen arrangement as in humans (Kaab et al. 1998). Furthermore, dogs, unlike rabbits, goats, sheep <b>and</b> <b>minipigs,</b> can be trained to accept braces to limit weight bearing, to further mimic the clinical situation. While the dogs’ status as a family pet complicates its use from an ethical standpoint, the fact that goats and sheep are ruminant animals limits the available housing and surgical facilities due to the risk of prion disease transmission. The horse model has an articular cartilage thickness of 1.5 – 2  mm which is significantly closer to humans (2 – 2.5  mm) than rabbits (< 0.3  mm), sheep (0.4 – 0.5  mm), dogs <b>and</b> <b>minipigs</b> (0.5 – 0.8  mm) or goats (0.9 – 1.5  mm) (Shortkroff et al. 1996; Hunziker 2002; Frisbie et al. 2006; Gotterbarm et al. 2008). This makes the horse model an obvious choice if human-like cartilage thickness is required, however, the acquisition cost and handling difficulties significantly limits a more widespread use.|$|R
40|$|Recent {{evidence}} suggests that the gut microbiota is an important contributing factor to obesity and obesity related metabolic disorders, known as the metabolic syndrome. The aim {{of this study was to}} characterise the intestinal microbiota in two pig models of obesity namely Göttingen <b>minipigs</b> <b>and</b> the Ossabaw <b>minipigs.</b> The cecal, ileal and colonic microbiota from lean and obese Osabaw <b>and</b> Göttingen <b>minipigs</b> were investigated by Illumina-based sequencing and by high throughput qPCR, targeting the 16 S rRNA gene in different phylogenetic groups of bacteria. The weight gain through the study was significant in obese Göttingen <b>and</b> Ossabaw <b>minipigs.</b> The lean Göttingen minipigs' cecal microbiota contained significantly higher abundance of Firmicutes (P< 0. 006), Akkermensia (P< 0. 01) and Methanovibribacter (P< 0. 01) than obese Göttingen minipigs. The obese Göttingen cecum had higher abundances of the phyla Spirochaetes (P< 0. 03), Tenericutes (P< 0. 004), Verrucomicrobia (P< 0. 005) and the genus Bacteroides (P< 0. 001) compared to lean minipigs. The relative proportion of Clostridium cluster XIV was 7. 6 -fold higher in cecal microbiota of obese Göttingen minipigs as compared to lean. Obese Ossabaw minipigs had a higher abundance of Firmicutes in terminal ileum and lower abundance of Bacteroidetes in colon than lean Ossabaw minipigs (P< 0. 01). Obese Ossabaws had significantly lower abundances of the genera Prevotella and Lactobacillus and higher abundance of Clostridium in their colon than the lean Ossabaws. Overall, the Göttingen <b>and</b> Ossabaw <b>minipigs</b> displayed different microbial communities in response to diet-induced obesity in the different sections of their intestine. Obesity-related changes in the composition of the gut microbiota were found in lean versus obese Göttingen <b>and</b> Ossabaw <b>minipigs.</b> In both pig models diet seems to be the defining factor that shapes the gut microbiota as observed by changes in different bacteria divisions between lean <b>and</b> obese <b>minipigs...</b>|$|R

Subsequently, a human recombinant chimeric AP (recAP) was developed as a pharmaceutically acceptable alternative. Here, we investigated the biodistribution and pharmacokinetics (PK) of recAP and developed a translational population PK model. Biodistribution was studied during LPS-induced AKI in rats. Iodine- 125 -labeled recAP was primarily taken up by liver, spleen, adrenals, heart, lungs and kidneys followed by the gastro-intestinal tract and thyroid. Tissue distribution was not critically affected by endotoxemia. PK parameters were determined in rats <b>and</b> <b>minipigs</b> during IV bolus injections of recAP, administered once, or once daily during seven consecutive days.

40|$|The pig {{has been}} {{reported}} to present with a stronger hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPV) than many other species, including dogs. We investigated [pulmonary arterial pressure (Ppa) -pulmonary arterial occluded pressure (Ppao) ] vs. pulmonary blood flow (Q) relationships and pulmonary vascular impedance (PVZ) spectra in nine <b>minipigs</b> <b>and</b> nine weight-matched dogs. The animals were anesthetized and ventilated in hyperoxia [inspired O 2 fraction 0. 4] or hypoxia (inspired O 2 fraction 0. 12). PVZ was computed from the Fourier series for Ppa and Q. In hyperoxia, the pigs had a higher Ppa (26 +/- 1 vs. 16 +/- 1 mmHg), a higher first-harmonic impedance (Z 1), and a more negative low-frequency phase angle but no different characteristic impedance (Zc) compared with the dogs at the same Q. Hypoxia in the dogs increased (Ppa-Ppao) at all levels of Q studied by an average of 2 mmHg but did not affect Z 1 or Zc. Hypoxia in the pigs increased (Ppa-Ppao) at all levels of Q by an average of 13 mmHg and increased Z 1 and Zc. Inhaled NO (150 ppm) reversed the hypoxia-induced changes in (Ppa-Ppao) /Q plots and PVZ in the dogs <b>and</b> <b>pigs.</b> However, differences in (Ppa-Ppao) /Q plots and PVZ between the dogs <b>and</b> <b>pigs</b> in hyperoxia <b>and</b> hypoxia were not affected by inhaled NO.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} the {{cognitive}} performance of piglets with {{low birth weight}} (LBW) caused by intra-uterine growth restriction (IUGR), {{and the effects of}} a possible therapy to prevent IUGR-related brain damage and associated cognitive impairments were studied. To achieve these goals, several conditions had to be fulfilled. First, an appropriate cognitive task had to be selected and validated. Then, the effects of IUGR in this task had to be investigated using the most suitable task. In addition, basic pharmacokinetic data of the putative therapeutic drug were collected in sows and piglets. Finally, the effects of the therapeutic drug on IUGR piglets were assessed. A test for visual discrimination and a test for spatial cognition were developed and applied. Based on the behavioural performance of the pigs in both tasks, the latter was found most suitable as it allows for species-specific behaviour, and matches the capabilities and motivation of the pig the best. This spatial test, ‘the cognitive pig holeboard’ was therefore further developed and automated. To improve validity of this cognitive test, a study with biperiden (a muscarinic M 1 receptor blocker, inducing temporary cognitive impairments) was performed with both conventional <b>pigs</b> <b>and</b> Göttingen <b>minipigs.</b> During the training phase, both groups were able to reach nearly errorless performance. Biperiden had only a minor effect on holeboard performance overall, and mainly on reference memory performance. Furthermore, LBW piglets were trained in the cognitive pig holeboard test. Both LBW and their normal birth weight littermates were able to learn the task. After presenting them a reversal (rewards hidden in different places than before), the LBW piglets showed a transiently retarded acquisition of this task supporting the hypothesis that LBW is related to (mild) subsequent cognitive impairments. These results were not replicated in the next experiment in which allopurinol was tested as a possible therapy to prevent brain damage in IUGR neonates. The differences in the set-up of training could have caused these different findings. In this experiment, piglets were, via the sow, chronically treated with allopurinol during the last trimester of pregnancy. No detrimental effects of treatment were found but a beneficial effect on holeboard performance could not be demonstrated in both LBW and normal birth weight piglets. Though, on brain level long-lasting increased mBDNF and PSD 95 protein levels in the dorsal hippocampus of allopurinol treated pigs were found. This could be seen as a promising indicator for the efficacy of chronic prenatal allopurinol treatment. Both proteins are part of the BDNF mediated neuronal plasticity pathway that is involved in spatial memory performance. To conclude with, the LBW piglet model is considered to be suitable for further development and practical application. Enhanced postnatal care of the piglets could increase translatability of the model. The cognitive pig holeboard is found to be a reliable behavioural task for measuring several components of spatial learning and memory of various pig breeds from the age of weaning onwards. Therefore this test can be applied when testing the LBW piglet and possible preventive therapeutics...|$|R

In view of the hEPO sorting difference, we have conducted a similar study in nonhuman primates. Specifically, we examined hGH and hEPO sorting after adenoviral (Ad) vector-mediated gene transfer to parotid glands of rhesus macaques, another large and important animal model. Two groups (n[*]=[*] 2 per dose group; total n[*]=[*] 8) of male macaques received either 1010 particles per gland (low-dose group) or 1011 particles per gland (high-dose group) of adenoviral (Ad) vectors encoding either hGH (AdhGH) or hEPO (AdhEPO) via intraoral cannulation of both parotid glands. All macaques tolerated administration of Ad vectors well, with no clinically significant changes observed in any hematological and serum chemistry parameters. In AdhGH-treated animals, hGH was secreted exclusively into saliva.

We further support the finding that the genome of Sus scrofa contains about ten-times less pseudogenized genes compared to other vertebrates. Among the functional human orthologs of these minipig pseudogenes we found HEPN 1, a putative tumor suppressor gene. The genomes of Sus scrofa, the Tibetan boar, the African Bushpig, and the Warthog show sequence conservation of all inactivating HEPN 1 mutations suggesting disruption before the evolutionary split of these pig species. We identify 133 Sus scrofa specific, conserved long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in the <b>minipig</b> genome <b>and</b> show that these transcripts are highly conserved in the African <b>pigs</b> <b>and</b> the Tibetan boar suggesting functional significance. Using a new minipig specific microarray we show high conservation of gene expression signatures in 13 tissues with biomedical relevance between humans <b>and</b> adult <b>minipigs.</b> We underline this relationship for <b>minipig</b> <b>and</b> human liver where we could demonstrate similar expression levels for most phase I drug-metabolizing enzymes. Higher expression levels and metabolic activities were found for FMO 1, AKR/CRs and for phase II drug metabolizing enzymes in minipig as compared to human. The variability of gene expression in equivalent human <b>and</b> <b>minipig</b> tissues is considerably higher in minipig organs, which is important for study design in case a human target belongs to this variable category in the minipig. The first analysis of gene expression in multiple tissues during development from young to adult shows that the majority of transcriptional programs are concluded four weeks after birth. This finding is in line with the advanced state of human postnatal organ development at comparative age categories and further supports the minipig as model for pediatric drug safety studies.; Genome based assessment of sequence conservation combined with gene expression data in several tissues improves the translational value of the minipig for human drug development. The genome and gene expression data presented here are important resources for researchers using the minipig as model for biomedical research or commercial breeding. Potential impact of our data for comparative genomics, translational research, and experimental medicine are discussed...|$|R

Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) primar-ily causes human diseases and has recently been identified in <b>pigs</b> <b>and</b> <b>pig</b> handlers.

40|$|In {{this review}} paper, {{literature}} data on pre- and postnatal eye development are compared {{between humans and}} nonclinical species that are commonly used for human safety assessment, namely, mouse, rat, rabbit, dog, <b>minipig,</b> <b>and</b> nonhuman primates. Some new data on rat <b>and</b> <b>minipig</b> ocular development are also included. This compiled information can be helpful for species selection in juvenile toxicity studies or assist {{in the interpretation of}} (non) clinical data during pediatric drug development. Despite some differences in developmental windows and anatomical peculiarities, such as the lack of a fovea centralis in nonprimate species or the presence of a nictitating membrane in some nonclinical species, the functioning and development of the eye is strikingly similar between humans and other mammals. As such, all commonly used nonclinical species appear to be relatively good models for human eye development, although some practical constraints such as size may be a limiting factor.

Using 16 S rRNA marker gene sequencing, we characterized the skin microbiomes of people from two racial groups (the Tibetans and the Hans) and of three local pig breeds (Tibetan <b>pig,</b> Rongchang <b>pig,</b> <b>and</b> Qingyu <b>pig)</b> at high <b>and</b> low altitudes. The skin microbial communities of low-altitude <b>pigs</b> <b>and</b> humans were distinct from those of high-altitude <b>pigs</b> <b>and</b> humans, with five bacterial taxa (Arthrobacter, Paenibacillus, Carnobacterium, and two unclassified genera in families Cellulomonadaceae and Xanthomonadaceae) consistently enriched in both <b>pigs</b> <b>and</b> humans at high altitude. Alpha diversity was also significantly lower in skin samples collected from individuals living at high altitude compared to individuals at low altitude.
