40|$|Offshoring and {{offshore}} outsourcing is increasingly affecting the EU- 15, {{both in the}} manufacturing and services sectors.

Offshoring {{and offshore}} outsourcing, similar to other trade, creates both domestic winners and losers. The EU- 15 countries have the potential to become net beneficiaries from offshoring and offshore outsourcing, if they go ahead and implement the EU Lisbon Agenda with respect to labor market reforms and worker-skill upgrading. Furthermore, EU governments should take steps to promote the mobility of the workforce by increasingly linking social benefits to the willingness to move for work, thereby combating their archipelago of high unemployment enclaves, and to reform EU regional aid by shifting it from infrastructure spending to human capital investment.
