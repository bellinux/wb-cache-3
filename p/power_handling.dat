5|$|As the {{efficiency}} {{is proportional to}} Fs3, small improvements in low frequency extension with the same driver and box volume will result in very significant reductions in efficiency. For these reasons, subwoofers are typically very inefficient at converting electrical energy into sound energy. This combination of factors accounts for the higher amplifier power required to drive subwoofers, and the requirement for greater <b>power</b> <b>handling</b> for subwoofer drivers. Enclosure variations (e.g., bass reflex designs with a port in the cabinet) are often used for subwoofers to increase {{the efficiency}} of the driver/enclosure system, helping to reduce the amplifier power requirements.|$|E

25|$|<b>Power</b> <b>handling</b> {{is related}} to the heat {{resistance}} of the wire insulation, adhesive, and bobbin material, and may be influenced by the coil's position within the magnetic gap. The majority of loudspeakers use 'overhung' voice coils, with windings that are taller than the height of the magnetic gap. In this topology, a portion of the coil remains within the gap at all times. The <b>power</b> <b>handling</b> is limited by the amount of heat that can be tolerated, and the amount that can be removed from the voice coil. Some magnet designs include aluminium heat-sink rings above and below the magnet gap, to improve conduction cooling, significantly improving <b>power</b> <b>handling.</b> If all other conditions remain constant, the area of the voice coil windings is proportional to the <b>power</b> <b>handling</b> of the coil. Thus a 100mm diameter voice coil, with a 12mm winding height has similar <b>power</b> <b>handling</b> to a 50mm diameter voice coil with a 24mm winding height.|$|E

A driver may be damaged at much less than its rated power if driven past its mechanical limits at lower frequencies. Tweeters can also be damaged by amplifier clipping (amplifier circuits produce large amounts of energy at high frequencies in such cases) or by music or sine wave input at high frequencies. Each of these situations might pass more energy to a tweeter than it can survive without damage. In some jurisdictions, <b>power</b> <b>handling</b> has a legal meaning allowing comparisons between loudspeakers under consideration.

25|$|In a dual {{resonant}} solid-state Tesla coil (DRSSTC), {{the electronic}} switching of the solid-state Tesla coil {{is combined with}} the resonant primary circuit of a spark-gap Tesla coil. The resonant primary circuit is formed by connecting a capacitor in series with the primary winding of the coil, so that the combination forms a series tank circuit with a resonant frequency near that of the secondary circuit. Because of the additional resonant circuit, one manual and one adaptive tuning adjustment are necessary. Also, an interrupter is usually used to reduce the duty cycle of the switching bridge, to improve peak power capabilities; similarly, IGBTs are more popular in this application than bipolar transistors or MOSFETs, due to their superior <b>power</b> <b>handling</b> characteristics. A current-limiting circuit is usually used to limit maximum primary tank current (which must be switched by the IGBT's) to a safe level. Performance of a DRSSTC can be comparable to a medium-power spark-gap Tesla coil, and efficiency (as measured by spark length versus input power) can be significantly greater than a spark-gap Tesla coil operating at the same input power.|$|E
25|$|A driver with {{a higher}} maximum power rating cannot {{necessarily}} be driven to louder levels than a lower-rated one, since sensitivity and <b>power</b> <b>handling</b> are largely independent properties. In the examples that follow, assume (for simplicity) that the drivers being compared have the same electrical impedance, are operated at the same frequency within both driver's respective pass bands, and that power compression and distortion are low. For the first example, a speaker 3dB more sensitive than another produces double the sound power (is 3dB louder) for the same power input. Thus, a 100W driver ("A") rated at 92dB for 1W @ 1m sensitivity puts out twice as much acoustic power as a 200W driver ("B") rated at 89dB for 1W @ 1m when both are driven with 100W of input power. In this particular example, when driven at 100W, speaker A produces the same SPL, or loudness as speaker B would produce with 200W input. Thus, a 3dB increase in sensitivity of the speaker means that it needs half the amplifier power to achieve a given SPL. This translates into a smaller, less complex power amplifier—and often, to reduced overall system cost.|$|E
25|$|Passive {{crossovers}} {{are commonly}} installed inside speaker boxes and {{are by far}} the most usual type of crossover for home and low-power use. In car audio systems, passive crossovers may be in a separate box, necessary to accommodate the size of the components used. Passive crossovers may be simple for low-order filtering, or complex to allow steep slopes such as 18 or 24dB per octave. Passive crossovers can also be designed to compensate for undesired characteristics of driver, horn, or enclosure resonances, and can be tricky to implement, due to component interaction. Passive crossovers, like the driver units that they feed, have <b>power</b> <b>handling</b> limits, have insertion losses (10% is often claimed), and change the load seen by the amplifier. The changes are matters of concern for many in the hi-fi world. When high output levels are required, active crossovers may be preferable. Active crossovers may be simple circuits that emulate the response of a passive network, or may be more complex, allowing extensive audio adjustments. Some active crossovers, usually digital loudspeaker management systems, may include electronics and controls for precise alignment of phase and time between frequency bands, equalization, dynamic range compression and limiting) control.|$|E

500|$|... where R is {{the loop}} {{resistance}} per metre and Z0 is the characteristic impedance. [...] Making {{the diameter of}} the inner conductor larger will decrease R and decreasing R decreases the loss. [...] On the other hand, Z0 depends on the ratio of the diameters of outer and inner conductors (Dr) and will decrease with increasing inner conductor diameter thus increasing the loss. [...] There is a specific value of Dr for which the loss is a minimum and this turns out to be 3.6. [...] For an air dielectric coax this corresponds to a characteristic impedance of 77Ω. [...] The coax produced during the war was rigid air-insulated pipe, and this remained the case for some time afterwards. [...] The second requirement is for maximum <b>power</b> <b>handling</b> and was an important requirement for radar. [...] This is not the same condition as minimum loss because <b>power</b> <b>handling</b> is usually limited by the breakdown voltage of the dielectric. [...] However, there is a similar compromise in terms of the ratio of conductor diameters. [...] Making the inner conductor too large results in a thin insulator which breaks down at a lower voltage. [...] On the other hand, making the inner conductor too small results in higher electric field strength near the inner conductor (because the field lines are closer together on the smaller circumference) and again reduces the breakdown voltage.
