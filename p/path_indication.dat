The flight director system could offer an explanation for the regular rates of descent. At approximately 3,200 ft over N a spurious glide path was crossed during the second procedure turn. Now if {{on the basis of this}} indication, which might have also coincided with a localizer indication, the flight director was set to the approach mode in order to follow both pointers on this, the subsequent approach might be explained, but only if the two pilots neglected to keep the normal, continuous, mutual check on the basic navigational instruments and the marker control. The artificial horizon pitch bar which is not integrated with the ILS glide path signals required an average rate of descent of approximately 500 ft/min to maintain a 2.5° glide path without wind correction. In this instrumentation, the ILS glide <b>path</b> <b>indication</b> takes the form of a small triangle in the artificial horizon.|$|E
30|$|Because of the {{characteristics}} of electromagnetic waves to penetrate solids, RFID-based locating systems have the ability to detect a tag even without direct line of sight (without metal or water). Thanks to this characteristics, it is possible to embed tags into the wall, ceiling, or pavement of a building, providing almost completely unobtrusive systems. Some scalability issues can rise when a large number of tags and readers are used: a complex system configuration and management is required. In active RFID system, the readers communicate with active tags equipped with internal batteries. Active tags are more expensive than passive tags but allow a longer communication range (tens of meters). Passive RFID tags have the advantage of the small size, high level of ruggedness, relatively inexpensive installation, and low maintenance needs; the theoretical detection range is within 10 m but the reflections can cause false readings which heavily affect the effectiveness of the localization. IPSs based on RFID systems have been widely explored and discussed in scientific literature [41 – 46]. While in WSN-based IPSs, anchor and mobile nodes are normally realized using the same hardware and exchange ranging information in a peer-to-peer fashion; in RFID-based IPSs, two distinct schemes are instead generally possible [44]: (1) in the ‘active’ scheme, the mobile node is implemented by a portable RFID reader, while tags are used as anchors; (2) in the ‘passive’ scheme, RFID tags are instead objects to be located while RFID readers are in known position. While the choice of the scheme to be applied depends on application requirements (e.g., the number of objects to locate, etc.), both schemes can be used with different types of tags (e.g., HF/UHF tags, active/passive tags, etc.), providing different performance in terms of maximum range (from a few centimeters to 10 m), propagation model, and costs [45]. Seco et al. [47] deployed a system that use nearly 70 active tags scattered into 55 rooms and covering 1, 600 m 2 area. Using RSSI method in this work. a 1.5 -m accuracy is obtained. Kimaldi [48] provides commercial systems for hospitals in locating application deployment. Personnel monitoring and access control have been obtained using wristbands and keyring tags. Daly et al. [49] deployed a passive RFID-based positioning system which has been embedded with passive RFID tags in pavement for navigation purpose. Kiers et al. [50] deployed a navigation system using arrays of passive RFID tags which have been installed under a carpet to provide <b>path</b> <b>indication</b> to blind people. Peng et al. [51] deployed an hybrid system composed by active RFID system and GNSS {{in order to make a}} positioning system that works seamlessly outdoor and indoor. By using Kalman filters in this work, a meter accuracy is obtained.|$|E

40|$|The high {{economic}} growth of formerly closed markets such as China, Russia, Poland, and the Baltic states has created vast business and growth opportunities for {{small and medium-sized}} enterprises (SMEs). Although this international business expansion of SMEs occurs in highly dissimilar business contexts and fierce international competition, it remains overlooked by research. Therefore, the main aim of this thesis is to contribute to an enhanced understanding of internationalization processes of SMEs by studying the overarching research question: What are the main features of internationalization processes of SMEs in an emerging market context? Three sub-problems are researched with regard to SMEs entering and taking off from emerging markets, as well as differences and similarities between these processes, in order to identify what features characterize them. Empirically, two surveys of 116 and 203 Swedish SMEs, respectively, with experiences of entry into emerging markets were conducted through standardized questionnaires via mail and on-site visits. In addition, case studies were conducted through interviews and observations of five internationalizing Chinese SMEs and four Chinese wholesale and retail market platforms. Five essays are compiled within the thesis and major findings and conclusions provide theoretical and empirical contributions to research on the internationalization processes of SMEs. With regard to the overlooked internationally experienced manufacturing SMEs from mature markets such as Sweden, theoretical advancements are made identifying the main concepts of their entry into emerging markets: entry node (the establishment point into the foreign business network); market-specific experiential knowledge; and perceived institutional distance. With regard to the internationally novel Chinese SMEs, these were seen to diverge from traditional internationalization <b>paths.</b> <b>Indications</b> were found of a parallel expansion abroad and at home, even using foreign markets as a springboard for further growth at home. The take-off node concerns the departure from an emerging home market, where a paradox of knowledge was found: the use of indirect export via a domestic intermediary facilitates the take off, but hinders further international expansion since no international experience or relationships are built up. Moreover, institutional distance was reduced due to collective internationalization through co-locating abroad. Generally, degree of maturity of the home market; as well as degree of internationalization and type of firm; are the main features behind differences between internationalization processes of SMEs in an emerging market context...|$|R

40|$|The {{order in}} which nodes are {{explored}} in a (depth-first) iterative deepening search strategy is principally determined by the condition under which a path of the search tree is cut off in each search phase.

In this paper, we develop an effective and computationally efficient termination criterion based on statistical methods of change detection. The criterion is local in the sense that it depends on properties of a path itself, rather than on the comparison with other paths. Loosely speaking, the idea is to take a systematic change in the (heuristic) evaluation of nodes along a search <b>path</b> as an <b>indication</b> of suboptimality.

Concepts characterizing quantum mechanics, as quantum entanglement or non-locality, were recognized and really understood in their implications only after the formulation of quantum theory. Teaching quantum mechanics in upper secondary school cannot leave out the consideration of the interlacing between formalism and concepts. On this peculiar point there are centered pilot experimentations in Italian last year upper secondary school classes. The experimentations are carried out following a learning/teaching quantum mechanics proposal developed in previous researches. According to this proposal students face quantum knots and concepts in the phenomenological context of light polarization.

30|$|The {{currently}} presented {{solutions to}} the coupled low CNR and 3 -D point reconstruction problem all have in common that the defect needs to be detected in all rotation projections. This need is difficult to fulfill as the defect CNR decreases. Furthermore, the defect can also fail to be detected in some rotation projection due to extreme X-ray interactions. These extreme interactions will eventually occur, though with low probability, due to the inherent statistical nature of radiographic inspection. However, this need of full detection is removed in the solution proposed here. Instead of being formulated as a vision system problem and solved by epipolar geometry as in[10, 11], it is explored using general tracking theory[13]. In tracking theory, the state (3 -D position) of an object (defect) is tracked by assigning measurements (indications) to it as time increases (rotation). In general, the measurements {{do not have to}} be present in all time points for the object to be successfully tracked. Therefore, a tracking theory approach will take advantage of the <b>path</b> of defect <b>indications</b> in the detector plane without making it a limitation by demanding the defect to be detected in all rotations. The main value of this work is that it considers the coupled low CNR and 3 -D point reconstruction problem from a general tracking theory point of view.|$|R
40|$|This {{case study}} {{illuminates}} {{an understanding of}} international willingness, why Statoil managers decide to seek or accept international assignments. As a global actor in an expanding global market, Statoil has identified a growing need of managers willing to travel outside the home country {{in order to fulfill}} the demands beyond national borders. This thesis puts emphasize on why they go, which expatriation path they choose, and in what way Statoil´s approach to expatriation serves the need of the expat and the organization. The study is based on 8 interview of Norwegian expatriates asked to reflect around their motives and experiences of being an expat on behalf of the organization. The analysis is based on these reflections, including Statoil s internal documents and the literature on the field. The theoretical framework is based on former empirical research, as well as a typology that includes the individual and organizational aspect of expatriation. The expatriation paths refer to the career orientation of the individual, which is discussed in line with individual motives, and Statoil s approach to international activity. The findings show that motives for expatriation are multiple. The expressed reasons were attached to the importance of job involvement, increased responsibility, the feeling of independency, and professional and personal development. In evaluation of career motives, the expat of Statoil did not couple the expatriation with a corporate career. Some stated that the acceptance of an international assignment was rather a risk career wise, grounded in distance to the network at home. They did however express a career motive of gaining international experience as something of personal value. Family and the dual career issue (spouse not willing to sacrifice their career) inhibit the international willingness of the expats, and location needed to fulfill certain criteria of personal and professional development, in addition to an ensured safety. The expatriation paths of the informants seemed to be diversified. The majority was placed within the Professional, recognized by independent individuals with a desire to acquire international experience for own gain. Statoil´s approach to expatriation is discussed to be ad hoc (Expedient) lacking a clarified expatriation philosophy, which causes the individuals to establish own personal reason tor taking on international assignments. The characteristics of Statoil s approach can make the organization dependent on a certain set of individuals, those willing to opt for a global career outside of the organizational core. The paths indicated by the informants are discussed to create needs and expectations of what an international expatriation will consist of. The expat focusing on professional and self-development will evaluate the risks and benefits in line with that. The expectations created between the expat and the organization might become ambiguous, increasing the probability for the expats to focus on the risks connected to the assignments. This is grounded in that the benefits are not clarified. Statoil s approach to expatriation compared to the informants <b>paths</b> gives <b>indications</b> that the organization pushes the international out of the national organization, grounded in lack of international competence transaction and utilization. This is also discussed to create a distance between the international and national part of the organization. It is pointed out that Statoil facilitate for the expat need to gain international experience and development, as well as their own need for task performance and knowledge transfer. They do not however, facilitate for their future need of establishing a global mindset that would lead to international willingness. As a result the global is something that is performed in Statoil, rather than a description of what the company is...|$|R

Elle porte sur le cheminement des carrières et touche aussi à la mobilité, à l'occupation et aux sources de recrutement. Who {{are the most}} capable executives in the Federal Public Service ? What are their experience characteristics ? How mobile have they been ? What are their academic backgrounds ? How does age relate to seniority and earning power ?These and related questions must be answered if manpower at upper government levels is to be managed more effectively. A fourteen-month study recently completed by the Personnel Consulting Division, Bureau of Management Consulting Services, Ottawa, has made a major contribution towards providing these answers. In the Public Service of Canada, {{at the time the}} study was made in July, 1965, there were some 625 executives with salaries ranging from $ 16, 000 to $ 30, 000. These are {{the men and women who}} fill the top three or four levels in each department or agency. Officially, they are known as Senior Officers 1, 2, 3. and Deputy Ministers (Deputy Heads). Data on 591 of these executives was obtained from files and various other sources, coded and fed into a Bendix G- 20 computer along with some 40 questions, the answers to which provided the following information :The typical executive is 51 years old and probably has a B. A. in Social Management Sciences (Arts, History, Political Science, Commerce, Sociology, etc.). While he could have graduated from any university in any province, the chances are greatest that he obtained his degree from the University of Toronto. He has had military service, reads a second language and joined the Public Service at a junior managerial level at 34 years of age, after having worked outside the Public Service for 11 years. At the time of his appointment to the executive level, he was 46 years of age and had 23 years of working experience. As of July 1, 1967, he had 28 years working experience and was earning $ 21, 000 a year. BASIC PERSONAL DATAIn considering the personal data in more detail, it was found that ages ranged from 30 to 69, with an average age of 51. 2. The average ages for the four levels (Senior Officer 1, 2, 3, and Deputy Minister — Deputy Head), were 50. 3 52. 6, 51. 7 and 54. 9 years respectively. The similarity of the averages implies career progression problems and also highlights the serious executive replacement problem the government faces in the next 10 - 15 years. A relatively high level of education was found among the government's top executives. 81 % of the executive population had at least one university degree, almost 30 % had a Masters degree and 14 % had Ph. D's. Some 31 % of these degrees were obtained in what was called Social and Management Sciences, 24 % in Economies and 16 % in the Physical Sciences. Other general but interesting facts included :(1) nearly 25 % of all executives won at least one scholarship while studying at university;(2) about 7 % of the executives had published at least one book;(3) some 31 % had published a paper or article;(4) 55 % had had military service;(5) figures from this study showed that 23 % of the total executive population was bilingual, with the percentage being considerably higher at the more senior levels (21 % of Senior Officer 1 and 37 % for Deputy Ministers — Deputy Heads). More recent figures (1968) show 26 % of the population bilingual, 23 % of Senior Officers 1 and 49 % of Deputy Ministers — Deputy Heads;(6) there were indications that those who reached the top moved into « managerial work » early in their careers as opposed to « individual » work requiring not significant supervisory responsibilities. CAREER PATHSInitially, it was determined that 15 % of the executives had spent their total working career in the Public Service of Canada (Public Service Only), 76 % had worked in the private sector prior to joining the Public Service (Private-Public), and 8. 6 % had joined the Service, left and then returned (Public-Private-Public). Thus, virtually 85 % of the executives had at one time been employed in some capacity other than in the Federal Public Service. On applying a « measure of progress » which was developed to these three career <b>paths</b> <b>indications</b> were that up to the time this study was carried out, the most rapid progression was achieved by those executives who had spent their total career in the Public Service. The average age on appointment was about 32 years. Almost 100 % of those who had spent their career in the Public Service, joined at the junior administrative level at about 25 years of age. However, of those who worked in the private sector first, some 31 %, joined the Public Service at an average age of 34 years and came in at the senior of higher level ($ 14, 000 plus). Close to 20 % entered directly at the executive level. SALARYAs of July 1, 1967, the average executive in the Public Service of Canada was earning $ 20, 927 a year. It should be noted that this is a total figure because Public Servants do not receive bonusses or stock options, and there is not profit to be « profit-shared ». For the three career path categories they were :Public Service Only $ 21, 297 Private-Public 20, 861 Public-Private-Public 20, 862 Subsequent to this study, the government released proposed salary scales for the executive levels ranging from a maximum of $ 23, 500 for Senior Executive Officers 1 up to a maximum of $ 40, 000 for certain Deputy Ministers. APPOINTMENT TO EXECUTIVE LEVELThe average age at time of appointment to the Senior Officer 1 level was 45. 6, to the SO 2 level 48, SO 3 level 47 and DM-DH 52. The similarity of these figures is interesting, since one would expect an executive to progress from the lowest to highest level. Also, based on today's standards, the ages would appear to be rather high. TRENDS IN AGE AT APPOINTMENTIt is generally believed that there has been a trend to appoint younger officers to the executive levels, but the study casts some doubt on the belief, certainly as far as government is concerned. However, more recent data obtained since the completion of the study indicates a change in the trend with the average ages of Senior Officers 1 appointed in 1966, 1967 and 1968, decreasing from 48 to 46 to 43 years respectively. EXPERIENCEThe average government executive has 28 years experience, almost two-thirds of which will have been spent in the Public Service. He will have spent about 15 % in the category we called « Business and Self-Employed » and 10 % in military service. However, there were indications that the more time executives spent in industry the less capable they were of adjusting to the political and Public Service atmosphere. Similarly it was found that extended career military service tended to reduce the rate of progress. RECRUITMENTPrior to July, 1967, about 76 % of all appointments to the executive level were made from within the individuals present department and about 9 % were from other departments. Therefore, some 85 % of all appointments were from within the Public Service. Of the remaining 15 %, some 10 % came from Industry and 5 % were recruited from Provincial Governments (2. 4 %), Universities (1. 5 %) and the Armed Forces (. 3 %). MOBILITYWithin the Public Service, a great interest has recently developed in the movement, or lack of movement, of management level personnel from one department to another. Traditionally, Public Servants have tended to remain in one department, rising to senior levels within what many claim to be a narrow occupational field. From the findings it appeared that moving from one department to another, within the Public Service, tended to improve the possibilities of achieving more rapid progress. A further analysis of movement after reaching the executive level showed that slightly more than 12 % of all executives changed departments at least once after reaching this level and 1. 3 % had changed twice. This figure is changing rapidly as over 30 % of the appointments made in 1968, at the executive level, resulted in movement between departments...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{of decades}} of research, the {{formation}} mechanism of daytime HONO {{is still not}} fully understood and {{little is known about}} the daytime behavior of HONO over soil and snow surfaces in polluted rural areas. HONO measurements in two regions heavily affected by oil and gas drilling activities (in Wyoming and Utah) show high levels of daytime HONO (above 500 pptv) during the wintertime. However, questions were raised about the reliability of wintertime HONO observations as recent studies show that many in-situ HONO measurement methods suffer from pernitric acid (PNA) interferences that overestimate HONO concentrations. The UCLA Long-Path (LP) Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (DOAS) instrument measured HONO and HONO gradients in the Uintah Basin (UB), a region highly impacted by oil and gas activities. The UCLA LP-DOAS system measured HONO on three light paths covering height intervals from 2 m to 31, 45, and 68 m above ground level (agl). Due to disparate meteorological conditions in 2012 and 2014, HONO was measured over soil in 2012 and over snow in 2014. HONO mixing ratios averaged 74 ppt in 2012. These levels are lower than HONO measured in polluted urban areas but comparable to levels measured in rural environments. Distinct daytime negative vertical gradients of HONO were observed in 2012, with higher levels of HONO measured on the lower than upper light <b>paths,</b> an <b>indication</b> that HONO had a surface source in 2012. HONO vertical profiles were retrieved using a novel least square minimization approach, in which the average mixing ratios of HONO along the light paths were simulated using a height dependent exponential function. The HONO vertical profiles, together with NOAA micrometeorological data were used to calculate HONO fluxes at 19 m agl. Sunny days hourly average HONO fluxes show that they follow the same trend as solar irradiance, with a maximum of (1. 7 ï¿½ 0. 3) x 1010 molec. cm- 2 s- 1 at noontime, supporting the idea of a photolytic surface HONO source in 2012. Analysis of HONO flux and photolytic surface HONO sources show that under conditions of high NO 2 levels, conversion of NO 2 on ground surfaces is most likely the source of daytime HONO. In contrast, on days with moderate NO 2 levels, photolysis of surface-adsorbed HNO 3 and nocturnal uptake of HONO followed by daytime acid displacement might play an important role; however, additional measurements are needed to confirm this theory. Comparison of the missing source of HONO (Punknwon) and HONO surface flux rate shows that the HONO surface flux rate accounts for (63 ï¿½ 32 %) of the Punknown throughout the day indicating that photolytic surface sources of HONO were the dominant sources of HONO in 2012. HONO mixing ratios measured in 2014 were on average 96 ppt. Comparison of DOAS HONO measurements with four in-situ instruments shows that the DOAS system consistently measured the lowest HONO levels. Preliminary analysis of PNA interferences shows that some in-situ measurements might overestimate HONO concentrations in the presence of PNA (average maximum concentration of 120 ppt measured around noontime), therefore, HONO DOAS were considered the reference measurements in the 2014 study. 2014 HONO vertical profiles also show higher HONO mixing ratios near the surface and a rapid decay of HONO mixing ratios with height. The sunny days hourly average HONO fluxes were also positive with a maximum HONO flux near noontime of (1. 1 ï¿½ 0. 7) x 1010 molec. cm- 2 s- 1. The sunny days hourly average HONO fluxes also follow a similar temporal trend as solar irradiance, further supporting the hypothesis of a photolytic surface HONO source in 2014. Due to insufficient data, we were not able to determine which photolytic surface HONO formation pathway dominated in 2014. However, we were able to determine that the measured 2014 HONO was most probably formed at the top of the snowpack and not in the firn. This result is supported by the surprisingly similar HONO fluxes measured in 2012 and 2014, which indicate that the HONO formation mechanisms during these two years were probably very similar. Comparison of the missing source of HONO (Punknwon) and HONO surface flux rate shows that HONO surface flux rate accounts for (54 ï¿½% 15) of the Punknown in the early morning and noontime, suggesting that HONO sources at noon and early morning are light dependent and are produced on the snow surface...|$|R
