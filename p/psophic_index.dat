Overall, the <b>psophic</b> <b>index</b> appears statistically as good a representation of the average annoyance as methods used in other countries; however, it does seem to reflect poorly the annoyance caused by light aircraft. Noise maps produced for Orly, Roissy, and the area around Paris are described. The range of applications and limitations of the <b>psophic</b> <b>index</b> are discussed...|$|E
