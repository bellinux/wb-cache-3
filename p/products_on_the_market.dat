5|$|Wallace {{had begun}} to promote a {{clothing}} line called Brooklyn Mint, which was to produce plus-sized clothing but fell dormant after he died. In 2004, his managers, Mark Pitts and Wayne Barrow, launched the clothing line, with help from Jay-Z, selling T-shirts with images of Wallace on them. A portion of the proceeds go to the Christopher Wallace Foundation and to Jay-Z's Shawn Carter Scholarship Foundation. In 2005, Voletta Wallace hired branding and licensing agency Wicked Cow Entertainment to guide the estate's licensing efforts. Wallace-branded <b>products</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>market</b> include action figures, blankets, and cell phone content.|$|E

500|$|In the 1970s and 1980s, Friskies-brand food {{products}} {{were introduced in}} the [...] "gourmet" [...] industry category, such as Bright Eyes and Chef's Blend. A sister brand Mighty Dog was introduced in 1973, and another sister brand Fancy Feast was produced in 1982. By 1985, Friskies' producer, Ralston Purina, was the largest manufacturer of pet food with a 14.5 percent market-share. Dry and wet {{food products}} specifically for kittens were introduced in 1988 and 1989 respectively. Fresh Catch, which contained only fish, {{was introduced in the}} early 1990s. According to industry analysts, competition in the pet food industry heightened by 1990. According to The Encyclopedia of Consumer Brands, the market was at [...] "a virtual saturation point" [...] with more than 400 pet food <b>products</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>market.</b> Friskies was one of six brands that controlled 80 percent of the pet food market and competed intensely with one another.|$|E

2500|$|While Huntington Beach {{retains its}} 15-year {{trademark}} of Surf City Huntington Beach, the Huntington Beach Conference and Visitors Bureau filed four applications {{to register the}} [...] "Surf City USA" [...] trademark in November 2004. The idea was to market the city by creating an authentic brand based on Southern California's beach culture and active outdoor lifestyle {{while at the same}} time creating a family of product licensees who operate like a franchise family producing a revenue stream that could also be dedicated to promoting the brand and city. A ruling by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office released on May 12, 2006 awarded three trademark registrations to the Bureau; nine additional trademark registrations have been granted since this time and ten other Surf City USA trademarks are now under consideration. One of the first products the Bureau developed to promote its brand was the Surf City USA Beach Cruiser by Felt Bicycles in 2006. The product has sold out every year in markets worldwide and created demand for a second rental bicycle model that will be marketed to resort locations across the globe starting in 2009. The Bureau now has dozens of other licensed <b>products</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>market</b> from Surf City USA soft drinks to clothing to glassware. As of April 2008, the Bureau had more than 20 licensing partners with over 50 different products being prepared to enter the market over the next 18 months. Four of the Bureau's registrations of the trademark are now on the principal register and the remaining ten trademark applications are expected to follow. The Bureau is actively considering registration of the Surf City USA trademark in several different countries and anticipates a growing market for its branded products overseas in coming years.|$|E

60|$|It {{must not}} be {{concluded}} that the uncompromising abolition of all censorship involves the abandonment of all control and regulation of theatres. Factories are regulated in the public interest; {{but there is no}} censorship of factories. For example, many persons are sincerely convinced that cotton clothing is unhealthy; that alcoholic drinks are demoralizing; and that playing-cards are the devil's picture-books. But though the factories in which cotton, whiskey, and cards are manufactured are stringently regulated under the factory code and the Public Health and Building Acts, the inspectors appointed to carry out these Acts never go to a manufacturer and inform him that unless he manufactures woollens instead of cottons, ginger-beer instead of whiskey, Bibles instead of playing-cards, he will be forbidden to place his <b>products</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>market.</b> In the case of premises licensed for the sale of spirits the authorities go a step further. A public-house differs from a factory in the essential particular that whereas disorder in a factory is promptly and voluntarily suppressed, because every moment of its duration involves a measurable pecuniary loss to the proprietor, disorder in a public-house may be a source of profit to the proprietor by its attraction for disorderly customers. Consequently a publican is compelled to obtain a licence to pursue his trade; and this licence lasts only a year, and need not be renewed if his house has been conducted in a disorderly manner in the meantime.|$|E
