5000|$|IEEE 802.1ad is an Ethernet {{networking}} standard informally {{known as}} QinQ {{and is an}} amendment to IEEE standard IEEE 802.1Q-1998. The technique {{is also known as}} <b>provider</b> <b>bridging,</b> Stacked VLANs, or simply QinQ or Q-in-Q. [...] "Q-in-Q" [...] can for supported devices apply to C-tag stacking on C-tag (Ethernet Type = 0x8100) but this has limited application in the modern methodology of network routing.|$|E
50|$|The now {{ubiquitous}} Ethernet {{was initially}} {{defined as a}} Local Area Network (LAN) technology to interconnect the computers within a small organization in which these host computers were very close in proximity to each other. Over the years, Ethernet {{has become such a}} popular technology that it became the default Data Link Layer (OSI Layer 2) mechanism for data transport. This created a need for extending the Ethernet from a customer LAN bridging domain to service provider MAN, also known as the <b>Provider</b> <b>bridging</b> domain. For this, a 4 byte S-Tag or Service Tag, a type of Virtual LAN tag, was added to the header of the Ethernet frame in IEEE 802.1ad standard. In the service provider domain, switching was based on S-Tag and destination MAC address, and C-tag was used to create virtual LAN within the customer domain. This technology is also known as QinQ or Q-tunneling.|$|E

40|$|The IEEE 802. 1 <b>Provider</b> Backbone <b>Bridges</b> (PBBs) {{specification}} defines {{an architecture}} and bridge protocols for interconnection of multiple <b>Provider</b> <b>Bridged</b> Networks (PBNs). <b>Provider</b> backbone <b>bridging</b> {{was defined by}} IEEE as a connectionless technology based on multipoint VLAN tunnels. PBB {{can be used to}} attain better scalability than <b>Provider</b> <b>Bridges</b> (PBs) {{in terms of the number}} of customer Media Access Control addresses and the number of service instances that can be supported. The Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) provides a framework for extending Ethernet LAN services, using MPLS tunneling capabilities, through a routed MPLS backbone without running the Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol (RSTP) or the Multiple Spanning Tree Protocol (MSTP) across the backbone. As a result, VPLS has been deployed on a large scale in service provider networks. This document discusses extensions to the VPLS Provider Edge (PE) model required to incorporate desirable PBB components while maintaining the service provider fit of the initial model. Balus, et al.

The current system {{is found to}} be lacking in terms of catering to users that are searching for internship positions while on the move. By proposing a mobile application, problems such as the lack of mobility in using the current system, absence of immediate notification, and limited coverage of service can be minimized. The methodology chosen to carry out this project is via the traditional Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) using Waterfall model. This model consists of phases such as requirements gathering and analysis, design, implementation, testing, and maintenance. However, the phases adopted for this project just covers until implementation as the later stages are deemed unnecessary. Findings and results of this project includes the achievement of each objective, by developing an System Requirements Specification (SRS) for the requirements phase, creating an System Design Document (SDD) for the design phase, and finalizing the mobile application for the implementation phase. Each of these objectives are documented to provide transparency and as reference for future revision. In the requirement gathering and analysis phase, six (6) use cases are identified – manage account, manage resume, view resume, view jobs, manage jobs, and check job application. All the said use cases are then used as a base to design the mobile application in the design phase through storyboards, and Design Class Diagram. In the implementation phase, the design is realized with coding the Android mobile application using Java. Lastly, future work of this project would mean the enhancement of mobile technologies by applying newer frameworks and methods...|$|E

5000|$|... 802.1aq is the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) sanctioned {{link state}} Ethernet control plane for all IEEE VLANs covered in IEEE 802.1Q. Shortest Path Bridging virtual {{local area network}} {{identifier}} (VLAN ID) or Shortest Path Bridging VID or (SPBV) provides capability that is backwards compatible with spanning tree technologies. Shortest Path Bridging Media Access Control (MAC) or (SPBM), (previously known as <b>Provider</b> Backbone <b>Bridge</b> SPBB) provides additional values which capitalize on <b>Provider</b> Backbone <b>Bridge</b> (PBB) capabilities. SPB (the generic term for both) combines an Ethernet data path (either IEEE 802.1Q in the case of SPBV, or <b>Provider</b> Backbone <b>Bridges</b> (PBBs) IEEE 802.1ah in the case of SPBM) with an IS-IS link state control protocol running between Shortest Path bridges (network-to-network interface (NNI) links).

5000|$|The {{industry}} {{has made a}} concerted effort to resolve the limitations of Ethernet in the WAN described above, so as to allow the use of [...] "native" [...] Ethernet technologies by network providers.The key roles have been played by the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE) 802.1 and 802.3 standards committees. IEEE 802.1 has addressed the scalability and management issues in the standards for <b>Provider</b> <b>Bridges</b> (802.1ad) and <b>Provider</b> Backbone <b>Bridges</b> (802.1ah). These standards allow for Ethernet networks of planetary scale. Associated standards (IEEE 802.1ag, and related ITU-T standard Y.1731) provide Operations and Maintenance (OAM) capabilities allowing connectivity verification, rapid recovery, and performance measurement. Current work on PBB-TE (802.1Qay: Provider Backbone Bridging-Traffic Engineering) is allowing such an Ethernet to be controlled by an external control or management application (for example, a network management application or a transport control plane such as GMPLS (IETF RFC 3945)), so as to allow the full range of traffic engineering policies and strategies to a network provider.|$|R
50|$|A {{number of}} {{solutions}} {{have been proposed}} to increase VLAN’s scalability. A first proposal, called Q-in-Q, also known as <b>Provider</b> <b>Bridge,</b> VLAN stacking or tag stacking, allows service providers to insert an additional VLAN tag (referred to as provider VLAN) in the Ethernet frame {{in order to identify}} the service, resulting in a unique 24-bit length label. While this solution enables one, in theory, to identify up to 16 million services (4094 * 4094), in reality, one provider VLAN is dedicated to one customer, and therefore the number of supported customers is still limited to 4094.|$|R
50|$|Proponents of Carrier-Class Ethernet argue Ethernet is {{the best}} for Metro Area Networks because all data traffic {{originates}} as Ethernet. Ethernet’s ubiquitous presence in the LANs worldwide drives down the cost of Ethernet as a technology. Thus, the use of Ethernet in a metro network allows service providers {{to take advantage of}} volumes that a much larger enterprise segment commands. Carrier-Ethernet Transport (CET) usually involves an evolution of conventional Ethernet and comprises multiple technology components. <b>Provider</b> Backbone <b>Bridges</b> (PBB) provides the scalability and a secure demarcation, while <b>Provider</b> Backbone <b>Bridge</b> Traffic Engineering (PBB-TE, commonly called PBT) provides for traffic-engineering and an effective transport for protected Ethernet services. Connectivity-Fault Management (CFM-OAM) provides the much-required OAM that makes Ethernet carrier grade.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Provider</b> Backbone <b>Bridge</b> Traffic Engineering (PBB-TE) is an {{approved}} telecommunications networking standard, IEEE 802.1Qay-2009. [...] PBB-TE adapts Ethernet technology to carrier class transport networks. It {{is based on}} the layered VLAN tags and MAC-in-MAC encapsulation defined in IEEE 802.1ah (<b>Provider</b> Backbone <b>Bridges</b> (PBB)), but it differs from PBB in eliminating flooding, dynamically created forwarding tables, and spanning tree protocols. Compared to PBB and its predecessors, PBB-TE behaves more predictably and its behavior can be more easily controlled by the network operator, at the expense of requiring up-front connection configuration at each bridge along a forwarding path. PBB-TE Operations, Administration, and Management (OAM) is usually based on IEEE 802.1ag. It was initially based on Nortel's Provider Backbone Transport (PBT).|$|R

40|$|Currently, LAN {{technology}} is predominantly Ethernet-based and offers packet-optimized switched technology. With more than 90 percent of Internet traffic originating from Ethernetbased LANs, efforts are underway to extend Ethernet beyond LANs into MANs and further into WANs. However, native Ethernet protocols need extensions or support from other technologies {{in order to}} succeed as MAN technology in terms of scalability, QoS, resiliency, OAM, and so on. The two emerging trends to carry Ethernet traffic across the MAN can be classified into native Ethernet (IEEE) protocol extensions, and encapsulation by another transportation technology such as MPLS networks. The goal is to offer new and challenging services such as virtual private LAN service, also known as transparent LAN service (TLS).
