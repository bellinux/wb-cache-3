25|$|West in 1930 {{and later}} P. G. A. H. Voigt (1940) {{showed that the}} early Wente-style {{condenser}} microphones contributed to a 4 to 6dB midrange brilliance or <b>pre-emphasis</b> in the recording chain. This meant that the electrical recording characteristics of Western Electric licensees such as Columbia Records and Victor Talking Machine Company in the 1925 era had a higher amplitude in the midrange region. Brilliance such as this compensated for dullness in many early magnetic pickups having drooping midrange and treble response. As a result, this practice was the empirical beginning of using <b>pre-emphasis</b> above 1,000Hz in 78rpm and rpm records.|$|E
25|$|When the Columbia LP was {{released}} in June 1948, the developers subsequently published technical information about the rpm microgroove long playing record. Columbia disclosed a recording characteristic showing {{that it was like}} the NAB curve in the treble, but had more bass boost or <b>pre-emphasis</b> below 200Hz. The authors disclosed electrical network characteristics for the Columbia LP curve. This was the first such curve based on formulae.|$|E
25|$|FM {{provides}} improved Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), {{as compared}} for example with AM. Compared with an optimum AM scheme, FM typically has poorer SNR below a certain signal level called the noise threshold, but above {{a higher level}} – the full improvement or full quieting threshold – the SNR is much improved over AM. The improvement depends on modulation level and deviation. For typical voice communications channels, improvements are typically 5-15dB. FM broadcasting using wider deviation can achieve even greater improvements. Additional techniques, such as <b>pre-emphasis</b> of higher audio frequencies with corresponding de-emphasis in the receiver, are generally used to improve overall SNR in FM circuits. Since FM signals have constant amplitude, FM receivers normally have limiters that remove AM noise, further improving SNR.|$|E
2500|$|A second {{series of}} {{approaches}} {{was designed and}} patented by Leonard R. Kahn. [...] The various Kahn systems removed the hard limit imposed {{by the use of}} the strict log function in the generation of the signal. Earlier Kahn systems utilized various methods to reduce the second-order term through the insertion of a predistortion component. [...] One example of this method was also used to generate one of the Kahn independent-sideband (ISB) AM stereo signals. [...] It was known as the STR-77 exciter method, having been introduced in 1977. [...] Later, the system was further improved by use of an arcsine-based modulator that included a 1-0.52E term in the denominator of the arcsin generator equation. [...] E represents the envelope term; roughly half the modulation term applied to the envelope modulator is utilized to reduce the second-order term of the arcsin [...] "phase"-modulated path; thus reducing the second-order term in the undesired sideband. [...] A multi-loop modulator/demodulator feedback approach was used to generate an accurate arcsin signal. [...] This approach was introduced in 1984 and became known as the STR-84 method. [...] It was sold by Kahn Research Laboratories; later, Kahn Communications, Inc. of NY. [...] An additional audio processing device further improved the sideband structure by selectively applying <b>pre-emphasis</b> to the modulating signals. [...] Since the envelope of all the signals described remains an exact copy of the information applied to the modulator, it can be demodulated without distortion by an envelope detector such as a simple diode. [...] In a practical receiver, some distortion may be present, usually at a low level (in AM broadcast, always below 5%), due to sharp filtering and nonlinear group delay in the IF filters of the receiver, which act to truncate the compatibility sideband – those terms that are not the result of a linear process of simply envelope modulating the signal as would be the case in full-carrier DSB-AM – and rotation of phase of these compatibility terms such that they no longer cancel the quadrature distortion term caused by a first-order SSB term along with the carrier. [...] The small amount of distortion caused by this effect is generally quite low and acceptable.|$|E
50|$|<b>Pre-emphasis</b> flag: The {{audio track}} was {{recorded}} with <b>pre-emphasis</b> (applies only to CD-DA). Used very rarely on Compact Discs.|$|E
50|$|<b>Pre-emphasis</b> is {{achieved}} with a <b>pre-emphasis</b> network {{which is essentially}} a calibrated filter. The frequency response is decided by special time constants. The cutoff frequency can be calculated from that value.|$|E
50|$|Some CDs are {{mastered}} with <b>pre-emphasis,</b> {{an artificial}} boost of high audio frequencies. The <b>pre-emphasis</b> improves the apparent signal-to-noise ratio by making {{better use of}} the channel's dynamic range. On playback, the player applies a de-emphasis filter to restore the frequency response curve to an overall flat one. <b>Pre-emphasis</b> time constants are 50µs and 15µs (9.49 dB boost at 20 kHz), and a binary flag in the disc subcode instructs the player to apply de-emphasis filtering if appropriate. Playback of such discs in a computer or 'ripping' to wave files typically {{does not take into}} account the <b>pre-emphasis,</b> so such files play back with a distorted frequency response.|$|E
50|$|A commercially {{unsuccessful}} {{noise reduction}} system used with FM radio {{in some countries}} during the late 1970s, Dolby FM was similar to Dolby B but used a modified 25 µs <b>pre-emphasis</b> time constant and a frequency selective companding arrangement to reduce noise. The <b>pre-emphasis</b> change compensates for the excess treble response that otherwise would make listening difficult for those without Dolby decoders.|$|E
50|$|The {{amount of}} <b>pre-emphasis</b> and {{de-emphasis}} used {{is defined by}} the time constant of a simple RC filter circuit. In most of the world a 50 µs time constant is used. In the Americas and South Korea, 75 µs is used. This applies to both mono and stereo transmissions. For stereo, <b>pre-emphasis</b> is applied to the left and right channels before multiplexing.|$|E
50|$|The {{official}} RIAA standard defines three time-constants with <b>pre-emphasis</b> rising indefinitely above 75 µs, but {{in practice}} this is not possible. When the RIAA equalization standard was written the inherent bandwidth limitations of the recording equipment and cutting lathe imposed their own ultimate upper limit on the <b>pre-emphasis</b> characteristic, so no official upper limit {{was included in the}} RIAA definition.|$|E

50|$|In {{high speed}} digital transmission, <b>pre-emphasis</b> {{is used to}} improve signal quality at the output of a data transmission. In {{transmitting}} signals at high data rates, the transmission medium may introduce distortions, so <b>pre-emphasis</b> is used to distort the transmitted signal to correct for this distortion. When done properly this produces a received signal which more closely resembles the original or desired signal, allowing the use of higher frequencies or producing fewer bit errors.|$|E
50|$|<b>Pre-emphasis</b> is {{commonly}} used in telecommunications, digital audio recording, record cutting, in FM broadcasting transmissions, and in displaying the spectrograms of speech signals.|$|E

50|$|Phase {{modulation}} is mathematically {{equivalent to}} direct Frequency modulation with a 6 dB/octave high-pass filter {{applied to the}} modulating signal. This high-pass effect can be exploited or compensated for using suitable frequency-shaping circuitry in the audio stages ahead of the modulator. For example, many FM systems will employ <b>pre-emphasis</b> and de-emphasis for noise reduction, {{in which case the}} high-pass equivalency of phase modulation automatically provides for the <b>pre-emphasis.</b> Phase modulators are typically only capable of relatively small amounts of deviation while remaining linear, but any frequency multiplier stages also multiply the deviation in proportion.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>pre-emphasis</b> at the {{transmitter}} enables to keep good quality of signal integrity. Because of this feature the set systems can use low-cost cables to achieve stable high-speed data transmission ...|$|E
50|$|In {{order to}} {{preserve}} stereo separation and signal-to-noise parameters, it is normal practice to apply <b>pre-emphasis</b> {{to the left and}} right channels before encoding, and to apply de-emphasis at the receiver after decoding.|$|E

5000|$|The Dolby preemphasis boosts the {{recorded}} {{level of the}} quieter audio signal at these higher frequencies during recording, effectively compressing the dynamic range of {{that portion of the}} signal, so that quieter sounds above 1 kHz receive a proportionally greater boost. As the tape is recorded, the relative amplitude of the signal above 1 kHz is used to determine how much <b>pre-emphasis</b> to apply - a low-level signal is boosted by 10 dB (Dolby B) or 20 dB (Dolby C). As the signal rises in amplitude, less and less <b>pre-emphasis</b> is applied until at the [...] "Dolby level" [...] (0 VU), no signal modification is performed.|$|E

50|$|An {{equalization}} filter is {{not designed}} to fully pass or block any frequency, but instead to gradually vary the amplitude response {{as a function of}} frequency: filters used as <b>pre-emphasis</b> filters, equalizers, or tone controls are good examples.|$|E
5000|$|Semiconductor {{vendors are}} {{incorporating}} signaling conditioning {{features such as}} pre-conditioning, <b>pre-emphasis</b> and equalization into their devices to help move signals at higher frequencies. Unfortunately, these techniques {{make it more difficult}} for traditional external instruments to take accurate measurements.|$|E
50|$|<b>Pre-emphasis</b> is {{employed}} in frequency modulation or phase modulation transmitters to equalize the modulating signal drive power {{in terms of}} deviation ratio. The receiver demodulation process includes a reciprocal network, called a de-emphasis network, to restore the original signal power distribution.|$|E
50|$|In addition, the {{baseband}} {{characteristics of}} the audio channel provided by voice radios are often quite {{different from those of}} telephone audio channels. This led to the need in some cases to enable or disable <b>pre-emphasis</b> or de-emphasis circuits in the radios and/or modems.|$|E
50|$|Because dbx Type I and Type II are {{broadband}} (single-band) companders (unlike Dolby-A's four bands), {{they are}} susceptible to audible noise modulation and other artifacts. To deal with this, both Type I and II use very strong high-frequency <b>pre-emphasis</b> of the audio signal in both the recording path and the control signal path. This causes the compander to 'back off' the gain in certain circumstances and reduce the audibility of noise modulation - even with this <b>pre-emphasis,</b> noise modulation can become audible when using very noisy media to begin with, such as the Compact Cassette format. In the control signal path, the dbx Type II process rolls off {{the high and low}} frequency response to desensitize the system to frequency response errors - since the roll-off is only in the control path, it does not affect the audible sound.|$|E
50|$|In {{a related}} area, around 1940 treble <b>pre-emphasis</b> {{similar to that}} used in the NBC Orthacoustic {{recording}} curve was first employed by Edwin Howard Armstrong in his system of Frequency Modulation (FM) radio broadcasting. FM radio receivers using Armstrong circuits and treble de-emphasis would render high quality wide-range audio output with low noise levels.|$|E
50|$|Upon investigation, Dolby {{found that}} many of the {{limitations}} in optical sound stemmed directly from its significantly high background noise. To filter this noise, the high-frequency response of theatre playback systems was deliberately curtailed… To make matters worse, to increase dialogue intelligibility over such systems, sound mixers were recording soundtracks with so much high-frequency <b>pre-emphasis</b> that high distortion resulted.|$|E
5000|$|CR4 {{involves}} two clauses: CL73 for auto-negotiation, and CL72 for link training. CL73 allows {{communication between}} the two PHYs to exchange technical capability pages, and both PHYs come to a common speed and media type. Once CL73 has been completed, CL72 starts. CL72 allows {{each of the four}} lanes' transmitters to adjust <b>pre-emphasis</b> via feedback from the link partner.|$|E
50|$|There is {{a version}} of A2 used in South Korea, {{compatible}} with the System M standard of TV transmission. In this case the second FM carrier is 14.25 times the line frequency, or about 224 kHz, above the first carrier; <b>pre-emphasis</b> is 75 microseconds; the stereo pilot tone frequency is 149.9 Hz; the bilingual pilot tone frequency is 276 Hz; and the second channel carries L-R (not R).|$|E

Columbia disclosed a recording characteristic showing {{that it was like}} the NAB curve in the treble, but had more bass boost or <b>pre-emphasis</b> below 200 Hz. The authors disclosed electrical network characteristics for the Columbia LP curve. This was the first such curve based on formulae.|$|E
50|$|In telecommunication, {{de-emphasis}} is the {{complement of}} <b>pre-emphasis,</b> in the antinoise system called emphasis. De-emphasis {{is a system}} process designed to decrease, (within a band of frequencies), the magnitude of some (usually higher) frequencies {{with respect to the}} magnitude of other (usually lower) frequencies in order to improve the overall signal-to-noise ratio by minimizing the adverse effects of such phenomena as attenuation distortion or saturation of recording media in subsequent parts of the system.|$|E
50|$|When the Columbia LP was {{released}} in June 1948, the developers subsequently published technical information about the 33 rpm, microgroove, long playing record. Columbia disclosed a recording characteristic showing {{that it was like}} the NAB curve in the treble, but had more bass boost or <b>pre-emphasis</b> below 150 Hz. The authors disclosed electrical network characteristics for the Columbia LP curve. Nevertheless, the curve was not yet based on mathematical formulae, at least not explicitly.|$|E
50|$|The {{amount of}} <b>pre-emphasis</b> {{that can be}} applied is limited by the fact that many forms of {{contemporary}} music contain more high-frequency energy than the musical styles which prevailed at the birth of FM broadcasting. They cannot be pre-emphasized as much because it would cause excessive deviation of the FM carrier. Systems more modern than FM broadcasting tend to use either programme-dependent variable pre-emphasis; e.g., dbx in the BTSC TV sound system, or none at all.|$|E
50|$|In the early-1970s, some {{expected}} Dolby NR {{to become}} normal in FM radio broadcasts and some tuners and amplifiers were manufactured with decoding circuitry. In 1971 WFMT started to transmit programs with Dolby NR, and soon some 17 stations broadcast with noise reduction, but by 1974 {{it was already}} on the decline. Dolby FM was based on Dolby B, but used a modified 25 µs <b>pre-emphasis</b> time constant and a frequency selective companding arrangement to reduce noise.|$|E
50|$|Although rarely used, {{there exists}} the {{capability}} for standardized emphasis in Red Book CD mastering. As CDs {{were intended to}} work on 14-bit audio, a specification for 'pre-emphasis' was included to compensate for quantization noise. After production spec was set at 16 bits, quantization noise became less of a concern, but emphasis remained an option through standards revisions. The <b>pre-emphasis</b> {{is described as a}} first-order filter with a gain of 10 dB (at 20 dB/decade) and time constants 50 μs and 15 μs.|$|E
