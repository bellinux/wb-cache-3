Clearances for spring travel were also improved for a smoother ride over all types of surfaces; the coil springs at each wheel were computer-selected to match the individual car's weight. Front disc brakes were now standard on all '73 Chevelles. John Z. DeLorean, Chevrolet's dynamic general manager during the design phase of the new Chevelles, left just as they were being announced. He departed in late September 1972 to start a brief stint as vice president of General Motors's Car and Truck Group. DeLorean left the new Chevelle an important legacy, though. He and Alex Mair, then Chevrolet's chief engineer, championed great handling. Critics compared the GM Colonnade line favorably to Ford and Chrysler intermediates which had unattractive styling and less interior room.|$|E

Steel building construction with the frame carrying the vertical loads initiated with the Home Insurance Building in Chicago, a 10 story structure constructed in 1884 with a height of 138 ft, often credited with being the first skyscraper. This and other tall buildings in Chicago spawned an entire generation of tall buildings, constructed with load bearing steel frames supporting concrete floors and non-load bearing, unreinforced masonry infill walls at their <b>perimeters.</b> <b>Framing</b> in these early structures typically utilized [...] "H" [...] shapes built up from plates, and [...] "L" [...] and [...] "Z" [...] sections.|$|R

50|$|So {{named for}} its {{resemblance}} to a ladder, the ladder frame {{is one of the}} simplest and oldest of all designs. It consists of two symmetrical beams, rails, or channels running the length of the vehicle, and several transverse cross-members connecting them. Originally seen on almost all vehicles, the ladder frame was gradually phased out on cars in favor of <b>perimeter</b> <b>frames</b> and unitized body construction. It is now seen mainly on trucks. This design offers good beam resistance because of its continuous rails from front to rear, but poor resistance to torsion or warping if simple, perpendicular cross-members are used. Also, the vehicle's overall height will be greater due to the floor pan sitting above the frame instead of inside it.|$|R

Thus Holden exports declined from 41,181 in 1973 to just 7,440 in 1975. Over the following years this lead to a large decline in export vehicle revenue needed to fund the HQ-HZ series replacement.

Metallic dissipative braces, namely buckling restrained braces (BRBs), may utilized as cost-effective rehabilitation schemes for existing RC framed buildings. The braces can be conveniently installed along the <b>perimeter</b> <b>frames</b> of the multi-storey buildings to lower the seismic demand on the existing structure and regularize its dynamic response. The design approach assumed herein postulates that the global response of the inelastic framed structure {{is the sum of}} the elastic frame (primary system) and the system comprising perimeter diagonal braces (secondary system). Displacement-based approaches were employed to design the BRBs and the needs to improve existing code provisions and design guidelines are emphasized.

This type of retrofit was evaluated for a four-story reinforced concrete (RC) frame office building damaged during the 1994 Northridge Earthquake. This structure had no serious damage in its <b>perimeter</b> moment <b>frames,</b> but experienced several punching shear failures at its interior slab-column connections.

Various aspects of the selection and design of steel bracing systems for the seismic retrofitting of reinforced concrete frames were considered. The bracing configuration within the exterior frame was varied and the effects of allowing the braces to behave outside of the elastic range were assessed. As part of the evaluation of various bracing configurations, both static and dynamic nonlinear analyses were performed.

2500|$|The C4 {{represented}} a clean {{break from the}} previous generation of Corvette with a completely new chassis and modern, sleeker styling. Since emissions regulations were still changing and electronic engine management was in its infancy, horsepower was, compared to earlier generations, low. Therefore, the primary design emphasis, {{at least for the}} launch, was on handling and braking, with all-independent suspension with light-weight suspension and wheels, and all new brakes with aluminum calipers. The front suspension saw the C3's coil springs replaced by a transverse fiberglass mono-leaf spring, which was only 1/3 of the weight of the coil springs while also introducing an anti-roll bar-like effect on the front. The price of this no-holds-barred emphasis on handling was ride comfort, especially with the Z51 performance and handling package. The C4 did not use separate body-on-frame construction like its predecessors. [...] Instead, it used what GM termed a [...] "uniframe", which consisted of a traditional <b>perimeter</b> <b>frame,</b> with the door posts, windshield frame, halo, and the rear portion of the floor pan integrated into one welded assembly. [...] This was not a [...] unibody assembly, as none of the exterior body panels were structural members. [...] Due to a styling decision to use a targa top instead of T-tops, there was no structural member tying the windshield frame to the halo as on the C3. [...] This required extremely tall side rails on the frame to maintain chassis rigidity, and as a result, the door sills were quite deep, with entry and exit likened by contemporary auto journals to a [...] "fall in and climb out" [...] experience. [...] The targa top bolted into place, becoming a structural component, rather than simply latching on like T-tops. [...] Despite the tall frame rails, the C4 was prone to rattles and squeaks, especially with the targa top removed. [...] The emergency brake, located between the door sill and the drivers seat, was moved lower and toward the rear of the car in 1988 for easier entry and exit.|$|E

40|$|Observations {{after the}} 1994 Northridge {{earthquake}} revealed the limited ductility capacity of welded connections.

Furthermore, variations in the ductility capacity of 2 Ì 2 improved 2 Ì 2 welded connections reflect the effects of inevitable variations in the weld quality. It has also been demonstrated that bolted frames originally designed for gravity loads retain their lateral load resisting capacity up to interstory drift ratios of three percent. In this study, the possibility of improving the earthquake resistance of structural steel buildings by utilizing the stable and ductile response of bolted frames was investigated. Based on a satisfactory limit to interstory drift ratio set as two percent, the earthquake resistances of representative three- and nine-story steel buildings designed for regions of high seismicity {{were found to be}} inadequate. Reductions in the interstory drift ratios were obtained by increasing the stiffness of bolted interior frames.

40|$|Recently, {{building}} structures become larger and taller {{to satisfy the}} social and economical needs. Various works {{have been carried out}} to study the behavior of these structures and increase the lateral stiffness. The advances in three-dimensional structural analysis and computing resources have allowed the efficient and safe design of increasingly taller structures. Tall buildings are being increasingly designed with structural system comprising of flat slab or flat plate system and shear wall with or without perimeter beams. The behavior of this system under lateral loads is dependent on numerous parameters such as the height of the building, floor plate size, size and location of the shear wall, flat slab spans. The flexural stiffness of floors may have some influence on the lateral response of the structure. Under lateral loading floor and roof systems in reinforced concrete buildings act as diaphragms to transfer lateral loads to the vertical lateral force resisting system.

Natural frequencies and damping ratios are experimentally investigated by operational modal analysis; the estimated modal properties were employed to calibrate the numerical finite element structural model. The retrofitting strategy encompasses the use of Buckling Restrained Braces (BRBs). Such braces can be conveniently installed along the <b>perimeter</b> <b>frames</b> of the multistorey buildings to lower the seismic demand on the existing structure and regularize its dynamic response.

Asuite of code-compliant natural strong motion recordswas selected and employed to perform inelastic response history analyses. A probabilistic approach has been employed to investigate the performance of the structure under critical events and to ensure its acceptable performance during its entire lifetime. The seismic fragility is calculated by implementing an Incremental Dynamic Analysis (IDA) using the method of multiple-stripe analysis. The outcomes of the inelastic analyses show that the existing structure exhibits extremely poor strength capacity and energy dissipation. It is also demonstrated that, under moderate and high magnitude earthquakes, the damage experienced by the retrofitted structural system is located in the added dampers; the response of the existing RC structure is chiefly elastic...|$|R
