40|$|Anatomically {{distinct}} {{areas within}} the basal ganglia encode flexible- and stable-value memories for visual objects (Hikosaka et al., 2014), but {{an important question}} remains: do they receive inputs from the same or different brain areas or neurons? To answer this question, we first located flexible and stable value-coding areas in the caudate head (CDh) and caudate tail (CDt) of two rhesus macaque monkeys, and then injected different retrograde tracers into these areas of each monkey. We found that CDh and CDt received different inputs from several cortical and subcortical areas including temporal cortex, prefrontal cortex, cingulate cortex, amygdala, claustrum and thalamus. Superior temporal cortex and inferior temporal cortex <b>projected</b> <b>to</b> both CDh and CDt, with more CDt-projecting than CDh-projecting neurons. In superior temporal cortex and dorsal inferior temporal cortex, layers 3 and 5 <b>projected</b> <b>to</b> CDh while layers 3 and 6 <b>projected</b> <b>to</b> CDt. Prefrontal and cingulate cortex <b>projected</b> mostly <b>to</b> CDh bilaterally, less to CDt unilaterally. A cluster of neurons in the basolateral amygdala <b>projected</b> <b>to</b> CDt. Rostral-dorsal claustrum <b>projected</b> <b>to</b> CDh while caudal-ventral claustrum <b>projected</b> <b>to</b> CDt. Within the thalamus, different nuclei <b>projected</b> <b>to</b> either CDh or CDt. The medial centromedian nucleus and lateral parafascicular nucleus <b>projected</b> <b>to</b> CDt while the medial parafascicular nucleus <b>projected</b> <b>to</b> CDh. The inferior pulvinar and lateral dorsal nuclei <b>projected</b> <b>to</b> CDt. The ventral anterior and medial dorsal nuclei <b>projected</b> <b>to</b> CDh. We found little evidence of neurons <b>projecting</b> <b>to</b> both CDh and CDt across the brain. These data suggest that CDh and CDt can control separate functions using anatomically separate circuits. Understanding the roles of these striatal projections will be important for understanding how value memories are created and stored...|$|R

Outlays from state trust fund accounts are <b>projected</b> <b>to</b> exceed revenues and interest income by $16.0 billion in FY 2011 and $15.1 billion in FY 2012. State trust fund account balances, net of loans, are <b>projected</b> <b>to</b> continue to fall, from -$27.4 billion at the end of FY 2010 to -$62.7 billion at the end of FY 2013, before starting to grow again.
