5|$|Plasmid {{stabilising}} toxin-antitoxin {{systems have}} been used as examples of selfish DNA as part of the gene centered view of evolution. It has been theorised that toxin-antitoxin loci serve only to maintain their own DNA, {{at the expense of the}} host organism. Other theories <b>propose</b> <b>the</b> systems have evolved to increase the fitness of plasmids in competition with other plasmids. Thus, the toxin-antitoxin system confers an advantage to the host DNA by eliminating competing plasmids in cell progeny. This theory was corroborated through computer modelling. This does not, however, explain the presence of toxin-antitoxin systems on chromosomes.|$|E

After the general engagement had been in progress for some time, Philip had his army perform a wheeling manoeuver, with the right wing withdrawing, and the whole line pivoting around its centre. At the same time, wheeling forward, the Macedonian left wing attacked the Thebans on the Greek right and punched {{a hole in the}} Greek line. On the Greek left, the Athenians followed Philip, their line becoming stretched and disordered; the Macedonians then turned, attacked and routed the tired and inexperienced Athenians. The Greek right wing, under the assault of the Macedonian troops under Alexander's command, then also routed, ending the battle.|$|E

In 2005, Ryan and Senator John Sununu of New Hampshire introduced the Social Security Personal Savings Guarantee and Prosperity Act, also known as the Ryan-Sununu plan.

Versions of the plan were included in Ryan's later budget proposals.|$|E

30|$|In this article, we have <b>proposed</b> <b>the</b> {{variable}} packet {{splitting method}} in the multi-relay cooperative communications with DF and DAF. <b>The</b> <b>proposed</b> method obtains <b>the</b> space diversity {{by using the}} multi-relay cooperative communications. Moreover, since <b>the</b> <b>proposed</b> method uses <b>the</b> error correcting code and interleaving, obtains also the coding gain. However, if the channel condition of relays is bad, the system performance is degraded. Therefore, <b>the</b> <b>proposed</b> method splits <b>the</b> packet to obtain the space and coding gains. Moreover, <b>the</b> <b>proposed</b> method uses <b>the</b> selection parameters α and γ to obtain the maximum gains. As a result, <b>the</b> <b>proposed</b> method obtains <b>the</b> maximum coding gain due to the space diversity.

The first to <b>propose</b> <b>the</b> cranial crests of lambeosaurines related to temperature regulation was Wheeler (1978).

The next people to publish a related idea were Maryanska and Osmólska, who realized that like modern lizards, dinosaurs could have possessed salt glands, and cooled off by osmo-regulation. In 2006 Evans published an argument about the functions of lambeosaurine crests, and supported why this could be a causing factor for the evolution of the crest.|$|E
