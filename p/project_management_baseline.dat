The investigation has been narrowed to the author’s own division of work within the banking organisation {{in order to help}} with devising means to assist with the <b>project</b> <b>management</b> office. This <b>project</b> <b>management</b> office was setup in late 2009 and is thus a relatively new addition to the division. This banking sector project office has never been reviewed in terms of its <b>project</b> <b>management</b> maturity. An understanding of the operational aspects of the banking sector <b>project</b> <b>management</b> office is required in order to ascertain the level of <b>project</b> <b>management</b> maturity. A brief description is given, within this document, of the banking sector project office team, as well as the associated roles and responsibilities. An overview is also given with regards to the project sizes, project lifecycles, as well as the required documentation. There are various methods available to determine the <b>project</b> <b>management</b> maturity level, such as: Capability Maturity Model Integration, Portfolio, Programme and <b>Project</b> <b>Management</b> Maturity Model, and Kerzner <b>Project</b> <b>Management</b> Maturity Model. The mentioned <b>project</b> <b>management</b> maturity models will be investigated and discussed. The PRINCE 2 method is chosen as the method to determine the <b>project</b> <b>management</b> maturity level of the <b>project</b> <b>management</b> office. This method is broken down into assessable sections, where each section is then dealt with in terms of a questionnaire. The results of the questionnaire are combined and analysed.
