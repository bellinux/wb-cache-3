40|$|The {{relationships}} between urban tree cover {{and land use}} in the main urban areas of Hong Kong were studied {{with the aid of}} aerial photographs. Some relevant terms and concepts were defined and elaborated. The relative proportions of artificial surfaces, tree canopy cover and additional growth spaces in 12 land uses were estimated. Three essential attributes of the tree cover, namely the canopy configuration, tree habitat and tree-building propinquity, were also evaluated. Land uses were divided into three groups according to canopy cover. For each land use, the distribution and characteristics of the tree cover were discussed with reference to urban planning, urban history and urban morphology. The densely built-up city left scarce <b>plantable</b> spaces which are concentrated on remnant slopes embedded within the urban matrix, the parks and open spaces, and the low-density residential districts. Outside these areas, the tree canopies are mainly isolated and discrete entities spatially segregated from the built-up framework. Different land uses furnish <b>plantable</b> spaces of different geometry which to a large extent moulds the canopy configuration. The implications for urban planning and landscaping in new development and renewal areas are discussed. Some measures to augment and rejuvenate amenity greenery are proposed.

40|$|Urban {{greening}} contributes notably {{to environmental}} quality, quality of life, human health, and ecosystem services in cities. Worldwide, cities are making efforts to enhance urban greening to achieve urban sustainability. South cities are often beset by green space deficit {{especially in the}} old cores and neighbourhoods. Urban renewal and new developments could fail to bring relief. Lacking appropriate institutional setup and scientific capability pose intractable bottlenecks. Innovative public policies and greening technologies are needed for long-term improvements. Amalgamating natural and social sciences in a multidisciplinary approach and reinforcing the link between science and public policies could overhaul greening endeavours in south cities. The {{public and private sectors}} must work in tandem to insert <b>plantable</b> spaces and amenity vegetation into the urban fabric. Based on extensive field studies in north and south cities, and relevant urban ecological concepts, key domains are proposed for a sustainable urban greening action plan. Green spaces with high degree of connectivity forming a green network to permeate the city are hallmark features of the preferred naturalistic design. Preservation of natural ecosystems and creation of green areas with high nature contents and rich biodiversity offer a new dimension to green space design. The benefits of urban greening could be effectively manifested in economic terms to complement conventional ecological-environmental emphasis. Outstanding trees could receive high-order conservation efforts, and trees in construction sites warrant enhanced protection. Tree transplanting demands an overhaul in concepts and skills. Tree care needs to be upgraded in tandem with relevant professionals and workers. Improving roadside tree planting and maintenance offers a cost-effective way to upgrade the townscape.

40|$|Trees {{in cities}} face a severe {{limitation}} of <b>plantable</b> space and an exceptionally stressful growing environment. In Hong Kong, shortage of developable land has relegated trees {{to a lower}} priority and intensified urban impacts on them, relative to other cities. The vicissitudes of urban growth and trees since the founding of Hong Kong are reviewed, and eleven specific conflicts between urbanization and trees in Hong Kong are described. Redevelopment of existing buildings has raised site coverage by impervious surface and taken away ground-level planting space within and around affected lots. Infilling of relatively low-density areas mainly for government and institutional land-uses has increased development density and removed existing greenery and planting spaces. Road construction and improvement has widely damaged roadside trees and removed valuable and conspicuous greenery. Proliferation of underground utilities has fuelled the contest for usable space and precluded planting in many places. Widespread and frequent roadside trenching, associated with utilities and the laying of cable television and telecommunication networks has incurred massive root damage at roadsides. Poor soil quality commonly beset by chemical and physical constraints has caused chronic poor tree performance. Intrusion into urban parks and other green enclaves by buildings and roads has usurped the limited stock of green spaces. Encroachment into peri-urban woodlands has deprived the city of fringing mature greenery with conservation, landscape and amenity worth. <b>Plantable</b> space in reclaimed lands has been intensively used with inadequate allocation for trees. Protection and preservation of champion specimens has lacked statutory means and a coordinated policy. Reinforcement and demolition of stone walls has destroyed many large trees on unique mural habitats. Quality of arboricultural practice is poor, particularly in the private sector. Possible solutions to these limitations in Hong Kong are suggested, and have implications for other cities facing similar problems. published_or_final_versio...|$|E
40|$|Sweetpotato {{serves as}} human food, animal feed and {{industrial}} raw {{material in the}} production of sugar syrups, ethanol and flour for confectionaries. It produces more food energy per unit area and unit time than any other major food crop and has higher protein, vitamin and mineral contents compared to cassava. However, sweetpotato has a class of need and this is the survivability and availability of planting materials. It is harvested after a period of about 4 - 5 months and planting materials must be available for the next growing season, which can be 5 - 7 months later, especially in those sub-Saharan African regions with extended drought period. Most farmers are losing 4 - 6 weeks of the growing period {{at the beginning of the}} rainy season while they re-establish sufficient vine production for planting, obtaining initial limited planting material from residual plants, re-sprouting roots, or secondary growth of harvested fields, limiting sweetpotato production areas. Low tunnel screen covered structure was used to assess vine production rate in three (3) harvests of Apomuden and Ogyefo, compared with opened raised beds, as control, in a randomised complete block design experiment with 3 replications in SARI‘s experimental fields. Apomuden recorded the highest average vine lengths of 81. 6 and 59. 6 cm under tunnel cover and on opened beds, at 6 WAP, 65. 2 and 64. 6 cm the harvest at 11 WAP, and 81. 3 and 65. 7 cm long at 16 WAP, respectively.

40|$|Abstract. Integrated Pest Management is {{a system}} that {{combines}} cultural, biological and chemical technologies to reduce insect, fungal and weed populations to levels below those that result in economic damage. Nursery managers in the southern United States currently use many practices to control pests of southern pine seedlings. Over the last three decades, improvements in chemical, cultural, and biological pest control practices have increased seed efficiency (defined as the number of <b>plantable</b> seedlings produced divided by the number of pure live seed sown) and reduced the percentage of production costs associated with pest control. As crop values increase, the economic thresholds for applying control measures decrease. However, since the statistical power of most trials in bareroot nurseries is low, the likelihood of experiments that detect ‘‘real’ ’ treatment dif-ference (e. g. those that consistently increase seed efficiency to the point where economic returns are affected) will be low. This paper describes some current practices in southern pine nurseries and provides some economic injury levels for various pest control treatments...|$|E
40|$|Trees and {{high-density}} {{urban development}} {{do not seem}} to be compatible in Hong Kong. The grave shortage of developable lands and the resultant tightly packed urban fabric have apparently left few <b>plantable</b> niches. A historical review of urban trees provides a baseline to gauge recent changes marked by rampant tree constraints and decimation. The contributions of the different government departments in greening some quarters of the city are assessed through the relevant policies and changing urbanisation patterns. The attitude of private developers and their combined effects on the cityscape are evaluated with reference to the quality and quantity of urban trees. The existing diffuse legislation and controls on tree preservation are difficult to enforce and cannot bring effective protection in private developments. To arrest further damage and to bring about a greener city, collaborative government and private-sector inputs and departure from past attitudes are needed. An assessment of the city matrix for potential planting and preservation suggests many opportunities for improvement. Recommendations on the approaches and methods to implement tree planting programmes are suggested. © 1993. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Trading {{in carbon}} credits from {{afforestation}} and reforestation is foreshadowed by the Kyoto Protocol. Human-induced sinks can compensate for human-induced emissions, but given ongoing combustion of fossil fuels, {{there needs to be}} an ongoing contribution from sinks.

40|$|Urban Hong Kong {{is covered}} by high building, road, and {{population}} densities. Its urban morphology is inherently not conducive to extensive or high-grade greening. Recent renewal of old areas has squeezed out some limited interstitial <b>plantable</b> space, although in new development areas modest spaces have been earmarked for greenery. The study aims at evaluating the major constraints to urban trees and their companion urban soil envelopes and at providing specific recommendations to improve tree management in the city. The analysis covers the above-ground confinements that dampen tree performance, the less tangible but rather difficult institutional restrictions that impose a somewhat unnecessary lid on tree planting, the multiplicity of players and stakeholders involved in urban-tree management that militates against coordination and cooperation, the widespread occupation of underground space by utility lines often {{to the exclusion of}} trees, and the extremely poor quality of urban soils that are often used without amelioration to support tree growth. The management recommendations furnish practical suggestions and hints to improve the short- and long-term welfare of trees in terms of quality, quantity, and spatial distribution.

40|$|Abstract-Successful {{regeneration}} of bottomland hardwoods {{relies on}} the production of vigorous, <b>plantable,</b> and affordable stock by commercial nurseries. To quantify nursery cultural influences on subsequent field performance of cherrybark oak (Quercus pagoda Raf.), seedlings were grown in a greenhouse in small, medium, or large containers for three months with or without fertilization. In December 1994, seedlings were planted at a bottomland site near Milledgeville, GA with or without removal of the container soil as a method to reduce transport and planting costs. Estimated costs per thousand seedlings for these practices were about $ 1225, $ 560, and $ 185 for large, medium, and small containers, respectively. A 30 percent profit margin was added to each price. The incremental cost of fertilization per thousand seedlings was about $ 12, $ 6, and $ 2 for large, medium, and small treatments, respectively. Cost savings from container soil removal were substantial for the large containers, and savings decreased with decreasing container size. Five years after planting, survival of seedlings from large containers (97 percent) was significantly greater than that from small containers (85 percent). Soil removal was associated with reductions in seedling survival, {{but only in the}} absence of fertilization.

Three fertilizer treatments of 140, 560, and 1, 120 kg/ha of 10 - 10 - 10 fertilizer were established in combination with the two mycorrhizal treatments. Ten equal applications of NH 4 NO 3, totaling 1, 680 kg/ha, were added to all the treatment plots during the growing season. For six of the eight species, the VAM seedlings showed greater height and diameter growth and dry weight production than nonmycorrhizal seedlings. Sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marsh.) and walnut (Juglans nigra L.) displayed no height growth differences. Only boxelder (Acer negundo L.), of the inoculated seedlings, consistently responded to increases in fertilizer level. Nonmycorrhizal seedlings generally showed increased growth with increased fertilizer applications. The growth of the nonmycorrhizal seedlings at the higher fertilizer levels was not sufficient to produce <b>plantable</b> seedlings for artificial regeneration. A difference in host preference for the Glomus spp. symbionts is suggested by the large difference in infection between species. Infection values varied from a high of about 80 % for sycamore (Platanus occidentalis L.), green ash (Fraxinus pennsylvanicaMarsh.), and boxelder to a low of 40 % for sugar maple and sweetgum. The growth data suggest that high quality seedling stock of most of these hardwood tree species can be obtained in nurseries as long as cultural practices in the nursery encourage VAM development...|$|E

The expansion of the cultivated area is actively occurring in the eastern Indonesian, region of East Seram, Maluku Province. One of the prospective commodity crop planned for the region is sugarcane (Saccharum spp.). The method used for evaluating land for determining optimal land use is land suitability analysis, a combination of multi-criteria decision making and GIS mapping. We used multi-criteria decision making to identify the optimal area for sugarcane plantations and sugar industries, using criteria to identify land suitable for sugarcane growing in three suitability classes, very suitable, suitable and unsuitable, subject to achieving economic viability for a sugar mill. Mill viability was based on the ability of the planted area to support at least a minimum number of cane milling days per years (150 /y), and a daily production target of ≥ 8, 000 tonnes cane crushed per day (TCD).

Guangzhou city, the premier metropolis of south China, has been established for 2800 years, and {{has a long history}} of urban greening and heterogeneous land use. Five urban districts, which represent old, middle-aged and young stages of development and cover the bulk of the city's built-up zones, form the study area. Interpretation of aerial photographs is used as a basis to classify the urban forest into three types, and to design a sampling scheme for studying trees in urban parks, institutional grounds and roadsides. District history has bequeathed a plethora of configurations in terms of buildings, roads and land uses, accompanied by <b>plantable</b> spaces of dissimilar dimensions, geometry and quality. The districts display diverse tree attributes such as frequency, density and species diversity. Young districts, with lower density, more institutional uses and wider roads, present more opportunities for greening. Recent shifts in landscape fashion have introduced a significantly different treescape. A few exceptionally large parks and institutional sites play a pivotal role in the city's tree assets. Parks, roadsides and institutional forests have different tree-stocking rates and species assemblages. Implications for future planting and management of urban trees in different situations, and for the greening of other cities in China, and other developing countries, are explored. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

40|$|While {{there has}} been a large {{increase}} in investment in plantation forestry in New Zealand by smallholders during the past decade, there are still many smallholders who have chosen not to become involved in this land use or who are using only a portion of their potentially planted land for forestry. To understand why this is the case, this paper studies two issues, the differences between those who have and have not established plantation forests, and the factors that explain the proportion of land used in forestry by small landholders who have identified that they have potentially <b>plantable</b> land. Land used for forest plantations is treated as a two-step decision process, where first a landowner must decide whether they would consider planting trees at all and then secondly how much land would be planted in trees. With this approach, a double hurdle model is used to study planting decisions. Using survey data obtained from 344 landholders in four South Island districts, the results indicate that property-specific factors, such as property size, years of ownership, and ownership being part of a partnership, as well as landowner characteristics such as perceptions of tax policies being favourable for forestry, off farm income level and expectations of increasing log prices were correlated with the decision whether to establish a plantation forest. The factors determining the extent of land identified as being potentially profitable in forestry actually being used for plantation forestry include forestry tax policy, expectations of increasing log prices, regional location of a property, owner’s annual income, and area used in sheep and beef production. forestry investment, land use change, non-industrial forests, double hurdle model, Land Economics/Use, Q 15, Q 23,...|$|E

A suite of 111 species had been selected for suitable dimensional and amenity attributes to fit the harsh and tight roadside sites, and to avoid the currently rampant discordance between trees and habitats. Environmental conditions within and in the vicinity of individual PPS, with an emphasis on plantable-space geometry, were matched with species characters. A strategy was adopted to maximize final biomass, floristic variety and ornamental functions especially attractive flowers and seasonal changes. A 5 year master planting plan was designed with site-specific species recommendations and a schedule giving priority to tree-deficient and readily-available localities. The landscape in 398 more streets will be improved with congruous trees. A similar green-planning strategy could be applied to other cities with a congested urban morphology. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Four {{attributes}} of stem quality: number of nodes 1, diameter 2, and stem weight 3 per 25 -cm <b>plantable</b> stake (PS), and the stake position 4 were investigated in field trials at Blocks 4, 18 and 24 of the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA) Onne, Ajibode, Ibadan, Federal College of Agriculture, Akure and Dogodawa, Zaria, Nigeria {{to evaluate the}} relationship between good quality cassava planting material and the stem and root yields and to assess the best stake position that gives the best stem and root yields. Forty three cassava mosaic disease resistant varieties were planted during the 2005 and 2008 planting seasons in a randomized complete block design with four replicates while two varieties out of the 43 in trial (TME 7 and TMS 30572) were evaluated in a uniformity trial. The studies found {{that there is a}} gradient of number of nodes per stake, weight and diameter in cassava stem from the base to the shoot tip. All cuttings of 25 -cm long {{do not have the same}} number of nodes (varied from 5 - 16 nodes), diameter (1. 8 - 3. 1 cm) and weight (48 - 110 g). There was no significant difference (p> 0. 05) in yield among stakes from the basal, basal-middle, top-middle and top of the stem. The effect of the quality of stakes planted was shown on the percentage missing stands and was 18. 2 % in research farms, 32. 7 % (trained personnel farms) and 42. 0 % (traditional farms). Selection of quality stakes did not have any effect on the yields, but very necessary for improving root yield of cassava. Peer Revie...|$|E
40|$|Urban {{development}} in Hong Kong {{has left a}} tightly-packed town plan with little intervening space for trees. Limitation of available land {{in relation to a}} large population underscores the fundamental constraint. The planting tradition adopted since the founding of the city some 150 years ago was implemented when the urban matrix was still relatively porous. Recent intensification of development has imposed increasing pressure on the meagre tree stock. Pervasive shortage of <b>plantable</b> space is aggravated by its poor quality which deteriorates with land-use changes. Setting back building lots for amenity planting, if applied on a large scale, should bring permeation of greenery. Existing roadside and offroad habitats, including areas containing high-calibre specimen trees and woodland plots, are often lost to vehicular-traffic infrastructure and other community needs. Proliferation of underground utilities restricts chances for roadside trees. Frequent trenching to repair buried services and recently to install a territory-wide cable-television and communication network brings havoc to roots, and premature decline. Soils at planting sites, especially at roadsides, are beset by problems such as: shallowness, too many boulders and stones, excessively coarse texture, compaction, nutrient deficiency, alkaline reaction and pollution. Outmoded nursery practice, ineffective quality control, and lack of research on suitable cultivars have allowed widespread use of substandard planting materials. Whereas trained arboriculturists are employed by the government to look after public trees, the shortage of expertise and professionalism in the private sector degrades the quality of tree work. The poor match between species selection and planting-site conditions, and a large backlog of surgery work need to be addressed. Preservation efforts are not commensurate with the scarcity of outstanding trees, with worthwhile ones continually lost due mainly to construction activities. Transplanting, the protection of champion trees and those dwelling on old stone walls should be more earnestly adopted measures. The community needs to modify its rather apathetic attitude towards urban trees and furnish effective statutory measures to plan, plant and preserve trees to effect long-term improvement. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|The {{gardens of}} {{suburban}} homes in a low-density housing estate in Hong Kong, Fairview Park, provided {{opportunities for the}} cultivation of private trees. The hypothesis that residential tree populations are different from public ones in terms of composition, structure, spatial pattern, and tree-habitat relationship was explored. A study was initiated to evaluate {{the nature of this}} tree population, and its resulting landscape and planning implications. Data on habitat conditions, species composition, tree structure and performance were collected through a field survey of front gardens. Some 1087 houses scattered throughout 18 streets at a sampling intensity of 22 % with 2345 trees were studied in detail. The data were analyzed with the help of microcomputer database and statistical programs, and a number of tree and habitat indices, correlation and chi-squared association computations were performed. Some results were compared with those of a previous local street-tree survey. Most species were introduced rather than indigenous. The biotic diversity suprisingly high, totalling 65 species, and was strongly represented by conifers, fruit trees and palms, but weakly by shade, foliage and flowering trees. Ten dominant species were accompanied by many minor ones, mainly of exotic origin, seldom planted elsewhere in urban Hong Kong. At present, most trees are small and comfortably accomodated by the <b>plantable</b> spaces, but a number of potentially large species may in time overtax the small garden niches. The majority were well cared for and showed little signs of arboricultural maladies. Most gardens held less than five trees. There is a tendency to adopt a variety of species within individual households. Gardens with less trees had a relatively higher species diversity, and half of the species occurred as solitary specimens (one tree per garden). Species planted as multiples (over one tree per garden) were of two contrasting groups, namely a few popular and many uncommon. Such a spatial pattern could possibly be explained by the operation of two opposing determinants, namely, conformity versus individualism, within the overriding confines of restricted growing spaces. Tree distribution by streets indicated a clear pattern of spatial congregation. Propinquity of homes (in the same street) could lead to the adoption of similar species. More species in a street resulted in higher inter-house but not intra-house variability. Analysis of tree-habitat association confirmed that the major controlling factor was garden size, and the ill effects of cramping too much biomass within the limited niches. The long-term prospects of the trees and the treescape were assessed {{in the light of the}} findings. Implications for landscape planning and management of the estate, and of similar suburban developments locally and in the region, were discussed. © 1993. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Attempts to {{identify}} the contribution of street trees to the overall urban forest of a city have been rare and lack consensus on how to measure that contribution – percentage of trees, percentage of canopy cover, or percentage of leaf area. The actual numeric values presented in the literature also vary over a broad range and often are based on estimates, extrapolations from aggregated data, or simply stated with no empirical data referenced. This study was undertaken to evaluate the contribution of street trees to canopy in Portland, Oregon. The study involved both visual and digital analysis of multi-band aerial images, field observation, and GIS analysis involving several ancillary data themes. The strategy was to calculate the street tree component (STC) of the urban forest canopy within a sample of areas {{in the city and}} generalize that pattern to the whole city. The analysis indicates that street trees constitute 3. 4 % of the whole study area. In commercial / industrial areas the value drops to only 1. 1 % and in residential areas rises to 4. 8 %. For the overall study area the STC of the canopy is 17. 2 %, a value {{in the middle of the}} range of values found in the published literature. In commercial / industrial areas we found a value of 23. 7 % and a value of 16. 6 % for residential areas. Residential areas are overall better treed than commercial / industrial areas, but do not rely on street trees to contribute as large a percentage to overall canopy as do commercial / industrial areas. Available planting space in the right-of-way (ROW) is much more nearly constant (or independent of land cover) than the amount of planting space available inside a block. Therefore, the STC tends to vary inversely with the total amount of vegetated area. As the vegetated (read, <b>plantable)</b> area decreases, the ROW becomes a more significant space for planting and the STC increases. Conversely, as the vegetated area increases, the ROW becomes a less significant space for planting and the STC decreases. For both residential and commercial / industrial areas, the percentage of street tree area within the total canopy varies from locale to locale. The relatively small sampling used in this study suggests that neighborhood age and physical characteristics influence the STC in a given neighborhood, particularly for residential areas. Analysis allowed division of the study area into five residential neighborhood groups that attempt to reflect local differences. A larger / more detailed sampling would allow for improved delineation, perhaps below the level of neighborhood. Three generalized spatial patterns emerge for Portland. Street tree canopy as a percent of area seems to follow an east-west gradient, with lower values to the east and higher values to the west. Street trees as a component of the total canopy takes on an inverted-U shape, with higher values in the Inner Eastside and lower values to the east and to the west. The overall tree canopy category takes on just the opposite pattern – a standard-U – with lower values in the Inner Eastside and higher values to the east and west. This study represents a useful starting point for understanding the dynamics of an important and highly visible component of the urban forest...|$|E
