40|$|Abstract—Bicycle {{configuration}} is not {{as large}} as those of motorcycles or automobiles, while it indeed composes a complicated dynamic system. People’s requirements on comfortability, controllability and safety grow higher as {{the research and development}} technologies improve. The shock absorber affects the vehicle suspension performances enormously. The absorber takes the vibration energy and releases it at a suitable time, keeping the wheel under a proper contact condition with road surface, maintaining the vehicle chassis stability. Suspension design for mountain bicycles is more difficult than that of city bikes since it encounters dynamic variations on road and loading conditions. Riders need a stiff damper as they exert to tread on the pedals when climbing, while a soft damper when they descend downhill. Various switchable shock absorbers are proposed in markets, however riders have to manually switch them among soft, hard and lock positions. This study proposes a novel design of the bicycle shock absorber, which provides automatic smooth tuning of the damping coefficient, from a predetermined lower bound to theoretically unlimited. An automatic quick releasing valve is involved in this design so that it can release the peak pressure when the suspension fork runs into a square-wave type obstacle and prevent the chassis from damage, avoiding the rider skeleton from injury. This design achieves the automatic tuning process by innovative <b>plunger</b> <b>valve</b> and fluidic passage arrangements without any electronic devices. Theoretical modelling of the damper and spring are established in this study. Design parameters of the valves and fluidic passages are determined. Relations between design parameters and shock absorber performances are discussed in this paper. The analytical results give directions to the shock absorber manufacture...|$|E

Although {{they have been}} widely used for decades, there are many issues regarding the fluid dynamics of the pump that have not been fully investigated. A project was conducted at Sandia National Laboratories to develop unimproved understanding of the fluid dynamics inside a sucker rod pump. A mathematical flow model was developed to predict pressures in any pump component or an entire pump under single-phase fluid and pumping conditions. Laboratory flow tests were conducted on instrumented individual pump components and on a complete pump to verify and refine the model. The mathematical model was then converted to a Visual Basic program to allow easy input of fluid, geometry and pump parameters and to generate output plots.

Technical condi- tion was determined Ã¢Â€Â˜on lineÃ¢Â€Â™ by analysing the measured value of the signal of homogenization pressure. This signal contains - among other things - some information about the condition of the <b>plunger</b> pumpÃ¢Â€Â™s <b>valve</b> unit.

50|$|A {{hydraulic}} jack uses a liquid, which is incompressible, that is {{forced into a}} cylinder by a pump plunger. Oil is used since it is self lubricating and stable. When the plunger pulls back, it draws oil out of the reservoir through a suction check valve into the pump chamber. When the plunger moves forward, it pushes the oil through a discharge check valve into the cylinder. The suction valve ball is within the chamber and opens with each draw of the <b>plunger.</b> The discharge <b>valve</b> ball is outside the chamber and opens when the oil is pushed into the cylinder. At this point the suction ball within the chamber is forced shut and oil pressure builds in the cylinder.|$|R

30|$|The commercially {{available}} GV (Parker Hannifin Corporation) is a magnetically activated solenoid valve. The valve opens by pulsing current through a solenoid, creating {{a magnetic field}} that lifts a <b>plunger</b> from the <b>valve</b> orifice. The opening time for a well-adjusted valve depends on the valve temperature, but is typically between 80 and 150 μs (FWHM). The also {{commercially available}} JV (R.M. Jordan, Co.) {{is based on the}} original design by Gentry and Giese [32], and is operated by passing a high (3 - 4 kA) current in opposite directions through two metal strips. Due to the magnetic repulsion, the strips bend apart, opening the valve. This valve has a specified opening time of about 50 - 60 μs (FWHM). Finally, the operation of the NPV is based on the Lorentz force on a current-carrying strip in a magnetic field [31]. A very light metal alloy strip is placed between two permanent magnets. When a current is pulsed through the strip, the Lorentz force lifts the strip from the valve orifice, opening the valve. Since the strip has a mass of only 23 mg, opening times of 20 μs (FWHM) or shorter can be obtained.|$|R

40|$|The {{design and}} test results for {{two types of}} pulsed gas valves are presented. The valves, a piezo valve and a solenoid {{actuated}} valve, must have exceedingly long lifetime to support gas-fed pulsed electric thruster operation for missions of interest. The performance of both valves was tested, with both demonstrating the capability to throttle the gas flow rate while maintaining low leakage levels below 10 (exp - 3) sccs of He {{at the beginning of}} valve lifetime. The piezo valve varies the flow rate by changing the amount that the valve is open, which is a function of applied voltage. This valve demonstrated continuous throttlability from 0 - 10 mL/s, with opening and closing times of 100 microsecond or less. The solenoid actuated valve flow rate changes {{as a function of the}} inlet gas pressure, with demonstrated flow rates in these tests from 2. 7 - 11 mL per second. The valve response time is slower than the piezo valve, opening in 1 - 2 ms and closing in several ms. The solenoid actuated valve was tested to one million cycles, with the valve performance remaining relatively unchanged throughout the test. Galling of the sliding <b>plunger</b> caused the <b>valve</b> to bind and fail just after one million cycles, but at this point in the test the valve sealing surface leak rate still appeared to be well below the maximum target leak rake of 110 (exp - 3) sccs of He...|$|R
40|$|Tutorialpg. 221 Compared to {{leading edge}} {{technologies}} such as high speed turbomachinery, reciprocating pumps {{may appear to be}} a simple technology: A reciprocating plunger causes liquid to be drawn from a low pressure manifold through the suction check valves, and expelled into a high pressure manifold through the discharge check valves. However, the interaction of flow, valve dynamics, and the acoustics of the pump and piping system can generate high amplitude pressure pulsation, causing severe vibration and reliability problem in some systems. The effects of improperly operating valves, and the successful resolution of such problems with valve design modifications are examined. Since the pump vales are operated by the action of the fluid, valve components (including the spring, valve body, valve disc shape, and sealing surfaces, etc.) must be carefully selected to ensure that the valves open and close at the appropriate times. Problems associated with valve dynamics include over pressure spikes at the opening of discharge valves, under pressure spikes {{at the opening of the}} suction valves, high noise levels, and excessive wear of valve components. Severe over pressure spikes have been known to cause fatigue failures of pump working barrels, connecting rods, bearings, and even drive-train components. Under pressure spikes can cause cavitation that can also lead to <b>plunger</b> and <b>valve</b> failures, due to pitting damage. High level valve noise is usually indicative of sever impacts associated with the opening and closing of the valves. Impacts at the valve closing are sometimes referred to as valve hammer and can result in damage to the sealing surfaces. Impacts at the valve opening, which may be identified by damage to the back side of the valve disc, are due to the over pressure and under pressure spikes which can result in fatigue failures of the components. Excessive valve wear can also be experienced when the valve disc material is not suitable for the pumping conditions. The use of field data coupled with a computer model to analyze the valve dynamics will be presented. Using this tool, the effect of various valve modifications such as changes in sealing surfaces, valve lift, spring preload, and spring stiffness can be observed. Instrumentation and data analysis techniques to evaluate these problems will also be discussed. The effects of modifications to valves (including changes in lift, spring preload, spring construction and stiffness, valve disc geometries, etc.) will be examined using data from actual systems...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{development}} of a mathematical model for an air brake system in the presence of leaks. Brake systems in trucks are crucial for ensuring the safety of vehicles and passengers on the roadways. Most trucks in the US are equipped with S-cam drum brake systems and they are sensitive to maintenance. Brake defects such as leaks are a major cause of accidents involving trucks. Leaks in the air brake systems affect braking performance drastically by decreasing the peak braking pressures attained and also increasing the time required to attain the same, thereby resulting in longer stopping distances. Hence {{there is a need for}} detecting leaks in an air brake system. In this thesis, a mathematical model for an air brake system in the presence of leaks is developed with a view towards developing an automatic leak detection system in the near future. The model developed here builds on an earlier research at Texas A&M University in which a "fault free" model of an air brake system is developed, i. e., a mathematical model of an air brake system that predicts how the pressure in the brake chamber evolves as a function of the brake pedal input when there are no leaks in the air brake system. In order to develop a model for an air brake system in the presence of leaks, one must characterize a "leak". A leak may be characterized by the location and its size. Since the pipes are short, the location of the leak does not significantly affect the evolution in the brake pressure as much as its size. For this reason, "effective area" of the leak was chosen as a characteristic of the leak. It was estimated by fitting an empirical relation for leak with leak flow measurement data. The supply pressure and effective area of leak comprised the inputs to the model along with the displacement of the foot pedal (treadle <b>valve</b> <b>plunger).</b> The model was corroborated with the experimental data collected using the setup at Texas A&M University...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{deals with}} the development of a model-based diagnostic system for air brake systems that are widely used in commercial vehicles, such as trucks, tractor-trailers, buses, etc. The performance of these brake systems is sensitive to maintenance and hence they require frequent inspections. Current inspection techniques require an inspector to go underneath a vehicle to check the brake system for possible faults, such as leaks, worn brake pads, out-of-adjustment of push rods, etc. Such inspections are time consuming, labor intensive and difficult to perform on vehicles with a low ground clearance. In this context, the development of an onboard/ handheld diagnostic tool for air brakes would be of significant value. Such a tool would automate the brake inspection process, thereby reducing the inspection time and improving the safety of operation of commercial vehicles. In this dissertation, diagnostic schemes are developed to automatically detect two important and prevalent faults that can occur in air brake systems ?????? leaks and out-of-adjustment of push rods. These diagnostic schemes are developed based on a nonlinear model for the pneumatic subsystem of the air brake system that correlates the pressure transients in the brake chamber with the supply pressure to the treadle valve and the displacement of the treadle <b>valve</b> <b>plunger.</b> These diagnostic schemes have been corroborated with data obtained from the experimental facility at Texas A&M University and the results are presented. The response of the pneumatic subsystem of the air brake system is such that it can be classified as what is known as a ??????Sequential Hybrid System??????. In this dissertation, the term ??????hybrid systems?????? is used to denote those systems whose mathematical representation involves a finite set of governing ordinary differential equations corresponding to a finite set of modes of operation. The problem of estimating the push rod stroke is posed as a parameter estimation problem and a transition detection problem involving the hybrid model of the pneumatic subsystem of the air brake system. Also, parameter estimation schemes for a class of sequential hybrid systems are developed. The efficacy of these schemes is illustrated with some examples...|$|R
