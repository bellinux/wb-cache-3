We present here the results of a bulk rock multi-elemental study of 27 <b>peridotites</b> drilled at Sites 1272 and 1274 (to the south and the north of the FZ, respectively). The <b>peridotites</b> comprise mainly of harzburgites with minor dunites. Clinopyroxene (Cpx), which is interstitial and interpreted as secondary, is observed in Site 1274 <b>peridotites.</b> Sites 1272 and 1274 <b>peridotites</b> have low Al 2 O 3 contents (91. 5), and bulk rock trace elements compositions mostly below 0. 1 x primitive mantle (PM). These <b>peridotites,</b> and in particular Site 1272 <b>peridotites,</b> represent the most depleted <b>peridotites</b> yet sampled at a slow spreading ridge. Their compositions indicate high degrees of partial melting and melt extraction. A single open-system melting event (melting plus percolation of melts produced within upwelling mantle) can explain their highly depleted yet linear chondrite-normalized REE patterns, characterized by a steady depletion from HREE to LREE. Late melt-rock reactions and precipitation of Cpx explains the slightly less depleted compositions of Site 1274 <b>peridotites.</b> Hence, the differences in composition between Sites 1272 and 1274 <b>peridotites</b> do not provide evidence for regional variations in the degrees of partial melting from the south to the north of the FZ.

40|$|The mantle is {{the most}} voluminous part of the Earth. However, mantle petrologists usually {{have to rely on}} {{indirect}} geophysical methods or on material found ex situ. In this review paper, we point out the in-situ existence of oceanic core complexes (OCCs), which provide large exposures of mantle and lower crustal rocks on the seafloor on detachment fault footwalls at slow-spreading ridges. OCCs are a common structure in oceanic crust architecture of slow-spreading ridges. At least 172 OCCs have been identified so far and we can expect to discover hundreds of new OCCs as more detailed mapping takes place. Thirty-two of the thirty-nine OCCs that have been sampled to date contain <b>peridotites.</b> Moreover, <b>peridotites</b> dominate in the plutonic footwall of 77 % of OCCs. Massive OCC <b>peridotites</b> come from {{the very top of the}} melting column beneath ocean ridges. They are typically spinel harzburgites and show 11. 3 – 18. 3 % partial melting, generally representing a maximum degree of melting along a segment. Another key feature is the lower frequency of plagioclase-bearing <b>peridotites</b> in the mantle rocks and the lower abundance of plagioclase in the plagioclase-bearing <b>peridotites</b> in comparison to transform <b>peridotites.</b> The presence of plagioclase is usually linked to impregnation with late-stage melt.

5|$|The Chetco River {{flows through}} the ancient Klamath Mountain terrane, which is between 400 and 100million years old, the oldest rocks in Oregon. The Klamath {{microcontinent}} was originally located beneath the ocean near southern California before separating {{hundreds of millions of}} years ago. Plate tectonics pushed the microcontinent north, and bits of granite, sea floor sediment, subduction zones, and coral reefs gradually accreted into small islands. Between 212 and 170million years ago, a massive volcanic arc erupted on the Klamath microcontinent, binding the islands together in a single block. The Klamath microcontinent went through a period of intense tectonic activity known as the Siskiyou orogeny roughly 170 to 165million years ago. The process was strong enough to force sedimentary rocks deep into the Earth's crust, melting them into large plutons of granite, which rose slowly to the surface. Shortly after, a large portion of sea floor was thrust over the older Klamath terranes; much of it is still visible atop Vulcan and Chetco peaks.

Subsequently the CW <b>peridotites</b> were re-fertilized within the lithospheric mantle by mid-Proterozoic or older silicate melts that generated M 2 CW garnet pyroxenites and adjacent garnet <b>peridotites.</b> Clinopyroxenes from these bodies show large variation in 143 Nd/ 144 Nd, but nearly constant 87 Sr/ 86 Sr, suggesting autometasomatism of depleted mantle by LREE-enriched, Rb-poor melts derived from equally depleted mantle. NW <b>peridotites</b> lack mid-Proterozoic garnet pyroxenite intrusions, but M 2 NW garnet-rich assemblages that exsolved from relict M 1 megacrysts may have equilibrated {{at the same time as}} the M 2 CW refertilization. Sm-Nd and Lu-Hf mineral apparent isochron ages from both suites range from 1. 75 to ca. 0. 87 Ga. The age spectrum suggests continuous diffusion among M 2 minerals that formed ≥ 1. 75 Ga ago punctuated by partial re-equilibration during a 1. 0 Ga thermal event. Much later the NW <b>peridotites</b> were transferred from the mantle wedge into the crust as the WGR was subducted into the mantle during the ca 400 Ma Scandian Orogeny. Further subduction heterogeneously metasomatized and recrystallized the NW <b>peridotites</b> to form M 3 NW garnet, clinopyroxene and, where metasomatism was pervasive, new M 3 NW radiogenic (87 Sr/ 86 Sr> 0. 715), LIL-enriched minerals (phlogopite, amphibole) and microdiamond consistent with invasion by hydrous fluids from the enclosing Proterozoic gneisses. Nine young apparent ages (672 to 424 Ma), all from exsolved or recrystallized garnets within NW <b>peridotites,</b> represent mixed (M 2 NW and M 3 NW) apparent ages.

Subsequently, the gabbros as well as their boundaries with the <b>peridotites</b> are cut by high-T mylonitic shear zones, and then by thick cataclastic shear zones.

40|$|Abstract. Petrographic and petromagnetic {{studies of}} a {{representative}} collection of <b>peridotites</b> from various localities on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge {{have been carried}} out. It is shown that secondary magnetization of <b>peridotites</b> comes into being usually prior to the onset of serpentinization, {{in the course of}} the preceding medium-temperature metamorphic recrystallization of the rocks. The formative conditions of magnetite in <b>peridotites</b> can be inferred from its integrated grain size, quantified from petromagnetic characteristics. Grain size of magnetite that is formed during serpentinization of oceanic <b>peridotites</b> averages 3 – 4 µm. Increased mean grain size of magnetite (20 µm or more) is suggestive of its having crystallized in the course of medium-temperature metamorphism of <b>peridotites.</b> Based on our own and published data, an increased mean grain size of the magnetic phase is characteristic of most oceanic <b>peridotites,</b> which provides a further proof of extensive development of medium-temperature metamorphic recrystallization of these rocks both within transform faults and on rift valley slopes.

The Cr-poor megacryst suite is represented by olivine, orthopyroxene, clinopyroxene and garnet. The megacrysts show features which are unique to Jagersfontein, a particularly notable feature being the absence of ilmenite and ilmenite-silicate intergrowths. Major element and REE compositions of the Cr-poor megacryst suite are consistent with a magmatic fractionation sequence. ⁸⁷Sr/⁸⁶Sr and ¹⁴³Nd/¹⁴⁴Nd ratios of the Cr-poor clinopyroxene megacrysts indicate a source {{similar to that of}} non-DUPAL ocean island basalts. Deformed <b>peridotites</b> at Jagersfontein have high calculated temperatures of equilibration (1132 - 1361 °C), which are slightly lower but which overlap with those of the Cr-poor megacryst suite. Both the high-temperature <b>peridotites</b> and the Cr-poor megacrysts yield similar pressures of equilibration (51 ± 2 kbar), indicating their association with a thermal perturbation and supporting a close spatial association between them. Olivine and pyroxenes in the high-temperature <b>peridotites</b> appear homogeneous, but compositional gradients were observed in several garnet porphyroclasts. These garnets show rim enrichments in TiO₂ and Na₂O. This zonation in the garnets is evidence for enrichment of the deformed <b>peridotites</b> shortly before kimberlite eruption. This enrichment is likely to be due to interaction with the megacryst magma. In addition, the high-temperature <b>peridotites</b> show a general enrichment in Fe, Ti, Na and Al with decreasing Ca/(Ca+Mg). Such features support a magmatic aureole model, in that temperature and degree of enrichment might be expected to increase with proximity to the megacryst magma body. ⁸⁷Sr/⁸⁶Sr and ¹⁴³Nd/¹⁴⁴Nd ratios of clinopyroxene separates from the high-temperature <b>peridotites</b> are similar to those from oceanic <b>peridotites.</b> Modal abundances and olivine forsterite contents of the high-temperature <b>peridotites</b> are consistent with an origin as residues of partial melting events involving basalt formation. It is suggested that partial melting events, in the upper mantle beneath Jagersfontein, resulted in the formation of a depleted protolith which underplated the base of the Archaean lithosphere.
