40|$|In this paper, I {{hypothesize that}} <b>players</b> <b>with</b> {{less than six}} years of experience, thus not able to pursue free agency, face {{monopsony}} power {{in terms of their}} contracts. Furthermore, I believe that <b>players</b> <b>with</b> less than six years of experience have lower salaries than <b>players</b> <b>with</b> the same MRP and more than six years of experience. The arbitration process, I hypothesize, does not rid <b>players</b> <b>with</b> less than six years of experience from monopsonistic behavior. Through this research I hope to measure the impact of monopsony power on baseball <b>players</b> <b>with</b> less than six years of experience {{to gain a better understanding}} of the baseball market...|$|R

5000|$|ISOD {{classified}} A9 players may {{be found}} in this class. [...] The class they play in will be specific to the location of their amputations and their lengths. <b>Players</b> <b>with</b> hip disarticulation in both legs are 3.0 point <b>players</b> while <b>players</b> <b>with</b> two slightly longer above the knee amputations are 3.5 point <b>players.</b> <b>Players</b> <b>with</b> one hip disarticulation may be 3.5 point players or 4 point <b>players.</b> People <b>with</b> amputations longer than 2/3rds the length of their thigh when wearing a prosthesis are generally 4.5 point <b>players.</b> Those <b>with</b> shorter amputations are 4 point players. At this point, the classification system for people in this class then considers the nature of the hand amputation by subtracting points to assign a person to a class. A wrist disarticulation moves a player down a point class while a pair of hand amputations moves a player down two point classes, <b>with</b> <b>players</b> <b>with</b> upper limb amputations ending up as low as a 1. point player.|$|R

5|$|Although {{the player}} can use {{firearms}} to kill monsters, Resident Evil emphasizes evasion over fast-paced combat {{by providing the}} <b>player</b> <b>with</b> limited ammunition. The player has {{a limited amount of}} health which decreases when attacked by monsters. Nevertheless, players can regain their health by collecting and using herbs, which can be mixed with other herbs to increase their healing effect. Some monsters can also infect the <b>player</b> <b>with</b> a poisoning effect, which gradually depletes the player's health over time until the poison is cured with serum or special herbs. Zombies that are defeated but not decapitated or burned eventually revive and mutate into much deadlier opponents.|$|E
