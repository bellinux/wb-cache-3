40|$|Abstract. Mechanical fatigue {{experiments}} are performed for <b>piston</b> pin <b>seat,</b> and the stress-strain {{response of the}} piston overall structure is analyzed by the elastic-plastic FEA. An estimated formula of the fatigue life is put forward by amending the Manson-Coffin formula {{on the basis of}} studying the fatigue behavior of <b>piston</b> pin <b>seat.</b> The Newton iterative algorithm is applied to calculate the modified formula, and the mechanical fatigue life of <b>piston</b> pin <b>seat</b> is obtained. By comparison the predicted value with the experimental results, the feasibility of estimated formula is validated...|$|R
50|$|An angle <b>seat</b> <b>piston</b> valve is a pneumatically-controlled valve with a piston {{actuator}} providing linear actuation {{to lift a}} seal off its seat. The seat is set {{at an angle to}} provide the maximum possible flow when unseated. Angle <b>seat</b> <b>piston</b> valves are particularly suited to applications where high temperatures and large flowrates are required, such as steam or water. When used in reverse some models of angle <b>seat</b> <b>piston</b> valve will eliminate water hammer when operated.|$|R

5000|$|Like other {{pressure}} relief valves (PRV), pilot operated relief valves (PORV) are used for emergency relief during overpressure events (e.g., a tank gets too hot and the expanding fluid increases the pressure to dangerous levels). The difference between PORV and conventional PRV is that pilot valves use system pressure to seal the valve. A PRV typically uses a spring to hold the disc or <b>piston</b> on <b>seat.</b> The essential parts of a PORV are a pilot valve (or control pilot), a main valve, a pilot tube, the dome, a disc or <b>piston,</b> and a <b>seat.</b> The volume above the piston is called the dome.|$|R

5000|$|A <b>piston</b> is <b>seated</b> {{inside each}} {{cylinder}} by several metal piston rings [...] fitted around its outside surface in machined grooves; typically two for compressional sealing {{and one to}} seal the oil.

For example, {{a part in}} a construction which moves up and down will preferably be made of a light weight material. Nevertheless the workpiece may still have areas where it touches other parts that move differently. It is precisely these spots which are subjected to wear. By covering the light weight part with a wear resistant coating the life span till failure will be stretched while no concessions are made to its specific weight.

40|$|Silicon carbide {{ceramics}} are {{the leading}} candidate materials for use as heat exchangers in advanced combined cycle power plants because of their unique combination of high temperature strength, high thermal conductivity, excellent thermal shock resistance, and good high temperature stability and oxidation resistance. Ceramic coatings are being considered for diesel engine cylinder liners, piston caps, valve faces and <b>seats,</b> <b>piston</b> rings, and for turbine components such as combustors, blades, stators, seals, and bearings. Under such conditions ceramics are better suited to high temperature environments than metals. For the first time, adherent crystalline mullite coatings have been chemically vapor deposited onto SiC substrates to enhance its corrosion/oxidation resistance. Thermodynamic and kinetic considerations have been utilized to produce mullite coatings {{with a variety of}} growth rates, compositions, and morphologies. The flexibility of processing can be exploited to produce coated ceramics with properties tailored to specific applications and varied corrosive environments.

5000|$|More bespoke {{than the}} prior Ford Focus SVT (badged as the Focus ST170 in Europe), the Focus RS {{upgraded}} or replaced 70% {{of the standard}} Focus mechanicals. The turbocharged straight-4 engine produced a minimum of [...] and 310 Nm of torque, which was then mated to the 5-speed MTX-75 and not the Getrag transmission used in the ST 170. Mechanically, most notably, the car incorporated a Quaife automatic torque biasing differential to improve traction from the front-wheel drive setup. The steering used a similar quick-ratio rack as the ST170 while the brakes used fixed-caliper, four-piston Brembo units with 324 mm discs at the front and single-piston floating calipers and 280 mm discs at the back. Wheels were 18" [...] alloys specially developed by OZ Racing. The engine was heavily modified with forged aluminium <b>pistons,</b> hardened valve <b>seats,</b> sodium-filled exhaust valves, stainless steel exhaust system. The forced induction system comprised a Garrett turbocharger with a water-cooled charge air cooler and an electric water pump. To transmit the higher torque an upgraded AP clutch was used.|$|R
40|$|Friction, wear, and {{lubrication}} {{have direct}} influence on performance, reliability, and service life of mechanical systems with moving components. The useful life {{of these systems}} and their efficiency can be improved by improving the surface properties/ performance at sliding interfaces. Further, the usage of materials for sliding systems is limited in extreme environments, such as high temperature, and space, etc., due to their limited surface properties. This thesis focuses {{on the development of}} a new class of composites with superior surface properties, i. e., low friction and high wear resistance for extreme environmental conditions. Alumina, a well understood material for its tribological performance, is a merit choice for applications where high wear resistance is required, such as pump bearings, seal rings, valve <b>seats,</b> <b>piston</b> components, gears, cutting tool inserts and artificial joints. We propose to develop a novel alumina based ceramic composite to enhance its surface and tribological properties using a powder compaction technique. The newly developed composites will be characterized by X-ray Diffraction (XRD), Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscope (FTIR), Optical microscope, Environmental Scanning Electron Microscope (E-SEM), Goniometer and Surface profilometer. In-situ formation of high temperature stable phases, effect of sintering temperature, and percentage of reinforcement on phase formation will be studied. Investigation of effect of sintering temperature and percentage of reinforcement on density, porosity, and grain size will be conducted. The composites will be characterized for their tribological properties (friction and wear). The mechanisms for modified friction and wear will be proposed. The process parameters and compositions will be optimized. XRD results confirmed the formation of Al 18 B 4 O 33, and AlB 2 and FTIR confirmed the presence of B 2 O 3. Increase in sintering temperature and wt % of boron affected the porosity, grain size, and hardness of the composites. The coefficient of friction was lower for the composites compared to pure alumina ceramic. The coefficient of friction decreased with increase in sintering temperature. The wear mechanism was found to be micro-fracture using ESEM and SEM studies...|$|R
