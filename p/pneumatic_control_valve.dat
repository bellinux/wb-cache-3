40|$|Abstract: Stiction is {{the most}} common problem in <b>pneumatic</b> <b>control</b> <b>valves,</b> which are widely used in the process industry. Stiction causes {{fluctuation}} of process variables, which lowers productivity. Therefore, developing a method to detect stiction and distinguish it from other causes is crucial to help operators take an appropriate action for improving control performance. The present work proposes a valve stiction model and new stiction detection algorithms. Using only two parameters, the proposed model can describe the stiction phenomenon with sufficient accuracy. The usefulness of the proposed detection methods are demonstrated by comparing them with a conventional method. The proposed methods are shown to successfully detect valve stiction, distinguish it from bad tuning or disturbances, and quantify the degree of stiction, by using simulation data sets and real operation data sets of several chemical processes.

40|$|Abstract — Industrial surveys {{reported}} that, {{almost one}} third of poorly performing control loops are caused by nonlinearities present in the control valves, {{one of which is}} static friction. The effect of this nonlinearity is usually observed as oscillations in process variable. Since industrial plants include numerous interacting loops, the oscillations will be propagated to the entire system. Doubtlessly, repairing the faulty valves will be the only solution to this problem, which is possible only during process shut down. But, as shutting down the process to isolate the faulty valve for maintenance purposes is not economical, this solution does not count as the primary one. So, {{there is a need for}} a method to compensate the destructive effect of the stiction phenomenon in the control valve, especially when maintenance is not available.

Given a parametric geometry of a valve, the problem is posed as a multi-objective optimization with respect to product quality and production cost. The product quality is defined as 1) the deviation from the nominal valve design in the linearity of valve stroke and fluidic force, and 2) the difference in fluidic force with and without cavitation. These quality measures are estimated by using Monte Carlo simulation on a Radial-Basis Function Network (RBFN) trained with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation of the valve operation. The production cost is estimated by the tolerance-cost relationship obtained from the discrete event simulations of valve production process. A multi-objective genetic algorithm is utilized to generate Pareto optimal tolerance allocations with respect to these objectives, and alternative tolerance allocations are proposed considering the trade-offs among multiple objectives. 1...|$|E

40|$|Research into robot {{hands for}} {{industrial}} use {{began in the}} early 1980 s and there are now many examples of robot hands in existence. The reason for research into robot hands is that standard robot end effectors have to be designed for each application and are therefore costly. A universal end effector is needed that will be able to perform any parts handling operation or use other tools for other industrial operations. Existing robot hand research would therefore benefit from new concepts, designs and control systems. The Department of Production Technology is developing an intelligent robot hand of a novel configuration, with the ultimate aim of producing a universal end effector. The concept of PTIRH (Production Technology's Intelligent Robot Hand) {{is that it is a}} multi-fingered manipulator with a configuration of two thumbs and two fingers. Research by the author for this thesis concentrated on five major areas. First, the background research into the state of the art in robot hand research. Second, the initiation, development and analysis of the novel configuration concept of PTIRH. Third, specification, testing and analysis of air muscle actuation, including design, development and testing of a servo <b>pneumatic</b> <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> for the air muscles. Fourth, choice of sensors for the robot hand, including testing and analysis of two custom made air pressure sensors. Fifth, definition, design, construction, development, testing and analysis of the mechanical structure for an early prototype of PTIRH. Development of an intelligent controller for PTIRH was outside the scope of the author's research. The results of the analysis on the air muscles showed that they could be a suitable direct drive actuator for an intelligent robotic hand. The force, pressure and position sensor results indicate that the sensors could form the basis of the feedback loop for an intelligent controller. The configuration of PTIRH enables it to grasp objects with little reliance on friction.

40|$|The {{subject of}} this Doctoral Thesis is the {{investigation}} of the chemical conversion (gasification) for Greek solid fuels, with typical example the lignite, under mild temperature and pressure conditions, by using the inherent moisture content as gasification medium and applying the least possible feed pretreatment. This goal is highly significant, since solid fuels gasification is being widely considered as the process that will {{play a key role in}} electric power production via either the operation of Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) systems or Fuel Cells plants. Both systems guarantee high energy conversion efficiencies and an effective confrontation of the environmental issues that accompany the use of solid fuels. Industrial scale Koppers-Totzek gasifiers were employed successfully for the gasification of Greek lignite aiming at the production of synthesis gas. The latter gasifiers operate under high temperature (1100 - 1500 °C) and demand an extensive and expensive pretreatment (e. g., drying and pulverization) of the solid fuel. It has to be mentioned that the gasification of Greek lignite in Lurgi gasifiers is not considered being a proven process. In the context of the present dissertation, a solid fuel gasification pilot plant of continuous flow was designed, constructed and operated. This plant has the capacity of processing lignite with a nominal mass flow rate of 10 kg raw solids /h. This installation includes the gasifier and the gas product treatment units. The gasifier is a rotary kiln type reactor, indirect heat (electrical) and supplied with lifting flights for the effective mixing of the reactants. This type of gasifier allows the processing of lignite feeds with broad particle distribution (e. g. dp< 15 mm). The residence time of solids is adjusted through the kiln slope and the rate of revolution. The prospective product is synthesis gas of medium heating value, i. e. 12 - 14 MJ/Nm 3. This gasifier bears three series of thermocouples for the measurement of axial temperature distributions: (i) inside the kiln and along its axis, (ii) near the electric resistances and (iii) at the outer surface of the ceramic insulation. A proper automatic control system (Programmable Logical Controller (PLC) interfaced with a PC) provides for the kiln temperature control, while the real time acquisition and recording in the PC of temperature and pressure data is accomplished with the aid of electronic interface cards. Downstream the kiln is installed a pilot unit for the delivery, cooling, cleaning, storing and combustion of the gas product. This installation includes an automatic control system for gas product pressure and flow rate control, which employs an electronic Proportional-Integral-Differential (PID) Controller, as well as a properly connected <b>pneumatic</b> <b>control</b> <b>valve.</b> ...|$|E
