Starting with the 2002 model year, the LS6 engine output was increased to 405hp (302kW) due to a larger CFM air intake, stiffer valve springs, lighter sodium filled valves and more aggressive camshaft lift and timing.|$|E

25|$|Moisture may ascend into a {{building}} from {{the foundation of a}} wall or gain ingress into {{a building}} from a wet patch of ground, where it meets a solid wall. The manifest result of this process is called damp. One of many methods of resisting such ingresses of water is to construct the wall with several low courses of dense engineering bricks such as Staffordshire blue bricks. This method of damp <b>proofing</b> appears as a distinctive navy blue band running around the circumference of a building. The efficacy of this means of keeping out damp is more limited by the permeability of the mortar bedding and perpends joining the bricks, than by that of the bricks themselves.|$|E
25|$|The {{thickness}} specified for a wall {{is determined}} by such factors as damp <b>proofing</b> considerations, {{whether or not the}} wall has a cavity, load-bearing requirements, expense, and the era during which the architect was or is working. Wall thickness specification has proven considerably various, and while some non-load-bearing brick walls may be as little as half a brick thick, or even less when shiners are laid stretcher bond in partition walls, others brick walls are much thicker. The Monadnock Building in Chicago, for example, is a very tall masonry building, and has load-bearing brick walls nearly two metres thick at the base. The majority of brick walls are however usually between one and three bricks thick. At these more modest wall thicknesses, distinct patterns have emerged allowing for a structurally sound layout of bricks internal to each particular specified thickness of wall.|$|E

It is possible to sleep floating freely through the station, but this is generally avoided because of the possibility of bumping into sensitive equipment.

The floods caused by Hurricane Agnes in 1972 prompted a study that would channelize [...] of the Roanoke River to increase water capacity. After the 1985 floods, the city council sought assistance from the USACE to build flood walls and improve river flow to mitigate against future flooding. The agency estimated that the project would cut the damage in half for a flood similar to the 1985 one. The cost for the project was initially project to be $34.4million, of which the city was expected to pay $14.3million. Private land donations and other financial sources provided about $6.8million of the cost, while the remaining $7.5million was covered by a bond, approved in an April 1989 single-issue referendum. This was the first such referendum for the city, and passed with 56.6% in support amid a voter turnout of 19.6%. The bond would be repaid by a 2% raise of the utility tax. Construction began in 1990, and that year a flood warning system was completed.
