50|$|The {{majority}} of vocal fold lesions primarily {{arise in the}} cover of the folds. Since the basal lamina secures the epithelium to the superficial layer of the lamina propria with anchoring fibers, this is a common site for injury. If a person has a phonotrauma or habitual vocal hyperfunction, also known as <b>pressed</b> <b>phonation,</b> the proteins in the basal lamina can shear, causing vocal fold injury, usually seen as nodules or polyps, which increase the mass and thickness of the cover. The squamous cell epithelium of the anterior glottis are also a frequent site of laryngeal cancer caused by smoking.|$|E

Analysis of pressed voice samples extracted from natural conversational speech firstly shows that irregularity in periodicity (such as in vocal fry and harsh voices) is a common but not a strictly determinant feature of pressed voices. Spectral analysis shows that parameters related with spectral slope are effective to identify part of the pressed voice samples, but fail when vowels are nasalized or double-beating occurs within a glottal cycle. Temporal analyses of speech and EGG waveforms indicate that information about the completely closed period can potentially be used for pressed voice identification...|$|E
40|$|Summary: Inverse {{filtering}} (IF) is {{a common}} method used to estimate the source of voiced speech, the glottal flow. This investigation aims to compare two IF methods: one manual and the other semiautomatic. Glottal flows were estimated from speech pressure waveforms of six female and seven male subjects producing sustained vole /a / in breathy, normal, and <b>pressed</b> <b>phonation.</b> The closing phase characteristics of the glottal pulse were parameterized using two time-based parameters: the closing quotient (C 1 Q) and the normalized amplitude quotient (NAQ). The information given by these two parameters indicates {{a strong correlation between}} the two IF methods. The results are encouraging in showing that the parameterization of the voice source in different speech sounds can be performed independently of the technique used for inverse filtering. Key Words: Inverse filtering—Glottal flow—Closing quotient—Normalized amplitude quotient...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: In prior work, a {{manually}} derived {{measure of}} vocal fold vibratory phase asymmetry correlated {{to varying degrees}} with visual judgments made from laryngeal high-speed videoendoscopy (HSV) recordings. This investigation extended this work by establishing an automated HSV-based framework to quantify 3 categories of vocal fold vibratory asymmetry. Method: HSV-based analysis provided for cycle-to-cycle estimates of left–right phase asymmetry, left–right amplitude asymmetry, and axis shift during glottal closure for 52 speakers with no vocal pathology producing comfortable and <b>pressed</b> <b>phonation.</b> An initial cross-validation of the automated left–right phase asymmetry measure was performed by correlating the measure with other objective and subjective assessments of phase asymmetry. Results: Vocal fold vibratory asymmetry was exhibited to a similar extent in both comfortable and pressed phonations. The automated measure of left–right phase asymmetry strongly correlated with manually derived measures and moderately correlated with visual–perceptual ratings. Correlations with the visual–perceptua...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} five parts dealing with three areas; voice science, voice pedagogics and musical expression. The ultimate {{aim was to}} use the scientific analyzes of my vocal expression as a complement to a vocal teaching method that is applicable for the vocal ideals used in the popular music genres, considering also current scientific knowledge {{in the areas of}} physiology, acoustics and rehabilitation. Part I analyzes a classically trained singer's voice and some frequently used types of accompaniments as well as the voices of popular music singers. The results suggested that boosting the frequency range 3500 Hz in the popular music singer's monitor system could be beneficial. Part II analyzed how the vocal "Dist" ornament, commonly used by rock singers, is generated in my rock singer voice. A high-speed video recording combined with simultaneous voice source analysis revealed that this ornament was produced by adducting the supraglottal structures such that they were brought to vibration by the airstream. Part III analyzed the voice source and resonance characteristics when I was singing in the styles of rock, pop, soul and dance band. The results showed that the rock and dance band styles were opposite extremes, the rock style being closest to <b>pressed</b> <b>phonation.</b> Part IV, the pedagogical book, is an attempt to create a handbook for singers and singing teachers working or interested in the popular music genres. The content covers a wide range of aspects, from vocal warm up and voice massage to electronic equipment typically used by such singers. Part V is a CD meant to reflect my musical expression. The songs also exemplify some of the vocal styles and ornaments which I use in different popular music genres. Godkänd; 2008; 20081121 (ysko...|$|E
