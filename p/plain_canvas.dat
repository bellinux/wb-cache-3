5000|$|Maison Morel was the {{official}} purveyor of Marie-Caroline de Bourbon-Sicile, duchess de Berry, an honour that granted it {{the title of}} [...] "box maker, trunk maker and packer of Her Royal Highness The Duchess of Berry". Maison Martin’s store sign featured references to the three traditional crafts of [...] "box making, trunk making and packing" [...] that were {{at the core of}} its business, which was advertised as follows: [...] "Maison Martin sells an assortment of boxes and cases; it provides quality packing services for fragile furniture and objects, as well as hats, gowns and flowers; it uses oiled canvas, <b>plain</b> <b>canvas</b> and straw for packing; manufacturer of horse carriage trunks and coat racks, it also supplies oilcloth and waterproof canvas, all at a fair price." ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{cover of}} Fan The Fury is a <b>plain</b> off-white <b>canvas</b> with a {{painting}} of a portion of Deux Furies, with one half of the image {{on either side of the}} sleeve. The image, now in the public domain, is a 19th-century reproduction of a design on an ancient vase of the Erinyes of Greek mythology. Photographs of Aloud for the inside were taken by Mick Murray. Like previous Aloud albums the sleeve was put together by Henry Beguiristain, credited as [...] "Big Hen".|$|R
60|$|In {{the mean}} time, Mulford had got the canvas spread. Forward, the Swash showed all the cloth of a full-rigged brig, even to royals and flying jib; while aft, her mast was the raking, tall, naked pole of an American schooner. There was a taunt topmast, too, {{to which a}} gaff-topsail was set, and the gear proved that she could also show, at need, a {{staysail}} {{in this part of}} her, if necessary. As the Gate was before them, however, the people had set none but the <b>plain,</b> manageable <b>canvas.</b>|$|R
50|$|Trunks were {{generally}} constructed with a base trunk box made of pine {{which was then}} covered with protective and decorative materials. Some of the earliest trunks are covered with studded hide or leather and look much like the furniture of the same period (which makes sense as trunk manufacturing was sometimes an offshoot of a furniture business.) Later coverings include paper, <b>canvas,</b> <b>plain</b> or embossed tin, with an uncounted assortment of hardware and hardwood slats to keep it all down.|$|R
2500|$|Whistlejacket is an oil-on-canvas {{painting}} from about 1762 by the British artist George Stubbs showing the Marquess of Rockingham's racehorse approximately at lifesize, rearing {{up against a}} <b>plain</b> background. The <b>canvas</b> is large, lacks any other content except some discreet shadows, and Stubbs has paid precise attention to the [...] details of the horse's appearance. [...] It has been described in The Independent as [...] "a paradigm of the flawless beauty of an Arabian thoroughbred". [...] The Fitzwilliam family, heirs of the childless Rockingham, retained the painting until 1997 when funding from the Heritage Lottery Fund allowed the National Gallery, London to acquire it for £11 million.|$|R
50|$|Black Square is a ska {{band from}} Honolulu, Hawaii. Originally formed in 2002 as a {{hardcore}} punk trio, Black Square expanded into a six-piece and currently consists of Josh86 (vocals, guitar), Brian Kim (Drums), Sweet Taylor Baby Cakes (bass), Jared (trombone, backing vocals), T.R. (alto saxophone, backing vocals), and Babyface (tenor saxophone, backing vocals). Since expanding to a six-piece set up Black Square {{has sought to}} blend ska, punk, rocksteady, reggae, and hip-hop influences to create a distinct ska sound that maintains the intensity and style of punk rock. The band's name is a reference to Kazimir Malevich's 1915 oil painting of a black square on a <b>plain</b> piece of <b>canvas.</b>|$|R

500|$|Chauvel was {{promoted}} to colonel in 1913. On 3 July 1914, he sailed for England {{with his wife and}} three children to replace Colonel James Gordon Legge as the Australian representative on the Imperial General Staff. While he was still travelling, the First World War broke out. On reporting for duty at the War Office in mid-August 1914, Chauvel was given a cable directing him to assume command of the 1st Light Horse Brigade of the Australian Imperial Force (AIF) when it arrived in the United Kingdom. Chauvel became concerned with slow progress on construction of the AIF's proposed quarters on the Salisbury Plain. He made frequent visits to the site and had a Royal Australian Engineers officer, Major Cecil Henry Foott, appointed to the local staff to safeguard Australian interests. Convinced that the huts would not be ready on time, and that Australian troops would therefore have to spend a winter on Salisbury <b>Plain</b> under <b>canvas,</b> Chauvel persuaded the High Commissioner for Australia in London, former Prime Minister Sir George Reid, to approach Lord Kitchener with an alternate plan of diverting the AIF to Egypt, which was done. Accompanied by Major Thomas Blamey, Chauvel sailed for Egypt on the ocean liner [...] on 28 November 1914, arriving at Port Said on 10 December 1914.|$|R
