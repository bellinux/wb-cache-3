5000|$|Load Brook was {{developed}} from a farm {{to a minor}} industrial site in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. A [...] "pot clay" [...] mine (<b>pot</b> <b>clay</b> - a type of fireclay from the Stannington <b>pot</b> <b>clay</b> bed) {{was developed}} to the southwest in the 1850s by William Trickett, a local farmer. Trickett obtained rights to mine <b>pot</b> <b>clay</b> from the landowner, the Duke of Norfolk in 1852 and was mentioned in the Sheffield Trade Directory of 1862 as a clay merchant. William Trickett died in 1890 and the business was continued by his three sons, William, Benjamin and Matthew {{under the name of}} B. Trickett & Co.|$|E
5000|$|The {{fire brick}} company Thomas Wragg & Sons owned a <b>Pot</b> <b>Clay</b> mine {{immediately}} to the south east of the hamlet. <b>Pot</b> <b>Clay</b> is the impure version of Ganister and was in demand in the Sheffield steel industry to make bricks for the lining of furnaces. In the early 1970s the mine was producing 15,000 tons of clay per year, with the company quoting, “The mine can be worked at the present rate for 100 years”. A refractory brick works stood {{at the entrance to}} the mine. However the Ughill mine had drainage problems and although powerful pumps had been installed in the 1950s to pump between 600 and 800 gallons per minute from the mine, the mine closed on 17 November 1977. It had become uneconomic to mine the clay due to water problems and the owners found it more profitable to bring in clay from the Midlands. The site of the mine has been landscaped and returned to agricultural use. [...] J&J Dyson mined fireclay at their open cast quarry at Wheatshire between Ughill and Sugworth. The quarry is closed but can still be seen from the nearby road. Thos. Wragg had small firebrick works at Load Brook (closed 1957) and Brookside (Stopes Road, Stannington, closed 1960) the former previously owned by the Trickett family, the latter by the Drabble family and a major works (Old Wheel Brick Works) in the nearby Loxley Valley. Wraggs along with its local competitors, J&J Dyson of Griffs Works, Stannington and Thos. Marshall of Storrs Bridge Works, Loxley, mined the Stannington <b>Pot</b> <b>Clay</b> seam and manufactured fireclay-based casting pit holloware refractories for use in steel making worldwide. All three plants are closed following a collapse in demand for casting pit refractories of the type made locally mainly because of the introduction of continuous casting of steel worldwide and the general demise of the British steel industry.|$|E
50|$|The moors {{and common}} land around Storrs was {{enclosed}} between 1791 and 1805, the proposal which was {{put forward by}} Charles Howard, 11th Duke of Norfolk and other landowners in 1787 met with some hostility by “several of the freeholders and inhabitants” as the usage of the land became controlled by the owner. However, none of the challengers to the policy owned enough land to defy the large landowners. In 1881 it was recorded that nine men from Storrs were working at the <b>pot</b> <b>clay</b> drift mine at Load Brook, two km to the west.|$|E

50|$|During the 1800s the Loxley Valley {{became an}} {{important}} producer of refractory bricks for the expanding Sheffield steel industry. The bricks were used to line the furnaces and were made from ganister, a sort of sandstone and from fireclay from the Stannington <b>pot</b> <b>clay</b> seam which was prevalent in the Loxley area. Many ganister and fireclay mines existed in the area supplying the local firms of Siddons Bros. (Ganister), Thomas Wragg & Sons (Old Wheel Brick Works) and Thomas Marshall and Co. (Storrs Bridge Brick Works) and later Hepworths, which sprang up in the district and produced the bricks. Refractory production ceased {{in the area in}} the 1990s. Wraggs and Marshalls along with Dysons at nearby Stannington, specialised in manufacturing fireclay based casting pit refractory holloware for the steel industry worldwide.

5000|$|The term USTA {{is derived}} from Persian word 'USTAD' or master in a {{particular}} art or several arts. During the period of Mughal Emperor Akbar a group of Usta artists came to bikaner in the royal patronage of Maharaja Rai Singh to perform design work at the famous junagarh fort of bikaner. The craftsmanship and skill of those artists can be seen even today in the Anup mahal, Phool mahal and karan mahal of junagarh fort. USTA ART is a broad term which is the combination of many different form of arts and techniques. In current times most popular form seen is Sunehri Munawwati Nakkashi work which means gold emboss work. This form of this art is performed on walls, ceilings, glass, wood, marble and artifacts made of camel leather also. On all the mentioned surfaces very fine work is performed using best quality metarial. during its origin all the forms of usta art other than paintings were generally seen on walls but during British period need was felt to perform the usta art on such a material which remains light and easy to carry, so the pots which were made of camel leather and were used to carry oil and fragrance in those times became best alternate for doing gold work on them [...] Sunehri Munawwati Nakkashi work or gold emboss work is completes in many stages. firstly smooth surface is prepared by applying natural primer than measurement is taken for the drawing designs, the designs are drawn on the surface than AKHBARA or first stage of work is done, in this the floral design is filled, using brush and color. When it is dried the floral design is embossed through brush by using a paste prepared by mixing <b>pot</b> <b>clay</b> powder, gum, jaggery and naushadar, on this embossed design a layer of yellow paint is applied and left it to hard dry again a coat of the yellow paint is applied {{and when it is}} dried the gold foils are applied and the details of emboss are drawn through very fine brush and design is filled with color.|$|E
40|$|Water {{shortage}} {{is one of}} {{the major}} constraints for production of horticultural crops in arid and semiarid regions. A field experiment was conducted to determine irrigation water and fertilizer use efficiency, growth and yield of tomato under <b>clay</b> <b>pot</b> irrigation at the experimental site of Sekota Dryland Agricultural Research Center, Lalibela, Ethiopia in 2009 / 10. The experiment comprised of five treatments including furrow irrigated control and <b>clay</b> <b>pot</b> irrigation with different plant population and fertilization methods, which were arranged in Randomized Complete Block Design with three replications. The highest total and marketable fruit yields were obtained from <b>clay</b> <b>pot</b> irrigation combined with application of nitrogen fertilizer with irrigation water irrespective of difference in plant population. The <b>clay</b> <b>pot</b> irrigation had seasonal water use of up to 143. 71 mm, which resulted in significantly higher water use efficiency (33. 62 kg m- 3) as compared to the furrow irrigation, which had a seasonal water use of 485. 50 mm, and a water use efficiency of 6. 67 kg m- 3. Application of nitrogen fertilizer with irrigation water in <b>clay</b> <b>pots</b> improved fertilizer use efficiency of tomato by up to 52 % than band application with furrow or <b>clay</b> <b>pot</b> irrigation. Thus, <b>clay</b> <b>pot</b> irrigation with 33, 333 plants ha- 1 and nitrogen fertilizer application with irrigation water in <b>clay</b> <b>pots</b> was the best method for increasing the yield of tomato while economizing the use of water and nitrogen fertilizer in a semiarid environment...|$|R

40|$|Continental glaciers covered {{as much as}} {{thirty percent}} of the present-day {{inhabited}} earth during the Quaternary period. Traditionally, one-dimensional consolidation has been considered as the main process of formation for the soils deposited during glaciation. One of the outcomes of accepting one-dimensional consolidation as the main process of formation is that the geomechanical properties of soil in a horizontal plane are isotropic (known as cross-anisotropy). Recent measurements of subglacial pore pressure and preconsolidation pressure profile have indicated that {{this might not be}} the case. The role of subglacial shear action has probably been long neglected. The main objective of this research is to investigate the effects of subglacial shearing on the geomechanical properties of glaciated soils. Recent research has found evidence of horizontal property anisotropy associated with the direction of the ice-sheet movement. A testing program was thus proposed to explore the relationship between the anisotropy of property and the direction of past glacier movement. The program involves several fundamental engineering parameters of soils. These parameters together with the corresponding test methods are as follows: (i) Conventional oedometer test – yield stress anisotropy; (ii) Oedometer test with lateral stress measurement – stiffness anisotropy; (iii) Load cell pressuremeter (LCPM) test – in situ stress anisotropy. The physical meaning of yield stress determined by conventional oedometer tests was interpreted as the critical state of structural collapse. The literature review and an experimental study on kaolin samples with a known stress history suggested that yield stress possesses certain dependency on the sampling direction. The anisotropy of yield stress for Battleford till from Birsay, Saskatchewan was also explored by testing directional oedometer samples. In addition, the anisotropy of stiffness was also investigated using a newly developed lateral stress oedometer that is capable of independent measurement of horizontal stresses at three different points with angles of 120 degrees. Preliminary evidence of a correlation between the direction of maximum stiffness in a horizontal plane and the known direction of glacial shear was observed. The correlation between the direction of maximum yield stress and known direction of glaciation was rather poor. Anisotropy of in situ stresses was investigated by conducting LCPM tests in <b>Pot</b> <b>clay</b> in the Netherlands. Based on the LCPM test results, it was concluded that the evidence of a correlation between the anisotropy of in situ stress and known direction of glacial advance is still rather obscure. Although both the laboratory studies and field studies cannot sufficiently confirm the existence of lateral anisotropy of geomechanical properties and its relationship to the direction of the Quaternary ice-sheet movement, the effects of subglacial shearing should not be neglected in assessing the geotechnical properties of glaciated soils. In practice, it is usually found that the preconsolidation pressure profile does not follow the gravitational line as predicted by the one-dimensional consolidation theory and its magnitude is not compatible with the measured effective pressure values {{at the base of the}} glacier. It has been suggested that changes in seepage gradient (upward or downward) are responsible for the deviation of preconsolidation pressure profile away from the gravitational line. In this thesis, a new glacial process model – consolidation coupled shearing – was proposed. This model is based on the framework of traditional soil mechanics (critical state theory, Modified Cam-clay model and one-dimensional consolidation theory) and is consistent with the general geological and glaciological evidences. This model may provide an alternative explanation for the preconsolidation pressure patterns generally observed in practice. It can also be combined with groundwater flow characteristics to explain the diversity of the preconsolidation consolidation patterns. The proposed model was used successfully to obtain the preconsolidation pressure profile observed in Battleford till at Birsay and the subglacial shear-softening phenomenon...|$|E
