In addition, an experiment was established to illustrate whether different advertising appeals may have different effects on consumers'anticipated guilt and their ethical intention. Results showed that both appeals could exert positive influence on consumers' anticipated guilt as well as ethical intention. However, though guilt appeal could increase more anticipated guilt than informational appeal, their impact on consumers' ethical intention was not found significantly different. That was, both appeals could be applied to enhance consumers'ethical intention. Together the proposed theoretical framework with testing on effects of advertising appeals, this research might have important theoretical and managerial contributions...|$|R

They also observed that increase in amount of Lumicyano 4 % cyanoacrylate and fuming time gave lower detection rate than double process with Lumicyano 4 %. However, double process with conventional cyanoacrylate did not improve the detection rate. In another study, Farrugia et al. (2014 a) advocate the use of Lumicyano™ (one-step fluorescent cyanoacrylate product) followed by basic yellow 40 dyeing (LCA 1 %[*]→[*]BY 40) over cyanoacrylate fuming followed by basic yellow 40 dyeing (CA[*]→[*]BY 40) and powder suspensions for developing latent fingermarks on <b>plastic</b> <b>carrier</b> <b>bags</b> as its use is easy, safe and fast requiring no drying or dyeing process without compromising the quality of developed prints.

They suggested that silver electroless deposition (SED) is a suitable alternative method to cyanoacrylate fuming method for development of latent fingermarks on brass surfaces except for metals which are coated in a lacquer. Snyder (2009) suggested the use of Sudan black over magnetic powder, ninhydrin, physical developer, cyanoacrylate with Sudan black, cyanoacrylate with ninhydrin and cyanoacrylate with physical developer to develop latent fingermarks in petroleum jelly. Boateng et al. (2016) used ABC dry fire extinguisher powder to develop latent fingermarks on heated and unheated tile, metal and glass surfaces. They compared fire extinguisher powder method with fluorescent powder, magnetic powder, granular white or black powder and cyanoacrylate[*]→[*]rhodamine methods and observed that quality of prints developed with fire extinguisher powder is comparable to prints developed by these methods on both heated and unheated surfaces.

40|$|Allwood {{believes}} {{that we need}} to face the facts and find scalable solutions, rather than token gestures that make very little impact. In the opening chapter of his new book, Sustainable Materials, Allwood cites plastic grocery bags in the UK as a case in point. He notes that plastic accounts for about 1 per cent of the UK’s CO 2 emissions, and <b>plastic</b> <b>carrier</b> <b>bags</b> make up 1 per cent of plastic use. Hence, even if all plastic bags were scrapped – and assuming their substitute were carbon neutral, which is unlikely – we would only be addressing 0. 01 per cent of the UK’s carbon footprint. By contrast, says Allwood, “our aim is to look for solutions, and our number-one guiding principle is about scale – {{we want to make sure}} that we identify options for change that are big enough to make a big difference. ” Allwood’s research team starts by quantifying which economic activities generate the most emissions. It turns out that 64 per cent of global CO 2 emissions are energy- or process-related (the rest are from deforestation, agriculture or decay); and 35 per cent of these emissions are from industry, 31 per cent from buildings and 27 per cent from transport.

40|$|This report takes a broad {{overview}} of the UK environmental tax system as it exists in 2006. It aims to bring together evidence and data {{from a range of}} sources to provide a central source of information about the existing environmental tax system, alongside discussion of the key principles of the debate around using taxes and other economic instruments for environmental goals. The report assesses broad trends over time - both in environmental tax revenues and in greenhouse gas emissions, the latter with respect to the government's own emissions-reduction targets and the Kyoto Protocol. It also examines current measures case by case, considering and commenting on the history, motivation, design and implementation of each tax, evidence on the effects (both intentional and perhaps unintentional), trends in revenue and, where important, any distributional implications. Taxes are considered under three broad headings: transport, natural resources and energy. The report looks at new taxes designed explicitly for environmental ends (such as the climate change levy), taxes that were not environmental in intention but have environmental consequences (such as fuel duty), taxes that were altered to incorporate a more obvious environmental objective (such as changes to VAT) and non-tax measures that nevertheless provide economic incentives for pollution reduction (such as the UK and EU Emissions Trading Schemes). The report is not designed to be prescriptive - it does not suggest or encourage that particular policies be changed or introduced, nor does it try to estimate how far current policy will go in the future to meet environmental objectives. Rather, it is designed as a factual overview of where current policy has taken us. However, it does consider some possible future reforms to the environmental tax system - road user charging, carbon taxes and taxes on packaging waste (<b>plastic</b> <b>carrier</b> <b>bags)</b> - that have been suggested. In a report of this nature, it is, of course, extremely difficult to summarise the findings as a whole for each part of the environmental tax system. Some of the key results, both general and for particular tax measures, are, however, presented here. ...|$|R
