40|$|Abstract—Amplify-and-forward (AF) relay based {{cooperation}} {{has been}} investigated in the literature given its simplicity and practicality. Two models for AF, namely, fixed gain and fixed <b>power</b> <b>relaying,</b> have been extensively studied. In fixed gain relaying, the relay gain is fixed but its transmit power varies {{as a function of}} the source-relay (SR) channel gain. In fixed <b>power</b> <b>relaying,</b> the <b>relay’s</b> instantaneous transmit <b>power</b> is fixed, but its gain varies. We propose a general AF cooperation model in which an average transmit <b>power</b> constrained <b>relay</b> jointly adapts its gain and transmit power {{as a function of the}} channel gains. We derive the optimal AF gain policy that minimizes the fading-averaged symbol error probability (SEP) of MPSK and present insightful and tractable lower and upper bounds for it. We then analyze the SEP of the optimal policy. Our results show that the optimal scheme is up to 39. 7 % and 47. 5 % more energy-efficient than fixed <b>power</b> <b>relaying</b> and fixed gain relaying, respectively. Further, the weaker the direct source-destination link, the greater are the energy-efficiency gains. I...|$|R

In such networks, optical transmission parameters can be varied dynamically as traffic patterns change. This will provide different bandwidths, but also change the regeneration limits as a result. To support this flexibility, OEOs (‘relays’) may be switched {{on and off}} as required, thus saving power. DPR-FON is shown to be NP-complete; consequently, solving such a dynamic problem in real-time requires a fast heuristic capable of delivering an acceptable approximation to the optimal configuration with low complexity. In this paper, just such an algorithm is developed, implemented, and evaluated against more computationally-demanding alternatives for two known cases.
