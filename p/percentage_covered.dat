The tool performs a targeted color segmentation from a user defined mask, with the mask specifying non-algae and probably algae observed. The mask is created as part of a two step process that initially performs a local histogram operation (Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization) that is aimed at removing some of the illuminations effects seen in an image. In an experiment conducted using mock images to assess the accuracy of users percent cover estimation the results yielded a maximum variance between observed and expected <b>percentage</b> <b>cover</b> of 21 %. ^ The testing conducted on the image processing tool using created checkerboard test patterns showed that the image processing tool was consistently within 2 % of the actual observed <b>percentage</b> <b>cover.</b> The results from the comparison between visual inspection and image processing tool results showed a high correlation in green and red percent coverage. The mean difference between both methods for green algae was identified at 2 %, and for red was identified at 2. 6 %. Images that were found to be outside the 21 % bias offset used were found to be erroneous as a potential result of failure in the image processing work flow, examples of these failures were reexamined and found to be closer to the visual inspection results. In another test conducted with actual aerial images processed by users, the percentage variance between the visual inspection method and image processing tool were compared. The image processing tool yielded a 5 percent reduction in variance when compared with the simple visual inspection method. The <b>percentage</b> <b>cover</b> results from the image processing tool were converted to an area estimation using a simple linear trigonometric function that utilized the horizon line for pitch estimation. The area estimation results were compared with macro algal growth model runs performed on several areas in or around the Greenwich Bay area within Narragansett Bay. The growth model results showed potential growth of macroalgae and were compared visually to the results from the image processing tool for the months May, June and July for the year 2010. The results from both the growth model and image processing tool appear to correlate greatly when compared. ^ The project revealed a number of issues with the previous and current methods for assessing the <b>percentage</b> <b>cover,</b> and utilizing this <b>percentage</b> <b>cover</b> to create an area estimation. Future developments would see the inclusion of additional sensors to capture roll and pitch of the camera.

40|$|New {{methods for}} the {{establishment}} of Ammophila arenaria (marram grass), i. e. sowing seeds and disk-harrowing rhizomes, were compared with the traditional method (planting bundles of culms). A large-scale experiment was undertaken on 120 ha of fortified foredune ridge and approximately 40 percent of this area was evaluated by airborne remote sensing (false colour photography). Above-ground biomass production and <b>percentage</b> <b>cover</b> of one- and two-year-old stands were determined by combining field data with colour density measurements on the images. A linear empirical relationship could be established between colour density ratio on the photographs and above-ground biomass, as well as <b>percentage</b> <b>cover.</b> This relationship depended on the age of the plantation. Planting method or relief did not influence this relationship. After the first growing season, planted culms had produced less biomass and <b>percentage</b> <b>cover</b> than stands established via the new methods. In the second growing season the traditional method was the most productive. During the first growing season more than 90 percent of the total area had been stabilized successfully by the new vegetation. Therefore, the alternative methods could be as effective for sand stabilization as the traditional method of planting. Effectiveness of the temporary sand stabilization after sowing and the origin of the culms and rhizomes used for planting affected productivity of the new stands more than the method of establishment. Therefore, if applied properly A. arenaria can be established at a practical level from seeds or rhizomes, instead of from culms.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Forest and {{especially}} evergreen conifers like pine and spruce {{are known to}} reduce avalanche formation due to their physical anchoring effect and their influence on snow pack layering through changed temperature, radiation, wind speed etc. Research shows that <b>percentage</b> <b>covered</b> by the crown reflects the forests ability to reduce avalanche danger, and crown cover is therefore often used {{as a measure of}} the forest's efficiency as protection forest. Crown cover is highest in evergreen conifer forests, but in Scandinavia, the deciduous tree species birch (Betula pubsens, subspecies alpine betula) is the most common tree species in higher elevations near the tree line. This is a small and often thin stemmed, flexible tree. Their crown is thin and field observations show that in avalanche terrain the stems of such trees have a form heavily affected by snow creep and glide and the trees are in many cases bent under the snow cover. Thus, this type of forest does not fulfill the common criteria set for protection forests and its effect on the snow cover is largely unknown. In this study we question whether typical birch forests can reduce the probability of avalanche formation through snowpack effects and anchoring. We look at cases of small avalanches in birch forest, stem densities and snow profiles inside and outside birch forest and compare observations to results from models for calculating anchoring effects...|$|E
40|$|Improvement of intra-row {{mechanical}} {{weed control}} is important to reduce the reliance on herbicides in arable crops and vegetables. Covering weeds by soil is an important weed control mechanism of weed harrows. A shallow post-emergence harrow cultivation controls weeds but also damages the crop to some extent. This paper explores how plants get covered by soil and how a plant’s resistance against being covered is related to its height, flexibility and shape of leaves. Seedlings of two contrasting species were sown in bins filled with a sandy soil and harrowed by a small model harrow in the laboratory. Covering selectivity (<b>percentage</b> <b>covered</b> ryegrass/percentage covered garden cress) could be influenced by soil moisture content, working depth and working speed. Differences in covering were related to spatial patterns of plant downward bending and soil surface level upheaval. These patterns are associated with soil failure patterns near tines and soil flow patterns, connected with different effects of plant height and plant flexibility. This study indicates that relationships between weed control and crop covering may not only depend on weed and crop characteristics but also on soil conditions and implement settings. As less than 10 % of the covered plants were buried deeper than 15 mm, covering would mainly cause growth reduction and little killing. Limited burial depth {{may be an important}} cause for limited weed control effectiveness of harrowing...|$|E

We provide an assessment of available data sets and approaches, and their suitability for monitoring and quantifying change in seagrass <b>percentage</b> <b>cover</b> and extent for a large coastal embayment (Moreton Bay, Australia, 1582 km 2). Seagrass <b>percentage</b> <b>cover</b> maps were created for 2011 and 2004 and compared to map and measure the extent of seagrass <b>percentage</b> <b>cover</b> change, and changes in the extent of seagrass environments. Total extent of seagrass was shown to be higher in 2011 compared to 2004. Potential sources of these differences may be: mapping inaccuracy; actual change in extent and cover; and, monthly to seasonal variations in seagrass cover. A qualitative comparison of the 2004 and 2011 maps was performed against maps of seagrass extent maps from 1975, 1986 and 1999, which were created using a range of different methods and data. The output maps show changes in seagrass extent, but a lack of detail arising from variable mapping methods and differing mapping extents prevented a reliable comparison.

30|$|Moreover, {{the amount}} of {{evidence}} needed to make these assessments is low, {{as demonstrated by the}} <b>percentage</b> <b>covered</b> by the training set over the dataset. In Table  6 the performance is even higher than in Table  5. First, {{this is due to the}} existence of a correlation between the provenance group an annotation belongs to and its trustworthiness. Second, the fact that the provenance stereotypes that we considered for this experiment are 21, which is much less than the number of users, together with the unbalance between useful and non-useful annotations in the Steve.Museum dataset (the first are much more plentiful than the latter) compensates a collateral effect of smoothing. In fact, smoothing helps in allocating some probability to unseen events (for instance, possible future mistakes of good users). So, because of smoothing, we predicted the existence of non-useful annotations for users who actually did not produce them (the dataset contains only relatively few non-useful annotations). Since there are many more users than provenance stereotypes, this error is higher with user-based estimates, where there are many more smoothed probability distributions (one per author), which causes many more annotations to be wrongly evaluated as non-useful. On the other hand, with provenance stereotypes, this error was much more limited, because the corresponding smoothed reputations introduced fewer wrong non-useful evaluations. Still, we will continue employing smoothing, as these are posterior considerations based on the availability of privileged information about the test set (i.e. its evaluation), and smoothing allows to compensate the lack of this information. On the other hand, the specific Steve.Museum dataset possibly shows a limitation of smoothing.|$|E
40|$|O objetivo deste trabalho foi comparar a composição, a proteólise, a capacidade de derretimento e a formação de "blisters" (bolhas) em queijos tipo Mussarela fabricados com retentado de leite (MR) de fator de concentração volumétrica (FCV) de 2, 34 : 1, com um queijo Mussarela padrão (MP) fabricado com leite não ultrafiltrado. Foi realizado um ensaio de produção com 3 lotes de MR e um lote de MP. Determinou-se a composição do leite, retentado, soro, água de filagem e queijos e a proteólise, a capacidade de derretimento e a formação de "blisters" nos queijos com 7, 15, 30 e 60 dias de armazenamento refrigerado. MRs apresentaram maiores valores de pH e de porcentagem de cinzas e de proteína total e menores porcentagens de acidez titulável, gordura, gordura no extrato seco e sal quando comparadas a MP. Durante o tempo de estocagem, as MRs apresentaram menor proteólise e capacidade de derretimento, em todas as datas analisadas. A porcentagem de área coberta por 'blisters" na pizza e o diâmetro médio dos mesmos foram maiores na MP durante o primeiro mês de estocagem e depois ambos os tipos de queijos apresentaram comportamentos similares para estes 2 parâmetros. The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to compare the composition, proteolysis, melting capacity and blisters formation in Mozzarella cheese manufactured with milk retentate (MR) of a volumetric concentration factor (FCV) of 2. 34 : 1, with a standard Mozzarella cheese (MP) manufactured with non ultrafiltrated milk. It was realized one production assay with 3 batches of MRs and one of MP. It was evaluated the milk, retentate, whey, stretching water and cheeses composition and the proteolysis, melting capacity and the blisters formation on cheeses with 7, 15, 30 and 60 days of refrigerates storage. MRs presented larger pH, ash and total protein contents and lower titratable acidity and fat, fat on dry matter and salt contents when compared to MP. Along the storage time the MRs presented lower proteolysis and melting capacity in all the analyzed dates. The pizza area <b>percentage</b> <b>covered</b> by blisters and their average diameters were larger for the MP during the first storage month and thereafter both kinds of cheese presented similar behavior for these two parameters...|$|E
50|$|Quadrats {{are sampled}} {{all the way}} down the {{transect}} line, at each marked point on the line, or at some other predetermined interval (or even randomly) if time is short. It is important that the same person should do the estimations of cover in each quadrat, because the estimation is likely to vary from person to person. If different people estimate <b>percentage</b> <b>cover</b> in different quadrats, then an element of personal variation is introduced which will lead to less accurate results. Sampling should always be as least destructive as possible and trampling the surrounding area should be avoided when carrying out a survey. Not only is there a risk of damaging the area, but there is also a risk of reducing the population or <b>percentage</b> <b>cover</b> of the species being surveyed.|$|R
40|$|We {{quantified}} the <b>percentage</b> <b>cover</b> of turf-forming algae among locations spanning > 1000 km {{of continuous}} South Australian coastline {{and found that}} they formed {{one of the most}} extensive subtidal habitats on reefs devoid of macroalgae. We then experimentally tested the hypothesis that sediment deposition and microtopography of substratum interact to control turf alga abundance (<b>percentage</b> <b>cover</b> and biomass). Both microtopography (topographically simple and complex) and sedimentation (natural and reduced) were manipulated orthogonally to test their independent and interactive effects on subtidal turf-forming algae. This field experiment demonstrated that reduced rates of sedimentation have positive effects on the <b>percentage</b> <b>cover</b> and biomass of turf-forming algae (Feldmannia spp.) and that a very small increase in topographic complexity (microtopography) can have large positive effects (> 36 % increase) on the biomass of turf-forming algae under conditions of reduced sedimentation. These results support new models that suggest differences in microtopography may account for observed variation in the effects of sedimentation on the abundance of turf-forming algae. Importantly, heavy rates of sediment deposition can negate the positive effects of greater topographic complexity at fine spatial scales (i. e. microtopography). These results raise serious concerns about gaps in our knowledge of the effects of sedimentation on turf-forming algae and its consequences for current declines in the diversity and cover of algae in disturbed coastal habitats.
