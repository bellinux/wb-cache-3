Vegetative <b>propagation</b> <b>by</b> <b>rooted</b> <b>cuttings</b> will be {{a useful}} tool in reflorestation only when rooting {{problems}} are overcome. Intensive studies on promoter factors of rool induction will be necessary. This paper represents a systematic study of different parameters affecting the rooting of carob shoot cuttings. Seasonal effects, hormonal treatment efficiency and cultivars were examined. Hardwood cuttings of carob were excised both on March and April. An acclimatization period under freeze conditions followed by an hormone treatment of 4000 and 8000 mg/ 1 indole butiric acid was tested. After this treatment cuttings were inserted in a rooting bench with expanded clay as substrate and maintaining inside the greenhouse for a two month period. Splitting the lower segment of the cutting, prior to placing them on the clay have no significant results on <b>rooting.</b> On <b>cuttings</b> harvested on March, the response seems to be conditioned principally by the hormonal concentration, in spite of those from April where cultivar {{seems to have the}} most influence on rooting ability.

B 0 cuttings were derived from field sprouting stumps whereas B 1 cuttings were produced from intensively managed container-grown stock plants. Overall, B 1 <b>cuttings</b> <b>rooted</b> much earlier and in greater proportions than their B 0 homologs with more than 95 % of success after 25 days of rooting for every clone.

The number of adventitious roots produced was observed to be significantly influenced by the genotype {{and the type of}} cutting {{as well as by the}} interaction between these two factors during the whole rooting period. The incidence of these results on the subsequent development of the <b>rooted</b> <b>cuttings</b> further to field planting was discussed. Experimental and more practical observations based on several millions of B 0 and B 1 rooted cuttings-derived plants produced and planted so far plead strongly for the use of cuttings produced by intensively managed container-grown stock plants rather than originating from field sprouting stumps. This view is argued with regard to mass clonal propagation systems of eucalypts in general. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R
40|$|Cassia brewsteri (Caesalpiniaceae) is a tree {{endemic to}} central Queensland. In this thesis, the {{potential}} of the plant as a source of seed gums (galactomannans) with industrial applications has been assessed in terms of genetic diversity, distribution and habitat, phenology, propagation, insect pests, seed chemistry, gelling characteristics and economic viability. Radio-labelled DNA Amplification Fingerprinting was used to indicate the level of genetic variation within C. brewsteri. Phylogenetic analyses supported the maintenance of the four native Cassia taxa at species level and the division of C. brewsteri into two subspecies. Ecological parameters associated with 124 sites of natural or cultivated occurrence were characterised in terms of soil and vegetation type, and potential cultivation areas predicted using the climate modelling software BIOCLIM. A broad area of eastern Queensland was shown to be suitable for the cultivation of the tree. Reproductive phenology of the tree was documented and found to allow for a confined harvest period (once per year). Seed germination was achieved most effectively by mechanical scarification while <b>propagation</b> <b>by</b> <b>rooted</b> <b>cuttings</b> was unsuccessful. Heavy predation of seed by Caryedon serratus (an exotic bruchid) was noted, and the potential impact of this insect on the ecology of its host, and the potential for infestation of Arachis hypogaea (peanut) is discussed. Cassia brewsteri seed galactomannan was demonstrated to be acceptable for use as a food gum. It is comparable to Ceratonia siliqua (carob) gum in gelling strength, and contains less than 10 ppm of the toxin chrysophanic acid. However, preliminary estimates of yield and return on investment from plantation culture of Cassia brewsteri for seed production were not encouraging...|$|R

40|$|Background and Purpose: Black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia L.) is a {{valuable}} species native to North America and today widely planted throughout the world for biomass production. In Hungary, where Robinia has great importance in the forest management, the clones have been selected for plantations on good, medium and poor quality sites. To conserve the identity, superior clones are vegetatively propagated <b>by</b> <b>root</b> <b>cuttings.</b> At times the collection of <b>root</b> <b>cuttings</b> can cause uncertainty for clonal identity because of the overlap of roots from neighboring plants. This can occur especially when the repository is damaged from severe environmental accidents and the planting layout has been lost. The {{aim of this study}} has been to verify by molecular markers the diversity or identity of black locust clones <b>by</b> <b>root</b> <b>cuttings</b> harvested in a damaged trial. Materials and Methods: <b>Root</b> <b>cuttings</b> of 91 clones belonging to five cultivars were collected in a trial severely damaged by storms and flooding periods. The obtained plantlets were analyzed with nine microsatellite (SSR) markers and the genetic identity/diversity within and among the plants was tested using the software GenAlEx version 6. Results: Multilocus genotypes (MLG) and the Paetkau’s assignation test (1985) revealed genetic variability among the samples: the analyzed plantlets were grouped in four classes instead of the five expected. In addition, 6 unique genotypes have been detected.

40|$|The {{forest tree}} species Hevea brasiliensis is {{extensively}} {{planted in the}} humid tropics to meet the increasing demand for natural rubber. Huge quantities of planting stock are therefore needed. The seed option remains the easiest and cheapest way to establish plantations of rubber trees but those show a great variability for vigor and also for latex yield. The rationale of producing clones for overcoming this variability was already obvious in the early 1910 's but due to the difficulties encountered at that time for rooting shoots, grafting {{was used as an}} alternative cloning method. The striking increase in yield noticed from the graft-derived clonal plantations warranted their large scale development. Eventually, the budded clones by virtue of their much higher and uniform productivity supplanted the seedlings in most industrial plantations. However, grafting is also associated with drawbacks and for decades efforts aiming at mass producing selected rubber tree clones on their own <b>roots</b> <b>by</b> <b>rooted</b> <b>cuttings</b> have been pursued. However, this approach was progressively abandoned due to disappointing rooting results and, from the 70 's onwards, priority has been given to in vitro methods which were booming during this period. But despite 40 years of heavy investments, industrial H. brasiliensis clones could still not be mass micropropagated in vitro efficiently enough to meet the requirements of large scale production. The situation may change radically soon, however, due to the development of new nursery techniques adapted to the mass clonal production <b>by</b> <b>rooted</b> <b>cuttings</b> of any H. brasiliensis selected genotype. Efforts to improve the techniques as well as the establishment of new field trials are underway in order to determine if self-rooted rubber tree clones are more productive than grafted ones.

The method developed was applied to the restoration of juvenile traits of adult trees. The main criterion is the rooting ability of microcuttings sampled on scions, after micrografting.

40|$|Summary After about 20 days, {{hypocotyl}} cuttings from 20 -day-old {{loblolly pine}} (Pinus taeda L.) seedlings rooted {{easily in the}} presence of the auxin indole- 3 -butyric acid (IBA), with roots forming directly from xylem parenchyma. In con-trast, woody cuttings from 1 [...] 2 -year-old hedged seedlings formed roots indirectly from callus tissue in 60 [...] 90 days, but IBA had little effect on rooting. Variation in rooting among hypocotyls from both half- and full-sib families was highly significant in response to IBA, and rooting did not occur within 20 days unless IBA was applied. Hypocotyls from poor rooting families tended to produce fewer <b>roots</b> per <b>cutting</b> than hypo-cotyls from good <b>rooting</b> families. <b>Rooting</b> <b>by</b> woody <b>cuttings</b> and hypocotyl cuttings from the same nine full-sib families was weakly correlated, raising the possibility that at least some common genetically controlled processes were affecting root-ing by both types of cutting. The phytotropin N- 1 -naphthyl-phthalamic acid (NPA), supplied at 1 mM with 10 mM IBA, significantly inhibited <b>rooting</b> <b>by</b> hypocotyl <b>cuttings</b> from both good and poor rooting families, but there was no significant family ´ treatment interaction. Family variation in rooting ability may be a function of the frequency of occurrence of auxin-responsive cells in the hypocotyls...|$|R
40|$|Winter {{survival}} in woody plants {{is controlled by}} environmental and genetic factors that affect the plant's ability to cold acclimate. Because woody perennials are long-lived and often have a prolonged juvenile (pre-flowering) phase, {{it is conceivable that}} both chronological and physiological age factors influence adaptive traits such as stress tolerance. This study investigated annual cold hardiness (CH) changes in several hybrid Rhododendron populations based on Tmax, an estimate of the maximum rate of freezing injury (ion leakage) in cold-acclimated leaves from juvenile progeny. Data from F 2 and backcross populations derived from R. catawbiense and R. fortunei parents indicated significant annual increases in Tmax ranging from 3. 7 to to 6. 4 C as the seedlings aged from 3 to 5 years old. A similar yearly increase (6. 7 ° C) was observed in comparisons of 1 - and 2 -year-old F 1 progenies from a R. catawbiense x R. dichroanthum cross. In contrast, CH of the mature parent plants (> 10 years old) did not change significantly over the same evaluation period. In leaf samples from a natural population of R. maximum, CH evaluations over two years resulted in an average Tmax value for juvenile 2 - to 3 - year- old plants that was 9. 2 C lower than the average for mature (~ 30 years old) plants.. A reduction in CH was also observed in three hybrid rhododendron cultivars clonally propagated <b>by</b> <b>rooted</b> <b>cuttings</b> (ramets) - Tmax of 4 -year-old ramets was significantly lower than the Tmax estimates for the 30 - to 40 -year-old source plants (ortets). In both the wild R. maximum population and the hybrid cultivar group, higher accumulation of a cold-acclimation responsive 25 kDa leaf dehydrin was associated with older plants and higher CH. The feasibility of identifying hardy phenotypes at juvenile period and research implications of age-dependent changes in CH are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Acacia mangium and A. mangium × A. auriculiformis hybrids {{have gained}} an {{increasing}} interest in reafforestation programs under the humid tropical conditions, mainly for pulpwood production. This {{is due to}} their impressive growth on acid and degraded soils, {{as well as their}} capability to restore soil fertility thanks to their natural nitrogen-fixing ability. It is crucial to develop efficient methods for improving the genetic quality and the mass production of the planting stocks of these species. In this regard, in vitro micropropagation is well suited to overcome the limitations of more conventional techniques for mass propagating vegetatively selected juvenile, mature, or even transgenic genotypes. Micropropagation of A. mangium either from seeds or from explants collected from outdoors is initiated on Murashige and Skoog (MS) basal medium supplemented with 4. 4 ?M BA. Microshoot cultures produced by axillary budding are further developed and maintained by regular subcultures every 60 days onto fresh MS culture medium added with 2. 2 ?M BA + 0. 1 ?M NAA. This procedure enhances the organogenic capacity for shoot multiplication by axillary budding, with average multiplication rates of 3 - 5 every 2 months, as well as for adventitious rooting. The rooting is initiated on Schenk and Hildebrandt culture medium containing 4 ?M IAA. The maintenance of shoot cultures in total darkness for 3 weeks increases the rooting rates reaching more than 70 %. The hybrid A. mangium × A. auriculiformis genotypes are subcultured at 2 -month intervals with an average multiplication rate of 3 and rooting rates of 95 - 100 % on a half-strength MS basal medium containing 1. 1 ?M NAA. The rooted microshoots are transferred to ex vitro controlled conditions for acclimatization and further growth, prior to transfer to the field, or use as stock plants for cost-effective and true-to-type mass production <b>by</b> <b>rooted</b> <b>cuttings.</b> (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R
40|$|During {{the early}} 1990 's in Sabah (East Malaysia), the Company Yayasan Sabah Group Biotech (“YSG Biotech”), jointly with CIRAD (France) Forest {{department}} scientists, {{has developed an}} efficient method for mass cloning superior teak trees, Tectona grandis, of any age <b>by</b> <b>rooted</b> <b>cuttings</b> and <b>by</b> micropropagation. The first clones were produced from eight superior (“Plus”) trees initially selected on phenotypic traits and growth in Sabah under 2, 500 mm/yr of rainfall without a distinct dry season. The outstanding field behaviour of the clonal offspring assessed locally rapidly led to their mass propagation to meet local and international demands. Since then, millions of clonal offspring have been produced from the eight “Plus” trees and the demands keep increasing due to the attractiveness of these materials. This context has prompted us to compile the information available on the field behaviour of these clones during their early stages of development in the different countries {{where they have been}} planted. The first observations indicated that the eight clones adapt surprisingly well {{to a wide range of}} environmental conditions, outperforming all other teak sources in terms of productivity and qualitative traits in every location where they had been planted. These include places with annual rainfall of 1, 000 mm and eight months of dry season, which is in total contrast to the conditions of their selection in Sabah. Nonetheless, sites with high rainfall evenly distributed throughout the year are observed to be more suitable to guarantee the best true-to-type development of these clones. One of their main assets is the early and rapid production of a long and straight clear bole with minimal lateral branching which helps to alleviate costly silvicultural practices such as pruning, while encouraging their utilization in agroforestry. The availability of these clonal materials has boosted large-scale establishment of clonal teak plantations in many tropical countries. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R
