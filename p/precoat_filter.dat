40|$|Filter {{tests were}} {{conducted}} to determine the most suitable filter for removing large quantities of aluminum corrosion product (boehmite) from reactor water. Filters tested included the following: wire-wound, sintered filter elements, sintered ceramic fllter elements, cotton stringwound filter elements, felted-cotton filter elements, cation resin, adsorption resin, diatomaceous earth <b>precoat</b> <b>filter,</b> and a wood-cellulose <b>precoat</b> <b>filter.</b> Parameters measured were flow rate, filter-influent and -effluent boehmite concentration, pressure drop, and final filter load. The pressure drop and efficiency of the filters was correlated with boehmite load. Boehmite deposits on filters as a nonporous gelatinous cake, and causes a rapidly increasing pressure drop. Tests indicate that the optimum load with filter elements and precoat filters is achieved at a pressure drop of 25 psi. Very little additional load {{can be obtained by}} operating to a higher pressure drop. Of the filters tested, the <b>precoat</b> <b>filter</b> snd 40 to 60 mesh cation resin were the more effective in removing boehmite. The efficiency of the <b>precoat</b> <b>filter</b> was in excess of 99 %, and the efficiency of the cation resin was for the most part in excess of 95 %. For various reasons, the other filters were eliminated from final consideration. The test program and available literature indicated that an element type <b>precoat</b> <b>filter</b> using wood cellulose as the precoat media would be most suitable for the proposed application.

40|$|The {{coolant supply}} uses in typical {{applications}} of metal cutting manufacturing on average 50 % of the electrical energy. A main optimization option is the retrofit of demandbased control {{strategies in the}} supply system. The study {{of the state of}} the art shows that a high energy saving potential remains in central <b>precoat</b> <b>filter</b> systems for coolant cleaning. The achievable flow rate through the <b>precoat</b> <b>filter</b> with the filter pump is reduced in filter operation due to the rising filter resistance. The precoat filters in the filter system need to be regenerated as soon as the achievable flow rate through the filters falls below a certain level. So far the filter pumps are throttled and operated constantly with maximum speed since this allows triggering the regeneration based on the filter pressure. Thereby the filter systems are operated constantly on an excessive power level, independent on the coolant demand. Within this thesis, an automation procedure for an energy efficient operation of central <b>precoat</b> <b>filter</b> systems is presented. The flow rates through the filters are regulated demand-based with a follow-up control using variable speed pumps. Thereby the energy intake is adapted based on the current coolant demand. The filter pressure is no longer utilizable to trigger the filter regeneration due to the variation of the flow rate. Therefore the filter pressure which would arise in uncontrolled operation is reconstructed in controlled operation with measured variables using a model. The presented procedure was successfully implemented in an existing central <b>precoat</b> <b>filter</b> system. The energy saving potential using the existing pumps and throttle setting is 62 %. Simulation results using filter pumps which allow in addition a reduction of the throttle lead to the conclusion that the energy saving potential is 73 %...|$|E
40|$|International audienceCompost liquor {{was treated}} using a {{combination}} of physico-chemical processes: (i) lime precipitation, (ii) filtration on a rotary drum vacuum <b>precoat</b> <b>filter,</b> (iii) ultrafiltration, and (iv) reverse osmosis. Laboratory Jar tests showed the interest of using lime to precipitate compost liquor. Yields of ammonium removal up to 90 % were obtained for an optimum lime concentration of 6 g/ L. A test was run at semi-industrial scale on 400 L of highly loaded compost liquor (COD: 15, 800 mg/L, ammoniacal pollution: 18, 433 mg NH 4 +-N/L, conductivity: 74, 000 Î¼S/cm) to demonstrate the potential of the treatment process proposed. Outstanding purification yields were obtained, especially 95 % of COD removal and 93 % of ammoniacal pollution removal...|$|E

40|$|Our {{previous}} studies demonstrated that <b>precoating</b> of <b>filter</b> fibers with biologically active tea tree oil (TTO) enhances physical collection efficiency of conventional heating, ventilation, {{and air conditioning}} (HVAC) filters, and provides cost effective and rapid inactivation of captured bacterial and fungal particles on the filter surface. The main {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the antiviral activity of two natural disinfectants, i. e., TTO and eucalyptus oil (EUO), against the influenza virus captured onto the filter surface. It was found that both tested oils possess strong antiviral properties when used as fiber coating materials, capable of inactivating captured microorganisms within 5 - 10 min of contact on the fiber surface. The antiviral activity of TTO was also successfully challenged in aerosol form by mixing viable airborne viral particles with oil droplets in the rotational aerosol chamber. The results look very promising for further development of virus inactivating procedures and technologies for air quality applications. No Full Tex...|$|R
40|$|Filter aids {{is used in}} air {{filtration}} system to fulfil the needs to expand {{the life span of}} filter media in fabric filtration system. It has been applied in various ways and <b>precoat</b> <b>filter</b> aids is one of the methods. In this study, the effect of a filter aids performance known as PrekotAC on pressure drop and particle penetration in a filtration system with varying filtration velocity of 1 to 3 m/min was evaluated. The PrekotAC is a combination of PrekotTM and activated carbon mixed in different weight compositions. Result showed that the pressure drop across the fabric media decreases with the addition of PrekotTM in the PrekotAC admixture due to its wide range of non-uniform particle size distribution that gives higher porosity of filter cake during filtration process. The study also showed that the total particle penetration through the fabric media was proportionally related to addition of PrekotTM in the PrekotAC admixture under a constant material loading. The study suggests that the addition of PrekotTM in the formulation of filter aids significantly affect both pressure drop and particle penetration of the fabric filter media...|$|E
40|$|The {{main focus}} {{of this study was}} to find out the {{suitable}} coupling for the regeneration of a complex concentrated ternary brine (salt/corn syrup/water) after fish fillet salting using separation technologies. Experiments were designed for analytical purposes with three selected waste brines originating from different clean solutions and salting process conditions, and processing as well as plant parameters (for example, economics, environment, technical availabilities) were considered. In this regard, several chemical and physical pretreatments were first conducted to increase the size of suspended solids (SS) and to reduce the proteinaceous matters in the suspension. Treated suspensions and their separated phases after settling were subjected to various filtration experiments. Crossflow micro- and ultra-filtration pilot trials (tubular ceramic membranes) showed their inefficiency in terms of permeation flux density, even at high temperature. This was mainly because of the high viscosity of solutions which in turn lowered the shear stress near the membrane. Laboratory- and industrial-scale cake filtration experiments using a rotary vacuum <b>precoat</b> <b>filter</b> (RVPF) were also conducted to find the optimal filtration conditions with the help of a unifying filterability parameter. The best coupling appeared to be pH pretreatment, followed by a settling time adjusted to the salting process conditions. Using body feed for the SS-rich phase, a differential RVPF filtration of the settled phases allowed the regeneration of solution with minimal filter-aid consumption...|$|E
40|$|An {{elevated}} risk {{associated with}} exposure to bioaerosols calls for {{the development and implementation}} of new, efficient and cost effective methods of airborne biological particle control. While filtration remains the most efficient method of removal of airborne particles, some issues related to possible re-entrainment of captured particles from the rear face of the filter back into the air carrier have to be addressed. Obviously, viable biological particles blown off from the filter surface could still cause substantial damage to human and animal health and contaminate the ambient air environment. A new technology utilizing coating of filter fibres by biologically active tea tree oil (TTO) is considered in this paper. It was found that <b>precoating</b> of <b>filter</b> fibres with TTO and following usage of such filters for bioaerosol control could provide significant benefits in terms of rapidly inactivating captured microorganisms and, minimizing the number of live/viable particles possibly blown off from the filter by the air. Three bacterial strains with a range of biological stress sensitivity were used in this research. It was found that 99 % of stress sensitive Eschericliia coli and Pseudomons fluorescens are inactivated on the surface of the TTO coated filter within 8 and 2 min of exposure, respectively. A robust strain of Bacillus subtilis demonstrated inactivation in the order of one logarithm per 30 min of process operation. These results look very promising for the implementation of this new technology for the control of air quality in domestic and industrial applications. No Full Tex...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Stromal cell-derived factor- 1 (SDF- 1) is a {{chemoattractant}} {{involved in}} hematopoietic progenitor cell (HPC) trafficking {{to the bone}} mar-row. We studied the role of bone marrow endothe-lial proteoglycans (PGs) in SDF- 1 -mediated migra-tion of HPC using a transwell assay. A subclone of progenitor cell line KG- 1 (KG- 1 v) was used, dis-playing CXCR 4 -dependent transmigration. Cell surface PGs on bone marrow endothelial cell line 4 LHBMEC did not mediate SDF- 1 -induced trans-endothelial migration. In contrast, transwell <b>filters</b> <b>precoated</b> with various glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) enhanced migration toward SDF- 1. SDF- 1 -in-duced migration was reduced by degradation of heparan sulfate in subendothelial matrix produced by 4 LHBMEC. The stimulating effect of GAGs {{was caused by the}} formation of a stable haptotactic SDF- 1 gradient, as SDF- 1 bound to immobilized GAGs and triggered migration. Soluble heparan sulfate enhanced SDF- 1 -induced migration dose-dependently, suggesting that SDF- 1 -heparan sul-fate complexes optimized SDF- 1 presentation. In conclusion, we provide evidence that PGs in the subendothelial matrix establish an SDF- 1 gradient guiding migrating HPC into the bone marrow. J...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{migration}} of tumor cells through basement membranes and extracellular matrices {{is an integral}} component of tumor invasion and metastasis. Laminin and fibronectin are two basement membrane- and extracellular matrix-associated noncollagenous glycoproteins that {{have been shown to}} promote both cell adhesion and motility. Purified preparations of laminin and fibronectin stimulated the directed {{migration of}} B 16 murine metastatic melanoma cells in vitro as assessed in modified Boyden chambers. The stimulation of migration occurred over a concentration range of 1 - 100 P,g/ml of laminin or fibronectin, with a peak response occurring between 12. 5 and 25 cg/ml. The maximal response of these cells was 80 - 120 -fold higher than control migration. Affinity-purified antibody preparations specifically abrogated the migration of these cells in response to the respective proteins. Tumor cells in suspension were preincubated in physiologic levels of plasma fibronectin prior to assay to partially mimic what occurs when a metastasizing cell is in the blood stream. This preincubation with plasma fibronectin had no effect on the subsequent migration of cells in response to either laminin or fibronectin. Furthermore, experiments using <b>filters</b> <b>precoated</b> with fibronectin or laminin indicated that these cells could migrate by haptotaxis to these two proteins. W...|$|R
