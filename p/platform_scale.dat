25|$|Also {{known as}} the Fairbanks Scale, the <b>platform</b> <b>scale</b> is a benched scale for {{measuring}} the counterbalance weight of loaded objects at ground level, thus eliminating {{the use of a}} hoist. After a series of trial and error in his designs, Thaddeus Fairbanks patented his invention in 1830. E & T Fairbanks & Company, a business partnership between Thaddeus and his brother, Erastus Fairbanks, exported their famous scales around the world to exotic locations such as England, China, Cuba, Russia, and India due to the high demand.|$|E
50|$|In 1840, Fairbanks became {{confidential}} {{clerk of}} E. & T. Fairbanks & Co., {{makers of the}} first <b>platform</b> <b>scale,</b> eventually becoming partner and then president.|$|E
5000|$|Fairbanks' {{most famous}} {{invention}} then became the <b>platform</b> <b>scale</b> for weighing heavy objects. These are {{commonly known as}} the Fairbanks Scales, for which he patented a design in 1830. Before this time, accurate weighing of objects required hanging them from a balancing beam; as a result, particularly heavy or ungainly objects could not be weighed accurately. A <b>platform</b> <b>scale,</b> if large enough, could weigh an entire wagon. In 1834 Fairbanks and his brothers formed [...] "E. and T. Fairbanks and Company" [...] to manufacture and sell these platform scales.|$|E
50|$|At age 18, {{he entered}} Fairbanks Scales, the family {{business}} which manufactured <b>platform</b> <b>scales.</b> He {{became president of the}} company in 1888. Fairbanks was also an officer and director in a number of railroad, mining, manufacturing, banking, and telegraph businesses.|$|R

50|$|Load {{cells are}} used in several types of {{measuring}} instruments such as laboratory balances, industrial <b>scales,</b> <b>platform</b> <b>scales</b> and universal testing machines.

50|$|Two {{governors}} {{of the state}} of Vermont were from Barnet: Erastus Fairbanks, who served two terms from 1852-1853 and 1860-1861, and his son, Horace Fairbanks, who served from 1876 to 1878. Horace Fairbanks is also known for manufacturing the first <b>platform</b> <b>scale.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Thaddeus Fairbanks (January 17, 1796 [...] - [...] April 12, 1886) was an American {{inventor}}. He was {{an inventor}} of heating and cook stoves, cast iron plows, and other items. His greatest success was the invention and manufacture of the <b>platform</b> <b>scale,</b> which allowed the weighing of large objects accurately.|$|E
50|$|In 1826 Fairbanks {{received}} {{a patent on}} a cast iron plow and a refrigerator. In 1830 he received his patent on the <b>platform</b> <b>scale</b> known as the Fairbanks Scales. In 1842 Fairbanks founded St. Johnsbury Academy with his brother Erastus. He also founded the St. Johnsbury Athenaeum, St. Johnsbury Rotary Planetarium, and the Fairbanks Museum.|$|E

50|$|After {{almost a}} century of {{national}} and international expansion the company {{was taken over by}} GEC in 1979. Keith Hodgkinson, managing director at the time, completed the turn-around from mechanical to electronic weighing with a complete overhaul of the product range of retail <b>scales</b> and industrial <b>platform</b> <b>scales.</b> In 1993 GEC took over the Dutch-based company Berkel and the Avery-Berkel name was introduced. In 2000 the business was in turn acquired by the US-American company Weigh-Tronix, who already owned Salter, and is today operating as Avery Weigh-Tronix.|$|R
5000|$|Scales -Fork truck-mounted scales enable {{operators}} to efficiently weigh the pallets they handle without interrupting their workflow by travelling to a <b>platform</b> <b>scale.</b> Scales are available that provide legal-for-trade weights for operations that involve billing by weight.

50|$|Paddock's sister Phebe (1760-1853) was {{the wife}} of Joseph Fairbanks (1763-1846). They were the parents of Thaddeus Fairbanks, Erastus Fairbanks, and Joseph Paddock Fairbanks (1806-1855). The Fairbanks {{brothers}} were the developers of the <b>platform</b> <b>scale,</b> and {{the founders of the}} E & T Fairbanks Company. In addition, Erastus Fairbanks was a prominent Whig and Republican who twice served as Governor of Vermont.|$|E
50|$|Finally {{settling}} in St. Johnsbury, Vermont, in 1824, Fairbanks formed a partnership, E. & T. Fairbanks & Co., {{with his brother}} Thaddeus for the manufacture of scales, stoves and plows. Thaddeus Fairbanks later invented the first <b>platform</b> <b>scale,</b> which {{made it possible to}} calculate the weight of farm products and other goods shipped by wagon and railroad car; the device proved so successful that the renamed Fairbanks Scales company became the largest employer in the state.|$|E

Portable platform scales are found in almost every hardware store, physician's office, and manufacturing factory throughout the United States. The first railway track <b>platform</b> <b>scale</b> patent was granted to Fairbanks on January 13, 1857, as Patent No. 16,381. In 1916 the company was purchased by Fairbanks, Morse and Company. Ownership of the company has since changed several times, but Fairbanks Scales continue to be made in St. Johnsbury to this day.|$|E
50|$|The St. Johnsbury Athenaeum, in St. Johnsbury, Vermont, is a {{combined}} library and art gallery.

The Athenaeum is also noted for the American landscape paintings and books in its collection and its having been funded by Horace Fairbanks, manufacturer of the worlds first <b>platform</b> <b>scale.</b> The art collection contains a number of Hudson River School paintings.

50|$|Fairbanks Morse and Company {{began in}} 1823 when {{inventor}} Thaddeus Fairbanks opened an ironworks in St. Johnsbury, Vermont, to manufacture {{two of his}} patented inventions: a cast iron plow and a heating stove. In 1829 he started a hemp dressing business for which he built the machinery. Though unsuccessful in fabricating for fiber factories, another invention by Thaddeus, the <b>platform</b> <b>scale,</b> {{formed the basis for}} a great enterprise. That device was patented in June 1832, and a generation later, the E. & T. Fairbanks & Company was selling thousands of scales, first in the United States, later in Europe, South America and even Imperial China. Scales were integral to business as marine and railway shippers charged by weight. Fairbanks scales won 63 medals over the years in international competition. It became the leading manufacturer in the US, and the best-known company the world over until Henry Ford and the Ford Corporation assumed this title in the 1920s.|$|E

40|$|Crop yield map is {{a useful}} means to {{quantify}} yield variations within the fields {{and to provide a}} scientific basis for implementing site-specific crop management strategies. This research explores the feasibility of developing a new silage yield monitoring system by employing a new mass flow sensor based on using the momentum of chopped material impacting a pivoted plate loaded by a retractable spring installed {{at the end of a}} chopper discharge spout. A precise rotary potentiometer was used to measure the degree of pivoted plate rotation. To save and process the output voltage of the potentiometer, a programmable circuit comprising of AVR microcontroller ATMEGA series and MAX 232 microchip was used and the output data was sent to a portable computer for further processing. To calibrate the output signal of the sensor versus instantaneous chopped material flow rate, the chopper was fed artificially with predetermined mass flow rates of 6, 8 and 10 kg s- 1 of silage corn at five replications for each feeding rate. The results of statistical analysis showed high correlation between degrees of the pivoted-plate rotation and instantaneous feed rates with adjusted R 2 of 0. 98. To evaluate the accuracy of mass flow rate estimation, a <b>platform</b> <b>scale</b> weighing system was used during the field tests.
