5|$|Soluble epoxide {{hydrolase}} (sEH) is a bifunctional {{enzyme that}} in humans is encoded by the EPHX2 gene. sEH {{is a member}} of the epoxide hydrolase family. This enzyme, found in both the cytosol and peroxisomes, binds to specific epoxides and converts them to the corresponding diols. A different region of this protein also has lipid-phosphate <b>phosphatase</b> <b>activity.</b> Mutations in the EPHX2 gene have been associated with familial hypercholesterolemia.|$|E
5|$|The form of sEH in the {{intracellular}} {{environment is}} a homodimer with two distinct activities {{in two separate}} structural domains of each monomer: the C-terminal epoxide hydrolase activity (soluble epoxide hydrolase: EC 3.3.2.10) and the N-terminal <b>phosphatase</b> <b>activity</b> (lipid-phosphate phosphatase: EC 3.1.3.76). sEH converts epoxides, or three membered cyclic ethers, to their corresponding diols through {{the addition of a}} molecule of water. The resulting diols are more water-soluble than the parent epoxides, and so are more readily excreted by the organism.|$|E
25|$|TFIIF and FCP1 {{cooperate}} for RNAPII recycling. FCP1, the CTD phosphatase, {{interacts with}} RNA polymerase II.

The nonphosphorylated form, RNAPIIA, is recruited to the initiation complex, whereas the elongating polymerase is found with RNAPII0. RNAPII cycles during transcription. CTD <b>phosphatase</b> <b>activity</b> is regulated by two GTFs (TFIIF and TFIIB). The large subunit of TFIIF (RAP74) stimulates the CTD <b>phosphatase</b> <b>activity,</b> whereas TFIIB inhibits TFIIF-mediated stimulation.

In the first dimension, protein samples were separated by a MicroRotofor, a liquid-phase isoelectric focusing, in {{the presence or absence}} of urea. In the second dimension, fractionated proteins by the MicroRotofor were resolved by a native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of 20 mM 2 -mercaptoethanol. After electrophoresis, the polyacrylamide gel was directly immersed in a reaction mixture containing 4 -methylumbelliferyl phosphate (MUP), a fluorogenic substrate, and <b>phosphatase</b> <b>activities</b> were detected as fluorescent bands. In this assay, a variety of <b>phosphatase</b> <b>activities</b> were clearly detected in gel when the tissue extracts were separated by the MicroRotofor in the presence of 1. 5 M urea. Furthermore, after detecting <b>phosphatase</b> <b>activities</b> in polyacrylamide gel at neutral pH, <b>phosphatase</b> <b>activities</b> at acidic pH could be detected by immersing the gel in sodium citrate buffer (pH 3. 0).

40|$|Abstract: The {{presence}} of relatively high non-specific <b>phosphatase</b> <b>activities</b> are known in various plant tissues. These enzymes also catalyze {{the removal of}} inorganic phosphate from nucleoside monophosphates. According to published reports, so far, the experimental investigations, concerning the 5 ’-nucleotidase activity, have been mostly carried out without consideration of the non-specific <b>phosphatase</b> <b>activities</b> in crude enzymic extracts. However, few researchers have been included some inhibitors of these phosphatases, such as NaMoO or KF, in assay mixtures. But phosphatases are not 4 completely inhibited by these inhibitors and, therefore, interfere the activity of 5 ’-nucleotidase. Thus, the non-specific <b>phosphatase</b> <b>activities</b> were determined in crude enzymic extracts by using p-nitrophenyl phosphate as substrate and the apparent 5 ’-nucleotidase activity was, first time, corrected accordingly in this present work...|$|R

For example, ser/thr phosphatases PP2Cα/β suppress activity of p38s MAPK through direct interaction as well as suppression of MKKs/TAK1 in mammalian cells. Hematopoietic PTP (HePTP) and striatal-enriched phosphatase (STEP) bind to MAPKs through a kinase-interaction motif (KIM) and inactivates them by dephosphorylating the phosphotyrosine residue in their activation loop. DUSPs, which have a docking domain to MAPKs and dual-specific <b>phosphatase</b> <b>activity,</b> can also bind to p38 MAPKs and dephosphorylate of both phosphotyrosine and phosphothreonine residues. In addition to these phosphatases, other molecular components such as Hsp90-Cdc37 chaperone complex can also modulate p38 MAPK autophosphorylation activity and prevents non-canonical activation.|$|E

40|$|Alterations {{of protein}} kinase and protein <b>phosphatase</b> <b>activities</b> have been {{described}} {{in a number of}} tumors. Redox changes, such as in conditions of oxidant stress, have been reported to affect the cellular protein kinase/phosphatase balance. A basal production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2), exists in tumor cells, and the membrane-bound ecto-enzyme gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) - overexpressed in a variety of malignant tumors - is one of the mechanisms capable of promoting such a production. The present study was aimed to verify the interactions of GGT <b>activity</b> with protein <b>phosphatase</b> and kinase <b>activities</b> in Me 665 / 2 / 60 melanoma cells, expressing high levels of this enzyme and exhibiting both basal and GGT-dependent production of hydrogen peroxide. An increase of total phosphatase as well as tyrosine <b>phosphatase</b> <b>activities</b> was observed after treatment of cells with both micromolar H 2 O 2 and GGT stimulation. Accordingly, stimulation of GGT resulted in decreased levels of phosphotyrosine. On the other hand, when serine/threonine <b>phosphatase</b> <b>activities</b> were selectively analyzed, both H 2 O 2 treatment and GGT stimulation caused their down-regulation. The data reported suggest that basal conditions of oxidant stress in melanoma may represent a factor contributing to the redox regulation of protein phosphorylation, and that GGT-mediated prooxidant reactions may participate in the process. As basal oxidant stress and expression of GGT activity are present in a variety of malignant tumors besides melanoma, these phenomena likely represent general mechanisms participating in the alteration of intracellular transduction during carcinogenesis. © 2003 Elsevier Science B.

40|$|The Bacillus subtilis DesK/DesR two-component system {{regulates the}} {{expression}} of the des gene coding for the Δ 5 acyl lipid desaturase. It is believed that a decrease in membrane lipid fluidity activates the DesK/DesR signal transduction cascade, which results in synthesis of the Δ 5 acyl lipid desaturase and desaturation of membrane phospholipids. These newly synthesized unsaturated fatty acids then act as negative signals of des transcription, thus generating a regulatory metabolic loop that optimizes membrane fluidity. We previously suggested that DesK is a bifunctional enzyme with both kinase and <b>phosphatase</b> <b>activities</b> that could assume different signaling states in response to changes in the fluidity of membrane lipids. However, no direct experimental evidence supported this proposed model. In this study, we show that the C-terminal fragment of the DesK protein (DesKC) indeed acts as an autokinase. Addition of the response regulator DesR to phosphorylated DesKC resulted in rapid transfer of the phosphoryl group to DesR. Further, phosphorylated DesR can be dephosphorylated in the presence of DesKC, thus demonstrating that the sensor kinase has the ability to covalently modify DesR through both kinase and <b>phosphatase</b> <b>activities.</b> We also present evidence that DesKC might be locked in a kinase-dominant state in vivo and that its activities are not affected either in vivo or in vitro by unsaturated fatty acids.

40|$|The thesis {{describes}} {{a study on}} the ecophysiology of the moss Hydrogonium fontanum (C. Mail.) Jaeg., the dominant plant at a waterfall in Saudi Arabia. The influence of environmental variables and water stress on the growth, stress metabolite accumulation and <b>phosphatase</b> <b>activities</b> of the moss was studied in laboratory axenic culture along with observations and experiments conducted in the field. The variables chosen for growth experiments were light flux, flooding, nutrient concentrations and water stress. For <b>phosphatase</b> <b>activities,</b> the influence of temperature, pH, ions, water stress were studied. Differences were found in <b>phosphatase</b> <b>activities</b> for rhlzoids, protonema and leafy shoots of the moss and, therefore, the phosphomonoesterase (PMEase) and phosphodiesterase (PDEase) activities of these fractions were also investigated. H. fontanum was originally collected from the tufa-depositing waterfall (Water chemistry - 44 mg 1 (^- 1) Na, 44 mg 1 (^- 1) Ca). High Na and Ca had significant positive effect on yield of the protonema under the laboratory conditions. Low light intensity (10 µmol photon m(^- 2) s(^- 1)) decreased the yield, but high light intensity (90 µmol photon m(^- 2) s(^- 1)) increased the yield of the protonema. The moss showed no response to water stress in respect to praline accumulation. Protein content decreased significantly over 48 h with increase in water stress. The Influence of water stress was greater in terms of dry weight and chlorophyll content changes in protonema than in leafy shoots. The protonema was capable of using various organic P substrates as sources of phosphorus and showed both PMEase and PDEase activities. PMEase and PDEase activities were detectable in all moss fractions (rhizoids, protonema, leafy shoots). Laboratory grown material showed higher activities than field grown material. Rhizoids produced the highest PMEase and PDEase activities among the moss fractions. Some leafy shoots collected from the field had low phosphorus content with high <b>phosphatase</b> <b>activities,</b> while others had high phosphorus content with low <b>phosphatase</b> <b>activities.</b> Changes in <b>phosphatase</b> <b>activities</b> in batch culture were studied in relation to growth rate. PMEase activity was first evident when cellular P was 1. 15 % with low activity (0. 117 µmol pNP mg d. wt(^- 1) h(^- 1)) and PDEase appeared 4 days later when cellular P was 0. 54 %. The activities increased up to day 12 after which the activities maintained this level. The optimum temperatures, measured over a period of 1 h, for PMEase and PDEase activities were 60 ºC and 65 ºC with pH optima of 5. 5 - 6. 0 and 6. 4 - 6. 8, respectively. Of the six ions tested, Ca, Zn and P had significant inhibitory effects on the activities at the highest concentration used (10 mM). Drying the moss decreases PMEase and PDEase activities by about 23 % and 21 % (5 -d) and 3. 7 and 2, 8 times (3 months), respectively. Water stress (PEG treatment) also reduced significantly the activities of PMEase and PDEase with a greater effect on the activity of the latter. A brief comparison in PMEase activity using two different substrates p- nitrophenyl phosphate (pNPP) and 4 -methylumbelliferyl phosphate (4 -MUP) was made to investigate the pH optima and time course.
