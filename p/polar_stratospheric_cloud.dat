50|$|While {{the polar}} stratospheric clouds {{could explain the}} {{reduction}} of the equator to pole temperature gradient and the increased temperatures at the poles during the early Eocene, there are a few drawbacks to maintaining polar stratospheric clouds {{for an extended period of}} time. Separate model runs were used to determine the sustainability of the polar stratospheric clouds. Methane would need to be continually released and sustained to maintain the lower stratospheric water vapor. Increasing amounts of ice and condensation nuclei would be need to be high for the <b>polar</b> <b>stratospheric</b> <b>cloud</b> to sustain itself and eventually expand.|$|E
50|$|Methane is an {{important}} factor in the creation of the primary Type II polar stratospheric clouds that were created in the early Eocene. Since water vapor is the only supporting substance used in Type II polar stratospheric clouds, the presence of water vapor in the lower stratosphere is necessary where in most situations the presence of water vapor in the lower stratosphere is rare. When methane is oxidized, a significant amount of water vapor is released. Another requirement for polar stratospheric clouds is cold temperatures to ensure condensation and cloud production. <b>Polar</b> <b>stratospheric</b> <b>cloud</b> production, since it requires the cold temperatures, is usually limited to nighttime and winter conditions. With this combination of wetter and colder conditions in the lower stratosphere, polar stratospheric clouds could have formed over wide areas in Polar Regions.|$|E
50|$|Another method {{considered}} for producing the warm polar temperatures were <b>polar</b> <b>stratospheric</b> <b>clouds.</b> <b>Polar</b> <b>stratospheric</b> <b>clouds</b> are clouds {{that occur in}} the lower stratosphere at very low temperatures. <b>Polar</b> <b>stratospheric</b> <b>clouds</b> have a great impact on radiative forcing. Due to their minimal albedo properties and their optical thickness, <b>polar</b> <b>stratospheric</b> <b>clouds</b> act similar to a greenhouse gas and traps outgoing longwave radiation. Different types of <b>polar</b> <b>stratospheric</b> <b>clouds</b> occur in the atmosphere: <b>polar</b> <b>stratospheric</b> <b>clouds</b> that are created due to interactions with nitric or sulfuric acid and water (Type I) or <b>polar</b> <b>stratospheric</b> <b>clouds</b> that are created with only water ice (Type II).|$|R
50|$|To {{test the}} <b>polar</b> <b>stratospheric</b> <b>clouds</b> {{effects on the}} Eocene climate, models were run {{comparing}} the effects of <b>polar</b> <b>stratospheric</b> <b>clouds</b> at the poles {{to an increase in}} atmospheric carbon dioxide. The <b>polar</b> <b>stratospheric</b> <b>clouds</b> had a warming effect on the poles, increasing temperatures by up to 20 °C in the winter months. A multitude of feedbacks also occurred in the models due to the <b>polar</b> <b>stratospheric</b> clouds’ presence. Any ice growth was slowed immensely and would lead to any present ice melting. Only the poles were affected with the change in temperature and the tropics were unaffected, which with an increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide would also cause the tropics to increase in temperature. Due to the warming of the troposphere from the increased greenhouse effect of the <b>polar</b> <b>stratospheric</b> <b>clouds,</b> the stratosphere would cool and would potentially increase the amount of <b>polar</b> <b>stratospheric</b> <b>clouds.</b>|$|R
40|$|The role of <b>polar</b> <b>stratospheric</b> <b>clouds</b> in the {{formation}} of the Antarctic ozone hole is considered. Several researchers have suggested that the decrease in ozone over Antarctica is related to the <b>polar</b> <b>stratospheric</b> <b>clouds</b> (PSCs) which had been observed in the antarctic winter stratosphere.

Evidence that the <b>polar</b> <b>stratospheric</b> <b>clouds</b> are composed of frozen nitric acid is considered. It is suggested that the evaporation of the clouds, in late August and September, will release HOCl and HNO 3 to the environment. This could be followed by the photodissociation of HOCl to OH and Cl, which would very effectively destroy ozone. However, the ozone destruction mechanism could be halted when enough of the evaporated nitric acid is photolized...|$|R
