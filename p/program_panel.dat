He {{was a member of the}} United States Department of Energy Human Genome Research <b>Program</b> <b>Panel</b> in 1991, and a member of the Steering Committee for the Rutgers-Princeton DIMACS center special year on Mathematical Support for Molecular Biology from 1994-1995. In 1995, he co-organized the Dagstuhl Conference on Molecular Bioinformatics. He has been a member of the editorial board of the Journal of Computational Biology since its inception in 1996. At the University of California at Davis, he was part of a three-person group that proposed the development of the UC Davis Genomics Center, and served as a member of the Genomics Center Steering Committee (1999-2003), and helped to build an interdisciplinary community of biologists and computer scientists working together on genomics problems. Finally, in 2004, Gusfield helped propose the IEEE/ACM Transactions on Computational Biology and Bioinformatics (TCBB), one of the few journals specifically oriented towards computer science and mathematical researchers working in computational biology. He served as its founding Editor in Chief until 2009, and later as Chair of the TCBB Steering Committee. He was more recently a invited visiting scientist at the Simons Institute for the Theory of Computing at UC Berkeley during two of its semester-long programs (first on Evolution, and later on Algorithmic Challenges in Genomics). In addition, Gusfield has been the PhD advisor or postdoctoral mentor for many well known computer scientists working in computational biology, including Prof. Oliver Eulenstein (Iowa State University), Prof. Ming-Yang Kao (Northwestern University), Prof. John Kececioglu (Arizona), Prof. Yun S.

We find that the program reduced aggregate unemployment, though it attracted as many people into the workforce from inactivity as it did people who would have been otherwise unemployed.

40|$|Monitoring of {{hepatitis}} B virus (HBV) DNA in serum by molecular methods {{has become the}} standard for assessment of the replicative activity of HBV. Several molecular assays for the detection and quantification of HBV DNA have been described. However, they usually lack automated sample preparation. Moreover, those assays, {{which are based on}} PCR, are limited by a short dynamic range (2 to 3 log units). In the present study, the use of RealArt HBV LC PCR Reagents in conjunction with automated extraction on the COBAS AMPLIPREP analyzer was evaluated. Members of an HBV proficiency <b>program</b> <b>panel</b> were tested; linearity, interassay, and intra-assay variations were determined. The performance of the assay in a routine clinical laboratory was evaluated with a total of 117 clinical specimens. When members of the HBV proficiency <b>program</b> <b>panel</b> were tested by the new molecular assay, the results were found to be within ± 0. 5 log unit of the results obtained by reference laboratories. Determination of linearity resulted in a quasilinear curve over more than 6 log units. The interassay variation of the RealArt HBV LC PCR Reagents by use of the automated sample preparation protocol ranged from 16 to 73 %, and the intra-assay variation ranged from 9 to 40 %. When clinical samples were tested by the new assay with the automated sample preparation protocol and the results were compared with those obtained by the COBAS AMPLICOR HBV MONITOR Test with manual sample preparation, the results for 76 % of all samples with positive results by both tests were found to be within ± 0. 5 log unit and the results for another 18 % were found to be within between 0. 5 and 1. 0 log unit. In conclusion, the real-time PCR assay with automated sample preparation proved to be suitable for the routine molecular laboratory and required less hands-on time...|$|E

An association mapping for 12 agronomic traits was carried out using a core collection of rice consisting of 150 landraces (Panel 1) with 274 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers, and the mapping results were further verified using a Chinese national rice micro-core collection (Panel 2) and a collection from a global molecular breeding <b>program</b> (<b>Panel</b> 3).

40|$|Modeling of the rainfall-runoff {{process is}} of both {{scientific}} and practical significance. Many of the currently used mathematical models of hydrologic systems were developed a genera­ tion ago. Much {{of the effort}} since then has focused on refining these models rather than on developing new models based on improved scientific understanding. In the past few years, however, a renewed effort {{has been made to}} improve both our fundamental understanding of hydrologic processes and to exploit technological advances in computing and remote sensing. It is against this background that the NATO Advanced Study Institute on Recent Advances in the Modeling of Hydrologic Systems was organized. The idea for holding a NATO ASI on this topic grew out of an informal discussion between one of the co-directors and Professor Francisco Nunes-Correia at a previous NATO ASI held at Tucson, Arizona in 1985. The Special <b>Program</b> <b>Panel</b> on Global Transport Mechanisms in the Geo-Sciences of the NATO Scientific Affairs Division agreed to sponsor the ASI and an organizing committee was formed.
