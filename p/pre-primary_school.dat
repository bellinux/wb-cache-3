25|$|In India, {{there are}} only {{informal}} directives pertaining to pre-primary education, for which pre-primary schools and sections need no affiliation.

Typically, children spend 3 to 4 years of their time in <b>pre-primary</b> <b>school</b> after which they are eligible to attend 1st Standard in Primary School which falls under HRD ministry norms. Primary education is now compulsory in India, and accompanied with mid-day meals, {{in most parts of the}} country run by the government. Pre-primary is not mandatory, however preferred.

25|$|As toddler, Albert {{attended}} an English Catholic <b>pre-primary</b> <b>school,</b> where he heard and learnt his first English. This move seemed baffling to some, as the Calvinist and Boer patriot general Hertzog was a staunch proponent of Afrikaans language rights, especially in education. In 1910, {{after the birth}} of the Union of South Africa, general Hertzog was appointed in a dual portfolio as Minister of Justice and Minister of Native Affairs. The family therefore moved to Pretoria, and occupied a house west of the Union Buildings. His father sent him to the Arcadia Skool, but Albert was disappointed that the school had a headmistress, and, though in the city, differed nothing from a farm school. Although only eleven years old, Albert left on the afternoon of his first day, and enrolled at Pretoria Boys High School. After the schism between general Hertzog and Prime Minister Louis Botha, which led to Hertzog's dismissal from the cabinet, the family moved back to Bloemfontein, where Albert attended Grey College. He matriculated with a First Class in 1916, with the subjects Dutch, English, Latin, Mathematics, and Physical Science.|$|E
