40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} {{the implementation of}} an intervention to increase the delivery of adolescent preventive services within a large managed care organization. Target health areas were tobacco, alcohol, sexual behavior, and safety (seat belt and helmet use). DATA SOURCE/STUDY DESIGN: Adolescent reports of clinician screening and counseling were obtained from adolescents who attended well visits with their primary care providers. A prepost study design was used to {{evaluate the}} preventive services intervention. The intervention had three components: (1) 89 clinicians from three outpatient pediatric clinics attended a training to increase the delivery of preventive services; (2) customized adolescent screening and provider charting forms were integrated into the clinics; and (3) the resources of a health educator were provided to the clinics. DATA COLLECTION: Following a visit, adolescents completed surveys reporting on clinician screening and counseling for each of the target risk areas. Preimplementation (three months), 104 adolescents completed surveys. <b>Postimplementation</b> of the training, tools, and health educator intervention, 211 adolescents completed surveys (five months). For 18 months <b>postimplementation</b> clinicians delivered services and 998 adolescents completed surveys. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Chi-square analyses of changes in screening from preimplementation to <b>postimplementation</b> showed that screening increased in all areas (p <. 000), with an average increase in screening rates from 47 percent to 94 percent. <b>Postimplementation</b> counseling in all areas also increased significantly, with an average increase in counseling rates from 39 percent to 91 percent. There were slight decreases in screening from <b>postimplementation</b> to follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: This study offers support for the efficacy of providing training, tools, and resources as a method for increasing preventive screening and counseling of adolescents across multiple risky health behaviors during a routine office visit...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY: Background  The care of {{patients}} with leg ulceration has developed over the past 15 years, although there is little information available to determine how these changes have affected clinical and patient defined outcomes. OBJECTIVES: To describe and evaluate {{the implementation of a}} leg ulcer strategy. PATIENTS/METHODS: This study used a pre- and <b>postimplementation</b> evaluation within population-based services within the boundaries of community services providing leg ulcer care. Evidence-based leg ulcer services were developed, including standardized assessment using Doppler ultrasound, rationalization of treatment using multilayer elastic high compression, development of referral criteria and acute service support. Complete ulcer healing rates, health-related quality of life and use of health resources were evaluated after 12 weeks in both pre- and <b>postimplementation</b> cycles. RESULTS: A total of 955 patients were evaluated (518 preimplementation, 437 <b>postimplementation).</b> The levels of assessment and treatment were poor prior to the change in practice with just one patient having evidence of correct assessment and 49 (11...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the impact of implementation of an anticoagulation protocol involving dosing and monitoring of unfractionated heparin (UFH) and low-molecular-weight heparin, specifically enoxaparin, for the treatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE), and/or acute coronary syndromes (ACS). Methods: Patients with a primary diagnosis of DVT, PE, and/or ACS treated with UFH and/or enoxaparin were included. Data were collected on patients admitted to a community hospital during February 2008 (preimplementation) and February 2009 (<b>postimplementation).</b> Results: Forty-six patients were included in the preimplementation group and 25 patients in the <b>postimplementation</b> group. Forty-six percent of patients were dosed properly in the preimplementation group (UFH 38 % and enoxaparin 50 %) compared to 76 % in the <b>postimplementation</b> group (UFH 56 % and enoxaparin 88 %; P. 023). Fifty-four percent of patients were monitored properly in the preimplementation group (UFH 31 % and enoxaparin 67 %) compared to 68 % in the <b>postimplementation</b> group (UFH 56 % and enoxaparin 75 %; P. 318). Conclusion: Standardized dosing with a multidisciplinary-managed anticoagulation protocol significantly increased proper dosing of anticoagulation therapy; however, the protocol did not significantly improve proper monitoring. A lack of understanding of the need for baseline laboratory data contributes to improper monitoring.

40|$|PURPOSE: Acute pain {{occurs in}} over 50 % of hospitalized children. The {{accuracy}} of this diagnosis has been underexplored in the literature, {{as has the}} role of training to implement pain assessment. This study analyzed the accuracy of acute pain diagnoses after {{the implementation of a}} systematic evaluation of pain (study intervention). METHOD: The sample was divided into: pre- and postintervention. The Nursing Diagnosis Accuracy Scale, which scores accuracy as null, low, moderate, or high, was used. RESULTS: In the <b>postimplementation,</b> acute pain was diagnosed more often. However, accuracy only improved in the moderate category. CONCLUSION: Diagnosis of acute pain increased in the <b>postimplementation</b> period, but accuracy did not.

At Aomori Prefectural Central Hospital, physicians carried out VCM therapeutic drug monitoring {{based on their}} experience, because pharmacists {{did not participate in}} the dose adjustment. We evaluated the impact of an Antimicrobial Stewardship Program (ASP) on attaining target VCM trough concentrations and pharmacokinetics (PK) /pharmacodynamics (PD) parameters in patients with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections. Materials and methods: The ASP was introduced in April 2012. We implemented a prospective audit of prescribed VCM dosages and provided feedback based on measured VCM trough concentrations. In a retrospective pre- and postcomparison study from April 2007 to December 2011 (preimplementation) and from April 2012 to December 2014 (<b>postimplementation),</b> 79 patients were treated for MRSA infection with VCM, and trough concentrations were monitored (pre, n= 28; post, n= 51). In 65 patients (pre, n= 15; post, n= 50), 24 -hour area under the ­concentration–time curve (AUC 0 – 24 h) /minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) ratios were calculated. Results: Pharmacist feedback, which included recommendations for changing dose or using alternative anti-MRSA antibiotics, was highly accepted during <b>postimplementation</b> (88 %, 29 / 33). The number of patients with serum VCM concentrations within the therapeutic range (10 – 20 μg/mL) was significantly higher during <b>postimplementation</b> (84 %, 43 / 51) than during preimplementation (39 %, 11 / 28) (P 400) was significantly higher during <b>postimplementation</b> (84 %, 42 / 50) than during preimplementation (53 %, 8 / 15; P= 0. 013). There {{were no significant differences in}} nephrotoxicity or mortality rate. Conclusion: Our ASP increased the percentage of patients that attained optimal VCM trough concentrations and PK/PD parameters, which contributed to the appropriate use of VCM in patients with MRSA infections.

40|$|Background: The Quality in Acute Stroke Care (QASC) trial {{evaluated}} systematic {{implementation of}} clinical treatment protocols to manage fever, sugar, and swallow (FeSS protocols) in acute stroke care. This cluster-randomised controlled trial {{was conducted in}} 19 stroke units in Australia. Aim: To describe perceived barriers and enablers preimplementation {{to the introduction of}} the FeSS protocols and, <b>postimplementation,</b> to determine which of these barriers eventuated as actual barriers. Methods: Preimplementation: Workshops were held at the intervention stroke units (n = 10). The first workshop involved senior clinicians who identified perceived barriers and enablers to implementation of the protocols, the second workshop involved bedside clinicians. <b>Postimplementation,</b> an online survey with stroke champions from intervention sites was conducted. Results: A total of 111 clinicians attended the preimplementation workshops, identifying 22 barriers covering four main themes: (a) need for new policies, (b) limited workforce (capacity), (c) lack of equipment, and (d) education and logistics of training staff. Preimplementation enablers identified were: support by clinical champions, medical staff, nursing management and allied health staff; easy adaptation of current protocols, care-plans, and local policies; and presence of specialist stroke unit staff. <b>Postimplementation,</b> only five of the 22 barriers identified preimplementation were reported as actual barriers to adoption of the FeSS protocols, namely, no previous use of insulin infusions; hyperglycaemic protocols could not be commenced without written orders; medical staff reluctance to use the ASSIST swallowing screening tool; poor level of engagement of medical staff; and doctors' unawareness of the trial. Linking Evidence to Action: The process of identifying barriers and enablers preimplementation allowed staff to take ownership and to address barriers and plan for change. As only five of the 22 barriers identified preimplementation were reported to be actual barriers at completion of the trial, this suggests that barriers are often overcome whilst some are only ever perceived rather than actual barriers...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we examine}} the on-the-ground realities of upstream-downstream {{negotiations}} and transactions over ecosystem services. We explore the engagement, negotiation, implementation, and <b>postimplementation</b> phases of a "reciprocal water access" (RWA) agreement between village communities and municipal water users at Palampur, Himachal Pradesh, India. We aim to highlight how external actors drove the payments for ecosystem services agenda {{through a series of}} facilitation and research engagements, which were pivotal to the RWA's adoption, and how the agreement fared once external agents withdrew. In the <b>postimplementation</b> period, the RWA agreement continues to be upheld by upstream communities amidst evolving, competing land-use changes and claims. The introduction of cash payments for environmental services for forest-water relationships has given rise to multifaceted difficulties for the upstream hamlets, which has impeded the functionality of their forest management committee. Upstream communities' formal rights and abilities to control and manage their resources are dynamic and need strengthening and assurance; these developments result in fluctuating transaction and opportunity costs not originally envisaged by the RWA agreement.

Fischler College of Education. ERIC Descriptors: Professional Development, Response to Intervention, Attendance, Achievement, Teacher Perception The primary {{purposes}} {{of the study were}} to develop a response to intervention (RTI) professional development plan and to determine if implementation of the professional development plan changed educators’ perceptions on RTI from preimplementation to <b>postimplementation.</b> Since the inception of (RTI) in 2008 in the researcher’s school district, substantive, consistent, professional development initiatives for certified staff were minimally provided. The participants in the quantitative part of the study were a convenience sample of 50 educators at 1 high school in Georgia. These educators were certified regular education teachers who were content-area teachers, certified special education teachers who were content-area teachers, and department heads. The participants in the qualitative part of the study were a purposive sample of 5 department heads at the high school. Data were collected for all participants with the Revised Survey of Teacher Perception of the RTI Process to respond to 5 research questions. The intervention was the RTI professional development. The treatment period for the intervention was 10 weeks or 10 hours of training. There were 10 professional development training sessions based on a formalized and widely used RTI training curriculum by Windram, Bollman, and Johnson (2012). The study used a convergent parallel mixed-methods approach. Quantitative data (preimplementation and <b>postimplementation)</b> were collected from 50 educators. Qualitative data (<b>postimplementation</b> only) were collected from 5 department heads. Pre- and <b>postimplementation</b> means, standard deviations, and effect sizes were calculated for each of the quantitative research questions. The inferential statistical model was the one-tailed t test for paired samples. Data analysis for the qualitative Research Question 4 followed {{a modified version of the}} constant comparative qualitative data-analysis procedures. Findings for Question 1 showed the RTI professional development positively changed (1. 64) educators’ perceptions of RTI related to students’ attendance and achievement, while for Research Question 2 the RTI professional development positively changed (1. 94) educators’ perceptions related to the documentation of RTI procedures. Findings for Research Question 3 showed RTI professional development positively changed (3. 00) educators’ perceptions of RTI related to involvement and support for RTI. Results for Research Question 4 revealed the department heads had different recommendations to improve the effectiveness of the RTI process and had mixed feelings on RTI’s effectiveness to improve the achievement of students.

We evaluate the effect of an intervention to reduce unnecessary placement of urinary catheters in the ED. MethodsEighteen EDs from 1 health system underwent the intervention and established institutional guidelines for urinary catheter placement, provided education, and identified physician and nurse champions to lead the work. The project included baseline (7 days), implementation (14 days), and <b>postimplementation</b> (6 months, data sampled 1 day per month). Changes in urinary catheter use, indications for use, and presence of physician order were evaluated, comparing the 3 periods. ResultsSampled patients (13, 215) admitted through the ED were evaluated, with 891 (6. 7 %; 95 % confidence interval [CI] 6. 3 % to 7. 2 %) having a catheter placed. Newly placed catheters decreased from 309 of 3, 381 (9. 1 %) baseline compared with 424 of 6, 896 (6. 1 %) implementation (Δ 3. 0 %; 95 % CI 1. 9 % to 4. 1 %), and 158 of 2, 938 (5. 4 %) <b>postimplementation</b> periods (Δ 3. 8 %; 95 % CI 2. 5 % to 5. 0 %). The appropriateness of newly placed urinary catheters improved from baseline (228 / 308; 74 %) compared with implementation (385 / 421; 91. 4 %; Δ 17. 4 %; 95 % CI 11. 9 % to 23. 1 %) and <b>postimplementation</b> periods (145 / 158; 91. 8 %; Δ 23. 9 %; 95 % CI 18 % to 29. 3 %).

40|$|Trauma {{patients}} experience {{pain and}} agitation during their hospitalization. Many complications {{have been noted}} both {{in the absence of}} symptom management and the in presence of oversedation/narcotization. To combat noted untoward effects of pain and sedation management, an interprofessional team convened to develop a pain and sedation guideline for use in a trauma intensive care unit. Guideline development began with a comprehensive review of the literature. With the input of unit stakeholders, a nurse-driven analgosedation guideline was implemented for a 6 -month trial. During this time, unit champions were integral to successful trial execution. Outcome measurement included patient and unit outcomes, nursing satisfaction, and a pre- and <b>postimplementation</b> patient comparison.

40|$|Objective: The aim was {{to assess}} a {{standardized}} order set for perioperative pain management in highly opioid-tolerant patients undergoing elective orthopedic surgery. Methods: This retrospective chart review evaluated a pain order set in highly opioid-tolerant patients undergoing elective total knee or total hip arthroplasty from January 2010 through August 2012. Based on {{the date of the}} surgery, patients were allocated into preimplementation or <b>postimplementation</b> order set groups. The primary outcome assessed whether an adjustment in daily opioid dosage was required within the first 48 hours postoperatively. Secondary outcomes included pain scores, length of hospitalization, and safety outcomes. Results: Sixty patients were included in the analysis. An adjustment to postoperative opioid therapy occurred in 62 % of the patients in the preimplementation group and in 56 % of <b>postimplementation</b> group patients (P = 0. 786). There were no differences in median pain scores 48 hours postoperatively (P = 0. 348). Cumulative toxicity was increased after order set implementation compared with previous patients (44 % versus 5 %, P < 0. 005); however, opioid doses held for sedation was the only individual toxicity to reach statistical significance (P = 0. 011). Conclusions: This study is the first to evaluate a standardized order set for pain management in highly opioid-tolerant patients undergoing elective orthopedic surgery. The order set demonstrated similar efficacy to previous treatment modalities, but opioid-induced sedation was of concern with the order set. After the initial analysis, the order set was modified to minimize opioid-induced sedation.

This project evaluated a quality improvement (QI) initiative implemented to reduce cesarean births among Nulliparous Term Singleton Vertex (NTSV) obstetric populations, the largest contributor to cesarean births. Variations in labor management practice contribute to cesarean birth rate; implementation of labor management bundles have been endorsed to influence practice- and system-level changes in the promotion of vaginal births. The problem addressed in this project was an organizational NTSV cesarean section rate of 30 %. The purpose {{of the project was}} to use secondary data to evaluate a previously implemented labor management bundle at a large hospital in the northwestern United States. The model of improvement was used as a framework for the QI initiative and this evaluation project. The practice-focused question asked in this project was: Did NTSV cesarean birth rates change after implementation of an evidenced-based standardized labor management bundle? Archived data were collected on cesarean birth rates for 3 time periods: prebaseline, 1 year <b>postimplementation,</b> and 2 years <b>postimplementation.</b> Chi-squareï? tests compared the differences between observed and expected results of data following implementation of labor management bundles.

40|$|Background: Epic Beaker Clinical Pathology (CP) is a {{relatively}} new laboratory information system (LIS) operating within the Epic suite of software applications. To date, there have not been any publications describing implementation of Beaker CP. In this report, we describe our experience in implementing Beaker CP version 2012 at a state academic medical center with a go-live of August 2014 and a subsequent upgrade to Beaker version 2014 in May 2015. The implementation of Beaker CP was concurrent with implementations of Epic modules for revenue cycle, patient scheduling, and patient registration. Methods: Our analysis covers approximately 3 years of time (2 years preimplementation of Beaker CP and roughly 1 year after) using data summarized from pre- and post-implementation meetings, debriefings, and the closure document for the project. Results: We summarize positive aspects of, and key factors leading to, a successful implementation of Beaker CP. The early inclusion of subject matter experts in the design and validation of Beaker workflows was very helpful. Since Beaker CP does not directly interface with laboratory instrumentation, the clinical laboratories spent extensive preimplementation effort establishing middleware interfaces. Immediate challenges <b>postimplementation</b> included bar code scanning and nursing adaptation to Beaker CP specimen collection. The most substantial changes in laboratory workflow occurred with microbiology orders. This posed a considerable challenge with microbiology orders from the operating rooms and required intensive interventions in the weeks following go-live.

Method usedA retrospective observational longitudinal quarterly analysis of adherence to low tidal volume LPV (< 7. 5 mL/kg predicted body weight; Pao 2 /fraction of inspired oxygen < 300), ventilator duration, and ICU mortality ratios (Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation IV–adjusted). The teleICU practice used Philips (Andover, MA) VISICU eCareManagerTM (Andover, MA) platform, providing ICU care and process improvement. ResultsBefore ventilator rounds implementation, there was wide variation in hospital adherence to low tidal volume (29. 5 ± 18. 2; range 10 %- 69 %). Longitudinal improvement was seen across hospitals in the 3 Qs after implementation, reaching statistical significance by Q 3 <b>postimplementation</b> (44. 9 ± 15. 7; P <. 002 by 2 -tailed Fisher exact test), maintained at 2 subsequent Qs (48 % and 52 %; P <. 001). Ventilator duration ratio also showed preimplementation variability (1. 08 ±. 34; range 0. 71 - 1. 90). After implementation, absolute and significant mean VDR reduction was observed (0. 92 ±. 28; − 15. 8 %, P <. 05). Intensive care unit mortality ratio demonstrated longitudinal improvement, reaching significance after the Q 3 <b>postimplementation</b> (0. 94 vs 0. 67; P <. 04), and this was sustained in the most recent Q analyzed (0. 65; P <. 03). ConclusionsImplementation of teleICU-directed ventilator rounds was associated with improved and durable adherence to LPV and significant reductions in both VDR and ICU mortality...|$|E
40|$|Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and System (HCAHPS) {{survey results}} from 2013 {{revealed}} {{a need for}} improvement in nurse-patient communication at the unit level. In response, nursing administrators at an acute-care hospital asked bedside nurses to develop a protocol for bedside shift report according to best practices. The protocol was implemented in May 2014. Three months later, a <b>postimplementation</b> survey was distributed. Work from Lewin and Kotter theoretical concepts were used to evaluate this organizational change. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine whether re-educating staff nurses on the bedside shift report protocol increased compliance with evidence-based practice performance standards for bedside shift reporting. In the initial phase of this project, a review of a 3 -month <b>postimplementation</b> survey revealed consensus that bedside shift report had not been universally accepted and implemented. Based on these findings, a re-education program was developed and implemented. A 2 -week post re-education survey elicited 89 respondentsâ?? perspectives on bedside shift report. Analysis of the survey results revealed that nurses had strong perceptions of this significant change to their practice. The re-education revealed that nurses could show commitment to performing daily bedside shift report if specific conditions are supported, such as nurses understanding that the process improves satisfaction levels, and if nursesâ?? misconceptions are addressed. Social change of this magnitude indicated that the voices of bedside nurses must be heard. To make this goal a reality ongoing evaluation is required to promote patient safety, improve patient outcomes, and improve HCAHPS results related to nurse-patient communication. Positive social change results in this project impacting patients by providing a better quality of care in this facility...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Electronic {{prescribing}} (ePrescribing) {{systems are}} rapidly being introduced into National Health Systems (NHS) hospitals in England following their widespread earlier adoption into primary care settings. Such systems require substantial {{changes in the}} way pharmacists organise their work and perform their roles. There is however as yet limited evidence {{on the extent to which}} these changes may support or compromise efficient and safe working practices by pharmacists. Identifying and quantifying these changes, and their effects, is central to informing system and work practice design, as well as informing training and implementation processes. This protocol describes a study to measure the impact of ePrescribing systems on pharmacists' time and workflow. Methods and analysis: A direct observational controlled pre-post implementation time-and-motion study will be conducted in six wards at one NHS Trust over two observational periods. Pharmacists will be shadowed and details of all work tasks performed will be collected and time-stamped. Task distribution, frequency and duration will be measured and changes in these measures preimplementation and <b>postimplementation,</b> and between control and intervention wards will be measured. Interviews with pharmacists will investigate their perceptions of the impact of the ePrescribing systems on their work and will be conducted in both periods. The extent to which pharmacists' expectations of the impact of the ePrescribing systems on their work with <b>postimplementation</b> reports will be qualitatively explored, as will any differences between perceptions and results from the time-and-motion analysis. Ethics and dissemination: Institutional research ethics approval has been obtained from The University of Edinburgh. Local approval from the participating NHS Trust and informed consent from participating pharmacists have been obtained, while also complying with local governance requirements. The results of the study will be presented at conferences, published in peer-reviewed journals, and shared with members of our Patient and Public Involvement Group, to facilitate wider dissemination. 5 page(s...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: There is {{a growing}} {{interest}} in teledermatology in today's clinical practice, but the maturity of the evaluation research of this technology is still unclear. OBJECTIVES: This systematic review describes the maturity of teledermatology evaluation research over time and explores what kind of teledermatology outcome measures have been evaluated. METHODS: Systematic review of literature found in Medline database (1966 up to April 2006). A telemedicine evaluation strategy consisting of four consecutive research phases (parallel to drug and diagnostics evaluation research) extended with a fifth <b>postimplementation</b> phase was used to classify all included studies by two independent reviewers. In addition, main characteristics (store-and-forward or real-time, study design, outcome measures) were registered. RESULTS: Three hundred and forty-five papers were systematically selected from Medline, and 244 papers were excluded. For two randomized controlled trials (RCTs), multiple papers in phase III were found. After correcting for this, 99 studies remained included (11 phase I, 72 phase II, two phase III, six phase IV, eight <b>postimplementation</b> phase). The number of phase II studies is the largest and still growing, while other phases are much less represented. Diagnostic accuracy was the most often used outcome measure and was found in phase I, II and IV. Store-and-forward teledermatology has been evaluated more since 2001, but most phase IV studies (RCTs, including cost aspects) are on real-time teledermatology. CONCLUSIONS: Most teledermatology evaluation studies are classified as feasibility studies (phase II). The number of phase III and IV studies remains low through the years. Compared with other specialties in telemedicine (i. e. telesurgery, telepaediatrics), teledermatology {{seems to be a}} mature application. However, more evaluation studies with a focus on clinical outcomes such as preventable referrals or time to recovery are needed to prove that teledermatology indeed is a promising and cost-saving technolog...|$|E
40|$|Analyses of {{national}} and state-based {{data suggest that the}} rate of reported sexual offenses has declined in the past 25 years. This decline began prior to the implementation of registration and notification laws in the mid- 1990 s and continued to decline after the laws ’ passage. It remains unclear, however, whether registration and notification laws have produced a qualitative change in the characteristics of the offender population and/or the predictors of sexual recidivism. This study investigates key differences among offenders pre- and <b>postimplementation</b> of community notification laws across an 11 -year period (1990 - 2000) using a random sample of 550 offenders in New Jersey.

40|$|Malaria due to P. falciparum is {{the number}} one cause of {{morbidity}} and mortality in Uganda where it is highly endemic in 95 % of the country. The use of efficacious and effective antimalarial medicines {{is one of the key}} strategies for malaria control. Until 2000, Chloroquine (CQ) was the first-line drug for treatment of uncomplicated malaria in Uganda. Due to progressive resistance to CQ and to a combination of CQ with Sulfadoxine-Pyrimethamine, Uganda in 2004 adopted the use of ACTs as first-line drug for treating uncomplicated malaria. A review of the drug policy change process and <b>postimplementation</b> reports highlight the importance of managing the policy change process, generating evidence for policy decisions and availability of adequate and predictable funding for effective policy roll-out.
