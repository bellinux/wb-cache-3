500|$|His ideas {{helped the}} {{spread the word}} of secular pan-Arabism against {{religious}} nationalists and those who believed in separate Syrian, Lebanese, and Palestinian destinies. In the mid-1950s, Darwaza asserted that {{the first stage of}} Arab union should be based on a merger between Egypt and Syria. In his opinion, a union between the northern Arabs (Syria) and the southern Arabs (Egypt) would facilitate the adherence of other Arab states. He believed that Egypt's capabilities and human resources compelled it to fill the role of an Arab [...] "Prussia". Darwaza remarked on Gamal Abdel Nasser, Egyptian <b>president</b> <b>and</b> <b>founder</b> of the short-lived union, saying [...] "Since the Arab revolt against the Turks, no Arab leader has been up to the level of events except for Jamal 'Abd al-Nasir.

500|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, the Hammond Organ Company hired American {{musician}} and engineer Don Lewis {{to demonstrate its}} products, including an electronic organ with a built-in drum machine designed by the Japanese company Ace Tone. At the time, drum machines were most often used to accompany home organs; users could not program their own rhythms and had to use preset patterns such as bossa nova. Lewis was known for performances using electronic instruments he had modified himself, decades before the popularization of instrument [...] "hacking" [...] via circuit bending. He made extensive modifications to the Ace Tone drum machine, creating his own rhythms and wiring the device through his organ's expression pedal to accent the percussion.Lewis was approached by Ace Tone <b>president</b> <b>and</b> <b>founder</b> Ikutaro Kakehashi, who {{wanted to know how}} he had achieved the sounds from the machine Kakehashi had designed. In 1972, Kakehashi formed the Roland Corporation, and hired Lewis to help design drum machines. By the late 1970s, microprocessors were appearing in instruments such as the Roland MC-8 Microcomposer sequencer, and Kakehashi realized they could be used to program drum machine rhythms. In 1978, Roland released the CompuRhythm CR-78, the first drum machine with which users could write, save, and replay their own patterns.|$|E
