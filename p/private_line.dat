25|$|Dorothy was {{to pick up}} {{her sister}} Louise after seeing Snider and never showed, which was very unlike her. Around 11 pm, Snider's private {{investigator}} called Cushner on his <b>private</b> <b>line,</b> saying that he had been trying to call Snider for several hours, but Snider was not answering. Although there were many guests in the residence, Snider's bedroom door was closed and they assumed Snider's privacy was essential. Cushner broke into Snider's room and discovered the nude bodies of Snider and Stratten, both having been shot with a Mossberg 12-gauge shotgun, which Snider had recently acquired. Police determined that Snider murdered Stratten, who was 20, then abused and raped her corpse, before turning the shotgun on himself. Dorothy's body was found connected to an odd, homemade sexual contraption and both bodies were covered with ants.|$|E
25|$|The Silverton Tramway was {{conceived}} {{as a way to}} transport silver ore from the newly discovered ore deposits at Silverton, to the smelters at Port Pirie, with the line later extended to Broken Hill with the discovery of that field. The need for a <b>private</b> <b>line</b> was in part due to the New South Wales Government refusing to allow the South Australian Railways to extend its line from Port Pirie across the border. The Silverton Tramway Act of 1886 was passed by the New South Wales Government, permitting the narrow gauge line to be built by the STC. The Act also permitted the New South Wales Government to buy out the company and assets after 21 years, provided a payment of 21 times the average of the previous seven years, and that the company could be obliged to alter the track gauge at any time at its own expense. The line was built in twelve months at a cost of £125,000. The contract to build the line was awarded to C Millar, who was building the Peterborough to Cockburn line at the same time. The first train reached Broken Hill on 6 September 1887, with the line officially opened on 12 January 1888 by the Duke of Manchester.|$|E

500|$|Both McWhorter and scholar Hilton Als found Angelou's writing {{throughout}} her series self-important. [...] Although McWhorter has admitted to being charmed by Angelou's sense of authority she has inserted into her works, {{which he calls}} her [...] "black-mother wit", he considered Angelou's autobiographies after Caged Bird [...] "smug", and has stated that she [...] "implicitly dares the reader to question her <b>private</b> <b>line</b> to God and Truth". [...] Als agreed, stating what made Song different from her preceding volumes is her [...] "ever-increasing unreliability". [...] Als stated that Angelou, in her six autobiographies, [...] "has given us... the self-aggrandizing, homespun, and sometimes oddly prudish story of a black woman who, {{when faced with the}} trials of life, simply makes do". Als believed that Angelou's essays, written in the 1990s, were a better culmination of her work as an autobiographer.|$|E
500|$|The Lillesand–Flaksvand Line (...) or LFB was a [...] railway between Flaksvand (now called Flaksvatn) and Lillesand in Aust-Agder, Norway. The <b>private</b> <b>line</b> {{was built}} with [...] narrow gauge {{and was not}} {{connected}} to the national railway network. The line opened on 4 June 1896, and remained in use until 15 June 1953. It was built to carry lumber, but also featured a passenger service and other cargo transport. After 1908, the line was unprofitable and only had a limited service. Plans to connect it to the Sørland Line were proposed but rejected. The line had four stations and four halts, and was served with two [...] steam locomotives, Lillesand and Flaksvand. The line was {{owned and operated by}} the private company, A/S Lillesand–Flaksvandbanen, although nearly all the shares were held by local municipalities, the county and the national government.|$|E

[...] On 8 August 1893 it opened to Mokihinui, and on 23 February 1895 the New Zealand Railways Department acquired a 6.2 kilometre (3.8 mile) <b>private</b> <b>line</b> from Mokihinui through Seddonville to the Mokihinui Mine, run by the Mokihinui Coal Company.

2500|$|The {{battle over}} Hetch Hetchy Valley {{continues}} today {{between those who}} wish to retain the dam and reservoir, and {{those who wish to}} drain the reservoir and return Hetch Hetchy Valley to its former state. Those in favor of dam removal have pointed out that many actions by San Francisco since 1913 have been in violation of the Raker Act, which explicitly stated that power and water from Hetch Hetchy could not be sold to private interests. Hydroelectricity generated from the Hetch Hetchy project is largely sold to Bay Area customers through a private power company, Pacific Gas & Electric (PG). San Francisco was able to accomplish this in 1925 by claiming it had run out of funds to extend the Hetch Hetchy transmission line {{all the way to the}} city. The terminus of the incomplete line was [...] "conveniently located next to a PG substation", which connected to PG's <b>private</b> <b>line</b> which in turn bridged the gap to San Francisco. The city justified this as a temporary measure, but no attempt to follow through with completing the municipal grid was ever made. Peter Byrne of SF Weekly has stated that [...] "the plain language of the Raker Act itself and experts who are familiar with the act (and have no stake in city politics) all agree: The city of San Francisco is not in violation of the Raker Act." [...] Harold L. Ickes, Secretary of the Interior in the late 1930s, said there was a violation of the Raker Act, but he and the city reached an agreement in 1945.|$|E

40|$|Current power {{distribution}} network design makes it attractive for agents to generate {{their own power}} (distributed generation) and to construct private infrastructure (e. g., distribution lines) to exchange power without using the main public grid. We show that such private transactions may increase overall network load because of increased transmission distances, thus increasing resistive losses. We present a coordination scheme for the centralized control of private infrastructure that satisfies participation constraints and budget balance. Experiments show that our scheme reduces distribution losses by 4 - 5 % when {{there are only a}} constant number of <b>private</b> <b>lines</b> and by 55 %- 60 % when the number of <b>private</b> <b>lines</b> is proportional to the number of agents...|$|R
