A two-dimensional boundary-element mine stress model was developed to predict the locations and extent of damaged rock mass zones surrounding draw drifts where adjacent, parallel trench drifts are either elevated or not elevated above the LHD <b>production</b> <b>draw</b> drift level. A Mohr-Coulomb shear-failure criterion was obtained directly from in situ borehole shear test data. Hock-Brown shear-failure parameter values were computed from borehole-shear and triaxial test data. A procedure is described to estimate these parameters when a rock mass rating (RMR) value and triaxial data on intact samples exist, and no borehole shear test data exist Results indicate that trench drifts, elevated to the level equal to {{the height of the}} LHD <b>production</b> <b>draw</b> drift, would not minimize material damage nor significantly enhance the stability of rib and crown pillar zones surrounding <b>production</b> <b>draw</b> drifts in the mechanized LHD trench undercut caving panel investigated at this mine...|$|R

50|$|Micropolitan cities do {{not have}} the {{economic}} or political importance of large cities, but are nevertheless significant centers of population and <b>production,</b> <b>drawing</b> workers and shoppers from a wide local area. Because the designation is based on the core urban cluster's population and not on that of the whole area, some micropolitan areas are actually larger than some metropolitan areas. For example, the Ottawa-Peru, IL Micropolitan Statistical Area had a 2010 census population of 154,908. That would put its total population ahead of roughly 100 individual locations classified as a Metropolitan Statistical Area in 2010.

5000|$|Orko is a [...] "Trollan", {{a race of}} beings from Trolla, a {{world in}} another dimension. Trollans wear red robes, red hats, and hide their faces beneath hats and behind scarves. In Trollan society, showing one's face to each other is {{considered}} an intimate act, similar to humans sharing a kiss. A <b>production</b> <b>drawing</b> of Orko without his hat, showed him resembling little blue elf, {{but it was never}} used in the series. Orko does reveal his face in the episode [...] "Dawn of Dragoon", but his face is not visible to the audience, though his shadow indicates he is bald. Trollans appear to be blue-skinned humanoids with pointy ears. However, their feet remain hidden under their robes. Trollans have natural magical abilities, including levitation, which they use exclusively instead of walking. In one episode, Orko temporarily loses the power of levitation, and can be seen crawling around on his knees. Still, some Trollans have greater magical power than others; Orko's uncle, for example, is a noted magician. Orko is one of three people that know He-Man's true identity; five, if you count She-Ra (Adora) and Queen Marlena as is hinted at in [...] "The Rainbow Warrior".|$|E
