Cookery as it Should be: new manual of the dining room and kitchen, for persons in moderate circumstances was written by a former student, who [...] "experimented" [...] with the more modern recipes. The same book was published almost a decade later and retitled Mrs. Goodfellow’s Cookery as it Should be. It was claimed to be written by Mrs. Goodfellow, which it obviously was not. Other cookbooks contained recipes identified with her name. However, it was Eliza Leslie’s first cookbook, and to a lesser degree her other books, which allowed Mrs. Goodfellow’s teaching to influence generations of cooks. Mrs. Goodfellow stressed quality ingredients, thus her baked goods [...] "were always excellently made, nothing being spared that was good."

A number of performance visualisation tools have evolved to meet this need for particular systems but they are often not portable to other machines. We regard portability as crucial to the widespread acceptance and use of such tools, and have investigated several approaches to achieving it. Each approach has been based on the public domain ParaGraph tool, which enables trace data collected during a program's execution to be viewed from various different visual perspectives. One approach is for programs to use the portable instrumented communication library PICL, which directly generates trace data in the appropriate format. Alternatively, trace files produced by applications using other libraries can be converted into <b>ParaGraph</b> <b>format</b> using trace filter programs. In this [...] ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Paragraphs are the {{building}} blocks of essays. A sound knowledge of paragraph structuring leads to well-written and readable essays. On the contrary, a lack of paragraph writing skills culminates into a farrago of ideas scattered haphazardly in the essay, thereby affecting paragraph unity and coherence, which in turn impacts negatively on the packaging of ideas in the essay. This study has been prompted by my observation over the years of paragraph construction difficulties polytechnic students face in their academic writing, and also the paucity of research in polytechnic writing. As a result, this paper set to investigate how students structure their paragraphs in terms of topic sentence use and support sentences. A corpus of 120 essays was collected from four departments in Kumasi Polytechnic, Kumasi, Ghana and using Bain’s paragraph principles as a benchmark to analyse them, the results revealed that 66 % of the essays employed definite <b>paragraph</b> <b>format.</b> The study also found numerous one-sentence paragraphs leading to the creation of indentations, with reckless abandon.

This thesis set out to advance the idea that taxonomy of relevant optimum conditions for identity development can serve to illuminate thinking and research on the impact of the classroom environment on identity development in adolescence. A systems approach was used. The subjects were Grade 11 pupils of a high school in Gauteng. They completed questionnaires in <b>paragraph</b> <b>format,</b> and case studies were conducted with five students. Questions relating to their classroom environments were asked. The unit of study was primarily the classroom, but since the classroom is part of the larger school system, aspects of the school environment were explored as well. Positive and negative elements in the classroom environment, that enhance or hamper identity development, were identified. Recommendations were made to improve the classroom environment in order to create an environment that is conducive to identity development, and ultimately, academic achievement. PsychologyD.

40|$|In this paper, we {{deal with}} the problem of {{document}} image rectification from image captured by digital cameras. The improvement on the resolution of digital camera sensors has brought more and more applications for non-contact text capture. Unfortunately, perspective distortion in the resulting image makes it hard to properly identify the contents of the captured text using traditional optical character recognition (OCR) systems. We propose in this work a new technique, which is capable of removing perspective distortion and recovering the fronto-parallel view of text with a single image. Different from reported approaches in the literature, the image rectification is carried out using character stroke boundaries and tip points (SBTP), which are extracted from character strokes based on multiple fuzzy sets and morphological operators. The algorithm needs neither high-contrast document boundary (HDB) nor <b>paragraph</b> <b>formatting</b> (PF) information. Experimental results show that our rectification process is fast and robust. q 2005 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

He issued a further version of the New Testament in 1752, in which differed in about 2,000 readings from the 1750 edition, and which remained the base text for further editions of the bible in Challoner's lifetime. In all three editions the extensive notes and commentary of the 1582/1610 original were drastically reduced, resulting in a compact one-volume edition of the Bible, which contributed greatly to its popularity. Gone also was the longer <b>paragraph</b> <b>formatting</b> of the text; instead, the text was broken up so that each verse was its own paragraph. The three apocrypha, which {{had been placed in}} an appendix to the second volume of the Old Testament, were dropped.

40|$|Students {{typically}} create concept maps {{while they}} view the material {{they are trying to}} learn. In these circumstances, concept mapping serves as an elaborative study activity—students are not required to retrieve the material they are learning. In 2 experiments, we examined the effectiveness of concept mapping when it is used as a retrieval practice activity. In Experiment 1, students read educational texts and practiced retrieval either by writing down as many ideas as they could recall in <b>paragraph</b> <b>format</b> or by creating a concept map (retrieval-based concept mapping). In Experiment 2, we factorially crossed the format of the activity (paragraph vs. concept map) and {{the presence or absence of}} the text (i. e., whether the activity involved repeated studying or retrieval practice). On a final test 1 week later that assessed verbatim knowledge and inferencing, both paragraph and concept map retrieval practice formats produced better performance than additional studying, but the 2 retrieval formats themselves did not differ. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of concept mapping when it is used as a retrieval practice activity and show that retrieval itself, rather than merely the act of writing, drives the benefits of retrieval-based learning activities...|$|E

40|$|This {{study is}} aimed at finding out the {{attitude}} of the English Department students' toward the learning of writing using Ms. Word in the multimedia laboratory at Widya Mandala Surabaya Catholic University (henceforth it is abbreviated to WMSCU), and the reasons of their attitude. This study is based on the theory of attitude, which comprises of three components-affective, behavioral, and cognitive components. A descriptive qualitative survey was applied as the research design of this study. Questionnaire, in-depth interview, and the researcher were the instruments of this study. Sixty-one students at the English Department of WMSCU, who took writing classes using Ms. Word in the multimedia laboratory, were chosen as the subjects using convenience sampling. In analyzing the data, options "strongly Agree" and "Agree" were considered as positive response, while options "Disagree" and "Strongly Disagree" were considered as negative response. The analysis of questionnaire discovered that the subjects held positive attitude to ward learning writing using Ms. Word in the multimedia laboratory at WMSCU. Ms. Word benefited their writing with its features {{was one of the reasons}} of having positive attitude.

Meanwhile, page <b>formatting,</b> <b>paragraph</b> <b>formatting,</b> and editing text facilitated the arrangement of paragraph and paragraph neatness. Word count benefited the students when they had to write composition that contained certain number of words. Track changes and insert and view comments improved the student's writing with the comments from the lecturer. Another reason was the writing class using Ms. Word was enjoyable since the students had their own PCs (they could write according to their time and pace) and the lecturer used different delivery techniques. Since the students held positive attitude toward that writing class using Ms. Word, they claimed that they had positive behavior, such as: coming to the class on time, submitting the writing assignments on time, trying not to be absent, and looking for information about writing class during their absence...|$|R
