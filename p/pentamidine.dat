5|$|A {{pioneer of}} {{community-based}} {{research in the}} absence of effective government efforts, Sonnabend also helped to establish the nonprofit Community Research Initiative (CRI, later renamed CRIA, then ACRIA) in New York in 1987. One of CRI's early achievements was a trial that contributed to the approval of inhaled <b>pentamidine</b> for preventing Pneumocystis pneumonia, a common AIDS-related infection. Sonnabend served as Medical Director of CRI/CRIA until 1996.|$|E
25|$|In immunocompromised patients, {{prophylaxis}} with co-trimoxazole (trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole), atovaquone, {{or regular}} <b>pentamidine</b> inhalations {{may help prevent}} PCP.|$|E
25|$|The current {{treatment}} for first-stage disease is intravenous or intramuscular <b>pentamidine</b> for T. b. gambiense or intravenous suramin for T. b. rhodesiense.|$|E
25|$|<b>Pentamidine</b> is {{less often}} used as its major {{limitation}} is the high frequency of side effects. These include acute pancreatic inflammation, kidney failure, liver toxicity, decreased white blood cell count, rash, fever, and low blood sugar.|$|E
25|$|<b>Pentamidine,</b> {{a highly}} {{effective}} drug {{for the first}} stage of the disease, has been used since 1937. During the 1950s, it was widely used as a prophylactic agent in western Africa, leading to a sharp decline in infection rates. At the time, eradication of the disease was thought to be at hand.|$|E
25|$|The {{evidence}} {{around the}} treatment of cutaneous leishmaniasis is poor. A number of topical treatments {{may be used for}} cutaneous leishmaniasis. Which treatments are effective depends on the strain, with topical paromomycin effective for L. major, L. tropica, L. mexicana, L. panamensis, and L. braziliensis. <b>Pentamidine</b> is effective for L. guyanensis. Oral fluconazole or itraconazole appears effective in L. major and L. tropica.|$|E
25|$|Identified by {{methenamine}} silver stain of lung tissue, type I pneumocytes, {{and type}} II pneumocytes over-replicate and damage alveolar epithelium, causing death by asphyxiation. Fluid leaks into alveoli, producing an exudate seen as honeycomb/cotton candy appearance on hematoxylin and eosin-stained slides. Drug {{of choice is}} Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, <b>pentamidine,</b> or dapsone. In HIV patients, most cases occur when the CD4 count is below 200 cells per microliter.|$|E
25|$|Antipneumocystic {{medication}} is used with concomitant steroids {{in order to}} avoid inflammation, which causes an exacerbation of symptoms about four days after treatment begins if steroids are not used. By far the most commonly used {{medication is}} trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, but some patients are unable to tolerate this treatment due to allergies. Other medications that are used, alone or in combination, include <b>pentamidine,</b> trimetrexate, dapsone, atovaquone, primaquine, pafuramidine maleate (under investigation), and clindamycin. Treatment is usually for a period of about 21 days.|$|E
25|$|Leishmaniasis can {{be partly}} {{prevented}} by sleeping under nets treated with insecticide. Other measures include spraying insecticides to kill sandflies and treating {{people with the}} disease early to prevent further spread. The treatment needed is determined by where the disease is acquired, the species of Leishmania, {{and the type of}} infection. Some possible medications used for visceral disease include liposomal amphotericin B, a combination of pentavalent antimonials and paromomycin, and miltefosine. For cutaneous disease, paromomycin, fluconazole, or <b>pentamidine</b> may be effective.|$|E
25|$|Prevention {{of severe}} disease {{involves}} screening {{the population at}} risk with blood tests for TbG. Treatment is easier when the disease is detected early and before neurological symptoms occur. Treatment of the first stage is with the medications <b>pentamidine</b> or suramin. Treatment of the second stage involves eflornithine {{or a combination of}} nifurtimox and eflornithine for TbG. While melarsoprol works for both stages, it is typically only used for TbR, due to serious side effects. Without treatment it typically results in death.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the start}} of the AIDS epidemic, PCP has been closely {{associated}} with AIDS. Because it only occurs in an immunocompromised host, it may be the first clue to a new AIDS diagnosis if the patient has no other reason to be immunocompromised (e.g. taking immunosuppressive drugs for organ transplant). An unusual {{rise in the number of}} PCP cases in North America, noticed when physicians began requesting large quantities of the rarely used antibiotic <b>pentamidine,</b> was the first clue to the existence of AIDS in the early 1980s.|$|E
25|$|Some {{medications}} {{are commonly}} associated with pancreatitis, most commonly corticosteroids such as prednisolone, but also including the HIV medications didanosine and <b>pentamidine,</b> diuretics, the anticonvulsant valproic acid, the chemotherapeutic agents L-asparaginase and azathioprine, estrogen by way of increased blood triglycerides, and antihyperglycemic agents like metformin, vildagliptin, and sitagliptin. It may be noted here that the drugs used to treat conditions that are themselves associated with increased events of pancreatitis may also be incidentally linked to pancreatitis. Examples include statins in dyslipidemia and DPP-4 inhibitors in diabetes. According to the Food and Drug Administration's MedWatch Surveillance System and Published Reports Atypical, atypical antipsychotics such as clozapine, risperidone, and olanzapine can also cause pancreatitis.|$|E
25|$|A 1999 {{in vitro}} study from Pakistan found 40% of {{isolates}} {{are resistant to}} common antiprotozoal drugs. A study of isolates from patients diagnosed with IBS found 40% of isolates resistant to metronidazole and 32% resistant to furazolidone. Drugs reported in studies {{to be effective in}} eradicating Blastocystis infection have included metronidazole, trimethoprim, TMP-SMX (only trimethoprim is active with sulphamethoxazole demonstrating no activity), tetracycline, doxycycline, nitazoxanide, <b>pentamidine,</b> paromomycin and iodoquinol. Iodoquinol {{has been found to be}} less effective in practice than in-vitro. Miconazole and quinacrine have been reported as effective agents against Blastocystis growth in-vitro. Rifaximin, and albendazole have shown promise as has ivermectin which demonstrated high effectiveness against blastocystis hominis isolates in an in vitro study. There is also evidence that the probiotic yeast Saccharomyces boulardii, and the plant mallotus oppositifolius may be effective against Blastocystis infections.|$|E
25|$|In January 1988, ACT UP Boston {{held its}} first protest at the Boston offices of the Department of Health and Human Services, {{regarding}} delays and red tape surrounding approval of AIDS treatment drugs. ACT UP/Boston's agenda included demands for a compassionate and comprehensive national policy on AIDS; a national emergency AIDS project; intensified drug testing, research, and treatment efforts; and a full-scale national educational program within reach of all. The organization held die-ins and sleep-ins, provided freshman orientation for Harvard Medical School students, negotiated successfully with a major pharmaceutical corporation, affected state and national AIDS polices, pressured health care insurers to provide coverage for people with AIDS, influenced the thinking {{of some of the}} nation's most influential researchers, served on the Massachusetts committee that created the nation's first online registry of clinical trials for AIDS treatments, distributed information and condoms to the congregation at Cardinal Bernard Francis Law Confirmation Sunday services at Cathedral of the Holy Cross, Boston, and made aerosolized <b>pentamidine</b> an accessible treatment in New England.|$|E

2500|$|Drugs: diuretics (e.g., thiazides, furosemide), gliptins (e.g., vildagliptin, sitagliptin, saxagliptin, linagliptin), tetracycline, sulfonamides, estrogens, {{azathioprine}} and mercaptopurine, <b>pentamidine,</b> salicylates, steroids, Depakote ...|$|E
2500|$|Antibiotics (i.e. aminoglycoside, amphotericin, <b>pentamidine,</b> gentamicin, tobramycin, viomycin) block {{resorption}} in {{the loop}} of Henle. 30% of patients using these antibiotics have hypomagnesemia.|$|E
2500|$|Comparative {{homology}} modelling of {{the enzyme}} Hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HGPRT; EC 2.4.2.8) [...] in L. donovani suggest that {{among all of}} the computationally screened compounds, <b>pentamidine,</b> 1,3-dinitroadamantane, acyclovir and analogs of acyclovir had higher binding affinities than the real substrate (guanosine monophosphate).|$|E
2500|$|TAAR1 {{peripheral}} and immune localization/functions: It {{is important}} to note that in addition to the brain, TAAR1 is also expressed in the spinal cord (Gozal et al., 2014) and periphery (Revel et al., 2012c). It has been shown that TAAR1 is expressed and regulates immune function in rhesus monkey leukocytes (Babusyte et al., 2013; Nelson et al., 2007; Panas et al., 2012). In granulocytes, TAAR1 is necessary for chemotaxic migration of cells towards TAAR1 agonists. In addition, TAAR1 signaling in B and T cells can trigger immunoglobulin and cytokine release, respectively (Babusyte et al., 2013). TAAR1 is also expressed in the islets of Langerhans, stomach and intestines based on LacZ staining patterns carried out on TAAR1-KO LacZ mice (Revel et al., 2012c). Interestingly, the administration of selective TAAR1 partial agonist RO5263397 reverses the side effect of weight gain observed with the antipsychotic olanzapine, indicating that peripheral TAAR1 signalling can regulate metabolic homeostasis (Revel et al., 2012b)....Monoamine transporters and SLC22A carrier subfamily transport TAAR1 ligand: Studies using the rhesus monkey TAAR1 have shown that this receptor interacts with the monoamine transporters DAT, SERT, and NET in HEK cells (Miller et al., 2005; Xie and Miller, 2007; Xie et al., 2007). It has been hypothesized that TAAR1 interaction with these transporters might provide a mechanism by which TAAR1 ligands can enter the cytoplasm and bind to TAAR1 in intracellular compartments. A recent study has shown that in rat neonatal motor neurons, trace-amine specific signalling requires the presence and function of the transmembrane solute carrier SLC22A but not that of monoamine transporters (DAT, SERT, and NET) (Gozal et al., 2014). Specifically, it was shown that addition of β-PEA, tyramine, or tryptamine induced locomotor like activity (LLA) firing patterns of these neurons in the presence of N-Methyl D-Aspartate. Temporally, it was found that the trace amine induction of LLA is delayed compared to serotonin and norepinephrine induced LLA, indicating the target site for the trace amines is not located on the plasma membrane and could perhaps be intracellular. Importantly, blocking of SLC22A with <b>pentamidine</b> abolished trace amine induced LLA, indicating that trace amine induced LLA does not act on receptors found on the plasma membrane but requires their transport to the cytosol by SLC22A for induction of LLA.}} ...|$|E
50|$|Metabolism: <b>Pentamidine</b> is {{primarily}} metabolized by Cytochrome P450 enzymes in the liver. Up to 12% of <b>pentamidine</b> is eliminated {{in the urine}} unchanged.|$|E
5000|$|Liver: Elevated liver enzymes are {{associated}} with intravenous use of <b>pentamidine.</b> Hepatomegaly and hepatitis have been encountered with long term prophylactic use of <b>pentamidine</b> inhalation.|$|E
50|$|Distribution: When injected, <b>pentamidine</b> binds to {{tissues and}} {{proteins}} in the plasma. It accumulates in the kidney, liver, lungs, pancreas, spleen, and adrenal glands. Additionally, <b>pentamidine</b> does not reach curative {{levels in the}} cerebrospinal fluid. It has a volume of distribution of 286-1356 liters when given intravenously and 1658-3790 liters when given intramuscularly. Inhaled <b>pentamidine</b> is mainly deposited into the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of the lungs.|$|E
50|$|Strains of the Trypanosoma brucei {{parasite}} {{that are}} resistant to <b>pentamidine</b> have been discovered. <b>Pentamidine</b> is brought into the mitochondria through carriers, {{and the absence of}} these carriers prevents the drug from reaching its site of action.|$|E
50|$|Elimination: <b>Pentamidine</b> has {{an average}} {{half-life}} of 5-8 hours when given intravenously and 7-11 hours when given intramuscularly. However, these may increase with severe kidney problems. <b>Pentamidine</b> can {{remain in the}} system {{for as long as}} 8 months after the first injection.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Pentamidine</b> {{can be used}} in the {{prevention}} of PCP in children with HIV who cannot tolerate Trimethoprim/Sulfamethoxazole and can use a nebulizer. Intranvenous solutions of <b>pentamidine</b> should only be used in children with HIV older than 2 years old when other treatments are unavailable ...|$|E
50|$|Absorption: <b>Pentamidine</b> is {{completely}} absorbed when given intravenously or intramuscularly. When inhaled through a nebulizer, <b>pentamidine</b> accumulates in the bronchoalveolar fluid {{of the lungs}} at a higher concentration compared to injections. The inhaled form is minimally absorbed in the blood. Absorption is unreliable when given orally.|$|E
50|$|<b>Pentamidine</b> {{was first}} used to treat African trypanosomiasis in 1937 and {{leishmaniasis}} in 1940 before it was registered as <b>pentamidine</b> mesylate in 1950. Its efficacy against Pneumocystis jirovecii was demonstrated in 1987, following its re-emergence on the drug market in 1984 in the current isethionate form.|$|E
50|$|<b>Pentamidine</b> isethionate for {{injection}} is {{commercially available}} as a lypophilized, white crystalline powder for reconstitution with sterile water or 5% Dextrose. After reconstitution, the mixture should be free from discoloration and precipitation. Reconstitution with sodium chloride should be avoided due to formation of precipitates. Intravenous solutions of <b>pentamidine</b> can be mixed with intravenous HIV medications like zidovidine and intravenous heart medications like diltiazem. However, intravenous solutions of antiviral foscarnet and antifungal fluconazole are incompatible with <b>pentamidine.</b> To avoid side-effects associated with intravenous administration, the solution should be slowly infused to minimize the release of histamine.|$|E
50|$|The {{mechanism}} {{seems to}} vary with different organisms {{and is not}} well understood. However, <b>pentamidine</b> is suspected to work through various methods of interference of critical functions in DNA, RNA, phospholipid and protein synthesis. <b>Pentamidine</b> binds to adenine-thymine-rich regions of the Trypanosoma parasite DNA, forming a cross-link between two adenines four to five base pairs apart. The drug also inhibits topoisomerase enzymes in the mitochondria of Pneumocystis jirovecii. Similarly, <b>pentamidine</b> inhibits type II topoisomerase in the mitochondria of the Trypanosoma parasite, resulting in breaks and unraveling it's circular mitochondrial DNA.|$|E
