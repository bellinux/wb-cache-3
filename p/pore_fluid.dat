25|$|The {{morphology}} of breccias {{associated with}} ore deposits varies from tabular sheeted veins and clastic dikes associated with overpressured sedimentary strata, to large-scale intrusive diatreme breccias (breccia pipes), or even some synsedimentary diatremes formed solely by the overpressure of <b>pore</b> <b>fluid</b> within sedimentary basins. Hydrothermal breccias are usually formed by hydrofracturing of rocks by highly pressured hydrothermal fluids. They {{are typical of}} the epithermal ore environment and are intimately associated with intrusive-related ore deposits such as skarns, greisens and porphyry-related mineralisation. Epithermal deposits are mined for copper, silver and gold.|$|E
25|$|The {{common clay}} {{minerals}} are montmorillonite or smectite, illite, and kaolinite or kaolin. These minerals tend {{to form in}} sheet or plate like structures, with length typically ranging between 10−7m and 4x10−6m and thickness typically ranging between 10−9m and 2x10−6m, {{and they have a}} relatively large specific surface area. The specific surface area (SSA) is defined as the ratio of the surface area of particles to the mass of the particles. Clay minerals typically have specific surface areas in the range of 10 to 1,000 square meters per gram of solid. Due to the large surface area available for chemical, electrostatic, and van der Waals interaction, the mechanical behavior of clay minerals is very sensitive to the amount of <b>pore</b> <b>fluid</b> available and the type and amount of dissolved ions in the <b>pore</b> <b>fluid.</b> To anticipate the effect of clay on the way a soil will behave, it is necessary to know the kinds of clays as well as the amount present. As home builders and highway engineers know all too well, soils containing certain high-activity clays make very unstable material on which to build because they swell when wet and shrink when dry. This shrink-and-swell action can easily crack foundations and cause retaining walls to collapse. These clays also become extremely sticky and difficult to work with when they are wet. In contrast, low-activity clays, formed under different conditions, can be very stable and easy to work with.|$|E
25|$|After deposition, {{physical}} processes can deform the sediment, producing a third class of secondary structures. Density contrasts between different sedimentary layers, such as between sand and clay, {{can result in}} flame structures or load casts, formed by inverted diapirism. While the clastic bed is still fluid, diapirism can cause a denser upper layer to sink into a lower layer. Sometimes, density contrasts can result or grow {{when one of the}} lithologies dehydrates. Clay can be easily compressed as a result of dehydration, while sand retains the same volume and becomes relatively less dense. On the other hand, when the <b>pore</b> <b>fluid</b> pressure in a sand layer surpasses a critical point, the sand can break through overlying clay layers and flow through, forming discordant bodies of sedimentary rock called sedimentary dykes. The same process can form mud volcanoes on the surface where they broke through upper layers.|$|E

Atterberg limits and vane shear tests were performed with different <b>pore</b> <b>fluids</b> in order to observe how the fine-grained material mechanically responded. The diffuse double layer theory has been used to interpret the data of vane shear tests in order to explain the variation of geotechnical responses with the different clays. Van der Waals forces and double layer forces were obtained and capillary forces calculated. The results show that while for kaolinite and illite the chemistry of the <b>pore</b> <b>fluids</b> has no influence on the water content and hence on the mechanical behaviour of the material, Na-smectite shows a strong correlation between the dielectric constant of the <b>pore</b> <b>fluids</b> and an increase in undrained shear strength.

30|$|Cl− {{concentrations}} in the <b>pore</b> <b>fluids</b> at the bacterial mats are lower than that in seawater (SW) (Toki et al. [2004]). Deviations of the chemical and isotopic compositions of the <b>pore</b> <b>fluids</b> from those of SW {{have been attributed to}} the mixing of fluids with compositions differing from those of SW (Kastner et al. [1991]; Tsunogai et al. [2002]; Dählmann and de Lange [2003]; Mazurenko et al. [2003]; Toki et al. [2004]; Hiruta et al. [2009]). Since each of these fluid sources is characterized by specific O and H isotopic compositions (e.g., Kastner et al. [1991]). The seepage fluids on the Oomine Ridge have been inferred to originate from horizontally transported groundwater because the δ 18 OH 2 O and δDH 2 O values of the <b>pore</b> <b>fluids</b> at the cold seep sites on the Oomine Ridge are in the range of those of groundwater in coastal northwestern Japan (Toki et al.

30|$|Slow-slip events (SSEs) in plate-subduction {{zones are}} related to the {{presence}} of high-pressure <b>pore</b> <b>fluids</b> that are generated by the dehydration of hydrous minerals within the subducted oceanic plate (Schwartz and Rokosky, 2007; Audet et al., 2009; Song et al., 2009; Kato et al., 2010). Geodetic and seismological observations have revealed that a majority of SSEs occur repeatedly on the plate boundary at depths of around 20 – 40 km (Schwartz and Rokosky, 2007; Delahaye et al., 2009), just beneath the seismogenic zone for megathrust earthquakes. Seismic studies have detected high-Poisson-ratio anomalies that indicate the presence of <b>pore</b> <b>fluids</b> in the source areas of these events (Audet et al., 2009; Kato et al., 2010). Deep non-volcanic tremors have also been detected in some of these areas, and their rapid migrations can be explained by fluid flow along the subducting plate (Vidale et al., 2009). Moreover, the fact that tremors can apparently be triggered by very small stress perturbations suggests that the shear strength is small on the plate interface because of high-pressured fluids (Miyazawa and Mori, 2006). Laboratory experiments on rock friction have indicated that the injection of <b>pore</b> <b>fluids</b> effectively decreases shear strength (Kato et al., 2003). Simulations incorporating these experimental results imply that high-pressure <b>pore</b> <b>fluids</b> help to create a frictional regime on plate boundaries that could periodically trigger SSEs (Scholz, 1998; Liu and Rice, 2007).|$|R
40|$|Data {{concerning}} potential solid {{products of}} the interaction of cement <b>pore</b> <b>fluids</b> with bentonite have been reviewed with respect to accurate prediction of bentonite alteration in the long-term. Calcium (aluminium) silicate hydrates (C(A) SH), zeolites, feldspars, hydroxides, carbonates, polymorphs of silica, and some sheet silicates (all of varying degrees of crystallinity) are potential products of cement–bentonite interaction. Evidence from natural systems and laboratory studies suggests that most, {{or all of these}} phases, may precipitate on timescales of interest to safety assessment of the geological disposal of radioactive wastes. These data indicate that growth kinetics of secondary minerals is equally as important as thermodynamic stability in controlling occurrence. C(A) SH show variable Ca/Si ratio and Al contents. At high pH (> 11), the growth of C(A) SH minerals provides a means by which OH− ions from cement <b>pore</b> <b>fluids</b> may be titrated. Although thermodynamic data exist for a number of naturally-occurring crystalline C(A) SH minerals, they are of doubtful quality and should be applied with caution in predictive modelling. Zeolites are likely to form at lower pH than for C(A) SH, with the Si/Al ratio of the zeolite decreasing with increasing pH of the fluid. Zeolite stability is also strongly dependent upon silica activity in the fluid phase. Although silica activity in bentonite <b>pore</b> <b>fluids</b> will be spatially (and temporally) variable as hyperalkaline alteration proceeds, it is likely that minerals which could form would be those stable in quartz-saturated or supersaturated fluids. Currently available thermodynamic data for zeolites tend to overestimate their stability, leading to inaccurate predictions of their occurrence. Notwithstanding this uncertainty, it is considered that the following secondary minerals are the most likely to form in low temperature cement–bentonite systems: calcite, dolomite, chalcedony, C(A) SH of variable Ca/Si ratio, K-feldspar, illite, phillipsite, analcime, clinoptilolite, and heulandite. The relatively more siliceous zeolites (clinoptilolite, phillipsite) are likely to form at lower pH (distal regions of migrating cement <b>pore</b> <b>fluids),</b> whereas C(A) SH, illite, feldspars, and the more aluminous zeolites (analcime, heulandite) are more likely to form at higher pH and hence, the more proximal regions of migrating cement <b>pore</b> <b>fluids.</b> Predominantly Na-, K-bearing solids will be transformed to those dominated by Ca as the composition of cement <b>pore</b> <b>fluids</b> evolves with time...|$|R

50|$|An {{intuitive}} {{sense of}} the response of a saturated elastic porous medium to mechanical loading can be developed by thinking about, or experimenting with, a fluid-saturated sponge. If a fluid- saturated sponge is compressed, fluid will flow from the sponge. If the sponge is in a fluid reservoir and compressive pressure is subsequently removed, the sponge will reimbibe the fluid and expand. The volume of the sponge will also increase if its exterior openings are sealed and the <b>pore</b> <b>fluid</b> pressure is increased.

The data for Cl− and δ 18 O, however, are scattered (Figure  2), implying that the <b>pore</b> <b>fluids</b> did not result from the simple mixing of two sources such as SW and another end member. Among the cold seep samples, sample D 949 C 3 - 3 (Cl−[*]=[*] 498  mmol/kg, B[*]=[*] 1.3  mmol/kg, δ 18 OH 2 O[*]=[*]− 0.4 ‰, δDH 2 O[*]=[*]− 3.4 ‰) differs most from SW with respect to these values (Figure  2).

The level of B in seepage fluids is controlled mainly by interactions of sediment or rock with water, which depends on the temperature of the reaction (You and Gieskes [2001]). High B concentrations have been reported in <b>pore</b> <b>fluids</b> from mud volcanoes (Aloisi et al. [2004]; Teichert et al. [2005]; Haese et al. [2006]; Hensen et al. [2007]; Reitz et al.

The high temperatures required for such alteration occur at great depths in sediments and rocks of the Earth's crust, depending on the thermal gradient in a given area. Generally, average thermal gradients are between 50 °C/km and 60 °C/km (Parsons and Sclater [1977]), and high-temperature environments of 150 °C to 160 °C are found at 2 to 3  km below the seafloor.
