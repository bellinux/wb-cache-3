5|$|The Silver Strand Highway was {{constructed}} {{and open to}} the public by 1924. What would become SR75 was added to the state highway system in 1933, and designated Legislative Route 199 in 1935. SR75 was not officially designated until the 1964 state highway renumbering. The Coronado Bay Bridge opened in 1969, and provided a direct connection between San Diego and Coronado. Since then, various <b>proposals</b> <b>have</b> taken place to relieve commuter traffic between San Diego and Naval Air Station North Island that traverses the city of Coronado. However, none of these <b>proposals</b> <b>have</b> gained support, including an attempt in 2010.|$|E

5|$|WSDOT is {{studying}} several different proposed {{changes to the}} SR224 / SR225 intersection to improve traffic flow. Several <b>proposals</b> <b>have</b> been introduced to alleviate the situation, including replacing the stop sign at the intersection with a traffic light, reconfiguring the intersection and the off ramp from I-82, and implementing several options featuring roundabouts. WSDOT favors the roundabout options and estimates costs will range between $2 and $7.4million to construct.|$|E
5|$|Interstate 605 (I-605) is {{the common}} {{designation}} given by local media outlets to several proposals for a new auxiliary Interstate Highway bypassing I-5 and I-405 in the U.S. state of Washington. <b>Proposals</b> <b>have</b> been heard from since the 1960s, including highways connecting from I-5 {{all the way to}} the Canada–US border, and some just between I-5 and I-90. The Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) has no projects designated I-605 at this time. However, a project to convert State Route 18 (SR18) to a limited-access freeway is under construction currently.|$|E
5|$|KC-33A – A {{proposed}} 747 {{was also}} adapted as an aerial refueling tanker and was bid against the DC-10-30 during the 1970s Advanced Cargo Transport Aircraft (ACTA) program {{that produced the}} KC-10A Extender. Before the 1979 Iranian Revolution, Iran bought four 747-100 aircraft with air-refueling boom conversions to support its fleet of F-4 Phantoms. There is a report of using a KC-33A in H-3 airstrike during Iran–Iraq War. It is unknown whether these aircraft remain usable as tankers. Since then, other <b>proposals</b> <b>have</b> emerged for conversion of later 747-400 aircraft for this role.|$|E

5|$|Several <b>proposals</b> <b>have</b> {{been made}} to bypass the Antelope Valley Freeway by boring a tunnel under the San Gabriel Mountains and {{extending}} the Glendale Freeway through it to the Antelope Valley. In 2003, Caltrans published a map showing potential improvements to the transportation infrastructure of southern California. The proposal showed both the unconstructed portion of Route 14 and new routes over or under the mountains to Antelope Valley. In 2005, the idea was advanced as a combination toll tunnel and surface highway. Preliminary studies estimated costs around $3 billion and suggested charging a varying toll, adjusted for the time of day, averaging around $8 for one-way passage.|$|E
5|$|Since the {{transfer}} of Eurostar services from Waterloo, the former Eurostar platforms 20–24 of Waterloo International have remained unused. Waterloo suffers significant capacity problems, and <b>proposals</b> <b>have</b> {{been put in place}} to convert the former international station to domestic use. In December 2008 preparatory work was carried out to enable platform 20 to be used by South West Trains suburban services. However, the conversion of the remaining platforms was delayed as it would require alterations to the track layout outside the station.|$|E
5|$|Special permits {{exist to}} allow for the sale of {{alcoholic}} beverages at golf courses, government-owned facilities, and at social events run by non-profit organizations (for example, church carnivals). A restaurant in New Jersey without a liquor license can sell wine from a New Jersey winery by becoming an offsite retail sales outlet of the winery. Since the early 1990s, there have been a handful of unsuccessful proposals to create a separate restaurant license allowing eating establishments to sell beer and wine. Such <b>proposals</b> <b>have</b> been strongly opposed by current retail license holders who believe that it would decrease their income, and thus the value of their liquor license.|$|E

5|$|The {{plan for}} the {{extension}} to Camberwell was kept alive throughout the 1930s and, in 1940, the permission was used to construct sidings beyond Elephant & Castle. After the Second World War, the plans were revised again, with stations located under Walworth Road and Camberwell Green, and the extension appeared on tube maps in 1949. Rising construction costs caused by difficult ground conditions and restricted funds in the post-war austerity period led the scheme to be cancelled again in 1950. Various <b>proposals</b> <b>have</b> been evaluated since, including an extension to Peckham considered in the early 1970s, but the costs have always out-weighed the benefits.|$|E
5|$|The {{project was}} {{presented}} {{as part of the}} original proposal of the Bergen Line when approved by Parliament in 1894, but due to the narrow gauge on the Drammen Line at the time, a temporary solution via Roa was chosen instead. Later <b>proposals</b> <b>have</b> been launched, and parliament has voted over it in 1954, 1978, 1984 and 1992; only the last being passed, but not followed up by funding, and the Norwegian National Rail Administration has not allocated any date to start construction; detailed plans have however been produced.|$|E
5|$|The scheme has {{attracted}} criticism from various sources, and certain aspects and <b>proposals</b> <b>have</b> been particularly controversial. A planned 42-storey hotel and residential building on one block—which {{was not in}} the original plan and for which planning permission was later denied—was opposed by many local people and politicians, and was eventually rejected by a government minister on appeal. The decision to allow a large supermarket branch to be built {{in the middle of the}} development was also unpopular. A campaign group was formed to co-ordinate and raise the awareness of people's concerns.|$|E

5|$|Trains {{originally}} ran until 01:00, but {{following the}} privatisation {{of the service}} through concession to Metrovías, the company temporarily moved the closing time back two hours in 1994 to carry out works on the lines, a change which was never reverted even after the works were completed. There have been numerous petitions {{as well as a}} campaign by the City Ombudsman to extend services to 1:30 on weekdays and 3:00 on Fridays and Saturdays. These <b>proposals</b> <b>have</b> been rejected by Subterráneos de Buenos Aires, which stated in 2015 that the reduced schedule is needed in order to carry out infrastructure modernisation works across all the lines while they are closed.|$|E
5|$|A girl born at {{the station}} in 1924 was the first baby to be born on the Underground network. The Bakerloo line {{building}} remains much as originally constructed and is a typical Leslie Green structure. The Northern line building was designed by Thomas Phillips Figgis, and was rebuilt several times until the current structure opened in 2003. Transport for London (TfL) is currently planning a major upgrade to the station. A Bakerloo line extension south to Camberwell was planned and approved in 1931 but construction never started. Similar <b>proposals</b> <b>have</b> been revived on several occasions; in 2014 TfL ran a consultation on an extension to Hayes and Beckenham Junction, which is still under consideration.|$|E
