5|$|Brooks {{collected}} a bronze in the medley relay after swimming the freestyle leg in the heats before {{being replaced by}} first-choice Stockwell in the final. Competing {{in the third and}} final heat, Australia and the United States were equal at the last change before Brooks posted the fastest freestyle leg in the heats, <b>pulling</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> 0.40s margin over Tom Jager. Australia again qualified fastest, but the Americans again had more in reserve, having rested all of their first-choice quartet in the heats. Stockwell combined with Kerry, Evans and Glenn Buchanan to finish behind the United States and Canada in the final, missing silver by just 0.02s. Australia improved on their qualifying time by only 0.68s, while the Americans sped up by 5.03s.|$|E
5|$|Looking to {{make good}} on Riley's promise in the 1987–88 season, the Lakers took their seventh {{consecutive}} Pacific Division title with a 62–20 record. They swept the Spurs {{in the first round of}} the Western Conference Finals before <b>pulling</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> tough seven-game series win over the Utah Jazz led by youngsters Karl Malone and John Stockton. A seven-game Western Conference finals win over the Dallas Mavericks propelled the Lakers to the NBA Finals once again. In their seventh trip to the Finals in nine years, they met the Detroit Pistons. Los Angeles would take the series in seven games, and James Worthy's game seven triple-double earned him a Finals MVP award. The win marked their fifth title in nine years, but would also mark their last title until 2000.|$|E

5|$|The safety {{car came}} back in on lap 32, with Rosberg leading the field at the flying restart, quickly <b>pulling</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> two-second {{advantage}} over Hamilton. Sergio Pérez was {{the winner of the}} restart, moving up three places into 11th and moving up another position several laps later. On lap 39, Button moved ahead of Felipe Nasr into seventh position. After keeping the gap at around two seconds for a number of laps, a mistake by Rosberg saw Hamilton close back up to him, allowing him to use the drag reduction system to attempt an overtake manoeuvre. Several drivers decided to change tyres for a second time around lap 50, including Valtteri Bottas on lap 52, while Nico Hülkenberg took his third stop a lap before, serving a five-second time penalty for speeding in the pitlane in the process. On lap 55, Hamilton {{was the first of the}} leading duo to come in for a pitstop, followed by Rosberg a lap later. A quicker stop for Rosberg and a mistake by Hamilton on his lap after pitting saw Rosberg emerge from his stop ahead. Verstappen was in the lead, soon followed closely by the two Mercedes drivers. On lap 58, Räikkönen overtook Ricciardo for fourth place, while Verstappen was staying in the lead with soft compound tyres he fitted on lap 15. He lost the lead to Rosberg however on lap 61, with Hamilton getting past him as well soon after. As the Mercedes duo battled for the race win, several drivers retired in the closing stages of the race, including Hülkenberg and Massa. Räikkönen was closing in to Verstappen in third, while Pascal Wehrlein edged closer to Bottas in tenth place as well. On the last lap, Hamilton attempted to overtake Rosberg into turn two. Hamilton went to the outside but Rosberg turned into the corner late on the inside and both cars touched, damaging Rosberg's front wing and pushing Hamilton off the track. They almost touched again as Hamilton rejoined the track. Hamilton eventually got ahead into turn three as Rosberg nursed his damaged car to the finish line. He was relegated to fourth position as both Verstappen and Räikkönen moved past him over the course of the lap. Further behind, Pérez retired, elevating Wehrlein into the last point-scoring position in tenth.|$|E
25|$|Similar to 1984, both Ontario-based {{team were}} undefeated after two games, and {{faced each other}} in the last game of the round-robin. The game was played in front of 11,134 fans, lasting 4 hours 15 minutes into double overtime, with Oshawa winning 5–4. Kitchener then played Laval in the semi-finals. It was a very close game throughout, with Kitchener <b>pulling</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> 5–4 victory.|$|E
25|$|On July 27, 2005, former Miami city {{commissioner}} Arthur Teele {{walked into the}} main lobby of the Heralds headquarters and phoned Herald columnist Jim DeFede (one of several telephone conversations that the two had had during the day) {{to say that he}} had a package for DeFede. He then asked a security officer to tell his (Teele's) wife Stephanie that he loved her, before <b>pulling</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> gun and committing suicide. This happened the day the Miami New Times, a weekly newspaper, published salacious details of Teele's alleged affairs, including allegations that he had had sex and used cocaine with a transsexual prostitute.|$|E

25|$|Later on {{election}} night, after Obama {{was named the}} winner, he picked up several more wins in swing states in which the polls had shown a close race. These included Florida, Indiana, Virginia, and the western states of Colorado and Nevada. All of these states had been carried by Bush in 2004. North Carolina and the bellwether state of Missouri remained undecided for several days. Eventually Obama was declared the winner in North Carolina and McCain in Missouri, with Obama <b>pulling</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> rare win in Nebraska's 2nd congressional district. This put the projected electoral vote count at 365 for Obama and 173 for McCain. Obama's victories in the populous swing states of Florida, Ohio, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, and Virginia contributed to his decisive win. The presidential electors cast their ballots for President and Vice President, and Congress tallied these votes on January 8, 2009.|$|E
25|$|In Thredson's playroom, Thredson rapes Lana, who {{begins to}} see Shachath, but refuses to die just yet. Thredson returns and offers Lana to die by {{strangulation}} or having her throat cut. As {{he tries to}} administer a sedative, she attacks him, renders him unconscious, and escapes into the street. She is {{picked up by a}} man (William Mapother) who begins to go on a misogynistic tirade against women and his wife who cheated on him. He refuses {{to take her to the}} police and begins driving at high speed, becoming manic and <b>pulling</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> gun. Lana sees Shachath in the back seat of the car and the man shoots himself in the head, causing the car to careen wildly. Lana wakes up in Briarcliff, having been returned there after the crash was discovered. She frantically tells Sister Mary Eunice that Kit is innocent and that Bloody Face is Thredson, urging her to tell the police. Sister Mary Eunice – who has known this all along – says she believes her, and tells her she is safe in Briarcliff. As she leaves, she tells the guard, Frank, that Lana is just confused from her accident.|$|E
500|$|The {{laughing}} gas {{has been in}} desperately short supply at Holby of late. [...] What they really need is {{for someone to come}} along and prove that heart transplants can be fun. It's a job for comedy cardiac specialist Percy Durant (guest star Ade Edmondson), who we last saw working out in Ghana with consultant Ric. You could easily imagine Percy driving around in a van with a big, red, plastic heart on top of it, or cracking open someone's chest and <b>pulling</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> bunch of flowers.

500|$|The series {{revolves}} around Dexter (voiced by Christine Cavanaugh in seasons 1–2; Candi Milo in seasons 3–4), a bespectacled boy-genius who possesses a secret laboratory {{hidden behind a}} bookcase in his bedroom. The laboratory is filled with Dexter's inventions and can be accessed by speaking various passwords or by activating hidden switches on Dexter's bookshelf (e.g. <b>pulling</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> specific book). Though highly intelligent, Dexter often fails at what he has {{set out to do}} when he becomes overexcited and makes careless choices. Although he comes from a typical all-American family, Dexter speaks with a thick accent of indeterminate origin. Christine Cavanaugh described it as [...] "an affectation, some kind of accent, we're not quite sure. A small Peter Lorre, but not. Perhaps he's Latino, perhaps he's French. He's a scientist; he knows he needs some kind of accent." [...] Genndy Tartakovsky explained, [...] "He considers himself a very serious scientist, and all well-known scientists have accents." ...|$|E
500|$|On {{the tour}} in {{promotion}} of the album, Green Day aimed for simplicity and decided not to bring new instrumentalists {{to play for the}} new songs. [...] Armstrong commented, [...] "Right now we're refraining from <b>pulling</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> lot of that 'Nimrod' stuff. We want to make things small. We don't want to bring a horn section or a violin player out with us. A {{lot of people want to}} hear the old stuff, and that stuff is still just as significant to us." [...] The band also decided to play small theaters instead of stadiums and festivals, as Armstrong explained that they felt better to [...] "go to a place like The Fillmore and The Warfield and know it's actually going to sell out" [...] instead of playing to half-empty large venues. The Nimrod tour marked the first time the band performed its now-routine ritual of inviting audience members onstage to play instruments. [...] During the tour, Armstrong felt that he became a better performer, noting, [...] "I think some people walk away from a Green Day concert with the emotions you would get from some kind of theater performance where the crowd feels involved — where it's not just about the singer. It's not just about the band." ...|$|E
