25|$|The {{paradigm}} of toxicological assessment of benzene is shifting towards {{the domain of}} molecular toxicology as it allows understanding of fundamental biological mechanisms in a better way. Glutathione seems {{to play an important}} role by protecting against benzene-induced DNA breaks and it is being identified as a new biomarker for exposure and effect. Benzene causes chromosomal aberrations in the peripheral blood leukocytes and bone marrow explaining the higher incidence of leukemia and multiple myeloma caused by chronic exposure. These aberrations can be monitored using fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) with DNA probes to assess the effects of benzene along with the hematological tests as markers of hematotoxicity.

40|$|For optimal activation, T {{suppressor}} cells must {{receive a}} signal froma specialized inducer cell. The activating signal is delivered by a molecular complex that is composed, in part, of <b>polymorphic</b> <b>gene</b> {{products that are}} controlled by the immunoglobulin heavy chain complex (Igh) and that map to the variable region (Igh-V) of the complex. Consequently, if suppressor/inducer cells and their acceptor cells do not share Igh-V-encoded polymorphisms, the inducer molecules fail to activate the suppressor cells. Other <b>polymorphic</b> <b>gene</b> products (those that act as transplantation antigens on methylcholanthrene-induced fibrosarcomas) {{have been shown to}} be encoded by a gene(s) that maps to the same general region of chromosome 12 as does the Igh complex. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that <b>polymorphic</b> <b>gene</b> products expressed by the T suppressor/inducer cell and its biologically active product were related to the transplantation antigens on these fibrosarcomas. We have found that isoantisera directed to a number of BALB/c methylcholanthrene-induced tumors block the induction of T suppressor cells but they do so only if the inducer or acceptor T cell (or both) expresses BALB/c Igh-linked polymorphisms. All other BALB/c gene products are irrelevant. These findings suggest that “transformation related antigens” on some sarcoma cells are variants of, or are otherwise related to, the cell interaction molecules that T cell subsets use to communicate with one another under normal circumstances. Furthermore, the findings that (a) multiple methylcholanthrene-induced tumors express serologically related antigens (as well as the unique ones that have been previously demonstrated by transplantation tests) and (b) these serologically related antigens can be found on Igh-V-controlled T cell communication molecules raise the intriguing possibility that, like certain viruses, methylcholanthrene reacts with specific regions of cellular DNA that either directly or indirectly regulate the expression of other specific genes (in this particular case the genes that encode the T cell communication molecules) ...|$|R

In contrast, {{there is a single}} <b>polymorphic</b> X-linked <b>gene</b> in most New World primates with three alleles coding for spectrally distinct pigments. The one reported exception to this rule is the New World howler monkey that follows the Old World system of separate LW and MW genes. A comparison of gene sequences in these different genetic systems indicates that the duplication that gave rise to the separate MW and LW genes of Old World primates is more ancient than that in the howler monkey. In addition, the amino acid sequences of the two howler monkey pigments show similarities to the pigments encoded by the <b>polymorphic</b> <b>gene</b> of other New World primates. It would appear therefore that the howler monkey gene duplication arose after the split between New and Old World primates and was generated by an unequal crossover that placed two different forms of the New World <b>polymorphic</b> <b>gene</b> on to a single chromosome.

Primary combined end-point included the following: genetic analysis of monogenic disease, chromosome aberrations, genotypes and allele patterns for main <b>polymorphic</b> candidate <b>genes</b> participating in arterial hypertension (AH) and atherosclerosis pathogenesis; pharmacogenetic features of lipid-lowering and antihypertensive pharmaceutical therapy effectiveness; incorporated gamma-nuclide activity in critical organs. Results. Combined therapy with statins (target levels achieved in 92 % of the patients), fibrates (91 %), and angiotensin II antagonists (95 %) was highly effective and safe in RVH / ischemic nephropathy treatment. Genetic analysis demonstrated monogenic disease, adverse <b>polymorphic</b> <b>gene</b> genotypes, and chromosome aberrations linked to AH, atherosclerosis and metabolic syndrome (MS), in more than 30 % of the participants. Stem sell transplantation (SCT) resulted in a 7, 1 -fold increase in concentration of mononuclear cells with high telomerase activity and long telomeres. Higher prevalence of adverse genome characteristics in Ural population (by 2, 7 times, comparing to Dutch population) could be partially explained by adverse radio-ecology in the former region: caesium, iodine, cobalt, manganese, and chrome concentrations were 12, 6 times higher than their upper safety limits. SC could act as radionuclide discorporants, reducing radionuclide concentration by 1, 4 - 2, 3 times. Pharmacogenetic analysis demonstrated minimal gene polymorphism sensitivity and maximal effectiveness for the combination of fluvastatin forte and fenofibrate M (36 %), as well as valsartan (44 %).

50|$|The MiHAs {{bound to}} a MHC {{presented}} {{on a cell}} surface may {{be recognized as a}} self peptide or not recognized by either CD8+ or CD4+ T cells.
