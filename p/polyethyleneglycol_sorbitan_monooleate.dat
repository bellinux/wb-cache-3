40|$|This {{scientific}} {{opinion of the}} EFSA Panel on Food Contact Materials, Enzymes, Flavourings and Processing Aids deals with the safety evaluation of iron based oxygen absorber systems comprising iron, sodium chloride, water, silica gel, activated carbon, monosodium glutamate, potassium acid tartrate, powdered cellulose, malic acid, chabazite, hydroxypropyl cellulose, potassium carbonate, sodium thiosulfate, propylene glycol, glycerin, <b>polyethyleneglycol</b> <b>sorbitan</b> <b>monooleate,</b> sodium propionate and clinoptilolite, incorporated in sachets, patches and cards. Iron, the main active ingredient reacts with oxygen to form iron hydroxide and iron oxide, thereby removing oxygen from the primary packaging. Only activated carbon has not been evaluated as such, but it meets the specifications for activated charcoal which is authorised as additive for plastic materials and articles in contact with foods. All other ingredients of the oxygen absorber formulations have been evaluated and approved for use as additives in plastic food contact materials and/or as food additives and/or food supplements or feed additives. The active system being based on solid ingredients and not intended for direct contact with liquid food or food with an external liquid surface, migration through the gas phase was screened for 9 representative active systems. No volatiles derived from the active mixtures were detected. Therefore the CEF Panel concluded that the substances do not raise a safety concern when used in oxygen absorbers in sachets, patches or cards, placed in the headspace of the packaging or when used {{in direct contact with}} food, excluding liquid food or foods that have an external aqueous liquid phase on the surface such as sliced fruits and fresh meat...|$|E
40|$|Smegmatocin, {{a protein}} {{produced}} by Mycobacterium smegmatis ATCC 14468, {{was found to}} have an esterase activity, hydrolyzing Tween 80, polyoxyethylene <b>sorbitan</b> <b>monooleate,</b> added to the assay medium for various "bacteriocins" from mycobacteria. Because M. diernhoferi ATCC 19340 (indicator strain for smegmatocin) is highly susceptible to oleic acid and smegmatocin requires Tween 80 for manifestation of its anti-M. diernhoferi activity, it is likely that smegmatocin-mediated antimicrobial action is caused by oleic acid generated by hydrolysis of Tween 80 by the inherent esterase action of smegmatocin. Other mycobacteriocins from rapidly growing mycobacteria also have inherent esterase activity against Tween 80 and require Tween 80 for expression of antimycobacterial action.

40|$|Emulsifiers {{are used}} in ice cream to produce a dry, smooth {{textured}} product with desireable melting properties. They function by promoting a partial destabilization of the fat emulsion. Polyoxythylene <b>sorbitan</b> <b>monooleate</b> is used very commonly in the ice cream industry for this purpose. The objective {{of this research was}} to examine by transmission electron microscopy the differences in the fat globules in typical ice cream mix emulsions prepared with and without 0. 08 % polyoxyethylene <b>sorbitan</b> <b>monooleate.</b> Ice cream mix was combined 3 : 1 with a 2 % solultion of ultralow gelling temperature agarose at 20 degrees C, fixed with 4 % glutaraldehyde, postfixed with 1 % OsO 4 in imidazole/phosphate buffer, embedded in Spurr resin and thin-sectioned for viewing. The emulsifier reduced the number of casein micelles adsorbed to the fat globules as determined by both TEM and quantification of membrane protein with Kjeldahl analyses. The fat/Serum interfacial tension was also significantly reduced by the presence of emulsifier in the mix. The data suggest that emulsifiers promote fat destabilization through reduction of membrane protein, based on their ability to reduce the fat serum interfacial tension. In the presence of crystallized fat, the emulsion then becomes less stable to shear forces during the whipping and freezing of ice cream...|$|R

40|$|In this {{manuscript}} a synthetic methodology for developing sub 20 nm sized polymeric micellar nanoparticles designed for extravascular imaging and therapy is revealed. A simple, one-pot method is followed, which involves a rapid co-self-assembly of an amphiphilic diblock copolymer (PS-b-PAA) and polyoxyethylene (80) <b>sorbitan</b> <b>monooleate</b> in water. <b>Sorbitan</b> <b>monooleate</b> imparts stability to the micelles {{and helps to}} drive down the particle size below 20 nm. The particles are incorporated with a water soluble dye ADS 832 WS, which absorbs in the near infrared range (λ_(ex) = 832 nm) for sensitive detection with optical and photoacoustic imaging techniques. A candidate lipophilic anti-angiogenic therapeutic agent fumagillin was also incorporated with high entrapment (> 95 %) efficiency. The effectiveness of this theranostic platform for real-time, high-resolution intraoperative photoacoustic imaging for facilitating direct assessment of the sentinel lymph nodes (SLN) in breast cancer staging is demonstrated. The technique offers huge potential providing faster resection of SLN and may minimize complications caused by axillary exploration due to mismarking with dyes or low-resolution imaging techniques. Finally, the biodistribution and organ accumulation of the intravenously and intradermally injected particles are studied in a rodent model by optical imaging.

In this paper, the n-octadecane M-NEPCMs with desirable thermal properties for internally-cooled dehumidification were fabricated by using compound emulsifiers through the in-situ polymerization method. Melamine-formaldehyde resin {{was used as the}} shell material. The effects of the mixing ratio, emulsification methods and amount of the compound emulsifiers on the morphology, size and thermal properties of the M-NEPCMs were investigated experimentally. The optimum weight mixing ratio of the compound emulsifiers is SDS (sodium dodecyl sulfate) :Tween 80 (polyoxyethylene <b>sorbitan</b> <b>monooleate)</b> :Span 80 (<b>sorbitan</b> <b>monooleate)</b> = 0. 1 : 0. 6 : 0. 3, which achieves the best stability of the n-octadecane emulsion.

While some cosmetic products can trigger acne, topical and cosmetic agents {{used in the}} treatment of acne may cause allergic contact dermatitis. Therefore, the choice of cosmetic products is very important for the patients. Limited number of studies have been found in literature investigating allergic contact dermatitis due to only topical drugs in patients with acne vulgaris. Material and Method: In this research, it is aimed to find out the frequency of allergic contact dermatitis caused by cosmetics in patients with acne vulgaris. Fifty patients with acne vulgaris but without clinical signs of contact dermatitis and 50 control cases without contact dermatitis on admittance were included in the study. Skin patch tests of the European standard series (27 allergens) and cosmetic series (45 allergens) with IQ Chamber test materials were applied on the unlesional back of the patient and control groups. Materials with testing substances were taken out of skin 48 hours later and read after 30 minutes and at 72 nd hour, as suggested by International Contact Dermatitis Research Group, and substances leading to reactions were recorded. Results: Sensitivity to <b>sorbitan</b> <b>monooleate,</b> in the cosmetic series, was found to be significantly higher in the patient group (p= 0, 022).

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to produce insulin-loaded {{microspheres}} allowing the preservation of peptide stability during both particle processing and insulin release. Our strategy was to combine the concepts of using surfactants to improve insulin stability while optimising overall microsphere characteristics such as size, morphology, peptide loading and release. Bovine insulin was encapsulated within poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA 50 : 50, Resomer RG 504 H) microspheres by the multiple emulsion-solvent evaporation technique. Microspheres were prepared by adding to the primary emulsion three non-ionic surfactants, poloxamer 188, polysorbate 20 and <b>sorbitan</b> <b>monooleate</b> 80, at different concentrations (1. 5 and 3. 0 % w/v). The presence of surfactants was found to decrease the mean diameter and to affect the morphology of the microspheres. Insulin encapsulation efficiency was reduced {{in the presence of}} surfactants and especially for <b>sorbitan</b> <b>monooleate</b> 80, in a concentration-dependent mode. The influence of the surfactants on the interactions between insulin and PLGA together with the primary emulsion stability were found to be the major determinants of insulin encapsulation. The release of insulin from microspheres was biphasic, showing an initial burst effect followed by a near zero-order release for all the batches prepared. The initial burst was related to the presence of insulin molecules located onto or near to the microsphere surface. In the presence of surfactants, a faster insulin release with respect to microspheres encapsulating insulin alone was observed. Insulin stability within microspheres after processing, storage and release was evaluated by reversed phase- and size-exclusion-HPLC. The analysis of microsphere content after processing and 6 months of storage showed that insulin did not undergo any chemical modification within microspheres. On the contrary, during the period of sustained release insulin was transformed in a high-molecular weight product, the amount of which was related to the surfactant used. In conclusion, polysorbate 20 at 3 % w/v concentration was the most effective in giving regular shaped particles with both good insulin loading and slow release, and limiting insulin modification within microspheres...|$|R

40|$|Span 80 (<b>sorbitan</b> <b>monooleate)</b> vesicles behaved {{differently}} from conventional phospholipid vesicles (liposomes) because the former {{had a more}} fluid interface. After doxorubicin hydrochloride (DOX) was encapsulated into the Span 80 vesicle (loading efficiency: 63 %), DOX-loaded Span 80 vesicles (DVs) were thereafter added to Colon 26 cells. It was suggested, from the flow cytometric analysis and confocal laser microscopic observation, that DVs directly deliver DOX into the cytoplasm of Colon 26 cells. DVs showed the different delivery manner from the DOX-loaded liposomes (DLs). It is considered that the difference of delivery manner between DVs and DLs resulted in the difference of cytotoxicity (IC 50); i. e. IC 50 values for DVs and DLs were 5 and &# 62; 30 &# 956;M, respectively. The results obtained herein would give the fundamental findings which {{can contribute to the}} improvement of formulation of conventional liposome-based carrier and its cytotoxicity. </p...|$|R
30|$|Other {{ethoxylate}} surfactants, such as polyoxyethylene sorbitan {{fatty acid}} ester (namely Tween series surfactants), are obtained {{based on their}} degree of ethoxylate polymerization, for example, Tween 20 [polyoxyethylene (20) sorbitan monolaurate, CH 3 (CH 2) 10 COO(OC 2 H 4) 20 C 6 H 8 O(OH) 3], Tween 40 [polyoxyethylene (20) sorbitan monopalmitate, CH 3 (CH 2) 14 COO(OC 2 H 4) 20 C 6 H 8 O(OH) 3], Tween 60 [polyoxyethylene (20) sorbitan monostearate, CH 3 (CH 2) 16 COO(OC 2 H 4) 20 C 6 H 8 O(OH) 3] and Tween 80 [polyoxyethylene (20) <b>sorbitan</b> <b>monooleate,</b> CH 3 (CH 2) 7 CH=CH(CH 2) 7 COO(OC 2 H 4) 20 C 6 H 8 O(OH) 3]. These compounds contain the same hydrophilic end but different hydrophobic terminal groups, like C 12 H 23 CO, C 16 H 31 CO, C 18 H 35 CO and C 18 H 33 CO (Table  2).|$|R
40|$|A high {{internal}} phase (HIP) water-in-oil emulsion {{was used as}} the binder in the selective agglomeration of fine coal from an aqueous suspension of coal and mineral particles. Traditionally, this agglomeration is achieved by a pure oil, hydrophobic, binder. However, the high cost associated with using pure oil makes the process economically unfeasible. Therefore, the emulsion binder introduced in this work was motivated by the economic need {{to reduce the amount of}} organic liquid required in the process. The effect of the agitation time during the agglomeration process and the composition of the emulsion on its performance as a binder were investigated. The best result obtained was for a HIP emulsion made from 3 wt % aqueous NaCl and diesel oil with <b>sorbitan</b> <b>monooleate</b> as the emulsifier. This emulsion had a dispersed phase volume fraction of 0. 94 and achieved a 7. 5 -fold reduction in the amount of organic liquid required to achieve agglomeration...|$|R
