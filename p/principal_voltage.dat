40|$|SummaryVoltage-gated ion {{channels}} {{respond to}} changes in membrane potential by movement of their voltage sensors across the electric field between cytoplasmic and extracellular solutions. The <b>principal</b> <b>voltage</b> sensors in these proteins are positively charged S 4 segments. The absolute magnitude of S 4 movement discriminates two competing classes of gating models. In one class, the movement is 25 Å. Here, using tethered charges attached to an S 4 segment, we provide evidence that the electric field falls across a distance of < 4 Å, supporting a model in which the relative movement between S 4 and the electric field is very small...|$|E
40|$|The {{highly charged}} transmembrane {{segments}} {{in each of}} the four homologous domains (S 4 D 1 –S 4 D 4) represent the <b>principal</b> <b>voltage</b> sensors for sodium channel gating. Hitherto, the existence of a functional specialization of the four voltage sensors with regard to the control of the different gating modes, i. e., activation, deactivation, and inactivation, is problematic, most likely due to a functional coupling between the different domains. However, recent experimental data indicate that the voltage sensor in domain 4 (S 4 D 4) plays a unique role in sodium channel fast inactivation. The correlation of fast inactivation and the movement of the S 4 D 4 voltage sensor in rat brain IIA sodium channels was examined by site-directed mutagenesis of the central arginine residues to histidine and by analysis of both ionic and gating currents using a high expression system in Xenopus oocytes and an optimized two-electrode voltage clamp. Mutation R 1635 H shifts the steady state inactivation to more hyperpolarizing potentials and drastically increases the recovery time constant, thereby indicating a stabilized inactivated state. In contrast, R 1638 H shifts the steady state inactivation to more depolarizing potentials and strongly increases the inactivation time constant, thereby suggesting a preferred open state occupancy. The double mutant R 1635 / 1638 H shows intermediate effects on inactivation. In contrast, the activation kinetics are not significantly influenced by any of the mutations. Gating current immobilization is markedly decreased in R 1635 H and R 1635 / 1638 H but only moderately in R 1638 H. The time courses of recovery from inactivation and immobilization correlate well in wild-type and mutant channels, suggesting an intimate coupling of these two processes that is maintained in the mutations. These results demonstrate that S 4 D 4 is one of the immobilized voltage sensors during the manifestation of the inactivated state. Moreover, the presented data strongly suggest that S 4 D 4 is involved in the control of fast inactivation...|$|E
40|$|The voltage {{dependence}} of steady state current {{produced by the}} forward mode of operation of the endogenous electrogenic Na+/K+ pump in Na(+) - loaded Xenopus oocytes has been examined using a two-microelectrode voltage clamp technique. Four experimental cases (in a total of 18 different experimental conditions) were explored: variation of external [Na+] ([Na]o) at saturating (10 mM) external [K+] ([K]o), and activation of pump current by various [K]o at 0, 15, and 120 mM [Na]o (tetramethylammonium replacement). Ionic current through K+ channels was blocked by Ba 2 + (5 mM) and tetraethylammonium (20 mM), thereby allowing pump-mediated current to be measured by addition or removal of external K+. Control measurements and corrections were made for pump current run-down and holding current drift. Additional controls were done to estimate {{the magnitude of the}} inwardly directed pump-mediated current that was present in K(+) -free solution and the residual K(+) - channel current. A pseudo two-state access channel model is described in the Appendix in which only the pseudo first-order rate coefficients for binding of external Na+ and K+ are assumed to be voltage dependent and all transitions between states in the Na+/K+ pump cycle are assumed to be voltage independent. Any three-state or higher order model with only two oppositely directed voltage-dependent rate coefficients can be reduced to an equivalent pseudo two-state model. The steady state current-voltage (I-V) equations derived from the model for each case were simultaneously fit to the I-V data for all four experimental cases and yielded least-squares estimates of the model parameters. The apparent fractional depth of the external access channel for Na+ is 0. 486 +/- 0. 010; for K+ it is 0. 256 +/- 0. 009. The Hill coefficient for Na+ is 2. 18 +/- 0. 06, and the Hill coefficient for K+ (which is dependent on [Na]o) ranges from 0. 581 +/- 0. 019 to 1. 35 +/- 0. 034 for 0 and 120 mM [Na]o, respectively. The model provides a reasonable fit to the data and supports the hypothesis that under conditions of saturating internal [Na+], the <b>principal</b> <b>voltage</b> {{dependence of}} the Na+/K+ pump cycle is a consequence of the existence of an external high- field access channel in the pump molecule through which Na+ and K+ ions must pass in order to reach their binding sites...|$|E

40|$|Vibrations at {{harmonic}} frequencies {{are reduced}} by injecting harmonic balancing signals into the armature of a linear motor/alternator coupled to a Stirling machine. The vibrations are sensed {{to provide a}} signal representing the mechanical vibrations. A harmonic balancing signal is generated for selected harmonics of the operating frequency by processing the sensed vibration signal with adaptive filter algorithms of adaptive filters for each harmonic. Reference inputs for each harmonic are applied to the adaptive filter algorithms at {{the frequency of the}} selected harmonic. The harmonic balancing signals for all of the harmonics are summed with a principal control signal.

40|$|Identification of <b>principal</b> {{contributors}} to <b>voltage</b> unbalance {{and hence the}} implementation of suitable corrective measures has become an issue of concern for some network providers. In order to comply with stipulated limits, these network service providers require the development of quantitative measures that are reliable. For simple radial networks, the identification of sources {{may be seen as}} a trivial task. However, for interconnected networks which contain untransposed transmission lines and unbalanced loads, the identification of sources of unbalance is a non-trivial task. This paper gives a systematic theoretical approach {{that can be used to}} study the voltage unbalance behaviour exhibited by line and load asymmetries in interconnected network environments. A study network is initially analysed, and the outcomes are employed to develop a new concept termed dasiavoltage unbalance emission vectorpsila to ascertain the overall influence made by an asymmetrical line or a load on voltage unbalance in a global sense. Using the voltage unbalance emission vectors of individual lines and loads, a technique has been developed which enables the identification of dominant {{contributors to}} voltage unbalance levels. Assessments made employing the above technique on the study system are confirmed using unbalanced load flow analysis...|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{the present}} effort was to develop an {{integrated}} system capable of reliable ice-deterioration, de-icing and anti-icing in addition to structural diagnostics to enable aerosurface state awareness. The basis for the system is nanoengineered structured carbon nanotube (CNT) enhancements that can either be embedded within the composite laminates during manufacturing, or applied as a separate surface layer in a secondary process. The aligned CNTs are sufficiently long (20 - 30 um) to span interply matrix regions, acting as mechanical reinforcement in addition to improving electrical conductivity {{by a factor of}} more than a million. Optimized electrode patterns are applied to the CNT-enhanced structure, and hardware provides closed-loop feedback control. Ice-deteriation is based on effective heat capacity, where power is applied to CNT-enhanced laminates (termed fuzzy fiber reinforced plastic, or FFRP) for seconds, and the slope of the temperature rise can be correlated to the thickness of ice present. For de-icing (melting) and anti-icing (prevention of ice formation) a resistive heating <b>principal</b> is used. <b>Voltage</b> is applied to the FFRP material, which heats rapidly due to the small but finite resistance imparted by the CNTs. Structural diagnostics is achieved by monitoring and mapping changes in electrical resistance across electrode grid paths. United States.

40|$|Voltage {{stability}} {{refers to}} the ability of a power system to maintain steady voltages at all buses in the system after being subjected to a disturbance from a given initial operating condition [1]. 	<b>Principal</b> causes of <b>voltage</b> instability are [1 - 5]: heavy load system operation conditions, long distances between generation and load, low source voltages, and insufficient reactive power compensation. The degree of a system voltage stability (the proximity to voltage instability) is strongly influenced by system conditions and its characteristics such as: generation system characteristics (in particular excitation systems), load characteristics, reactive power compensation devices characteristics, voltage control devices, presence of under load tap changing (ULTC) transformers, etc. [4]. 	Usually, in a voltage unstable situation, the voltage magnitudes in some system buses undergo, generally monotonic, decrease in the seconds or minutes following a disturbance. When pronounced, this decrease might endanger the system integrity mainly due to protecting devices that trip generation, transmission, or load equipment leading eventually to a blackout {{in the form of a}} voltage collapse [2], [3]. Voltage collapse is defined as the process by which the sequence of events accompanying voltage instability leads to a blackout or abnormally low voltages in a significant part of the power system [1]. 	Voltage instability is considered as a mayor treat for secure power system operation in many power systems throughout the world. Taking advantages of existing technological solutions, such as synchronized phasor measurements, powerful computational facilities, networking infrastructure and communications, in order to monitor stability conditions and control detected instability are of paramount importance. Wide area monitoring, protection, and control systems open perspectives for effective solution of this problem [6]...|$|R
