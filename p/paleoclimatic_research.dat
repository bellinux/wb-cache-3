40|$|Latest {{developments}} and techniques in paleomagnetic research led to obtain more accurate data for geomagnetic variations in direction {{as well as}} in intensity in the geological past. Geomagnetic excursions are associated with a dramatic reduction in the intensity of the magnetic field and it’s quick collapse. From the last reverse of the magnetic field in Brunhes chron can be seen several such anomalies, two pics of high value of the geomagnetic field, the first 450 000 years ago and the second about 700 000 years ago. Among them are observed several peaks with low values of the geomagnetic field. Comparing the curve of change of the geomagnetic field and the periods of occurrence of geomagnetic excursions with the curve of solar insolation since the last geomagnetic reverse, can be seen some match changes in the geomagnetic field and the appearance of the ice ages. Serbian scientist Milutin Milankovich set theory on the impact of the three astronomical parameters: the axial tilt, the Earth’s orbital precession and the eccentricity on amount of solar insolation. According to him the secular variations of these three astronomical parameters with periods: ecentricity of 100 000 yr. the axial tilt of 42. 000 yr. and the Earth’s orbital precession with periods of 19 and 23 000 years could determine the ice and warm periods in the geological past.

Paleolimnological, taxonomical, ecological and physiological studies on dinoflagellates of the alkaline high mountain Lake Nero di Cornisello (NE Italian Alps) are being carried out in a PhD thesis at the University of Pisa (Italy) within the frame of the “Oloambient” project, a <b>paleoclimatic</b> and paleolimnological <b>research</b> financed by the Autonomous Province of Trento (Italy).

Our results show that monsoon precipitation persistently decreased from 21 ka to ca. 8 ka, and increased after ca. 8 ka, with a precipitation peak at 8 – 3 ka. These changes in East Asian summer monsoon precipitation are synchronous with changes in high-northern-latitude ice volume/ice cover and atmospheric CO 2.

40|$|Speleothems {{are rare}} in high-latitude and high-altitude caves, {{which is why}} Bear Cave in the {{north-western}} Yukon Territory is particularly unique, as it houses some {{of the oldest and}} highest latitude speleothem in the world. In this study, a detailed petrographic and geochemical study was conducted along the profile of a 68 -cm long late-Miocene flowstone from Bear Cave (BC 1) to reveal the processes that took place at the time of deposition, in addition to those that followed, in aims to determine its paleoclimatic suitability. These studies suggest that softer facies are generally representative of disequilibrium conditions, where in-filled textures provide evidence for diagenic phenomena; these processes ultimately obscure the original climate signal, compromising the integrity of the flowstone in terms of its paleoclimatic suitability. Conversely, harder facies are likely deposited in isotopic equilibrium and resistant to post-depositional diagenesis, and are therefore more reliable for detailed paleoclimatic analysis. The variability of the calcite sequences in the profile of BC 1 imply that environmental conditions have been considerably variable of the course of deposition, reflecting alternating cool/dry (softer facies) and warm/wet (harder facies) climatic conditions. Results from radiogenic 4 He-dating constrain the timeframe of deposition, with ages centering around 9. 35 +/- 0. 52 Ma, which are in line with regional geomorphic interpretations.

Therefore, we examined peat humification with depth by Fourier Transformed Infrared (FTIR) measurements of solid peat, C/N ratio, and &delta; 13 C and &delta; 15 N isotope measurements in three bog sites. Peat decomposition generally increased with depth but distinct small scale variation occurred, reflecting fluctuations in factors controlling decomposition. C/N ratios varied mostly between 40 and 120 and were significantly correlated (R 2 > 0. 55, p Sphagnum mosses. The peat was most strongly decomposed at the driest site, where currently peat-forming vegetation produced less refractory organic material, possibly due to fertilizing effects of high sea spray deposition. Decomposition of peat was also advanced near ash layers, suggesting a stimulation of decomposition by ash deposition. Values of &delta; 13 C were 26. 5 &plusmn; 2 &permil; in the peat and partly related to decomposition indices, while &delta; 15 N in the peat varied around zero and did not consistently relate to any decomposition index. Concentrations of DOM partly related to C/N ratios, partly to FTIR derived indices. They were not conclusively linked to the decomposition degree of the peat. DOM was enriched in 13 C and in 15 N relative to the solid phase probably due to multiple microbial modifications and recycling of N in these N-poor environments. In summary, the depth profiles of C/N ratios, &delta; 13 C values, and FTIR spectra seemed to reflect changes in environmental conditions affecting decomposition, such as bog wetness, but were dominated by site specific factors, and are further influenced by ash deposition and possibly by sea spray input...|$|R
40|$|Growing {{pressure}} on sustainable water resource allocation {{in the context}} of global development and rapid environmental change demands rigorous knowledge of how regional water cycles change through time. One of the most attractive and widely utilized approaches for gaining this knowledge is the analysis of lake carbonate stable isotopic compositions. However, endogenic carbonate archives are sensitive to a variety of natural processes and conditions leaving isotopic datasets largely underdetermined. As a consequence, isotopic researchers are often required to assume values for multiple parameters, including temperature of carbonate formation or lake water δ 18 O, in order to interpret changes in hydrologic conditions. Here, we review and analyze a global compilation of 57 lacustrine dual carbon and oxygen stable isotope records with a topical focus on the effects of shifting hydrologic balance on endogenic carbonate isotopic compositions. Through integration of multiple large datasets we show that lake carbonate δ 18 O values and the lake waters from which they are derived are often shifted by >+ 10 ‰ relative to source waters discharging into the lake. The global pattern of δ 18 O and δ 13 C covariation observed in > 70 % of the records studied and in several evaporation experiments demonstrates that isotopic fractionations associated with lake water evaporation cause the heavy carbon and oxygen isotope enrichments observed in most lakes and lake carbonate records. Modeled endogenic calcite compositions in isotopic equilibrium with lake source waters further demonstrate that evaporation effects can be extreme even in lake records where δ 18 O and δ 13 C covariation is absent. Aridisol pedogenic carbonates show similar isotopic responses to evaporation, and the relevance of evaporative modification to <b>paleoclimatic</b> and paleotopographic <b>research</b> using endogenic carbonate proxies are discussed. Recent advances in stable isotope research techniques present unprecedented opportunities to overcome the underdetermined nature of stable isotopic data through integration of multiple isotopic proxies, including dual element 13 C-excess values and clumped isotope temperature estimates. We demonstrate the utility of applying these multi-proxy approaches to the interpretation of paleohydroclimatic conditions in ancient lake systems. Understanding past, present, and future hydroclimatic systems is a global imperative. Significant progress should be expected as these modern research techniques become more widely applied and integrated with traditional stable isotopic proxies...|$|R

The 1 ̆d 6 ff¹³C values of samples of 12 broadleaved trees (seven species) from various paleotropical and neotropical sites along a climatic moisture gradient were investigated. The inter-annual variability between species and sites was studied. Further the relationship between 1 ̆d 6 ff¹³C and precipitation time series was analyzed.

40|$|Marine {{sedimentary}} records {{provide valuable}} information for reconstructing ancient environmental and climatic change, {{and by doing}} so, also contribute knowledge critical for better understanding future climate change. Records from mid-latitude locations, such as New Zealand (Southern Hemisphere), are particularly important for paleoenvironmental research because they provide information on potential climatic teleconnections between equatorial and polar regions. In reality, however, <b>paleoclimatic</b> and paleoceanographic <b>research</b> on mid-latitude records has received limited attention, particularly in the Southern Hemisphere. This thesis focuses on Neogene-Pleistocene drift deposits in the Canterbury Basin, {{also known as the}} Canterbury Drifts, SE New Zealand. The Canterbury Drifts are recognised as important paleoclimate and paleoceanographic archives of the SW Pacific because they record intrinsic signals of variability in South Island climatic conditions (glacial erosion), of tectonic uplift of the Southern Alps (western South Island), and of the flow of intermediate depth water masses and associated currents that originate from Antarctica (i. e. Sub-Antarctic Mode Water, Antarctic Intermediate Water, Antarctic Circumpolar Current). Despite previous research on the Canterbury Drifts, crucial aspects of their history remain unknown, including details of sediment source and supply dynamics relative to climatic, oceanographic and/or tectonic processes, and how SW Pacific climatic and oceanographic conditions have responded to Milankovitch cycles and high latitude conditions. The aim of this thesis was to address these issues by using clay mineralogy, clay geochemistry (trace elements and Nd, Sr isotopes), and particle size analysis of Canterbury Drift deposits recovered from Plio-Pleistocene Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Site 1119 and the Early Miocene Bluecliffs Silt (BCS) Formation. The principal objectives of this thesis were to identify: 1. Changes in South Island weathering regimes and detrital sediment supply relative to Plio-Pleistocene climatic conditions. 2. Change in onland source for shelf sediments relative to environmental conditions, including distinct tectonic events during Plio-Pleistocene drift sedimentation. 3. Connectivity between the Southern Alps ice cap and Antarctic temperatures prior to MIS 11, and Milankovitch (orbital) cycles in Late Pleistocene drift sediments. 4. Changes in climatic, tectonic, oceanic conditions during the Early Miocene- Pleistocene Canterbury Drift succession, and Milankovitch cycles in Early Miocene drift sediments. Plio-Pleistocene changes in South Island weathering regimes and detrital sediment supply are identified from the clay mineralogy of Site 1119 sediments. The abrupt replacement of smectite with higher chlorite and illite contents at 3. 5 Ma is coincident with the global Early-Late Pliocene transition and reflects the onset of a glacially modulated physical weathering regime, which accompanied abrupt global cooling at that time. Chlorite and illite remain abundant through the Late Plio-Pleistocene, consistent with persistent glacial erosion and continually cooling climate. A glacial control on physical weathering is also seen at high resolution (4 ka resolution sampling between 650 - 260 ka) as increased chlorite and illite deposition during cold glacial phases. Changes in clay mineralogy of ODP Site 1119 therefore reflect changes in onland weathering regimes associated with global climate events. The high-resolution record (back to at least MIS 16) also shows close ties between the behaviour of the Southern Alps ice cap and Antarctic atmospheric temperatures. Periods of reduced Antarctic temperature are concurrent with increased glacial erosion on the South Island and increased supply of detrital sediments (chlorite, illite, Th, Rare Earth Elements) directly to Site 1119 during periods of lowered sea level. Cold phases were also a time of reduced Southland Current flow as determined by the fine mean sortable silt and low sand content proxies. Conversely, warm Antarctic temperatures (interglacial and glacialinterglacial transitions) are concurrent with reduced glaciation on the South Island, reduced detrital sediment supply to Site 1119 and faster Southland Current flow. Previous evidence of a connection between SW Pacific climate and Antarctic conditions has been strengthened in this study by using numerous proxies and by providing spectral evidence. Spectral analysis of the clay and particle size data indicates high latitude influence on New Zealand climate and oceanography during the Plio-Pleistocene and highlights complex heat distribution in the Southern Hemisphere. Rare earth elements (REEs) in Site 1119 sediments identify a dominant Torlesse Terrane provenance during the Plio-Pleistocene. Trace element ratios (Th/Sc, Nd/Sc, Rb/Ba) could not confidently identify sediment source and question the conventional use of immobile elements to fingerprint sediment source. Neodymium and Sr isotope data demonstrate intervals of distinct provenance change, alternating between a central Torlesse Terrane source and more a more volcaniclastic-rich sediment input from terranes further south. Specific shifts in the geochemical record between 2. 7 - 2. 3 Ma and 0. 7 - 0. 6 Ma coincide with previously recorded Australian-Pacific plate rotation events, and suggest distinct episodes of tectonic control on sediment supply to the Canterbury Basin. Identification of tectonic control on drift sedimentation highlights the importance of considering tectonic activity when interpreting paleoclimatic signatures in basin environments. Early Miocene BCS drift sediments are dominated by smectites, indicating a prevailing chemically dominated weathering regime during times of low topographic relief in New Zealand, and warm global climatic conditions. Change from a dominantly chemical weathering regime in the Early Miocene to a dominantly physical regime in the Plio- Pleistocene occurred in parallel with the rapid and continuing uplift of the Southern Alps mountain range since the Late Miocene, and with deteriorating climatic conditions from the Late Plio-Pleistocene. The particle size of BCS samples is coarser than Site 1119 sediments and demonstrates long-term fining through the Canterbury Drift succession. This trend is consistent with the widening of eastern shelf areas, continual uplift of the Southern Alps, formation of a mountain glacial cap that accompanied the global Late Cenozoic cooling, and possibly diminishing current flow through a deepening basin environment. Spectral analysis of BCS samples reveals Milankovitch cycles (eccentricity and obliquity) in Early Miocene drifts, and a high latitude influence on New Zealand climatic and oceanographic conditions since the Early Miocene. This research demonstrates that paleoenvironmental studies of mid-latitude sedimentary records, such as the Canterbury Drifts, are integral to piecing together changes in global climatic and oceanographic conditions through time. Understanding how the Earth’s climate has changed in the past, and what has driven these changes, in-turn provides valuable insight into the prediction of, and potential effects of, future climate change...|$|R
40|$|Accurate {{time series}} {{representation}} of paleoclimatic proxy records is challenging because such records involve dating errors {{in addition to}} proxy measurement errors. Rigorous attention is rarely given to age uncertainties in <b>paleoclimatic</b> <b>research,</b> although the latter can severely bias the results of proxy record analysis. Here, we introduce a Bayesian approach to represent layer-counted proxy records – such as ice cores, sediments, corals, or tree rings – as sequences of probability distributions on absolute, error-free time axes. The method accounts for both proxy measurement errors and uncertainties arising from layer-counting-based dating of the records. An application to oxygen isotope ratios from the North Greenland Ice Core Project (NGRIP) record reveals that the counting errors, although seemingly small, lead to substantial uncertainties in the final representation of the oxygen isotope ratios. In particular, for the older parts of the NGRIP record, our {{results show that the}} total uncertainty originating from dating errors has been seriously underestimated. Our method is next applied to deriving the overall uncertainties of the Suigetsu radiocarbon comparison curve, which was recently obtained from varved sediment cores at Lake Suigetsu, Japan.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} an incisive review of paleoclimate science and its relevance to natural-resource management within the Murray-Darling Basin (MDB). The drought of 1997 - 2010 focussed scientific, public and media attention on intrinsic climate variability and the confounding effect of human activity, especially {{in terms of}} water-resource management. Many policy and research reviews make statements about future planning with little consideration of climate change and without useful actionable knowledge. In order to understand future climate changes, modellers need, and demand, better paleoclimate data to constrain their model projections. Here, we present an insight into a number of existing long-term paleoclimate studies relevant to the MDB. Past records of climate, in response to orbital forcing (glacial-interglacial cycles) are found within, and immediately outside, the MDB. High-resolution temperature records, spanning the last 10 ⁵ years, exist from floodplains and cave speleothems, as well as evidence from lakes and their associated lunettes. More recently, historical climate records show major changes in relation to El Niño-Southern Oscillation cycles and decadal shifts in rainfall regimes. A considerable body of research currently exists on the past climates of southeastern Australia but, this has not been collated and validated over large spatial scales. It is clear that a number of knowledge gaps still exist, and there is a pressing need for the establishment of new <b>paleoclimatic</b> <b>research</b> within the MDB catchment and within adjacent, sensitive catchments if past climate science is to fulfil its potential to provide policy-relevant information to natural-resource management into the future. 14 page(s...|$|E
40|$|Various lake phases have {{developed}} in the upper Great Lakes in response to isostatic adjustment and changes in water supply since the retreat of the Laurentide Ice Sheet. Georgian Bay experienced a lowstand that caused a basin wide unconformity approximately 7, 500 years ago that cannot be explained by geological events. Thecamoebians are shelled protozoans abundant in freshwater environments and they are generally more sensitive to changing environmental conditions than the surrounding vegetation. Thecamoebians {{can be used to}} reconstruct the paleolimnology. The abundance of thecamoebians belonging to the genus Centropyxis, which are known to tolerate slightly brackish conditions (i. e. high concentrations of ions) records highly evaporative conditions in a closed basin. During the warmer interval (9000 to 700 yBP), the Centropyxis - dominated population diminishes and is replaced by an abundant and diverse Difflugia dominate population. Historical climate records from Tobermory and Midland, Ontario were correlated with the Lake Huron water level curve. The fossil pollen record and comparison with modem analogues allowed a paleo-water budget to be calculated for Georgian Bay. Transfer function analysis of fossil pollen data from Georgian Bay records cold, dry winters similar to modem day Minneapolis, Minnesota. Drier climates around this time are also recorded in bog environments in Southem Ontario - the drying of Lake Tonawanda and inception of paludification in Willoughby Bog, for instance, dates around 7, 000 years ago.

40|$|Recently, {{a series}} of studies have {{targeted}} the stable isotopic composition of cave ice as a possible source of paleoclimatic information, but none presented an explanation for {{the way in which the}} external climatic signal is transferred to cave ice. While the relation between the stable isotopic composition of precipitation and drip water can be relatively easily determined, a more complex problem arises, i. e., the possible alteration of the primary climatic signal recorded by the oxygen and hydrogen stable isotopes during the freezing of water to form cave ice. Here we report the results of the first detailed investigations of the oxygen and hydrogen stable isotope behavior during the formation of ice in Scărişoara Ice Cave. Samples of ice align on a straight line with a slope lower than 8 in a δ 18 O-δ 2 H plot, characteristic for ice formed by the freezing of water. A model is presented for the reconstruction of the initial isotopic composition of water, despite the complexity induced by kinetic effects during early stages of freezing. These results are consistent with ice that forms by the downward freezing of a stagnant pool of water, under kinetic conditions in the initial stages of the process, and isotopic equilibrium thereafter. As ice caves are described in many parts of the world, otherwise poorly represented in ice-based paleoclimatology, the results of this study could open a new direction in <b>paleoclimatic</b> <b>research</b> so that an array of significant paleoclimate data can be developed on the basis of their study...|$|E
40|$|Polar ice cores {{provide us}} with {{high-resolution}} records of past climate change at high latitudes on both glacial-to-interglacial and millennial timescales. Paleoclimatologists and climate modelers have focused increasingly on the tropics, however, as a potentially important driver {{of global climate change}} because of the region’s role in controlling the Earth’s energy budget and in regulating the water vapor content of the atmosphere. Tropical climate change is often expressed most strongly as variations in precipitation, and closed-basin lakes are sensitive recorders of the balance between precipitation and evaporation. Recent advances in fl oating platformsand drilling technology now offer the paleolimnological community the opportunity to obtain long sediment records from lowland tropical lakes, as illustrated by the recent successful drilling of Lakes Bosumtwi and Malawi in Africa (Koeberl et al., 2005; Scholz et al., 2006). Tropical lakes suitable for <b>paleoclimatic</b> <b>research</b> were sought in Central America to complement the African lake drilling. Most lakes in the Neotropics are shallow, however, and these basins fell dry during the Late Glacial period because the climate in the region was more arid than today. The search for an appropriate lake to study succeeded in 1999 when a bathymetric survey of Lake Petén Itzá, northern Guatemala, revealed a maximum depth of 165 m, making itthe deepest lake in the lowlands of Central America (Fig. 1). Although the lake was greatly reduced in volume during the Late Glacial period, the deep basin remained submerged and thus contains a continuous history of lacustrine sediment deposition. A subsequent seismic survey of Lake Petén Itzá in 2002 showed a thick sediment package overlying basement, with several subbasins containing up to 100 m of sediment (Anselmetti et al., 2006) ...|$|E
40|$|For {{many of the}} world’s lakes, {{particularly}} those in remote regions, {{an assessment of the}} basin’s sensitivity to climate change is limited by the availability of appropriate hydrologic data. A regional steady-state lake water balance model was developed that uses simple, yet easily estimated or obtained, data to generate an aridity index (potential evapotranspiration to precipitation ratio) to predict changes in lake basin area to lake surface area ratio, a non-dimensional lake-basin property that can be easily obtained from digital maps. In the model, lake water balance components include precipitation, lake evaporation, and runoff into the lake. Both basin runoff and evaporation are incorporated in the analytical model using an empirical equation (based on the Budyko hypothesis) that utilizes the aridity index and a calibration parameter to account for vegetative influence. Observed records of lake to basin area ratio, as a function of their evapotranspiration to precipitation ratio, for a range of climates and land cover conditions, were plotted and compared to a family of calculated steady state curves. Dividing the domain of calculated curves into regions of permanent, land-cover change sensitive and ephemeral lakes allows for comparison of model predicted lake classification with lake sediment records. The impact of land cover and climate change on lake persistence is also discussed. The model is most applicable for closed basin lakes in sub-humid, semi-arid, and arid environments. The model can be used: (1) as a diagnostic tool to analyze lake response to climate change; (2) to assess environmental and anthropogenic factors leading to transient lake response; and (3) as a <b>paleoclimatic</b> <b>research</b> tool, to identify lakes that can potentially provide high-resolution paleorecords of water balance...|$|E
40|$|The Alboran Sea is the westernmost {{basin of}} the Mediterranean Sea. Its {{particular}} location, as {{entrance of the}} Atlantic Surface Water (ASW) into the Mediterranean, {{has led to an}} intense paleoceanographic and <b>paleoclimatic</b> <b>research.</b> Nevertheless, {{only a limited number of}} studies provide information related to the dynamics and ecological characteristics of the downward particle flux. In order to determine the influence of seasonal oceanographic changes on the export of particles in the Alboran Sea, one mooring line, ALB- 5 -F, was deployed from July 1997 to May 1998 at 35 º 55. 47 ’N/ 01 º 30. 77 ’W. The mooring location was under the influence of the Almeria-Oran Front (AOF), which is formed by the interaction between the Atlantic jet and the denser and more saline Mediterranean waters. Information based on SeaWIFS images of chlorophyll-a concentration, current-meter, and meteorological data on wind direction and intensity were used. The annual oceanographic pattern of the AOF during the studied period was directly related to the evolution of the Western Anticyclonic Gyre (WAG) and to the 1997 - 98 ’ El Niño Event. Detailed analyses of the planktonic foraminifera, diatom and phytolith fluxes reflect seasonal changes in the main hydrographic and meteorological features in the eastern Alboran Sea. El Niño Event caused a sea surface temperature (SST) increase during fall that forced the proliferation of Globigerinoides ruber and the reduction of the diatoms. Benthic tests were also collected in the sediment trap; highest fluxes of the group were probably related to high bottom water activity. Wind-driven particles were collected along the year, but their fluxes follow the local wind regim...|$|E
40|$|The tight {{coupling}} between the atmospheric and oceanic circulation in the equatorial Atlantic region makes this area an important region for <b>paleoclimatic</b> <b>research.</b> Previous studies report {{the occurrence of}} large amounts of terrigenous material and soil organic carbon (SOC) within the marine sediments of the eastern Gulf of Guinea. We use the accumulation rates (AR) of branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (GDGTs) to identify variations in SOC delivery to the Niger Fan over the last 35 ka, and compare these records to long-chain n-alkanes {{as a proxy for}} higher plant material, to an inorganic proxy for terrigenous input (aluminum AR) and to indicators for the marine productivity (AR of carbonate and crenarchaeol). In addition, sea surface temperatures (SSTs) are calculated based on the TEX 86 H index and environmental factors affecting the SST-reconstructions are discussed. Our results indicate that Al AR are closely connected to the rate of mean sea level change after 15 ka BP, with an additional influence of the increased monsoonal precipitation and extended vegetation cover corresponding to the African Humid Period (14. 8 – 5. 5 ka BP). Branched GDGT AR appears to be determined by shelf erosion in addition to the interplay of monsoonal precipitation and vegetation cover controlling soil erosion. Long-chain n-alkane concentrations clearly show a different trend than the other proxies, which might be due to their predominant eolian transport. Paleo-SSTs show a clear shift from colder temperatures during the last glacial period (20 – 22 °C) to warmer temperatures during the Holocene (24 – 26 °C). However, TEX 86 H -based SSTs are cold-biased compared to recent SSTs and Mg/Ca-based SST reconstructions, which is probably caused by a high seasonality of the Thaumarchaeota, with a maximum productivity of these organisms during the cold summer months. However, a sub-surface production of GDGTs and/or a potential bias of SST reconstruction by terrestrial input could not be completely excluded...|$|E
40|$|Stable {{isotopes}} in ice cores {{drilled in}} the polar and high-mountain region {{have been used}} intensively to reconstruct past climatic changes and atmospheric dynamics. However, no similar {{studies have been conducted}} on perennial ice accumulations in caves due to a limited understanding of the links between the external and cave environments, {{and the way in which}} the climatic signal can be recorded by the cave ice. In this thesis, we successfully designed and build a research methodology for the reconstruction of past climatic changes based on perennial ice accumulation in caves, using as example the Scarisoara Ice Cave, Romania. The ice block in this cave preserves a large variety of candidate proxies for both past climate and environmental changes, the most significant ones being the stable isotopic composition of the ice (a proxy for air temperature) and pollen remains. The ice block has formed by the successive accumulation of layers formed by the freezing of water accumulated from late summer through mid-autumn precipitation. An original method has been developed for the reconstruction of the stable isotopic composition of water before freezing, and further, of the late summer air temperature. Pollen in the ice has been found to reflect changes in surface vegetation at both local and regional scale. A 22 m long ice core has been extracted from the ice block, and stable isotope analyses were performed at high resolution on its entire length. Twenty-sex radiocarbon ages have been used to derive a precise depth-age model for this core. The stable isotope data covers almost the entire Holocene, between 0. 09 and 9. 75 ka BP. The first order fluctuation broadly follows the orbitally induced Northern Hemisphere September insolation, with a minimum in the early Holocene, a slow climb towards a maximum at ~ 5. 0 ka, followed by a very slow cooling towards the present, accentuated after ~ 0. 5 ka. Superimposed on the long-term variations a series of rapid cooling events (RCE) are recorde, the most notable ones being at 9. 5 ka, 8. 2 ka, 7. 9 ka, 6 ka, 4. 2 ka, 3. 2 ka and 0. 9 ka. The timing of these RCEs agrees remarkably well with the Holocene rapid climatic changes and the ice rafted debris (IRD) events in the North Atlantic (NA). Our data suggests that the general trends of temperature changes in mainland Europe during the Holocene were governed by changes in solar output. RCEs were synchronous with NA IRD events, the NA climatic signal originating from sea surface temperature changes and being amplified by atmospheric dynamics. The stable isotope data spanning the past 2000 years clearly shows four climatic events over this interval, attributed to the Roman Warm period (RWP), the Dark Ages Cold Period (DACP), Medieval Warm Period (MWP) and the Little Ice Age (LIA). Our data suggests that air temperature was highly variable during the LIA and more stable during the warm MWP and RWP. As ice caves were described in many parts of the world otherwise poorly represented in ice-based paleoclimatology, the results of this study could open a new direction in <b>paleoclimatic</b> <b>research,</b> so that an array of significant paleoclimate data can be developed based on their study...|$|E
