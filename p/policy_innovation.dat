5|$|During his {{eighteen}} years as Leader of the USSR, Brezhnev's only major foreign <b>policy</b> <b>innovation</b> was détente. While sharing some similarities with Soviet policies pursued during the Khrushchev Thaw, Brezhnev's adoption of détente significantly differed from Khrushchev's precedent in two ways. The first {{was that it}} was more comprehensive and wide-ranging in its aims, and included signing agreements on arms control, crisis prevention, East–West trade, European security and human rights. The second part of the policy was based on the importance of equalising the military strength of the United States and the Soviet Union. Defence spending under Brezhnev between 1965 and 1970 increased by 40%, and annual increases continued thereafter. In the year of Brezhnev's death in 1982, 15% of GNP was spent on the military.|$|E

40|$|This paper investigates how {{piloting}} programmes in China {{can promote}} local <b>policy</b> <b>innovations.</b> By {{using one of}} the piloting emission trading schemes (ETS) in Guangdong province as a case study, it is argued that the main features of the piloting experiments, particularly in the climate change domain, are largely different from previous local marketization experiments that dominate the reform period of China. Whereas previous experiments are often characterized as bottom-up or indigenous initiatives with strong patronage relations to the pro-reform politicians at central level, the current piloting programmes are often crafted in a top-down fashion that is often misaligned with local market or corporate interests. Hence, local <b>policy</b> <b>innovations</b> are designed, developed and brokered by the local state officers,in order to bridge this central–local interest gap. As a result,successful implementation of these <b>policy</b> <b>innovations</b> largely depends on local political traditions, bureaucratic culture and perceptions of distinctive development needs...|$|R

By using a vector autoregressive model that controls for the mutual causality between fiscal policy and financial market performance, we test whether financial markets serve as a transmission mechanism for tax <b>policy</b> <b>innovations.</b> Our findings indicate that indirect taxes have a larger effect on market returns than do labor taxes. Further, corporate tax innovations {{do not have any}} statistically significant effect on stock returns.

Strong effects are found saying that lagged adoptions of neighbors positively affect the current probability of participation. This finding is robust to various changes in specification. The results suggest that in federal systems the diffusion of <b>policy</b> <b>innovations</b> is stimulated by horizontal interactions between jurisdictions. ...|$|R
40|$|Summary]. Now that {{national}} officials are generally familiarised with EU policy, the next {{challenge in the}} Europeanisation of national administrations is to better align national policy initiatives with EU policy developments. New national policies have {{to be placed in}} an EU context to prevent re-fragmentation of the internal market and to share experience in <b>policy</b> <b>innovations</b> at EU level. Raising <b>policy</b> <b>innovations</b> to EU level (‘uploading’) requires engaging in EU dialogues to involve colleagues from other Member States and the Commission in the elaboration of policy and discussions on outcomes. Practice shows, for example in countries preparing for the Presidency, that such dialogues are often insufficiently prepared and that the work and resources involved are easily underestimated. As such, too many and premature ideas are being raised by different countries, and one-off workshops are added to the already overloaded EU policy agenda. Therefore, a better selection of viable innovations and a better preparation of EU dialogues are needed. This paper presents a framework for national officials to come to systematically prepared strategies for initiating discussions at EU level about <b>policy</b> <b>innovations...</b>|$|R
