40|$|Certain {{fluorescent}} pseudomonads {{can protect}} plants from soil-borne pathogens, {{and it is}} important to understand how these biocontrol agents survive in soil. The persistence of the biocontrol strain Pseudomonas fluorescens CHA 0 -Rif under <b>plough</b> <b>pan</b> conditions was assessed in non-sterile soil microcosms by counting total cells (immunofluorescence microscopy), intact cells (BacLight membrane permeability test), viable cells (Kogure's substrate-responsiveness test) and culturable cells (colony counts on selective plates) of the inoculant. Viable but non-culturable cells of CHA 0 -Rif (106 cells g- 1 soil) were found in flooded microcosms amended with fermentable organic matter, in which the soil redox potential was low (<b>plough</b> <b>pan</b> conditions), in agreement with previous observations of <b>plough</b> <b>pan</b> samples from a field inoculated with CHA 0 -Rif. However, viable but non-culturable cells were not found in unamended flooded, amended unflooded or unamended unflooded (i. e. control) microcosms, suggesting that such cells resulted from exposure of CHA 0 -Rif to a combination of low redox potential and oxygen limitation in soil. CHA 0 -Rif is strictly aerobic. Its anaerobic regulator ANR is activated by low oxygen concentrations and it controls production of the biocontrol metabolite hydrogen cyanide under microaerophilic conditions. Under <b>plough</b> <b>pan</b> conditions, an anr-deficient mutant of CHA 0 -Rif and its complemented derivative displayed the same persistence pattern as CHA 0 -Rif, indicating that anr was not implicated in the formation of viable but non-culturable cells of this strain at the <b>plough</b> <b>pan...</b>|$|E

40|$|Maize root {{growth is}} {{negatively}} affected by compacted layers {{in the surface}} (e. g. agricultural traffic) and subsoil layers (e. g. claypans). Both kinds of soil mechanical impedances often coexist in maize fields, but the combined effects on root growth have seldom been studied. Soil physical properties and maize root abundance were determined in three different soils of the Rolling Pampa of Argentina, in conventionally-tilled (CT) and zero-tilled (ZT) fields cultivated with maize. In the soil with a light Bt horizon (loamy Typic Argiudoll, Chivilcoy site), induced <b>plough</b> <b>pans</b> were detected in CT plots {{at a depth of}} 0 - 0. 12 m through significant increases in bulk density (1. 15 to 1. 27 Mg m- 3) and cone (tip angle of 60 º) penetrometer resistance (7. 18 to 9. 37 MPa in summer from ZT to CT, respectively). This caused a reduction in maize root abundance of 40 - 80 % in CT compared to ZT plots below the induced pans. Two of the studied soils had hard-structured Bt horizons (clay pans), but in only one of them (silty clay loam Abruptic Argiudoll, Villa Lía site) the expected penetrometer resistance increases (up to 9 MPa) were observed with depth. In the other clay pan soil (silty clay loam Vertic Argiudoll, Pérez Millán site), penetrometer resistance did not increase with depth but reached 14. 5 MPa at 0. 075 and 0. 2 m depth in CT and ZT plots, respectively. However, maize root abundance was stratified in the first 0. 2 m at the Villa Lía and Pérez Millán sites. There, the hard Bt horizons did not represent an absolute but a relative mechanical impedance to maize roots, by the observed root clumping through desiccation cracks...|$|R
40|$|The {{differences}} in soil properties and crop yield on slopes of varying steepness in intensively cropped paddocks with red ferrosols (Humic Eutrodox), which had evidence of erosion over many years, were determined at 5 sites in north-west Tasmania. We found that soils on the steeper slopes, which have had greater soil loss, had significantly lower topsoil carbon concentrations than soils on flatter slopes. We found that significant redistribution of soil had {{occurred on the}} sites in this study. Areas with concave slope positions had over-thickened topsoils. However, the effect of erosion on the topsoil thickness of eroded slope positions was masked by the uniform depth of cultivation across paddocks. Penetration resistance increased gradually with depth on all transects, indicating no compacted layers or <b>plough</b> <b>pans</b> on these intensively cropped sites. Soil physical properties did not significantly change from non-eroded, level areas to steep, eroded parts of the paddocks, even although considerable soil loss had occurred from the steep slopes. We attribute this to the gradational nature of these red ferrosols, which characteristically have strongly structured subsoils. Crop yield was significantly correlated with slope but was not significantly different on land up to 18 % slope. We anticipate that continued erosion at current rates on this less steep land will inevitably reduce crop yields. We found a significant correlation between organic carbon, total exchangeable bases, extractable K, and crop yield, but no correlation between available water content and crop yield. We conclude that soil organic matter contributes to productivity through its effect on nutrient concentrations. Total exchangeable bases appeared {{to provide the best}} and simplest explanatory model to predict crop yield. We propose a set of 4 tests for future assessment of soil condition on these red ferrosols...|$|R
40|$|Plough pans {{have been}} shown to {{severely}} hamper root development, limit rooting depth and reduce crop yield. However, mechanically loosening of compacted subsoils often gives discouraging results. This has in many cases been related to a quick recompaction of the subsoil after loosening, as loosened subsoils are highly prone to recompaction. We evaluated the degree of recompaction of a mechanically loosened sandy loam. In addition, we studied the effect of <b>plough</b> <b>pan</b> compaction and subsoiling on root and yield response for a winter wheat crop. Plots were mechanically loosened to a depth of 35 cm in 1997 and again in 1998. Perennial grass/clover was grown with limited traffic intensity in 1999 - 2000. The perennial grass/clover was ploughed under in spring 2001 and oats established. Winter wheat was established in the autumn about a month after the harvest of oats. A recompaction experiment was conducted in 2001 and 2002 using the plots from the subsoiling experiment. On-land ploughing was compared with traditional mouldboard ploughing. In addition, the loosened plots were either heavy trafficked (> 6 Mg axle load and high pressure tires) or light trafficked (< 6 Mg axle load and < 100 kPa inflation pressure). In this paper results from the combination of on-land ploughing and light traffic (NINV-OL) and the combination of traditional ploughing and heavy traffic (NINV-TH) will be presented. The loosened soils were referenced by a conventional ploughing-harrowing tillage system (CONV). The CONV soil was treated with on-land ploughing and light traffic from 2001 and experienced traditional ploughing for the last time in 1998. Penetration resistance was recorded in the field. Undisturbed soil cores were taken in 1999 and 2002 from the 18 - 27 and 25 - 30 cm layer and used for measuring porosity, air permeability, Ka, and pore continuity, PO, at – 100 hPa matric potential. Root growth of winter wheat was followed during the growing season applying the minirhizotron technique and supplemented with core sampling at around anthesis (June 11). Grain yield was also determined. The results showed that the combination of on-land ploughing and light traffic mitigated recompaction of the upper subsoil. It was further found that the structural condition of the CONV <b>plough</b> <b>pan</b> was improved from 1999 to 2002. Ka, 100 almost doubled for the 18 - 27 and 25 - 30 cm layers from 1999 to 2002. This suggest that the CONV <b>plough</b> <b>pan</b> had been biologically tilled resulting from high biological activity in the two years of grass ley (1999 and 2000) and a shift from traditional tillage and traffic to on-land ploughing and light traffic when growing cereals in 2001 and 2002. The CONV soil with a biologically ameliorated but still evident <b>plough</b> <b>pan</b> performed similar or better than the <b>plough</b> <b>pan</b> loosened and moderately recompacted NINV-OL soil. The CONV soil facilitated higher root intensity and produced similar yield. For instance, at around anthesis in 2002 (June 16), the fraction of grid frames at 94 - 104 cm depth with roots were 51, 31 and 14 % for CONV, NINV-OL and NINV-TH, respectively. The deep rooting in CONV occurred despite root diameter data indicating that root growth was hampered in the <b>plough</b> <b>pan</b> layer of CONV and NINV-TH. Our results indicate that mechanical subsoiling may create even more constraints than benefits to crop development. Biological amelioration induced by appropriate changes in cropping system as well as tillage and traffic intensity comprise a favourable alternative to mechanical subsoiling for sandy loams with <b>plough</b> <b>pan</b> compaction...|$|E
40|$|A field {{experiment}} was initiated in 1997 with non-inverting soil tillage compared to conventional tillage with annual mouldboard ploughing to either 20 cm depth (CT) or 10 cm depth (RCT). The new system included a non-inverting mechanical loosening {{of the soil}} to approximately 35 cm depth combined with a shallow cultivation of the top 5 cm soil by either a rotovator (NIT) or an S-tine harrow (RNIT). The experiment was located on a sandy loam at the organic farmed Rugballegård Experimental Station. A <b>plough</b> <b>pan</b> at 20 - 35 cm depth was identified by cone penetration measurements. The non-inverting tillage system succeeded in breaking up the <b>plough</b> <b>pan,</b> which reduced the cone index from approximately 1. 8 MPa in the CT and RCT treatments to 0. 6 MPa in the NIT treatment. A detailed soil profile description of the top 30 cm of the soil indicated that root growth was restricted for especially CT and RCT treatments in the form of thickened and horizontally deflected roots at the interface between the topsoil and the <b>plough</b> <b>pan</b> at approximately 22 cm depth. For RCT a new <b>plough</b> <b>pan</b> was under development just below the present ploughing depth at 10 cm. This also resulted in root growth restriction, but to a lesser extent than the deeper <b>plough</b> <b>pan.</b> A soil drop test was performed to characterise soil fragmentation. Undisturbed cubic soil samples were taken from the 5 - 15 cm layer and dropped from 75 cm height in to a metal box. The resulting aggregate size distribution differed between the treatments with geometrical mean weight diameter (GMD) of 5. 7 mm 7. 4 mm and 8. 9 mm for CT, RCT and NIT treatments, respectively. The higher degree of fragmentation for the mouldboard ploughed soil may be explained by higher energy input per soil volume by mouldboard ploughing than by non-inverting deep loosening. The results indicate for the 5 _ 15 cm layer, that plant growth conditions were best for CT treated soil, due to a combination of low cone index and small aggregates. For the 20 _ 35 cm layer, the results indicates best plant growth conditions for NIT treated soil due to a low cone index and less restricted root growth. The spring barley/pea mix with grass/clover undersown yielded on average 47. 6 hkg/ha. There {{were no significant differences between}} treatments...|$|E

Non-inversion and reduced tillage systems are often claimed to be preferable for organic farming. The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the early stage effects of converting a mouldboard-ploughed soil to a non-inversion tillage system. A multi-level experimental strategy including in situ, on-site and laboratory methods was followed in order to relate quantitative measures of soil physical properties directly to soil behaviour in the field. A non-inversion deep soil loosening (0 ¯ 35 cm) tillage system (NINV) was compared to a conventional mouldboard ploughing and harrowing tillage system (CONV). The experimental site was located on an organically managed sandy loam soil. The tillage treatments were applied to plots in two fields (B 3 and B 4) at the experimental site. Limited numbers of measurements were performed in the B 3 field during the 1997 ¯ 1999 growing seasons. A more comprehensive programme was carried out in the B 4 field in May and September 1998. A root-restricting <b>plough</b> <b>pan</b> was detected in the CONV treated soil. The NINV treatment effectively loosened the <b>plough</b> <b>pan</b> resulting in a visibly improved soil structure and a decrease in soil strength. The penetration resistance in the <b>plough</b> <b>pan</b> was reduced from about 1800 kPa in CONV to less than 1000 kPa in NINV when measured at field capacity. The loosening of the <b>plough</b> <b>pan</b> was still evident after 2 years without tillage operations in a perennial grass/clover crop. The topsoil of the CONV treatment had a more desirable tilth than that of the NINV treatment, which had higher soil strength at the 7 ¯ 14 cm depth. In accordance with this, the CONV treated topsoil fragmented more readily than the NINV soil in the field. The laboratory measurements on soil from the September sampling showed that the NINV treatment had lower friability index (i. e., friability index of 0. 16 and 0. 22 for NINV and CONV, respectively) and higher tensile strength of air-dry aggregates. The differences in topsoil tilth were not eliminated by natural soil meliorating processes during the growing season. This paper discusses the early stage effects of converting to non-inversion tillage. A number of years of continued treatment may be required before beneficial effects of non-inversion tillage are manifested in improved topsoil tilth...|$|E

40|$|Spatial {{distribution}} of soil water is driven amongst others by soil plant interactions. Preferential fluxes along roots, root water uptake, canopy interception are processes which affect how water distributed into soil, {{in combination with}} the agricultural practices. However, quantification of the impact of each of these processes on soil water dynamics is hard to characterize. We used geophysical monitoring and experiments to assess spatio-temporal soil moisture distribution in a Maize plot during one growing season. An experimental plot of 2 m x 17 m, situated in a Maize field in Louvain-la-Neuve (in the Loamy Beglian Region) was monitored between the 23 of July and the 21 of September 2009. The experimental plot was equipped with (i) 14 Time Domain Reflectometry (TDR) probes to observe the temporal evolution of soil water content; (ii) 132 electrodes (76 surface electrodes and 56 deep electrodes) for Electrical Resistivty Tomography (ERT), (iii) 7 temperature probes and 7 tensiometers. ERT was used to monitor the 3 -D {{distribution of}} the apparent electrical conductivity (ECb). ERT measurements were made with a Syscal-pro equipement and inverted with the help of BERT 1. 0 (developped by Günther and Carsten). The root colonization of soil in 2 D was characterized by the trench profile method (for 2 rows and 2 inter-rows). A grid with a 5 cm mesh was used to count the number of roots present in each cell, resulting in a vertical 2 D map of root impacts. The TDR results showed difference in soil water content between the Maize row and the inter-row (mainly observable at 10 cm depth and during dry periods). The soil water content dynamics is the most important at 10 cm depth and below the row. With ERT, we can see that the soil electrical conductivity at the upper layer is nearly the same for the three measurement time. However, ECb decrease in depth with the progress of the growing season, especially below the Maize row and under the <b>plough</b> <b>pan</b> level (- 0. 35 m). The triangular distribution of roots decrease with depth and at the <b>plough</b> <b>pan</b> level. The roots are more presents in the Maize row than in the inter-row but roots colonize the inter-row with time. Soil structure and vegetation have an important effect on soil water content distribution. The <b>plough</b> <b>pan</b> and the soil horizons affect the roots distribution and the soil electrical conductivity.

40|$|In {{laboratory}} experiments, earthworms {{are often}} observed to burrow through compacted soil layers, {{leading to the}} general assumption that these animals {{play a significant role}} in regenerating compacted soils in agricultural plots. To demonstrate this role under field conditions, the abundance of earthworm macropores inside compacted zones was estimated on plots under reduced (RT) or conventional tillage (CT). Then, different types of compacted zones typically found in CT (<b>plough</b> <b>pan</b> and compacted clods) and RT plots (compacted volume under wheel tracks) were experimentally simulated in wooden boxes, buried in the field and inoculated with different earthworm species. After 6 weeks of incubation, the number of macropores inside the compacted zones was examined. Field observations showed that approximately 10 % and 30 % of the compacted zones were colonised by at least one macropore in CT and RT plots, respectively. A significantly greater number of anecics was found in RT plots, but we could not conclude that this ecological type of earthworm plays a more major role in the regeneration process in these plots since there were fewer compacted zones and these covered a smaller area in CT. The semi-field experiment provided evidence that earthworm-mediated regeneration of compacted zones is possible and its nature varies between ecological types of earthworm. Lumbricus terrestris, which makes individual burrows that are vertical and deep, was the main species to cross through the <b>plough</b> <b>pan.</b> The other three earthworm species (Aporrectodea giardi, A. caliginosa and A. rosea) did burrow inside the other types of compacted zones (“wheel tracks” and “compacted clods”). In every case, however, macropore density was far greater in non-compacted zones, illustrating that avoidance of compacted soil by earthworms is important and should be taken into account when extrapolating results from laboratory studies...|$|E

We evaluated the effect of <b>plough</b> <b>pan</b> compaction on root and yield response for a winter wheat in a field trial conducted in two neighbouring fields (B 3 and B 4) on a sandy loam. Plots were mechanically loosened to a depth of 35 cm in 1997 (B 3 and B 4) and again in 1998 (only B 4). Perennial grass/clover was grown with limited traffic intensity in 1998 - 1999 and 1999 - 2000 for B 3 and B 4, respectively. The perennial grass/clover was ploughed under in spring 2000 (B 3) and spring 2001 (B 4) and oats established. After harvest of oats, winter wheat was established. Recompaction treatments were applied to the mechanically loosened plots in 2000 and 2000 + 2001 for B 3 and B 4, respectively. On-land ploughing was compared with traditional mouldboard ploughing with the tractor wheels in the furrow. In addition, the loosened plots were either heavy trafficked (10 - 18 Mg axle load and ~ 200 kPa inflation pressure) or light trafficked (< 6 Mg axle load and < 100 kPa inflation pressure). The loosened treatments were referenced by plots where the <b>plough</b> <b>pan</b> had not been mechanically loosened (CONV). Root growth of winter wheat was followed during both growing seasons applying the minirhizotron technique. In 2002 these measurements were supplemented with core sampling at around anthesis (June 11). Soil water content was followed during the 2002 growing season using time domain reflectometry (TDR). Grain yield and nitrogen content in grain were determined both years. An adjoining study showed that the combination of heavy traffic and traditional ploughing (NINV-TH) caused strong recompaction of loosened soil whereas the combination of light traffic and on-land ploughing produced moderate recompaction. This study showed that the NINV-TH treatment produced 7 % lower yield than in the NINV-OL treatment in 2002, whereas no clear effect on crop yield was found in 2001. The NINV-TH and NINV-OL treatments showed mixed effect on root growth. Surprisingly, the non-loosened CONV treatment performed similar or even better than the NINV-OL treatment. The CONV treatment facilitated higher root intensity at depth and produced similar yield and N-uptake. The good performance of the CONV soil may be related to detrimental effects of subsoil loosening on rootability, favourable water supply in both experimental seasons, and improvements of the CONV <b>plough</b> <b>pan</b> structure through biological tillage during the experimental years. Our results suggest that mechanical subsoil loosening of humid sandy loams only is recommendable in case of very severe subsoil compaction. Natural alleviation of subsoil structure induced by changes in soil management may comprise a favourable alternative to mechanical subsoil loosening...|$|E

40|$|Compaction of arable soils is a {{consequence}} of tillage systems and agricultural machinery traffic year after year. Its negative effects on crop production and on the environment have been put into evidence by several studies. However, soil compaction is a complex phenomenon and the understanding of the involved mechanisms related to agricultural practices still remains limited. This contribution aims to study the influence of the interaction between traffic intensity and tillage system on soil compaction. Soil samples were taken from topsoil (0. 07 - 0. 25 m), <b>plough</b> <b>pan</b> (0. 30 - 0. 35 m) and subsoil (0. 35 – 0. 52 m), on plots under long-term reduced tillage (RT) and conventional tillage (CT). For each tillage system, intensive traffic zones (IT) and non-intensive traffic zones (NT) were considered. Swelling index (Cs), compression index (Cc), precompression stress (Pc) obtained by oedometer test, porosity (n) and water content obtained by gravimetric determination were chosen to characterise the soil mechanical properties. An analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was performed to study the effect of the depth, the tillage and the traffic intensity on the variables measured, with the water content as covariable. The results show that, after ten years of reconversion from CT to RT, the <b>plough</b> <b>pan</b> is still present in RT and its compaction appears as important as in CT (nRT- 30 cm = 36. 9 %, nCT- 30 cm = 38. 0 %, p-value = 0. 098). In subsoil, the compression index was high in CT, as well as in RT (CcRT = 0. 150 kPa- 1, CcCT = 0. 148 kPa- 1, p-value = 0. 617), involving that this layer remains susceptible to compaction under heavy loads. Moreover, the mean value of the precompression stress (meanPc = 92 ± 34 kPa) remains lower than stresses induced by heavy machines such as beet harvesters. The results also show that the presence of two traffic zones induces a spatial heterogeneity in the field (CcIT = 0. 138 kPa- 1; CcNT = 0. 154 kPa- 1, p-value = 0. 031). These main results could be used in computational modelling to develop decision support systems to mitigate the effects of soil compaction...|$|E

Although many studies on soil surface processes or flow patterns in soils exist, works relating both are rare in literature.

Our results show that storage was larger on the tilled and compacted plot than on the non-tilled one. After tillage, transport processes above the <b>plough</b> <b>pan</b> were partly disconnected from those underneath because macropores were disrupted and buried by the tillage operation. However, preferential flow along cracks occurred on both plots and the macropores buried below the tillage pan still functioned as preferential flow paths.

Soil microstructure observations indicated the strong development of a granular microstructure with large amounts of void space and a high fractal dimension in both surface and subsoil horizons of UFs. Dry yield had a strong correlation with ESD thickness and fractal dimension of voids. Thus, the management of unfertilised cultivation promoted the development of soil aggregation in both A and B horizons. The increase in ESD, soil pore spaces and complexity with the development of subsoil structure improved the productivity of unfertilised cultivation...|$|E

Cone index, bulk density, infiltration rate, root length, plant height, stem diameter, sunflower head diameter, seed yield, thousand seed mass, plant dry mass and oil content were measured. The results indicated that bulk density and cone index values were not statistically different while water infiltration rate values in subsoiled land were significantly higher than those of unsubsoiled land. It was also found that subsoiling did not affect sunflower yield, so from economical standpoint it is not recommended to use it in irrigated sunflower production in the area studied.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Rice paddies {{are highly}} {{important}} agricultural soils {{in view of}} their relevance as major staple food provider {{in the world and}} their key role in the global carbon cycle, caused by special management practices. A soil chronosequence, con-sisting of paddy and upland soils, developed on reclaimed estuarine sediments in the Province of Zhejiang, China, was sam-pled to investigate the influence of duration of agricultural use (50 to 2000 yr) on soil composition. The uniform composition of the parent material provides the unique opportunity to compare the effects of different land management practices (paddy and non-paddy) on soil carbon dynamics and the origin of organic carbon (OC) in top- and subsoils, using 14 C measurements by accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS). The total soil organic carbon (TOC) was split into chemically defined pools of dif-ferent mobility, namely the acid- and water-soluble fulvic acids (FA), the alkali-soluble humic acids (HA), and insoluble humin fraction. The more mobile HA and FA fractions contain significantly more 14 C than the corresponding TOC and humin, indicating a downward transport of OC in the subsoil. Plant roots with 14 C concentrations up to 128 % of the modern standard, found far below the <b>plough</b> <b>pan,</b> reveal plant roots and root exudates as other direct sources of subsoil OC in paddy soils...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} subsoil {{loosening}} to c. 35 cm depth was studied in an organic crop rotation experiment at Flakkebjerg (sandy loam) and Foulum (loamy sand). In {{each of the}} years 2000 - 2003 half of 4 plots per site was loosened in the autumn in a young grass-clover. Penetration resistance was recorded yearly. Detailed soil physical properties were determined for the Foulum site in 2003. Aboveground winter wheat growth was followed during the 2002 / 03 growing season using spectral reflectance measurements. Root growth was followed during the 2002 / 03 growing season at Foulum using the minirhizotron technique. Crop yield was determined every year in all treated plots. The Paraplow treatment effectively loosened the <b>plough</b> <b>pan.</b> Loosening in the grass-clover crop resulted in reduced growth. Apparently, this unintended effect of loosening had marked effects on {{the growth of the}} succeeding winter wheat crop. In wet years, yields were lowest in loosened and unmanured soil. In a dry year, loosening resulted in increased yield at Flakkebjerg. This appears to be an effect of the grass-clover crop that interferes with the results of loosening. Generally, our results suggest that under Danish conditions subsoil loosening can only be recommended in case of very severe subsoil compaction. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{contents}} and properties of soil organic phosphorus (Po) largely drive ecosystem productivity with increasing development of natural soil. We hypothesized that soil Po would initially increase with paddy management and then would persist under steady-state conditions. We analyzed soils from a 2000 -year chronosequence of a rice-wheat rotation and an adjacent non-paddy 700 -year chronosequence in Bay of Hangzhou (China) for their Po composition using solution 31 P-NMR after NaOH-EDTA extraction. Land reclamation promoted Po accumulation in both paddy and non-paddy topsoils (depths[*]≤[*] 18 [*]cm) until steady-state equilibria were reached within 200 years of land use. Greater Po concentrations were found, however, in the non-paddy subsoils {{than in those}} under paddy management. Apparently, {{the formation of a}} dense paddy <b>plough</b> <b>pan</b> hindered long-term Po accumulation in the paddy subsoil. The surface soils showed higher proportions of orthophosphate diesters under paddy than under non-paddy management, likely reflecting suppressed decomposition of crop residues despite elevated microbial P compounds stocks under anaerobic paddy-rice management. Intriguingly, the composition of Po was remarkably stable after 194 -years of paddy management and 144 -years of non-paddy management, suggesting novel steady-state equilibria of P dynamics had been reached in these man-made ecosystems after less than two centuries...|$|E
40|$|In the Eastern {{states of}} Germany, {{there are many}} arable soils which have been {{compacted}} and overconsolidated {{as a result of}} intensive wheeling. These require mechanical loosening in order to improve the structure of the deeper layers of these originally very fertile soils. Repeated wheeling of highly-overconsolidated soils results in a further stress distribution to greater soil depths, because the hard <b>plough</b> <b>pan</b> layer serves as an elastic pressure plate provided that the deeper soil horizons are not strong enough to carry the load applied. Furthermore, the types of stresses induced during wheeling differ depending on the original soil strength and the number of loading events. The slit-ploughed soil volume is subjected to further changes of the pore system and of the soil strength induced by shear stresses, because during wheeling additional soil material is pressed in the weaker slit-ploughed soil volume. The hydraulic properties also change very significantly. In order to preserve the improved soil conditions, two further aspects have to be considered: 1. Wheeling should be carried out only at right angles to the slits which has the benefit of using the adjacent, stronger, unslotted soil to attenuate the stresses applied. 2. Under drier soil conditions, slotted soils can be wheeled. Wheeling must be avoided if the soil is moist in order to prevent the re loosened soil volume from additional soil compaction due to slip-induced transport of adjacent, previously-undisturbed soil into the slit itself...|$|E
40|$|Continuous {{paddy rice}} {{cultivation}} requires fields to be flooded {{most of the}} time limiting seriously the collection of detailed soil information. So far, no appropriate soil sensor technology for identifying soil variability of flooded fields has been reported. Therefore, the primary objective was the development of a sensing system that can float, acquire and process detailed geo-referenced soil information within flooded fields. An additional objective was to determine whether the collected apparent electrical conductivity (ECa) information could be used to support soil management at a within-field level. A floating sensing system (FloSSy) was built to record ECa using the electromagnetic induction sensor EM 38, which does not require physical contact with the soil. Its feasibility was tested in an alluvial paddy field of 2. 7 ha located in the Brahmaputra floodplain of Bangladesh. The high-resolution (1 x 1 m) ECa data were classified into three classes using the fuzzy k-means classification method. The variation among the classes could be attributed to differences in subsoil (0. 15 - 0. 30 m below soil surface) bulk density, with the smallest ECa values representing the lowest bulk density. This effect was attributed to differences in compaction of the <b>plough</b> <b>pan</b> due to differential puddling. There was also a significant difference in rice yield among the ECa classes, with the smallest ECa values representing the lowest yield. It was concluded that the floating sensing system allowed the collection of relevant soil information, opening potential for precision agriculture practices in flooded crop fields...|$|E
40|$|In two {{long-term}} experiments (started in 1978) on day loam soils {{each with}} four randomized blocks, four different ploughing depths had been compared during a fifteen year period on sites previously ploughed {{to a depth}} of ab out 25 cm. During the whole experimental period, fertilizing, crop residue management and other treatments had been equal for all ploughing depths. Deep ploughing had resulted in a few percent higher accumulated yields than shallow ploughing, probably because of higher weed infestation (Elymus repens, (L.) Gould) for shallow ploughing. In two treatments (mouldboard ploughing to about 31 cm and 16 cm) an investigation was made in 1993 on bulk soil properties and penetration resistance and on concentration and total amount of organic matter and nitrogen. Depending on the ploughing depth used, sampling was done in two layers for deep ploughing and three layers for shallow ploughing. The first layer from the ground surface to present ploughing depth and the second layer (shallow ploughing) from present to previous ploughing depth. The bottom layer is a shallow transition layer between topsoil and subsoil. Bulk density and degree of compactness were higher and porosity lower in deeper layers. There was a <b>plough</b> <b>pan</b> in both treatments but at different depths. Total amount of organic matter in the soil was equal for both treatments, but the vertical distribution of organic matter differed between the ploughing depths. The concentration of organic matter was about 0. 5 % higher in the upper layer in shallow ploughing than in deep ploughing...|$|E
40|$|Organic wastes {{addition}} may {{impact the}} pesticide behaviour in soils. Furthermore {{the incorporation of}} crop residues or organic amendments by ploughing can induce a heterogeneous spatial distribution of the added organic matter in the tilled layer. Spatial and temporal heterogeneity of soil microorganisms and isoproturon biodegradation was investigated at the decimetric scale {{in relation to the}} spatial distribution of organic matter originating from urban waste composts from 1 to 19 months after their incorporation through ploughing. We compared one control plot without compost addition and two plots receiving either municipal solid waste (MSW) compost or green waste co-composted with sewage sludge (SGW) every two years. According to morphological description, the ploughed layer was divided into four zones: the interfurrows, containing important quantities of fresh organic matter, the <b>plough</b> <b>pan</b> and two types of clods, the D clods (with no visible structural porosity) and the G clods (with visible macropores). Total organic carbon (C) and microbial and fungal biomasses were measured on homogeneous samples taken from each zone. Total C and isoproturon mineralization were monitored for two months at 2 sampling dates. At the end of incubation, samples were extracted to evaluate the nature and availability of isoproturon residues. The results showed that interfurrows constituted a special local environment with the highest level of microbial biomass and the highest isoproturon mineralizing capacities and respiration levels. The presence of compost in the interfurrows stimulated isoproturon biodegradation relative to controls. This effect was more pronounced for the MSW compost than for the SGW compost. Heterogeneity may persist several months after compost or stubble hiding depending on the nature of added organic matter...|$|E
40|$|In Belgium, growing {{silage maize}} in a {{monoculture}} {{often results in}} increased soil compaction. The aim of our research was to quantify {{the effects of this}} soil compaction on the dry matter (DM) yields and the nitrogen use of silage maize (Zea mays L.). On a sandy loam soil of the experimental site of Ghent University (Belgium), silage maize was grown on plots with traditional soil tillage (T), on artificially compacted plots (C) and on subsoiled plots (S). The artificial compaction, induced by multiple wheel-to-wheet passages with a tractor, increased the soil penetration resistance up to more than 1. 5 MPa in the zone of 0 - 35 cm of soil depth. Subsoiling broke an existing <b>plough</b> <b>pan</b> (at 35 - 45 cm of soil depth). During the growing season, the release of soil mineral nitrogen by mineralisation was substantially lower on the C plots than on the T and S plots. Silage maize plants on the compacted soil were smaller and flowering was delayed. The induced soil compaction caused a DM yield loss of 2. 37 Mg ha(- 1) (- 13. 2 %) and decreased N uptake by 46. 2 kg ha(- 1) (- 23. 2 %) compared to the T plots. Maize plants on compacted soil had a lower, suboptimal nitrogen content. Compared with the traditional soil tillage that avoided heavy compaction, subsoiling offered no significant benefits for the silage maize crop. It was concluded that avoiding heavy soil compaction in silage maize is a major strategy for maintaining crop yields and for enhancing N use efficiency. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B. V.

40|$|Spatial {{variability}} of soil structure complicates interpretation of investigations on soil physical properties and {{their influence on}} crop growth. Especially, for pleistocene sandy and sandy-loamy soils, small scale heterogeneity and the range over which observations give reliable estimates {{on the state of}} soil properties have to be considered. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the variability structure of various soil physical and morphological parameter in a field soil. In an Albic Luvisol under conventional tillage located in Miincheberg, Germany, numbers and pore area fraction of macropores > 200 |im were determined for samples taken from the topsoil layer (15 cm average soil depth), a layer compacted by wheel traffic (30 cm) and the subsoil (55 cm). For macropore determinations polished blocks of soil samples were used, stabilized with polyester resin (stained by fluoresceine). In the same layers, soil texture, saturated hydraulic conductivity, air permeability, dry bulk density and rootability were investigated for samples from 25 profiles in a 4 ha block within a 60 ha field. In the subsoil, clay content, total carbon content, dry bulk density and rootability were autocorrelated over a distance of about 25 to 50 m. Whereas soil structural parameters, such as numbers and area of macropores as well as permeability properties varied randomly even over the shortest distance sampled (10 cm). For the topsoil and the <b>plough</b> <b>pan,</b> variability appeared to be unstructured in case of hydraulic conductivity, air permeability, dry bulk density, rootability and number and area of macropores. Considering the short distances between the sample cores (10 cm) taken in the same soil profile, structural variation was identified in the topsoil...|$|E
40|$|Compacted subsoil {{may reduce}} root growth with {{resulting}} effects on plant uptake {{of water and}} nutrients. In organic farming systems subsoil loosening may therefore be considered an option to increase nutrient use efficiencies. We investigated the effect of subsoil loosening with a Paraplow to c. 35 cm depth in an organic farming experiment at Foulum (loamy sand) and Flakkebjerg (sandy loam) in Denmark. In each of the years 2000 to 2004 one half of four plots per site were loosened in the autumn in a young grass-clover crop established by undersowing in spring barley. The grass-clover was grown for {{a year as a}} green manure crop and followed by winter wheat, lupin:barley and spring barley in the following three years. On-land ploughing was used for all these crops. Penetration resistance was recorded in all crops, and the results clearly showed that subsoil looseling had effectively reduced the <b>plough</b> <b>pan</b> and that the effect lasted at least 3. 5 years. Measurements of root growth at Foulum in 2002 / 03 did not show marked effects of subsoil loosening on root density in the subsoil. Subsoil loosening resulted in reduced growth and less biological nitrogen (N) fixation of grass-clover crop in which the subsoil loosening was carried out. This had a marked effect on the growth of the succeeding winter wheat. Negative effects of subsoil loosening on the yield of winter wheat was observed without manure application and in years with high winter rainfall, whereas small positive yield effects of subsoil loosening was observed in crops with a good N supply. There were no marked effects of subsoiling on yield of the spring sown crops, although subsoiling had a tendency to increase crop growth and yield of spring cereals and pulses during dry summers. The results suggest that subsoil loosening can only be recommended under Danish conditions in case of severe subsoil compaction...|$|E
40|$|Straw {{residues}} may be {{accumulated in}} isolated zones in the plough layer after mouldboard ploughing. This may limit straw decomposition because of limited nitrogen availability {{depending on the}} prevalent water flow pathways induced by tillage. In this study, we used the food dye Brilliant Blue FCF (Color Index 42090) to make visible the flow pathways in the plough layer of a loamy soil after incorporation of 10 tonne of dry mass ha(- 1), {{and to get a}} qualitative and quantitative interpretation of the small-scale flow behaviour. Approximately 1. 3 L of a 4 g L- 1 Brilliant Blue solution was applied at a matric head of - 1 cm with an infiltrometer, equipped with a 25 cm-diameter disk. Horizontal cross-sections of 50 x 50 cm were photographed at 1. 5 to 3. 5 cm depth intervals. High-resolution spatial maps of Brilliant Blue concentration were derived from the scanned photographs, using separate calibration relationships between the measured Brilliant Blue concentrations and the color spectra and depth for the soil and the straw. Pronounced lateral dye movement was observed through the soil matrix owing to soil sorptivity. In cases of high sorptivity, the dye barely reached the depth of straw incorporation. Otherwise, enhanced preferential dye transport directed towards the incorporated straw was made visible and the stained water eventually ponded on the <b>plough</b> <b>pan</b> which induced lateral redistribution. Although the straw inclusions contributed to dye transport, they did not retain a substantial part of the applied dye mass, owing to the low density and surface area of straw. However, these inclusions may enhance the fast migration of potential pollutants such as nitrate or pesticides out of the tilled layer where much of the transformation occurs due to biological activity.

40|$|Many {{strategies}} {{exist to}} combat soil degradation through erosion and compaction on agricultural fields. One {{of these strategies}} is conservation agriculture (CA). Reduced or zero tillage techniques, together with crop residue management and crop rotation are the pillars of CA. The term reduced tillage covers a range of tillage practices but it never involves inverting the soil. In this way, soil disturbance is minimised and crop residues are left on the soil. Studies in many European countries have shown that CA can indeed be very effective in combating soil erosion. However, to practice sustainable soil management and as such ensure good soil functioning on the long term, {{one has to be}} aware of the effect of the used tillage method on different soil properties. Tillage techniques with negative effects on soil functioning are to be avoided. We present a study that investigates the effect of CA on different soil properties of agricultural loam soils in Belgium. We analyzed the effect of CA on water content, bulk density, penetration resistance, organic carbon and nitrate content of the soil. On the same experimental plots, the effect of CA on crop growth and root abundance was analyzed. Differences between conventional mouldboard ploughing and CA tended to be very small when the soil was tilled at the same depth as ploughing. Long time superficial reduced tillage increased soil penetration resistance in the upper soil layers. Deep reduced tillage was found to be able to break a <b>plough</b> <b>pan.</b> Importantly, nitrate content after harvest was found to be higher for ploughed soils, indicating that CA does not result in higher nitrate leakage. We conclude that, on the Belgian loam soils, CA can be practiced whereby good soil functioning can be ensured. As crop yields were also similar, CA is an economically viable alternative that may contribute to soil protection. However the availability of local expertise and know-how are important to ensure good practicestatus: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The food dye Brilliant Blue FCF (Color Index 42090) {{is often}} used as dye tracer in field studies for {{visualizing}} the flow pathways of water in soils. Batch studies confirmed findings of other researchers that non-linear sorption is important for Brilliant Blue, especially at small concentrations (< 10 g l(- 1) for our soil), and that retardation increases with decreasing concentrations {{as well as with}} increasing ionic strength of solutions. Therefore, it is not obvious if it can be used as an indicator for water flow paths as is often done. In this study, we compared the mobility of Brilliant Blue in a field soil (gleyic Luvisol) with that of bromide. Brilliant Blue and potassium bromide were simultaneously applied as a 6 -mm pulse on a small plot in the field, and the tracers were displaced with 89 mm of tracer-free water using a constant intensity of 3. 9 +/- 0. 2 mm hour(- 1). Both tracer concentrations were determined on 144 soil cores taken from a 1 m x 1 m vertical soil profile. The transport behaviour differed in both (i) mean displacement and (ii) spatial concentration pattern. We found the retardation of Brilliant Blue could not be neglected and, in contrast to the bromide pattern, a pulse splitting was observed at the <b>plough</b> <b>pan.</b> Numerical simulations with a particle tracking code revealed that the one-dimensional concentration profile of bromide was represented fairly well by the model, but the prediction of the double peak in the Brilliant Blue concentration profile failed. With additional assumptions, there were indications that Brilliant Blue does not follow the same flow paths as bromide. However, the question of Brilliant Blue taking the same flow pathways as bromide cannot be adequately answered by comparing both concentration distributions, because we look at two different transport distances due to the retardation of Brilliant Blue. It became obvious, however, that Brilliant Blue is not a suitable compound for tracing the travel time of water itself...|$|E
