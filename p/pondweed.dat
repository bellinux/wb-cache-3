5|$|Numerous rare or {{endangered}} {{plant species}} have been observed {{in the vicinity of}} Harveys Lake. Plants {{in the vicinity of the}} lake include Vasey's <b>pondweed,</b> flat-leaved <b>pondweed,</b> grassy <b>pondweed,</b> broad-leaved water-milfoil, and Beck's water-marigold. However, exotic and invasive plants such as fanwort and aquatic coontail also inhabit the area and have altered the habitat in the vicinity of the lake. Second-growth forests occur in the area surrounding the lake.|$|E
5|$|The lake is {{surrounded}} with fringing reedbeds, carr woodland and grassland, which are managed by Bristol Water. The water conditions are eutrophic with run off from local fields and streams. Open-water plant communities are rather sparse, largely comprising fennel <b>pondweed</b> (Potamogeton pectinatus), lesser <b>pondweed</b> (Potamogeton pusillus), opposite-leaved <b>pondweed</b> (Groenlandia densa) and water-crowfoot (Ranunculus spp.). On neutral soils around the reservoir, pepper-saxifrage (Silaum silaus), burnet-saxifrage (Pimpinella saxifraga) and devil's-bit scabious (Succisa pratensis) occur, and on calcareous soils fairy flax (Linum catharticum), dwarf thistle (Cirsium acaule) and salad burnet (Sanguisorba minor subspecies minor) are found.|$|E
5|$|Main pond, dug in 1986, with {{seasonally}} fluctuating water levels. Most vegetation has colonised naturally, with {{among others}} common reed, purple loosestrife, yellow iris, water-plantain, water figwort, soft rush, gypsywort, water starwort, curled <b>pondweed,</b> common duckweed, water forget-me-not, water mint, brooklime.|$|E
50|$|The larvae are aquatic {{and feed}} on various <b>pondweeds.</b>|$|R
50|$|Like {{most other}} {{broad-leaved}} <b>pondweeds,</b> Potamogeton lucens is tetraploid, with 2n=52.|$|R
25|$|Chromosome counts show that, {{like most}} other {{broad-leaved}} <b>pondweeds,</b> P. alpinus is tetraploid, with 2n=52 chromosomes.|$|R
5|$|The {{reservoir}} {{is listed}} as a Site of Nature Conservation Interest (SNCI) as it has <b>pondweed</b> and stonewort, and common toads breed there. The grassland and scrub surrounding the reservoir is also an SNCI due to the grass snakes and slowworms there.|$|E
5|$|The {{river is}} {{important}} for its dragonfly communities, with a strong population of Scarce Chaser (found in only six other areas in England), together with a strong population of White-legged Damselfly. Red-eyed Damselfly is also found. The river is also important for aquatic plants, including Loddon <b>Pondweed.</b>|$|E
5|$|The American {{black duck}} is an {{omnivorous}} species with a diverse diet. It feeds by dabbling {{in shallow water}} and grazing on land. Its plant diet primarily includes {{a wide variety of}} wetland grasses and sedges, and the seeds, stems, leaves and root stalks of aquatic plants, such as eelgrass, <b>pondweed</b> and smartweed. Its animal diet includes mollusks, snails, amphipods, insects, mussels and small fishes.|$|E
5000|$|... six {{communities}} in which rooted water-lilies and <b>pondweeds</b> with floating leaves are the constant species (A7, A8, A9, A10, A19 and A20) ...|$|R
50|$|The main {{difference}} between this species and other <b>pondweeds</b> is a discoloured flexible joint just below {{the top of the}} long leaf stalk.|$|R
50|$|Potamogeton gramineus is not {{in general}} cultivation, though it is an {{attractive}} plant and grows well in a garden pond or barrel. Its slower growth than most submerged species, attractive leaves and habit of producing {{a limited number of}} floating leaves make it very ornamental and suitable for garden ponds, and its smaller size than many other <b>pondweeds</b> is also a benefit. In common with other <b>pondweeds</b> of this group it roots poorly from stem cuttings and is best propagated by division of the rhizomes.|$|R
25|$|Potamogeton alpinus is {{a species}} of {{perennial}} aquatic plant known by the common names alpine <b>pondweed</b> and red <b>pondweed.</b> It is widespread in the northern hemisphere in both rivers and lakes with good water quality.|$|E
25|$|Potamogeton praelongus, {{commonly}} known as whitestem <b>pondweed</b> in North America and Long-stalked <b>Pondweed</b> in Britain, The specific epithet means 'very long'. It is not a particularly variable species and consequently there are few synonyms.|$|E
25|$|Like {{most other}} broadleaved pondweeds, {{perfoliate}} <b>pondweed</b> is tetraploid, with 2n=52.|$|E
5000|$|Although quite variable, P. crispus {{is usually}} a {{straightforward}} plant to identify. Hybrids with various other <b>pondweeds</b> are recorded, but these do not usually closely resemble P. crispus.|$|R
50|$|The main {{difference}} from other narrow-leaved <b>pondweeds</b> {{is that the}} stipule joins the leaf base, when it is pulled the sheath and stipule comes away, similar to a grass sheath and ligule.|$|R
25|$|Like {{many other}} <b>pondweeds,</b> the {{variability}} in growth form of P. alpinus in response to environmental conditions (phenotypic plasticity) and across its geographical range has led to it accumulating a number of synonyms.|$|R
25|$|Over {{much of its}} range, {{perfoliate}} <b>pondweed</b> {{is unlikely}} to be confused with any other <b>pondweed</b> species except perhaps P. praelongus. In North America it could be confused with P. richardsonii, but the latter has stipules that disintegrate to persistent fibres even on {{the lower part of the}} stem, whereas those of P. perfoliatus disintegrate entirely.|$|E
25|$|Waterbirds, fish, water beetles and caddis larvae {{can all be}} {{important}} grazers of perfoliate <b>pondweed,</b> reducing its biomass or even eliminating it locally.|$|E
25|$|DNA {{analysis}} {{indicates that}} P. perfoliatus {{is one of}} the broad-leaved <b>pondweed</b> clade (section Potamogeton) and is probably most closely related to P. richardsonii.|$|E
50|$|Fourteen {{species of}} aquatic macrophytes were {{identified}} by Alberta Environment during a 1984 survey of Driedmeat Lake. The most abundant plants were <b>pondweeds</b> (Potamogeton richardsonii, P. vaginatus and P. pectinatus) and coontail (Ceratophyllum demersum).|$|R
50|$|Floating-leaved macrophytes have {{root system}} {{attached}} to the substrates or bottom {{of the lake and}} stream and with leaves that float on the water surface. Common floating leaves macrophytes are water lilies (family Nymphaeaceae), <b>pondweeds</b> (family Potamogetonaceae).|$|R
50|$|DNA {{analysis}} indicates that, {{despite the}} presence of floating leaves P. epihydrus is closely related to P. tennesseensis. These two are within the basal part of the large clade of fine-leaved <b>pondweeds</b> including P. diversifolius, P. pusillus and P. compressus.|$|R
25|$|Although it is {{possible}} to grow perfoliate <b>pondweed</b> in fish ponds, it would be vulnerable to fish predation initially, so should be protected during establishment.|$|E
25|$|Beavers are herbivores, and {{prefer the}} wood of quaking aspen, cottonwood, willow, alder, birch, maple and cherry trees. They also eat sedges, <b>pondweed,</b> and water lilies.|$|E
25|$|Potamogeton alpinus {{generally}} {{grows in}} neutral to mildly acid (but not very base-poor) water bodies such as lakes, slow-moving rivers and streams, and ponds. P. alpinus needs a deep fine substrate such as sand, silt or peat to root in {{and appears to}} avoid exposed situations. It is, mainly restricted to fairly nutrient-poor waters. In European rivers, it is associated with high quality environments. In a large-scale study of the plant communities of 3447 British lakes, red <b>pondweed</b> was found in 169, with a preference for circumneutral, moderate alkalinity lakes. Unlike other broad-leaved pondweeds, the stolons of red <b>pondweed</b> die back in winter, leaving constellations of resting buds rooted in the substrate, which regrow in spring. In rivers, red <b>pondweed</b> can persist entirely by asexual means (rooting of stem fragments and turion-like resting bodies, and growth in summer) though this may reflect weed cutting suppressing flowering and seed set.|$|E
50|$|In {{common with}} other <b>pondweeds</b> {{of this group}} it roots poorly from stem {{cuttings}} and is best propagated by division of the rhizomes. Good water quality is needed {{to reduce the risk}} of turbid water or growth of blanket weed.|$|R
25|$|P. praelongus is not {{in general}} cultivation, though it is an {{attractive}} plant. Unlike many other <b>pondweeds</b> it remains wintergreen. In common with other <b>pondweeds</b> of this group it roots poorly from stem cuttings and is best propagated by division of the rhizomes. Its preference for relatively deep water and intolerance of turbid conditions may make it unsuitable for many garden ponds. If possible it should be grown in water at least 70cm deep on a sandy, peaty or silty substrate. Good water quality is needed {{to reduce the risk}} of turbid water or growth of blanket weed. Seed can be encouraged to germinate by immersing dried seed in water for at least a month, exposing them to a cold period, or by scarifying them.|$|R
50|$|Most common {{phytoplankton}} {{species are}} filamentous cyanobacteria and diatoms, while zooplankton {{are represented by}} daphnia and copepods. Common aquatic plants {{in the water column}} include rigid hornwort and yellow water-lily coupled with a presence of Nuttall's waterweed, frogbit, common duckweed, white waterlily, amphibious bistort, and four species of <b>pondweeds.</b>|$|R
25|$|Potamogeton polygonifolius or bog <b>pondweed,</b> is an aquatic plant. It {{is found}} in shallow, nutrient-poor, usually acid {{standing}} or running water, bogs, fens and occasionally ditches.|$|E
25|$|Red <b>pondweed</b> {{is one of}} the {{so-called}} Magnopotamion group of pondweeds. These are a characteristic floristic component of the protected Habitats Directive habitat Type 'Natural eutrophic lakes with Magnopotamion.|$|E
25|$|Red <b>pondweed</b> is a {{reasonably}} distinctive plant {{and is not}} likely to be confused with any other <b>pondweed.</b> Early in the growing season it could be confused with P. polygonifolius, but the submerged leaves of the latter have petioles and are relatively longer. P. praelongus is generally greener with noticeably white, zig-zagged stems that generally branch, never produces floating leaves, and its submerged leaves clasp the stem. Fresh specimens often, but not always, show a reddish tint, but this becomes much more obvious in dried material. Despite its name it is neither restricted to alpine regions or unique among pondweeds in having a reddish colouration.|$|E
50|$|The {{relatively}} small area of open water {{is dominated by}} floating <b>pondweeds</b> (Potamogeton sps), and has some water lilies Nuphar lutea. The Common Hawker or Sedge Darner (Aeshna juncea) breeds at the site. An extensive woodland of willow and birch extends towards Lowhouse Farmlands. Extensive areas of rushes (Juncus sps) are present.|$|R
50|$|Green-winged teal, {{more than}} any other species of duck, prefer to seek food on mud flats. Where mud flats are lacking, they prefer shallow marshes or {{temporarily}} flooded agricultural lands. They usually eat vegetative matter consisting of seeds, stems, and leaves of aquatic and emergent vegetation. Green-winged teal appear to prefer the small seeds of nutgrasses (Cyperus spp.), millets (Panicum spp.), and sedges to larger seeds, but they also consume corn, wheat, barley, and buttonbush (Cephalanthus spp.) seeds. In marshes, sloughs, and ponds, green-winged teal select the seeds of bulrushes, <b>pondweeds,</b> and spikerushes (Eleocharis spp.). To a lesser extent they feed upon the vegetative parts of muskgrass (Chara spp.), <b>pondweeds,</b> widgeongrass (Ruppia maritima), and duckweeds (Lemna spp.). They will occasionally eat insects, mollusks, and crustaceans. Occasionally during spring months, green-winged teal will gorge on maggots of decaying fish which are found around ponds.|$|R
50|$|Aquatic {{vegetation}} {{is quite}} sparse {{in most areas}} of Mashapaug Lake, except in certain areas of shallow water; although recently, infrequent lowering of the lake during the wintertime has increased shoreline aquatic vegetation. Some plants {{that can be found}} in the shallows are yellow pond-lily (Nuphar variegata), pickerel weed (Pontederia cordata), and <b>pondweeds</b> (Potamogeton spp.).|$|R
