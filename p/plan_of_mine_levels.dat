50|$|Mine {{reclamation}} is {{the process}} of restoring land that has been mined to a natural or economically usable state. Although the process <b>of</b> <b>mine</b> reclamation occurs once mining is completed, the <b>planning</b> <b>of</b> <b>mine</b> reclamation activities occurs prior to a mine being permitted or started. Mine reclamation creates useful landscapes that meet a variety of goals ranging from the restoration of productive ecosystems to the creation of industrial and municipal resources. In the United States, mine reclamation is a regular part <b>of</b> modern <b>mining</b> practices. Modern mine reclamation minimizes and mitigates the environmental effects <b>of</b> <b>mining.</b>|$|R

40|$|After closure <b>of</b> {{the last}} <b>mine</b> {{in the hard}} coal <b>mining</b> {{district}} <b>of</b> Aachen and South Limburg mine drainage was ceased in 1993 / 1994. The recovery <b>of</b> the <b>mine</b> water <b>level</b> covers a wide area of about 490 km² on german and dutch territory. The development <b>of</b> the <b>mine</b> water recovery in such a complex mining district with a <b>mining</b> history <b>of</b> over 800 years is influencend by interactions of many hydraulical und hydrogeological factors. Particulary relevant factors are the hydraulic connections between the different mines and the interactions between carboniferous base rock and the overlying cap rock of cretaceous and tertiary age. This dissertation documents the development <b>of</b> <b>mine</b> water recovery in the <b>mining</b> district <b>of</b> Aachen and South Limburg. The relevant geological-hydrogeological boundary conditions are compiled in an analogue model. On this basis at first the relevant hydrogeological factors and mining structures are identified and their changeability is described. Furthermore the impacts of the interactions between the mine and the cap rock on the velocity <b>of</b> <b>mine</b> water <b>level</b> rising, the development <b>of</b> <b>mine</b> water quality, {{the formation of a}} “soft water cap”, the migration <b>of</b> <b>mine</b> gas, the development of ground movements as well as the change of hydraulic heads und water quality in the cap rock are shown. The hydrogeolocial and hydraulical processes described in this dissertation mostly are of fundamental character and therefore applicable to other hard coal mining districts. Knowledge about the described interdependencies are of fundamental significance for the compilation and assessment <b>of</b> predictions about <b>mine</b> water recovery. Furthermore this knowledge is of some importance for the compilation of an optimized monitoring system, that is able to detect the significant impacts <b>of</b> <b>mine</b> water <b>level</b> rising on groundwaterbodies, receiving streams and the ground surface in other hard coal mining districts as well...|$|R

In the case of oil production, data on oil yield and potential resources in oil shale are the most important figures to determine the value of the deposit.
