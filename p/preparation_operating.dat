The result of a backside approach in analysing a 0. 13 µm chip is also presented. Practical limits for this analysis in terms of sample <b>preparation,</b> <b>operating</b> conditions and chip technology are also discussed. Optical emission analysis {{can be used for}} partial reverse engineering of the chip structure by spotting the active areas.

Nevertheless, in extreme hard working conditions of the tribological systems (high pressures, velocities and temperatures, temporary lubricating lack during starting) the machine elements are not secured enough. Consequently the idea to introduce the additional substance- <b>operating</b> <b>preparation</b> into tribological systems (with the lubricating oils) appeared a few years ago. Owing to that, the lubricating oils with better antiwear and antiseizure properties are obtained. The boundary layers created on cooperating elements surfaces are able to carry bigger load and also friction resistance and wear of these elements decrease. The paper presents literature review concerning the <b>operating</b> <b>preparations</b> used in lubricating oils. Different opinions about <b>operating</b> <b>preparations</b> functioning {{can be found in the}} professional literature- from harmfulness or weak effectiveness to good efficiency and big technical, economical and ecological meaning. In author’s opinion, in extreme working conditions of tribological systems the <b>operating</b> <b>preparations</b> (especially the chemical interaction preparations) ensure additional and effective protection of machine elements.

40|$|Theoretical {{outcomes}} The <b>preparation</b> of the <b>operating</b> {{field is}} an important part of all preoperative preparation. Preoperative preparation, before surgical intervention, cannot be neglected. In most cases, the doctor will not perform an operation without proper preoperative preparation. The only exception is urgent surgical intervention for which only the most basic preoperative preparation is provided. Preoperative preparation can be categorized as long-term, short-term, or immediate. A thorough and proper <b>preparation</b> of the <b>operating</b> field reduces any development of postoperative wound complications. The aim of thorough preoperative <b>preparation</b> of the <b>operating</b> field is to reduce any risk of developing postoperative wound complications. Postoperative care prevents postoperative complications. It is aimed at controlling the state of a patient's current health after surgical intervention, but also the surgical wound and its dressing. Both nurses and doctors are obliged to perform these controls. In the early postoperative period, the client stays in the ward or in the postoperative room. In the case of arising complications during surgical intervention, the client is moved to the ICU/ARO. The Aims of the Thesis The aim of the thesis is to map the differences in preoperative <b>preparation</b> of the <b>operating</b> field among surgery departments, and to find the differences between <b>preparation</b> in the <b>operating</b> field before a scheduled and an urgent surgical intervention. Furthermore, the aim is to find out if nurses perform preoperative and postoperative care properly. The following questions were chosen: What are the differences in preoperative <b>preparation</b> of the <b>operating</b> field among surgery departments? How do nurses perform preoperative and postoperative care of the operating field? Implemented methods In order to gain the desired information, a qualitative form of research was chosen, namely an in-depth interview method, a method of questioning, and an observational method. Observation was implemented using the hidden observation method. The respondents in the research were the nurses from the urology and the surgery departments at a hospital in Vysočina. Data collection was conducted from February to March, 2014. The acquired data was then analyzed through an open coding method. Results The subsequently transcribed interviews and observations were carefully analyzed using the 'pencil & paper' method and open coding. Eventually, five categories were created: preoperative preparation before a scheduled surgical intervention, preoperative preparation before an acute or urgent surgical intervention, <b>preparation</b> of the <b>operating</b> field, postoperative wound care, medical documentation. Conclusion The research suggests that nurses are well aware of the complete preoperative and postoperative care. What is, however, surprising is how adherence to the principles of barrier care and the client's intimity vary in the course of providing this care. The conclusions in this thesis should aim at an improvement of preoperative and postoperative care of a client and to eliminate any discovered shortcomings in the provided nursing care. The practical outcome of this thesis will be an article in a professional magazine for nurses...|$|R

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis thesis attempts {{to answer the}} question, Is War art of science? In doing so it draws heavily upon Thomas Kuhn's humanistic philosophy of science. If War can be separated theoretically into two distinct analytical units, preparation for war, and conduct of war, then {{the answer to the}} question becomes more accessible. The war preparation process is notably similar to the Kuhnian dynamic of scientific process, i. e., the evolution of a paradigm through inter-disciplinary criticism and rearticulation. A case study of post-WWII US nuclear strategy is offered to substantiate the claim that war <b>preparation</b> <b>operates</b> in a way that is remarkably similar to Kuhnian science. So, if war preparation is scientific, then the conduct of war, a fundamentally different activity, may be seen as artistic. This case is made by drawing heavily upon the writings of General Carl von Clausewitz, and the 18 th century German idealist Immanuel Kant. The end result of the work is to posit the existence of two types of men necessary for the execution of War, those who demonstrate ability in the sublime genius of science, and those who are more suited to develop the heroic genius of battle. The question then arises as pertains to the US military educational system's ability to identify these men and intensify their development within each's specific forte. US Navy (USN) autho...|$|R

40|$|When timing a fluent {{sequence}} of either movement or speech, {{evidence suggests that}} people consider {{the amount of time}} available during the production of a first unit to prepare a second unit, evident in a reverse length effect for response onset of the sequence (e. g., Griffin, 2003; Ketelaars, Garry, and Franks, 1997).

Participants named an object and manually traced a course to produce a fluent sequence. Duration of the first production was manipulated. If <b>preparation</b> modulation <b>operates</b> over speech and movement units within the same sequence, sequence onset will be earlier when the first unit is short in production duration as opposed to long.

30|$|A typical {{coal mine}} complex (underground mine shafts, drift portals and slopes and their {{associated}} coal <b>preparation</b> facilities) <b>operates</b> a closed loop water system. Although rainfall in Illinois greatly exceeds evaporation, a typical underground coal mine and associated preparation plan complex will often operate on net {{deficit of water}} {{during the course of}} a typical year. This is largely due to water lost during the mining process (dust suppression) and coal washing. Most water exits the facility either as evaporation water or surface moisture on the processed coal. To supplement their needs these operations add water from a fresh water impoundment or groundwater source. Periodic discharges (blow down) will occur typically from a single sedimentation control basin with an NPDES discharge. Often this blow down occurs during a period of high precipitation when waters with high TDS are acceptable. However, the primary need for blow down is to drain water that is detrimental to equipment operation.|$|R
