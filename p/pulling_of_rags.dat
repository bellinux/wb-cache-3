50|$|In 1788, the Chimney Sweepers Act 1788: An Act for the Better Regulation of Chimney Sweepers {{and their}} Apprentices was passed, to limit a sweeper to six apprentices, at least 8 years old, but lacked enforcement. It {{introduced}} the Apprenticeship Cap badge. The Act had been partially {{inspired by the}} interest in climbing boys shown by Jonas Hanway, and his two publications The State of Chimney Sweepers'Young Apprentices (1773) and later Sentimental History of Chimney Sweeps in London and Westminster (1785). He asserted that while Parliament was exercised with {{the abolition of slavery}} in the new world it was ignoring the slavery imposed on climbing boys. He looked to Edinburgh Scotland where sweeps were regulated by the police, climbing was not allowed and chimneys were swept by the Master Sweep himself <b>pulling</b> bundles <b>of</b> <b>rags</b> up and down the chimney. He did not see how climbing chimneys could be considered a valid apprenticeship, as the only skill obtained was that of climbing chimneys which did not lead to future employment. Hanway advocated that Christianity should be brought into the boys' lives and lobbied for Sunday Schools for the boys. The Lords removed the proposed clause that Master Sweeps should be licensed, and before civil registration, {{there was no way that}} anyone could check if a child was actually eight.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Functional {{immunoglobulin}} and T {{cell receptor}} genes are produced in developing lymphocytes by V(D) J recombination. The initial site-specific DNA cleavage steps {{in this process}} are catalyzed by the V(D) J recombinase, consisting <b>of</b> <b>RAG</b> 1 and RAG 2, which is directed to appropriate DNA cleavage sites by recognition of the conserved recombination signal sequence (RSS). RAG 1 contains both the active site and the RSS binding domains, although RAG 2 is also required for DNA cleavage activity. An understanding of the physicochemical properties <b>of</b> the <b>RAG</b> proteins, their association, and their interaction with the RSS is not yet well developed. Results Here, we further our investigations into the self-association properties <b>of</b> <b>RAG</b> 1 by demonstrating that despite the presence <b>of</b> multiple <b>RAG</b> 1 oligomers, only the dimeric form maintains the ability to interact with RAG 2 and the RSS. However, facile aggregation of the dimeric form at physiological temperature may render this protein inactive in the absence <b>of</b> <b>RAG</b> 2. Upon addition <b>of</b> <b>RAG</b> 2 at 37 °C, the preferentially stabilized V(D) J recombinase:RSS complex contains a single dimer <b>of</b> <b>RAG</b> 1. Conclusion Together these results confirm that the functional form <b>of</b> <b>RAG</b> 1 in V(D) J recombination is in the dimeric state, and that its stability under physiological conditions likely requires complex formation with RAG 2. Additionally, in future structural and functional studies <b>of</b> <b>RAG</b> 1, {{it will be important}} {{to take into account the}} temperature-dependent self-association properties <b>of</b> <b>RAG</b> 1 described in this study. </p...|$|R

In Victorian Britain rags were not only associated with the inadequate clothing of the poor, they were also viewed as a valuable commodity, widely collected for recycling into paper. This essay examines rags as simultaneously despised and precious objects, tracing the connections between Victorian accounts of poverty, the industrial recycling <b>of</b> <b>rags</b> into paper, and the redemption narratives created by Charles Dickens about rescued children. A supporter <b>of</b> <b>Ragged</b> Schools and champion <b>of</b> <b>rags</b> recycling, Dickens drew on the idea of the transformation <b>of</b> dirty <b>rags</b> into clean paper in his representations <b>of</b> <b>ragged</b> children. To him, the recycling <b>of</b> <b>rags</b> indicated the civilizing forces of modernity, and reading Dickens's representations <b>of</b> <b>ragged</b> children in this context reveals how cloth recycling became a paradigm for society's duties towards destitute children. This essay explains Dickens's juxtaposition <b>of</b> <b>ragged</b> children with references to rag-dealing in his novels; by this means he suggested that street children, like their ragged clothing, were capable of being purified and transformed into social usefulness...|$|R

40|$|AbstractRecent {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} that DNA cleavage during V(D) J recombination is mediated by the RAG 1 and RAG 2 proteins. These proteins must therefore bind to the recombination signals, but the specific binding interaction has been difficult to study in vitro. Here, we use an in vivo one-hybrid DNA binding assay to demonstrate that RAG 1, in the absence <b>of</b> <b>RAG</b> 2, can mediate signal recognition via the nonamer, with the heptamer acting to enhance its binding. A region <b>of</b> <b>RAG</b> 1 with sequence similarity to bacterial invertases is essential for DNA binding. Localization <b>of</b> <b>RAG</b> 2 to the signal is dependent upon the presence <b>of</b> <b>RAG</b> 1 and is substantially more efficient with a 12 bp spacer signal than with a 23 bp spacer signal...|$|R
40|$|Developing B and T {{lymphocytes}} must {{rearrange the}} genomic sequence of antigen receptor genes by V(D) J recombination. The lymphocyte-specific endonuclease <b>RAG,</b> composed <b>of</b> <b>Rag</b> 1 and Rag 2, initiates this process by cleaving specific sites within antigen receptor loci. RAG expression {{must be carefully}} regulated to ensure that V(D) J recombination occurs only under appropriate circumstances. The Bassing laboratory has previously demonstrated that Igκ locus cleavage by RAG in pre-B cells initiates a feedback-inhibition signal suppressing RAG expression. Here, we show that DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) induced {{by a variety of}} genotoxic agents have a similar effect in suppressing mRNA expression <b>of</b> <b>Rag</b> 1 and Rag 2. This effect can be observed in pro-B cells, pre-B cells, and DN thymocytes, but is not found in DP thymocytes. Using primary pre-B cells as a model system, we show that DSBs activate ATM and Nemo to rapidly suppress transcription <b>of</b> <b>Rag</b> 1 and Rag 2. In pre-B cells, loss <b>of</b> <b>Rag</b> 1 and Rag 2 mRNA expression leads to loss <b>of</b> <b>Rag</b> 1 protein, but Rag 2 protein is more stable and persists in the absence <b>of</b> <b>Rag</b> 2 mRNA. Suppression <b>of</b> <b>Rag</b> 1 expression by DSBs is associated with suppressed RAG-mediated cleavage of the Igκ locus or an artificial recombination substrate in Abelson-transformed pre-B cells. However, simply over-expressing Rag 1 does not allow cells to complete V(D) J recombination in the presence of DSBs, suggesting that other factors may also play a role in suppressing V(D) J recombination. Parallel studies indicate that that RAG-induced DSBs created during V(D) J recombination activate this suppressive signal to enforce allelic exclusion of IgH, TCRβ, and Igκ antigen receptor proteins. We discuss the importance <b>of</b> <b>Rag</b> 1 and Rag 2 suppression in the context of allelic exclusion and propose a role in maintaining genomic stability of developing B and T lymphocytes. ...|$|R

40|$|AbstractAfter the {{subcutaneous}} injection <b>of</b> retinoyl β-glucuronide (<b>RAG),</b> both RAG and retinoic acid (RA), {{formed by the}} hydrolysis <b>of</b> <b>RAG</b> in vivo, achieved peak plasma concentrations within 1 – 2 h. Thereafter, RA was rapidly cleared from the plasma whereas RAG was eliminated much more slowly. No significant changes were noted in the peak (2 h) plasma levels <b>of</b> <b>RAG</b> for treatment periods up to 56 days (one injection of RAG/day), in the clearance rate <b>of</b> <b>RAG</b> from plasma, or in plasma retinol concentrations. Similarly, no consistent decrease in plasma levels of the RA hydrolysis product was observed. Mice undergoing these long-term chronic treatments with RAG did not show any clinical manifestations of retinoid toxicity. Taken together, our findings that chronic dosing with RAG produces sustained levels of both the parent compound and the RA hydrolysis product, combined with the apparent low toxicity <b>of</b> <b>RAG,</b> suggest that RAG could be a safe and useful alternative to some retinoids which are presently being utilized in the clinic...|$|R

40|$|The RAG 1 and RAG 2 {{proteins}} initiate V(D) J recombination {{by introducing}} double-strand breaks {{at the border}} between a recombination signal sequence (RSS) and a coding segment. To understand the distinct functions <b>of</b> <b>RAG</b> 1 and RAG 2 in signal recognition, we have compared the DNA binding activities <b>of</b> <b>RAG</b> 1 alone and RAG 1 plus RAG 2 by gel retardation and footprinting analyses. RAG 1 exhibits only a three- to fivefold preference for binding DNA containing an RSS over random sequence DNA. Although direct binding <b>of</b> <b>RAG</b> 2 by itself was not detected, the presence <b>of</b> both <b>RAG</b> 1 and RAG 2 results in the formation <b>of</b> a <b>RAG</b> 1 -RAG 2 -DNA complex which is more stable and more specific than the RAG 1 -DNA complex and is active in V(D) J cleavage. These results suggest that biologically effective discrimination between an RSS and nonspecific sequences requires both RAG 1 and RAG 2. Unlike the binding <b>of</b> <b>RAG</b> 1 plus RAG 2, RAG 1 can bind to DNA {{in the absence of}} a divalent metal ion and does not require the presence of coding flank sequence. Footprinting <b>of</b> the <b>RAG</b> 1 -RAG 2 complex with 1, 10 -phenanthroline-copper and dimethyl sulfate protection reveal that both the heptamer and the nonamer are involved. The nonamer is protected, with extensive protein contacts within the minor groove. Conversely, the heptamer is rendered more accessible to chemical attack, suggesting that binding <b>of</b> <b>RAG</b> 1 plus RAG 2 distorts the DNA near the coding/signal border...|$|R

40|$|The {{variable}} {{portions of}} antigen receptor genes are assembled from component gene segments by a site-specific recombination reaction known as V(D) J recombination. The RAG 1 and RAG 2 proteins are the critical lymphoid cell-specific {{components of the}} recombination enzymatic machinery and are responsible for site-specific DNA recognition and cleavage. Previous studies had defined a minimal, recombinationally active core region <b>of</b> murine <b>RAG</b> 1 consisting <b>of</b> amino acids 384 to 1008 of the 1, 040 -residue RAG 1 protein. No recombination function has heretofore been ascribed to any portion of the 383 -amino-acid N-terminal region that is missing from the core, but it seems likely to be of functional significance, based on its evolutionary conservation. Using extrachromosomal recombination substrates, we demonstrate here that the N-terminal region enhances the recombination activity <b>of</b> <b>RAG</b> 1 by up to {{an order of magnitude}} in a variety of cell lines. Deletion analysis localized a region of the N terminus critical for this effect to amino acids 216 to 238, and further mutagenesis demonstrated that a small basic amino acid motif (BIIa) in this region is essential for enhancing the activity <b>of</b> <b>RAG</b> 1. Despite the fact that BIIa is important for the interaction <b>of</b> <b>RAG</b> 1 with the nuclear localization factor Srp- 1, it does not appear to enhance recombination by facilitating nuclear transport <b>of</b> <b>RAG</b> 1.
