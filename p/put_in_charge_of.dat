5|$|This forced Bhimsen {{to share}} the {{administrative}} burden between Rajendra, Samrajya Laxmi, and himself, and ask for their opinions on administrative matters, {{in order to reduce}} further friction between himself and the royalty. Rajendra was <b>put</b> <b>in</b> <b>charge</b> <b>of</b> defense, finance, and foreign relations; while Samrajya Laxmi was <b>put</b> <b>in</b> <b>charge</b> <b>of</b> justice, accountancy, and civil administration. Nevertheless, Rajendra's activities were heavily influenced by the advice of Samrajya Laxmi, while the Junior Queen Rajya Laxmi had no say in any matter; furthermore, the King and the Senior Queen did not dare yet to outright dismiss Bhimsen's plans and advice, fearful of the large army under his command. This arrangement worked well for the next three years; for instance, that year, Nepal was struck by a great earthquake, and all three power holders were able to coordinate with each other and provide emergency relief to the citizens.|$|E

Nevertheless, his defensive record indicated the value of his approach.
