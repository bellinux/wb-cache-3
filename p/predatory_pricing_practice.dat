Businesses with dominant or substantial market shares are more vulnerable to antitrust claims. However, because the antitrust laws are ultimately intended to benefit consumers, and discounting results in at least short-term net benefit to consumers, the U.S. Supreme Court has set high hurdles to antitrust claims based on a <b>predatory</b> <b>pricing</b> theory. The Court requires plaintiffs to show a likelihood that the <b>pricing</b> <b>practices</b> will affect not only rivals but also competition in the market as a whole, {{in order to establish}} that there is a substantial probability of success of the attempt to monopolize. If there is a likelihood that market entrants will prevent the predator from recouping its investment through supra competitive pricing, then there is no probability of success and the antitrust claim would fail. In addition, the Court established that for <b>prices</b> to be <b>predatory,</b> they must be below the seller's cost.|$|R

In countries like Denmark, the Netherlands and Germany {{the high levels of}} utility cycling also includes shopping trips e.g. 9% of all shopping trips in Germany are by bicycle. It is arguable that this is related to policies that favour access to retail services by non-motorised modes. The Danish 1997 Planning Act requires that planning shall encourage a diverse mix of retail shops in small and medium-sized towns and in individual districts of large cities and ensure that retail trade uses will be placed in locations to which people have good access by walking, bicycling and public transport. From the mid-1970s the Netherlands has had policies in place to severely restrict the growth of large out-of-town retail developments. Germany has had federal planning regulations in place to restrict retail uses to designated areas since the 1960s. In addition, since the 1970s federal regulations have been in place specifying that developments above a certain size (1,200m²) be assessed regarding potential adverse effects. These federal regulations are further strengthened by regionally adopted regulations. This includes regulations specifying that new retail centres be limited to selling products not readily provided by shops at inner city/town centre locations. In Denmark, the Netherlands, and Germany, this approach not restricted to planning guidelines and is also supported by a ban on below cost selling. This supports smaller shops by preventing large multiples from engaging in <b>predatory</b> <b>pricing</b> <b>practices</b> by aggressively discounting key goods to use as so called loss leaders.|$|R

There is therefore little basis for a per se prohibition, even restricted to a particular category of suspicious-looking schemes. Second, dominant firms willing to engage into an exclusionary strategy may find that cleverly fine-tuned pricing schemes involving loyalty rebates possess several advantages over simple <b>predatory</b> <b>pricing</b> strategies: they can achieve exclusion at a lower cost, be more credible, and erect a permanent barrier to entry without any need for a recoupment period.

40|$|Over {{the last}} decade the market-driven {{economic}} philosophies of successive New Zealand governments have transformed {{the structure of the}} economy. These changes have established favourable market conditions for the success of a particular type of anticompetitive organisational behaviour, <b>predatory</b> <b>pricing.</b> From the mid 1950 s to the early 1980 s, economic analyses of <b>predatory</b> <b>pricing</b> theories frequently concluded that this behaviour constituted economically irrational behaviour. This conclusion generated a widespread scepticism among antitrust commentators, policymakers and judges towards the prevalence of such behaviour. Recently, however, the basis for this conclusion has been undermined by the application of Game Theory to <b>predatory</b> <b>pricing.</b> Game-theoretic analysis has proven that <b>predatory</b> <b>pricing</b> is rational under a range of market conditions and consequently, issues regarding the need for prohibition and the optimal method of proscription have again become relevant. This research investigates the contemporary developments in economic and judicial analysis of <b>predatory</b> <b>pricing</b> in order to evaluate the efficacy of section 36 of the Commerce Act 1986 in prohibiting this behaviour. A comprehensive survey of the game-theoretic <b>predatory</b> <b>pricing</b> models concludes that these models refute a number of well-known irrationality arguments and that <b>predatory</b> <b>pricing</b> cannot be regarded as irrational organisational behaviour. Prominent standards proposed in the literature for the existence of <b>predatory</b> <b>pricing</b> are then shown to be deficient in light of the insights provided by the application of game theory. A critique of the most recent <b>predatory</b> <b>pricing</b> cases decided by the United States Supreme Court, the Court of Justice of the European Economic Community and the Australian Full Federal Court is then conducted and it is found that the form and content of the standard for any jurisdiction must be dictated by the specific objectives of the competition law legislation.

40|$|The Standard Oil case {{continues}} to inform {{many aspects of}} current antitrust policy. Part of Standard Oil’s significance, however, has been lost over time. The Supreme Court condemned a range of conduct by the Standard Oil Company as anticompetitive, including <b>predatory</b> <b>pricing.</b> <b>Predatory</b> <b>pricing</b> occurs when a firm prices its product below cost in order to drive its competitors from the market. Once enough rivals have exited the market, the predator raises price and earns stream of monopoly profits. In the decades following the opinion, the conventional wisdom held that Standard Oil had engaged in <b>predatory</b> <b>pricing.</b> The Standard Oil opinion stood for the proposition that using <b>predatory</b> <b>pricing</b> to acquire or maintain a monopoly violates Section 2 of the Sherman Act. The opinion did not define the contours of <b>predatory</b> <b>pricing,</b> neither explicitly saying that a <b>predatory</b> <b>price</b> is a price below cost nor specifying what measure of cost courts should use. Nevertheless, the opinion {{laid the groundwork for}} future federal courts to address these questions and to provide more structure to the <b>predatory</b> <b>pricing</b> cause of action. Based on a revisionist history of Standard Oil written by John McGee in 1958 article, the new conventional wisdom now holds that the Standard Oil Company never engaged in <b>predatory</b> <b>pricing</b> and that the case stands for the proposition that monopolists do not use below-cost pricing as a mechanism to acquire or maintain monopoly power. The article challenges McGee’s thesis. After exploring how McGee’s work has affected antitrust jurisprudence, this article challenges McGee’s interpretation of the trial record in Standard Oil, showing several instances where the data shows the Standard Oil Company charging a price below its costs. McGee often ignored or misinterpreted evidence inconsistent with his thesis that the Standard Oil Company never engaged in <b>predatory</b> <b>pricing.</b> Finally, despite claims that McGee’s work is empirical proof of the irrationality and nonexistence of <b>predatory</b> <b>pricing,</b> this article shows that McGee’s work is theoretical, not empirical, and has had undue influence...|$|R
40|$|<b>Predatory</b> <b>pricing</b> [...] a {{deliberate}} strategy of pricing aggressively {{in order to}} eliminate competitors [...] {{is one of the}} more contentious areas of antitrust policy and its existence and efficacy are widely debated. The purpose of this paper is to formally characterize <b>predatory</b> <b>pricing</b> in a modern industry dynamics framework. We endogenize competitive advantage and industry structure through learning-by-doing. We first show that predation-like behavior arises routinely in our model. Equilibria involving predation-like behavior typically coexist with equilibria involving much less aggressive <b>pricing.</b> To disentangle <b>predatory</b> <b>pricing</b> from mere competition for efficiency on a learning curve we next decompose the equilibrium pricing condition. Our decomposition provides us with a coherent and flexible way to develop alternative characterizations of a firm’s <b>predatory</b> <b>pricing</b> incentives, some of which are motivated by the existing literature while others are novel. We finally measure the impact of the <b>predatory</b> <b>pricing</b> incentives on industry structure, conduct, and performance. We show that forcing a firm to ignore these incentives in setting its price can have a large impact and that this impact stems from eliminating equilibria with predation-like behavior. Along with the predation-like behavior, however, a fair amount of competition for the market is eliminated. Overall, the distinction between <b>predatory</b> <b>pricing</b> and pricing aggressively to pursue efficiency is closely related to the distinction between the advantage-building and advantage-denying motives that our decomposition of the equilibrium pricing condition isolates and measures. competition policy; industry dynamics; <b>predatory</b> <b>pricing...</b>|$|R
40|$|This Article {{discusses}} the principles under Article 82 of the Treaty Establishing the European Community concerning anticompetitive or exclusionary abuses involving pricing issues. This Article is structured as follows. Part I outlines the basic economic thinking behind price discrimination and identifies the principal legal situations under Article 82 {{in which it}} arises. Discriminatory pricing should only be prohibited (and therefore needs to be justified) in {{a small number of}} situations. Parts II-III discuss the specific situations under Community competition law in which price discrimination and the legality of <b>pricing</b> <b>practices</b> may be relevant. Part II discusses rebate and discounting practices, including target (or sales growth) rebates, fidelity or loyalty rebates, and rebates in return for exclusivity. Part III discusses price discrimination that gives rise to distortions of competition between customers. This concerns Article 82 (c), a provision that has some parallels with the Robinson-Patman Act under U. S. law. In practice, it will be rare that a profit-maximizing firm will have the ability or incentive to charge different prices to comparable customers {{to such an extent that}} competition between those customers will be significantly distorted. Part IV discusses <b>predatory</b> <b>pricing.</b> It is important that prices that remain above average variable cost should nearly always be treated as legal, since rivals will usually be able, and should be encouraged, to compete in that scenario. Community competition law should only treat pricing above average variable cost as unlawful where there is evidence of other abusive behavior linked to that low pricing, in other words a clear plan to eliminate a rival by using a range of illicit practices. Part V discusses a specific instance of <b>predatory</b> <b>pricing</b> [...] cross-subsidization.

40|$|<b>Predatory</b> <b>pricing</b> is a two-step {{strategy}} for securing monopoly profits. During {{the first step}} [...] the predation stage [...] a firm charges a price below its costs {{in the hope of}} driving its competitors out of the market by forcing them to sell at a loss as well. If it succeeds, the firm can proceed to the second step [...] the recoupment stage. After it has the market to itself, the now-dominant firm charges a monopoly price in an effort to recoup the losses it sustained in the predation stage and to earn a steady stream of monopoly profits into the future. <b>Predatory</b> <b>pricing</b> violates section 2 of the Sherman Act, which prohibits the use of anticompetitive conduct to acquire or maintain monopoly power. <b>Predatory</b> <b>pricing</b> is one form of anticompetitive conduct. Many judges and scholars, however, believe that <b>predatory</b> <b>pricing</b> does not occur because the two-step strategy combines significant up-front costs with a low probability of success. This skepticism has led courts to impose a recoupment element for section 2 <b>predatory</b> <b>pricing</b> claims. The recoupment element requires an antitrust plaintiff bringing a <b>predatory</b> <b>pricing</b> claim to prove that the defendant will be able to acquire monopoly power and to charge a monopoly price for long enough to make the whole scheme profitable. Antitrust liability becomes a function of the defendant 2 ̆ 7 s profitability. This Article discusses the evolution of and rationale for the recoupment requirement. It shows how recoupment analysis by courts is often flawed, largely because judges incorrectly assume that market entry, which can prevent recoupment, is easy. This Article then illustrates the many ways in which recoupment can occur, including recoupment in other markets and recoupment through cartel or oligopoly pricing. Despite these various modes of recoupment, federal courts have sometimes structured the recoupment requirement {{in a way that is}} literally impossible to satisfy.

After exploring the judicial misapplication of the recoupment requirement, this Article challenges the underlying premises of the element by showing how <b>predatory</b> <b>pricing</b> can hurt consumers and competition even if a firm engaged in <b>predatory</b> <b>pricing</b> is unable to eventually recoup its losses.

However, Dow simply instructed his agents to buy up at the very low price and then sell it back in Germany at a profit but still lower than Bromkonvention's price.
