Therefore, the roughness of the surface area of the material cut by the <b>plasma</b> arc <b>cutting</b> process {{and the rate of}} the removed material by the manual <b>plasma</b> arc <b>cutting</b> machine was importantly considered. Plasma arc cutter Selco Genesis 90 was used to cut Standard AISI 1017 Steel of 200 mm x 100 mm x 6 mm manually based on the selected parameters setting. The material removal rate (MRR) was measured by determining the weight of the specimens before and after the cutting process. The surface roughness (SR) analysis was conducted using Mitutoyo CS- 3100 to determine the average roughness value (Ra). Taguchi method was utilized to achieve optimum condition for both outputs studied. The microstructure analysis in the region of the cutting surface is performed using SEM. The results reveal that the SR values are inversely proportional to the MRR values. The quality of the surface roughness depends on the dross peak that occurred after the cutting process.

The optimization of the process parameters have been carried out using desirability function, grey based principal component analysis (PCA) hybrid approach, genetic algorithm (GA), particle swarm optimization (PSO), simulated annealing (SA) and teaching-learning-based-optimization (TLBO) algorithm coupled with response surface methodology (RSM).

40|$|Thesis (MTech (Mechanical Engineering)) [...] Peninsula Technikon, 1999 The {{simulation}} of Plasma Arc Cutting {{is presented in}} this study. The <b>plasma</b> arc <b>cutting</b> process employs a plasma torch with a very narrow bore to produce a transferred arc to the workpiece. A technique for modelling <b>plasma</b> arc <b>cutting</b> has been developed by applying the thermo-metallurgical model to the process and integrating a model of material removal to this model. The model is solved using the finite element method using the FE package SYSWORLD, more specifically SYSWELD. The objective {{is to determine the}} minimum energy required to cut a plate of some thickness using this virtual model. The characteristics of the cut need to exhibit the characteristics of a "high quality cut". The model presented can predict the kerf size given certain process variable settings. The numerical results obtained are assessed by conducting experiments. By maintaining Ill 1 rumum energy input cost savings can be made through energy savings, limiting additional finishing processes and reducing expense of shortening the electrode and nozzle lifetimes. The modelling of the PAC process using virtual design techniques provides a cost-effective solution to the manufacturing industries with respect to process specification development.

40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. November 2015. Major: Mechanical Engineering. Advisors: Emil Pfender, Terrence Simon. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); xv, 156 pages. The process of cutting metal with a <b>plasma</b> arc <b>cutting</b> tool is investigated and discussed. Focus {{is on the}} metal cutting process at the inside surface of the kerf. This is an important region that is not well documented due {{to the difficulty of}} experiments and the complexity of computation needed to characterize this process. In the present work, a three-dimensional numerical simulation using a plasma model combined with a melting process model is conducted and results are discussed, leading {{to a better understanding of}} the physical phenomena within the kerf region of a commercial <b>plasma</b> arc <b>cutting</b> tool. The modeling includes three different phenomena: 1) the plasma jet flow, 2) the Volume of Fluid (VoF) method in identify the gas to molten metal interface, and 3) the phase change model for computing the melting process. The model is implemented in the open source CFD software, OpenFOAM. Thermodynamic and transport properties, calculated by kinetic theory of gases and statistical mechanics, are implemented for accurate simulation in the high temperature regions. The simulation results show the transient cutting process including the physical phenomena for melting of the work piece as well as the plasma flow. The simulated kerf shape is compared to measured kerf under same operations. Additionally, the temperature, velocity, and current density distributions are discussed to understand the plasma characteristics during the cutting process. In an attempt to make a more reasonable kerf shape, the swirl component of the jet, the surface tension and the phase change model are investigated for improvement and discussed. Effects of metal vapor and oxidation reaction are also discussed. This work is a first attempt simulation of the plasma flow, melting, and molten metal flow in the <b>plasma</b> arc <b>cutting</b> process. As the model approaches physical reality, it gives increasingly useful insight into the relationships among operating conditions, providing very helpful directions to improve performance, and providing useful data for designing the <b>plasma</b> arc <b>cutting</b> process...|$|R

50|$|Used in the {{processing}} of tube, pipe or any form of long section.

50|$|Once again, {{a process}} for {{producing}} flat profiles from sheet or plate metal, however with the introduction of an additional axis of rotation, the cutting head of a CNC <b>Plasma</b> <b>Cutting</b> machine can tilt whilst being taken through a conventional 2 dimensional cutting path. The result of this is cut edges at an angle other than 90 Degrees to the material surface, for example 30-45 Degree angles. This angle is continuous throughout the thickness of the material. This is typically applied in situations where the profile being cut is to be used as part of a welded fabrication as the angled edge forms part of the weld preparation. When the weld preparation is applied during the cnc <b>plasma</b> <b>cutting</b> process, secondary operations such as grinding or machining can be avoided, reducing cost.
