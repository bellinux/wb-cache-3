In 1998 Ambassador Fulci masterminded the <b>procedural</b> <b>resolution,</b> introduced by the [...] "Coffee Club" [...] and approved by the General Assembly, which states that any resolution or decision on the reform of the Security Council, at all stages of the reform process, has to be adopted with a majority of two thirds of the UN member States.

5000|$|In mid-1944, the {{delegations}} {{from the}} Allied [...] "Big Four", the Soviet Union, the UK, the US and China, {{met for the}} Dumbarton Oaks Conference in Washington, D.C. to negotiate the UN's structure, and {{the composition of the}} UN Security Council quickly became the dominant issue. France, the Republic of China, the Soviet Union, the UK, and US were selected as permanent members of the Security Council; the US attempted to add Brazil as a sixth member, but was opposed by the heads of the Soviet and British delegations. The most contentious issue at Dumbarton and in successive talks proved to be the veto rights of permanent members. The Soviet delegation argued that each nation should have an absolute veto that could block matters from even being discussed, while the British argued that nations should not be able to veto resolutions on disputes to which they were a party. At the Yalta Conference of February 1945, the American, British, and Russian delegations agreed that each of the [...] "Big Five" [...] could veto any action by the council, but not <b>procedural</b> <b>resolutions,</b> meaning that the permanent members could not prevent debate on a resolution.|$|R

Then there is detailed description of functions and powers of the Security Council, including also a topic relating to the Council's period of paralysis. In the chapter on voting procedure there is stressed the crucial issue of distinguishing <b>procedural</b> and non-procedural <b>resolutions</b> with talking about veto power as well.

50|$|Rules of {{criminal}} or civil procedure govern {{the conduct of}} a lawsuit in the common law adversarial system of dispute <b>resolution.</b> <b>Procedural</b> rules are constrained and informed by separate statutory laws, case laws, and constitutional provisions that define {{the rights of the}} parties to a lawsuit (see especially due process), though the rules generally reflect this legal context on their face. The details of the procedure differ greatly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, and often from court to court even within the same jurisdiction. These rules of the particular procedures are very important for litigants to know, because the litigants are the ones who dictate the timing and progression of the lawsuit. Litigants are responsible to obtain the suited result and the timing of reaching this result. Failure to comply with the procedural rules may result in serious limitations that can affect the ability of one to present claims or defenses at any subsequent trial, or even promote the dismissal of the lawsuit altogether.|$|R
40|$|The author {{analyzes}} the influence and practical consequences that privatist and publicist ideology have had: in the scopes {{of the civil}} process, in {{the roles of the}} judge and the parties, {{in the structure of the}} procedure, in the regulation of the evidentiary system, in alternative methods of dispute <b>resolution,</b> <b>procedural</b> conventions, execution of judgment and class actions. It then describes how the cooperative process model adopted for instance by the Brazilian CPC of 2015, characterized by the equality of the procedural subjects and the participatory contradictory, seeks to overcome the privatist model, characterized by the dispositive principle, as well as the publicist model, qualified by the principle of official enforcement. It emphasizes the importance, in the systems of collective process, of a constant judicial control of the legitimacy and adequate representation of those who act in the name of the collectivities so that the due process of the members of these groups that did not participate in the process is respected. In the case of the incident of resolution of repetitive demands and repetitive appeals, it presents the call to the process of those legitimized for the defense of homogeneous individual rights, including the Public Prosecutor's Office, as a way of managing the problem of the lack of representativeness and of respecting due process. Finally, he argues that civil proceedings must be considered in the perspective of fundamental rights, as an adequate, effective and efficient instrument to protect supreme value...|$|R
40|$|In Finland, a {{government}} bill on plea bargaining {{is now at}} the parliament. In Estonia, Norway, Denmark, Germany and Latvia they have adopted similar systems already. In Sweden and Iceland plea bargaining is not possible. As a procedural instrument, plea bargaining is something quite new in Europe, and in the Baltic and in the Nordic countries. How does it fit into our systems and into our way of thinking? If we look at the current trends in criminal proceedings fairness, <b>procedural</b> justice, conflict <b>resolution,</b> negotiated law, pragmatically acceptable compromise, procedural truth, party autonomy, court service, communication and interaction are good examples of the topics which are currently being discussed. All these examples indicate that the criminal jurisdiction has become more communal. It has even been said that criminal proceedings have recently become closer civil proceedings, which seems to be quite true. Still, efficiency {{plays a major role in}} European adjudication thanks to economic crisis and lack of resources. How to understand the role of plea bargaining in this set? At least the legislator has pointed out the efficiency, the appropriate allocation of resources and the simplifying the criminal proceedings when suggesting adopting the plea bargaining in Finland. The novelty has not been put into philosophical context or into the systemic context of criminal proceedings. It looks like the legislator adopts some single instruments from the foreign legal orders if they seem to fit well into legislatorsâ€™ puzzle to intensify the proceedings and to save the state money. However, there seem to be more coherent trends behind all of that as well - namely, the change of paradigm...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Clinical trials {{comparing}} thrombectomy devices {{with conventional}} percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) {{in patients with}} acute ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) have produced conflicting results. The objective of our study was to systematically evaluate currently available data comparing thrombectomy followed by PCI with conventional PCI alone in patients with acute STEMI. Methods Seventeen randomized trials (n = 3, 909 patients) of thrombectomy versus PCI were included in this meta-analysis. We calculated the summary odds ratios for mortality, stroke, post procedural myocardial blush grade (MBG), thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) grade flow, and post <b>procedural</b> ST segment <b>resolution</b> (STR) using random-effects and fixed-effects models. Results There {{was no difference in}} risk of 30 -day mortality (44 / 1914 vs. 50 / 1907, OR 0. 84, 95 % CI 0. 54 - 1. 29, P = 0. 42) among patients randomized to thrombectomy, compared with conventional PCI. Thrombectomy was associated with a significantly greater likelihood of TIMI 3 flow (1616 / 1826 vs. 1533 / 1806, OR 1. 41, P = 0. 007), MBG 3 (730 / 1526 vs. 486 / 1513, OR 2. 42, P < 0. 001), STR (923 / 1500 vs. 715 / 1494, OR 2. 30, P < 0. 001), and with a higher risk of stroke (14 / 1403 vs. 3 / 1413, OR 2. 88, 95 % CI 1. 06 - 7. 85, P = 0. 04). Outcomes differed significantly between different device classes with a trend towards lower mortality with manual aspiration thrombectomy (MAT) (21 / 949 vs. 36 / 953, OR 0. 59, 95 % CI 0. 35 - 1. 01, P = 0. 05), whereas mechanical devices showed a trend towards higher mortality (20 / 416 vs. 10 / 418, OR 2. 07, 95 % CI 0. 95 - 4. 48, P = 0. 07). Conclusions Thrombectomy devices appear to improve markers of myocardial perfusion in patients undergoing primary PCI, with no difference in overall 30 -day mortality but an increased likelihood of stroke. The clinical benefits of thrombectomy appear to be influenced by the device type with a trend towards survival benefit with MAT and worsening outcome with mechanical devices...|$|R
