He became a <b>primary</b> <b>school</b> <b>teacher</b> for a brief while, and then earned a {{scholarship}} to a university in Argentina, where he earned a doctorate in the philosophy of education. He returned to Guatemala in 1934, and sought a position in the Ministry of Education. However, he was denied the position he wished for, and felt uncomfortable under the dictatorship of Ubico. He left the country and held a faculty position in Argentina until 1944, when he returned to Guatemala. In July 1944 the Renovación Nacional, the teachers' party, had been formed, and Arévalo was named its candidate. In an unexpected surge of support, his candidacy was endorsed by many of the leading organizations among the protesters, including the student federation. His lack of connection to the dictatorship and his academic background both worked in his favor among the students and teachers. At the same time, {{the fact that he had}} chosen to go into exile in conservative Argentina rather than revolutionary Mexico reassured landowners worried about socialist or communist reform.|$|E

Gordon claimed that she had left home for another man, and Carol had left their home in Leece twice before. It was for this reason, Gordon claimed, {{that he did not}} report her missing for six weeks. Carol was said to time her periods away from home to coincide with the school holidays. Gordon claimed that it wasn't until she didn't return in time to take up her job as a <b>primary</b> <b>school</b> <b>teacher</b> in September (the start of the school term) that he realised that there was a problem. At this time he reported her missing via his solicitor, and her family was informed. On the day she vanished, the family had been due to visit Blackpool on a day trip.

Gordon claimed he returned home to find Carol had left the house, leaving behind her wedding ring, {{and that there was no}} sign of a struggle. A missing persons enquiry was launched, but nothing came of it. This missing persons report was subsequently lost, and it was implied by some that it was because both Gordon and a senior police commander (who, by the time the article was published, had died) involved in the case were freemasons. This was rebutted by Sandra Lean, who, in No Smoke, claimed that Gordon had never been a freemason. At the time, police told Gordon that, should a body be found, he would be the main suspect.|$|E

This study came about because as a high <b>school</b> art <b>teacher,</b> the researcher had noticed {{that a lot of}} students when they reached high school were disinterested in visual arts or did not believe they were any good at it. Therefore, the researcher wanted insight into what visual arts <b>primary</b> <b>school</b> <b>teachers</b> were teaching, how they were teaching visual arts and how confident and competent they were in their visual arts teaching. With the aim that this would help to develop an understanding of what visual arts ‘looks like’ in Tasmanian <b>primary</b> <b>schools,</b> and in so doing establish what further research may be developed to continue to improve visual arts teaching in Tasmanian <b>primary</b> <b>schools.</b> A naturalistic, mixed methods approach was used to uncover the perceptions and opinions of Tasmanian generalist <b>primary</b> <b>school</b> <b>teachers</b> in regards to their visual arts teaching.

40|$|In {{my thesis}} I have taken into {{consideration}} the areas of awareness, understanding and regulating emotions in <b>primary</b> <b>school</b> <b>teachers</b> and kindergarten teachers. The main purpose of the thesis is to determine whether <b>primary</b> <b>school</b> <b>teachers</b> and kindergarten teachers are aware of and understand their emotions and which group strategies regulate their emotions (cognitive, behavioral-expressive, physical-physiological and social) which they use at their work with children. In the theoretical part I have explained that emotions are defined as complicated and assembled processes which include a number of cognitive, physiological, expressive and behavioral responses (Smrtnik Vitulić, 2007). I have presented in more detail a division of emotions; such as pleasant and unpleasant, strong and weak as well as basic and complex emotions. The strategies of regulating these emotions are presented in more detail and are divided into four major groups: cognitive, behavioral-expressive, physical-physiological and social. I have concluded the theoretical part of the thesis with a research of awareness, understanding and regulating emotions of <b>primary</b> <b>school</b> and kindergarten <b>teachers.</b> In the empirical part of the thesis I have introduced how I carried out the research and obtained results about awareness, understanding and regulating emotions of <b>primary</b> <b>school</b> <b>teachers</b> and kindergarten teachers. I also researched the differences between <b>primary</b> <b>school</b> <b>teachers</b> and kindergarten teachers {{regarding the use of}} different group strategies to regulate their emotions, such as cognitive, behavioral-expressive, physical-physiological and social are introduced. 102 <b>primary</b> <b>school</b> <b>teachers</b> from 13 Slovene <b>primary</b> <b>schools</b> from Ljubljana and surrounding areas and 164 kindergarten teachers from 8 Slovenian kindergartens took place in this research. A questionnaire was used to obtained the data, which was made by S. Prosen and H. Smrtnik Vitulić (2011). In the survey I was interested in whether <b>primary</b> <b>school</b> <b>teachers</b> and kindergarten teachers are aware of their emotions, what strategies they use to regulate their emotions and if they use both sides while working with children. I was also interested in whether kindergarten <b>teachers</b> differ from <b>primary</b> <b>school</b> <b>teachers</b> in using certain strategies when regulating their emotions. The results obtained with self evaluations, presented that <b>primary</b> <b>school</b> <b>teachers</b> and kindergarten teachers are aware of their emotions, they understand, recognize and give them enough attention. They more often attribute the experiencing of unpleasant feelings to themselves than to others and they estimate that they know how to describe their feelings. <b>Primary</b> <b>school</b> <b>teachers</b> and kindergarten teachers relatively frequently use the chosen strategies to regulate their emotions (cognitive, behavioral-expressive, physical-physiological and social). In assessing the level of awareness and understanding the emotions between the <b>primary</b> <b>school</b> <b>teachers</b> and kindergarten teachers I did not find any statistically significant differences. Statistically significant differences between <b>primary</b> <b>school</b> <b>teachers</b> and kindergarten teachers appeared only in two out of thirteen included strategies to regulate emotions: <b>primary</b> <b>school</b> <b>teachers</b> more often than kindergarten teachers regulate unpleasant emotions in such a manner, that they are looking for the reasons for their unpleasant emotions (cognitive strategies to regulate emotions). Also <b>primary</b> <b>school</b> <b>teachers</b> more often than kindergarten teachers try to influence their feelings by calming down their bodies (physical-physiological control strategy of emotions). The occupation of <b>primary</b> <b>school</b> <b>teachers</b> and kindergarten teachers is important since it represents a great role model for children, therefore it is especially important for them to be aware of and understand their emotions as well as to know how to regulate them in the correct way...|$|R
