2500|$|Also in 1915, Nour {{designed}} {{and published in}} Bucharest an ethnographic map of Bessarabia {{on a scale of}} 1:450,000. Building on a cartographic model first used by Zsigmond Bátky in his [...] "Lands of the Crown of Saint Stephen" [...] ethnographic map and later adapted to the Balkans by Jovan Cvijić, Nour's map divided the regions depicted into communal entities, represented as <b>pie</b> <b>charts</b> of the various nationalities. The resulting majority (2 out of 3 million inhabitants) was Romanian, with a note explaining that these were known locally as [...] "Moldovans"—being Nour's contribution to the debate on Moldovan ethnicity. Beyond Bessarabia, Nour's map states a claim about the Romanians of Transnistria, including their presence in a locality named Nouroaia.|$|E

50|$|<b>Pie</b> <b>charts</b> {{are very}} {{widely used in}} the {{business}} world and the mass media.

50|$|The French {{engineer}} Charles Joseph Minard {{was one of}} {{the first}} to use <b>pie</b> <b>charts</b> in 1858, in particular in maps. Minard's map, 1858 used <b>pie</b> <b>charts</b> to represent the cattle sent from all around France for consumption in Paris (1858).|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{identify}} the pedagogical knowledge relevant to the successful completion of a <b>pie</b> <b>chart</b> item. This purpose was achieved through the identification of the essential fluencies that 12 - 13 -year-olds required for the successful solution of a <b>pie</b> <b>chart</b> item. Fluency relates to ease of solution and is particularly important in mathematics because it impacts on performance. Although the majority of students were successful on this multiple choice item, there was considerable divergence in the strategies they employed. Approximately two-thirds of the students employed efficient multiplicative strategies which recognised and capitalised on the <b>pie</b> <b>chart</b> as a proportional representation. In contrast, the remaining one third of students used a less efficient additive strategy that failed to capitalise on the representation of the <b>pie</b> <b>chart.</b> The results of our investigation of students ‟ performance on the <b>pie</b> <b>chart</b> item during individual interviews revealed five distinct fluencies were involved in the solution process: conceptual (understanding the question), linguistic (key words), retrieval (strateg...|$|R
