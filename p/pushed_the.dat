5|$|After several revisions, the {{studbook}} {{was closed}} in 1922 after registering 424 foundation horses. The {{closing of the}} studbook brought about additional purebred breeding and selection based on conformation, color and working ability. In 1923, an association of Poitevin breeders was founded, but declining livestock production <b>pushed</b> <b>the</b> group to reorganize in 1937 {{in order to gain}} more support from the government, through bonuses and subsidies.|$|E
5|$|Although {{completed}} successfully, {{the building}} {{turned out to}} be little more than an extravagant nail in Price Brothers' coffin. The Great Depression <b>pushed</b> <b>the</b> company to the brink of bankruptcy, and the Price Family lost both control of the company and most of its fortune. Various restoration work was undertaken during the 1950s and '60s, mostly to the interior of the building.|$|E
5|$|Although many fires {{likewise}} burnt {{following the}} bombing, {{in contrast to}} Hiroshima where sufficient fuel density was available, no firestorm developed in Nagasaki as the damaged areas did not furnish enough fuel to generate the phenomenon. Instead, the ambient wind at the time <b>pushed</b> <b>the</b> fire spread along the valley.|$|E
5000|$|At {{the top of}} the loop, {{the force}} of <b>the</b> car's {{acceleration}} <b>pushes</b> <b>the</b> passenger off the seat {{toward the center of the}} loop, while inertia <b>pushes</b> <b>the</b> passenger back into the seat. Gravity and acceleration forces <b>push</b> <b>the</b> passenger in opposite directions with nearly equal force, creating a sensation of weightlessness.|$|R

50|$|In its {{day it was}} {{referred}} to as <b>The</b> <b>Push,</b> a title which has since come to be more widely used for the 1940s left-wing movement <b>the</b> Sydney <b>Push.</b> <b>The</b> gang was engaged in running warfare with other larrikin gangs of the time such as <b>the</b> Straw Hat <b>Push,</b> <b>the</b> Glebe <b>Push,</b> <b>the</b> Argyle Cut <b>Push,</b> <b>the</b> Forty Thieves from Surry Hills and the Gibb Street Mob. Italian crime gangs have been active in Melbourne and Sydney, and even some youth gangs like the Sharpies in the 1960s have been large enough to cause disturbances, though lacking criminal organisation.|$|R
5|$|As in the First World War, Brazil was neutral {{during the}} early years of the Second World War. German attacks on Brazilian {{merchant}} ships <b>pushed</b> <b>the</b> country into war on the Allied side; Brazil declared war on 21 August 1942, taking effect on 31 August.|$|E
5|$|Before Soul Reavers release, the {{relationship}} between Silicon Knights and Crystal Dynamics dissolved. Because their research was used, Silicon Knights filed an injunction to stop further promotion of the game. Other delays <b>pushed</b> <b>the</b> release date from October 1998 to August 1999.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{outbreak}} of the Korean War in 1950, most of Gyeongju was spared from the fighting, and remained under South Korean control throughout the conflict. However, for a brief time in late 1950 portions of the city stood on the front lines, as North Korean forces <b>pushed</b> <b>the</b> Pusan Perimeter southward from Pohang.|$|E
2500|$|To {{avoid having}} Aman and Houghton bail out over hostile territory, Pardo {{decided to try}} <b>pushing</b> <b>the</b> airplane. Pardo first tried <b>pushing</b> <b>the</b> plane using Aman's drag chute {{compartment}} but turbulence interfered.|$|R
50|$|The gang {{was engaged}} in running warfare with other larrikin gangs of the time such as <b>the</b> Millers Point <b>Push,</b> Straw Hat <b>Push,</b> <b>the</b> Glebe <b>Push,</b> <b>the</b> Argyle Cut <b>Push,</b> <b>the</b> Forty Thieves from Surry Hills and the Gibb Street Mob. They {{conducted}} such crimes as theft, assault and battery against police and pedestrians in the Rocks area. Female members of <b>the</b> <b>Push</b> would entice drunks and seamen into dark areas to be assaulted and robbed by the gang.|$|R

5|$|Gail Kim {{defended the}} TNA Women's World Championship against Awesome Kong {{in the fifth}} bout. It lasted eight minutes and twenty-three seconds. During the match, Kong {{repeatedly}} refused {{to listen to the}} referee's orders, and eventually <b>pushed</b> <b>the</b> referee down, resulting in a disqualification and Kim retained the title.|$|E
5|$|Having <b>pushed</b> <b>the</b> Crusaders out {{of most of}} Syria, the Ayyubids {{generally}} {{adopted a}} policy of peace with them. The war with the Crusaders did not prevent Muslims under Ayyubid governance from developing good commercial relations with European states. This led to fruitful interaction between both sides in different fields of economic activity, particularly in agriculture and trade.|$|E
5|$|In 2015, {{the stadium}} was {{expanded}} {{with the addition}} of the Toyota Fan Deck including a new 12 Flag raising platform. This expansion was privately funded by the Seahawks and the 1,000 additional seats were made available to purchase by current season ticket holders the Blue Pride waiting list for season tickets. The additional seating <b>pushed</b> <b>the</b> capacity of the stadium to 69,000-plus.|$|E

50|$|A {{right-handed}} propeller (which rotates clockwise {{viewed from}} the stern when in forward gear) will tend to <b>push</b> <b>the</b> stern of the boat to starboard, thereby <b>pushing</b> <b>the</b> bow to port and turning the boat counter-clockwise unless the rotation is corrected for.When in reverse gear, the effect will be much greater and opposite. A right-handed propeller run in reverse will <b>push</b> <b>the</b> aft of the boat to port.|$|R
50|$|The rudder is {{typically}} {{mounted on the}} trailing edge of the vertical stabilizer, part of the empennage. When <b>the</b> pilot <b>pushes</b> <b>the</b> left pedal, the rudder deflects left. <b>Pushing</b> <b>the</b> right pedal causes the rudder to deflect right. Deflecting <b>the</b> rudder right <b>pushes</b> <b>the</b> tail left and causes the nose to yaw to the right. Centering the rudder pedals returns the rudder to neutral and stops the yaw.|$|R
5|$|In the Iberian peninsula, Crusader {{privileges}} {{were given}} to those aiding the Templars, the Hospitallers, and the Iberian orders that merged with the orders of Calatrava and Santiago. The Christian kingdoms <b>pushed</b> <b>the</b> Muslim Moors and Almohads back in frequent Papal-endorsed Iberian Crusades from 1212 to 1265. The Emirate of Granada held out until 1492, {{at which point the}} Muslims and Jews were finally expelled from the peninsula.|$|E
5|$|On {{the third}} day, Australia reached 5/305 when Johnson {{came in to}} bat. He made 21 with three fours, {{including}} an edge over the slips cordon, before being bowled by Laker. Johnson hit the ball onto his foot, which deflected it back into his stumps. This left Australia at 6/338 but the lower order continued to contribute and <b>pushed</b> <b>the</b> total to 509, giving the tourists a 344-run lead.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{significant}} demographic changes in the state was the percentage of urban dwellers. Between 1910 and 1930, the percentage of urban dwellers (those living in towns of greater than 2500 people) increased by 32%, resulting in 41% of Texans living in urban areas in 1930. World WarII <b>pushed</b> <b>the</b> urban population over 50%.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>push</b> <b>pushes</b> <b>the</b> palm {{backward}} {{through the}} water underneath the body {{at the beginning and}} {{at the side of the}} body at the end of <b>the</b> <b>push.</b> <b>The</b> swimmer only <b>pushes</b> <b>the</b> arms 1/3 of the way to the hips, making it easier to enter into the recovery and making the recovery shorter and making the breathing window shorter. The movement increases speed throughout the pull-push phase until the hand is the fastest at the end of <b>the</b> <b>push.</b> This step is called the release and is crucial for the recovery. The speed at the end of <b>the</b> <b>push</b> is used to help with the recovery.|$|R
50|$|Four pushing men ("spingitori") and a pilot {{take part}} in <b>the</b> races.The <b>pushing</b> men swap running and <b>pushing</b> <b>the</b> car, like in a relay race, where the baton is the car. The {{competition}} rules allow only one person to <b>push</b> <b>the</b> car at a time. On the downhill part of the track ("la bassa"), where the car increase its speed, <b>the</b> <b>pusher</b> jump in <b>the</b> car behind the driver and then resumes <b>pushing</b> when <b>the</b> car speed reduces.|$|R
5|$|Reactivated {{for service}} in World War II, the corps took command of {{divisions}} in the south Pacific, leading US and Australian forces as they <b>pushed</b> <b>the</b> Japanese army out of New Guinea. It went on {{to be one of}} the principal leading elements in the Battle of Luzon, liberating the Philippines. It then took charge as one of the commanding headquarters in the occupation of Japan.|$|E
5|$|Reflective of the {{documentary}} theme, Yamaguchi saw the album expressing {{the ups and downs}} of regular days, more so than previous albums. Despite the inspiration taken from the heavy events of the earthquake, Yamaguchi felt that because the album featured three singles that were tailored to be heard by a wide audience, which <b>pushed</b> <b>the</b> album into a brighter sound.|$|E
5|$|Robert J. Slavin, O.P. {{served as}} {{president}} from 1947 to 1961. During his tenure in 1955, Providence acquired the House of Good Shepard property that <b>pushed</b> <b>the</b> original boundaries of campus to Huxley Avenue. Slavin also oversaw {{the establishment of the}} Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC) on campus in 1951, and the Liberal Arts Honors Program in 1957.|$|E

50|$|When {{the brake}} pedal {{of a modern}} vehicle with {{hydraulic}} brakes is <b>pushed</b> against <b>the</b> master cylinder, ultimately a piston <b>pushes</b> <b>the</b> brake pad against the brake disc which slows the wheel down. On the brake drum it is similar as <b>the</b> cylinder <b>pushes</b> <b>the</b> brake shoes against the drum which also slows the wheel down.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>push</b> <b>pushes</b> <b>the</b> palm {{backward}} {{through the}} water underneath the body {{at the beginning and}} {{at the side of the}} body at the end of <b>the</b> <b>push.</b>|$|R
5|$|The opening was {{rejected}} as {{too expensive to}} film; Flinn mentioned the exotic locales would have <b>pushed</b> <b>the</b> budget to $50million. While they tried {{to hold on to}} the opening as long as they could, Paramount threatened to cancel pre-production unless a few million dollars were cut from the budget.|$|E
5|$|When {{the trigger}} was pulled, the spring <b>pushed</b> <b>the</b> firing pin {{forwards}} into the bomb, which ignited the propellant in the bomb and launched {{it out of}} the trough and into the air. The recoil caused by the detonation of the propellant then blew the firing pin backwards onto the spring; this automatically cocked the weapon for subsequent shots, eliminating the need to manually re-cock.|$|E
5|$|While {{the allied}} troops {{attacked}} the French right flank, Kutuzov's IV Corp {{stopped at the}} Pratzen Heights and stayed still. Just like Napoleon, Kutuzov realized the importance of Pratzen and decided to protect the position. But the young Tsar did not, so he expelled the IV Corp from the Heights. This act quickly <b>pushed</b> <b>the</b> Allied army into her grave.|$|E
50|$|Māui {{traveled}} to the town Lahaina {{in order to meet}} his father and <b>push</b> <b>the</b> sky up. Māui then lay parallel to the sky in order to brace himself and <b>push</b> <b>the</b> sky up with his great power. Māui then gave the signal to his father to start <b>pushing</b> <b>the</b> sky up as well, and the strength of father and son together was able to <b>push</b> <b>the</b> sky up high enough {{for the people of the}} earth to be able to continue doing daily tasks. Some say if Māui and his father, Ru, had not worked together, the sky would have fallen completely and made the earth uninhabitable for humans. Thus, they saved mankind.|$|R
30|$|The {{viscoelastic}} polymer (HPAM) <b>pushes</b> <b>the</b> fluid {{ahead and}} pulls the fluids besides and behind, while the non-elastic fluids (water and glycerin) as presented in Fig.  2 are capable of <b>pushing</b> <b>the</b> fluids ahead but cannot “pull” out oil from the dead end.|$|R
50|$|From a {{conceptual}} standpoint, Newton's third law is seen {{when a person}} walks: they <b>push</b> against <b>the</b> floor, and <b>the</b> floor <b>pushes</b> against <b>the</b> person. Similarly, the tires of a car <b>push</b> against <b>the</b> road while <b>the</b> road <b>pushes</b> back on <b>the</b> tires—the tires and road simultaneously push against each other. In swimming, a person interacts with <b>the</b> water, <b>pushing</b> <b>the</b> water backward, while <b>the</b> water simultaneously <b>pushes</b> <b>the</b> person forward—both the person and <b>the</b> water <b>push</b> against each other. The reaction forces account for the motion in these examples. These forces depend on friction; a person or car on ice, for example, {{may be unable to}} exert the action force to produce the needed reaction force.|$|R
