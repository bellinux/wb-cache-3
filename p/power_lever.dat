25|$|The TBM 900 model {{features}} several ergonomic improvements within the cockpit, increasing both simplicity and automation. A new single <b>power</b> <b>lever</b> integrates the power, propeller and condition lever controls. Various switches and controls, such as some formerly present upon the overhead panel, have been eliminated. The electrical system {{is powered by}} a single main generator, which is supplemented by a belt-driven alternator. On the TBM 900, electrical load distribution changes enable the Garmin G1000 glass cockpit to power up in sync with the switch-on of the battery with little battery drain. The G1000 also has upgraded displays, including an ISA temperature deviation indication, integrated weather radar and MFD map, and automatic landing field elevation inputs to the pressurization controller.|$|E
25|$|An interim {{statement}} {{was published in}} February 2012 in line with European Union regulatory requirements. Inspection of the engines revealed that the right engine had consistently been developing up to five percent more torque than the left engine, {{as a result of}} a defective right engine intake air temperature and pressure sensor. The defective sensor meant that as well as delivering more torque than the left engine it would also respond more rapidly to commands to increase power from the engine's <b>power</b> <b>lever</b> than the left engine. The investigation also determined that both engines were developing go-around power at the moment of impact; however both engines were below flight idle power at eight to six seconds before impact. At eight seconds before impact the right engine reached a minimum of zero torque while the left engine reached −9 percent torque (which means the left propeller was driving the engine instead of the engine driving the propeller). The stall warning horn also sounded repeatedly in the seven seconds prior to impact.|$|E
2500|$|The flight {{performance}} of the DA42 is largely favourable, having been designed to incorporate not only high levels of performance but the greatest possible degrees of passive safety in operation, alongside [...] excellent fuel economy and assisted by the implementation of various modern technologies. The flight controls themselves are proportionally responsive for performing even small manoeuvers and light motions. Both pilots are equipped with their own fighter-style central sticks, which are attached to an otherwise unobstructed cockpit floor. In a similar manner, a single combined <b>power</b> <b>lever</b> is used to regulate both the engine and propeller settings; the power levers are convenient and can be operated in a relatively easy manner. In comparison with other twin-engined aircraft in its category, the centre console of the DA42 is uncluttered, which {{is a result of}} the clean design of the controls.|$|E

5000|$|The captain, faced {{now with}} a sudden time {{pressure}} and all mechanical locks being removed, and {{with his hand on}} the <b>power</b> <b>levers,</b> may have unintentionally moved the <b>power</b> <b>levers</b> further backwards, passing through the ground idle position, towards full reverse. This shift to reverse power triggered a propeller overspeed that was heard and noticed by the crew. Feeling a tremendous increase in drag and a sudden deceleration, one of the crew members retracted the flaps. The <b>power</b> <b>levers</b> were then moved forward, but it was too late. A few seconds later, the aircraft crashed into the ground.|$|R
2500|$|Flight 3943 {{departed}} Guangzhou on a 55-minute {{flight to}} Guilin. During the descent towards Guilin, {{at an altitude}} of , the captain attempted to level off the plane by raising the nose. The plane's autothrottle was engaged for descent, but the crew did not notice that the number 2 <b>power</b> <b>lever</b> was at idle. This led to an asymmetrical power condition. The airplane rolled to the right, and the crew was unable to regain control. At 07:52, the plane crashed into a mountain in the sparsely populated Guangxi region. It was the deadliest accident involving a Boeing 737-300 at the time, as well as the deadliest on Chinese soil; , it is still the second-deadliest accident in both of those categories, behind Flash Airlines Flight 604, and China Northwest Airlines Flight 2303, respectively. [...] It is also the accident with the highest number of fatalities involving a China Southern Airlines aircraft.|$|E

25|$|A {{torque split}} between the powerplants, caused by a {{defective}} Pt2/Tt2 sensor, became significant when the <b>power</b> <b>levers</b> were retarded below Flight Idle and the No. 1 powerplant entered negative torque regime. Subsequently, when the <b>power</b> <b>levers</b> were rapidly advanced during the attempted go-around, this probably further contributed to the roll behaviour as recorded on the FDR.|$|R

50|$|Noticed by the {{abnormal}} {{situation on}} the thrust lever, investigators then examined it. The power levers should have prevented to move from flight idle to ground idle during flight by the function of Electric Magnetic Lock Systems and Mechanical <b>Power</b> <b>Lever</b> Stop Slot. At the accident aircraft {{was found that the}} electric magnetic lock system (<b>Power</b> <b>Lever</b> lock) was on open position. With <b>power</b> <b>lever</b> lock on open position, the solenoid of the electric magnetic lock system disengage and allow the <b>power</b> <b>lever</b> moves to ground idle in flight whenever the mechanical <b>power</b> <b>lever</b> stop slots lifted. Based on simulator test conducted by the NTSC, if the engine entered this condition, the aircraft would lose lift and eventually descended rapidly. The movement of <b>power</b> <b>lever</b> to ground idle will result to the propeller pitch angle changes to low pitch angle which produces significant drag. The NTSC stated that because it happened on 112 ft, it was impossible to not crash.|$|E
50|$|Shock cord - This is a {{bungee cord}} with a loop {{at one end}} that permits the mounting, with a {{removable}} link, of a standard bicycle chain. The {{opposite end of the}} shock cord is normally knotted to prevent it from slipping into the <b>power</b> <b>lever.</b> The shock cord is located inside the <b>power</b> <b>lever</b> and is normally not visible unless the <b>power</b> <b>lever</b> is pulled all the way back. The shock cord loses its elasticity over time and needs to be replaced when this happens.|$|E
50|$|Investigators {{then turned}} on the pilot who flew the plane, First Officer Vunpin. First Officer Vunpin have some {{experiences}} of delay on moving the <b>power</b> <b>lever</b> to Ground Idle during landing. On the accident flight, he aware to previous experienced and lifted the mechanical <b>power</b> <b>lever</b> stop slots during approach. He realized that he retarded the <b>Power</b> <b>Lever</b> backward at about 70 ft of aircraft altitude and unintentionally entered the Beta Range. Interviews with First Officer Vunpin revealed that he have some experiences of delay on moving the <b>power</b> <b>lever</b> to Ground Idle during landing. This experience became his belief (cognitive). First Officer Vunpin has been planned to do the flight check to be qualified First Officer, {{and he wanted to}} prove that he was qualified as a First Officer. Knowing that he had repeated the errors in the past flights, he tried to prove that he had overcome his errors. However, he unintentionally moved the <b>power</b> <b>lever</b> beyond flight idle (behavioral). The aircraft lost lift and subsequently crashed.|$|E

5000|$|Wagstaff {{recalled}} Spencer {{moved the}} <b>power</b> <b>levers</b> back [...] "quite quickly‟. Shortly after the <b>power</b> <b>levers</b> {{had been moved}} back, both propellers oversped simultaneously, exceeding their maximum permitted speed of 1,200 RPM by over 60% and seriously damaging the left hand engine and rendering both engines unusable. The noise in the cockpit was deafening, rendering communication between the pilots extremely difficult, and internal damage to the engines caused smoke to enter the cockpit and cabin through the bleed air and air- conditioning systems.|$|R

50|$|Interviews from Merpati {{officials}} {{revealed that}} the first two aircraft had several problems on the <b>Power</b> <b>Lever</b> Lock System, whereas the automatic <b>power</b> <b>lever</b> lock system sometimes failed to open after landing. In May 2008, the board of instructors had agreed to revise the Normal Checklist that the Power Lock system selects to “OPEN” before landing. However, further analysis {{revealed that the}}re were no faults in the engines.|$|E
5000|$|An {{attempt to}} rectify this {{excessive}} high approach speed most likely {{resulted in the}} non compliance with the Standard Operating Procedures {{and the movement of}} the <b>power</b> <b>levers</b> below flight idle.|$|R
2500|$|The {{retardation}} of the <b>power</b> <b>levers</b> below Flight Idle, {{an action}} prohibited in flight, {{and the subsequent}} application of power {{are likely to have}} induced an uncontrollable roll rate due to asymmetric thrust and drag.|$|R
50|$|The {{investigation}} found the propellers oversped because the Captain pulled the <b>power</b> <b>levers</b> through the flight idle gate {{and into the}} ground beta range during flight. This was prohibited by the Aircraft Flight Manual. Although a 'beta lockout' mechanism did exist for DHC-8-100,-200, and -300 series aircraft which prevented the propellers from going into reverse even if the <b>power</b> <b>levers</b> were moved into the beta range during flight, this mechanism was only required by regulation to be installed in DHC-8 aircraft operating in the USA. It was not required to be fitted to DHC-8 aircraft in Papua New Guinea, {{and it was not}} fitted to MCJ. If a beta lockout mechanism had been installed on the aircraft, the double propeller overspeed would not have occurred when the <b>power</b> <b>levers</b> were moved below the flight idle range and in the ground beta range during flight. Installation of this mechanism is now mandatory on DHC-8 aircraft worldwide by 19 June 2016. If the pilots had followed the standard emergency procedures detailed in company manuals, they would have given themselves more time to manage the emergency, consider their options, and carry out the approach and forced landing.|$|R

25|$|The {{technical}} log {{for the flight}} indicated that the co-pilot was pilot flying (PF) for the flight. The CVR and ATC recordings also indicate that the co-pilot was PF during the flight. Furthermore, injuries sustained by the co-pilot to his right hand are consistent with his having been handling the aircraft {{at the time of}} impact. As no autopilot or flight director (FD) was fitted, the PF was under a high workload throughout the flight. This was especially so as three approaches were made in poor weather to below minima with two go-arounds. Normally the PF handles both flight and engine controls in a coordinated manner to achieve the required flight path; the PNF carries out other tasks including monitoring the aircraft's flight path, radio communications and keeping the flight log. The CVR indicates that the commander (PNF) took control of the <b>power</b> <b>levers</b> during final approach, this action being acknowledged by the PF. This was significant, as both <b>power</b> <b>levers</b> were subsequently retarded below Flight Idle – an action which would have been unexpected by the PF.|$|R
5000|$|The {{accident}} was {{investigated by the}} General Civil Aviation Authority. The investigation into the crash revealed that the pilots had accidentally selected the propellers to reverse thrust while still in the air. This caused the loss of control and the subsequent crash. The propellers can only move into the ground control range if the <b>power</b> <b>levers</b> are physically moved past the primary stop by a pilot.

50|$|Helicopter rotors are {{designed}} to operate at a specific rotational speed. The throttle controls {{the power of the}} engine, which is connected to the rotor by a transmission. The throttle setting must maintain enough engine power to keep the rotor speed within the limits where the rotor produces enough lift for flight. In many helicopters, the throttle control is a single or dual motorcycle-style twist grip mounted on the collective control (rotation is opposite of a motorcycle throttle), while some multi-engine helicopters have <b>power</b> <b>levers.</b>|$|R

50|$|A {{fuel control}} unit {{attempts}} to solve those problems by acting as an intermediary between the operator's controls and the fuel valve.

50|$|On a full B-47 wing {{movement}} {{exercise that}} involves flying nonstop from MacDill to Yokota Air Base, Japan, they encounter severe wind and storms. Low on fuel, they divert to Kadena Air Base, Okinawa. As they prepare to land, Dutch realizes that his shoulder injury from the B-36 crash {{was worse than}} he thought, and it is almost immobile. He is unable to operate the engine <b>power</b> <b>levers</b> (throttles) during final landing phase and has to rely on his co-pilot to do so while Dutch works the flight controls with his left arm and feet.|$|R
50|$|On {{selection}} of the <b>power</b> <b>levers</b> into the ground control range, the propeller pitch changes resulted in decrease of lift over the wing and turbulent low speed airflow over the tail plane and elevator. Coupled with other aerodynamic moments associated with lift/drag and thrust/weight coupling, the aircraft pitched down and remained in a nose low attitude. The aircraft then commenced a roll to the left most likely due to the asymmetric drag effects of the different propeller pitch angles. The left propeller then went to full reverse whilst the right propeller remained in positive pitch within the ground control range.|$|R

A significant reduction in power and significant roll to the left follows, just below 100ft, a third go-around is called by the commander which the co-pilot acknowledges. Coincident with the application of go-around power by the commander, control of the aircraft was lost. The aircraft rolls rapidly to the right beyond the vertical which brought the right wingtip {{into contact with the}} runway surface. The aircraft continued to roll and impacted the runway inverted. The stall warning sounded continuously during the final seven seconds of the CVR recording.|$|R
