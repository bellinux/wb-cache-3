This paper aimed to examine the new construct of <b>parenting</b> perfectionism, defined as perfectionism specific to the <b>parenting</b> role, through two dimensions: self-oriented, or personal desire for perfection, and societal-oriented, or perceived societal expectations for perfection. Using longitudinal data from a sample of 182 dual-earner couples at the transition to parenthood, as part of the New <b>Parents</b> Project, I investigated the association between <b>parenting</b> perfectionism and parental adjustment. Results indicate that for mothers, societal-oriented <b>parenting</b> perfectionism was associated with reduced <b>parenting</b> self-efficacy; however, self-oriented <b>parenting</b> perfectionism was associated with increased satisfaction with the <b>parenting</b> role. For fathers, societal-oriented <b>parenting</b> perfectionism was associated with higher <b>parenting</b> stress, whereas higher levels of self-oriented <b>parenting</b> perfectionism were associated with increased <b>parenting</b> self-efficacy, less <b>parenting</b> stress, and more satisfaction with <b>parenting.</b> In sum, societal-oriented <b>parenting</b> perfectionism had adverse associations with early parental adjustment, whereas self-oriented <b>parenting</b> perfectionism had beneficial associations with parental adjustment, especially for fathers...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1997 <b>Parenting</b> {{education}} {{is a process of}} providing information to <b>parents</b> on the challenges of <b>parenting,</b> services available for families, and ideas on how to interact with children. The federal Even Start family literacy program, designed to increase the educational opportunities of <b>parents</b> and children, has a strong <b>parenting</b> education component. <b>Parenting</b> information is offered through formal classes, support groups, home visits and by involving <b>parents</b> in their child's classroom. Using the life course and family system's perspective, this study examined the impact of participation in the Even Start program on parents' knowledge of <b>parenting</b> and their <b>parenting</b> practices. The study employed a pretest-posttest design and utilized quantitative and qualitative methods of data collection. In all, 74 Even Start and 26 comparison group <b>parents</b> participated. Four hypotheses were tested: (a) Even Start <b>parents</b> would make greater gains in <b>parenting</b> knowledge and practices than would comparison group parents; (b) <b>parents</b> who made gains in <b>parenting</b> knowledge and practices would have different demographic characteristics {{than those who did not}} make gains; (c) <b>parents</b> with lower depression, higher self-esteem, and greater social support would make greater gains in <b>parenting</b> knowledge and practices; and (d) programs offering more hours of <b>parenting</b> education would have <b>parents</b> making greater gains in <b>parenting</b> knowledge and practices. Quantitative results indicate that there are demographic differences at pretest and posttest in parents' scores on <b>parenting</b> knowledge and practices although there is no significant difference in score gains as the result of program participation. More positive <b>parenting</b> practices were associated at pretest and posttest with lower levels of depression.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare the <b>parenting</b> style used by {{grandparents}} in the first-time <b>parenting</b> of their children with the <b>parenting</b> style used by grandparents in the second-time <b>parenting</b> of their grandchildren. In addition, a comparison was made between first-time <b>parenting</b> and second-time <b>parenting</b> and the <b>parenting</b> style experienced by these grandparents as children in their family of origin. The Grandparents <b>Parenting</b> Grandchildren Questionnaire (GPGQ) was distributed to 505 grandparents raising grandchildren between birth and 12 years old in HARP Grandparenting Support Groups in six states. One hundred fortyfour responses were analyzed at the. 05 level of significance measuring the multivariate difference between four <b>parenting</b> styles (authoritarian, permissive, rejecting/neglecting, and authoritative). Ten grandparents were interviewed by telephone. Results 1. The multivariate difference between the <b>parenting</b> style used by grandparents in the first-time <b>parenting</b> of their own children with second-time <b>parenting</b> of grandchildren was significant. In <b>parenting</b> their own children, grandparents were more authoritarian, more rejective, and less authoritative than they were in <b>parenting</b> their grandchildren. 2. The multivariate difference between the <b>parenting</b> style used by grandparents in the first-time <b>parenting</b> as compared with their memories of the <b>parenting</b> style used in their family of origin was significant. In <b>parenting</b> their own children grandparents were found to be less authoritarian, more permissive, less rejective, and more authoritative than their <b>parents</b> were. 3. The multivariate difference between the <b>parenting</b> style used by the grandparents in the second-time <b>parenting</b> of their grandchildren and the <b>parenting</b> style experienced as children in their family of origin was significant. When <b>parenting</b> their grandchildren grandparents were found to be less authoritarian, more permissive, less rejective and more authoritative than their <b>parents</b> were. 4.
