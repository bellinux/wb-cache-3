Therefore, in 1938 a third batch of five locomotives (again named after Duchesses) was built, Nos. 6230–6234, without streamlining at an average cost of £10,659 each.|$|E
5|$|Opposition to the dam project also {{arose in}} {{concern of the}} dam's cost. Several United States congressmen and fiscal conservatives protested the {{proposal}} {{on the grounds that}} the money that would be spent on its construction would be better used to support other projects. They pointed to the lack of existing infrastructure in the region and said it was unlikely that enough electricity generated by the dam could be sold at a high enough <b>price</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> its construction.|$|E

However, Labyrinth was criticized by the three reviewers of Zzap!64.

40|$|The English National Health Service has {{replaced}} locally negotiated “block-type” contracting arrangements {{with a system}} of national <b>prices</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> hospital activity. This paper applies a transactions cost approach to quantify and analyse the nature of how contracting costs have changed as a consequence. Data collection was based on semi-structured interviews with key stakeholders from hospitals and Primary Care Trusts, which purchase hospital services. Replacing block contracting with casemix funding has led to lower costs of contract negotiation, but these are outweighed by higher costs of data collection, contract monitoring, and contract enforcement. There was consensus that the new contractual arrangements were preferable, but the benefits {{will have to be}} demonstrated formally in future...|$|R
500|$|In March 1540, Charles {{proposed}} {{to settle the}} matter by having Maria of Spain marry Francis's younger son, the Duke of Orléans; the two would then inherit the Netherlands, Burgundy, and Charolais after the Emperor's death. [...] Francis, meanwhile, was to renounce his claims to the duchies of Milan and Savoy, ratify the treaties of Madrid and Cambrai, and join an alliance with Charles. [...] Francis, considering the loss of Milan too large a <b>price</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> future possession of the Netherlands and unwilling to ratify the treaties in any case, made his own offer; on 24 April, he agreed to surrender the Milanese claim in exchange for immediate receipt of the Netherlands.

500|$|When Smythe {{bought the}} Leafs, he {{promised that the}} team would win the Stanley Cup within five years. [...] To that end, Smythe wanted {{to bring in a}} star player to help his team. In 1930, with the Senators {{struggling}} financially due to the Great Depression, they put King Clancy up for sale. Smythe's partners could only offer $25,000 for Ottawa's defensive star, one-half of Ottawa's asking price. In an attempt to raise money, Smythe entered a thoroughbred racing horse he owned, Rare Jewel, in the Coronation Futurity Stakes at odds of 106–1. [...] Rare Jewel won the race, earning Smythe over $15,000. [...] Smythe then acquired Clancy for $35,000 and two players worth $15,000, which was an unprecedented <b>price</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> one player. [...] It was also the only race Rare Jewel ever won.|$|E
500|$|Much of one book, The English Landscape (1938), had {{previously}} appeared in various issues of Country Life magazine, {{and in part}} echoed concerns raised by Clough Williams-Ellis in works such as England and the Octopus (1928). Williams-Ellis believed that building on greenfield land was too great a <b>price</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> socio-economic progress. Beach Thomas argued in favour of protecting open spaces by creating national parks, for which {{he thought that the}} coastline would be the most suitable candidate. He stressed the relationship between the people and the land and saw a need for planning control to manage human ingress into areas that remained mostly untouched. [...] In 1934 he supported the Nature Lovers Association in their appeal to make the mountainous Snowdonia region, near the coast of North Wales, such an entity. He also supported the Commons, Open Spaces and Footpaths Preservation Society.|$|E
40|$|Ramsey pricing {{has been}} {{proposed}} in the pharmaceutical industry as a principle <b>to</b> <b>price</b> discriminate among markets while allowing to recover the (fixed) R&D cost. However, such analyses neglect the presence of insurance or the fund raising costs for most of drug reimbursement. By incorporat-ing these new elements, we aim at providing some building blocks towards an economic theory incorporating Ramsey pricing and insurance coverage. We show how coinsurance affects the optimal <b>prices</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> the R&D in-vestment. We also show that under certain conditions, there is no strategic incentive by governments to set coinsurance rates in order to shift the finan-cial burden of R&D.

500|$|Aside from common {{criticism}} {{aimed at}} Carey's lack of vocal bombast, many made heavy comparisons to its predecessor, [...] "We Belong Together". Freedom Du Lac from The Washington Post compared the two heavily, while PopMatters's Evan Sawdey {{felt it was}} [...] "stealing the structure that made 'We Belong Together' such a great song." [...] In his critique, he continued [...] "For being an album {{from one of the}} world's biggest pop stars, its amazing how hook-free and dated if feels a mere two weeks after its release." [...] Slant Magazines critic and writer, Sal Cinquemani, wrote that the single [...] "isn't exactly filled with combustible energy and it lacks the full-throttle belting that accompanied the Return of the Voice three years ago, but it features all of the characteristics one expects from a latter-day Mariah track." [...] Rachel Devitt of Rhapsody expressed a desire to see Carey [...] "show off those legendary five octaves a bit more", while also noting the song's [...] "slightly paranoid/just-this-side-of-crazy lyrics threatening to hunt down her lover if he videos their tryst."

500|$|The {{performance}} of the Australian and Allied forces committed to the defence of shipping on the Australia station was mixed. While the threat to Australia from Axis raiders was [...] "anticipated and addressed", only {{a small proportion of}} the Axis ships and submarines which attacked Australia were successfully located or engaged. Several German raiders operated undetected within Australian waters in 1940 as the number of Allied warships and aircraft available were not sufficient to patrol these waters and the loss of HMAS Sydney was a high <b>price</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> sinking Kormoran in 1941. While the Australian authorities were quick to implement convoys in 1942 and no convoyed ship was sunk during that year, the escorts of the convoys that were attacked in 1943 were not successful in either detecting any submarines before they launched their attack or successfully counter-attacking these submarines. Factors explaining the relatively poor {{performance of}} Australian anti-submarine forces include their typically low levels of experience and training, shortages of ASW assets, problems with co-ordinating searches and the poor sonar conditions in the waters surrounding Australia. Nevertheless, [...] "success in anti-submarine warfare cannot be measured simply by the total of sinkings achieved" [...] and the Australian defenders may have successfully reduced the threat to shipping in Australian waters by making it harder for Japanese submarines to carry out attacks.|$|E
500|$|Tender Mercies {{received}} mostly positive reviews. Richard Corliss of Time {{declared it}} the [...] "best American {{movie of the}} new year". Carol Olten of The San Diego Union-Tribune declared Tender Mercies the best movie of 1983, and [...] "the most poignant, but forthright, film of the year, with a brilliant performance by Robert Duvall". Janet Maslin of The New York Times wrote, [...] "This is a small, lovely and somewhat overloaded film about small-town life, loneliness, country music, marriage, divorce and parental love, and it deals {{with all of these}} things in equal measure. Still, the absence of a single, sharply dramatic story line is a relatively small <b>price</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> the plainness and clarity with which these other issues are defined." [...] She also praised Beresford's direction, which she said lent the movie a light touch. The Times Canby wrote, [...] "In all respects Tender Mercies is so good that it has the effect of rediscovering a kind of film fiction that has been debased over the decades by hack moviemakers, working according to accepted formulas, frequently to the applause of the critics as well as the public." [...] Leonard Maltin gave it three out of four stars, applauding Duvall in particular and describing it as a [...] "winning but extremely low-key film", though he characterized Foote's screenplay as [...] "not so much a story as a series of vignettes". David Sterritt of The Christian Science Monitor praised the film for its values, for underscoring the good in people and for avoiding flashiness and quick cuts in favor of a subtle and deliberately paced story, while maintaining a PG rating and omitting sex, drugs and violence. He also felt, however, that it tended toward melodrama on a few occasions and that the soundtrack had [...] "a bit of syrupy music ... especially at the end".|$|E

Additionally, many of the videos contain short storylines, some of which use symbolism to convey their respective messages. The video of [...] "Voyage" [...] depicts Hamasaki as {{a woman in a}} mental hospital whose previous incarnation was a woman in feudal Japan who was sacrificed to the moon; the video of [...] "Endless Sorrow" [...] features a young boy living in a society where speaking is forbidden by law.
