40|$|Contingency {{learning}} {{is fundamental to}} cognition. Knowledge about environmental contingencies allows behavioral flexibility, as executive control processes accommodate the demands of novel or changing environments. Studies of experiential learning {{have focused on the}} relationship between actions and the values of associated outcomes. However, outcome values have often been confounded with the physical changes in the outcomes themselves. Here, we dissociated contingency learning into valuative and non-valuative forms, using a novel version of the two-alternative choice task, while measuring the neural effects of contingency changes using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Changes in value-relevant contingencies evoked activation in the lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC), posterior parietal cortex (PPC), and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC) consistent with prior results (e. g., reversal-learning paradigms). Changes in <b>physical</b> <b>contingencies</b> unrelated to value or to action produced similar activations within the LPFC, indicating that LPFC may engage in generalized contingency learning that is not specific to valuation. In contrast, contingency changes that required behavioral shifts evoked activation localized to the DMPFC, supplementary motor, and precentral cortices, suggesting that these regions play more specific roles within the executive control of behavior...|$|E
40|$|Educational {{research}} {{is of course}} affected by the economic, institutional and <b>physical</b> <b>contingencies</b> of its time, and in our time it is increasingly driven by them. Much {{can be said about}} this; and perhaps it might be suspected that {{there is a tendency to}} ignore or suppress how research, and not only in education, is so affected. Such suspicion however risks feeding the strand in the tradition of thought that urges aspiration to Thought Itself, untrammelled by mundane considerations. Since philosophy is prominent in that tradition it is salutary that increased notice is these days being taken of its own rootedness in the material, including textuality, whose acknowledgement is to various degrees found in the writings of, among others, Montaigne, Descartes and Plato himself – particularly salutary in their cases because the tradition so often places them among advocates of Pure Thought and withdrawal from the world. Both that tradition and the relatively new material drivers of academic research need to be treated with a proper irony. That, more than anything, keeps open the possibility of independent thought...|$|E
40|$|Background: In {{the context}} of {{interacting}} activities requiring close-body contact such as fighting or dancing, the actions of one agent {{can be used to}} predict the actions of the second agent [1]. In the present study, we investigated whether interpersonal predictive coding extends to interactive activities – such as communicative interactions- in which no <b>physical</b> <b>contingency</b> is implied between the movements of the interacting individuals. Methodology/Principal Findings: Participants observed point-light displays of two agents (A and B) performing separate actions. In the communicative condition, the action performed by agent B responded to a communicative gesture performed by agent A. In the individual condition, agent A’s communicative action was substituted with a noncommunicative action. Using a simultaneous masking detection task, we demonstrate that observing the communicative gesture performed by agent A enhanced visual discrimination of agent B. Conclusions/Significance: Our finding complements and extends previous evidence for interpersonal predictive coding, suggesting that the communicative gestures of one agent can serve as a predictor for the expected actions of th...|$|R
40|$|The {{process of}} cost {{modeling}} using risk analysis for construction projects is very {{crucial for the}} achievement of project success. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to present an analysis of the financial impact of risk factors affecting key construction work sections; using a systematic risk methodology based on empirical judgment. The failure mode effect analysis (FMEA) and the evidential reasoning methods are presented as qualitative and quantitative risk tools respectively. Data analysis from structured questionnaires revealed that four work sections are prone to high scope changes contemporaneous with seven risk factors. Contrary to the usual 10 % contingency estimate allowed for construction projects in Ghana, an approximate overall <b>physical</b> <b>contingency</b> range of between 13. 36 % and 17. 88 % was determined using evidential reasoning methods. The likely impact of the integrated work sections and risk factors provide a clue to estimators on how to estimate and account for project cost contingency. The research concludes by recommending a framework for improving the estimation process of cost contingency through the integration of efficient risk management strategies, cost estimation and design management process...|$|R

The ran-domly selected 1, 097 (boys = 342, girls = 755) youth reported their duration, fre-quency, and intensity of physical activity and also indicated their strength of motiva-tion in relation to <b>physical</b> activity. Two-way <b>contingency</b> table analyses and t tests revealed that the strength of motivation for physical activity was significantly and positively related to active participation...|$|R
30|$|System {{protection}} schemes (SPSs), {{also known}} as remedial action schemes (RASs) or system integrity protection schemes (SIPSs), are a natural candidate for studying CPS reliability in a well-defined context. SPSs are designed to detect abnormal power system conditions and initiate predetermined corrective actions to mitigate their impact [5]. SPS interventions include changes in load, generation, or system topology; these are usually triggered by the remote detection of contingencies, mediated by information communications technology (ICT) infrastructure. In other words, events originate in the <b>physical</b> domain (initiating <b>contingencies),</b> traverse the cyber domain (control logic and signals) {{and return to the}} physical domain (interventions in the power system).|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Humanizing birth means {{considering}} women's values, beliefs, {{and feelings}} and respecting their dignity and autonomy during the birthing process. Reducing over-medicalized childbirths, empowering {{women and the}} use of evidence-based maternity practice are strategies that promote humanized birth. Nevertheless, the territory of birth and its socio-cultural values and beliefs concerning child bearing can deeply affect birthing practices. The present study aims to explore the Japanese child birthing experience in different birth settings where the humanization of childbirth has been indentified among the priority goals of the institutions concerned, and also to explore the obstacles and facilitators encountered in the practice of humanized birth in those centres. Methods A qualitative field research design was used in this study. Forty four individuals and nine institutions were recruited. Data was collected through observation, field notes, focus groups, informal and semi-structured interviews. A qualitative content analysis was performed. Results All the settings had implemented strategies aimed at reducing caesarean sections, and keeping childbirth as natural as possible. The barriers and facilitators encountered in the practice of humanized birth were categorized into four main groups: rules and strategies, <b>physical</b> structure, <b>contingency</b> factors, and individual factors. The most important barriers identified in humanized birth care were the institutional rules and strategies that restricted the presence of a birth companion. The main facilitators were women's own cultural values and beliefs in a natural birth, and institutional strategies designed to prevent unnecessary medical interventions. Conclusions The Japanese birthing institutions which have identified as part of their mission to instate humanized birth have, as a whole, been successful in improving care. However, barriers remain to achieving the ultimate goal. Importantly, the cultural values and beliefs of Japanese women regarding natural birth is an important factor promoting the humanization of childbirth in Japan. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{crowd of}} Yogyakarta urban has {{impacted}} its surrounding area, including Depok sub district, which {{is indicated by}} the rising of physical development, for example education facilities and settlements. The progress does not only bring positive impact, but also negative impact for instance the rising of crime number i. e. motor vehicle robbery. The aims of this research are 1) mapping motor vehicle robbery data as the distribution map and identifying motor vehicle robbery hot spot base on distrbution map; and 2) studying the correlation of motor vehicle robbery hot spot with physical environment phenomena, i. e. land use type and settlement pattern. The research method consists of two parts; they are motor vehicle robbery cluster analysis and the relation of motor vehicle robbery and physical environment analysis. Motor vehicle robbery cluster analysis is using distribution data, which analyzes the distribution into motor vehicle robbery hot spot with nearest neighbor tehnique. Contingency coefficient and frequency distribution analysis is {{used to analyze the}} correlation of motor vehicle robbery hot spot and <b>physical</b> environment. <b>Contingency</b> coefficient is used to study the relation of motor vehicle robbery hot spot polygon with physical environment condition, whereas frequency distribution is used to study the distribution of motor vehicle robbery in the hot spot with physical environment condition. Physical environment which consists of land use type, housing density, house regularity pattern, and the average of building size, are obtained from interpretation of black and white panchromatic aerial photograph year 2000, in the scale 1 : 20. 000. the most motor vehicle robbery hot spot is found on the settlement area, 68, 3 % from 378 motor vehicle robbery cases in the hot spot. The seond level is found on the education area (16. 4 %). The most motor vehicle hot spot in the settlement is found on the hight density and irregular settlement, which have big size buildings. The calculation of contingency coefficient shows that there was a significant correlation between motor vehicle robbery hot spot with land use type and settlement pattern, but it has low correlation value. It means that land use type and settlement pattern have weak influence to the hot spot existence...|$|R
