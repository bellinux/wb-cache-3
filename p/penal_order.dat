The author presents the evolution of the <b>penal</b> <b>order</b> in Serbia from 2001 to 2011. He points to some legal innovations in this field during that decennium. He compares old and new legal provisions about <b>penal</b> <b>order</b> and finds some differences. There is a constant tendency to expanding the area of criminal offences which can be judged in this procedural form. New legal provisions are, in general, better than previous.

In general, the <b>penal</b> <b>order</b> represents a legal institute, which is used by bodies responsible for criminal proceedings, mostly by court, to offer, upon their findings, interested parties to solve a criminal case of low seriousness without having public hearings before a court. The proposal is submitted in writing and contains at least a verdict of guilty and sanction verdict. If the interested parties agree with the submitted proposal, expressly or tacitly, the proposal will be legally binding. The <b>penal</b> <b>order</b> may be also considered a type of decision in criminal proceedings, which has its dual nature. At first, it is a procedural offer made to an accused, and i fit is accepted, then the <b>penal</b> <b>order</b> transforms itself into a decision on merits. The thesis is divided into four chapters: In the first chapter the emphasis is put on an introduction of the <b>penal</b> <b>order</b> in a broader context with aim to subscribe its purpose and I try to subsume it under such terms as judicial decision, special type of proceedings and diversion. The second chapter {{is dedicated to the}} historical development of legal regulation of the [...] ...|$|E

40|$|The legal {{solutions}} adapted in {{the penal}} and fiscal code concerning proceedings by police <b>penal</b> <b>orders</b> are an innovative regulation in the penal and fiscal matters adapted {{for the first}} time in this area of the Polish law. An analysis of the regulations allows to arrive at the conclusion that proceedings by police <b>penal</b> <b>orders</b> can be conducted only in the case of fiscal violations where there occurs no doubt as to the violating party and the circumstances of the act and the act can be classified as punishable with a fine no larger than double the value of the minimum monthly wages. In principle, fines in such proceedings are imposed by the financial investigating organ, and if any legal provisions stipulate so, also by a non-financial investigating organ. The appropriate investigating organ can conduct proceedings by police <b>penal</b> <b>orders</b> only if such proceedings are permissible, i. e. all the necessary particular conditions are met. The provisions of the penal and fiscal code mention two types of penal fines. The first one, cash fine, is issued to the penalized party after a direct payment of the imposed penalty to the investigating organ or its representative. The second type, loan fine is delivered on acknowledgement to the penalized party. A cash penalty can be imposed on individuals temporarily visiting the territory of the Republic of Poland as well as permanent residents of Poland temporarily leaving its territory. The regulations of the penal and fiscal code in the studies scope still, however, raise some doubts. However, one should emphasise that the draft amendment of the penal and fiscal code due to enter into force in the second half of the present year takes into consideration most of the modifications postulated by the doctrine. The author cherishes hope that the presented study results supported by the subject literature will help both practitioners and theoreticians apply and understand the solutions of the penal and fiscal code in the presented scope...|$|R

The analysis and evaluation {{has been based on}} empirical research conducted in three district courts (Bydgoszcz, Toruń, Iława). The research included 592 cases with 666 penal orders. The cases examined according to <b>penal</b> <b>order</b> proceedings constituted ca. 6 % of all criminal cases. They were concerned with the so-called trivial crime, directed mostly against property. The research provided grounds to formulate several reservations concerning the courts practice of estabilishing the existence of one of the conditions of admissibility of <b>penal</b> <b>order</b> proceedings, namely that the circumstances relating to the commission of an act and guilt are beyond doubt. Moreover, reservations arose also with respect to negative prerequisites for <b>penal</b> <b>order</b> proceedings. Most schortcomings were noted with respect to the process of establishing the presence of good reasons to doubt sanity of an accused. The analysis of the participation of the parties in hearings confirmed that in <b>penal</b> <b>order</b> proceedings the principles of directness, openness and of adversary trial system are absent, for in most instances the parties were not notified of the date of a court session. The examination of the contents of penal orders revealed that a prevailing penalty was a fine. Besides, the courts too often applied the additional penalty of publication of the <b>penal</b> <b>order.</b> As few as 13 % of penal orders were subject to objection, with only 7 % of penal orders objected to by the accused and their counsels.

Such phenomena include the politicisation of law and order, increases in maximum sentences, prison expansionism, the curtailment of judicial discretion in certain circumstances, legislative control of groups such as convicted sex offenders, a developing pro-victim/witness momentum, and the increased dissociation of the offender from the state and society.

Russia's penal system remains under-researched in socio-legal and criminological scholarship. This contribution is the first multi-disciplinary study of Russian imprisonment to be conducted in the post-Soviet period, bringing together criminology, human geography and law. The collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 was a landmark moment in Russia's penal trajectory due to the excessive scale and use of imprisonment as a political and cultural corrective. Our findings reveal the punishment of young women in Russia as exceptional and exclusionary. Personnel {{play a crucial role}} in shaping penal strategies that encourage young women to adopt blame and shame sensibilities. We develop a conceptualization of Russian penality as it relates to young women prisoners. We argue that the prisoner transport is the first stage in a continuum where gender, <b>penal</b> <b>order</b> and culture come together come together to create a specific penological place identity, which we conceptualize as Malaya Rodina (Little Homeland).

40|$|The Dutch {{procedure}} for {{the enforcement of}} small traffic offences, codified in the Mulder Act, is internationally known for being extremely efficient. On {{the basis of the}} Mulder Act, police officers and special investigating officers have the competence to impose administrative fines if they detect the violation of small traffic offences listed in the Act. The Mulder Act also regulates the competence to sanction the holder of a registration number of a car and find him liable for small traffic offences presumably committed with his car, even if he has not committed the offence himself. Despite the efficient enforcement proceedings, {{it is important to keep}} a critical eye on the recent developments towards a more efficient settlement of criminal cases. The recently adopted <b>Penal</b> <b>Order</b> Act has given public prosecutors the competence to sanction criminal offences which carry a statutory maximum sentence of six years.

40|$|Sensationalised {{attention}} to women’s {{crime and violence}} is a recurring feature in popular media. While skyrocketing rates of arrest and imprisonment (Lawston 110) seem to reflect the popular perception that women’s crime is on the increase, research evidence points to shifting criminal justice and welfare practices as the primary causes rather than significant changes in crime itself (Malloch and McIvor 3). Despite prurient interest in women {{in conflict with the}} law, practitioners and advocates in some countries have recognised that prison is an inappropriate response to women’s law breaking for decades (Beglan 252, Lawston 117). Accordingly, they have worked to reform <b>penal</b> practices in <b>order</b> to ameliorate the harms of imprisonment and have begun to build alternative programs to divert women out of the prison pipeline into community‐based programs. The growth of community‐based sanctions and gender responsive policies has coincided with the global financial crisis and at times dovetailed neatly with retrenchment efforts.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to offer an analysis of the major conceptual and ethical problems facing penal substitution insofar as it is utilized as an explanatory feature of Christ 2 ̆ 7 s contribution to divine-human reconciliation. I present fourteen problems and argue that penal substitution can overcome these problems by embracing a 2 ̆ 2 divine-manifest offering 2 ̆ 2 approach to atonement. On this approach, God mercifully chooses to require satisfaction for sin through <b>penal</b> substitution in <b>order</b> to give God 2 ̆ 7 s Self the opportunity to meet this requirement by satisfaction through penal self-substitution. This divine self-substitution is intended by God to elicit a free human response of openness to a personal relationship of mutual love with God. Its effectiveness in drawing humans to such a relationship with God is a result of its ability to create obstacles to human persistence in alienation (e. g. demonstrating the danger of sin and the value of God 2 ̆ 7 s offer of personal reconciliation), to remove obstacles to human appropriation of divine forgiveness (e. g. a subjective perception of shame, doubt of divine justice, doubt of divine love towards humans), and to motivate humans toward divine-human personal reconciliation with a display of the depth of God 2 ̆ 7 s love for humans...|$|R
40|$|It is {{a common}} {{phenomenon}} {{in the community that}} there are legal bindings which seem to have the characteristics of civil law (individual contract), but they actually indicate the characteristics of criminal conducts. This is because the contracts are only used as covers for crimes, such as falsification of documents, embezzlement and fraud.
