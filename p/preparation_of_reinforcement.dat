The tradeoff in preferences between magnitude <b>of</b> <b>reinforcement,</b> delay to <b>reinforcement,</b> and probability <b>of</b> <b>reinforcement</b> {{is a fundamental}} concern in the decision making literature. Yet, the relative impacts <b>of</b> probability <b>of</b> <b>reinforcement,</b> delay to <b>reinforcement,</b> and magnitude <b>of</b> <b>reinforcement</b> have not been studied together even though researchers have been advocating for the combined study of these variables for decades.

In Experiment 3, 14 rats responded under either a multiple fixed-ratio schedule or a multiple fixed-interval schedule, each with two components that differed in rate <b>of</b> <b>reinforcement.</b> In Experiment 4, 7 pigeons responded under either a multiple fixed-ratio or a multiple fixed-interval schedule, each with three components that also differed in rate <b>of</b> <b>reinforcement.</b> Under each condition of each experiment, resistance to change was studied by measuring schedule-controlled performance under conditions with prefeeding, response-independent food during the schedule or during timeouts that separated components of the multiple schedules, and by measuring behavior under extinction. There were no consistent differences between rats and pigeons. There was no direct relationship between rates <b>of</b> <b>reinforcement</b> and resistance to change when rates <b>of</b> <b>reinforcement</b> varied across successive conditions in the simple schedules.
