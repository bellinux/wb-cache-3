40|$|Recognizing {{the chronic}} {{imbalance}} between bandwidth and latency, {{and how to}} cope with it. As I review performance trends, I am struck by a consistent theme across many technologies: bandwidth improves much more quickly than latency. Here, I list a half-dozen <b>performance</b> <b>milestones</b> to document this observation, many reasons why it happens, a few ways to cope with it, a rule of thumb to quantify it, plus an example of how to design systems differently based on this observation. Table 1 identifies four to six <b>performance</b> <b>milestones</b> over the last 20 to 25 years for microprocessors, memory, networks, and disks. The microprocessor milestones are six generations of IA- 32 processors, going from a 16 -bit bus, microcoded 80286 to a 64 bit bus, superscalar, out-of-order execution, superpipelined Pentium 4. Memory module milestones go from 16 -bit wide, plain DRAM to 64 -bit wide double data rate synchronous DRAM. Ethernet advanced from 10 Mbps to 10 Gbps. Disk milestones are based on rotation speed, improving from 3600 RPM to 15000 RPM. In each case we record best-case bandwidth and record latency as the time for a simple operation assuming there is no contention. Figure 1 plots the relative improvement in band-width and latency for each of those milestones. Performance is the primary differentiator for microprocessors and networks, so they have seen the greatest gains: 1000 – 2000 X in bandwidth and 20 – 40 X in latency. Capacity is generally more important than performance for memory and disks, so capacity has improved most, yet their bandwidth advances are still much greater than their gains in latency. Clearly, bandwidth has outpaced latency across these technologies. To find a rule of thumb to quantify the trends, Table 2 summarizes the average improvement for each of these technologies. The first three rows give the annual rate of improvement in latency, capacity, and bandwidth. The next row shows how many years i...|$|E

SESAM modelocked thin disk lasers (TDLs) currently achieve higher pulse energies and average powers than any other ultrafast oscillator technology, making them excellent candidates in this goal. Recently, 275 W of average power with a pulse duration of 583 fs were demonstrated, which represents the highest average power so far demonstrated from an ultrafast oscillator. In terms of pulse energy, TDLs reach more than 40 µJ pulses directly from the oscillator.

ABSTRACT:This paper is concerned with strengthening the relevance, effectiveness, and responsiveness of national transport policy to deliver national demands and targets for accelerated and shared economic growth in South Africa. Its objective is to analyse the linkage and gaps in the White Paper on National Transport Policy of South Africa (1996), and the Accelerated and Shared Economic Growth Initiative of South Africa [ASGISA] (2006). Its {{focus is on the}} national transport policy. It found that the national transport policy is well aligned to contemporary thought and practice in transport. It shares and addresses with ASGISA the same Reconstruction and Development Program (RDP) national developmental objectives, constraints and interventions. However, it does not mainstream the national growth <b>performance</b> targets and <b>milestones,</b> and poverty reduction, which constitute the basis of ASGISA. It concludes that the policy has gaps or weakness, which stem from not aligning to crucial national strategic growth <b>performance</b> targets and <b>milestones</b> of ASGISA.

Advances in deep learning {{over the last few years}} have produced major speech recognition improvements on the representative Switchboard conversational corpus. Word error rates that just a few years ago were 14 % have dropped to 8. 0 %, then 6. 6 % and most recently 5. 8 %, and are now believed to be within striking range of human performance. This then raises two issues - what IS human performance, and how far down can we still drive speech recognition error rates? A recent paper by Microsoft suggests that we have already achieved human performance. In trying to verify this statement, we performed an independent set of human performance measurements on two conversational tasks and found that human performance may be considerably better than what was earlier reported, giving the community a significantly harder goal to achieve. We also report on our own efforts in this area, presenting a set of acoustic and language modeling techniques that lowered the word error rate of our own English conversational telephone LVCSR system to the level of 5. 5 %/ 10. 3 % on the Switchboard/CallHome subsets of the Hub 5 2000 evaluation, which - at least at the writing of this paper - is a new <b>performance</b> <b>milestone</b> (albeit not at what we measure to be human performance!).

Such protocols usually aim at the minimisation of communication overhead, data processing for the participating nodes and delivering adequate tracking information of the mobile assets in a timely manner. Simulations on such protocols are performed using theoretical models that are based on unrealistic assumptions like the unit disc graph communication model, ideal network localisation and perfect distance estimations.

Some dispositional qualities, like mindfulness, may protect against burnout. The {{purpose of the present}} study was to assess burnout prevalence among internal medicine residents at a single institution, examine the relationship between mindfulness and burnout, and provide preliminary findings on the relation between burnout and performance evaluations in internal medicine residents. Methods: Residents (n = 38) completed validated measures of burnout at three time points separated by 2 months and a validated measure of dispositional mindfulness at baseline. Program director end-of-year performance evaluations were also obtained on 22 milestones used to evaluate internal medicine resident performance; notably, these milestones have not yet been validated for research purposes; therefore, the investigation here is exploratory. Results: Overall, 71. 1 % (n = 27) of the residents met criteria for burnout during the study. Lower scores on the “acting with awareness” facet of dispositional mindfulness significantly predicted meeting burnout criteria χ 2 (5) = 11. 88, p = 0. 04. Lastly, meeting burnout criteria significantly predicted performance on three of the <b>performance</b> <b>milestones,</b> with positive effects on milestones from the “system-based practices” and “professionalism” domains and negative effects on a milestone from the “patient care” domain. Conclusion: Burnout rates were high in this sample of internal medicine residents and rates were consistent with other reports of burnout during medical residency. Dispositional mindfulness was supported as a protective factor against burnout. Importantly, results from the exploratory investigation of the relationship between burnout and resident evaluations suggested that burnout may improve performance on some domains of resident evaluations while compromising performance on other domains.

40|$|This {{research}} study explores the integration, {{the degree of}} implementation of Lean and Agile improvement initiatives {{and their impact on}} business performance in Apparel export industry of Pakistan. Lean and Agile improvement initiatives have emerged as 21 st century manufacturing paradigms. Lean and Agile Manufacturing are well recognized as improvement initiatives in the field of Operations' Management that organizations pursuit to achieve competitiveness. An explicit understanding of inter-relationship of these improvement initiatives still lacks in the field of Operations Management and vagueness exists, whether Lean (Total Quality Management & Just-in-Time) and Agile Manufacturing are mutually supportive, mutually exclusive or one is antecedent to the other. Moreover, if antecedent to each other, then question arises which component is antecedent to the other? A 3 -Stage Conceptual Framework is proposed to investigate the inter-relationship between Lean (Total Quality Management & Just-in-Time) and Agile Manufacturing and their impact on business performance in Apparel export industry of Pakistan. The proposed conceptual framework incorporates management and common infrastructure (internal and external) practices required to enable core Lean (Total Quality Management & Just-in-Time) and Core Agile Manufacturing. Stage- 1 is organization culture stage, stage- 2 is core manufacturing and stage- 3 constitutes of business performance measures. A set of Management, Common Infrastructure (internal and external) practices, and Core Total Quality Management, Core Just-in-Time and Core Agile Manufacturing practices is identified through literature review. The proposed framework fit is assessed by employing three forms (Universal, Contingency and Configurational perspectives) of fit. A survey from 248 Apparel export firms of Pakistan is performed to test empirical validity of the conceptual framework. Multi-items constructs already developed are used to measure these practices. Moreover, Core Agile Manufacturing construct comprising three sub-dimensions (Change Proficiency, Knowledge Management and Advance Manufacturing Technology) is developed and its psychometric properties are empirically validated. The proposed framework fitness, employing five forms of fit (Direct Covariation, Mediation, Moderation, Profile Deviation and Gestalt), is tested using multiple analysis methods like Structural Equation Modeling (Covariance Base and Partial Least Squares) for direct covariation, indirect covariation (mediation) and moderation fit, multiple regression analysis for profile deviation fit and discriminant analysis for gestalt fit. At macro level, the proposed framework is partially modified as Core Just-in-Time practices fail to directly link with Core Agile Manufacturing practices. However, the same is redirected through common external infrastructure practices based on theoretical justification. Moreover, core Total Quality Management and Core Just-in-Time practices fail to contribute directly in Operational Performance, nonetheless, Core Agile Manufacturing practices positively mediate the same relationship. At micro level, top management commitment, inward focus (strategic vision and planning, employees training and empowerment, information system), outward focus (relationship with customer and suppliers), and Core Agile Manufacturing (change proficiency, knowledge management and advance manufacturing technology) significantly differentiate between high and low performers. Modified framework is also tested under organizational and business environmental contexts. Firm size, ISO- 9001 Registration, competitive pressures, market dynamics and technological turbulence moderate the mutual relationship among management, common infrastructure (internal and external), and core manufacturing practices and impact on business performance. The final 3 -stage empirically validated framework provides a strategic direction, at macro (system) and micro (sub-system) level, to the managers of Apparel export industry of Pakistan in particular, and manufacturing managers in general, to remain competitive and achieve business <b>performance</b> <b>milestones</b> (Operational Performance, Market Performance & Financial Performance). Overall, this {{research study}} resolves the long outstanding and conflicting issue in the field of Operations' Management and provides a detailed theoretical and empirical justification for Lean (Total Quality Management & Just-in-Time) and Agile Manufacturing implementation under universal, contingency and configurational perspectives in Apparel export industry of Pakistan. Moreover, this study contributes in the field of Operations' Management explicitly establishing that Core Lean (Total Quality Management & Just-in-Time) is antecedent to Core Agile Manufacturing and both paradigms in combination increase business performance in combination increase business performanc...|$|E
30|$|From the {{scientific}} point of view, it becomes feasible to compare cases, scale <b>performances,</b> give <b>milestones</b> to achieve to trainees, and set some norms {{in a rather}} systematic way. Meanwhile, statistical methods may generate reliable time prediction on the go. The working flow for that high-volume surgery can be optimized at the hospital scale, like any other industrial process. This simple example shows the potential, limit, and ethical {{issues raised by the}} synergy of surgery with computational methods. The digital revolution has arrived in surgery and has combined imaging, procedural guidance, virtual reality, miniaturization, and all spectra of new data from physiological to molecular through genetic. This digital revolution has occurred much later than in other professions such as aviation or banking. A new opportunity will be to establish a scientific cooperation between SC and CS that would make the new transition the most beneficial for patients. The next question that we will discuss is how one may combine of all these sources of information to deliver a more sophisticated prediction of surgery outcomes.|$|R

The first component is to measure development progress against strategic reconstruction objectives and provide insights into how to improve <b>performance</b> against the <b>milestones</b> set by the Government of Afghanistan and the international donors. The second component is to train and mentor a pool of Afghan researchers to conduct research consistent with internationally recognized standards for social scientific research. Research at APPRO is undertaken to address existing and pressing knowledge gaps in the policy making process and to advance the learning of researchers, academics, and decision and policy makers at all levels.|$|R

Center Stage is a delightful treat {{and will be a}} considered a classic years down the road, on that you can be sure." [...] Billboard clarifies, [...] "It's not that she has refashioned her vocal approach -- it remains an affecting ballad voice. But it's employed in the interest here of classy, mostly rarely recorded ballads from the world of musical theater." [...] They conclude, [...] "Reddy makes daring choices throughout this album and meets the challenge every time." ...|$|R
