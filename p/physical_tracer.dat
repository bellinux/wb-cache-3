With all samplers, phage kill was highest at 85 % relative humidity and lowest at 55 % relative humidity.

To explore the effects of gravity and species-specific lung geometry, we compared to the results obtained in a quadruped mammal (dogs) also in the supine position. We found that the {{spatial distribution of}} PulmoBind was heterogeneous with a predominant uptake in the more gravity-dependent dorsal and caudal regions of supine humans. There was consequently pronounced dorsoventral and caudocranial gradients of perfusion. There was also a milder mediolateral gradient. In supine dogs, the distribution of PulmoBind showed similar gradients, but of greater magnitude. Our findings therefore confirm the presence of a postural perfusion gradient, in the direction of gravity, present in both humans and in quadrupeds lying supine.|$|R

By using a six-jet Collison nebulizer, the mixture was aerosolized into a 300 -liter stainless-steel rotating (4 rpm) drum. The temperature of the air inside the drum was kept at 20 +/- 1 degrees C, and the virus aerosols were held at the following three levels of relative humidity (RH) : low (30 +/- 5 %), medium (50 +/- 5 %), and high (80 +/- 5 %). An all-glass impinger, containing 10. 0 ml of tryptose phosphate broth with antifoam, was used to collect samples of air from the drum. Both viruses were propagated and quantitated in MA- 104 cells. The calf rotavirus was found to survive well at mid-range RH, where 60 % of the infectious virus could be detected even after 24 h of virus aerosolization. At the low RH, the half-life of the infectious rotavirus was ca. 14 h. On the other hand, no infectious poliovirus could be recovered from the drum air at the low and medium RH. At the high RH, more than 50 % of the infectious rotavirus became undetectable within 90 min of aerosolization. In contrast to this, the half-life of the poliovirus at the high RH was about 10 h. These data, based on the aerosolization of virus mixtures, therefore {{suggest that there is}} a pronounced difference in the way RH influences the airborne survival of these two types of viruses held under identical experimental conditions...|$|E

Implications of applying different mixing models to the same source data are explored using data from 41 catchments across Europe, Africa, Australia, Asia, and North and South America.

40|$|Seven {{mouldboard}} ploughing {{experiments were}} conducted to systematically investigate the effect of different tillage directions on soil redistribution on hillslopes. The present study included tillage directions other than parallel to the gradient or along the contour, that is, in our experiments the slope gradient changed simultaneously in tillage and in turning direction. Using <b>physical</b> <b>tracers</b> we developed {{a model of the}} two-dimensional tracer displacement as a function of topography and tillage variables. The displacements in tillage and in turning direction were separately described as 2 nd degree polynomials in both tillage and in turning directions. This model fully accounted for the directionality of tillage. Displacement in turning direction additionally depended on tillage depth, while that in tillage direction was affected by tillage speed and soil bulk density. We found a large effect of tillage directionality on soil redistribution, and tillage at 45 to the gradient turning soil upslope was the least erosive tillage direction. We obtained non-linear relationships between soil redistribution and profile curvature, instead of the linear relationships reported previously. Consequently tillage erosivity varied in tillage direction and a unique tillage transport coefficient could not be obtained for all tillage directions. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.

In addition, the half-life times of these bacteria in aerosols were estimated. The uranine concentrations {{collected by the}} samplers were used for calculating the physical efficiencies, and the bacteria/uranine ratios were used for calculating the biological efficiencies. The results show the Airport MD 8 had the highest physical efficiency. Compared with the Airport MD 8, the physical efficiencies of the AGI- 30 and the OMNI- 3000 were 74 % and 49 %, respectively. A low physical efficiency of the Andersen impactor (18 %) was obtained, but it was mainly caused by the incomplete recovery of uranine when handling the air samples, so could not be ascribed to the sampler efficiency. Both the Andersen impactor and the AGI- 30 showed high biological efficiencies for all four bacterial species. The biological efficiencies of the OMNI- 3000 for C. jejuni (1 %) and of the Airport MD 8 for E. coli (38 %) and C. jejuni (2 %) were significantly lower than 100 %, indicating that their sampling stresses inactivated the bacterial culturability.

40|$|Introduction. The {{airborne}} {{transmission of}} infectious diseases in livestock production is increasingly receiving research attention. Reliable techniques of air sampling are crucial to underpin the findings of such studies. This study evaluated the physical and biological efficiencies and detection limits of four samplers (Andersen 6 -stage impactor, all-glass impinger "AGI- 30 ", OMNI- 3000 and MD 8 with gelatin filter) for collecting aerosols of infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV). Materials and Method. IBDV aerosols mixed with a <b>physical</b> <b>tracer</b> (uranine) were generated in an isolator, and then collected by the bioaerosol samplers. Samplers' physical and biological efficiencies were derived based on the tracer concentration and the virus/tracer ratio, respectively. Detection limits for the samplers were estimated with the obtained efficiency data. Results. Physical efficiencies of the AGI- 30 (96 %) and the MD 8 (100 %) {{were significantly higher than}} that of the OMNI- 3000 (60 %). Biological efficiency of the OMNI- 3000 (23 %) was significantly lower than 100 % (P < 0. 01), indicating inactivation of airborne virus during sampling. The AGI- 30, the Andersen impactor and the MD 8 did not significantly inactivate virus during sampling. The 2 -min detection limits of the samplers on airborne IBDV were 4. 1 log(10) 50 % egg infective dose (EID 50) m(- 3) for the Andersen impactor, 3. 3 log(10) EID 50 m(- 3) for the AGI- 30, 2. 5 log(10) EID 50 m(- 3) for the OMNI- 3000, and 2. 9 log(10) EID 50 m(- 3) for the MD 8. The mean half-life of IBDV aerosolized at 20 degrees C and 70 % was 11. 9 min. Conclusion. Efficiencies of different samplers vary. Despite its relatively low sampling efficiency, the OMNI- 3000 is suitable for use in environments with low viral concentrations because its high flow rate gives a low detection limit. With the 4 samplers investigated, negative air samples cannot guarantee virus-free aerial environments, which means that transmission of infectious agents between farms may still occur even when no virus has been detected...|$|E
40|$|Porcine {{reproductive}} {{and respiratory}} syndrome virus (PRRSV) is an enveloped RNA virus {{in the family}} Arteriviridae within the order Nidovirales (Cavanagh, 1997).;The objective of the first study was to optimize sampling parameters for increased recovery and detection of airborne PRRSV and swine influenza virus (SIV). Collection media containing antifoams, activated carbons, protectants, and ethylene glycol were evaluated for direct effects on factors impacting the detection of PRRSV and SIV, including virus infectivity, viability of continuous cell lines used for the isolation of these viruses, and performance of reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays. The results showed that specific compounds influenced the likelihood of detecting PRRSV and SIV in collection medium. A subsequent study evaluated the effects of collection medium, impinger model, and sampling time on the recovery of aerosolized PRRSV using a method for making direct comparisons of up to six treatments simultaneously. The results demonstrated that various components in air sampling systems, including collection medium, impinger model, and sampling time, independently influenced the recovery and detection of PRRSV and/or SIV. Based {{on the results of}} these experiments, the air sampling parameters were optimized for sampling i. e. recovery/detection of PRRSV and implemented throughout the remaining experiments.;The objective the second study was to estimate the analytical sensitivity (detection threshold) of each of four air samplers (AGI- 30, AGI- 4, SKC BioSampler, and Midwest Micro-Tek sampler) for PRRSV and SIV. In a 5 minute sampling period under controlled conditions, the analytical sensitivity of the AGI- 30, AGI- 4, SKC BioSamplerRTM, and Micro-Tek samplers for PRRSV was calculated at 1 x 101. 1, 1 x 101. 3, 1 x 101. 1, and 1 x 101. 2 TCID 50 equivalents and 1 x 10 1. 4, 1 x 101. 1, 1 x 101. 6, for SIV. Despite marked differences in sampler design, no statistically significant difference in analytical sensitivity was detected between samplers for collection of artificially produced aerosols containing cell culture propagated PRRSV or SIV. Detection thresholds obtained from this experiment were used for reference in excretion studies.;The objective of the third study was to characterize the excretion of these pathogens in respirations from acutely infected pigs. Pigs were inoculated under experimental conditions with one pathogen. Samples were collected from the upper respiratory tract and respiratory exhalations. All pathogens were detected in the upper respiratory tracts of inoculated pigs, but only M. hyopneumoniae and B. bronchiseptica were detected in expired air from individually-sampled, acutely-infected pigs. These findings suggested either that acutely infected pigs did not aerosolize PRRSV, PCV- 2, SIV, or PRCV, or that the quantity of virus excreted was below the analytical sensitivity (detection threshold) of current sampling and/or assay systems at the individual pig level.;The objective of the forth study was to describe the stability of airborne infectious PRRSV as a function of temperature and relative humidity. A cloud of infectious PRRSV was aerosolized using a 24 -jet Collison nebulizer into a dynamic aerosol toroid (DAT) maintained at a specific temperature and relative humidity. The PRRSV cloud within the DAT was sampled repeatedly over time using SKC BioSamplerRTM impingers and the total viral RNA (RT-PCR) and concentration of infectious PRRSV (TCID 50) in the air samples was determined. As measured by quantitative RT-PCR, PRRSV RNA was stable under the conditions evaluated in this study. Thus, a comparison of viral RNA and Rhodamine B dye, a <b>physical</b> <b>tracer,</b> found {{no significant difference in the}} slopes of the lines. Titers of infectious virus were plotted by time and the half-life (T 1 / 2) of infectious PRRSV was calculated using linear regression analysis. An analysis of the results showed that aerosolized PRRSV was more stable at lower temperatures and/or lower relative humidity, but temperature had a greater effect on the T 1 / 2 of PRRSV than relative humidity. Based on these results, an equation was derived to predict the T 1 / 2 of infectious airborne PRRSV for any combination of environmental temperature and relative humidity.;The objective of the fifth study was to describe and validate a method that provides improved estimates of the probability that exposure to a specific dose of an airborne infectious pathogen will result in infection in animals. To validate the proposed method, 7 replicates of 10 pigs per replicate were conducted. Pigs were exposed to specific doses of airborne PRRSV. Following exposure, animals are individually housed and monitored for evidence of infection. The relationship describing the probability of infection after exposure was modeled on the proportions of pigs that became infected by exposure to specific doses. A dose response curve was derived using logistical models. Based on this methodology dose-response curves may be derived for a number of animal host and infectious pathogens.

The major techniques {{used for this}} optical detection include: (1) Linking the antigens to some <b>physical</b> <b>tracers</b> that can be optically detected; (2) Collecting and transmitting the optical signal to an optical detector. ^ From an optical point of view, {{the problem is a}} nonimaging-optics problem to collect a fluorescent signal from an extended Lambertian source and deliver it to an optical detection system with maximum energy transfer and distinct wavelength separation. ^ A raytrace model of the optical detection system was used for numerical simulations to analyze and optimize the optical design. The result leads to an improvement of the optical detection. Related physical problems such as magnetic focusing effect, fluorescence detection, and wavelength separation have also been studied in detail. ^ With the adoption of a single-step immunomagnetic assay, experimental studies have been conducted for the detection of Salmonella, with a dual-fiber optical probe and tapered tubular waveguide probes. The test results have shown that the detection system gives detection limit of approximately 106 CFU/ml with dual-fiber optical probes, and 105 CFU/ml with improved tubular waveguide probes. ^ The system developed for this research project is designed as a cost-effective portable instrument that may be used for field-testing. Rapid and on-site detection, low cost instrumentation and a reusable optical probe have been emphasized throughout the study. ...|$|R

The definition of the conceptual model includes elements as the identification of recharge areas, their connection with discharge areas, the sequence of physical â chemical processes acting into the aquifer and the transport mechanisms. With reference to the identification of recharge areas, two casestudies are illustrated. The first deals with a continental karstic aquifer (Monti Simbruini, Central Italy) discharging through springs used for drinking purposes: it has been studied by using the stable deuterium and oxygen- 18 isotopes according to the âmass-centerâ method coupled with the âinverse hydrogeological budgetâ method. The second regards a platform karstic aquifer (Murgia, Southern Italy), discharging through coastal brackish springs, which is exploited by wells for both drinking and agricultural purposes: for recognizing some elements of the conceptual model a multi-tracing approach has been adopted, which uses the crossverification of information coming from the interpretation of isotopic, chemical and <b>physical</b> <b>tracers.</b> Moreover, with the aim of outlining the factors that control the pollutant transport in karstic aquifers, two case-studies related to Murgia aquifer illustrate a first method for defining the hazard due to direct injection of effluents from treatment plants and a second approach for defining, through monitoring data, the transport mechanisms of pollutant released at land surface...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{observational}} {{progress has}} led to the establishment of the standard ÎCDM model for cosmology. This development is based on different cosmological probes that are usually combined through their likelihoods at the latest stage in the analysis. We implement here an integrated scheme for cosmological probes, which are combined in a common framework starting at the map level. This treatment is necessary as the probes are generally derived from overlapping maps and are thus not independent. It also allows for a thorough test of the cosmological model and of systematics through the consistency of different <b>physical</b> <b>tracers.</b> As a first application, we combine current measurements of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) from the Planck satellite, and galaxy clustering and weak lensing from SDSS. We consider the spherical harmonic power spectra of these probes including all six auto- and cross-correlations along with the associated full Gaussian covariance matrix. This provides an integrated treatment of different analyses usually performed separately including CMB anisotropies, cosmic shear, galaxy clustering, galaxy-galaxy lensing and the Integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect with galaxy and shear tracers. We derive constraints on ÎCDM parameters that are compatible with existing constraints and highlight tensions between data sets, which become apparent in this integrated treatment. We discuss how this approach provides a complete and powerful integrated framework for probe combination and how it can be extended to include other tracers in the context of current and future wide field cosmological surveys.

40|$|The role of meso- and submesoscale {{processes}} for the near-coastal circulation, <b>physical</b> and biogeochemical <b>tracer</b> distributions and oxygen minimum zone ventilation in the Peruvian upwelling regime is investigated in this thesis. A multi-platform four-dimensional observational experiment {{was carried out}} off Peru in early 2013 and {{is the basis for}} this thesis. Furthermore a high-resolution submesoscale permitting physical circulation model is used to study submesoscale frontal dynamics in more detail. The formation of a subsurface anticyclonic eddy {{and its impact on the}} near-coastal salinity, oxygen and nutrient distributions was captured by the observations. The eddy developed in the Peru-Chile Undercurrent downstream of a topographic bend, suggesting flow separation as the eddy formation mechanism. The eddy resulted in enhanced cross-shore exchange of <b>physical</b> and biogeochemical <b>tracers</b> due to along-isopycnal stirring and offshore transport of core waters. The core waters originated from the bottom boundary layer and were characterized by low potential vorticity and an enhanced nitrogen-deficit. The subduction of highly oxygenated surface water in a submesoscale cold filament is observed by glider-based measurements. The subduction ventilates the upper oxycline but does not reach into oxygen minimum zone core waters during the summer observations. Lagrangian floats are used to study the pathways of newly upwelled water in a regional submesoscale permitting model. The model analysis suggests a gradual warming of the newly upwelled waters due to surface heat fluxes. The associated density decrease prevents the floats to enter the density range of the oxygen minimum zone in summer. However, in winter a density increase is found due to surface cooling and thus it might be possible that submesoscale processes ventilate the oxygen minimum zone. In the model about 50 % of the newly upwelled floats leave the mixed layer within 5 days both in summer and winter emphazising a hitherto unrecognized importance of subduction for the ventilation of the Peruvian oxyclin...|$|R
40|$|OS 12 A- 05 Investigations of {{submarine}} massive sulfide deposits as {{a possible}} metal resource are lacking some fundamental data. First of all, {{we do not know}} how much of the metal that is released by high-temperature venting over a given length of a ridge axis and over a specific geological time frame is actually deposited as massive sulfides or occurs as geochemical anomaly within sediments or is related to altered rocks in the upflow zone. Additionally, exploration is usually performed by identifying chemical and <b>physical</b> <b>tracers</b> in the water column limiting the search to only active deposits within or close to the neovolcanic rift zone. We also lack the ability to identify buried deposits (beneath sediments or lava) thereby underestimating the resource potential of explored areas. Systematic surveys from the ridge axis to tens of kilometers away from the axis have never been performed limiting our interpretations to a small snapshot in time. In a recent meeting at GEOMAR in Kiel, a number of researchers from various countries came together in order to discuss the necessary steps forward. We propose a regional high-resolution geological and geophysical exploration of a mid-ocean ridge segment in order to establish the metal potential of an entire slow-spreading ridge segment. Investigations will be targeted at the TAG segment (26 Â°N, MAR) where active and inactive massive sulfide deposits are well known and were visual observation by submersibles suggests the presence of additional massive sulfide deposits further away from the ridge axis. The metal inventory of this ridge segment, however, is still unknown despite the numerous research cruises and the presence of the 4 mio tonnes TAG deposit. As a first step we want to perform segment-scale high-resolution mapping (AUV-based bathymetry, sidescan, photomosaicing) for identifying favorable locations as well as AUV-based magnetic and subbottom profiling surveys to locate buried deposits and possibly estimate their thickness. Due to the size of the working area the simultaneous use of a fleet of AUVâs seems necessary, which requires the combined efforts of several institutes. This survey would also allow for photo surveys of large parts of the seafloor to guide in structural interpretation and provide the opportunity for large-scale habitat mapping. At later stages active and passive seismicity as well as marine EM will be employed to image the upflow zones. This information will, together with the structural interpretation, water column and petrological information as well as the regional bathymetric datasets, feed into a 3 -dimensional model of fluid flow in the crust along this ridge segment in order to constrain fluid pathways, the physicochemical conditions at depth and to ultimately budget the metal resource of this ridge segment over geological time scales.

40|$|An Ensemble Kalman Filter {{is applied}} to {{assimilate}} observed tracer fields in various combinations in the Bern 3 D ocean model. Each tracer combination yields a set of optimal transport parameter values {{that are used in}} projections with prescribed CO 2 stabilization pathways. The assimilation of temperature and salinity fields yields a too vigorous ventilation of the thermocline and the deep ocean, whereas the inclusion of CFC- 11 and radiocarbon improves the representation of <b>physical</b> and biogeochemical <b>tracers</b> and of ventilation time scales. Projected peak uptake rates and cumulative uptake of CO 2 by the ocean are around 20 % lower for the parameters determined with CFC- 11 and radiocarbon as additional target compared to those with salinity and temperature only. Higher surface temperature changes are simulated in the GreenlandâNorwegianâIceland Sea and in the Southern Ocean when CFC- 11 is included in the Ensemble Kalman model tuning. These findings highlights the importance of ocean transport calibration for the design of near-term and long-term CO 2 emission mitigation strategies and for climate projections...|$|R
40|$|The Thermal Emission Spectrometer (TES) on the Mars Global Surveyor {{has made}} {{extensive}} {{observations of the}} Martian atmospheric water vapor column {{since the beginning of}} its mapping mission in early 1999. The results show broad agreement with the earlier Viking Mars Atmospheric Water Detector (MAWD) results (though column amounts in southern summer are higher, perhaps due to dust obscuration during the Viking mission). General circulation model (GCM) simulations of the annual Martian water cycle also show broad agreement with the TES observations. Details of the simulations depend on cloud and boundary layer parameterizations and on the adsorbing properties of the regolith. In order to make quantitative assessments of this agreement and to obtain observational values for the required <b>physical</b> parameters, a <b>tracer</b> transport data assimilation model has been developed. Model winds are derived from both tracer measurements and retrieved atmospheric temperature structures, providing a useful check of the underlying dynamical core of the GCM. By allowing detailed intercomparison between spacecraft and ground-based observations of Martian water vapor, the model should also contribute significantly {{to our understanding of the}} diurnal water cycle...|$|R
40|$|The {{shaping of}} river beds by flowing water is an {{important}} problem in geophysics. Often, the process is studied by tracing the trajectories of some labeled sediments particles. This type of sediment tracer studies of bed load transport and geomorphic evolution are growing in popularity but lack sufficient <b>physical</b> basis for <b>tracer</b> interpretation. Bed load tracers spend most time trapped in the riverbed, indicating {{the importance of these}} sediment âwaiting timesâ for tracer dynamics. Here, we propose the first process-based model to predict the waiting time distribution. Our model, based on the well-studied âOrnsteinâUhlenbeckââ process, treats bed elevation as a random walk with mean-reverting tendency related to the maximal range of bed elevation fluctuations. Idealized flume experiments tracking bidisperse spherical beads propelled by steady water flow support our model and reveal the direct relationship between waiting times and bed evolution. Asymptotic power law scaling of observed and modeled waiting time distributions agree with experimental and field observations of natural bed load tracers, suggesting broad applicability of our model to fluctuating sedimentary surfaces and disordered transport systems experiencing tracer burial and excavation...|$|R
40|$|Appropriate {{field data}} are {{required}} to check the reliability of hydrodynamic models simulating the dispersion of soluble substances in the marine environment. This study deals with the collection of physical measurements and soluble tracer data intended specifically {{for this kind of}} validation. The intensity of currents as well as the complexity of topography and tides around the Cap de La Hague {{in the center of the}} English Channel makes it one of the most difficult areas to represent in terms of hydrodynamics and dispersion. Controlled releases of tritium - in the form of HTO - are carried out in this area by the AREVA-NC plant, providing an excellent soluble tracer. A total of 14 493 measurements were acquired to track dispersion in the hours and days following a release. These data, supplementing previously gathered data and physical measurements (bathymetry, water-surface levels, Eulerian and Lagrangian current studies) allow us to test dispersion models from the hour following release to periods of several years which are not accessible with dye experiments. The dispersion characteristics are described and methods are proposed for comparing models against measurements. An application is proposed for a 2 dimensions high-resolution numerical model. It shows how an extensive dataset can be used to build, calibrate and validate several aspects of the model in a highly dynamic and macrotidal area: tidal cycle timing, tidal amplitude, fixed-point current data, hodographs. This study presents results concerning the model's ability to reproduce residual Lagrangian currents, along with a comparison between simulation and high-frequency measurements of <b>tracer</b> dispersion. <b>Physical</b> and <b>tracer</b> data are available from the SISMER database of IFREMER (www. ifremer. fr/sismer/catal).

40|$|Abstract: Field {{measurements}} of waves, currents and longshore transport {{were carried out}} at Culatra Island in southern Portugal in a semi-diurnal meso-tidal regime. Observed wave conditions were uniform (H rms 0. 24 - 0. 26 m) during {{one and a half}} tidal cycles while mean longshore currents reached a peak (0. 28 mjs) half way throughout the experiment, due to the presence of a moderate longshore wind. Sand tracers measured a peak in the longshore transport rate (1. 38 x 10. 2 m 3 js) in agreement with the increase in current speed. Simulations of the field conditions using a computer model (LlTPACK) do not predict successfully the measured transport rates. Calculations using sim pie empirical formulas provided a better approximation, despite being one order of magnitude smaller than the field measurements. If the model was used employing theoretical or extrapolated physical parameters it would have been impossible to determine the errors in the predictions. It is praposed that computer models of sand transport should produce probabili~tic results with a clear indication of the expected levei of errar. Field monitoring of beach morphodynamics ~till remains the best and most reliable method of pracess assessment.

40|$|The {{three-dimensional}} {{structure of}} the meridional overturning circulation (MOC) in the deep Indian Ocean is investigated with an eddy-permitting ocean model. The amplitude of the modeled deep Indian Ocean MOC is 5. 6 Sv (1 Sv ï¿½ 10 6 m 3 s ï¿½ 1), a broadly realistic but somewhat weak overturning. Although the model parameterization of diapycnal mixing is inaccurate, the modelâs short spinup allows the effective diapycnal velocity (the sum of model drift and the explicitly modeled diapycnal velocity) to resemble the true, real-ocean diapycnal velocity. For this reason, the model is able to recover the broad zonal asymmetry in the turbulent buoyancy flux that is suggested by observations. The model features a substantial deep, depth-reversing zonal circulation of nearly 50 % of the MOC. The existence of this circulation, {{brought about by the}} zonally asymmetric distribution of diapycnal mixing, implies a much slower ventilation of the deep Indian Ocean (by a factor of 5 â 6) than would be in place without zonal interbasin exchanges. It is concluded that the zonal asymmetry in the distribution of diapycnal mixing must {{have a major impact on}} the deep Indian Oceanâs capacity to store and transform climatically significant <b>physical</b> and biogeochemical <b>tracers.</b> 1...|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} single-well injection-withdrawal (SWIW) and two-well convergent-flow (TWCF) tracer tests were {{conducted}} in the Culebra dolomite at the WIPP site in late 1995 and early 1996. Modeling analyses {{over the past year}} have focused on reproducing the observed mass-recovery curves and understanding the basic <b>physical</b> processes controlling <b>tracer</b> transport in SWIW and TWCF tests. To date, specific modeling efforts have focused on five SWIW tests and one TWCF pathway at each of two different locations (H- 11 and H- 19 hydropads). An inverse parameter-estimation procedure was implemented to model the SWIW and TWCF tests with both traditional and multirate double-porosity formulations. The traditional model assumes a single diffusion rate while the multirate model uses a first-order approximation to model a continuous distribution of diffusion coefficients. Conceptually, the multirate model represents variable matrix block sizes within the Culebra as observed in geologic investigations and also variability in diffusion rates within the matrix blocks as observed with X-ray imaging in the laboratory. Single-rate double-porosity models cannot provide an adequate match to the SWIW data. Multirate double-porosity models provide excellent fits to all five SWIW mass-recovery curves. Models of the TWCF tests show that, at one location, the tracer test can be modeled with both single-rate and multirate double-porosity models. At the other location, only the multi-rate double-porosity model is capable of explaining the test results...|$|R
