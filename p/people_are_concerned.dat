500|$|However, {{despite these}} {{widespread}} feelings of fatalism, some men {{believe that they}} can avoid HIV contraction by modifying their personal behaviors. Men who decide to change their behaviors to reduce their risk of infection are unlikely to use condoms consistently, particularly during marital intercourse; instead, they usually continue engaging in extramarital sexual relations, but alter {{the ways in which they}} choose their sexual partners. For example, before selecting extramarital sexual partners, men sometimes survey their peers to determine whether their potential partners are likely to have exposed themselves to the virus. Men who choose their sexual partners based on external appearances and peer recommendations often believe that women who violate traditional gender norms by, for example, wearing modern clothing are more likely to carry HIV, while young girls, who are perceived as sexually inexperienced, are considered [...] "pure." [...] Because of this perception, many <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>concerned</b> that schoolchildren in Malawi, particularly girls, are becoming exposed to the virus through sexual harassment or abuse by their instructors.|$|E
500|$|Despite the acquittal, {{the broader}} public {{perception}} was strong that Thorpe had not behaved well, nor had he adequately explained himself. The Archdeacon of Barnstaple, who {{was critical of}} Hornby's melodramatic thanksgiving service, wrote: [...] "There {{is a great deal}} of unhappiness [...] about the result at the Old Bailey. [...] As far as most <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>concerned,</b> the trial ended with a big question mark over the case". Prevented by his party from a return to active politics, in 1982 Thorpe was appointed by Amnesty International as director of its British section, but after protests from the organisation's staff, he withdrew. Not long afterwards, Thorpe first showed signs of the Parkinson's disease that led to his almost complete withdrawal into private life in the mid-1980s. There was a political reconciliation when, in 1988, following the merger of the Liberals and the Social Democratic Party, the newly formed North Devon Liberal Democrat association made him their honorary president. When he attended the Liberal Democrat party conference in 1997 he received a standing ovation. In 1999, Thorpe published his political memoir, In My Own Time, in which he justified his silence at the trial, and stated that he had never doubted the outcome. Nine years later, in January 2008, Thorpe gave his first press interview in 25 years, to The Guardian. Referring to the affair he said: [...] "If it happened now I think the public would be kinder. Back then they were very troubled by it... It offended their set of values." [...] Thorpe died on 4 December 2014.|$|E

Queensland Premier Rob Borbidge even commented {{that some of}} the High Court judges were [...] "dills about history." [...] Prime Minister John Howard in a press conference held up a map of Australia purporting to show how much of Australia was at risk from native title claims.

2500|$|Siting of wind {{turbines}} {{has sometimes been}} an issue, as most <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>concerned</b> {{about the value of}} natural landscapes. The John Muir Trust has stated that [...] "the best renewable energy options around wild land are small-scale, sensitively sited and adjacent to the communities directly benefiting from them" [...] although this does rather miss the point that onshore wind developments are required to meet large-scale, national targets not local needs. A small-scale scheme proposed by North Harris Development Trust has been supported by the John Muir Trust. A 2013 poll carried out by the John Muir Trust, suggests that 75% of Scots would like to see their wild areas protected from further development. Wind farm developers sometimes offer [...] "community benefit funds" [...] to help address any disadvantages faced by those living adjacent to wind farms.|$|E
2500|$|An article {{published}} in the Mission Hill Gazette on April 3, 2015 talks about the potential {{plans to build a}} 35-story tower with 395 units. This is a huge project and <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>concerned</b> that it is too big of a building for the neighborhood. A Boston Redevelopment Authority Director, Brian Golden, met with neighbors of this potential tower plan. He stated {{that he did not want}} this project to affect the family feel of the neighboring streets. In previous years there have been problems with trying to build towers because there are restrictions set, such as, the building can only be a certain height. The BRA is looking into these old redevelopment plans to see if they will affect this potential future project. Golden walked the neighborhood with people who would be potential neighbors of this project and they were able to voice some of their concerns in a respectful manner. The people of the community are concerned that this building will bring more traffic to the area and that the people who move in will [...] "Not participate in the life of the neighborhood." ...|$|E

2500|$|In the {{beginning}} of the Christian era probably it was known as Mahavana. During the 4th century AD the territory was referred to as Mahakantara (Greater forest). Both Mahavana and Mahakantara are synonymous terms representing the same land. Mahakantara and Kosala (or South Kosala) comprising Sambalpur, Bilaspur and Raipur were two distinct but neighboring territories. Originally these two geographical units were known as Kantara and Kosala in Ramayana and Mahabharata. In the 4th century AD Vyaghraraja was ruling over Mahakantara comprising Kalahandi, undivided Koraput and Bastar region. Asurgarh was capital of Mahakantara. In ancient history Asurgarh region was transition point for trading between Kaling, Mahakantara and Kosal (South). Asurgarh bears special importance so far as the Atavika <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>concerned.</b> These people find mention in Ashokan edicts and they are considered to have constituted the fighting forces of Kalinga against Ashoka in the famous Kalinga war. The Gupta emperor Samudragupta defeated Vyaghraraja of Mahakantara after defeating Kosala or South Kosala. But after defeating him the state of Mahakantara was returned to Vyaghraraj, as the Gupta influence in the Deccan was more of cultural than of political significance. The impact of Gupta culture in Kalahandi region is known from the rise of Saktism, Saiviam and Vaishaniam as well as spread of Sanskrit culture in this area in post-Gupta period. In the 5th century AD Sanskritization in Orissa was first started from Kalahandi â€“ Koraput [...] Kalahandi was the cradle of Stambeswari Creed in the 5th century AD due to Sanskritization, which was a forerunner of Jagannatha, Balabhadra and Subhadra or Jagannatha Cult. The first brick temple in Eastern India, the temple of Goddess Stambeswari, was built at Asurgarh during the 5th century AD.|$|E

60|$|The {{result is}} that a large {{percentage}} of the individuals sought for are discovered, alive or dead, for in such work the Salvation Army has advantages denied to any other body, scarcely excepting the Police.

The usual fee charged for this work is 10s. 6d.; but when this cannot be paid, a large number of cases are undertaken free. The Army goes to as much trouble in these unpaid cases as in any others, only then it is not able to flood the country with printed bills.

His name was William; and on account of his conquest of England, he received the name of William the Conqueror. He parcelled out a great portion of the land, and all the offices and powers of government, among the nobles and generals that came with him; and they and their descendants have held the property and the power to the present day. Thus England, so far as the great mass of the <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>concerned,</b> is to be considered as a conquered country, and now in the possession of the conquerors. It is governed mainly by an aristocracy which descended from, and represents, the generals that conquered it. In fact, the highest honor which any man can claim for himself or his family in England is to say that his ancestors came in with the Conqueror. It is a sort of phrase." ...|$|E
