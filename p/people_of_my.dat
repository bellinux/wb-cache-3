500|$|Because of his {{enormous}} commitment to Steven Spielberg's Hook, which opened {{the same month}} as JFK, composer John Williams {{did not have time}} to compose a conventional score for the entire film. Instead he composed and conducted six musical sequences in full for JFK before he saw the film in its entirety. Soon after recording this music, he traveled to New Orleans where Stone was still shooting the film and saw approximately an hour's worth of edited footage and dailies. Williams remembers, [...] "I thought his handling of Lee Harvey Oswald was particularly strong, and I understood some of the atmosphere of the film – the sordid elements, the underside of New Orleans." [...] Stone and his team then actually cut the film to fit Williams' music after the composer had scored and recorded musical cues in addition to the six he had done prior to seeing the film. For the motorcade sequence, Williams described the score he composed as [...] "strongly kinetic music, music of interlocking rhythmic disciplines." [...] The composer remembered the moment he learned of Kennedy's assassination and it stuck with him for years. This was a significant factor in his deciding to work on the film. Williams said, [...] "This is a very resonant subject for <b>people</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> generation, and that's why I welcomed the opportunity to participate in this film." ...|$|E

It was then adopted by the Book of the Month Club, which bought more than 200,000 copies.|$|E

I’ve also had younger viewers tell me that they're glad they have a character they can relate to." [...] Critical response has also been generally positive. Malick's introductory episode was selected as recommended viewing by the Sunday Mercury. Inside Soap Katy Moon described him as having made a [...] "big impact from day one", with the observation: [...] "His arrogance, combined with his boundless determination {{to do the right thing}} by his patients, means that no one could have missed his arrival on the wards – be it the medics in the show or Holby viewers." [...] Simon of the Daily Mirror quipped that Malick was [...] "just what the doctor ordered" [...] to counterbalance the programme's weaker males. She positively contrasted Malick—alongside Hanssen and Michael—with former [...] "spineless male doctors". Simon later deemed Malick [...] "lovely", and found it interesting that he was gay.|$|E

Moreover, when answering a question during this time about whether young people were misunderstood by the older generation, she said [...] "Yes, but I'm sure that's been the case down the ages.

[...] Also, when asked at the same time about how she felt about her rapid rise to stardom at such a young age, Bazlen said [...] "I realise what a lucky person I am and I'm anxious to repay the trust a lot of important people have placed in me. Reaching so high so young has put a lot of responsibility on my shoulders, but I feel that responsibility is part of the pattern of living and it is not to be taken lightly." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} 1920s Sackville-West wrote a memoir, not {{published}} until 1973, {{under the title}} Portrait of a Marriage, of her relationships, in which she sought to explain both why she had chosen to stay with Nicolson after all, and why she {{had fallen in love}} with Trefusis in the first place. In Portrait of a Marriage, Sackville-West, using metaphors from nature, presents her account as truthful and honest while at same time calling her life a [...] "bog" [...] and a [...] "swamp", suggesting that her personal life was naturally unappealing and unpleasant. Sackville-West stated that she wanted to explain her sexuality, which she presented as being at the core of her personality, as in the future [...] "it will be recognized that many more <b>people</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> type do exist than under the present-day system of hypocrisy is commonly admitted". Reflecting a certain ambivalence about her sexuality, Sackville-West presented her sexual desires for Trefusis as both [...] "deviant" [...] and [...] "natural", as if she herself was uncertain of whether her sexuality was normal or not, though the American scholar Geogria Johnston has argued that Sackville-West's confusion on this point was due to her wish to have this memoir published one day. In this regard, Sackville-West wrote of her deep desire and love for Trefusis while at same time declaring her [...] "shame" [...] about this [...] "duality with which I was too weak and too self-indulgent to struggle". At various times, Sackville-West called herself a [...] "pariah" [...] with a [...] "perverted nature" [...] and [...] "unnatural" [...] " [...] feelings for Trefusis, who was portrayed as a tempting if degrading object of her desire.|$|E
