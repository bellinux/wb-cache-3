5|$|Ramirez {{was born}} in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic to Aristides and Onelcida Ramirez and spent {{thirteen}} years living there. As a child, Ramirez was obsessed with baseball. When he was eight years old, his grandmother got him a Dodgers uniform with the number 30 on the back, which he considers {{to be one of}} his most prized possessions. In 1985, he moved to the Washington Heights neighborhood of New York City with his parents. He would often <b>play</b> <b>ball</b> at the nearby Snake Hill, the same place Lou Gehrig played during his childhood. Despite living just a short distance from Yankee Stadium, Ramirez rooted for the Toronto Blue Jays and would watch games when the Blue Jays were in town.|$|E

He and his wife co-wrote Fit Home Team, a family health manual, and an autobiography titled The Beauty of Love: A Memoir of Miracles, Hope, and Healing, which describes their personal ordeals and how they dealt with them after learning of their son's birth condition in 1999.|$|E
25|$|Beginning in 1996, Hanover {{appeared}} at few public events. There {{were reports that}} Hanover was aware of her husband's personal conduct as early as 1995. On Father's Day Giuliani had told reporters that he was returning to Gracie Mansion to <b>play</b> <b>ball</b> with Andrew, but instead went to City Hall, to a basement suite with his press secretary. Three hours later Hanover went to City Hall to confront Giuliani, but a mayor's aide prevented her from entering the suite.|$|E

25|$|With his arm injured, Paige {{suddenly}} found himself unemployable. He looked for {{work as a}} manager or coach, but was unsuccessful. One ballclub owner {{was willing to give}} him a chance to <b>play</b> <b>ball</b> again—J.L. Wilkinson of the Monarchs. Wilkinson offered him the modest opportunity to play, not for the Negro American League Monarchs, but for a second-string barnstorming team called the Travelers, which was now renamed the Satchel Paige All-Stars. Paige would pitch when he could and play first base when he could not.|$|E
25|$|In {{a classic}} Game 2, the score {{remained}} tied at 2 {{heading to the}} 11th inning. In the top half, Chone Figgins broke out of his postseason slump by blooping an RBI single to left field to score Gary Matthews, Jr. to give the Angels a 3-2 lead. However, in the bottom half, Alex Rodriguez lined a home run into the short right-field porch off Angels closer Brian Fuentes {{to tie the game}} at 3. In the bottom of the 13th, Maicer Izturis threw away a potential double <b>play</b> <b>ball</b> from Melky Cabrera to score Jerry Hairston, Jr. with the winning run, giving the Yankees a 2-0 series lead.|$|E
500|$|Ferguson had, on {{numerous}} occasions during his playing and managerial career, served as a substitute umpire, but did not start doing it full-time until after his departure from Philadelphia. In 1888, he became a full-time professional umpire, working in the American Association, {{and later in the}} Players' League in 1890. By the end of the 1890 season he had passed Kick Kelly to take over the record for career games as an umpire with 650; John Gaffney surpassed his final total of 786 in 1893. Ferguson officially umpired 804games if his National Association games are taken into account, and his career came to a close after the 1891 season. On his umpiring philosophy, he once stated [...] "Umpiring always came as easy to me", he said, [...] "as sleeping on a featherbed. Never change a decision, never stop to talk to a man. Make 'em <b>play</b> <b>ball</b> and keep their mouths shut, and never fear but the people will be on your side and you'll be called the king of umpires." ...|$|E

500|$|Ball {{was partly}} {{inspired}} by two encounters {{he had in}} the early 1990s. In about 1991–92, Ball saw a plastic bag blowing in the wind outside the World Trade Center. He watched the bag for 10 minutes, saying later that it provoked an [...] "unexpected emotional response". In 1992, Ball became preoccupied with the media circus around the Amy Fisher trial. Discovering a comic book telling of the scandal, he was struck by how quickly it had become commercialized. He said he [...] "felt like there was a real story underneath [...] more fascinating and way more tragic" [...] than the story presented to the public, and attempted to turn the idea into a <b>play.</b> <b>Ball</b> produced around 40 pages, but stopped when he realized it would work better as a film. He felt that because of the visual themes, and because each character's story was [...] "intensely personal", it could not be done on a stage. All the main characters appeared in this version, but Carolyn did not feature strongly; Jim and Jim instead had much larger roles.|$|E
500|$|... "Fermín" [...] {{describes}} a mentally ill character in an institution. The song changes {{a line from}} the French folk song, [...] "Marlbrough s'en va-t-en guerre", from [...] "Mambrú se fue a la guerra, no sé cuándo vendrá" [...] ("Mambrú left for the war; I do not know when he will return") to [...] "Fermín se fue a la vida, no sé cuándo vendrá" [...] ("Fermín left for life; I do not know when he will return"). According to Spinetta, [...] "life for the insane is like war for the sane." [...] Reflecting on the track, Spinetta said: [...] "In front of my house lived an incredible character called Carlitos, a retarded boy, who is in part the personification of Fermín for me. With Carlitos we shared moments of joy when we were kids. Although he could not <b>play</b> <b>ball</b> with everyone, he felt accompanied in his tremendous problem when we were with him. It is also an apology, because I remember that his mother punished him a lot, even {{in front of the other}} boys. I do not know if the degree of illness of the song's Fermín is as actue as that of Carlitos, but serves to define the situation of the alienated as a propitious cell to receive the most aberrant injustices. [...] "Plegaria para un niño dormido" [...] urges not to wake a poor child up, letting him be happy in his dreams. The criticism of society's injustice is, in Spinetta's words, [...] "a complaint made with tenderness." [...] He called it [...] "the symbol of a Christian ideology: neighborliness, solidarity." [...] "A estos hombres tristes" [...] was inspired by the melancholy of Sundays in Argentina, with Spinetta saying: [...] "Sunday was always a sad day, I do not know why. At the same time it was happy because there was football, the family gathered, there was good food. The importance that was given to the weekend in our country in those years was tremendous. But the personal solitude at that time was very clear." [...] The album ends with [...] "Laura va", a baroque pop song which took Spinetta a year and a half to write; Spinetta described it as an attempt to emulate the Beatles' [...] "She's Leaving Home".|$|E

My refusal to <b>play</b> <b>ball</b> with my colleagues is deliberate, of course, since I view the standard philosophical terminology as worse than useless—a major obstacle to progress since it consists of so many errors." ...|$|E
2500|$|At one time, {{the park}} was {{open to the public}} on Gramercy Day [...] which changed yearly, but was often the first Saturday in May. In 2007, the {{trustees}} announced that the park would no longer be open for Gramercy Day because it [...] "had turned into a street fair". [...] The park, however, continues to be open to the public on Christmas Eve. Visitors to the park may not at any time drink alcohol, smoke, ride a bicycle, walk a dog, <b>play</b> <b>ball</b> or Frisbee, or feed the birds and squirrels.|$|E
2500|$|Weeks after Gore's {{contract}} {{was sold to}} the New York Giants, Chicago writer Harry Palmer wrote that whenever Gore [...] "failed to <b>play</b> <b>ball</b> for all he was worth, Anson has reprimanded him."

As an instance of their friendly relations, Anson says Gore applied to him for work this Winter, and the big Chicago captain promised him employment on the toboggan slides at the White Stocking Park whenever he wanted it." [...] In 1888, after seeing him in street clothes during a home game, the New York Star called him [...] "'Budweiser' Gore." ...|$|E

2500|$|The city {{continually}} upgrades {{and develops}} new neighborhood park and recreation facilities. A total of 29 parks allow Mishawaka residents to golf, <b>play</b> <b>ball,</b> fish and exercise. In 1968, the city opened an outdoor Olympic-size {{swimming pool and}} an adjacent ice skating rink at Merrifield Park. On the south side, Mishawaka's George Wilson Park {{is home to the}} city's most popular winter toboggan spot, as well as an 18-hole frisbee golf course. Some of the city's Italian immigrants and their descendants still play traditional games such as bocce, and a few ethnic Belgians continue to raise and race homing pigeons. The city also hosted the nation's oldest and largest wiffleball tournament, the World Wiffle Ball Championship, from 1980-2012.|$|E
2500|$|The {{day after}} his death, {{before the start of}} the Yankees' four-game set with the Baltimore Orioles in the Bronx, the team paid tribute to their {{deceased}} captain in a pre-game ceremony in which the starters stood at their defensive positions, save for the catcher's box, which remained empty. Following a prayer by Cardinal Terence Cooke, a moment of silence and [...] "America the Beautiful" [...] by Robert Merrill, the fans (announced attendance 51,151) burst into an eight-minute standing ovation. Jerry Narron, the man who replaced Munson behind the plate that night, remained in the dugout and did not enter the field until stadium announcer Bob Sheppard said, [...] "And now it is time to <b>play</b> <b>ball.</b> Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your co-operation." ...|$|E
2500|$|With Judge Roy Hofheinz now {{the sole}} {{owner of the}} {{franchise}} and his vision of a domed stadium to <b>play</b> <b>ball</b> indoors complete, the Colt [...]45 moved into their new domed stadium in 1965. The Judge called the new domed stadium the Astrodome. [...] The name was in honor of Houston's importance to the country's space program and to match with {{the meaning of the}} name, the Colt [...]45s were renamed the Astros. [...] The new park, coined as the [...] "Eighth Wonder of the World" [...] did little to help the play on the field. [...] While several [...] "indoor" [...] firsts were accomplished, the team still finished ninth in the standings. [...] The attendance was high not because of the team accomplishments, but because people came from miles around to see the Astrodome.|$|E
