40|$|In {{the term}} of {{promoting}} fish resources management to be sutainable and profitable as great as possible for the people welfare, the Government applies the PPP and PHP (Fishery Exploitation Levy and Fish Caught Levy) in giving a fish catching exploitation licence as for adding the state non-tax revenue. The purpose of study {{is to examine the}} fish catch compositions and kinds of fish species of the small pelagic purse seiner boat, the PPP and PHP influences on the purse seiner fishermen incomes, and compare the amount of PHP determined by the Government and of the study result PHP. Case study method was used the study about existing of purse seiner boat fishermen in Pekalongan City as the study location. The sampling technique was carried out systematically. The data analysis used the qualitative descriptive and t-test statistic analysis. The qualitative descriptive analysis was used for analyzing the fish catch compositions and kind of fish species and determining the fish prices. The t-test was used for analyzing the significant differences of the PPP and PHP influences on determind the small pelagis purse seiner boat fisherman incomes, and comparing the amount of PHP by Goverment and study result PHP too. The result of study showed that the fish catch compositions of the 30 GT or more purse seiner boat {{for the last five years}}, namely in the 1997 — 2001 in Pekalongan, indicated that there were fluctuations of the production amounts. From the average production amount of each fish kind of purse seiner boat fish catches for the last five years the largest fish kind composition was Layang followed by Lemuru, then Banyar, Tembang, Selar and the other fish kinds have the least compositions. Of the fish kinds the salted fish composition was larger than the fresh or iced fish composition. The highest price of the purse seiner boat fish catches was the species of Banyar/Kembung and the lowest one was Tembang species. Based on the fish quality price of fresh or iced fish price was higher than the salted one. The PPP and PHP influenced the incomes of fishermen, especially of the purse seiner boat owner. Income at the first trip of the boat owner who has paid the PPP and PHP has a negative value or the boat owner suffered a financial loss. Mean while the boat owner who has not paid the PPP and PHP yet has a high income per trip. For the income per trip of captain, motorist, skilled worker, and crew who both has and has not paid PPP and PHP yet was not influenced by the magnitude of fishery levies. The one-year income of the purse seiner boat owner who has paid the PPP and PHP were lower than the owners who have not yet. While the incomes among their captains, motorist, siklled worker, crews were not much different. The <b>PHP</b> <b>value</b> of the government calculation based on the old HPI (Floor Price of Fish; The Decision of Trade and Industry Minister No. 213 / 2001) was much higher than the one based on the study calculation. But if we compared the PHP calculation based on the new HPI (Decision of Trade and Industry Minister No. 548 / 2002) with the one based on the study result calculation between them was not much differrence. Therefore it need immediately to socialize and iluminate the PHP imposition based on the new HPI calculation. ...|$|E
5000|$|Some languages, like Perl, support {{symbolic}} references, {{which are}} just string values that contain {{the names of}} variables. When a value {{that is not a}} regular reference is dereferenced, Perl considers it to be a symbolic reference and gives the variable with the name given by the <b>value.</b> <b>PHP</b> has a similar feature in the form of its [...] syntax.|$|R
50|$|It is {{possible}} to convert integer and float columns back to PHP numbers by setting the MYSQLI_OPT_INT_AND_FLOAT_NATIVE connection option, if using the mysqlnd library. If set, the mysqlnd library will check the result set meta data column types and convert numeric SQL columns to PHP numbers, if the <b>PHP</b> data type <b>value</b> range allows for it. This way, for example, SQL INT columns are returned as integers.|$|R
40|$|Web {{applications}} are increasingly popular victims of security attacks. Injection attacks, such as Cross Site Scripting or SQL Injection, are a persistent problem. Even though developers {{are aware of}} them, the suggested best practices for protection are error prone: unless all user input is consistently filtered, any application may be vulnerable. When hosting web applications, administrators face a dilemma: they can only deploy applications that are trusted or they risk their system’s security. To prevent injection vulnerabilities, we introduce PHP Aspis: a source code transformation tool that applies partial taint tracking at the language level. <b>PHP</b> Aspis augments <b>values</b> with taint meta-data to track their origin in order to detect injection vulnerabilities. To improve performance, PHP Aspis carries out taint propagation only in an application’s most vulnerable parts: thirdparty plugins. We evaluate PHP Aspis with Wordpress, a popular open source weblog platform, and show that it prevents all code injection exploits that were found in Wordpress plugins in 2010. ...|$|R
50|$|Basic {{object-oriented}} programming functionality was added in PHP 3. Object handling was completely rewritten for PHP 5, expanding the feature set and enhancing performance. In previous versions of PHP, objects were handled like primitive types. The drawback {{of this method}} was that the whole object was copied when a variable was assigned or passed as a parameter to a method. In the new approach, objects are referenced by handle, and not by <b>value.</b> <b>PHP</b> 5 introduced private and protected member variables and methods, along with abstract classes and final classes as well as abstract methods and final methods. It also introduced a standard way of declaring constructors and destructors, {{similar to that of}} other object-oriented languages such as C++, and a standard exception handling model. Furthermore PHP 5 added Interfaces and allows for multiple Interfaces to be implemented. There are special interfaces that allow objects to interact with the runtime system. Objects implementing ArrayAccess can be used with array syntax and objects implementing Iterator or IteratorAggregate can be used with the foreach language construct. The static method and class variable features in Zend Engine 2 do not work the way some would expect. There is no virtual table feature in the engine, so static variables are bound with a name instead of a reference at compile time.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to assess the value for money of introducing pneumococcal conjugate vaccines as part of the immunization program in a lower-middle income country, the Philippines, which is not eligible for GAVI support and lower vaccine prices. It also includes the newest clinical evidence evaluating the efficacy of PCV 10, which is lacking in other previous studies. A cost-utility analysis was conducted. A Markov simulation model was constructed to examine the costs and consequences of PCV 10 and PCV 13 against the current scenario of no PCV vaccination for a lifetime horizon. A health system perspective was employed to explore different funding schemes, which include universal or partial vaccination coverage subsidized by the government. Results were presented as incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) in Philippine peso (Php) per QALY gained (1 USD = 44. 20 Php). Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was performed to determine the impact of parameter uncertainty. With universal vaccination at a cost per dose of Php 624 for PCV 10 and Php 700 for PCV 13, both PCVs are cost-effective compared to no vaccination given the ceiling threshold of Php 120, 000 per QALY gained, yielding ICERs of Php 68, 182 and Php 54, 510 for PCV 10 and PCV 13, respectively. Partial vaccination of 25 % of the birth cohort resulted in significantly higher ICER <b>values</b> (<b>Php</b> 112, 640 for PCV 10 and Php 84, 654 for PCV 13) due to loss of herd protection. The budget impact analysis reveals that universal vaccination would cost Php 3. 87 billion to 4. 34 billion per annual, or 1. 6 to 1. 8 times the budget of the current national vaccination program. The inclusion of PCV in the national immunization program is recommended. PCV 13 achieved better value for money compared to PCV 10. However, the affordability and sustainability of PCV implementation over the long-term should be considered by decision makers...|$|R
