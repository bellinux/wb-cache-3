It is found that males experimental group receiving the feed additive in the diet «Tetra+» have better blood serum biochemical indices in comparison with the control group cockerels. This indicates that the feed additive «Tetra+» shows the properties to improve liver function and decreased intoxication of male manufacturers. It was revealed, that in the experimental group increased divorce figures, while the control group of males producing hatchability is reduced, and the end of observation of this indicator of the trend towards recovery is not evident. It recorded the highest percentage yield of hatching eggs from hens of the experimental group, while the control group showed a tendency to reduce this figure.

The nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequence for VP 2 hypervariable region of ten IBDVs were determined by RT-PCR, sequenced and compared to well characterised IBDV isolates worldwide.

Phylogenetically, Ethiopian IBDVs represented two genetic lineages: very virulent (vv) IBDVs or variants of the classical attenuated vaccine strain (D 78). The nucleotide identity between Ethiopian vvIBDVs ranged between 0 % to 2. 6 %.

40|$|ABSTRACT Shaver Starbro broiler breeder pullets {{were used}} to study the effect of day length (24 and 28 h) on egg {{production}} parameters and egg traits from 22 to 30 wk of age, and ovarian and morphological characteristics at 30 wk of age. Floor-housed pullets were raised in a light-tight facility from 1 d of age until housing in individ-ually illuminated cages at time of photostimulation (22 wk). Cages were equipped with hardware to monitor egg laying time. The photoschedule during rearing was 24 h light: 0 h dark for the first 3 d followed by 8 h light: 16 h dark from 3 d to photostimulation. Body weight was monitored throughout the trial to maintain weights at targets set by Shaver <b>Poultry</b> <b>Breeding</b> <b>Farms,</b> Ltd. The experimental design was a 2 × 2 factorial with two day lengths [hemeral (24 h) and ahemeral (28 h) ] and two BW groups [high (HBW) and low BW (LBW) ], with the LBW weighing 327 g less than the HBW birds at 22 wk of age. The hemeral photoschedule was 14 h light: 10 h dark, and the ahemeral photoschedule was 14 h light: 14 h dark. Differences in BW remained throughout the trial. Egg numbers were not increased by the 28 -h day (24 h = 25. 4 (Key words: broiler breeder, long ahemeral days, ovary morphology, egg production...|$|R

Hadlington persuaded the state government to acquire the farm for such a scheme it being thought that ex-servicemen including those disabled and even limbless would be able to make an adequate living for themselves and their families from poultry farming.

40|$|The {{importance}} of electrical energy for a contemporary society is increasing. However, {{most of people}} don´t realise possible consequences of power outage for agriculture. This thesis aims at presenting an analysis of power outage effects on agricultural breeding in MEC Soběslav area. Considering {{the aim of the}} thesis, there is a problem whether the selected <b>breeding</b> <b>farms</b> are ready enough for power outages. The theoretical part of the thesis characterises crisis management, integrated rescue system (IRS), critical infrastructure and electrical grid. The following part of the chapter deals with livestock, <b>poultry</b> and pig <b>breeding,</b> mainly {{from the point of view}} of their technological as well as technical equipment. The research part is based on pen and paper interviews with representatives and owners of <b>breeding</b> <b>farms.</b> The research was focused on a degree of dependency on electrical energy in MEC Soběslav area. Two <b>breeding</b> <b>farms</b> in Germany were selected for a comparison with the situation abroad. The results revealed that most of the <b>breeding</b> <b>farms</b> are strongly dependent on electrical energy. Thanks to the last modernisation, automatic feeding or water supplying became a common standard. Unfortunately, most of the modern <b>breeding</b> <b>farms</b> are not able to guarantee these procedures in case of power outage. Great amount of <b>breeding</b> <b>farms</b> don´t have any emergency sources of energy and those that own some, have only limited supplies of fuel. There are no contracts guaranteeing the fuel for the <b>breeding</b> <b>farms.</b> The most problematic situation concerns <b>poultry</b> <b>breeding,</b> where the breeding procedures are wholly controlled by information systems and even the minute failures cause massive losses. Therefore the research problem was confirmed because the <b>breeding</b> <b>farms</b> are not equipped for powers outages. This diploma thesis is supposed to be used for educational purposes or as the means of orientation in the problem for individual breeders. The purpose is the education of presented subjects...|$|R
50|$|At about 2.500 {{hectares}} each, {{the respective}} shares of agricultural lands and forests in Kemalpaşa are roughly equal. Among the lands used for agriculture, fruit orchards, principally cherries, {{take the lead}} at 33% (758 hectares), with olive trees (22%, 400 hectares) and vineyards (16%, 370 hectares) following. The portion occupied by vineyards and grains more than halved between 2000 and 2006, while the land used {{for the production of}} cherries doubled. Since cherries are relatively easier to maintain and process, and a large national and export market exists, their production increasingly attracts the attention of urban-based and hobby-minded producers who would assure the daily care outside the collect typically through the offices of one villager. There is also a growing tendency towards diversification in the vegetables produced, new breeds in demand by Izmir's customer base and previously unheard of like broccolis, asparagus, soybeans, kiwis, kakis, also making their appearance. The level of mechanisation in agricultural activities is high and well above the national averages.There are about 200 large dairies, <b>poultries</b> or livestock <b>breeding</b> <b>farms</b> across the district area, catering İzmir's huge market. The quantity of milk produced in Kemalpaşa in 2007 was 38.065 tonnes. There are 345.000 beehives and 345 tonnes honey and 10 tonnes of beeswax was produced in 2007.|$|R
