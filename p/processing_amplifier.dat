40|$|An electromagnetically {{suspended}} {{system can be}} regarded as a typical second order mass-spring-damping system. The system dynamic response and stability are somehow related to its PID (proportional, integral and derivative) controller feedback parameters. Although the integral feedback is largely used to eliminate its offset errors at lower frequency, the actual stiffness and damping coefficients related to PD control are vital for the accurate prediction of the {{suspended system}} responses during design stage. Numerous studies have attempted to estimate these coefficients directly or indirectly without much success. The problem is due to the frequency-dependent nature of the active magnetic bearing (AMB) system i. e. time lags in sensors, digital signal <b>processing,</b> <b>amplifiers,</b> filters, eddy current and hysteresis losses in the electromagnetic coils. This paper seeks to address this problem, by proposing a one-axis electromagnetic suspension system to simplify the measurement requirements and eliminate the possibility of control force cross-coupling capabilities. This would lead to a better understanding and a design platform for optimal vibration control strategy of suspended system. This is achieved by injecting Schroeder Phased Harmonic Sequences (SPHS), a multi-frequency test signal, to persistently excite all possible suspended system modes. By treating the system as a black box, the parameter estimation of the “actual ” stiffness and damping coefficients in the frequency domain are realised experimentally. The digitally implemented PID controller also facilitated changes on the feedback gains, and this allowed numerous system response measurements with their corresponding estimated stiffness and damping coefficients...|$|R

Also, many models were proposed to describe various complex networks, small-world network and scale-free network, etc. For more details, see the literature [1 – 4]. In the implementation of many practical CDNs, there exists time-delay because of the finite speed of information <b>processing</b> or <b>amplifiers.</b> It is well known that time-delay often causes undesirable dynamic behaviors such as oscillation and instability of the network. Therefore, various approaches to synchronization analysis for CDNs with time-delay have been investigated in the literature [5 – 12]. By using network modeling with coupling delays, Li et al. [5] proposed, for the first time, the synchronization criteria for the CDNs with time-delay which were expressed in the form of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Koo et al. [9] presented a synchronization criterion for singular CDNs with time-varying delays. In [10 – 12], various synchronization problems are addressed for discrete-time CDNs with time-delay. In this regard, discrete-time modeling with time-delay {{plays an important role in}} many fields of CDNs. Moreover, to implement the network, the network uses digital computers (usually a microprocessor or microcontrollers) with the necessary input/output hardware.

40|$|Development of brain-machine {{interfaces}} {{and treatment}} of neurological diseases can benefit from analysis of recorded data from implanted electrodes. Existing wireless neural recording systems are often bulky, dissipate too much heat to be implanted, or only have {{a small number of}} channels. Furthermore, advances in micro-machined electrodes provide the possibility of high-density recordings, but the companion electronics do not provide enough simultaneous channels with low enough power, wireless telemetry, or a small form-factor. A system level view of wireless recording-circuitry which could overcome these deficiencies is described in this work. The overall system comprises of an analog front end (AFE), digital signal processing (DSP), and transmitter (TX). Each block is analyzed, and system-level specifications are derived. Based on these specifications, each block can be optimized for low power and small area. The analog front-end uses open-loop amplifiers to support lower voltage operation than previously published work.

40|$|A large {{category}} of scientific investigation {{takes advantage of}} the interactions of signals in the frequency range from 300 to 1, 000 GHz and higher. This includes astronomy and atmospheric science, where spectral observations in this frequency range give information about molecular abundances, pressures, and temperatures of small-sized molecules such as water. Additionally, there is a minimum in the atmospheric absorption at around 670 GHz that makes this frequency useful for terrestrial imaging, radar, and possibly communications purposes. This is because 670 GHz is a good compromise for imaging and radar applications between spatial resolution (for a given antenna size) that favors higher frequencies, and atmospheric losses that favor lower frequencies. A similar trade-off applies to communications link budgets: higher frequencies allow smaller antennas, but incur a higher loss. All of these applications usually require converting the RF (radio frequency) signal at 670 GHz to a lower IF (intermediate frequency) for processing. Further, transmitting for communication and radar generally requires up-conversion from IF to the RF. The current state-of-the-art device for performing the frequency conversion is based on Schottky diode mixers for both up and down conversion in this frequency range for room-temperature operation. Devices that can operate at room temperature are generally required for terrestrial, military, and planetary applications that cannot tolerate the mass, bulk, and power consumption of cryogenic cooling. The technology has recently advanced to the point that amplifiers in the region up to nearly 1, 000 GHz are feasible.
