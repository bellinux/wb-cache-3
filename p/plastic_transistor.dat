40|$|Abstract—In this paper, amorphous-silicon (a-Si:H) {{thin-film}} transistors (TFTs) were fabricated on {{a plastic}} substrate, {{which was then}} permanently deformed into a spherical dome shape after the device fabrication process. The TFTs were patterned in an island structure to prevent cracking in the device films during the substrate deformation. In {{the majority of the}} TFTs, the off-current and gate leakage current do not change substantially. Depending on the island structure, the electron mobility either increased or decreased after deformation. This change in mobility was correlated with the mechanical strain in the device islands determined by finite element modeling of the deformation process. Tensile strain caused slightly higher mobility in planar structures. In a mesa-type structure, silicon films on top of the pillars could be in compression after the dome deformation, leading to a slight decrease in mobility.

We have fabricated arrays of organic thin-film transistors (OTFTs) and printed electronic components driving an electrophoretic ink display up to 70 mm by 70 mm on a single flexible transparent <b>plastic</b> foil. <b>Transistor</b> arrays were quickly and reliably configured for different logic functions by an additional process step of inkjet printing conductive silver wires and poly(3, 4 -ethylenedioxythiophene) :poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) resistors between transistors or between logic blocks. Among the circuit functions and features demonstrated on the arrays are a 7 -stage ring oscillator, a D-type flip-flop memory element, a 2 : 4 demultiplexer, a programmable array logic device (PAL), and printed wires and resistors. Touch input sensors were also printed, thus only external batteries were required for a complete electronic subsystem.

40|$|The {{merger of}} {{nanoscale}} building blocks with flexible and/or low cost substrates could enable {{the development of}} high-performance electronic and photonic devices {{with the potential to}} impact a broad spectrum of applications. Here we demonstrate that high-quality, single-crystal nanowires can be assembled onto inexpensive glass and flexible plastic substrates to create basic transistor and light-emitting diode devices. In our approach, the high-temperature synthesis of single-crystal nanowires is separated from ambient-temperature solution-based assembly to enable the fabrication of single-crystal-like devices on virtually any substrate. Silicon nanowire field-effect transistors were assembled on glass and plastic substrates and display device parameters rivaling those of single-crystal silicon and exceeding those of state-of-the-art amorphous silicon and organic transistors currently used for flexible electronics on <b>plastic</b> substrates. Nanowire <b>transistor</b> devices have been configured as low-threshold logic elements with gain; moreover, the high-performance characteristics are relatively unaffected by operation in a bent configuration or by repeated bending. The generality of this approach is further illustrated with the assembly of gallium nitride nanowire UV-light-emitting diodes on flexible plastic substrates. These results suggest that nanowires could serve as high-performance building blocks for the next of generation lightweight display, mobile computing, and information storage applications.

5000|$|As {{a thought}} {{experiment}} he proposed developing {{a set of}} one-quarter-scale manipulator hands slaved to the operator's hands to build one-quarter scale machine tools analogous {{to those found in}} any machine shop. This set of small tools would then be used by the small hands to build and operate ten sets of one-sixteenth-scale hands and tools, and so forth, culminating in perhaps a billion tiny factories to achieve massively parallel operations. He uses the analogy of a pantograph as a way of scaling down items. This idea was anticipated in part, down to the microscale, by science fiction author Robert A. Heinlein in his 1942 story Waldo.As the sizes got smaller, one would have to redesign some tools, because the relative strength of various forces would change. Although gravity would become unimportant, surface tension would become more important, Van der Waals attraction would become important, etc. Feynman mentioned these scaling issues during his talk. Nobody has yet attempted to implement this thought experiment, although it has been noted that some types of biological enzymes and enzyme complexes (especially ribosomes) function chemically in a way close to Feynman's vision. Feynman also mentioned in his lecture that it might be better eventually to use glass or plastic because their greater uniformity would avoid problems in the very small scale (metals and crystals are separated into domains where the lattice structure prevails.) This could be a good reason to make machines and also electronics out of glass and plastic. At the present time, there are electronic components made of both materials. In glass, there are optical fiber cables that amplify the light pulses at regular intervals, using glass doped with the rare earth erbium. The doped glass is spliced into the fiber and pumped by a laser operating at a different frequency. [...] In <b>plastic,</b> field effect <b>transistors</b> are being made with polythiophene, a plastic invented by Alan J. Heeger et al, that becomes an electrical conductor when oxidized. At this time, a factor of just 20 in electron mobility separates plastic from silicon.|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} synthesis of electronically diverse polycyclic aromatics within discrete molecular regimes and as incorporated into robust conjugated polymers. We have pursued two strategies for obtaining these large aromatics from rather elaborate yet readily available pendant aromatic precursors: electrophilic and oxidative cyclizations. Chapters One and Two describe research directed towards expansion of electrophilic cyclizations that utilize alkyne functionality to construct aromatized systems. Strongly-acidic conditions provide transient cationic intermediates that participate in annulations with adjacent arenes or amides to yield dibenzanthracenes or dioxanthracenes, respectively. In the latter case (Chapter Two), smaller model compounds confirmed this unique reactivity and helped to establish synthetic routes that yield isoquinolines in one synthetic step from aryl carbonyls appended with ortho-substituted alkynes. Chapters Three and Four describe efforts directed towards thiophene-based polycyclic aromatics. Tandem cyclization-polymerizations of pendant thiophenes provide robust electrochromic materials with readily tuneable optical bandgaps. Arenes placed adjacent to the highly-reactive oxidized thienyl moieties force this unique reactivity by biasing the system toward intramolecular cyclization. Chemical and electrochemical studies of related model systems further established the tandem reactivity. The generality of this controlled oxidative cyclization provided several readily-functionalized sulfur-based polycyclics. Using this chemistry, larger molecular and polymeric structures with tailored functionality may allow for a survey of electronic applications such as <b>plastic</b> organic field-effect <b>transistors.</b> (cont.) After employing the new routes to large polycyclic aromatics, these scaffolds helped to study the optimization of exciton migration and the mechanical tuneability of polymer chromicity. The thiophene-based platforms allowed for {{an assessment of the}} photophysical effects of chromophore aromatization within conjugated arylene-ethynylene polymers. As detailed in Chapter Four, the incorporation of planar and aromatized moieties greatly reduces the rate of fluorescence decay relative to closely-related yet non-aromatized structures. These easily-functionalized substrates also led to an examination of a new type of mechanochromism as introduced in Chapter Five. Conformational alterations within the polymer could lead to attenuated excimer-like behavior, and the synthetic schemes presented allow for the incorporation of a variety of discrete chromophores that may provide clean and sharp optical properties when compared to conformationally-disordered conjugated polymers. by John Dayton Tovar.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} we report the {{development}} of a range of high-performance thin-film transistors utilising different solution processable organic dielectrics grown at temperatures compatible with inexpensive substrate materials such as plastic. Firstly, we study the dielectric properties and application of a novel low-k fluoropolymer dielectric, named Hyflon AD (Solvay). The orthogonal nature of the Hyflon formulation, to most conventional organic semiconductors, allows fabrication of top-gate transistors with optimised semiconductor/dielectric interface. When used as the gate dielectric in organic transistors, this transparent and highly water-repellent polymer yields high-performance devices with excellent operating stability. In the case of top-gate organic transistors, hole and electron mobility values close to or higher than 1 cm 2 /Vs, are obtained. These results suggest that Hyflon AD is a promising candidate for use as dielectric in organic and potentially hybrid electronics. By taking advantage of the non-reactive nature of the Hyflon AD dielectric, the p-doping process of an organic blend semiconductor using a molybdenum based organometallic complex as the molecular dopant, has also been investigated for the first time. Although the much promising properties of Hyflon AD were demonstrated, the resulting transistors need, however, to be operated at high voltages typically in the range of 50 - 100 V. The latter results to a high power consumption by the discrete transistors as well as the resulting integrated circuits. Therefore, reduction in the operating voltage of these devices is crucial for the implementation of the technology in portable battery-operated devices. Our approach towards {{the development of}} low-voltage organic transistors and circuits explored in this work focused on the use of self-assembled monolayer (SAM) organics as ultra-thin gate dielectrics. Only few nanometres thick (2 - 5 nm), these SAM dielectrics are highly insulating and yield high geometrical capacitances in the range 0. 5 - 1 μF/cm 2. The latter has enabled the design and development of organic transistors with operating voltages down to a few volts. Using these SAM nanodielectrics high performance transistors with ambipolar transport characteristics have also been realised and combined to form low-voltage integrated circuits for the first time. In the final part of this thesis the potential of Hyflon AD and SAM dielectrics for application in the emerging area of graphene electronics, has been explored. To this end we have employed chemical vapour deposited (CVD) graphene layers that can be processed from solution onto the surface of the organic dielectric (Hyflon AD, SAM). By careful engineering of the graphene/dielectric interface we were able to demonstrate transistors with improved operating characteristics that include; high charge carrier mobility (1400 cm 2 /Vs), hysteresis free operation, negligible unintentional doping and improved reliability as compared to bare SiO 2 based devices. Importantly, the use of SAM nanodielectrics has enabled the demonstration of low voltage (<| 1. 5 | V) graphene transistors that have been processed from solution at low temperature onto flexible <b>plastic</b> substrates. Graphene <b>transistors</b> with tuneable doping characteristics were also demonstrated by taking advantage of the SAM’s flexible chemistry and more specifically the type of the chemical SAM end-group employed. Overall, the work described in this thesis represents a significant step towards flexible carbon-based electronics where large-volume and low-temperature processing are required.
