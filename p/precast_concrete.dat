5|$|The built {{environment}} around Coatbridge's town centre is characterised by its mixture of late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century sandstone buildings and late twentieth-century <b>precast</b> <b>concrete</b> shops. The leafy Blairhill and Dunbeth conservation areas {{to the west}} and north of the town centre comprise detached, semi-detached and terraced sandstone residential buildings. The bulk of the remaining surrounding areas consist of various twentieth-century local authority housing buildings. Several high rise flats dominate the skyline. Due to the decline of industries, several private housing estates have been built on reclaimed land.|$|E
5|$|The {{demise of}} the once {{thriving}} canal and maltings businesses brought about a serious decline in Banagher's fortunes, including a significant population decrease. However, a number of businesses kept {{many people in the}} locality employed during lean times. The most notable of these was Bord na Móna, a semi-state company founded in 1946 to manage the harvesting of peat from Ireland's bogs, the most extensive of which are located in the midlands. However, the advancement of mechanised harvesting, the exhaustion of the bogs and the closure of a number of peat-fired power stations, means that this is no longer a significant employer in the region. Green Isle Foods had a facility just outside Banagher and provided good employment during the 1970s and 1980s. It was taken out of production some years ago and is now used as a storage facility only. The largest industry in Banagher these days is Banagher <b>Precast</b> <b>Concrete</b> Limited, a company specialising in <b>precast</b> <b>concrete</b> structures. The company employs approximately 150 people {{and was one of the}} largest concrete firms in the country, employing over 400 people at its peak in 2008. It has supplied components for many major projects, including the Aviva Stadium, Croke Park, Channel Tunnel, the Dublin Port Tunnel, Thomond Park and the Limerick Tunnel, and most recently Páirc Uí Chaoimh in Cork. Other notable employers include Banagher Sawmills and the cruise liner businesses located at the marina.|$|E

This thesis studies deeply the crack development characteristics, failure pattern, hysteresis curve and the displacement ductility of unbonded <b>precast</b> reinforced <b>concrete</b> frame, by analyzing one unbonded <b>precast</b> reinforced <b>concrete</b> frame under low reversed cyclic load test. We build a model using finite element analysis software to the test piece model analysis, the analysis result consistent with the experimental results. Experimental studies indicate that assembly of prestressed reinforced concrete frame structure has a good seismic performance.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of nonlinear fi nite element analyses conducted to model the behavior of L-shaped, <b>precast,</b> prestressed <b>concrete</b> spandrels constructed with open web reinforcement. The fi nite element model was calibrated using experi-mental results from recent tests of slender, L-shaped, <b>precast,</b> prestressed <b>concrete</b> spandrels. Detailed correlative studies between analytical and experi-mental results are presented, demonstrating the capability of the fi nite element program to describe the observed experimental behavior. The feasibility of using open web reinforcement in compact, L-shaped, <b>precast,</b> prestressed <b>concrete</b> spandrels to achieve a more construction-friendly reinforcement scheme is also examined. Five differ-ent web reinforcement confi gurations for the com-pact spandrels were studied in order to evaluate the contribution of closed stirrups to the spandrels’ shear-torsion behavior. The behavior, ultimate load-carrying capacity, and mode of failure of both the slender and compact L-shaped <b>precast,</b> prestressed <b>concrete</b> spandrels are presented. For loading values near the ultimate, the out-of-plane bending behavior of compact, L-shaped, <b>precast,</b> prestressed <b>concrete</b> spandrels is strongly infl uenced by the web-reinforcement confi guration. Results from the analysis show that for long-span, compact spandrels, open web rein-forcement can be used effectively to resist torsional forces throughout the member...|$|R

5|$|During the Second World War {{the running}} of Gibb and Partners fell largely to Paton and James Guthrie Brown. Gibb and Partners gained {{a large number of}} {{government}} contracts and within a few weeks of {{the start of the war}} in September 1939 the workforce increased by 2000. Paton designed and sited several Royal Ordnance Factories; and in March 1940 travelled to Turkey to construct an iron and steel works there. Whilst in Turkey he was contracted to build emplacements to contain guns from mothballed battleships in the Dardanelles. The construction of the emplacements was completed but the guns would later be prevented from reaching the site by the Axis occupation of Greece. Paton made his way back to Britain via Greece, Italy and France and arrived home two days prior to the Italian declaration of war against the Allies on 10 June 1940. He also constructed a plant at Barry in South Wales for the extraction of Magnesium Hydroxide from the sea, a turbine factory for British Thomson-Houston Company and a £7 million underground aircraft engine factory. From 1943-44 Paton supervised the construction, in London Docks, of the <b>precast</b> <b>concrete</b> caissons required for the construction of Mulberry Harbours following the Normandy Landings. From 1944-45 he was in charge of the rebuilding of houses damaged by V-2 rockets in the London districts of Wanstead and Woodford.|$|E

40|$|The use of <b>precast,</b> {{prestressed}} <b>concrete</b> piles in {{the foundation}} of bridge piers has long been recognized as a valuable option for bridge owners and designers. However, {{the use of these}} <b>precast,</b> prestressed <b>concrete</b> piles in integral abutment bridges has not been widespread because of concerns over pile flexibility and the potential for concrete cracking and deterioration of the prestressing strands due to long-term exposure to moisture. This report presents the details of the first integral abutment bridge in the state of Iowa that utilized <b>precast,</b> prestressed <b>concrete</b> piles in the abutment. The bridge, which was constructed in Tama County in 2000, consists of a 110 ft. long, 30 ft. wide, single-span PC girder superstructure with a left-side-ahead 20 º skew angle. The bridge was instrumented with a variety of strain gages, displacement sensors, and thermocouples to monitor and help in the assessment of structural behavior. The results of this monitoring are presented, and recommendations are made for future application of <b>precast,</b> prestressed <b>concrete</b> piles in integral abutment bridges. In addition to the structural monitoring data, this report presents the results of a survey questionnaire that had been mailed to each of the 50 state DOT chief bridge engineers to ascertain their current practices for <b>precast,</b> prestressed <b>concrete</b> piles and especially the application of these piles in integral abutment bridges...|$|R

25|$|Deep-set {{windows in}} {{rectilinear}} shapes, a Breuer trademark, were {{planned for the}} facade. The window frames were made of <b>precast</b> <b>concrete.</b> The building was the first Breuer-designed structure in the United States to use a <b>precast</b> <b>concrete</b> facade, {{and this was the}} first federal building to be built of <b>precast</b> <b>concrete.</b> The facade was designed to be load-bearing, with the panels on the second, third, and fourth floors designed to carry the weight of the building. The window frames on the eighth, ninth, and tenth floors were slightly thinner, because although they were not load-bearing they had to contain HVAC piping. The panels on the middle floors required the least amount of fabrication, according to architect Herbert Beckhard (an associate in Breuer's firm who helped design the building), as they did not need to bear as much load nor contain much piping. The windows do not meet {{at the corner of the}} concrete frame. Pipes from the I-395 tunnel (which runs below the building) run up through the building's walls and vent at the corners of the window frames, dispersing automobile exhaust fumes high in the air. Each concrete unit is three feet (0.9 metres) thick and weighs almost 13 tons (11.8 metric tonnes). The firm which supplied the window frames had no previous experience producing architectural concrete, but instead had supplied precast forms for bridges and parking garages.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} {{nursing home}} complex was a 1,906sqft(177m²) brick building {{consisting of two}} floors. In 1959, a second building {{was added to the}} rear which includes a garden.
