50|$|<b>Product-based</b> {{planning}} {{is a fundamental}} part of the PRINCE2 approach to project management, and is a method of identifying all of the products (project deliverables) that make up or contribute to delivering {{the objectives of the}} project, and the associated work required to deliver them. The documents which define the Project itself are also considered Products.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Product-based</b> {{planning}} {{is intended to}} ensure that all of the necessary products are identified and captured, and begins by identifying a product breakdown structure which is then repeatedly refined until all of the requisite products are identified. The PBS is thus a hierarchical family tree of all the products and sub-products that comprise the final end-product.|$|E
50|$|The two {{ratings are}} multiplied (how often × how bad) {{to create a}} single score for each item. These <b>product-based</b> scores are then {{converted}} to item scores that reflect both the frequency and intensity of symptom endorsement (range = 0-4).Item product scores convert to item total scores: 0-1 = 0, 2-3 = 1, 4-6 = 2, 8-12 = 3, and 15+ = 4.|$|E
5000|$|One key {{indication}} that a brand {{has become a}} lifestyle is when it successfully expands beyond its original product. For example, Nike {{used to be a}} <b>product-based</b> company, focusing on making running shoes. But over time, the company and its logo has become associated with the athletic subculture. That has allowed Nike to expand into related athletic categories, such as sports equipment and apparel ...|$|E

50|$|Michael Porter, a {{graduate}} of Harvard University, wrote a book in 1985 which identified three strategies that businesses can use to tackle competition. This book was named the ninth most influential management book of the 20th century. These approaches {{can be applied to}} all businesses whether they are <b>product-based</b> or service-based. He called these approaches generic strategies. They include cost leadership, differentiation and focus. These strategies have been created to improve and gain competitive advantage over competitors. These strategies can also be recognized as the comparative advantage and the differential advantage.|$|E
5000|$|The main {{advantage}} of any BPO {{is the way}} in which it helps increase a company's flexibility. However, several sources have different ways in which they perceive organizational flexibility. In early 2000s BPO was all about cost efficiency, which allowed a certain level of flexibility at the time. Due to technological advances and changes in the industry (specifically the move to more service-based rather than <b>product-based</b> contracts), companies who choose to outsource their back-office increasingly look for time flexibility and direct quality control. Business process outsourcing enhances the flexibility of an organization in different ways: ...|$|E
5000|$|One {{explanation}} for this culture of leisure is the hot, dry climate of the peninsula which allowed nomadic herding but permitted agriculture only in a small area (the southwest corner). Like other nomadic herders worldwide, the ancestors of most Saudis did not develop the habits (so-called [...] "work ethic"), skills, infrastructure, etc. of agricultural societies [...] "that lead ultimately to present-day industrialisation". As a consequence, [...] "Saudis have rarely worked {{in the sense that}} other nationalities have worked. No <b>product-based</b> commercial economy existed until oil" [...] was discovered.|$|E
50|$|Basically {{this means}} that a {{circular}} business model is not focused merely on selling a product, but encompasses a shift in thinking about value proposition, bringing forward {{a whole range of}} different business models to be used. To mention just a few examples: product-service systems, virtualized services, and collaborative consumption which encompasses the sharing economy. This comprises both the incentives and benefits offered to customers for bringing back used products and a change in revenue streams, comprising payments for a circular product or service, or payments for delivered availability, usage, or performance related to the <b>product-based</b> service offered.|$|E
5000|$|By 1984, U.S. {{regulators}} {{had removed}} {{many of the}} restrictions regarding the placement of promotional content within children's television programming. The way was cleared for the new <b>product-based</b> television program. Hasbro had previously worked with Marvel Comics to develop G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero for a three-pronged marketing scheme - the toyline, a tie-in comic book by Marvel, and an animated mini-series co-produced by Marvel's media arm, Marvel Productions, and the Griffin-Bacal Advertising Agency's Sunbow Productions animation studio. Given the success of that strategy, the process was repeated in 1984 when Hasbro marketing vice president Bob Prupis approached Marvel to develop their new robot series, which Jay Bacal dubbed [...] "Transformers." ...|$|E
50|$|The Center for Pharmaceutical Research and Innovation (CPRI) is a University of Kentucky-based {{research}} center {{established by the}} University of Kentucky College of Pharmacy in 2012 to facilitate academic translational research and drug discovery/drug development. The UK CPRI specializes in natural <b>product-based</b> drug discovery from microbes found within unique environments including underground and surface coal mines, acid mine drainage and mine reclamation sites, thermal vents associated with underground coal mine fires (see coal seam fire) and deep-well drilling for carbon sequestration. CPRI also provides core support for medicinal chemistry, assay development and screening, rational drug design, computational chemistry, and ADMET.

50|$|A {{significant}} {{advantage of}} <b>product-based</b> planning {{is the ability}} to surface critical assumptions and constraints. For example, if your project is to build another floor on top of a house a required product will be the floor underneath on which to build the one you are commissioned to deliver. As a product you hope that it is there and will be fit for purpose but as you are not commissioned to deliver it, it falls outside your scope - and into your assumptions. In this way, by defining the whole product set necessary for the project, and not just those that are in your scope, you can surface and document the critical assumptions. Another advantage compared to activity-based planning has to do with reporting. Products are either finished or not, activities can be 90% finished for a long time even though work is taking place. One tends to forget things that have to be done to complete a project. This method captures them all, reducing the chance that any will be overlooked.|$|E
50|$|Advertising Rhetoric {{focuses on}} persuasion, {{so it is}} no {{surprise}} that advertising would be present in some examples of procedural rhetoric. Bogost describes a possible effect of advertising procedural rhetoric in the game Animal Crossing. Although the game is targeted to children, there are certain rare things in the game that can only be found during the late hours of the night, meaning that the child would have to ask permission to acquire this rare item or enlist the help of parent(s) to acquire it. Bogost argues that this could be incentivized by the parents—for example, “do your chores and I will let you stay up to get it”—which shows the persuasive effect video games could have on both the parent and the child. Frasca sees advertising as especially prevalent in procedural rhetoric, arguing that advertisers “see in games a tool for persuasion” and noting the prevalence of <b>product-based</b> “advergames.” Advergames make it especially clear that games in general contain ideological content because players understand that advergames have an explicit agenda.|$|E
5000|$|Another use of musharaka in Pakistan is {{by one of}} {{the largest}} Islamic banks (Meezan Bank) which has {{attempted}} to remedy a major problem of Islamic banking — namely providing lines of credit for the working needs of client firms. This it does with a (putative) musharaka [...] "Islamic running finance facility". Since the workhorses of Islamic finance are <b>product-based</b> vehicles such as murabaha, which expire once the product has been financed, they do not provide steady funding -- a line of credit -- for firms to draw on. The Islamic running finance facility does. The bank contributes its investment to the firm as a partner by covering the [...] "firms net (negative) position {{at the end of the}} day". [...] "Profit is accrued to the bank daily on its net contribution using the Karachi Interbank Offered Rate plus a bank-set margin as the pricing basis".. However according to critic Feisal Khan, this is an Islamic partnership in name only and no different than a [...] "conventional line of credit on a daily product basis".|$|E
50|$|SIT {{approaches}} New Product Development {{by identifying}} and applying certain well-defined schemes derived from an historical analysis of <b>product-based</b> trends, termed patterns or templates. These templates {{may contribute to}} the understanding and prediction of new product emergence. The invention of new products has traditionally involved methods that encourage the generation of large numbers of ideas. The notion that the rewards of generating a large number of ideas outweigh the costs {{can be traced back to}} early studies in the field.In view of the fact that this process tends to be highly complex and un-formalized, those involved in generating new ideas may seek ways to become more productive as they progress from one ideation task to another. Some may succeed in identifying patterns of invention that are common to different contexts and apply them within a certain product category, or even try to apply them to other product categories. Individuals who adopt such a cognitive strategy may expect to gain an advantage over others who treat every task as new and unrelated to past ideation. However, even if they prove productive, the patterns are likely to be idiosyncratic and, quite often, not even verbally definable. As such, they lack permanence and generalizability. SIT sets is built on the thesis that certain patterns are identifiable, objectively verifiable, widely applied, and learnable, and that these patterns, termed templates, can serve as a facilitative tool that channels the ideation process, enabling the individual to be more productive and focused.|$|E

The company and its franchise Vihaan are also being investigated in India. The Bombay High Court denied the anticipatory bail plea of all the directors of Vihaan Direct Selling Pvt Ltd., a franchise of QNet, which included world amateur billiards champion Michael Ferreira after it was earlier rejected by Sessions Court. They were facing charges of cheating and forgery [...] The court observed that [...] "the deceit and fraud is camouflaged {{under the name of}} e-marketing and business". The Delhi High Court also called it a multi-victim scam and refused to quash FIR against the directors of Indian franchise of Qnet, Vihaan Direct Selling Private Limited. The Serious Fraud Investigation Office, in its report on GoldQuest and QuestNet India has called multi-level marketing (MLM) schemes run by overseas operators as [...] "a potential threat to national security". The Government of India ordered the Serious Fraud Investigation Office to file prosecution against GoldQuest International and QuestNet Enterprise under the Companies Act and Indian Penal Code. A brief executive summary of the SFIO report is now available in the public domain. The company has denied the allegations.|$|E

The aim of the present study was to examine how exposure to such programs might impact on one of the most important domains of young children 2 ̆ 7 s development: pretend play. Thirty-six preschoolers in Australia watched 1 of 3 different types of television program (<b>product-based</b> with action-adventure themes; <b>product-based</b> with educational themes; or non-product-based) and were given a range of <b>product-based</b> and non-product-based toys to play with. Contrary to expectation, program type had minimal impact on the overall frequency of pretend play children engaged in. However, compared to educational <b>product-based</b> programs and non-product-based programs, children who watched action-adventure <b>product-based</b> programs exhibited significantly less acts of novel pretense and significantly more acts of imitative pretense. Findings such as this are critical to the ongoing debate surrounding the regulation of television content aimed at children...|$|E
