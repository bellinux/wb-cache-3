5|$|Things {{come to a}} {{head the}} day after the party. As Cassandra uses a voodoo doll on Masha, trying to dissuade {{thoughts}} of selling the house, Sonia receives a <b>phone</b> <b>call</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> man she met at the party, requesting a date. Hesitantly, she accepts. Vanya, who is secretly writing a play inspired by Konstantin's imagined symbolist drama in The Seagull, is convinced by Nina to let her read {{it in front of the}} others. During the reading (which stars Nina as a molecule and takes place after the destruction of the earth), Spike rudely answers a text on his phone, and dismisses Vanya's suggestion of a handwritten response. Vanya reacts by launching into an impassioned rant, criticizing America's cultural regression in communication and media, while fondly and wistfully recalling the surroundings and memories of his childhood. Concluding that the intent of such progress seems to make people like him feel lost and forgotten, he retreats into the kitchen in tears.|$|E

25|$|All {{telephone}} numbers {{are removed from}} the site's main pages after two months (though still available on the site's forums), to avoid another case {{like that of the}} Milwaukee bank teller, who received a threatening <b>phone</b> <b>call</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> man who had obtained her number from the website. The woman had never been online or even owned a computer, and was forced to change her number, which had previously been registered to the subject of a Perverted-Justice sting.|$|E

Foley, U.S. ambassador to Haiti, got a <b>phone</b> <b>call</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> high-level aide to Aristide, asking if the U.S. could protect Aristide and help facilitate his departure if he resigned. The call prompted {{a series of}} events that included a middle-of-the-night phone call to President Bush and a scramble to find a plane to carry Aristide into exile. He traveled voluntarily via motorcade to the airport with his own retinue of security guards, including some contracted Americans. Before takeoff, Aristide gave a copy of his resignation letter to Foley's aide.|$|E

He said it was a works van and it was being driven erratically. The man did not come forward with this information during the initial investigation.

25|$|When {{specifically}} {{questioned about}} Robert Piest, Gacy confessed to strangling the youth {{at his house}} {{on the evening of}} December 11 after luring him there, adding that he had been interrupted by a <b>phone</b> <b>call</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> business colleague while doing so; he also admitted to having slept alongside the youth's body that evening before disposing of the corpse in the Des Plaines River the following evening. The reason he had arrived at the Des Plaines police station in a dirty and disheveled manner {{in the early hours of}} December 13 was that he had been in a minor traffic accident after disposing of Piest's body, en route to his appointment with Des Plaines officers. In this accident, his vehicle had slid off an ice-covered road, and he had unsuccessfully attempted to free the vehicle himself before the vehicle had to be towed from its location. He also confessed to police he had buried the body of John Butkovitch in his garage. To assist officers in their search for the victims buried in his house, Gacy drew a diagram of his basement to show where the bodies were buried.|$|E
25|$|In 1932, Curley Byrd—who {{served as}} the university's {{football}} and baseball coach, athletic director, and president—proposed adopting the diamondback terrapin as a mascot. The first statue of Testudo cast in bronze was donated by the Class of 1933 and displayed on Baltimore Avenue in front of Ritchie Coliseum. However, the 300-pound sculpture was subjected to vandalism by visiting college athletic teams. One such incident occurred in 1947 when students from Johns Hopkins University stole the bronze statue and moved it to their campus. Maryland students traveled to Baltimore to retrieve it, laying siege to the house where it was hidden. Over 200 city police responded to quell the riot. In 1949, University President Byrd was awakened by a <b>phone</b> <b>call</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> University of Virginia fraternity requesting that Testudo be removed from their lawn. Testudo was later filled with 700 pounds of cement and fastened to his pedestal to prevent future removals, but students at rival schools continued to vandalize it. It was moved to Maryland Stadium in 1951. In the 1960s, Testudo was moved back to a spot in front of McKeldin Library.|$|E

500|$|The {{original}} release {{contained a}} song called [...] "Yellow Fever", which was about having sex with Asian women, {{as well as a}} hidden track on track number 69 on the original release. It consisted of an audio collage featuring Howard Stern talking about peanut butter, a televangelist, a news broadcast on the disease Lupus (a reference to Lüpüs Thünder), a <b>phone</b> <b>call</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> drunk friend of Jimmy's, and other assorted oddities.

On Carchon's corpse, Nico discovers a ticket stamped [...] "Bateaux de la Conciergerie" [...] and goes to investigate the dock where the Conciergerie was.

However, she receives a mysterious <b>phone</b> <b>call</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> man called Plantard, who tells her he needs to speak to her about her story.|$|E

Shatner remains defiantly in the Captain's chair, as Herb Goodman mentions to Shatner he got a <b>phone</b> <b>call</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> margarine company. Finally, the set is completely dismantled, and still in his chair, Shatner, as Captain Kirk, makes a final entry into his log recalling his previous three years of space exploration, concluding: [...] "And except for one television network, we have found intelligence everywhere in the galaxy." [...] Raising his hand in the Vulcan salute, he goes on, [...] "Live long and prosper". Then he brings his fingers together, his hand still raised, and adds, [...] "Promise".|$|E
500|$|Several {{incidents}} hindered {{the production}} of the episode. The prop department for The X-Files initially made a fake ransom note for the scene wherein Mrs. LaPierre automatically writes the kidnappers message. A crew member for the show later took the note, along with a folder of other documents to one of the filming locations. Before arriving at the location, he stopped to make a <b>phone</b> <b>call</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> pay phone. A person, however, was watching him from their house and, being suspicious, called the police. Unfortunately for the crew member, he left the folder and note, which included the line [...] "Don't do anything or we'll kill your baby" [...] at the booth. When the individual went back to retrieve the note, he was promptly arrested. Director Kim Manners later called the situation a [...] "mess".|$|E

500|$|Leading pro-establishment figures {{cast doubt}} on the mainland's {{supposed}} role in the disappearances: Ip Kwok-him said {{that it was possible to}} use mainland telephone lines in Hong Kong, so the <b>phone</b> <b>call</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> Shenzhen number did not necessarily mean Lee was in the mainland; he added that there was no evidence of abduction. After Lee's wife cancelled her police report, Yiu Si-wing disputed the need for LegCo to discuss his disappearance due to the cancellation; Michael Tien said that if Lee had voluntarily gone to the mainland, it could not be a question of mainland officials acting across the border; Wong Kwok-kin said that kidnappers demand ransoms and not cancellation of missing persons reports. Regina Ip said it was odd that Lee would be able to apparently telephone his wife freely if he was in custody, unlike if he was detained in Hong Kong. Ng Leung-sing, during a Legislative Council discussion, claimed to have received a tip from [...] "an old friend" [...] that all five booksellers had taken clandestine speedboats to Wai Lingding Island (...) , an island south of Hong Kong that is administratively part of mainland China with no border facilities, and had been arrested for seeking prostitutes. The allegations of prostitution, criticised by pro-democracy figures as character assassination, were carried by TVB on its prime time evening news as the leading item. Ng later apologised under pressure, saying that he had repeated a rumour without having checked the facts but never mentioned Lee's name. Ng said he was merely trying to state that it was indeed possible to leave Hong Kong without identity documents, and that it was inappropriate to speculate at present. Lee's wife criticised Ng for his insincere apology.|$|E
