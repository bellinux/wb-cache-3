5|$|These {{moves are}} {{designed}} to be used in flurry combinations. For instance, the player can Seismic Slam an opponent, which pulls in enemies, and progress into a Rising Uppercut, which tosses the opponent into the air. During that toss, the player can charge the Rocket Punch and release as the opponent returns to the ground. Alternatively, the player can launch into the air, <b>pick</b> <b>an</b> opponent to slam, and punch them at close range. The character is built for aggressive playstyles and advanced players.|$|E
5|$|Coming {{into the}} Gator Bowl, the Virginia Tech defense was ranked first in total defense, second in pass defense, fourth in rushing defense, {{and third in}} scoring defense, {{allowing}} an average of just over 12points per game. The Virginia Tech defense was led by defensive end Darryl Tapp, a first-team All-ACC <b>pick,</b> <b>an</b> American Football Coaches Association (AFCA) All-American, {{a finalist for the}} Lott Trophy, and a finalist for the Ted Hendricks Award. Tapp was considered a natural leader {{both on and off the}} field and led the Hokies' defensive workouts during practice. Tapp finished the regular season with 45tackles (including 12.5 for a loss) and ten sacks. He was also named a second-team Associated Press All-American, and he won the Dudley Award, given annually to the best college football player in the state of Virginia.|$|E
5|$|The film {{opens with}} Kabir (Abhay Deol) proposing to Natasha (Kalki Koechlin). Their {{families}} {{meet at the}} engagement party where Natasha learns that Kabir is planning a three-week bachelor road trip to Spain with his school friends Imran (Farhan Akhtar) and Arjun (Hrithik Roshan). Kabir explains that the three have a long-standing pact, and that during the road trip, each of them will have to <b>pick</b> <b>an</b> adventure sport which all three will try together. Initially, Arjun is reluctant to take trip as {{he does not want}} to lose his pay for missing work.

Imran has an additional secret agenda on the trip, to find his biological father Salman Habib (Naseeruddin Shah), an artist in Spain, about whom he learnt soon after the death of his step-father.|$|E

25|$|More subtly, {{we should}} be able to {{determine}} our next action based on the results of previous actions. To do this, Haskell has an operator >>= (pronounced bind) with type IO a → (a → IOnbsp&b) → IOnbsp&b. That is, the operand on the left is an I/O action that returns a value of type a; the operand on the right is a function that can <b>pick</b> <b>an</b> I/O action based on the value produced by the action on the left. The resulting combined action, when performed, performs the first action, then evaluates the function with the first action's return value, then performs the second action, and finally returns the second action's value.|$|E
25|$|After 1815 {{the demand}} for bison robes began to rise gradually, {{although}} the beaver still remained the primary trade item. The 1840s saw {{a rise in the}} bison trade as the beaver trade begin to decline. Many Métis adapted to this new economic opportunity. This change of trade item made it harder for Métis to operate within companies like the HBC, but this made them welcome allies of the Americans who wanted to push the British to the Canada–US border. Although the Métis would initially operate {{on both sides of the}} border, by the 1850s they were forced to <b>pick</b> <b>an</b> identity and settle either north or south of the border. The period of the 1850s was thus one of migration for the Métis, many of whom drifted and established new communities or settled within existing Canadian, American or Indian communities.|$|E
25|$|The {{supplement}} of {{an interior}} angle is called an exterior angle, that is, an interior angle and an exterior angle form a linear pair of angles. There are two exterior angles at each vertex of the polygon, each determined by extending {{one of the}} two sides of the polygon that meet at the vertex; these two angles are vertical angles and hence are equal. An exterior angle measures the amount of rotation one has to make at a vertex to trace out the polygon. If the corresponding interior angle is a reflex angle, the exterior angle should be considered negative. Even in a non-simple polygon it may be possible to define the exterior angle, but one will have to <b>pick</b> <b>an</b> orientation of the plane (or surface) to decide the sign of the exterior angle measure.|$|E

25|$|In the {{immediate}} post-war era the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) was inundated with requests {{to set up}} new television stations. Worrying about congestion of {{the limited number of}} channels available, the FCC put a moratorium on all new licenses in 1948 while considering the problem. A solution was immediately forthcoming; rapid development of radio receiver electronics during the war had opened a wide band of higher frequencies to practical use, and the FCC set aside a large section of these new UHF bands for television broadcast. At the time, black and white television broadcasting was still in its infancy in the U.S., and the FCC started to look at ways of using this newly available bandwidth for color broadcasts. Since no existing television would be able to tune in these stations, they were free to <b>pick</b> <b>an</b> incompatible system and allow the older VHF channels to die off over time.|$|E
25|$|In October 2014, Mexico's Industrial Construction Chamber {{announced}} that Grupo Garza Ponce {{was among the}} bidders {{for the construction of}} Mexico City's New International Airport. In the bidding process were other construction companies based in Nuevo León, Jalisco, and State of Mexico. This new construction was intended to take place next to the Mexico City International Airport, which was needed additional space to reduce traffic saturation. The design of the new airport was done by Norman Foster, the owner of Foster and Partners, along with Mexican architect Fernando Romero, relative of Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim. Slim's construction company Grupo Carso was also among the bidders. The value of the project was estimated to be at around US$9.12 billion. Mexico's Secretary of Communications and Transportation Gerardo Ruiz Esparza stated that the government of President Enrique Peña Nieto (2012–2018) likely going to <b>pick</b> <b>an</b> foreign construction company with experience in airport construction for this project.

25|$|Let ABC be an {{isosceles}} triangle with AB and AC being the equal sides. <b>Pick</b> <b>an</b> arbitrary point D on side AB and construct E on AC so that AD=AE. Draw the lines BE, DC and DE. Consider the triangles BAE and CAD; BA=CA, AE=AD, and angle A {{is equal to}} itself, so by side-angle-side, the triangles are congruent and corresponding sides and angles are equal. Therefore angle ABE = angle ACD, angle ADC = angle AEB, and BE=CD. Since AB=AC and AD=AE, BD=CE by subtraction of equal parts. Now consider the triangles DBE and ECD; BD=CE, BE=CD, and angle DBE = angle ECD have just been shown, so applying side-angle-side again, the triangles are congruent. Therefore angle BDE = angle CED and angle BED = angle CDE. Since angle BDE = angle CED and angle CDE = angle BED, angle BDC = angle CEB by subtraction of equal parts. Consider a third pair of triangles, BDC and CEB; DB=EC, DC=EB, and angle BDC = angle CEB, so applying side-angle-side a third time, the triangles are congruent. In particular, angle CBD = BCE, {{which was to be}} proved.|$|E
