5|$|<b>Petticoats</b> made of {{horsehair}} crinoline appeared around 1839, proving {{so successful}} that the name 'crinoline' began to refer to supportive <b>petticoats</b> in general, rather than solely to the material. By 1847, crinoline fabric was {{being used as a}} stiffening for skirt linings, although English women preferred separate crinoline fabric <b>petticoats</b> which were beginning to collapse under the increasing weight of the skirts. One alternative to horsehair crinoline was the quilted petticoat stuffed with down or feathers, such as that reportedly worn in 1842 by Lady Aylesbury. However, quilted skirts were not widely produced until the early 1850s. In about 1849, it was possible to buy stiffened and corded cotton fabric for making <b>petticoats,</b> marketed as 'crinoline,' and designed as a substitute for the horsehair textile. The artificial crinoline with hoops did not emerge until the 1850s.|$|E
5|$|By the 1850s {{the term}} {{crinoline}} was more usually {{applied to the}} fashionable silhouette provided by horsehair <b>petticoats,</b> and to the hoop skirts that replaced them in the mid-1850s. In form and function these hoop skirts were similar to the 16th- and 17th-century farthingale and to 18th-century panniers, in that they too enabled skirts to spread even wider and more fully.|$|E
5|$|The {{crinoline}} {{needed to}} be rigid enough to support the skirts in their accustomed shape, but also flexible enough to be temporarily pressed out of shape and spring back afterwards. Other materials used for crinolines included whalebone, gutta-percha and vulcanised caoutchouc (natural rubber). The idea of inflatable hoops was short-lived as they were easily punctured, prone to collapse, and due {{to the use of}} brimstone in the manufacture of rubber, they smelled unpleasant. Although hard rubber hoops of gutta-percha worked satisfactorily at first, they were brittle and easily crushed without recovering their form. Despite objections that the sharp points of snapped steels were hazardous, lightweight steel was clearly the most successful option. It reduced the number of <b>petticoats</b> and their weight, and offered increased freedom of movement of the legs. However, hasty or careless movements in a hoop skirt could lead to accidentally revealing more than intended. An advertisement published in The Lady's Newspaper in 1863 for a cage crinoline with waved hoops attempted to reassure the potential customer that while wearing it, activities such as climbing stairs, passing to her theatre seat, dropping into armchairs and leaning against furniture would be possible without hindrance either to herself or to others around her.|$|E

5|$|The {{presence}} of numerous Mahasatikals (or Mastikal – hero stones {{for a woman}} who accepted ritual death upon the demise of her husband) indicates the popularity of Sati among royalty. Ritual death by sallekhana and by jalasamadhi (drowning in water) were also practiced. Popular clothing among men was the use of two unrestricted garments, a Dhoti as a lower garment and a plain cloth as upper garment while women wore Saris with stitched <b>petticoats.</b> Turbans were popular with men of higher standing and people used umbrellas made with bamboo or reeds. Ornaments were popular among men and women and even elephants and horses were decorated. Men wore finger rings, necklaces (honnasara and honnagala sara), bracelets (Kaduga) and wristlets (Kaftkina). Women wore a nose jewel (bottu), nose ring (mugutti), bangles (bale or kankana) and various types of necklaces (honna gante sara and kati sutra). During leisure, men amused themselves with horse riding, watching wrestling bouts, cock fights and ram fights. There existed a large and well organised network of schools for imparting higher education and these schools were known by various names such as agraharas, ghatikas, brahmapura or matha. Inscriptions mention schools of higher education at Salotgi, Balligavi, Talagunda, Aihole, Arasikere and other places.|$|E
5|$|The cage {{crinoline}} {{made out}} of spring steel wire was first introduced in the 1850s, with the earliest British patent for a metal crinoline (described as a 'skeleton petticoat of steel springs fastened to tape.') granted in July 1856. Alison Gernsheim suggests that the unidentified French inventor was probably R. C. Milliet of Besançon, as the July 1856 patent was filed by their British agent, C. Amet. Milliet had already patented a 'tournure de femme' in Paris on 24 April 1856 which was described as comprising 'elastic extensible circles joined together by vertical bands.' Following its introduction, the women's rights advocate Amelia Bloomer felt that her concerns about the hampering nature of multiple <b>petticoats</b> had been resolved, and dropped dress reform as an issue. Diana de Marly, in her biography of the couturier Charles Frederick Worth noted that by 1858 there existed steel factories catering solely to crinoline manufacturers, and shops that sold nothing else but crinolines. One {{of the most significant}} manufacturers of crinolines was that of Thomson & Co., founded by an American with branches across Europe and the United States. At the height of their success, up to four thousand crinolines were produced by Thomson's London factory in a day, whilst another plant in Saxony manufactured 9.5 million crinolines over a twelve-year period. In 1859 the New York factory, which employed about a thousand girls, used 300,000yards of steel wire every week to produce between three and four thousand crinolines per day, while the rival Douglas & Sherwood factory in Manhattan used a ton of steel each week in manufacturing hoop skirts.|$|E

25|$|Evening gowns had low necklines {{and short}} sleeves, and were worn with short gloves or lace or crocheted fingerless mitts. The voluminous skirts were {{supported}} by hoops, <b>petticoats,</b> and or crinolines. The use of hoops was not as common until 1856, prior supporting the skirts with layers if starched <b>petticoats.</b> Bouffant gowns with large crinolines were probably reserved for special occasions.|$|E

25|$|Panniers or side-hoops {{remained}} an essential of court fashion but disappeared everywhere else {{in favor of}} a few <b>petticoats.</b> Free-hanging pockets were tied around the waist and were accessed through pocket slits in the side-seams of the gown or petticoat. Woolen or quilted waistcoats were worn over the stays or corset and under the gown for warmth, as were <b>petticoats</b> quilted with wool batting, especially in the cold climates of Northern Europe and America.|$|E

25|$|Skirts {{might be}} open in front {{to reveal a}}n underskirt or <b>petticoat</b> until about 1630, or closed all around; closed skirts were {{sometimes}} carried or worn looped up to reveal a <b>petticoat.</b>|$|R
50|$|A <b>petticoat</b> or underskirt is {{an article}} of clothing; {{specifically}} an undergarment to be worn under a skirt or a dress. The <b>petticoat</b> is a separate garment hanging from the waist (unlike the chemise).|$|R
25|$|Later, {{the cage}} {{crinoline}} was developed. Women were {{freed from the}} heavy <b>petticoats,</b> {{and were able to}} move their legs freely beneath the cage.|$|E
25|$|Front-wrapping thigh-length shortgowns or bedgowns of {{lightweight}} printed {{cotton fabric}} were fashionable at-home morning wear, worn with <b>petticoats.</b> Over time, bedgowns became the staple upper garment of British and American female working-class street wear.|$|E
25|$|The final layer was the petticoat, {{which could}} have a scooped {{neckline}} and was sleeveless, and was fitted {{in the back with}} hooks and eyelets, buttons or tapes. These <b>petticoats</b> were often worn between the underwear and the outer dress and was considered part of the outer clothing not underwear. The lower edge of the petticoat was intended to be seen, since women would often lift their outer dresses to spare the relatively delicate material of the outer dress from mud or damp (so exposing only the coarser and cheaper fabric of the petticoat to risk). Often exposed to view, <b>petticoats</b> were decorated at the hem with rows of tucks or lace, or ruffles.|$|E
50|$|<b>Petticoat</b> Junction is an American {{situation}} comedy that originally aired on CBS from September 1963 to April 1970. The series {{takes place at}} the Shady Rest Hotel, which is run by Kate Bradley, her three daughters Billie Jo, Bobbie Jo, and Betty Jo, and her uncle Joe Carson. The series is one of three interrelated shows about rural characters produced by Paul Henning. <b>Petticoat</b> Junction was created upon the success of Henning's previous rural/urban-themed sitcom The Beverly Hillbillies (1962-1971). The success of <b>Petticoat</b> Junction led to a spin-off, Green Acres (1965-1971). <b>Petticoat</b> Junction was produced by Wayfilms (a joint venture of Filmways Television and Pen-Ten Productions).|$|R
5000|$|Often, {{there are}} {{specific}} themes for said <b>petticoating.</b> Often, <b>petticoating</b> {{revolves around the}} [...] "little girl" [...] aspect in which the submissive/child is forced {{to act like a}} little girl. Other scenarios include Infantilism and Sissy Maid.|$|R
50|$|<b>Petticoating</b> a {{child is}} illegal in many Islamic states. It is {{considered}} highly immoral to punish a child in this fashion, but still exists {{in many of the}} Commonwealth states in a small extent as a legal practice as long as the child is not being sexually abused. The thin line between <b>petticoating</b> and child sexual abuse has been a serious factor in <b>petticoating,</b> and has at least one occasion, led to a child sexual abuse charge.|$|R
25|$|Over {{the upper}} part of their bodies, both medieval men and women usually wore a {{close-fitting}} shirt-like garment called a chemise in France, or a smock or shift in England. The forerunner of the modern-day shirt, the chemise was tucked into a man's braies, under his outer clothing. Women wore a chemise underneath their gowns or robes, sometimes with <b>petticoats</b> over the chemise. Elaborately quilted <b>petticoats</b> might be displayed by a cut-away dress, in which case they served a skirt rather than an undergarment. During the 16th century, the farthingale was popular. This was a petticoat stiffened with reed or willow rods so that it stood out from a woman's body like a cone extending from the waist.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Petticoat</b> Junction {{proved an}} {{enormous}} hit {{in its first}} season, and remained a top-25 program for several years. In 1968 Benaderet was reunited with Alan Reed during Season 5 of <b>Petticoat</b> Junction, when Reed played a sinister hotel guest. Benaderet had done a radio variation of Green Acres with Gale Gordon beginning in 1950 called Granby's Green Acres. Green Acres was a spinoff of <b>Petticoat</b> Junction, with Eva Gabor portraying Benaderet's original part, and Benaderet appearing in several episodes as her <b>Petticoat</b> Junction character, {{in order to establish}} the Hooterville setting. (Eddie Albert took Gale Gordon's role as the lawyer who moves to the country to become a farmer as Gordon was then occupied with his role as [...] "Mr. Mooney" [...] on The Lucy Show.) ...|$|R
25|$|Women's {{undergarments}} {{were essentially}} unchanged {{from the previous}} period; a knee-length chemise was worn beneath a boned corset and masses of starched <b>petticoats.</b> The corset could be laced tightly to narrow the waist, {{but this was not}} the fashion necessity it became later in the century.|$|E
25|$|This era {{signaled}} {{the loss of}} any lingering neoclassical, pseudo-Grecian styles in women's dress. This decline was especially evident in France due to the Emperor Napoleon's suppression of trade in the fabrics used in neoclassical dress. While waistlines were still high, they were beginning to drop slightly. Larger and more abundant decoration, especially near the hem and neckline foreshadowed greater extravagance in the coming years. More <b>petticoats</b> were being worn, and a stiffer, more cone-shaped skirt became popular. Stiffness could be supplemented by layers of ruffles and tucks on a hem, as well as corded or flounced <b>petticoats.</b> Sleeves began to be pulled, tied, and pinched {{in ways that were}} more influenced by romantic and gothic styles than neoclassical. Hats and hairstyles became more elaborate and trimmed, climbing higher to balance widening skirts.|$|E
25|$|Front-wrapping thigh-length shortgowns or bedgowns of {{lightweight}} printed {{cotton fabric}} remained fashionable at-home morning wear, worn with <b>petticoats.</b> Over time, bedgowns became the staple upper garment of British and American female working-class street wear.Women would also sometimes wear a neckerchief {{or a more}} formal lace modesty piece, particularly on low-cut dresses.|$|E
50|$|In one version, a tartan pattern skirt is {{worn with}} an over-the-shoulder plaid, a white blouse and <b>petticoat,</b> and a velvet bodice. The {{alternative}} {{is a white}} dress over a <b>petticoat,</b> together with a tartan pattern sash. A typical Aboyne dress consists of a dark bodice or elaborate waistcoat, decorative blouse, full tartan skirt and some times a <b>petticoat</b> and apron. Some have a tartan sash (usually draped over the shoulder and coming down towards the hem of the skirt in the back) rather than an apron.|$|R
