The replacement of phosphate by arsenate is initiated when arsenate reacts with glucose and gluconate in vitro.

At the substrate level, during glycolysis, glucose-6-arsenate binds as a substrate to glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, and also inhibits hexokinase through negative feedback. Unlike the importance of phosphate in glycolysis, the presence of arsenate restricts the generation of ATP by forming an unstable anhydride product, through the reaction with D-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate.

MMA(V) was partly reduced to trivalent MMA(III) in rice roots, but only MMA(V) was translocated to shoots. DMA(V) was stable in plants. The rice lsi 1 mutant lost about 80 % and 50 % of the uptake capacity for MMA(V) and DMA(V), respectively, compared with the wild-type rice, whereas Lsi 2 mutation had little effect.

The uptake kinetics of DMA(V) were linear with the slope being 2. 8 -fold higher in the wild type than the lsi 1 mutant.

The kinetics of arsenic elimination in urine was multiphasic, being three-phase in case of intravenous and intratracheal administration and two-phase after gavage and skin resorption. After intravenous administration of As, the half-times of elimination were 2. 5, 10, and 690 hr, respectively.

Pulse-chase studies showed that the deletion of Glu 155 causes increased turnover of GSTO 1 - 1 in T 47 -D cells.

Therefore, a development of analytical methods for trace and ultratrace speciation analysis- analysis of individual forms or phases in which As {{is found in the}} sample - is fully in place. This Thesis compares four methods of trace speciation analysis, with focus on limits of detection and quantification, and on comparison of results of analysis of river and sea water reference materials. Methods based on hydride generation with preconcentration by cryotrapping and AAS or ICP-MS detection, with limits of detection in ng or tenths of ng·dm- 3, are compared with procedures employing HPLC, with ICP-MS detection. The Thesis includes development and optimization of a pre-reduction step of postcolumn hydride generation with on-line pre-reduction of <b>pentavalent</b> <b>arsenic</b> species, in order to improve sensitivity of this method. Limits of detection around 10 ng·dm- 3 are achieved. The results of analyses obtained by individual methods are in excellent agreement.

40|$|Nansi Lake is {{the largest}} and the most {{important}} freshwater lake in north China for the South-North Water Transfer Project. Due to long-time and large-scale fish farming of history, the excess fish food and excretion usually release <b>pentavalent</b> <b>arsenic,</b> which is converted into trivalent arsenic (As (III)) in the lake sediment and released into lake water. Adsorption of arsenite using six submerged plants (Mimulicalyx rosulatus, Potamogeton maackianus, Hydrilla, Watermifoil, Pteris vittata, and Potamogeton crispus) as adsorbing materials was investigated. The experimental data obtained have been analyzed using Langmuir, Freundlich, and Dubinin-Radushkevich isotherm models and the pseudo-first-order, pseudo-second-order, and intraparticle diffusion kinetics models. According to the results, the As (III) equilibrium data agreed well with the Freundlich isotherm model. The adsorption capacity of the plants was in the following order: Potamogeton crispus > Pteris vittata > Potamogeton maackianus > Mimulicalyx rosulatus > Hydrilla > Watermifoil. The sorption system with the six submerged plants was better described by pseudo-second-order than by first-order kinetics. Moreover, the adsorption with Potamogeton crispus could follow intraparticle diffusion (IPD) model. The initial adsorption and rate of IPD using Potamogeton crispus and Pteris vittata were higher than those using other plants studied...|$|E
40|$|Arsenic {{toxicity}} {{depends on}} the chemical form. Inorganic arsenic is more toxic than organic arsenic and trivalent arsenite is more toxic than <b>pentavalent</b> and zero-valent <b>arsenic.</b> Generally rice, unlike food products of terrestrial origin, contains significant amounts of inorganic arsenic. Recently some Government Organizations (e. g. EFSA) debated the possibility to set an upper limit for total and inorganic arsenic in rice. Arsenic speciation was realized in 70 Italian rice samples from different representative cultivation conditions. The adopted method was effective in preserving the arsenic species and suitable for routine analysis {{of large numbers of}} samples. Pulverized rice grains (approx. 1. 5 g) were mineralized using HNO 3 0, 28 M at 95 °C for 90 min in a heating block system. The digested samples were filtered under vacuum-assisted sample filtration in order to obtain a faster and more complete filtration, with lower sample preparation time and sample manipulation. The HPLC-ICP-MS technique was used to measure the different arsenic species [arsenite (As(III)), arsenate (As(V)), monomethylarsonic acid (MMA) and dimethylarsinic acid (DMA) ], which were separated using an anion-exchange column. It was possible to separate and analyze the four arsenic species in only 9 minutes. The sum of As(III) and As(V) is known as inorganic arsenic. Total As concentration in samples was determined directly by ICP–MS. Certified reference material, NIST 1568 a rice flour and IMEP 107, for total and inorganic As in rice, were included for quality assurance. Moreover, the sum of As(III), As(V), MMA, and DMA was compared with total arsenic and resulted similar. The most abundant species in rice were As(III) and DMA. Total arsenic levels in the 70 Italian rice samples averaged 0. 16 µg g- 1 (range 0. 06 - 0. 60 µg g- 1); inorganic arsenic averaged 0. 10 µg g- 1 (range 0. 04 - 0. 16 µg g- 1). The percentage of inorganic arsenic tended to decrease with increasing the total arsenic...|$|R
40|$|Metals and {{metalloids}} {{are transformed}} naturally {{in the environment}} with formation of volatile and non-volatile organic derivatives. This process has {{a major role in}} metals mobility and accumulation in biological systems. Thus, considerable amounts of metallic and organometallic species are also introduced into the environment, causing concern about their impact on humans health. In addition, arsenic species and organotin are also produced as a result of human intracellular metabolism. The aim of the study is to investigate the toxic potential that can lead to cell death of organometal(loid) s. Here, cyto- and genotoxic effects in relationship with cellular uptake; disturbed calcium homeostasis in relationship with cell death of arsenic compounds (inorganic arsenic: Asi(V), Asi(III) and their methylated metabolites: MMA(V), MMA(III), DMA(V), DMA(III) and TMAO(V)), organoantimony (TMSb(V)), and organotin compounds (MMT, DMT, TMT, TetraMT) were investigated in mammalian cells (CHO- 9, HeLa S 3, and Hep G 2 cells), in vitro. These compounds showed different levels of cytotoxic effects. Thus, the DNA damage induced by the mentioned compounds was low or recovered (DNA repair). The uptake was dose-dependent, but low membrane permeability was observed. For arsenic, the uptake was higher with lower doses and inhibited at higher doses. Hep G 2 cells had the highest cellular uptake as compared with CHO and HeLa cells. These compounds were not attached at cell plasma membranes. When cellular uptake was increased, a significant genetic damage was observed. In addition, because cytosolic calcium is a universal messenger mediating physiological and pathological cell functions, its modulation by the mentioned organometallic species were investigated. Trivalent arsenic species are the most active toxic forms inducing cytotoxicity and DNA damage. These arsenic forms were taken up by the cells faster compared to pentavalent species. <b>Pentavalent</b> organic <b>arsenic</b> forms did not show high toxic effects under normal experimental conditions but they exhibit genotoxic effects after forced uptake. Arsenic compounds perturbed calcium homeostasis but the effect was reversible. To compare, TMSb was more potent than its arsenic equivalent in cytotoxic abilities and induced DNA damage under forced uptake. Also, it was able to increase intracellular calcium and trigger cell death (apoptosis). In addition, the ability of organotin compounds to penetrate cell membranes modulates their genotoxicity but not the induced cytotoxic effects. They induced significant DNA damage and high cytotoxicity in forced uptake. Also, TMT (0. 25 µM to 500 µM) triggered cell signalling in HeLa cells. Calcium rise was reversible, repeatable, and dose-dependent in regards to the reactive cells and the increase in intracellular calcium. This elevation derived principally from internal stores because it did not depend on the extracellular calcium concentration and was extremely diminished after treatment of caffeine. An increase in the calcium concentration in the nuclear region of HeLa cells (after TMT addition) was also observed. Calcium signalling patterns occurred as spikes, and sustained plateau. Since {{it is not clear whether}} fast calcium changes contribute to the efficiency or specificity of signalling, or are a consequence of the feedback control of Ca 2 +, the relationship of Ca 2 + changes and cellular death (necrosis or apoptosis) was investigated. At low concentrations, TMT was able to induce significant apoptotic death. Additionally, all other organotin compounds were able to modulate calcium homeostasis and trigger apoptosis...|$|R
40|$|The {{distribution}} of radioactive arsenic among trivalent and <b>pentavalent</b> states of <b>arsenic</b> produced by nuclear transformations {{has been investigated}} in simple inorganic compounds of germanium, selenium, bromine and arsenic. In some cases we have studied the change of this distribution by annealing processes. The nuclear transformations we have studied are the following: Ge 77 -—β—> As 77 Se 76 (n,p) As 76 Br 81 (n,α) As 78 Br 79 (n,α) As 76 As 75 (n,γ) As 76 The compounds were irradiated with neutrons in the RAI reactor in Buenos Aires and later with neutrons obtained by bombarding beryllium with 26 MeV deuterons in the Philips synchrocyclotron of Amsterdam. The chemical separations used consisted of {{the dissolution of the}} irradiated compound in a solution containing AsIII and AsV carriers. The arsenate fractions were separated from the arsenite fractions by precipitation as magnesium ammonium arsenate. The arsenite was then oxidized to arsenate which in turn was precipitated as magnesium ammonium arsenate. All fractions were converted to magnesium piro-arsenate. The radioactive samples were counted with an end-window G. M. counter under conditions of standard geometry. Annealing was carried out in constant-temperature baths during specified periods of time. It is evident from our experimental results that chemical conditions in the aqueous medium, and specially the pH, have little or no influence on the {{distribution of}} the arsenic activity among the two oxidation states. This suggests that the final form in which the radioactive arsenic will be found is already determined inside the target lattice. It is even more striking that the distribution observed in GeO 2 is very nearly equal to that in SeO 2. This suggests that the structure of the oxide is the determining factor for the distribution of the arsenic activity among arsenite and arsenate fractions. It is very curious that the AsV: total As of radioactive arsenic in the oxides of germanium and selenium and in the oxides of arsenic may be represented as a linear function of the oxygen: parent element ratio for the irradiated compound. This is true for some other compounds as Na 2 Se 04 and Na 2 Ge 03. In the other compounds that we have investigated the linear relationship does not hold very well. In part this maybe the reflection of the differences in the lattice arrangement, but reducing and oxidizing tendencies of the irradiated compounds may also possibly play a role. The differences found between Na 2 Se 03 and H 2 Se 03 can be ascribed to bound hydrogen present inside the latter compound. The results in the bromine compounds indicate that the distribution of radioactive arsenic among the arsenite and arsenate fractions depends on the amount of oxygen contained in the irradiated compounds. Even in the bromides the percentage of radioarsenic is fairly directly correlated with the oxygen present as water in the crystal. Annealing turned out to be quite slow, even at temperatures appreciably higher than those required to increase the retention in most neutron irradiated solid salts. The first part of this thesis presents a survey of the field of Szilard-Chalmers and similar phenomena with emphasis on inorganic systems. It will not cite all the literature published until now, but will try to review some of the most significant recent work. Fil:Baró, Gregorio Bonifacio. Universidad de Buenos Aires.
