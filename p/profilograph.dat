50|$|Road {{pavement}} profilometers (aka <b>profilographs,</b> {{as used in}} {{the famous}} 1958-1960 AASHO Road Test) use a distance measuring laser (suspended approximately 30 cm from the pavement) in combination with an odometer and an inertial unit (normally an accelerometer to detect vehicle movement in the vertical plane) that establishes a moving reference plane to which the laser distances are integrated. The inertial compensation makes the profile data more or less independent of what speed the profilometer vehicle had during the measurements, {{with the assumption that}} the vehicle does not make large speed variations and the speed is kept above 25 km/h or 15 mph. The profilometer system collects data at normal highway speeds, sampling the surface elevations at intervals of 2-15 cm (1-6 in), and requires a high speed data acquisition system capable of obtaining measurements in the kilohertz range.|$|R
5000|$|Up to that time, the {{development}} of agricultural machinery had been done largely by amateurs. Eugène Tisserand, a director at the Ministry of Agriculture, wanted to apply a scientific approach to {{the development}} and evaluation of farm machinery. He therefore requested that Ringelmann draft plans for a facility for testing agricultural machinery, which after many vicissitudes opened in 1888. The facility was established on Jenner Street in Paris and Ringelmann was named its director. [...] He adapted industrial instruments where possible, but he also designed and had built instruments such as traction dynamometers, rotational dynamometers, <b>profilographs,</b> etc. He aimed to determine the efficiency of agricultural machinery, its economics, {{the quality of the}} work performed, etc. His wide-ranging interests soon led him to extend his research to include all branches of rural engineering: construction, drainage, irrigation, electrification, hydraulics.|$|R

The Scanner is not adaptable to IBM computers with the micro channel architecture. The Iowa DOT Transportation Centers could realize the following advantages by using ProScan: (1) Save about 5 to 8 staff hours of reduction and reporting time per Transportation Center per week for a Materials Technician 3 or 4 (the time savings would come during the busiest part of the season); (2) Reduce errors in reduction, transfer, and typing of profile values; (3) Increase {{the accuracy of the}} monitor results; and (4) Allow rapid evaluation of contractor traces when tolerance limits between monitor and certified results are exceeded...|$|R
40|$|Pavement profile or {{smoothness}} {{has been}} identified nationally as a good measure of highway user satisfaction. This has led highway engineers to measure profiles of both operating and new highways. Operational highway profiles are often measured with high-speed inertial profilers. New highway profiles are usually measured with <b>profilographs</b> {{in order to establish}} incentives or disincentives for pavement construction. In most cases, these two processes do not measure the same value from the “cradle to grave” life of pavements. In an attempt to correct the inconsistency between measuring techniques, lightweight profilers intended to produce values to be used for construction acceptance are being made that measure the same profile as high-speed inertial profilers. Currently, two profiler systems have been identified that can measure pavement profile during construction. This research has produced a field evaluation of the two systems. The profilers evaluated in this study are able to detect roughness in the final profile, including localized roughness and roughness at joints. Dowel basket ripple is a significant source of pavement surface roughness. The profilers evaluated in this study are able to detect dowel basket ripple with enough clarity to warn the paving crew. String-line disturbances degrade smoothness. The profilers evaluated in this study are able to detect some string-line disturbances during paving operations. The profilers evaluated in this study are not currently able to produce the same absolute International Roughness Index (IRI) values on the plastic concrete that can be measured by inertial profilers on the hardened concrete.

5000|$|Both {{new and old}} roads {{often have}} {{insufficient}} drainage gradient at the entrance and exit of sharp outercurves, causing water pooling in rain and forming local surprising ice spots in cold climate. A large study in Sweden (see the linked [...] "Analysis of single vehicle accidents with fatal outcome" [...] below) showed that fatal single crashes are 5 times more common in outercurves, than in innercurves. This extreme overrisk is considered strongly related to improper banking and insufficient drainage gradient at outercurves.Both Drainage gradient and curve banking can be monitored by measurement with a modern <b>Profilograph.</b> The linked EU Roadex III report below gives demonstrations as on how to analyze <b>Profilograph</b> data to identify excessive accident risk in outercurves.|$|E
50|$|Many road profilographs {{are also}} {{measuring}} the pavements cross slope, curvature, longitudinal gradient and rutting. Some profilographs take digital photos or videos while profiling the road. Most profilographs also record the position, using GPS technology. Yet another common measurement option is cracks. Some <b>profilograph</b> systems include a ground penetrating radar, used to record asphalt layer thickness.|$|E
50|$|The data {{collected}} by a <b>profilograph</b> {{is used to calculate}} the International Roughness Index (IRI), which is expressed in units of inches/mile or mm/m. IRI values range from 0 (equivalent to driving on a plate of glass) upwards to several hundred in/mile (a very rough road). The IRI value is used for road management to monitor road safety and quality issues.|$|E
50|$|Lateral {{friction}} and cross slope {{are the key}} reaction forces acting to keep a cornering vehicle in steady lateral position, while it is subject to exiting forces arising from speed and curvature.

50|$|The <b>profilograph</b> is {{a device}} {{used to measure}} {{pavement}} surface roughness. In the early 20th century, profilographs were low speed rolling devices. Today many profilographs are advanced high speed systems with a laser based height sensor in combination with an inertial system that creates a large scale reference plane. It is used by construction crews or certified consultants to measure the roughness of in-service road networks, as well as before and after milling off ridges and paving overlays. Modern profilographs are fully computerized instruments.|$|E

50|$|Another type of <b>profilograph</b> {{system is}} for {{measuring}} the surface texture of a road and how {{it relates to the}} coefficient of friction and thus to skid resistance. Pavement texture is divided into three categories; megatexture, macrotexture, and microtexture. Microtexture cannot currently be measured directly, except in a laboratory. Megatexture is measured using a similar profiling method as when obtaining IRI values, while macrotexture is the measurement of the individual variations of the road within a small interval of a few centimeters. For example, a road which has gravel spread on top followed by an asphalt seal coat will have a high macrotexture, and a road built with concrete slabs will have low macrotexture. For this reason, concrete is often grooved or roughed up immediately after it is laid on the road bed to increase the friction between the tire and road.|$|E
5000|$|The {{road test}} used large road user panels to {{establish}} the [...] "Present Serviceability Rating" [...] (PSR) for each test section, as the test proceeded. Since panel ratings are expensive, a substitute key parameter [...] "Present Serviceability Index" [...] (PSI) was established. The PSI is based on data on the roads longitudinal roughness, patch work, rutting and cracking. Later {{studies have shown that}} PSI is mainly a fruit of unevenness, with a correlation of more than 90% between the two. Unevenness was measured with a mechanical <b>profilograph,</b> reporting a parameter called slope variance (SV). SV is the second spatial derivative of height. For a vehicle traveling at speed, SV is the exciting source to vertical acceleration; the second derivative in time domain of height. This makes very good sense, since 1 - 80 Hz acceleration is the parameter used when relating human exposure from vibration to perceived discomfort in the current ISO 2631-1 (1997) standard. Thus, SV is physically linked to ride quality.|$|E
40|$|Currently, Indiana Department of Transportation (INDOT) {{is using}} the California <b>Profilograph</b> as the {{standard}} measuring device in its smoothness specifications. The output derived from the <b>profilograph</b> is called Profile Index (PI). PI represents the total accumulated deviations of the <b>profilograph</b> output traces beyond a tolerance zone (blanking band). At present, INDOT is using 0. 2 -inch blanking band to evaluate the profile traces, which has raised some concerns because some small unpleasant surface irregularities are covered by the blanking band. The major objective {{of this study was}} to develop a rational method for interpreting <b>profilograph</b> traces using 0. 0 -inch blanking band (zero tolerance) method and to establish corresponding pavement smoothness specifications. The secondary objective was to develop/adopt an automated system for the pavement profile analysis from printed <b>profilograph</b> traces. The study was divided into two parts. In the first part (synthesis study), a literature review was conducted to obtain information of smoothness specifications, smoothness measuring devices, and indices. <b>Profilograph</b> traces from several completed paving projects were analyzed using 0. 2 -inch and 0. 0 -inch blanking bands to develop manual reduction procedure for the 0. 0 -inch blanking band Profile Index. In the second part of the project, new PI 0. 0 construction smoothness specifications were developed by converting current PI 0. 2 smoothness specifications to the new PI 0. 0 specifications using developed conversion models. The converted PI 0. 0 specifications were then compared with the current Kansas DOT (KDOT) and other PI 0. 0 specifications. A partial verification of the converted PI 0. 0 specification was done by calculating pay factors for several recently completed paving projects measured using California <b>profilograph.</b> Measurement results were reduced manually and automatically by the Proscan system, which includes scanner and analysis program to reduce printed traces. It has been developed by Kansas State University and currently KDOT is using it in their construction QA procedures. The Proscan system showed excellent repeatability, and it saved considerable amount of time compared to the manual trace reduction. It is therefore recommended that INDOT uses Proscan system in their constitution QA operations. The converted PI 0. 0 specifications were also modified to comply with the Proscan reduction results...|$|E

The same technology used in the high-speed profilers is now being used in lightweight profilers for construction smoothness testing. The lightweight profilers have many advantages over the California 25 -ft <b>profilograph.</b> Despite the many advantages of the lightweight profilers, there is resistance from the contracting industry toward eliminating the 25 -ft <b>profilograph</b> for construction ride testing. One way to reduce or overcome the resistance is to evaluate and demonstrate the advantages/disadvantages of the lightweight profiler in actual field use in Iowa. The objective {{of the study was}} to purchase a lightweight profiler and to evaluate its suitability for construction smoothness quality verification and quality acceptance on Iowa projects. A lightweight profiler, an Ames Engineering, Inc. LISA single laser unit, was received in February 2003 for the study. Based on the work done during the 2003 construction season, the following conclusions can be made: (1) For hot mix asphalt surfaces, the LISA correlated well with the contractors' profilographs; (2) LISA results are significantly affected by longitudinal tining on portland cement concrete pavements, requiring a laser system upgrade to give accurate results; (3) A significant timesaving was realized by using the LISA; (4) Increasing visibility and reducing time in the construction zone improved safety; (5) One person with limited lifting capabilities could set up and operate the LISA; and (6) With the current Iowa Department of Transportation specification, the LISA cannot totally replace the <b>profilograph,</b> since bridges and short segments with no adjoining pavement would still require a <b>profilograph...</b>|$|E

40|$|A {{key factor}} in the {{long-term}} performance of both asphalt and portland cement concrete pavements is initial pavement smoothness. In general, the smoother a pavement is built, the smoother it stays over time, resulting in lower maintenance costs and more comfort and safety for the traveling public. State highway agencies recognized in the 1960 s the importance of controlling initial pavement smoothness, and began developing and implementing smoothness specifications. As the technology and equipment for measuring pavement smoothness advanced, two predominant methods emerged. The <b>profilograph</b> is widely used to measure and control initial smoothness by producing profile traces, which can be evaluated to identify severe bumps and to establish an easily understood, overall measure of smoothness, the profile index (PI). However, concerns about {{the accuracy of the}} <b>profilograph</b> have grown significantly in the last decade. The more recently developed inertial profiler is used to quickly and accurately monitor in-service pavements, and produces a more definitive profile of a pavement from which the widely accepted International Roughness Index (IRI) can be computed. Use of inertial profilers has remained limited in initial construction acceptance testing due to their higher cost and constraints on timeliness of testing. Thus, in many agencies, initial pavement smoothness has been measured one way (<b>profilograph</b> PI) and smoothness over time has been measured another way (inertia...|$|E
