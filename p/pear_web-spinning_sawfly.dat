50|$|Pamphiliidae (sometimes {{incorrectly}} spelled Pamphilidae) {{is a small}} wasp family within Symphyta, containing some 200 {{species from}} the temperate regions of North America and Eurasia. The larvae feed on plants (often conifers), using silk to either build webs or tents, or to roll leaves into tubes, in which they feed, thus earning them the common names leaf-rolling <b>sawflies</b> or <b>web-spinning</b> <b>sawflies.</b> They are distinguished from the closely related Megalodontesidae by their simple, filiform antennae.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} carbon and oxygen stable {{isotopes}} {{in conjunction with}} tree-ring chronologies to investigate the short-and long-term effects of the spruce <b>web-spinning</b> <b>sawfly</b> Cephalcia arvensis Panzer defoliation on Picea abies. We found massive growth loss and significantly different carbon and oxygen stable isotope patterns associated with insect feeding; while carbon isotope values increased, oxygen isotope values decreased in the defoliated trees. We also observed a difference in isotope composition between defoliated and control trees prior to the defoliation, indicating that some abiotic factors may have predisposed the trees to the insect attack. With respect to isotope theory, carbon and oxygen isotope patterns {{could be explained by}} both an increase in photosynthetic rate and a resort to starch reserves following insect feeding. Overall, these findings contribute to our understanding of how trees respond to insect attack. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|The recent {{outbreaks}} (1986 - 1992) of the spruce <b>web-spinning</b> <b>sawfly</b> Cephalcia arvensis Panzer (Hymenoptera, Pamphiliidae) {{extended over}} 1500 ha of spruce (Picea abies Karst.) stands in two {{areas of the}} Venetian Pre-Alps (north-east Italy). Among the possible causes of these outbreaks, the climatic and pedological factors seem to predominate: (1) the period 1983 - 1986 showed a hot and dry climate in both areas, especially during the developmental time of the pest (June-July); (2) severe water stress occurred in the same years preceding the outbreaks; (3) inside each area the insect attack was irregularly distributed, reflecting the variability in soil and stand features. The relationships between climate and attack levels could be interpreted in two complementary ways: (1) lower mortality and faster development of the insect induced by favourable climatic conditions (high temperatures and lack of precipitations); (2) increase of food quality {{as a consequence of}} the water stress suffered by the trees, according to the soil and stand characteristics...|$|R
40|$|The {{life history}} of the spruce <b>web-spinning</b> <b>sawfly</b> Cephalcia arvensis has been studied from 1987 to 1991 in two {{outbreak}} areas of the Venetian Prealps. The populations of the pest are composed of individuals characterized by a different length of the life cycle, annual and biennial, the latter including {{in a few cases}} also triennial individuals. The two parts of the population differ as the emergence period, the distribution of the larvae (nymphs) in the soil, the fecundity and the weight of the mature larvae are considered. Longterm diapausing individuals seem to be heavier and more fertile than annual individuals; they are more deeply distributed in the soil and later in the emergence. These and other characteristics (adult behaviour, oviposition and egg features, larval feeding) are described and compared with those known in literature for other populations of the pest, with particular reference to the ''forms'' of C. arvensis recently described from Czechoslovakia...|$|R
40|$|The spruce <b>web-spinning</b> <b>sawflies</b> of {{the genus}} Cephalcia have been {{surveyed}} on two host plants (Picea Koraiensis and P. jezoensis) in both natural and artificial stands of north-eastern China. Ornamental trees were {{also included in the}} study. Five sites situated in the Provinces of Heilongjiang and Jilin and characterized by various elevations were considered in 1992 - 93. A total of nine species have been found, in the following decreasing order of abundance: C. abietis, C. arvensis (with two froms), C. fallenii, C. pallidula (new to China), C. alashanica, C. erythrogaster, C. fulva, C. klugii, and an unknown species. In most cases the adult specimens from China show a darker and more extended pigmentation with respect to the European ones. Some biological attributes (emergence period of adults, oviposition features, larval instars and feeding habits) are given for each species and compared with those known from European populations. A key for the practical identification of prepupae is presented. All information could be useful in monitoring, since these sawflies are considered among the main pests of various spruce species in this region...|$|R
40|$|Field {{tests were}} {{conducted}} in the Asiago Forest, Venetian Prealps (Italy) to evaluate the efficacy of nematode strains (Heterorhabditis sp. HL 81, Steinernema carpocapsae IS 230, S. feltiae (= bibionis) IS 389, S. kraussei SK) against the spruce <b>web-spinning</b> <b>sawfly</b> Cephalcia arvensis. Soil applications of 100 juveniles cm- 2 of S. feltiae and S. kraussei resulted in 56 % and 36. 4 % reduction of emergences of sawfly, respectively, when performed before the mature larvae drop and enter the soil. The effectiveness of S. feltiae becomes 32. 3 % if the nematodes are applied when the larvae have already prepared their chambers. S. feltiae parasitized more females and long-term diapausing individuals than S. kraussei. The two most effective strains (IS 389 and SK) seem to be well adapted to low temperature, {{which is likely to}} be the most important limiting factor for nematode activity in the mountain spruce forests. An ichneumonid parasitoid (Xenoschesis fulvipes) was strongly affected by S. feltiae, resulting in 66. 6 % reduction of emergences. Another ichneumonid, Ctenopelma lucifer, seems to be less affected than X. fulvipes by the nematode application...|$|R
40|$|The spruce <b>web-spinning</b> <b>sawfly</b> Cephalacia fallenii is {{considered}} to be a minor pest defoliating spruces (Picea spp.) in Europe and northern Asia, and is characterized by a high degree of morphological polymorphism throughout its wide range. A sudden increase in population density observed in Central and southern Europe since 1976, strictly related to the dieback of large areas of spruce forests, made it possible to compare a large number of insects from different sites. The study was performed by combining field observations on epidemics and biological traits with analyses of allozymic, karyological and morphological characters. Two sibling species occurring together in all the study sites were identified by a diagnostic allozyme at the glucose phosphate isomerase (GPI) locus, karyotype differences, emergence times and the colour pattern of adults (light and dark). As the light form matches well with the lectotype of Lyda annulicornis, here designated, this species is redescribed on the basis of a large number of specimens. A new synonymy for the remaining taxa is proposed. Karyotype differences between the two siblings are substantial (C. fallenii, n = 18, 17 M + 1 A; C. annulicornis, n = 26, 13 M + 13 A), suggesting that chromosome rearrangements played a role in the speciation process...|$|R
40|$|Forests {{and climate}} change- lessons from insects Battisti A* Abstract: The climate change may {{indirectly}} affects the forest ecosystems {{through the activity}} of phytophagous insects. The climate change has been claimed to be responsible of the range expansion northward and upward of several insect species of northern temperate forests, {{as well as of}} changes in the seasonal phenology. Several papers have dealt with the prediction of the most likely consequences of the climate change on the phytophagous insects, including {{some of the most important}} forest pests. Increased levels of CO 2 in the atmosphere involve an increase of the C/N balance of the plant tissues, which in turn results in a lower food quality for many defoliating insects. Some insects respond by increasing the level of leaf consumption and consequently the damage to the tree, whereas others show higher mortality and lower performance. The level of plant chemical defences may also be affected by a change of CO 2. The temperature is affecting either the survival of the insects which are active during the cold period, such as the pine processionary moth, or the synchronization mechanism between the host and the herbivores, as in the case of the larch bud moth. An increase of temperature may alter the mechanism by which the insects adjust their cycles to the local climate (diapause), resulting in faster development and higher feeding rate, as in the case of the spruce <b>web-spinning</b> <b>sawfly</b> outbreaks in the Southern Alps...|$|R

40|$|Field {{trials were}} {{conducted}} in Rheola Forest, Wales, Great Britain, to determine the effectiveness of Steinernema feltiae UK strain in controlling the <b>web-spinning</b> larch <b>sawfly</b> Cephalcia lariciphila. Foliar sprays {{at the rate of}} 5, 000 - 20, 000 nematodes/ 100 cm branch resulted in 3. 4 - 29. 4 % infection of sawfly larvae. Soil application of 200 nematodes/cm² resulted in 61 % infection of sawfly prepupae and 17. 3 % of pupae. Prepupal infection ranged from 4. 8 to 14. 7 % 1 year after nematode application.

40|$|The <b>web-spinning</b> <b>sawflies</b> of {{the genus}} Cephalcia Panzer (Hymenoptera, Pamphiliidae) are usually {{monitored}} by sampling prepupae in soil and by catching adults with visual traps, including yellow sticky traps. However, adult catches have never been compared with the actual density of prepupae. In this paper, a relationship is presented between the catches of Cephalcia arvensis Panzer adults (mostly males) {{and the number of}} prepupae ready to emerge (pronymphs) in ail outbreak area of spruce forest (Picea abies Karsten) in the Southern Alps (Asiago, Italy). A significant linear relationship between the logarithmic estimates of the two variables was found. The model includes a spatial autoregressive parameter because adult catches were spatially correlated. The relationship allows to know whether or not the defoliation threshold of 20 pronymphs/m(2) in spring samples is being exceeded, {{based on the number of}} adults caught on yellow sticky traps (defoliation threshold of 14. 26 adults/trap). The variance not explained by the model is probably due to the flight behaviour of adult males, to the low precision of the estimated pronymph density at low population levels, and to the attraction of males by few females that are trapped and remain alive. The model was validated in a large monitoring programme of undamaged alpine spruce forests and allowed detection of two newly infested stands out of six that were considered at risk of defoliation, because of adult catch exceeded the threshold. Low adult catches were always associated with absence of defoliation. Our conclusion is that trapping of adult sawflies is a cheaper and easier monitoring method than prepupae sampling in the soil. This makes earlier detection of outbreaks possible, and consequently more efficient control...|$|R
40|$|Defoliation of some Norway spruce stands, {{caused by}} Cephalcia abietis, was first {{reported}} in Romania {{in the autumn}} of 2015. The outbreak has affected 58 ha in the Eastern Carpathians and 190 ha in the Southern Carpathians. The species was previously known only as a faunistic element in the country and very little information on its biology, ecology, detection, forecast and population control is available in the Romanian literature. This paper is a synthesis of information concerning the <b>web-spinning</b> spruce <b>sawfly,</b> whose aim is to fill the knowledge gap. C. abietis is a species with a vast distribution area, but repeated outbreaks were reported especially from Central Europe. In the outbreak areas, the most insects of a generation need 2 - 3 years to complete their development, so that an intense flight and a stronger defoliation take place every 2 - 3 years. Although mortality factors affecting the populations of C. abietis are very numerous, they fail to keep defoliator populations under control and outbreaks may extend for a long time. Mass multiplication occurs mainly in pure Norway spruce stands older than 60 years, at medium altitudes (600 - 1000 m), in places exposed to periodic drought or pollution. Biological and ecological peculiarities of this species make the prognosis of defoliation much more labor intensive than that for other defoliators, although quite uncertain. The chemical control, with partially selective insecticides (chitin synthesis inhibitors), was usual during recent decades, while biological control is still in the experimental phase. Consequently, greater emphasis should be placed on preventing mass multiplication of this specie...|$|R
