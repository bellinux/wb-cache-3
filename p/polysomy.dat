40|$|<b>Polysomies</b> of {{chromosomes}} 7 and 12 {{have been}} frequently observed by conventional cytogenetics in a subgroup of thyroid follicular adenomas {{and in some}} cases of thyroid goiters. To further study possible cytogenetic similarities between these two types of thyroid lesions, we have used fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to detect <b>polysomies</b> of chromosomes 7 and/or 12 in isolated nuclei from frozen and paraffin-embedded material of goiters and thyroid follicular adenomas and compared results with previous ones obtained by flow cytometry and conventional cytogenetics. With a set of two alpha-satellite DNA probes specific for the centromeric regions of chromosomes 7 and 12, used either separately (single-target fluorescence in situ hybridization) or simultaneously (double-target fluorescence in situ hybridization), we detected <b>polysomies</b> of chromosome 7 in 35. 7 % of the thyroid follicular adenomas and in 10. 7 % of the goiters. <b>Polysomies</b> of chromosome 12 were detected in 29. 6 % of the thyroid follicular adenomas and 6. 7 % of the goiters. The significantly higher frequency of adenomas with numerical alterations for chromosomes 7 and/or 12 supports the idea of a biological continuum and karyotypic evolution between both lesions.

40|$|Morphological, cytogenetic, and {{biological}} evidence supports {{a relationship between}} congenital (infantile) fibrosarcoma (CFS) and congenital mesoblastic nephroma (CMN). These tumors have a very similar histological appearance, and they are both associated with <b>polysomies</b> for chromosomes 8, 11, 17, and 20. Recently, CFS was shown to contain a novel t(12; 15) (p 13;q 25) translocation resulting in ETV 6 -NTRK 3 gene fusion. The aims {{of this study were}} to determine whether congenital mesoblastic nephroma contains the t(12; 15) (p 13;q 25) translocation and ETV 6 -NTRK 3 gene fusion and whether ETV 6 -NTRK 3 fusions, in CMN and CFS, antedate acquisition of nonrandom chromosome <b>polysomies.</b> To address these aims, we evaluated 1) ETV 6 -NTRK 3 fusion transcripts by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and sequence analysis, 2) genomic ETV 6 -region chromosomal rearrangement by fluorescence in situ hybridization, and 3) chromosomal <b>polysomies</b> by karyotyping and fluorescence in situ hybridization. We report ETV 6 -NTRK 3 fusion transcripts and/or ETV 6 -region rearrangement in five of six CMNs and in five of five CFSs. The ETV 6 -NTRK 3 fusion transcripts and/or ETV-region chromosome rearrangements were demonstrated in two CMNs and one CFS that lacked chromosome <b>polysomies.</b> These findings demonstrate that t(12; 15) translocation, and the associated ETV 6 -NTRK 3 fusion, can antedate acquisition of chromosome <b>polysomies</b> in CMN and CFS.

The {{aim of this study}} was to analyze and compare the chromosome composition in low-grade and high-grade endometrial stromal sarcoma using the technique of chromosome in situ hybridization. Eight cases of low-grade stromal sarcoma and three cases of high-grade stromal sarcoma were studied. Biotinylated DNA probes specific for the regions of chromosomes X, 11, 12, and 17 were used on formalin-fixed paraffin embedded material from these tumors. The in situ hybridization signals were visualized by immunoperoxidase technique. Four of the eight low-grade stromal sarcomas retained normal disomy of the chromosomes studied. The other four low-grade sarcomas showed a gain of from one to three chromosomes, whereas all of the three high-grade sarcomas showed <b>polysomies</b> in all of the four chromosomes being studied. No loss of chromosomes was detected. One case of high-grade sarcoma contained coexisting areas of low-grade sarcoma. Although aneusomy was found in the high-grade portion, disomy was noted in the low-grade areas. In the stromal sarcomas studied, there was no definite correlation between the presence of chromosome <b>polysomies</b> and the clinical progress of the tumors.

40|$|Cervical intraepithelial {{neoplasia}} (CIN I, II, and III) {{and cases}} of CIN III associated with micro-invasive cervical carcinoma (CIN III & mCA) were analysed {{for evidence of}} episomal or integrated human papillomavirus (HPV) 16 / 18 DNA by {{fluorescence in situ hybridization}} (FISH). In parallel, numerical aberrations of chromosomes 1, 17, and X were determined in these lesions as indicators of genomic instability. HPV 16 / 18 DNA was present in 2 of 12 CIN I, 19 of 23 CIN II/III, and 10 of 12 CIN III & mCA. None of the CIN I and only two of the 19 HPV 16 / 18 -positive solitary CIN II/III showed an integrated HPV pattern. However, all ten cases of HPV-positive CIN III & mCA showed this pattern. Transition of CIN II/III to CIN III & mCA therefore correlates strongly with viral integration (P < 0. 001). Chromosomal aberrations were detected in 23 of 31 HPV 16 / 18 -positive lesions (14 solitary CIN I-III and nine CIN III & mCA) and 5 of 16 HPV-negative lesions. Nine of 21 HPV 16 / 18 -positive solitary CIN I-III showed tetrasomy for all chromosomes tested, while trisomies for a single chromosome were seen in a further five of these HPV-positive lesions. In eight of ten HPV-positive CIN III & mCA, predominantly aneusomies and/or <b>polysomies</b> were detected. A significant correlation (p < 0. 02) was found between the chromosome copy number and the physical status of HPV, indicating that in its episomal form HPV induces genomic changes such as tetrasomies and single trisomies, while HPV integration correlates with aneusomies and <b>polysomies,</b> predominantly detected in CIN III & mCA. These data indicate that integration of HPV 16 / 18 DNA is a pivotal step in the transition of CIN to micro-invasive carcinoma. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons, Ltd...|$|R

The {{aim of this study}} was to analyse whether homologous chromosomal changes exist despite the individual differences that may be of general relevance for the development of gross aneuploidy in squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with 13 centromere‐specific DNA probes was applied to 3 diploid and 11 aneuploid tumours with DNA indices ranging between 0. 8 and 2. 2. Disomic and monosomic cell populations were prevalent findings in DNA‐diploid tumours. <b>Polysomies</b> were common in aneuploid tumours. Different degrees of aneusomy for identical chromosomes were recurrent features in aneuploid tumours. FISH signal heterogeneity was identified for all chromosomes. The mean number of aneusomic cell populations identified for DNA‐aneuploid tumours ranged between 1. 6 for chromosome 17 and 3. 1 for chromosome 3. Inconsistencies between FISH and FCM data may indicate that centromere‐specific DNA probes identify gains and losses of marker DNA due to complex karyotypic rearrangements rather than absolute changes in chromosome numbers. Overall, there was no evidence of the critical involvement of particular chromosomes in the development of different DNA contents...|$|R
40|$|Most {{attempts}} to elucidate primary cytogenetic events {{have been made}} on the basis of chromosome analysis of cells from the later stages of tumor development. Hence it is difficult to decide which, if any, of the observed chromosomal altera-tions are causative rather than consequential hi neoplastic development. One approach to understand the role of chromosomal changes in neoplasia is to examine the chromosomal constitution of cells at early stages in the process of carcinogenesis. We have developed a method for direct preparation of metaphase plates of cells from preneoplastic liver nodules and we present herein the first report of non-random chromosome changes in solid tumor precursor cells. The results of the cytogenetic analysis demonstrated trisomks/polysomies for chromosome 11 and chromosome 19. A specific increase in the number of chromosome 19 was found in 43 % of the 37 plates karyotyped and 25 % of the plates demonstrated increase in the number of chromosome 11. The finding shows that gross chromosomal changes such as <b>polysomies</b> may play an important role in the early development of tumors.

40|$|To {{gain insight}} into the real {{incidence}} of the numeric chromosomal aberrations and the cell lineage involvement of the neoplastic process in multiple myeloma (MM), we examined 18 Chinese MM patients by May-Grunwald-Giemsa (MGG) staining and {{fluorescence in situ hybridization}} using three DNA centromeric probes specific for chromosomes 3, 7, and 9. In this investigation, cytogenetic abnormalities were detected in plasma cells (PCs), myeloid cells (MCs), and lymphoid cells (LCs) in all of the MM patients studied. This is the first demonstration of the cytogenetic aberration involved in the myeloid series. Furthermore, the MCs and PCs of 16 MM patients had the same aneuploidies in {{one or more of the}} chromosomes analyzed. These data suggest that the neoplastic transformation of MM may occur early in the hematopoietic development. Chromosomal aberrations involving mainly subclones and considerable cellular heterogeneity with gain of a variety of copy numbers of the same chromosome were demonstrated within PCs, which may possibly be the result of an underlying defect of PCs in the control of their number of chromosomes. Whereas PCs showed evidence suggestive of increased polyploidization, MCs and LCs, which exhibited similar chromosomal patterns as the former, rarely did. Thus, the clonal evolution from LC to PC, if that happens in MM, is characterized by chromosomal instability favoring growth of tumor cells with <b>polysomies</b> and polyploidies...|$|R

Although karyotypic changes {{are known to be}} associated with thyroid lesions, the chromosome patterns of only a few cell lines have been published. Herein, we report an extensive conventional and molecular cytogenetic investigation of the human papillary thyroid carcinoma derived cell line B-CPAP. Morphological studies and expression of tumor markers in this cell line have been reported previously, but no detailed characterization on the origin of the chromosome markers is available. B-CPAP cells have a rather stable hypertriploid karyotype, with chromosome <b>polysomies</b> and structural chromosome abnormalities featuring whole chromosome arm imbalances. Chromosome banding revealed a main clone with nine chromosome markers, and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with whole chromosome paint (wcp), partial chromosome paint (pcp), and centromeric probes clarified their origin. The use of centromeric probes provided accurate refinement of the rearrangements classified as whole-arm translocations by banding and FISH with wcp probes. Both chromosomal and array-based comparative genomic hybridization experiments confirmed the cytogenetic characterization of this cell line. Moreover, the use of fluorescence immunophenotyping and interphase cytogenetics as a tool for the investigation of neoplasms (FICTION) technique, which simultaneously shows nuclear ploidy and cytoplasmic immunofluorescence, detailed the oncocytic feature of the cells. Intriguingly, despite their origin, they lack most of the features expressed in papillary thyroid tumor cells and have a chromosomal pattern reminiscent of that of a subgroup of oncocytic malignant thyroid tumors...|$|R

The {{present study}} aimed to {{evaluate}} the diag-nostic value of chromosomal analysis by {{fluorescence in situ hybridization}} (FISH) for bladder cancer in light of the histo-logical diagnosis. Several valuable observations using FISH technologies in voided urine cells were also reported. The multi-target FISH-containing probes for the centromeres of chromosomes 3, 7 and 17 and the 9 p 21 locus were applied to cytospin specimens prepared from voided urine. Urine samples from 53 bladder cancer patients and 30 patients with benign alterations were used for this study. The histological observations of surgical resection specimens showed that the specificity and sensitivity for the technique were 100. 0 and 88. 0 %, respectively. Statistical analyses showed that there was no significant correlation between FISH‑positive rate and the tumor stage/grade (P< 0. 05). However, the proportion of tumor cells with genetic abnormalities positively correlated with the tumor stage (P< 0. 01). Furthermore, the number of abnormal cells in muscle‑invasive pT 2 was significantly higher than that in non-muscle-invasive pTa, pT 1 (P< 0. 01). Of 50 patients with bladder cancer, <b>polysomies</b> of chromosomes 3, 7 and 17 were detected in 84. 0, 48. 0 and 78. 0 % of cases, respectively, and loss of the 9 p 21 gene was detected in 80. 0 % of cases.

40|$|It is now common {{knowledge}} that two types of genetic instability, microsatellite instabilty (13 % of cancers) and chromosome instability (87 % of cancers), substantially contribute to the sequential accumulation of genetic alterations leading to cancer. Aneuploidy, a mirror of chromosome instability, characterizes a subgroup of follicular thyroid lesions, often associated with oncocytic features, which show simple trisomy 7 or trisomy 7 accompained by additional <b>polysomies,</b> accumulating according to an evolutionary scheme which parallels the progression from hyperplasia to carcinoma. In order to: a) verify the possibility of recognizing numerical chromosome changes in thyroid cells prior to surgical resection, b) establish the frequency of nodules with numerical chromsome changes prior to surgery selection and c) to confirm the association between aneuploidy and mithocondria accumulation, cells from the thyroid nodules of 108 patients undergoing echo-guided FNAB were investigated, using Fluorescence in Situ Hybridization (FISH) with centromeric probes specific for chromosomes 7 and 17, and immunofluorescence and FISH (FICTION), using anti-mitochondrion antibody. Numerical chromosome changes for chromosome 7 and/or 17 were found in cells from 8 nodules (4 with oncocytic features), and chromosome 7 and 17 heterozygous centromeric fusion was observed in 1 nodule. All cytological specimens were classified as suspicious. Six of them were subsequently surgically removed (4 carcinomas, 2 adenomas) and chromosome changes were confirmed in nuclei from fresh (touch preparations) or fixed (paraffin embedded) surgical material of 5 cases. CONCLUSIONS. Our data demonstrate the possibilty of performing FISH and FICTION experiments on cells from FNAB material, indicate that 7. 4 % of nodules subjected to echo-guided FNAB were associated with numerical chromosome changes, and, finally, confirmed that trisomy 7 alone or accompained by other chromosomes gains is present in oncocytic cells.

40|$|Aneuploidy {{is usually}} {{deleterious}} in multicellular organisms but {{appears to be}} tolerated and potentially beneficial in unicellular organisms, including pathogens. Leishmania, a major protozoan parasite, is emerging as a new model for aneuploidy, since in vitro-cultivated strains are highly aneuploid, with interstrain diversity and intrastrain mosaicism. The alternation of two life stages in different environments (extracellular promastigotes and intracellular amastigotes) offers {{a unique opportunity to}} study the impact of environment on aneuploidy and gene expression. We sequenced the whole genomes and transcriptomes of Leishmania donovani strains throughout their adaptation to in vivo conditions mimicking natural vertebrate and invertebrate host environments. The nucleotide sequences were almost unchanged within a strain, in contrast to highly variable aneuploidy. Although high in promastigotes in vitro, aneuploidy dropped significantly in hamster amastigotes, in a progressive and strain-specific manner, accompanied by the emergence of new <b>polysomies.</b> After a passage through a sand fly, smaller yet consistent karyotype changes were detected. Changes in chromosome copy numbers were correlated with the corresponding transcript levels, but additional aneuploidy-independent regulation of gene expression was observed. This affected stage-specific gene expression, downregulation of the entire chromosome 31, and upregulation of gene arrays on chromosomes 5 and 8. Aneuploidy changes in Leishmania are probably adaptive and exploited to modulate the dosage and expression of specific genes; they are well tolerated, but additional mechanisms may exist to regulate the transcript levels of other genes located on aneuploid chromosomes. Our model should allow studies of the impact of aneuploidy on molecular adaptations and cellular fitness. IMPORTANCE Aneuploidy is usually detrimental in multicellular organisms, but in several microorganisms, it can be tolerated and even beneficial. Leishmania-a protozoan parasite that kills more than 30, 000 people each year-is emerging as a new model for aneuploidy studies, as unexpectedly high levels of aneuploidy are found in clinical isolates. Leishmania lacks classical regulation of transcription at initiation through promoters, so aneuploidy could represent a major adaptive strategy of this parasite to modulate gene dosage in response to stressful environments. For the first time, we document the dynamics of aneuploidy throughout the life cycle of the parasite, in vitro and in vivo We show its adaptive impact on transcription and its interaction with regulation. Besides offering a new model for aneuploidy studies, we show that further genomic studies should be done directly in clinical samples without parasite isolation and that adequate methods should be developed for this. status: publishe...|$|R
