Provision of such services requires a broadband communications network, which should extend into the customers' premises up to the terminals.

A key element in the concept is the use of the graded index polymer optical fibre (GIPOF) which combines an intrinsically high bandwidth with easy and therefore low-cost handling. There are two opposite approaches for the choice of network topology. In one approach, all applications are forced onto a single topology. In the other approach, the topology best suited for each application type is used. This paper considers the ‘best-suited topology’ approach and presents a network infrastructure that can support many topologies simultaneously as independent overlay networks.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} an architecture for the Customer <b>Premises</b> <b>Network</b> (CPN) {{based on the}} Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM), applicable in residential and small business environments, {{in the framework of}} the Broadband Integrated Services Digital Network. The aim of this new proposal is to guarantee the internal communication in the customer <b>premises</b> <b>network,</b> allowing the support of all services envisaged for the residential and small business environments. These environments have specific characteristics with impact on the architecture mainly in what concerns its simplicity, flexibility, availability, performance and cost. The proposed solution consists in a distributed architecture with two hierarchical levels and it is based on a shared medium with an access mechanism characterized by a More Loaded First Served (MLFS) discipline. The resolution of critical situations where certain terminals may have delay thresholds is embedded in the global solution through a modification of the basic priority of each terminal (MMLFS). This discipline suits quite well the quick variations on the sources traffic patterns, typical of ATM, keeping on the other hand, the level of simplicity required by the target environments. In more complex applications, the traffic concentration in each network node is achieved by ATM multiplexers. The proposed ATM multiplexer is characterized by a modular and flexible architecture. It uses a decentralized contention mechanism that allows the evaluation of which input has the highest priority just before each cell transmissionAvailable from Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia, Servico de Informacao e Documentacao, Av.

40|$|Numbering and {{addressing}} issues arising in the Integrated Broadband Communication Network (IBCN) {{for the support}} of the Universal Mobile Telecommunication System (UMTS) and Personal Telecommunication Service (PTS) are dealt with in this paper. Mobile communications services will allow a user to roam within a network. Thus there will be a need to identify several types of objects (terminals, network points of attachment, users, Customer Premises Networks, etc.). The mobility properties of these objects will necessitate dynamic bindings between their addresses and names. Moreover, the situation is further complicated since the mobility may be embedded. A mobile user may employ a mobile terminal in a mobile Customer <b>Premises</b> <b>Network</b> (CPN). Therefore, in UMTS and PTS {{there is a need for}} dynamic binding of various identifiers with location information data. The exclusive use of Personal Telecommunication Numbers (PTN's) as Dialing Numbers (DN) is proposed in IBCN for UMTS and PTS. That is, PTN's will be used (during dialing) for making calls to mobile terminals, mobile users, as well as fixed subscribers. When the personal communication service is not provided, the DN corresponds to the terminal number of the equipment (fixed or mobile) of the called subscriber. Also, a proposal for the UMTS and PTS numbering plan is presented...|$|E

We present a proxy-based architecture that manages to accelerate Web browsing in wireless Customer <b>Premises</b> <b>Networks</b> (CPN). We discuss how such an architecture is implemented using the IBM Aglets framework for mobile agents. The suggested architecture relies heavily on proxy caches – maintained in base stations – which are relocated to follow a roaming user in other control areas (clusters of cells). The cache management scheme involves relocation of full caches to the most-likely-to-be visited control areas, but also fractions of the cache to less-likely-to-be-visited neighbours. A movement prediction algorithm, based on a learning automaton, is {{used to determine the}} future location of the terminal. The discussed architecture components have been implemented as Aglets to allow for the efficient introduction of the service in a CPN infrastructure...|$|R
