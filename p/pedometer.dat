40|$|In Japan, <b>pedometers</b> are {{so popular}} that most {{households}} there now have several. While <b>pedometers</b> have not yet reached this level of popularity in the United States, the media commonly discuss monitoring physical activity with <b>pedometers.</b> This discussion has focused both on its use as a monitoring device and {{as a means of}} physical activity motivation. With the inactivity of youths and adults raising concerns among health and fitness professionals, these professionals often ask questions about the validity and reliability of <b>pedometers</b> and the best ways to use them. This article, therefore, provides answers to teachers and health professionals' frequently asked questions about <b>pedometers...</b>|$|R
40|$|While <b>pedometers</b> have an {{important}} role to play in the promotion of lifestyle activity among adults, less known is regarding their impact on behavior among youth (i. e. children and adolescents). The primary aim of this review was to identify the effectiveness of <b>pedometers</b> in promoting physical activity among youth. Secondary aims were to assess the quality of existing studies and examine the different ways that <b>pedometers</b> have been used to promote activity. A systematic search of six electronic databases was conducted using combinations of the following key words ‘physical activity’, ‘walking’, ‘intervention’, ‘promotion’, ‘evaluation’, and ‘pedometer’. The quality of the studies was assessed against predetermined criteria. Our search identified 14 studies, of which 12 resulted in increases in physical activity. Three studies used <b>pedometers</b> as open-loop feedback mechanisms to increase physical activity by making access to sedentary activities contingent on achieving activity targets. Ten studies used <b>pedometers</b> for self-monitoring and one study incorporated <b>pedometers</b> into an integrated school curriculum. <b>Pedometers</b> have been used successfully {{in a variety of ways}} to promote activity among youth. Since there are so few studies at this time, there is ample need and opportunity to contribute to the knowledge base...|$|R
40|$|Older {{types of}} <b>pedometers</b> had varied levels of accuracy, which ranged from 0 % to 45 %. In addition, to obtain {{accurate}} results, {{it was also}} necessary to position them in a certain way. By contrast, newer models can be placed anywhere on the body; however, their accuracy is unknown when they are placed at different body sites. We determined the accuracy of various newer <b>pedometers</b> under controlled laboratory and free walking conditions. A total of 40 participants, who varied widely in age and body mass index, were recruited for the study. The numbers of steps recorded using five different <b>pedometers</b> placed at the waist, the chest, in a pocket, and on an armband were compared against those counted with a hand tally counter. With the exception of one, all the <b>pedometers</b> were accurate at moderate walking speeds, irrespective of their placement on the body. However, the accuracy tended to decrease at slower and faster walking speeds, especially when the <b>pedometers</b> were worn in the pockets or kept in the purse (p <  0. 05). In conclusion, most <b>pedometers</b> examined were accurate when they were placed at the waist, chest, and armband irrespective of the walking speed or terrain. However, some <b>pedometers</b> had reduced accuracy when they were kept in a pocket or placed in a purse, especially at a slower and faster walking speeds...|$|R
25|$|Many {{accessories}} {{have been}} made for the iPod line. A large number are made by third party companies, although many, such as the iPod Hi-Fi, are made by Apple. Some accessories add extra features that other music players have, such as sound recorders, FM radio tuners, wired remote controls, and audio/visual cables for TV connections. Other accessories offer unique features like the Nike+iPod <b>pedometer</b> and the iPod Camera Connector. Other notable accessories include external speakers, wireless remote controls, protective case, screen films, and wireless earphones. Among the first accessory manufacturers were Griffin Technology, Belkin, JBL, Bose, Monster Cable, and SendStation.|$|E
25|$|There are {{a variety}} of {{different}} kinds of walking, including bushwalking, racewalking, beach walking, hillwalking, volksmarching, Nordic walking, trekking and hiking. Some people prefer to walk indoors on a treadmill, or in a gym, and fitness walkers and others may use a <b>pedometer</b> to count their steps. Hiking is the usual word used in Canada, the United States and South Africa for long vigorous walks; similar walks are called tramps in New Zealand, or hill walking or just walking in Australia, the UK and the Irish Republic. Australians also bushwalk. In English-speaking parts of North America the term walking is used for short walks, especially in towns and cities. Snow shoeing is walking in snow; a slightly different gait is required compared with regular walking.|$|E

On Day 61, the housemates were given a walking task. Each housemate was given a <b>pedometer</b> and was asked {{to walk around the}} house for two hours.

40|$|Background: Self-monitoring using <b>pedometers</b> is an {{effective}} behaviour change technique to support increased physical activity (PA). However, {{the ways in which}} <b>pedometers</b> operate as motivational tools in adoption and maintenance of PA is not well understood. This paper investigates men’s experiences of <b>pedometers</b> as motivational tools both during and after their participation in a 12 -week group-based, weight management programme for overweight/obese men, Football Fans in Training (FFIT).

40|$|Sedentary {{behaviour}} is a {{major risk}} factor for chronic disease morbidity and mortality in aging. Measuring people activity through devices such as <b>pedometers</b> is a recognized intervention to motivate them for more physical activity. However, the feedback provided by these devices must be accurate {{in order to avoid}} overtraining and keep users' motivation alive. If the accuracy of <b>pedometers</b> has been validated for healthy people, their lack of accuracy for elderly people walking at slower pace has been reported in several studies. The emergence on the consumer's market of new devices that can be worn indifferently at the wrist or at the waist raises once more this concern. In order to evaluate whether pedometers' location influences their accuracy, we have tested three <b>pedometers</b> at different locations, and for several paces in a comparative study. Beyond confirming the decrease of pedometers' accuracy with speed reduction, our study reveals that <b>pedometers</b> should be worn at the waist rather than at the wrist. This leads us to recommend wearing <b>pedometers</b> at the waist when monitoring population with reduced mobility...|$|R

In hot and arid regions, day-foraging ants face death by desiccation, so the ability to find the shortest route back to the nest reduces that risk. Diurnal desert ants of the genus Cataglyphis such as the Sahara desert ant navigate by keeping track of direction as well as distance travelled. Distances travelled are measured using an internal <b>pedometer</b> that keeps count of the steps taken and also by evaluating the movement of objects in their visual field (optical flow).

40|$|AbstractObjectives to {{evaluate}} the role of <b>pedometers</b> {{in the assessment of}} patients with intermittent claudication by comparing them with treadmill testing, post-exercise ankle brachial pressure index (ABPI) and physical function questionnaires. Patients and methods fifty patients with intermittent claudication were prospectively assessed by treadmill examination measuring maximum walking distance (MWD) and post-exercise ABPI. Three physical function questionnaires: (1) Medical Outcome Study Short Form- 36 (MOS SF- 36), Physical Function (PF). (2) MOS SF- 36 Role limitation due to Physical Problems (RP). (3) Walking Impairment Questionnaire (WIQ) were completed. <b>Pedometers</b> were used for one week and the daily average number of steps taken by each patient recorded. <b>Pedometers</b> scores were compared with MWD, post-exercise ABPI and physical function questionnaires scores using Spearman correlation test. Results <b>pedometers</b> estimation of daily physical activity moderately correlated with MWD (Rho= 0. 35, p= 0. 01), post-exercise ABPI (Rho= 0. 35, p= 0. 01), MOS-SF 36 PF (Rho= 0. 31, p= 0. 02), MOS-SF RP (Rho= 0. 28, p= 0. 05) and with WIQ (Rho= 0. 42,p = 0. 003).
