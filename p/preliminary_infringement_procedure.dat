40|$|This article {{investigates the}} role of {{alternative}} compliance mechanisms in the EU: SOLVIT, EU-Pilot and the Internal Market Scoreboard. These mechanisms are theoretically meant as complementary and practical, cost-reducing alternatives to the EU <b>infringement</b> <b>procedures</b> and national court procedures. The mechanisms aim to, through peer pressure and informal contacts, prevent citizens and businesses that encounter problems with the application of EU law from having to start time-consuming and costly court procedures. Moreover, they serve to correct infringements of EU law {{at an early stage}} without recourse to official <b>infringement</b> <b>procedures</b> by the Commission. This article discusses how alternative problem-solving mechanisms work in practice, how they fit in the EU legal system and what, if any, influence they have on the official EU <b>infringement</b> <b>procedures.</b> It will be shown how the existence of such alternative mechanisms leads to an increase in the level of absolute compliance with EU law...|$|R

The <b>infringement</b> <b>procedure</b> is one of the enforcement mechanisms that can be applied by the Commission against a Member State whenever the Commission is of the opinion that the Member State is in breach of its obligations under EU law. Is a procedure with which the European Commission fulfils one of its most fundamental duties, that is supervision of the implementation of the acquis.

40|$|The <b>infringement</b> <b>procedure</b> {{becomes very}} {{important}} topic for Republic of Croatia, because we enter European Union in July this year. The {{aim of this}} paper is to draw the attention of seriousness of this procedure and to provide a complete review of the <b>infringement</b> <b>procedure</b> before the European Court of Justice. The “infringement procedure” empowers the European Court of Justice (ECJ) to conduct judicial review of Member States, or to control the compliance of the laws of the Member States with European Union (EU) law. It is the only procedure in which the European Court of Justice is authorized to directly control the validity of the law of the Member States. European Commission enjoys discretion to initiate this procedure, we hope that we would have some additional time to adapt European Union law...|$|R

40|$|The European Union’s <b>infringement</b> <b>procedure</b> {{is highly}} legalized. Nevertheless, {{as in other}} {{international}} institutions, non-compliance occurs {{on a regular basis}} and its transformation into compliance varies across EU infringement stages and over time. State of the art compliance literature focuses mainly on country-specific explanations, such as power, capacity, and legitimacy. In particular power-capacity models explain a good part of whether non-compliance occurs and how quickly it can be resolved. Yet, these approaches leave substantial parts of the empirical variation that we observe unexplained. This paper argues that policy and, in particular, rule-specific variables – although often neglected – are important for explaining non-compliance. Based on a quantitative analysis, we show that policy matters not only for the frequency with which EU law is violated, but also the persistence of non-compliance over time and over the different stages of the <b>infringement</b> <b>procedure.</b> European law; Europeanization; Europeanization...|$|R
40|$|The {{single market}} {{is one of}} the most wide-ranging and {{significant}} symbols of European integration. While it brings great opportunities to European citizens in theory, in practice, delayed and incorrect implementation of single market rules leave EU citizens with a highly fragmented ‘regulatory patchwork’, deterring citizens and businesses from exercising their rights. One way to solve such a problem is to turn to formal proceedings such as to the European Commission and its role as ‘Guardian of the Treaties’ and Treaty articles 258 - 260 TFEU, i. e. the <b>infringement</b> <b>procedure</b> or to a national court. An alternative way to guarantee street-level EU law enforcement is through SOLVIT; an out-of-court dispute settlement mechanism providing quicker solutions to problems of crossborder nature. This article provides a timely analysis of the reinforced <b>infringement</b> <b>procedure</b> and SOLVIT centres, how the system works and how we will be able to strengthen its strategic role to address the citizens ‘integration fatigue’...|$|R
50|$|The {{concession}} of Autostrada A31 {{was originally}} expired on 30 June 2013, which was agreed in 1999, {{after that the}} company started to construct the extension from Vicenza to Rovigo {{in the south in}} 2005. The concession was challenged by the European Commission in 2004. The European Court of Justice ruled that Italy failed to fulfill the obligations under European Council Directive 93/37/EEC. On 3 October 2006 Italian Decree-Law 262/2006 was announced, which amended the power of ANAS (both operator and regulator of Italian toll roads) in order to comply with EU rule. On 12 October European Commission sent a formal notice (applying Article 258 of TFEU) to Italy regarding the issue (<b>infringement</b> <b>procedure</b> N° 2006/4378). In July 2007 the concession was extended to 31 December 2026, applying Decree-Law 262/2006. The concession was confirmed by Decree-Law 59/2008 and Law 101/2008, despite the status of the <b>infringement</b> <b>procedure.</b> On 8 October 2009 European Council closed the case.|$|R

40|$|This article {{considers}} {{the impact of}} the infringement action under Art. 228 (2) of the EC Treaty in assisting in the enforcement of EC environmental law. Its entry into force in November 1993 introduced {{for the first time in}} EC law the possibility of financial sanctions being imposed on EU Member States by the European Court of Justice over persistent failures on their part to adhere to Community law. One might have thought that Member State performance on implementing EC environmental legislation would have improved as a result, the threat of substantial financial sanctions serving as an effective deterrent against non-compliant state behaviour. However, experience has indicated that any initial optimism in the new <b>infringement</b> <b>procedure</b> has been misplaced in this regard. The evidence suggests that in many instances Member States have not been deterred continuing to delay or obstruct the correct implementation of EC environmental obligations into national law and practice. In analysing the evolution of law and practice of the procedure and in particular its impact on litigation over breaches of environmental law over the last decade, this article questions whether the penalty <b>infringement</b> <b>procedure</b> under Art. 228 (2) has proved itself fit for purpose...|$|R

40|$|A {{comprehensive}} {{analysis of}} the European Commission's general role in supervising member state compliance with EU law, this book provides a detailed assessment of centralized EU enforcement. It starts out by asking whether it is viable to establish stronger Commission powers of enforcement {{at this point in}} time. Against this backdrop, and as a means of exploring the role of the Commission, the chapters examine a number of different aspects pertaining to enforcement of EU law. Beginning with an appraisal of the Commission's function under the general EU <b>infringement</b> <b>procedure</b> stipulated in Articles 258 and 260 TFEU, the volume argues that the EU lacks independent self-sustained regime authority. Moreover, this is reflected in both substantive EU law and procedural law, including the general EU <b>infringement</b> <b>procedure.</b> Chapter two makes the case that Article 258 TFEU can usefully be explained in terms of managerialism. Chapter three analyses Article 260 TFEU concerning repetitive infringements. In particular, it asserts, EU member state sanctions sustain the managerial approach. It then goes on to examine the Commission's unsuccessful attempts to gain sharper enforcement powers through secondary legislation, and identifies the effective points of functional overlap between enforcement powers and certain types of implementing tools. Finally, it discusses the Commission's role under various non-binding, ad hoc arrangements. The concluding chapter places the general EU <b>infringement</b> <b>procedure</b> in the broader context of a comprehensive (negotiated) policy process. It argues that the enforcement stage shares many features with earlier steps in the legislative process, including flexibility and deliberation. •	Introduction •	 1 : The Commission's General Powers of Enforcement •	 2 : Failure to Comply with EU Law: Article 258 TFEU •	 3 : Failure to Comply with a Judgement of the Court: Article 260 TFEU •	 4 : The Commission's Quest for Stronger Powers of Enforcement •	 5 : The Functional Overlap of Enforcement and Implementation Tools •	 6 : The Emergence of Non-Binding, Auxiliary Enforcement Procedures: Expert Management of Compliance with Directives •	 7 : The Commission's Enforcement Powers in Context •	BibliographyPublished version of EUI PhD thesis, 200...|$|R

40|$|Biodiversity is {{recognised}} {{as one of}} {{the main}} factors causing ecosystem stability and the existence of several ecosystem functions. In consequence, species richness can be a reliable state variable, useful to assess an ecosystem status or to identify highly valuable areas in a landscape. Here we present two applications in which species richness assessment allowed respectively the boundaries redesign of a part of the Natura 2000 network and an ex-post BACI (Before-After-Control-Impact) assessment as enforced by an <b>infringement</b> <b>procedure</b> for action against Article 4 of the Birds Directive. In the first case study, the boundaries of 16 Natura 2000 sites were redefined, identifying genuine scientific errors and expunging low species richness areas and incorporating high biodiversity areas whose value was not possible to assess when the sites were instituted. The overall balance involved a minimal surface area change (+ 1. 5 % SPAs, + 1. 6 % SCIs) but a net gain in high quality habitats in the redesigned sites network. The second case presents a small scale a posteriori impact assessment, where an exact quantification of habitat and species loss allowed not only reporting the European Commission as requested, but also to individuate a new Natural Reserve with identical ecological traits as measure of compensation, positively resolving the pending <b>infringement</b> <b>procedure...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{concepts}} and approaches of public marketing are moreover used and quantified {{in the national}} and European public systems. Adapted, with behaviours specific to the public system, the fundamental concepts of marketing represent a component of "the new culture of public service". The paper aims to present aspects concerning {{the use of the}} fundamental concepts of public marketing - service, market, placement -, in the European decision-making practice, respectively in the regulatory framework of the single market, in the framework of providing public goods and services in the European space. The paper emphasizes the impact of the application of <b>infringement</b> <b>procedures</b> during 1996 - 2010 on the market of services and satisfaction of citizens' needs. The regulation of the single market, the practices and „rules" of organisation and functioning are favouring the achievement of the economic and social function of the services of general interest, supporting the functionality of the internal market. The contribution of this paper consists in the analysis of the European regulations, of the content of procedures for sanctioning the EU Member States concerning the market and services from the prospect of the concepts of marketing, market, services, placement, satisfaction of public needs as well as of their interpretation. public service; market; consumer; regulation; <b>infringement</b> <b>procedure...</b>|$|R

The process of designation {{has not always been}} smooth as the <b>infringement</b> <b>procedures</b> against Member States show. While designation of sites may be near complete, the management and enforcement of protection on sites is less advanced and many sites lack management plans. Natura 2000 faced criticism from developers, farmers and politicians who fear that the conservation of habitats and species places a brake on development.|$|R
40|$|Through the <b>infringement</b> <b>procedure,</b> {{provided}} for by Article 226 of the Treaty establishing the European Community (TEC), the Commission can stimulate Member States to comply effectively with their obligations under Community law. In cases of non-compliance, the Commission may bring Member States before the Court of Justice of the EC (ECJ). Indeed, the Commission may use this possibility {{because it is}} the "guardian of the Treaty" and has to ensure the proper application of Community law, in line with Article 211 TEC. The White Paper on European Governance published by the Commission in 2001 emphasises that the primary responsibility for applying Community law lies with national administrations and courts in the Member States. Therefore, the primary objective of enforcement actions against Member States is to monitor their compliance and to respond to cases of non-compliance. However, through adequate exercise of its discretion and improved cooperation with Member States, the Commission aims to encourage them to comply voluntarily with Community law as quickly as possible. Furthermore, under the current Commission's strategic objectives for the period 2005 - 2009, prompt and adequate transposition and vigorous pursuit of infringements are considered critical to the credibility of European legislation and the effectiveness of policies. The <b>infringement</b> <b>procedure</b> is of crucial importance to the new Member States and of high relevance to the candidate countries that have applied for accession to the EU. On the one hand, they have to adopt the whole acquis upon accession with only few transitional periods granted in a limited number of areas. New Member States have already submitted a large number of transposition notifications to the Commission. On the other hand and despite their huge efforts, new Member States experience considerable difficulties in implementing directives and other EC legislative instruments. The process of implementation is a challenging stumbling block for all new Member States. This paper will focus on the recent and main trends in the application of enforcement actions against new Member States, not only taking an empirical angle (infringements by Member States and by sectors) but also involving analytical reasoning. This analysis serves to present the fundamentals and relevance of the <b>infringement</b> <b>procedure</b> in the framework of the enlarged European Union (the object of {{the first part of this}} paper) where administrations of the new Member States will have to adopt this new way of thinking and of implementing know-how (addressed in the second part) while acquiring a better understanding of the principal characteristics of the EC/EU's legal system (direct effect, supremacy, indirect effect, state liability) and of the EC's general principles of law. Therefore, the second part of the paper will also focus on justifications deemed acceptable by the ECJ and others that are considered inadmissible. New Member States have to adjust to the requirements of the acquis (possibilities of opting out are not included in the Accession Treaties) and this obligation applies to all independent state institutions (including the judiciary where reforms represent a prerequisite for accession by some candidate countries). Efficient further implementation of the acquis and adequate understanding of the <b>infringement</b> <b>procedure</b> will facilitate new Member States' (and candidate countries') integration in the EU and, eventually, make their accession a success...|$|R
