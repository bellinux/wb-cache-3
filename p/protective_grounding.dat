5000|$|In the TN-C system, {{a common}} {{conductor}} provides both the neutral and <b>protective</b> <b>grounding.</b> The neutral conductor {{is connected to}} earth ground {{at the point of}} supply, and equipment cases are connected to the neutral. The danger exists that a broken neutral connection will allow all the equipment cases to rise to a dangerous voltage if any leakage or insulation fault exists in any equipment. This can be mitigated with special cables but the cost is then higher.|$|E
50|$|This {{practice}} {{arose from}} the three-wire system used to supply both 120 volt and 240 volt loads. Because these listed appliances often have components that use either 120, or both 120 and 240 volts, there is often some current on the neutral wire. This differs from the <b>protective</b> <b>grounding</b> wire, which only carries current under fault conditions. Using the neutral conductor for grounding the equipment enclosure was considered safe since the devices were permanently wired to the supply and so the neutral was unlikely to be broken without also breaking both supply conductors. Also, the unbalanced current due to lamps and small motors in the appliances was small compared to the rating of the conductors and therefore unlikely to cause a large voltage drop in the neutral conductor.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{describes}} an algorithm {{of the complex}} automated monitoring of Ukraine’s power energy system, aimed at ensuring safety of its personnel and equipment. This monitoring involves usage of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for planned and unplanned registration status of power transmission lines (PTL) and high-voltage substations (HVS). It is assumed that unscheduled overflights will be made in emergency situations on power lines. With {{the help of the}} UAV, pictures of transmission and HVS will be recorded from the air in the optical and infrared ranges, as well as strength of electric (EF) and magnetic (MF) fields will be measured along the route of flight. Usage specially developed software allows to compare the recorded pictures with pre-UAV etalon patterns corresponding to normal operation of investigated transmission lines and the HVSs. Such reference pattern together with the experimentally obtained maps of HVS’s <b>protective</b> <b>grounding</b> will be summarized in a single document – a passport of HVS and PTL. This passport must also contain the measured and calculated values of strength levels of EF and MF in the places where staff of power facilities stay as well as layout of equipment, the most vulnerable to the effects of electromagnetic interference. If necessary, as part of ongoing monitoring, recommendations will be given on the design and location of electromagnetic screens, reducing the levels of electromagnetic interference as well as on location of lightning rods, reducing probability lightning attachment to the objects. The paper presents analytic expressions, which formed the basis of the developed software for calculation of the EF strength in the vicinity of power lines. This software will be used as a base at UAV navigation along the transmission lines, as well as to detect violations in the transmission lines operation. Comparison of distributions of EF strength calculated {{with the help of the}} elaborated software with the known literature data has been presented also. The difference between the proposed method of monitoring and the existing methods is full automation of the complex control of a number of parameters characterizing the state of the external power grid facilities, as well as its basic electrical parameters.

50|$|In digital systems, which {{commonly}} transmit data serially (RS232, RS485, USB, Firewire, DVI, HDMI etc) {{the signal}} voltage is often {{much larger than}} induced power frequency AC on the connecting cable screens, but different problems arise. Of those protocols listed, only RS232 is single-ended with ground return, {{but it is a}} large signal, typically + and - 12V, all the others being differential. Simplistically, the big problem with the differential protocols is that with slightly mismatched capacitance from the hot and cold wires to ground, or slightly mismatched hot and cold voltage swings or edge timing, the currents in the hot and cold wires will be unequal, and also a voltage will be coupled onto the signal screen, which will cause a circulating current at signal frequency and its harmonics, extending up to possibly many GHz. The difference in signal current magnitudes between the hot and cold conductors will try to flow from, for example, item A's <b>protective</b> <b>ground</b> conductor back to a common ground in the building, and back along item B's <b>protective</b> <b>ground</b> conductor.

30|$|Effects of fire on {{the ground}} surface with erosion-related {{implications}} include an increase in exposed soil and ash {{and a decrease in}} <b>protective</b> <b>ground</b> cover such as litter and duff. Post-fire organic ground cover, whether charred or uncharred, can provide protection against soil erosion (Ice et al. 2004, Kokaly et al. 2007). Conversely, areas with exposed mineral soil or ash cover increase the risk for erosion by wind and water (DeBano 2000, Robichaud 2000, Ravi et al. 2006). Ash cover is indicative of complete organic material combustion. Because a water repellent soil layer may be formed when these organic materials burn on the soil surface, reduced infiltration is often found where post-fire ash cover is high (DeBano 2000, Lewis et al. 2006). In such cases, the top 1 cm to 5 cm of the soil profile above the water repellent layer may hold water, but once this layer becomes saturated, as often occurs following intense rainfall, erosion is likely, particularly on steep slopes with loose, coarse textured soils. Additionally, these fire-induced water repellent soil conditions occur when waxy chemicals from plant materials are volatilized during burning and coat coarse textured soil particles at or near the soil surface, which is common in chaparral communities (Barro and Conard 1991, CDF 2003, Hubbert et al. 2006).|$|R
