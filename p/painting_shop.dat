The fabrication and integration facility consists of an assembling area, a <b>painting</b> <b>shop,</b> utility and warehouse area with a production capacity of 10,000 metric tons and a quay length of approximately 520m, depth of 13.5m and heavy lifting area of 5,000 metric tons.

5000|$|Despite his successes, the {{pressures}} of the Great Depression were unavoidable. Tokita created six oil paintings for the federal Public Works of Art Program, one of which was shown in the PWAP's 1934 National Exhibition at the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. [...] In 1936, slow business forced Tokita and Nomura to close down their sign <b>painting</b> <b>shop.</b> Tokita then became manager/operator of the Cadillac Hotel at Second and Jackson streets, just outside Japantown, while continuing as a freelance sign painter. With two time-consuming jobs and a growing family, his fine art production dropped off quickly.Tokita and his family lived in cramped quarters at the hotel, but managed to weather the Great Depression fairly well. Tokita bought a car, and took his kids on weekend trips to parks and the countryside. He competed in kyudo (ritualized traditional archery) tournaments and was an active participant in community events and celebrations. With his family he was a strict disciplinarian and traditionalist who allowed only Japanese to be spoken at home, but was relaxed and good-humored in larger settings. By the late 1930s, he appears to have ceased painting fine art almost entirely.|$|E

5000|$|Philipp Rosenthal, born March 6, 1855 in Werl, Germany, {{was the son}} of the {{porcelain}} merchant Abraham Rosenthal and Emilie Rosenthal, (born Meyer). Rosenthal was educated in his father's company and went to the USA at the age of 18, where he became {{the porcelain}} buyer of the Detroit-based porcelain import company Jacob Meyer Brothers. On his business trips looking for painted porcelain, he realized painted porcelain was a scarce commodity. So he decided in 1879 to return to Germany and open a porcelain <b>painting</b> <b>shop.</b> He started with two painters in Erkersreuth Castle using white porcelain from the porcelain factory Lorenz Hutschenreuther in neighboring Selb [...] The unexpected breakthrough, however, succeeded commercially with the ashtray [...] "little resting place for burning cigars". After a short time, Rosenthal employed 60 employees, moved the company to Selb, and opened its own porcelain factory there in 1889. Rosenthal expanded the company through new start-ups and acquisitions and converted it into Philipp Rosenthal & Co. AG in 1897. In 1916, Rosenthal introduced the eight- and twelve-sided dodecagon porcelain dinnerware set [...] "Maria," [...] which Rosenthal named after his second wife, Maria Franck, who was the daughter of the royal lawyer Josef Frank. She had divorced Frank in 1916 {{in order to be able}} to marry Rosenthal, who was much older. Rosenthal had two sons from his marriage to Maria, Philip Rosenthal and step-son Udo Franck-Rosenthal.|$|E
50|$|As {{a village}} {{with a central}} place function, three {{bakeries}} with “colonial wares” (originally, products from the “colonies”, thus coffee, tea, cane sugar, tobacco, rice and so on), two butcher’s shops and one Asko Europa-Stiftung branch covered basic demands after the Second World War and until about 1975. Available for further needs were two bank branches, a postal agency, a pharmacy, two textile shops, a shoe shop, an electrical shop, two retail and housewares shops, a stationery shop, a jewellery and watch shop, two shoemaker’s shops, an installation and heating system builder, a locksmith and blacksmith, a cabinetmaker, a <b>painting</b> <b>shop,</b> two hairdressing salons, three tailor’s shops, two dressmaker’s shops, an automotive workshop with a filling station, a Pfalzwerke AG (energy supplier) works and a Raiffeisen yard. These offerings were for a while bolstered by six inns and a cinema. Business and crafts ensured many jobs at that time. There was also work on farms, at the stone quarry and at the many diamond-cutting shops. With the mayoralty, the taxation ofﬁce, the constabulary, the primary school and the Hauptschule, Herschweiler-Pettersheim was a place with good infrastructure. With administrative restructuring in 1972, the village lost its central-place function. The mayoralty and the taxation ofﬁce were, {{in the face of}} the local populace’s opposition, dissolved and by law reassigned to the Verbandsgemeinde of Glan-Münchweiler, a great loss for the municipality, which now had to make do with being nothing more than a population centre. A further cause of this decline was the rising industrial output and mass production of daily needs, the rise of supermarkets, the population’s shift towards the throw-away society, unfavourable wage-price development in agriculture, craft occupations and the diamond industry, which sealed agriculture’s and local business’s fate. Even the post withdrew from the village and the area. Only a few survived the ruinous competition. Of all the businesses that were running just after the war, only one butcher’s shop (with a one-year interruption), one hairdressing salon, the pharmacy (run by Otto Carius) and two inns that both serve meals survived to the turn of the millennium. However, there were some new businesses that came to Herschweiler-Pettersheim in the meantime. Since 1982, a food market with baked goods and meat departments, two branch shops selling baked goods, a drink shop, a florist’s shop, a Turkish produce shop, a kebab shop and a tanning salon have located in the village. Also, in 1973, the Chalou GmbH clothing factory located on the Bockhof, manufacturing ladies’ outerwear. Following the general economic development, the actual production (sewing) was shifted to Eastern Europe, while designing, precutting, pattern creation, ﬁnal inspection, sales and distribution are all things that are handled at the Herschweiler-Pettersheim facility, which in 2004 employed roughly 70 women (but almost 100 in 1986). It is currently the biggest employer in the village and the biggest business tax payer in the Verbandsgemeinde. There are not very many job opportunities for villagers in the village itself nowadays. Indeed, Herschweiler-Pettersheim’s economic structure must be deemed to be rather weak. Most people in the workforce must therefore seek livelihoods in the Saarland and in the Kaiserslautern area, commuting to jobs.|$|E

40|$|This article {{outlines}} {{a simulation}} study {{relating to the}} design and the implementation of color rescheduling storage (CRS) in an automotive factory. In a <b>painting</b> <b>shop,</b> the colors of vehicles are changed frequently according to the assembly schedule. When {{the color of a}} vehicle is changed, the cleaning process of the painting gun is necessary, which generates a cost. The major objec-tive of CRS is to reduce the changeover cost in the painting process by grouping vehicles with the same color. In this article, a case study of CRS in an automotive factory is presented. The procedure for designing CRS is explained, and the storage/retrieval algorithms are suggested. The proposed system is verified using simulation models, and comparisons among alternatives are examined to determine the best design. The authors also investigate the effect of color distribution on the system performance measures...|$|E
