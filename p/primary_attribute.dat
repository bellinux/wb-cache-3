According to Marie Jackson, [...] "Nine out of ten pieces don't get in because they're not bad enough. What an artist considers to be bad doesn't always meet our low standards." [...] As stated in the introduction to The Museum of Bad Art: Masterworks, the <b>primary</b> <b>attribute</b> of an objet d'art to be acquired by MOBA is that it must have been seriously attempted by someone making an artistic statement. A lack of artistic skill is not essential for a work to be included; a prospective painting or sculpture for the collection ideally should [...] " [...] in a compelling image", or as honorary curator Ollie Hallowell stated, the art must have an [...] "Oh my God" [...] quality.|$|E
500|$|All heroes have a basic damage-dealing attack, in {{addition}} to powerful abilities. Each hero has at least four abilities, {{all of which are}} unique, which are the primary method of fighting. Heroes begin each game with an experience level of one, only having access to one of their abilities, but are able to level up and become more powerful {{during the course of the}} game, up to a maximum level of 25. Whenever a hero gains an experience level, the player is able to unlock another of their abilities or improve one already learned. The most powerful ability for each hero is known as their [...] "ultimate", which requires them to have an experience level of six in order to use. In order to prevent abilities from being used without consequence, a magic system in the game exists. Activating an ability costs a hero some of their [...] "mana points", which slowly regenerates over time. Using an ability will also cause it to enter a cooldown phase, in which the ability can not be used again until a timer counts down to zero. All heroes have three attributes: strength, intelligence, and agility, which affect health points, mana points, and attack speed, respectively. Each hero has one <b>primary</b> <b>attribute</b> out of the three, which adds to their non-ability basic damage output when increased. Heroes also have an ability augmentation system known as [...] "Talent Trees", which allow players further choices on how to develop their hero. If a hero runs out of health points and dies, they are removed from active play until a respawn timer counts down to zero, where they are then respawned in their base.|$|E

According to these matchings, occluded <b>primary</b> <b>attributes</b> are approximated by interpolations.

50|$|Every Digambara monk is {{required}} to observe 28 mula gunas (lit. twenty-eight <b>primary</b> <b>attributes)</b> compulsory. These are also called root-virtues, because {{it is said that}} in their absence other saintly virtues cannot be acquired. They are thus like the root, in the absence of which stems and branches tuneless come into being. These twenty-eight <b>primary</b> <b>attributes</b> are: five supreme vows (mahāvrata); five regulations (samiti); five-fold control of the senses (pañcendriya nirodha); six essential duties (Şadāvaśyaka); and seven rules or restrictions (niyama).|$|R

50|$|Guild Wars also {{introduces}} {{the ability to}} choose a secondary profession, expanding the selection of attributes and skills. A character does not, however, {{have access to the}} <b>primary</b> <b>attribute</b> of its secondary profession. Many, but not all, skills become more powerful with more points in a class’s <b>primary</b> <b>attribute.</b> A Warrior/Elementalist, therefore, is a warrior who may use spells in combat, although the Elementalist spells used will generally not have as much power as those of a primary Elementalist. This is increased by the fact that runes, which among other things increase attribute levels, can only increase the attribute levels associated with a player's primary profession.|$|E
50|$|Theologians in the Wesleyan Christian {{tradition}} (see Thomas Jay Oord) {{argue that}} omnibenevolence is God's <b>primary</b> <b>attribute.</b> As such, God's other attributes {{should be understood}} in light of omnibenevolence. Christians believe {{in the idea of}} unconditional love.|$|E

5000|$|Res extensa {{is one of}} {{the three}} {{substances}} described by René Descartes in his Cartesian ontology (often referred to as [...] "radical dualism"), alongside res cogitans and God.

The <b>primary</b> <b>attribute</b> of jōdan-no-kamae is always the weapon lifted above the head of the practitioner. One of the only significant variations is the relative position of the elbows. Some styles, such as aiki-ken, prefer the elbows to be as far inward as possible. Many others insist on the elbows being open.|$|E
50|$|Jainism {{made its}} own unique {{contribution}} to this mainstream development of philosophy by occupying itself with the basic epistemological issues.

As the soul obtains knowledge through various means, it does not generates anything new. It only shreds off the knowledge-obscuring karmic particles. According to Jainism, consciousness is a <b>primary</b> <b>attribute</b> of Jīva (soul) and this consciousness manifests itself as darsana (perception) and jnana (knowledge).|$|E
5000|$|We diverge from Descartes {{by holding}} {{that what he}} has {{described}} as <b>primary</b> <b>attributes</b> of physical bodies, are really the forms of internal relationships between actual occasions.

Many famous high coloratura sopranos such as Lily Pons, Toti Dal Monte, Rita Streich, and Amelita Galli-Curci, {{would not be}} classified as classic acuto sfogato sopranos {{because they did not}} sing in public above F6.|$|E
5000|$|Corvette, {{originally}} a small, lightly armed ship ordered by Winston Churchill, {{prime minister of}} Great Britain {{at the end of}} WW2. Corvette design was based on a commercial whale catcher, its <b>primary</b> <b>attribute</b> being ease of construction as an emergency wartime anti-submarine weapon. Its original engine was a reciprocating steam engine, original armament was one four inch gun, small arms and depth charges. Primary users of the World War II corvette were the British Royal Navy and the Royal Canadian Navy, although corvettes saw use elsewhere.|$|E

Pliny describes statues of the Aurae velificantes sua veste, [...] "making a sail with their garment," [...] at the Porticus Octaviae in Rome.
