50|$|This will {{be either}} a <b>precision</b> <b>approach</b> <b>radar</b> (PAR) or an airport {{surveillance}} <b>radar</b> (ASR) <b>approach.</b> Information is published in tabular form. The PAR provides vertical and lateral guidance plus range. The ASR only provides heading and range information.|$|R
50|$|The Army will {{continue}} to operate and maintain a <b>precision</b> <b>approach</b> <b>radar</b> (PAR) at Fort Sill's Henry Post Field for the foreseeable future. Since the Air Force frequently uses this service at Fort Sill, the agreement states the Army will provide the Air Force two years notice if future plans call for the cessation of PAR operations at Fort Sill. The agreement calls for the Army to continue {{the current level of}} funding for the operation and maintenance of the Fort Sill ARAC until the Sheppard RAPCON assumes the approach control responsibility. The Army {{will continue}} to fund the <b>precision</b> <b>approach</b> <b>radar</b> equipment and manpower necessary to support PAR operations at Henry Post Field.|$|R
50|$|On 1 July 2010 the Defence, Logistics and Environment {{operations}} of Elsag Datamat {{were transferred to}} SELEX Sistemi Integrati, together with Elsag's subsidiary Space Software Italia and the activities related to the PAR (<b>Precision</b> <b>Approach</b> <b>Radar)</b> radar systems for surface, land and naval applications, formerly owned by SELEX Galileo.|$|R
50|$|It {{is worth}} {{mentioning}} {{that in this}} TRACON for Windows version the player is given the option to work in TRACON or RAPCON but under RAPCON we simply see a classic Terminal Area Control over some military sectors, without any apparent possibility of reverting to the <b>Precision</b> <b>Approach</b> <b>Radar</b> position.|$|R
5000|$|The Carrier Controlled Approach is {{analogous}} to ground-controlled approach using the ship's <b>precision</b> <b>approach</b> <b>radar.</b> Pilots are told (via voice radio) where they are in relation to glideslope and final bearing (e.g., [...] "above glideslope, right of centerline"). The pilot then makes a correction and awaits further information from the controller.|$|R
50|$|The {{squadron}} {{was quickly}} repurposed {{and brought back}} on 1 August 1962 as Marine Air Traffic Control Unit 73 (MATCU-73). MATCU-73 was responsible for providing air traffic control and <b>precision</b> <b>approach</b> <b>radar</b> services at NAS South Weymouth. This new designation {{did not last long}} because on 1 January 1963 they reverted to MACS-21.|$|R
50|$|<b>Precision</b> <b>approach</b> <b>radars</b> (PAR) are {{commonly}} used by military controllers of airforces of several countries, to assist the pilot in final phases of landing in places where instrument landing system and other sophisticated airborne equipment are unavailable to assist the pilots in marginal or near zero visibility conditions. This procedure is also called talkdowns.|$|R
50|$|Larger {{airports}} sometimes offer <b>precision</b> <b>approach</b> <b>radar</b> (PAR), {{but these}} systems {{are more common}} at military air bases than civilian airports. The aircraft's horizontal and vertical movement is tracked via radar, and the controller tells the pilot his position relative to the approach slope. Once the pilots can see the runway lights, they may continue with a visual landing.|$|R
50|$|<b>Precision</b> <b>approach</b> <b>radars</b> {{are most}} {{frequently}} used at military air traffic control facilities. Many of these facilities use the AN/FPN-63, AN/MPN, or AN/TPN-22. These radars can provide precision guidance to a distance of 10 to 20 miles. The OJ-333 Radar scope is the indicator which the air traffic controller uses to provide instructions to the pilots.|$|R
25|$|Celle Air Base is {{equipped}} with a non-directional beacon (Frequency: 311 MHz, Identification: CEL). This is used for approach and departure procedures of Celle {{as well as for the}} airports Hanover and Braunschweig-Wolfsburg and as a waypoint for two airways (J803 und T803) in radio navigation. Additionally, the airfield {{is equipped}} with a <b>precision</b> <b>approach</b> <b>radar</b> (PAR-80) and airport surveillance radar (ASR-910).|$|R
50|$|To {{meet these}} {{requirements}} the report recommended installation of {{airport surveillance radar}} and installation of VHF omnidirectional range (VOR)/distance measuring equipment (DME) on aircraft. In addition the report made several other recommendations such as installing transponders to aircraft to provide altitude and identification information to ground-based radar and to install <b>precision</b> <b>approach</b> <b>radar</b> to improve the capability of aircraft to land in poor weather conditions.|$|R
50|$|The {{control tower}} {{constructed}} {{during the war}} burned down in an extensive fire on March 17, 1946, which caused $1.5 million worth of damage. Construction was not begun on a new tower until 1951; it was opened in June 1952. A new Tower/Communications Building replaced that structure in March 1976. The tower was equipped with radio navigation and landing aids including <b>precision</b> <b>approach</b> <b>radar,</b> non-directional beacon and VHF omni-directional range.|$|R
50|$|The ground-controlled {{approach}} was normal until the aircraft was {{seen on the}} <b>precision</b> <b>approach</b> <b>radar</b> suddenly descending below the glide slope. At 850 m (2,800 ft) from the runway threshold, the aircraft's landing gear struck part of the approach lighting system. The pilot {{lost control of the}} aircraft as it hit several more obstructions, including the 2 m (7 ft) seawall at the runway threshold, leaving a half mile long trail of burning wreckage on the airfield.|$|R
50|$|For {{military}} users, TLS {{also provides}} a <b>Precision</b> <b>Approach</b> <b>Radar</b> (PAR) graphic display of aircraft position compared to the desired approach course {{in order for a}} PAR operator to provide talk-down guidance to the pilot. Since the TLS operates using the long range band of SSR (1030/1090 MHz) there is no rain fade such as experienced with a traditional PAR that uses primary radar. For a traditional PAR, the ability to track the aircraft position is dependent on the aircraft radar cross section.|$|R
50|$|There {{are three}} types of IAPs: <b>precision</b> <b>{{approach}}</b> (PA), approach with vertical guidance (APV), and nonprecision approach (NPA). A PA uses a navigation system that provides course and glidepath deviation. Examples include <b>precision</b> <b>approach</b> <b>radar</b> (PAR), instrument landing system (ILS), and GBAS landing system (GLS). An APV also uses a navigation system for course and glidepath deviation, just not to the same standards as a PA. Examples include baro-VNAV, localizer type directional aid (LDA) with glidepath, LNAV/VNAV and LPV. An NPA uses a navigation system for course deviation but does not provide glidepath information. These approaches include VOR, NDB and LNAV. NPAs are flown to a minimum descent altitude (MDA).|$|R
5000|$|AN/MPN-11 was {{a mobile}} (trailer-mounted) {{version of the}} AN/CPN-4 GCA unit. The CPN-4 was the {{follow-on}} replacement for the MPN-1. It contained newer, more powerful radars, better radios including UHF as standard and power-operated slewing of the <b>precision</b> <b>approach</b> <b>radar</b> (PAR) antennas. The horizontal and vertical radar presentations were contained on a single CRT screen. If necessary, a single operator could perform all of the GCA functions. (CPN stands for air-transportable [...] "Cargo" [...] Radar for Navigation.) The entire CPN-4 unit could {{be broken down into}} air-transportable pieces.) ...|$|R
5000|$|In {{aviation}} a {{ground-controlled approach}} (GCA), {{is a type}} of service provided by air-traffic controllers whereby they guide aircraft to a safe landing, including in adverse weather conditions, based on primary radar images. Most commonly a GCA uses information from either a <b>Precision</b> <b>Approach</b> <b>Radar</b> (PAR, for <b>precision</b> <b>approaches</b> with vertical, glidepath guidance) or an Airport Surveillance Radar (ASR, providing a non-precision Surveillance <b>radar</b> <b>approach</b> with no glidepath guidance). The term GCA may refer to any type of ground <b>radar</b> guided <b>approach</b> such as a PAR, PAR without glideslope or ASR. When both vertical and horizontal guidance from the PAR is given, the approach is termed a <b>precision</b> <b>approach.</b> If no PAR glidepath is given, even if PAR equipment is used for lateral guidance, it is considered a non-precision approach ...|$|R
50|$|The {{aircraft}} was descended with guidance from {{air traffic control}} using a <b>precision</b> <b>approach</b> <b>radar.</b> Despite this the crew allowed the aircraft to descend too quickly and failed to check what was the decision height for Leipzig Airport. The Tu-134 struck a radio mast only two to three metres above its base and crashed. Three of the six crew and 24 of the 28 passengers {{were killed in the}} crash. The majority of the passengers were travelling to visit the Leipzig Trade Fair. The surviving crewmembers and the radar controller were all sentenced to prison terms {{as a result of the}} crash.|$|R
5000|$|The {{specialist}} Beta Scan Scope {{was used}} for <b>precision</b> <b>approach</b> <b>radar</b> systems. It displays two lines on the same display, the upper one (typically) displaying the vertical approach (the glideslope), and the lower one the horizontal approach. A marker indicates the desired touchdown point on the runway, and often the lines are angled towards {{the middle of the}} screen to indicate this location. A single aircraft's [...] "blip" [...] is also displayed, superimposed over both lines, the signals being generated from separate antennas. Deviation from the centerline of the approach can be seen and easily relayed to the pilot.|$|R
40|$|The {{functional}} requirements and operating environment constraints are defined {{for an independent}} landing monitor ILM which provides the flight crew with an independent assessment of {{the operation of the}} primary automatic landing system. The capabilities of radars, TV, forward looking infrared radiometers, multilateration, microwave radiometers, interferometers, and nuclear sensing concepts to meet the ILM conditions are analyzed. The most critical need for the ILM appears in the landing sequence from 1000 to 2000 meters from threshold through rollout. Of the sensing concepts analyzed, the following show potential of becoming feasible ILM's: redundant microwave landings systems, <b>precision</b> <b>approach</b> <b>radar,</b> airborne triangulation radar, multilateration with radar altimetry, and nuclear sensing...|$|R
5000|$|Ground-controlled {{approach}} is the oldest air traffic technique to fully implement radar to service a plane. The system was simple, direct, and worked well, even with previously untrained pilots. It requires close communication between ground-based air traffic controllers and pilots in approaching aircraft. Only one pilot is guided at a time (max. 2 under certain circumstances). The controllers monitor dedicated <b>precision</b> <b>approach</b> <b>radar</b> systems, to determine the precise course and altitude of approaching aircraft. The controllers then provide verbal instructions by radio to the pilots to guide them to a landing. The instructions include both descent rate (glidepath) and heading (course) corrections necessary to follow the correct approach path.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the accuracy on the {{approach and landing}} of aircraft to an airport through comparison with airbase <b>Precision</b> <b>Approach</b> <b>Radar</b> and aircraft track data of DGPS equipped in aircraft. The proposed analysis result could be a basis for verifying the possibility that DGPS can be utilized in Airbase <b>precision</b> <b>approach</b> and landing. Position identification capability of widely used commercial DGPS is fairly accurate on latitude and longitude, {{while there is a}} slight error for being used in an airbase accurate approach and landing of Category I precision when it comes to altitude. Thus, we tested accuracy by analyzing actual flight track data of high performance aircraft to verify the accuracy of the airbase approach and landing using DGPS. Through the research, we developed instrumentation to compare PAR track data with DGPS track data, which can be used in reducin...|$|R
25|$|Each {{air force}} base is {{equipped}} with air field <b>radar</b> <b>approach</b> systems (AFRAS) that monitors air traffic within the Air Field's operational sector 24 hours per day. These systems include primary <b>approach</b> <b>radars,</b> <b>precision</b> <b>approach</b> <b>radars,</b> and secondary surveillance radar and display systems. These systems {{have a range of}} more than 120km. The AFRAS are maintained by Saab Grintek as well as Tellumat. Air Force Base Overberg in the Western Cape is also equipped with a Doppler tracking radar and is used primarily by the Test Flight and Development Centre SAAF and the Denel Overberg Test Range for aircraft and missile development tests. In the Western Cape there is a radar station at Kapteinskop, jointly used by Air Force Base Langebaanweg and Cape Town International Airport to monitor air traffic. Air Force Base Makhado has another radar station located in the mountains {{to the north of the}} main base complex apart from its AFRAS radar (located in the main base itself).|$|R
40|$|Currently, the Department of Defense DoD uses several Precision Landing Systems (PLS) {{including}} the Instrument Landing System (ILS), Automatic Carrier Landing System (ACLS), and <b>Precision</b> <b>Approach</b> <b>Radar</b> (PAR). Each system requires different avionics, ground station equipment {{and are not}} universally implemented in the different services. This has lead to interoperability problems among the services. Additionally, these landing systems have numerous deficiencies, which include deployablility, manpower requirements, and frequency congestion. Therefore, a new Precision Landing System is necessary to meet DoD requirements. An evaluation of several different Differential GPS systems was performed. This evaluation involved a comparison of system capabilities against the requirements established by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the DoD requirements. The results showed that most Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) Differential OPS systems meet or exceed the requirements identified by the DoD. U. S. Marine Corps (U. S. M. C.) author...|$|R
5000|$|At {{the same}} time with TRACON 1.5, another version {{appeared}} that simulated in particular the military <b>precision</b> <b>approach</b> phase from the same producer and with the same file and simulation syntax, under the title RAPCON [...] This version, remained the unique ever PC simulator {{for this type of}} approach known as well under the term GCA for Ground Control Approach. Although it starts as a normal Terminal Area Control, at the moment a flight is put on its final track, by pressing the F2 key, the aircraft was transferred to the GCA position and the screen was changed to the equivalent <b>Precision</b> <b>Approach</b> <b>Radar</b> one, {{while the rest of the}} traffic was actually 'frozen', meaning that you could continue control this single aircraft and after landing, you could then move over to the previous Terminal Area Control to keep on with the rest of the traffic that had stayed at the moment you moved to the GCA position. All the commands for this particular type of control were available additionally to the standard ones for TRACON. There was apparently no other update of this version ever since ...|$|R
50|$|<b>Precision</b> <b>approach</b> <b>radar</b> (PAR) {{is a type}} of radar {{guidance}} system designed to provide lateral and vertical guidance to an aircraft pilot for landing, until the landing threshold is reached. After the aircraft reaches the decision height (DH) or decision altitude (DA), guidance is advisory only. Controllers monitoring the PAR displays observe each aircraft's position and issue instructions to the pilot that keep the aircraft on course and glidepath during final approach. It is similar to an instrument landing system (ILS) but requires control instructions. One type of instrument approach that can make use of PAR is the ground-controlled approach (GCA). Air traffic controllers must transmit a minimum of every 5 seconds to the pilot their relation to the azimuth portion and, once intercepting the glidepath, their elevation. The approach is terminated when the aircraft reaches the OCA/H (Obstacle Clearance Altitude/Height). Nevertheless, information is provided till threshold and aircraft may be monitored by controller till touchdown. Controller in charge of PAR should not be responsible for any duty other than the PAR approach concerned.|$|R
50|$|The Air Operations Department employs 230 {{military}} and civilian personnel to operate NAS Meridain/McCain Field and Naval Outlying Landing Field (NOLF) Joe Williams. Their primary mission is to support Commander, Training Air Wing ONE, the wing's subordinate training squadrons and its associated T-45 Goshawk aircraft {{in the conduct of}} undergraduate strike pilot training. Additional services are furnished to support operations for NAS and transient military aircrews. Air Traffic Control Division operates the control tower and radar final control systems. They provide flight planning services and issue clearances and instructions to pilots for all phases of military flight operations within the vicinity of the airport.
