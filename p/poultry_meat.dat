However, for boneless, skinless chicken breast, the amount is much lower.

5|$|As {{the home}} country of {{beetroot}} borscht, Ukraine boasts great {{diversity of the}} soup's regional variants, with virtually every province having its own recipe. Differences between particular varieties may regard the type of stock used (meat, bone, or both), the kind of meat (beef, pork, poultry, etc.), the choice of vegetables and the method of cutting and cooking them. For example, although the typical recipe calls for beef and pork, the Kiev variant uses mutton or lamb as well as beef, while in the Poltava region, the stock for borscht is cooked on <b>poultry</b> <b>meat,</b> that is, chicken, duck or goose. The use of zucchini, beans and apples is characteristic of the Chernihiv borscht; in this variant, beetroots are sautéed in vegetable oil rather than lard, and the sour taste comes solely from tomatoes and tart apples. The Lviv borscht is based on bone stock and is served with chunks of Vienna sausages.|$|E

40|$|Tenderness in {{boneless}} <b>poultry</b> breast <b>meat</b> is {{of utmost}} importance to consumers. However, there is currently no nondestructive method to predict <b>poultry</b> breast <b>meat</b> tenderness. Textural properties of <b>poultry</b> breast <b>meat</b> were predicted by near-infrared reflectance (NIR) spectroscopy. Spectra were collected on 390 poultry Pectoralis major muscles from broiler carcasses to examine the correlation between NIR spectroscopy and the Meullenet-Owens Razor Shear (MORS) test. Two instrumental parameters (maximum shear force and total shear energy) were used as estimates of meat tenderness. Calibration (R 2 cal) and validation (r 2 val) coefficients of determination were used for predicting instrumental measurements using the reflectance, and its first and second derivatives. The model using second derivative reflectance data yielded the best results for all samples. Regressions preformed on these samples produced R 2 cal values ranging from 0. 70 to 0. 75 and r 2 val values ranging from 0. 59 to 0. 65 for maximum shear force and total shear energy, demonstrating the potential of NIR to predict <b>poultry</b> breast <b>meat</b> tenderness. These findings could have a practical importance as this method could qualify NIR for an online assessment to sort <b>poultry</b> breast <b>meat</b> according to tenderness levels...|$|R
