40|$|Background: <b>Pneumatic</b> <b>tube</b> {{transport}} of pathology specimens from {{the emergency department}} to the laboratory for analysis is a widely used practice. When compared to manual specimen transport, it results in savings in both time and labour. Sampling of cerebrospinal fluid still forms part of the workup of patients with suspected subarachnoid haemorrhage. There are claims in the literature that {{transport of}} cerebrospinal fluid samples by <b>pneumatic</b> <b>tube</b> results in excess haemolysis, which interferes with cerebrospinal fluid analysis {{for the presence of}} bilirubin. The aim of our study was to ascertain whether <b>pneumatic</b> <b>tube</b> transport of blood-stained cerebrospinal fluid to the laboratory, results in clinically significantly higher levels of haemolysis compared with manual transport of the same specimens. Methods: Stored cerebrospinal fluid was spiked with varying amounts of red blood cells creating 72 specimens of varying red cell concentration. Half of these specimens were transported to the laboratory manually while the other half were sent by <b>pneumatic</b> <b>tube</b> transport. The rates of haemolysis were compared between the <b>pneumatic</b> <b>tube</b> and manual transport samples. Results: There was no clinically significant difference in the rates of haemolysis between the samples transported to the laboratory by <b>pneumatic</b> <b>tube</b> compared with those moved manually. Conclusions: <b>Pneumatic</b> <b>tube</b> transport of cerebrospinal fluid to the laboratory is not associated with clinically significantly higher rates of haemolysis when compared to manual transport...|$|R

50|$|<b>Pneumatic</b> <b>tubes</b> (or capsule pipelines; {{also known}} as <b>pneumatic</b> <b>tube</b> {{transport}} or PTT) are systems that propel cylindrical containers through networks of tubes by compressed air or by partial vacuum. They are used for transporting solid objects, as opposed to conventional pipelines, which transport fluids. <b>Pneumatic</b> <b>tube</b> networks gained acceptance in the late 19th and early 20th centuries for offices that needed to transport small, urgent packages (such as mail, paperwork, or money) over relatively short distances (within a building, or at most, within a city). Some installations grew to great complexity, but were mostly superseded. In some settings, such as hospitals, they remain widespread and have been further extended and developed in recent decades.|$|R

We have used this approach to analyze numerous <b>pneumatic</b> <b>tubes</b> systems in the United States and present a representative case study from a large tertiary care hospital. Our general approach can be generalized to other computer controlled hospital operational systems such as elevators, track vehicles, automatic guided vehicles, workflow enabled processes, and laboratory automation systems.

30|$|Moreover, in the {{commercial}} <b>pneumatic</b> <b>tube</b> conveyor combined with a parts feedersystem, parts are supplied via the pushing force of a parts feeder system. However, as mentioned, Au grains must be aligned before the treatment, and cannot be supplied by the pushing force of a part feeder system during the treatment. Therefore, a special <b>pneumatic</b> <b>tube</b> conveyor needs to be designed to shoot Au grains. The shooting subdevice that we developed satisfies the requirement for shooting Au grains.|$|R

Methods: This is a single centre study with 20 healthy volunteers. Five whole blood samples were transferred to the central haematology laboratory by either normal transport or pneumatic delivery with different speed and acceleration forces. EXTEM, INTEM, FIBTEM and APTEM were analysed in parallel with two ROTEM® devices and compared. Acceleration forces were measured during transport with two different instruments. Results: Increment of transport time, speed and distance resulted in an augmentation of acceleration forces and peaks. All results of the ROTEM® analysis after manual transport or pneumatic delivery were within normal range. However, increase in acceleration forces resulted in minimally but statistically significant changes in multiple ROTEM® parameters. The higher the acceleration forces, the more ROTEM® parameters are influenced. Conclusions: Acceleration forces during transport through a <b>pneumatic</b> <b>tube</b> system have an influence on ROTEM® parameters. Prior to transfer blood samples via <b>pneumatic</b> <b>tube</b> system these influences should be tested to exclude clinically relevant blood coagulation activation in vitr...|$|R
