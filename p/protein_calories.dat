40|$|ABSTRACT Cytogenetic {{studies were}} carried out in five {{children}} suffering from moderate to severe <b>protein</b> <b>calorie</b> malnutrition and five healthy controls, using direct preparations of bone marrow using conventional techniques. In the control group there were two abnormalities out of 152 plates analyzed, and in the malnutrition group there were 16 out of 186.

40|$|CONTEXT: Cirrhosis, {{diabetes}} mellitus, impaired glucose tolerance, insulin resistance, and <b>protein</b> <b>calorie</b> malnutrition {{are important}} issues in cirrhotic patients {{because they can}} increase the progression of liver disease and worsen its prognosis. OBJECTIVE:To determine the prevalence of diabetes mellitus, impaired glucose tolerance and insulin resistance in cirrhotic patients being evaluated for liver transplantation and their impacts on a 3 -month follow-up, and to compare fasting glycemia and oral glucose tolerance test. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was performed in consecutively included adult patients. Diabetes mellitus was established through fasting glycemia and oral glucose tolerance test in diagnosing diabetes mellitus in this population. HOMA-IR and HOMA-&# 946; indexes were calculated, and nutritional assessment was performed by subjective global assessment, anthropometry and handgrip strength through dynamometry. RESULTS: Diabetes mellitus was found in 40 patients (64. 5 %), 9 (22. 5 %) of them by fasting glycemia and 31 (77. 5 %) of them by oral glucose tolerance test. Insulin resistance was found in 40 (69 %) of the patients. There was no relationship between diabetes mellitus and the etiology of cirrhosis. <b>Protein</b> <b>calorie</b> malnutrition was diagnosed in a range from 3. 22 % to 45. 2 % by anthropometry, 58. 1 % by subjective global assessment and 88. 7 % by handgrip strength.

Four rats fed each level of protein were killed 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 days after they were divided into two groups. A study similar to that carried out on rats was conducted on six male college students who were living in the same unit of a cooking dormitory. Blood and urine samples were taken when they were eating a normal diet as a control and then they were adapted on a low protein dict providing 12 per cent of the calories as protein for two weeks.

The rats fed the 40 per cent casein diet had a higher rate of weight gain and increased amounts of urine per 24 hours than the rats fed the 10 per cent casein diet. Urinary output of the human subjects on the diets containing 30 per cent <b>protein</b> <b>calories</b> was greater than when they received the 12 per cent protein calorie diet.

Ko significant effects or trends in serum amino nitrogen of humans, or serum creatinine in rats or humans were observed with the change in the level of dietary protein. The high casein diet fed to rats reduced the excretion of creatinine and serum uric acid, while the high meat intake increased the excretion of creatinine and of uric acid in the humans. It was also found that there was a high negative correlation between serum uric acid and urinary uric acid of rats, and between serum amino nitrogen and urinary amino nitrogen of human subjects.

Soyabean {{proves to be}} the most popular means of relief from <b>Protein</b> <b>Calorie</b> Malnutrition (PCM) as protein from animals is beyond the cost many people can afford. To bridge the {{widening}} gap between protein requirement and availability soyabean is expected to constitute the main source of protein for the future. Although a lot has been achieved, a lot still has to be done in processing. The relatively recent discovery that soyabean may prevent a number of diseases may result in increased acceptance of soyabean if there is adequate awareness. Many authors have reported the nutritional value of soyabean. The quality of soyabean has actually been underestimated until recently. It is now concluded that the quality of soyabean protein is comparable to that of animal protein sources such as milk and beef. Soyabean produces high quality oil about 20 % of its content and protein about 40 % of the bean. Its protein content is superior, with substantial levels of most essential amino acids. Consumption of foods containing soyabean and soyabean products has been associated with improved heart disease risk factors, reduced osteoporosis, alleviation of menopausal symptoms, reduced cancer risk and in a limited number of studies reduced diabetes and helps people to stay lean and has no cholesterol. The degree of milling soyabean influences the palatability and digestibility. High protein yield is ensured at the end of processing as well as maintenance of texture.
