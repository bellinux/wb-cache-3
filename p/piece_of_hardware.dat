25|$|In the 1980s, {{developing}} {{software that}} could function {{with a wide}} range of graphics hardware was a real challenge. Software developers wrote custom interfaces and drivers for each <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>hardware.</b> This was expensive and resulted in multiplication of effort.|$|E
25|$|In revertive pulsing, the pulses {{were sent}} in the reverse {{direction}} to the sender, a complex and sophisticated <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>hardware.</b> If a selector failed to advance, it stopped sending pulses to the sender. A timer in the sender detected the failure, returned a trouble tone to the caller, held the switch train out of service with a grounded sleeve lead so no other caller could use the faulty circuit. An automated alarm alerted maintenance staff.|$|E
25|$|The Model M is also {{regarded}} as a timeless and durable <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>hardware.</b> Although the computers and computer peripherals produced concurrently with the Model M are considered obsolete, many Model M keyboards are still in use due to their physical durability and the continued validity of their ANSI 101-key and ISO 102-key layouts. Since their original popularity, new generations of writers and computer technicians have rediscovered their unique functionality and aesthetics. The Kentucky-based company Unicomp continues to manufacture and sell Model M-style keyboards.|$|E
40|$|In this invention, {{command and}} monitor {{functionality}} is moved {{between the two}} independent <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>hardware,</b> in which one had been dedicated to command and the other had been dedicated to monitor, such that some command and some monitor functionality appears in each. The only constraint is that the monitor for signal cannot {{be in the same}} hardware as the command I/O it is monitoring. The splitting of the command outputs between independent <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>hardware</b> may require some communication between them, i. e. an intra-switch trunk line. This innovation reduces the amount <b>of</b> wasted <b>hardware</b> and allows the two independent <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>hardware</b> to be designed identically in order to save development costs...|$|R
25|$|Expansions are {{configured}} automatically by AutoConfig software, so multiple <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>hardware</b> did not {{conflict with}} each other.|$|R

25|$|In other words, a given <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>hardware</b> or {{software}} {{is a part}} of the TCB if and only if it has been designed to be a part of the mechanism that provides its security to the computer system. In operating systems, this typically consists of the kernel (or microkernel) and a select set of system utilities (for example, setuid programs and daemons in UNIX systems). In programming languages that have security features designed in such as Java and E, the TCB is formed of the language runtime and standard library.|$|E
25|$|Nishi {{proposed}} MSX as {{an attempt}} to create a single industry standard for home computers. Inspired by the success of VHS as a standard for video cassette recorders, many Japanese electronic manufacturers along with GoldStar, Philips and Spectravideo built and promoted MSX computers. Any <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>hardware</b> or software with the MSX logo on it was compatible with MSX products of other manufacturers. In particular, the expansion cartridge form and function were part of the standard; any MSX expansion or game cartridge would work in any MSX computer.|$|E
25|$|On {{the second}} {{generation}} iPod Shuffle, USB connectivity is provided via an included <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>hardware</b> which acts as a docking station for the transfer of data and the recharging of the iPod's internal battery through its headphone jack. The second generation iPod Shuffle was also able {{to act as a}} flash drive, just like the first generation iPod Shuffle. However, unlike the first generation iPod Shuffle, {{the second generation}} did not have a built-in USB connector. This means that the docking station was required for connection to a computer.|$|E
5000|$|In stagecraft, a c-clamp {{can refer}} to a number <b>of</b> {{different}} <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>hardware,</b> depending on its intended use.|$|R

50|$|It {{should be}} noted, however, {{that due to}} the customizability of the laptop, most reviews {{available}} online refer to {{different versions of the}} 1525, containing varying <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>hardware.</b>|$|R
25|$|In {{many modern}} CPUs, the {{protection}} of the memory that hosts the TCB is achieved by adding in a specialized <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>hardware</b> called the memory management unit (MMU), which is programmable by the operating system to allow and deny access to specific ranges of the system memory to the programs being run. Of course, the operating system is also able to disallow such programming to the other programs. This technique is called supervisor mode; compared to more crude approaches (such as storing the TCB in ROM, or equivalently, using the Harvard architecture), it has the advantage of allowing the security-critical software to be upgraded in the field, although allowing secure upgrades of the trusted computing base poses bootstrap problems of its own.|$|E
500|$|The [...] is a {{handheld}} game console released in Japan by Bandai. It {{was developed by}} Gunpei Yokoi's company Koto Laboratory and Bandai, and was the last <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>hardware</b> Yokoi developed {{before his death in}} 1997. Released in 1999 in the fifth generation of video game consoles, the WonderSwan and its two later models, the WonderSwan Color and SwanCrystal were officially supported until being discontinued by Bandai in 2003. [...] During its lifespan, no variation of the WonderSwan was released outside of Japan.|$|E
500|$|On 21 September, {{the anniversary}} of the day in 1991 when Armenians voted in favor of leaving the Soviet Union in a referendum, a {{military}} parade was held in Yerevan's Republic Square. Vazgen Sargsyan [...] "was visibly the most excited of the government leaders standing on a specially built pedestal." [...] In a short briefing after the parade, Sargsyan enthusiastically stated that he had [...] "touched almost every <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>hardware</b> you've just seen" [...] and continued that he [...] "just wanted to show it" [...] to the Armenian people.|$|E

5000|$|The Prices <b>of</b> {{different}} <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> graphics <b>hardware</b> vary due to {{the power}} and speed <b>of</b> the <b>piece.</b> Most high end gaming <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>hardware</b> are dedicated graphics cards, and cost over $200, and can {{go as high as}} the price of a new computer, depending on the quality wanted. In the graphics cards department, using integrated chips is much cheaper than buying a dedicated card, however the performance conforms to the price.|$|R

500|$|Although mostly {{occupied}} with Thunderbird 6 and Doppelgänger, Derek Meddings briefly reprised {{his role as}} head of special effects to construct Professor McClaine's Jet Air Car. The design concept was a disappointment to Anderson, who commented: [...] "The car looked like no other <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>hardware</b> we had had previously but I was wary of canning it as I feared I might be becoming stereotyped. Maybe {{the whole thing was}} becoming a bit narrow; all the ideas were becoming similar." [...] Stephen La Rivière, writer of Filmed in Supermarionation: A History of the Future, views the Jet Air Car as an update of Supercar, the vehicle that appeared in Anderson's 1961 series of the same name, but agrees that while the Jet Air Car is the [...] "star vehicle" [...] of Joe 90, it is visually unappealing in comparison to the [...] "beautiful, sleek design of its predecessor." ...|$|E
500|$|GamePro {{considered}} the gun [...] "well-designed" [...] and [...] "fairly good-looking", though they {{wrote that the}} gun's options buttons were inconvenient and that the Menacer's lengthy recalibrations before play sessions without Accu-Sight were tedious. Mean Machines wrote that the gun's shades of gray clashed with the glossy black console. Several reviewers called the binocular scope addition unhelpful. Paul Mellerick of Mega found the manual sights an eyestrain and the gun [...] "deadly accurate" [...] as long as players used the Accu-Sight mode. Still, as of January 1993, Mega felt that the Menacer's future success was doubtless. Jaz of Mean Machines had low expectations for the Menacer, which he compared to the shortcomings of previous light guns: high price, short-lived novelty, and dearth of games. Gus of Mean Machines wrote that [...] "Sega hasn't learned the lessons" [...] from the Super Scope's [...] "fairly naff" [...] release in the magazine's January 1993 Menacer review, calling the light gun a [...] "samey-looking, samey-playing <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>hardware,</b> with some redundant add-ons" [...] with mediocre launch titles. He added that the Menacer was less tiring to use than the Super Scope, praised the Menacer's infrared, and criticized the gun's lack of available software.|$|E
500|$|La Rivière {{argues that}} the use of the Tiger Moth as the star vehicle, and the pun on the Esso promotional banner of [...] "Put a Tiger in Your Tank", are more suited to an adult audience. Meanwhile, {{children}} [...] "had spent the entire 90 minutes eagerly waiting for the most fantastic <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>hardware</b> to arrive. They got an old plane." [...] Thunderbirds historian John Marriott voices similar criticism of the Tiger Moth, writing that [...] "the big screen was an unsuitable place for the gentle irony of steam-age technology scoring triumphantly over an array of fantasy machines." [...] Science-fiction author John Peel is dismissive of the film in general and compares it pessimistically to the [...] "well-made fun" [...] of Thunderbirds Are Go. He summarises it as a [...] "big mistake" [...] and [...] "a feeble last fling for a brilliant series", with a long and illogical plot, poor jokes and little action during the final rescue sequences. Responding to claims that the tone of Thunderbird 6 differs significantly from that of its predecessor, Gerry Anderson maintains that the time that had elapsed since the airing of the final television episode meant that [...] "we were much more aware with the second one that it wasn't just a question of making a longer episode, but it was, indeed, to make something special for the cinema." ...|$|E

500|$|Apart from {{a change}} in musical style, the band changed the way they recorded. [...] "It {{was the first time}} we sort of jammed," [...] Coxon revealed. [...] "We've never really jammed before. We've been quite white-coaty, overall about recording, like in a laboratory. Yeah, we did {{actually}} feel our way through just playing whatever came to our minds and editing, which was really exciting." [...] "We just played together for two weeks in a way we hadn't done since 1991," [...] Dave recalls. [...] "We wanted to purify the sound, to not have anything there not played by us. We reasoned that if we made small changes at the input end, we could effect large changes in the output." [...] According to producer Stephen Street, [...] "Blur had decided that commercial pressures and writing hit singles wasn't going to be the main consideration any more. The mood in the studio was very different to when I'd first worked with them." [...] "In the studio, once we got past those first few days, where I felt everyone was treading on eggshells, there was a great atmosphere. I think it was because they didn't want to be competing with anyone on this record, they wanted to make a record that would help keep the band together." [...] Street had acquired a new <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>hardware,</b> described as [...] "muso-ish to talk about but really useful" [...] which enabled him to sample loops and otherwise cut-and-paste entire sections of the band's jam sessions.|$|E
2500|$|Nintendo has {{integrated}} a gyroscope {{into the}} Wii console's Wii Remote controller by an additional <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>hardware</b> called [...] "Wii MotionPlus". It is {{also included in}} the 3DS and the Wii U GamePad, which detects movement when turning.|$|E
2500|$|According to [...] "Meltdown" [...] (1991), Rimmer's only {{physical}} presence {{is a small}} [...] "light bee"; a <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>hardware</b> which buzzes around and projects his holographic image. This has been contradicted on a few occasions by his ability to move completely through solid objects such as walls or by the ability of solid objects or living characters to pass completely through Rimmer.|$|E
50|$|The new MZC 3000 SmartZone Zone Controller {{introduced}} an Ethernet based connection point for sites, consoles, data broadcast boxes, and C/DIUs.

2500|$|In an interview, Kazuo Hirai, {{chairman}} of Sony Computer Entertainment {{argued for the}} choice of a complex architecture. Hexus Gaming reviewed the PAL version and summed the review up by saying, [...] "as the PlayStation 3 matures and developers start really pushing it, we'll see the PlayStation 3 emerge as the console of choice for gaming." [...] At GDC 2007, Shiny Entertainment founder Dave Perry stated, [...] "I think that Sony has made the best machine. It's the best <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>hardware,</b> without question".|$|E
2500|$|One popular way {{to access}} amateur only {{frequencies}} is to modify an off-the-shelf access point with custom firmware. This custom firmware is freely {{available on the}} Internet from projects such as DD-WRT and OpenWrt. [...] The AREDN Project supports off-the-shelf firmware that supports Part97 only frequencies on Ubiquiti and TP-Link hardware. [...] A popular <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>hardware</b> that is modified is the Linksys WRT54GL because of the widespread availability of both the hardware and third-party firmware, however, the Linksys hardware is not frequency agile due to the closed nature of the Linksys drivers.|$|E
2500|$|APIs such as Direct3D and DirectSound need to {{interact}} with hardware, and they do this through a device driver. [...] Hardware manufacturers have to write these drivers for a particular DirectX version's device driver interface (or DDI), and test each individual <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>hardware</b> to make them DirectX compatible. Some hardware devices have only DirectX compatible drivers (in other words, one must install DirectX {{in order to use}} that hardware). Early versions of DirectX included an up-to-date library of all of the DirectX compatible drivers currently available. This practice was stopped however, in favor of the web-based Windows Update driver-update system, which allowed users to download only the drivers relevant to their hardware, rather than the entire library.|$|E
