40|$|A blue superluminescent LED (SLED) {{with power}} above 100 mW was fabricated. These SLED shows promise for focus-free <b>pico-projection</b> due to reduced {{interference}} and improved image quality. We compared different straight and curved waveguide designs {{with and without}} tilted facets. Internal and mirror losses were determined by the Hakki-Paoli method...|$|E
40|$|Current {{commercial}} pico-projector {{systems are}} mainly {{designed as a}} principal or secondary output for which very few systems have interaction capabilities. Recent research, however, has created <b>pico-projection</b> prototypes with user interfaces tailored to device or application uses. This paper explores different design possibilities for mobile and embedded pico-projectors and identifies how those designs influence the choice of interaction techniques...|$|E
40|$|Small {{and compact}} optical system designs {{are needed in}} nearly all {{application}} scenarios of optical projection and imaging systems, e. g. automotive, metrology, medical or multimedia. Most active optical systems are based on separated imaging (e. g. camera unit) and image generating units (e. g. projection unit). This fact limits the geometrical miniaturization of the system. We present compact optical system designs using the new technology of bi-directional sensor devices. These devices combine light emitting and light detecting elements on one single chip. The application of such innovative opto-electronic devices - so-called bi-directional OLED microdisplays (BiMiDs) - offer a huge potential for miniaturization with a simultaneous increase of performance due to a new integration step. For these new bi-directional sensor devices new optical design concepts for simultaneous and sequential emission and detection are necessary. Because the simultaneous emission and detection can disturb the functionality of the optical system. New concepts has to be applied. A first concept is an exemplary 3 -D metrology system applying fringe projection. A second concept is a <b>pico-projection</b> system with an integrated camera function. For both concepts the system configurations and the optical design are discussed. Due to {{the application of the}} bi-directional sensor device ultra-compact systems are presented...|$|E
40|$|Two <b>pico-projection</b> systems, a {{monochrome}} {{green and}} a full-color system, based on high-efficiency OLED microdisplays (VGA; pixel size, 12 mu m) are presented. Both optical systems are {{described by a}} numerical aperture of about 0. 3, a magnification of 15 x, and a working distance of 300 - 360 mm. The frequency limit of both systems is 42 cycles/mm at an image contrast of about 60 %. The monochrome projection system with a volume smaller than 10 cm(3) consists of one green OLED and a projection lens with five elements. The measured luminance in the image plane is about 0. 061 lm. The image has a diagonal of 150 mm with a working distance of about 300 mm and has a considerable image contrast of 396 : 1. The second system combines three high-brightness OLEDs, red, green, and blue colored, together with a projection lens and an image-combining element, and an X-Cube to achieve full-color projection. The estimated luminance value for the three-panel projection unit with an OLED luminance of 10, 000 cd/m(2) for each display will be about Phi(calculated) = 0. 147 lm. In this paper, the system concepts, the optical designs, and the realized prototypes of the monochrome and full-color projection system are presented...|$|E
