25|$|As more {{information}} about the signal became available, its purpose as a radar signal became increasingly obvious. In particular, its signal contained a clearly recognizable structure in each pulse, which was eventually identified as a 31-bit pseudo-random binary sequence, with a bit-width of 100 μs resulting in a 3.1 ms pulse. This sequence is usable for a 100μs chirped pulse amplification system, giving a resolution of 15km (10mi) (the distance light travels in 50μs). When a second Woodpecker appeared, this one located in eastern Russia but also <b>pointed</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> US and covering blank spots in the first system's pattern, this conclusion became inescapable.|$|E
25|$|In 2009, the San Martinian Society {{requested}} to fence the monument {{after it was}} repeatedly vandalized. The request was dismissed by the city council, that considered that it would affect the aesthetics of the monument. In 2012, the municipal government of Neuquén made renewals on the monument. The Public Buildings and Transit Secretariat replaced the quicklime tiles of the roundabout for porphyr ones, that formed a sun-and-star shape. The National University of Comahue {{was in charge of}} the new illumination of the monument. On each of the twelve pointers of the star, metal cilynders were built to house lights that <b>pointed</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> pedestal. Additional reflectors were placed on the top of the base to illuminate the statue.|$|E
25|$|In 1948 Pauling {{discovered}} that many proteins included helical (see alpha helix) shapes. Pauling had deduced this structure from X-ray patterns and from attempts to physically model the structures. (Pauling was also later to suggest an incorrect three chain helical DNA structure based on Astbury's data.) Even {{in the initial}} diffraction data from DNA by Maurice Wilkins, {{it was evident that}} the structure involved helices. But this insight was only a beginning. There remained the questions of how many strands came together, whether this number was the same for every helix, whether the bases <b>pointed</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> helical axis or away, and ultimately what were the explicit angles and coordinates of all the bonds and atoms. Such questions motivated the modeling efforts of Watson and Crick.|$|E

He was assigned to No. 27 Squadron. They were the sole squadron equipped with the Martinsyde G.100, commonly called the Elephant. This aircraft was nicknamed for being large and ungainly. A single seater, it was too big, slow, and manoeuvrable {{to be a successful}} fighter, and without a rear gunner, too defenceless to survive well in a ground attack or bombing role. It was equipped with a Lewis machine gun mounted on the upper wing firing over the propeller, and a second one on the fuselage <b>pointed</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> rear.|$|E
25|$|The closest {{approach}} of the New Horizons spacecraft to Pluto occurred at 11:49 UTC on July 14, 2015 at a range of 7,750 miles (12,472km) from the surface and 8,487 miles (13,658km) {{from the center of}} Pluto. Telemetry data confirming a successful flyby and a healthy spacecraft were received on Earth from the vicinity of the Pluto system on July 15, 2015, 00:52:37 UTC, after 22 hours of planned radio silence due to the spacecraft being <b>pointed</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> Pluto system. Mission managers estimated a one in 10,000 chance that debris could have destroyed it during the flyby, preventing it from sending science data to Earth. The first details of the encounter were received the next day, but the download of the complete data set took just over 15 months, and analysis of the data will take longer.|$|E
25|$|The {{so-called}} long-duration gamma-ray bursts {{produce a}} total energy output of about 1044 joules (as much energy as our Sun will produce in its entire life-time) {{but in a}} period of only 20 to 40 seconds. Gamma rays are approximately 50% of the total energy output. The leading hypotheses for the mechanism of production of these highest-known intensity beams of radiation, are inverse Compton scattering and synchrotron radiation from high-energy charged particles. These processes occur as relativistic charged particles leave the region of the event horizon of a newly formed black hole created during supernova explosion. The beam of particles moving at relativistic speeds are focused for a few tens of seconds by the magnetic field of the exploding hypernova. The fusion explosion of the hypernova drives the energetics of the process. If the narrowly directed beam happens to be <b>pointed</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> Earth, it shines at gamma ray frequencies with such intensity, that it can be detected even at distances of up to 10 billion light years, which is close {{to the edge of the}} visible universe.|$|E

25|$|Although quasars appear faint {{when viewed}} from Earth, they are visible from extreme distances, being the most {{luminous}} objects in the known universe. The brightest quasar in the sky is 3C273 in the constellation of Virgo. It has an average apparent magnitude of 12.8 (bright enough to be seen through a medium-size amateur telescope), but it has an absolute magnitude of −26.7. From {{a distance of about}} 33 light-years, this object would shine in the sky about as brightly as our sun. This quasar's luminosity is, therefore, about 4 trillion (4 × 1012) times that of the Sun, or about 100 times that of the total light of giant galaxies like the Milky Way. This assumes the quasar is radiating energy in all directions, but the active galactic nucleus is believed to be radiating preferentially in the direction of its jet. In a universe containing hundreds of billions of galaxies, most of which had active nuclei billions of years ago but only seen today, it is statistically certain that thousands of energy jets should be <b>pointed</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> Earth, some more directly than others. In many cases {{it is likely that the}} brighter the quasar, the more directly its jet is aimed at the Earth.|$|E

Hani Hanjour advanced the throttles to maximum power and dived toward the Pentagon. While level above the ground and seconds from the crash, the wings knocked over five street lampposts and the right wing struck a portable generator, creating a smoke trail seconds before smashing into the Pentagon. Flight77, flying at 530mph (853km/h, 237m/s, or 460 knots) over the Navy Annex Building adjacent to Arlington National Cemetery, crashed into the western side of the Pentagon in Arlington County, Virginia, just south of Washington, D.C., at 09:37:46. The plane hit the Pentagon at the first-floor level, and at the moment of impact, the airplane was rolled slightly to the left, with the right wing elevated. The front part of the fuselage disintegrated on impact, while the mid and tail sections moved for another fraction of a second, with tail section debris penetrating furthest into the building. In all, the airplane took eight-tenths of a second to fully penetrate [...] into the three outermost of the building's five rings and unleashed a fireball that rose [...] above the building.|$|E

The placing of the body {{on the ground is}} a doublet of birth ritual, when the infant was placed on the bare earth.

2500|$|Apuleius (c.125–c.185) {{managed to}} thrive in the {{professional}} and literary communities of Latin-speaking Carthage. A full Berber (Numidian and Gaetulian) of Madaura whose father was a provincial magistrate, he studied at Carthage, and later at Athens (philosophy) and at Rome (oratory), where he evidently served as a legal advocate. He also traveled to Asia Minor and Egypt. Returning to Cathage he married an older, wealthy widow; he then was prosecuted for using magic to gain her affections. His speech in defense makes up his Apology; apparently he was acquitted. His celebrated work Metamorphosus, or the Golden Ass is an urbane, extravagant, inventive novel of the ancient world. at Carthage he wrote philosophy, rhetoric, and poetry; several statues were erected in his honor. St. Augustine discusses Apuleius in his The City of God. Apuleius used a Latin style at registered as [...] "New Speech" [...] recognized by his literary contemporaries. It expressed the everyday language used by the educated, along with embedded archaisms, which transformed the more formal, classical grammar favored by Cicero (106–43), and <b>pointed</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> development of modern Romance idioms.
