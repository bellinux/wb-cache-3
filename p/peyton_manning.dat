5|$|<b>Peyton</b> <b>Manning</b> and Leaf {{were widely}} {{considered}} {{the two best}} players available in the 1998 draft, and scouts and analysts debated who should be selected first. Many favored Leaf's stronger arm and greater potential, while others deemed Manning the more mature player and the safer pick. Most observers, however, believed {{that it would not}} greatly matter whether Manning or Leaf was drafted first because either would greatly benefit his team.|$|E

5|$|The game {{kicked off}} at 8:00 PM. From the start, Tennessee's high-scoring offense dominated. The Volunteers scored two {{touchdown}}s {{in the first quarter}} and three in the second, while Virginia Tech was able to muster a lone touchdown and field goal in the second quarter. At halftime, Tennessee had a commanding 3510 lead, behind the strong play of Freshman QB <b>Peyton</b> <b>Manning.</b>|$|E
5|$|After the Colts owner Jim Irsay hired Tony Dungy in 2002, the Colts {{made the}} playoffs for nine {{straight}} seasons. They won five straight AFC South titles from 2003 to 2007 and had seven consecutive seasons of 12 or more victories from 2003 to 2009, {{the first time that}} has been achieved in the NFL's 90-year history. Much of the team's success throughout the 2000s was attributed to the trio of general manager Bill Polian, coach Dungy, and quarterback <b>Peyton</b> <b>Manning.</b>|$|E
5|$|On March 11, 2016, Sanchez {{was traded}} to the Denver Broncos for a 2017 {{conditional}} draft pick. Prior to his arrival to the Broncos, <b>Peyton</b> <b>Manning</b> had retired and Brock Osweiler had signed with the Houston Texans. This opened up a competition for the Broncos starting quarterback job between Sanchez, second-year player Trevor Siemian and rookie Paxton Lynch. On August 29, Broncos head coach Gary Kubiak named Siemian the starting quarterback for the 2016 season. On September 3, 2016, Sanchez was released by the team.|$|E

5|$|Though Stewart {{was named}} the most {{valuable}} player for the Volunteers, multiple Tennessee players had statistically significant games. Volunteer quarterback <b>Peyton</b> <b>Manning</b> finished the game having completed 12 of his 19 pass attempts for 189 yards, one touchdown, and one interception. Backup Tennessee quarterback Brandon Stewart completed all three of his pass attempts, accumulating 49 yards in the process. Tennessee receiver Joey Kent was the primary beneficiary of the Volunteer passing attack, leading all receivers during the game with six receptions for 116 yards. Tennessee's passing touchdowns went to Kendrick Jones, who also had 37 receiving yards and 76 rushing yards; and Marcus Nash, who caught three passes for 54 yards.|$|E
5|$|Tittle was {{the fourth}} player to throw seven {{touchdown}} passes in a game, when he did so in 1962 against the Redskins. He followed Sid Luckman (1943), Adrian Burk (1954), and George Blanda (1961). The feat has since been equaled by four more players: Joe Kapp (1969), <b>Peyton</b> <b>Manning</b> (2013), Nick Foles (2013), and Drew Brees (2015). Tittle, Manning and Foles did it without an interception. His 36 touchdown passes in 1963 set a record which stood for over two decades until it was surpassed by Dan Marino in 1984; as of 2016 it remains a Giants franchise record.|$|E
5|$|After Leaf threw four {{interceptions in}} the first half against the New York Giants in the Week 4 game (September 28), coach Kevin Gilbride benched Leaf in favor of Craig Whelihan. The {{following}} game on October 4 against the Indianapolis Colts matched Leaf against the number one 1998 draft pick <b>Peyton</b> <b>Manning.</b> Indianapolis won 17–12, as both quarterbacks completed 12 of 23 passes with an interception each, but Leaf threw for 160 yards (23 more than Manning), and only Manning threw a touchdown. Manning was never sacked; Leaf was sacked four times. Inside the final two minutes and San Diego down 14–6, Leaf's 56-yard pass to Charlie Jones set up a one-yard Natrone Means touchdown run, but Leaf's potential tying two-point conversion pass to Webster Slaughter was incomplete.|$|E

5|$|In {{the first}} Super Bowl played in rainy conditions, the Colts overcame a 14–6 first-quarter deficit to outscore the Bears 23–3 {{in the last}} three quarters. Chicago posted the then-earliest lead in Super Bowl history when {{returner}} Devin Hester ran back the opening kickoff 92 yards for a touchdown after 14 seconds had elapsed (a record later broken in Super Bowl XLVIII when the Seattle Seahawks scored a safety 12 seconds into the game). The Colts forced five turnovers, including cornerback Kelvin Hayden's 56-yard interception return for a touchdown. Indianapolis kicker Adam Vinatieri also scored three field goals. Colts quarterback <b>Peyton</b> <b>Manning</b> was named the game's Most Valuable Player (MVP), completing 25 of 38 passes for 247yards and a touchdown, with one interception for a passer rating of 81.8.|$|E
5|$|On November 4, 2007, {{after the}} Packers {{defeated}} the Kansas City Chiefs 33–22, Favre became {{only the third}} quarterback to have defeated all thirty-one other current NFL teams. He joined <b>Peyton</b> <b>Manning</b> and Tom Brady as the only quarterbacks in NFL history to do this, just the week after {{the two of them}} achieved the accomplishment. On Thanksgiving 2007, Favre led the Packers to a 37–26 win over the Lions, and brought the Packers to a 10–1 record. He won the Galloping Gobbler award, given by the broadcasters at Fox to the game's MVP. Favre threw three touchdown passes for his 63rd career game with at least three touchdowns, surpassing Marino's former record of 62.|$|E
5|$|Players {{are often}} awarded after record-breaking or near-record-breaking {{offensive}} seasons. Running back O. J. Simpson won {{the award for}} 1973 after rushing for a record 2,003 yards, becoming the first NFL player to rush for 2,000 yards in a season. When his record was broken by Eric Dickerson in 1984, Dickerson placed second in voting behind quarterback Dan Marino, who that year {{was the first to}} pass for 5,000 yards in a season. Marino's 5,084 yards stood as the record for 27 years before being broken by Drew Brees in 2011, who won that season's award. In turn, 2013 winner <b>Peyton</b> <b>Manning</b> set league single-season records for passing yards (5,477) and passing touchdowns (55).|$|E

5|$|Virginia Tech's kickoff was {{returned}} to the Tennessee 26-yard line, and the Volunteers' offense returned to the field. Instead of <b>Peyton</b> <b>Manning,</b> backup quarterback Branndon Stewart came on the field to lead Tennessee. On the second play of the Tennessee drive, Stewart gained 24 yards on a quarterback scramble, giving the Volunteers a first down at the Tennessee 49-yard line. On the next play, he completed a 27-yard pass to Kent for another first down. Two plays later, James Stewart broke free for an 18-yard run that gave Tennessee a first down at the Virginia Tech one-yard line. One play later, Stewart crossed the goal line for Tennessee's second touchdown of the quarter. The extra point was good, and Tennessee's lead was again 21 points, 287, with 3:22 remaining in the quarter.|$|E
5|$|Even {{though the}} two clubs were placed in {{separate}} divisions in the NFL's 2002 divisional realignment, their rivalry did not diminish. At that time, both teams were {{among the best in}} the AFC, and both were led by likely Hall of Fame quarterbacks, <b>Peyton</b> <b>Manning</b> (for the Colts) and Tom Brady (for the Patriots) The teams met three times in four years (2003, 2004, 2006) in the playoffs, with the winner going on to win that season's Super Bowl each time. The Manning portion of the rivalry began in Manning's rookie season, 1998; in 1999 Manning suffered a bitter 31–28 loss in September as the Patriots behind Drew Bledsoe erased a 28–7 Colts lead, then defeated the Patriots 20–15 in Indianapolis on December 12. The Brady–Manning portion of the rivalry began on September 30, 2001, as Brady made his first NFL start in a 44–13 Patriots win at Foxboro; on October 21 the Patriots defeated the Colts at the RCA Dome 38–17.|$|E
50|$|The 104th {{meeting of}} the two schools took place at Lafayette College’s Fisher Field on April 26, 2009.

Politicians Ed and David Miliband are likewise portrayed as having a strained relationship.|$|R
5|$|Tennessee {{was ranked}} No. 13 in the Associated Press preseason poll {{at the start}} of the season, but won just one game in its first four of the season, causing the Volunteers to drop out of the top 25 for the first time since 1989, {{breaking}} a streak of 84 consecutive weeks in the poll. To make matters worse, Tennessee's two starting quarterbacks suffered season-ending injuries during that four-game span. In the Volunteers' season-opener against UCLA, Jerry Colquitt suffered a knee injury. Backup quarterback Todd Helton was hurt in the fourth game of the season, a loss to Mississippi State. In response to the poor start, Fulmer overhauled his defense and coped with the loss of his first- and second-string quarterbacks by bringing in acclaimed freshman <b>Peyton</b> <b>Manning,</b> son of National Football League star Archie Manning.|$|E
5|$|The Tennessee {{offense was}} led by {{freshman}} quarterback <b>Peyton</b> <b>Manning,</b> son of NFL great Archie Manning, who had played against the Hokies in the 1968 Liberty Bowl. During the regular season, Peyton played in seven games, winning six of them and completing 86 of his 139 pass attempts for 1,114 yards, 11 touchdowns, and six interceptions. Manning's passer rating of 145.2 was the third-highest among starting quarterbacks in the SEC. In recognition of his achievements, Manning was named the Southeastern Conference Freshman of the Year. One of Manning's more prominent passing targets was Billy Williams, who, despite suffering a stress fracture {{in the first game}} of the season, recovered to catch 20 passes for 217 yards and two touchdowns. He also returned 17 kickoffs for an average of 20.8 yards per return. Manning's favorite target was Joey Kent, who caught 36 passes for 470 yards during the regular season, but slightly injured his ankle in a pre-Gator Bowl practice.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} {{is a list of}} Grossman's statistics from his regular and postseason games. Grossman has occasionally recorded notable statistics; among all quarterbacks during the 2006 season, Grossman ranked tenth in number of pass attempts, seventh in touchdowns thrown, and third in interceptions. He completed his first full season with a 73.9 quarterback rating. This was better than quarterback ratings of Favre, <b>Peyton</b> <b>Manning,</b> and Terry Bradshaw during their first full seasons; many other quarterbacks have performed similarly or better in their first years, including Grossman's former backup Brian Griese. His twenty-three touchdowns in one season rank Grossman among the best Bears quarterbacks in franchise history. However, his twenty interceptions in one season are among the most thrown by any Bears’ quarterback in almost two decades. The unusual combination ranked Grossman as statistically the most inconsistent quarterback in almost a decade in 2006.|$|E
