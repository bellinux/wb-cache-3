5|$|Titania orbits Uranus at the {{distance}} of about , being the second farthest from the planet among its five major moons. Titania's orbit has a small eccentricity and is inclined very little relative to the equator of Uranus. Its orbital period is around 8.7 days, coincident with its rotational period. In other words, Titania is a synchronous or tidally locked satellite, with one face always <b>pointing</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> planet.|$|E
5|$|Jamal, Muhammad, the Associated Press cameraman, and Shams Oudeh, the Reuters cameraman, took cover {{against the}} {{concrete}} {{wall in the}} south-east quadrant of the crossroads, diagonally across from the Israeli outpost. Jamal, Muhammad and Shams Oudeh crouched behind a three-foot-tall (0.91 m) concrete drum, apparently part of a culvert, that was sitting against the wall. A thick paving stone sat {{on top of the}} drum, which offered further protection. Abu Rahma hid behind a white minibus parked across the road about 15metres away from the wall. The Reuters and Associated Press cameramen briefly filmed over Jamal and Muhammad's shoulders—the cameras <b>pointing</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> Israeli outpost—before the men moved away. Jamal and Muhammad did not move away, but stayed behind the drum for 45 minutes. In Enderlin's view, they were frozen in fear.|$|E
5|$|Oberon orbits Uranus at a {{distance}} of about 584,000km, being the farthest from the planet among its five major moons. Oberon's orbit has a small orbital eccentricity and inclination relative to the equator of Uranus. Its orbital period is around 13.5days, coincident with its rotational period. In other words, Oberon is a synchronous satellite, tidally locked, with one face always <b>pointing</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> planet. Oberon spends a significant part of its orbit outside the Uranian magnetosphere. As a result, its surface is directly struck by the solar wind. This is important, because the trailing hemispheres of satellites orbiting inside a magnetosphere are struck by the magnetospheric plasma, which co–rotates with the planet. This bombardment may lead to the darkening of the trailing hemispheres, which is actually observed for all Uranian moons except Oberon (see below).|$|E

25|$|Early in the period, {{hair was}} worn collar-length and brushed {{back from the}} forehead; very fashionable men wore a single long strand of hair called a lovelock over one shoulder.

While in Theravada Buddhism this is the Noble Eightfold Path, in Mahayana Buddhism this is the Bodhisattva path, striving to liberation for all sentient beings. In Tibetan Buddhism, this is Lamrim, which details all the stages on the path, while Zen has its own complicated history of the entanglement of meditation practice and direct insight.|$|E

25|$|In 2010, a team informally {{dubbed the}} Andrew Irvine Search Committee led by American Everest {{historian}} Tom Holzel conducted a new photographic search for Irvine using a computer-assembled montage of aerial photographs taken in 1984 by Brad Washburn and the National Geographic Society. This search {{led to the}} identification of a possible object at about 8,425 metres, less than 100 m from the ice-axe location, {{which is consistent with}} an identification of that of a body lying in a slot of rock, feet <b>pointing</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> summit, just as Xu described his sighting.|$|E
25|$|The {{content of}} the {{triangular}} tablet reiterates triplicity. It depicts three crowned goddesses, each with her head pointing at an angle and her feet <b>pointing</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> center. The name of the goddess appears above her head: Dione (ΔΙΟΝΗ), Phoebe (ΦΟΙΒΙΗ), and the obscure Nyche (ΝΥΧΙΗ). Amibousa, a word referring to the phases of the moon, is written under each goddess's feet. Densely inscribed spells frame each goddess: the inscriptions around Dione and Nyche are voces magicae, incantatory syllables ("magic words") that are mostly untranslatable. Melinoë appears in a triple invocation {{that is part of}} the inscription around Phoebe: O Persephone, O Melinoë, O Leucophryne. Esoteric symbols are inscribed on the edges of the triangle.|$|E
25|$|Expert ESA {{personnel}} were immediately dispatched from Europe to the United States to direct operations. Days passed without contact from SOHO. On July 23, the Arecibo Observatory and Goldstone Solar System Radar combined to locate SOHO with radar, {{and to determine}} its location and attitude. SOHO was close to its predicted position, oriented with its side versus the usual front Optical Surface Reflector panel <b>pointing</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> Sun, and was rotating at one revolutions every 53 seconds. Once SOHO was located, plans for contacting SOHO were formed. On August 3 a carrier was detected from SOHO, the first signal since June 25. After days of charging the battery, a successful {{attempt was made to}} modulate the carrier and downlink telemetry on August 8. After instrument temperatures were downlinked on August 9, data analysis was performed, and planning for the SOHO recovery began in earnest.|$|E

25|$|Johnson {{designed}} a two-story portico with five arches that faced east toward the city’s skyline. The arches and their tapered support columns were clad in creamy Texas shellstone. The remaining three {{sides of the}} 20,000-square-foot building were also covered with shellstone cladding. Sheltered by the arched portico, the museum's front wall consisted of a two-story curtain of glass windows with bronze mullions. The main entrance lead directly into a two-story hall adorned with {{the same type of}} shellstone used on the exterior, teak wall coverings, and a floor of pink and gray granite. Beyond the main hall were five small galleries of equal size for the display of art. On the mezzanine level were five similar galleries, each with a balcony that overlooked the main hall. These mezzanine galleries served as library and office spaces. To take advantage of the expanse between the two-story portico and the site’s eastern boundary, Johnson {{designed a}} series of broad steps and terraces extending away from the building, with an expansive sunken, grassy plaza as the centerpiece, <b>pointing</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> city’s center.|$|E

500|$|When {{phospholipids}} {{are exposed}} to water, they self-assemble into a two-layered sheet with the hydrophobic tails <b>pointing</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> center of the sheet. This arrangement results in two “leaflets” that are each a single molecular layer. [...] The center of this bilayer contains almost no water and excludes molecules like sugars or salts that dissolve in water. The assembly process is driven by interactions between hydrophobic molecules (also called the hydrophobic effect). [...] An increase in interactions between hydrophobic molecules (causing clustering of hydrophobic regions) allows water molecules to bond more freely with each other, increasing the entropy of the system. This complex process includes non-covalent interactions such as van der Waals forces, electrostatic and hydrogen bonds.|$|E

The lower pinnae have a distinct lobe or auricle <b>pointing</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> blade tip. The dark color of the stipe extends some distance into the rachis (leaf axis), the rest of which is flat and green. The leaf tissue has a somewhat papery texture.|$|E
