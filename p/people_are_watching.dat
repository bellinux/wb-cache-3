500|$|It was renewed for a {{third season}} on March 6, 2010. As part of a {{reorganization}} of its 2010 midseason line up to capture more market for American Idol, the Fox network shifted Fringe to 9:00p.m. on Fridays. [...] This timeslot, commonly considered the [...] "Friday night death slot" [...] for several previous Fox shows due to cancellation shortly following the move to that slot, left critics considering the show's fate. [...] While The X-Files originally premiered during this slot and {{would continue to be}} a highly successful series, critics were unsure if Fringe could duplicate this performance. [...] In this slot, the show competed with Supernatural, a series that attracts similar types of viewers. Fox's Entertainment President Kevin Reilly, in response to these concerns, stated that 45% of Fringes viewership is from time shifting recording through digital video receivers, and does not expect the viewership numbers to change significantly with the change to Friday. Reilly further postulated that [...] "If it does anywhere near what it did on Thursdays, we can glue that show to the schedule because it can be a big win for us". Further promoted by the critical reaction to the rescheduling, the Fox network created a self-deprecating promotional advertisement acknowledging the reputation of the time slot, including quotes from other media outlets concerned about the move, but asserted that the move would [...] "re-animate" [...] the show. The network also created a music video, set to [...] "Echoes" [...] by the band Klaxons as a means of summarizing the third season to date prior to the first Friday broadcast. Joshua Jackson, who plays Peter Bishop on the show, cautioned that time-shifted viewership {{may not be enough to}} save the show: [...] "It's not that not enough <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>watching</b> Fringe, it's that not enough <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>watching</b> Fringe during the hour that it's on the air, which is key for the network." ...|$|E

But I didn't know I had a choice. I would sit in rehearsals and sing full songs a cappella. I wasn't Beyoncé, but I wasn't fucking up. Then I got out there and was like, 'Oh my God, millions of <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>watching</b> me right now. I have stage fright.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|At {{the bronze}} medal game, Lithuanians faced the Unified Team {{for the third}} time that year, with each team winning once. Captain Valdemaras Chomičius felt that [...] "We lost to them once already, we couldn't let that happen again. The final had to be ours", while Šarūnas Marčiulionis added that [...] "We didn't have any choice, we {{absolutely}} had to win at any cost". Head coach Vladas Garastas briefed the team saying [...] "Men, you're playing for the people of Lithuania.

Šarūnas Marčiulionis: [...] "Some were listening on radios, others were watching on television. All of Lithuania was stopped. Everyone was watching that game". In a close match, the Lithuanians kept the lead all times for an 82–78 victory, that felt inexpressibly remarkable for a tiny country which regained its independence just two years and was playing the remains of its former colonizer.
