25|$|The USAF Weapons School Robbie Risner Award, created September 24, 1976, was {{donated by}} H. Ross Perot {{as a tribute}} to Risner and all Vietnam era Prisoners of War, and is {{administered}} by the Tactical Air Command (now by Air Combat Command). The award is presented annually to the outstanding graduate of the USAF Weapons School. The Risner Award is a six and one-half foot trophy consisting of a sculpture of Risner in flight suit and helmet on a marble base, weighing approximately four tons. The trophy is permanently displayed at the United States Air Force Academy, with each winner’s name inscribed. A miniature replica, also donated by <b>Perot,</b> <b>is</b> presented to each year’s recipient as a personal memento. An identical casting, measuring four feet and weighing 300 pounds, was installed in the foyer of the USAF Weapons School at Nellis Air Force Base in October 1984.|$|E
2500|$|In May 2010, H. Ross Perot, Jr., who {{retained}} 5% ownership, filed {{a lawsuit}} against Cuban, alleging the franchise was insolvent or in imminent danger of insolvency. In June 2010, Cuban responded in a court filing maintaining <b>Perot</b> <b>is</b> wrongly seeking money to offset some $100million in losses on the Victory Park real estate development. [...] The lawsuit was dismissed in 2011, due in part to Cuban asserting proper management of the team due to its recent victory in the 2011 NBA Finals. [...] In 2014, the 5th Circuit Court affirmed that decision on appeal. [...] Following his initial defeat, Perot attempted to shut out Mavericks fans from use of the parking lots he controlled near the American Airlines Center.|$|E
5000|$|In the 1992 presidential election, {{independent}} candidate Ross Perot repeatedly accused the Republicans of [...] "dirty tricks" [...] and spying on him, but Republicans dismissed Perot's accusations as a [...] "paranoid fantasy." [...] At the time, David Tell, {{who headed the}} O.R.G. at the time said, [...] "Mr. <b>Perot</b> <b>is</b> suggesting we are sitting {{here in the middle}} of this great spider web, calling newspaper reporters and planting these things, and that is baloney." ...|$|E

50|$|Perot has {{expanded}} his family's fortune primarily through {{real estate and}} serves as chairman of The Perot Group, which manages the various Perot family interests that include real estate, oil and gas, and financial investments. He {{is well known for}} his 1980s development and ownership of the Fort Worth Alliance Airport and the residential community of Heritage, which is a successful development executed by the public-private partnership Alliance Texas. <b>Perot</b> <b>is</b> also Chairman of Hillwood, which he founded in 1988. Hillwood is ranked among the top ten real estate developers in the United States and is recognized for its high-profile projects and public-private ventures.|$|E
50|$|Sometimes Fabry-Pérot interferometers {{have to be}} {{adjusted}} in length to pass a given wavelength. Therefore, the reflected light is extracted {{by means of a}} Faraday rotator and a polarizer. Small changes of the incident wavelength generated by an acousto-optic modulator or interference with a fraction of the incoming radiation delivers the information whether the Fabry <b>Perot</b> <b>is</b> too long or to short. Long optical cavities are very sensitive to the mirror alignment. A control circuit can be used to peak power. One possibility is to perform small rotations with one end mirror. If this rotation is about the optimum position, no power oscillation occurs. Any beam pointing oscillation can be removed using the beam steering mechanism mentioned above.|$|E

40|$|Ross Perot. The billionaire. The presidential candidate. The man {{who made}} three {{references}} to the Tooth Fairy and the Easter Bunny in a recent debate with the Vice President. However one chooses to think of him, Ross <b>Perot</b> <b>is</b> an amazing individual. He simply did not exist as a national political figure two years ago. Yet his simple, down-to-earth approach to economics and government ("just plain talk"), his successful business background, and his stated desire to "do what's right for my country" landed him nearly 20 million votes in last year's presidential election — 19 {{percent of the electorate}} — without the support of any major party (Fineman 34). A year later he remains the most potent political force in the United States outside the Beltway. This kind of popularity by a single, independent individual is unusual, to say the least. But contrary to Perot's own often used expression, it's just not that simple. Ross <b>Perot</b> <b>is</b> a skilled political operator, to be sure, but there are larger social, political, and economic forces sustaining his popularity. White House pollster Stan Greenberg is right when he says that <b>Perot</b> <b>is</b> largely a creation of the voters. The Texas billionaire has reached his current level of popularity because the public is dissatisfied with the nation's leadership. " [...] from page...|$|E

25|$|Several {{months before}} the Democratic and Republican conventions, Perot filled the vacuum of {{election}} news, as his supporters began petition drives to {{get him on the}} ballot in all 50 states. This sense of momentum <b>was</b> reinforced when <b>Perot</b> employed two savvy campaign managers in Democrat Hamilton Jordan and Republican Ed Rollins. In July, while <b>Perot</b> <b>was</b> pondering whether to run for office, his supporters established a campaign organization United We Stand America. <b>Perot</b> <b>was</b> late in making formal policy proposals, but most of what he did call for were intended to reduce the deficit, such as a gasoline tax increase and cutbacks to Social Security.|$|R
50|$|<b>Perot</b> <b>was</b> {{born and}} raised in Dallas, the son of Margot (Birmingham) and Ross Perot. He {{graduated}} from St. Mark's School of Texas in 1977. After graduating from Vanderbilt University, he served in the United States Air Force for eight and a half years.|$|R

25|$|<b>Perot</b> <b>was</b> born in Texarkana, Texas, {{the son of}} Lula May Perot (née Ray) and Gabriel Ross Perot, a {{commodity}} broker specializing in cotton contracts. His patrilineal line traces back to an immigrant to Louisiana, in the 1740s. He attended a private school called Patty Hill. He graduated from Texas High School in Texarkana in 1947. One of <b>Perot's</b> boyhood friends <b>was</b> Hayes McClerkin, later Speaker of the Arkansas House of Representatives and a prominent Texarkana, Arkansas, lawyer.|$|R
5000|$|Despite {{legal action}} by the Perot team, and an 80% {{majority}} of Americans supporting his participation in the debates, the Commission refused to budge and <b>Perot</b> <b>was</b> reduced to making his points heard via a series of half-hour [...] "commercials". In the end, Perot and Choate won 8% of the vote.|$|R

2500|$|Based on his {{performance}} in the popular vote in 1992, <b>Perot</b> <b>was</b> entitled to receive federal election funding for 1996. Perot remained {{in the public eye}} after the election and championed opposition to the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), urging voters to listen for the [...] "giant sucking sound" [...] of American jobs heading south to Mexico should NAFTA be ratified.|$|R
5000|$|A Gallup {{poll showed}} Perot with a slim lead, but on July 19 he {{suspended}} his campaign, accusing Republican operatives of threatening to sabotage his daughter's wedding. He was accused by Newsweek {{of being a}} [...] "quitter" [...] in a well-publicized cover-page article. After resuming his campaign on October 1, <b>Perot</b> <b>was</b> dogged by the [...] "quitter" [...] moniker and other allegations concerning his character. On Election Day many voters were confused as to whether <b>Perot</b> <b>was</b> actually still a candidate. He ended up receiving about 18.9% of the popular vote, a record level of popularity not seen in an independent candidacy since former President Theodore Roosevelt ran on the [...] "Bull Moose" [...] Progressive Party ticket in 1912. He continued being politically involved after the election, turning his campaign organization (United We Stand America) into a lobbying group. One of his primary goals was {{the defeat of the}} North American Free Trade Agreement during this period.|$|R
25|$|Perot did {{not seek}} public office again after 1996 and did not enter the 2000 Reform Party presidential primaries. He {{endorsed}} Republican George W. Bush over Reform nominee Pat Buchanan in the 2000 election, and supported Republican Mitt Romney in 2008 and 2012. In 2009, Dell acquired Perot Systems for $3.9 billion. According to Forbes, <b>Perot</b> <b>was</b> the 129th-richest person in the United States in 2015.|$|R
500|$|<b>Perot</b> <b>was</b> a hawk on the Vietnam War, an {{advocate}} for Americans held as prisoner of war and a supporter for their families. During the war, he aided soldiers by providing supplies and holding rallies for those returning home. In public affairs, he led the Texas War on Drugs Committee in 1979 {{at the behest of}} Republican Governor Bill Clements, and was put in charge of the Select Committee on Public Education in 1983 by Democratic Governor Mark White. Perot's most dear political effort involved the Vietnam War POW/MIA issue. He worked extensively to free soldiers that he believed had been left behind, and even engaged in secret diplomatic talks with the Vietnamese government, to the chagrin of the Reagan White House. <b>Perot</b> had <b>been</b> supportive of President Ronald Reagan and labeled him as a [...] "great president" [...] in 1986. He even pledged $2.5 million to support his presidential library, but the relationship soured after <b>Perot</b> <b>was</b> sent on a trip to Hanoi, and determined afterwards that the administration was not taking the POW/MIA issue seriously. He revoked his pledge to the library in 1987, based on the POW/MIA issue as well as his disillusionment from the administration's actions during the Iran–Contra affair. He became a critic of the George H. W. Bush administration, and opposed the 1991 Gulf War.|$|R
2500|$|Perot's {{candidacy}} received increasing {{media attention}} when the competitive {{phase of the}} primary season ended for the two major parties. With the insurgent candidacies of Republican Pat Buchanan and Democrat Jerry Brown winding down, <b>Perot</b> <b>was</b> the natural beneficiary of populist resentment toward establishment politicians.

50|$|Debates {{in other}} {{state and federal}} {{elections}} often exclude Independent and third party candidates, and the Supreme Court has upheld such tactics in several cases.
