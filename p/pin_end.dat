5000|$|The {{starting}} line often has a bias {{to the port}} end (the left end as one looks up the course towards the top mark) of 5 to 10 degrees towards the top mark from what the start line would be if it was straight across the wind direction. This bias encourages competitors {{to move to the}} <b>pin</b> <b>end</b> of the line as it is further up the wind towards the top mark. It also provides [...] "cleaner" [...] air to competitors on the port end of the line. With many competitors moving to the pin or port end of the line to be further to windward, there is room for the other competitors to form up along the line, and although they may be further down the wind from the top mark, they are more easily able to tack onto port tack should the wind shift or to get clear air. If there is no bias favouring the <b>pin</b> <b>end,</b> or more particularly if the starboard (committee boat) end is favoured (further to windward), competitors will be encouraged to avoid being on the line away from the committee boat and so the committee boat area becomes very congested and most competitors are not on the start line and do not start until some time after the starting signal as they have been queued up in the area to starboard of the starboard end of the line. Boats generally approach the {{starting line}} on starboard tack to maintain right of way over boats on port tack.|$|E

30|$|The {{mechanism}} of splitting of timber loaded parallel to grain {{is not clear}} {{and it is difficult}} to evaluate the splitting strength. In this research, splitting tests on Japanese cedar and Douglas fir were conducted to clarify splitting strength. A monotonic tensile force was applied to a drift-pinned joint with steel side plates and splitting failure originated from the pin hole. In order to evaluate the splitting strength, specimens with various parameters, i.e., diameter of drift <b>pin,</b> <b>end</b> margin, edge margin and thickness were used. All parameters affected the splitting strength, but particularly, end margin and thickness also affected the failure mode. As the end margin lengthened, the failure mode was transferred from shear to splitting. On the other hand, as thickness increased, the drift pin bent more at splitting. This bending of the drift pin caused a lag of bearing stress to timber, and the failure mode was transferred from full width splitting to partial width splitting. The splitting strength under various conditions could be evaluated by consideration of the difference in failure modes.|$|E

The unmodified system had an alignment within that permitted by the ASTM G 99 - 95 a standard.

40|$|Transfixation casting is {{a method}} of {{managing}} distal limb fractures in the horse. It has similarities to external skeletal fixation {{including the use of}} transcortical pins and the complications that occur as a result of concentrated stresses at the bone-pin interface. Currently, the major challenges facing equine surgeons when using a transfixation cast are pin loosening, secondary pin hole fracture and excessive stress reduction distal to the transcortical pins during healing. The equine distal limb transfixation cast was modeled from a computed tomography scan of a representative third metacarpal bone of the horse. Finite element analysis was performed to evaluate the impact of pin parameters on bone-pin interface stresses and strains. The parameters were pin diameter, number, type (half or full, threaded or smooth), spacing, orientation, location within the bone and pin material. The model was also used to determine the effect of the cast-pin interface attachment, and to determine the effect of increasing fracture tissue stiffness or external foot contact pressure, on bone-pin interface stresses. A general approach to transcortical pin selection was developed based on the total pin area moment of inertia of pins in the cast. Pin diameter and pin number had the most profound influence on bone-pin interface stresses. Cast-pin interface attachment influenced the bone-pin interface stresses and modeling a fixed <b>pin</b> <b>end</b> position underestimated bone-pin interface stresses. Increasing distal contact pressure and tissue modulus decreased bone-pin interface stresses and their distribution around pin holes. The results of this study will assist equine surgeons in improving transfixation casting in the horse by employing methods that help to minimize complications associated with the bone-pin interface that are currently limiting the clinical success of this technique. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{temperature}} of the steel tube of a CFT column rises rapidly upon a fire causing the deterioration of its strength, while the concrete inside of the tube having large heat capacity provides fire-resistance performance. In order to employ CFT columns as fire-resistant structure, {{it is necessary to}} conduct studies on the factors exerting influence on structural capacities and the influence associated with each condition. Concrete’s compressive strength, cross-sectional size, axial load ratio and boundary condition are the major factors which are influential in fire-resistance performance. In particular, boundary condition between columns and beams {{is one of the major}} factors which decide fire-resistance performance because it exerts influence on load carrying capacity.

40|$|Competitive sailing is characterised by {{continuous}} interdependencies {{of decisions}} and actions. All actions imply a permanent {{monitoring of the}} environmental conditions, such as intensity {{and direction of the}} wind, sea characteristics, and the behaviour of the opponent sailors. These constraints on sailors’ behavior are in constant change implying continuous adjustments in sailors’ actions and decisions. Among the different parts of a regatta, tactics and strategy at the start are particularly relevant. Among coaches there is an adage that says that “the start is 50 % of a regatta” (Houghton, 1984; Saltonstall, 1983 / 1986). Olympic sailing regattas are performed with boats of the same class, by one, two or three sailors, depending on the boat class. Normally before the start, sailors visit the racing venue and analyse wind and sea characteristics, in order to fine- tune their boats accordingly. Then, five minutes before the start, sailors initiate starting procedures in order to be in a favourable position at the starting line (at the “second zero”). This position is selected during the start period according to wind shifts tendencies and the actions of other boats (Figure 11. 1). Only after the start signal can the boats cross the imaginary starting line between the race committee signal boat “A” and the <b>pin</b> <b>end</b> boat. The start takes place against the wind (upwind), and the boats start racing in the direction of mark 1. Based on the evaluation of the sea and wind characteristics (e. g. if the wind is stronger at a particular place on the course), sailors re- adjust their strategy for the regatta. This strategy may change during the regatta, according to wind changes and adversary actions. More to the point, strategic decisions constrain and are constrained by on- line decisions during the regatta...|$|E
40|$|The {{amount of}} torque {{required}} to either further tighten or loosen the connection under tension and pressure was determined from the threaded {{model and the}} same method of summing thread forces x radii.

The lack of effect by tension is due to loss of preload force on the stab flanks being equal to the increase of force on the load flanks, thereby producing no change on total torque. This behavior was also recognized by Clinedinst. Effect of Yielding on Torque Part II of this paper discusses elastic and plastic solutions with the threaded finite element model that used to determine maximum strain for 5. 4 turns, 9350 psi and 660 kips tension. The assembly interference was for a fast pin and slow box, with interferences of 0. 0079 in. at the <b>pin</b> <b>end</b> and 0. 0231 in. at the box end. Stresses were compared in Fig. 12 of Part II and showed significant reductions due to yielding of the P-l 10 material with the stress/strain relationship shown in Fig. 11 of Part II.

40|$|Stress Engineering Services (SES) was {{contracted}} by Mr. John Watts to {{test his}} ''WW'' threaded connection developed for oilfield oil and gas service. This work was a continuation of testing performed by SES as reported in August of 1999. The connection design tested was identified as ''WW''. The samples were all integral (no coupled connections) and contained a wedge thread form with 90 {sup o} flank angles relative to the pipe centerline. The wedge thread form is a variable width thread that primarily engages on the flanks. This thread form provides very high torque capacity and good stabbing ability and makeup. The test procedure selected {{for one of the}} samples was the newly written ISO 13679 procedure for full scale testing of casing and tubing connections, which is currently going through the ISO acceptance process. The ISO procedure requires a variety of tests that includes makeup/breakout testing, internal gas sealability/external water sealability testing with axial tension, axial compression, bending, internal gas thermal cycle tests and limit load (failure) tests. This test procedure was performed with one sample. Four samples were tested to failure. Table 1 contains a summary of the tasks performed by SES. The project started with the delivery of test samples by Mr. Watts. Pipe from the previous round of tests was used for the new samples. Figure 1 shows the structural and sealing results relative to the pipe body. Sample 1 was used to determine the torque capacity of the connection. Torque was applied to the capacity of SES's equipment which was 28, 424 ft-lbs. From this, an initial recommended torque range of 7, 200 to 8, 800 ft-lbs. was selected. The sample was disassembled and while there was no galling observed in the threads, the end of the pin had collapsed inward. Sample 2 received three makeups. Breakouts 1 and 2 also had collapsing of the <b>pin</b> <b>end,</b> with no thread galling. From these make/breaks, it was decided {{to reduce the amount of}} lubricant applied to the connection by applying it to the box or pin only and reducing the amount applied. Samples 3 and 4 received one makeup only. Sample 5 initially received two make/breaks to test for galling resistance before final makeup, No galling was observed. Later, three additional make/breaks were performed with no <b>pin</b> <b>end</b> collapse and galling over 1 / 2 a thread occurring on one of the breakouts. During the make/break tests, the stabbing and hand tight makeup of the WW connection was found to be very easy and trouble free. There was no tendency to crossthread, even when stabbed at an angle, and it screwed together very smoothly up to hand tight. During power tight makeup, there was no heat generated in the box (as checked by hand contact) and no jerkiness associated with any of the makeups or breakouts. Sample 2 was tested in pure compression. The maximum load obtained was 1, 051 kips and the connection was beginning to significantly deform as the sample buckled. Actual pipe yield was 1, 226 kips. Sample 3 was capped-end pressure tested to failure. The capped-end yield pressure of the pipe was 16, 572 psi and the sample began to leak at 12, 000 psi. Sample 4 was tested in pure tension. The maximum load obtained was 978 kips and the connection failed by fracture at the pin critical section. Actual pipe yield was 1, 226 kips. Sample 5 was tested in combined tension/compression and internal gas pressure. The sample was assembled, setup and tested four times. The first time was with a torque of 7, 298 ft-lbs and the connection leaked halfway to ISO Load Point 2 with loads of 693 kips and 4, 312 psi. The second time the torque was increased to 14, 488 ft-lbs and a leak occurred at 849 kips and 9, 400 psi, which was ISO Load Point 2. The third time the makeup torque was again increased, to 20, 456 ft-lbs, and a leak occurred at 716 kips and 11, 342 psi, ISO Load Point 4. The fourth test was with the same torque as before, 20, 617 ft-lbs, and the connection successfully tested up to load step 56, ISO Load Point 6 (second round) before leaking at 354 kips and 11, 876 psi.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a formulation for the modeling of a single-link flexible beam that is undergoing slewing motion at an actively controlled <b>pinned</b> <b>end,</b> {{where the other}} end of the beam is free. This <b>pinned</b> <b>end,</b> or slewing axis, is of fixed orientation such that the beam rotates in the horizontal plane. A geared dc electric motor is connected to the beam at the slewing axis. A position and a velocity sensor are placed at this hinged location, and their proportional feedback provides a position control system about the slewing axis. The motor characteristics, gear ratio, and the position feedback constant determine an equivalent rotational spring constant, often called the servo stiffness. This paper generalizes the structure's boundary conditions at the slewing axis to include the effects of the servo system. It is shown that the clamped-free beam assumption for the dynamics of the structure is a valid assumption if the ratio of the servo stiffness to beam flexibility is high. However, for moderate or low values of this ratio, the clamped-free beam leads to erroneous system models so that it becomes necessary to consider the effects of the driving servo on the dynamics of the flexible beam...|$|R

40|$|Solid state Friction stir welding (FSW) is {{of major}} {{interest}} in the welding of aluminium since it improves the joint properties. Many applications where Al-alloys are used are subject to varying load conditions, making fatigue failure a critical issue. In {{the scope of this}} thesis, the fatigue performance of friction stir welded AlMgSi-alloy 6082 has been investigated. Static and dynamic properties of different joint configurations and welds produced with varying process parameters have been determined. Microstructures of fractured surfaces have been studied to evaluate the effect of weld discontinuities on fatigue. The mechanical strength of the friction stir welds was set in relation to that of conventional fusion welds, and that of other FS welded Al-alloys. The friction stir process produced aluminium butt welds with high and consistent fatigue strengths, which exceeded the strengths of similar fusion welded samples. A smooth weld geometry showed to be of great importance for the fatigue performance, favouring the friction stir welds. Welding speed in a tested range of 0. 35 - 1. 4 m/min had only a modest influence on the properties of the friction stir welds; properties were not deteriorating at the highest speed. The softening of the alloy around the weldline was modelled. A fair description of the hardness profiles across the weld was obtained. At a low and high welding speed a full and partial softening respectively was predicted, indicating that full softening is not required to obtain a flawless weld. In case of friction stir overlap welds, tool design is even more important than in butt welding to secure weld quality. A broad tool shoulder with a concave <b>pin</b> <b>end</b> gave the best performance. In particular, the minimal influence on the sheet interface when welding with such a tool was beneficial for the fatigue strength. The stress distribution in overlap and T-type test specimens has been modelled. The stress intensity factors were determined. The corresponding crack propagation rates were in fair accordance with the experimental results. It was found that a simplified approach, developed to estimate ∆K for overlap spot welds, could be used also for friction stir overlap joints. QC 2010100...|$|E
40|$|Stress Engineering Services (SES) was {{contracted}} by Mr. John Watts to {{test his}} threaded connection developed for oilfield oil and gas service. This particular test required {{the application of a}} variety of loads including axial tension and compression, internal pressure (gas), external pressure (water), bending and both low and elevated temperature. These loads were used to determine the sealing and structural limits of the connection. The connection design tested had tapered threads with 10 threads per inch. A square thread form and a round thread form were tested. The square thread form had a 2 {sup o} load flank and 15 {sup o} stab flank. The round thread had a 0 {sup o} load flank and 20 {sup o} stab flank. Most of the testing was performed on the round thread form. Both a coupled connection design and an integral connection design were tested. The coupling was a pin by pin (male) thread, with the pipe having a box (female) thread. Both designs have outside and inside diameters that are flush with the pipe body. Both designs also contain a small external shoulder. The test procedure selected for this evaluation was the newly written ISO 13679 procedure for full scale testing of casing and tubing connections. The ISO procedure requires a variety of tests that includes makeup/breakout testing, internal gas sealability/external water sealability testing with axial tension, axial compression, bending, internal gas thermal cycle tests and limit load (failure) tests. This test was performed with four coupled samples and included most of these loads. Two integral samples were also included for limit load testing ISO makeup/breakout tests are divided into three types [...] initial makeup, IML 1, repeated makeup within the same sample, MBL, and repeated makeup using several samples called round robin, RR. IMU and MBL were performed in this project. The ISO sealing and structural procedure is divided into four primary tests and identified as Series A, B, C and Limit Load (failure). Series A and B test to 95 % actual yield of the pipe and Series C uses 90 % of actual yield. Samples 1 and 3 were tested to Series A and the loads are shown in Figure 1. For these samples, the axial compression was limited to 75 % pipe body yield, which was set by Mr. Watts {{at the beginning of the}} test. Samples 2 and 4 were tested to Series B with loads shown in Figure 2. This series included 20 degrees per 100 feet bending but no external pressure. Due to premature leaks, no samples were subjected to Series C which included mechanical and thermal cycles. Samples 5 and 6 were tested to failure. The project started with the selection and purchase of a popular size of oilfield pipe, which was 7 -inch OD, 32 pound per foot, P- 110 casing. While the connections were being threaded, material tensile tests were performed to get the actual strength of the 7 -inch pipe. The first samples contained a square thread form. Excessive galling was experienced during the first series of makeup/breakout tests and Mr. Watts decided to change the thread form and remachine the samples. The second samples had a round thread form and performed very well in the makeup/breakout tests. Basically no galling occurred of any consequence. Samples 1 and 3 were to be tested with external water (ISO Series A) while samples 2 and 4 were to be tested with bending (ISO Series B, no external pressure). Testing of all four samples started with tension and internal gas pressure. During this initial pressure testing, samples 1, 3 and 4 developed leaks and the test was stopped before any external pressure or bending was applied. Sample 2 successfully tested to ISO Load Point 5 which included bending before developing a leak. Figure 3 shows the loads at which the samples leaked and the relative pipe body performance capability. Sample 1 and end A of sample 2 held a high pressure while samples 3, 4 and end B of sample 2 leaked at relatively low pressures. All of these leaks were with nitrogen gas pressure. After reviewing the results, it was believed that several conditions may have contributed to the premature leaks: The BOL 2000 thread lubricant contains solid particles that are larger than the solid particles in API 5 A 2 compound. Possibly the large particles prevented tight thread contact necessary for gas leak tightness. The BOL 2000 lubricant may have caused or at least contributed to the yielding of the <b>pin</b> <b>end</b> during makeup. Pin inward deformation was found in some pins subsequent to testing and breakout. Excessive yielding of the pin or box will contribute to poor thread contact and leakage. The connections were made up to full or near full shoulder contact. This causes the end of the pin to be stressed near the yield strength. This along with the interference caused by the thread compound may cause excessive pin hoop stresses and yielding which in turn gives relatively loose thread contact. This behavior is present when repeated makeup and breakout occurs...|$|E
40|$|The {{method of}} {{multiple}} scales {{is used to}} analyze the nonlinear vibrations of a beam with <b>pinned</b> <b>ends.</b> The formulation incorporates the effects of the transverse shear deformation as well as the rotary inertia on the large amplitude vibration behaviour. A uniformly valid higher second-order perturbation solution is obtained. The predictions of nonlinear frequencies at different beam parameters are given. The influences of shear and rotary inertia are significant in the case of moderately thick and short beams undergoing large amplitude vibrations. King Saud Universit...|$|R
5000|$|Rectangular {{cement plant}} {{ductwork}} is often 1/4" [...] (6 mm) duct plate, with stiffeners spaced at about 2'-6", depending on suction pressure and temperature. Thinner plate requires a closer stiffener spacing. The stiffeners are usually considered <b>pinned</b> <b>end.</b> Power plant ductwork can be 5/16" [...] thick duct plate, with [...] "fixed end" [...] W stiffeners at roughly 2'-5" [...] spacing. Because rectangular duct plate bends, stiffeners are required at reasonably close spacing. Duct plate 3/16", or thinner, may dishpan, or make noise, {{and should be}} avoided.|$|R

A direct model following adaptive controller {{is designed to}} control the torque at the <b>pinned</b> <b>end</b> of the arm so as to command the free end to track a prescribed sinusoidal motion. Conditions that must be satisfied {{in order for the}} controller to work are stated. Simulation results to date are discussed along with the potential of the model following adaptive control scheme in robotics and space environments...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an experimental investigation of short cold-formed lipped channel columns compressed between <b>pinned</b> <b>ends.</b> The short columns {{are subjected to}} pure axial compressive loading. Twelve column specimens are tested and the columns are categorised into three groups, depending on the length and thickness. The buckling modes of failure that occurred include local buckling and distortional buckling. A comparison of the experimental results with the loads predicted by the South African standard {{for the design of}} cold-formed steelwork (SANS 10162 - 2) shows that the code is not conservative enough to cater for these columns...|$|R
