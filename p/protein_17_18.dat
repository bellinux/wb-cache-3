40|$|ABSTRACT: We {{describe}} {{significantly improved}} long-distance measurements in biomolecules {{by use of}} the new multipulse double electron−electron spin resonance (DEER) illustrated with {{the example of a}} five-pulse DEER sequence. In this sequence, an extra pulse at the pump frequency is used compared with standard four-pulse DEER. The position of the extra pulse is fixed relative to the three pulses of the detection sequence. This significantly reduces the effect of nuclear spin-diffusion on the electron-spin phase relaxation, thereby enabling longer dipolar evolution times that are required to measure longer distances. Using spin-labeled T 4 lysozyme at a concentration less than 50 μM, as an example, we show that the evolution time increases by a factor of 1. 8 in protonated solution and 1. 4 in deuterated solution to 8 and 12 μs, respectively, with the potential to increase them further. This enables {{a significant increase in the}} measurable distances, improved distance resolution, or both. SECTION: Biophysical Chemistry and Biomolecules Pulsed dipolar ESR spectroscopy (PDS), represented bydouble-electron electron resonance (DEER or PELDOR) 1 and double-quantum coherence electron spin resonance (DQC ESR), 2 − 6 has been developed into a versatile biophysical method of studying structure and function of biomolecules 5 − 10 on the nanoscale, (typically 1 − 9 nm) by measuring the strength of the electron spin dipole−dipole interaction between paramagnetic centers (tags). This enables the study of a variety of systems including membrane proteins, 11 − 13 large multiunit protein complexes; 14, 15 proteins that undergo structural transformations, 16 and oligonucleotides and their complexes with <b>proteins.</b> <b>17,</b> <b>18</b> It is also being applied to study colloids and polymers, 19 supramolecular constructs, 20 and other nano-objects. 21, 22 The electron spins are those of paramagnetic tags, usually nitroxide labels but also metal ions, 23 selectively introduced into desired positions of the biomolecule, although structural information has also been obtained by measuring distances between endogenous paramagnetic centers in proteins. 11, 24 − 2...|$|R
40|$|The DNA {{sequence}} of the equine herpesvirus type 1 (EHV- 1) gD gene homologue has been determined for the strain Abl and compared with previously published sequences. A portion of the gene has been located to a {{region of the genome}} which also encodes homologues of the herpes implex virus type 1 genes for gE and gI and is known to encode an epitope of the virion <b>protein</b> gp <b>17</b> / <b>18.</b> Analysis of the EHV- 1 strain Kentucky A (KyA) by DNA hybridization showed the presence of a gD gene homologue and established the absence of genes for gI and gE. Western blot analysis, however, showed that KyA virus particles contain gpl 7 / 18, thus indicating that this protein is encoded by the gD gene homologue. The KyA gp <b>17</b> / <b>18</b> was found to be smaller than that detected in other strains and this is accounted for by a frameshift mutation in the KyA sequence relative to Abl. The mutation in the KyA strain results in an altered C-terminal sequence and could explain the apparent structural differences suggested by the reacti-vities with monoclonal antibodies (MAbs). We have also expressed part of the Abl gD gene as a fusion protein with glutathione S-transferase in Escherichia coli and shown that this reacts with the MAb 5 H 6 originally used to map gp <b>17</b> / <b>18.</b> These experiments establish that gp <b>17</b> / <b>18</b> is encoded by the gD gene homologue...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Identifying {{potential}} {{patterns in}} pirarucu (Arapaima gigas) composition, {{as a function}} of the different fish muscle zones (dorse, venter, ventrecha and tail), was the main objective of this research. For such, the different pirarucu muscle zones were evaluated, in order to obtain proximate composition and minerals content. It was also determined amino acids and fatty acids contents in fish muscle. The dorsal, ventral and tail muscle zones presented similar moisture (76. 5 - 78. 2 %), <b>protein</b> (<b>17.</b> 8 - <b>18.</b> 9 %), total lipids (1. 0 - 1. 5 %) and ash (0. 9 - 1. 2 %) contents.

The main minerals found in fish muscle were K (183. 5 - 288. 6 mg/ 100 g muscle) and Na (65. 1 - 175. 5 mg/ 100 g). Glutamic acid (3027. 6 mg/ 100 g muscle) was the main amino acid found in fish muscle, which presented 48 % of essential amino acids in the protein fraction.

40|$|The phosphocarrier HPr (heat stable protein) of Staphylococcus carnosus was {{modified}} by site-directed mutagenesis of the corresponding ptsH gene {{in order to}} analyse the importance of amino acids which {{were supposed to be}} part of the active centre of the protein. Three residues which are conserved in all HPrs, Arg <b>17,</b> Pro <b>18</b> and Glu 84, were mutated: Arg 17 was changed to His (17 RH) and Pro 18 and Glu 84 were changed into Ala (18 PA and 84 EA). In addition, Leu 86 was changed into Ala (86 LA) and one mutant protein was missing the last six residues of the HPr (delta 83). The wild type gene and all mutant genes were overexpressed and the gene products purified to homogeneity. Three-dimensional structures of wild type and mutant proteins were monitored by NMR spectroscopy. All five mutant HPrs had native conformations. The ATP-dependent HPr kinase can phosphorylate all HPr derivatives at Ser 46. The PTS activity of the amino-terminal HPr mutant <b>proteins</b> <b>17</b> RH and <b>18</b> PA was different compared to wild type HPr. In contrast, the carboxy-terminal mutant HPrs possessed a similar enzyme activity to the wild type HPr. The <b>17</b> RH and <b>18</b> PA HPrs with substitution near the active centre His 15 showed a very slow phosphorylation by enzyme I but the further transfer of the phosphoryl group to enzyme III was also strongly inhibited. The enzyme activity of the HPr 17 RH was significantly improved at low pH. NMR pH-titration experiments showed that Arg 17 is not responsible for the low pKa of the active centre His 15 but this positively charged residue is essential in this position for the HPr activity...|$|R

Se <b>17</b> / <b>18</b> was transcribed in cultured S. exigua 301 cells, as a polyadenylated transcript of 1 � 1 kb. 5 �-RACE analysis demonstrated that Se <b>17</b> / <b>18</b> transcripts started at 134, 131 and 126 nt upstream of the putative translational start codon. These sites overlap with a baculovirus consensus early promoter motif. Se <b>17</b> / <b>18</b> transcripts were detected by Northern blot analysis and RT–PCR with increasing abundance from 8 h to 24 h post infection (p. i.) and still present until 72 h p. i. A C-terminal GFP-fusion <b>protein</b> of Se <b>17</b> / <b>18</b> was primarily localized in the cytoplasm of Se 301 and Sf 21 cells.

40|$|Molecular {{simulations}} {{approaches are}} powerful tools for structural biology and drug discovery. They provide additional and complementary information on structure, dynamics and energetics of biomolecules whose structures have been determined experimentally [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. In particular, Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations [8], along with elastic network analysis [9], offer insights into molecular fluctuations, conformational changes and allosteric mechanisms. In addition, molecular simulation {{can be used}} to design novel and potent ligands to a specific target (either a protein or DNA) as well as to estimate ligands potency [10, 11]. Attempts at predicting protein structures using bioinformatics and MD are also increasingly successful [12, 13, 14, 15], as well as approaches that use solely simulation tools [16]. The development of new algorithms and the continuously growing computer power currently allow for the simulation of more and more complex biological systems, such as <b>protein</b> aggregates [7, <b>17,</b> <b>18,</b> 19, 20] and protein/DNA complexes [21]. In this context, a number of theoretical techniques (namely molecular dynamics simulations, elastic network analysis, electrostatic modeling and binding energy predictions) have here been applied to the study of specific proteins. On the basis of X-ray protein structures, molecular simulations have provided a detailed description of internal motions and interactions, which are not evident from the experimental data and have functional implications. First, we have used MD to investigate structural features, focusing on the differences between the solid state and the aqueous solution structures. Over 80...|$|R
