40|$|Medicare {{statutes}} and regulations do not define observation services. The only definition appears in various CMS manuals, where observation services are described as: 1 "a well-defined set of specific, clinically appropriate services, which include ongoing short term treatment, assessment, and reassessment, that are furnished while {{a decision is}} being made regarding whether patients will require further treatment as hospital inpatients or if {{they are able to}} be discharged from the hospital. " 2 According to the CMS manuals, in most cases a beneficiary may not remain in observation services for more than 24 or 48 hours. 3 Unfortunately, under current Medicare rules, time spent in outpatient observation services in a hospital does not satisfy the three-day inpatient hospital requirement which entitles the patient to Medicare coverage of any <b>post-hospital</b> extended <b>care</b> services in a skilled nursing facility (SNF). This means that Medicare beneficiaries are then charged directly for various services they receive in an acute care setting, including prescription medications, and for their SNF stay, rather than Medicare covering those costs.

40|$|In {{the case}} of acute {{myocardial}} infarction (AMI), prompt and appropriate initial treatment is essential for increasing the rate of survival and early reperfusion is a main determinant factor for long-term prognosis. The survival of a patient with refractory ventricular fibrillation {{was made possible by}} cooperative emergency medical care including air medical transport, despite long distance to the hospital. The patient was a 60 -year-old man. Under a diagnosis of AMI, a helicopter emergency medical service (HEMS) with medical staff on board was requested. Although ventricular fibrillation (VF) occurred at the scene, quick and appropriate advanced cardiovascular life support (ACLS) was provided by the attending doctor, leading to the return of heartbeat. Since the patient still exhibited serious bradycardia and cardiac failure, he was airlifted while undergoing transcutaneous pacing. Upon arrival at the hospital, the patient underwent emergency percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). During the PCI, VF recurred and chest compressions and a total of 17 defibrillations were performed. The PCI was continued with percutaneous cardiopulmonary support (PCPS).

40|$|AbstractObjective:This study {{determined}} {{the quantity and}} nature of emergencies leading to unscheduled hospital admissions of adults with congenital cardiac disease and their mid-term survival. ResultsDuring 1 year, 429 adults with congenital cardiac diseases were admitted 571 times, and 124 admissions (22 %) of 95 patients (22 %) were emergency admissions. Fifteen of the 95 patients were seen {{for the first time}} in 1 of the participating centers. The underlying anomalies were Fallot's tetralogy and pulmonary atresia (n = 26 / 7), univentricular heart after Fontan procedure (n = 25), atrial septal defect (n = 18), Eisenmenger syndrome (n = 12), complete transposition (n = 11), and others (n = 25). Indications for admission were cardiovascular complications (n = 103; 83 %) (arrhythmia, cardiac failure, syncope, pacemaker problems, pericardial tamponade, and sudden death), infections (n = 8, 6 %) (endocarditis, pacemaker infection, pneumonia, and cerebral abscess), acute chest pain (n = 7; 6 %), and acute abdominal pain (n = 4; 3 %). All patients required immediate emergency care, and 16 patients (17 %) required urgent cardiovascular or abdominal surgery. Six patients died during the hospital stay.

40|$|Articles on {{clinical}} pharmacy {{services in the}} home began appearing 3 decades ago but numbers have greatly increased in the last decade. This overview of the English language literature identified 66 reports describing 57 home-based clinical pharmacy programs. Most programs were provided {{in the context of}} a time-limited research project. Medication reviews (defined as comprehensive assessment of the appropriateness of the medication regimen) and medication management (defined as assessment and support of medication compliance) were the most common services provided. Primary <b>care,</b> <b>post-hospital</b> discharge, and home healthcare were the typical service contexts, and elderly patients at high risk of medication problems were the primary target population. The early literature predominantly focused on medication management and patient counseling services based in the US; however, since 1991, reports of medication review programs in the UK and Australia have dominated. Barriers to home-based clinical services have been identified at the healthcare system, pharmacy, pharmacist, physician, and patient levels. The most common barriers are lack of (or inadequate) remuneration and the related barriers of community pharmacy or pharmacist time constraints, and the cost and time to attain and maintain pharmacist qualifications. Other important barriers are difficulty in accessing the physician to discuss drug therapy recommendations, and inadequate patient referrals. Additional barriers pertaining to the delivery of the clinical service include inadequate clinical training of community pharmacists, service provision by a pharmacist unknown to the patient, and limited access to patient information for the pharmacist. Patient barriers are lack of awareness, reluctance to accept an intervention from the pharmacist, inaccessibility, and forgetting appointments or refusing the service after initial agreement. The most commonly cited facilitators pertain to the pharmacist-physician relationship; foremost among these is having an established working relationship between the pharmacist and family physician. Others are face-to-face meetings between pharmacist and prescribing physician, and facilitator positions in Divisions of General Practice. A few facilitators of the referral system, pharmacist motivation, and service delivery have also been identified. Evaluative data were provided for 48 programs; 21 programs were evaluated within a randomized controlled trial. Thirteen of these trials found at least one statistically significant difference between groups; however, although important outcomes such as hospitalization and quality of life were often examined, the only parameter that was affected on a consistent basis was medication compliance (four of six trials). The literature {{on clinical}} pharmacy services in the home is growing and maturing. While medication review is the most common type of service reported, several other types of clinical services have been explored in this setting. Although evaluation of impact has become more rigorous over time, the overall evidence is limited and many questions remain about optimal practice models and target patient populations. Given the time intensity of home-based services, it is important that more research be conducted to provide firm evidence of value. DOI: 10. 2165 / 0115677 - 200816040 - 00004...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} charges incurred {{under the}} Medicare program for inpatient hospital, skilled nursing facility (SNF), and home health agency (HHA) care for 1976. This research {{was made possible}} {{through the construction of}} a new data set which links a beneficiary's use of these three services. Summary highlights reveal that an overwhelming majority of the 7. 5 million Medicare episodes of illness do not involve post-hospital SNF or HHA care. Those episodes of illness that use only hospital care are substantially (53 %) cheaper than all other episodes. A large percentage of these charge differences reflect the greater number of hospital days of care associated with <b>post-hospital</b> <b>care</b> services. However, an analysis of the beneficiaries ' demographic characteristics suggests that persons who use <b>post-hospital</b> <b>care</b> generally differ from those who receive only hospital care. We found that persons who use post-hospital SNF or HHA, or both types of care are likely to be female, to have cancer, diabetes, fractured bones or a central nervous or vascular system disease, and to be older than persons who do not use these types of care. The data also show that a beneficiary's area of residence greatly influences the amount and types of care received. Persons who reside in the New England, Middle Atlantic, and Pacific Divisions are more likely to receive <b>post-hospital</b> <b>care</b> services than persons who live elsewhere in the United States. These persons also incur among the highest per capita institutional charges in the United States. Part of this variation in institutional charges per capita is explained by the high input price index found in these areas, and in some cases by the high quantity of services index...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{estimate}} {{the differences in}} functional outcomes attributable to discharge to one of four different venues for <b>post-hospital</b> <b>care</b> for each of five different types of illness associated with post-hospital care: stroke, {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD), congestive heart failure (CHF), hip procedures, and hip fracture, and to {{estimate the}} costs and benefits associated with discharge to the type of care that was estimated to produce the greatest improvement. STUDY SETTING/DATA SOURCES: Consecutive patients with any of the target diagnoses were enrolled from 52 hospitals in three cities. Data sources included interviews with patients or their proxies, medical record reviews, and the Medicare Automated Data Retrieval System. ANALYSIS: A two-stage regression model looked first at the factors associated with discharge to each type of <b>post-hospital</b> <b>care</b> and then at the outcomes associated with each location. An instrumental variables technique was used to adjust for selection bias. A predictive model was created for each patient to estimate how that person would have fared had she or he been discharged to each type of care. The optimal discharge location was determined as that which produced the greatest improvement in function after adjusting for patients' baseline characteristics. The costs of discharge to the optimal type of care was based on the differences in mean costs for each location. DATA COLLECTION/EXTRACTION METHODS: Data were collected from patients or their proxies at discharge from hospital and at three post-discharge follow-up times: six weeks, six months, and one year. In addition, the medical records for each participant were abstracted by trained abstractors, using a modification of the Medisgroups method, and Medicare data were summarized for the years before and after the hospitalization. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In general, patients discharged to nursing homes fared worst and those sent home with home health care or to rehabilitation did best. Because the cost of rehabilitation is high, greater use of home care could result in improved outcomes at modest or no additional cost. CONCLUSIONS: Better decisions about where to discharge patients could improve the course of many patients. It is possible to save money by making wiser discharge planning decisions. Nursing homes are generally associated with poorer outcomes and higher costs than the other <b>post-hospital</b> <b>care</b> modalities...|$|E

Challenges: In this paper, we highlight and discuss three challenges that seem to be insufficiently articulated when hospital and community nurses interact during discharge planning. These three challenges are: how local practices circumvent formal structures, how nurses' different perspectives influence their assessment of patients' need for <b>post-hospital</b> <b>care,</b> and how nurses have different understanding of what it means to be ‘ready to be discharged’. Discussion: We propose that nurses need to discuss these challenges and their implications for nursing care so as to be ready to face changing demands for health care in future...|$|E

Materials and methods: 1005 peripheral arterial procedures were performed in 862 lower limbs in 782 patients. 62 % of the limbs were critically ischaemic. The procedures include 565 bypasses, 346 endarterectomies and 94 combinations of both. 30 % of the patients were women. Follow-up information was obtained from practitioners in charge of <b>post-hospital</b> <b>care</b> by questionnaires. Factors potentially affecting patency were investigated by multivariate analysis and patency rates were calculated by life-tables.

Aware of this burden, the program ‘Via Verde do AVC’ was implemented in Portugal, {{with the objective of}} reducing mortality by stroke, specially on ischemic stroke patients aged between 18 and 80 years old. Objectives: This thesis focus on the performance of ‘Via Verde do AVC’, and aims to assess whether the program has achieved significant health gains, at reasonable costs. Methodology: Individual level in-hospital data on stroke admissions, and regional level stroke mortality rates are studied, in order to assess the program’s impact on mortality. For in-hospital analysis, the impact is measured as a whole, as well as breakdown by expertise level and/or year. In the regional analysis, simple and weighted regressions are performed. Results: The regressions performed do not show statistically significant impact of ‘Via Verde do AVC’ on ischemic stroke mortality. The health status of the patient at arrival (measured by the number of diagnosis), as well as the hospital are the most relevant explanatory variables. For regional analysis, there are significant regional asymmetries in stroke mortality, and time has also been a critical factor for mortality reduction. Conclusions: There is little {{reason to believe that the}} program decreases mortality before or during a hospital stroke episode.

40|$|There {{have been}} recent {{proposals}} to enhance organization and funding of emergency {{care in the}} U. S. because of perceived deficiencies – especially in services for children. Motor vehicle crashes are among the leading causes of death and disability for both adults {{and children in the}} United States and place a heavy burden on emergency and trauma care. This study uses the Fatality Accident Reporting System (FARS) to examine the length of time between vehicle crash and hospital arrival for crashes involving seriously injured children transported to hospital in 2003. Only about 1 / 3 (1868) of 5436 crashes had data for hospital arrival time. For those cases that could be evaluated, median transport time was 46 minutes (52 minutes for rural crashes, 35 minutes for those in urban areas). There was substantial delay in a minority of crashes. Delays occurred both between crash and emergency services (EMS) notification and between EMS contact and hospital arrival and were more common in rural crashes. Other research has shown that prolonged transport times are associated with worsened trauma outcomes.

40|$|Within Canadian society inequities {{exist in}} health status {{and health care}} provision. Residents of rural, {{isolated}} areas tend to fare worse when compared with their urban counterparts. Much of the research about health care provision is written for and from urban centres.

The research explores how discharge planning is accomplished at rural and small town acute care hospitals within the Northern Interior Health Region of British Columbia. A descriptive qualitative methodology was used to address the research question. Fifteen semi-structured interviews were conducted at five different small town locations within the Northern Interior Health Region of British Columbia. At each location {{interviews were conducted with}} three key informants about the discharge planning practices utilized at the local hospital. These key informants were a practicing physician, a nurse employed at the hospital, and a recently discharged patient. Analysis of the interview transcripts revealed twenty-four themes. Eleven of these themes suggest that the rural and small town environment exerts a positive influence on discharge planning processes, practices, and outcomes. Thirteen of the emergent themes suggest that the rural and small town context negatively influences discharge planning. A comparative analysis across key informant groups found similarities across the groups with physician and nurse responses being most similar. The themes derived from the patient interviews were more unique. Results suggest that improving outcomes for patients discharged from rural and small town hospitals will require augmentation and coordination of community based supports such as home care nursing, mental health services, and social services. Increased accessibility to specialist resources and more direct involvement of patients in planning for their <b>post-hospital</b> <b>care</b> needs are also indicated.

40|$|Background/Purpose: With the CMS {{decision}} to publicly report hospital-specific post-operative total joint replacement (TJR) complications and readmissions, orthopedic surgeons need {{new sources of}} post-operative outcome data to monitor and improve <b>post-hospital</b> <b>care.</b> The AHRQ funded research program, Function and Outcomes Research for Comparative Effectiveness in Total Joint Replacement (FORCE-TJR), developed methods to capture longitudinal patient-reported outcomes (PROs) and comprehensive post-TJR medical and surgical events, and established a web reporting system to return comparative outcome reports to participating surgeons and hospitals in order to monitor and improve quality and outcomes. Methods: This national cohort/registry captures post-TJR measures directly from patients in their homes to assure uniform time, completion, and consistency for data comparisons across hospitals. Quarterly updated web reports deliver hospital- and surgeon-specific TJR outcomes {{compared with those of}} their peers and risk-adjusted national benchmarks on PROs as well as on post-operative event rates. Results: Our national cohort enrolled 25, 000 patients from 150 diverse orthopedists in 22 US states with varied hospital and surgeon practices. The secure, HIPAA compliant website was established that presents summary and risk-adjusted comparative statistics for primary TJR for all enrolled patients. The website provides a downloadable and printable report and an Executive Summary of key pre-operative patient risk factors, post-operative events, and post-operative PROs enabling the providers to compare their outcomes to the other participating sites. Individual patient reports are available for surgeons with real-time scores and trended outcome data to facilitate patient and surgeon shared treatment decision making. Conclusion/Implications: A secure reporting website was established to disseminate comparative outcome reports to all participating hospitals and surgeons. Returning comparative outcome data to hospitals and surgeons encourages their active participation in this national registry and allows them to undstand their relative performance compared to peers while supporting practice-level quality monitoring and improvement efforts in patient care...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: As {{resources}} and criteria of eligibility {{are very different}} across countries, clients differ in their dependency, frailty and availability of informal care. In some countries recipients of home care more behave like critical consumers knowing their rights than those in other countries. Enceforth, systems may differ in the way clients are informed, can choose and, if necessary, can submit complaints. Another difference concerns the acknowledgement and role of informal carers, which is reflected, for instance, in the possibility for informal carers to be supported (e. g. with respite care). Very little comparative information is available at this point. Methods and Materials: The EC-financed EURHOMAP project has developed an extensive set of indicators to map home care systems, including the position and situation of clients and informal carers. Data were collected in 2009 and early 2010 in 31 European countries. Additional information came from the answers of a panel of key informants to questions related to four ‘vignettes’ (hypothetical case descriptions of home living people in need of care). Results: In most countries the largest share among recipients of home care consists of people above the age of 65 years. The number of recipients of home care varied enormously. In some countries home care is almost limited to the elderly, while in other countries {{a wider range of}} services is provided to a wider variety of client and patient groups, including those in need of palliative (end-of-life) care and those in need of <b>post-hospital</b> <b>care.</b> Great differences were found in empowering recipients of home care (such as: offering choice of provider, type of provider; personal budget as an option; and availability of benchmark information to enable recipients to compare providers). Conclusion: Countries strongly differ in the number of home care recipients, their position in the system and the role of informal carers in the allocation and provision of formal care.

40|$|Das Krankenhausfinanzierungssystem Diagnosis Related Groups soll dem Prinzip "Geld folgt Leistung" entsprechen. Die Untersuchung von 6. 459 Fällen eines Berliner Geriatrie-Fachkrankenhauses (Vollerhebung), analysiert die mit Sozialdienstprozeduren erfassten Leistungen (SozOPS-G©) der Jahrgänge 2004, 2005 (Analysestichprobe) und 2006 (Validierungsstichprobe). Als dichotomisierte Indikatorvariablen in Faktorenanalysen eingegangene 37 Einzelleistungen führen zur Verdichtung auf ein Drittel reliabel zusammenfassbarer Module. Die Stichproben bringen 13 Faktoren hervor, die zusammen 65 - 66 % der Gesamtvarianz Klinischer Fachsozialarbeit abbilden. Multiple Regressionsanalysen zeigen, dass sich 43 % der Varianz zeitlicher Inanspruchnahme von Sozialdienstleistungen Patientenmerkmalen zuordnen lassen. Der standardisierte Regressionskoeffizient indiziert, dass Variablen des administrativen Verlaufs die stärksten Effekte aufweisen. Prognostisch bedeutsam sind poststationär institutionalisierte Langzeitversorgung (mittlerer Zusatzaufwand ca. 1 Stunde) und Verweildauer (ca. 2 Minuten pro Tag). Demenz beansprucht durchschnittlich einen Mehraufwand von ca. 13 Minuten. 43 % der Varianz des Sozialdienst-Aufwandes können durch 10 - 12 Einflussgrößen erklärt werden (R 2 = 0, 434; F= 119, 597; df= 24 / 3739; p< 0, 001). Einzelleistungen Klinischer Fachsozialarbeit lassen sich bei sachlogischer Zusammenführung zu kohärenten Leistungsbausteinen kombinieren und können stabil gemessen werden (Faktorenanalyse). Die Inanspruchnahme sozialdienstlicher Leistungen läßt sich auf spezifische Patientenmerkmale zurückführen (Regressionsanalyse). Die abrechnungsrelevante Berücksichtigung der interaktionsintensiven Fachberatungs- und Interventionsleistungen Klinischer Fachsozialarbeit im DRG-System ist grundsätzlich möglich. Established in Germany's {{hospitals}} in 2004, Diagnosis Related Groups (DRG) {{are said to}} be operated by "money follows case-related performance". Comprehensive Geriatric Treatment (procedure code "OPS 8 - 550 ") requires a variety of interdisciplinary collaborations. This approach combines treatment and rehabilitation as a holistic intervention. Since psychosocial issues are as relevant as functional decline or physical limitations, social workers are integrated in the Geriatric Assessment Team. However, their work of providing support to frail elders and the chronically ill is not yet figured in the cost containment system. In this study, all procedural tasks that deal with the complexity of discharge planning processes were categorized and outlined in a newly developed instrument that includes time exposure. Based on the "Procedure Codes of Hospital Social Work" (clinical information system embedded "SozOPS-G©") inpatients of a German hospital for Geriatrics (N= 6459) were statistically evaluated. Multiple regression and factor analyses were used to test the instrument's reliability and predictive value for social workers' expenditure of time. Morbidity, <b>post-hospital</b> <b>care</b> (e. g. home health care, short- or long-term care facilities, hospice services), length of stay and treatment procedure were consistently identified as significant predictors of psychosocial intervention expenditure (R 2 = 0. 434; F= 119, 597; df= 24 / 3739; p<. 001). A factor analysis revealed that a total of 37 procedural tasks could be reliably reduced to 13 aggregated factors covering 65 % of total variance. In conclusion, the diversity and complexity of effective social work services can be reliably formalized, aggregated and quantified to fit the needs of DRG-based funding...|$|E
40|$|Objective – To {{determine}} {{the impact of}} hospital library services on clinical decision making. Design – A descriptive survey. Setting – Fifteen hospitals in the Rochester area of New York, United States of America. Seven hospitals were {{in the city of}} Rochester, and eight were in surrounding rural communities. Subjects – Active physicians and residents affiliated with the Rochester hospitals. Methods – This study built upon the methodology used in an earlier study by D. N. King of the contribution of hospital libraries to clinical care in Chicago. Lists were compiled of all the active physicians and residents who were affiliated with the Rochester hospitals. In order to ensure that there was a reasonable number of participants from each hospital, and that librarians in hospitals with larger numbers of staff were not overburdened with requests, predetermined percentages were set for the sample: 10 % of active physicians from hospitals with more than 25 medical staff members, 30 % from hospitals with less staff, and 30 % of residents and rural physicians. This resulted in a desirable sample size of 448. A systematic sample with a random start was then drawn from each hospital’s list, and physicians and residents were recruited until the sample size was achieved. Participants were asked to request information related to a clinical case from their hospital library, and to evaluate its impact on patient care, by responding to a two‐page questionnaire. Main results – Based on usable questionnaires, there was an overall response rate of 46. 4 % (208 of 448). Eighty percent of the respondents stated that they probably (48 %) or definitely (32. 4 %) handled a clinical situation differently due to the information received from the library. In terms of the specific aspects of care for which changes were made, 71. 6 % reported a change in advice given to the patient, 59. 6 % cited a change in treatment, 50. 5 % a changein diagnostic tests, 45. 2 % a change in drugs, and 38. 5 % a change in <b>post‐hospital</b> <b>care</b> or treatment. Physicians credited the information provided by the library as contributing to their ability to avoid additional tests and procedures (49 %), additional outpatient visits (26. 4 %), surgery (21. 2 %), patient mortality (19. 2 %), hospital admission (11. 5 %), and hospital‐acquired infections (8. 2 %). In response to a question about the importance of several sources ofinformation, the library received the highest rating amidst other sources including lab tests, diagnostic imaging, and discussions with colleagues. Conclusion – This study validates earlier research findings that physicians view the information provided by hospital libraries as having a significant impact on clinical decision making. Library supplied information influences changes to specific aspects of care as well as the avoidance of adverse events for patients. The significance of this influence is underscored by the finding that relative to other sources, information obtained from the hospital library was rated more highly...|$|E
40|$|The EPP Project was a {{descriptive}} and inferential study {{designed to determine}} the psychosocial and medical needs of elderly post-hospital dischargees. The areas of need assessed were (1) living arrangements, (2) use of leisure time, (3) vocational adjustment, (4) financial functioning and (5) adjustment to illness. The instrument adopted {{for the purpose of}} this study was an adaptation of a scheduled in the New York Study. The New York Study, described in The Elderly Ambulatory Patient: Nursing and Psychosocial Needs by Doris Schwartz, Barbara Henley and Leonard Zeitz was a long-range study of the needs of elderly clinic patients. The schedule utilized both open-end and structured responses. Interviews were conducted in the homes of respondents. A sample of 63 patients was drawn and found from a population of elderly dischargees of the Kaiser Foundation Hospital in Portland, Oregon. The study group was composed of 20 patients adjudged by their physicians as having a high probability of need for post-hospital skilled nursing care. The control group included 43 patients systematically selected from a sample of the general hospital populace of elderly patients discharged during the same period of time as the study group and not considered to be in need of special nursing services. Findings yielded evidence to support the hypothesis that patients adjudged by the doctors as having more medical needs also had more social needs. A second hypothesis stating that medical and social needs of the study group were the same as medical and social needs of the control group was rejected. Those in the study group evidenced greater medical and related social needs. The third hypothesis sought to test the reliability of the Greenlick prediction formula, an instrument used in a previous Kaiser Hospital study to estimate the need for skilled nursing service in a population following hospital discharge. Findings indicated that the Greenlick prediction formula was effective in ascertaining need for immediate <b>post-hospital</b> <b>care</b> and was effective, with greater variance, in predicting needs over time. The final hypothesis asserted that the needs of the patients in the EPP Project were the same as those determined in the New York Study. This hypothesis was rejected when analysis of data yielded evidence that the patients in the EPP Project functioned at a higher level in all areas considered than did the patients in the New York Study. Unexpectedly, the findings disproved the stereotype emphasized in social work literature characterizing the elderly as being needy and in distress both socially and medically. On the contrary, findings indicated that such unqualified generalizations about elderly patients as a homogeneous group cannot appropriately be made. Collection and analysis of the data pointed to the need for social work services in the area of budgeting for medical expenses and utilization of appropriate community resources. A further indication was the need for volunteers to provide services such as transportation to enhance participation in social and recreational activities. The use of volunteers would also facilitate grocery shopping and obtaining medical attention. Implications for further research suggested the need for additional empirical studies of elderly post-hospital patients in a variety of settings...|$|E
