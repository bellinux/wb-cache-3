25|$|The {{manuscript}} {{was presented}} to George Neville, Archbishop of York (1465–1472). It once belonged to Richard Brinkley (or Brinkeley), who <b>probably</b> <b>got</b> it from Covenant of Grey Friars at Cambridge (like minuscule 61). Then it belonged to William Chark (or Charc), mentioned in marginal notes of codex 61. Then it belonged to Thomas Hayne, who in 1641 gave this codex with his other books to the Leicester Library.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1940s, an {{anthropology}} student, Dr. Roffo, obtained permission to excavate. In pursuance of this, he used explosives to open Jedar B, {{from which he}} obtained a skeleton which was in a wooden coffin in a tomb excavated beneath the building; the same happened {{with one of the}} smaller jedars at Ternaten. The whereabouts of these skeletons is unknown (they may lie unrecognised in an Algerian museum) and Dr. Roffo, it is said, burnt most of his notes in a fit of pique after an argument with the Director of Antiquities (who had <b>probably</b> <b>got</b> wind of his methods of 'excavation').|$|E
25|$|Whisner {{returned}} to England in late September. By this time, however, the Luftwaffe had taken heavy losses and was opposing allied pilots far less often. Whisner flew his first combat mission on 28 September, shortly after being promoted to Captain. The 352nd Group was not credited with destroying any aircraft until 1 November. Whisner, now a captain, rejoined the 487th Squadron {{in the fall}} of 1944. On Nov. 2, he downed a Bf-109 using the new K-14 gunsight. On Nov. 21 he led a flight of P-51s on an escort mission to Merseburg, Germany. As the bombers left their target, a large formation of enemy fighters struck. Commanding officer of 487th Fighter Squadron, John C. Meyer (now a lieutenant colonel) told Whisner to take a straggler in one of the enemy's three six-ship cover flights. In a linked series of attacks, Whisner shot down four FW-190s in the cover flight and <b>probably</b> <b>got</b> another.|$|E

25|$|Captain (Air Corps) William T. Whisner Jr., United States Army Air Forces, {{was awarded}} the Distinguished Service Cross for {{extraordinary}} heroism in connection with military operations against an armed enemy while serving as Pilot of a P-51 Fighter Airplane in the 487th Fighter Squadron, 352d Fighter Group, Eighth Air Force, in aerial combat against enemy forces on 21 November 1944, during an air mission in the European Theater of Operations. On that date, Captain Whisner led a flight of P-51s on an escort mission to Merseburg, Germany. As the bombers left their target, a large formation of enemy fighters struck. In a linked series of attacks, Whisner shot down four FW-190s in the cover flight and <b>probably</b> <b>got</b> another. With {{no more than two}} FW-190s left in the cover flight he had attacked, Whisner {{turned his attention to the}} main enemy formation, exploding an FW-190 that had not dropped its belly tank. Evading three FW-190s on his tail, he shot down another that was closing on one of his pilots. Whisner was credited with five FW-190s and two probables that day. His score later was revised by the Air Force Historical Research Center to six destroyed, making that day one of the best for any USAAF pilot in the skies over Europe. Captain Whisner's unquestionable valor in aerial combat is in keeping with the highest traditions of the military service and reflects great credit upon himself, the 8th Air Force, and the United States Army Air Forces.|$|E

[...] Although the river {{there is now a}} great deal better than it has been for 100 years, fish will probably not be able to live long. [...] These had <b>probably</b> <b>got</b> into the main river from small streams flowing into the Irwell. But I think it is real progress.|$|E
500|$|The {{identity}} of the Indians whom Fraser used as models is somewhat uncertain, as Fraser told various and not always consistent stories during the forty years he lived after designing the nickel. In December 1913, he wrote to Mint Director Roberts that [...] "efore the nickel was made I had done several portraits of Indians, among them Iron Tail, Two Moons, {{and one or two}} others, and <b>probably</b> <b>got</b> characteristics from those men in the head on the coins, but my purpose was not to make a portrait but a type." ...|$|E

500|$|The Romans {{built the}} fort on a {{naturally}} defensible sandstone bluff that overlooked a nearby crossing over the River Medlock. The area {{became an important}} junction {{for at least two}} major military roads through this part of the country. One highway ran east to west between the legionary fortresses of Deva Victrix (Chester) and Eboracum (York) the other ran north to Bremetennacum (Ribchester). In addition, Mamucium may also have overlooked a lesser road running north west to Coccium (Wigan). The fort was one of a chain of fortifications along the Eboracum to Deva Victrix road, with Castleshaw Roman fort lying [...] to the east, and Condate (Northwich) [...] to the west. Stamps on tegulae indicate that Mamucium had administrative links not only with Castleshaw, but also with Ardotalia, the nearest fort (12 miles), Slack and Ebchester; all the forts <b>probably</b> <b>got</b> the tegulae from the same place in Grimescar Wood near Huddersfield.|$|E
500|$|A {{television}} mini-series, The Legend of Billy Sing, was in post-production as of 2010. Despite {{some reports}} {{that it was}} based on Hamilton's book, the author maintained that he was never contacted by the film makers. Although Sing and his father were partly Chinese and fully Chinese, respectively, the mini-series portrayed them with actors of European ancestry. The director, Geoff Davis, was criticised for this decision. Politician Bill O'Chee, a member of the Billy Sing Commemorative Committee, said, [...] "When a person dies, all that is left is their story, and you can’t take a person’s name and not tell the truth about their story." [...] Davis has said, [...] "Whatever [...] genetic background, his culture was Australian. To me, he's very representative of every Australian whose parents were not born here. ... A lot of people are sitting at the back of this bus attacking the driver. A lot of people feel they own the story of Billy Sing. But they've <b>probably</b> <b>got</b> more resources than me—if they want to tell that story, then tell it." ...|$|E
500|$|As customary, {{the game}} {{began with the}} first of two rounds in which contestants {{answered}} questions to earn spins for the [...] "Big Board"; a correct buzz-in answer earned three spins, while a correct multiple-choice answer earned one spin. Larson's memorization of the patterns could not help him here, and he struggled early. On the second question, host Peter Tomarken asked, [...] "You've <b>probably</b> <b>got</b> President Franklin D. Roosevelt in your pocket or purse right now, because his likeness is on the head side". Larson buzzed in at this point and answered, [...] "$50 bill", after which Tomarken finished the question [...] "of what American coin?" [...] with the answer being [...] "a dime"; the other choice was [...] "a nickel". He did not buzz in again, answering the last two questions multiple choice and finishing with three spins, behind Long's four and Litras's ten. With the fewest spins, Larson went first. On his first spin, he hit a Whammy; however, on his next two, he hit square #4 for $1,250 and finished the round with $2,500. Long and Litras finished the round without a Whammy and won $4,080 and $4,608, respectively, putting Larson in last place.|$|E

500|$|... "Immortality" [...] {{generally}} received positive {{reviews from}} television critics. Noel Murray of The A.V. Club graded the episode an A-, explaining that [...] "after last week’s semi-misfire, it was reassuring to see Fringe back in good form this week, with a creepy case, a great villain, and a pertinent plot twist". Andrew Hanson from the Los Angeles Times enjoyed the [...] "fun" [...] {{scenes in the}} parallel universe, and stated he would not mind watching an entire show about their Fringe Division. IGN's Ramsey Isler called the victims' method of death in [...] "Immortality" [...] "one of the nastiest in recent memory," [...] and rated the episode 8.5/10. He concluded that he was [...] "quite surprised by this episode. The storyline with the Dr. Silva [...] and his beetles didn't hold my interest at all, but everything else in this installment was fascinating material that expanded the mythos of the series far more than I could have imagined." [...] Den of Geek's Billy Grifter wrote, [...] "What this show is now quite good at is lulling us into {{a false sense of}} security, before pulling away the rug rather smartly. If you follow the show, like me, you <b>probably</b> <b>got</b> a slightly déjà vu feeling to the plot, as it rode the previously saddle worn concept of a scientist who has lost the perspective to realise that he's killing people for science." ...|$|E
500|$|Following the {{announcement}} that the character had been written out of Grey's Anatomy, Mary Macnamara wrote a critical LA Times editorial on the decision. She deemed Smith's firing: [...] "a grim reminder that certain prejudices are still ascendant in television", writing that [...] "most gay characters are allowed to have sex on network television {{only if they are}} part of a single-episode story line, and all actively sexual lesbian characters must be sylphlike, gorgeous and preferably under 30." [...] She went on to assess that: [...] "Smith <b>probably</b> <b>got</b> the boot not because her character wasn't interesting enough or sympathetic enough but because she, especially when paired with Ramirez, just didn't fit the visual template of [...] "Grey's" [...] or indeed, of most of network television. She is a character actress, not a tabloid star. In other words, and they are words I deeply regret, Ramirez, with all her lipglossed lusciousness, may be beautiful enough to be bi, but Smith is not beautiful enough to be gay. At least not on network TV. Some ground, it would appear, is too calcified to be broken." [...] After Ellen's Dorothy Snarker was similarly critical of the decision, explaining that: [...] "Smith's dismissal means the loss of American broadcast TV's only lesbian/bisexual couple in primetime. It was also the first significant gay relationship portrayed on the hit ABC series. The handful of remaining lesbian/bisexual relationships on TV are on cable, premium channels and daytime television." [...] Detailing the decision to also change a new character's orientation from bisexual to heterosexual, Snarker added: [...] "Besides striking a serious blow for queer women's visibility on the small screen, the moves seem to signal a significant setback in the industry's acceptance of mainstream gay and lesbian storylines." [...] She concluded that: [...] "While Callie had fleeting moments of gay panic where she slept with friend and fellow surgeon Mark Sloan (Eric Dane), the interaction between the two women was both organic and romantic. Callie and Erica's relationship stood out as one of the few bright spots for lesbian and bisexual characters on primetime TV. Now it seems all we’re left with is taillights." ...|$|E
2500|$|Gillespie's biographer Alyn Shipton {{writes that}} Gillespie <b>probably</b> <b>got</b> {{the idea for}} a bent trumpet when he saw a similar {{instrument}} in 1937 in Manchester, England, while on tour with the Teddy Hill Orchestra.|$|E

Then, you see, his father, out of revenge, stole Dinah away." ...|$|R
2500|$|But {{the village}} green {{was also a}} metaphor, a [...] "Walt Disney" [...] fantasy of an ideal {{protected}} place of retreat that, as Davies has since opined, may rather have belonged on a solo album or personal diary; [...] "It’s all in my head, <b>probably....</b> Everybody’s <b>got</b> their own village green, somewhere you go to when the world gets too much." ...|$|R

"For {{the money}} that we shall have to pay," [...] said Mr. Camperdown, [...] "we might <b>probably</b> have <b>got</b> a dozen Bohemian ladies to come and swear that they were married to Yosef Mealyus at Cracow.

2500|$|I thought I {{had made}} it up. Then, rereading The Voyage of the Dawn Treader by C. S. Lewis, I {{realized}} that I had probably gotten it from the island of Terebinthia in that book.

2500|$|After Sverre's {{victory at}} Kalvskinnet, the war changed {{somewhat}} in character. The Trønders accepted Sverre as their king; {{the two sides}} were now much more equal in power. At some point, Magnus' party acquired the nickname [...] (Heklunger). Hekle is Old Norse for hood and is here probably meant to imply the traditional monk garb. The Heklungs thus <b>probably</b> <b>got</b> their name from their close connection with the church.|$|E
6000|$|... "So {{it ought}} to be by the brand," [...] another officer said. [...] "I took the two boxes from a {{cupboard}} that was locked up.

25|$|On 7 May 1817, a heavy gale drove Lord Eldon, Clay, master, onshore at Kirkwall {{while she}} was on her way from Sunderland to Quebec. Initial reports were that she would <b>probably</b> be <b>got</b> off, but that she had lost her rudder and was leaky. She was got off, but with so much damage that she was unable to proceed. The Register of Shipping still lists Lord Eldon in 1818, but no longer lists her in 1819.|$|R
2500|$|Nevertheless, Cowell {{said before}} the first live show that [...] "I think we could be heading for a train wreck," [...] {{referring}} {{to the fact that}} the public did not believe any of the final 12 this year were as good as Lewis, But he added, [...] "But if you take Leona out of the equation, they weren't that good last year.

2500|$|... "We {{were playing}} a Shield game in Queensland and I threw my arm out {{on the day before}} the match," [...] he recalls. “I lost a lot of power, and a lot of things I could do before I wasn’t able to do. So I {{probably}} changed my technique after that to get more side-on, but I <b>probably</b> <b>got</b> more back-on. I was coming in to bowl but I was facing the wrong way.

2500|$|In early 2003, Cousins {{injured his}} ankle {{in a game}} against Hawthorn but played on through five weeks of pain-killing injections. In Round 15, 2004, he injured his back and missed six games. Cousins said, [...] "That injury is {{something}} that I got over and am probably no chance of getting a relapse... The other side to it is, because I have played 10 years of consistent AFL footy, I've <b>probably</b> <b>got</b> an older back than someone my age". In Round 1, 2005, he dislocated a finger and missed one round after undergoing an operation. West Coast chief executive Trevor Nesbitt said, [...] "There's no doubt that he's at his best when under pressure and he's so resilient; he plays with injuries that other players wouldn't".|$|E
6000|$|... "I wouldn't make no fuss if {{they was}} to come out," [...] she said. [...] "Little Kensington would go under my arm, not theirn, an' I'd walk calmly with 'em to their home.
