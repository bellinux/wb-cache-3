40|$|A {{common control}} {{technique}} for limiting {{nitrogen oxide emissions}} is selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of NO, with NH,. The lifetime of the catalyst, which has {{a critical role in}} overall SCR system economics, is, however, limited due to deactivation by poisoning. A two-dimensional model was developed to describe poison accumulation and activity of an SCR catalyst. The model that has no adjustable parameters accounts for simultaneous effects of internal and external diffusion and chemical kinetics in the SCR process. A validation of the model is accomplished by comparison with data from two different SCR plants.

Then incompatibility between the Pd/ZSM- 5 core material and ZIF- 8 shell precursor was circumvented by surface modification using a layer by layer self-assembly of polyelectrolyte, followed by a subsequent two-step temperature synthesis process inducing the formation of continuous and well-intergrown ZIF- 8 shell.

FWCNT are modified with oxidative treatment (O-FWCNT), aniline coating (A-FWCNT) and N-doped carbon layer (N-FWCNT). RDE testing shows that A-FWCNT/PtRu outperforms both O-FWCNT/PtRu and N-FWCNT/PtRu especially at high temperatures giving 1. 5 times higher current at 60. °C. The <b>poisoning</b> <b>resistance</b> of N-FWCNT/PtRu is {{high over the}} temperature range, while O-FWCNT/PtRu and A-FWCNT/PtRu become increasingly poisoned with increasing temperature. Alkaline DEFC testing at 30. °C and 50. °C indicates similar dependence to temperature as in RDE tests. However, only N-FWCNT/PtRu can sustain currents for longer than 20 - 30. h during constant voltage measurement. SEM images of the catalyst layers reveal that both O-FWCNT/PtRu and A-FWCNT/PtRuform a dense structure with little pores for reactant and product transport explaining the quick performance loss, while large pores are formed with N-FWCNT/PtRu facilitating the transport.

A conventional Ni-Cr anode was coated with ceria using dip coating {{to form a}} rare earth metal oxide thin layer {{on the surface of}} the anode. Electrochemical studies of the Ni-based samples were performed in symmetric cells under anode atmosphere (H 2, CO 2, H 2 O and N 2 as balance) with 2, 6, 12, and 24 ppm of H 2 S by means of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The recorded data showed that the <b>poisoning</b> <b>resistance</b> was enhanced at low coating percentages of ceria; effects depend on H 2 S concentration and the applied load. These results were confirmed by electrochemical impedance tests where the cerium oxide addition appears through stable polarization behaviour up to 6 ppm of H 2 S, particularly in the mass transfer region. The protection is explained by the depression of poisoned Ni active sites and formation of a protective layer to the metal surface. The ceria coating layer is a potential solution to reduce H 2 S poisoning of MCFCs fuelled with biogas. Copyright © 2012, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|The {{catalytic}} hydrogenation of tetralin {{in the absence}} and presence of quinoline and dibenzothiophene was studied on bimetallic Pt–Pd catalysts supported on silica and amorphous silica–alumina (ASA). The proportion of Pt on the surface determined the activity given that the Pt–Pd catalyst with the highest proportion of surface Pt was the most active. In the absence of poisons, the electronegativity of the support correlated with the hydrogenation. In the presence of quinoline, {{the activity of the}} catalysts increased with the dispersion of the metal particles, whereas in the presence of dibenzothiophene, the acidity of the support controlled the activity. The observed effects of the poisons indicated the presence of two kinds of adsorption sites, that is, metal particles and Brønsted acid sites at the perimeter. The key contribution of acid sites for hydrogenation was confirmed by removing the Brønsted acid sites of the support. Reference Pt catalysts were more active than the Pt–Pd counterparts in poison-free feed. In the presence of poisons, the Pt catalysts were also more active than the bimetallic formulations with the remarkable exception of the bimetallic catalyst with the higher proportion of Pt on the surface. The bimetallic catalysts are more resistant to sulfur and nitrogen poisoning as well as to sintering. The <b>poison</b> <b>resistance</b> of bimetallic catalysts originates from the electron transference from Pt to Pd that yields weak adsorption of poisons on electron deficient Pt atoms.

40|$|Rh metal was {{implemented}} as a core {{component in the}} so-called three-way automotive exhaust catalyst (TWC) due to its excellent properties such as thermal stability, <b>poison</b> <b>resistance</b> and inert behaviour to react with any support materials. These catalysts are often loaded with small amount of promoter elements such as Ce and Zr that enhance their overall catalytic performances and catalyst lifetime. It is therefore desirable to develop new CeOx-based catalyst with both high redox activity and high thermal resistance. Samples of two surface coverages of rhodium on a non-porous high area alumina been synthesised; at 1. 6 Rh and 4 wt % Rh loading. Ceria and zirconia have been deposited on the pre-supported Rh catalysts by the controlled surface reaction between the reduced Rh surface and an organometallic precursors: Zr(acac) 4 and Ce(acac) 3, with different cerium : zirconium ratios: Ce:Zr; 1 : 0, 1 : 1, 2 : 1, 0 : 1. Ceriated Rh catalysts have been also prepared by a different synthesis method, wherein the ceria was deposited on ?-Al 2 O 3 and subsequently Rh metal was added. A series of Rh catalysts produced has been characterised ex situ by BET surface area measurement, TEM, STEM HAADF, EDX, XPS, and XAFS. The combination of Diffuse Reflectance Infrared Fourier Transform Spectroscopy (DRIFTS), Mass Spectrometry (MS) and Energy Dispersive X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (EDE) techniques in a synchronous, time-resolved manner {{has been applied to}} determine the complementary information about structural and kinetic changes of the chemical system throughout CO exposure and two catalytic processes: CO oxidation and the reduction of NO by CO in the temperature range between 298 K to 573 K. It has been shown that advanced characterisation techniques, used in the time-resolved, in situ manner were needed {{in order to understand the}} behaviour of these complex catalytic systems under operating conditions. The effects of the catalysts’ composition, temperature and pulsed gas flow on catalyst performance have been effectively mapped by the combined DRIFTS/MS/EDE studies. The synthesis procedure has been found to be crucial to achieve the desired interaction between CeOx and Rh particles. No enhancement of ceriated Rh catalysts was observed when ceria was deposited directly on ?-Al 2 O 3 (method I). The addition of each promoter element by the controlled surface modification procedure (method II) exhibits multiple effects on the catalysts performance. The DRIFTS/XAFS studies have confirmed that CeOx and ZrO 2 facilitate the protection of Rh particles against extensive oxidation in atmospheres of air, O 2 and CO. Larger Rh core particles of ceriated and zirconiated Rh catalysts have been observed when compared with undoped Rh samples. DRIFTS results indicate that by interaction of CO with Rh particles a significantly larger amount of linear CO species was formed on the ceriated Rh surface than in the non-ceriated Rh catalysts case suggesting the presence of predominant metallic Rh phase for that system.

30|$|Besides using biomass-based {{materials}} as alternative fuels {{to the conventional}} fuels, significant efforts are going on to utilize biomass and waste materials for several energy-based applications [7, 8, 9]. One major concern is the commercialization of clean energy devices such as Fuel cell (FC). A major hurdle in FC operation is the slow kinetics of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) occurring at the cathode. An electrocatalyst is required to speed it up, and conventionally, Pt/C is the material of choice for this. However, it is a costlier metal, and another major issue associated with it is the CO poisoning which degrades the operational stability of an FC [10]. A recent breakthrough in this direction {{is the use of}} porous carbon material (PCM) (synthesized using biomass materials) based cathode electrocatalysts to fasten the rate of ORR [11, 12]. Sun et al. [13] synthesized high surface area (1177.76  m 2 g− 1) PCM by carbonizing waste cornstalks at 1000  °C. It was observed that temperature and heteroatom dopants such as N greatly influence the number of active sites and operational stability of the PCM. N-doping in PCM is special as it induces charge delocalization and promotes the cleavage of O–O bonds to speed up the oxygen reduction process at the cathode of an FC. Pomelo peels were utilized to synthesize N-doped nanoporous carbons with a surface area up to 1444.9  m 2 g− 1 and high-doped graphitic-N content [14, 15]. Zhang et al. [16] carbonized bamboo leaves at high temperature to design an effective electrocatalyst with higher methanol tolerance, operational stability, and CO <b>poisoning</b> <b>resistance</b> as compared to Pt/C. Protein-rich fish scales were converted to porous nanocarbons via two-step pyrolysis method following some chemical activation and acidic treatment methods [17]. It is reported that the doped heteroatoms, high surface area, and inner architecture of the porous carbons contributed towards it. Similarly, coffee bean waste [18], napkin paper [19], and soya [20] have been used as precursors to synthesize PCM with 1213, 1839, and 1072  m 2 g− 1 surface area, respectively.|$|R
40|$|Abstract This {{dissertation}} {{is focused}} on investigation of comparative evaluation of structure, composition and electrochemical performance of new electrocatalysts approach Platinum (Pt) supported on metal oxides which are specifically Titanium suboxide and Titanium nanotube suboxide (TNTS). The Pt/MOx (M: Nb, Ti, Mn, Cu and Ni…) and Pt/TixO 2 x- 1 with intrinsic electrocatalytic activity, conductivity and excellent stability are studied in acidic media toward the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and methanol oxidation reaction (MOR). Specifically, a Pt thin layer (monolayer) is homogeneously deposited {{on the surface of}} TixO 2 x- 1 -Mo and TNTS supports by using different methods. For almost all applied methods the Pt atoms utilization, involved in the reactions, is very high. These efforts indicate that both the Pt morphology and the support structure can significantly enhance the catalytic activity and stability of electrocatalysts toward ORR and MOR. The interest in ORR and MOR is motivated by the application of these novel electrocatalysts at the cathodes and anode side, respectively, of proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). In fact, PEMFCs are extensively considered as potential highly efficient devices for clean energy production in many different applications, from portable to transportation and stationary. The mechanism of PEMFCs is to convert directly the chemical energy of hydrogen (or methanol) fuel and oxygen (air) oxidant into usable electrical energy. At the cathode (the positive electrode), a considerable amount of platinum is generally required to catalyse the sluggish ORR, because of its slow kinetics. Due to the excellent conductivity and high specific surface area, carbon materials are extensively employed in both the anode and cathode to support Pt electrocatalyst in PEMFCs. A major drawback of Pt/C electrocatalyst is at the cathodic site in which the electrode potential and pH are relatively high: carbon materials suffer corrosion (C + H 2 O → CO 2 + 4 H+ + 4 e-, 0. 207 V vs NHE at 25 °C) with consequent dissolution of Pt metal catalyst. Such a dissolution, which is an anodic reaction, causes problems of mixed potential formation at cathodic side with subsequent decreasing of the long-term stability of the Pt electrocatalyst performance and shifting the ORR reversible potential to lower values. This drawback is one of major technical barriers to the widespread commercialization of PEMFCs as energy source. Apart from carbon corrosion, in case of methanol as fuel, DMFCs suffer from methanol cross-over through the polymeric membrane, which causes a further reduction in electroactivity performance. In fact, the oxidation of methanol at the cathode involves the formation of intermediate products, mainly CO, which are strongly adsorbed to the surface of Pt-based catalysts reducing the number of active sites of Pt and consequently the ORR activity. These phenomena, together with the high cost of Pt, are considered the primary limiting factors to the developing the large-scale commercialization of DMFCs and PEMFCs. In order to overcome the problems associated to carbon corrosion and alleviate CO poisoning, this PhD thesis demonstrates the application of metal oxides, in particular the sub-oxide TixO 2 x- 1 -M, as a potential electrocatalyst support, promoting the electrocatalytic activity, stability and <b>poison</b> <b>resistance</b> of Pt electrocatalysts. TixO 2 x- 1, which is a non-carbonaceous material with high conductivity, stability and durability in acidic media, has great potential to be an alternative promising material to carbon supports for Pt electrocatalyst in order to further boost PEMFCs and DMFCs applicatio...|$|E

Sulfur resistance, as evidenced by no significant change in permeance, was correlated with the temperatures associated with the face-centered-cubic crystalline structure for the alloys in this study. The permeance of the body-centered cubic phase, however, was up to two orders of magnitude lower when exposed to H 2 S.

40|$|The Communicable Disease Center, a {{component}} of the Bureau of State Services of the U. S. Public Health Service, operates on a Nation-wide basis. Its primary responsibility is to assist States and Territories to develop and implement increasingly effective methods and techniques for the diagnosis, prevention, and control of communicable diseases. Headquarters and major facilities are located in the Atlanta, Ga., area. Specialized installations are maintained near Savannah, Ga., Montgomery, Ala., Thomasville, Ga., Newton, Ga., and San Francisco, Calif. In addition, field training centers, research projects, investigative study stations, and other types of field installations are operated in a number of places {{in different parts of the}} country, including Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico. This is a summary of major activities of the Communicable Disease Center during the fiscal year 1952. In its preparation there has been conscious effort to omit details, to emphasize composite end results, and to bring the varied activities of the several components into common focus. The information presented was abstracted from basic reports prepared by the headquarters units and from other official sources. Many of the projects dealt with were carried on in cooperation with other agencies. In some instances the CDC was the principal participant and in others its contribution was relatively minor. In the interest of clarity, and as an aid to those unfamiliar with the CDC and its operations, the integrated summary report is divided into two general parts: (l) General Activities, and (2) Activities Directed Toward Specific Diseases or Problems. This is not a precise grouping, nor is the list of items under the respective headings a complete catalog of activities undertaken during the report period. Rather, the intent is to indicate in general terms the scope, nature, and interrelationships of activities carried on in different areas of public health by the combined staff of the CDC.

40|$|Although Malaysian Barn Owls (Tyto alba javanica) {{were once}} {{considered}} vagrants, {{they are now}} the most common owl species in Malaysia. Their proliferation {{is largely due to}} the expansion of agricultural lands in which prey is abundant and nest boxes are made available for them to roost and breed. However, their role in regulating rodent populations is not fully understood and chemical control of rodents is concurrently being used in most plantations leading to other environmental problems including secondary <b>poisoning</b> and bait <b>resistance.</b> This study aimed to detect differential predation and functional and numerical responses of Barn Owls to changes in prey abundances, which are important determinants of effective biological control agents. Over 25, 200 trap-nights in an oil palm plantation, a total of 1, 292 individual rats were captured; these were mostly Rattus rattus diardii, followed by Rattus argentiventer and Rattus tiomanicus. Based on 203 owl pellets, the birds fed primarily on R. r. diardii, the species that was most frequently trapped. There was no clear selection of prey by Barn Owls with respect to size and sex of prey. There was a significant positive relationship between the relative abundance of rats and the number of owl pellets collected, and higher rat abundances during the owls’ breeding months. This suggests a functional and a numerical response of Barn Owls to changes in prey abundance. Although we found no evidence of differential predation by Barn Owls they did show functional and numerical responses to prey numbers. Hence they could provide successful biological control of rodents and this should be properly accounted in ecologically-based management of the oil palm agroecosystem which would minimize the adverse effects of chemical usage...|$|R
40|$|The {{process of}} {{biofouling}} of marine structures and substrates, such as platforms or ship hulls, proceeds in multiple steps. Soon after {{the formation of}} an initial conditioning film, formed via the adsorption of organic particles to natural or manmade substrates, a population of different bacterial taxa associates under the formation of a biofilm. These microorganisms communicate through a complex quorum sensing network. Macro-foulers, e. g., barnacles, then settle and form a fouling layer on the marine surfaces, a process that globally has severe impacts both on the economy and on the environment. Since the ban of tributyltin, an efficient replacement of this antifouling compound by next-generation antifouling coatings that are environmentally more acceptable and also showing longer half-lives has not yet been developed. The sponges, as sessile filter-feeder animals, have evolved antifouling strategies to protect themselves against micro- and subsequent macrobiofouling processes. Experimental data are summarized and suggest that coating of the sponge surface with bio-silica contributes to the inhibition of the formation of a conditioning film. A direct adsorption of the surfaces by microorganisms can be impaired through poisoning the organisms with direct-acting secondary metabolites or toxic peptides. In addition, first, compounds from sponges have been identified that interfere with the anti-quorum sensing network. Sponge secondary metabolites acting selectively on diatom colonization have not yet been identified. Finally, it is outlined that direct-acting secondary metabolites inhibiting the growth of macro-fouling animals and those that <b>poison</b> the multidrug <b>resistance</b> pump are available. It is concluded that rational screening programs for inhibitors of the complex and dynamic problem of biofilm production, based on multidisciplinary studies and using sponges as a model, are required in the future...|$|R
40|$|Poor (or low) quality {{medicines}} {{remain a}} crucial problem {{of public health}} around the world. They encompass falsified /counterfeit, substandard or degraded drugs. If proportion of 1 % is estimated in developed countries, they are globally about 10 % of counterfeit drugs according to Food and Drug Administration, with 30 % in low income countries and astonishing values (80 %) reported in some African countries. The consequences and dangers of such medicines are therapeutic failure, drug <b>poisoning,</b> microbial <b>resistance</b> or even death. For the pharmaceutical industries, there are loss of image, loss of financial income and employment. There is need to combat this scourge, {{but most of the}} time, means are very limited and even lacking. In this context, several means or tools are developed by the ULg Pharmacy Department including the simple ones including organoleptic tests, simple analytical tests such as analytical balance, pHmeter, thin layer chromatography (TLC), UV-visible spectrophotometry to the more complex including liquid chromatography (LC) coupled to UV-Vis detector, or to mass spectrometry, nuclear magnetic resonance, Raman imagery (RIM) and near infrared (NIR) spectroscopy associated with the principal component analysis (PCA). In this way, we have analyzed several suspected samples obtained via the public health authorities of the D. R. Congo, Benin and Rwanda after their seizure or through collaborations. The results are presented by therapeutic class, namely: analgesics: - by using LC and complementary information from victim patients, we were able to discover an abnormal presence of a benzodiazepine at very high doses in paracetamol tablets which was the cause of unusual adverse effects (sedative effects, polyuria and hypotension) in patients who have consumed it; - by using the NIR-PCA, we were able to elucidate the substitution of an excipient (glycerol) by diethylene glycol in paracetamol syrup which caused the death of a hundred babies. antimalarials: - we faced cases of arthemether-lumefantrine tablets which had no therapeutic effect. By means of TLC and LC, the absence of these two active ingredients was clearly demonstrated, but the presence of starch was revealed by RIM; - another case of quinine tablets that had no expected pharmacological effect was faced. The use of several combined techniques (TLC, LC-MS, NMR and RIM) allowed to detect the presence of a substance with an imidazole structure (antamoeba). antibiotics: - the case of amoxicillin powder which after reconstitution in hospital caused poisoning of the babies until death for some was investigated. The reconstitution of the suspension in the laboratory had revealed the misuse of hydrogen peroxide instead of distilled water; - we participated to a large-scale study (80 samples of amoxicillin powder) that showed 8 % of overdose. The cases presented indicate that there are effectively poor quality medicines and there is need to sustain strong collaborations while reinforcing appropriate measures to protect users.

Rising energy demands, {{depletion of}} fossil fuel reserves and environmental deteriorations, have spurred great interest in searching for energy conversion devices with high efficiency and low greenhouse gas emissions. Fuel cells powered by hydrogen (H 2) or H-rich fuels (such as methanol, ethanol, ethylene glycol, etc.) have been regarded as promising alternative energy conversion devices to ease our concerns about fossil energy and the environment. Among various available fuels, ethanol becomes a more attractive fuel compared with H 2 and other organic fuels. At room temperature, ethanol is in the liquid state and, unlike hydrogen, can be easily stored and transported using the current gasoline infrastructure with only slight modifications. Furthermore, it has more advantages than other liquid fuels including low toxicity, high energy density (8. 0 kWh/kg), biocompatibility and wide availability from renewable resources like from sugar cane, wheat, corn, or even straw and algae. Despite these advantages, the use of ethanol in fuel cells and ultimately realizing the commercialization of direct ethanol fuel cells (DEFCs) are still being hampered by several challenges, especially the difficulties from the development of anode catalysts which are listed as follows: (i) high cost of electrocatalysts. Platinum (Pt) is {{the most commonly used}} catalysts for ethanol oxidation, but as Pt is scarce and expensive, the high loading of Pt in electrodes becomes a critical obstacle limiting the successful commercialization of DEFCs; (ii) sluggish electrochemical kinetics; (iii) low <b>poisoning</b> <b>resistance</b> to reaction intermediates (like COads); and (iv) difficulties associated with breaking the C-C bond in order to achieve the complete ethanol oxidation to CO 2. Therefore, more active, selective and durable electrocatalysts have to be developed, and the preparation of multi-component (binary, ternary, or even quaternary) catalysts has been regarded as a promising strategy {{to meet the demands of}} the complicated process of ethanol oxidation. So far, a great deal of effort has been centered on modifying platinum by adding transition metals (M: Ru, Sn, Mo, Pd, Ir, etc.) to form Pt-M binary catalysts. It was found that the added metal can definitely enhance Pt activity for alcohol oxidation by the bifunctional mechanism or electronic effect between Pt and foreign metals. Alternatively, the combination of nanostructured Pt with functional metal oxides (FMO: such as CeO 2, SnO 2, TiO 2) has recently originated a distinctive class of electrocatalysts for DEFCs applications. The interaction between Pt and metal oxides was proved to have a critical influence on the chemisorption properties and ultimate catalytic behavior. Indeed, FMOs’ role has been claimed to improve Pt nanoparticles dispersion, and/or to supply hydroxyl species at lower potentials than Pt to accomplish the oxidative removal of COads (bi-functional effect), and/or to alter the electronic structure of Pt and thus lessens the adsorption strength of COads on Pt (the electronic effect). In this project, the work centers on developing advanced binderless, nanoarchitectured catalysts layers composed of the substrate (carbon paper, CP), the catalyst support (CNTs), Pt and FMO for DEFC applications. Two dissimilar materials (Pt and FMO) could be directly deposited onto the substrate by means of pulsed laser deposition. Four different FMOs (CeO 2, SnO 2, MnO 2, and TiO 2) have been selected and incorporated respectively in our binderless catalyst layer. It is well known that interactions of Pt with FMO can radically improve the catalytic performance of the Pt-FMO composites. In order to gain insight of the role of FMO in the catalytic behavior of Pt-based composites, FMO was incorporated into catalyst layer in two manners, namely layer-by-layer architecture and co-deposition architecture. The first architecture is fabricated by depositing Pt layer onto a layer of FMO. The second architecture is the co-deposition structure of Pt and FMO obtained by ablating both targets of Pt and FMO simultaneously. Furthermore, the optimization of each type of architecture was undertaken by varying the background gas pressure in the deposition chamber. Afterward, the prepared electrodes were firstly characterized by various physicochemical techniques including scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution TEM (HR-TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and micro-Raman spectroscopy. The electrocatalytic performance of synthesized electrodes towards ethanol oxidation was investigated by using cyclic voltammetry (CV), linear scanning voltammetry (LSV) and chronoamperometry (CA). Based on the results obtained, the correlation between physiochemical characterization and the electrochemical performance of corresponding Pt-FMO catalysts have been discussed and established. Specifically, as for the LOL structured catalyst layer, the porosity of the top Pt layer is varied with the morphologies of the underlying FMO layer which could be tuned by varying the gas background pressure. As a result, the catalytic performance of FMO/Pt towards EOR is affected due to the variation of the microstructure of FMO layer. Similarly, the gas pressure plays an important role on the physic-chemical properties of the co-deposits of Pt and FMO. The interactions between Pt and FMO have been found to be varied with gas pressure during deposition, and thus leading to different catalytic behaviors in the electrooxidation reaction for ethanol. Comparing the FMO-based catalysts of two different architectures, co-deposited catalysts exhibited superior EOR performance with respect to catalysts with LOL structure. This is mainly related to the higher interaction degree of Pt-FMO in co-deposited structure compared with LOL structure. Based on the results of binary Pt-FMO catalysts, ternary catalysts composed of Pt, CeO 2 and SnO 2 were prepared in an attempt to further enhance the activity and durability with respect to that of binary catalysts. The catalytic activity of our optimized ternary catalysts under low potentials is enhanced compared with optimized Pt-CeO 2 co-deposits but is still inferior to Pt-SnO 2 co-deposits. Further optimization work needs to be carried out. Furthermore, cathode catalysts for oxygen reduction reactions composed of Pt and FMO catalysts have been widely investigated, owing to the outstanding proton conductivity and the promoting effect of FMO demonstrated by the spillover phenomena of FMO to Pt. As is well known, synthesis method of catalysts plays a significant role in the catalytic properties of the resulting catalysts. Therefore, it would be an interesting study to examine the PLD-synthesized Pt-FMO catalysts for oxygen reduction reaction. In this doctoral project, it was found that the TiO 2 films synthesized under different gas atmosphere dramatically increased the electroactive surface area of Pt and enhanced its electroactivity towards oxygen reduction reaction as compared with bare Pt electrode. Unfortunately, I could not complete studies on all synthesized FMO-based catalysts towards ORR due to the limitation of my Ph. D. period. However, the initial work presented in this thesis could intrigue further studies on PLD synthesized FMO-based catalysts towards ORR. </p...|$|R
