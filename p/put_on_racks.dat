A deacon of Arbela, in the Sassanid Empire, he was arrested by the {{governor}} of Arbela, Sapor Tamaspor, and <b>put</b> <b>on</b> the <b>rack.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Virgin and martyr, {{suffered}} {{during the}} persecution of Diocletian, 6 February, 311, at Caesarea in Cappadocia. She was brought before the prefect Sapricius, tried, tortured, and sentenced to death. On {{her way to the}} place of execution the pagan lawyer Theophilus said to her in mockery: [...] "Bride of Christ, send me some fruits from your bridegroom's garden." [...] Before she was executed, she sent him, by a six-year-old boy, her headdress which was found to be filled with a heavenly fragrance of roses and fruits. Theophilus at once confessed himself a Christian, was <b>put</b> <b>on</b> the <b>rack,</b> and suffered death. This is the oldest version of the legend, which was later variously enlarged.|$|R
50|$|This action <b>puts</b> strain <b>on</b> the <b>rack</b> and pinion, pump, tie rods, and bearings, {{especially}} causes undue wear to the steer wheels, {{and can be}} exceptionally {{difficult in}} the absence of power-assisted steering. Although in most modern cars the steering components are sturdy enough to handle dry steering without taking damage, it is still not recommended due to stronger tire wear. This is the reason automatic parking systems are usually designed not to dry steer, although their design would be somewhat simpler if they used dry steering.|$|R

It was the thought of adding torture to this long-suffering man. All at once Cameron swore that he would not augment Warren's trouble, or let him stain his hands with blood. He would tell the truth of Nell's sad story and his own, and make what amends he could.|$|R
5000|$|The scheme {{might have}} been {{successful}} had Burghley not made use of a traitor, named Thomas Herle, to gain Baillie's confidence. Herle described Baillie as [...] "fearful, full of words, glorious, and given to the cup, a man easily read". Herle had also gained {{the confidence of the}} bishop, and a complete exposure of the whole plot was imminent when an indiscretion on Herle's part convinced Baillie that he was betrayed. He endeavoured to warn the bishop by a letter, but it was intercepted, and Baillie was conveyed to the Tower of London, where he refused to read the cipher of the letters, and was <b>put</b> <b>on</b> the <b>rack.</b> The following inscription, still visible on the walls, records his reflections inspired by the situation: [...] "L.

6000|$|In short, Hume argues that, if the faculties {{with which}} we are endowed are unable to {{discover}} a future state, and if the most attentive consideration of their nature serves {{to show that they}} are adapted to this life and nothing more, it is surely inconsistent with any conception of justice that we should be dealt with, as if we had all along had a clear knowledge of the fact thus carefully concealed from us. What should we think of the justice of a father, who gave his son every reason to suppose that a trivial fault would only be visited by a box on the ear; and then, years afterwards, <b>put</b> him <b>on</b> the <b>rack</b> for a week for the same fault? ...|$|R
50|$|Figure eights allow fast but {{controlled}} descent on a rope. They {{are easy}} {{to set up and}} are effective in dissipating the heat caused by friction but can have a tendency to cause a rope to twist. Holding the brake hand off to the side twists the rope, whereas holding the brake hand straight down, parallel to the body, allows a controlled descent without twisting the rope. An 8 descender can wear a rope more quickly than a tube style belay/rappel device because of the many bends it puts into the rope. Many sport climbers also avoid them because of the extra bulk a Figure 8 <b>puts</b> <b>on</b> the climbing <b>rack.</b> However, many ice climbers prefer to use the 8, because {{it is much easier to}} thread with stiff or frozen rope.|$|R
40|$|A {{method of}} {{modeling}} large-scale ASIRS-AGV systems is proposed {{in an attempt}} to describe the ASIRS precisely and flexibly in which a lot of items are stored and retrieved. The system considered in this study consists of the large-scale ASIRS with stacker cranes, the loopedtrack AGV system, aisle conveyors connecting these two systems, and incoming and outgoing conveyors. There are two major stages to model large-scale ASIRS-AGV systems efficiently and to execute simulation experiments. The first stage is to generate a simulation program by placing appropriate modules and inputting the selected parameters such as the number of banks, the number of bays, the number of levels of ASIRS, and the number of AGVs. The second stage is to perform simulation experiments. In the proposed model, every item number <b>puts</b> <b>on</b> each <b>rack,</b> the corresponding number of cases for each item, the time of arriving in the warehouse, and the time of departing from the system are stored and recorded. Generally, {{it takes a lot of}} time to build a complex program for a particular type of large-scale ASIRS-AGV system. It is found that simulation! animation models can be made quickly, by using a module-based modeling method developed in this study. ...|$|R
6000|$|It is {{pleasant}} to fancy how Walton and Bunyan might have met and talked, under a plane tree by the Ouse, while the May showers were falling. Surely Bunyan {{would not have}} likened the good old man to Formalist; and certainly Walton would have enjoyed travelling with Christian, though the book was by none of his dear bishops, but by a Non-conformist. They were made to like but not to convert each other; in matters ecclesiastical they saw the {{opposite sides of the}} shield. Each wrote a masterpiece. It is too late to praise [...] "The Complete Angler" [...] or the [...] "Pilgrim's Progress."

5000|$|More, however, {{writes in}} his [...] "Apology" [...] (1533) that he only applied {{corporal}} punishment to two heretics: a child who was caned {{in front of his}} family for heresy regarding the Eucharist, and a [...] "feeble-minded" [...] man who was whipped for disrupting prayers. During More's chancellorship, six people were burned at the stake for heresy; they were Thomas Hitton, Thomas Bilney, Richard Bayfield, John Tewkesbery, Thomas Dusgate, and James Bainham. Moynahan has argued that More was influential in the burning of Tyndale, as More's agents had long pursued him, even though this took place over a year after his own death. Burning at the stake had long been a standard punishment for heresy; about thirty burnings had taken place in the century before More's elevation to Chancellor, and burning continued to be used by both Catholics and Protestants during the religious upheaval of the following decades. His biographer Peter Ackroyd notes that More explicitly [...] "approved of burning". [...] Ackroyd adds that More tied heretics to a tree and whipped them, watched men <b>put</b> <b>on</b> the <b>rack</b> and tortured until they confessed and was [...] "personally responsible for the burning of 'brethren' at Smithfield". Another biographer, Richard Marius, maintains that More did everything in his power to bring about the extermination of heretics but not that More was personally active in burning them.|$|R
50|$|Thor Parker - The store's Social Marketing Manager and Events Director, who is {{in charge}} of {{arranging}} store events such as book signings, as well as selecting new books to <b>put</b> <b>on</b> the store's <b>racks.</b> Parker became interested in comics while in elementary school, through the Marvel Comics trading cards. He eventually gravitated to more independent comics, such as Daniel Clowes' David Boring and Art Spiegelman’s Maus. His favorite comics today are Sandman Mystery Theatre and the work of Johnny Ryan. His dream comic to own is Adventure Comics #40, which is the 1939 first appearance of the Golden Age Sandman. Parker began working at Midtown Comics after discovering that they were hiring while visiting friends in New York City from his native Tampa, Florida. He and Alex later appeared in Episode 6 of the VH1 reality series For What It's Worth, in which they appraised Tony Moore's original artwork for Page 7 of The Walking Dead #1.|$|R
40|$|It has {{recently}} {{become clear that}} power management is of critical importance in modern enterprise computing environments. The traditional drive for higher performance has influenced trends towards consolidation and higher densities, artifacts enabled by virtualization and new small form factor server blades. The resulting effect has been increased power and cooling requirements in data centers which elevate ownership costs and <b>put</b> more pressure <b>on</b> <b>rack</b> and enclosure densities. To address these issues, in this paper, we enable power-efficient management of enterprise workloads by exploiting a fundamental characteristic of data centers: “platform heterogeneity”. This heterogeneity stems from the architectural and management-capability variations of the underlying platforms. We define an intelligent workload allocation method that leverages heterogeneity characteristics and efficiently maps workloads to the best fitting platforms, significantly improving the power efficiency of the whole data center. We perform this allocation by employing a novel analytical prediction layer that accurately predicts workload power/performance across different platform architectures and power management capabilities. This prediction infrastructure relies upon platform and workload descriptors that we define {{as part of our}} work. Our allocation scheme achieves on average 20 % improvements in power efficiency for representative heterogeneous data center configurations, highlighting the significant potential of heterogeneity-aware management. ...|$|R

40|$|Coastal dunes, as a whole, {{represent}} a natural barrier between {{the sea and}} the land, playing a vital role in the coastal defense against the waves and tides. Compared to the use of hard, man-made structures, not only is it a less expensive method to counteract the coastal erosion problems, {{but it is also a}} method that has higher ecological and scenic values in the environmental management aspect. In this research project, a field experiment was conducted for dune reconstruction at the Ching-tsao-lun reach of the Tainan coast where the foredunes had been eroded and washovered by a previous typhoon. Three experimental sets were put up to re-build foredunes that have been previously damaged, and a small natural remnant dune was chosen as the comparison set for evaluating the effectiveness of the reconstruction of foredunes. The dune building processes were observed by monitoring the changes of dune profiles, surface sand grain size, and the vegetation density. The experiment results are used to create an appropriate dune rehabilitation suggestion for this area. The results reveal that a bulldozed artificial dune can raise the dune height immediately, and <b>putting</b> <b>racks</b> <b>on</b> the bare sand surface can help the accumulation of sand and the colonization of vegetation that will quickly stabilize the artificial foredune...|$|R
