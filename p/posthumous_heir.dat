500|$|In 1916, Landis {{presided over}} the [...] "Ryan Baby" [...] or [...] "Baby Iraene" [...] case. The recent widow of a {{prominent}} Chicago banker, Anna Dollie Ledgerwood Matters, had brought a baby girl home from a visit to Canada and claimed {{that the child was}} her late husband's <b>posthumous</b> <b>heir.</b> Matters had left an estate of $250,000. [...] However, a shop girl from Ontario, Margaret Ryan, claimed the baby was hers, and brought a writ of habeas corpus in Landis's court. Ryan stated that she had given birth to the girl in an Ottawa hospital, but had been told her baby had died. In the era before blood and DNA testing, Landis relied on witness testimony and awarded the child to Ryan. The case brought comparisons between Landis and King Solomon, who had judged a similar case. Landis was reversed by the Supreme Court, which held he had no jurisdiction in the matter. A Canadian court later awarded the child to Ryan.|$|E

However, in April 1809, the Tokugawa shogunate agreed to raising the status of Kuroishi to a full han {{as part of its}} agreement with Tsugaru Yasuchika over dispatch of troops to guard the Ezo frontier, and Chikatari saw his revenues increase by an additional 6000 koku, and allowing him to join the ranks of the daimyō. In 1825, he retired, turning administration of the domain to his adopted son, Tsugaru Yukitsugu. He died in 1849 at the clan’s residence in Edo.

5000|$|A {{broad sense}} of the term [...] "eunuch" [...] is {{reflected}} in the compendium of ancient Roman laws collected by Justinian I in the 6th century known as the Digest or Pandects. Those texts distinguish between the general category of eunuchs (spadones, denoting [...] "one who has no generative power, an impotent person, whether by nature or by castration", D 50.16.128) and the more specific subset of castrati (castrated males, physically incapable of procreation). Eunuchs (spadones) sold in the slave markets were deemed by the jurist Ulpian to be [...] "not defective or diseased, but healthy", because they were anatomically able to procreate just like monorchids (D 21.1.6.2). On the other hand, as Julius Paulus pointed out, [...] "if someone is a eunuch {{in such a way that}} he is missing a necessary part of his body" [...] (D 21.1.7), then he would be deemed diseased. In these Roman legal texts, spadones (eunuchs) are eligible to marry women (D 23.3.39.1), institute <b>posthumous</b> <b>heirs</b> (D 28.2.6), and adopt children (Institutions of Justinian 1.11.9), unless they are castrati.|$|R
