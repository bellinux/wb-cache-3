2500|$|Seven Pounds was {{promoted}} on a five-city tour across the United States in November 2008, screening in Cleveland, Miami, Dallas, St. Louis, and Denver {{to raise funds}} for food banks in each region. The film {{was promoted}} at a charity screening in Minneapolis in support of Second Harvest Heartland. Since screenings of new films usually took place in Los Angeles or New York City, the choice of cities was unconventional. Smith said, [...] "This is more like the old-school music tours. Different clubs, different cities, meeting people. You get in touch with what <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>feeling</b> and thinking, and it's much more personal when you're actually out shaking hands."

For example, the tweet “I was really scared yesterday!” should not be tagged as “fear”, since it relates to past events, while we want to know how <b>people</b> <b>were</b> <b>feeling</b> when the tweets were posted. Exceptions can be made to events that {{happened}} very recently, for example: “I just fell because sandy scared me”, which can be tagged as “fear”.|$|R
5000|$|Gerald Goffin (February 11, 1939 - June 19, 2014) was an American lyricist. Writing {{initially}} {{with his}} wife Carole King, he co-wrote many international pop hits of the early and mid-1960s, including the US No.1 hits [...] "Will You Love Me Tomorrow", [...] "Take Good Care of My Baby", [...] "The Loco-Motion", and [...] "Go Away Little Girl". It was later said of Goffin that his gift was [...] "to find words that expressed what many young <b>people</b> <b>were</b> <b>feeling</b> but <b>were</b> unable to articulate." ...|$|R

5000|$|Variety {{thought it}} was [...] "a beautifully crafted film with {{flawless}} performances and many splendid moments, yet the overall effect is a bit disappointing" [...] and added, [...] "While the day-to-day details are drawn with a striking clarity, Ephron's script never goes much beyond the mannerisms of middle-class life. Even with the sketchy background information, it's {{hard to tell what}} these <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>feeling</b> or what they want." ...|$|E
5000|$|Responding to a {{question}} about his song, [...] "I Made It", Rudolf elaborated on his own feelings regarding success. [...] "I think that 'making it' is something that you do in stages. There's a certain feeling of 'I made it' when you have a hit on the radio {{for the first time and}} <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>feeling</b> it and buying it and reacting to it at shows. But I've also set new goals since then." ...|$|E
50|$|Having resentful {{emotions}} towards {{others and}} the inability {{to be able to}} understand what other <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>feeling</b> seem to have an association with violence in paranoid individuals. This was based on a study of paranoid schizophrenics' (one of the common mental disorders that exhibit paranoid symptoms) theory of mind capabilities in relation to empathy. The results of this study revealed specifically that although the violent patients were more successful at the higher level theory of mind tasks, they were not as good at being able to interpret others' feelings.|$|E
5000|$|On {{hearing of}} his death, Carole King said that Goffin was her [...] "first love" [...] {{and had a}} [...] "profound impact" [...] on her life." [...] She went on to say, [...] "His words {{expressed}} what so many <b>people</b> <b>were</b> <b>feeling</b> but didn’t know how to say... Gerry {{was a good man}} and a dynamic force, whose words and creative influence will resonate for generations to come." [...] Barry Goldberg, who wrote many later songs with Goffin, said [...] "Gerry {{was one of the greatest}} lyricists of all time and my true soul brother." ...|$|R
5000|$|This is {{reflected}} in the lyrics: despite having turned [...] "ash into gold", <b>people</b> <b>were</b> <b>feeling</b> angst and fear of the future (40 Jahre zogen wir an einem Strang, aus Asche haben wir Gold gemacht/ (...) was vorher war ist heute nichts mehr wert). Heppner and Van Dyk then ask, where do the Germans stand, and answer [...] "we are we, we are one, this is just a bad period, and we won't give up" [...] (wir sind wir/ wieder eins in einem Land/ das ist doch nur ein schlechter Lauf/ so schnell geben wir doch jetzt nicht auf).|$|R

5000|$|According to singer Myles Kennedy, [...] "Lyrically, song {{reflects}} the frustrations {{that a lot}} of <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>feeling</b> with {{the current state of the}} world. The world is looking for trustworthy effective leadership and not this undignified dog and pony show that's really made a mockery of our system." [...] He claims that the song [...] "doesn't push an agenda; it simply expresses a very common sense of disillusionment people seem to be feeling at this point in time." [...] Regarding the song's musical composition, lead guitarist Mark Tremonti said that Kennedy originally came up with the song's intro, and a part he had been working on himself became the chorus. [...] It is also Alter Bridge's first time using 7 string guitars on a record. The song, like the rest of the album, was produced by Michael Baskette, who has worked with Alter Bridge since its 2007 album Blackbird.|$|E
5000|$|After {{the song}} [...] "This is America" [...] vaulted Tranchita into the {{political}} limelight he {{decided to run for}} the Michigan State House , district 32 in March of 2016. [...] Tranchita brought on a seasoned political team consisting of: Bruce Pfaff (campaign chairman), Kevin Tatulyan (camapign manager), Cindy Berry (chief strategist) and Mike Grover (field manager). Justin said the popularity of his song was responsible in part for his run he told The Detroit News, “Millions of people have responded to it,” Tranchita said of his song. “...There’s some angst, some anger, and <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>feeling</b> like their voices aren’t heard. I feel that. I’m a blue-collar guy, not some elitist or crony that wants to be in the ruling class.” [...] After a very hard fought race Tranchita was narrowly defeated in his first ever political camapign by six percent in the August 2016 primary.|$|E
5000|$|The Village {{has been}} unified by issues {{regarding}} the gay community, such as Section 28 {{in the run-up}} to it becoming law in 1988 and subsequently. Ian Wilmott, a gay Labour councillor, said, [...] "Section 28 was such a monstrous attack on civil liberties that hundreds of campaigners came together to oppose it. <b>People</b> <b>were</b> <b>feeling</b> besieged. We had no homeland, no part of the city. We needed somewhere ... It had {{to be more than a}} club. We willed the village into existence." [...] Additionally, raising awareness over the HIV/AIDS threat to the community have been [...] "integral to bringing the village together" [...] according to John Hamilton, chair of the Village Business Association.|$|R

5000|$|Environment {{sustainability}} includes {{concerns about}} {{the growth of the}} world’s population and the earth’s natural resources that may run out sooner than humanity is prepared for that to happen. Because environmental sustainability deals mostly with humans and the choices we make, psychologists can help in understanding the relationship between humans and their environment, as well as help devise changes that people would be willing to implement into their daily lives. [...] According to Mayer and Frantz, ecologists argue that feeling connected to nature and caring about nature is a fundamental key in having people adopt positive environmental and ecological behaviors. They believe people must care about something if they want to help save it! According to Restall and Conrad, understanding how people form a relationship with nature and how this relationship impacts a person’s attitudes and behaviors towards the environment can help in formulating changes that, again, people will be willing to follow. This is exactly what the CNS intends to measure. In order to have people agree with changes made, the changes must align with what people believe, and the CNS aims to get at what <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>feeling</b> and believing about the environment.|$|E
5000|$|Many {{scholars}} {{might have}} {{the assumption that the}} original traditions of Eloquentia Perfecta have been erased in the later century, both through religious and academic teachings. However, though the term has been altered to fit modern society communication, the traditional teachings of the topic are very much alive.  Through both digital technology and verbal communication, Eloquentia Perfecta continues to carry on the original goal of rhetorical eloquence to spread justice to all. Many of the Jesuit scholars have had to really adapt to new medians of expression and constantly have to recreate lesson plans for students to adapt to current societal standards. As stated by Morgan T. Reitmeyer and Susan A. Sci in their article, How To Talk Ethically: Cultivating the Digital Citizen through Eloquentia Perfecta, [...] "News is no longer something to simply consume; rather it is something to which we are compelled to respond within a wide array of media." [...] As social justice has become a social phenomenon for current day societies, mainly because news is so easily accessible through digital devices, <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>feeling</b> more compelled to speak with Eloquentia Perfecta to portray their message.|$|E
5000|$|Atwood, {{with respect}} to those leading Gilead, further stated: I don't {{consider}} these people to be Christians {{because they do not}} have at the core of their behavior and ideologies what I, in my feeble Canadian way, would consider to be the core of Christianity … and that would be not only love your neighbors but love your enemies. That would also be 'I was sick and you visited me not' and such and such …And that would include also concern for the environment, because you can't love your neighbor or even your enemy, unless you love your neighbor's oxygen, food, and water. You can't love your neighbor or your enemy if you're presuming policies that are going to cause those people to die. … Of course faith can be a force for good and often has been. So faith is a force for good particularly when <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>feeling</b> beleaguered and in need of hope. So you can have bad iterations and you can also have the iteration in which people have got too much power and then start abusing it. But that is human behavior, so you can't lay it down to religion. You can find the same in any power situation, such as politics or ideologies that purport to be atheist. Need I mention the former Soviet Union? So it {{is not a question of}} religion making people behave badly. It is a question of human beings getting power and then wanting more of it.|$|E

2500|$|Instead of the optimistic, rock-laced {{soul that}} had {{characterized}} the Family Stone's 1960s output, There's a Riot Goin' On was an urban blues, filled with dark instrumentation, filtered drum machine tracks, and plaintive vocals representing the hopelessness Sly {{and many other}} <b>people</b> <b>were</b> <b>feeling</b> in the early 1970s. The album {{is characterized by a}} significant amount of tape hiss – the result of Sly's extensive re-recording and overdubbing during production. Allegedly, most of the album's instrumentation is performed by Sly alone, who enlisted the Family Stone for some of the additional instrumental parts and friends such as Billy Preston, Ike Turner, and Bobby Womack for others. [...] "(You Caught Me) Smilin'" [...] and [...] "Runnin' Away" [...] were also released as singles, and performed well on the charts.|$|R

40|$|One way {{in which}} we figure out how <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>feeling</b> is by looking at their faces. Being able to do this allows us to react in the right way in social situations. But, are young {{children}} good at recognizing facial expressions showing emotion? And how does this ability develop throughout childhood and the teenage years? Children are able to recognize certain emotions very well when they are just 6 years old, but become better at recognizing other emotions as they grow older. At all ages, girls seem to have less difficulty than boys in recognizing emotions. Hormones that our bodies produce at puberty do not only influence how our bodies develop but also influence how our brains develop and how we change emotionally. Understanding more about the typical development of emotion recognition can guide us in helping children who have difficulties with these skills...|$|E

40|$|Purpose–The authors explore employees’ {{emotions}} {{during a}} structural change (merging departments) {{in the higher}} education sector. The purposes of this paper are to identify how employees’ perceptions shape their emotional responses toward organizational change; and the variation of collective employee emotions pre-merger and post-merger. Design/methodology/approach–This interpretative study uses phenomenography {{to better understand the}} phenomena of change. Findings–Employees perceived their experiences as being promising (an opportunity to look forward to), threatening (a threat to be carefully managed) or inevitable (unavoidable). Emotional responses are collective, with male/older/more senior respondents experiencing different emotions as compared to others. Research limitations/implications–This study is exploratory and is limited by small sample size, location and temporal specificity. Practical implications–Managers should recognize that employees’ experiences of change are perceived quite differently and therefore should not simply be lumped together as one homogenous group. This knowledge can be used to facilitate the change process by better managing employees’ emotions to achieve positive outcomes. Originality/value–Investigating emotions through an interpretive lens highlights new areas for improvement in the change management process. The authors are able to better understand why <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>feeling</b> positively or negatively toward organizational change and how and why their emotions shift over time...|$|E
40|$|Our True Feelings is {{the third}} in the trilogy of Etudes in Tension and Crisis. How do we know how we really feel? how can we tell how other <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>feeling?</b> do we always {{tell the truth about}} how we feel? do we always want to know how others are feeling? We take a view of {{emotions}} as messy, intangible, dirty things responsible for both the embarrassments and horrors of human existence, as well as for its colour and gratification. Drawn from a collaboration with neuroscientist Dr Guido Orgs, Our True Feelings presents findings from cognitive psychological research, examining how humans react, escape, confront, and are duped and seduced by our feelings. Intersecting and colliding with this are performance demonstrations of charged emotional states with images and sounds of travelling vapours. The result is a curious hybrid where performers that seem to be animating text gradually transform, sliding into their own compelling language and revealing an emotional physicality that raises more questions than answers. The tension becomes palpable as the safe rug of scientific knowledge slips from under the audience's seats. 55 mins. 3 performers. can accommodate various spaces and sizes...|$|E

500|$|The ROM {{image of}} {{the first version of}} Shadowrun {{contains}} a much more crude script, with more sexual suggestive and violent phrases. For example, one line is changed from [...] "morgue guys" [...] to [...] "chop shop guys". The game's distributor favored the less serious version for retail release, sparking indignation and conflict among Kidd and other members of Beam's staff. Kidd recalled: [...] "Beam Software was a madhouse, a cesspit of bad karma and evil vibes. The war was reaching shooting level; old school creators who just wanted to make good games were being crushed down by a wave of managerial bull. It was no longer a 'creative partnership' in any way; it was 'us' and 'them'. <b>People</b> <b>were</b> <b>feeling</b> creatively and emotionally divorced from their projects." [...] Shadowrun was ultimately completed by its deadline. Kidd credits this to the staffers abstaining from company meetings and workshops, and continually keeping management away from the designers.|$|R
50|$|After {{decades of}} {{suppressed}} culture, the <b>people</b> <b>were</b> <b>feeling</b> {{a great need}} to exhibit their ethnic identity - in part through religion. Quantitative research shows {{that for the first}} years after the establishment of the new laws, waiving any restrictions on religious beliefs and proclaiming full freedom of confessions, the country experienced a huge spike in religious activity of its citizens. Hundreds of mosques, synagogues, churches, and other religious structures were built in a matter of years. All represented religions benefited from increased number of members and facilities. Many confessions that were absent before independence made their way into the country, appealing to hundreds of people. The government supported this activity, and has done its best to provide equality among all religious organizations and their followers. In the late 1990s, however, a slight decline in religiosity occurred. The draft religion law being considered in June 2008 has raised international concern over whether there is an intention to meet general standards of freedom of religion and human rights.|$|R
