5|$|Tolkien scholar Mark T. Hooker has catalogued {{a lengthy}} series of <b>parallels</b> <b>between</b> <b>The</b> Hobbit and Jules Verne's Journey to the Center of the Earth.

5|$|According to the Prose Edda, {{the bridge}} ends in heaven at Himinbjörg, the {{residence}} of the god Heimdallr, who guards it from the jötnar. The bridge's destruction during Ragnarök {{by the forces of}} Muspell is foretold. Scholars have proposed that the bridge may have originally represented the Milky Way and have noted <b>parallels</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> bridge and another bridge in Norse mythology, Gjallarbrú.|$|E
5|$|Several {{scholars}} have recognised <b>parallels</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> philosophy of Pythagoras and Plato {{and that of}} the Upanishads, including their ideas on sources of knowledge, concept of justice and path to salvation, and Plato's allegory of the cave. Platonic psychology with its divisions of reason, spirit and appetite, also bears resemblance to the three gunas in the Indian philosophy of Samkhya.|$|E

5|$|Albrecht stated his {{original}} {{aim was to}} draw attention to the law, not to have Knut put down. In December 2006 he had taken legal action against Leipzig Zoo to prevent them from killing a sloth bear cub rejected by its mother. His case was dismissed on the grounds that humans raising the animal would have been against the law of nature. In response to the criticism against him, Albrecht said that he was merely drawing <b>parallels</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> two cubs. The publicity from this coverage raised Knut's profile from national to international.|$|E
5|$|Apologists also cite <b>parallels</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> scenes {{depicted}} on the facsimiles and several ancient documents and other Jewish writings, maintaining {{that there is}} no evidence that Smith studied or even had access to these sources. Examples include: the attempted sacrifice of Abraham and his subsequent rescue (a similar story was preserved in a Coptic encomium only translated into English in the 20th century), Abraham teaching the Egyptians astronomy (this is recounted in the aforementioned Coptic encomium, and is mentioned by Eusebius, quoting Pseudo-Eupolemus, in his work Praeparatio evangelica), and God teaching astronomy to Abraham.|$|E
5|$|At 24, she won {{the role}} of the title {{character}} in UPN's drama Veronica Mars, which was launched in the fall of 2004. Created by Rob Thomas, the series starred Bell as the seventeen-year-old anti-establishment high school student/detective. Bell drew on the <b>parallels</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> character of Veronica and her own life, since Bell's parents had divorced and her best friend had also died. The series earned acclaim from television critics, as did Bell's performance. Some critics asserted that her performance was overlooked, and deserved consideration for an Emmy Award.|$|E

5|$|Fears grew {{about the}} threat of French raids across England from the 1380s onward. The {{citizens}} of Norwich were particularly concerned about the potential of a French raid on the city, drawing <b>parallels</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> position of Norwich {{and the experience of}} Southampton, another trading city that had been devastated by a French attack in 1338. This threat, combined with the recent events of the Peasant Revolt of 1381 when the rebels had looted the city, encouraged the local government to improve the city's defences.|$|E
5|$|The Yomesh cult is the {{official}} religion of Orgoreyn, and worships light. Critics such as David Lake have found <b>parallels</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> Yomesh cult and Christianity, such {{as the presence of}} saints and angels, and the use of a dating system based on the death of the prophet. Le Guin portrays the Yomesh religion as influencing the Orgota society, which Lake interprets as a critique of the influence of Christianity upon Western society. In comparison to the religion of Karhide, the Yomesh religion focuses more on enlightenment and positive, obvious statements. The novel suggests that this focus on positives leads to the Orgota being not entirely honest, and that a balance between enlightenment and darkness is necessary for truth.|$|E
5|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} {{for the song}} was filmed at Dalston and Stoke Newington, London. It features Spears as a woman in upper society and follows her relationship with a criminal, played by her then real-life boyfriend Jason Trawick. Prior to its release, London officials criticized Spears for shooting scenes with a replica gun and glamorizing violence. The video received a positive response from critics, with some calling it the best music video from Femme Fatale. Reviewers also noted the <b>parallels</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> storyline and themes of the video with Spears's personal life.|$|E

5|$|The most {{important}} section of Eusebius' Historia on Philip's religious beliefs describes the emperor's {{visit to a}} church on Easter Eve when he was denied entry by the presiding bishop until he confessed his sins. The account is paralleled by Chrysostom's homily, which celebrates Saint Babylas, Bishop of Antioch, for denying a sinful emperor entry to his church; and quotations of Leontius in the Chronicon Paschale which describe Philip seeking penitence from Babylas for the sin of murdering his predecessor. Given the <b>parallels</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> accounts, most scholars believe that Eusebius, Chrysostom, and Leontius are referring to the same event (or legend).|$|E
5|$|The song {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} music critics, being compared to Cyndi Lauper and Madonna {{songs from the}} 1980s. The media have drawn <b>parallels</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> song's lyrical content and the romantic relationship that Stefani had with Tony Kanal, a fellow group member of No Doubt. The song was moderately successful on the charts, reaching the top 10 in Australia, the Czech Republic, and New Zealand, {{as well as the}} top 20 in Denmark, Ireland, Norway, the United Kingdom, and the United States.|$|E
5|$|With Anderson serving chiefly as {{executive}} producer, {{the majority of}} the writing input for Captain Scarlet was provided by Tony Barwick, who had previously written for the short-lived second season of Thunderbirds. Originally given the role of script editor, Barwick went on to pen 18 of the 32 episodes himself, and was also often required to make substantial changes to other writers' work. While discussing his approach to writing episodes in a 1986 interview, he drew <b>parallels</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> premise and characters of Captain Scarlet and those of Thunderbirds, suggesting, for example, that Spectrum was similar to International Rescue and that the character of Captain Black was like the earlier recurring villain from Thunderbirds, The Hood.|$|E

5|$|Anachronism {{is a major}} {{component}} of The Battle of Alexander at Issus. By dressing Alexander's men in 16th-century steel armour and Darius' men in Turkish battle dress, Altdorfer draws deliberate <b>parallels</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> Macedonian campaign and the contemporary European–Ottoman conflict. In 1529 – the year of the painting's commissioning – the Ottoman forces under Suleiman the Magnificent laid siege to the Austrian city of Vienna. Then also the capital of the Holy Roman Empire and called 'the golden apple' by the Sultans. Although far inferior in number, the Austrian, German, Czech, and Spanish soldiers marshalled to defend Vienna were able to force the enemy into a retreat and stall the Ottoman advance on central Europe. It is probable the painting's underlying allegory was inspired by the siege of Vienna, given its similarities to Alexander's victory at Issus. Some critics go further, suggesting that the inclusion of anachronism may have been an element of Altdorfer's commission.|$|E
5|$|During the Eastern Han, I Ching {{interpretation}} {{divided into}} two schools, originating {{in a dispute over}} minor differences between different editions of the received text. The first school, known as New Text criticism, was more egalitarian and eclectic, and sought to find symbolic and numerological <b>parallels</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> natural world and the hexagrams. Their commentaries provided the basis of the School of Images and Numbers. The other school, Old Text criticism, was more scholarly and hierarchical, and focused on the moral content of the text, providing the basis for the School of Meanings and Principles. The New Text scholars distributed alternate versions of the text and freely integrated non-canonical commentaries into their work, as well as propagating alternate systems of divination such as the Taixuanjing. Most of this early commentary, such as the image and number work of Jing Fang, Yu Fan and Xun Shuang, is no longer extant. Only short fragments survive, from a Tang dynasty text called Zhou yi jijie.|$|E
5|$|Scholars have {{frequently}} noted the <b>parallels</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> three hunting scenes {{and the three}} seduction scenes in Gawain. They are generally agreed that the fox chase has significant parallels to the third seduction scene, in which Gawain accepts the girdle from Bertilak's wife. Gawain, like the fox, fears for his life and {{is looking for a}} way to avoid death from the Green Knight's axe. Like his counterpart, he resorts to trickery in order to save his skin. The fox uses tactics so unlike the first two animals, and so unexpectedly, that Bertilak has the hardest time hunting it. Similarly, Gawain finds the Lady's advances in the third seduction scene more unpredictable and challenging to resist than her previous attempts. She changes her evasive language, typical of courtly love relationships, to a more assertive style. Her dress, relatively modest in earlier scenes, is suddenly voluptuous and revealing.|$|E
