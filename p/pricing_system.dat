5|$|Though these {{measures}} were established to counter {{many of the}} irrationalities in the Soviet economic system, the reform {{did not try to}} change the existing system radically; it instead tried to improve it gradually. Success was ultimately mixed, and Soviet analyses on why the reform failed to reach its full potential have never given any definitive answers. The key factors are agreed upon, however, with blame being put on the combination of the recentralisation of the economy with the decentralisation of enterprise autonomy, creating several administrative obstacles. Additionally, instead of creating a market which in turn would establish a <b>pricing</b> <b>system,</b> administrators were given the responsibility for overhauling the <b>pricing</b> <b>system</b> themselves. Because of this, the market-like system failed to materialise. To make matters worse, the reform was contradictory at best. In retrospect, however, the Eighth Five-Year Plan as a whole is considered {{to be one of the}} most successful periods for the Soviet economy, and the most successful for consumer production.|$|E
5|$|While many of {{the costs}} of fossil fuels are well known, others (pollution related health problems, {{environmental}} degradation, the impact on national security from relying on foreign energy sources) are indirect and difficult to calculate. These are traditionally external to the <b>pricing</b> <b>system,</b> and are thus often referred to as externalities. A corrective pricing mechanism, such as a carbon tax, could lead to renewable energy, such as solar thermal power, becoming cheaper to the consumer than fossil fuel based energy.|$|E

25|$|After the {{collapse}} of the OPEC-administered <b>pricing</b> <b>system</b> in 1985, and a short-lived experiment with netback pricing, oil-exporting countries adopted a market-linked pricing mechanism. First adopted by PEMEX in 1986, market-linked pricing was widely accepted, and by 1988 became and still is the main method for pricing crude oil in international trade. The current reference, or pricing markers, are Brent, WTI, and Dubai/Oman.|$|E

For this reason a successful diamond mining operation can't rely solely on the mass of carats recovered. The Kelsey Lake mine has produced some large stones.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{distribution}} and welfare effects {{of changes in}} block <b>price</b> <b>systems</b> are evaluated. A method is discussed to determine, for a Marshallian demand function, equivalent variation {{in case of a}} block <b>price</b> <b>system.</b> The method is applied to analyze welfare and distribution effects of changing water prices in the Metropolitan Region of S 3 o Paulo. Results show that there is a trade off between average welfare and income distribution. A pro-poor <b>price</b> <b>system</b> may result in lower average welfare than a flat <b>price</b> <b>system,</b> but in higher individual welfare for the poor. Moreover, there is a trade off between revenues for the water company and income distribution. Even though pro-poor <b>price</b> <b>systems</b> may not be as good for average welfare as flat <b>price</b> <b>systems,</b> their direct effects on poverty are important. Introducing pro-poor <b>price</b> <b>systems,</b> however, may have financial consequences for the water companies...|$|R

25|$|As part of Medicare's <b>pricing</b> <b>system,</b> {{relative}} value units (RVUs) {{are assigned to}} every medical procedure. One RVU translates into a dollar value that varies by region and by year; in 2005 the base (not location adjusted) RVU equaled roughly $37.90. Major insurers use Medicare's RVU calculations when negotiating payment schedules with providers, and many insurers simply adopt Medicare's payment schedule.

25|$|While {{the reforms}} were {{generally}} well {{received by the}} public, concerns grew over a series of social problems that the changes brought about, including corruption and nepotism by elite party bureaucrats. The state-mandated <b>pricing</b> <b>system,</b> in place since the 1950s, had long kept prices stable at low levels. The initial reforms created a two-tier system where some prices were fixed while others were allowed to fluctuate. In a market with chronic shortages, this allowed people with powerful connections to buy goods at low prices and sell at market prices. In addition, the money supply had expanded too fast. At least a third of factories were unprofitable. The government tightened the money supply in 1988, leaving much of the economy without loans.|$|E

25|$|Other major {{problems}} concern {{the labor force}} and the <b>pricing</b> <b>system.</b> There is large-scale underemployment in both urban and rural areas, {{and the fear of}} the disruptive effects of major, explicit unemployment is strong. The prices of certain key commodities, especially of industrial raw materials and major industrial products, are determined by the state. In most cases, basic price ratios were set in the 1950s and are often irrational in terms of current production capabilities and demands. Over the years, large subsidies were built into the price structure and these subsidies grew substantially in the late 1970s and 1980s. By the early 1990s, these subsidies began to be eliminated, in large part due to China's admission into the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2001, which carried with it requirements for further economic liberalization and deregulation.|$|E

For identical regulatory prices, free pricing under the reference system tends to result in a higher price for the brand-name drug. For identical price reductions of the brand-name drug, the lower reimbursement amount under the reference <b>price</b> <b>system</b> results in lower health expenditure, but higher financial exposure of patients.

25|$|The fame of the Vieux-Colombier {{seemed to}} reach its apogee in the 1922/1923 season. The house was filled for every {{performance}} and visitors to Paris complained of the impossibility of getting tickets to any of its offerings. Copeau organized a touring company to the provinces. Invitations to play in {{other countries in the}} off-season abounded. When Konstantin Stanislavski, the director of the Moscow Art Theatre, came to Paris in December 1922, he and his troupe were warmly received on the stage of the Vieux-Colombier. The influence of Copeau's principles to which he held without flinching was felt throughout Europe and the United States. Despite the fame, conflict arose. Jouvet, who understood the economics of the theatre better than Copeau, knew that a larger theatre and a more profitable <b>pricing</b> <b>system</b> were needed. His proposal fell on deaf ears. When he was asked to direct at the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées, he chose his freedom. Even Romains decided that the Right Bank theatres were more hospitable to his work after Copeau rejected one of his plays. Despite the problems at the theatre, the school continued to thrive. Copeau allowed his young charges to appear in a production of Gide's Saül as the masked demons that taunt the king played by Copeau himself. The critical reaction was quite positive. The season ended, as the previous ones had, with the Vieux-Colombier in debt.|$|E

[...] The tour featured a tiered <b>pricing</b> <b>system</b> for tickets; the most expensive ticket being slightly higher in price than the last tour, but the cheapest tickets, the general admission tickets, being lower. Playing larger capacity venues allowed the band to price tickets more conservatively and subsidise less expensive tickets with costlier ones. In the US, field level tickets were priced at $55, and approximately 10,000 tickets per show were priced at $30. The price points were $30, $55, and depending on the market, $90–95 and $250.
