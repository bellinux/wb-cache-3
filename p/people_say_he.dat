After his rehabilitation, he was originally offered a trial with League One side Brighton & Hove Albion, where he scored two goals in two reserve team games against Brentford and Leyton Orient. He left without an offer of a contract, but was offered another trial with League Two side Rotherham United, where he played in a reserves victory over Huddersfield Town. On 12 November, Roberts was offered {{a contract with the}} [...] "Millers". Manager Ronnie Moore commented: [...] "He's only 22 but has real talent... <b>people</b> <b>say</b> <b>he</b> comes with baggage but his attitude has been first class. I think he deserves a second chance." [...] Later in the month Roberts signed a one-month contract. The following month the option to extend Roberts' Rotherham deal {{until the end of the}} 2009–10 season was taken. In his fifth appearance for Rotherham, a 4–2 win over Yorkshire rivals Bradford City, he scored his first goal for the club in 'sensational' fashion by finding the net with a free kick from fifty yards out. However, in April 2010 it was announced he had been sacked from Rotherham for breaking club discipline rules several times. The club did not divulge what the final breach was; though the [...] "bitterly disappointed" [...] manager said that while the player was [...] "full of remorse" [...] his teammates would not be [...] "too sorry to see him go".|$|E

Crusty Hannah brought up his name as Mr. Hammond, and the Doctor--filling his everlasting pipe, meanwhile, and ordering Hannah to give him a coal (perhaps this was the circumstance that made <b>people</b> <b>say</b> <b>he</b> had imps to bring him coals from Tophet)--ordered him to be shown up.
