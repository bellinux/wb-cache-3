It was a satisfactory <b>performance</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> New Zealanders and Barrowclough was congratulated by American commanders for the division's work.|$|E

5|$|A soft {{opening weekend}} {{was held for}} the media and {{reserved}} guests, starting on May 28, 2010. The park had two opening ceremonies that took place on June 16 and on June 18, 2010. The Wizarding World of Harry Potter's grand opening ceremony took place on June 16 with book series author J. K. Rowling, and film series actors Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, Emma Watson, Michael Gambon, Robbie Coltrane, Tom Felton, Matthew Lewis, James and Oliver Phelps and Bonnie Wright, as well as Universal Orlando Resort officials, and representatives from the media. The ceremony, which was produced by Universal Orlando Events Production in conjunction with Thinkwell Group, concluded with a fireworks display and a <b>performance</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Orlando Philharmonic Orchestra, conducted by original series' composer John Williams.

5|$|Arsenal {{defeated}} Tottenham 1–0 on 25 April 2005, {{which meant}} Chelsea needed {{to wait on}} Saturday in order to mathematically win the title. Second position was the best Arsenal could aim for {{by the time they}} faced West Bromwich Albion on 2 May 2005. Goals from Van Persie and Edu earned a 2–0 win for the team and Arsenal beat Champions League finalists Liverpool at Highbury to all-but secure second spot. Arsenal recorded the biggest win of the league season, against Everton at Highbury. An inspired performance by Bergkamp helped the team win 7–0; he created the opening two goals and scored in the second half. Arsenal lost their final game of the campaign, away to Birmingham City. It was a lacklustre <b>performance</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> visitors, who equalised through Bergkamp after going a goal behind, but conceded in the 90th minute.|$|E
5|$|As a {{token of}} respect, {{prosecutor}} Klavier Gavin, Kristoph's brother and Apollo's rival, invites him and Trucy to attend a concert for his band, the Gavinners. During a guest <b>performance</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> diva Lamiroir, her manager Romein LeTouse is shot and killed in her dressing room. When Machi Tobaye, Lamiroir's pianist, is accused for the killing, Apollo, through an extensive investigation, discovers that Machi {{and one of the}} Gavinners, Detective Daryan Crescend, conspired to smuggle contraband into the country, and that Letouse, in reality an undercover Interpol agent, was murdered to cover it up. The case nearly falls apart {{due to a lack of}} decisive evidence, but Apollo is able to squeeze a confession out of Daryan by threatening to have Machi testify.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{construction}} delays at Estadio Centenario, Uruguay's first match was not played until five {{days into the}} tournament. The first {{to be held at}} the Centenario, it was preceded by a ceremony in honour of the Uruguayan centenary celebrations. The Uruguayan team spent the four weeks preceding the match in a training camp, at which strict discipline was exercised. Goalkeeper Andrés Mazali was dropped from the squad for breaking a curfew to visit his wife. One hundred years to the day of the creation of Uruguay's first constitution, the hosts won a tight match against Peru 1–0. Spectators praised Peru's defense, and {{this turned out to be}} the only tournament match in which Uruguay scored only one goal. The result was viewed as a poor <b>performance</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Uruguayan press, but lauded in Peru. Uruguay subsequently defeated Romania with ease, scoring four first half goals to win 4–0.|$|E

5|$|Black {{doubts that}} Winston is the killer, and while Hollis {{stays in the}} hotel, he visits the production's climactic shoot, set during a <b>performance</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> band Kiss. As he looks around him, the sheriff's body is thrown down from the rafters; as the pandemonium settles, Black realizes that horror films end with the leading lady being targeted—the killer is after Hollis. Racing back to her hotel, Black {{discover}} Hollis fending off a chainsaw-wielding Bianco. Black is able to subdue Bianco after Hollis disables the chainsaw; the actor then explains that he lacked Black's insight and had to commit the crimes {{in order to see}} {{through the eyes of a}} killer.|$|E
5|$|Despite Lee's {{hope for}} an early start, it took all morning to arrange the {{infantry}} assault force. Neither Lee's nor Longstreet's headquarters sent orders to Pickett to have his division on the battlefield by daylight. Historian Jeffrey D. Wert blames this oversight on Longstreet, describing it either as a misunderstanding of Lee's verbal order or a mistake. Some of the many criticisms of Longstreet's Gettysburg <b>performance</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> postbellum Lost Cause authors cite this failure as evidence that Longstreet deliberately undermined Lee's plan for the battle.|$|E
5|$|Final Symphony is an {{official}} concert tour featuring music from Final Fantasy VI, VII, and X. The world premiere took place May 11, 2013 in Wuppertal, Germany {{where it was}} performed twice by the Wuppertal Symphony Orchestra at the venue Historische Stadthalle Wuppertal. A <b>performance</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> London Symphony Orchestra took place May 30, 2013 in London at the Barbican Centre. It marked the first live performance of video game music by the London Symphony Orchestra, making a historical moment for the Final Fantasy franchise and video game music in general. At Final Symphony in Wuppertal and London, Nobuo Uematsu and Masashi Hamauzu were in attendance. At the performances by the Tokyo Philharmonic Orchestra, both composers talked about their work on the series on stage of the Tokyo Bunka Kaikan concert venue. Final Symphony Tokyo was the first video game music concert ever to be greeted with standing ovations in Japan.|$|E

In the US, Is This It entered the Billboard200 at number74 after selling 16,000units in the first week. 20,000copies were shipped in America per week from October 2001 to January 2002, when a <b>performance</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Strokes on nationwide TV show Saturday Night Live caused a temporary rise in sales.

5|$|Jordan's law {{enforcement}} is under {{the purview of the}} Public Security Directorate (which includes approximately 50,000 persons) and the General Directorate of Gendarmerie, both of which are subordinate to the country's Ministry of Interior. The first police force in the Jordanian state was organised {{after the fall of the}} Ottoman Empire on 11 April 1921. Until 1956 police duties were carried out by the Arab Legion and the Transjordan Frontier Force. After that year the Public Safety Directorate was established. The number of female police officers is increasing. In the 1970s, it was the first Arab country to include females in its police force. Jordan's {{law enforcement}} was ranked 37th in the world and 3rd in the Middle East, in terms of police services' <b>performance,</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> 2016 World Internal Security and Police Index.|$|E
5|$|Manchester United drew {{their first}} and only home blank of the season against Newcastle United, but made amends with a 3–2 victory over bottom team Blackburn Rovers. Defensive frailties, most notably from Schmeichel, were on show away to Sheffield Wednesday as the team missed {{the chance to go}} top of the table. A brace from winger Jens Niclas Alexandersson and a debut goal scored by Wim Jonk {{consigned}} Ferguson to his second defeat in the league and extended a barren run at Hillsborough; United had won only a single game in their last eight visits. On 29 November, Manchester United hosted Leeds United and a valiant <b>performance</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> visitors looked to have gained them a draw, after going two goals down in the first half. A moment of brilliance from Butt however secured the three points for the Red Devils and kept up the pressure on the challengers.|$|E

5|$|On September 9, 1965, Koufax {{became the}} sixth pitcher {{of the modern}} era, and eighth overall, to throw a perfect game, the first by a {{left-hander}} since 1880. The game was Koufax's fourth no-hitter, setting a Major League record (subsequently broken by Nolan Ryan). Koufax struck out 14 batters, {{at the time the}} most recorded in a perfect game (now tied by Matt Cain). The game also featured a quality <b>performance</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> opposing pitcher, Bob Hendley of the Cubs. Hendley pitched a one-hitter and allowed only two batters to reach base. Both pitchers had no-hitters intact until the seventh inning.|$|E
5|$|Since the redevelopments to Celtic Park and Hampden Park were {{completed}} in the late 1990s, Ibrox has had the smallest capacity {{of the three major}} stadiums in Glasgow. Rangers have since explored options to increase capacity. After opening the Bar 72 area in 2006, chief executive Martin Bain said that the scheme could be replicated in the Copland Stand. A report in the Daily Record in April 2007 claimed that Rangers were planning to increase capacity to 57,000, principally by removing the JumboTron screens and lowering the pitch to accommodate more seating. These plans were said to be dependent for finance upon improved <b>performance</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> team. In January 2008, Rangers announced that they were investigating three options to further develop Ibrox. One of the proposals would have resulted in a capacity of 70,000, by replacing three of the stands with a bowl-type structure. These plans were shelved by October 2008, however, due to the late-2000s financial crisis.|$|E
5|$|The 1938 {{performance}} of the suite by Koussevitsky and the Boston Symphony Orchestra, recorded on 78rpm discs, provided the only commercially available recording until {{the advent of the}} LP era in the 1950s; a <b>performance</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Cleveland Orchestra under Fritz Reiner in December 1945 was not issued until many years later. In 1951 Capitol issued Hermann Scherchen's recording of the suite with the Vienna Symphony Orchestra, since which many recordings of the work have been issued under a variety of labels. A 2008 edition of the Muze survey of recordings lists 19 available versions by orchestras from Eastern and Western Europe, Asia and the US. The version with baritone voice has rarely found its way on to disc; Vladimir Ashkenazy with the Sydney Symphony Orchestra and Andrei Laptev (2010) provide a recent example. A DVD of the Bolshoi Ballet production, featuring Raisa Struchkova and Vladimir Vasiliev, was released in 2007.|$|E
