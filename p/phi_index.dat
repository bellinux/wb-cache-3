40|$|Measurement {{of blood}} prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels {{resulted}} in {{an increasing number of}} performed prostate biopsies and the lower age-adjusted PSA threshold led to a larger number of unnecessary prostate biopsies. Today prostate cancer (PC) is identified in only 35 % of the patients with a total PSA level of 4 – 10 ng/ml and PSA-negative PC occurs in 20 – 25 %. Obviously, PSA as an independent marker has exhausted its diagnostic potentialities. The new PC markers presented in the literature indubitably deserve close attention and further investigation.  The most promising markers also include [- 2]proPSA and <b>PHI</b> <b>index.</b>  According to the latest evidence available in the literature now, [- 2]proPSA and <b>PHI</b> <b>index</b> are the best predictors of PC during both primary and secondary prostate biopsy. Some publications show it possible to use the <b>PHI</b> <b>index</b> in planning both primary and secondary prostate biopsies, by constructing risk normograms, in combination with other individual patient examination parameters, including those with the other latest biomarkers of PC. The use of [- 2]proPSA and <b>PHI</b> <b>index</b> in everyday practice can assist in increasing the specificity of PC diagnosis and reducing the number of unnecessary prostate biopsies. The apparent importance of the diagnosis of PC at its early stages (including that using the <b>PHI</b> <b>index)</b> made us investigate this topic.

40|$|International audienceIntroduction Early {{detection}} {{of prostate cancer}} (Pca) is a real challenge to reduce morbidity and mortality while avoiding over-diagnosis and over-treatment. The prostate specific antigen (PSA) is characterized by its imperfections justifying the evaluation of new serum or urinary specific markers allowing a better selection of patients at risk of developing aggressive Pca. Aim To compare the value of - 2 pro PSA and <b>phi</b> <b>index</b> to total and free PSA. Methods Serum sampled from 452 patients from two university centers {{were used to determine}} levels of PSA before performing biopsies. The patients were included in this study based on the PSA serum concentration between 1. 6 ng/mL and 8 ng/mL according to the WHO international standard. All biopsies were performed according to a standardized protocol consisting of 12 cores or more. Sera were analyzed centrally in one of the two institutions with on a single analyzer. Sera from 243 prostate cancer and 208 negative biopsies patients have been taken into account. Results Sera were analyzed blinded for total PSA, free PSA and [- 2] proPSA using Access® immunoassay method from Beckman Coulter. The Prostate Health Index (phi) was calculated using the formula phi = ([- 2] proPSA/fPSA) × sqrt (PSA). The median value of the <b>phi</b> <b>index</b> is significantly (P > 0. 0001) higher for patients with cancer (phi = 65. 8) compared to patients with negative biopsies (phi = 40. 6). At a given sensitivity, the <b>phi</b> <b>index</b> significantly increases the specificity of {{detection of}} prostate cancer compared to other markers. Conclusion The <b>phi</b> <b>index</b> currently appears as the best predictor of prostate cancer for patients with a total PSA between 1. 6 and 8 ng/mL according to the WHO standard. The improvement in specificity of the <b>phi</b> <b>index</b> over tPSA could reduce significantly the numbers of unnecessary biopsies.

To determine whether the compensatory insulin secretory response {{to an increase in}} insulin resistance induced by the glucocorticoid dexamethasone differs {{in women with}} PCOS and control subjects, we studied 10 PCOS and 6 control subjects with normal glucose tolerance. An oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and a graded glucose infusion protocol were performed at baseline and after subjects took 2. 0 mg of dexamethasone orally. Basal (Phi(b)), static (Phi(s)), dynamic (Phi(d)), and global (<b>Phi)</b> <b>indexes</b> of beta-cell sensitivity to glucose were derived. Insulin sensitivity (S(i)) was calculated using the minimal model; a disposition index (DI) was calculated as the product of S(i) and Phi. PCOS and control subjects had nearly identical fasting and 2 -h glucose levels at baseline. Phi(b) was higher, although not significantly so, in the PCOS subjects. The Phi(d), Phi(s), and <b>Phi</b> <b>indexes</b> were 28, 19, and 20 % higher, respectively, in PCOS subjects. The DI was significantly lower in PCOS (30. 01 +/- 5. 33 vs. 59. 24 +/- 7. 59) at baseline. After dexamethasone, control subjects averaged a 9 % increase (to 131 +/- 12 mg/dl) in 2 -h glucose levels; women with PCOS had a significantly greater 26 % increase to 155 +/- 6 mg/dl. The C-peptide-to-glucose ratios on OGTT increased by 44 % in control subjects and by only 15 % in PCOS subjects. The accelerated deterioration in glucose tolerance in PCOS may result, in part, from a relative attenuation in the response of the beta-cell to the demand placed on it by factors exacerbating insulin resistance...|$|R

40|$|Cette étude complète un travail antérieur (Schneider, 1993) qui a permis d'interpréter et de formaliser le modèle de {{compaction}} classiquement utilisé dans des simulateurs comme Temispack (Doligez et al, 1986; Ungerer et al., 1990). Le nouveau modèle présenté ici se distingue du précédent par l'introduction d'une composante viscoplastique dans l'équation qui décrit la compaction. L'ajout de cette composante {{permet de}} prendre en compte de façon macroscopique les phénomènes visqueux de la compaction comme la pression-dissolution. En utilisant des valeurs de coefficients de viscosité extrapolées à partir d'expériences de laboratoire, une étude de sensibilité montre que la déformation visqueuse est significative pour des bassins vieux de plus de 1 Ma. Certains tests montrent que le coefficient de viscosité peut être calibré simplement à partir de données de puits et d'expériences simples de laboratoire. À partir de données extraites de la littérature, il a été possible de calibrer un coefficient de viscosité de 2, 5 GPa. Ma (= 8 x 10 puissance (22) Pa. s) pour la craie. This article contains formulas (***) {{which can not}} be displayed on this screen. This study completes a previous work (Schneider, 1993) in which the compaction model that is conventionally used in models such as Temispack (Doligez et al., 1986, Ungerer et al., 1990), has been interpretated and formalized. The new model described here differs from the previous one by the introduction of a viscoplastic component in the formulation of the stress-strain relationships. The addition of this component, allows to take into account, at a macroscopical scale, viscous phenomena of compaction such as pressure solution. The volumetric rheology is then defined by the following system of equations:(***) where phi is porosity; sigma is the effective stress defined as the difference between the overburden weight and the pore pressure; <b>phi</b> <b>index</b> (m) is the maximum effective stress reached by the sediment during its burial. The elastoplastic parameters (Ee, Ea, Eb, <b>phi</b> <b>index</b> (a), <b>phi</b> <b>index</b> (b), <b>phi</b> <b>index</b> (r)) of function Beta can be easily calibrated from experimental data or from well logs data (Hamilton, 1959; Schneider et al, 1993). The viscoplastic parameters (µ index b, phi to the power of (min)) of function alpha can be calibrated from well logs data as shown in this study. They can also be extrapolated, for a given lithology, from experimental data (Gratier and Guiguet, 1986). A sensitivity analysis has been carried out with different values of extrapolated viscous coefficients. The viscous deformation is important (50 % of the total strain) for basins older than 1 Ma when the viscous coefficient is lower than a critical value of 10 MPa. Ma This critical value is equal to 100 MPa. M for basin older than 10 Ma and is equal to 1000 MPa. Ma for basin older than 100 Ma. With field data from Scholle (1977), it is possible to estimate the elastoplastic and viscoplastic parameters which define a chalk rheology. Assuming that chalk which had no suffer diagenesis, has been compacted along an elastoplastic path, it is possible to calibrate easily the elastoplasic parameters. Such a calibration can be also performed with laboratory measurements as suggested by Hamilton (1959). When chalk has suffered diagenesis, we assume that the present-day porosity versus effective-stress relationships, extracted from well logs, result both from elastoplastic deformation and viscoplastic deformation. With this assumption, chalk viscosity is evaluated around 2. 5 GPa. Ma. According to the sensitivity analysis, chalk pressure solution (viscoplastic deformation) is noteworthy (10 % of the total strain) for basin older than 20 Ma. In conclusion, this model allow to take into account, in a realistic way, pressure solution phenomena which participate to sediments compaction. The major hypotheses are : (1) the transport of species in solution can be neglected in regard {{to the size of the}} considered cells; (2) the viscous coefficient is constant for a given lithology; (3) mechanical compaction and chemical compaction depend on the same effective stress. In spite of these restrictive hypotheses, the model gives solutions which are physically acceptable...|$|E

40|$|Optimal escape theory {{states that}} animals should {{counterbalance}} {{the costs and}} benefits of flight when escaping from a potential predator. However, in apparent contradiction with this well-established optimality model, birds and mammals generally initiate escape soon after beginning to monitor an approaching threat, a phenomena codified as the "Flush Early and Avoid the Rush" (FEAR) hypothesis. Typically, the FEAR hypothesis is tested using correlational statistics and is supported when there is a strong relationship between the distance at which an individual first responds behaviorally to an approaching predator (alert distance, AD), and its flight initiation distance (the distance at which it flees the approaching predator, FID). However, such correlational statistics are both inadequate to analyze relationships constrained by an envelope (such as that in the AD-FID relationship) and are sensitive to outliers with high leverage, which can lead one to erroneous conclusions. To overcome these statistical concerns we develop the <b>phi</b> <b>index</b> (Φ), a distribution-free metric to evaluate the goodness of fit of a 1 : 1 relationship in a constraint envelope (the prediction of the FEAR hypothesis). Using both simulation and empirical data, we conclude that Φ is superior to traditional correlational analyses because it explicitly tests the FEAR prediction, is robust to outliers, and it controls for the disproportionate influence of observations from large predictor values (caused by the constrained envelope in AD-FID relationship). Importantly, by analyzing the empirical data we corroborate the strong effect that alertness has on flight as stated by the FEAR hypothesis...|$|E

40|$|AbstractFor {{education}} to be improved, {{there must be}} some indications of the efficiency in its developmental stages toward the ultimate objectives. In educational settings, the outcomes have traditionally been evaluated by authorities, i. e. by teachers themselves. Nowadays, parallel with the developments in teaching whereby students are seen as having more control over their own learning, the task of evaluation too is assigned to the students. In the present research, the effect of self- and peer-assessment was studied on Iranian university EFL students’ course achievement. The participants (19 and 21 students in self- and peer-assessment groups, respectively, and all from Urmia University) were pretested on their current Teaching Methods knowledge (based on Techniques and Principles in Language Teaching, Larsen-Freeman, 2006). After receiving relevant instruction and training, while the peer-assessment group was engaged in peer-assessment activities for four sessions, the self-assessment group was busy with self-assessment tasks. An achievement post-test (with <b>phi</b> dependability <b>index</b> of. 90) was used to gauge performance differences {{at the end of the}} course. The application of ANCOVA indicated that the peer-assessment group outperformed the self- assessment group significantly, F(1, 37) = 7. 13, P =. 01. Further findings and implications are discussed in the paper...|$|R
40|$|The {{hydrograph}} at {{the watershed}} outlet was simulated using the time-area curve concept implemented in a {{geographic information system}} (GIS). The goal {{of this study was}} to determine if hydrograph prediction accuracy would be improved by accounting for spatial and temporal variation of excess rainfall. Three models with different methods of estimating excess rainfall were developed: the Distributed Curve Number (DCN) model uses a CN for each cell, generating spatially distributed excess rainfall using the Soil Conservation Services curve number method (SCS, 1972); the Uniform Curve Number (UCN) model uses a single “average ” CN for the whole watershed, thus generating a uniform excess rainfall; the <b>Phi</b> (Φ) <b>index</b> model which uses the Φ-index method to generate uniform excess rainfall. With the aid of a GIS, the cumulative flow time to the watershed outlet is estimated for each cell in the watershed and the isochrones of equal travel time are developed. The time-area curve is developed in the form of an S curve. The spatially distributed 1 -hr unit hydrograph is derived from the S curve as the difference between the S curve and its value lagged by 1 -hr. The models used in this study describe the physica...|$|R
30|$|The {{majority}} of PSA screening for PC in Australia is conducted by General Practitioners (GPs) in the Primary Care Setting. The lack of clear guidelines may significantly impact clinical practice and negatively influence outcomes for patient’s physicians and healthcare systems. Therefore our {{aim was to}} examine the current practice of GPs and Primary Care Physicians in the use of routine DRE and PSA screening as part of opportunistic screening for PC. Furthermore, we aimed to identify any difference in screening practice between GPs by their practice setting (metropolitan and rural) and gender. In addition, we investigated the usefulness of the perceived utility of PSA adjuncts such as age PSA ranges, median PSA, prostate health <b>index</b> (<b>PHI)</b> (Stephan et al. [2014]) in the Primary Care Setting.|$|R
40|$|We propose {{an order}} <b>index,</b> <b>phi,</b> which quantifies {{the notion of}} ``life {{at the edge of}} chaos'' when applied to genome sequences. It maps genomes to a number from 0 (random and of {{infinite}} length) to 1 (fully ordered) and applies regardless of sequence length. The 786 complete genomic sequences in GenBank were found to have phi values in a very narrow range, 0. 037 +/- 0. 027. We show this implies that genomes are halfway towards being completely random, namely, at the edge of chaos. We argue that this narrow range represents the neighborhood of a fixed-point in the space of sequences, and genomes are driven there by the dynamics of a robust, predominantly neutral evolution process.

40|$|Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is {{recognized}} as an organ-specific marker with low spe-cificity and sensitivity in discriminating prostate cancer (PCa) from other benign con-ditions, such as prostatic hyperplasia or chronic prostatitis. Thus, {{in the case of}} clinical suspicion, a PCa diagnosis cannot be made without a prostate biopsy. [- 2]proPSA (p 2 PSA), a precursor of PSA, has been investigated as a new marker to accurately detect PCa. The aim of this systematic review was to discuss the available literature regarding the clinical validity and utility of p 2 PSA and its derivatives, p 2 PSA/fPSA (%p 2 PSA) and the Prostate Health <b>Index</b> (<b>PHI).</b> A systematic search of the PubMed and Scopus electronic databases was performed in accordance with the PRISMA statemen...|$|R
40|$|The length {{parameters}} of Anadara similis were estimated with length-based methods (ELEFAN I y NSLCA) in three communities of REMACAM (El Viento, Santa Rosa and Tambillo). The length class interval that generated the lowest uncertainty was 1. 5 mm. In the growth parameters estimation, L? {{was restricted to}} the confidence interval of 95 % of the highest predicted length, and k was restricted to values between 0. 10 - 0. 20 year- 1. The variability of the estimation was analysed with the jacknife technique. The growth parameters L? and k were unified for comparative effects with the <b>phi</b> prime <b>index</b> (?). The {{results showed that the}} NSLCA method has a better development in the growth parameters estimations of A. similis, while ELEFAN I estimated superior values in growth. The estimations of ? from the NSLCA varied between 2. 60 and 2. 88. No significative differences were found in the growth of A. similis between the three communities, obtaining average values of ? of 2. 81, 2. 79 and 2. 84 for El Viento, Santa Rosa and Tambillo, respectively. The results show that the species Anadara similis has a slow growth and that the NSLCA method combined with the jacknife technique is an acceptable approximation to estimate growth parameters...|$|R
40|$|Serum of 336 {{patients}} with primary prostate cancer (PC) with baseline total prostate-specific antigen level (totPSA) < 30. 0 ng/ml was tested for free PSA (freePSA) and [- 2]proPSA; %freePSA, %[- 2]proPSA, prostate health <b>index</b> (<b>phi),</b> {{and a new}} index APHIG calculated using lab tests and taking into account age, T stage and Gleason score from biopsy were evaluated. Obtained data was compared to tumor stage (pTNM) and malignancy grade according to the Gleason score based on the final histological report after prostatectomy. APHIG has statistically significant benefits compared to PSA-associated markers for differentiation of clinically significant subgroups of PC: pT 2 c/pT 3 a/pT 3 b; local indolent PC/local aggressive/locally advanced/PC with regional metastases; total Gleason score 5 – 6 / 7 (3 + 4) / 7 (4 + 3) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{position}} of the near-earth neutral sheet throughout the nightside region between R = 5 R(E) and R = 8. 8 R(E) is examined statistically using magnetic field data from AMPTE/CCE. As has been demonstrated previously, the latitudinal {{position of}} the neutral sheet is primarily controlled by the dipole tilt angle. The position also depends on local time, radial distance, and magnetic activity. These dependencis may be represented by the empirical formula MLAT = - (0. 14 Kp + 0. 69) /cos(Phi) /exp 1 / 3 (0. 065 R exp 0. 8 - 0. 16) DTA, where MLAT is the position in degrees of the neutral sheet relative to the magnetic equator, Kp is the 3 -hourly magnetic activity <b>index,</b> <b>Phi</b> is the magnetic local time in degrees (midnight = 0 deg), R is the radius in R(E), and DTA is the dipole tilt angle in degrees...|$|R
30|$|In the TPE, {{the grain}} yield under non-stress {{conditions}} had a moderate to high H value, ranging from 0.34 to 0.70 in trials 2 and 3, {{and a low}} to high H value under stress conditions (Additional file 2 : Table S 2). In the TPE, significant positive correlations were observed among plant height, panicle length, number of productive tillers, panicle harvest <b>index</b> (<b>PHI),</b> and spikelet fertility and grain yield under stress. Days to 50  % flowering was negatively correlated with grain yield under stress in the TPE (Additional file 4 : Table S 4). The grain yield and harvest index, HI (measured in TE) shared a positive and significant genetic relationship (results not shown). Interestingly, another secondary trait, PHI, also showed a significant positive correlation with the HI. However, the HI {{was positively correlated with}} grain yield under stress, measured within each environment only. The panicle HI showed significant linkage in all trials.|$|R
