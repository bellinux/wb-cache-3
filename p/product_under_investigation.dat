40|$|Disassembly {{planning}} {{has become}} an important strategic issue {{in order to reduce}} the environmental impact and increase the value of end-of-life (EOL) products. However, disassembly could be costly due to the uncertainties involved in the process such as process complexities and alterations, hence, finding an optimum disassembly sequence is an important issue that needs further attention. In this paper, a selective disassembly methodology for EOL products is presented, which was developed by modifying the methodology developed by Nevins and Whitney (1989) for assembly. A Java-based computer program has been developed to carry out the disassembly sequence generations and the winnowing process. A single-hole punch was used as a case study to explain the concept and the efficiency of the methodology. The major advantage of this methodology is to provide a graphical representation of disassembly sequences at different stages of the process, which allows the user to visualise the disassembly process. As one expects, once the <b>product</b> <b>under</b> <b>investigation</b> becomes complex, the number of liaisons, and consequently the generation of all possible disassembly sequences becomes a tedious process. The proposed methodology will speed up this process, and in addition, an expert system is being developed to make the judgemental process of winnowing faster and easier...|$|E

In modern times, human concern towards depleting {{fossil fuels and}} cognizance of ecological issues have led to new innovations {{in the field of}} Automotive engineering. One such outcome of the above process is the birth of electrical hybrid vehicles. The <b>product</b> <b>under</b> <b>investigation</b> is a combination of all wheel drive and hybrid system. A superior fuel economy can be achieved using hybrid system and optimized vehicle dynamic forces are accomplished by torque vectoring action which in turn provides All-Wheel Drive capabilities. Heat generation is inevitable whenever there is a conversion of energy from one form into another. In this master thesis investigation, a thermal simulation model for the product is built using 1 D simulation tool AMESim and validation is done against the vehicle driving test data. AMESim tool was chosen for its proven track record related to vehicle thermal management. The vehicle CAN data are handled in MATLAB. In a nutshell, Simulation model accounts for heat generation sources, oil flow paths, power loss modeling and heat transfer phenomena. The final simulation model should be able to predict the transient temperature evolution in the rear drive when the speed and torque of motor is supplied as input. This simulation model can efficiently predict temperature patterns at various locations such as casing, motor inner parts as well as coolant at different places. Various driving cases were tried as input including harsh (high torque, low speed) ones. Simulation models like this helps Engineers in trying out new cooling strategies.

Research on e-cigarettes is urgently {{needed in order to}} ensure that the decisions of regulators, healthcare providers and consumers are based on science. Methods ECLAT is a prospective 12 -month randomized, controlled trial that evaluates smoking reduction/abstinence in 300 smokers not intending to quit experimenting two different nicotine strengths of a popular e-cigarette model ('Categoria'; Arbi Group Srl, Italy) compared to its non-nicotine choice. GroupA (n =  100) received 7. 2 mg nicotine cartridges for 12 weeks; GroupB (n =  100), a 6 -week 7. 2 mg nicotine cartridges followed by a further 6 -week 5. 4 mg nicotine cartridges; GroupC (n =  100) received no-nicotine cartridges for 12 weeks. The study consisted of nine visits during which cig/day use and exhaled carbon monoxide (eCO) levels were measured. Smoking reduction and abstinence rates were calculated. Adverse events and product preferences were also reviewed. Declines in cig/day use and eCO levels were observed at each study visits in all three study groups (p< 0. 001 vs baseline), with no consistent differences among study groups. Smoking reduction was documented in 22. 3 % and 10. 3 % at week- 12 and week- 52 respectively. Complete abstinence from tobacco smoking was documented in 10. 7 % and 8. 7 % at week- 12 and week- 52 respectively.

Fundamental insights in its oxidation {{is of great}} importance to both our understanding of atmospheric chemistry, biological effects {{as well as the}} safety assessments in nuclear industry. The gas phase reactions differ largely in rate compared to the aqueous reactions. In this work, the mechanism for the aqueous reactions have been studied computationally using ab initio quantum chemical calcultions. Reaction barriers have been quantified and compared with experimental data in the litterature. Also, the absorbtion spectrum of one of the postulated intermediates is verified using TDDFT. Furthermore, ã-radiolysis experiments have been conducted to test a model for aqueous radical oxidation of ammonia by investigating the yield of one of the final products, peroxynitrite. The model consists of a large part of reported reactions relevant to the aqueous radiolysis of nitrogen containing solutions (with an emphasis on ammonia). The dependence of the yield on the chosen experimental conditions is compared to that calculated using the model. The results of the quantum chemical computations for the reaction with oxygen is in agreement with earlier experimentally reported absorption spectrum and rate of decomposition of a key intermediate, the aminyl peroxide radical. Both properties, however, only agree when a large enough number of explicit water molecules are included in the computations. The dependence of the results on the chosen number of water molecules as well as the level of theory is discussed. The evaluation of the model for radiolysis of aqueous ammonia shows that the current understanding of oxygenated systems where superoxide is in excess with respect to hydroxyl radical is good. For systems deficient in superoxide, the model fails to accurately predict the yield of the final <b>product</b> <b>under</b> <b>investigation,</b> peroxynitrite, and it raises the question whether some unknown process has been overlooked in earlier studies...|$|E

The percentual number of micro companies in Finland in 2013 was 93. 4 % of all the company sizes. The economist Samuli Rikama (2014), from the Ministry of Employment and the economy in Finland, stated in the annual Business Review that micro companies have indisputable significance in Finnish society promoting economic growth and employment and yet the field lacks attention in research and the importance of the sector is often seen trivial. This qualitative case study is investigating a customer-led development process in a micro company. The goal is to find out, how the selected service is appearing to the main customer segment and what are the developmental issues arise from the customers. The research is conducted an action research which goals for developing the existing operations model (Huovinen & Rovio: 94 − 95). The framework for development is attribute map by Gunther McGrath and MacMillan (2000 : 25). The research is also investigating the meaning of the development process for the case company in micro company context. The development process is conducted as an action research and it commits to the hermeneutic tradition is science. The hermeneutic perspective emphasizes interpretation and prospect of significance in a process which produces information of the reality as overlapping cycle. The data collected in triangulation consist of an owner theme interview, electric inquiry with the customers and a theme group conversation among different professionals. The data is thematized with an attribute map in collecting and analyzing the data. The results of the research propose that the developmental needs of the case company are related to marketing, communications, networking and web-sales.

The Asian honeys analysed had a carbohydrate composition within the limits set for honey by the Codex Alimentarius Commission, and had a disaccharide profile similar to honeys from elsewhere in the world. Kojibiose, and peaks corresponding to turanose/nigerose and turanose/maltulose, which are carbohydrates not common in nature, were present in all the honey samples analysed.

The homonuclear Correlation Spectroscopy (COSY) experiment which revealed scalar 1 H- 1 H scalar correlations was adequate for the structural assignment. The Heteronuclear Multiple Quantum Coherence (HMQC) experiment offered greater sensitivity on small sample quantities whilst the long range Heteronuclear Correlation (HETCOR) and Heteronuclear Multiple Bond Coherence (HMBC) experiments were essential for complete assignment of the quaternary groups.

In the context of normalising environmental impacts against the profile of an 2 ̆ 7 average 2 ̆ 7 Australian, this poses a unique problem, compared to other industrialised regions of the world. This study aims to use publicly available data on environmentally relevant emissions and non-renewable resource consumption in 2005 / 2006 to develop regional normalisation data for Australia, at both inventory and characterisation levels...|$|R
40|$|Diabetes {{mellitus}} (DM) {{is currently}} ranked among {{leading causes of}} death worldwide in which type 2 DM is reaching an epidemic proportion. Hypoglycemic medications for type 2 DM have either proven inadequate or posed adverse effects; therefore, the Chinese herbal <b>products</b> are <b>under</b> <b>investigation</b> as an alternative treatment. In this study, a novel combination of fruiting body and mycelia powder of herbal Cordyceps militaris number 1 (CmNo 1) was administered to evaluate their potential hypoglycemic effects in high-fat diet- (HFD-) induced type 2 DM in C 57 BL/ 6 J mice. Body weight, fasting blood glucose (FBG), oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), and blood biochemistry indexes were measured. Results indicated that CmNo 1 lowered the blood glucose level by increasing insulin sensitivity, while no change in body weight was observed. Increased protein expression of IRS- 1, pIRS- 1, AKT, pAKT, and GLUT- 4 in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue was found indicating restoration of insulin signaling. Additionally, PPAR-γ expression in adipose tissue restored the triglyceride and cholesterol levels. Finally, our results suggest that CmNo 1 possesses strong hypoglycemic, anticholesterolemic, and antihypertriglyceridemic actions and is more economical alternate for DM treatment...|$|R
