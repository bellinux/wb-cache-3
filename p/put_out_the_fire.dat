5|$|On a clear, {{sunny day}} in July 1964, {{a group of}} six boys went {{swimming}} in the Roundout Creek at a park in Rosendale Village. After {{getting out of the}} creek, the boys were struck by lightning. One boy was knocked back into the creek, and regained consciousness as he was being pulled out. Two of the boys, Gary Schmitt and Ronald Morelli, died. Ronald Morelli was the son of Albert Morelli, who served as Rosendale's fire chief. Albert Morelli was part of the team that <b>put</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> at Reid's Village Inn.|$|E
5|$|This {{fire had}} more {{troubles}} {{due to the}} age and condition of the bridge; the wood trusses on the bridge were unsafe for firefighters to scale, due to the fire on the bridge ten years before. Louisville Fire & Rescue chief Greg Frederick decided that firefighters {{were not to be}} sent onto the bridge; a boat from the Harrods Creek Fire Department was used to <b>put</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire,</b> as Louisville's fire boat did not have a hose that could reach the blaze on the bridge.|$|E
5|$|After a long chase, the Flying Monkeys {{succeed in}} {{capturing}} their targets {{and bring them}} back to Evillene. Vengeful for Dorothy having killed her sister, she dismembers the Scarecrow, flattens the Tin Man, and tortures the Lion in hopes of making Dorothy give her the silver shoes. When she threatens to throw Toto into a fiery cauldron, Dorothy nearly gives in until the Scarecrow hints to her to activate a fire sprinkler switch, which she does. The sprinklers <b>put</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> but also melt Evillene. She is flushed down into her throne, the lid of which slams shut like a toilet. With Evillene finally gone, her spells lose their power: the Winkies are freed from their permanent costumes (revealing attractive humans underneath) and their sweatshop tools disappear. They rejoice in dance and praise Dorothy as their emancipator. The Flying Monkeys give her and her friends a triumphant ride back to the Emerald City.|$|E

5|$|On March 18, 2015, Chabad Lubavitch {{purchased}} a building previously {{owned by the}} Ossining Heights United Methodist Church, on Campwoods Road {{in the village of}} Ossining. Chabad Lubavitch plans to renovate the building significantly before making it its first permanent synagogue. In June 2015, Saint Mary's Episcopal Church announced its plan to close on July 5, after 175 years in operation. A new community center was in development since as late as 2013. The part of the Briarcliff Manor Public Library building that formerly housed the library was renovated to serve as the community center, with a completion date of 2016 and cost of $1,800,000. On December 12, 2015, the Law Park pavilion was damaged in a large fire described as arson; around 100 firefighters in multiple departments assisted to <b>put</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> that night. Damage to the structure was almost entirely confined to its upper level. The village government hired RGR Landscape to restore and improve the structure, reopening it on Memorial Day in 2017. Insurance covered the reconstruction, which retained the building's architectural style, and included a new concession area, an upper terrace with 280 donor-engraved bricks, bathrooms and walkways for ADA compliance, new lighting, and fire suppression and security systems. The village also planted new trees and shrubs replacing fire-damaged foliage.|$|E

They returned to Norman Wells and performed an emergency landing, but the aircraft left the runway and ploughed through the snow. The four crew were unhurt, but the aircraft was written off and the nose was later used to repair another C-54. The fire {{was caused by a}} fuel leak.|$|E
25|$|Fire was {{reported}} in room 306 by a nurse’s aide who pulled the fire alarm box. The alarm was received by the Chicago Fire Department at 11:43 A.M (CDT).

The first fire engine arrived {{at the scene of}} the fire 3 minutes and 40 seconds later as nursing home staff evacuated the burning building. More fire engines arrived seconds later as smoke was seen rising from the top of the building. At 11:46 A.M., firefighters fighting the fire, discovered the third floor heavily laden with smoke and trapped elderly patients in wheelchairs. The victims were immediately removed from the burning building and were transported to nearby hospitals.|$|E

25|$|After the United States entered World War II, Jackson was {{assigned}} to serve as crew chief aboard a B-25 Mitchell bomber. As a testament to his early flight aptitude, he substituted for a flight engineer who was sick for a training flight. During the flight, the right engine of the plane caught fire. The pilot of the aircraft {{not knowing how to}} <b>put</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> asked for Jackson's help which resulted in Jackson saving the plane and crew. Afterwards, Jackson decided to be a pilot. He successfully completed Aviation Cadet Training and became a commissioned officer.

25|$|Mowgli steals a lit torch at {{the village}} {{to use as a}} weapon and heads back to the jungle, accidentally {{starting}} a wildfire in the process. He confronts Shere Khan, who argues that Mowgli has made himself the enemy of the jungle by causing the wildfire. Mowgli throws the torch into the water, giving Shere Khan the advantage. Baloo, Bagheera, and the wolf pack intervene and hold Shere Khan off, giving Mowgli enough time to set a trap. He lures Shere Khan up a dead tree and onto a branch, which breaks under the tiger's weight and Shere Khan falls into the fire to his death. Mowgli then directs the elephants to divert the river and <b>put</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire.</b>|$|E

However, she was such a good person that the animals living around the temple began to help her with her chores. Her father, seeing this, became so frustrated that he attempted to burn down the temple. Miaoshan <b>put</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> with her bare hands and suffered no burns. Now struck with fear, her father ordered her to be put to death.|$|E

25|$|Macmillan's {{decision}} led {{to increased}} {{demands on the}} Windscale and (subsequently) Calder Hall nuclear plants to produce plutonium for military purposes. As a result, safety margins for radioactive materials inside the Windscale reactor were eroded. This contributed to the Windscale fire {{on the night of}} 10 October 1957, which broke out in the plutonium plant of Pile No. 1, and nuclear contaminants travelled up a chimney where the filters blocked some, but not all, of the contaminated material. The radioactive cloud spread to south-east England and fallout reached mainland Europe. Although scientists had warned of the dangers of such an accident for some time, the government blamed the workers who had <b>put</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> for 'an error of judgement', rather than the political pressure for fast-tracking the megaton bomb.|$|E
25|$|On March 15, 2015, a fire engulfed the convent's tallest bell tower, which pinnacles at {{height of}} 72 meters. The monastery had been {{undergoing}} major repair work and {{was covered in}} scaffolding. It took firefighters almost three hours to <b>put</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire.</b> The blaze reportedly affected an area of three hundred square metres, but it was restricted to the scaffolding and didn't do any damage to the historical building itself. The speculated cause of the fire was a short circuit caused by heat guns used for drying the facade. The press service for the Moscow cultural heritage department has blamed the fire on the firm doing the restoration work. However, Russian Deputy Culture Minister Grigory Pirumov said that heat guns were not in use on {{the territory of the}} convent and the bell tower had been disconnected from the mains power supply.|$|E

25|$|About 6 a.m. on 17 November 2010 a fire {{broke out}} on the vehicle deck of the MS Pearl of Scandinavia on its way from Oslo to Copenhagen. The ferry's fire {{sprinkler}} system <b>put</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> before any of the crew or the 490 sleeping passengers were injured and the ship could dock in Copenhagen under its own power. It was determined {{that the cause of}} the fire was a short circuit in the plug of an extension cord used to charge a rebuilt Nissan Qashqai, converted into a battery electric vehicle by the Sakskøbing based company A Future EV. The company owner was returning from Norway where the vehicle had started the approval process for general sale there, and had used an extension cord to charge the vehicle from a general purpose power outlet on the ferry. The ferry operator DFDS Seaways consequently prohibited vehicle charging on board its ferries while the investors withdrew their support for the vehicle company forcing it into bankruptcy.|$|E
25|$|In 218, Liu Bei {{launched}} a campaign to seize control of Hanzhong from Cao Cao's forces. He garrisoned his forces at Yangping (陽平; in present-day Ningqiang County, Shaanxi) while Zhang He stationed his troops at Guangshi (廣石). Liu Bei divided his thousands of elite soldiers into ten groups and ordered them to attack Zhang He's position at night. Zhang He personally led his men to resist Liu Bei's forces and succeeded in holding off the enemy. In the meantime, Liu Bei {{set fire to the}} fences at Zhang He's camp in Zouma Valley (走馬谷). Xiahou Yuan led some soldiers to <b>put</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> and encountered Liu Bei's force along the way and engaged the enemy.

According to the Weilüe, Liu Bei was fearful that Xiahou Yuan would be replaced by Zhang He as the commander of Cao Cao's forces in Hanzhong. He also expressed disappointment after learning that it was Xiahou Yuan, and not Zhang He, who was killed in battle.|$|E
25|$|On 23 August 1179, Saladin {{arrived at}} Jacob’s Ford and ordered his troops to shoot arrows at the castle, thus {{initiating}} the siege. While the archers distracted the men inside the fortification, miners were digging a tunnel to breach {{the stone and}} iron walls at the north-east corner of Chastellet. Once the tunnel was dug, Saladin’s forces placed large amounts of wood inside and set it alight. This process, called sapping, was a method in which the tunnel's supports were burnt away forcing the walls to eventually collapse under their own weight. Sapping initially failed for Saladin and his troops, so the troops were forced to <b>put</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> with buckets of water and were paid one gold piece per bucket to do so. After the fire was extinguished, the miners were instructed to relight the fire. At the same time, Baldwin, having learned of this attack, called for reinforcements from Jerusalem. However, communications between Baldwin and Chastellet were slow and, by this time, the siege had been under way for several days.|$|E
