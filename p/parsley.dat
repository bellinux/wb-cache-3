40|$|This diploma thesis {{presents}} {{the first study}} focused on the ontogenetic development of eocrinoid echinoderms in the Czech Republic. <b>Parsley's</b> work (2012) on ontogeny of the genus Gogia from south China is the model study. The aim of this thesis is a comparable study of ontogeny of eocrinoid echinoderms from Cambrian of the Barrandian area. Akadocrinus jani Prokop, 1962 was studied. Using detailed morphological description and measurement of various parameters, three different ontogenetic stages have been established: juvenile ontogenetic stage, mature ontogenetic stage and gerontic ontogenetic stage. Thecal height is the deciding factor for {{the determination of the}} specific ontogenetic stage. Further, during ontogeny of this species some trends in changes in the size of body parts are observed (e. g., changes in the diameter of thecal plates). In-depth study of morphological details showed that the originally distinguished two species, Akadocrinus jani Prokop, 1962 and Akadocrinus nuncius Prokop, 1962, represent one species only. Keywords: eocrinoid echinoderms, Akadocrinus jani, ontogeny...|$|R
