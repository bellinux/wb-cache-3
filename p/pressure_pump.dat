25|$|Water {{is drawn}} {{in through the}} mouth by closing the {{operculum}} (gill cover), and enlarging the mouth cavity (Fig. 23). Simultaneously the gill chambers enlarge, producing a lower pressure there than in the mouth causing water to flow over the gills. The mouth cavity then contracts inducing {{the closure of the}} passive oral valves, thereby preventing the back-flow of water from the mouth (Fig. 23). The water in the mouth is, instead, forced over the gills, while the gill chambers contract emptying the water they contain through the opercular openings (Fig. 23). Back-flow into the gill chamber during the inhalatory phase is prevented by a membrane along the ventroposterior border of the operculum (diagram on the left in Fig. 23). Thus the mouth cavity and gill chambers act alternately as suction pump and <b>pressure</b> <b>pump</b> to maintain a steady flow of water over the gills in one direction. Since the blood in the lamellar capillaries flows in the opposite direction to that of the water, the consequent countercurrent flow of blood and water maintains steep concentration gradients for oxygen and carbon dioxide along the entire length of each capillary (lower diagram in Fig.22). Oxygen is therefore able to continually diffuse down its gradient into the blood, and the carbon dioxide down its gradient into the water. Although countercurrent exchange systems theoretically allow an almost complete transfer of a respiratory gas {{from one side of the}} exchanger to the other, in fish less than 80% of the oxygen in the water flowing over the gills is generally transferred to the blood.|$|E

In the experiments conducted by Haldon in 2002 for the episode [...] "Fireship" [...] of the television series Machines Times Forgot, even modern welding techniques failed to secure adequate insulation of the bronze tank under pressure.

2500|$|In HPLC, {{typically}} 20 μl of {{the sample}} of interest are injected into the mobile phase stream delivered by a high <b>pressure</b> <b>pump.</b> The mobile phase containing the analytes permeates through the stationary phase bed in a definite direction.The components of the mixture are separated depending on their chemical affinity with the mobile and stationary phases. The separation occurs after repeated sorption and desorption steps occurring when the liquid interacts with the stationary bed. The liquid solvent (mobile phase) is delivered under high pressure (up to 400 bar or 300.000 torr) into a packed column containing the stationary phase. The high pressure is necessary to achieve a constant flow rate for reproducible chromatography experiments. Depending on the partitioning between the mobile and stationary phases, the components {{of the sample}} will flow out of the column at different times. The column is the most important component of the LC system and is designed to withstand the high pressure of the liquid. Conventional LC columns [...] are 100–300mm long with outer diameter of 6.4mm (1/4 inch) and internal diameter of 3.0-4.6mm. [...] For applications involving LC-MS, the length of chromatography columns can be shorter (30–50mm) with 3-5 μm diameter packing particles. In addition to the conventional model, other LC columns are the narrowbore, microbore, microcapillary, and nano-LC models. These columns have smaller internal diameters, allow for a more efficient separation, and handle liquid flows under 1 ml/ min (the conventional flow-rate). [...] In order to improve separation efficiency and peak resolution, ultra performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) can be used instead of HPLC. This LC variant uses columns packed with [...] smaller silica particles (~1.7 μm diameter) and requires higher operating pressures in the range of 310.000 to 775.000 torr (6000 to 15000 psi).|$|E

40|$|Atmospheric {{turbulence}} {{can affect}} soil gas transport, and thus violates {{the assumption that}} molecular diffusion is the only relevant transport mechanism in the soil. Due to the oscillating character of turbulence-induced <b>pressure</b> <b>pumping</b> the net vertical air flow into/out of the soil is zero. Yet, the dispersion processes induced by the oscillating air movement in the soil pores enhance the gas exchange in the soil, and should be considered when the gradient method is applied. We developed a simple lab method to test the impact of turbulence-driven <b>pressure</b> <b>pumping</b> on soil gas transport using neon as a tracer gas. The experiment was conducted using soil core samples from three contrasting forest sites. The ratio of air permeability and air-filled pore-volume, k(a) /epsilon, {{was found to be}} suitable to assess the sensitivity of soil gas transport to the pressure-pumping effect. The pressure-pumping effect reached up to 60 % of the diffusive flux rates depending on the intensity of <b>pressure</b> <b>pumping.</b> We conclude that the turbulence effect can substantially influence soil gas transport in field studies, especially at sites with a high k(a) /epsilon value > 1000 mu m(2). Therefore, we recommend taking this effect into account when soil gas flux is determined using the gradient method...|$|R
5000|$|Improved pump {{efficiency}} to maintain oil {{supply to the}} engine. Since scavenge pumps are typically mounted at the lowest point on the engine, the oil flows into the pump intake by gravity {{rather than having to}} be lifted up into the intake of the pump as in a wet-sump. Furthermore, scavenge pumps can be of a design that is more tolerant of entrapped gasses than the typical <b>pressure</b> <b>pump,</b> which can lose suction if too much air mixes into the oil. Since the <b>pressure</b> <b>pump</b> is typically lower than the external oil tank, it always has a positive pressure on its suction regardless of cornering forces.|$|E

50|$|Engines {{are both}} {{lubricated}} and cooled by oil that circulates throughout the engine, feeding various bearings and other moving parts and then draining, via gravity, into the sump {{at the base}} of the engine. In the wet-sump system of most production automobile engines, a pump collects this oil from the sump and directly circulates it back through the engine. In a dry-sump, the oil still falls to the base of the engine, however instead of collecting in a reservoir-style oil sump, it falls into a much shallower sump, where one or more scavenge pumps draw it away and transfer it to a (usually external) reservoir, where it is both cooled and de-aerated before being recirculated through the engine by a <b>pressure</b> <b>pump.</b> Dry-sump designs frequently mount the <b>pressure</b> <b>pump</b> and scavenge pumps on a common crankshaft, so that one pulley at the front of the system can run as many pumps as the engine design requires. It is common practice to have one scavenge pump per crankcase section, however in the case of inverted engines (aircraft engine) it is necessary to employ separate scavenge pumps for each cylinder bank. Therefore, an inverted V engine would have a minimum of two scavenge pumps and a <b>pressure</b> <b>pump</b> in the pump stack.|$|E
