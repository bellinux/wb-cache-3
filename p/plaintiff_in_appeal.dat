50|$|The <b>plaintiffs</b> <b>in</b> Jackson <b>appealed</b> Judge Kay's ruling to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, now restyled as Jackson v. Fuddy. The {{appeal was}} {{initially}} {{scheduled to be}} heard on a parallel track with a similar Nevada case before the same court, Sevcik v. Sandoval until both cases were placed on hold, pending Supreme Court decisions in two other same-sex marriage cases, Perry and Windsor. Those cases were resolved on June 26, 2013, and on November 13, Hawaii enacted the Hawaii Marriage Equality Act, ending its ban on same-sex marriage.|$|R
50|$|During the American Revolution, the Commonwealth of Virginia enacted {{legislation}} that {{allowed it to}} confiscate Loyalists' property. Here, the original suit was an action of ejectment brought in Virginia state court for the recovery {{of land in the}} state known as the Northern Neck Proprietary. A declaration in ejectment was served in April 1791 on the tenants in possession of the land. Denny Fairfax (late Denny Martin) was a British subject who held the land under the devise of Lord Thomas Fairfax. Denny Martin was admitted to defend the suit and plead the general issue upon the usual terms of confessing lease, entry, and ouster. Martin agreed to assert only claim to the title. The facts being settled {{in the form of a}} case agreed to be taken and considered as a special verdict, the court, on consideration thereof, gave judgment in favor of the defendant in ejectment on April 24, 1794. From that judgment the <b>plaintiff</b> <b>in</b> ejectment (now <b>plaintiff</b> <b>in</b> error) <b>appealed</b> to the court of appeals.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>plaintiffs</b> <b>in</b> {{both cases}} <b>appealed</b> to the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals, as cases 12-1269 and 12-1788. As {{the subject matter}} of the two cases was nearly {{identical}} and there was also a high degree of overlap in the field of Plaintiffs and Defendants, the court effectively merged the two cases for purposes of argument and decision as Moore v. Madigan (taking the common name from the first case to be appealed). Arguments were heard on June 8, 2012 before the panel of Circuit Judges Posner, Flaum and Williams, and the decision was published December 11, 2012.|$|R
25|$|Otis Williams' {{former wife}} Josephine Miles, Melvin Franklin's mother Rose Franklin, David Ruffin's family, and Johnnie Mae Matthews filed {{lawsuits}} against Williams, Motown, de Passe and de Passe Entertainment, Hallmark, and NBC {{for a number}} of charges, including defamation. The lawsuits were consolidated, and the judges ruled in favor of the defendants, and the ruling was upheld when the <b>plaintiffs</b> <b>appealed</b> <b>in</b> 2001. Williams later claimed that, although his book was used as the source material for the film, {{he did not have a}} great deal of control over how the material was presented.|$|R
500|$|Trial by {{battle was}} a {{procedure}} {{which had been}} brought to Britain by the Normans; it was not present in Saxon law. It was authorized in [...] "appeals of murder", that is, retrials by private prosecution following an acquittal for murder. If the <b>plaintiff</b> (<b>in</b> an <b>appeal</b> of murder, the next-of-kin of the deceased) requested such a retrial, the defendant could respond with the [...] "wager of battle", that is, requiring the plaintiff to settle the matter by combat, with the outcome to be ordained by God. Such an appeal, and such an offer of battle could also take place following an acquittal for treason or another felony. Appeals of murder were uncommon, had to be brought within a year and a day of the death, and were generally tried by jury. In 1815, three years before Ashford v Thornton, an appeal of murder was brought in Dublin in O'Reilly v Clancy, and the defendant demanded the wager of battle. Chief Judge William Downes (later Lord Downes), faced with this case, asked: ...|$|R
50|$|Otis Williams' ex-wife Josephine Miles, Melvin Franklin's mother Rose Franklin, Johnnie Mae Matthews, and on David Ruffin's behalf, the Ruffin family, {{filed suit}} against Williams, Shelly Berger, David V. Picker, Motown, De Passe Entertainment, Hallmark Entertainment, and NBC for use of their likenesses in the film, {{defamation}} of character, and emotional distress because of the inaccurate depictions of events. They also alleged that the miniseries misportrayed them and/or their relatives and twisted facts. The judges {{ruled in favor of}} the defendants, and the ruling was upheld when the <b>plaintiffs</b> <b>appealed</b> <b>in</b> 2001. Otis Williams later claimed that while his book was the source material for the film, {{he did not have a}} great deal of control over how the material was presented.|$|R
5000|$|In November 2010, {{counties}} in Kentucky filed a new {{appeal to the}} Supreme Court, requesting the allowance of the display once again. The case was again titled McCreary County v. ACLU of Kentucky. The plaintiffs did not necessarily seek to [...] "overrule" [...] the decision in the original case. Instead, they claimed that the Sixth Circuit Court had failed to follow the majority's comment allowing government to reform the reasoning of a display to render it constitutional. The <b>plaintiffs</b> argued <b>in</b> their <b>appeal</b> that local government has given a firm secular reasoning for the display as the commemoration of historical documents and have renounced the religious motivation for the display, which was the court's reasoning for its prohibition. On the other hand, the plaintiffs also argued for an overthrow of the Lemon test, which indeed in that respect would have [...] "overruled" [...] the prior decision.|$|R

This decision was upheld <b>in</b> <b>appeals</b> up to the US Supreme Court.|$|R
