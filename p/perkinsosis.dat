5000|$|<b>Perkinsosis,</b> or dermo, is {{the disease}} {{condition}} of the oyster. The name [...] "dermo" [...] was coined when the protist was named Dermocystidium marinum, {{and it is still}} commonly used. Infested cells are destroyed by the reproducing protist, and many trophozoites are released into the tissues of the host, or into its bloodstream. There they infest more cells or are excreted or released when the host dies and disintegrates. The infected oyster becomes stressed, its tissues pale in color, its gamete production is retarded, its growth slows, it becomes emaciated, its mantle shrivels and pulls away from the shell, and it may develop pockets of pus-like fluid. Lysis of tissues and blockage of blood vessels causes fatality, but many oysters can persist up to three years with active infections.|$|E
40|$|<b>Perkinsosis</b> is a {{shellfish}} disease {{caused by}} protozoan parasite {{belonging to the}} genus Perkinsus. <b>Perkinsosis</b> {{has been reported in}} some commercially important shellfishes including oysters, clam, abalone and scallop. Heavy infection with Perkinsus often results in tissue inflammation and mass mortalities. Perkinsus trophozoites are commonly occurring in gills, digestive glands, mantle and gonadal connective tissues. Perkinsus is also believed to be responsible for the decline in clam landings for the past decades in Korea. Perkinsus infection was also reported in China, Japan and Thailand, from Japanese short-necked clam and the undulated clam. Microscopic features of different life stages and DNA sequences from the non-transcribed spacer and internal transcribed spacer indicated that Perkinsus sp. discovered in Asian waters are P. olseni. Field survey results suggested that reduced growth and reproduction as well as mass mortalities observed in some major clam beds in Korea was in part, associated with high level of Perkinsus infection.

40|$|Pathogens {{belonging}} to the genus Perkinsus infect many bivalve molluscan species around the world, including the Manila clam Ruditapes phihppinarum. We investigated the spatial distribution of this parasite at 34 stations throughout Arcachon Bay (SW France). Prevalence of <b>perkinsosis</b> was 93 % and mean infection abundance was 96 x 10 (3) cells g(- 1) wet gill. Lowest mean abundances were found close to the Leyre River mouth and a significant negative correlation was observed between mean abundance and salinity. <b>Perkinsosis</b> was rare at the oceanic site where salinities and other environmental parameters were stable. A second {{aim of this study}} was to survey <b>perkinsosis</b> during annual cycles at 4 sites within Arcachon Bay. Prevalence and intensities (+/-SE) of the disease were high, on average between 70 and 100 %, and 130 x 10 (3) +/- 6. 7 x 10 (3) cells g(- 1) wet gill. No seasonal cycle was evident. Clams were infected at 9 mm shell length and infection increased with clam size. The third objective was to determine the disinfection and infection kinetics through a 21 mo reciprocal transplantation between a nearly Perkinsus sp. -free area and a highly affected site. Disinfection appeared to be a very slow process and was similar at the site with favorable conditions for Perkinsus sp. as at the site with unfavorable conditions. Conversely, infection acquisition appeared to be episodic with spatially defined areas. Consequently, the overall lack of a clear seasonal infection pattern is interpreted as the combination of episodic infection events and slow disinfection kinetics...|$|E

We examined the impact of Perkinsus spp. on shell growth at the individual scale in 2 clam species: Ruditapes decussatus from Mundaka Estuary (Spain) and R. philippinarum from Arcachon Bay (France). At Arcachon, 2 contrasting sites in terms of environment and Perkinsus olseni presence were chosen: Arguin (disease-free) and Ile aux Oiseaux (infected site). We monitored the dynamics of <b>perkinsosis</b> over the course of the experiment at Mundaka and Ile aux Oiseaux. Prevalences were high (> 70 %), and intensities were around 10 (5) cells g(- 1) wet gills at Ile aux Oiseaux, and 10 (6) cells g(- 1) at Mundaka. No significant differences in prevalence or intensity were observed over time. A 2 yr field growth experiment of tagged-recaptured clams was performed to determine individual clam growth rate, condition index (CI), and Perkinsus spp. infection intensity. Clams were collected at Ile aux Oiseaux and transplanted to Arguin. The growth rate was always significantly and negatively correlated with Perkinsus spp. infection, and positively correlated with CI.

40|$|Abstract Crassostrea rhizophorae and C. gasar oysters are {{cultivated}} {{in the northeast}} region. Perkinsus parasites infect bivalves, and their effects on oysters from tropical regions are poorly understood. This study evaluated the impact of Perkinsus infection on the productive traits of native oysters. Oysters were sampled bimonthly during 7 months, from July 2010 to February 2011, to evaluate growth rate, mortality and shell color patterns (white and dark-gray) (n = 500), and to determine the prevalence and intensity of Perkinsus (n = 152). Perkinsus and Crassostrea species were determined using molecular tools. Results showed that most dark-gray (90 %, n = 20) and white (67 %, n = 18) oysters were C. gasar and C. rhizophorae, respectively. Oysters showed a high growth rate and moderate cumulative mortality (44 %). C. gasar oysters grew better and showed lower mortality and lower incidence of Perkinsus compared to C. rhizophorae. The mean prevalence of Perkinsus was moderate (48 %), but the infection intensity was light (2. 2). <b>Perkinsosis</b> affected very small oysters (19. 4 mm). In conclusion, native oysters, especially C. gasar, have a great potential for culture, mortality is not associated with <b>perkinsosis,</b> and the shell color of oysters {{can be used to}} improve selection for spats with better performance...|$|E

40|$|Asari (= Manila) clam, Ruditapes philippinarum, is {{the second}} bivalve mollusc in terms of {{production}} in the world and, in many coastal areas, can beget important socio-economic issues. In Europe, this species was introduced after 1973. In Arcachon Bay, {{after a decade of}} aquaculture attempt, Asari clam rapidly constituted neo-naturalized population which is now fished. However, recent studies emphasized the decline of population and individual performances. In the framework of a national project (REPAMEP), some elements of fitness, stressors and responses in Arcachon bay were measured and compared to international data (41 publications, 9 countries). The condition index (CI=flesh weight/shell weight) was the lowest among all compared sites. Variation in average Chla concentration explained 30 % of variation of CI among different areas. Among potential diseases, <b>perkinsosis</b> was particularly prevalent in Arcachon Bay, with high abundance, and Asari clams underwent Brown Muscle Disease, a pathology strictly restricted to this lagoon. Overall element contamination was relatively low, although arsenic, cobalt, nickel and chromium displayed higher values than in other ecosystems where Asari clam is exploited. Finally, total hemocyte count (THC) of Asari clam in Arcachon Bay, related to the immune system activity, exhibited values that were also under what is generally observed elsewhere. In conclusion, this study, with all reserves due to heterogeneity of available data, suggest that the particularly low fitness of Asari clam in Arcachon Bay is due to poor trophic condition, high prevalence and intensity of a disease (<b>perkinsosis),</b> moderate inorganic contamination, and poor efficiency of the immune system...|$|E

40|$|Perkinsus olseni, the causative {{agent of}} <b>Perkinsosis,</b> can {{drastically}} affect {{the survival of}} target marine mollusks, with dramatic economic consequences for aquaculture. P. olseni {{is a member of}} the Alveolata group, which also comprises parasites that are highly relevant for medical and veterinary sciences such as Plasmodium falciparum and Toxoplasma. P. olseni shares several unique metabolic pathways with those pathological parasites but is not toxic to humans. In this work, six antimalarially active peroxides, derived from the natural product artemisinin or synthetic trioxolanes, were synthesized and tested on P. olseni proliferation and survival. All peroxides tested revealed an inhibitory effect on P. olseni proliferation atmicromolar concentrations. The relevance of the peroxide functionality on toxicity and the effect of Fe(II) -intracellular concentration on activity were also evaluated. Results demonstrated that the peroxide functionality is the toxofore and intracellular iron concentration also proved to be a crucial co-factor on the activation of peroxides in P. olseni. These data points to a mechanismof bioactivation in P. olseni sharing similaritieswith the one proposed in P. falciparumparasites. Preliminary studies on bioaccumulation were conducted using fluorescent-labeled peroxides. Results show that synthetic trioxolanes tend to accumulate on a vacuolewhile the labeled artemisinin accumulates in the cytoplasm. Preliminary experiments on differential genes expression associated to Fe(II) transport protein (Nramp) and calcium transport protein (ATP 6 /SERCA) were also conducted by qPCR. Results point to a fourfold increase in expression of both genes upon exposure to trioxolanes and approximately twofold upon exposure to artemisinin derivatives.

40|$|The pearl oyster, Pinctada fucata (Gould), is {{a commercially}} {{important}} bivalve {{distributed in the}} Gulf of Mannar along the southeast coast of India and had supported a healthy, traditional pearl fishery until the 1950 s. But, {{during the past few}} decades, the natural pearl oyster beds in the Gulf of Mannar have showed a sharp decline leading to the closure of the traditional pearl fishery and was presumed to be due to overexploitation and pollution. Except for a preliminary report on Perkinsus marinus infection in Crassostrea madrasensis in 1988, no incidence of <b>perkinsosis</b> or other Office International des Epizooties (OIE) notified protozoan infections in mollusks has been reported from the Indian subcontinent and the pathogen profile of P. fucata from the region has not been studied. Since Perkinsus spp. is known to have destroyed many oyster beds worldwide, the present study was taken up to screen the pearl oyster population along the Gulf of Mannar coast for the presence of Perkinsus spp. and examine the probable role of Perkinsus in the decline of the natural pearl oyster beds. Thirty individuals of adult P. fucata were collected from wild populations at three different locations in the Gulf of Mannar and 10 individuals from a pearl farm containing hatchery reared stock at Tuticorin. The tissue samples were subjected to Ray's fluid thioglycollate medium (RFTM) culture, histology and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). All the samples showed enlarged blue-black hypnospores in RFTM, indicating the presence of Perkinsus spp. Perkinsus-like organisms were also observed in the histological preparations. Screening of the tissues using the Perkinsus genus specific internal transcribed spacer (ITS) 85 and ITS 750 primers, amplified the product specific to the genus Perkinsus (ca. 700 base pairs) and further, the specific identity of the parasite was determined by sequencing the amplified PCR products which showed 99 % identity to Perkinsus olseni.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{identify}} environmental factors that could explain the distribution of different pathologies of commercially exploited intertidal bivalves in an Atlantic lagoon, Arcachon Bay. In particular, the role of the salinity gradient as a driver was explored. The Manila clam Ruditapes philippinarum experienced two severe pathologies, <b>perkinsosis,</b> which is due to a protozoan parasite, and brown muscle disease (BMD), the etiological agent of which remains unknown. Perkinsus olseni infection was very low in a small low-salinity area but, at the scale of the entire lagoon, was more influenced by organic matter content in the sediment and by emersion time. BMD prevalence was also 2. 6 times higher in the higher organic content area but was also negatively correlated with salinity. The sympatric cockle (Cerastoderma edule) was affected by eight trematode species. These parasites have a complex life cycle that generally involves three free-living host species. The distribution of the different trematode communities was rather patchy within Arcachon Bay with no clear relationship with measured environmental factors. The dominance of particular trematode species could be due to the presence of other hosts involved in their life cycle, making it more difficult to detect a major environmental driver. This survey demonstrated that salinity is not a major factor explaining disease distribution in this temperate lagoon. This result has consequences for the research of 'refuge areas' (free of diseases) or 'hot spots' (heavy infection) for species of high economic value...|$|E

The objectives are 1) the surveillance of notifiable diseases present in France (Bonamiosis and Marteiliosis of flat oysters Ostrea edulis), 2) the surveillance of health status of cultured and wild populations of molluscs, 3) the study of abnormal mortality and 4) the control of exchanges from European and third countries. In this context, a new surveillance programme, called Active Targeted Survey, part of the REPAMO, was applied in 2004 {{in order to improve}} the monitoring of the health status of the French mollusc populations (objective 2).

40|$|Sample-size {{calculations}} in {{the context}} of surveys aimed at substantiating freedom from infection have been commonly undertaken on terrestrial animals over recent years, but not on aquatic animals.

The aim {{of this study was to}} adapt that model for marine aquaculture, in particular to help in planning surveys aimed at substantiating freedom from two exotic diseases, mikrocytosis and <b>perkinsosis,</b> in the French population of Crassostrea gigas. As a first approach, farmed animals were targeted without dividing the French coast into different zones, since the movement and mixing of animals are so frequent that it would be very difficult to be representative of a single area or zone. To find the most appropriate sampling scheme, the model was run using at Risk with 1000 iterations and Latin hypercube sampling for each simulation. 60 samples from 30 animals within animal clusters were sufficient to detect a cluster prevalence of 10 % with 90 % confidence, or a prevalence of 20 % with more than 95 % confidence. Alternatively, 100 samples from 30 animals would be enough to detect 10 % of infected clusters with more than 90 % confidence. A sensitivity analysis was conducted to attempt to distinguish between parameter uncertainty and variability. Uncertainty about the sensitivity of the diagnosis test (varying between 50 % and 70 %) had a major influence on the testing scheme at cluster level, but not much influence at the survey level. This model was very useful in assessing different sampling strategies. However, the model also requires enhancements, such as the availability of more accurate data to confirm the various assumptions made, and being able to take into account other factors, such as the results from past surveys, exchanges and movement of animals and environmental factors. ...|$|E
40|$|International audiencePerkinsus genus {{includes}} protozoan parasites {{of marine}} mollusks, especially bivalves. In {{the last four}} years, this parasite has been detected in mangrove oysters Crassostrea rhizophorae and Crassostrea gasar from the Northeastern region of Brazil. Hemocytes are the key cells of the oyster immune system, being responsible {{for a variety of}} cellular and humoral reactions, such as phagocytosis, encapsulation and the release of several effector molecules that control the invasion and proliferation of microorganisms. In Brazil, there is little information on <b>perkinsosis</b> and none on the immune responses of native oysters' species against Perkinsus spp. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine the effects of natural infection by Perkinsus sp. on the immunological parameters of mangrove oysters C.  gasar cultured in the Mamanguape River Estuary (Paraíba, Brazil). Adults oysters (N =  40 /month) were sampled in December 2011, March, May, August and October 2012. Gills were removed and used to determine the presence and intensity of the Perkinsus sp. infection, according to a scale of four levels (1 - 4), using the Ray's fluid thioglycollate medium assay. Immunological parameters were measured in hemolymph samples by flow cytometry, including: total hemocyte count (THC), differential hemocyte count (DHC), cell mortality, phagocytic capacity, and production of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS). The plasma was used to determine the hemagglutination activity. The results showed the occurrence of Perkinsus sp. with the highest mean prevalence (93. 3 %) seen so far in oyster populations in Brazil. Despite that, no oyster mortality was associated. In contrast, we observed an increase in hemocyte mortality and a suppression of two of the main defense mechanisms, phagocytosis and ROS production in infected oysters. The increase in the percentage of blast-like cells on the hemolymph, and the increase in THC in oysters heavily infected (at the maximum intensity, 4) suggest an induction of hemocytes proliferation. The immunological parameters varied over the studied months, which may be attributed to the dynamics of infection by Perkinsus sp. The results of the present study demonstrate that Perkinsus sp. has a deleterious effect on C.  gasar immune system, mainly in high intensities, which likely renders oysters more susceptible to other pathogens and diseases...|$|E

China {{is the main}} producer country followed by Italy, South Korea, USA and Spain. The introduction of the Manila clam in Europe was between 1970 and 1980. R. philippinarum is well adapted and grows faster than native species R. decussatus, for this, is the most produced species in Europe. The production of venerids in Galicia {{is a very important}} socio-economic resource. The production of Manila clam in Galicia rose in the last years and now is the most produced species too. The infection by Perkinsus olseni {{is one of the most}} serious diseases affecting clams. The parasite is highly distributed worldwide and affect to a large list of molluscs. Mortality of R. decussatus and R. philippinarum was associated with P. olseni infection in south Europe as well as with R. philippinarum mortality in several Asian countries. Two species of the genus Perkinsus, P. olseni and P. marinus, are included in the list of notifiable diseases of the World Organization for Animal Health, which indicates the interest to stop the expansion of the disease. The knowledge of P. olseni is very scarce in comparison with P. marinus which provokes massive mortalities in oysters Crassostrea virginica in USA. The economic transcendence of the <b>perkinsosis</b> justifies the research for a better knowledge of the disease and minimizes their effects. With this purpose, this study was developed in order to know (1) the variability of P. olseni along the Spanish coast, with the emphasis in virulence variability among populations, and (2) the modulation of the Manila clam protein expression due to P. olseni infection, with emphasis in the search of protein markers of resistance to the disease. The study of the variability was done analyzing the genetic population structure as well as the proteome of P. olseni clons derived from several regions of the Spanish coast. Furthermore, the proteome of P. olseni was compared with the proteome of two species of the genus, P. marinus and P. chesapeaki, in order to amplify the perspective of the variability of P. olseni. The analysis of the modulation of the Manila clam protein expression due to P. olseni infection was focused in haemocytes and haemolymph. The effect of the exposition to P. olseni in clams was measured at short time and a long time with the aim in the modulation of the immune response of the clam to the parasite...|$|E
40|$|In 1972, France {{underwent}} {{an oyster}} (Crassostrea angulata) crisis and urgently needed to diversify its aquaculture. Thus, Asari clam (Ruditapes philippinarum) was introduced {{at that time}} for aquaculture purpose, concomitantly {{with the introduction of}} Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas). All Asari clam adults and spat originated from the same area (Puget Sound, WA, USA). After a promising start and the implementation of a national Research & Development program, Asari clam culture rapidly faced a series of concomitant handicaps: firstly, in spite the fact that cultural practices were optimized and locking points addressed, leasing ground availability was limited during the 1980 s’ due to certain reluctance from oyster farmers to share their leases and/or diversify their activity; secondly, mortality events in the parks probably due to the spat quality, diseases and/or zootechnical errors and/or predation by triggerfish; and thirdly economical competition with Italian production rapidly increased, exacerbated by the occurrence of neonaturalized Asari clam populations and the resulting professional fishing. Meanwhile, European vs national regulations, concerning minimum legal shell length of clams devoted to the market, were unfavourable to France due to contrasted rules between the Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean; eventually, several diseases impacted drastically clam populations. At the end of the 80 ’s in Northern part of Brittany (France), mass mortality occurred due to brown ring disease, later related to a prokaryote (Vibrio tapetis). Presently, the French production remains limited to 2 - 3000 metric tons, mainly based upon professional fishing on neonaturalized populations located in two sites (Arcachon bay and Morbihan Gulf). In Arcachon bay, a comprehensive population dynamics study demonstrated the concomitant effects of fishing activity and environmental characteristics on the population dynamics. A management model was developed to assess various scenarios mainly based on conservation measures (i. e. fishing area, and/or fishing licences number, and/or fishing period). Implementation of those recommendations has provided some encouraging results. However, Asari clam fitness remains poor: a genetic impoverishment due to population isolation was argued by fishermen, but transplant experiments demonstrated that these bivalves kept their plasticity, {{at least in terms of}} growth and condition index. Thus, several environmental factors were investigated as possible key parameters explaining low clam performances. Again, pathologies were pointed out and particularly the high pressure exerted by the protist Perkinsus sp. (<b>perkinsosis).</b> Moreover, a new pathology was discovered in 2005 in Arcachon bay, the brown ring disease. Although the etiological factor has not been confirmed, viral origin is suspected. A meta-analysis comparing Asari clam characteristics in Arcachon Bay with the international literature pointed out that their reduced condition index in this bay was likely resulting from combined unfavorable factors (e. g., diseases, trace elements). However, 30 % of the condition index variability among sites at the worldwide level was explained by food availability (chlorophyll a concentration). A comparative morphometric studies on four populations of the French Atlantic coasts, using conventional shape analysis, also revealed significant relationships between morphometric ratios and environmental parameters (chlorophyll a concentrations and seawater temperature). Eventually, marine ecologists and state managers as well, must deal with conflictual goals: on one hand Asari clam is an important exploited bivalve in France, on the other hand, the species remains an exotic species which needs careful attention (e. g., European regulations on invasive species) ...|$|E
