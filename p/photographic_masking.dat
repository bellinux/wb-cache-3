40|$|The {{author has}} {{identified}} the following significant results. Hydrologic inventories, throughout the year, {{were made in}} interior basins {{that have not been}} measured previously because of their inaccessibility. Interior basins during the last ERTS- 1 year (August 1972 to August 1973) had driest ground conditions in late September 1972 and had wettest ground conditions from March through May 1973, depending upon location. Bearing strengths of playa soils can be inferred from the changing hydrologic conditions through the seasons as recorded by ERTS- 1, with prior ground control. Slight differences in salt-crust morphology and in moisture contest of playa soils can be greatly enhanced by rationing and stretching techniques. Differences in water area and silt content can be enhanced by using a three-stage <b>photographic</b> <b>masking</b> technique employing bands 4, 5, and 7...|$|E
40|$|Copper foil {{has been}} {{produced}} {{for many years}} by electroforming technique, the major use of such foil is in copper clad plastic laminates {{for use in the}} manufacture of printed circuits. In the production of copper foils various mandrel materials like chromium, nickel, stainless steel, lead, titanium, rhenium has been employed. These mandrels very often produces porous foil unsuitable for printed circuits. The present investigation was undertaken with a view to develop a suitable mandrel to produce copper foil acceptable for printed circuit production. Electrodeposited tin-nickel alloy has been found to posses good corrosion resistance and preferred in certain applications than decorative chromium. A passive film is also said to form on this surface similar to chromium. Hence electroplated tin-nickel alloy mandrel was prepared using the electrolytes reported in the literature and copper foils were electroformed over this mandrel. It has been found that electroplated tin-nickel alloy mandrel produces less number of pores in comparison to chromium and stainless steel. This mandrel has also been utilized for the production of screens by <b>photographic</b> <b>masking</b> and electroforming techniqu...|$|E
40|$|If {{practical}} colorants {{could be}} found to meet theoretical requirements {{then there would be}} no need for color correction in multi-color printing. Color correction is necessary because the available yellow, magenta, and cyan inks absorb and transmit {{in all parts of the}} visible spectrum. It is possible to measure how much these colorants deviate from the ideal with the use of a reflection densitometer. The red, green, and blue filter positions on a densitometer will read the cyan, magenta, and yellow densities respectively. From these densities the amount of color correction necessary to compensate for the inks deficiencies is expressed in terms of percent masking. This is usually computed by the formula: percent mask = highest unwanted density/wanted density. The percent mask is often computed from the densities found when measuring a solid area of a particular colorant. The ratio of unwanted densities to wanted densities is often assumed to remain constant for solids and tints. This is the proportionality rule and is assumed to hold true in what are known as the masking equations (which are the basis for <b>photographic</b> <b>masking</b> for color correction.) The problem is that when a graduated scale of a single color is printed from a light tint to a solid, the proportions of the wanted and unwanted densities do not remain the same for varying tint values and solids. This is known as proportionality failure. This paper deals with the statistical evaluation of the three factors (and the interactions between them) which have been suspected of being the primary causes of this phenomenon. The three factors being tested are solid ink density (ink film thickness), type of paper, and half tone screen ruling. The results indicated that screen ruling was the most important factor for all colors with solid ink density being the next in importance. But the type of paper used was not found to influence proportionality failure, except with magenta ink. This, along with the fact that there was very little proportionality failure in yellow ink, may indicate a certain degree of confusion between proportionality failure and the influence of various factors (including paper) on the 2 ̆ 7 purity 2 ̆ 7 of a color. It was shown in this experiment that the optimum printing levels which produce the least amount of proportionality failure were at the lowest solid ink density practical, the finest screen ruling, and on uncoated paper (yellow notwithstanding since it displayed comparatively no proportionality failure.) The implications of these results indicate that certain modifications in color correction methods may be necessary if printing conditions deviate widely from these optimum levels...|$|E

40|$|The dye {{transfer}} process is the photographic printing process used to produce the highest quality photographic prints to be submitted to printers for reproduction. Dye transfer prints are valued by advertising agencies for their highly saturated colors and ease of retouching. Photographers, museums, art galleries and collectors also value dye prints for the archival qualities. Dye transfer uses cyan, magenta, and yellow dyes to reproduce a color image. <b>Photographic</b> <b>masking</b> is used extensively for color correction, tone compression, and detail enhancement. The masks are projected with the original transparency to make continuous-tone separation negatives. Shallow-reliefgelatin positive-image matrices are made by exposure from light projected through the separation negatives. The matrices carry the dyes to the paper base for printing. The techniques used to produce the masks and separation negatives are so difficult, expensive, and imprecise {{that the future of}} the process is in jeopardy. Manufacturers of electronic color prepress systems and color separation labs would like to take over the market now served by the {{dye transfer}} labs. Existing computer graphics technology, however, cannot offer the same quality and capabilities. Electronic color scanners exist to simplify the photographic methods of masking and color separation. Electronic color scanning techniques techniques have reduced the time to produce color separations for printers from eight hours to thirty minutes. The amount of film used to make separations has been greatly reduced also. Analysis of electronic color scanning techniques could result in a similar savings of time and materials for dye transfer labs. Use of scanners to produce continuous-tone separation negatives for dye transfer would open a new market for scanner manufacturers and color separation labs. A less expensive method of producing dye transfer prints could allow a greater profit margin for the dye transfer labs and make the process more affordable for photographers. An experiment was conducted to determine if acceptable first -roll dye prints could be made from continuous-tone separations produced with a scanner. Comparison of the time and amount of materials required by the conventional photographic and scanner methods were made. Four judges with {{dye transfer process}} expertise determined that no significant differences of quality existed between a group of dye transfer prints produced by a conventional color separation method and a group produced by an electronic color scanning method. The hypothesis that separation negatives produced by electronic scanning will provide acceptable dye transfer prints that require minimal use of the printing controls, with greater consistency, than separation negatives produced by conventional photographic techniques for dye transfer prints was proved correct...|$|E

40|$|PhDThe {{first part}} {{of the study was to}} characterise the {{acoustic}} properties of an IEC agar-based tissue mimicking material (TMM) at ultrasound frequencies centred around 20 MHz. The TMM acoustic properties measured were the amplitude attenuation coefficient (dB cm- 1 MHz- 1), the sound speed (ms- 1) and the backscattered power spectral density characteristics of spectral slope (dB MHz- 1), y-axis intercept (dB) and reflected power (dB). The acoustic properties were measured over a temperature range of 22 - 37 oC. Both the attenuation coefficient and sound speed, both group and phase, showed good agreement with the expected values of 0. 5 dB cm- 1 MHz- 1 and 1540 ms- 1 respectively with average values of 0. 49 dB cm- 1 MHz- 1 (st. dev. Â± 0. 03) and 1541. 9 ms- 1 (st. dev. Â± 8. 5). Overall, this non-commercial agar-based TMM was shown to perform as expected at the higher frequency range of 17 - 23 MHz and was seen to retain its acoustic properties of attenuation and speed of sound over a three year period. For the second part of the study, composite sound speed was measured in carotid plaque embedded in TMM. The IEC TMM was adapted to a clear agar gel.

40|$|Low {{altitude}} (81 m.) narrow-beam laser reflectance {{measurements were}} made from the nearly ocean-like water surface under the Golden Gate bridge. This site allowed precise measurements not possible from flying platforms. For short wavelength water waves superimposed on swell, the signal amplitude probability distribution showed periods of zero return signal, even for vertical incidence, apparently due to tipping of the average water surface. The nonzero signals show an antilog-normal probability distribution, skewed toward higher signal than that provided by a normal (Gaussian) distribution. With incidence angle displaced from the vertical, the distribution shape is retained but with more frequent zero reflections. The decrease with angle of the average signal, including the zeroes, is well fitted with a Gram-Charlier distribution, as seen by earlier observers using <b>photographic</b> techniques which <b>masked</b> these details of the structure. For the simpler wave pattern due to a long sustained wind direction, the signal amplitude probability distribution is lognormal with no zero signal periods. For this case, the distribution shifts toward exponential at large angles from the vertical. For surface states intermediate between the above two extremes the distribution is often normal. The larger return signals resulting from the skew toward larger amplitudes from lognormal are more favorable for disposable laser altimeters than previously believed. Also for an altimeter which may be swinging from a parachute or balloon, the return at angles from the vertical remains high. The presence of occasional zero return signal does degrade the accuracy of altitude somewhat for a descending altimeter, but the signal available assures performance at larger altitudes than previously expected.
