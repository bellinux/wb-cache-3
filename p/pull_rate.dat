Initially, the interface shape is convex, then transforms gradually into a sigmoidal shape, becomes nearly planar at about {{one third of the}} final crystal length, and finally assumes a concave profile with progressively increasing curvature. The nearly planar interface has a double-facet structure, with an annular facet {{at the edge of the}} crystal in addition to the central (111) facet. Formation of the annular facet is accompanied by a giant oscillation of the <b>pull</b> <b>rate</b> when the maximum average <b>pull</b> <b>rate</b> is exceeded. Such oscillation is detrimental to crystal quality, since it introduces a region of high dislocation density. An average <b>pull</b> <b>rate</b> maximum of 2 cm/h has been found to allow for a smooth growth of 200 mm diameter crystals.

Typically, these applications concern only the model accuracy at a relatively small pull or contact/intervention rate of the whole customer base, which is predetermined by a budget constraint for the project, e. g., how many customers can be contacted every month. In this paper, we address the important problem of enhancing the lift (true positive rate) at a specified <b>pull</b> <b>rate.</b> We propose two distinct algorithms, which are applicable to different scenarios. In particular, when the binary class label of the training set is extracted from a continuous variable, we can optimize a training objective which takes into account the specified <b>pull</b> <b>rate</b> rather than the class prior, based on the often ignored continuous variable. In those cases where only the binary class label is available during training, we propose a constrained optimization algorithm to maximize the true positive rate related to a specific decision threshold at which the specified <b>pull</b> <b>rate</b> is achieved. We applied both algorithms to our projects of predicting defection (decline in account value) of mutual fund accounts for two major U.

A finite-element/Newton solution method for a two-dimensional thermal-capillary model of EFG is used to show that limiting values of <b>pull</b> <b>rate</b> exist beyond which steady-state growth is impossible. The <b>pull</b> <b>rate</b> limit is also predicted by a one-dimensional heat transfer model valid when the die sides and menisci are almost parallel and when the thermal conductivities of melt, crystal, and die are all equal. Both the one- and two-dimensional heat transfer models show that heat loss from the melt is dominated by conduction into the crystal and slow heat release to the ambient {{along the length of the}} ribbon. The limiting <b>pull</b> <b>rate</b> results from the reduced efficiency of conduction through the melt caused by the curvature of the meniscus which increases height of the die top above the level of the melt.

However, the low redox stability and tendency towards oxidation impose certain limitations on the conditions, where Fe 3 O 4 can be successfully used. A possibility to control and prevent oxidation of Fe 3 O 4 thus represents an important challenge for materials engineering. In the present work, the laser floating zone (LFZ) method was employed to produce Fe 3 O 4 fibres using hematite (Fe 2 O 3) as a precursor material. Different growth conditions, namely <b>pulling</b> <b>rate</b> in the range 10 - 400 mm/h, were studied. The prepared fibres showed a core/shell structure, where the core is isolated by a shell of Fe 2 O 3. The <b>pulling</b> <b>rate</b> was found to be a crucial growth parameter to control the crystalline nature of the fibres, particularly, the thickness of the shell. Increasing the <b>pulling</b> <b>rate</b> favours the formation Fe 2 O 3 phase and, thus, decreases the width of shell isolating phase.

Cell membranes {{have a limited}} elastic range of 3 – 4 % strain but are protected from direct stretch during physiological loading by their membrane reservoir, an intricate pattern of membrane folds. Using a finite-element model, we suggested previously that access to the membrane reservoir is strain-rate-dependent and that during impact loading, the accessible membrane reservoir is drastically decreased, so that strains applied to chondrocytes are directly transferred to cell membranes, which fail when strains exceed 3 – 4 %. However, experimental support for this proposal is lacking. The {{purpose of this study}} was to measure the accessible membrane reservoir size for different membrane strain rates using membrane tethering techniques with atomic force microscopy.

Therefore, we performed extensive nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations of a phospholipid membrane in the liquid-crystalline phase out of which individual lipid molecules were pulled. In our method, as an idealization of the experimental setups, we have simply attached a harmonic spring to one of the lipid headgroup atoms. Upon retraction of the spring, the force needed to drag the lipid out of the membrane is recorded. By simulating different retraction rates, we were able to investigate the high <b>pull</b> <b>rate</b> part of the dynamical spectrum of lipid adhesion forces.

The maximum value of the adhesion force, the rupture force, decreases as the <b>pull</b> <b>rate</b> becomes slower, and eventually enters a friction-dominated regime. The computed bond lengths depend on the rate of rupture, and show some scatter due to the nonequilibrium nature of the experiment.

The description of processes, which are taking place during the glass melting, is for the high temperature very difficult. Therefore we can use either physical modelling or mathematical modelling.

In the first part, the combustion space of glass melting furnace was modelled, where the temperature distribution influence on fuel input was predicted. The influence was studied {{on the model of}} the FLOAT Nashville furnace. The modelled variants are proposed to simulate the temperature maximum shifting, extension of temperature maximum range, boosting using fuel input changing to the ports. The modelling results were compared with measured data (TC 21) and with the results from other modelling laboratory (TNO). The results show very good agreement with measured data.

This model was used to simulate the melting conditions during melting life of the furnace, where the corrosion has a very important influence on the cooling rate and on the throat-temperature.

40|$|Directional {{solidification}} of the Fe - 4, 3 wt % C alloy {{was performed}} with the <b>pulling</b> <b>rate</b> equal to v= 83 μm/s. Sample was frozen during solidification to reveal {{the shape of the}} solid/liquid interface. Structures eutectic pyramid and spherolitic eutectic were observed. The solidification front of ledeburite eutectic was revealed. The leading phase was identified and defined...|$|R
