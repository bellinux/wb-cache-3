50|$|The {{integrated}} {{modeling system}} {{consists of three}} main components {{and a set of}} preprocessing and postprocessing programs. The main components of the modeling system are CALMET (a diagnostic 3-dimensional meteorological model), CALPUFF (an air quality dispersion model), and CALPOST (a <b>postprocessing</b> <b>package).</b> Each of these programs has a graphical user interface (GUI). In addition to these components, there are numerous other processors that may be used to prepare geophysical (land use and terrain) data in many standard formats, meteorological data (surface, upper air, precipitation, and buoy data), and interfaces to other models such as the Penn State/NCAR Mesoscale Model (MM5), the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) Eta model and the RAMS meteorological model.|$|E
40|$|Summary. This paper {{addresses}} {{the challenge of}} solution verification and accuracy assessment for computing complex Partial Differential Equation (PDE) model. Our main target applications are bio-heat transfer and blood flow simulation problems. However our long term goal {{is to provide a}} <b>postprocessing</b> <b>package</b> that can be attached to any existing numerical simulation package, for example widely used commercial codes such as ADINA, Ansys, Fluent, Star-CD etc., and provide an a posteriori error estimate to their simulation. ...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the measurement of dynamic soaring trajectories of albatrosses. First, a short description of the dynamic soaring technique is given and some important aspects of measuring the trajectories in wind are discussed. Hereupon GPS is shown to be a suitable instrument for the task at hand and results achieved in the past using this technology are presented. Next the concept of an integrated GPS bird logging unit based on a low cost single frequency GPS module is given. As the online position accuracy of the receiver is not sufficient in the scope of this project, software solutions for postprocessing the acquired data are needed. A professional phase-based <b>postprocessing</b> <b>package</b> is addressed and several tests assessing the quality and the availability of the resulting GPS trajectories are described. Finally, an alternative software approach for solving the actual problem is presented...|$|E

The visualization requirements of the facility's three-dimensional graphical workstation are outlined and the types hardware and software used to meet these requirements are discussed. The main features of the facility's current and next-generation workstations are listed. Emphasis is given to postprocessing techniques, such as dynamic interactive viewing on the workstation and recording and playback on videodisk, tape, and 16 -mm film. <b>Postprocessing</b> software <b>packages</b> are described, including a three-dimensional plotter, a surface modeler, a graphical animation system, a flow analysis software toolkit, and a real-time interactive particle-tracer...|$|R
40|$|This work {{presents}} Si-based electromechanical resonators fabricated at the transistor {{level of}} a standard SOI CMOS technology and realized {{without the need for}} any <b>postprocessing</b> or <b>packaging.</b> These so-called Resonant Body Transistors (RBTs) are driven capacitively and sensed by piezoresistively modulating the drain current of a Field Effect Transistor (FET). First generation devices operating at 11. 1 - 11. 5 GHz with footprints of 3 μm× 5 μm are demonstrated. These unreleased bulk acoustic resonators are completely buried within the CMOS stack and acoustic energy at resonance is confined using Acoustic Bragg Reflectors (ABRs). The complimentary TCE of Si/SiO[subscript 2] in the resonator and the surrounding ABRs results in a temperature stability TCF of <; 3 ppm/K. Comparative behavior of devices is also discussed to analyze the effect of fabrication variations and active sensing. United States. National Security Agency.

40|$|We {{present an}} {{alternative}} design for communicating information between an interactive, equation-based modeling environment user and an initial value problem (IVP) solver. The design is practically demonstrated by connecting the widely available integrator LSODE and the freely available plotting program Xgraph to the ASCEND IV 3 modeling environment. In {{contrast to the}} ASCEND III integrator interface, this new design allows {{an order of magnitude}} improvement in the ease of developing an understanding of a dynamic model’s behavior. The improvement is in part achieved by allowing the user to interactively define what time varying quantities should be recorded for <b>postprocessing</b> by graphics <b>packages</b> or other tools without requiring that a new ASCEND model be compiled, thus making visualization easy. The more significant improvement, however, is the new ability to select any part of the complete dynamic model and solve it, thus making exploration of component dynamic behaviors easy. Finally, the user may interactively change a variable between algebraic and dynamic (state or derivative) roles. This makes it possible to negotiate a solution to the index problems which frequently arise in chemical engineering...|$|R
40|$|In {{this report}} a {{description}} of METROPOL (MEthod for TRansport Of POLlutants) which simulates the three dimensional flow of groundwater, based on the finite element method is given. The model, METROPOL, consists of a package of computer programs for preprocessing, simulation and postprocessing. The preprocessing package includes programs for mesh generation and refinement. The simulation package contains programs for steady state and transient groundwater flow with constant density or transient flow with transport of dissolved salt or adsorbing and decaying species at low (tracer) concentrations. The <b>postprocessing</b> <b>package</b> includes programs for particle tracking and the generation of contour plots in two-dimensional cuts. This report serves as the user's guide for the different programs in the package. The general description of all modules of METROPOL is given in the chapters of this report. Finally the appendices provide complete and comprehensive descriptions of the different programs. Each {{of which can be}} used as a stand-alone user guide for the program described therein. ...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: To {{determine}} {{the reliability and}} reproducibility of peripheral nerve diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in healthy subjects. Materials and Methods: We assessed the test-retest and interrater reliability studies of peripheral nerve DTI in a cohort of 12 healthy subjects (mean age 44. 0 years, range 26 - 71 years). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies were performed on a 3 T scanner (MR 750, GE Healthcare). DTI and T 1 -weighted sequences were performed on the tibial and peroneal nerves in the knee. Each subject was scanned on three separate occasions. Image analyses were performed at two anatomic positions: {{the level of the}} lateral femoral condyle (position 1), and the superior pole of the patella (position 2). Analysis was performed using three software packages ("raters") : FuncTools, FSL, and Diffusion Toolkit. Metrics obtained included fractional anisotropy (FA), axial diffusivity (AD), and radial diffusivity (RD). Results: DTI metrics were not significantly different between each measurement position, except peroneal nerve AD and tibial nerve RD were higher at position 1 (P= 0. 02 and 0. 04, respectively). There {{was no significant difference in}} DTI metrics between male and female subjects (P= 0. 10 - 0. 99). The test-retest reliability of DTI metrics was high, maximal for FA (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC]= 0. 96). ICC values for individual DTI metrics were similar between each measurement position, except that tibial nerve AD was significantly higher at position 2 (P= 0. 03). Interrater reliability was also high (ICC= 0. 95 - 0. 96). Conclusion: We found peripheral nerve DTI to be reliable and reproducible, with few effects related to the <b>postprocessing</b> <b>package</b> used. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc...|$|E

40|$|The Earth’s {{topography}} {{results from}} dynamic interactions involving climate, tectonics, and surface processes. In this chapter our main {{interest is in}} describing and illustrating how satellite-derived DEMs (and other DEMs) {{can be used to}} derive information about glacier dynamical changes. Along with other data that document changes in glacier area, these approaches can provide useful measurements of, or constraints on glacier volume balance and—with a little more uncertainty related to the density of lost or gained volume—mass balance. Topics covered include: basics on DEM generation using stereo image data (whether airborne or spaceborne), the use of ground control points and available software <b>packages,</b> <b>postprocessing,</b> and DEM dataset fusion; DEM uncertainties and errors, including random errors and biases; various glacier applications including derivation of relevant geomorphometric parameters and modeling of topographic controls on radiation fields; and the important matters of glacier mapping, elevation change, and mass balance assessment. Altimetric data are increasingly important in glacier studies, yet challenges remain with availability of high-quality data, the current lack of standardization for methods for acquiring, processing, and representing digital elevation data, and the identification and quantification of DEM error and uncertainty...|$|R
