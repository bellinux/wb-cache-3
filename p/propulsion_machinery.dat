40|$|ABSTRACT: This article {{tries to}} show the {{relationship}} between one important set of deficiencies included in the Paris Memorandum of Understanding on Port State Control procedures, <b>propulsion</b> and auxiliary <b>machinery,</b> {{the importance of this}} set of deficiencies for the PSC inspection and also its importance for the Maritime Safety. The maintenance of the <b>propulsion</b> and auxiliary <b>machinery</b> systems has become less important that it deserves, that means while the ship sails everything is supposed to be properly maintained, this is the most extended policy in the Companies and accepted and supported by the Owners. This article studies the deficiencies included in the category <b>propulsion</b> and auxiliary <b>machinery</b> detected by the Port State Control Officers (PSCO) of the Paris MOU area, and tries to demonstrate how important they are in these inspections. At the same time can be seen the professional profile of the PSCO’s as well as the assessment made by them of those areas included in this set of deficiencies. ...|$|R
50|$|HMS Caroline {{was built}} by Cammell Laird of Birkenhead. She was laid down on 28 January 1914, {{launched}} on 29 September 1914 and completed in December 1914. Caroline {{was part of the}} early sub-set of C-class light cruisers built without geared turbines and subsequent comparisons with later vessels of the same class demonstrated the superiority of geared <b>propulsion.</b> Carolines <b>machinery</b> is still in place today, although not in working order.|$|R
5|$|By {{this time}} the {{propulsion}} plant, {{which was to be}} built in the Netherlands, was taking shape. Requirements sent out in August 1939 mandated that the ships have eight boiler rooms, four sets of geared turbines, and 180,000shp. After further improvements, Nevesbu and two German firms (Germaniawerft was responsible for the turbines and Deschimag for the boilers) began sketching preliminary plans. These were then incorporated into two different design studies, one by Nevesbu and the other by NV Ingenieurskantoor voor Scheepsbouw (IvS). IvS was purportedly a Dutch company linking Dutch and German designers, but in reality functioned as a front company for German interests. Their design was probably based upon a set of plans drawn up by the Ship Construction Office of the German Navy and received in the Netherlands on 31 August. It did not give the <b>propulsion</b> <b>machinery</b> enough space, and it was thought that this design did not provide enough room for magazines. Nevertheless, it was taken into discussions with the Dutch, where the 11 July design was merged with it. IvS came out with one further plan on 11 March 1940, the merits of which were discussed with the Dutch in April of that year.|$|E

25|$|The harsh {{operating}} {{conditions of the}} arctic seas place high requirements on the strength, reliability and redundancy of the hull and <b>propulsion</b> <b>machinery,</b> especially for single-screw ships operating independently without icebreaker escort. For this reason the hull form of the SA-15 class freighters resembles that of icebreakers and their robust propulsion system has several innovative features and prototype arrangements to improve the ships' operational capability. Special attention has also been paid on the ships' general purpose characteristics by designing the cargo storage and handling facilities to allow various different types of cargo.|$|E
25|$|On 17 September 2012, {{malfunctions}} {{were detected}} during trials. According to official report, {{seven out of}} eight steam boilers of the <b>propulsion</b> <b>machinery</b> were out of order. Due to this, the deadline of the hand over this ship to the Indian Navy was postponed again until October 2013. Later investigation has determined that the cause for the engine failure was due to poor workmanship and supervision. The Gorshkov and other ships of the 1143.4 class {{had a history of}} multiple boiler failures, however Russian shipbuilders claimed that the source of the problem was the low-grade Chinese-made fire-bricks that were used in the boiler insulation instead of asbestos.|$|E
25|$|In late September 2010, both {{ships were}} brought to Fleet Base East for an 'operational pause' after several {{problems}} were identified with the ships. These included large quantities of corrosion, faults with the deck crane and alarm system, the need to overhaul <b>propulsion</b> <b>machinery,</b> power generators, and air conditioning, and an outdated communication suite. The problems {{have been attributed to}} the ship's high operational tempo, delays in maintenance, and the age of the ships. On 1 November it was reported that the two vessels might never put to sea again due to their poor condition, but a Navy spokesman was quoted the next day as saying that they would both be repaired by early 2011.|$|E

50|$|The C-class {{submarines}} {{were five}} United States Navy submarines {{built by the}} Fore River Shipbuilding Company in Quincy, Massachusetts, under a subcontract from the Electric Boat Company. Built between 1906 and 1909, and in commission from 1908 to 1919, all five were subsequently sold for scrap in 1920. They were considerably larger than the preceding B class at 275 tons submerged vs. 173 tons submerged, and were the first United States submarines with two-shaft <b>propulsion,</b> doubling the <b>machinery</b> of the B class.|$|R
25|$|The Finnish {{ice class}} rules {{published}} in 1932 introduced the ice classes 1A, 1B and 1C for ships strengthened for navigation in ice, ice class 2 for ships classified for unrestricted service but not strengthened for navigation in ice and ice class 3 for other vessels. Ice class 2 was further divided to two subclasses, 2A and 2B, and vessels {{were eligible for}} the former {{if they had a}} radio. Detailed minimum requirements, again as an additional percentage of the open water requirement, were given for the stem, shell plating at the waterline, stiffeners, rudder and rudder bearings, and the <b>propulsion</b> <b>machinery.</b> In the lowest ice class, 1C, the requirements were limited to the bow of the vessel.|$|E
25|$|Arbutus {{was secured}} {{alongside}} Black Prince, having {{just returned from}} a two-month show the flag cruise around the Pacific Islands. The deployment had seen several incidents, the first of which occurred while the ship was docked in Tahiti; sailors who were meant to be guarding the ship became drunk, after which a crowd of Tahitians attempted to board the ship and remove equipment. On departure, the corvette sailed into a heavy storm, which lasted for several days. Waves breaking over the bow rendered the bridge unusable, and many aboard—including the ship's cat, for the first and only time in its life—were seasick. Water contamination of the fuel oil taken on in Tahiti damaged the <b>propulsion</b> <b>machinery,</b> further adding to the problems. When Arbutus finally limped into port, the ship's company were informed that they would only remain at Philomel long enough to take on aviation fuel and supplies to be delivered to the Cook Islands.|$|E
25|$|Development of {{the ship}} from the Admiralty sketch design was based around the Fairey IIID {{seaplane}} being operated for the RAN by the Royal Australian Air Force's No. 101 Flight. Albatross could carry up to nine aircraft—six active and three in reserve—in three internal hangars; their incorporation inside the ship's hull resulted in an unusually high freeboard in the forward half of the vessel, and forced the <b>propulsion</b> <b>machinery,</b> accommodation, and bridge to all {{be located in the}} aft half. Three recovery cranes were used to manipulate the aircraft. The Faireys were removed from service shortly before Albatross entered service, and were replaced by the Supermarine Seagull Mark III. The Mark IIIs were unsuited for operations aboard Albatross, particularly as the aircraft were not durable enough to withstand catapult launches. Specifications for a new aircraft design were drawn up to the RAN and RAAF, and Supermarine designed the Seagull Mark V (later to be called the Walrus) specifically for Albatross, although the design was later adopted by the Royal Navy. Albatross was removed from seagoing service in 1933, two months before the Mark Vs entered service, although the aircraft were operated from the vessel while she was at anchor. In addition, the new Seagulls were too tall to manoeuvre around inside the hangars, although this problem was worked around by placing the aircraft, with undercarriage retracted, on specially designed trolleys.|$|E

These engines can be classified and selected using various characteristics and types, such as its operating cycle. Engines can come in either the four-stroke or the two-stroke version. Four-stroke engines are primarily used in cars, buses, and trucks due to their lower noise production and higher stability in motion. Two-stroke engines are best used in scooters, motorcycles, ships, where space can present a constraint and noise is not an issue. Marine vessels favor the use of two-stroke engines as opposed to four-stroke ones due to fuel usage, engine efficiency, and power-to-weight ratio...|$|R
50|$|Discoverer {{was laid}} down on 10 September 1963 by Aerojet General Shipyards at Jacksonville, Florida.

50|$|Ballistic missile {{submarines}} {{differ in}} purpose from attack submarines and cruise missile submarines; while attack submarines specialize in combat with other vessels (including enemy submarines and merchant shipping), and cruise missile submarines {{are designed to}} attack large warships and tactical targets on land, the primary mission of the ballistic missile is nuclear deterrence. They serve as the third leg of the nuclear triad in countries which also operate nuclear-armed land based missiles and aircraft. Accordingly, the mission profile of a ballistic missile submarine concentrates on remaining undetected, rather than aggressively pursuing other vessels. Ballistic missile submarines are designed for stealth, to avoid detection at all costs. Nuclear power, allowing almost the entire patrol to be conducted submerged, is of great importance to this. They also use many sound-reducing design features, such as anechoic tiles on their hull surfaces, carefully designed <b>propulsion</b> systems, and <b>machinery</b> mounted on vibration-damping mounts. The invisibility and mobility of SSBNs offer a reliable means of deterrence against an attack (by maintaining {{the threat of a}} second strike), as well as a potential surprise first strike capability.|$|R

40|$|The {{first part}} of the paper {{presents}} a survey of approaches to maintenance over the last thirty years. A structure of maintenance costs and maintenance concept adjustment and design (MA-CAD) of ship <b>machinery</b> (<b>propulsion</b> engine) is presented here, which provides the required safety level and lowest costs in a life cycle. Improvement and extension of the MA-CAD method can be achieved by analysis of the most common important parts of the propulsion engine that fail, mostly in operation, by designing maintenance intervals and planning spare parts quantity. A diesel-engine propulsion system with gearbox has been chosen for the research. The data on failure and maintenance activities at propulsion engine breakdown in a seaway within a period of thirteen years have been obtained from the engine′s log book. The critical parts that fail mostly in operation are defined by an analysis of breakdowns (registered failure cycles). The critical components include the exhaust valve, injection valve and fuel pump. The most vulnerable part of the propulsion engine is the exhaust valve with the highest failure rate. By application of the method mentioned we obtain a model for the maintenance concept adjustment and design. The suggested model consists of two parts (a new MA-CAD) : the ship and office. The engine machinery behaviour is monitored aboard the ship (failures and maintenance functioning) and the data are sent to the office.

40|$|The primary {{objective}} of this PhD research is to develop an advanced understanding of the necessary and realistic performance expectations from a full form medium size ship system by means of numerical computer modelling. This includes the minimisation of the harmful environmental signature by increasing its efficiency {{in compliance with the}} EEDI requirements while in search of how the EEDI methodology might be enhanced. The investigation has focused on a medium sized products tanker acting as a midpoint of the spectrum of ship sizes within the range of 20, 000 – 60, 000 DWT of this type. In order to solve such an extensive problem, in the first place, it was important to analyse the energy efficient technology market in a structured manner and then, to identify the most favourable fuel consumption reduction methods that can be associated with the examined ship type. Next, an integrated computer simulation model, involving linked engine, propeller and hull analysis programs, has been developed and calibrated with the model tests and sea trial data. The ship system has been analysed under diverse conditions including various <b>propulsion</b> systems, innovative <b>machinery</b> arrangements, efficiency enhancing hydrodynamic appendages as well as changing weather and load conditions. The evaluation of potential benefits associated with the deployment of innovative technology(s), operation profile(s) or their combination has been made by comparing the designated Energy Efficiency Indicators (EDI), namely, the propulsive efficiency, fuel oil consumption, exhaust emissions footprint and EEDI, respectively associated with the technical, fuel savings, environmental and legal perspectives.
