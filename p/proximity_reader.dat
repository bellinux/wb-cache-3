40|$|Q-factor {{constraints}} {{are usually}} imposed on conductor loops employed as proximity range High Frequency Radio Frequency Identification (HF-RFID) reader antennas to ensure adequate data bandwidth. However, pairing such low Q-factor loops in inductive energy transmission links restricts the link transmission performance. The contribution {{of this paper}} is to assess the improvement that is reached with a two-stage design method, concerning the transmission performance of a planar square loop relative to an initial design, without compromise to a Q-factor constraint. The first stage of the synthesis flow is analytical in approach, and determines the number and spacing of turns by which coupling between similar paired square loops can be enhanced with low deviation from the Q-factor limit presented by an initial design. The second stage applies full-wave electromagnetic simulations to determine more appropriate turn spacing and widths to match the Q-factor constraint, and achieve improved coupling relative to the initial design. Evaluating the design method in a test scenario yielded a more than 5 % increase in link transmission efficiency, as well as an improvement in the link fractional bandwidth by more than 3 %, without violating the loop Q-factor limit. These transmission performance enhancements are indicative of a potential for modifying <b>proximity</b> HF-RFID <b>reader</b> antennas for efficient inductive energy transfer and data telemetry links...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{security}} of many near-field RFID {{systems such as}} credit cards, access control, e-passports, and e-voting, relies {{on the assumption that}} the tag holder is in close <b>proximity</b> to the <b>reader.</b> This assumption should be reasonable due to the fact that the nominal operation range of the RFID tag is only few centimeters. In this work we demonstrate a range extension setup which breaks this proximity assumption. Our system allows full communications with a near-field RFID reader from a range of 115 cm – two orders of magnitude greater than nominal range – and uses power that can be supplied by a car battery. The added flexibility offered to an attacker by this range extension significantly improves the effectiveness and practicality of relay attacks on real-world systems...|$|R

30|$|In this paper, {{our focus}} is on {{applications}} which require multiple readers to service an area with RFID tags. For such deployments a centralized controller exists (could {{be one of the}} readers) which can communicate with all the readers using a Local Area Network (LAN) technology like Ethernet or Wireless LAN and can also serve as a database or data collection point. The purpose of the reader deployment may be to identify the tags as they move along on a conveyor belt, to gather information about the location of objects in a supply chain, or just inventory the items in the area. For example, pallets loaded with tagged items may move through docks in a warehouse to be scanned. Multiple such docks are typically located in close <b>proximity,</b> with <b>readers</b> continuously scanning to identify tags and send collected information for processing to a centralized database. In these scenarios, it is preferable to minimize the delay in reading tags so that each reader gets to scan as often as possible so as not to miss identifying any tags. This also allows the pallets to pass through as fast as possible, speeding up the entire operation. For these applications we can define the total tag reading delay as the time required to collectively read/identify all tags in the interrogation zone of the readers. Our main interest in this paper is to propose a protocol to solve the set of reader collision problems in a way that minimizes total tag reading delay.|$|R

40|$|RFID {{technology}} is the prevalent method for implementing proximity identification {{in a number of}} security sensitive applications. The perceived proximity of a token serves as a measure of trust and is often used as a basis for granting certain privileges or services.

In the case of high-frequency RFID systems the limited operational range of the near-field communication channel is accepted as implicit proof that a token is in close <b>proximity</b> to a <b>reader.</b> In some instances, it is also presumed that this limitation can provide further security services.

Its {{mission is to}} maintain and {{improve the quality of}} life for patients at home. The structure is divided into three services: a care centre providing home care or institutional care, a department of nursing at home for the elderly which provides care for people over 60 years dependent and / or chronically ill, and a therapeutic day care center for old people with cognitive disabilities living at home. This helps people to maintain social links, by stimulating therapeutic activities adapted to slow down the effects of the disease and also relieve the family by providing periods of respite. The therapeutic day care offers many activities such as memory, gymnastics, gardening, and multi-sensory stimulation workshops to help patients find their way into space and maintain their independence. Within the medical and social structures, directors have the duty to organize the safety of patients they serve. If damage is caused to a patient and results from carelessness or negligence of staff or access to unsuitable premises, the responsibility of the head of institution is directly engaged. To assure this surveillance, some structures make use of wireless systems. Demented patients carry with them a device (jewelry, bracelet, pendant [...] .) that causes an alarm on detection of the patient in a non-authorized zone. However, every act of assistance that may be offered even to a cognitive impaired person has to be done with the full consent of the person. Therefore "Soins et Santé" association has chosen to implement technical solutions enabling the secure monitoring of patients through indirect control of the employees. A disposal for patient safety has been established for simultaneously securing sensitive premises (offices, treatment rooms and utensils and care products storage places) and the timetable attendance of the employees.

40|$|In recent years, RFID {{systems that}} are widely applied for the {{identification}} of objects and people in radio frequency, are {{also going to be}} applied used for localization purposes. In indoor applications (apartments, shopping malls, airports), conventional solutions can use a number of signal parameters: instant of arrival (Time of Arrival, Time Difference of Arrival, TOA, TDOA), angle information (Angle of Arrival, AOA), phase information (Phase Difference of Arrival, PDOA) or the amplitude of the received signal (Received Signal Strength Indicator, RSSI). There are also some scenarios with small dimensions where the location can be extremely useful. For example, in a hospital, a better service could be offered through RFID technology, as it can add more control to prevent human errors. Indeed, RFID technology can be useful for correct patient drug supply, dose recording, accurate dispensing, anti-counterfeiting as well as replenishment ordering; besides, it simplifies the information transfer between doctors and nurses (e. g. allergic reactions or drug treatment). In retail industry, real-time inventory based on RFID allows to monitor actual customer demand for products, to prevent an out-of-stock situation by timely replenishing orders, to increase sales through additional services (e. g. fitting rooms with smart mirrors providing suggestions to the customer). In food and restaurant industry, RFID technology allows for a better food control, as for example avoiding expired products sale. In this framework, RFID-based smart shelves, smart freezers, and <b>proximity</b> point <b>readers</b> have been developed in libraries, hospitals and retail industries. In Chapter I, a brief introduction on RFID systems will be presented, in particular describing the main components involved and the principle of operation. It will be described what is proposed in literature about RFID smart shelf and localization algorithms, with particular attention to the methods exploiting the RSSI information. In Chapter II, an exhaustive experimental study by using off-the-shelf reader, antennas and tags, will be presented with reference to a wooden drawer filled with drug boxes. The LDA algorithm (supervised classifier) will be compared with the K-Means clustering algorithm (unsupervised classifier), to validate the proposed method. The procedure to get several RSSI average samples during the drawer sliding actions is described, and classification performance is investigated. First of all, an RSSI analysis is described with reference to a static configuration of the drawer (not sliding). Then, two classification algorithms are compared by considering a different number of drawer sub-regions. In the second part, the algorithm exploiting the drawer sliding is described and system performance is illustrated to verify the classification capability in a two-region drawer. In Chapter III, a localization technique for smart bookshelves based on UHF-RFID systems is presented. Two off-the-shelf reader antennas attached to the bookshelf columns, one in front of the other, are used as an alternative to large-area thin planar antennas integrated onto the shelf top. Two scenarios were considered: the first one with a shelf that is D = 97 cm long, and the second one with D = 150 cm. Exploiting RSSI data acquired by the two antennas, a clustering algorithm is implemented to classify tagged books within one of the regions the shelf has been subdivided into. Preliminary results of the system performance analysis have been compared with simulations to demonstrate that is possible to create an interference region in different sectors on the shelf, through a proper phase shift between the feed currents of the two antennas. The system requires a power divider, a switch, variable phase shifters and finally a fixed or variable power attenuator based {{on the size of the}} shelf. In Chapter IV the algorithm implemented will be described and then the performance results (in terms of normalized confusion matrix) will be presented and discussed.
