40|$|Pipemidic acid, a {{structural}} relative of <b>piromidic</b> and nalidixic <b>acids,</b> exhibited substantial therapeutic activity {{when it was}} administered orally to mice bearing either widely disseminated or relatively localized infections with Staphylococcus aureus {{and a variety of}} gram-negative bacilli. The activity of pipemidic acid was always greater than that of piromidic and nalidixic acids; in infections with Pseudomonas aeruginosa and in bacilli resistant to the latter two drugs, pipemidic acid exhibited significant activity. In limited comparative studies, the activities of pipemidic acid were generally superior to the activities of cephalexin, ampicillin, and carbenicillin. Gentamicin, administered subcutaneously, was more active than pipemidic acid, given either orally or subcutaneously, against both systemic and localized infections with P. aeruginosa. The therapeutic accomplishments of pipemidic acid were attained with well-tolerated doses...|$|R
40|$|The direct viable count method first {{described}} by Kogure et al. (Can. J. Microbiol. 25 : 415 - 420, 1979) was improved {{by using an}} antibiotic cocktail instead of nalidixic acid alone. We screened 100 marine isolates from two coastal areas for their sensitivities to five replication-inhibiting antibiotics, including four quinolones (nalidixic, <b>piromidic,</b> and pipemidic <b>acids</b> and ciprofloxacin) and one (beta) -lactam (cephalexin). It was shown that growth inhibition of all isolates cannot be readily achieved by using a single antibiotic. Inhibition was much more efficient when all the antibiotics were combined, {{making it possible to}} use this method with natural communities. In combination, the concentration of each antibiotic could be lowered and the incubation time could be increased without any growth. Under such conditions, it was shown that the fraction of substrate-responsive cells within natural marine communities is much greater (1 to 2 orders of magnitude) than those reported by traditional procedures. Furthermore, the new procedure made substrate-responsive cells more clearly distinguishable. These improvements resulted in an increased incubation time and were related to metabolic expression of slow-growing cells and/or to the recovery of starved cells. The increased fraction of viable cells within marine communities has ecological implications on the metabolic role of nonculturable cells...|$|R
40|$|<b>Piromidic</b> <b>acid</b> tablets (250 mg tablet) were {{administered}} to 31 female patients with acute cystitis at a daily dose of 1. 5 g for 3 to 12 days. Twenty-eight cases were treated successfully while three remained unimproved, and the efficacy rate was 90. 3 %. Most of the infecting organisms were sensitive to <b>piromidic</b> <b>acid</b> but some of staphylococci were resistant to it as checked by the <b>piromidic</b> <b>acid</b> sensitivity disc (Showa). Gastro-intestinal disturbance was observed in 5 cases (16. 1 %) as side-effects. The <b>piromidic</b> <b>acid</b> tablet {{is considered to be}} an effective drug on acute cystitis in female patients...|$|E
40|$|Pipemidic acid, 8 -ethyl- 5, 8 -dihydro- 5 -oxo- 2 -(1 -piperazinyl) -pyrido [2, 3 -d]pyrimidine- 6 -carboxylic acid, {{is a new}} {{derivative}} of <b>piromidic</b> <b>acid.</b> It is active against gram-negative bacteria including Pseudomonas aeruginosa {{as well as some}} gram-positive bacteria. Its potency is generally greater than that of <b>piromidic</b> <b>acid</b> and nalidixic acid. Cross-resistance is not observed between pipemidic acid and various antibiotics, and most of bacteria resistant to <b>piromidic</b> <b>acid</b> and nalidixic acid are moderately susceptible to pipemidic acid. The activity of pipemidic acid is scarcely affected by the addition of serum, sodium cholate, or change of medium pH, but is subject to the influence of inoculum size. Its action is bactericidal above minimal inhibitory concentrations...|$|E
40|$|In Escherichia coli K- 12 mutants {{which had}} a new nalidixic acid {{resistance}} mutation at about 82 min on the chromosome map, cell growth was resistant to or hypersusceptible to nalidixic acid, oxolinic acid, <b>piromidic</b> <b>acid,</b> pipemidic acid, and novobiocin. Deoxyribonucleic acid gyrase activity as tested by supercoiling of lambda phage deoxyribonucleic acid inside the mutants was similarly resistant or hypersusceptible to the compounds. The drug concentrations required for gyrase inhibition were much higher than those for cell growth inhibition but similar to those for inhibition of lambda phage multiplication. Transduction analysis with lambda phages carrying the chromosomal fragment of the tnaA-gyrB region suggested {{that one of the}} mutations, nal- 31, was located on the gyrB gene...|$|E
40|$|Spontaneous mutants {{with various}} {{patterns}} {{of resistance to}} pipemidic acid (PPA), <b>piromidic</b> <b>acid</b> (PA), and nalidixic acid (NAL) were isolated from Escherichia coli K- 12. Most mutants were less resistant to PPA than to PA and NAL, and some mutants resistant to PA and NAL were hypersusceptible to PPA. As for the mutants tested, resistance to the drugs was conferred by mutations at nalA and new nal genes designated as nalC and nalD, {{both of which were}} located at about 82 min on the recalibrated map. Resistance to PA and NAL was due to decreased sensitivity of the bacterial DNA synthesizing system to them and insufficient drug transport, whereas resistance to PPA was only due to the former...|$|E
40|$|The {{in vitro}} {{activities}} of 25 quinolones and fluoroquinolones against erythrocytic stages of Plasmodium falciparum and against liver stages of Plasmodium yoelii yoelii and P. falciparum were studied. All compounds were inhibitory for chloroquine-sensitive and chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum grown in red blood cells. This inhibitory effect increased with prolonged incubation {{and according to}} the logarithm of the drug concentration. Grepafloxacin, trovafloxacin, and ciprofloxacin were the most effective drugs, with 50 % inhibitory concentrations of < 10 Î¼g/ml against both strains. Only grepafloxacin, <b>piromidic</b> <b>acid,</b> and trovafloxacin had an inhibitory effect against hepatic stages of P. falciparum and P. yoelii yoelii; this effect combined reductions of the numbers and the sizes of schizonts in treated cultures. Thus, quinolones have a potential for treatment or prevention of malaria through their unique antiparasitic effect against erythrocytic and hepatic stages of Plasmodium...|$|E
