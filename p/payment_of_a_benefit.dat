30|$|The {{period of}} {{analysis}} may vary from instrument to instrument too, with income taxes typically assessed {{over a year}} (which {{may or may not}} align with the calendar year), while some benefits may have a period of analysis of a month. Sometimes the period of analysis for <b>payment</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>benefit</b> (current month), may differ from the period of analysis of the means for assessment (e.g. previous year). However very few datasets allow for such heterogeneity.|$|E

30|$|The {{exception}} to the statement that a basic income had not yet entered European social protection concerns child <b>benefit.</b> The <b>payment</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> universal <b>benefit</b> for all children, perhaps varying by age, {{can be seen as}} <b>a</b> specific form <b>of</b> basic income. Such payments are common in EU countries. If the EU is to go down the basic income route, then a natural starting point is with an EU basic income for children. Some ten years ago, the High-Level Group on the future of social policy in an enlarged European Union (European Commission, 2004) made such a proposal, as part <b>of</b> <b>a</b> possible “inter-generational pact”. In concrete terms, this could mean an EU-wide basic income for children, set, say, at 10 per cent of median income per capita in each Member State for each child, administered and financed by each Member State. Such a programme – refined in its details – would allow the EU to invest in its future – children and human capital.|$|R
50|$|During 2003 the DWP {{commenced}} {{the use of}} Post Office {{accounts for}} the <b>payment</b> <b>of</b> <b>benefits,</b> <b>a</b> process fully operational {{at the beginning of}} the financial year in 2005. The accounts are licensed and the electronic benefits transfer banking engine are provided by the company JP Morgan Europe. Prior to these services the banking facility were provided by Citibank. <b>As</b> <b>of</b> 2012, the <b>payment</b> system for benefits is being streamlined, and all payments will now be made into bank, building society or Post Office accounts, and the use of Girocheques will be phased out by early 2013.|$|R
30|$|Another reform, {{that meant}} a {{paradigm}} change, took place in October 1993 with the reintroduction {{of the system of}} individual accounts that would coexist with the public system. Under this mixed-system, the retirement benefit of the PAYG-DB pillar was conformed <b>of</b> three parts, <b>a</b> flat payment, <b>a</b> <b>benefit</b> based on contributions made before the reform, and another based on contributions made after the reform. The latter two components were calculated based on the years of contributions and the average wage received {{in the last years of}} work before retirement. For those who chose to migrate to, or new workers that choose the system of individual accounts, the total benefit also consisted of three parts. The same flat payment paid in the public pillar, a payment based on the contributions made to the public system, and other payment using the funds accumulated in the individual account. The first two components were the responsibility of the public sector. After a minimum period in one system, workers had the option to switch between systems. Even under the individual account system there were some redistributive components through the <b>payment</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> flat <b>benefit,</b> as well as the existence <b>of</b> <b>a</b> minimum pension. <b>Benefits</b> paid by both systems that were the responsibility of the public sector, were financed with contributions from employers and from workers belonging to the public pillar.|$|R
40|$|The present article {{deals with}} the area of social and health welfare of former and current {{employees}} of the abolished, privatized or otherwise affected by reorganization mining enterprises {{in connection with the}} decline of uranium, ore and coal mining industry in the country. It describes <b>a</b> thorough analysis <b>of</b> the legislation governing the given area {{from the start of the}} decline in mining activity in 1990 to the present. Subsequently, relying on real data from practice, the article shows elaborated overviews of trends in the number of beneficiaries of all kinds of provided mandatory and decline-based social and health reimbursements in the years 2001 - 2012, including the total cost financed in <b>a</b> form <b>of</b> subsidies from the state budget. The forecast of trends of these monitored indicators, processed by the age of beneficiaries of compensations, type of work and other practice-verifiable data, suggests a sharp reduction in the number of recipients of mandatory compensations in the year 2015, the complete termination <b>of</b> <b>payment</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> special health <b>benefit</b> for miners by 2025, compensations of accidents at work, occupational diseases and allotments of coal and wood by the year 2035...|$|R
