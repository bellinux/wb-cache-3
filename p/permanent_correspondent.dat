2500|$|In February 1897 The Times {{appointed}} Morrison as {{the first}} <b>permanent</b> <b>correspondent</b> at Peking, and he took up his residence there in the following month. Unfortunately, his lack of knowledge in the Chinese language meant {{that he could not}} verify his stories and one author has suggested some of his reports contained bias and deliberate lies against China. There was much Russian activity in Manchuria at this time and in June Morrison went to Vladivostok. He travelled over a thousand miles to Stretensk and then across Manchuria to Vladivostok again. He reported to The Times that Russian engineers were making preliminary surveys from Kirin towards Port Arthur (Lüshunkou). On the very day his communication arrived in London, 6 March 1898, The Times received a telegram from Morrison to say that Russia had presented a five-day ultimatum to China demanding the right to construct a railway to Port Arthur. This was a triumph for The Times and its correspondent, but he had also shown prophetic insight in another phrase of his dispatch, when he stated that [...] "the importance of Japan in relation to the future of Manchuria cannot be disregarded". Germany had occupied Kiao-chao towards the end of 1897, and a great struggle for political preponderacy was going on. Morrison in his telegrams showed [...] "the prescience of a statesman and the accuracy of an historian" [...] (The Times, 21 May 1920).|$|E
