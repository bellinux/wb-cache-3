On the other hand, when the blank holding forces were increased to 30 and 90 kN, the forming depth of CR 340 /CFRP and CR 340 /CFRPR* composites were almost same.

40|$|A crystal {{plasticity}} {{finite element}} method (CPFEM) model has been developed to investigate the texture evolution and heterogeneity during equal channel angular pressing (ECAP) of an aluminum single crystal. The developed model has been validated by comparison with experimental observations. The simulation {{results show that the}} lattices rotate predominantly around the Z axis (transverse direction) during ECAP. After deformation the billet is subdivided into three matrix bands along the thickness by the Z-axis rotation. The Z-axis rotation angles within three matrix bands are about 60 °, 0 ° and 90 °, respectively. It has been found that the die geometry plays a very important role on the texture evolution and heterogeneity in ECAP. In the large strain gradient region, multi-slip can be activated and the material rotation induced by slips is negligible. The lattices must rotate to accommodate the whole material rotation required by deformation. When the strain gradient is small, the single dominant slip is the main slip mechanism. The material remains roughly at the initial orientation after deformation.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this study consists in evaluating {{the sensitivity of the}} first <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>die</b> grass-milk with respect to an accidental radioactive discharge. We want to know if a single uniform deposit would involve a homogeneous contamination of the grazing grass on the scale of the whole French territory. The study was based on the ASTRAL model, a computer code developed by the IRSN which makes it possible to evaluate the transfer of the radio nuclides in the terrestrial food chain following an accidental atmospheric emission. The way of transfer of ASTRAL on which the study focused is the transfer of the deposit to milk, via the grazing grass ingestion. The sensitivity of this way of transfer relies on several parameters: interception capacity, yield, cows food rates and dates of setting to grass. Methodology thus consisted in regionalizing these parameters. The software STICS, developed by the INRA (Avignon Centre) was then used to regionalize the values for the retention and the yield. This model proposes a daily follow-up of the leaf area index which has been correlated with interception capacity and with the production of fresh biomass (yield) ...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{trends in}} process {{technology}} suggest {{the need to}} moni-tor transistor wear-out in future processes. Because of within-die variation and the different computations being run on each core in a multi-core chip, this wear-out causes further imbalance to initial core frequencies as time progresses. Fur-thermore, manufacturing defects mean that cache sizes can vary between cores, adding further imbalance to a system. If we allow different cores to independently control their op-erating frequency we can achieve the best possible perfor-mance for their <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>die.</b> Other parts of the system with slowly degrading performance can include interconnects and Flash-based file caches.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Pulling {{force is}} the {{summation}} of resistance forces along a pultrusion die. Its mechanism is complicated because the impregnated resin inside the compressed fiber reinforcement changes from a liquid to a gel, {{and finally to}} a solid in the die. Two methods, a ‘mat tracer ’ method and a ‘short die length ’ method, {{were used to determine}} the pulling force distribution. Results show that the downstream <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>die</b> contributes little to the pulling force. In order to predict the resistance force in both the injection die and the heating die, two models were developed in this study. A friction measurement device was designed to measure the friction coefficient between the composite and the mold surface. The effect of process variables, such as temperature, resin conversion, normal force, and line speed, on the friction coefficient was investigated and a friction coefficient model was proposed based on the experimental results. A volume change model of vinylester resin was also developed to predict the thermal expansion–polymerization shrinkage during curing. The parameters of the model were determined by dilatometry, thermomechanical analysis (TMA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC).

The titanium sheet was dragged into the clearance between upper punch and die by the descent motion of the 	 upper punch. The seizure occurred at the shoulder part and side wall <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>die.</b> The working conditions changed within the 	 bending radius of die, the lubricating condition and punch speed. The surface roughness of titanium sheets and die surface were 	 measured by the surface measuring instrument using PGI (Phase Grating Interferometry) system (Taylor Hobson Form Talysurf 	 1200). The surface roughness and the punch load increased intensely within a 10 mm of sliding distance under the non-lubricant 	 condition, and increased gradually within a range of 10 to 50 mm in every die radius. The load of draw bending process was 	 related to the variation of surface roughness. The seizure of the pressing process, occurring between surfaces of specimen and 	 die, was estimated by measuring the arithmetic mean roughness. 11 th International Conference on Technology of Plasticity, ICTP 2014, 19 - 24 October 2014, Nagoya Congress Center, Nagoya, Japa...|$|E
40|$|Special Issue on Defect and Fault ToleranceInternational audienceDrastic device shrinking, {{power supply}} reduction, {{increasing}} complexity and increasing operating speeds affect adversely {{the reliability of}} nowadays Integrate Circuits (ICs). In many modern designs, embedded memories occupy the largest <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>die</b> and comprise {{the large majority of}} transistors. Furthermore, memories are designed as tight as allowed by the process, and are therefore more prone to failures than other circuits. Error correcting codes (ECCs) are an efficient mean for protecting memories against failures. A major drawback of ECCs is the speed penalty induced by the encoding and decoding circuits. In this paper, we present an architecture enabling implementing ECCs without speed penalty. Furthermore, as the manual implementation of this solution is impractical for complex System-on-Chips (SoCs), we propose an algorithm and a set of generic rules allowing automatic insertion of the delay-free ECCs in any complex architecture at Register Transfer Level (RTL). With respect to a naive insertion {{in the design of the}} new architecture, the algorithm enable up to 20 % hardware reduction. The Finite State Machines (FSM) that controls the new ECC architecture is also generated automatically. Experimental evaluations show that the hardware overhead of the speed penalty free ECCs protected memory compared to a standard implementation of ECC protected memory is about 2. 5 % with an additional power consumption of 6 %...|$|E

40|$|This {{study is}} focused on tools used in the {{industrial}} process of hot forging of a front wheel forging (gear wheel) manufactured for the automotive industry. Five different variants were applied for the tools: 3 die inserts were coated with three different hybrid layers (PN + PVD type), i. e. AlCrTiN, AlCrTiSiN and CrN, one insert was only nitrided, and one was pad welded, to improve tool durability. The tool wear was analysed and represented by the material degradation on the working surface, based on the 3 D scanning and the material growth of the periodically collected forgings. Additionally, the scanned tools {{were divided into two}} areas, in which it was found, based on the analysis, that various degradation mechanisms are predominant. Microstructural tests and hardness measurements of the analyzed tools were also performed.

40|$|Objective The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the use of CAD/CAM technology as a method to fabricate a single-unit, all-ceramic Post & Core restoration. Materials and Methods Three master dies were fabricated from polymer material (Acadental T Endo TM series RT _AE 401 _ 08 ®). The coronal <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>die</b> simulated an ideal core preparation with a 1. 5 to 2 mm ferrule. The intracanal space of the first die was prepared for a post length of 5 mm. The intracanal space for the second die was prepared for a post length of 10 mm. Finally, the intracanal space for the third die was prepared to a length of 14 mm. Each die was scanned 20 times using the Sirona CEREC AC BlueCam®. A total of sixty e. max® CAD/CAM post and core restorations were milled using Sirona CEREC three compact milling unit®. The restorations were evaluated for precision of fit using 2 methods: 1. The marginal gap was measured for each Post & Core restoration using scanning electron microscopy to determine the accuracy of fit of the core to the die. Measurements were made at three points: mesial, buccal and distal of each sample. The mean marginal gap for the three groups was 38 um. 2. A radiograph was taken of each of the 60 samples to determine the post length. The mean post length for the group that was calibrated for 5 mm was 6. 3 mm. Mean post length for the group that was calibrated for 10 mm was 10. 0 mm. Mean post length for the group that was calibrated for 14 mm was 11. 0 mm. Overall, there was no pattern of relationship between marginal gap and post length among the three groups. Conclusion This study concluded that the focal working length of Sirona CEREC AC® BlueCam is accurate up to 13. 7 mm. However, the technology is not able to consistently produce accurate milled post and core restorations beyond 11 mm. The mean marginal gap for the three groups was 38 um.

40|$|Decentralization {{reforms have}} been among the most {{important}} aspects of state modernization in developing countries. From a normative perspective, such reforms are expected to promote economic development and democratization. Unfortunately, however, the course of real decentralization processes has often been incoherent and defective. In this context, this study analyses the challenges for successful decentralization in fragmented polities focusing on Latin America and the special case of Ecuador. Based on a political economy perspective on decentralization, we attempt to show, how political fragmentation has affected decentralization. From there, we develop criteria on how development assistance can at least partly counter the negative effects of political fragmentation. Finally, we analyse to which extend donor agencies have been pursuing such strategies in Ecuador. This study {{is the result of a}} research project, which has been carried out at the German Development Institute (DIE) in 2004 and 2005 as <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>DIE</b> Post-Graduate Training Course for young professionals.
