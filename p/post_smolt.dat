40|$|The aim of {{this report}} is to {{investigate}} the economics of land based aquaculture of salmon and to compare the competitiveness of land based production to the conventional, sea based production model. Two land based scenarios are analysed: full-cycle grow out of harvestable salmon on land and “post smolt”, the production of larger smolts on land before release of the fish for grow-out in sea. In {{the first part of}} the report, background information on the salmon aquaculture industry is presented. This shows that production challenges and biological issues exist in traditional farming of salmon and there is increasing search for alternative ways of salmon production. The study then analyses two such alternatives, using the methodologies NPV, IRR and analysis of cost of production. Using local and national data, the study is designed to investigate and compare farm-gate cost of production in a Norwegian context, aiming to build an understanding about the price firms will need to fetch over time to stay profitable. The results indicate that full cycle land based salmon farmers in Norway still might rely on a higher price than sea based farmers do. In terms of using land based technology in combination with sea based grow-out, the study found that it is challenging to estimate the net effect of investment in <b>post</b> <b>smolt</b> for a company as a whole. While some indications are given about the potential effect on cost of production, uncertainty remains about the benefits of <b>post</b> <b>smolt</b> – such as the magnitude of relief of lice related issues and costs. Still, the analysis could shed light on some interesting points with respect to production planning using larger smolts, and hopes to make a contribution to the academic discussion in this respect...|$|E
40|$|A {{group of}} 60 pit tagged <b>post</b> <b>smolt</b> Atlantic salmon chosen {{randomly}} from {{a pool of}} 50 families (34 represented), with an initial body weight of 440 g, were reared in a single tank for 56 days. Fish weight gain was 414 g and specific growth rate 1. 2 % d- 1 during the experimental period. Individual apparent digestibility coefficient (ADC) was determined from three faecal samples of each fish (stripping) obtained during the experiment. ADCs mean and standard deviation (SD) for the first stripping (n= 57) was 90. 8 % (SD= 1. 4 %) for protein and 95. 0 % (SD= 1. 1 %) for lipid; for the second stripping (n= 56), 90. 0 % (SD= 1. 5 %) for protein and 94. 8 % (SD= 1. 1 %) for lipid, and for the third stripping (n= 54) 88. 5 % (SD= 2. 5 %) for protein and 93. 9 % (SD= 2. 0 %) for lipid. Intraclass correlations (repeatability) for ADC of lipid varied from 0. 24 to 0. 5 and of protein from 0. 00 to 0. 02. These results indicate significant genetic variation in digestibility of lipid in Atlantic salmon, but not for protein. Therefore {{it should be possible to}} obtain a favorable genetic gain for ADC of lipid, but not for ADC of protein...|$|E
40|$|The {{populations of}} Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) and sea trout (Salmo trutta) are declining in Europe. For both species the key {{seems to be}} found in the {{saltwater}} stage of their life cycle. Two major changes have occurred in this stage over the last thirty years; the rise of aquaculture and climate change. For sea trout the main problem is believed to be aquaculture, with associated epizootics of salmon lice (Lepeophtheirus salmonis). For Atlantic salmon the problem seems to be a changing ecosystem in the North Atlantic, probably due to climate change. The focus of this study is growth of Atlantic salmon and sea trout caught in the river Etneelva, Western Norway, in 1983 and 2008. The growth of 1 + Atlantic salmon parr was positively correlated with river temperature. In the river, Atlantic salmon displayed a slight increase in growth between 1978 - 1981 and 2003 - 2005, but it was marginally not significant. The growth of sea trout parr was not significantly different between 1976 - 1981 and 2000 - 2006. There was a significant negative correlation between the size of 1 + Atlantic salmon parr at the beginning of the growing season and the growth of the 1 + sea trout parr. In the fjord, the sea trout <b>post</b> <b>smolt</b> growth has been reduced from 1979 - 1982 to 2002 - 2007. The growth during the second sea summer was also reduced for the sea trout, as was Fulton’s condition factor when the fish were caught. For the Atlantic salmon <b>post</b> <b>smolt</b> the growth was increased from 1979 - 1982 to 2004 - 2007, while the growth was significantly reduced for the 2 SW. Fulton’s condition factor for the spawners was also reduced. The weight of the MSW caught in 2008 was lower than expected. 65 % of the Atlantic salmon caught in 2008 displayed summer growth checks during their first year at sea, whereas only 4. 5 % of the fish caught in 1983 had this. Also the sea trout caught in 2008 had a higher occurrence of summer growth checks, with 12 % against 3. 6 % in 1983. In the river, the Atlantic salmon 1 + parr seem to benefit from the higher temperatures at the cost of the sea trout parr. High infection rates of salmon lice in the fjords are believed to be behind the reduced growth of sea trout, both because of stress and premature river run. Improved growth in spite of high occurrence of growth checks during the Atlantic salmon <b>post</b> <b>smolt</b> year might indicate that good habitats in the nursery area are more patchily distributed than before. Reduced 2 SW growth and condition factor for the returning spawners indicate that the conditions for the mature Atlantic salmon in the ocean also are less optimal. Bestandane av laks (Salmo salar) og sjøaure (Salmo trutta) er i nedgong over store delar av Europa. Nykelen synest å finnast i sjøfasen for båe artar. To store endringar har skjedd der dei siste tretti åra; framvekst av akvakultur og klima endringar. For sjøaure er hovudproblemet truleg oppdrettsnæringa, med tilhøyrande oppbløming av lakselus (Lepeophtheirus salmonis). For laksen er årsaken truleg å finne i endringar i økosystemet i Nord-Atlanteren, som kan skuldast klimaendringar. Fokus for denne oppgåva har vore vekst hjå laks og sjøaure fanga i Etneelva, Hordaland, i 1983 og 2008. Veksten til 1 + lakseungar var korrelert med vasstemperaturen. Veksten i elva viste ein auke hjå lakseungane frå 1978 - 1981 til 2003 - 2005, men den var så vidt ikkje signifikant. Det var ingen signifikant skilnad på veksten til aureungane mellom 1976 - 1981 og 2000 - 2006. Det var ein negativ samanheng mellom storleiken på 1 + lakseungane på byrjinga av vekstsesongen og veksten til 1 + aureungane. I fjorden har veksten til sjøaure postsmolten vorte redusert mellom perioden 1979 - 1982 og 2002 - 2007. Veksten var og redusert andre året i sjøen, det same var Fultons kondisjonsfaktor når auren vart fanga. For postsmolten til laksen auka veksten frå perioden 1979 - 1982 til 2004 - 2007, medan den minka signifikant for det andre året i havet. Fultons kondisjonsfaktor for gytefisken var dårlegare i den siste perioden. Vekta på fleirsjøvintringar tatt i 2008 var lågare enn forventa. Heile 65 % av laksane tatt i 2008 hadde falske vintersoner i løpet av postsmoltåret, mot berre 4. 5 % i 1983. Og sjøauren hadde ein auke i falske vintersoner, frå 3. 6 % i 1983 til 12 % i 2008. I elva synest det at lakseungane er betre enn aureungane til å utnytte den auka temperaturen. I fjorden er truleg høge infeksjonsratar med lakselus skuld i den dårlege overlevinga og veksten hjå sjøaure. Dette skuldast både stress og at auren må gå tidlegare attende til ferskvatn. Den betra veksten til postsmolt av laks til trass for den høge førekomsten av falske vintersoner kan tyda på at dei gode oppvekstområda i Nord-Atlanteren er meir spreidd enn før. Den låge vekta og kondisjonsfaktoren på gytefisken tydar og på at tilhøva for dei vaksne laksane i havet er mindre gunstige...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Fish farmed under high {{intensity}} aquaculture conditions {{are subjected to}} unnatural environments that may cause stress. Therefore awareness of how to maintain good health and welfare of farmed fish is important. For Atlantic salmon held in sea cages, water flow, dissolved oxygen (DO) levels and temperature will fluctuate over time and the fish can at times be exposed to detrimentally low DO levels and high temperatures. This experimental study investigates primary and secondary stress responses of Atlantic salmon <b>post</b> <b>smolts</b> to long-term exposure to reduced and fluctuating DO levels and high water temperatures, mimicking situations in the sea cages. Plasma cortisol levels and cortisol release to the water were assessed as indicators of the primary stress response and intestinal barrier integrity and physiological functions as indicators of secondary responses to changes in environmental conditions. Results Plasma cortisol levels were elevated in fish exposed to low (50 % and 60 % saturation) DO levels and low temperature (9 °C), at days 9, 29 and 48. The intestinal barrier function, measured as electrical resistance (TER) and permeability of mannitol {{at the end of}} the experiment, were reduced at 50 % DO, in both proximal and distal intestine. When low DO levels were combined with high temperature (16 °C), plasma cortisol levels were elevated in the cyclic 1 : 5 h at 85 %: 50 % DO group and fixed 50 % DO group compared to the control (85 % DO) group at day 10 but not at later time points. The intestinal barrier function was clearly disturbed in the 50 % DO group; TER was reduced in both intestinal regions concomitant with increased paracellular permeability in the distal region. Conclusions This study reveals that adverse environmental conditions (low water flow, low DO levels at low and high temperature), that can occur in sea cages, elicits primary and secondary stress responses in Atlantic salmon <b>post</b> <b>smolts.</b> The intestinal barrier function was significantly affected by prolonged hypoxic stress even when no primary stress response was observed. This suggests that intestinal barrier function is a good experimental marker for evaluation of chronic stress and that it can be a valuable tool to study the impact of various husbandry conditions on health and welfare of farmed Atlantic salmon. </p...|$|R
40|$|AbstractFlavobacterium psychrophilum is a {{well-known}} pathogen causing significant problems in aquaculture worldwide. In recent years {{an increasing number of}} disease outbreaks caused by F. psychrophilum has been reported on juvenile and <b>post</b> <b>smolts</b> of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) in Norway. The current study was performed to assess the efficacy of two autogenous water-in-oil formulated vaccines containing whole cell antigens of F. psychrophilum to induce protective immunity against challenge. The vaccines were formulated either as multivalent (FLAVO AVM 6) or divalent (FLAVO IPN) and administered by the intraperitoneal route. Intramuscular challenge with a field strain of F. psychrophilum was carried out 552 day degrees post vaccination, {{at a time when the}} FLAVO AVM 6 and FLAVO IPN vaccinated groups had significantly higher antibody responses compared to the negative control. Results from the challenge study showed that the multivalent and the divalent vaccines had capacity to induce significant protection, with RPS 60 > 87 % and RPSend> 77. 5 % for both vaccines. The high level of protection seen in the vaccinated groups was also reflected in the reduced ulceration rates observed at the injection site. Combining our results demonstrate that vaccination with FLAVO AVM 6 and FLAVO IPN induces responses capable of protecting rainbow trout against infections with F. psychrophilum...|$|R

40|$|Infectious {{pancreatic}} necrosis virus (IPNV) causes {{high incidence}} of disease in salmonids during the first period after SW transfer. During this period as well as during periods of stress, cortisol levels increase and indications of a relationship between IPNV susceptibility and cortisol have been suggested. The intestine is an entry route and a target tissue for IPNV displaying severe enteritis and sloughing of the mucosa in infected fish. The mechanisms behind effects of the virus on the intestinal tissue {{and the impact of}} cortisol on the effect remain unclear. In the present study, Atlantic salmon <b>post</b> <b>smolts</b> treated with or without slow release cortisol implants were subjected to a cohabitant IPNV challenge. Analysis of genes and proteins related to the innate and acquired immune responses against virus was performed 6 days post-challenge using qPCR and immunohistochemistry. An increased mRNA expression of anti-viral cytokine interferon type I was observed in the proximal intestine and head kidney {{as a response to the}} viral challenge and this effect was suppressed by cortisol. No effect was seen in the distal intestine. T-cell marker CD 3 as well as MHC-I in both intestinal regions and in the head kidney was down regulated at the mRNA level. Number of CD 8 a lymphocytes decreased in the proximal intestine in response to cortisol. On the other hand, mRNA expression of Mx and IL- 1 b increased in the proximal intestine and head kidney in IPNV challenged fish in the presence of cortisol suggesting that the immune activation shifts in timing and response pathway during simulated stress. The present study clearly demonstrates that IPNV infection results in a differentiated epithelia...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The salmon louse is an ectoparasitic copepod {{that causes}} major {{economic}} {{losses in the}} aquaculture industry of Atlantic salmon. This host displays {{a high level of}} susceptibility to lice which can be accounted for by several factors including stress. In addition, the parasite itself acts as a potent stressor of the host, and outcomes of infection can depend on biotic and abiotic factors that stimulate production of cortisol. Consequently, examination of responses to infection with this parasite, in addition to stress hormone regulation in Atlantic salmon, is vital for better understanding of the host pathogen interaction. Results Atlantic salmon <b>post</b> <b>smolts</b> were organised into four experimental groups: lice + cortisol, lice + placebo, no lice + cortisol, no lice + placebo. Infection levels were equal in both treatments upon termination of the experiment. Gene expression changes in skin were assessed with 21 k oligonucleotide microarray and qPCR at the chalimus stage 18 days post infection at 9 °C. The transcriptomic effects of hormone treatment were significantly greater than lice-infection induced changes. Cortisol stimulated expression of genes involved in metabolism of steroids and amino acids, chaperones, responses to oxidative stress and eicosanoid metabolism and suppressed genes related to antigen presentation, B and T cells, antiviral and inflammatory responses. Cortisol and lice equally down-regulated a large panel of motor proteins that can be important for wound contraction. Cortisol also suppressed multiple genes involved in wound healing, parts of which were activated by the parasite. Down-regulation of collagens and other structural proteins was in parallel with the induction of proteinases that degrade extracellular matrix (MMP 9 and MMP 13). Cortisol reduced expression of genes encoding proteins involved in formation of various tissue structures, regulators of cell differentiation and growth factors. Conclusions These results suggest that cortisol-induced stress does not affect the level of infection of Atlantic salmon with the parasite, however, it may retard repair of skin. The cortisol induced changes are in close concordance with the existing concept of wound healing cascade. </p...|$|R
40|$|Lake Whatcom, Washington kokanee {{have been}} stocked in Lake Roosevelt since 1987 {{with the primary}} {{objective}} of creating a self-sustaining fishery. Success has been limited by low recruitment to the fishery, low adult returns to hatcheries, and a skewed sex ratio. It was hypothesized that a stock native to the upper Columbia River might perform better than the coastal Lake Whatcom stock. Kokanee from Meadow Creek, a tributary of Kootenay Lake, British Columbia were selected as an alternative stock. <b>Post</b> <b>smolts</b> from each stock were released from Sherman Creek Hatchery in late June 2000 and repeated in 2001. Stock performance was evaluated using three measures; (1) number of returns to Sherman Creek, the primary egg collection facility, (2) the number of returns to 86 tributaries sampled and, (3) the number of returns to the creel. In two repeated experiments, neither Meadow Creek or Lake Whatcom kokanee appeared {{to be capable of}} providing a run of three-year old spawners to sustain stocking efforts. Less than 10 three-years olds from either stock were collected during the study period. Chi-square analysis indicated age two Meadow Creek kokanee returned to Sherman Creek and to other tributaries in significantly higher numbers when compared to the Lake Whatcom stock in both 2000 and 2001. However, preliminary data from the Spokane Tribe of Indians indicated {{that a large number of}} both stocks were precocial before they were stocked. The small number of hatchery three-year olds collected indicated that the current hatchery rearing and stocking methods will continue to produce a limited jacking run largely composed of precocious males and a small number of three-year olds. No kokanee from the study were collected during standard lake wide creel surveys. Supplemental creel data, including fishing derbies, test fisheries, and angler diaries, indicated anglers harvested two-year-old hatchery kokanee a month after release. The majority of the two-year old kokanee harvested were from a direct stock at the Fort Spokane boat launch. Only Lake Whatcom kokanee were stocked from the boat launch, therefore stock performance was not evaluated, however the high success of the stocking location will likely increase harvest of hatchery kokanee in the future. Despite low numbers of the targeted three-year olds, Meadow Creek kokanee should be stocked when possible to promote fish native to the upper Columbia River...|$|R
