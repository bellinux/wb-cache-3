5000|$|A {{peristaltic}} pump {{is a type}} of positive displacement pump used for pumping a variety of fluids. The fluid is contained within a flexible tube fitted inside a circular pump casing (though linear {{peristaltic pump}}s have been made). A rotor with a number of [...] "rollers", [...] "shoes", [...] "wipers", or [...] "lobes" [...] attached to the external circumference of the rotor compresses the flexible tube. As the rotor turns, the part of the tube under compression is <b>pinched</b> <b>closed</b> (or [...] "occludes") thus forcing the fluid to be pumped to move through the tube. Additionally, as the tube opens to its natural state after the passing of the cam ("restitution" [...] or [...] "resilience") fluid flow is induced to the pump. This process is called peristalsis and is used in many biological systems such as the gastrointestinal tract. Typically, there will be two or more rollers, or wipers, occluding the tube, trapping between them a body of fluid. The body of fluid is then transported, at ambient pressure, toward the pump outlet. Peristaltic pumps may run continuously, or they may be indexed through partial revolutions to deliver smaller amounts of fluid.|$|E
40|$|G. Pipoli and C. Sinestrari {{considered}} the mean curvature flow starting from a closed submanifold {{in the complex}} projective space. They proved that if the submanifold is of small codimension and satisfies a suitable pinching condition for the second fundamental form, then the flow has two possible behaviors: either the submanifold collapses to a round point in finite time, or it converges smoothly to a totally geodesic submanifold in infinite time. In this paper, we prove the similar results for the mean curvature flow starting from <b>pinched</b> <b>closed</b> submanifolds in (general) rank one symmetric spaces of compact type. Also, we prove that closed submanifolds in (general) rank one symmetric spaces of non-compact type collapse to a round point along the mean curvature flow under certain strict pinching condition for the norm of the second fundamental form.

40|$|The {{appeal of}} sweet {{electronic}} cigarette flavors makes {{it important to}} identify the chemical compounds that contribute to their sweetness. While volatile chemicals that produce sweet aromas {{have been identified in}} e-liquids, there are no published reports of sugars or artificial sweeteners in commercial e-liquids. However, the sweetener sucralose is marketed as an e-liquid additive to commercial flavors. The primary aims of the study were to determine if sucralose is delivered in sufficient concentration in the inhaled aerosol to enhance flavor sweetness, and whether the amount delivered depends on the e-liquid delivery system. Thirty-two adult smokers rated flavor intensity, sweetness, harshness and liking/disliking for 4 commercial flavors with and without sucralose (1 %) using 2 e-cigarette delivery systems (cartridge and tank). Participants alternately vaped normally or with the nose <b>pinched</b> <b>closed</b> to block perception of volatile flavor components via olfaction. LC/MS was used to measure the concentration of sucralose in the e-liquid aerosols using a device that mimicked vaping. Sweetness and flavor intensity were perceived much more strongly when olfaction was permitted. The contribution of sucralose to sweetness was significant only for the cartridge system, and the chemical analysis showed that the concentration of sucralose in the aerosol was higher when the cartridge was used. Together these findings indicate that future regulation of sweet flavor additives should focus first on the volatile constituents of e-liquids with the recognition that artificial sweeteners may also contribute to flavor sweetness depending upon e-cigarette design...|$|E

40|$|A spill-resistant vessel {{has been}} {{developed}} for dispensing an alkali-metal vapor. Vapors of alkali metals (most commonly, cesium or rubidium, both of which melt at temperatures slightly above room temperature) are needed for atomic frequency standards, experiments in spectroscopy, and experiments in laser cooling. Although the present spill-resistant alkali-metal dispenser was originally intended {{for use in the}} low-gravity environment of outer space, it can also be used in normal Earth gravitation: indeed, its utility as a vapor source was confirmed by use of cesium in a ground apparatus. The vessel is made of copper. It consists of an assembly of cylinders and flanges, shown in the figure. The uppermost cylinder is a fill tube. Initially, the vessel is evacuated, the alkali metal charge is distilled {{into the bottom of the}} vessel, and then the fill tube is <b>pinched</b> <b>closed</b> to form a vacuum seal. The innermost cylinder serves as the outlet for the vapor, yet prevents spilling by protruding above the surface of the alkali metal, no matter which way or how far the vessel is tilted. In the event (unlikely in normal Earth gravitation) that any drops of molten alkali metal have been shaken loose by vibration and are floating freely, a mesh cap on top of the inner cylinder prevents the drops from drifting out with the vapor. Liquid containment of the equivalent of 1. 2 grams of cesium was confirmed for all orientations with rubbing alcohol in one of the prototypes later used with cesium...|$|E

50|$|Retrograde {{ejaculation}} {{can also}} be a complication of diabetes, especially in cases of diabetics with long term poor blood sugar control. This is due to neuropathy of the bladder sphincter. Post-pubertal males (aged 17 to 20 years) who experience repeated episodes of retrograde ejaculation are often diagnosed with urethral stricture disease shortly after the initial complaint arises. It is currently not known whether a congenital malformation of the bulbous urethra is responsible, or if pressure applied {{to the base of the}} penis or perineum immediately preceding ejaculatory inevitability may have inadvertently damaged the urethra. This damage is most often seen within 0.5 cm of the ejaculatory duct (usually distal to the duct). Retrograde ejaculation can also result from <b>pinching</b> <b>closed</b> the urethral opening, to avoid creating a mess upon ejaculation (known as Hughes' technique).|$|R
40|$|A carpal hand, {{traumatic}} or congenital, is {{a challenge}} to the reconstruction of a useful pinch. Before the microsurgical era, the only possibility was the Krukenberg operation. But it gives an ugly appearance to the forearm, hence its use is generally limited to bilateral amputations on blind patients. Besides, one should also remember that it deprives the patient of the carpal joint. The authors present five cases of reconstruction by transfer of a single toe, the second one. There was no vascular failure. Three cases are successful function wise. One of the failures {{is due to the fact}} that the operation was undertaken too late; the patient never accepted the aspect of his new "hand". As for the other, in endeavouring to reconstruct a wide pinch, we set the toe too far away from the opposable element, which will necessitate another operation, in order to bring the two parts of the <b>pinch</b> <b>closer</b> to each other. The three successful cases demonstrate, however, that a good pinch can be created in one single operation: the transfer of the second toe provided a backstop is available-either steady or mobile, already existing or reconstructed-against which the transplanted toe can press...|$|R
