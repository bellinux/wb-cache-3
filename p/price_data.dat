5|$|The 1637 {{event was}} popularized in 1841 {{by the book}} Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds, written by British {{journalist}} Charles Mackay. At one point 12 acres (5 ha) of land were offered for a Semper Augustus bulb. Mackay claims that many such investors were ruined by the fall in prices, and Dutch commerce suffered a severe shock. Although Mackay's book is a classic, his account is contested. Many modern scholars feel that the mania was not as extraordinary as Mackay described and argue that not enough <b>price</b> <b>data</b> are available to prove that a tulip bulb bubble actually occurred.|$|E
25|$|As can be {{seen from}} the {{definitions}} above, if one already has price and quantity data (or, alternatively, price and expenditure data) for the base period, then calculating the Laspeyres index for a new period requires only new <b>price</b> <b>data.</b> In contrast, calculating many other indices (e.g., the Paasche index) for a new period requires both new <b>price</b> <b>data</b> and new quantity data (or, alternatively, both new <b>price</b> <b>data</b> and new expenditure data) for each new period. Collecting only new <b>price</b> <b>data</b> is often easier than collecting both new <b>price</b> <b>data</b> and new quantity data, so calculating the Laspeyres index for a new period tends to require less time and effort than calculating these other indices for a new period.|$|E
500|$|The lack of {{consistently}} recorded <b>price</b> <b>data</b> {{from the}} 1630s makes {{the extent of}} the tulip mania difficult to discern. The bulk of available data comes from anti-speculative pamphlets by [...] "Gaergoedt and Warmondt" [...] (GW) written just after the bubble. Economist Peter Garber collected data on the sales of 161 bulbs of 39 varieties between 1633 and 1637, with 53 being recorded by GW. [...] Ninety-eight sales were recorded for the last date of the bubble, 5 February 1637, at wildly varying prices. The sales were made using several market mechanisms: futures trading at the colleges, spot sales by growers, notarized futures sales by growers, and estate sales. [...] "To a great extent, the available <b>price</b> <b>data</b> are a blend of apples and oranges", according to Garber.|$|E

500|$|Garber {{compared}} the available <b>price</b> <b>data</b> on tulips to hyacinth {{prices at the}} beginning of the 19th century—when the hyacinth replaced the tulip as the fashionable flower—and found a similar pattern. When hyacinths were introduced florists strove with one another to grow beautiful hyacinth flowers, as demand was strong. However, as people became more accustomed to hyacinths the prices began to fall. The most expensive bulbs fell to 1 to 2percent of their peak value within 30years. Garber also notes that, [...] "a small quantity of prototype lily bulbs recently was sold for 1million guilders ($US480,000 at 1987 exchange rates)", demonstrating that even in the modern world, flowers can command extremely high prices. Because the rise in prices occurred after bulbs were planted for the year, growers would not have had an opportunity to increase production in response to price.|$|E

To predict the stock price, it needs historical stock <b>prices</b> <b>data.</b> Many providers are providing the data, {{but not all of}} them free. Some providers that provide historical stock <b>prices</b> <b>data</b> for free are Yahoo Finance, Google Finance, Stooq, and the National Stock Exchange (NSE) of India. However, often there are differences in data between providers both in terms of availability, content, data formats, and so on. Thus, investors need to take data from some providers to be compared in order to obtain optimal analytical results. Therefore, this study builds data management platform to curate the historical stock <b>prices</b> <b>data</b> from the four data sources as well equipped with technical analysis to facilitate analysis of investment.

2500|$|While Vaughan can be {{considered}} a forerunner of price index research, his analysis did not actually involve calculating an index. [...] In 1707 Englishman William Fleetwood created perhaps the first true price index. [...] An Oxford student asked Fleetwood to help show how prices had changed. [...] The student stood to lose his fellowship since a fifteenth-century stipulation barred students with annual incomes over five pounds from receiving a fellowship. [...] Fleetwood, who already had an interest in price change, had collected a large amount of <b>price</b> <b>data</b> going back hundreds of years. [...] Fleetwood proposed an index consisting of averaged price relatives and used his methods to show that the value of five pounds had changed greatly over the course of 260 years. He argued on behalf of the Oxford students and published his findings anonymously in a volume entitled Chronicon Preciosum.|$|E
2500|$|Under the {{implementation}} of the CDTA, Census is the authority responsible for collecting, managing, and analyzing data on diamond imports and exports and reporting it to KPCS. In 2003, Census reported that the United States had a greater number of exported diamonds than imported diamonds. Approximately 3 million carats worth of diamonds were exported in the US in 2003, leading, raising a concern on the accuracy and legitimacy of reports of Census reported to the KPCS. [...] Irregularities in the data reported through Census in 2003, are not the first of its occurrence. For example, in 2000 Belgium reported exporting $355 million worth of diamonds to the US, the United States however, only reported importing about $192 million. Census officials have identified anomalies within data results resulting from the misclassification of shipments by individual parties and a method initiated by the Census that altered the value of some shipments as it distorted the quantity of imports and exports based on outdated <b>price</b> <b>data.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Critics of the {{presidency}} of Cristina Fernández de Kirchner in Argentina and many economists believe {{that the government has}} for years falsified consumer <b>price</b> <b>data</b> to understate the country's true inflation rate. The Economist stated in January 2011 that Big Mac index [...] "does support claims that Argentina’s government is cooking the books. The gap between its average annual rate of burger inflation (19%) and its official rate (10%) is far bigger than in any other country." [...] That year the press began reporting on unusual behavior by the more than 200 Argentinean McDonald's restaurants. They no longer prominently advertised Big Macs for sale and the sandwich, both individually and as part of value meals, was being sold for an unusually low price compared to other items. Guillermo Moreno, Secretary of Commerce in the Kirchner government, reportedly forced McDonald's to sell the Big Mac at an artificially low price to manipulate the country's performance on the Big Mac index. In June 2012, the price of the Big Mac value meal suddenly rose by 26%, closer to that of other meals, after The Economist, The New York Times, and other media reported on the unusual pricing. A Buenos Aires newspaper stated [...] "Moreno loses the battle".|$|E

40|$|Modelling and {{forecasting}} of volatile {{data have}} become the area of interest in financial time series. Volatility {{refers to a condition}} where the conditional variance changes between extremely high and extremely low values. In the current study, modelling and forecasting will be carried out using two sets of real data namely crude oil prices and kijang emas prices. The models investigated are Box-Jenkins Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model and Generalized Autoregressive Conditionally Heteroscedasticity (GARCH) model. In estimating the parameters for the Box-Jenkins ARIMA model, two estimation methods are used. These are Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) and Ordinary Least Squares Estimation (OLS). The capabilities of these two methods in estimating the ARIMA models are evaluated by using Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). The modelling performances of ARIMA and GARCH models will be evaluated by using Akaike’s Information Criterion (AIC) while the forecasting performances of both models will be evaluated by using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). The processes of modelling and forecasting will be done by using R and Eviews statistical softwares. As a result of the study, it can be concluded that in terms of parameters estimation of ARIMA models, MLE gives more precise forecast for crude oil <b>prices</b> <b>data</b> while OLS gives more precise forecast for kijang emas <b>prices</b> <b>data.</b> In terms of forecasting performances between ARIMA and GARCH models, it can be concluded that GARCH is a better model for kijang emas <b>prices</b> <b>data</b> while ARIMA is a better model for crude oil <b>prices</b> <b>data...</b>|$|R

This was so that the amount of the next coupon was known at the start of each six-month interest accrual period. However, in 2005 the UK Debt Management Office announced that all new issues of index-linked gilts would use a three-month indexation lag, first used in the Canadian Real Return Bond market, and the majority of index-linked gilts now in issue are structured on that basis.|$|R

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe Truth In Negotiations Act (TINA) is a contracting statute {{that has been}} put into place {{in order to protect}} the Department of Defense’s funds by mandating that contractors provide certified cost or <b>pricing</b> <b>data.</b> When cost estimates exceed the TINA threshold ($ 700, 000), and when all other means of negotiating fair and reasonable pricing are not available, TINA ensures that a fair and reasonable price can be determined from the contractor submitted data. Despite its good intentions, TINA remains controversial. Supporters of TINA argue that certified cost or <b>pricing</b> <b>data</b> protects the government’s funding: if a later audit shows pricing deviations, the U. S. government can charge contractors penalties and recoup funds if necessary. Critics of TINA, however, argue that TINA does not provide the right incentives to contractors to induce their best efforts. In fact, with certain types of contracts on the contract type spectrum, the contractor and the government both may benefit if TINA provisions are modified to allow for flexibility with certified cost or <b>pricing</b> <b>data.</b> This study proposes to evaluate TINA from an economic view, with a contracting emphasis on investigating incentives that are generated under TINA. 1 st Lieutenant, United States Air ForceCaptain, United States Air Forc...|$|R
