40|$|The soft {{magnetic}} materials have potential applications {{in the field of}} bioengineering as carriers for targeted drug delivery. The magnetic properties, particle size <b>after</b> <b>coating,</b> Curie temperature and its biocompatibility are important parameters for the synthesis of materials. In the present communication cobalt ferrite nanoparticles have been synthesized using co-precipitation method and coated with sodium alginate. The X-ray diffraction and infrared spectroscopic measurements have been used to confirm the ferrite structure formation and coating of the samples with alginate. The SEM micrographs have been used to confirm the particle size which is found to be 45 nm before coating and 78 nm <b>after</b> <b>coating.</b> The saturation magnetization obtained using the hysteresis data for the uncoated cobalt ferrite sample is 19. 8 emu/gm while for the coated sample it reduces to 10. 2 emu/gm. The AC susceptibility measurements indicate SP structure for the uncoated samples with Curie temperature less than 100 ℃. The thermo gravimetric measurements have been used to estimate the amount of alginate coating on the sample and it has been correlated with retention of magnetic properties <b>after</b> <b>coating.</b> The value of saturation magnetization reduces <b>after</b> <b>coating</b> due to mass reduction of magnetic material in the sample in accordance with the TGA measurements...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{effect of}} Co–P-CNT coating on the {{magnetic}} properties of grain oriented electrical steel was investigated. To analyse the coating, Raman spectroscopy, Superconducting QUantum Interference Device (SQUID), single strip testing, Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and talysurf surface profilometry were performed. Raman spectra showed the D and G band which corroborates {{the presence of}} Multi-Walled Carbon Nanotubes (MWCNT) in the coating. The magnetic nature of the coating was confirmed by SQUID results. Power loss results show an improvement ranging 13 – 15 % <b>after</b> <b>coating</b> with Co–P-CNT. The resistivity of the coating {{was measured to be}} 104 µΩcm. Loss separation graphs were plotted before and <b>after</b> <b>coating</b> to study the improvement in power loss. It was found that the coating helps in reducing the hysteresis loss. The thickness of the coating was found to be 414 ± 40 nm. The surface profilometry results showed that the surface roughness improved <b>after</b> <b>coating</b> the sample...|$|R

40|$|Grain {{oriented}} electrical steels (GOES) are {{coated with}} aluminium orthophosphate {{on top of}} a forsterite (Mg 2 SiO 4) layer to provide stress and insulation resistance to reduce the power loss and magnetostriction. In this work Chromium Aluminium Nitride (CrAlN) was coated on GOES samples with electron beam physical vapour deposition and was tested in the single strip and magnetostriction tester to measure the power loss and magnetostriction before and <b>after</b> <b>coating.</b> Power loss was reduced by 2 % <b>after</b> <b>coating</b> and 6 % post annealing at 800 [*]°C. For applied compressive stress of 6 MPa, the magnetostrictive strain was zero with the CrAlN coating as compared to 22 and 24 μϵ for fully finished GOES and GOES without phosphate coating. The thickness of the coating was found to be 1. 9 ± 0. 2 μm estimated with Glow Discharge Optical Emission Spectroscopy (GDOES). The magnetic domain imaging showed domain narrowing <b>after</b> <b>coating.</b> The reduction in power loss and magnetostriction was due to the large residual compressive stress and Young’s modulus (270 GPa) of the coating...|$|R
40|$|The field {{emission}} characteristics of individual Mo emitters were measured {{before and after}} diamond deposition, as well as before and <b>after</b> annealing. <b>After</b> <b>coating</b> without annealing, the emission current increased dramatically. Subsequent annealing resulted in further increases in emission and improved current stability. <b>After</b> <b>coating,</b> the energy distribution of the emitted electrons was found to shift with applied field. Annealing reduced the peak shift but resulted in {{the appearance of a}} second peak, coincident with the formation of Mo 2 C at the diamond-molybdenum interface. These changes in the emission spectra in conjunction with I-V data are discussed in terms of possible changes in emission mechanism...|$|R

40|$|The {{motivation}} for these experiments {{has been to}} investigate {{the influence of a}} biocompatible protective coating on diaphragm-based in vivo sensors. The investigated device is a resonator for fish identification. Such a diaphragm-based configuration is also commonly used for pressure sensors. Six passive ID tags with a set of acoustic resonators have been coated with a 12 nm thin TiO 2 film by the atomic layer deposition (ALD) technique. The frequency response in the 200 kHz to 400 kHz range has been measured in water before and <b>after</b> <b>coating.</b> The resonance peaks can still be detected <b>after</b> <b>coating,</b> but an increase in the resonance frequencies of about 2 % is measured. The increase is explained by a thicker diaphragm due to the TiO 2 film...|$|R
40|$|The {{idea of a}} {{bioactive}} {{surface coating}} that enhances bone healing and bone growth is a strong focus of on-going research for bone implant materials. Enamel matrix derivate (EMD) is well documented to support bone regeneration and activates growth of mesenchymal tissues. Thus, it is a prime candidate for coating of existing implant surfaces. The {{aim of this study}} was to show that cathodic polarization can be used for coating commercially available implant surfaces with an immobilized but functional and bio-available surface layer of EMD. <b>After</b> <b>coating,</b> XPS revealed EMD-related bindings on the surface while SIMS showed incorporation of EMD into the surface. The hydride layer of the original surface could be activated for coating in an integrated one-step process that did not require any pre-treatment of the surface. SEM images showed nano-spheres and nano-rods on coated surfaces that were EMD-related. Moreover, the surface roughness remained unchanged <b>after</b> <b>coating,</b> as it was shown by optical profilometry. The mass peaks observed in the matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectroscopy (MALDI-TOF MS) analysis confirmed the integrity of EMD <b>after</b> <b>coating.</b> Assessment of the bioavailability suggested that the modified surfaces were active for osteoblast like MC 3 M 3 -E 1 cells in showing enhanced Coll- 1 gene expression and ALP activity...|$|R

40|$|In this study, {{a simple}} wet {{encapsulation}} method {{was used to}} coat the nano calcium carbonate particles at the temperature of 80 °C.

TGA analysis proved that the coated nanoparticles has the same stability with uncoated particles at temperature below 230 °C.

40|$|To {{mitigate}} {{electron cloud}} in particle accelerators a carbon coating with low SEY (Secondary Electron Yield) has been developed. In {{the case of}} the SPS (Super Proton Synchrotron), which belongs to the LHC injector chain, testing of the performance of coated beam pipes directly in the accelerator must cope with the schedule of the regular machine operation. For this reason an alternative tool based on RF induced multipacting in a coaxial configuration has been designed for ex-situ characterization of the main bending dipoles of the SPS. In this contribution we report the results obtained before and <b>after</b> <b>coating</b> for two 6. 4 meter dipoles with different cross sections of the vacuum chambers. The multipacting is monitored by measuring the pressure rise and the RF reflected power. <b>After</b> <b>coating,</b> the power threshold to induce multipacting is strongly reduced indicating a lower propensity for electron cloud. The impact of the RF coupling on the sensitivity of the technique is discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{electrochemical}} {{and thermal}} stability of LiNi 0. 8 Co 0. 16 Al 0. 04 O 2 were studied {{before and after}} Co 3 (PO 4) 2 coating. Different to conventional coating material such as ZrO 2 or AlPO 4, the coating layer was not detected clearly by TEM analysis, indicating that the Co 3 (PO 4) 2 nanoparticles effectively reacted with surface impurities such as Li 2 CO 3. The coated sample showed similar capacity at a low C rate condition. However, the rate capability was significantly improved by the coating effect. It {{is associated with a}} decrease of impedance <b>after</b> <b>coating</b> because impedance can act as a major barrier for overall cell performances in high C rate cycling. In the DSC profile of the charged sample, exothermic peaks were shifted to high temperatures and heat generation was reduced <b>after</b> <b>coating,</b> indicating the thermal reaction between electrode and electrolyte was sucessfully suppressed by Co 3 (PO 4) 2 nanoparticle coating...|$|R
