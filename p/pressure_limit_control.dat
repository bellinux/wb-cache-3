40|$|Abstract. The recent {{trend to}} farming or re-domestication of feral goats poses serious {{questions}} for the ecological sustainability of the semiarid and arid rangelands of southern Australia. This paper reviews aspects of the biology and grazing habits of goats, and aspects of the Australian goat industry, relevant to their sustainable management in livestock enterprises. Key factors identified include high fertility and fecundity even under low seasonal rainfall conditions and a generalist feeding strategy. Adverse consequences for rangeland condition can be expected if seasonal or market conditions result in an imbalance between population growth and turnoff, resulting in high grazing <b>pressures.</b> Given the <b>limited</b> <b>control</b> of the reproductive process at the current stage {{of the development of}} goat farming, strategies aimed at ensuring continuity of sale of goats (e. g. on-property feed lots or supply chain and market development) will be important in ensuring that imbalances are avoided. Conservative stocking rates and use of seasonal risk management tools are also particularly relevant. The major research and development needs identified by this review, from a resource management perspective, concern the appropriate dry sheep equivalent rating for goat classes based on age, sex and reproductive status, the extent and consequences of heterogeneity of grazing in space, time, and across forage species, and development of means of establishing sustainable stocking rates based on the use of all available forage sources, including browse...|$|R

Injecting pressurized cold CO 2 into a reservoir will trigger two geomechanically coupled phenomena, hydro- and thermomechanical coupling, which should be taken into account when determining the maximum sustainable <b>pressure</b> <b>limit.</b> In this regard, we briefly introduce poroelastic and thermally induced stresses as cold fluid is injected into a geologic formation. We then propose new equations that incorporate pore-pressure/stress coupling and thermal stress effects to calculate for various stress regimes—including normal-, reverse-, and strike-slip faulting—the maximum <b>pressure</b> <b>limit</b> before reactivation of preexisting fractures. The suggested equations are tested for a case study in the literature in which the maximum <b>pressure</b> <b>limit</b> was estimated based on complex numerical simulations. Lastly, sensitivity analysis based on these suggested equations sheds light on how sensitive the maximum <b>pressure</b> <b>limit</b> is to several input parameters, including saturated rock density, Biot's coefficient, Poisson's ratio, initial total horizontal-to- vertical stress ratio, temperature drop, and Young's modulus...|$|R

40|$|The Goddard {{problem is}} that of maximizing the final {{altitude}} for a vertically ascending, rocket-powered vehicle {{under the influence of}} an inverse square gravitational field and atmospheric drag. The present paper deals with the effects of two additional constraints, namely, a dynamic <b>pressure</b> <b>limit</b> and specified final time. Nine different switching structures involving zero-thrust arcs, full-thrust arcs, singular-thrust arcs, and state-constrained arcs are obtained when the value of the dynamic <b>pressure</b> <b>limit</b> is varied between zero and infinity and the final time is specified between the minimum possible time within which all of the fuel can be burned and the natural final time that emerges for the problem with final time unspecified. For all points in the aforementioned domain of dynamic <b>pressure</b> <b>limit</b> and prescribed final time, the associated optimal switching structure is clearly identified. Finally, a simple intuitive feedback law is presented for the free time problem. For all values of prescribed dynamic <b>pressure</b> <b>limit,</b> this strategy yields a loss in final altitude of less than 3 percent with respect to the associated optimal solution...|$|R

40|$|In {{the oil and}} gas {{industry}} a new technology known as Managed Pressure Drilling (MPD) is emerging, allowing for faster and more accurate well pressure control. MPD differs from conventional drilling methods by closing the well using a controlled choke, often in combination with a backpressure pump allowing for automatic pressure control. When the drill string is extended the pipe is typically sealed of and detached from the MPD system. This process is time consuming and <b>limits</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>control,</b> because the mud flow is stopped. The Continuous Circulation System was developed to allow for better pressure control during connections and reducing connection time. For these technologies to become viable for use on floating rigs advanced control algorithms are necessary. To be able to test such system simulators are necessary. In this thesis a transmission line containing the mud column in the pipe and the annulus coupled through an elastic pipe is presented in the frequency domain. A set of Robin boundary conditions representing CCS is developed and coupled with a pressure node. A Ritz approximation is developed in order to discretize the transmission line, and the Laguerre-Gram model order reduction method is applied to obtain rational transfer function approximation. Some likely numerical issues are discussed with this method...|$|R

40|$|In this dissertation, an {{analytical}} investigation on active, semi-active and passive vibration control mechanisms {{is presented in}} order to achieve improved shock and vibration isolation of mechanical systems, especially ground vehicle applications. A hybrid active vibration isolation system, incorporating an electro-magnetic force generator along with passive damping and spring elements, is mathematically modeled based on fundamental physical laws and taking into account the generator dynamics. Complete vibration isolation characteristics of the hybrid active control system are evaluated for various feedback variables and control schemes, using numerical simulations. Influence of the force generator dynamics on vibration isolation performance is illustrated through the simulation results. A concept of tunable <b>pressure</b> <b>limiting</b> modulation is proposed in hydraulic damper systems. A hydraulic orifice damper is modified by using the proposed tunable <b>pressure</b> <b>limiting</b> modulation to achieve variable damping in vibration isolation systems, without requiring any external energy source, sophisticated control devices and feedback instrumentation that are essential for active and semi-active isolators. The fluid flow equations are employed to develop the nonlinear mathematical model of the hydraulic damper, incorporating the fluid and mechanical compliance, and the dynamics of the <b>pressure</b> <b>limiting</b> mechanism. The computer simulation reveals that the shock and vibration isolation performance of the tunable <b>pressure</b> <b>limited</b> hydraulic damper systems is comparable to that of the semi-active 'on-off' vibration control systems. A generalized harmonic linearization technique, based on a principle of energy similarity of dynamic elements, is proposed to derive equivalent linear representations of both nonlinear damping and spring elements, in the frequency domain. An analysis of the nonlinear in-plane vehicle model, with air-springs, orifice damping and <b>pressure</b> <b>limiting</b> modulation due to tunable hydraulic shock absorbers, is carried out to establish the stochastic response to random road inputs in terms of power spectral density, and to illustrate the improved vehicle ride performance due to tunable shock absorbers.

Analysis of a roll plane model of a vehicle employing the tunable interconnected suspension shows that the connections of fluid flow within the interconnected suspension provide an enhanced static roll stability; while the tunable <b>pressure</b> <b>limiting</b> modulation between the strut and the accumulator of each suspension unit offers an improved vehicle ride performanc...|$|R
