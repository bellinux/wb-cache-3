5|$|Coinciding {{with the}} {{issuance}} of the first advisory on the tropical depression, {{the government of the}} Dominican Republic issued a tropical storm watch from Barahona to its border with Haiti, while a tropical storm watch was issued from Haiti's border with the Dominican Republic westward to Port-au-Prince. The United States' National Hurricane Center in Miami recommended interests in eastern Cuba to monitor the <b>progress</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> storm. When the depression was 205miles (330km) south-southeast of Santo Domingo, the Dominican Republic issued a tropical storm warning from Punta Palenque to its border with Haiti. While located 155miles (250km) from the coast of Hispaniola, the government of the Dominican Republic extended the tropical storm warning eastward to Isla Saona, while the government of Haiti upgraded its watch area to a tropical storm warning along the coast. The National Hurricane Center also recommended citizens in the Bahamas to monitor the <b>progress</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> storm. After the heavy rainfall began in the Dominican Republic, officials evacuated citizens of low-lying areas.|$|E

Uncut, the film runs for over 220 minutes, but the theatrical release was heavily cut at 183 minutes. The film released coinciding with the festival of Thai Pongal on 14 January 2010, with a Telugu dubbing version, titled Yuganikki Okkadu, following six weeks later. Upon release, the film received mixed reviews whilst proceeding to become a successful venture commercially.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of his}} {{endeavour}} {{to expose}} the public to more foreign-language works, Johnson facilitated the translation of educational texts, serious fiction, and philosophy (he was less interested in translating popular novels). In particular, he promoted the translation {{of the works of}} persecuted French Girondins, such as Condorcet's Outlines of an Historical View of the <b>Progress</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Human Mind (1795) and Madame Roland's An Appeal to Impartial Posterity (1795), which he had released in English within weeks of its debut in France. His publication of a translation of Constanin Volney's deistic Les Ruines, ou méditations sur les révolutions des empires (1791) quickly became a bestseller. Johnson also had some of the most prominent French children's literature translated, such as the works of Madame de Genlis.|$|E

In April, Leiber and Stoller were called for a meeting in New York City to show the <b>progress</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> repertoire. The writers, who had not produced any material, toured the city and were confronted {{in a hotel room}} by Jean Aberbach, who locked them into their hotel room by blocking the hotel room door with a sofa until they wrote the material. Presley recorded the soundtrack at Radio Recorders in Hollywood on April 30 and May 3, with an additional session at the MGM Soundstage on May 9. During post-production, the songs were dubbed into the films scenes, in which Presley mimed the lyrics.|$|E

The <b>progress</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Australian assault was slowed by thick vegetation {{and the size of}} the position, even as the resistance slackened and volume of fire diminished. Indeed, the bunker system was later found to cover nearly a square kilometre and was wider than the front of the assaulting company. Painstakingly the Australians searched each bunker systematically. With the action now over, D Company and the tanks subsequently linked up with B Company and established a night defensive position.|$|E
5|$|Early in the {{duration}} of the cyclone, the National Hurricane Center recommended for interests along the coast of southwestern Mexico to monitor the <b>progress</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> storm. Upon regaining tropical storm status on June 1, the governments of Guatemala and Mexico issued a tropical storm watch from Sipacate, Guatemala to Barra de Tonala, Mexico. Later, as the track became more apparent, the watch was replaced by a tropical storm warning, and a tropical storm watch was extended westward to Salina Cruz, Mexico. Officials in Mexico allocated emergency funds for southern regions of Chiapas and Oaxaca in preparation for a potential flooding disaster. At least 1,400people were evacuated in Chiapas to emergency shelters.|$|E

In 1171, Henry arrived in Ireland in order to review the general <b>progress</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> expedition. He wanted to re-exert royal authority over the invasion which was expanding beyond his control. Henry successfully re-imposed his authority over Strongbow and the Cambro-Norman warlords and persuaded many of the Irish kings to accept him as their overlord, an arrangement confirmed in the 1175 Treaty of Windsor.|$|E

Altogether 26 climate change adaptation activities were proposed for the fiscal year 2071 / 72 among them 46 % activities were implemented completely, 19 % activities were started but not implemented and 35 % activities were not implemented. The physical and financial <b>progresses</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> CAPs were 41. 79 % and 27. 47 % respectively. For ensuring <b>the</b> effective implementation <b>of</b> CAPs mainstreaming them into local level development plan is recommended.
