5|$|Most Germans were {{relieved}} that the conflicts and street fighting of the Weimar era had ended. They were deluged with propaganda orchestrated by Joseph Goebbels, who promised peace and <b>plenty</b> <b>for</b> {{all in a}} united, Marxist-free country without {{the constraints of the}} Versailles Treaty. The first major Nazi concentration camp, initially for political prisoners, was opened at Dachau in 1933. Hundreds of camps of varying size and function were created {{by the end of the}} war. Upon seizing power, the Nazis took repressive measures against their political opposition and rapidly began the comprehensive marginalisation of persons they considered socially undesirable. Under the guise of combating the Communist threat, the National Socialists secured immense power. Above all, their campaign against Jews living in Germany gained momentum.|$|E
25|$|Most {{bacteria}} do {{not live}} in environments that contain large amounts of nutrients at all times. To accommodate these transient levels of nutrients bacteria contain several different methods of nutrient storage in times of <b>plenty</b> <b>for</b> use in times of want. For example, many bacteria store excess carbon in the form of polyhydroxyalkanoates or glycogen. Some microbes store soluble nutrients such as nitrate in vacuoles. Sulfur is most often stored as elemental (S0) granules which can be deposited either intra- or extracellularly. Sulfur granules are especially common in bacteria that use hydrogen sulfide as an electron source. Most of the above-mentioned examples can be viewed using a microscope and are surrounded by a thin nonunit membrane to separate them from the cytoplasm.|$|E
25|$|Sun Quan's long reign is {{regarded}} as a time of <b>plenty</b> <b>for</b> his southern state. Migrations from the north and the settlement of the Shanyue increased manpower for agriculture, especially along the lower reaches of the Yangtze and in Kuaiji Commandery along the southern shore of Hangzhou Bay. River transport blossomed, with the construction of the Zhedong and Jiangnan canals. Trade with Shu flourished, with a huge influx of Shu cotton and the development of celadon and metal industries. Ocean transport was improved {{to such an extent that}} sea journeys were made to Manchuria and the island of Taiwan. In the south, Wu merchants reached Linyi (Southern Vietnam) and Funan Kingdom. As the economy prospered, so too did the arts and culture. In the Yangtze delta, the first Buddhist influences reached the south from Luoyang.|$|E

25|$|There {{have been}} {{contrasting}} judgments where employees have given lifts in their vehicles, during hours of employment, {{as to whether}} their employers can be vicariously liable. Two similar cases demonstrate this problem. The first, Conway v George Wimpey & Co Ltd involved a driver, who, despite express prohibitions, gave a lift to an employee of another firm, and negligently injured him in an accident. No liability was imposed on the employer, as this was deemed to be an activity outside of the employee's duties. This {{can be compared to}} Rose v Plenty, where liability was imposed where a small boy was injured in a road accident, while helping a milkman on his rounds. It has been stated that these two decisions are not reconcilable. However, Lord Denning offered some justification in Rose v <b>Plenty</b> <b>for</b> the distinction, stating that the employee, in allowing the boy to assist him, was not acting outside of his employment, but acting in furtherance of it (through the boy assisting his duties).|$|E

When strikes occurred, he would walk the picket lines with the workers. [...] Voorhis gave lectures at Pomona College from 1930 until 1935.

Lynch though that Kurt was [...] "out of line" [...] when he [...] "declared Quinn didn't {{know what it was}} like to truly suffer". He noted that she was [...] "kicked out of her house and disowned by her father while pregnant" [...] and added, [...] "she's suffered <b>plenty</b> <b>for</b> a teenager". He said about the episode's final scene, which ended as the car Quinn was driving was about to be hit by a rapidly moving truck, [...] "you can't help but feel sucker-punched when something like this happens". Flandez called it a [...] "cowardly ending", but Canning praised the [...] "good cliffhanger", and the [...] "subtle enough" [...] storytelling that did not [...] "telegraph anything" [...] before the closing sequence.|$|E

500|$|Caryn Ganz from Rolling Stone {{said that}} Hard Candy {{is the work}} of [...] "a songwriting team of American chart royalty" [...] that helps Madonna [...] "revisit her roots as an urban-disco queen. [...] For Hard Candy, she lets top-shelf {{producers}} make her their plaything." [...] Ben Thompson from The Guardian commented on the music by saying that [...] "Hard Candy is a tough, nuggety confection offering <b>plenty</b> <b>for</b> listeners to get their teeth into. [...] Whenever [...] threatens to get boring, something always happens to recapture your interest." [...] Sarah Hajibegari from The Times felt that while [...] "Hard Candy is no disaster", the album's producers have [...] "already done the same thing with Nelly Furtado, Britney Spears and Gwen Stefani." [...] Andy Gill from The Independent said that the album portrayed Madonna as [...] "how a once diverse talent has ossified into simply satisfying the sweet tooth of functional dance-pop." [...] Thomas Hausner from PopMatters wrote that the album [...] "is overpopulated with recycled pop that is indistinguishable and artificial, something Madonna's soothing arpeggiating vocals cannot alleviate".|$|E
500|$|Monica Herrera of Billboard {{commented that}} the {{prevalent}} use of Auto-Tune on Kesha's vocals {{made it difficult to}} tell if she could actually sing, citing the song [...] "Take It Off" [...] as an example of [...] "how easily individuality can get lost in a sea of Auto-Tune". On the other hand, Herrera was impressed with the [...] "choruses that stick with the listener for days." [...] David Jeffries of AllMusic was not impressed with the album's ballads, calling them [...] "completely unsatisfying." [...] However, he noted [...] "that with so many fun, 'Tik Tok'-type tracks, the album has <b>plenty</b> <b>for</b> both brats and the bratty at heart." [...] James Reed of The Boston Globe believed that Kesha's [...] "personality is completely missing from ," [...] resulting in her sounding [...] "vapid and faceless." [...] Jonathan Keefe of Slant Magazine was extremely critical of the album and Kesha, saying that her attempts to sing and rap were [...] "pitiful", describing her as [...] "insincere" [...] and [...] "souless". Dave Simpson of The Guardian also questioned the honesty of her lyrics while comparing her unfavorably to Lady Gaga, Katy Perry, and Britney Spears.|$|E
500|$|Mark Robson was {{strongly}} considered {{and was in}} talks to direct, but after seeing The Omen, the producers hired Richard Donner. Donner had previously been planning [...] when he was hired in January 1977 for $1million to direct Superman and Superman II. Donner felt {{it was best to}} start from scratch. [...] "They had prepared the picture for a year and not one bit was useful to me." [...] Donner was dissatisfied with the campy script and brought in Tom Mankiewicz to perform a rewrite. According to Mankiewicz [...] "not a word from the Puzo script was used." [...] "It was a well-written, but still a ridiculous script. It was 550 pages. I said, 'You can't shoot this screenplay because you'll be shooting for five years'," [...] Donner continued. [...] "That was literally a shooting script and they planned to shoot all 550 pages. You know, 110 pages is <b>plenty</b> <b>for</b> a script, so even for two features, that was way too much." [...] Mankiewicz conceived having each Kryptonian family wear a crest resembling a different letter, justifying the 'S' on Superman's costume. The Writers Guild of America refused to credit Mankiewicz for his rewrites, so Donner gave him a creative consultant credit, much to the annoyance of the Guild.|$|E
