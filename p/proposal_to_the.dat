5|$|Despite this setback, Longton and Stoke {{submitted}} their <b>proposal</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Local Government Board {{in early}} 1907. A local inquiry was held soon afterwards in Stoke, which reported back quickly and in April 1907 informed both Stoke and Longton councils {{that the proposed}} scheme was not sufficiently comprehensive and suggested holding another conference between the six towns to discuss a more complete proposal. The meeting took place in July and was addressed by John Burns, president of the Local Government Board, who called {{for a number of}} local conferences to agree a scheme for federation of all six towns.|$|E
5|$|In 1902, the {{commission}} submitted a threefold plan of <b>proposal</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> government. First, the immediate dangers {{should be avoided}} by resetting the corners, removing stones that endangered the adjacent parts, strengthening the first balustrades and restoring several niches, archways, stupas and the main dome. Second, after fencing off the courtyards, proper maintenance should be provided and drainage should be improved by restoring floors and spouts. Third, all loose stones should be removed, the monument cleared {{up to the first}} balustrades, disfigured stones removed and the main dome restored. The total cost was estimated at that time around 48,800 Dutch guilders.|$|E
5|$|On 3 December 1942, the USAAF {{sent out}} a Request for Proposals (RfP) for a {{diminutive}} piston-engined fighter. By January 1944, the Air Technical Service Command refined the RfP and in January1945, the specifications were further revised in MX-472 to specify a jet-powered aircraft. Although a number of aerospace companies studied the feasibility of such aircraft, McDonnell was the only company to submit a <b>proposal</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> original 1942 request and later revised requirements. The company's Model 27 proposal was completely reworked to meet the new specifications.|$|E

5|$|As {{a member}} of the Board of Consultants to a {{committee}} appointed by Truman, Oppenheimer strongly influenced the Acheson–Lilienthal Report. In this report, the committee advocated creation of an international Atomic Development Authority, which would own all fissionable material and the means of its production, such as mines and laboratories, and atomic power plants where it could be used for peaceful energy production. Bernard Baruch was appointed to translate this report into a <b>proposal</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> United Nations, resulting in the Baruch Plan of 1946. The Baruch Plan introduced many additional provisions regarding enforcement, in particular requiring inspection of the Soviet Union's uranium resources. The Baruch Plan was seen as an attempt to maintain the United States' nuclear monopoly and was rejected by the Soviets. With this, it became clear to Oppenheimer that an arms race was unavoidable, due to the mutual suspicion of the United States and the Soviet Union, which even Oppenheimer was starting to distrust.|$|E
5|$|Colorado held several {{meetings}} to convince reluctant Utah officials they {{would benefit from}} a freeway link between Denver and Salt Lake City. Utah officials expressed concerns that, given the terrain between these cities, this link {{would be difficult to}} build. They later expressed concerns that the construction would drain resources from completing Interstate Highways they deemed to have a higher priority. Colorado officials persisted, presenting three alternatives to route I-70 west of Denver, using the corridors of US40, US6 and a route starting at Pueblo, proceeding west along US50/US285/US24. In March 1955, Colorado officials succeeded in convincing Utah officials with the state legislature passing a resolution supporting a link with Denver. The two states jointly issued a <b>proposal</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> U.S. Congress that would extend the plans for I-70 along the US6 corridor. Under this proposal the freeway would terminate at I-15 near Spanish Fork, Utah, linking the Front Range and Wasatch Front metropolitan areas.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the success}} of the 1973 film Metro-land, which {{documented}} life in suburban London, Edward Mirzoeff was commissioned to create a new documentary with John Betjeman. Mirzoeff noticed that aside from suburban themes, the Church of England was the other major influence on Betjeman's poetry. His <b>proposal</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> poet was for a study of the Church of England to be titled Failed in Divinity, a line derived from Betjeman's poetic autobiography Summoned by Bells, in which the poet relates how was sent down from the University of Oxford after failing a compulsory examination on divinity. In Mirzoeff's first treatment, Betjeman would have embarked on a journey around Britain studying fine cathedrals, churches and their congregations. Betjeman ruled against the title, but liked the idea, although he was keen that the film should be primarily about the Church and its people, and not himself.|$|E

On 9 July 1946 he presented a <b>proposal</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> cabinet outlining {{the creation of a}} technological-based university in NSW, as a separate institution to the existing Sydney Technical College and a year later cabinet authorised the appointment of a Developmental Council, chaired by Heffron, to bring the new tertiary institution into existence. First meeting in August 1947, the council established all the guidelines and regulations that would set-up the future institution and by March 1948, 46 students had already enrolled to study.|$|E
5|$|Historically, many {{prospective}} Australian uranium mines {{have been}} constrained by active antinuclear opposition, but state governments have now approved mine development in Western Australia and Queensland. But {{it is unlikely}} that any new projects will enter active development until the market improves. As of 2013 uranium prices are very low. Cameco placed the Kintyre project on hold until market prices improve and Paladin has stated that its project proposals (Bigrlyi, Angela/Pamela, Manyingee, Oobagooma, and Valhalla/Skal) need higher uranium market prices before they can proceed. Toro wants to take the Wiluna <b>proposal</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> development phase, but has not been successful in attracting equity investors. When market prices go up again, so that mine development is justified, most projects would need at least five years to proceed to production.|$|E
5|$|In 1961, the British Transport Commission, {{together}} with the British Iron and Steel Federation and Sheffield Chamber of Commerce considered plans to upgrade the navigation to handle 250-tonne barges, and work started on new wharfs and warehouses at Rotherham. Control of the navigation passed on again in 1963, this time to the British Waterways Board, who submitted a <b>proposal</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> government for a £2.5million upgrade, covering the stretch from Bramwith to Rotherham. This would have involved the construction of ten new locks, each , to replace the existing 12 locks. The new main line would then {{have been the same}} size as the Aire and Calder Navigation, although some of the bridges would have had less clearance. In 1972, a further proposal for a £2million scheme to upgrade the waterway to handle 700-tonne barges up to Mexborough, and 400-tonne barges from there to Rotherham was submitted to the Department of the Environment.|$|E

5|$|In a <b>proposal</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> 11th plenum of the 9th Central Committee, Võ Văn Kiệt {{suggested}} democratizing {{the political}} system by giving the delegates to a party congress the power to elect the general secretary, the Central Committee and the Central Commission for Inspection, and giving congress delegates ultimate power on all matters put before them at the congress. He called for {{the reduction of the}} Central Committee from one-fourth to one-third, holding the elections of state leaders at the National Assembly {{in the immediate aftermath of}} a congress (and not a year later), secret ballots for elections, empowering delegates to self-nominate to the Central Committee and merging the offices of President and General Secretary into one. These suggestions, with the exception of holding the National Assembly elections earlier, were rejected at the 11th plenum of the 9th Central Committee in January 2005.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, {{the state of}} New York {{submitted}} a <b>proposal</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials that would substantially alter how the Outer Loop was numbered. As part of the plan, the NY47 designation would be eliminated {{while most of the}} northeastern section of the Outer Loop—from I-490 in Rochester to NY104 (former US104) to Irondequoit—would become the northernmost part of I-590. A replacement designation for NY47 north of NY104 was not named at the time. Most of the proposed changes took effect on March18, 1980, when NY47 was eliminated; however, I-590 was modified to end at its junction with I-490. In its place, the Rochester–Irondequoit leg of the Outer Loop was assigned NY590, which continued north to Sea Breeze over former NY47.|$|E

As part of the plan, the NY47 designation would be eliminated while the northwestern section of the Outer Loop—from I-490 in Gates to the proposed northern terminus at the Lake Ontario Parkway in Greece—would become the northernmost part of I-390. Most of the proposed changes took effect on March18, 1980, when NY47 was eliminated; however, I-390 was modified to end at its junction with I-490. In its place, the Gates–Greece leg of the Outer Loop was assigned NY390. The NY390 designation was extended northward to its current terminus in the early 1980s when the segment of the Outer Loop between NY104 and the Lake Ontario State Parkway was completed.|$|E

5|$|The {{site was}} found on a clifftop {{immediately}} north of the village of Bruneval, which was itself twelve miles north of Le Havre, and was the most accessible German radar site that had been found so far by the British; several other installations were further inland in France, and others were {{as far away as}} Romania and Bulgaria. A request for a raid on the Bruneval site to capture a Würzburg system was passed on to Admiral Lord Louis Mountbatten, the commander of Combined Operations. Mountbatten in turn took the <b>proposal</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Chiefs of Staff Committee, who approved the raid after a brief debate.|$|E
5|$|Heinrich Olbers {{discovered}} Pallas in 1802, {{the year}} after the discovery of Ceres. He proposed that the two objects were the remnants of a destroyed planet. He sent a letter with his <b>proposal</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> English astronomer William Herschel, suggesting that a search near the locations where the orbits of Ceres and Pallas intersected might reveal more fragments. These orbital intersections were located in the constellations of Cetus and Virgo. Olbers commenced his search in 1802, and on 29 March 1807 he discovered Vesta in the constellation Virgo—a coincidence, because Ceres, Pallas, and Vesta are not fragments of a larger body. Because the asteroid Juno had been discovered in 1804, this made Vesta the fourth object to be identified in the region that is now known as the asteroid belt. The discovery was announced in a letter addressed to German astronomer Johann H. Schröter dated 31 March. Because Olbers already had credit for discovering a planet (Pallas; at the time, the asteroids were considered to be planets), he gave the honor of naming his new discovery to German mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss, whose orbital calculations had enabled astronomers to confirm the existence of Ceres, the first asteroid, and who had computed the orbit of the new planet in the remarkably short time of 10 hours. Gauss decided on the Roman virgin goddess of home and hearth, Vesta.|$|E
5|$|In August 1934, the Bassendean Road Board {{applied to}} the Lands Department to change {{the portion of the}} Perth–Guildford road within its {{district}} to Great Eastern Highway. The department refused the request, reasoning that most traffic bound for Midland used The Causeway and travelled {{on the south side of}} the Swan River, and that therefore the Perth–Guildford road should not be part of the main highway. Despite this setback, the Perth Road Board organised a local government conference to consider renaming the road from Perth to Guildford. The issue was considered important, as losing the name to the south side of the river would divert traffic away from the old established centres to the north. The straightening of dangerous bends and the replacement of an old bridge between Bassendean and Guildford were also to be considered. The conference, held on 7 September 1934, was attended by representatives of the Perth, Bayswater, Bassendean, and Guildford road boards, and the Midland Junction Council. Guildford and Midland Junction were still opposed to the renaming, but the others were supportive. Motions that passed included submitting a rename <b>proposal</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> state government, urging the government to construct a new bridge at Bassendean, and approaching the government to have the road declared a main road.|$|E
