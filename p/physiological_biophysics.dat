40|$|There is an idiom that “biophysicist is who {{discusses}} about biology when meets physicist, {{talks about}} physics when meets biologist and says joke when meets another biophysicist”. This idiom points to multidisciplinary nature of biophysics {{but what really}} is the biophysics? And who is the biophysicist? Biophysics was defined as: "that branch of knowledge that applies the principles of physics and chemistry and the methods of mathematical analysis and computer modeling {{to understand how the}} mechanisms of biological systems work” in homepage of Biophysical Society. Biophysics may be thought of as the central circle in a two-dimensional array of overlapping circles, which include physics, chemistry, physiology, and general biology. Two wings of Biophysics are Biology and physics. Organisms are made of biomaterials, which can be studied by physical laws, since physical principles and laws hold from microscopic level to macroscopic level. Biophysicist selects a part of biological problems that are pliable to interpret by physical principles and then formulate hypotheses that can be tested by experiment 2. Historically, bioluminescence can be considered among the earliest biophysical phenomena. The modern biophysics appeared by discovering of molecular structure of myoglobin and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). There is no doubt that Biophysics as a multidisciplinary science covers wide spectrum of subjects as follows: Instrumental biophysics, Radiation Biophysics and radiobiology, Structural biology, <b>Physiological</b> <b>biophysics,</b> bio-cybernetics, Membrane Biophysics, Molecular biophysics, Bioenergetics, Mathematical and theoretical biophysics and Biophysical Chemistry. And the final question, do you still believe the above idiom about the biophysicist...|$|E

Title of diploma thesis: The {{influence of}} preload on change of mechanical {{properties of the}} aortic walls The subject of this thesis is to monitor the influence of preload on change the mechanical properties of the aortic walls. Department of Biophysics and Physical Chemistry Faculty of Pharmacy of Charles University in Hradec Kralove studies the mechanical properties of the biological materials or synthetic materials for many years. The aim of this work is to continue research on measurements of {{the properties of the}} arterial walls, because the changes in the mechanical properties are associated with aging and may cause a wide range of cardiovascular diseases. The theoretical part is devoted to the anatomical and histological structure of the aorta walls. Summarizes theoretical knowledges of biomechanics and rheology of viscoelastic bodies. It describes the <b>physiological</b> functions and <b>biophysics</b> of the bloodstream. And also is focused on pathological changes that are related to changes in mechanical properties. The experimental part is focused on the type and preparation of biological material, creation of samples, [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{technological}} advances have changed biology from a largely data-limited, qualitative science {{to one of}} increasing quantitation that spans wide ranges of space and time. This transition creates two important downstream needs, the first aimed at large-scale data storage and analysis (Bioinformatics), and the second at simulation and prediction (Computational Physiology and <b>Biophysics).</b> <b>Physiological</b> function depends on the spatial and temporal dynamics of specific genes, proteins, signaling molecules, and metabolites within and between cells. Realistic physiological simulations present a grand challenge because of {{the wide range of}} underlying space and time scales, as well as the widely disparate organization and properties of different cells. Real cells, as opposed to typical textbook cartoons, are highly organized and structured. The relevant spatial dimensions within and around cytoskeletal components, membranous organelles, and macromolecular complexes are generally on the scale of tens of nm, and thus are on the same approximate scale as macromolecular complexes themselves. Many such complexes function as molecular machines, illustrating the discrete, discontinuous nature of cellular physiology and the need for spatially realistic simulations. Spatially realistic cell models are presently {{the exception rather than the}} rule. In the past this was a direct consequence of inadequate computing power, and even on today’s massively parallel machines...|$|R
