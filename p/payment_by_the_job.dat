40|$|A "decoupled" {{liability}} {{system is}} one in which the award to the plaintiff differs from <b>the</b> <b>payment</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> defendant. The optimal system of decoupling makes the defendant's payment as high as possible. Such a policy allows the award to the plaintiff to be lowered, thereby reducing the plaintiff's incentive to sue [...] and hence litigation costs [...] without sacrificing the defendant's incentive to exercise care. The optimal award to the plaintiff may be less than or greater than <b>the</b> optimal <b>payment</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> defendant. The possibility of an out-of-court settlement does not qualitatively affect these results. If the settlement can be monitored, it may be desirable to decouple it as well. ...|$|R
