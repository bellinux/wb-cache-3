40|$|National audienceA subject's {{emotional}} {{expression is}} of course influenced by his personality, but several other factors can play a role. His position, the constraints he undergoes, or the setting of his working space can all deeply impact emotional expression through movement. When performing an automatic emotion recognition, an evaluator {{must be able to}} set up some parameters for the recognition so as to adapt to the evaluation conditions. Current recognition system do not allow for such adaptability. In this paper we present the eMotion software for movement-based emotion recognition. eMotion's software architecture allows easy integration of graphical widgets for <b>parametering</b> emotional features extraction to suit the task at hand...|$|E
40|$|The {{need for}} a {{decrease}} in the energy consumption of buildings implies an adequate understanding of control strategies. This requires an intensive use of simulation tools for the design and test of controllers of HVAC equipment. It is noticed that simulation software commonly used in control engineering do not provide any model of HVAC equipment. The SIMBAD project has been set up to develop a toolbox of such models adapted to the needs in the control field. As the toolbox is mainly conceived for users who are not necessarily "experts " in HVAC equipment, the user-friendliness of the models is a major concern in the development work. This includes a hierarchical structure for the description of systems, an insight of physical phenomena involved in the models visible on the graphical interface, an enhanced <b>parametering</b> mode and availability of parameters of models...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn {{order to}} be used in various {{contexts}} of training, a desirable property for a virtual environment for training, especially a collaborative one, is adaptability. In this paper, we identify two levels of adaptability the environment should offer. The first level concerns the <b>parametering</b> of the components of the application, especially the scenario and the actors' behavior. The second level appears during the execution of the application where the actors should be able to adapt the scenario xecution to the context. The models proposed in this paper fully satisfy those requirements. The scenario, the virtual world, the actors and the training session can be parametrized. Moreover, an action selection mechanism enables the actors to dynamically choose an action to perform depending on both the current context and the past actions. Finally we validate our models by presenting an illustrative scenario within the GVT environment...|$|E

40|$|The main aim of {{this study}} is to derive some simple rules for an optimal {{management}} of direct electric heating in residential buildings. Optimal management should minimise the running cost of heating while maintaining comfort, in the case of control strategies involving intermittent heating. This study has been carried out with the help of numerical simulation in a graphical environment [1] in order to study the behaviour of a whole system, referred to as a simulator, which consists of the building zone, the heating system and the controller. We chose an optimisation function of a mathematical software [2] to determine the optimal value of the operating cost. The coupling between the simulator and the optimisation algorithm is done automatically during the simulation in order to determine the optimal management scenario. The relevance of the work lies in the coupling between the simulator and the optimisation algorithm. This coupling was made possible thanks to the structuring of the simulator following a modelling methodology and <b>parametering</b> rules developed by CSTB [3]. The methodology enabled an efficient modelling of the system to carry out the optimisation analysis automatically on a large number of cases. The analysis by "experiment plans " on the simulation results obtained allowed the definition of rules for the optimal management of direct electric heating. This paper mainly presents the modelling methodology implemented. It lays emphasis on the use of existing mathematical tools. It does not give the results of the study but analyses one of the stages of intermittent heating considered in the study...|$|E
