50|$|Shweshwe is {{manufactured}} with an acid discharge and {{roller printing}} technique on pure cotton calico. It is printed in widths of 90 cm, in all-over patterns and A-shaped skirt panels printed side by side. The fabric is manufactured in various colours including the original indigo, chocolate brown and red, {{in a large}} variety of designs including florals, stripes, and diamond, square and circular geometric patterns. The intricate designs are made using <b>picotage,</b> a pinning fabric printing technique rarely used by contemporary fabric manufacturers due to its complexity and expense, although the design effects have been replicated using modern fabric printing techniques.|$|E
