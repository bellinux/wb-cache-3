500|$|... "It's Not the End of the World?" [...] is [...] "a romantic {{song about}} growing old" [...] {{according}} to singer Gruff Rhys. In {{an interview with}} British newspaper The Daily Telegraph Rhys discussed the song {{in the context of}} parent record Rings Around the World. The band abandoned the idea of making a [...] "save the world" [...] concept album as they reasoned that [...] "when <b>people</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> saving the world they're really talking about saving humans. The reality is that humans are the problem". [...] "It's Not the End of the World?" [...] expands on this idea with Rhys stating that the song is about the extinction of the human race: [...] "maybe we'll all die but the world'll still be here, even if it's a dark, singed piece of rock flying around the sun". The track was recorded in 2000 at Bearsville Studios, Woodstock and was produced by the Super Furry Animals and Chris Shaw.|$|E

During an interview with Rolling Stone, Fantasia said the following about the song's message: [...] "I wanted people to know that I've been through the rain, I 've been broken into pieces, I had a daughter at such a young age. There were times people would say, 'That's it for her,' but that didn't happen." [...] Christian Todays Czarina Ong referred to [...] "I Made It" [...] as Fantasia's [...] "victory song" [...] and [...] "her song of success". According to Rito P.

Rupert Wyatt, director of Rise of the Planet of the Apes (2011), {{said in an interview}} that he thinks of Nolan as a [...] "trailblazer... he is to be hugely admired as a master filmmaker, but also someone who has given others behind him a stick to beat back the naysayers who never thought a modern mass audience would be willing to embrace story and character as much as spectacle". Michael Mann complimented Nolan for his [...] "singular vision" [...] and called him [...] "a complete auteur". Nicolas Roeg said of Nolan, [...] " [...] films have a magic to them ... <b>People</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> 'commercial art' and the term is usually self-negating; Nolan works in the commercial arena and yet there's something very poetic about his work." [...] Martin Scorsese identified Nolan as a filmmaker creating [...] "beautifully made films on a big scale".|$|E
500|$|Press in Europe {{ranged from}} mixed to negative. The press in Germany {{did not like}} the film. At the Berlin premiere, a writer for The New York Times wrote [...] "Whatever you think of the {{director}} Charles [...] Theodor Dreyer, there is no denying that he is 'different.' He does things that make <b>people</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> him. You may find his films ridiculous—but you won't forget them...Although in many ways [...] {{was one of the worst}} films I have ever attended, there were some scenes in it that gripped with brutal directness". Press reaction to the film in Paris was mixed. Reporter Herbert Matthews of The New York Times wrote that Vampyr was [...] "a hallucinating film", that [...] "either held the spectators spellbound as in a long nightmare or else moved them to hysterical laughter". For many years after Vampyrs initial release, the film was viewed by critics as one of Dreyer's weaker works.|$|E
500|$|The Cure's primary musical traits {{have been}} listed as [...] "dominant, melodic bass lines; whiny, strangulated vocals; and a lyric {{obsession}} with existential, almost literary despair." [...] Most Cure songs start with Smith and Gallup writing the drum parts and bass lines. Both record demos {{at home and}} then bring them into the studio for fine-tuning. Smith said in 1992, [...] "I think when <b>people</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> the 'Cure sound', they mean songs based on six-string bass, acoustic guitar and my voice, plus the string sound from the Solina." [...] On top of this foundation is laid [...] "towering layers of guitars and synthesisers". Keyboards have been {{a component of the}} band's sound since Seventeen Seconds, and their importance increased with the instrument's extensive use on Disintegration. During Roger O'Donnell's absence between 2005 and 2011, keyboards were not used at all during their live shows, and were not as prominent on their 2008 album 4:13 Dream.|$|E

500|$|Hunt played several instruments, {{including}} guitar, keyboards, drums, bass synthesizer, and {{the electronic}} drum. When he finished writing and recording the demos, Hunt began the album's primary recording sessions at Santa Fe Tracking Station in Los Angeles. With What Were You Hoping For?, Hunt pursued a [...] "harder edge" [...] and rawer aesthetic than featured on his previous work. He {{also wanted to}} explore a self-described [...] "gnarly" [...] guitar sound inspired {{by the work of}} Muddy Waters and The Stooges' 1973 album Raw Power. Hunt attempted the sound in the past, but encountered discouragement from management. He discussed his direction for the album in an interview for The Boombox, stating [...] "t wasn't necessarily punk music. It was more about trying to capture the growl of a cello. That to me is as nasty as it can get. That's a beautiful sound to me. When <b>people</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> the distortion on the guitar, I hear the same thing with that growl of a cello." [...] Hunt wanted to take advantage of his newfound feeling of artistic freedom and lack of concern over marketability.|$|E

On September 8, 2015, Bevin met with Davis in the jail and later attended a rally organized by Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee celebrating her subsequent release. Following a September debate at Bellarmine University, Bevin said, [...] "My intention {{has always been to}} execute this race on financial issues, on economic issues. In the last several weeks, 85 percent of what <b>people</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> are these social issues. ... I think the issue has redefined this race whether any of us candidates want {{that to be the case}} or not." [...] Associated Press reporter Adam Beam wrote that the Davis case [...] "ignited the passions of religious conservatives in an already conservative state", and University of Kentucky political science professor Stephen Voss opined that a campaign focused on cultural and social issues would be [...] "bad for Conway".|$|E
500|$|Jet {{magazine}} reported [...] "Janet's innovative stage performances {{during her}} world tours have won her {{a reputation as}} a world-class performer." [...] Chris Willman of Los Angeles Times stated the [...] "enthralling" [...] choreography of Jackson's Rhythm Nation 1814 Tour [...] "represents the pinnacle of what can be done in the popping 'n' locking style—a rapid-fire mixture of rigidly jerky and gracefully fluid movements." [...] When Jackson was asked [...] "do you understand it when <b>people</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> [...] in terms of Broadway?", she responded, [...] "I'm crazy about Broadway ... That's what I grew up on." [...] Her [...] "Number Ones: Up Close and Personal" [...] tour deviated from the full-scale theatrics found in her previous concert arena settings in favor of smaller venues. Critics noted being scaled down did not affect the impact of her showmanship, and in some cases, enhanced it. Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune wrote, [...] "In past tours, Jackson's thin voice was often swallowed up by the sheer size of her production... In the more scaled-down setting, Jackson brought a warmth and a passion that wasn't always evident in stadiums... the best Janet Jackson performance I've covered in 20-plus years." ...|$|E

500|$|The Prince-inspired [...] "Cross Dresser" [...] has a {{new wave}} style and {{whimsical}} lyrics in which the narrator holds on {{to the memory of}} his lost love by wearing her clothes. Hunt said that he did not intend for the song to have a meaning other than the explicit: [...] "I just thought it was funny. It's {{one of those things that}} <b>people</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about,</b> but that's never really happened to me. But I literally wrote it in 20 minutes. It felt good ... It was really quick and I just thought it was something silly and funny." [...] "It's a Mysterious Hustle" [...] features somber strings, a languid rhythm, an eerie piano vamp, and bitter singing by Hunt. It was recorded solely by Hunt, who played guitar, keyboards, and electronic drums. Its lyrics are about having to [...] "work your way through the crowd" [...] and [...] "overcome the place you come from", and view the world as [...] "no place to raise a child". Its spoken word conclusion preaches, [...] "If you follow the beaten path, it will keep you tied to the past." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{cast and}} crew of The X-Files reacted {{positively}} to the episode. Gillian Anderson cited the episode as being among her highlights of the third season.

[...] Chris Carter said of writer Darin Morgan, [...] "It's been a wonderful coincidence of timing, talent, {{and the success of}} the show, allowing it to stretch in a direction it would never have been able to {{if it had been a}} less successful or if it had been a younger show. Darin is a truly original comic mind. I don't know anybody in the world working in film, and that's what we work in here even though it appears on television, who has the voice Darin has. He is one in many million." [...] Co-Producer Paul Rabwin said of the episode [...] "An instant classic. One of those seminal episodes. You know, when <b>people</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> The Twilight Zone, they say 'Remember [...] "Eye of the Beholder"?' Or [...] "Trouble With Tribbles" [...] on the original [...] 'Jose Chung' is going to be one of those episodes that is immediately revered." [...] Assistant director Tom Braidwood appreciated Charles Nelson Reilly's presence, saying that he captivated virtually everyone and gave everyone a lift, nicknaming everyone on the crew.
