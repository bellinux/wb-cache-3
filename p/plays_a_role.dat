40|$|Abstract In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} the relation between beliefs and goals in agent theory. Beliefs play three roles in reasoning about goals: they <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>role</b> in the generation of unconditional desires from conditional ones, they <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>role</b> in adoption of desires as goals, and they <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>role</b> {{in the selection of}} plans to achieve goals. In this paper {{we consider the}} role of goals in reasoning about beliefs. Though we assume that goals do not <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>role</b> in the belief generation problem, we argue that they <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>role</b> in the belief selection problem. We show the rationality of the use of goals in belief selection, in the sense that there are cases in which agents that take their goals into account in selecting a belief set from a set of alternatives outperform agents that do not do so. We also formally distinguish between the rational role of goals in belief selection and irrational wishful thinking...|$|R

5|$|AMPK {{probably}} also <b>plays</b> <b>a</b> <b>role</b> in increased peripheral insulin sensitivity, as metformin administration increases AMPK activity in skeletal muscle. AMPK {{is known to}} cause GLUT4 deployment to the plasma membrane, resulting in insulin-independent glucose uptake. Some metabolic actions of metformin do appear to occur by AMPK-independent mechanisms; the metabolic actions of metformin in the heart muscle can occur independent of changes in AMPK activity and may be mediated by p38 MAPK- and PKC-dependent mechanisms.|$|E
