40|$|The {{anticoagulant}} rodenticides {{were discovered}} in the 1940 s and their advantages of efficacy and safety quickly resulted in their use dominating the practice of rodent control in temperate countries. However, the development {{of resistance to the}} early compounds within a decade stimulated research culminating in the invention of anew class of anticoagulant, the second generation compounds, active against resistant strains but also overall far more potent than those previously available. A novel baiting strategy, <b>pulsed</b> <b>baiting,</b> was developed to make full use of this valuable characteristic. <b>Pulsed</b> <b>baiting</b> has enabled the use of second generation anticoagulants in situations where early products were of limited value, particularly in tropical agriculture. The future of this highly-successful group of compounds is reviewed in relation to resistance and the difficulty and cost of developing further rodenticides...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: The single {{nucleotide}} polymorphism (SNP), and consequent amino acid exchange from tyrosine to cysteine at location 139 of the vkorc 1 gene (i. e. tyrosine 139 cysteine or Y 139 C), is the most widespread anticoagulant resistance mutation in Norway rats (Rattus norvegicus Berk.) in Europe. Field trials were conducted to determine incidence of the Y 139 C SNP at two rat infested farms in Westphalia, Germany, and to estimate the practical efficacy against them of applications, using a <b>pulsed</b> <b>baiting</b> treatment regime, of a proprietary bait (KleratTM) containing 50 ppm brodifacoum. RESULTS: DNA analysis for the Y 139 C mutation showed that resistant rats were prevalent at the two farms, with an incidence of 80. 0...|$|E
40|$|Four {{rodent control}} techniques-sustained baiting (SB) with coumachlor. <b>pulsed</b> <b>baiting</b> (PB) with brodifacoum. a lethal {{electrified}} barrier (LEB), and a nonlethal electrified barrier (NLEB) -were evaluated on the experimental farm of the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) in the Philippines. A fifth treatment (no experimental rodent control) was established for reference. Mean tiller damage and rodent activity, respectively. near harvest were 1. 00 % 1 and 1. 5 % in the LEB plots, 1. 6 % and 18. 0 % in the SB plots, 2. 1 % and 16. 0 % in the PB plots, and 4. 1 % and 32. 5 % in the NLEB plots. Highest mean tiller damage (9. 3 %) and rodent activity (56. 0 %) occurred in plots with no experimental rodent control. Both baiting methods (SB and PB) were {{less expensive than}} barrier methods (LEB and NLEB). During an 80 -day crop protection period prevalent on the IRRl experimental farm, the total cost per hectare (US$) for protecting experimental plots from rodent damage was $ 26 for SB. $ 27 for PB, $ 268 for NLEB, and S 1285 for LEB. Baiting methods were more cost-effective and are recommended for general rodent control on research farms that can tolerate ≤ 2 % rodent damage without losing experimental data. For small research plots demanding {{a greater degree of}} protection, an effective barrier system such as the LEB or a combination of the NLEB and LEB should be used...|$|E
40|$|The {{disadvantages}} of the acute, fast-acting, rodenticides are well {{understood by the}} specialist. However, despite poison-shyness and consequent short-lived, low efficacy rodent control, many users prefer 2 ̆ 2 acutes 2 ̆ 2 such as zinc phosphide to 2 ̆ 2 first-generation 2 ̆ 2 anticoagulants of the warfarin type. The techniques necessary for efficient use of the first-generation anticoagulants are often inappropriate, particularly in agriculture. High labour and bait inputs required are unacceptable and are, together {{with the need for}} area coordinated control programs, significantly responsible for lack of widespread use of anticoagulants, even in those countries with a long history both of disastrous rodent damage to crops and rodent damage research and training centers. There are other problems, too, including widespread antithesis to prophylactic rodent control, perhaps in part due to the inherent low efficacy of acutes and the impractical nature (often leading to low efficacy) of first-generation anticoagulant baiting procedures. The advent of a highly potent but slow-acting rodenticide molecule, brodifacoum, has allowed the development of the <b>pulsed</b> <b>baiting</b> technique. This practical technique is highly effective and offers very significant savings both in bait and labour compared to first-generation anticoagulants, with excellent levels of control. Single applications are more effective than single applications of acute toxicants. Now used in agricultural and urban control programs, the technique is proving to be very cost-effective and highly acceptable, both to educated campaign organizers and uneducated users. The theory, development and cost-effectiveness of the technique are considered together with the experience gained from its use over more than 4 million hectares of agricultural land. Use of the technique allows for the first time practical and efficient agricultural rodent control...|$|E
