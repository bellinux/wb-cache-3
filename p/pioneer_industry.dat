5000|$|Three {{days after}} the incident, The New York Times carried a piece {{covering}} the event. Britain today weighed {{the cost of a}} stunning blow to her proudest <b>pioneer</b> <b>industry</b> - jet civil aviation - as the crash of another Comet airliner was confirmed. Twenty-one persons, including three Americans, were believed to have died when the plane was lost in the Mediterranean. The discovery of at least six bodies and bits of wreckage floating in the sea about [...] south of Naples put a pall on the last hopes for the British Overseas Airways Corporation craft, missing since 6:57 o'clock last night.Tonight the Minister of Transport, A. T. Lennox-Boyd withdrew from all Comets the certificate of airworthiness that the aircraft won on 20 January 1952, 'pending further detailed investigations into the causes of the recent disasters.'This second, unexplained Comet crash in three months came less than three weeks after the sleek four-jet de Havilland airliner had been restored to commercial service with about 60 safety modifications. They had been grounded for 10 weeks since the previous Comet crash10 Jan into the Mediterranean near the island of Elba with 35 dead.Early today they were grounded again. Sir Miles Thomas, chairman of the airline, said the new crash was 'a very great tragedy and a major setback for British civil aviation.' The New York Times, 10 April 1954 ...|$|E
40|$|Within the Tolovana Mining District, as {{a result}} of placer mining, 800 acres of land have been {{disturbed}} (0. 25 % of the land area) and 4 million cubic yards of much have been transported down the Tolovana River through the subsiding Minto Flats. This has increased the rate of sedimentation of the lakes adjacent to the Tolovana River. Mine tailings are about 50 % revegetated by natural species. Approximately 60 million cubic yards of muck must be removed to mine the Livengood deposits. A large area of settling ponds will be needed if the deposit is stripped by hydraulic means, or a large area for stacking overburden if mechanical stripping is required. The Crooked Creek area, mined for 80 years has 1, 900 acres disturbed (0. 7 % of the land area) and 200, 000 cubic yards of much has been stripped. No correlation is apparent between mining and the non-anadromous fish population, although sport fishing is considered by some to be not as good {{as a result}} of mining. Portions of the stream system observed to be impacted with mud showed evidence of having been periodically flushed out. Slave analysis and trace element analysis were applied in an attempt to trace sediments back to their sources, but were not successful. Mining is the <b>pioneer</b> <b>industry</b> around which much of the State of Alaska developed. The transportation network required by the mining industry benefits sportsmen, the tour industry, and directly increases the value of adjacent land. The profit from mining brought much of the early population to the state, and will be a steady source of revenue in years to come...|$|E
40|$|AbstractAn industrial, {{automated}} superchilling {{process line}} needs {{to combine the}} requirement for gentle handling of a valuable raw material with demands for energy efficiency, high capacity and product quality. The results {{from the study of}} three alterative process lines for superchilled processing of fresh cod showed large variations with respect to processing time, need for manual operations, skinning errors and yield. The processing time and need for operators was very high for the Marel superchilling concept, while the quality and yield was high. The alternative involving skinning in a Baader 59 unit followed by superchilling in an impingement freezer was very rapid and showed competitive results for quality and yield. Superchilling in the impingement freezer followed by skinning in the Baade 59 unit resulted in a substantial amount of skinning errors in spite of very rapid processing. An efficient process presupposes a high yield combined with efficient production, large capacity, few operators, few skinning errors and an end product of high quality. The results from the current experiments indicate that superchilled processing of cod by means of skinning in the Baader 59 unit followed by superchilling in the Impingement freezer would be the most competitive alternative, taken the above mentioned factors into account. The method implies short processing time, low amount of skinning errors, little manual operation as well as high yield and quality. a Superchilling is a robust method for conserving fresh food, and brings along many possibilities due to the extended product shelf-life. In the near future it is considered likely that most industrial processing of fresh fish will be done by means of superchilling, and the <b>pioneer</b> <b>industry</b> currently taking on the method will have a great advantage based on the experience from final development and implementation of the superchilling technology...|$|E

40|$|This {{study is}} about {{organisational}} {{control in the}} information age. Organisational control is examined through the changing landscape of power, subject and organisation. The focus is on examining escapes from the traditional practice of organisational control and the spaces of freedom which open up for workers to exercise their own agency. This examination {{takes place in the}} avant-garde professional work organisations of a <b>pioneer</b> <b>industry</b> in the world's leading information society, Finland. Theoretically, the study draws on the later works of Michel Foucault and on Critical Management Studies. Empirically, the contemporary operation of organisational control is examined as a case study, in which the Finnish mobile content providing industry constitutes the case. The research is qualitative, consisting of semi-structured interviews and thematic analyses. The findings indicate that the contemporary worker is a subject rather than an object. This impacts on organisational control, as objects can be externally controlled, but subjects cannot. Correspondingly, the ways of controlling and the locus of control have changed from external to internal. The traditional structures of domination, practices of management and preconceived worker subjectivities are largely absent in the organisations researched - and instead there is self-control. This form of control operates through the subjects actively working upon themselves and their own conduct. In contemporary organisations this culminates in the practice of self-management. Self-management is founded on the premise of agency. Overall, the means of control are no longer supported by structures of domination or based upon disciplinary techniques, but rely on relational, pastoral, power. This form of power operates directly through subjectivity. There is no objectifying system, but a subjectifying self. The findings also indicate that contemporary organisations, or any part of them, are no longer viewed as socio-technical systems that can be externally managed and controlled Instead they are seen as essentially consisting of human social processes - lateral relations, which are deeply embedded in action and in their contextuality, historicity and politicality. By implication, social processes and agency need to be incorporated into the analysis, and the social and political reality of organising, managing and working put on the agenda of future organisational research...|$|E
40|$|Title: The Effect of Integrating 1 st-tier Suppliers {{into the}} Product Development Process on the Environmental Performance – A Study in the German Automotive Industry Background: The {{research}} {{of this paper}} is based on the topics of 1 st-tier supplier integration into the product development process and corporate social responsibility, with the environmental dimension as field of research. Furthermore, the German automotive industry is selected as a sample industry in which research is undertaken. Purpose: This research aims on finding a relation between 1 st-tier supplier integration into the product development process and environmental performance. The dyad being examined is manufacturer and their 1 st-tier suppliers – from the manufacturer’s point of view. I investigate the effect of supplier integration on the environmental performance in order to see whether the integration concept can support organizations in reaching their goals of customer satisfaction and image preservation. The German automotive industry is being utilized as it is recognized as <b>pioneer</b> <b>industry</b> in order to make an example for other sectors on how to measure 1 st-tier suppliers’ environmental performance and how to efficiently integrate them in the manufacturer’s product development with the overall aim of enhancing environmental performance of manufacturers. Method: A qualitative research approach with multiple case studies based on semi-structured interviews has been applied for empirical data collection. The gathered data of three cases has been analyzed in a cross-case synthesis comparing the different cases {{with each other and with}} peer-reviewed literature. Results, conclusion: The gathered empirical information showed that German car manufacturers only rarely measure their 1 st-tier suppliers’ environmental performance due to close and long-term relationships; additionally, the ISO 14001 standard is a minimum criterion of being a supplier in this industry and some quotes regarding 3 environmental performance are being forwarded to suppliers by manufacturers. In terms of 1 st-tier supplier integration research shows in contrast to literature that the process of integration is not as relevant as other factors such as the supplier, the product and components. Regarding the 1 st-tier supplier integration into the product development process affecting manufacturers’ environmental performance, the research at hand has shown a positive correlation. I believe that these results can be an example for other industries and dyads within the industry...|$|E
40|$|The genesis, {{and even}} more the growth, of the {{international}} banana industry is intimately {{bound up with the}} development of steamships (from 1850 onwards) and with the spread of railway construction around the world. The coming of steam, which ensured consistent and swifter passage from the Caribbean and Central America to the United States, and later to Europe, meant that bananas could be delivered in good condition rather than rotten, as had happened in earlier days. Later, when refrigerated techniques became available and specialised vessels were built, transport of bananas ceased to be a major problem. Railways were an essential counterpart in the transport chain, being the adaptable way of moving the crop from the plantation to the shipside; and increasingly the profits from banana exports became the preferred method of financing rail construction in Central America. The working paper traces developments from the earliest commercial days, probably in Panama, closely followed by Jamaica, certainly by 1870. This was very much a <b>pioneer</b> <b>industry,</b> with firms set up and joint ventures created, only to collapse as rapidly when a ship or its cargo was lost at sea. At the plantation end it was literally jungle clearance and thousands of workers lost to disease, as well as creating the port, rail, housing and other infrastructure from scratch. Towering names in the industry – Capt. Dow Baker, Andrew Preston, Minor Cooper Keith, Samuel Zemurray, all of whom established, managed and expanded the United Fruit Company in Boston – pass through the pages. Elders & Fyffes in London, which became a United Fruit subsidiary, exported from Jamaica to develop the British market from 1900 on, and later spread the trade into continental Europe before the First World War. Other firms, such as Standard Fruit, also competed in Jamaica and in Central America and would later become parts of the Dole Food Company and of Del Monte. [The paper reports the creation of a ‘Banana Empire’, based on the growth of largely autonomous enclaves within host countries; the early example of vertical integration as a model for global, industrial development; and the significant role of monoculture practices in banana cultivation and of virulent banana diseases. ...|$|E

40|$|The ParaSight F {{test was}} {{developed}} as a <b>pioneer</b> <b>industry</b> effort in the large-scale, process-controlled production of a device for the rapid diagnosis of malaria. This device performed well in field settings but {{was limited to the}} detection of a single malaria species, Plasmodium falciparum. The ParaSight F+V assay advanced upon the ParaSight F test format by incorporating a monoclonal antibody directed against a proprietary Plasmodium vivax-specific antigen, in addition to the antibody directed against P. falciparum histidine-rich protein 2, which was used in the ParaSight F assay. The modified assay was developed to add the capability to detect P. falciparum and P. vivax in a single-test-strip format. The present study evaluated three distinct ParaSight F+V prototypes with samples from symptomatic patients in regions of Thailand and Peru where malaria is endemic. Over a 2 -year enrollment period (1998 and 1999), a total of 4, 894 patients consented to participation in the study. Compared with the results for duplicate microscopic examinations of Giemsa-stained blood smears as the reference diagnostic standard, each successive prototype showed substantial improvement in performance. The final ParaSight F+V prototype, evaluated in 1999, had an overall sensitivity for detection of asexual P. falciparum parasites of 98 %. The sensitivity of the device was 100 % for P. falciparum densities of > 500 parasites/μl, with a sensitivity of 83 % for parasite densities of ≤ 500 /μl. The specificity for the exclusion of P. falciparum was 93 %. For P. vivax, the overall sensitivity was 87 % for the final 1999 prototype. The sensitivities calculated for different levels of P. vivax parasitemia were 99 % for parasite densities of > 5, 000 /μl, 92 % for parasite densities of 1, 001 to 5, 000 /μl, 94 % for parasite densities of 501 to 1, 000 /μl, and 55 % for parasite densities of 1 to 500 /μl. The specificity for the exclusion of P. vivax was 87 %. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves for the diagnostic performance of the assay for the detection of P. falciparum and P. vivax were 0. 8907 and 0. 8522, respectively. These findings indicate that assays for rapid diagnosis have the potential to enhance diagnostic capabilities in those instances in which skilled microscopy is not readily available...|$|E
