5|$|Herodotus {{provides}} a dubious account of Darius's ascension: Several days after Gaumata had been assassinated, Darius {{and the other}} six nobles discussed {{the fate of the}} empire. At first, the seven discussed the form of government; a democratic republic was strongly pushed by Otanes, an oligarchy was pushed by Megabyzus, while Darius <b>pushed</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> monarchy. After stating that a republic would lead to corruption and internal fighting, while a monarchy would be led with a single-mindedness not possible in other governments, Darius was able to convince the other nobles.|$|E

Plans resurfaced {{for the road}} in the 1950s when a group of officials led by State Senator Frank S. Farley <b>pushed</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> road to help the area economy. The New Jersey Expressway Authority was created in 1962 to be responsible for building an expressway. The Atlantic City Expressway was built between 1962 and 1965 at a total cost of $48.2 million. The South Jersey Transportation Authority assumed control of the road in 1991 from the New Jersey Expressway Authority.|$|E
5|$|Quisling {{had earlier}} <b>pushed</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> {{corporate}} {{alternative to the}} Parliament of Norway, the Storting, which he called a Riksting. It would comprise two chambers, the Næringsting (Economic Chamber) and Kulturting (Cultural Chamber). Now, in advance of Nasjonal Samling's eighth and last national convention on 25 September and becoming increasingly distrustful of professional bodies, he changed his mind. The Riksting became an advisory body while the Førerting, or Fører Council, and parliamentary chambers were now to be independent bodies subordinate to their respective ministries.|$|E
5|$|Shoup's {{opposition}} to the war only increased over time; he initially <b>pushed</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> negotiated settlement but later supported a unilateral pullout from the country. As the Vietnamization strategy took effect and the U.S. increased its air operations, he remained opposed to any strategy that risked a nuclear war with China or the Soviet Union. His criticism attracted more press as the war became a stalemate. It also became highly publicized through discourse among the anti-war movement.|$|E

He and Sharif agreed to form a coalition government, ending American hopes of a power-sharing deal between him and Musharraf. They agreed to restore the judiciary, but Zardari took a less stringent stance than Sharif. He met with U.S. ambassador Anne W. Patterson, who <b>pushed</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> pact with Musharraf. To strengthen the new coalition, {{he reached out to}} Awami National Party, the Muttahida Qaumi Movement, and Baloch nationalist leaders, who had all boycotted the elections.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{communist}} groups existed in Sarawak, {{the first of}} which, the Sarawak Overseas Chinese Democratic Youth League, formed in 1951. Another group, the North Kalimantan Communist Party (NKCP) (also known as Clandestine Communist Organisation (CCO) by government sources) was formally set up in 1970. Weng Min Chyuan and Bong Kee Chok {{were two of the}} more notable communist leaders involved in the insurgency. As the political scene changed, it grew progressively more difficult for the communists to operate. This led to Bong opening talks with chief minister Abdul Rahman Ya'kub in 1973 and eventually signing an agreement with the government. Weng, who had moved to China in the mid-1960s but nonetheless retained control of the CCO, <b>pushed</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> continued armed insurrection against the government in spite of this agreement. The conflict continued mostly in the Rajang Delta region but eventually ended when, on 17 October 1990, the NKCP signed a peace agreement with the Sarawak government.|$|E
5|$|After the Treaties of Tilsit of July 1807 Metternich {{saw that}} Austria's {{position}} in Europe {{was much more}} vulnerable but believed the accord between Russia and France would not last. In the meantime he found the new French Foreign Minister, Jean-Baptiste Champagny unaccommodating and struggled to negotiate a satisfactory settlement {{over the future of}} several French forts on the River Inn. Over the following months the reach of Austrian policy, and Metternich's own reputation, increased. Metternich <b>pushed</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> Russo-Austrian alliance, though Tsar Alexander was too preoccupied with the three other wars he was engaged in to commit. Over time, Metternich came to see an eventual war with France as inevitable.|$|E

However, the disruption caused by the Super League war caused great change to the game in Australia. By May 1997, Super League boss John Ribot <b>pushed</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> Melbourne-based club for his competition, which was the rival of the ARL. Former Brisbane Broncos centre Chris Johns became the CEO of the club and Ribot {{stepped down from the}} head of Super League to set up the club. In September 1997, Melbourne announced that Chris Anderson would be their foundation coach, and then Super League announced that the new team would be named the Melbourne Storm.|$|E
5|$|For years {{leading up}} to the {{creation}} of the park, the leading citizens and newspapers in Albany had <b>pushed</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> grand public park. Frederick Law Olmsted's Olmsted, Vaux and Company was hired in 1869 to plan such a park. In their plan they envisioned Washington Park as the centerpiece of a string of parks and boulevards similar to those they had designed in Buffalo, Boston, and Brooklyn. Though Olmsted and his company was not involved in the actual design of the park, their broad vision was followed for the detailed designs, including the idea of damming the Beaver Kill (Beaver Creek) to form a grand lake.|$|E
5|$|In 1891, Fisher {{was elected}} {{as the first}} {{president}} of the Gympie branch of the Labour Party. In 1893, {{he was elected to the}} Legislative Assembly of Queensland as Labour member for Gympie and by the following year had become Labour's deputy leader in the Legislative Assembly. In his maiden speech, he <b>pushed</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> 50% decrease in military spending and declared support for a federation. Another policy area that captured his attention during this term, was the employment of workers from the Pacific Islands in sugar plantations, a practice that Fisher and Labour both strongly opposed. He lost his seat in 1896 following a campaign in which he was charged by his opponent Jacob Stumm with being a dangerous revolutionary and an anti-Catholic, accusations that were propagated by the newspaper Gympie Times.|$|E

5|$|In 1995, a U.S. Border Patrol {{checkpoint}} {{was opened}} near Dulzura, to combat human and drug trafficking that used SR94, {{as well as}} fatal traffic accidents resulting from such smuggling. Two years later, following a proposal to widen SR94 from Otay Lakes Road to SR188 to address {{the high rate of}} accidents, local residents raised concerns about this proposal. In July1998, the Back Country Coalition sued Caltrans concerning the short length of the environmental impact report as well as not soliciting comments from the public; opponents <b>pushed</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> ban of all trucks on the highway. Caltrans agreed to hold another hearing in an out-of-court settlement, as well as to pay $20,000 for the attorneys. In March1999, Caltrans agreed to delay the construction for several years to evaluate the environmental impact. During the early 2000s, the interchange with SR125 was reconstructed to allow for the extension of the latter freeway south to SR54, which was finished in 2003.|$|E
5|$|Operation Dragoon (initially Operation Anvil) was {{the code}} {{name for the}} Allied {{invasion}} of Southern France on 15August 1944. The operation was initially planned to be executed in conjunction with Operation Overlord, the Allied landing in the Normandy, {{but the lack of}} available resources led to a cancellation of the second landing. By July 1944 the landing was reconsidered, as the clogged-up ports in Normandy did not have the capacity to adequately supply the Allied forces. Concurrently, the French High Command <b>pushed</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> revival of the operation that would include large numbers of French troops. As a result, the operation was finally approved in July to be executed in August.|$|E
5|$|Rev. John Nepomucene Jaeger, {{the first}} Bohemian abbot in the United States, was urged to {{establish}} a monastic community to teach at parochial schools in Bohemian as well as English. He founded St. Procopius priory in 1885. The priory took control of St. Procopius parish in January 1886, and Jaeger became the pastor. Jaeger also founded a convent in 1895, consisting of nuns brought from St. Mary's Convent in Pittsburgh and headed by Jaeger's biological sister, Mother Mary Nepomucene Jaeger. The Czech-American media had <b>pushed</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> convent to prepare Czech-speaking nuns for teaching positions in Czech parochial schools, which had previously hired mostly lay teachers trained in Austrian normal schools. The nuns were transferred from Pittsburgh to St. Scholastica's Convent on Chicago's north side, but later that same year moved to an old parish building at Ashland and 19th Streets, where they would remain until 1912. A section of the convent was converted into a music school. Graduates taught in parishes throughout the nation.|$|E

5|$|Sam Raimi {{originally}} {{envisioned the}} idea for Thor after making Darkman (1990); he met Stan Lee and pitched the concept to 20th Century Fox, {{but they did not}} understand it. Thor was abandoned until April 1997, when Marvel Studios was beginning to expand rapidly. The film gained momentum after the success of X-Men (2000). The plan was for Thor to be made for television. UPN was in talks for airing it; excited by the prospect, they <b>pushed</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> script and approached Tyler Mane to play Thor. In May 2000, Marvel Studios brought Artisan Entertainment to help finance it as a film, but by June 2004 the project still had yet to be patronised by a studio. Sony Pictures Entertainment finally purchased the film rights, and in December 2004 David S. Goyer was in negotiations to write and direct. By 2005, though there were talks between Goyer and Marvel, Goyer was no longer interested, though at this point the film was still set to be distributed through Sony Pictures.|$|E
5|$|The Interior Department {{announced}} in July 1921 that Edward Doheny had been awarded a lease to drill {{along the edges}} of naval reserve Elk Hills in California. The announcement attracted little controversy, as the oil would have been lost to wells on adjacent private land. Wyoming Senator John Kendrick had heard from constituents that Teapot Dome had also been leased, but no announcement had been made. The Interior Department refused to provide documentation, so he secured the passage of a Senate resolution compelling disclosure. The department sent a copy of the lease granting drilling rights to Harry Sinclair's Mammoth Oil Company, along with a statement that there had been no competitive bidding because military preparedness was involved—Mammoth was to build oil tanks for the Navy as part of the deal. This satisfied some people, but some conservationists, such as Gifford Pinchot, Harry A. Slattery, and others, <b>pushed</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> full investigation into Fall and his activities. They got Wisconsin Senator Robert M. La Follette Sr. to begin a Senate investigation into the oil leases. La Follette persuaded Democratic Montana Senator Thomas J. Walsh to lead the investigation, and Walsh read through the truckload of material provided by the Interior Department through 1922 into 1923, including a letter from Harding stating that the transfer and leases had been with his knowledge and approval.|$|E
5|$|The {{gameplay}} {{was intended}} to stay true to the Dragon Quest formula within the design necessities and limitations of an MMORPG. During an earlier development phase, the UI featured {{a large amount of}} information showing the various player statuses, but seeking to streamline and simplify the game, they removed most of the display. A different gameplay challenge was presented by the move from turn-based to real-time battles, which went against the traditions of the Dragon Quest series. Fujisawa wanted to implement the classic battle system, but was opposed by Horii and other staff members, who successfully <b>pushed</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> real-time combat system. Elements of that battle system, such as the ability to halt enemy momentum as a battle mechanic, proved extremely challenging for the developers. Speaking about the difference between Dragon Quest X and Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn, Yoshida said that they needed to preserve the atmosphere of a normal Dragon Quest title despite MMORPGs not being designed for solo playing. It was for this reason that the loaning of player characters as NPC party members was incorporated. During later development, and following the game's release, the main focus was on balancing the various elements, items and weapons so as to create a level playing field, in addition to keeping the in-game economy balanced. Several features featured in earlier entries, such as the Casino and Coliseum, needed to be kept back for a later time.|$|E
