40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the fault states of twelve-pulse {{rectifier}} in traction substation of 3 kV DC traction system used at railways in the Czech Republic. The situation at diode breakdown of rectifier {{and at the same}} time recuperative traction vehicles in <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> <b>section.</b> The vehicle with recuperation can increase stress of elements in power supply system under certain conditions during fault states of rectifier. The simulation computer model was created for analysis of current waveforms in trolley line at this situation. The all simulations were done by program PSpice. The main goal is to analyze the endanger elements of power supply system and bring the recommendation for increasing of reliability of this mentioned power supply system. In the first part of this paper, the values of short-circuit currents flowing through 3 kV DC traction system were numerically simulated. Independently the situation, when the short-circuit DC current flowing through the secondary winding of the transformer, was analyzed. The inductances of this transformer slow down the rise of DC short-circuit current. However, in the first stage of the rise of this DC short-circuit current, the leakage inductances of the transformer which allow a rapid rise of this current, become evident. The whole interval of rise of the short-circuit current at the real transformer is further reduced by the effect of oversaturation of the magnetic circuit at connection to the DC source. It is possible to conclude by the theory of the circuits that the worst situation is in the case of vehicle with recuperation very close to the traction substation when the short-circuit current is not limited by the resistors of the traction line. The simulations show, the voltage drop on the pantograph below 2 kV occurs by this close short-circuit. The vehicle has a good opportunity to recognize this non-standard situation and stop the recuperation. Potentially the most hazard situations can be considered, when vehicle with recuperation is close enough to pass through the catenary the high current, but far enough that the voltage on the pantograph does not fall below 2 kV. If the DC source in the contact line passes through the higher current to the traction substation than the set of high-speed circuit breaker, it will be turned off this circuit breaker. The current values by the effect of the inductances in the circuit reach their steady maximum. This situation is dangerous especially for the machine isolator (circuit breaker) located between 3 kV DC bus and the damaged rectifier. The circuit breaker starts to disconnect immediately after the switch off of the primary switch of the transformer (responding to diode breakdown in the rectifier). Therefore, it is always appropriate to add the protection to the rectifier evaluating the direction of the DC current flow. This protection is already installed in some built traction substations. Usage of this protection makes sure disconnection of the damaged rectifier unit from the catenary. The only vehicles, that would recuperative even if very low value of voltage at the pantograph, could complicate this situation (i. e. the situation of recuperation close the traction substation when the current flowing back to the traction substation could be up to tens of milliseconds with very high values). The recuperation at the low catenary voltage is always suitable interrupt from viewpoint of protection of traction substation from dangerous current flow back to this traction substation.
