Flowering and fruiting takes place from October to April.|$|E

40|$|The {{increasing}} number of banana-based industries in Malaysia generates large amounts of post-harvest banana wastes. The current research has endeavored to assess three different composting methods on harvested banana <b>pseudostems</b> and mixed organic wastes as bedding materials.

Comparison for the quantities of biomass produced from control composting, vermicomposting and liming associated with the rate of decomposition of organic waste into compost were evaluated in current study. The use of vermicomposting method produced 8. 82 + 0. 41 kg of compost within 3 months. The result showed that vermicomposting method was significant different (p< 0. 05) from control and compost liming methods for the mean biomass production.

5000|$|The abacá {{plant is}} stoloniferous, {{meaning that the}} plant {{produces}} runners or shoots along the ground that then root at each segment. Cutting and transplanting rooted runners is the primary technique for creating new plants, since seed growth is substantially slower. Abacá has a [...] "false trunk" [...] or <b>pseudostem</b> about 6 - 15 in in diameter. The leaf stalks (petioles) are expanded at the base to form sheaths that are tightly wrapped together to form the <b>pseudostem.</b> There are from 12 to 25 leaves, dark green {{on the top and}} pale green on the underside, sometimes with large brown patches. They are oblong in shape with a deltoid base. They grow in succession. The petioles grow to at least 1 ft in length. When the plant is mature, the flower stalk grows up inside the <b>pseudostem.</b> The male flower has 5 petals, each about 1.5 in long. The leaf sheaths contain the valuable fiber. After harvesting, the coarse fibers range in length from 6 - 12 ft long. They are composed primarily of cellulose, lignin, and pectin.|$|E
5000|$|When {{a banana}} plant is mature, the corm stops {{producing}} new leaves {{and begins to}} form a flower spike or inflorescence. A stem develops which grows up inside the <b>pseudostem,</b> carrying the immature inflorescence until eventually it emerges at the top. Each <b>pseudostem</b> normally produces a single inflorescence, {{also known as the}} [...] "banana heart". (More are sometimes produced; an exceptional plant in the Philippines produced five.) After fruiting, the <b>pseudostem</b> dies, but offshoots will normally have developed from the base, so that the plant as a whole is perennial. In the plantation system of cultivation, only one of the offshoots will be allowed to develop in order to maintain spacing. The inflorescence contains many bracts (sometimes incorrectly referred to as petals) between rows of flowers. The female flowers (which can develop into fruit) appear in rows further up the stem (closer to the leaves) from the rows of male flowers. The ovary is inferior, meaning that the tiny petals and other flower parts appear {{at the tip of the}} ovary.|$|E
