The nozzle opening was closed by a <b>pin</b> <b>valve</b> lifted by the camshaft to initiate the fuel injection before top dead centre (TDC). This is called an air-blast injection. Driving the compressor used some power but the efficiency and net power output was more than any other combustion engine at that time.|$|E

5000|$|Short-Stroking: On {{mechanical}} Autocockers, {{the trigger}} both fires the marker (by releasing the sear) and re-cocks it (by pulling the timing rod and activating the 3-way). The {{pull of the}} trigger accomplishes first one, then the other, in a precisely timed operation, making it necessary for the player to fully pull and release the trigger each time. Only partially pulling the trigger, known colloquially as [...] "short-stroking", will alter the duration of time the pneumatics are actively operating the recocking mechanism, or may eliminate the re-cocking cycle altogether. Short-stroking can thus cause many malfunctions related {{to one or more}} steps of the recocking process not being performed. For instance, if the back block does not move fully rearward, the hammer may not be caught by the sear, and will be released into the <b>pin</b> <b>valve</b> immediately upon the back block moving forward again. If the back block is not kept rearward long enough for a paintball to drop fully into the chamber, a [...] "dry fire" [...] or a [...] "ball chop" [...] may occur, the latter being extremely frustrating as it drastically affects accuracy of future shots until the barrel, breech and bolt are cleaned. The need for a full trigger pull on mechanical Autocockers also results in a slower rate of fire.|$|E

50|$|The {{parts that}} make up the stacked tube {{blowback}} are the body, trigger sear, bolt, striker/hammer, <b>valve,</b> <b>valve</b> <b>pin,</b> cup seal, main spring, and valve spring.|$|R
5000|$|In Spool-valve-based {{electropneumatic}} markers, {{the bolt}} also {{acts as the}} valve. This {{eliminates the need for}} a stacked tube construction; spool valve markers have a more compact profile. Instead of a cycling hammer or ram that strikes a <b>pin</b> <b>valve,</b> the movement of the bolt is controlled by the routing of air into small chambers in front of or behind the bolt. An air reservoir behind the bolt contains the air that is to fire the paintball. When the marker is at rest, air is routed {{to the front of the}} bolt to prevent the air in the reservoir from escaping. In an [...] "unbalanced spool valve" [...] design, when the trigger is pulled, that air is exhausted from the marker, allowing the air in the reservoir to push the bolt forwards. In a [...] "balanced spool valve" [...] design, the air in the reservoir cannot force the bolt open; instead, the air from the front of the bolt is rerouted to a small chamber behind the bolt, separate from the reservoir, which then pushes the bolt forward. In either case, the movement of the bolt forward exposes pathways in the bolt or the marker that allow the air in the reservoir behind the bolt to surge forward and fire the paintball. Afterwards, airflow to the front of the bolt is restored, pushing the bolt back into its resting position.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "poppet valve" [...] (or simply [...] "poppet") design {{functions}} {{similarly to}} a mechanical blowback or Autococker-style marker; when the trigger is pulled, low-pressure {{air from the}} solenoid brings the bolt forward to chamber the paintball and also sends a connected, weighted ram into a <b>pin</b> <b>valve,</b> which opens to allow high-pressure air into the chamber, launching the ball. Then, either additional air from the solenoid in a [...] "two-way" [...] design, or a spring in a [...] "FASOR" [...] (Forward Air, Spring-Operated Return) design, returns the bolt and ram to the open position. Another paintball drops into the open chamber and the action is ready to fire again. Poppets are typically valued for high gas efficiency, as the low-pressure system to move the ram and the limited time the high-pressure valve is open saves gas compared to most competing designs. However, {{the nature of the}} mechanism produces very loud [...] "pops" [...] when the marker is fired, and the movement of the ram and bolt and the sudden high-pressure release of air can increase recoil, affecting accuracy during rapid fire. They are also more mechanically complex; most designs require two regulators, one to adjust the [...] "high-pressure" [...] air launching the ball, and a second one to further lower the pressure to operate the ram.|$|E
40|$|Polymer {{processing}} {{has been}} limited {{by the lack of}} direct flow and pressure control of the polymer melt at multiple points in space and time. Improved axial and radial valve designs are discussed that require negligible actuation force to control the flow of the pressurized melt. The forces resulting from pressure loads and shear stresses are first analyzed for an axial <b>valve</b> <b>pin.</b> Subsequently, a radial valve design is implemented and experimentally characterized using neat polycarbonate. A sigmoidal response surface is fit to the experimental data and found to very well model the observed pressure drop as a function of flow rate and <b>valve</b> <b>pin</b> position. The juncture loss at the valve port is then characterized by estimating and removing the pressure drops in the circular flow segments of the valve. Analysis indicated that the juncture loss is inversely proportional to the exposed area, or vesica piscis, formed between the circular flow channel in the valve body and the flow port on the moving <b>valve</b> <b>pin.</b> While applicable to many different polymer processing operations, the validated models are used to show the dynamic <b>valve</b> <b>pin</b> position {{as a function of the}} desired flow rate and desired cavity pressure in the hot runner of an injection mold. Finally, the impact of the designs on lower power, more compact mechanical and control system designs are discussed...|$|R

Oxygen and other gases were compressed and stored at high pressure in seamless containers constructed from hand-forged steel in 1880.

The filling pressure as well as capacity has increased considerably while at the same time the weight of cylinders has reduced. Today oxygen cylinder of equivalent size holds a third more oxygen but weighs about 20 kg less. The cylinders are of varying sizes and are color coded.

The top end of the cylinder is fitted with a valve with a variety of number and markings stamped on it.

40|$|Abstract: Nitriding is {{the most}} common surface {{engineering}} technique that is being used in Titanium alloys for improving their surface properties, viz hardness, wear resistance, etc. Ti 6 Al 4 V (Grade 5) Titanium Alloy is a super alloy that exhibits excellent mechanical strength; it is highly resistance to creep at very high temperatures which maintains good surface stability. It is resistant to corrosion and oxidation. The main objective of this review paper is to study the recent research works carried on Nitriding of Ti 6 Al 4 V alloy by using, viz gas Nitriding and laser Nitriding. This process is used in the surface hardening of machine parts such as aircraft engine parts, crank <b>pins,</b> <b>valve</b> seats, gears, bush, aero engine cylinders, aero crank shafts. Gas Nitriding is a diffusional technique in which the nitrogen atoms are diffused into the surface of the metal to obtain hard surface. By Laser Nitriding is a diffusional technique by which the surface properties of the titanium alloy is enhanced. Laser nitriding process comprises of various stages, viz, transport of heat, melting effect, diffusion and convection effect. By Nitriding technique the surface hardness of super alloys like Titanium Alloy Ti 6 Al 4 V Grade 5 can be increased by increasing the hardness on the surface there by its scope of application is widened.

50|$|When cocked, in {{the bottom}} tube, the main spring exerts forward {{pressure}} on the striker, {{which in turn is}} held in place by the trigger sear, the valve spring exerts backwards pressure on the <b>valve</b> <b>pin</b> which closes the valve with the cup seal, thus holding back the air/. In the top tube sits the bolt which is connected by a rod to the striker and the paintball which sits in the chamber held in place by a detent.|$|R
5000|$|Sheridan Valve: Named {{after the}} Sheridan series of markers which first {{employed}} this design, markers which employ this mechanism have the bolt which loads the paintball {{is located in}} a separate tube from the hammer and valve. To cock the mechanism, the bolt is pulled backwards thus opening the breech and loading a paintball. Doing so also pulls the hammer backwards against the main spring, which is then held back by a sear connected to the trigger. The bolt is then pushed forward, which loads the paintball into the barrel and the marker is ready to fire. Pulling the trigger releases the hammer which is propelled forward by the main spring, hitting the <b>valve</b> <b>pin</b> and opening the valve which allows compressed gas to flow from the valve chamber into the barrel chamber thus propelling the loaded paintball forward and out of the barrel. The valve spring then closes the valve with the hammer still resting on the <b>valve</b> <b>pin,</b> after which this cycle must be repeared in order to fire another paintball. Notable examples of markers which operate in this way include the Sheridan K2, the Worr Games Products Sniper and the Chipley Custom Machine S6.|$|R
50|$|Applications {{for use in}} this {{industry}} {{take full advantage of}} the many benefits electroless nickel has to offer. Deposit properties such as uniformity, corrosion resistance, lubricity and wear resistance are all reasons why the use of EN for automotive applications continues to grow. Historically, a cost sensitive market segment, auto makers have embraced the use low cost materials plated with a thin film of electroless nickel to meet strict requirements in an economical fashion. Fuel injection systems, aluminum fuel filters, brake <b>pins</b> and bleed <b>valves</b> are just a few applications that take full advantage of the deposit’s corrosion resistance. Differential pinion shafts and a variety of pins and washers are plated in large quantities due to the coatings lubricity, wear resistance and anti-galling properties (Figure 15). Brake pistons are plated in bright, medium phosphorus electroless nickel and heat treated to increase hardness and wear resistance. High deposit luster is desired and actually improves the surface finish of the piston resulting in reduced friction (Figure 16). Cast iron slip yokes are plated with EN to eliminate noise associated with galling.|$|R
50|$|When {{the trigger}} is pulled, an {{electronic}} microswitch sends {{a signal to}} the marker's electronic board telling it to begin the firing sequence. The board then actuates the solenoid which is provided with air from the LPR. When the solenoid valve is actuated, air that normally holds the hammer in the full-back position is re-routed through the ram assembly and now drives the hammer forward at a rapid rate. The hammer then <b>pins</b> open the <b>valve</b> for a period of 6-16ms(this time is called the dwell). Since the marker's bolt is linked to the hammer, it travels forward at the same time carrying a paintball forward, passed the detents, into the firing position. Air travelling upwards through the, now open, valve is routed through the bolt and the paintball is shot out the barrel through a combination of air pressure and kinetic energy imparted from the bolt movement. Once the dwell time has passed, the solenoid returns the hammer (and thus the bolt) to the full-back position by routing the LPR-sourced air back through the default passage.|$|R
40|$|In some {{refrigeration}} applications, difficulties {{arise in}} establishing stable evaporator operating conditions, especially when using a thermostatic expansion valve. The unstable superheat signal, sometimes called hunting, of an evaporator was investigated {{by developing a}} mathematical model of a thermostatic expansion valve and a two-passage concentric-tube evaporator. The model was then used to study the dynamic response of the evaporator and valve in response {{to changes in the}} system operating conditions. The evaporator model was based on a two-passage concentric-tube heat exchanger configuration. Equations for the conservation of mass, momentum, and energy were used to simulate the flow and heat transfer, where differential equations for the length of the two-phase region and mean void fraction allowed the dynamic behavior of the evaporator to be investigated. The model also has the capability {{to examine the effects of}} refrigerant and heat flux maldistribution among the passages. The thermostatic expansion valve model takes into account the pressure forces on the diaphragm as well as the pressure drop across the orifice when predicting the refrigerant mass flow rate. The geometrical parameters that were varied in this study included the orifice size, obstructing pin-tip angle, and diaphragm area. The model also includes the effects of the spring constant, bulb time constant, and offset temperature-as determined by the force applied by the obstructing <b>pin</b> when the <b>valve</b> is closed. Superheat response was investigated by imposing suction line pressure oscillations that varied over a range of frequencies. Large superheat fluctuations were found to exist in a given frequency band, where the period was found to be on the order of 50 to 100 seconds, and pressure oscillations in this range should be avoided in operation. Disturbances outside of this frequency band did not produce significant superheat responses. Factors influencing the magnitude of the superheat response depend on the frequency of the perturbations: at high frequencies the valve does not respond to superheatfluctuations (feedback), but is very sensitive to the slope of the flow rate versus superheat curve as detennined by valve geometry; on the other hand, at low frequencies the valve behavior is dominated by the superheat feedback, and the flow rate versus superheat curve is insignificant. The effect of the valve parameters was also investigated by imposing a step increase of the suction line pressure and simulating the response of?? the evaporator superheat over time. This approach allowed comparison of the steady-state and transient behavior of superheat with different valve designs. Air Conditioning and Refrigeration Center Project 7...|$|R
40|$|Minimally Invasive Surgery (MIS) {{continues}} to grow in importance and to gradually change and improve the medical practice. This technique comes with great advantages, such as lower risk, fast patient recovery and a reduced hospital stay, but requires an increased dexterity and concentration {{on the part of}} the surgeon. To solve those problems, robots were introduced that mimic the movements of the surgeons, allowing them to focus solely on the medical procedure. Currently, there is only visual feedback from the patient to the surgeon. The lack of haptic feedback is one of the most important drawbacks of minimally invasive surgery. To restore the tactile information channel, a tactile feedback systems has to be developed. Such a feedback system consists of two main parts. A tactile sensor to register the tactile information inside the patient, and a tactile display to reflect the tactile information to the skin of the surgeon. The requirements for such a tactile feedback system are derived from the properties of the human sense of touch in the application of soft tissue palpation. The first part of a tactile feedback system is the tactile sensor. After studying different sensor principles, elastoresistance is chosen for its simplicity and robustness, and examined more closely. Elastoresistance is found to be often poorly understood and its physical principle misconceived. Simple experiments show that only the contact resistance plays a role in an elastoresistive tactile sensor. The design of a new tactile sensor is discussed, together with improved readout electronics. These electronics are optimised for high speed and low interference with the sensor signal. They can easily be adapted for different sensitivity and resistance ranges, and only use very low voltages, which is relevant in the context of MIS. The prototype tactile sensor is simple, flexible, cheap, thin and adjusted for the desired pressure range, but still suffers from large hysteresis and drift. The second part of a tactile feedback system is the tactile display. After going through some general design guidelines, an overview is given on existing tactile displays with a slight focus on small scale shape displays. Several prototypes are built in an attempt to meet the challenging requirements. These include the first appearances of hydraulics applied in tactile displays. The first is a closed hydraulic system, profiting from the incompressibility of water to transfer the actuation over a distance. The second uses an open hydraulic system with a piezoelectric proportional valve to actuate the individual pins of the tactile display. A final prototype uses pneumatics and needs a pneumatic proportional valve to control the force of the <b>pins.</b> Existing commercial <b>valves</b> are too large to fit into an already crowded operating room, and make too much noise. Therefore a small and noiseless proportional valve is designed and built, which allows for easy integration into a compact array to operate the necessary large amount of pins. The pressure range which this valve can produce,however, is too small for a tactile display, and the design needs considerably more research before it can be employed. To realise an integrated, functional tactile feedback system a tactile display `lite' is built with commercial pneumatic valves. The aim of the system is to serve as a proof of concept rather than to fulfil all the requirements. It does stand out among other tactile displays found in literature. While there are displays with a larger bandwidth, a higher resolution or a higher force, none of them combines those in a single display. On top of that, the display is very compact and has an almost negligible weight. An experiment to evaluate the combined system shows that it allows to perform a relatively complex discrimination task, even though it is too difficult to distinguish a hard ball in soft tissue. nrpages: 149 status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Key {{technology}} applications like {{magnetoresistive sensors}} or the Magnetic Random Access Memory (MRAM) require reproducible magnetic switching mechanisms. i. e. predefined remanent states. At {{the same time}} advanced magnetic recording schemes push the magnetic switching time into the gyromagnetic regime. According to the Landau-Lifschitz-Gilbert formalism, relevant questions herein are associated with magnetic excitations (eigenmodes) and damping processes in confined magnetic thin film structures. rnObjects of study in this thesis are antiparallel <b>pinned</b> synthetic spin <b>valves</b> as they are extensively used as read heads in today’s magnetic storage devices. In such devices a ferromagnetic layer of high coercivity is stabilized via an exchange bias field by an antiferromagnet. A second hard magnetic layer, separated by a non-magnetic spacer of defined thickness, aligns antiparallel to the first. The orientation of the magnetization vector in the third ferromagnetic NiFe layer of low coercivity - the freelayer - is then sensed by the Giant MagnetoResistance (GMR) effect. This thesis reports results of element specific Time Resolved Photo-Emission Electron Microscopy (TR-PEEM) to image the magnetization dynamics of the free layer alone via X-ray Circular Dichroism (XMCD) at the Ni-L 3 X-ray absorption edge. rnThe ferromagnetic systems, i. e. micron-sized spin valve stacks of typically deltaR/R = 15 % and Permalloy single layers, were deposited onto the pulse leading centre stripe of coplanar wave guides, built in thin film wafer technology. The ferromagnetic platelets have been applied with varying geometry (rectangles, ellipses and squares), lateral dimension (in the range of several micrometers) and orientation to the magnetic field pulse to study the magnetization behaviour in dependence of these magnitudes. The observation of magnetic switching processes in the gigahertz range became only possible due to the joined effort of producing ultra-short X-ray pulses at the synchrotron source BESSY II (operated in the so-called low-alpha mode) and optimizing the wave guide design of the samples for high frequency electromagnetic excitation (FWHM typically several 100 ps). Space and time resolution of the experiment could be reduced to d = 100 nm and deltat = 15 ps, respectively. rnIn conclusion, it could be shown that the magnetization dynamics of the free layer of a synthetic GMR spin valve stack deviates significantly from a simple phase coherent rotation. In fact, the dynamic response of the free layer is a superposition of an averaged critically damped precessional motion and localized higher order spin wave modes. In a square platelet a standing spin wave with a period of 600 ps (1. 7 GHz) was observed. At a first glance, the damping coefficient {{was found to be}} independent of the shape of the spin-valve element, thus favouring the model of homogeneous rotation and damping. Only by building the difference in the magnetic rotation between the central region and the outer rim of the platelet, the spin wave becomes visible. As they provide an additional efficient channel for energy dissipation, spin waves contribute to a higher effective damping coefficient (alpha = 0. 01). Damping and magnetic switching behaviour in spin valves thus depend on the geometry of the element. Micromagnetic simulations reproduce the observed higher-order spin wave mode. rnBesides the short-run behaviour of the magnetization of spin valves Permalloy single layers with thicknesses ranging from 3 to 40 nm have been studied. The phase velocity of a spin wave in a 3 nm thick ellipse could be determined to 8. 100 m/s. In a rectangular structure exhibiting a Landau-Lifschitz like domain pattern, the speed of the field pulse induced displacement of a 90 °-Néel wall has been determined to 15. 000 m/s. rnSchlüsseltechnologien wie magnetoresistive Sensoren oder das MRAM (Magnetic Random Access Memory) erfordern reproduzierbare magnetische Schaltvorgänge zwischen remanenten Zuständen. In modernen magnetischen Speichern erreicht die Geschwindigkeit solcher Prozesse die Zeitskala der gyromagnetischen Präzession. Die Landau-Lifschitz-Glibert-Gleichung (LLG) beschreibt magnetisch angeregte Zustände in Form von Eigenmoden und Dämpfung in lateral begrenzten dünnen Schichten. rnForschungsobjekte dieser Arbeit sind u. a. hochentwickelte anti-parallel gepinnte synthetische Spinventile, wie sie als GMR-Leseelemente (Giant MagnetoResistive) in heutigen Magnetspeicherplatten zum Einsatz kommen. Darin ist eine ferromagnetische Schicht hoher Koerzitivität mittels Austauschkopplung an einen Antiferromagneten gekoppelt. Eine zweite, durch einen nichtmagnetischen Spacer getrennte ferromagnetische Schicht, richtet sich bei entsprechender Spacerdicke antiparallel zu dieser aus. Eine dritte, wiederum antiparallel zur zweiten ausgerichtete NiFe-Schicht niedriger Koerzitivität (der Freelayer), wirkt als sensierende Schicht, in dem sich, abhängig vom äußeren Magnetfeld, der Widerstand im Schichtstapel ändert. In dieser Arbeit wird mittels elementspezifischer, zeitaufgelöster Photoemissions-Elektronen¬mikroskopie (TR-PEEM), die Magnetisierung des Freelayers isoliert vom Rest des Schichtstapels abgebildet. Genutzt wird dazu der Röntgenzirkulardichroismus (XMCD). rnDie untersuchten Spinventile (typisch deltaR/R = 15 %) und wurden mittels Dünnfilmtechnik auf den pulsführenden Leiter eines koplanaren Wellenleiters aufgebracht. Dabei wurden Geometrie (Rechtecke, Ellipsen, Ringe), Dimension (im Bereich weniger Mikrometer) und Orientierung zum Feldpuls variiert. Um magnetische Schaltvorgänge im Gigahertz-Regime überhaupt untersuchen zu können, mussten zum einen ultra-kurze Röntgenpulse am Synchrotron BESSY II erzeugt werden (low alpha-mode) und zum anderen die Wellenleitertechnik zur hochfrequenten elektro¬magnetischen Anregung (FWHM typisch 100 ps) optimiert werden. Orts- u. Zeitauflösung konnten auf d = 100 nm bzw. deltat = 15 ps reduziert werden. rnEs wird gezeigt, dass die Magnetisierungsdynamik des Freelayers in einem GMR-Spinventil nicht der erwarteten kohärenten Rotation entspricht. Vielmehr ist die dynamische Antwort des Systems auf den Feldpuls eine Überlagerung aus einer homogenen kritisch gedämpften Präzession und Spinwellenmoden höhere Ordnung. Für eine quadratische Struktur wird eine Spinwellenmode beobachtet, deren Periode 600 ps (1. 7 GHz) beträgt. Der Dämpfungskoeffizient erweist sich augenscheinlich zunächst als unabhängig von der Form des Spinventils, wodurch das Modell homogener Rotation und Dämpfung gestützt würde. Erst die Differenzbildung der magnetischen Rotation zwischen Mitte und Randbereich der Struktur macht die Spinwellenmode höhere Ordnung sichtbar, deren Beitrag zur Energiedissipation zu einer erhöhten effektiven Dämpfung (alpha = 0. 01) führt. Dämpfung und magnetische Schaltvorgänge in Spinventilen hängen somit von der Geometrie ab. Mikromagnetische Simulationen reproduzieren die beobachteten Spinwellenmoden. rnNeben dem Kurzzeitverhalten der Magnetisierung von Spinventilen wurden einlagige Permalloy-Schichten mit Dicken zwischen 3 und 40 nm untersucht. Die Phasengeschwindigkeit einer Spinwelle konnte in einer 3 nm dicken Ellipse mit 8. 100 m/s ermittelt werden. Für eine rechteckige Struktur mit Landau-Domänen beträgt die gemessene Geschwindigkeit der Verschiebung einer 90 °-Néel-Wand durch den Feldpuls, 15. 000 m/s. r...|$|R
