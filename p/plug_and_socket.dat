25|$|A {{patent for}} this {{obsolete}} American <b>plug</b> <b>and</b> <b>socket</b> was filed in 1915 under US patent 1,179,728. It predated the NEMA sockets and plugs.

25|$|To {{reduce the}} risk of users accidentally {{touching}} energized conductors and thereby experiencing electric shock, <b>plug</b> <b>and</b> <b>socket</b> systems often incorporate safety features in addition to the recessed contacts of the energized socket. These include plugs with insulated sleeves, sockets with blocking shutters, and sockets designed to accept only compatible plugs inserted in the correct orientation.|$|E
25|$|Different {{types of}} plugs {{are used for}} {{different}} IEC appliance classes. The assigned class depends {{on whether or not}} the device is earthed, and the degree of insulation it incorporates. Class I, for example, refers to earthed equipment which requires a third contact in the <b>plug</b> <b>and</b> <b>socket,</b> while Class II refers to unearthed equipment protected by double insulation.|$|E

Throughout the EU, as in other jurisdictions, the control of <b>plugs</b> <b>and</b> <b>socket</b> outlets for domestic use is subject to national regulations.

50|$|In Europe, <b>plugs</b> <b>and</b> <b>sockets</b> without {{additional}} {{control or}} surge protection circuits {{are outside the}} scope of the Low Voltage Directive 2006/95/EC and controlled by National regulations, and therefore must not be CE marked. In the UK the legal requirements for <b>plugs</b> <b>and</b> <b>sockets</b> are listed in Statutory Instrument 1994 No. 1768, The <b>Plugs</b> <b>and</b> <b>Sockets</b> etc. (Safety) Regulations 1994. This regulation lists the requirements for all domestic <b>plugs</b> <b>and</b> sockets; including <b>socket</b> outlet units (power strips), see Electrical Equipment - Requirements for Plugs & Sockets etc. - Guidance notes on the UK Plugs & Sockets etc. (Safety) Regulations 1994 (S.I. 1994/1768).|$|R
25|$|The <b>plug</b> <b>and</b> <b>socket</b> {{are rated}} 16 A 250 V a.c. and are {{intended}} for use only on systems having nominal voltages between 200 V and 250 V a.c. The plug pins are 4.5mm in diameter, line and neutral are on centres 19mm apart. The earth pin is offset 3.0mm. The line pin {{is on the left}} when looking at a receptacle with the earth pin offset down. Shutters over the line and neutral pins are mandatory.|$|E
25|$|Consolidation of {{standards}} eases {{international trade and}} travel. For example, the CEE7/7 plug has been adopted in several European countries and is compatible with both CEE7/3 and CEE7/5 sockets, while the unearthed and unpolarised CEE 7/16 Europlug is compatible with even more European and other socket types. IEC 60906-1 has been proposed as a common standard for all 230 V plugs and sockets worldwide but has been adopted only in South Africa so far, with a modified version used in Brazil. IEC 60906-2 recognizes the wide use of the NEMA 5-15 parallel blade <b>plug</b> <b>and</b> <b>socket</b> and recommends it for all 120 V applications.|$|E
25|$|There {{are four}} ratings of <b>plug</b> <b>and</b> <b>socket</b> in BS546, (2A, 5A, 15A and 30A). Each {{has the same}} general {{appearance}} but they are different physical sizes to prevent interchangeability, they use pin spacing which is also different from the two pin plugs specified in BS 372, so earthed plugs will not fit into unearthed sockets, and vice versa. Plugs fitted with BS646 fuses have been optional since the original BS546:1934 with maximum fuse ratings of 2A in the 2A plug, and 5A in the 5A, 15A and 30A plugs. In practice most BS546 plugs are unfused with fused versions being unusual and expensive.|$|E

25|$|<b>Plug</b> <b>and</b> <b>socket</b> systems {{intended}} for high current, high voltage or polyphase industrial equipment, {{as well as}} additional contacts and larger contacts, may also include features to improve the security and safety of use. For example, a high-power plug may include a locking ring or twist-lock feature to prevent accidental disconnection in use. A socket may include a mechanical interlock that prevents insertion or removal of a plug unless the local safety disconnecting switch is open. Plugs may include special measures to contain an arc generated during disconnection. Plugs used for equipment in wet locations (such as mines) may include small supervisory contacts that check {{the integrity of the}} earthing conductor.|$|E
25|$|Plugs and sockets are {{designed}} as a system to meet standards for safety and reliability. Some types of socket may accept more than one type of plug; where this is an official, approved intention of the socket design, all the approved combinations will be tested to the applicable safety standards. Occasionally, <b>plug</b> <b>and</b> <b>socket</b> combinations may allow power to flow but may not meet product standards for mating force, earthing, current capacity, life expectancy, or safety. Improvised or user-modified connectors will not meet the product safety standards. Adaptors between different standards can overcome mechanical incompatibility. Physical compatibility does not ensure that the appliance and socket match in frequency or voltage.|$|E
25|$|The {{plugs and sockets}} used in {{each country}} are set by {{national}} standards, {{some of which are}} listed in the IEC technical report TR 60083, Plugs and socket-outlets for domestic and similar general use standardized in member countries of IEC. The IEC also maintains a Web page giving arbitrary letter designations for generally compatible types of plugs. The IEC Web page does not identify the national standards corresponding to each plug letter. The letter codes are often used as a de facto naming standard when comparing different AC power plugs, especially when describing travel adaptors. Physically identical sockets may be connected to voltages incompatible with an appliance. The letter codes do not identify all the variants of a <b>plug</b> <b>and</b> <b>socket</b> family for different current ratings or for special purposes, and not all plug types have been assigned letters. Where an IEC letter code exists it is shown in this article.|$|E

500|$|Mennekes:On {{the right}} hand {{side of the car}} is the “fast” and “slow” AC {{charging}} point, accessed in a similar way to the DC charge point. This is a five pin [...] point. Three large pins are the line, neutral and earth/ground. The two small pins are a control circuit. This circuit enables the charge current to be cut off when charging is complete, cuts off power if the plug is removed from the vehicle (the <b>plug</b> <b>and</b> <b>socket</b> are both unshuttered), prevents both rapid and fast charging being done simultaneously and also prevents the vehicle from being driven while the plug is inserted. For “fast charging”, the control box (mounted at the roadside) is limited to 20 amps enabling a charge time (from depletion) of four hours. For “slow charging”, [...] a non-captive lead/cord is provided with the car. It is intended for use in the home or other domestic places. This has a local plug at one end and a Mennekes connector at the other. [...] The Mennekes plug has a retaining trigger with a hole for a padlock to prevent the plug from being removed from the car if deemed necessary. There is a “floating” [...] control box {{in the middle of this}} lead/cord that functions similarly to the fast charger but limits current to 10 amps so enabling an eight-hour charge time (from complete depletion on 230 volts) ...|$|E
2500|$|The South African {{standard}} SANS164 Plug and socket-outlet {{systems for}} household and similar purposes {{for use in}} South Africa defines a number of derivatives of BS546. [...] A household <b>plug</b> <b>and</b> <b>socket</b> is defined in SANS164-1, and is essentially a modernised version of the BS546 15A (the essential differences are that pins can be hollowed {{to reduce the amount}} of metal used, the dimensions are metricated, and it is rated 16A). [...] SANS164-3 defines a 6A <b>plug</b> <b>and</b> <b>socket</b> based on the BS546 5A. [...] The South African Wiring Code now defines the <b>plug</b> <b>and</b> <b>socket</b> system defined in SANS164-2 (IEC 60906-1) as the preferred standard, and it is expected that SANS164-1 and SANS164-3 devices will be phased out by around 2035.|$|E
2500|$|SANS 164-4 defines three {{variants}} of the 16A <b>plug</b> <b>and</b> <b>socket</b> intended for specialist (known as [...] "dedicated") applications. [...] The variants use a flattened earth pin, each {{at a different}} specified rotational position. [...] This arrangement ensures that the dedicated plugs can all plug into an ordinary ("non-dedicated") socket, but that the various dedicated <b>plug</b> <b>and</b> <b>socket</b> combinations are not interchangeable (nor can a non-dedicated plug be inserted into a dedicated socket).|$|E
