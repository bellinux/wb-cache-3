40|$|Following the {{complete}} eradication of smallpox in 1979, rinderpest looks set {{to become the}} second disease in history to be wiped {{off the face of}} the Earth. Although it does not directly attack humans, its devastating effect on livestock is responsible for high malnutrition and mortality rates in people living in several countries of the South. In Africa, the <b>Pan-African</b> <b>Programme</b> for the Control of Epizootics (PACE) is heading a network to combat and monitor the disease. To date, 12 of the 30 member countries have already been declared free of rinderpest infection. This is the top level of animal health certification offered by PACE. It comes into force 3 years after a country has declared itself to be provisionally free of rinderpest, provided that international controls, carried out under the auspices of the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), have not revealed any fresh cases in the meantime. This stage of certification is given when animals have neither been vaccinated, nor contracted the disease for a period of 3 years. After a further period of at least 1 year, a country that respects the strictest standards for rinderpest may be given the highest grade of certification available from PACE: freedom from rinderpest infection. Five countries were due to be declared rinderpest free during the course of 2005. The goal of the rinderpest programme is complete eradication before the 2010 deadline. OIE sees current progress in tackling this disease as particulalry encouraging since it marks the first time that a significant number of sub-Saharan African countries have been able to collectively satisfy international animal health standards. Eradicating the disease will not just enable these countries to feed their people. It will also put them in a position to access regional and international markets for animal products such as meat, hides and dairy products...|$|E

In Burkina Faso, the ALFAA method is used to teach French on the basis of functional literacy work, and is aimed at adults and young people beyond school age. They are taught writing, reading and the use of local languages Mooré and Dioula and then a basic French. The method is provided by the organisation Elan-développement, which provides bilingual publications and advisory services, and is supported by the Swiss adult education NGO uvre suisse d entraide ouvrière.

40|$|Land {{degradation}} and desertification represent {{a major threat}} to the population and ecosystems of (semi) -arid regions like the Sahel and the Sahara. In 2007, the African Union launched a <b>pan-African</b> <b>programme,</b> the Great Green Wall for the Sahara and the Sahel Initiative (GGWSSI) to reverse land {{degradation and}} desertification in the region, improve food security and support local people to adapt to climate change. Within the GGWSSI different kinds of projects have been implemented. In order to quickly evaluate the effectiveness of (a large number of) restoration and sustainable rangeland/agriculture projects, a methodology to remotely assess the biophysical impacts of diverse interventions is desirable. Within the Administrative Arrangement Technical and scientific Support to agriculture and Food and Nutrition Security we aim to develop a multi-scale remote sensing (RS) based approach to monitor the biophysical impact of sustainable agriculture and rangeland projects. Specifically, we propose to utilize a biophysical indicator obtained via satellite imagery and compare the difference between project sites and corresponding reference sites before and after the intervention. Besides this specific comparison between project and reference sites, the general state and development of vegetation and other parameters (like precipitation) on a larger scale are important information for project planning in general and the project impact assessment. This report focuses on this general analysis of vegetation and precipitation trends in north Senegal and provides some first basic approaches for RS-based impact assessment on biomass increase of selected GGWSSI projects. An upcoming paper will concentrate on a more advanced approach of impact assessment. Time series of satellite-derived precipitation estimates (P, the main driver of vegetation growth in the area) and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI, indicating vegetation amount and health status) data were utilised to characterize general precipitation and vegetation characteristics in the region and to compute long- (for P) and short-term linear trends (for P and NDVI). This is important to distinguish between general climatic trends in the region and vegetation trends due to project intervention. The results indicate a significant long-term increase in annual precipitation sums over the period 1981 – 2014 in the study area, while there is no significant precipitation trend in the more recent (and shorter) time period (2001 – 2014). The NDVI-based analysis of vegetation revealed some local positive and negative trends. As there is no significant precipitation trend over this time, we assume that other/additional factors than precipitation changes need to be considered as drivers for the vegetation trends. For an in-depth analysis of local vegetation changes (also with respect to land degradation) future studies should also include other sources of information (e. g. field studies, interviews of local people). The basic assessment of possible biophysical impacts of selected restoration projects was done via visual inspection of very high resolution images before and after the intervention and by computing differences of maxNDVI between project sites and reference sites. For some projects, slight positive changes after the intervention could be observed, indicating an increase of biomass. Other projects did not show any visible positive effect of the interventions. Further research is currently in progress to develop a more automatized and statistically sound method for this type of comparison. Should this advanced approach confirm the failure of some projects, further studies should be undertaken to understand the reasons for the failure to guide future interventions and project planning/monitoring.

40|$|Draft version issued {{as working}} paper. Final {{published}} version {{available online at}} [URL] article provides an account of meanings and connotations of ‘African leadership’ emerging from research with a cohort of participants on a <b>Pan-African</b> leadership development <b>programme.</b> We begin by reviewing current approaches to leadership, and how they have been applied {{to the study of}} leadership and management across cultures, before introducing the notion of the ‘African renaissance’, which calls for a re-engagement with indigenous knowledge and practices. The findings from our study indicate a tension between accounts and representations of leadership and the potential for leadership development to act as a forum in which participants can work through these issues. In developing an Afro-centric perspective on leadership, we propose that development activities that promote relational, critical and constructionist perspectives on leadership, with an emphasis on dialogue and sharing experience, could be an important means for surfacing new insights and understandings. In particular, they offer a mechanism by which participants can enhance their sense of ‘self in community’, generate shared understandings, challenge repressive power relations, and develop culturally appropriate forms of leadership behaviour. We conclude by proposing that further research is required on leadership in Africa that steps outside dominant methodological and empirical paradigms, and argue that such work holds great potential for generating insights not just relevant to leadership in Africa but to leadership studies in general...|$|R
