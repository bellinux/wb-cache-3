40|$|In this study, we {{screened}} 19 esophageal {{squamous cell}} carcinomas (ESCCs) {{for the detection}} of genetic alterations using inter-simple sequence repeat PCR, a DNA fingerprinting approach, Three simple repetitive unanchored primers representing tri- and tetranucleotide repeats [(GTG) (5), (GACA) (4), and (GATA) (4) ] were used, and evidence of gains and losses of chromosomal sequences were detected in all tumors (19 of 19 cases) for {{at least one of the}} primers. In 13 of these cases, apparently normal marginal epithelia adjacent to the tumors were also collected and examined. Eight of the 13 (62 %) patients showed matching somatic mutations in the marginal epithelia adjacent to the tumors. Five of these 8 (63 %) marginal epithelial samples were histologically normal, two were dysplastic, and one had extremely rare tumor cells. In 3 of these 13 (23 %) cases, the <b>profile</b> <b>bands</b> were also seen to quantitatively increase in intensity, progressing from normal epithelia to marginal epithelia to tumors. Ten <b>profile</b> <b>bands</b> shelving gains and one profile band showing loss in tumors compared with the corresponding normal epithelia were cloned, and their origins were determined by sequencing, The DNA sequence of one of the <b>profile</b> <b>bands</b> showing gain in the tumor could be matched to an expressed sequence tag sequence that has been mapped to the 7 q 22 region, a genomic amplification novel to ESCC, The sequence of the other profile band showing gain in the tumor could be matched to a nonexonic sequence of chromosome 20, whereas the sequences of the remaining <b>profile</b> <b>bands</b> could not be matched with any known sequences after comparison with the genomic sequence data in the European Molecular Biology Laboratory and GenBank databases. The bonafide nature of the gains or losses of 11 <b>profile</b> <b>bands</b> in the original cases was confirmed by direct genomic PCR amplification. The frequencies of these specific gene alterations in tumors were then analyzed in a total of 60 ESCCs, which included 41 additional cases of ESCC, Significantly, 26 of 60 (43 %) tumors showed the DNA amplification for the expressed sequence tag sequence of chromosome 7, whereas the frequency of other individual gene alterations ranged from 7 % to 15 %. It is concluded that the inter-simple sequence repeat PCR strategy is adequate {{for the detection of}} somatic mutations in tumors, most of which are quantitative alterations in anonymous genomic sequences. This approach is also suitable for detection of somatic mutations preceding the onset of morphologically detectable neoplasia in ESCC. Department of Applied Biology and Chemical Technolog...|$|E
40|$|The {{last two}} decades have seen a {{revolution}} in the development of molecular based methods to investigate microbial diversity and function, such as stable isotope probing (SIP) methods and fluorescence in situ hybridisation-based technology. Unprecedented advancements in our knowledge have been achieved largely thanks to the advent of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), which is the basis for many current microbial fingerprinting techniques and clone libraries. A major drawback of PCR is that accurate information of species abundance cannot be gained, because of procedural biases which substantially modify abundance information. Additionally, in SIP studies the isotopic signal is erased after DNA amplification. Consequently, the option of quantifying isotopic enrichment directly from specific taxa is lost. This work describes the development of a novel method that eliminates the need of PCR in microbial community fingerprinting. It is based on the separation of small rRNA fragments by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on the basis of sequence-dependant conformational differences. The rRNA fragments are created by a targeted cleavage of the ribosomal small subunit using Ribonuclease H. The development and optimisation of the protocol to achieve this is presented here. The method was tested with several environmental samples and showed that it had greatest utility when applied to samples harbouring low microbial diversity. This was confirmed through profiling of several artificial communities. Taxonomic identification of bacterial species represented by bands in profiles was determined, as well as their relative abundance. The method was applied to follow changes in community diversity and abundance in three different types of enrichment cultures. Experiments were also carried out to determine the isotopic content of [13]C-labelled rRNA retrieved from acrylamide gels and the detection of [14]C-labelled RNA from <b>profile</b> <b>bands.</b> It was shown that removal of contaminating [12]C from [13]C-RNA was essential for detection of isotopic signatures and that radioactive rRNA bands can be detected by phosphor imaging technology. Overall, the method termed here &# 145;Direct rRNA Fingerprinting&# 146; is a PCR-free alternative that offers detection of microbial abundance and activity using radioactive or stable isotope labelling. Further methodological developments that address its limitations will enhance its sensitivity and utility in diversity and functional studies...|$|E

40|$|Mycoplasma agalactiae é o {{principal}} microrganismo causador da agalaxia contagiosa (AC), doença caracterizada por mastite seguida de agalaxia, poliartrite e ceratoconjuntivite. Em 2001, M. agalactiae foi isolado e identificado no Brasil, determinando grandes prejuízos econômicos. Considerando a necessidade de caracterização de amostras brasileiras de M. agalactiae e da implantação de medidas eficazes de controle, esse trabalho foi realizado em três etapas. O primeiro artigo descreve o perfil bioquímico e protéico de isolados de M. agalactiae de pequenos ruminantes através do cultivo em meio Hayflick modificado, testes bioquímicos e eletroforese em gel de poliacrilamida (SDS-PAGE) e a imunogenicidade destas proteínas por Western Blot (WB). As amostras apresentaram similaridade no perfil protéico com bandas variando de 30 a 135 kDa no SDS-PAGE, além da presença de uma proteína imunodominante de 48 kDa no WB. Para dar continuidade a identificação do agente envolvido na AC no Brasil, o segundo artigo descreve a análise de dez sequências de M. agalactiae isolados de caprinos e ovinos. Um fragmento de DNA de 360 bp do gene 16 S rRNA amplificado por PCR foi sequenciado. A análise revelou alto grau de similaridade, entre as dez sequências e uma similaridade maior que 99 % com amostras de referência de M. agalactiae. No terceiro artigo, a eficiência de três vacinas inativadas, preparadas com amostra local de M. agalactiae e adsorvidas com três adjuvantes, foi avaliada em caprinos e ovinos. A resposta sorológica dos animais vacinados foi analisada através de um ELISA indireto. As três vacinas induziram produção de anticorpos, podendo ser utilizadas como uma alternativa para reduzir as perdas econômicas e prevenir a agalaxia contagiosa. Estes resultados confirmam a presença e disseminação do M. agalactiae no país e fortalece a possibilidade de controle da doença pela adoção da vacinação dos rebanhos. Mycoplasma agalactiae is {{the main}} causative organism of contagious agalactia (CA), a disease characterized by mastitis followed by agalactia, polyarthritis, and keratoconjunctivitis. In 2001, M. agalactiae was isolated and identified in Brazil, causing great economic losses. Considering the need for characterization of Brazilian strains of M. agalactiae and implementation of effective control, this work was performed in three steps. The first article describes the biochemical and protein profile of isolates of M. agalactiae in small ruminants through the culture in modified Hayflick medium, biochemical tests, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and immunogenicity of these proteins by Western blot (WB). The samples had similar protein in the <b>profile</b> <b>bands</b> ranging from 30 - 135 kDa in SDS-PAGE, in addition {{the presence of a}} protein of 48 kDa immunodominant WB was shown. To continue identifying the agent involved in the AC in Brazil, the second article describes the analysis of ten sequences of M. agalactiae isolated from goats and sheeps. A DNA fragment of 360 bp of the 16 S rRNA gene was amplified by PCR and sequenced. The analysis revealed a high degree of similarity among all the sequences. The study revealed greater than 99 % similarity with the reference samples of M. agalactiae. In the third article, efficacy of three inactivated vaccines prepared with a local of M. agalactiae sample and adsorbed with three adjuvants was evaluated in goats and sheep. The antibody response in vaccinated animals was analyzed using an indirect ELISA. The three vaccines induced antibody production, and can be an alternative to reduce economic losses and prevent contagious agalactia. These results confirms the presence and spread of M. agalactiae in the country and enhances the possibility of controlling the disease through the adoption of livestock vaccination...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Semiconductor heterostructures play a {{vital role}} in {{photonics}} and electronics. They are typically realized by growing layers of different materials, complicating fabrication and limiting the number of unique heterojunctions on a wafer. In this Letter, we present single-material nanowires which behave exactly like traditional heterostructures. These pseudoheterostructures have electronic <b>band</b> <b>profiles</b> that are customdesigned at the nanoscale by strain engineering. Since the <b>band</b> <b>profile</b> depends only on the nanowire geometry with this approach, arbitrary <b>band</b> <b>profiles</b> can be individually tailored at the nanoscale using existing nanolithography. We report the first experimental observations of spatially confined, greatly enhanced (> 200 ×), and wavelength-shifted (> 500 nm) emission from strain-induced potential wells that facilitate effective carrier collection at room temperature.
