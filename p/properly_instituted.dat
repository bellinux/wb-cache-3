The whole occasion on which the first symptom flared out is before me as I write. I had met them both at dinner: they were diners who had reached the penultimate stage--the stage which in theory is a rigid selection and in practice a wan submission. It {{was late in the}} season and stronger spirits than theirs were broken; the night was close and the air of the banquet such as to restrict conversation to the refusal of dishes and consumption to the sniffing of a flower. It struck me all the more that Mrs. Limbert was flying her flag. As vivid as a page of her husband's prose, she had one of those flickers of freshness that are the miracle of her sex and one of those expensive dresses that are the miracle of ours. She had also a neat brougham in which she had offered to rescue an old lady from the possibilities of a queer cab-horse; so that when she had rolled away with her charge I proposed a walk home with her husband, whom I had overtaken on the doorstep. Before I had gone far with him {{he told me he had}} news for me--he had accepted, of all people and of all things, an [...] "editorial position." [...] It had come to pass that very day, from one hour to another, without time for appeals or ponderations: Mr. Bousefield, the proprietor of a [...] "high-class monthly," [...] making, as they said, a sudden change, had dropped on him heavily out of the blue. It was all right--there was a salary and an idea, and both of them, as such things went, rather high. We took our way slowly through the vacant streets, and in the explanations and revelations that as we lingered under lamp-posts I drew from him I found with an apprehension that I tried to gulp down a foretaste of the bitter end. He told me more than he had ever told me yet. He couldn't balance accounts--that was the trouble: his expenses were too rising a tide. It was absolutely necessary that he should at last make money, and now he must work only for that. The need this last year had gathered the force of a crusher: it had rolled over him and laid him on his back. He had his scheme; this time he knew what he was about; on some good occasion, with leisure to talk it over, he would tell me the blessed whole. His editorship would help him, and for the rest he must help himself. If he couldn't they would have to do something fundamental--change their life altogether, give up London, move into the country, take a house at thirty pounds a year, send their children to the Board-school. I saw that he was excited, and he admitted that he was: he had waked out of a trance. He had been on the wrong tack; he had piled mistake on mistake. It was the vision of his remedy that now excited him: ineffably, grotesquely simple, it had yet come to him only within a day or two. No, he wouldn't tell me what it was; he would give me the night to guess, and if I shouldn't guess it would be because I was as big an ass as himself. However, a lone man might be an ass: he had room in his life for his ears. Ray had a burden that demanded a back: the back must therefore now be <b>properly</b> <b>instituted.</b> As to the editorship, it was simply heaven-sent, being not at all another case of The Blackport Beacon but a case of the very opposite. The proprietor, the great Mr. Bousefield, had approached him precisely because his name, which was to be on the cover, didn't represent the chatty. The whole thing was to be--oh, on fiddling little lines of course--a protest against the chatty. Bousefield wanted him to be himself; it was for himself Bousefield had picked him out. Wasn't it beautiful and brave of Bousefield? He wanted literature, he saw the great reaction coming, the way the cat was going to jump. [...] "Where will you get literature?" [...] I wofully asked; to which he replied with a laugh that what he had to get was not literature but only what Bousefield would take for it.|$|E

The way to deliver a judgement is not barred by these decisions in an identical way. Rulings of termination, of lack of jurisdiction or of conditional quashing of criminal proceedings are finally barring the way to pass a judgement in the given court. While rulings returning the case to complete preparatory proceedings are barring that way only temporarily. The author observes that the rulings of quashing and of conditional quashing of the criminal proceeding reveal traits of decisions terminating the proceedings regarding the case in hand. The decisions end the primary proceedings {{in the sense that they}} preclude any possibility of going further through the usual channels of instances.

40|$|Abstract Background Osteomyelitis is {{a serious}} disease which can be {{difficult}} to treat despite <b>properly</b> <b>instituted</b> antibiotic therapy. This appears to be related at least partly to degraded vascularisation in the osteomyelitic (OM) lesions. Studies of perfusion in OM bones are, however, few and not quantitative. Quantitative assessment of perfusion could aid in the selection of therapy. A non-invasive, quantitative way to study perfusion is dynamic [15 O]water positron emission tomography (PET). We aim to demonstrate that the method can be used for measuring perfusion in OM lesions and hypothesize that perfusion will be less elevated in OM lesions than in soft tissue (ST) infection. The study comprised 11 juvenile pigs with haematogenous osteomyelitis induced by injection of Staphylococcus aureus into the right femoral artery 10 week before scanning (in one pig, 20 weeks). The pigs were dynamically PET scanned with [15 O]water to quantify blood perfusion. OM lesions (N 2 ̆ 009 = 2 ̆ 00917) in long bones were studied, using the left limb as reference. ST lesions (N 2 ̆ 009 = 2 ̆ 0098) were studied similarly. Results Perfusion was quantitatively determined. Perfusion was elevated by a factor 1. 5 in OM lesions and by a factor 6 in ST lesions. Conclusions Blood perfusion was successfully determined in pathological subacute OM lesions; average perfusion was increased compared to that in a healthy bone, but as hypothesized, the increase was less than in ST lesions, indicating that the infected bone has less perfusion reserve than the infected soft tissue...|$|E

The <b>Institute</b> of Medicine Report {{called for a}} greater role for nurses {{within the context of}} oral health in two recent publications, Advancing Oral Health in America (2011) and Improving Access to Oral Health Care for Vulnerable and Underserved Populations (2011). Nurses provide care for many vulnerable persons, including frail and functionally dependent older adults, persons with disabilities, and persons with intellectual and developmental disabilities. These persons are the least likely to receive necessary, health-sustaining dental care (which is distinct from mouth care). The mouth, or more accurately, plaque, serves as a reservoir for bacteria and pathogens. The link between mouth care, oral health, and systemic health is well-documented; infections such as pneumonia have been linked to poor oral health. Nurses, therefore, need to reframe mouth care as oral infection control and infection control more broadly. The can provide the preventive measure that are crucial to minimizing systemic infections. Nurses in all settings can potentially provide mouth care, conduct oral health assessments, educate patients about best mouth care practices, and make dental referrals. Yet, nurses are often hesitant to do anything beyond basic oral hygiene—and even in this area, often fail to provide mouth care based on best practices. 1...|$|R

40|$|D. Ed. During {{the last}} decade of the 20 th century and in the early years of the new millennium, the {{education}} dispensation in South Africa changed tremendously. Many lecturers are not necessarily equipped to face all the challenges the changes brought about, and since it is the vision of the new Government to have a erational, seamless Higher Education system that will embrace the intellectual and professional challenges facing South Africans in the 21 st centuryf (Department of Education 2003 :iii), the researcher became involved and conducted this study in a Higher Education institution. The relevant acts in the Higher Education environment served as framework to table a training model for newly appointed lecturers. Development research was used as method, and a heuristic statement formulated and tested. The instructional design components based on an Input¨ Process¨ Output matrix was applied, and a step-by-step approach followed to design the training model and simultaneously test the implementation of the programme. An extensive literature study determined criteria to be met in the design of the training programme, and experts in the field of Higher Education continuously gave their input. Reflection on 30 lecturersf who participated by giving their perceptions regarding their ability to perform their duties before and after a year of probation, as well as the 632 studentsf perceptions of the learning facilitation skills of their lecturers, completed the cycle of analysis, design, evaluation and revision. A distinction between the results of experienced and less experienced lecturers proved to be valuable, and the information that was gained, led to recommendations to support staff developers to implement a training programme for lecturers. It became evident that quality promotion is a necessity, and in order to enhance that, staff development initiatives should be linked to the performance appraisal system. Lecturers should take ownership of their own development and recognise the value of reflection on practice. The proposed training programme for the holistic development of lecturers in a Higher Education institution is based on past experience, relevant in the current situation but also future orientated. It is practical, effective and applicable in the Higher Education sector, and the validity lies in the fact that it is goal orientated, based on state of the art knowledge, relevant and meaningful. The reality in which the lecturers are expected to perform is reflected and it considers their emotional and instinctive feelings. It is therefore tabled as a well researched and <b>properly</b> <b>instituted</b> model...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the main {{distinctions between the}} General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and regional trading arrangements (RTAs), noting that under the former, liberalization of trade {{is based on the}} most favored nation (MFN) principle, while under the latter, there is a departure from that principle leading to preferential trade liberalization. <b>Properly</b> <b>instituted</b> RTAs must confirm to Article XXIV of the GATT. But the article has not been followed by nearly all the countries that have created regional integration schemes. This has meant that while the integration schemes for the 1980 s and 1990 s have not lead to increased protection against third countries, there has not been across the board trade liberalization among the groups forming RTAs. Developing countries have sought and received formal exemption from Article XXIV through the enabling clause at the Tokyo round. Departures from the MFN principle and Article XXIV have meant that there is potential for greater trade diversion with the proliferation of RTAs. The paper finds that there is no general tendency for RTAs to become increasingly integrated entities. The European Economic Community has been an exception, where greater integration has taken place with trade within the region growing steadily. In contrast, the Association of South East Asian nations (ASEAN) has been a loose agreement. Nevertheless, trade among the group has increased rapidly on the basis of multilateral trade liberalization undertaken by the countries in the group. Latin American countries also attempted to create RTAs in the 1960 s based on their national protectionist policies which led to reduced trade within the regional as well {{as the rest of the}} world. RTAs carry with them the danger of trade diversion and that there is no inexorable logic that RTAs would lead to increased integration with lower protection. Countries venturing into RTAs must attempt to achieve GATT-plus trade liberalization, implying that RTAs are used to have greater trade liberalization than what could be achieved through GATT based trade. The lessons for Latin America to avoid unnecessary costs of these RTAs arising from trade diversion are to have low protection in the first place, to have open RTAs so that there is easy accession of new partners, to continue with the trade liberalization on a MFN basis, to avoid free trade areas (in preference for common markets) which could lead to new barriers through rules of origin and to coordinate regulatory and competition policies as well as to remove barriers arising from transport, ports and communications. ...|$|E
40|$|One key water {{resource}} challenge that faces the eastern United States today {{is how to}} regulate water withdrawals by offstream users, while preserving the fair sharing philosophy of the common-law Riparian Doctrine. Traditionally, this doctrine requires that riparians (users owning land adjacent to a stream) limit their withdrawals to what can be judged as ???reasonable use. ??? Water allocation regulations are currently being formed amid emerging water competition, due to rapidly growing water demand and increasingly frequent water shortages. The study reported in the present dissertation develops {{a new type of}} water allocation scheme called the Proportionally Fair (ProFair) Program, which stresses on the fair sharing of water among withdrawers. The ProFair program is based on the Proportional Fairness Criterion, which is originally developed for bandwidth allocation in electronic communication networks. Three different methods are developed to attain the proportionally fair allocation, namely a log-linear programming model, a quadratic programming model, and a greedy procedure called the ???Bottleneck Algorithm???. The performance of the ProFair program, both in terms of equity and economic efficiency, is compared with four alternative hypothetical regulatory programs which are rooted in three different regulatory principles: the Benefit Maximizing (MaxBen) program, based on the principle of maximizing economic benefit, the Downstream Priority (DPrio) and the Upstream Priority with Municipal and Industrial User Privilege (UMIPrio) programs, based on the principle of prioritization according to type of use and/or geographical location, and the No-Rule (NR) program, which represents the status quo in many eastern states, and which is based on the principle of minimal regulation. Mathematical models are developed for each water allocation program. Economic efficiency and equity are measured by aggregate net benefit and a measurement called the Equity Index, respectively. Following the primary allocation programs, this study further develops a trading model to simulate a water rights market under each of the alternative programs. Water allocation and water market simulations under the five allocation programs are performed for the Sangamon River system in Illinois under two economic scenarios and various reservoir capacities over a 30 -year period. The simulation results show that the ProFair program dominates all other programs in fairness, generating the highest equity index in any year under any condition. Although the ProFair program results in lower net benefit than the MaxBen and UMIPrio programs, its economic efficiency can be improved through a <b>properly</b> <b>instituted</b> water rights market with complete information and minimum transaction costs. The results also demonstrate that changing supply and demand conditions have significant impacts on benefit, fairness, and market activities of all programs. Based on those findings, the dissertation recommends that policy makers give more consideration to the proportionally fair allocation due to its consistency with the Riparian Doctrine...|$|E
