5000|$|The {{identity}} of Miller’s teams {{are rooted in}} defense. He employs a [...] "pack line defense," [...] which is a variation of man-to-man defense. Instead of the off-ball defenders pressuring their player and denying the pass, everyone except the player guarding the ball must be inside an imaginary line 16 feet from the rim. At all times a defender pressures the player with the basketball, while the other four defenders play in gap/help positions. However, if the offensive player picks up the dribble, all players go out and deny looking for the steal. The <b>pack</b> <b>line</b> defense is intended to discourage penetration, getting inside the paint, and forces opponents to win with a well executed offense and good outside shooting.|$|E

40|$|The {{original}} publication {{is available}} at [URL] discolouration (FD) is causing the South African pear industry multi-million rand losses due to blemished fruit being rejected for the export market and being sold locally. The occurrence of FD was studied over two seasons using ‘Packham’s Triumph’ and ‘Doyenne du Comice’ (Pyrus communis) fruit. The influence of fruit maturity and storage duration were investigated by harvesting over three maturities and storing fruit {{for up to three}} months. FD was induced using a modified laboratory shaker that was shown to closely mimic <b>pack</b> <b>line</b> damage. Polyphenol oxidase (PPO) activity and total phenolics (TP) content were also evaluated. ‘Doyenne du Comice’ was more prone to FD than ‘Packham’s Triumph’. Harvest maturity significantly influenced FD susceptibility, with the middle picking maturity generally giving higher FD ratings. Increasing storage duration generally increased FD ratings, although not consistently. PPO activity was not influenced by harvest maturity, but was influenced by storage duration. In ‘Packham’s Triumph’, the TP content was not affected by harvest maturity or storage duration, whereas both these factors significantly influenced TP content in ‘Doyenne du Comice’. Susceptibility to development of FD symptoms is not easily linked to either PPO activity or TP content, and seasonal differences in susceptibility make prediction of possible levels of FD very difficult...|$|E

Fruit must be treated gently during in sir handling to improve their qualityin order to get a good price in a competitive market. The correct post-hardvest handling in fruit <b>packing</b> <b>lines</b> is a prerequisite to cut down the heavy post-harvest losses. Fruit <b>packing</b> <b>lines</b> must be evaluated, studying their design, the impacts applied to the fruits, the characteristics of the materials, etc. This study establishes the possibility of carrying out modifications and tests in a <b>packing</b> <b>line</b> during a long period of time. For this purpose, an experimental fruit <b>packing</b> <b>line</b> has been designed and located in the Agricultural Engineering Department of the Polythecnic University of Madrid with the aim of improving mechanical devices and fruit handling conditions to minimize damage to fruit. The experimental line consists of several transporting belts, one rollers transporter, one sizer, one elevator, one singularizer, and three trays to receive the calibrated fruit. The line has a length of 6. 15 m and a width cf 1. 9 m. Movement of the different components is regulated by electric motors with variable velocity electronically controlled. The height of the transfer points is variable and can be easily modified. The experimental line has been calibrated using two instrumented spheres IS 100 (8. 8 cm Ø and 6. 2 cm Ø).

40|$|Meat {{retailers}} and processors express {{demand for a}} more uniform product, and technical innovations are allowing an increasingly uniform supply. Meat packers can promote uniformity through pre-slaughter sorting, or earlier through contractual procurement. Emphasizing human error and the efficacy of effort on the <b>packing</b> <b>line,</b> we develop a model whereby packers gain from expanding revenue and reducing processing costs when exogenously determined carcass uniformity increases. Line speed and occupational risk increase with uniformity. Whether optimally regulated or not, equilibrium food safety can decline with increased uniformity. Effort-saving automation also will have an adverse effect on occupational safety, and may have this effect on equilibrium food safety. Under endogenously chosen carcass uniformity, a line speed regulation may not support first-best because it distorts grower-level technology adoption incentives.

In this study, an experimental <b>packing</b> <b>line</b> was used to evaluate techniques using different surfactant baths, pressurized water sprays, and styles of rotating brushes to remove field-collected and laboratory-reared grape mealybug, Pseudococcus maritimus (Ehrhorn) (Homoptera: Pseudococcidae), the diapausing two-spotted spider mite, Tetranychus urticae Koch (Acari: Tetranychidae) and the woolly apple aphid, Eriosoma lanigerum (Hausman) (Homoptera: Aphididae). The organosilicone Silwet L- 77 was no more effective than a silicone-based food grade defoamer in aiding removal. Mechanical methods, such as the style of rotating brushes and pressurized sprays, were significantly effective in removing surface arthropods. No improvement in removal occurred when pressure was increased beyond 420 kPa.

40|$|Graduation date: 1967 This study {{originated}} with industry recognition of inadequate flexibility in currently used procedures for grading, sizing, and packaging fresh apples in North Central Washington. Field-run apples are {{introduced into the}} process, and {{nearly all of the}} product must be placed in a marketing package in the process. Portions of the output products are stored for a 12 -month marketing period. Frequently during this marketing period there are changes in the types of packaging demanded. In recognition of this problem, research has developed prototype equipment for performing a presorting and presizing function. Presorted and presized apples could be returned to bulk bin storage for later selective market preparation. This study provides cost information on the application of this new procedure that should be useful to managers of packing plants. The principal objective of the study is to determine how the application of the new procedure would affect the production-point marketing margins. An intermediate objective is to establish industry structure and trends that might relate to the application of the new procedure. Cost analysis is limited to those operating input costs that would likely be affected by the application of the new procedure. An economic-engineering method of analysis is used to measure the relative efficiency of the old and new techniques. A sample of four representative apple <b>packing</b> <b>lines</b> was analyzed for rate of output in standard operating periods (eight-hour shifts) and for average costs per unit of output in these periods. Cost per unit of output associated with integrating the presorting and presizing function into the process was estimated. Operating and cost models were developed for both the standard <b>packing</b> <b>line</b> and the new method. From analysis of standard <b>packing</b> <b>line</b> operation, it was concluded that presorting and presizing the 50 per cent of the total seasonal volume with the lowest quality would improve the rate of product output on standard <b>packing</b> <b>lines.</b> This is the basis for estimating operating and cost models of the new technique. Models are based on annual seasonal output volumes of 210, 000, 28 O, 000 and 350, 000 boxes (42 pounds of apples per box). These volumes represent a majority of the larger packing plants in North Central Washington. Average operating input costs per unit of output increase due to the application of presorting and presizing. The increase was approximately. 025 per unit of output. This is one per cent of the average production-point marketing margin. Application of the new method would not increase the economic efficiency of this specific phase of grading, sizing, and packing fresh apples. The application of presorting and presizing and integration with the current <b>packing</b> <b>line</b> procedures in apple packing plants in North Central Washington could result in total cost savings in individual plants through the more efficient use of storage facilities. Approximately 20 per cent more product can be stored in refrigerated storage or modified atmosphere refrigerated storage in bulk form in bins as compared to finished product storage. Presorting and presizing 50 per cent of the field-nm product would also result in greatly improved flexibility in adapting to the market. The relatively small additional cost of application of this presorting and presizing function would improve the efficiency of many larger apple packing plants. The economic value would vary with each plant. Individual plant variables that should be analyzed are total seasonal volume and trends, storage capacity, current <b>packing</b> <b>line</b> efficiency, and marketing program...|$|R
