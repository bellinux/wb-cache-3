40|$|The compartmental models used {{to study}} {{epidemic}} spreading often assume the same susceptibility for all individuals, and are therefore, agnostic about the effects that differences in susceptibility can have on epidemic spreading. Here we show that [...] for the SIS model [...] differential susceptibility can make networks more vulnerable {{to the spread of}} diseases when the correlation between a node's degree and susceptibility are positive, and less vulnerable when this correlation is negative. Moreover, we show that networks become more likely to contain a <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> <b>infection</b> when individuals are more likely to connect with others that have similar susceptibility (the network is segregated). These results show that the failure to include differential susceptibility to epidemic models can lead to a systematic over/under estimation of fundamental epidemic parameters when the structure of the networks is not independent from the susceptibility of the nodes or when there are correlations between the susceptibility of connected individuals.

Introduced into Africa just over a century ago, the disease swept rapidly from Somalia to South Africa killing up to 80 % of cattle and wildlife species such as buffalo, kudu and eland. The economic consequences ruined many farmers and caused extreme hardship to many more. In the 1980 s another disease outbreak extended from east to west Africa with livestock losses amounting to some US$ 2 billion. In the past decade rinderpest has been eliminated from west Africa by a highly successful vaccination programme under the Pan African Rinderpest Campaign (PARC), which has been funded largely by the EU and given technical support by FAO. There have been no reports of the disease from west Africa for eight years and southern African countries have been clear of rinderpest for more than 50 years. In Ethiopia and Sudan the last <b>pockets</b> <b>of</b> <b>infection</b> are restricted to areas that have been (Ethiopia) or still are (Sudan) affected by civil strife. A recent outbreak affecting only wildlife occurred in Kenya. Kenyan and Ethiopian authorities, assisted by PARC and FAO, are hopeful that the disease can be mastered in the very near future. In Sudan an unconventional but highly successful approach to disease control has been developed by UNICEF and NGOs (Veterinaires sans frontieres, Vetaid and Oxfam) to train local Community Animal Health Workers (CAHWs) to carry out vaccination in the absence of government veterinary staff. Rinderpest also survives in India, Pakistan and parts of west Asia but the FAO has set a target for driving rinderpest to extinction by 2010. At a meeting titled 'A world without rinderpest' organized by FAO in July a strategy for achieving this target was discussed and several experts were optimistic that rinderperst eradication in Africa was possible by 2000 and worldwide by 2005.

We also show that the clearance time is exponentially sensitive to the viral decay rate and viral infectivity but only linearly dependent on the lifetime of an infected cell.

40|$|The {{population}} dynamics of tick-borne disease agents {{and in particular}} the mechanisms which influence their persistence are examined with reference to the flavivirus that causes louping-ill in red grouse and sheep. <b>Pockets</b> <b>of</b> <b>infection</b> cause heavy mortality and the infection probably persists as a consequence of immigration of susceptible hosts. Seroprevalence is positively associated with temporal variations in vectors per host, although variation between areas is associated with the abundance of mountain hares. The presence of alternative tick hosts, particularly large mammals, provides additional hosts for increasing tick abundance. Grouse alone can not support the vectors and the pathogen but both can persist when a non-viraemic mammalian host supports the tick population and a sufficiently high number of nymphs bite grouse. These alternative hosts may also amplify virus through non-viraemic transmission by the process of co- feeding, although the relative significance of this has yet to be determined. Another possible route <b>of</b> <b>infection</b> is through the ingestion of vectors when feeding or preening. Trans-ovarial transmission is a potentially important mechanism for virus persistence but has not been recorded with louping-ill and ixodes ricinus.

The physician stated that he had examined Zinn {{for the first time in}} 1966. His past history showed that he had been treated for about six years from 1930 for pulmonary tuberculosis. The 1966 examination showed that he had a condition called bronchiectasis, due to the prior lung disease. His lung tissue was lacking in aeration, while the bronchi had dilated and become <b>pockets</b> <b>of</b> <b>infection,</b> causing him to suffer recurring attacks of haemoptysis. He also suffered pulmonary disability in that he wheezed and became short of breath on the slightest effort. His condition was chronic and would not improve unless surgical treatment was given. In the opinion of the physician, Zinn might stay as he was, suffering small but repeated haemoptysis, and yet live quite a long life; alternatively, the condition might erupt in a severe haemoptysis, which could be fatal. There might also be a deterioration by secondary infection. It would therefore be advisable, the physician suggested, for Zinn to remain under medical attention. The physician conceded that, if freed from business worries, his condition might improve.|$|R

The dominant species are Schistosoma mansoni, Schistosoma japonicum, and Schistosoma haematobium. Schistosomiasis is the third most common parasitic disease in the world after malaria and amoebiasis. It is endemic in more than 70 countries affecting about 200 million people worldwide, of whom 80 % are in sub-Saharan Africa. There are <b>pockets</b> <b>of</b> <b>infection</b> in north-eastern Brazil, near the Yangtze River in China, and some pockets in south East Asia. In the East Mediterranean regions, the Schistosoma {{have been reported in}} Iraq and Egypt as well as in Sudan.

In the Arabian peninsula, schistosomiasis has been reported in southwest part of Saudi Arabia, mainly in the Asir province and Jizan province, which lay in the southwest corner of Saudi Arabia and directly north of the border with Yemen. The efforts to control schistosomiasis have been very successful in Saudi Arabia due to the irrigation system control. However, the infection is prone in Yemen, where the schistosomiasis control is much less strict. Thus as a result, the problem still exists due to transmigration of the populations from both countries.

Trachoma is {{the main}} {{infectious}} cause of blindness in the world, and is caused by repeated Chlamydia trachomatis <b>infections</b> <b>of</b> the inner eyelid from early childhood. Materials and methods. Following three rounds of mass drug administration (MDA) with azithromycin {{and implementation of the}} World Health Organization (WHO) s SAFE strategy, 11 districts in Burkina Faso were evaluated between 2010 and 2012. Probability sampling proportional to size was used to identify villages and households {{to be included in the}} survey. Children aged 1 to 9 years were examined for signs of active trachoma and individuals older than 15 years were examined for signs of the long-term complication trichiasis. Results. In total, 11 districts were surveyed, including 12, 501 children and 11, 365 individuals older than 15 years of age. The prevalence of trachoma in children was reduced from 21 % to below 10 % in all districts, with some local <b>pockets</b> <b>of</b> <b>infection</b> exceeding 10 %. The prevalence of trichiasis in individuals older than 15 years varied from 0. 0 to 0, 6 %. Access to an improved water source and availability to latrines was limited in all surveyed districts. Conclusions. Three consecutive years of MDAs of antibiotics has successfully reduced the overall prevalence of trachoma in these 11 districts in Burkina Faso. The prevalence of active trachoma is currently below the WHO recommended threshold for MDA of 10 % in all districts; however, further interventions at a sub-district level are needed. Improved surgical treatment, access to clean water and improvements in sanitation must be prioritised in these resource-limited areas in order to ensure sustainable results in the control of trachoma. ...|$|R

40|$|Rinderpest is an acute, highly contagious, {{viral disease}} of cattle, domesticated buffalo and some species of wildlife. The {{classical}} form of rinderpest {{is one of}} the most lethal diseases of cattle, and can have a catastrophic effect on naïve herds. At one time, epidemics of rinderpest occurred regularly in Eurasia. In 1889, cattle shipped from India carried the rinderpest virus to Africa, causing an epidemic that established the virus on the continent. Initially, approximately 90 % of the cattle in sub-Saharan Africa and many sheep and goats died. Wild buffalo, giraffe and wildebeest populations were decimated. The loss of plow animals, herds and hunting resulted in mass starvation, killing a third of the human population in Ethiopia and two-thirds of the Maasai people of Tanzania. The reduction in the number of grazing animals also allowed thickets to form in grasslands. These thickets provided breeding grounds for tsetse flies, resulting in an outbreak of sleeping sickness in humans. Some consider this epidemic to have been the most catastrophic natural disaster ever to affect Africa. Although the rinderpest virus was eradicated from Europe early in the 20 th century, epidemics continued to occur in sub-Saharan Africa and many parts of Asia. In areas where it persisted, rinderpest became the main constraint to livestock production. Several eradication campaigns were conducted after World War II. One international project, started in the 1960 s, eradicated or controlled the virus in much of Africa; however, in the 1970 s, the termination of vaccination campaigns and surveillance efforts allowed the disease to emerge from two remaining <b>pockets</b> <b>of</b> <b>infection</b> and recolonize large areas. A similarly event happened in Asia in the 1980 s. In 1992, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations began the Global Rinderpest Eradication Programme, with the goal of complete eradication by the year 2010. As of 2011, rinderpest was declared eradicated. Rinderpest is the first worldwide eradication of an animal pathogen; only one other virus, human smallpox, has ever been completely eliminated from nature...|$|R

40|$|AbstractTo {{eliminate}} incursions of {{foot-and-mouth disease}} (FMD) quickly, {{a combination of}} measures, including emergency vaccination, can help block the spread <b>of</b> <b>infection.</b> For the earliest recovery of the FMD-free status for trade, without the slaughter of uninfected vaccinated animals, a serosurvey for antibodies to FMD virus non-structural proteins (NSP) must be used to substantiate absence <b>of</b> occult virus <b>infections.</b> Areas <b>of</b> doubt over requirements for post-vaccination serosurveillance and its feasibility include the required and achievable confidence, the amount of sampling necessary, and the appropriate responses to and consequences of different seropositive findings. This derives largely from uncertainty over the extent <b>of</b> localised <b>pockets</b> <b>of</b> virus <b>infection</b> that may remain within vaccinated populations and the circumstances that permit this. The question therefore remains whether tests are sufficiently sensitive and specific to detect and eliminate infected animals, without excessive culling of uninfected animals, before vaccinated animals mix with non-vaccinated livestock when movement restrictions are lifted. It is recommended to change the rationale for serosurveillance after emergency vaccination. Only when emergency vaccination is used in limited outbreaks {{is it possible to}} test and cull comprehensively, an approach compatible with a three-month minimum period to recover the FMD-free status. In other situations, where emergency vaccination is used, such as dealing with large outbreaks in animal-dense regions and where the onset of vaccination has been delayed, post-vaccination serosurveys should be targeted and focus on providing an assurance to detect higher levels <b>of</b> <b>infection,</b> in case <b>of</b> inadequate control measures. As this provides less assurance <b>of</b> absence <b>of</b> <b>infection,</b> the approach would be compatible with a six-month waiting period for free-status recovery and should be complemented by other methods to provide evidence that vaccination and control measures have been effectively implemented, as these are the best guarantee against continuing virus transmission...|$|R
40|$|Nitric Oxide (NO) {{has a role}} in wound healing, but the {{relative}} contribution and importance of the various isozymes of Nitric Oxide Synthase (NOS) is controversial. Effects of NO are concentration dependent. At low concentrations (picomolar) produced by constitutive isoforms, Endothelial NOS (ENOS) and Neuronal NOS (NNOS), NO serves as an important physiologic messenger. Elevated, potentially cytotoxic concentrations of NO (nanomolar to micromolar) produced by Inducible NOS (INOS) under inflammatory conditions is pathogenic in many inflammatory diseases. Selective inhibition of INOS is a potential anti-inflammatory therapeutic target. Early wound healing is an inflammatory process. Macrophages, {{a major source of}} INOS, are the “director cell” of wound healing. A current hypothesis is that NO from INOS is critical for wound healing, and much published research attempts to prove this theory. ENOS has also been shown to be important for wound healing. This work looked for microanatomic expression of NOS isozymes over time, tested whether selective inhibition of INOS affects wound healing in normal rats, and looked for detrimental effects on wound healing of elevated INOS in systemic inflammatory disease. Adjuvant-induced arthritis (AIA) was the model of inflammatory disease. In normal rat wounds, INOS-selective inhibitors did not delay or alter the pattern of wound healing. INOS staining was limited to <b>pockets</b> <b>of</b> <b>infection</b> and foreign body reactions, and the incidence of delayed healing due to inadequately resolved surface bacterial infection was increased. It was concluded that INOS is not critical for normal noninfected healing, and that INOS 2 ̆ 7 role is to combat infection or other contaminants. ENOS was expressed throughout the wound bed in granulation tissue capillaries and hyperproliferative epidermis. AIA did not affect time to healing but qualitative endpoints were affected. AIA healing was abnormal grossly and histologically, primarily due to altered migration of the epidermal tongue. INOS expression was markedly increased in AIA wounds, including abnormally migrating hyperproliferative epidermis and foreign bodies. Therapeutic inhibition of INOS in AIA wounds did not return healing to normal. It was concluded that INOS is elevated in inflamed AIA wounds and associated with abnormal wound healing and response to foreign bodies. ...|$|R

A few <b>pockets</b> <b>of</b> <b>infection</b> remained in Ethiopia and Sudan, and in 1994 the Global Rinderpest Eradication Programme was launched by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) with the aim of global eradication by 2010. In May 2011, the FAO and the World Organisation for Animal Health announced that [...] "rinderpest as a freely circulating viral disease has been eliminated from the world." ...|$|R
40|$|SummaryCaspase-mediated {{inflammatory}} cell death {{acts as an}} intrinsic defense mechanism against infection. Bacterial pathogens deploy countermeasures against {{inflammatory cell}} death, but the mechanisms by which they do this remain largely unclear. In a screen for Shigella flexneri effectors that regulate cell death during infection, we discovered that Shigella infection induced acute inflammatory, caspase- 4 -dependent epithelial cell death, which is counteracted by the bacterial OspC 3 effector. OspC 3 interacts with the caspase- 4 -p 19 subunit and inhibits its activation by preventing caspase- 4 -p 19 and caspase- 4 -p 10 heterodimerization by depositing the conserved OspC 3 X 1 -Y-X 2 -D-X 3 motif at the putative catalytic <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> caspase- 4. <b>Infection</b> <b>of</b> guinea pigs with a Shigella ospC 3 -deficient mutant resulted in enhanced inflammatory cell death and associated symptoms, correlating with decreased bacterial burdens. Salmonella Typhimurium and enteropathogenic Escherichia coli infection also induced caspase- 4 -dependent epithelial death. These findings highlight the importance of caspase- 4 -dependent innate immune responses and demonstrate that Shigella delivers a caspase- 4 -specific inhibitor to delay epithelial cell death and promote infection...|$|R
40|$|Tuberculosis (TB) {{continues}} {{to be one of}} the world’s most devastating and deadly diseases. Its reach is not confined to developing countries, but is manifest in <b>pockets</b> <b>of</b> high <b>infection</b> in cities like London, and among vulnerable groups such as the homeless. To date, the majority of research on TB in London has been quantitative, and little has drawn on the experiences of homeless people living with the disease. A qualitative Grounded Theory study was undertaken to provide insight into the experience of being homeless with TB in London. The Grounded Theory approach was utilised to systematically collect and analyse data from 16 in-depth interviews of homeless people with TB at three Central London TB/chest clinics. The result is the emergence of the theory of Survivalising, which reveals a basic social process experienced by homeless people with TB, with four distinct social patterns: Zoning-out, Bottoming-out, Self-realisation and Healing. Zoning-out relates to the daily quest to survive the harsh realities of social exclusion. Personal health is neglected, overshadowed by the desire for inner escape. Bottoming-out represents a personal crisis point where individuals are no longer able to view themselves, or the world, in the same way - creating a catalyst for positive change. Self-realisation sees a new conceptual order accepted, fundamental attitudes toward life and living transformed and interest in seeking health and social services increased. Healing is about fixing a fractured existence, rebuilding relationships, restoring health and building a new and better life. Adherence to TB treatment becomes a high priority. The results of this study contribute to the overall body of research knowledge on TB, and provide a theory to augment our understanding of the homeless-TB experience. Survivalising enables health professionals and policy makers to conceptualise and deliver appropriate TB care, according to the unique requirements of individuals...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Lymphatic {{filariasis}} {{has been}} described as a “spectral disease”. Analysis of the natural course <b>of</b> <b>infection</b> in nonendemic individuals as well as experimental <b>infections</b> <b>of</b> “volunteers ” suggests that the filarial parasites are not inherently aggressive infectious agents. Experimental <b>infections</b> <b>of</b> humans with infective larvae result in transient, low-level microfilaremia, if at all. Nonendemic individuals with limited exposure show no evidence <b>of</b> persistent <b>infection</b> or pathology. Nonendemic individuals exposed to repeated infections show accelerated pathology. It is tempting to speculate that normal, immunocompetent residents in an endemic area show either (a) no pathology (endemic normals) because they are subject to the relatively low levels <b>of</b> <b>infection</b> or (b) chronic pathology if they are repeatedly infected. It would appear that only those individuals rendered immunologically tolerant to filarial parasites become productively infected with the filarial parasites. The intensity of transmission may underlie the differences in clinical presentation seen in diverse global <b>pockets</b> <b>of</b> endemicity...|$|R
40|$|In {{patients}} undergoing cardiac device implantation, anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapy {{are associated}} with an increased risk <b>of</b> <b>pocket</b> hematoma. In case of vitamin K antagonist therapy, a strategy of continued warfarin with no heparin bridge showed a reduction <b>of</b> <b>pocket</b> hematoma. Evidence regarding antiplatelet therapy management is limited. This is a single-center observational study which reflects our systematic approach to the problem. In 2012, we proposed an improved management protocol for anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapy (no-bridge protocol) based on individual thromboembolic risk stratification, noninterruption of oral anticoagulation, no bridge with heparin and elastic adherence compression bandage. The primary end point was the incidence <b>of</b> clinically significant <b>pocket</b> hematoma in the first 30  days after implantation. A total of 1, 035 patients were enrolled, of whom 522 received the standard management and 513 the new protocol. The primary end point occurred in 34 patients of the standard management group and 8  patients of the no-bridge protocol group (6. 5 % vs 1. 6 %, p < 0. 001). Patients in the standard management group had a higher incidence <b>of</b> <b>pocket</b> <b>infections</b> (2. 3 % vs 0. 6 %, p = 0. 02), lead dislodgements (4. 8 % vs 2. 1 %, p = 0. 02), and thromboembolic events (1. 3 % vs 0. 0 %, p < 0. 01). On a multivariate analysis, heparin and coronary artery disease were independent predictors <b>of</b> <b>pocket</b> hematoma (relative risk [RR] 3. 48, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 1. 55 to 7. 83 and RR 2. 43, 95 % CI 1. 25 to 4. 76, respectively), whereas the no-bridge protocol was associated with a reduction <b>of</b> <b>pocket</b> hematoma (RR 0. 33, 95 % CI 0. 14 to 0. 76). New anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapy management protocol was associated with a reduced incidence <b>of</b> clinically significant <b>pocket</b> hematomas, thromboembolic events, pocket infections, and lead dislodgements...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Objective To prospectively {{evaluate}} the perioperative safety, early complications and satisfaction {{of patients who}} underwent the implantation of central catheters peripherally inserted via basilic vein. Methods Thirty-five consecutive patients with active oncologic disease requiring chemotherapy were prospectively followed up after undergoing peripheral implantation of indwelling venous catheters, between November 2013 and June 2014. The procedures were performed {{in the operating room}} by the same team of three vascular surgeons. The primary endpoints assessed were early postoperative complications, occurring within 30 days after implantation. The evaluation of patient satisfaction was based on a specific questionnaire used in previous studies. Results In all cases, ultrasound-guided puncture of the basilic vein was feasible and the procedure successfully completed. Early complications included one case of basilic vein thrombophlebitis and one case <b>of</b> <b>pocket</b> <b>infection</b> that did not require device removal. Out of 35 patients interviewed, 33 (94. 3 %) would recommend the device to other patients. Conclusion Implanting brachial ports is a feasible option, with low intraoperative risk and similar rates of early postoperative complications when compared to the existing data of the conventional technique. The patients studied were satisfied with the device and would recommend the procedure to others...|$|R
