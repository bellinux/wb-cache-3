25|$|At first, {{production}} of the PR Mk XI was delayed because development of the Mk VII and VIII series was delayed. As a result, {{it was decided to}} base the Merlin 60 powered PR aircraft on the MK IX airframe. Production was further threatened because of a dispute over RAF PR doctrine: in early 1943, because the new PR Spitfire was delayed, the Air Ministry proposed that all <b>PR</b> <b>units</b> be converted to de Havilland Mosquitoes. After further analysis the Air Staff agreed that Mosquitoes could perform 90% of PR missions so the Spitfire production for only 10% of <b>PR</b> <b>units</b> was mooted. Air Vice Marshal John Slessor, head of Coastal Command pointed out that the Spitfire was smaller than the Mosquito, used half the number of Merlin engines and was faster, more manoeuvrable and quieter and, therefore production should be increased, not reduced. As a result, the Air Staff decided that PR Mk XI production should be accelerated at the cost of the fighters.|$|R

PRU was also instrumental in locating German missile testing sites on the Baltic Sea, near Peenemünde, allowing Bomber Command to attack them. In September 1943, the Admiralty asked for the PRU's help in Operation Source, to cripple German heavy units in Norway. No. 544 Squadron RAF contributed {{to the success of}} the operation.

The Pinguicula Group records deposition of non-cyclic siliciclastic and carbonate strata on low-energy slopes affected by rare high-energy deposits. The Pinguicula Group comprises three newly formalised formations: the Mount Landreville, Pass Mountain, and Rubble Creek (formerly units A, B, and C, respectively). The older <b>unit</b> <b>PR</b> 1 has a near-unimodal detrital zircon population with an age of 1499 ± 2. 7 Ma and εNd(t) values from - 8. 17 to 3. 92. Overall, detrital zircon data from the Pinguicula Group display a polymodal detrital zircon population with a maximum age of < 1322 ± 23 Ma and εNd(t) values from - 1. 55 to 1. 12. C-isotopic analyses from the Pinguicula Group record average δ 13 C values ranging from - 0. 64 to + 1. 6 ‰ Vienna Pee Dee Belemnite (VPDB).

The Pinguicula Group and <b>unit</b> <b>PR</b> 1 are no longer considered correlative based on differences in detrital zircon signatures and Sm-Nd isotopic data. Detrital zircon ages from <b>unit</b> <b>PR</b> 1 fall into the North American Magmatic Gap (NAMG; 1610 - 1490 Ma) and therefore sediment in <b>unit</b> <b>PR</b> 1 is interpreted to have been from the Mt.

These basins derived {{some or all of}} their sediment from Australia and the Mawson continent. Younger Mesoproterozoic strata, deposited after 1. 45 Ga, including the Missoula Group and Marqueñas Formation, lack NAMG-aged zircons and instead record a shift in sediment provenance to southern Laurentia as north Australia and the Mawson continent rifted from Laurentia’s western margin. The Pinguicula Group (< 1322 Ma) was probably fed from southern Laurentian Granite-Rhyolite provinces with NAMG-aged zircons recycled from older Mesoproterozoic strata...|$|R

40|$|O crescimento do setor avÃcola, tanto para atendimento ao mercado interno como para exportaÃÃo, tem movimentado o agronegÃcio brasileiro. A cadeia produtiva do frango de corte gera uma variedade e quantidade considerÃvel de resÃduos com as mais distintas caracterÃsticas. No caso dos resÃduos de incubatÃrio, tem-se um volume considerÃvel de {{material}} produzido, com grande potencial poluidor. Considerando a problemÃtica este projeto teve por objetivo o estudo da viabilidade de aproveitamento dos resÃduos de incubatÃrio por meio da co-digestÃo anaerÃbia. Para o ensaio de co-digestÃo foi utilizada uma bateria de 20 biodigestores, confeccionados com tubos de PVC, com capacidade para aproximadamente 60 L cada, simulando um biodigestor tubular horizontal. Os resÃduos foram cedidos pela Cooperativa Agroindustrial Consolata â Copacol e sÃo provenientes das unidades de CafelÃndia â PR (Abate de aves), Nova Aurora â PR (IncubatÃrio de Aves) e Formosa â PR (Unidade Produtora de LeitÃes â UPL). Cinco misturas foram avaliadas, sendo elas: Tratamento 1 : ResÃduo de incubatÃrio drenado + Ãgua do tanque de equalizaÃÃo da agroindÃstria. Tratamento 2 : ResÃduo de incubatÃrio drenado + Ãgua da primeira lagoa anaerÃbia da agroindÃstria. Tratamento 3 : ResÃduo de incubatÃrio fresco + Ãgua da primeira lagoa anaerÃbia do incubatÃrio. Tratamento 4 : ResÃduo de incubatÃrio fresco + Ãgua residuÃria da suinocultura. Tratamento 5 (Misto) : ResÃduos de incubatÃrio fresco + Ãgua da primeira lagoa anaerÃbia do incubatÃrio + Ãgua residuÃria da suinocultura. Cada mistura compÃs um tratamento, o qual foi repetido quatro vezes. Todas as misturas foram processadas em liquidificador. As diferentes misturas foram calculadas de maneira a obter um substrato com 4 % de sÃlidos totais no inÃcio do processo - fase batelada, e com 2 % de sÃlidos totais para fase contÃnua. AlÃm dos materiais avaliados, todos os tratamentos receberam uma porcentagem de 15 % de inÃculo (resÃduo de gado de corte) na fase batelada e fase de adaptaÃÃo do sistema na alimentaÃÃo contÃnua. Primeiramente foi realizado o ensaio em batelada, o que possibilitou definir o ponto de queima do biogÃs nos diferentes tratamentos, bem como a curva de produÃÃo de gÃs, definindo assim, o tempo de retenÃÃo hidrÃulica (TRH) do substrato nos biodigestores. Para a fase contÃnua os biodigestores foram descarregados no final da fase batelada onde o efluente foi peneirado. ApÃs a fraÃÃo lÃquida foi novamente disposta nos biodigestores. A partir desta fase iniciouse o abastecimento continuo onde durante um mÃs os biodigestores alÃm de sua carga diÃria tambÃm receberam uma porcentagem de inÃculo para que houvesse uma adaptaÃÃo do sistema. As anÃlises de caracterizaÃÃo foram realizadas no afluente e efluente dos biodigestores na fase batelada, nos resÃduos separadamente, no afluente e efluente da fase contÃnua como tambÃm no resÃduo retido no biodigestor apÃs fase de abastecimento contÃnuo. Foram utilizadas metodologias especÃficas para as anÃlises, tais como: ST, SV, carbono orgÃnico total, nitrogÃnio (NTK), minerais, pH, condutividade elÃtrica, DQO, bem como o potencial mÃdio de produÃÃo de biogÃs e metano, porcentagem de metano e diÃxido de carbono no mesmo. T 4 apresentou os melhores desempenhos em produÃÃo de biogÃs. Maiores porcentagens de CH 4 na fase batelada foram apresentadas pelo tratamento T 2. Para fase contÃnua as maiores porcentagens foram apresentadas pelos tratamentos T 2, T 4 e T 5. A maior reduÃÃo nos valores de DQO foi observada no tratamento contendo Ãgua residuÃria da lagoa anaerÃbia do frigorifico - T 2. A concentraÃÃo de minerais no efluente dos biodigestores, para todos os tratamentos, agregou ao biofertilizante valor agronÃmico. The {{growth of}} the poultry sector, both to supply the internal market and for export, has moved the Brazilian agribusiness. The productive chain of the broiler generates a considerable variety and quantity of waste with the most distinct characteristics. In the case of hatchery waste, has been a considerable volume of material produced, with high pollution potential. Considering the problems this project aimed to study the feasibility of use of hatchery waste by anaerobic co-digestion. To test the co-digestion was used a battery of 20 digesters made with PVC pipes, with a capacity of about 60 L each, simulating a horizontal tubular digester. The wastes were disposed of by Cooperativa Agroindustrial Consolata - Copacol and are from the units of CafelÃndia - PR (Slaughter of poultry), Nova Aurora - PR (Poultry Hatchery) and Formosa - <b>PR</b> (<b>Unit</b> Production of Piglets - UPL). Five mixtures were evaluated, as follows: Treatment 1 : Residue hatchery drained + Waste water tank agribusiness. Treatment 2 : Residue hatchery drained + water from the first anaerobic pond agribusiness. Treatment 3 : Residue hatchery fresh + water the first anaerobic pond of the hatchery. Treatment 4 : Residue hatchery fresh + swine wastewater. Treatment 5 (Mixed) : Residue hatchery fresh + water the first anaerobic pond of the hatchery + swine wastewater. Each composed a mixture treatment, which was repeated four times. All blends were processed in the blender. The different mixtures were calculated to obtain a substrate with 4 % total solids early in the process - batch phase, and 2 % total solids for solid phase. Besides the materials evaluated, all treatments received a percentage of 15 % of inoculum (cattle waste) during batch and adaptation phase of the system in continuous feeding. First test was performed in batch, {{making it possible to}} define the point of burning the biogas in the different treatments, and the curve of gas production, thus setting the hydraulic retention time (TRH) substrate in the digesters. For the continuous phase digesters were unloaded {{at the end of the}} batch phase where the effluent was screened. After, the liquid fraction was again prepared in the digesters. From this phase, began one where supplies still over a month the digesters beyond their daily load also received a percentage of inoculum for there was an adaptation of the system. Analyses were performed to characterize the influent and effluent of the digesters in the batch phase, the waste separately, in the influent and effluent of the continuous phase as well in residue retained in the digester after stage continuous water supply. Specific methodologies were used for analysis, such as: ST, SV, total organic carbon, nitrogen (TKN), minerals, pH, conductivity, COD, and the average potential of biogas production and methane content of methane and carbon dioxide carbon in it. T 4 showed the best performance in biogas production. Higher percentages of CH 4 in the batch phase were presented by the T 2. For the continuous phase, the highest percentages were presented by the T 2, T 4 and T 5. The largest reduction in COD values was observed in plants containing wastewater from the anaerobic pond the fridge - T 2.

The result showed that with deregulation of the downstream oil sector, the amount of levies on importation of petroleum would hike the price of domestic sales of petroleum. This shows that, deregulation would discourage the importation of refined fuel and as such it would encourage foreign direct investment in the oil and gas sector.

40|$|Abstract: Being nutritionally rich, short-horned {{grasshoppers}} (acridids) {{can be used}} to produce high quality feed for livestock industries. For a sustainable supply to the feed manufacturing companies a huge acridid biomass should be obtained at a regular basis. For this purpose acridid farming is going to be essential. But for a successful farming their optimum density per unit space should be obtained. Keeping this in mind the space requirement for mass rearing of two multivoltine grasshopper species i. e. Oxya fuscovittata and Spathosternum prasiniferum prasiniferum were taken under consideration. The experimental jars having 10 X 10 X 25 cm space 3 were used as unit area. Results revealed that for mass culture, the density level 15 for O. fuscovittata and 25 for S. <b>pr.</b> prasiniferum per <b>unit</b> space are most suitable without any mortality. Density level 25 for O. fuscovittata and 35 for S. pr. prasiniferum are good for mass rearing as in these cases mortality rate is very less (i. e. 12 % and 15. 43 % respectively). It was concluded that being smaller in size, more numbers of S. pr. prasiniferum could be kept per unit area compared to O. fuscovittata.

The long-range order between triacontahedra and PRs in the 2 / 1 AC is the same as those in Bergman-type 2 / 1 ACs. A TB-LMTO-ASA calculation on an ideal 1 / 1 AC model reveals a shallow pseudogap in the total densities-of-states data around the Fermi energy, as expected.

40|$|OBJECTIVE To {{analyze the}} factors {{associated}} with the use of pacifiers and/or bottle feeding in infants aged under one year. METHODS This is a cross-sectional study with 34, 366 children and using data from the database of the 2 nd Nationwide Survey of Breastfeeding Prevalence performed in the Brazilian capitals and Federal District in 2008. Cluster sampling was used. The questionnaire included questions about the use of artificial nipples in the last 24 hours. The analysis considered three outcomes: exclusive use of pacifier, exclusive use of bottle feeding, and use of artificial nipples (pacifier and bottle feeding). Prevalence ratios were obtained using Poisson regression with robust variance following a hierarchical model. RESULTS The following factors were associated with exclusive use of the pacifier: mother working outside the home, primiparity, child was not breastfed within the first hour, and child had consumed tea on the first day at home. The following factors were associated with exclusive use of bottle feeding: mother working outside the home, primiparity, low birth weight, child not breastfed within the first hour, and child had consumed milk formula and tea on the first day at home. The following factors were associated with use of artificial nipples (pacifier and bottle feeding) : mother working outside the home, primiparity, cesarean delivery, the male gender, low birth weight, born in a hospital not accredited as &# 8220;baby friendly&# 8221;, required health baby monitoring in the Primary Health Care <b>Unit</b> (<b>PR</b> = 0. 91), and child had consumed milk formula, water, or tea on the first day at home.

40|$|Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic {{antibodies}} (ANCA) against proteinase 3 (PR 3) {{are strongly}} associated with Wegener's granulomatosis (WG) and {{are thought to be}} involved in its pathogenesis. Levels of PR 3 -ANCA do not always correspond to clinical disease activity. To investigate the relationship between functional effects of PR 3 -ANCA and disease activity, we tested the effect of IgG samples from sera of 43 WG patients, taken during active disease or remission, for their capacity to interfere with the proteolytic activity of PR 3. Furthermore, longitudinal sera of seven WG patients were included. The enzymatic activity of PR 3 was determined (1) with casein or with a small synthetic substrate and (2) by complexation of PR 3 with alpha 1 -antitrypsin (alpha 1 -AT). With a fixed concentration (100 mug/ml) of IgG, PR 3 -ANCA from patients during an active phase of WG had a higher inhibitory capacity towards the proteolytic activity of PR 3 and complexation of PR 3 with alpha 1 -AT than did PR 3 -ANCA from WG patients during remission. However, the number of <b>PR</b> 3 -ANCA <b>units</b> that gave 50 % inhibition of the PR 3 enzymatic activity and its complexation with alpha 1 -AT was lower for patients during remission than for patients during an active phase of WG, indicating a stronger inhibitory capacity at a molar base. In conclusion, PR 3 -ANCA from patients during remission had a relatively higher inhibitory capacity towards the enzymatic activity of PR 3 than PR 3 -ANCA from patients during an active phase. This may indicate that during active disease the ANCA titre is increased, but the number of active ANCA molecules that recognize the enzyme-inhibiting epitopes is not increase...|$|R
40|$|Substituted ceria is a {{material}} which has attracted {{great interest in}} solid oxide fuel cell technology [45]. Due to its chemical stability, {{it may also be}} a promising candidate as a mixed conductive membrane for oxygen separation with flue gas contact. As part of this paper, dilatometry measurements and X-ray powder diffraction experiments were carried out on ceramic materials in air and in argon with two separate series involving the substitution of ceria; cerium was substituted with different amounts of Gd and Pr. The first substitution of Gd caused an increase of the unit cell with a small rise in linear thermal expansion in relation to pure ceria. CeO 2 − δ and Ce 0. 8 Gd 0. 2 O 2 − δ showed no chemical expansion in both atmospheres. The second substitution of Gd with <b>Pr</b> decreased the <b>unit</b> cell in relation to pure ceria. It is therefore understandable that Pr is preferentially introduced and shown in this work as Pr 4 + in ceria. These samples showed a remarkable chemical expansion in air and in argon. The chemical expansion displayed a clear positive correlation with increasing Pr content. The thermal expansion coefficients are comparable to the first substitution without any trend in relation to the amount of Pr. The dilatometry behaviour above 400 °C can be explained due to the release of oxygen and simultaneous reduction of Pr 4 +, forming Pr 3 + and oxygen vacancies. The results are in accordance with the two competing processes of forming vacancies (lattice contraction) and ionic radius change (lattice expansion) [16] and [27]. After cooling in air, the samples showed no residual expansion. In contrast, these samples displayed a remarkable residual expansion in argon of about 0. 87 % of the total relative expansion of 1. 85 % for Ce 0. 8 Pr 0. 2 O 2 −...|$|R

40|$|The {{relationship}} between carbon flux pathways {{in the plant}} must be explained. Fixation of carbon by the plant {{is the first step}} in dry matter yield production. Photorespiration (PR) appears to depress dry matter yield potential through its release of carbon, potentially fixed by photosynthesis, in the light. If PR rate could be reduced genetically in the plant, net carbon gain might be increased. A population of alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) was screened for low <b>PR</b> potential per <b>unit</b> of leaf area. 'Hayden' alfalfa, grown under competitive stand field conditions, was investigated for five harvests for carbon flux relationships. Field-grown shoots of the plants were analyzed in the laboratory for per unit leaf area total carbon uptake (TCU), PR, apparent photosynthesis (AP), and dark respiration (DR) rates. An exceptionally low PR plant, designated ∅ 5, was isolated. Nine randomly selected Hayden plants were crossed on to the ∅ 5 and seed collected from the latter. Forty F₁ progeny, grown under space planted field conditions, were analyzed by the same means for carbon flux. The 40 genotypes approached a normal distribution for PR, TCU, AP, and DR rates. Significant differences were found among genotypes for the pathways sufficient variability was present for selection of low PR rate plants. Clone cuttings of a high (number 40) and a low (number 12) PR F₁ selection, plus an ∅ 5 parent clone, were grown in the greenhouse for carbon flux measurements and analyzed as described previously. No significant differences were found for PR, TCU, AP, or DR between genotypes. In the F₁ population, 12 and 40 were concomitant extremes for PR and TCU rates. Correlation between PR and TCU rates in the population was positive but moderate with an r = 0. 53. Genotypic expression of PR was observed in the field plants, but only trends toward these differences were expressed in the greenhouse. Environmental factors in the greenhouse masked the genotypic expression of PR, TCU, AP, and DR. This indicates that greenhouse selection of PR levels may not be possible. The selection of low PR plants under Arizona field conditions may be a feasible operation, if significance between genotypes and ranking persistence is maintained over seasons...|$|R
40|$|The spoken {{language}} production of eight Afrikaans speaking Coloured persons with {{mild to moderate}} aphasia and eight Afrikaans speaking Coloured persons without aphasia were explored using a narrative discourse analysis procedure. The aim {{of the study was}} to investigate the discourse characteristics of the Cape Afrikaans dialect in persons with and without mild to moderate aphasia. Furthermore the study aimed to establish the cultural appropriateness as well as the clinical applicability of the newly developed Discourse Test Battery (Ulatowska et al., 1998) for the Afrikaans speaking Coloured population. In addition the adaptation features as well as the dialectal and discourse ethnic markers features were identified. The narrative Discourse Test Battery devised by Ulatowska et al., (1998) consisting of two composite pictures, a picture sequence story, a story retell and personal experience task was administered to all subjects. For the purpose of investigating the higher cognitive and linguistic processes, the formulation of main ideas, providing the lessons for the stories as well as proverb interpretation tasks were included and analysed. The narrative discourse productions were transcribed and analysed using more stringent reliability measures. Measures of reliability were obtained by calculating inter-rater and intra-rater reliability measures. The data was analysed in terms of the length of narratives, <b>pr</b> 6 positional <b>units,</b> quality analysis, analysis of evaluation analysis of dialectal features and ethnic discourse markers as well as adaptation features. The results indicated that for all of these methods of assessment the experimental group performed poorer than the control group. Statistically significant differences were noted on the measures of expressive phonology, lexical items, global structure, suspense, clarity and temporal sequence of some of the narrative tasks. One of the most important clinical as well as theoretical findings was the overlap between some of the dialectal features, general discourse features as well as adaptation features. Analysis of the task effects indicated that the picture sequence and the personal experience narratives showed the greatest differences between the groups and revealed the most information with regard to dialectal features, discourse ethnic markers and adaptation features. The spontaneous proverb and multiple choice proverb interpretation tasks revealed greater difficulties in abstracting and generalising information for the experimental group than for the control group. The assessment tool was found to be culturally appropriate for the Afrikaans speaking Coloured population of the Western Cape...|$|R
