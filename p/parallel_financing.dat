40|$|Canada?s {{restrictions}} {{on the role of}} private health insurance for publicly insured physician and hospital services are unique among countries with universal, publicly funded health care systems. Pressure is mounting in Canada, however, to loosen these restrictions and create a parallel system of private finance. Advocates argue that creation of a parallel system of private finance will ensure the sustainability of the public system (by reducing public cost pressures), improve access to the public system (e. g., by reducing wait times), and improve quality in the public system (through competition). Opponents of <b>parallel</b> private <b>finance</b> argue that it will create ?two-tiered? medicine, increase costs, compromise equity and reduce quality and access to publicly financed health care as those with the financial means (and often the strongest voice) exit to private insurance. Australia provides a particularly promising case study for Canada regarding the dynamics of parallel systems of public and private finance. This paper examines Australia's experience with <b>parallel</b> <b>finance</b> for inpatient hospital services to provide insight regarding: (a) the effectiveness of a parallel system of private finance in reducing costs and wait times in the public system; (b) risk selection between the parallel public and private insurance sectors; (c) the financial redistribution associated with the introduction and maintenance of a parallel system of finance; and (d) the dynamics of the broader political economy associated with <b>parallel</b> systems of <b>finance.</b> Australia's experience provides a number of lessons for Canada, including: (1) the potential for cost savings through introduction or expansion of a parallel private sector is very limited; (2) the introduction or expansion of a <b>parallel</b> private <b>finance</b> is unlikely to reduce wait times in the publicly financed system; (3) there is no simple way to regulate private insurers to pursue public objectives; (4) it is impossible to create an independent, isolated parallel system of private finance [...] interactions between the public and private insurance sectors are complex and unavoidable; (5) quality {{plays a key role in}} driving the dynamics between the public and privately financed sectors; and (6) it is essential to articulate clear policy objectives for health care financing and to design public and private roles consistent with these objectives. Our overall conclusion is that the Australian experience provides a cautionary tale regarding the risks, costs and benefits of a parallel private system of health care finance...|$|R

This was carried out between October 2005 and February 2006 in three parts. Firstly, in the service mapping element of the exercise, the inventory of specialist CAMHS provision built up since 2002 and led by mental health provider NHS trusts, was updated to reflect the state of service provision in November 2005. Secondly, financial mapping was completed by PCT commissioners to record their actual CAMHS budget for 2004 / 5 and their predicted budget for 2005 / 6. Thirdly, local authority commissioners were asked to complete a <b>parallel</b> <b>finance</b> mapping exercise and, for the first time, to submit data on a number of performance measures for use by the Commission for Social Care Inspection (CSCI). As in previous years, the 2005 CAMHS mapping data was used for performance measurement purposes by both the Healthcare Commission and the Department of Health. This was the third year of the performance programme of the PSA targets (2003 - 6) aimed at achieving growth in CAMHS around the country. The mapping data was used to provide evidence of increases in CAMHS, measured in terms of changes in annual investment, staffing levels or caseload. As this report demonstrates, very positive results were found and it is hoped that by increasing awareness of CAMHS provision and investment on an on-going basis through the provision of information, the mapping exercise has made a contribution to this successful growth over the last three years...|$|R

A consequence was an extremely high default debt. The López Portillo administration then decided to nationalize the banking system on September 1 of the same year, paying 3 trillion pesos (approximately 63 billion dollars at 47 pesos/dollar exchange rate) to acquire public and private credit institutions who had an accumulated debt of 25 billion dollars. The following year, in the middle of an economic crisis, president Miguel de la Madrid (December 1982 - December 1988) created the FICORCA (Fideicomiso de Cobertura de Riesgo Cambiario or [...] "Exchange risk coverage fund") financed by a loan that would also finance the fiscal deficit, the external debt and the economic activity of the country. This fund saved twenty of the largest companies of the country from bankruptcy; these companies owed 12 billion dollars through notes with the Banco de México. On November 10, 1986 the FONAPRE (Fondo de Apoyo Preventivo a las Institiciones de Banca Múltiple or [...] "Fund of preventive support to banking institutions") was founded to preserve the financial stability of banks, with the government having banks as trustees. By 1987, a <b>parallel</b> <b>finance</b> industry had been created with brokering firms, investment societies etc. To continue attracting investors, interest rates increased at the Bolsa Mexicana de Valores, and with the crash in the New York Stock Exchange, the national banking system was deeply affected and another devaluation came as a result.|$|R

It is not a secret that for many years the medical services tariff in the CHI system contained from only five items of expenditures (salary, charges on payroll, soft goods and clothing, medicines, bandages, other medical expenses, and food).

40|$|Debate {{over the}} effects of public versus private health care {{financing}} has been, and continues to be, active in both academic outlets and policy circles. Theoretical literature on <b>parallel</b> health care <b>financing</b> is often built on untested behavioural assumptions and the empirical evidence generally depends upon the institutional details of the specific health care systems under analysis. This paper {{contributes to the literature}} on <b>parallel</b> health care <b>finance</b> by developing and executing a revealed preference laboratory experiment based on the theoretical model of <b>parallel</b> health care <b>finance</b> in Cuff et al. (2008). The theoretical model involves individuals in the labour force with varying severities of illness who demand health care from a limited supply of health care resources. Health care resources are purchased by the public sector and rationed free of charge to individuals, or purchased by individuals through a private insurance market. The general theoretical model is converted into a discrete experimental representation of a large-scale economy where individuals are price takers, the probability of receiving public health care is exogenous and the willingness-to-pay (WTP) for private health insurance is elicited from subjects. The experimental design includes two within-subject factors based on the theoretical model: the public sector rationing rule (rationing based on need or severity versus rationing based on a random allocation) and the probability of being publicly treated (high versus low). The experimental design also includes two between-subjects treatments based on the frame of the experiment (neutral frame versus health frame) and on the distribution of private health insurance prices (high prices versus low prices). The results show the public system's allocation rule and the probability of receiving health care from the public system both significantly affect an individual's WTP for private health insurance in the predicted direction, although the WTP values tend to be above the actual theoretical predictions. When the public system allocates health care based on need, the average WTP is lower than under random allocation. A higher probability of receiving health care from the public system elicits a lower WTP regardless of how the public system allocates health care. It is also found that when the public system allocates health care based on need, the WTPs are significantly higher under a neutral frame than a health frame. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the sensitivity of}} the level of consumption to interest rates in a standard partial equilibrium theoretical framework with no uncertainty. Using a multi-period framework, the consumption function is derived and interest rate effects are decomposed into substitution, income and wealth effects. Drawing on <b>parallels</b> with the <b>finance</b> literature, the paper illustrates two key implications of the theory that are not typically emphasised in the economics literature. First, it shows that wealth effects mean that consumption is {{much more likely to be}} negatively related to interest rates than the simple two-period textbook model might suggest. Second, it demonstrates that long-term interest rates are more important than short-term rates - the sensitivity of consumption to interest rate changes depends crucially on how long these are expected to persist. Numerical calibrations provide an indication of {{the sensitivity of the}} results to key parameters. ...|$|R

40|$|This study discerns several {{deficiencies}} in the budget process in Angola. The government’s budget proposal is not publicly debated, no pre-budget paper is prepared, comparisons between budgeted expenditure and actual outcomes are not made, and audit reports are not prepared. Besides, budget execution is problematic because Angola has two <b>parallel</b> public <b>finance</b> systems, one conventional system under the Ministry of Finance; and a (mainly) Sonangol-operated unconventional system. 	The Angolan state institutions involved in the budget process are all rather weak, but reforms, learning and improvements have taken place, in particular in the Ministry of Finance, in the Finance Committee of the Parliament and in the supreme audit institution (Tribunal de Contas). However, other institutions are still weak or non-existent. The 1996 law on an anti-corruption commission has not been put into practice. The National Statistical Institute is a weak institution, and thus the basic national statistics, on which budget allocations should be based, are unreliable or non-existent. The provincial and local administrations have severe {{deficiencies in}} legitimacy {{as well as in}} professional capacity to analyse and shape public service delivery. 	During budget preparation in other countries, civil society organisations may debate budget reports and policies, for instance in a pre-budget conference and comment on tax proposals. CSOs can also be effective fighters against budget leakages, corruption, embezzlement and squander. However, civil society has historically been weak in Angola, and the political and societal space for civil society is limited. The Angolan authorities have not fully accepted the role of civil society’s voice, watchdog and control functions, and the legal framework is restrictive. 	The report suggests how to increase insight and transparency of the budget processes in Angola, how civil society can be more involved in the processes for example through capacity building in “economic literacy”, and how donors can take measures to ensure more transparency and public involvement in budgetary processes...|$|R
50|$|Private {{companies}} are typically selected through {{international competitive bidding}} and need to have demonstrated previous experience. Selection is either done {{through a combination of}} price and quality, or solely based on price. In the case of a management contract, the price is the management fee (fixed fee plus performance-based fee); {{in the case of a}} lease it is the lease fee per unit of water sold; in a concession it is the water tariff; and in an asset sale it is the price paid for the company. In some cases - such as in Casablanca in 1997 and in Jakarta in 1998 - private companies have been selected through direct negotiations without competitive bidding. In other cases - such as in Cartagena (Colombia) in 1995, Cochabamba (Bolivia) in 1999 and Guayaquil (Ecuador) in 2000 - only a single bid was submitted. If development aid agencies are involved in directly financing private sector participation, they systematically require competitive bidding.

40|$|The Queen of England famously {{asked her}} {{economic}} advisers why {{none of them}} had seen "it" (the global financial crisis) coming. Obviously, the answer is complex, but it must include reference to the evolution of macroeconomic theory over the postwar period—from the "Age of Keynes," through the Friedmanian era and the return of Neoclassical economics in a particularly extreme form, and, finally, on to the New Monetary Consensus, with a new version of fine-tuning. The story cannot leave out the <b>parallel</b> developments in <b>finance</b> theory-with its efficient markets hypothesis-and in approaches to regulation and supervision of financial institutions. This paper critically examines these developments and returns to the earlier Keynesian tradition to see what was left out of postwar macro. For example, the synthesis version of Keynes never incorporated true uncertainty or "unknowledge," and thus deviated substantially from Keynes's treatment of expectations in chapters 12 and 17 of the General Theory. It essentially reduced Keynes to sticky wages and prices, with nonneutral money only in the case of fooling. The stagflation of the 1970 s ended the great debate between "Keynesians" and "Monetarists" in favor of Milton Friedman's rules, and {{set the stage for the}} rise of a succession of increasingly silly theories rooted in pre-Keynesian thought. As Lord Robert Skidelsky (Keynes's biographer) argues, "Rarely in history can such powerful minds have devoted themselves to such strange ideas.

5000|$|The {{matter of}} divorce is {{discussed}} in verse 2:228 of the Qu'ran. The Qu'ran instructs women to wait at least three menstrual periods, called Iddah, before committing to a second marriage. The purpose of the Iddah {{is to ensure that}} a woman's pregnancy will be linked to the correct biological father. In the case of a Talāq, which is a divorce initiated by the man, the man is supposed to announce the words [...] "I divorce you" [...] aloud three times, each separated by a three-month waiting period. Certain practices of the Talāq divorce allows the [...] "I divorce you" [...] utterance to be completed in one sitting; however, the concept of [...] "Triple Divorce" [...] in one sitting is considered wrong in some branches of Islam such as with the Shia Muslims. During the three-month waiting period, only the man has the right to initiate a marital reunion if both sides desire to reconcile. This yields a gender equality perspective in the sense that women have power over men in regards to <b>finance</b> <b>parallel</b> to how men have power over women in regards to obedience, both of which are only valid to a reasonable extent. While a Ṭalāq can be completely easily, a divorce that is initiated by the woman, called a Khula, is harder to obtain due to a woman's requirement to repay her dowry and give up child custody. More specifically, a woman is to give up custody of her child if the child is over the age of seven. If a woman gains custody of her child who is under the age of seven, she must still forfeit custody upon the child's seventh birthday. Although the Islamic religion requires the woman to repay her dowry, she is also entitled to receive financial support from her former husband if needed. This cycle of financial matters protects the woman's property from being taken advantage of during or after marriage.|$|R
40|$|Although a {{majority}} of Canadians hold some form of private health care insurance [...] most commonly obtained as an employment benefit [...] private insurance finances only 12 % of health care expenditures in Canada and its financing role is essentially limited to complementary coverage for services not covered by public insurance programs. Private supplementary insurance for services covered by the public insurance system {{does not exist in}} Canada. This limited role for private insurance in health care reflects the core policy vision for health care financing in Canada, which emphasizes equal access to medically necessary health care, especially physician and hospital services. Compared to many other countries, Canada's private health insurance market is relatively uncomplicated, viewed in terms of either the products offered or the regulations imposed. Although Canadians regularly debate the relative split between public and private finance overall, and a small set of advocates have persistently pressed for a greater role for private insurance, private insurance has not figured prominently in Canada's health care policy debates, which since the late 1960 s have focused on the publicly funded health care system. Three Canadian health care policy challenges, however, are drawing the role of private health insurance into the centre of policy debate. The first has been the emergence {{in the last ten years}} of long wait times for some common, high-profile services such as orthopaedic surgery, eye surgery, diagnostic imaging, and cancer treatments. These wait times have fuelled advocates for <b>parallel</b> private <b>finance</b> alongside public insurance and for loosening restrictions on supplementary private insurance. Such advocates were emboldened by a landmark 2005 Supreme Court of Canada ruling (Chaoulli vs. Government of Quebec) that, in the presence of excessive wait times in the public system, Quebec's statute prohibiting private insurance for publicly insured services violated Quebec's Charter of Rights. Though the ruling has only narrow application to Quebec, the judgement has given momentum to those advocating for a fundamental change in the role of private insurance in Canadian health care. The second element drawing private insurance into the centre of policy debate is the growing importance of pharmaceuticals in the modern pantheon of medically necessary therapies. Prescription drugs are excluded from the core services covered by Canadian Medicare, so the majority of pharmaceutical costs are privately financed. Many Canadians, however, are either uninsured or underinsured for prescription drugs. This has prompted many to call for an expansion of public financing for prescription drugs (National Forum on Health 1997;Commission on the Future of Health Care in Canada 2002;Senate of Canada 2002). Some proposals call for full public coverage that would supplant the currently large role of private insurance in this sector; others, call for various types of public-private partnerships to ensure universal coverage. All of them force the question of the desired role for private insurance in this increasingly important and expensive sector of health care. Finally, policy makers and system analysts increasingly appreciate the interactions between the publicly and privately financed components of the overall health care system. Unequal access to privately insured services can lead to unequal access to and use of publicly insured services. Both Stabile (2001) and Allin and Hurley (2008), for instance, find that other things equal, those with private drug insurance use more publicly financed physician services (an effect unlikely to be driven by selection. This type of evidence prompts hard questions regarding the scope of policies necessary to achieve objectives set for the publicly financed health system. This chapter reviews the role of private health insurance in Canada. It begins with a brief overview of the Canadian health care system; considers the historical path that led to the current role for private health insurance; examines the current market for private health insurance; assesses the evidence for how private insurance contributes to or detracts from health financing goals; and offers some concluding comments on private health insurance in Canada. ...|$|R
