50|$|Monardes’ {{first four}} {{publications}} were written between 1536 and 1545. His first published work, a treatise on pharmacodilosis, {{was written in}} 1536. This publication’s focal point was on defending the classical medical tradition against the Arab medical tradition. His second publication was written in 1539 {{in regards to the}} relationship between blood-letting and cases of pleuritis. A third publication on the medical application of roses and an edition of a medical treatise written by Juan de Aviñón in the fourteenth century, were both written in 1545. After these four, Monardes did not publish another work for twenty years. This twenty-year period was when Monardes’ focus shifted to the medicinal products of the Americas. It was this shift that led to his most important work; the Historia medicinal de las cosas que se traen de nuestras Indias Occidentales que sirven al uso de la medicina, which was published in Seville in three parts. Part I, published in 1565 and dedicated to the Archbishop of Seville, was divided into four main sections: resins, purgatives, remedies for morbus gallicus (syphilis), and <b>Peruvian</b> <b>balsam</b> and elaborates on the medical uses of these products. The success of the first publication in Historia medicinal resulted in many informants who brought Monardes different plants that had the ability to cure a local illness. These informants and their testimonies served as the basis for Part II. Published in 1571 and dedicated to Philip II, Part II included the addition of nearly another dozen medicinal products including those that could be extracted from animals such as armadillos, sharks, caymans, as well as many others. Part II also includes an extensive study on tobacco and three chapters elaborating on the uses of sassafras, carlo santo, and cebadilla. Other chapters were devoted to other less significant products and testimonies of informants. Part III of Historia medicinal, published in 1574 along with parts I and II and dedicated to Pope Gregory XIII, elaborated more deeply on the usefulness of the products discussed in the first two parts as well as adding a few new ones, most notably the bezoar stones. The complete work was re-issued in 1580 in Seville and was the final edition during Monardes’ life. The success of the Historia medicinal is attributed to its timeliness, credibility, the experience of Monardes, and its coherence and skill of exposition.|$|E
40|$|It is {{important}} to differentiate worsening of a cutaneous eruption following topical therapy from lack of response to the medication. A study to determine the origin of contact dermatitis secondary to topical therapy was conducted among 87 patients {{with this kind of}} contact dermatitis. Sixteen patch tests with chemical compounds known to be allergenic were done. The following eight chemical compounds were responsible for 86. 5 % of the positive reactions observed: neomycin, ethylenediamine, mercury, benzocaine, iodochlorhydroxyquin, <b>peruvian</b> <b>balsam,</b> nitrofurazone and cinchocaine. More than half of the reactions were to neomycin, ethylenediamine and mercury. It is easier to diagnose this condition if one knows the composition of the topical medications one prescribes and the allergenic potency of their ingredients...|$|E
40|$|What is Balsam of Peru {{and where}} is it found? Balsam of Peru is a sticky {{aromatic}} liquid that comes from cutting the bark of the tree Myroxolon balsamum, a tree that is native to El Salvador. The "Peru " part of Balsam of Peru originates from {{when it was first}} named, El Salvador then being part of a <b>Peruvian</b> colony. <b>Balsam</b> of Peru smells of vanilla and cinnamon because it contains 60 - 70 % cinnamein (a combination of cinnamic acid, cinnamyl cinnamate, benzyl benzoate, benzoic acid and vanillin). The other 30 - 40 % contains resins of unknown composition. It also contains essential oils similar to those in citrus fruit peel. These are all potential allergens. Balsam of Peru is not only used for its aromatic and fixative (i. e. delays evaporation) properties but also for its mild antibacterial, antifungal and antiparasitic attributes. It has 3 main uses: fragrance in perfumes and toiletries; flavouring in food and drink; healing properties in medicinal products. The table below lists some of the products that may contain Balsam of Peru and/or chemically related substances...|$|R
40|$|Background. Application {{of various}} {{technological}} {{procedures for the}} manufacture of officinal preparation ointment against chilblains (Unguentum contra perniones) produce essential variations in the quality and stability of the final product. Changing the sequence of admixing active substances into the ointment base indicated the presence of incompatibility between the active substances, {{as well as between}} the active substances and the ointment base components. The aim was to examine the influence of various technological manufacturing procedures on quality and stability of the preparation. Methods. Changes in the samples of ointments and aqueous solutions of active substances were analyzed microscopically. Results. Microscopic analysis of hydrosoluble active substance solutions demonstrated destruction of ichthammol, induced by an acidic medium due to the dissolution of tannin and resorcinol, which is well known from the literature. It also demonstrated the destruction of tannin and resorcinol in aqueous solution, which had not been described in the literature. Application of the prescribed procedure for the manufacturing of ointment against chilblains, conceals the incompatibility reactions due to a slow dissolution of the tannin suspended in the officinal ointment base Unguentum cera lanae. Admixture of an ready-made aqueous solution of tannin caused an instant contact between ichthammol and the acidic medium, which caused the destruction or the complete absence of the formation of emulsion droplets. The problem of incompatibility reactions between lanolin alcohols in the ointment base and ichthammol and resorcinol, as well as the reaction between <b>Peruvian</b> <b>balsam</b> and sulfur from the ichthammol sulfate ion was observed. Numerous incompatibility reactions of ointment against chilblains, components indicated that it was necessary to introduce alterations in both the qualitative and quantitative composition of the preparation. Conclusion. Excipient preparation procedure, as well as the technological procedure for incorporation of active ingredients can cause the incompatibilities and therefore the formulation stability problems...|$|E
