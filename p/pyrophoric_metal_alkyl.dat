The {{nature of the}} potential active catalysts in these pathways is analyzed to gain improved insights into the mechanism of ethylene dimerization to butene. The catalytic cycle is identified as involving typical elementary steps in transition metal-catalyzed C-C bond formation reactions, such as oxidative insertion as well as beta-H elimination. The computed kinetic and thermodynamic features indicate that a commonly proposed metal hydride species (L(n) M-H) {{is less likely to}} act as the active species as compared to a metal-ethyl species (L(n) M-CH(2) CH(3)). Of the two key pathways considered, the active species is predicted to be a metal hydride in pathway- 1, whereas a <b>metal</b> <b>alkyl</b> complex serves as the active catalyst in pathway- 2.

40|$|Methane {{conversion}} to methyl bisulfate by Hg^(II) (SO_ 4) in sulfuric acid {{is an example}} of fast and selective alkane oxidation catalysis. Dichotomous mechanisms involving C–H activation and electron transfer have been proposed based on experiments. Radical oxidation pathways have also been proposed for some reaction conditions. Hg^(II) is also of significant interest because as a d^(10) transition metal it is similar to d^(10) main-group metals that also oxidize alkanes. Density-functional calculations are presented that use both implicit and a mixture of implicit/explicit solvent models for the complete Hg_(II) catalytic cycle of methane oxidation to methyl bisulfate. These calculations are consistent with experiment and reveal that methane is functionalized to methyl bisulfate by a C–H activation and reductive <b>metal</b> <b>alkyl</b> functionalization mechanism. This reaction pathway is lower in energy than both electron transfer and proton-coupled electron transfer pathways. After methane C–H functionalization, catalysis is completed by conversion of the proposed resting state, [Hg^I(HSO_ 4) ]_ 2, into Hg^ 0 followed by Hg^ 0 to Hg^(II) oxidation induced by SO_ 3 from dehydration of sulfuric acid. This catalytic cycle is efficient because in sulfuric acid the Hg^(II) /Hg^ 0 potential results in a moderate free energy barrier for oxidation (∼ 40 kcal/mol) and Hg^(II) is electrophilic enough to induce barriers of < 40 kcal/mol for C–H activation and reductive <b>metal</b> <b>alkyl</b> functionalization. Comparison of Hg^(II) to Tl^(III) shows that while C–H activation and reductive <b>metal</b> <b>alkyl</b> functionalization have reasonable barriers for Tl^(III), the oxidation of Tl^I to Tl^(III) has a significantly larger barrier than Hg^ 0 to Hg^(II) oxidation and therefore Tl^(III) is not catalytic in sulfuric acid. Comparison of Hg^(II) to Cd^(II) and Zn^(II) reveals that while M^ 0 to M^(II) oxidation and C–H activation are feasible for these first-row and second-row transition <b>metals,</b> reductive <b>metal</b> <b>alkyl</b> functionalization barriers are very large and catalysis is not feasible.
