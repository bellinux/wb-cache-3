40|$|Characterizing feather <b>peckers</b> seems {{a viable}} {{approach}} towards {{a better understanding}} of the problem of feather pecking. With our current state of knowledge on the causation of feather peckinq, the environmental factors that influence the development of feather pecking and the characteristics of feather <b>peckers</b> and non-feather <b>peckers,</b> it should be possible to achieve more control over the problem of feather pecking in European flock...|$|R
40|$|Abnormal behaviours, such as feather pecking, {{can become}} an even greater problem if they spread through the flock. Domestic hens are a social species {{and it has been}} {{suggested}} that feather pecking behaviour can be socially transmitted from few feather pecking individuals to many. The purpose of this experiment was to investigate whether feather pecking is transmitted from an experimental strain of high feather <b>peckers</b> to an experimental strain of low feather <b>peckers</b> when housed together. The effects of environment and age were also investigated. Four hundred and twenty chicks were housed in either cages or pens in one of three treatment groups; all high feather <b>peckers,</b> all low feather <b>peckers,</b> and a mixed group of half high feather <b>peckers</b> and half low feather <b>peckers.</b> During the rearing phase, severe and gentle feather pecks were recorded at 13 – 15 weeks and feather plumage scored at 12 and 17 weeks. At 17 weeks of age, the groups of mixed hens were removed from the study and the remaining hens resorted into the same three treatment groups. During the laying phase, severe and gentle feather pecks were recorded at 30 – 32 weeks of age and feather plumage was scored at 29 weeks of age. There was significantly less feather pecking and plumage damage in the pens than in the cages. There was no evidence of severe feather pecking spreading from feather <b>peckers</b> to non-feather <b>peckers,</b> even when actual rates of feather pecking were examined rather than only considering the strain of hen. There was some evidence that gentle feather pecking was transmitted in laying hens housed in cages. However, as gentle feather pecking does not lead to plumage damage, this is less relevant to commercial practice...|$|R

40|$|The {{development}} of feather pecking was studied {{in relation to}} laying background, social rearing condition and coping style in two strains of white leghorns (Gal/us domesiicus) that differ in their propensity to feather peck and in stress response. The strain with a high propensity to feather peck (high feather <b>peckers</b> or HP) reacts with a strong cathecholamine response to manual restraint whereas the strain with a low propensity to feather peck (low feather <b>peckers</b> or LP) reacts with a high corticosterone response. The {{development of}} feather pecking was recorded in two experimental conditions: a semicommercial and a semi-natural condition. In the semi-commercial condition chicks hatched from commercially produced eggs were raised in a large group without a mother. In the seminatural condition chicks hatched from eggs produced by small groups of free-ranging hens were raised in small broods by a (foster) mother. Both strains were represented in both treatments by four replicates. Over the course of twenty weeks pecking frequencies were scored on average {{once a week for}} thirty minutes per cage on individually marked hens and roosters. During the first four weeks there was no effect of housing condition, but high feather <b>peckers</b> showed more feather pecking then the low feather <b>peckers.</b> From week five to twenty the effect of strain persisted and an effect of condition became visible: semi-natural chicks showed less feather pecking then semi-commercial ones. This was especially apparent in the HP-strain. To separate the effect of housing condition from laying and social rearing backgrounds one male and one female of each group were reallocated to one new cage after four weeks. The strain difference in feather pecking observed in the first four weeks disappeared; there was also no difference in feather pecking between the former semi-natural and semi-commercial chicks. The housing conditions therefore did not have a persistent effect on feather pecking. The high <b>peckers</b> feather pecked less after reallocation. It seemed that the presence of low <b>peckers</b> 'diluted the feather pecking: they did not join it and that probably inhibited the high <b>peckers.</b> We also found correlations between social pecking and feather pecking. From these and other results we conclude that feather pecking has an important social component. In a standard stress test (open-field) we found a persistent effect of rearing condition on how individuals behave. Semi-naturally raised chicks behaved less inhibited than semicommercially reared chicks. Most remarkable was the difference in righting time in a tonic immobility test performed six weeks after reallocation: the semi-naturally reared chicks had a shorter righting time than the semi-commercially reared chicks. At twenty weeks after hatching the reallocation period was repeated with the female focal chicks from the home cages. No differences in feather pecking were found between the four groups then. The strong differences between the groups that had been found in coping in the open field and tonic immobility tests during the first reallocation period had disappeared in the second reallocation period. Semi-natural housing conditions seem to have a diminishing effect on feather pecking, but this effect is not persistent after changing these conditions. The feather pecking by high <b>peckers</b> decreases after reallocation, probably {{because of the presence of}} low <b>peckers.</b> Housing conditions do have a persistent effect on stress responses, which are a part of coping style, at least until nine weeks of age. Semi-natural circumstances apparently help the chicks to be less inhibited in coping with stress factors. To solve the problems caused in poultry farms by feather pecking it is probably necessary to keep the groups small and to let a (foster) mother raise the chicks. We have not found a relation between Feather pecking and coping with stress. ...|$|R

It picks its prey off leaves and twigs, sometimes hovering to do so. It normally forages {{at less than}} [...] above the ground.

40|$|Feather pecking (FP) is {{a welfare}} and {{economic}} {{problem in the}} egg production sector. Beak trimming, the current method used to reduce FP, is also criticized. The present study used gene expression to explore the biological mechanisms underlying this behavior, {{which could lead to}} a greater understanding of the cause and a tool to mitigate the problem. White Leghorn hens performing and receiving FP, as well as neutral control birds, were identified on a commercial farm. Hypothalamic RNA from 11 <b>peckers,</b> 10 victims, and 10 controls was hybridized onto GeneChip Chicken Genome Arrays (Affymetrix Inc., Santa Clara, CA) to compare gene expression profiles in the different groups. Eleven transcripts corresponding to 10 genes differed significantly between the 3 groups (adjusted P andlt; 0. 05). Eight of these transcripts differed in the <b>peckers</b> compared with the controls, 1 was upregulated in the victims compared with the controls, and 6 differed significantly in the <b>peckers</b> compared with the victims. Additionally, 5 transcripts showed a trend (adjusted P andlt; 0. 1) to differ in the pecker-victim comparison. Some of the products of the differently expressed genes are involved in disorders, such as intestinal inflammation and insulin resistance, which fit well with the previously proposed hypothesis that FP is an abnormal foraging behavior. Other findings may also support the proposal that FP is linked to immune mechanisms and may serve as an animal model for obsessive compulsive disorder in humans. In conclusion, this study provides a gene list that may be useful in further research on the mechanisms behind FP...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Aggressive {{behaviour}} is {{an important}} aspect in {{the daily lives of}} animals living in groups. Aggressive animals have advantages, such as better access to food or territories, and they produce more offspring than low ranking animals. The social hierarchy in chickens is measured using the 'pecking order' concept, which counts the number of aggressive pecks given and received. To date, {{little is known about the}} underlying genetics of the 'pecking order'. Results A total of 60 hens from a high feather pecking selection line were divided into three groups: only receivers (R), only <b>peckers</b> (P) and mixed <b>peckers</b> and receivers (P&R). In comparing the R and P groups, we observed that there were 40 differentially expressed genes [false discovery rate (FDR) P Conclusion In conclusion, our study provides new insights into which genes are involved in aggressive behaviours in chickens. Pecking and receiving hens exhibited different gene expression profiles in their brains. Following confirmation, the identification of differentially expressed genes may elucidate how the pecking order forms in laying hens at a molecular level. </p...|$|R
