40|$|Background: Job {{satisfaction}} {{is essential for}} physicians' well-being and patient care. The work ethic of long days and hard work that has been advocated for decades is acknowledged as a threat for physicians' job satisfaction, well-being, and patient safety. Our aim {{was to determine the}} actual and <b>preferred</b> job <b>size</b> of physicians and to investigate how these and the differences between them influence physicians' job satisfaction. Method: Data were retrieved from a larger, longitudinal study among physicians starting medical training at Groningen University in 1982 / 83 / 92 / 93 (N = 597). Data from 506 participants (85 %) were available for this study. We used regression analysis to investigate the influence of job size on physicians' job satisfaction (13 aspects) and ANOVA to examine differences in job satisfaction between physicians wishing to retain, reduce or increase job size. Results: The majority of the respondents (57 %) had an actual job size less than 1. 0 FTE. More than 80 % of all respondents preferred not to work full-time in the future. Respondents' average actual and <b>preferred</b> job <b>sizes</b> were. 85 FTE and. 81 FTE, respectively. On average, respondents who wished to work less (35 % of respondents) <b>preferred</b> a job <b>size</b> reduction of 0. 18 FTE and those who wished to work more (12 %) preferred an increase in job size of 0. 16 FTE. Job size influenced satisfaction with balance work-private hours most (beta = -. 351). Physicians who <b>preferred</b> larger job <b>sizes</b> were - compared to the other groups of physicians - least satisfied with professional accomplishments. Conclusions: A considerable group of physicians reported a gap between actual and <b>preferred</b> job <b>size.</b> Realizing physicians' preferences as to job size will hardly affect total workforce, but may greatly benefit individual physicians as well as their patients and society.

50|$|Maca (Peruvian Ginseng) {{seedlings}} usually emerge {{about one}} month after sowing {{with the onset of}} the rainy season in October. In the vegetative phase, until May to June, {{the lower part of the}} hypocotyl, as well as the upper part of the tap root, grows in size.

Then it will form a generative shoot on which the seeds ripen five months later. One plant is capable of forming up to 1000 tiny seeds, 1600 of which weigh about one gram.

40|$|International audienceIt is {{hypothesized}} that written languages {{differ in the}} <b>preferred</b> grain <b>size</b> of units that emerge during reading acquisition. Smaller units (graphemes, phonemes) are thought to play a dominant role in relatively consistent orthographies (e. g., German), whereas larger units (bodies, rhymes) {{are thought to be}} more important in relatively inconsistent orthographies (e. g., English). This hypothesis was tested by having native English and German speakers read identical words and nonwords in their respective languages (zoo-Zoo, sand-Sand, etc.). Although the English participants exhibited stronger body-rhyme effects, the German participants exhibited a stronger length effect for words and nonwords. Thus, identical items were processed differently in different orthographies.

In {{most of the}} applications, cluster sizes are either constrained to particular values or available as prior knowledge.

The modified k-means algorithm {{can be used to}} obtain clusters in <b>preferred</b> <b>sizes.</b> A potential application would be obtaining clusters with equal cluster size. Moreover, the modified algorithm makes use of prior knowledge of the given data set for selectively initializing the cluster centroids which helps escaping from local minima. Simulation results on multidimensional data demonstrate that the k-means algorithm with the proposed modifications can fulfill cluster size constraints and lead to more accurate and robust results.
