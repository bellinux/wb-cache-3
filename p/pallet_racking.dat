40|$|AbstractThere exist {{a number}} of {{mathematical}} problems in the literature concerning warehouse storage optimization. However, {{to the best of}} our knowledge the problem of finding optimal slot sizes in <b>pallet</b> <b>rack</b> system minimizing the occupied storage space is not studied. More precisely, the problem is to optimally choose k of m <b>pallet</b> <b>racks</b> with <b>pallets</b> in a warehouse, find optimal slot sizes in <b>pallet</b> <b>racks</b> for these <b>pallets,</b> and reassign the pallets to the new slots in order to reduce the occupied space maximally. In this paper we suggest a dynamic programming heuristic which finds optimal slot sizes for the given number k of <b>pallet</b> <b>racks</b> in a warehouse.

50|$|Structural <b>pallet</b> <b>rack</b> {{systems are}} very similar to roll formed <b>pallet</b> <b>rack</b> systems except the {{horizontal}} load beams are attached to the uprights with bolts and have much greater weight-bearing capacity. The bolt fixings make this a form of adjustable shelving - racks can be constructed, reconfigured, and dismantled and reused as necessary.|$|R

5000|$|Many {{types of}} pallet storage racks are {{available}} with different designs to fulfill specific functions or create specific advantages. To create the ideal <b>pallet</b> <b>racking</b> system, several considerations {{should be taken into}} account: ...|$|E
50|$|Constructor Group AS is a Norwegian-registered {{international}} company, with {{headquarters in}} Oslo, that specialises {{in the manufacture}} and supply of shelving, <b>pallet</b> <b>racking</b> and similar storage systems, primarily for commercial use in offices, factories, warehouses, museums, archives, libraries and retail outlets.|$|E
50|$|Structural <b>pallet</b> <b>racking</b> can be {{designed}} into {{the structure of the}} building itself, so that the upright columns are simultaneously used to support the roof of the storage facility, in which case the structural pallet rack uprights replace the storage building’s vertical support I-beams. This system is a rack supported building.|$|E
5000|$|Selective <b>pallet</b> <b>rack</b> systems provide easy {{accessibility}} to all products {{at all times}} - important if the inventory is rapidly depleted and restocked (called quick turnover). A selective <b>pallet</b> <b>rack</b> system is commonly used in a [...] "big-box" [...] distribution application, {{as well as in}} retail store inventory rooms, cold storage applications, wholesale stores, etc.|$|R

5000|$|Food {{products}} {{must follow}} FDA regulations and use approved <b>pallet</b> <b>racks.</b> Your location may also require different equipment configurations.|$|R
50|$|Very narrow aisle {{otherwise}} known as VNA, {{is the use of}} selective <b>pallet</b> <b>racking</b> in a tighter configuration to provide maximum space utilization within a storage facility. These systems typically operate in conjunction with wire-guided or rail-guided reach-truck systems. A wire-guided system consists of a wire embedded in the concrete floor that provides tracking for the reach-truck. A rail-guided system consists of angle iron bolted to the floor down the length of each row. Typically, the angle iron is 4” by 3” and ¼” - ⅜” inches thick. A distinct advantage of a narrow aisle <b>pallet</b> <b>racking</b> is fast picking without large aisles which results in improved use of space. When there is limited space, a compact storage method is ideal. Fully adjustable system flexibility and space saving aisles can be manipulated as one to give the greatest amount of pallet storage locations.|$|E
5000|$|Pallets {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{commonly}} used means to store and move product in a distribution center. There are many specialized devices (material handling equipment or MHE) used to handle pallets - see forklift truck, pallet jack, pallet inverter, and unit load .....Automated Storage and Retrieval Systems (ASRS). Pallets are stored on the floor, may be stacked, and may be stored in <b>pallet</b> <b>racking.</b>|$|E
50|$|Seeking a more {{flexible}} and reusable alternative to wooden shelving to store paper and other consumables in his London-based printing business, engineer Demetrius Comino invented the slotted angle steel construction system, Dexion, and began production in 1947. This quickly became popular internationally for domestic and commercial shelving, warehouse <b>pallet</b> <b>racking</b> and other purposes. Dexion and other shelving and racking brands are still marketed by the Norwegian Constructor Group.|$|E

50|$|Some {{disadvantages}} of high density pallet storage systems are; less {{access to all}} stock {{at any given moment}} (although if the stored product is all the same, it should not matter), and the expense of such systems. Selective <b>pallet</b> <b>rack</b> systems are considerably less expensive per pallet position than their higher density counterparts. In most medium to large facilities, however, high density <b>pallet</b> <b>rack</b> systems are essential, since they provide the efficiency of time and high cost facility space is better optimized.|$|R
50|$|What does OSHA {{say about}} <b>pallet</b> <b>rack</b> clips? Although OSHA {{does not get}} {{specific}} on <b>pallet</b> <b>rack</b> requirements for your warehouse, they refer to ANSI which is the Rack Manufacturers Institute Specification for the Design, Testing and Utilization of Industrial Steel Storage Racks. The ANSI document explains the following:5.4.2 Beam Locking Device Except for movable-shelf racks, beams subject to machine loading shall have connection locking devices (or bolts) capable of resisting an upward force of 1,000 pounds (453.6 kg) per connection without failure or disengagement.|$|R
50|$|Free-standing shelf {{frames are}} also usually {{manufactured}} from metal (usually steel), though the shelves {{may be made}} of wood. The metal frames may be formed of slotted angle - steel strips longitudinally pressed into a right-angle or L-shaped section (C- and box-section systems are also used where structures have to carry particularly heavy loads); these sections are perforated with circular holes or elongated slots to allow shelves to be mounted directly or fixed using nuts and bolts. The most heavy duty form of adjustable shelving is <b>pallet</b> <b>racking.</b>|$|E
50|$|Pallet rack is a {{material}} handling storage aid {{system designed to}} store materials on pallets (or “skids”). Although there are many varieties of <b>pallet</b> <b>racking,</b> all types allow for the storage of palletized materials in horizontal rows with multiple levels. Forklift trucks are usually {{an integral part of}} any pallet rack system as they are usually required to place the loaded pallets onto the racks for storage. Since the Second World War, pallet racks have become an essential and ubiquitous element of most modern warehouses, manufacturing facilities, retail centers, and other storage and distribution facilities.|$|E
50|$|The {{length of}} the shelf {{is based upon the}} space {{limitations}} of its siting and the amount of weight which it will be expected to hold. The vertical distance between the shelves is based upon the space limitations of the unit's siting and the height of the objects; adjustable shelving systems allow the vertical distance to be altered. The unit can be fixed or be some form of mobile shelving. The most heavy duty shelving is <b>pallet</b> <b>racking.</b> In a store, the front edge of the shelf under the object(s) held might be used to display the name, product number, pricing, and other information about the object(s).|$|E
5000|$|Use only quality pallets {{that are}} not damaged. To save money, or perhaps from neglectful management, some {{warehouses}} use pallets until they become faulty and dangerous. Regular inspection of pallets for broken or fractured planks or stringers, protruding nails, and missing support blocks is essential. Damaged pallets can cause loading and unloading problems; for example, loose stringers can get hung up on the <b>pallet</b> <b>racks,</b> which can cause loads to fall from high positions. Also, faulty pallets can cause obstruction problems in flow systems by jamming certain <b>pallet</b> <b>rack</b> designs.|$|R
5000|$|Row spacers are {{sometimes}} used if uprights {{are arranged in}} back-to-back rows; the spacers are mounted between adjacent columns {{to ensure that the}} rows are kept straight and to give the <b>pallet</b> <b>racks</b> even more strength and steadiness.|$|R

The lengths of upright specimens and testing procedure, for local and distortional buckling, were chosen according to European <b>pallet</b> <b>rack</b> design code provisions. Test on base materials and imperfection measurements have been also performed. In order to study the distortional-global interactive buckling, the ECBL method has been used. The paper presents the main results of these investigations...|$|R
