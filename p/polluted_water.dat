5|$|Organic mercury {{compounds}} are historically important but are of little industrial {{value in the}} western world. Mercury(II) salts are a rare example of simple metal complexes that react directly with aromatic rings. Organo{{mercury compounds}} are always divalent and usually two-coordinate and linear geometry. Unlike organocadmium and organozinc compounds, organomercury compounds do not react with water. They usually have the formula HgR2, which are often volatile, or HgRX, which are often solids, where R is aryl or alkyl and X is usually halide or acetate. Methylmercury, a generic term for compounds with the formula CH3HgX, is a dangerous family of compounds that are often found in <b>polluted</b> <b>water.</b> They arise by {{a process known as}} biomethylation.|$|E
5|$|Parts of Varanasi are {{contaminated}} with industrial chemicals including toxic heavy metal. Studies of wastewater from Varanasi's sewage treatment plants identify that water's contamination with metals and the reuse of this water for irrigation {{as a way}} that the toxic metals come to be in the plants that people grow for food. One studied example is palak, a popular leafy vegetable which takes up heavy metal when it is in the soil, and which people then eat. Some of the polluting sludge contains minerals which are fertiliser, which could make <b>polluted</b> <b>water</b> attractive to use. Pesticides used in local farming are persistent enough to be spread through the water, to sewer treatment, then back to the farms as wastewater.|$|E

5|$|Since {{urbanization}} {{began in}} the 1960s, sudden high and sediment-lacking flows of <b>polluted</b> <b>water</b> began to destroy the native riparian vegetation once found along much of the creek. Exotic plants, including tobacco tree, castor bean, pampas grass, periwinkle, and Artichoke thistle, but most notably the giant reed, then replaced the historic live oaks, sycamores and alders as riparian vegetation. These plants have crowded out native vegetation, {{and in the case}} of giant reed, crowded out native animals—giant reed does not provide habitat for any native Southern California animals. These invasive species are most prevalent along upper Sulphur Creek (Sulphur Creek Reservoir prevents these plants from spreading downstream), much of the Aliso Creek mainstem, and some parts of Wood Canyon Creek.|$|E
5|$|Actual {{purification}} of {{the waste}} water from the Brussels-Capital Region was not completed until the 21st century, when two purification stations were built. The south station treats refuse water from 360,000 inhabitants, which is about {{one third of the}} <b>polluted</b> <b>water,</b> and lies on the border of Anderlecht and Forest. The north station, completed in March 2007, is located near the border of the Brussels-Capital Region, between the Senne and the Charleroi-Willebroek Canal, near Buda Bridge. A portion of the cost was footed by the Flemish Government, as 7 of the adjacent municipalities lie within the Flemish Region. This station is capable of treating the water of 1,100,000 inhabitants and should finally be capable of fully purifying the Senne, which had long caused much of the pollution of the Scheldt river.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1955, the eastern United States {{experienced}} generally hot and dry weather, leading to drought conditions and decreased water levels. When Hurricane Connie struck, its rainfall moistened the soil and heightened creeks throughout the Mid-Atlantic and New England. Hurricane Diane struck North Carolina just five days later and affected the same general area. After floods in 1936, the United States federal government enacted plans to prevent future devastating floods, although they made no progress by the time Connie and Diane struck in 1955. Along the Delaware River in the 1930s, state legislatures in New Jersey and Pennsylvania had established a commission that worked to clean up <b>polluted</b> <b>water,</b> but the legislators and commission blocked federal help, comparing it to European socialism; this was {{in contrast to the}} federally funded Tennessee Valley Authority, which mitigated flooding along the Tennessee River.|$|E

5|$|With the {{introduction}} of non-native species, predominantly giant reed, castor bean and tobacco tree, native plant species in the watershed began to die out. As giant reed is not suitable habitat for many species, areas infested by giant reed are biologically dead in comparison with unaffected areas. It can grow extremely fast, removing too much water from the creek, and during flood events, {{many parts of the}} giant reed can wash downstream and re-establish themselves as a new colony, increasing the problem. Along with increasing concentrations of nutrients from fertilizer and other substances contained in runoff, algal blooms began to hurt the water quality of the creek, especially above Sulphur Creek Reservoir. The historically seasonal creek was replaced with a constant flow of <b>polluted</b> <b>water</b> from several large storm drains and many smaller ones.|$|E
5|$|With {{his wife}} Hadley Richardson, Hemingway first visited the Festival of San Fermín in Pamplona, Spain, in 1923, {{where he was}} {{following}} his recent passion for bullfighting. The couple returned to Pamplona in 1924—enjoying the trip immensely—this time accompanied by Chink Dorman-Smith, John Dos Passos, and Donald Ogden Stewart and his wife. The two returned a third time in June1925 and stayed at the hotel of his friend Juanito Quintana. That year, they brought with them a different group of American and British expatriates: Hemingway's Michigan boyhood friend Bill Smith, Stewart, recently divorced Duff, Lady Twysden, her lover Pat Guthrie, and Harold Loeb. In Pamplona, the group quickly disintegrated. Hemingway, attracted to Duff, was jealous of Loeb, who had recently been on a romantic getaway with her; {{by the end of}} the week the two men had a public fistfight. Against this background was the influence of the young matador from Ronda, Cayetano Ordóñez, whose brilliance in the bullring affected the spectators. Ordóñez honored Hemingway's wife by presenting her, from the bullring, with the ear of a bull he killed. Outside of Pamplona, the fishing trip to the Irati River (near Burguete in Navarre) was marred by <b>polluted</b> <b>water.</b>|$|E
