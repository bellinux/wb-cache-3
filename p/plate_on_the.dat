5|$|Culbreth was {{the left}} field umpire for the single-game playoff between the Colorado Rockies and the San Diego Padres that decided the NL's 2007 wild card team. The game {{ended in the}} 13th inning when home plate umpire Tim McClelland called Rockies player Matt Holliday safe at home plate; the call was {{controversial}} and replays did not show clearly whether or not Holliday touched the <b>plate</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> play. Colorado won by a score of 9–8.|$|E

Changes include revised bumpers, there is a chrome moulding above the number <b>plate</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> boot lid, refreshed alloy wheel designs and the Holden IQ system. Also the SSV model was introduced. The Holden Ute is sold as the Lumina Ute in South Africa.|$|E
5|$|Millipede bodies may be {{flattened}} or cylindrical, and {{are composed}} of numerous metemeric segments, each with an exoskeleton consisting of five chitinous plates: a single plate above (the tergite), one at each side (pleurites), and a <b>plate</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> underside (sternite) where the legs attach. In many millipedes, these plates are fused to varying degrees, sometimes forming a single cylindrical ring. The plates are typically hard, being impregnated with calcium salts. Because they lack a waxy cuticle, millipedes are susceptible to water loss and must {{spend most of their}} time in moist or humid environments.|$|E

50|$|The single-story {{building}} has a vernacular design {{with a central}} entrance foyer, a hipped roof, a bell tower atop the foyer, and a flagstaff <b>on</b> <b>the</b> site of the roof. When the building was constructed, both the interior and exterior were covered by patterned metal plates. The plates were decorated based on their location; for instance, <b>the</b> <b>plates</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> outer walls were designed to resemble ashlar stone, and <b>the</b> <b>plates</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> roof resembled shingles. While most of the exterior plates have since been covered, the interior <b>plates</b> and <b>the</b> <b>plates</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> foyer's gable are still in place.|$|R

5|$|Pistorius uses {{custom-made}} spike pads on the blades. Before {{development of}} the pads, his spikes were changed by roughing up the surface and applying over-the-counter spikes by hand, but the results using this method were inconsistent. Research was conducted in Össur’s Iceland lab using a pressure-sensitive treadmill and film at 500 fps to measure the blade strike, and produced a spike pad which includes a midsole of two machine-molded pieces of foam of different densities to cushion impact, with a carbon fibre <b>plate</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> bottom. The developers attached the pad with contact cement, which can be quickly removed with the application of heat when the spike pad needs to be changed.|$|E
5|$|The skull is {{delicate}} and lightly built. The rostrum, the front {{part of the}} skull, is narrow and fairly long; it is shorter in eastern voalavo. The narrow zygomatic plate (a <b>plate</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> side of the skull) extends back to about {{the front of the}} first upper molar (M1). The zygomatic notch, a notch in {{the upper part of the}} zygomatic plate, is small. The zygomatic arches (cheekbones) are narrow, but as usual in nesomyines contain a relatively long jugal bone. The interorbital region (between the eyes) is narrow and short and lacks accessory shelves and ridges. The braincase also lacks such ridges.|$|E
5|$|Juliomys anoblepas {{is similar}} to the other members of its genus in the {{configuration}} of its zygomatic plate (a bony <b>plate</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> side of the skull). It hardly extends forward in front of the connection between the plate and {{the main body of the}} skull, and that connection is relatively low on the skull. Furthermore, the incisive foramina, openings in the front part of the palate, extend to a point between the first molars, and the palate is short, with its back margin between the third molars. The living species of Juliomys differ from J.anoblepas in various characters, including shorter incisive foramina in two species and the shape of the zygomatic arch (cheekbone) in J.anoblepas. The upper molar row is 4.13mm long, which makes J.anoblepas the largest known species of Juliomys.|$|E

5|$|The humerus is very robust with {{strongly}} expanded {{upper and}} lower ends. Humerus specimen OUMNH J.13575 has a length of 388 millimetres. Its shaft circumference equals {{about half of the}} total humerus length. The humerus head continues to the front and the rear into large bosses, together forming a massive bone <b>plate.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> front outer side of the shaft a large triangular deltopectoral crest is present, the attachment for the Musculus pectoralis major and the Musculus deltoideus. It covers about the upper half of the shaft length, its apex positioned rather low. The ulna is extremely robust, for its absolute size more heavily built than with any other known member of the Tetanurae. The only known specimen, BMNH 36585, has a length of 232 millimetres and a minimal shaft circumference of 142 millimetres. The ulna is straight in front view and has a large olecranon, the attachment process for the Musculus triceps brachii. Radius, wrist and hand are unknown.|$|E

25|$|Each {{of the two}} aft {{external}} tank umbilical plates {{mate with}} a corresponding <b>plate</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> orbiter. The plates help maintain alignment among the umbilicals. Physical strength at the umbilical plates is provided by bolting corresponding umbilical plates together.

25|$|In fish, the {{scapular}} blade is {{a structure}} {{attached to the}} upper surface of the articulation of the pectoral fin, and {{is accompanied by a}} similar coracoid <b>plate</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> lower surface.

50|$|To {{protect itself}} against predators {{such as the}} large gorgonopsid therapsids, it had {{developed}} an armadillo-like armored plating covering its body and tail. The armor consisted of broad <b>plates</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> shoulders and hips and narrower <b>plates</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> rest of the body. Although no teeth of the creature have been found, it probably fed on insects, worms, and snails.|$|R

25|$|The range {{signal was}} {{received}} {{on a single}} half-wave dipole mounted at {{the middle of the}} horizontal antenna array, fed into a four-tube RF receiver, and then into a four-tube intermediate frequency (IF) system. The output was fed directly into the lower Y-axis plate of one of the two CRTs. The upper <b>plate</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Y-axis was fed the output of a calibrator, allowing it to be adjusted so the beam was centred vertically. Signals being received from the antenna would thus cause the beam to deflect downward to produce a blip, {{as in the case of}} Chain Home.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. SiCp/A 356 {{composites}} containing 20 % (volume fraction) SiC {{and three}} kinds of different filler metals were investigated by vacuum brazing process. Brazability of SiCp/A 356 composites was analyzed after nickel <b>plating</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> surface of composites and without nickel plating process. The effects of holding time <b>on</b> microstructure of <b>the</b> brazed joints of SiCp/A 356 composite were studied by metallographic microscope, SEM and Energy spectrum analysis. The results show that nickel <b>plating</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> surface of composite contribute to improve brazability of SiCp/A 356 composites prominently, while inferior brazability displayed without nickel <b>plating</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> surface of composites. Hardness of joints brazed at holding time of 6 min, 8 min and 10 min were studied, consequently the hardness of the weld seam region is the highest when the holding time was 8 min...|$|R
