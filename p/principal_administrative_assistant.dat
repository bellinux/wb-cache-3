40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{describe}} the role of the C. E. O. (Education Coordinator) in Band Controlled Schools on selected Indian reserves in Saskatchewan. A number of key functions and leadership components were identified from the literature and were formulated into a structural framework. In this framework, the C. E. O. position was explored and studied under three major components: role, autonomy, and contextual conditions. The aspects of role which were examined were the identifying of the C. E. O., role expectations, role tasks, and obstacles. The functions related to autonomy were identified as performance, overlaps, perceptions, and organizations. Job satisfaction, personal qualities and attributes, and politics were related to contextual conditions. The population was five administrative teams working on Indian reserves in Northern Saskatchewan. These teams consisted of a Chief Executive Officer, the Principal, and, where applicable, the <b>Administrative</b> <b>Assistant.</b> The schools were selected because two have been Band operated for five years or more, whereas the other three were Band operated for less than two years when this study began. A case study approach was used. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews with the C. E. O. s, <b>Principals,</b> and <b>Administrative</b> <b>Assistants.</b> An interview guide containing 18 questions designed for the Education Coordinator, and 18 questions designed specifically for Principals was used. It was concluded that broad, general similarities existed from Band to Band. However, the role was influenced by the needs, wants, and thrusts of the individual Bands. The personality, background, and interests of the individual C. E. O. had an impact upon how the role was enacted. It was difficult to isolate and compartmentalize the job of the C. E. O. on an Indian reserve. Although this study was limited in scope, a number of conclusions were reached and some implications were discussed. The C. E. O. position is a relatively new one and is in many ways unique. It would be of benefit for administrators to learn more about this position since nearly every on-reserve school in Saskatchewan is controlled by the Band. The C. E. O. position will grow and develop and have a great impact upon the future of Indian Education...|$|R

40|$|In nost school's {{the duties}} of the {{principal}} are not defined. A principal who is concerned with improvement of the instructional program has a wide range of roles to pVty. However, feelings run strong in the controversy over whether principals can or ought to be instructional leaders in their schools. Lack of time, power, clear role definition, and preparation are some of the roadblocks slowing down principals-that want to be instructional leaders. Some techniques for getting around the roadblocks include <b>administrative</b> <b>assistants</b> that'take over the <b>principal's</b> <b>administrative</b> functions; autnoMous schools where decisions regarding the instructional program are-Made at the building level; and sharing power with other professional personnel. Two innovative programs offer promise that principals can be trained to perform the complex and demanding role of instructional leader. (Author/WU) ...|$|R
