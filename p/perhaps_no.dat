5|$|General life {{themes are}} portrayed on wall panels {{such as the}} way horses were reined, the type of stirrup used, the {{depiction}} of dancers, musicians, instrumentalists, and rows of animals such as lions and elephants (where no two animals are identical). <b>Perhaps</b> <b>no</b> other temple in the country depicts the Ramayana and Mahabharata epics more effectively than the Hoysaleshwara temple at Halebidu.|$|E
5|$|It is <b>perhaps</b> <b>no</b> {{accident}} that the factuality of the Italian Renaissance has been most vigorously questioned {{by those who are}} not obliged to take a professional interest in the aesthetic aspects of civilization—historians of economic and social developments, political and religious situations, and, most particularly, natural science—but only exceptionally by students of literature and hardly ever by historians of Art.|$|E
5|$|<b>Perhaps</b> <b>no</b> {{work of art}} so {{imperfect}} ever announced {{such power}} in the artist—perhaps no artist so powerful ever rested his fame on so imperfect a production—as Thalaba. The author calls it a metrical romance; he might have called it a lyrical one; for the story is told, as in an ode, by implication; not directly, as in an epopoeia. It is a gallery of successive pictures. Each is strikingly descriptive... but the personages, like the figures of landscape-painters, are often almost lost in the scene: they appear as the episodical or accessory objects.|$|E

5|$|A {{long and}} winding route {{had to be}} taken to reach topside; the steerage-class accommodation, located on C through G decks, was at the extreme ends of the decks, and so was the {{farthest}} away from the lifeboats. By contrast, the first-class accommodation was located on the upper decks and so was nearest. Proximity to the lifeboats thus became a key factor in determining who got into them. To add to the difficulty, many of the steerage passengers did not understand or speak English. It was <b>perhaps</b> <b>no</b> coincidence that English-speaking Irish immigrants were disproportionately represented among the steerage passengers who survived. Many of those who did survive owed their lives to third-class steward John Edward Hart, who organised three trips into the ship's interior to escort groups of third-class passengers up to the boat deck. Others made their way through open barriers or climbed emergency ladders.|$|E
5|$|<b>Perhaps</b> <b>no</b> {{director}} better displayed {{that spirit}} than the German-born Robert Siodmak, {{who had already}} made a score of films before his 1940 arrival in Hollywood. Working mostly on A features, he made eight films now regarded as classic-era film noirs (a figure matched only by Lang and Mann). In addition to The Killers, Burt Lancaster's debut and a Hellinger/Universal co-production, Siodmak's other important contributions to the genre include 1944's Phantom Lady (a top-of-the-line B and Woolrich adaptation), the ironically titled Christmas Holiday (1944), and Cry of the City (1948). Criss Cross (1949), with Lancaster again the lead, exemplifies how Siodmak brought {{the virtues of the}} B-movie to the A noir. In addition to the relatively looser constraints on character and message at lower budgets, the nature of B production lent itself to the noir style for economic reasons: dim lighting saved on electricity and helped cloak cheap sets (mist and smoke also served the cause); night shooting was often compelled by hurried production schedules; plots with obscure motivations and intriguingly elliptical transitions were sometimes the consequence of hastily written scripts, of which there was not always enough time or money to shoot every scene. In Criss Cross, Siodmak achieved these effects with purpose, wrapping them around Yvonne De Carlo, playing the most understandable of femme fatales; Dan Duryea, in one of his many charismatic villain roles; and Lancaster as an ordinary laborer turned armed robber, doomed by a romantic obsession.|$|E
5|$|<b>Perhaps</b> <b>no</b> American neo-noirs better {{reflect the}} classic noir A-movie-with-a-B-movie-soul {{than those of}} director-writer Quentin Tarantino; neo-noirs of his such as Reservoir Dogs (1992) and Pulp Fiction (1994) display a relentlessly self-reflexive, {{sometimes}} tongue-in-cheek sensibility, similar {{to the work of}} the New Wave directors and the Coens. Other films from the era readily identifiable as neo-noir (some retro, some more au courant) include director John Dahl's Kill Me Again (1989), Red Rock West (1992), The Last Seduction (1993), as well as Gus van Sant's To Die For (1995), and Andrew Davis's A Perfect Murder (1998); four adaptations of novels by Jim Thompson—The Kill-Off (1989), After Dark, My Sweet (1990), The Grifters (1990), and the remake of The Getaway (1994); and many more, including adaptations of the work of other major noir fiction writers: The Hot Spot (1990), from Hell Hath No Fury, by Charles Williams; Miami Blues (1990), from the novel by Charles Willeford; and Out of Sight (1998), from the novel by Elmore Leonard. Several films by director-writer David Mamet involve noir elements: House of Games (1987), Homicide (1991), The Spanish Prisoner (1997), and Heist (2001). On television, Remington Steele (1982–87) and Moonlighting (1985–89) paid homage to classic noir while demonstrating an unusual appreciation of the sense of humor often found in the original cycle. Between 1983 and 1989, Mickey Spillane's hardboiled private eye Mike Hammer was played with wry gusto by Stacy Keach in a series and several stand-alone television films (an unsuccessful revival followed in 1997–98). The British miniseries The Singing Detective (1986), written by Dennis Potter, {{tells the story of a}} mystery writer named Philip Marlow; widely considered one of the finest neo-noirs in any medium, some critics rank it among the greatest television productions of all time.|$|E

25|$|In 1935–36 Martín Dihigo {{dominated}} the league as <b>perhaps</b> <b>no</b> other player in history; {{he led the}} league in pitching (11-2) as well as in most of the hitting categories: average (.358), runs (42), hits (63), triples (8), and RBI (38), while leading Santa Clara to the pennant.|$|E
25|$|However, most {{religious}} systems acknowledge {{an afterlife}} and improving this {{is seen as}} an even more basic good. In many other moral systems, also, remaining on Earth in a state that lacks honor or power over self is less desirable— consider seppuku in bushido, kamikazes or the role of suicide attacks in Jihadi rhetoric. In all these systems, remaining on Earth is <b>perhaps</b> <b>no</b> higher than a third-place value.|$|E

25|$|The {{oldest and}} most celebrated of the chansons de geste is The Song of Roland (earliest version {{composed}} c. 1098), seen by some as the national epic of France (comparable with Beowulf in England, the Song of the Nibelungs in Germany and the Lay of el Cid in Spain). It is <b>perhaps</b> <b>no</b> coincidence that the Song of Roland was first written down at a date very close to that of Pope Urban's call (1095) for the First Crusade; its plot {{may be seen as}} a glorification of the crusader ethos.|$|E
25|$|Membership in the {{legislature}} is best regarded as being a full-time job during the session and a part-time job {{the rest of the}} year due to committee meetings and hearings (for which legislators are reimbursed their expenses and receive a mileage allowance). A few members are on enough committees to make something of a living from being legislators; most are independent businesspeople and attorneys, although the latter group is <b>perhaps</b> <b>no</b> longer the absolute majority of members that it at one time comprised. In keeping with Tennessee's agricultural roots, some senators and representatives are farmers.|$|E
25|$|In the meantime, though, the Wealden ironmasters enjoyed {{their day}} in the sun, <b>perhaps</b> <b>no</b> more than Parson Levett whose career was thrust upon him by circumstance. He became a very, very rich man. His brother John {{was one of the}} largest landowners in Sussex. At John Levett's death, the Levett brother had died possessed of more than 20 manors across Sussex. At his death nearly 20 years later, Reverend William Levett's will shows that he fared even better. The voluminous document, in which Levett named Anthony Browne, 1st Viscount Montagu as executor, {{demonstrates}} the riches that accrued to the entrepreneurs of the coming Iron Age.|$|E

25|$|The United States, meanwhile, saw league bowling soar in the 1960s {{and early}} 1970s—partially {{influenced}} by popular professional bowlers Don Carter, Dick Weber, Carmen Salvino and Earl Anthony. The number of sanctioned bowling alleys in the U.S. peaked at about 12,000 in the mid-1960s, while {{membership in the}} American Bowling Congress also peaked at just under 4.6million male bowlers. The popularity of the sport in America was <b>perhaps</b> <b>no</b> more evident than when Don Carter became the first athlete of any kind to sign a US$1million endorsement contract, inking a multi-year deal with Ebonite International in 1964. By comparison, Arnold Palmer earned just $5,000 in 1961 endorsing Wilson golf equipment, and NFL quarterback Joe Namath made just $10,000 in 1968 to famously shave off his moustache with a Schick razor.|$|E
25|$|Around 1300–1350 the Medieval Warm Period {{gave way}} to the Little Ice Age. The colder climate {{resulted}} in agricultural crises, the first of which is known as the Great Famine of 1315-1317. The demographic consequences of this famine, however, were not as severe as the plagues that occurred later in the century, particularly the Black Death. Estimates of the death rate caused by this epidemic range from one third to as much as sixty percent. By around 1420, the accumulated effect of recurring plagues and famines had reduced the population of Europe to <b>perhaps</b> <b>no</b> {{more than a third of}} what it was a century earlier. The effects of natural disasters were exacerbated by armed conflicts; this was particularly the case in France during the Hundred Years' War.|$|E
25|$|The {{journals}} of the reigns of George IV and William IV, extending from 1817 to 1837, {{were published in}} obedience to his directions almost ten years after his death. Few publications have been received with greater interest by the public; five large editions were sold {{in little more than}} a year, and the demand in America was as great as in England. These journals were regarded as a faithful record of the impressions made on the mind of a competent observer, at the time, by the events he witnessed and the persons with whom he associated. Greville did not stoop to collect or record private scandal. His object appears to have been to leave behind him some of the materials of history, by which the men and actions of his own time would be judged. He records not so much public events as the private causes which led to them; and <b>perhaps</b> <b>no</b> English memoir-writer has left behind him a more valuable contribution to the history of the 19th century. Greville published anonymously, in 1845, a volume on the Past and Present Policy of England in Ireland, in which he advocated the payment of the Roman Catholic clergy; and he was also the author of several pamphlets on the events of his day.|$|E

500|$|Hobbs scored fewer runs in 1908, despite better {{conditions}} for batting. Even so, he scored 81 in the Gentlemen v Players game, achieved a batting average over 40 in the County Championship and scored six centuries for Surrey. In all first-class games, Hobbs scored 1,904 runs at 37.33. For his achievements that season, Hobbs {{was chosen as}} one of Wisden's Cricketers of the Year. The citation noted that [...] "at the present time there is <b>perhaps</b> <b>no</b> better professional batsman in England except Hayward and Tyldesley".|$|E
500|$|Under the {{restored}} King Constantine I, whose return was endorsed overwhelmingly in a referendum, Greece {{went on to}} lose the Greco-Turkish War with heavy military and civilian casualties. The territory gained on the Turkish mainland during Alexander's reign was lost. Alexander's death {{in the midst of}} an election campaign helped destabilize the Venizelos regime, and the resultant loss of Allied support contributed to the failure of Greece's territorial ambitions. Winston Churchill wrote, [...] "it is <b>perhaps</b> <b>no</b> exaggeration to remark that a quarter of a million persons died of this monkey's bite." ...|$|E
500|$|This {{reveals that}} there is a {{struggle}} between the acceptance of imaginative experience that exists only within {{a small part of the}} mind. This struggle, according to Walter Evert, has [...] "no relevance to the world of external action and <b>perhaps</b> <b>no</b> truth to offer even the visionary dreamer himself." [...] However Anthony Hecht looks at the problem in a different way and believes that there must be a connection between the external and internal worlds for the narrator to even face the problem. Regardless, the narrator never states that this worship of Psyche or embracing the imagination would aid mankind, but the poem does rejoice in exercising the imagination.|$|E
