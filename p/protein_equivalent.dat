2500|$|The word {{proteomics}} {{was first}} used in 1994 by Marc Wilkins as the study of “the <b>protein</b> <b>equivalent</b> of a genome”. It is defined as all of the proteins expressed in a biological system under specific physiologic conditions {{at a certain point}} in time. [...] It can change with any biochemical alteration, and so it can only be defined under certain conditions. [...] Neuroproteomics is a subset of this field dealing with the complexities and multi-system origin of neurological disease. [...] Neurological function is based on the interactions of many proteins of different origin, and so requires a systematic study of subsystems within its proteomic structure.|$|E

A cellular proteome is the collection of proteins found in a particular cell type under a particular set of environmental conditions such as exposure to hormone stimulation. It can also be useful to consider an organism's complete proteome, which can be conceptualized as the complete set of proteins from all of the various cellular proteomes. This is very roughly the <b>protein</b> <b>equivalent</b> of the genome. The term [...] "proteome" [...] has also been used to refer to the collection of proteins in certain sub-cellular biological systems.

40|$|Rapidly {{expanding}} {{ethanol production}} in the U. S. was given further impetus {{with the passage of}} the Energy Policy Act of 2005 mandating a minimum production of 7. 5 billion gallons of renewable fuels by 2012. The availability of the by-product feeds of ethanol production (corn gluten feed and meal and DDG) has not only become a significant share of the protein feed sector, but also the increase has been and will be extensive. The challenge is how to incorporate these feeds into econometric models of U. S. agriculture and measure their impact on the utilization of other feeds, particularly coarse grain and soybean meal. Another task is to forecast prices on the by-product feeds. This paper suggests a couple of procedures embracing the entire sector of livestock concentrates, including both protein and energy feeds. The feeds were converted into <b>protein</b> <b>equivalents</b> and energy equivalents and introduced into regression equations predicting (1) the amounts of soybean meal and coarse grain fed and (2) the amount of protein feeds utilized in <b>protein</b> <b>equivalents</b> and the amount of all concentrate feeds utilized in energy equivalents. In case (2), the amounts of soybean meal and coarse grain fed were derived by deducting the <b>protein</b> and energy <b>equivalents</b> of the other feeds from the totals predicted. This case was the one selected to be incorporated into AGMOD, an econometric model of U. S. agriculture. To forecast prices on the by-product feeds of ethanol production, synthetic prices for protein and energy were derived from prices on soybean meal and corn. Applying these prices to the ethanol byproduct feeds, values for these feeds were generated. These values were the major explanatory variables associated with the by-product prices supplemented by variables representing the ratios of the utilization of the respective feeds in <b>protein</b> <b>equivalents</b> to the total utilization of protein feeds in <b>protein</b> <b>equivalents.</b> Prices on corn gluten feed and DDG have been declining relative to their values, with continued downward pressure in prospect for prices on DDG in the next 10 years.

40|$|Abstract Background. The <b>protein</b> <b>equivalent</b> of {{nitrogen}} appearance is an indirect index {{commonly used to}} assess dietary protein intake in patients on CAPD. Moreover {{it has been suggested}} that the ratio between nitrogen appearance and dietary nitrogen intake (fractional urea synthesis) can predict nitrogen balance in uraemic patients. Several formulae to dir-ectly calculate the <b>protein</b> <b>equivalent</b> {{of nitrogen}} appearance have been published. It has not been established, however, what formulae give the most appropriate estimate of protein intake and nitrogen appearance. Study design. Nitrogen balance studies were carried out in seven stable patients on CAPD. All of the patients were receiving a diet whose protein con-tent (1. 2 g/kg/body wt/day) and calorie content (35 kcal/kg/body wt/day) were rigorously controlled. Six formulae for calculating <b>protein</b> <b>equivalent</b> of nitrogen appearance and nitrogen appearance were tested and the agreement of the estimating formulae was evaluated by means of the Bland and Altman method. Result. Net nitrogen balance was 1. 68 ± 0. 9 g/N day, protein intake (g/day) 81 + 19, protein intake (g/kg) 1. 05 + 0. 17. Differences in <b>protein</b> <b>equivalent</b> of nitrogen appearance of up to about 20 % were found. The smallest differences between protein equi-valent of nitrogen appearance and protein intake were obtained by the formulae of Bergstrom (1 + 7 g, limits of agreement — 12 and + 15 g) and Blumenkrantz (— 2 ± 5 g, limits of agreement — 11 and + 7 g). The formula of Bergstrom most closely estimated nitrogen appearance (— 0. 35 + 0. 89 g). Using such formula, the fractional urea synthesis was 54 + 12 %, giving evidence of positive nitrogen balances. Conclusion. For the routine monitoring of <b>protein</b> <b>equivalent</b> of nitrogen appearance in CAPD patients, we recommend Bergstrom's formula with the deter-mination of dialysate protein losses.

In each experiment, commercial broilers were fed a diet formulated to meet NRC requirements for the first seven days. The diet contained 23 % CP and 3200 kcal/kg ME and also served as the Positive Control Diet (PC). On day 7, birds were sorted by weight into battery pens with 5 birds per pen. In the first experiment, six dietary treatments were utilized with eight replicates per treatment for a total of 48 pens. For the remaining dietary treatments, 13 % CP diets were formulated and various levels of crystalline amino acids were added back to meet either digestible amino acid levels from a 22 % CP diet from previous experiments from our lab at the University of Missouri (Guaiume, 2007) or digestible amino acid requirements set by Baker and coworkers (1993) using the ideal protein concept. One treatment using the University of Missouri values contained no glutamic acid and a low <b>protein</b> <b>equivalent</b> of 15. 5 % (MLPE), while others contained varying levels of glutamic acid to achieve a high <b>protein</b> <b>equivalent</b> of 20 % (MHPE) or a mid-level <b>protein</b> <b>equivalent</b> of 18 % (MMPE). Similarly, two treatments were developed using Baker et al.

In Experiment 2, four dietary treatments with 12 replicates were utilized for a total of 48 pens. The same 23 % CP diet used as the PC in Experiment 1 was utilized in Experiment 2. The remaining treatments in Experiment 2 consisted of 13 % crude protein diets with crystalline amino acids added back to meet control levels and either no glutamic acid to yield a <b>protein</b> <b>equivalent</b> of 17. 5 % (PE- 17. 5), or glutamic acid added to meet an 18. 75 % (PE- 18. 75) or 20 % (PE- 20) <b>protein</b> <b>equivalent.</b> All diets were formulated on a digestible basis and were designed to be isocaloric.

40|$|Origin {{and purpose}} of {{research}} Dichloro-diphenyl-trichloroethane or DDT as it is more commonly known, was first used extensively by the armed forces in the Pacific Area during World War II. This insecticide {{is not only a}} very toxic contact and stomach poison, but also is quite residual on most types of surfaces. Because of these qualities, it was selected to control the malaria mosquito and thus aided in the conquest of many disease-ridden islands of the Pacific. When DDT became available to the general public after the war, it was found not only to be effective against mosquitoes but also many other types of insects. Among these insects are the alfalfa weevil (Hypera postica hon.) and lygus bugs (Lygus elisus Van D., Lygus hesperus Knight) that had previously impaired the production of alfalfa in Utah and other areas. Although treatment of alfalfa fields is usually confined to alfalfa for seed production, DDT-dusted alfalfa straw and DDT dusted alfalfa hay are fed to farm livestock. In ruminant animals, microorganisms {{play an important role in}} the synthesis of protein from nitrogenous non-protein compounds and also aid in the break-down of many complex plant materials so that they may be more fully utilized by these animals. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of DDT upon the role played by the microflora and fauna of the rumen in the synthesis, digestion and utilization of certain nutrients by dairy calves. Scope Digestion and balance studies were conducted with Holstein bull calves fed different levels of DDT and <b>protein</b> <b>equivalent</b> in the ration.

40|$|Background: In {{maternal}} PKU, protein substitute (PS) {{is provided}} by phenylalanine (PHE) -free l-amino acids (AA), but glycomacropeptide-based protein substitute (GMP) is an alternative consideration. Objective: To describe the first Portuguese Maternal Phenylketonuria (MPKU) partially managed with GMP. Case report: A 31  year old MPKU female with classical PKU (mutations P 281 L/P 281 L), diagnosed by newborn screening, had a lifelong history of poor metabolic control. She {{has a history of}} partial bicornuate uterus and had a previous miscarriage in the first trimester. Pre-conception, her median blood PHE was 462  μmol/L but throughout pregnancy the median reduced to 258  μmol/L. GMP provided 30  g/day <b>protein</b> <b>equivalent</b> (46  mg/day PHE). Total <b>protein</b> <b>equivalent</b> from PS increased from 58 to 86  g/day during pregnancy but AA provided all additional <b>protein</b> <b>equivalent</b> intake. Both GMP and AA were well tolerated with no morning sickness. Normal morphologic evaluation and adequate fetal growth with cephalic biometry near the 5 th percentile was determined. The infant was born at 39. 3  weeks: weight 2570  g (3 rd percentile), length 47. 5  cm (10 th percentile) and head circumference (HC) of 31. 5  cm (1 st percentile). In the neonatal period, the infant had craniofacial dimorphism with metopic suture prominence. Father also had bitemporal narrowing. By 12  months of age, the infant's weight (15 th percentile), length (50 th percentile) and HC (10 th– 50 th percentile) were normal although bitemporal narrowing persisted. Conclusions: This is the first case reporting the use of GMP in MPKU. Its PHE content did not adversely affect metabolic control although it only provided part of the PS intake. Some intrauterine development delay occurred in the last trimester, although we consider that this is unlikely to be associated with MPKU syndrome or the use of GMP. More published data is essential to examine the impact of using GMP in MPKU on morning sickness severity and aversion, maternal weight gain, blood amino acid concentrations and variability of blood PHE concentrations...|$|E

In yeast, there are 5 small TIM proteins: Tim 8, Tim 9, Tim 10, Tim 12, and Tim 13, with <b>equivalent</b> <b>proteins</b> reported in humans. Using hidden Markov models, we find that many eukaryotes have <b>proteins</b> <b>equivalent</b> to the Tim 8 and Tim 13 and the Tim 9 and Tim 10 subunits. Some eukaryotes provide "snapshots" of evolution, with a single protein showing the features of both Tim 8 and Tim 13, suggesting that a single progenitor gene has given rise to each of the small TIMs through duplication and modification. We show that no "Tim 12 " family of proteins exist, but rather that variant forms of the cognate small TIMs have been recently duplicated and modified to provide new functions: the yeast Tim 12 is a modified form of Tim 10, whereas in humans and some protists variant forms of Tim 9, Tim 8, and Tim 13 are found instead. Sequence motif analysis reveals acidic residues conserved in the Tim 10 substrate-binding tentacles, whereas more hydrophobic residues are found in the equivalent substrate-binding region of Tim 13. The substrate-binding region of Tim 10 and Tim 13 represent structurally independent domains: when the acidic domain from Tim 10 is attached to Tim 13, the Tim 8 –Tim 13 ¹⁰ complex becomes essential and the Tim 9 –Tim 10 complex becomes dispensable.

In the eukaryotic ribosome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, mutations in SUP 46 and SUP 44, encoding the <b>proteins</b> <b>equivalent</b> to S 4 and S 5, lead to omnipotent suppression [...] i. e., to less accurate translation.

We find that they {{have a profound effect on}} the {{accuracy of}} translation and interact with SUP 44 and SUP 46, just as predicted from the E. coli model. Thus, the interplay of these three proteins to provide the optimal level of accuracy of translation has been conserved during the 2 billion years of evolution that separate E. coli from S. cerevisiae...|$|R

Eight F 1 (Holstein × Zebu) cows in the first third of lactation, with an average milk yield of 12. 7 kg (± 3. 1 kg) /day and a live weight of 552 kg (± 30 kg), were used. The experimental design was composed of two simultaneou...|$|E
40|$|Reverse {{transcriptase}} of the avian sarcoma and leukosis retroviruses is a heterodimer {{composed of}} a 63 -kDa alpha and a 95 -kDa beta polypeptide chain, {{both of which are}} encoded in the pol gene and are produced by proteolytic processing of a larger precursor. We previously constructed a bacterial expression clone of the entire pol coding region that produces a protein 4 kDa larger than the mature viral beta subunit. By use of this clone and synthetic oligonucleotides to introduce stop codons, two derivatives have been constructed: one that directs synthesis of a <b>protein</b> <b>equivalent</b> to the mature beta subunit and the other that directs synthesis of a <b>protein</b> <b>equivalent</b> to alpha subunit. Predicted amino acid sequences of these proteins differ from their viral counterparts only by an initiator methionine that was added to the N termini for expression in Escherichia coli. Both bacterially expressed proteins exhibit reverse transcriptase activity and appear to function as homodimers. The properties of these proteins resemble those of the viral reverse transcriptase heterodimer; however, the bacterially produced alpha dimer protein could be distinguished from the other proteins by its increased sensitivity to heat inactivation, which also has been reported for the corresponding viral product. These results show that correct folding and expression of enzymatic function does not require formation of a precursor. The alpha and beta clones provide a convenient source of individual pol gene products for further evaluation of their roles in the synthesis and integration of retroviral DNA...|$|E
40|$|Precise and fluent genetic {{manipulation}} is still lim-ited {{to only a}} few prokaryotes. Ideally the highly advanced technologies available in Escherichia coli could be broadly applied. Our efforts to apply lambda Red technology, widely termed ‘recombineering’, in Photorhabdus and Xenorhabdus yielded only limited success. Consequently we explored the properties of an endogenous Photorhabdus luminescens lambda Red-like operon, Plu 2934 /Plu 2935 /Plu 2936. Bioinfor-matic and functional tests indicate that Plu 2936 is a 5 ’- 3 ’ exonuclease equivalent to Red and Plu 2935 is a single strand annealing <b>protein</b> <b>equivalent</b> to Red. Plu 2934 dramatically enhanced recombineering effi-ciency. Results from bioinformatic analysis and re...|$|E

The RNA transcribed from this promoter represented the major RNA species colinear with open reading frames E 6 and E 7 and can encode the E 7 <b>protein.</b> No <b>equivalent</b> promoter {{was active in}} HPV 16 -containing cancers and cancer-derived cell lines. In those, the major transcripts contained one of two different introns within E 6 and the RNAs could encode two different E 6 proteins and E 7...|$|R
40|$|We have {{previously}} reported that Foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV), which is virulent for cattle and swine, can utilize the integrin αvβ 3 as a receptor on cultured cells. Since those studies were {{performed with the}} human integrin, we have molecularly cloned the bovine homolog of the integrin αvβ 3 and have compared the two receptors for utilization by FMDV. Both the αv and β 3 subunits of the bovine integrin have high degrees of amino acid sequence similarity to their corresponding human subunits in the ectodomains (96 %) and essentially identical transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains. Within the putative ligand-binding domains, the bovine and human αv subunits have a 98. 8 % amino acid sequence similarity while {{there is only a}} 93 % similarity between the β 3 subunits of these two species. COS cell cultures, which are not susceptible to FMDV infection, become susceptible if cotransfected with αv and β 3 subunit cDNAs from a bovine or human source. Cultures cotransfected with the bovine αvβ 3 subunit cDNAs and infected with FMDV synthesize greater amounts of viral proteins than do infected cultures cotransfected with the human integrin subunits. Cells cotransfected with a bovine αv subunit and a human β 3 subunit synthesize viral <b>proteins</b> at levels <b>equivalent</b> to those in cells expressing both human subunits. However, cells cotransfected with the human αv and the bovine β 3 subunits synthesize amounts of viral <b>proteins</b> <b>equivalent</b> to those in cells expressing both bovine subunits, indicating that the bovine β 3 subunit is responsible for the increased effectiveness of this receptor. By engineering chimeric bovine-human β 3 subunits, we have shown that this increase in receptor efficiency is due to sequences encoding the C-terminal one-third of the subunit ectodomain, which contains a highly structured cysteine-rich repeat region. We postulate that amino acid sequence differences within this region may be responsible for structural differences between the human and bovine β 3 subunit, leading to more efficient utilization of the bovine receptor by this bovine pathogen...|$|R
40|$|Activation of {{plasminogen}} through surface-mediated reactions is well recognized. In {{the presence}} of kaolin, purified Hageman factor (Factor XII) changed plasminogen to plasmin, as assayed upon a synthetic amide substrate and by fibrinolysis. Kinetic studies suggested an enzymatic action of Hageman factor upon its substrate, plasminogen. Hageman factor fragments, at a <b>protein</b> concentration <b>equivalent</b> to whole Hageman factor, activated plasminogen to a lesser extent. These protein preparations were not contaminated with other agents implicated in surface-mediated fibrinolysis. Diisopropyl fluorophosphate treatment of plasminogen did not inhibit its activation by Hageman factor. These studies indicate that Hageman factor has a hitherto unsuspected function, the direct activation of plasminogen...|$|R
