5|$|Two {{days after}} the {{television}} appearance, on 11 February 1964, the Beatles' first U.S. concert took place, at Washington Coliseum, a sports arena in Washington, D.C. The concert was attended by eight thousand fans. The Beatles performed on a central stage in the arena, with the audience on all sides, and there were regular <b>pauses</b> <b>to</b> enable the band to turn their equipment around and perform facing in another direction. The concert generated intense excitement. The following day, the Beatles performed a second concert, in Carnegie Hall, New York, which was attended by two thousand fans. The concert was again well received. Following the Carnegie Hall concert, the Beatles flew to Miami Beach and on Sunday 16 February 1964 made their second television appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show, which this time was broadcast live from the Napoleon Ballroom of the Deauville Hotel in Miami Beach. As it had done on 9 February, the television broadcast attracted around 70million viewers. On 22 February 1964, the Beatles returned to the UK. Arriving at Heathrow airport at 7 am, they were met by an estimated ten thousand fans.|$|E

25|$|The hunting {{behaviour}} of the Salticidae is confusingly varied {{compared to}} that of most spiders in other families. Salticids hunt diurnally as a rule, which is consistent with their highly developed visual system. When it detects potential prey, a jumping spider typically begins orienting itself by swivelling its cephalothorax to bring the anterior median eyes to bear. It then moves its abdomen into line with its cephalothorax. After that, it might spend some time inspecting the object of its attention and determining whether a camouflaged or doubtful item of prey is promising, before it starts to stalk slowly forward. When close enough, the spider <b>pauses</b> <b>to</b> attach a dragline, then springs onto the prey.|$|E
25|$|Gene {{sequence}} {{within the}} genome is conserved across the family {{due to a}} phenomenon known as transcriptional polarity (see Mononegavirales) in which genes closest to the 3’ end of the genome are transcribed in greater abundance than those towards the 5’ end. This {{is a result of}} structure of the genome. After each gene is transcribed, the RNA-Dependent RNA polymerase <b>pauses</b> <b>to</b> release the new mRNA when it encounters an intergenic sequence. When the RNA polymerase is paused, there is a chance that it will dissociate from the RNA genome. If it dissociates, it must reenter the genome at the leader sequence, rather than continuing to transcribe the length of the genome. The result is that the further downstream genes are from the leader sequence, the less they will be transcribed by RNA polymerase.|$|E

25|$|In {{the wake}} of the failed revolution, women mourn the deaths of the {{students}} ("Turning") and Marius, wounded but alive, despairs at the sacrifice of so many lives and at the death of his friends while he survives ("Empty Chairs at Empty Tables"). As he wonders who saved his own life, Cosette comforts him, and they reaffirm their blossoming romance. Valjean realises that Cosette will not need him as a caretaker once she's married and gives them his blessing ("Every Day"). Valjean confesses to Marius that he is an escaped convict and must go away because his presence endangers Cosette ("Valjean's Confession"), making Marius promise never to tell Cosette. A few months later, Marius and Cosette marry ("Wedding Chorale"). The Thénardiers crash the reception disguised as nobility and attempt to blackmail Marius, telling him that Valjean is a murderer and that Thénardier saw him carrying a corpse in the sewers after the barricades fell. When Thénardier shows him the ring as proof, Marius realizes that it was Valjean who saved his life. The newlyweds leave to find Valjean (in some productions, Marius <b>pauses</b> <b>to</b> give Thénardier a punch in the face). The Thénardiers are not discouraged, instead gloating that their craven practicality has saved their lives time and time again ("Beggars at the Feast").|$|E
500|$|With the EEF guns {{moved forward}} into {{captured}} Ottoman positions, shelling recommenced at 10:30, continuing with <b>pauses</b> <b>to</b> let the dust settle until noon, {{when there was}} still some concern that the wire {{in front of the}} 74th (Yeomanry) Division had not been cut. [...] "In practice, much of the barbed wire had to be cut by the advancing troops as they came across the obstacle." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{explosion}} as Doofenshmirtz's firecracker rocket launches {{leaves the}} lair filthy and partly destroyed; the creepy look thrills Vanessa's arriving goth friends, who find {{it to be}} cool. Touched by this, Vanessa happily thanks both her father for getting one birthday party right for her and Perry for helping her father out. As the rocket ascends, Doofenshmirtz is himself cursing Perry, as usual, but <b>pauses</b> <b>to</b> notice Love Handel singing below. The band finish their song just as Doofenshmirtz's rocket explodes with a heart-shaped flare. The episode ends with Love Handel singing [...] "Music Makes Us Better" [...] and with everyone (including Doofenshmirtz, who has survived the explosion unscathed) dancing.|$|E

500|$|The minuet is the {{shortest}} among those of the Opus 50, but the trio features an exceptionally long second section, which uses drifting melodies, a fermata {{and a pair of}} two-measure <b>pauses</b> <b>to</b> create a sense of timelessness. Neither the minuet nor the trio reaches a proper conclusion, and in this they continue a feature of the first two movements. [...] The minuet ends with a perfunctory reprise of its main theme and the trio draws out its final cadence with a chromatic passage marked [...] "diminuendo". [...] Again, Haydn reinforces the interconnectedness between the movements with an explicit direction to the performers for an immediate segue from the reprised minuet to the finale.|$|E
500|$|Duckles {{examined}} the song [...] "If Loue loues truth then woemen doe not loue" [...] by Thomas Campion which appears as no. 10 of Drexel 4257 {{and was also}} published in Campion's Third Book of Ayres from about 1617. Campion was generally a conservative composer. [...] In the version present in Drexel 4257, the melody is slightly altered to provide greater sensitivity to the declamatory text, so that {{the speed of the}} verse accelerates naturally, an alteration which Duckles finds an improvement over the original. [...] Many songs are recitative-like. In some of these songs, the bar is enlarged as it approaches the cadence, suggesting a ballad singer who briefly <b>pauses</b> <b>to</b> catch his breath. The hemiola a consistent practice in English music of this time.|$|E
500|$|By 1958, Hand was {{suffering}} from intense pain in his back and faced difficulty in walking. [...] "I can just manage, with not infrequent <b>pauses,</b> <b>to</b> walk {{about a third of}} a mile," [...] he wrote to Felix Frankfurter. [...] "My feet get very numb and my back painful. The truth is that 86 is too long." [...] Soon, he was obliged to use crutches, but he remained mentally sharp and continued to hear cases. In 1960, he worked briefly on President Dwight Eisenhower's [...] "Commission on National Goals", but he resigned because [...] "it involved more work than in the present state of my health I care to add to the judicial work that I am still trying to do".|$|E

500|$|The adaptations {{have had}} an {{influence}} {{on the work of}} the writer Mark Gatiss. Interviewed in 2008, Gatiss said that Lost Hearts is his favourite adaptation because it is the one that frightened him as a child and that [...] "I absolutely love The Treasure of Abbot Thomas. The moment when Michael Bryant has found the treasure and ... is obviously losing his wits. He just says, rationally, 'It is a thing of slime, I think. Darkness and slime ...' There's also the fantastic scene where he thinks he's got away with it by putting the treasure back. The doctor is heading up the drive and he can't quite see him in the sunlight. Then it <b>pauses</b> <b>to</b> that amazing crane shot. ... Very spooky.|$|E
500|$|Spencer's force {{advanced}} {{to a position}} on the old York road at Hart's corners (Hartsdale, New York) and there exchanged fire with the Hessians led by Colonel Johann Rall that were {{at the head of the}} British left column. [...] When Clinton's column threatened their flank, these companies were forced into a retreat across the Bronx River that was initially orderly with <b>pauses</b> <b>to</b> fire from behind stone walls while fire from the troops on Chatterton Hill covered their move, but turned into a rout with the appearance of dragoons. [...] Rall's troops attempted to gain the hill, but were repelled by fire from Haslet's troops and the militia, and retreated to a nearby hilltop on the same side of the river. [...] This concerted defense brought the entire British Army, which was maneuvering as if to attack the entire American line, to a stop.|$|E
500|$|Following this, Gordon {{returns to}} the Citadel, unwillingly aiding Freeman in his journey up the Citadel and {{influencing}} {{the plot of the}} game. As Freeman is pursuing Dr. Breen to his teleporter, Frohman is about to kill Freeman—but he <b>pauses</b> <b>to</b> come up with the perfect one-liner for the occasion, causing him to run out of time; Dr. Breen's teleporter explodes and Frohman is flung off the Citadel peak by the explosion. Dr. Breen also survives, having fallen from the Citadel onto a pile of dead Combine soldiers. However, Frohman falls right onto Breen, killing him. Gordon himself is only seriously injured. Baffled by his ability to survive, he realizes through a flashback that he has been under [...] "Buddha Mode", a cheat code which prevents his health points from dropping below one throughout the comic's duration. Frohman inadvertently turns off the mode, and even spoils an opportunity to be rescued by a group of Vortigaunts, as both Gordon Freeman and Alyx Vance are at the start of [...] In the end, Frohman dies unceremoniously, while survivors of the City 17 uprising find him dead.|$|E

500|$|Critics adulated the {{character}} development of Rick Grimes, {{as well as}} the concluding scene of [...] "Nebraska". Kine appreciated the attempt to incorporate a suspenseful feeling in the series. She wrote: [...] "Mazzara wants to infuse some horror movie suspense back into the show and his intentions are evident in this scene. Even though I personally didn’t find it that tense, I appreciated the effort. It means that the show is trying to expand and become about something bigger." [...] Los Angeles Times Gina McIntyre felt that Rick emulated Justified character Raylan Givens, and Halden commented that Rick was becoming [...] "something of a badass". Halden further praised the conclusion of the episode, calling it the series' best scenes. [...] "This {{is one of the best}} scenes I’ve seen on the show so far, and it does any number of things that The Walking Dead has struggled with in the past," [...] he opined. [...] "The tension builds naturally , the dialogue has actual subtext, and there’s a clear sense of risk here that never <b>pauses</b> <b>to</b> telegraph itself." [...] Meslow affirmed that the scene was an achievement for the writers. [...] "There are characters with new information ," [...] Meslow commented. [...] "There is dialogue with subtext [...] There is intriguing parallel plotting [...] And there's the surprisingly swift, violent dénouement, when Rick guns down Dave and Tony before they can do the same to him. It's a necessary action, given the circumstances, but it also rings in an honest-to-god character change for our hero, who, having dispatched zombie Sophia, seems to have developed a new recognition of the ruthlessness and self-centeredness it may take to survive in this new world order." [...] HitFix writer Alan Sepinwall appreciated James' performance, and opined that the scene was [...] "as suspenseful as any the show has ever done featuring actual monsters".|$|E
2500|$|... "So Naomi returned": The narrator <b>pauses</b> <b>to</b> recapitulate his {{narrative}} of the return, and hence the recapitulatory [...] "so" [...] is, in English, very much to be preferred to the merely additive [...] "and" [...] of the original.|$|E
