Filmed {{on location in}} Utah, it received <b>production</b> <b>incentives</b> from the Utah Film Commission, a state agency providing funding to promote development of the film industry in the western state. The waterfalls scene was filmed at Utah's Bridal Veil Falls. In addition to the towns of Circleville and Kanab, scenes were shot in Kane and Tooele Counties, as well as scenic Bryce Canyon. The Stearman biplane used in the aerial sequences {{was provided by the}} Utah Wing of the Commemorative Air Force. Costume designer Anna K.

25|$|For Benjamin Button, New Orleans, Louisiana and the {{surrounding}} area was chosen as the filming location for the story {{to take advantage of the}} state's <b>production</b> <b>incentives,</b> and shooting was slated to begin in October 2006. By filming in Louisiana and taking advantage of the state's film incentive, the production received $27 million, which was used to finance a significant portion of the film's $167 million budget. Filming of Benjamin Button began on November 6, 2006 in New Orleans. In January 2007, Blanchett joined the shoot. Fincher praised the ease of accessibility to rural and urban sets in New Orleans and said that the recovery from Hurricane Katrina did not serve as an atypical hindrance to production.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the uptake {{potential for a}} wind-diesel <b>production</b> <b>incentive</b> designed specifically for Canadian northern and remote communities. In spite of having over 300 remote communities with extremely high electricity costs, Canada has had little success in developing remote wind energy projects. Most of Canada's large-scale wind power has been developed {{as a direct result}} of a Federal <b>production</b> <b>incentive</b> implemented in 2002. Using this incentive structure as a successful model, this paper explores how an incentive tailored to remote wind power could be deployed. Micro-power simulations were done to demonstrate that the <b>production</b> <b>incentive</b> designed by the Canadian Wind Energy Association would cost on average $ 4. 7 $Cdn million and could be expected to result in 14. 5 Â MW of wind energy projects in remote villages in Canada over a 10 year period, saving 11. 5 $Cdn million dollars in diesel costs annually, displacing 7600 tonnes of CO 2 eq emissions and 9. 6 million litres of diesel fuel every year.

2500|$|States have a {{tendency}} to use vague language and refer to successes in other states when advocating in support of <b>production</b> <b>incentives.</b> [...] Critics maintain that information is selected to present positive results, and that states rely too heavily on perceived successes in other states without adequately considering how available resources within the state will impact their respective economies.|$|E
2500|$|Movie <b>production</b> <b>incentives</b> do not {{necessarily}} result {{in the creation of}} jobs. [...] Rather, the economic impact is that of a transfer of jobs from one location or state to another. [...] Additionally, unless the state in question has a consistent stream of productions, the project-based nature of the film and television industry generates short-term jobs that eventually leave specialized laborers out of work.|$|E
2500|$|Movie <b>production</b> <b>incentives</b> are tax {{benefits}} offered on a state-by-state basis throughout the United States to encourage in-state film production. [...] These incentives came {{about in the}} 1990s {{in response to the}} flight of movie productions to other countries such as Canada. [...] Since then, states have offered increasingly competitive incentives to lure productions away from other states. [...] The structure, type, and size of the incentives vary from state to state. [...] Many include tax credits and exemptions, and other incentive packages include cash grants, fee-free locations, or other perks. [...] Proponents of these programs point to increased economic activity and job creation as justification for the credits. [...] Others argue that the cost of the incentives outweighs the benefits and say that the money goes primarily to out-of-state talent rather than in-state cast and crew members.|$|E
50|$|The Wind Power <b>Production</b> <b>Incentive</b> lost it's {{funding in}} 2006, only 5 years into its planned 15 year lifespan. It was {{ultimately}} replaced {{the following year}} {{in part by a}} newer, more forward thinking program, ecoEnergy for Renewable Power. The Wind Power <b>Production</b> <b>Incentive</b> was created as in immediate response to Canada upholding the Kyoto Protocol. It was one of two programs formed to address the motives of the Kyoto Protocol along with the Renewable Energy Deployment Initiative (REDI), which focused on smaller scale production and renewable heat. During the life of these programs, their shortcomings began to surface. These shortcomings were the product of government officials reacting too hastily to newly evidenced environmental concerns resulting from the burning of fossil fuels for energy.|$|R

2500|$|Also in the 1990s, U.S. states saw the {{opportunity}} to launch their own <b>production</b> <b>incentives</b> {{as an effort to}} capture some of the perceived economic benefits of film and TV production. [...] Louisiana was the first state to do so in 2001, and in 2002 passed legislation to further increase the scope its incentives. [...] Over the next three years Louisiana experienced an increase in film and television productions some of which were nominated for Emmy Awards. [...] The perceived success of Louisiana's incentive program did not go unnoticed by other states, and by 2009 the number of states which offered incentives was 44, up from 5 in 2002. [...] Critics have suggested that the increase in states offering incentives mirrors a race to the bottom or an arms race because states continue to increase the scope of their incentive packages to compete on a national level to not only maximize their individual benefits but also to stay ahead of their competitors.|$|E
