40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. <b>Plastics</b> <b>glazing</b> materials have properties which allow their widespread use in construction, for example as rootlights. However, they are more susceptible than is glass to degradation by weathering, notably the combined effects of ultraviolet light, heat and moisture. Examples of unacceptable durability have been seen in practice, particularly when high operating temperatures occur in sunlight. Artificial weathering tests are used to assess <b>plastics</b> <b>glazing</b> materials in a reasonably short time, two main types being utilised in this study. The applicability of ultra-fast methods of accelerated degradation {{has been shown to}} depend {{on the extent to which}} the mechanisms of degradation simulate practical weathering, since different procedures were found to promote different mechanisms in the materials tested. Misleading information was obtained when the full spectrum of solar UV and much of the visible was not adequately reproduced in the accelerated tests. In particular an established grade of PVC-U performed unexpectedly poorly under fluorescent lamps. Procedures based on xenon arc sources were found to be the most generally applicable because they better reproduce the full solar spectrum range and, hence, the typical effects observed in plastics materials in practice. Several analytical techniques were used to characterise the virgin polymers and to assess the weathered materials. Two commercial grades of each polymer type (poly[vinylchloride], polycarbonate and poly[methylmethacrylate]) were studied, and measured changes explained in terms of initial polymer properties. Profiling of chemical (e. g. carbonyl index measured by photo-acoustic fourier transform infrared), physical (e. g. molecular weight, surface gloss/roughness), optical (e. g. colour, light transmission) and mechanical properties (e. g. impact resistance) as a function of exposure period and environmental conditions enabled degradation rates and mechanisms to be established for each material. In conducting these tests particular attention was given to the control and effects of sample temperature during weathering, and to the wavelength range of the light source used. Poly(vinylchloride) was affected much more by weathering at higher temperatures, and by exposure to short wavelength radiation, than was polycarbonate, with acrylic being the most durable overall. Practical applications of this work are through Standards committees primarily. in particular with plastics rootlights (B/ 542 / 8 and CEN/TCI 28 /SC 9) ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Photosynthethically-active-radiation (PAR) {{has long}} been used by horticultural specialists and crop modelers to {{characterize}} {{the quantity and quality}} of light conducive to plant growth and development. The spatial distribution of light within a double-polyethylene <b>glazed</b> <b>plastic</b> Quonset greenhouse can be quite variable and diffuse throughout the photoperiod, especially at low sun angles in the northern regions of the United States. Previous literature has reported 10 - 35 % increase in canopy lighting using reflective plastics under various plants. A study was undertaken to evaluate the productivity of fourteen strawberry cultivars in a campus Quonset house during the winter months. Modified field of view LiCOR PAR reflectance sensors, full hemispherical PAR incident sensors, and infrared thermocouple sensors (IRT/c) were mounted over gravel and five different color plastic backgrounds. PAR and mulch temperatures were recorded for several months using a wireless LabVIEW-based sensor network within the greenhouse. Weather and the greenhouse environment were also monitored. The use of background reflective plastics or so-called reflective mulches to increase PAR and to capture heat within cap-mats was also studied. It was experimentally found that several of these cultivars will bear significant fruit and could be economically productive during winter...|$|R
40|$|When {{homeowners are}} looking at ways to reduce energy costs, a common misperception is that solar {{applications}} are too expensive to be practical. However, {{as the cost of}} energy from fossil fuels increases, Americans can use solar energy to reduce their household energy costs. According to a 1993 government survey of residential energy use, American households spent an average of 4 percent of their yearly income on energy, which can be much higher for some families. For low-income families, this amount can rise to over 10 percent and become the second largest family expense after rent or the mortgage payment. This factsheet looks at solar additions, retrofits and construction techniques that are low-cost. These systems are described and compared to each other in terms of energy benefits, initial costs and ease of maintenance. Before investing in any of these systems, the most cost-effective home improvement is to caulk, weather strip, increase insulation, and install low-flow shower heads to maximize the energy efficiency of your home. All of the solar systems described below will have the greatest benefit if used in an energy efficient home. General Guidelines for Solar Systems All solar systems have three elements: a collector, heat storage and a distribution system. The collector is often a combination of glass or <b>plastic</b> <b>glazing</b> and an absorptive material to capture the sun’s energy. The collection surface must be facing south but can be up to 30 ° from true south and still be effective, {{depending on the type of}} system. The collected heat must then be distributed where it can be used or stored for later use. Distribution systems can be passive, where they depend on the natural movement of heated air and water, or they can be active, relying on a mechanical method to move heat, such as a pump or fan.

40|$|Homes {{with single}} glazing {{represent}} {{a large majority}} of the New Zealand housing stock. With the recent changes to the NZ Building Code Clause H 1 Energy Efficiency, new homes require higher glazing thermal performance. This will lead to an increased need for cost effective methods to improve window thermal performance in existing single glazed homes without completely replacing the windows, which includes 'secondary' glazing. There are several secondary glazing options available including 'stick-on' <b>plastic</b> <b>glazing</b> as well as aluminium framed glass solutions that are installed inside the existing joinery. Secondary glazing is marketed as a cost effective alternative to insulated glazing units, providing both improved acoustic and thermal insulation to existing windows. There is little information regarding the in-use performance and cost benefits of secondary glazing in New Zealand. This thesis explores the efficacy of the secondary glazing products when installed in existing single pane frames. A guarded hotbox was used to make thermal resistance measurements on a typical single glazed aluminium window with timber reveal liner. Four common secondary glazing systems were retrofitted into the window - (1) thin plastic film; (2) magnetically-attached acrylic sheet; (3) aluminium framed secondary glazing; and (4) aluminium framed low emissivity (low-E) secondary glazing. Models of 'typical' New Zealand homes created in the ALF building thermal simulation programme were used to explore the heating energy savings and cost benefits provided by the different secondary glazing systems in a range of locations. Of the tested products, the low-E secondary glazing produces the largest cost-benefits. At current energy and material costs, secondary glazing was found to not be a financially viable solution in warmer climates such as Auckland. In cooler climates such as Christchurch and Dunedin, secondary glazing was found to be a cost effective retrofit alternative for existing single glazed home...|$|E
40|$|The {{reflectance}} of a {{wide variety}} of materials (<b>plastics,</b> plant leaves, <b>glazed</b> ceramics, human skin, fruits and vegetables, paper, leather, etc.) can be described as a linear combination of specular and diffuse components, and for many applications we can benefit from separating an image in this way. Figures 2 and 3, for example, depict photo-editing and e-cosmetic applications in which visual effects are simulated by independently processing separated diffuse and specular image layers. Similarly, specular/diffuse separation plays an important role for image-based modeling applications in which diffuse (specular-free) texture maps are sought. Separation of the two reflectance components in a single image is an ill-posed problem. In the past its solution has required the manual identification of highlight regions, the use of special acquisition systems (e. g., polarizing filters), or restrictive assumptions about the scene (e. g., untextured surfaces). Recently, we have introduced a method for specular/diffuse separation that overcomes many of these limitations [Mallick et al. 2006], and in this sketch, we build on this work, showing how it can be used for dichromatic editing — processing and recombining the two reflectance components for various visual effects. We present results on high-quality images and videos acquired in the laboratory in addition to images taken from the Internet. Results on the latter demonstrate robustness to low dynamic range, JPEG artifacts, and lack of knowledge of illuminant color. Similar to most existing techniques for specular/diffuse separation, our approach is based on exploiting color differences between specular and diffuse reflections as described by Shafer’s dichromatic model. According to this model, the color of the specular component at each surface point is the same as that of the illuminant (S), while the color of the diffuse component depends on the reflectance of the surface and can change from point to point...|$|R
40|$|The {{interest}} for cereal grain as a fuel is large today. It’s a domestic fuel, renewable, easy to combust and relatively cheap. Energy grain has, as similar fast growing energy crops, higher contents of ash, sulphur and chorine than virgin wood. During combustion of grain, sulphur dioxide (SO 2), which can form sulphuric acid (H 2 SO 4), and hydrochloric acid (HCl) are formed. If the {{moisture in the}} flue gas is allowed to condense, it is very aggressive with, and corrosion damages may appear in a short time, also on stainless steel. Sulphur dioxide and hydrochloric acid also contribute to acidification of the envi-ronment. High content of ash leads to high content of dust (fly ash) in the flue gas, which may cause health problems. The aim of this project has been to demonstrate and evaluate the possibility to avoid cor-rosion problems and to minimise emissions of acid species and dust during combustion of grain {{by the use of}} a flue gas well. A flue gas well means that the flue gases are lead through a flue gas channel in the ground to a well. The flue gas temperature is lowered, moisture is condensed and some of the acid species and the fly ash is also condensed and gathers in the well. The project consisted of an informatory part and of measurements at an existing flue gas well. The informatory part shows that a boiler for energy grain can be connected to a flue gas well after relatively simple modification of the flue gas wells that today are connected to driers heated with oil burners. Right choice of materials is important to avoid corro-sion. As flue gas channels, acid resistant <b>plastic</b> or <b>glazed</b> concrete channels may be used. An ejector fan may be used to avoid corrosion in the fan. The channels should be equipped with a cleaning device because of the high dust content in the flue gas. A pres-sure sensor is recommended to close the burner if the draught disappears, for example if the electricity disappears or if the channel is blocked. The cost to install a flue gas well is estimated to 5000 – 10 000 SEK plus the cost for digging and for the pressure sensor. The cost depends {{of the size of the}} appliance. The acid condensed moisture should be prevented from reaching the surrounding grounds. To this end, at smaller boilers, limestone can be put in the bottom of the well. For a smaller boiler, at least 75 kg/year is estimated theoretically, but more experience is needed to know how much limestone is needed. At larger boilers, large amounts of con-densed moisture must be infiltrated in the ground or taken care of in some other way. Today, there exists today no recommendations or rules from the authorities of how this could be done. When a flue gas well is used, limestone should not be added to the fuel to avoid the risk of hardening of the fly ash. The latent heat from condensation is considerable, and may deteriorate the separation of acid species and fly ash in the flue gas channel and the well. Measurements were performed at an existing flue gas well, both after the boiler and after the well. Results showed a reduction of chlorine with 40 %, of dust with 42 %, and of sulphur with 67 %. Continued evaluations are recommended of larger appliances, from 100 kW to a few MW, especially concerning possible solutions for increased reduction through the use of nozzles providing water droplets, recommendations for taki...|$|R
