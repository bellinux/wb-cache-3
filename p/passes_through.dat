40|$|Considerable {{recent work}} has reached mixed {{conclusions}} about {{whether and how}} globalization affects the inflation-output trade-off and suggests that the ultimate effect of openness on the output-inflation relationship is influenced {{by a variety of}} factors. In this paper, we consider the impact of exchange-rate <b>pass</b> <b>through</b> and how <b>pass</b> <b>through</b> conditions the effect of openness on the sacrifice ratio. We develop a simple theoretical model showing how both the extent of <b>pass</b> <b>through</b> and openness can interact to influence the output-inflation relationship. Next we empirically explore the nature of these two variables and their interaction. Results indicate that greater <b>pass</b> <b>through</b> increases the sacrifice ratio, that there is significant interaction among <b>pass</b> <b>through</b> and openness, and—once the extent of <b>pass</b> <b>through</b> is taken into account alongside other factors that affect the sacrifice ratio, such as central bank independence—openness exerts an empirically ambiguous effect on the sacrifice ratio. exchange-rate <b>pass</b> <b>through,</b> openness, sacrifice ratio, Economics...|$|R
