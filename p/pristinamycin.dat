40|$|International audienceAntibiotics are {{secondary}} metabolites, generally {{produced during}} stationary phase of growth under different nutritional and hydrodynamic stresses. However, the exact mechanisms of the induction of antibiotics production {{are still not}} clearly established. In a previous study, the induction of <b>pristinamycins</b> production by Streptomyces pristinaespiralis as well as product concentrations were correlated with power dissipation per unit of volume (P/V) in shaking flasks. In this study, detailed kinetics of growth, substrate consumption, oxygen transfer rate and <b>pristinamycins</b> production under varying P/V conditions have been obtained and analyzed. Our results showed that higher P/V resulted in a higher concentration of biomass and promoted an earlier nutrient limitation and ultimately an earlier induction of <b>pristinamycins</b> production. The maximal specific growth rate, specific oxygen consumption rate and specific consumption rate of glutamate increased with P/V while influence was less marked with specific consumption rate of glucose, arginine, ammonium ions and phosphate. When oxygen uptake rate (OUR) was limited by free-surface oxygen transfer, <b>pristinamycins</b> production was not detected despite the occurrence of nitrogen and/or phosphate sources limitation. The threshold value for OUR observed was around 25 mmol L(- 1) h(- 1). This suggested that a limitation in nitrogen and/or phosphate alone was not sufficient to induce <b>pristinamycins</b> production by S. pristinaespiralis pr 11.

40|$|International audienceDuring {{bioreactor}} cultures, microorganisms are {{submitted to}} non-optimal {{conditions such as}} nutritional and hydrodynamic stresses which may lead to modifications of the physiological cell response; {{this is especially true}} for filamentous microorganisms like Streptomycetes also subjected to significant morphological changes. In the present work, growth and production of <b>pristinamycins</b> by Streptomyces pristinaespiralis in shaking flasks have been related to power dissipation. The filamentous bacteria were grown in different flask conditions with various total and working volumes and at two agitation rates, to test the influence of power dissipation and gas–liquid mass transfer coefficient on growth and antibiotics production. As a first step, computational fluid dynamics–volume of fluid (CFD–VOF) calculations were shown to be able to predict power dissipations for the various operating conditions in Newtonian flow conditions. Then, in non-Newtonian flow conditions (biomass concentration superior to 14 g L− 1), the rheological model of Sisko was implemented in CFD simulations for the calculation of the fluid viscosity and then of power dissipation. Whereas microbial growth was correlated to kLa, the antibiotics production onset was linked to the volume mean power dissipation. Once a minimal cell concentration of 15 g L− 1 was reached, the concentration of antibiotics was correlated to power dissipation with an optimal range of production, between 5. 5 and 8. 5 kW m− 3. Higher power dissipation entailed a drop in production which could be explained by hydrodynamic cell damages...|$|R

50|$|Treatment of Mycoplasma genitalium infections is {{becoming}} increasingly difficult due to rapidly growing antimicrobial resistance, and diagnosis and treatment is further hampered {{by the fact that}} Mycoplasma genitalium infections are not routinely detected. Studies have demonstrated that a 5-day course of azithromycin has a superior cure rate compared to a single, larger dose. Further, a single dose of azithromycin can lead to the bacteria becoming resistant to azithromycin. Among Swedish patients, doxycycline was shown to be relatively ineffective (with a cure rate of 48% for women and 38% for men); and treatment with a single dose of azithromycin is not prescribed due to it inducing antimicrobial resistance. The five-day treatment with azithromycin showed no development of antimicrobial resistance. Based on these findings, UK doctors are moving to the 5-day azithromycin regimen. Doxycycline is also still used, and moxifloxacin is used as a second-line treatment in case doxycyline and azithromycin are not able to eradicate the infection.

Azithromycin is the most common first-line treatment, but the commonly-used 1 gram single-dose azithromycin treatment can lead to the bacteria commonly developing resistance to azithromycin. An alternative five-day treatment with azithromycin showed no development of antimicrobial resistance. Efficacy of azithromycin against Mycoplasma genitalium has decreased substantially, which is thought to occur through SNPs in the 23S rRNA gene.

50|$|Barber's {{research}} {{was focused on}} the staphylococcus bacterium as well as various aspects of antibiotics, especially development of penicillin-resistant bacteria. Her first scientific paper was published in 1937 and concerned meningitis caused by the Listeria bacterium. In 1947, she published her best-known work, on penicillin resistance in staphylocci, proving that the bacteria were becoming more resistant to the drug over time, using the new technique of phage typing. She found that this was because bacteria with mutations that caused them to synthesize a penicillin-destroying enzyme were selected during treatment with antibiotics, leading to rapid spread of a single antibiotic-resistant strain throughout the hospital. Between 1948 and 1958, her focus shifted to cross-infection by Staphylococcus in hospitals, which she found to be caused by penicilin-resistant bacteria and the nurses became nasal carriers soon after working on the wards. After she returned to BPMS (British Postgraduate Medical School) in 1958, she expanded upon this work, making a clear case for limiting antibiotic use and combining drugs for maximum effect and minimal increases in drug resistance; these studies were carried out at St. Thomas' Hospital. The policies implemented {{as a result of her}} work caused antibiotic resistance observed in the hospital to drop dramatically. After her successful publications, Barber was hired by the Medical Research Council to study semisynthetic penicillin, cephalosporin, fucidin, lincomycin, and <b>pristinamycin.</b> In 1963, she published Antibiotic and Chemotherapy with L. P. Garrod, an encyclopedic work on the characteristics and medical uses of various antibiotics. That same year, Barber was appointed a professor; in 1965 she was elected to the Royal College of Physicians.|$|E

Results One hundred and two MSSA BJIs were assessed in 98 patients [chronic infection, 33. 3 %; and orthopaedic device-related infection (ODI), 67. 6 %]. Surgery was performed in 77. 5 % of total cases, and in all but three ODIs, associated with antibiotic therapy of a median total duration of 29. 2 weeks. <b>Pristinamycin</b> was prescribed as a part of the initial intensive treatment phase (29. 4 %) and/or included in final maintenance therapy (83. 3 %) at a dose of 47. 6 (45. 5 - 52. 6) mg/kg/day for 9. 3 (1. 4 - 20. 4) weeks. AEs occurred in 13. 3 % of patients, consisting of gastrointestinal disorder (76. 9 %) or allergic reaction (23. 1 %), leading to treatment interruption in 11 cases. AEs were related to daily dose (OR, 2. 733 for each 10 additional mg/kg/day; P= 0. 049).
