5000|$|The Sony Ericsson K800i, and its variant, the Sony Ericsson K790, are {{mobile phone}} {{handsets}} manufactured by Sony Ericsson. Launched in July 2006 (for the K800i in the UK market; others may vary), the phones are {{the successor to}} the Sony Ericsson K750i. Both of the phones feature a 3.2-megapixel digital camera complete with a xenon flash, a <b>protective</b> <b>lens</b> <b>cover,</b> and a new [...] "BestPic" [...] bracketing feature, and {{are the first to}} be tagged with the Sony Cyber-shot branding. The new [...] "BestPic" [...] feature takes 9 full quality snapshots of a subject in quick succession, allowing the user to choose the best shots from them. On the entertainment front, the phones have a media player supporting MP3, AAC/AAC+/eAAC+ and WMA music files and 3GP/MPEG-4 video files. The phones also feature a RDS FM radio, and a Memory Stick Micro (M2) slot for expandable solid state memory (up to 16 GB). The K790/K800 models are also the first Sony Ericsson mobile phones to use ATI's Imageon 2192 graphics engine, which delivers a full 3D gaming graphics for Java and full support for its 3.2-megapixel camera. It is the phone used by James Bond in the 2006 Casino Royale film.|$|E
5000|$|Starks {{claimed that}} Nishika {{also made a}} 3 lens camera, {{but there is no}} {{evidence}} that such a camera ever existed outside his article. It is interesting that some of the Nishika [...] "dealers" [...] claimed that the Nimslo had only 3 lenses. The confusion on the part of Michael Starks may stem from the introduction about a year later of the 3 lens Trilogy, which sported a built in electronic flash and motorized film advance, and was originally marketed through a system very similar to the multilevel scheme used by Nishika. The same camera was later renamed to Image Tech 3D 1000 and marketed through more traditional channels. Several other three-lens cameras were released, such as the 3D wizard, 3D magic, 3DFX, and Kalimar, some of which sported more modern features such as built-in electronic flash and motorized film advance, but lacked the auto-exposure features of the Nimslo. The 3D trio featured 3 element coated glass lenses, built in flash, motorized film advance, automatic exposure control, compatibility with DX coded ASA 100, 200 and 400 film, and a built in <b>protective</b> <b>lens</b> <b>cover,</b> making it the closest three-lens equivalent to the Nimslo. These 3 lens cameras gave more pictures per roll of film, 16 [...] for 24 exposure roll rather than the 12 yielded by Nimslo/Nishika and had less ghosting, but also less depth. There were other 4 lens Nimslo clones as well, such as the 3DNext and the Rittai. Like the Nishika, several of these were marketed through multilevel schemes, often in Asian countries, occasionally being the basis of a scam. In 2005 the Canadian firm Snap 3D began selling several 2 lens and 5 lens lenticular cameras made by US technology Ltd in Hong Kong. The 5 lens cameras were particularly odd producing five images that were 29.94 mm high and from 24.75 to 26.33 mm wide, all five images having a different width. These were deluxe cameras, featuring glass lenses, adjustable focus with rangefinder, adjustable shutter speeds 1/125, 1/60, 1/30 sec. and [...] "B", continuously adjustable aperture from f/5.6 to f22 and a spirit level. They also had automatic film loading and motorized film advance. Indeed, these cameras were so far removed from the Nimslo, that it might be stretching things to call them Nimslo clones. Snap 3D no longer sells these cameras and as of May 2012 no longer does lenticular printing due to failure of their machine.|$|E
2500|$|On flight day 7, Danny Olivas and Christer Fuglesang {{performed}} the second spacewalk of the STS-128 mission. Olivas and Fuglesang installed and connected the new Ammonia Tank Assembly (ATA), and also performed two get aheads. The get ahead tasks included installing <b>protective</b> <b>lens</b> <b>covers</b> on the Space Station Remote Manipulator System (SSRMS) End B cameras [...] Once the ATA was installed, the tank was {{integrated into the}} cooling loop. While Olivas and Fuglesang were outside, {{the rest of the}} crew continued on transferring items to and from both the shuttle mid-deck and MPLM.|$|R

40|$|The {{occupational}} {{radiation exposure}} levels and the ocular {{health status of}} a sample of glass-blowers in southern Ontario were evaluated. The form of ocular protection was also assessed. Measurements of radiant emissions from different molten glass materials were carried out. A total of six glassblowing installations, 15 glassblowers and 42 non-glassblowers participated in the study. The spectral transmittances of samples of the <b>protective</b> <b>lenses</b> were obtained. Tonometry, biomicroscopy, ophthalmoscopy, pachometry. Schirmer tear test, endothelial photography were completed on all the volunteering subjects. The glassblowers' ocular findings were compared to those of non-glassblowers. No indication of cataract was observed among this group of glassblowers. Although, a preponderance of grade 2 polymegethism among the glass-blowers (47 % compared to 11 % in non-glassblowers) was found, {{there was no significant}} difference in their ocular health. Variation in the corneal irradiance from occupational exposure was obtained, and in addition, the use of <b>protective</b> <b>lenses</b> was found to be inappropriate. In order to prevent against any long-term chronic pathologic effect, the use of appropriate ocular protection is advised...|$|R

5000|$|Most Nikon F-mount <b>lenses</b> <b>cover</b> the {{standard}} 36×24 mm area of 135 film, while [...] "DX" [...] designated <b>lenses</b> <b>cover</b> the 24×16 mm {{area of the}} Nikon DX format DSLR sensors, {{commonly referred to as}} APS-C format. While [...] "DX" [...] lenses can be physically mounted on any Nikon film or digital SLR that support the [...] "AI" [...] exposure indexing feature (produced from 1977), there will be some degree of vignetting when used on film cameras, depending on zoom setting. All Nikon full-frame [...] "FX" [...] DSLRs have a DX-compatible mode that, by default when a DX-format lens is attached, crops the captured frames to the DX format and adjusts the viewfinder to reflect the smaller capture area. This can be overridden by the user if desired.|$|R

50|$|For digital EOS cameras with APS-C sensors, the EF-S 18-55mm <b>lens</b> <b>covers</b> {{the same}} range. This {{is due to}} crop factor. EF-S lenses only work with Canon 1.6x crop cameras, which results in an angle of view roughly {{equivalent}} {{to that of a}} 29-90mm lens on a 35mm camera.

50|$|In Oculus Artificialis, Zahn's {{comprehensive}} {{description of the}} magic lantern (along with twelve other different lanterns) includes some of these lanterns showing {{for the first time}} <b>lens</b> <b>covers.</b> This was a very important evolution {{in the history of the}} camera, because it meant that the screen could be kept dark while the operator changed the slide.|$|R
50|$|This {{mobile phone}} has a 2.0 {{megapixel}} camera, {{similar to that}} in the Sony Ericsson K550i but without the <b>lens</b> <b>cover.</b> As with previous Sony Ericsson models, it offers an auto-focus feature and uses a photo light instead of a flash. For this model, the focal length of the camera's lens has been reduced from 4.8mm to 3.8mm.|$|R
50|$|There are 2 {{built-in}} cameras. For {{high quality}} imaging, the main 3.2 MP camera provides the above features. Also, there is horizontal user interface for easier camera handling.
