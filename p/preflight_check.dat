50|$|In aviation, a {{preflight}} checklist {{is a list}} {{of tasks}} that should be performed by pilots and aircrew prior to takeoff. Its purpose is to improve flight safety by ensuring that no important tasks are forgotten. Failure to correctly conduct a <b>preflight</b> <b>check</b> using a checklist is a major contributing factor to aircraft accidents.|$|E
50|$|This <b>preflight</b> <b>check</b> was {{developed}} by the Royal Canadian Air Cadets for use on the Schweizer 2-33 training glider. The check is not applicable to other glider types that are more complex that the 2-33 and include features such as flaps. Like all mnemonics this check has become part of aviation culture and folklore.|$|E

50|$|The National Transportation Safety Board {{determines the}} {{probable}} cause(s) of this accident as follows:The improper (reverse) rigging {{of the elevator}} trim cables by company maintenance personnel, and their subsequent failure to discover the misrigging during required post-maintenance checks. Contributing to the accident was the captain’s inadequate post-maintenance <b>preflight</b> <b>check</b> and the flight crew's improper response to the trim problem.|$|E
5000|$|The {{first officer}} {{performed}} the <b>preflight</b> <b>check</b> {{of the aircraft}} about 15 minutes after landing (and before refueling) and found all aerodynamics surfaces clean and dry by visual inspection {{as well as by}} touching the surfaces with the palm of his hand.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the EFB systems, its standards, types and modes of operation. It {{describes}} the design and implementation of an Apple iPad application, intended {{to be used as}} an EFB by the Czech general aviation pilots. The real utilization of such application allows for simplification of the <b>preflight</b> <b>check</b> and safe execution of flight while removing the usual load of paper documents from the cockpit. This is achieved through a SW im- plementation of operationally attractive functions. It could be for example: searching in regulations and pilot's handbooks, acquisition and viewing of meteorological informations and recent changes in air traffic, interactive calculation of important parameters or flight navigation. ...|$|E

25|$|The {{flight to}} Seattle had gone without incident. The landing took place with an {{instrument}} landing system (ILS) approach, with the autopilot coupler being used down to 100 to 60 meters (300–200ft) before a manual completion. The aircraft had three maintenance issues at Seattle, consisting of a non-functioning fast–slow airspeed function, low oil on the number one engine and a non-functioning lavatory light. The final crew arrived at Seattle–Tacoma {{an hour before the}} flight and was given necessary documentation. Flight time was estimated at two hours, 16 minutes. All <b>preflight</b> <b>checks</b> were concluded without discrepancies. The aircraft was de-iced and the altimeters set and cross-checked. The flight departed Seattle at 15:46 Pacific Standard Time (PST), one hour and eleven minutes after schedule. The first officer was designated as pilot flying. The altimeters were recalibrated and the autopilot was used for the climb and cruise.|$|R
50|$|On 3 June 1936 Wever {{flew from}} Berlin to Dresden, {{to give a}} lecture at the Luftkriegsschule Klotzsche to a {{gathering}} of Luftwaffe cadets. When he received {{the news of the}} death of a World War I German hero, he immediately set off for Berlin. On his return journey, the Heinkel He 70 Blitz that he was flying had not been properly examined during <b>preflight</b> <b>checks,</b> and the aileron gust locks were not removed. The aircraft was airborne when the wing dipped, and the Heinkel stalled and went into a horizontal cartwheel (akin to a ground loop, but at low altitude). It crashed and exploded in flames, killing Wever and his flight engineer. That same day, the RLM issued the Bomber A heavy bomber specification and design competition for what would become the Luftwaffe's only wartime heavy bomber in production and frontline service, the Heinkel He 177.|$|R
40|$|Small air {{vehicles}} offer challenging power, weight, {{and volume}} constraints when considering implementation of system health monitoring technologies. In {{order to develop}} a testbed for monitoring the health and integrity of control surface servos and linkages, the Autonomous Aircraft Servo Health Monitoring system has been designed for small Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle (UAV) platforms to detect problematic behavior from servos and the air craft structures they control, This system will serve to verify the structural integrity of an aircraft's servos and linkages and thereby, through early detection of a problematic situation, minimize the chances of an aircraft accident. Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University's rotary-winged UAV has an Airborne Power management unit {{that is responsible for}} regulating, distributing, and monitoring the power supplied to the UAV's avionics. The current sensing technology utilized by the Airborne Power Management system is also the basis for the Servo Health system. The Servo Health system measures the current draw of the servos while the servos are in Motion in order to quantify the servo health. During a <b>preflight</b> <b>check,</b> deviations from a known baseline behavior can be logged and their causes found upon closer inspection of the aircraft. The erratic behavior nay include binding as a result of dirt buildup or backlash caused by looseness in the mechanical linkages. Moreover, the Servo Health system will allow elusive problems to be identified and preventative measures taken to avoid unnecessary hazardous conditions in small autonomous aircraft...|$|E

5000|$|To start, a {{jet engine}} {{requires}} pneumatic {{rotation of the}} turbine, AC-electrical fuel pumps, and an AC-electrical [...] "flash" [...] that ignites the fuel. As the turbine (behind the combustion chamber) is already rotating, the front inlet fans are also rotating. After the ignition, both fans and turbine speed up their rotation. As combustion stabilizes, the engine thereafter only needs the fuel to run at idle. The started engine can now replace the APU when starting up further engines. During flight the APU and its generator are not needed.APUs are also used to run accessories while the engines are shut down. This allows the cabin to be comfortable while the passengers are boarding before the aircraft's engines are started. Electrical power is used to run systems for <b>preflight</b> <b>checks.</b> Some APUs are also connected to a hydraulic pump, allowing crews to operate hydraulic equipment (such as flight controls or flaps) prior to engine start. This function can also be used, on some aircraft, as a backup in flight in case of engine or hydraulic failure.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{describes}} the initial {{results of a}} research activity aimed at developing a high integrity mechatronic system for UAVs primary flight controls able to ensure the necessary flight safety and to enhance the system availability by implementing appropriate prognostic functions. In this system a flight control surface is driven by two parallel rollerscrews, on their turn driven by brushless motors equipped with gearhead and clutch; the motors electric drives are controlled by dual redundant electronic units performing closed loop position control {{as a function of}} the commands received from the flight control computer. Provisions are taken in the motor drives to provide damping in the event of simultaneous failure of both actuators. The electronic units perform control, diagnosis and prognosis of the actuation system and mutually exchange data via a cross channel data link. System prognosis is made by dedicated algorithms processing the control and feedback signals obtained in flight and during <b>preflight</b> <b>checks.</b> As a whole, a smart mechatronic system is obtained providing high integrity control of an aerodynamic surface with dual mechanical link, dual power source and quadruplex control, similarly to a fly-by-wire hydraulic flight control. The paper first addresses the critical design issues associated with the electromechanical actuation of flight control surfaces, briefly reviews alternative solutions proposed for jam-tolerant electromechanical actuators, then outlines configuration, characteristics and performance of the mechatronic actuation system, and presents a summary of its behaviour under normal, degraded, fault developing and failure conditions...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{variability}} in risk tolerance in medicine {{is not well}} understood. Parallels are often drawn between aviation and anaesthesia. The aviation industry is perceived as culturally risk averse, and part of <b>preflight</b> <b>checks</b> involves a decision on whether the flight can operate. This is sometimes termed a go/no-go decision. This questionnaire study was undertaken to explore the equivalent go/no-go decision in anaesthesia. We presented anaesthetists {{with a range of}} situations in which additional risk might be expected and asked them to decide whether they would proceed with the case. Methods: An electronic questionnaire was distributed to anaesthetic colleagues of all grades in one National Health Service Trust. Eleven scenarios, all drawn from critical incident data, were presented. Participants were invited to consider whether they would proceed, how they would modify their anaesthetic technique, and to predict whether a colleague with similar experience would make the same decision. Textual responses were analysed qualitatively. Results: The scenario response rate was 28 %. Consultants {{were significantly more likely to}} proceed than trainees. In no scenario was there absolute agreement over whether to proceed, even in scenarios where national guidelines would suggest a case should be cancelled. Thematic analysis suggested a wide {{variability in}} what anaesthetists consider acceptable or professional behaviour. Conclusions: It is clear that safety decisions cannot be made in isolation and that clinicians must consider operational requirements, such as throughput, when making a go/no-go decision. The level of variability in decision-making was surprising, particularly for scenarios that appeared to go against guidelines...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: To show {{trends in}} {{paragliding}} injuries and derive recommendations for safety precautions for paraglider pilots {{on the basis}} of accident statistics, interviews, questionnaires, medical reports, and current stage of development of paragliding equipment. Methods: All paragliding accidents in Germany have to be reported. Information on 409 accidents was collected and analysed for the period 1997 – 1999. Results: There was a substantial decrease in reported accidents (166 in 1997; 127 in 1998; 116 in 1999). The number of accidents resulting in spinal injuries was 62 in 1997, 42 in 1998, and 38 in 1999. The most common cause of accident was deflation of the glider (32. 5 %), followed by oversteer-ing (13. 9 %), collision with obstacles (12. 0 %), take off errors (10. 3 %), landing errors (13. 7 %), misjudgment of weather conditions (4. 9 %), unsatisfactory <b>preflight</b> <b>checks</b> (4. 9 %), mid-air collisions with other flyers (2. 2 %), accidents during winching (2. 2 %), and defective equipment (0. 5 %). Accidents predominantly occurred in mountain areas. Fewer than 100 flights had been logged for 40 % of injured pilots. In a total of 39 accidents in which emergency parachutes were used, 10 pilots were seriously injured (26 %) and an additional three were killed (8 %). Conclusions: Injuries in paragliding caused by unpredictable situations can be minimised by (a) using safer gliders in the beginner or intermediate category, (b) improving protection systems, such as pad-ded back protection, and (c) improving pilot skills through performance and safety training. Paragliding is a popular extreme sport. In 1965, gliders andsteerable parachutes were developed in America and, in 1977, “parascending ” was described as a less dangerous alternative to hang gliding and parachuting. 1 2 Since 1985, the sport has increased in popularity, first in alpine regions and, {{in the last few years}} because of improved tow winching, also in flat areas. 3 With increasing flight frequency and the first seri...|$|R
40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 27 - 30, 1997 / Riviera Hotel and Convention Center, Las Vegas, NevadaA target missile is {{a unique}} piece of test hardware. This test tool must be highly reliable, low cost and simple and must perform any task that the {{developing}} interceptor missile planners require. The target missile must have ample power and guidance resources to put the target in a specified place in the sky at a desired time. The telemetry and measurement system for the target missile must have the same requirements as its interceptor missile but must be flexible enough to accept new requirements as they are applied to the target and its interceptor. The United States Army has tasked Coleman Aerospace to design and build this type of target missile. This paper describes and analyzes the telemetry and instrumentation system that a Hera target missile carries. This system has been flying {{for the past two}} years, has completed seven out of seven successful test flights and has accomplished all test objectives to date. The telemetry and instrumentation system {{is an integral part of}} the missile self-test system. All <b>preflight</b> <b>checks</b> and flight simulations are made with the on-board three-link telemetry system through a radio frequency (RF) link directly through the missile antenna system to a ground station antenna. If an RF transmission path is not available due to test range restrictions, a fiber-optic cable links the pulse code modulator (PCM) encoder to the receiving ground stations which include the bitsync, decommutator and recorders. With this capability, alternative testing is not limited by RF test range availability. The ground stations include two mobile stations and a factory station for all testing including preflight testing of the missile system prior to flight test launches. These three ground stations are built in a single configuration with additional equipment in the mobile units for use at remote locations. The design, fabrication, testing and utilization of these ground stations are reviewed. The telemetry system is a modification of the classical PCM system and will operate with its interceptor missile at least into the first decade from the year 2000...|$|R
50|$|On January 4, 2002 a {{pilot flying}} a Cessna 152 fatally {{collided}} with mountains near the airfield, destroying the aircraft, {{owned and operated}} by Aeroventure. According to the owner of Aeroventure, the pilot was neither qualified nor endorsed by the school to fly the Cessna 152, and did not possess a license that allowed him to fly solo at night. Eyewitnesses say that the pilot began flying the aircraft without performing any <b>preflight</b> or departure <b>checks.</b> According to the Sonoma County Sheriffs department, the pilot involved in the accident was under criminal investigation. Earlier that day, police had seized his computer for criminal investigation while he was flying a different aircraft. An autopsy report ruled the manner of death to be suicide.|$|R
40|$|Space vehicles, {{such as the}} Space Shuttle, require {{intensive}} {{ground support}} prior to, during, and after each mission. Maintenance is {{a significant part of}} that ground support. All space vehicles require scheduled maintenance to ensure operability and performance. In addition, components of any vehicle are not one-hundred percent reliable so they exhibit random failures. Once detected, a failure initiates unscheduled maintenance on the vehicle. Maintenance decreases the number of missions which can be completed by keeping vehicles out of service so that the time between the completion of one mission and the start of the next is increased. Maintenance also requires resources such as people, facilities, tooling, and spare parts. Assessing the mission capability and resource requirements of any new space vehicle, in addition to performance specification, is necessary to predict the life cycle cost and success of the vehicle. Maintenance and logistics support has been modeled by computer simulation to estimate mission capability and resource requirements for evaluation of proposed space vehicles. The simulation was written with Simulation Language for Alternative Modeling II (SLAM II) for execution on a personal computer. For either one or a fleet of space vehicles, the model simulates the <b>preflight</b> maintenance <b>checks,</b> the mission and return to earth, and the post flight maintenance in preparation to be sent back into space. THe model enables prediction of the number of missions possible and vehicle turn-time (the time between completion of one mission and the start of the next) given estimated values for component reliability and maintainability. The model also facilitates study of the manpower and vehicle requirements for the proposed vehicle to meet its desired mission rate. This is the 3 rd part of a 3 part technical report...|$|R
50|$|Thor {{boosters}} {{launched from}} SLC-10W used an erector system to hoist {{them up to}} the pad. While common on Soviet launch vehicles, this method was unusual in the US space program. Thor 304 had been erected on the pad a few weeks before launch, and during this step, a connecting pin in the erector broke and sent the rocket falling back down to ground level. Launch crews examined the Thor for damage, but could not find any outward indication of it. The booster passed routine <b>preflight</b> systems <b>checks</b> and liftoff took place at 6:22 PM PST on July 14. Shortly after liftoff, the Thor's telemetry system failed, but weather conditions and visibility were excellent, and the booster could be tracked visually for over two minutes. Telemetry from the DMSP satellite indicated that it was operating properly. SECO took place on time, as did the second stage burn. Third stage burn began, and then after about four seconds, all telemetry abruptly ceased. The initial assumption was that the third stage exploded, and initial Air Force press releases about the launch stated such. However, radar tracking showed that the third stage motor continued operating as it drove the DMSP into the Pacific Ocean. The investigation board concluded that connectors in the electrical interface between the second and third stage had been jolted loose by the erector mishap several weeks earlier. After second stage burnout, staging failed to take place due to the misaligned connectors, and the third stage motor thus fired with the spent second stage still attached to it. The force from the third stage motor burning managed to tear the second stage free, but in doing so, it ripped out wiring in the base of the third stage, which shorted out the guidance computer and caused it to direct the stage and spacecraft down into the ocean. Much like the DMSP failure in 1976, the incident was attributed to poor program management.|$|R
