40|$|Subjects saw kinetic depth {{displays}} whose shape (sphere or cylinder) {{was defined}} by luminous dots distributed randomly on the surface or in {{the volume of the}} object. Subjects rated perceived 3 -D depth, rigidity, and coherence. Despite individual differences, all 3 ratings increased with the number of dots. Dots in the volume yielded ratings equal to or greater than surface dots. Each rating varied with 3 of 4 factors (shape, distribution, numerosity, and perspective), but the ratings either between trials or between conditions were often uncorrelated. Object shape affected rigidity but not depth ratings. Veridically perceived <b>polar</b> <b>displays</b> had slightly lower rigidity but higher depth ratings than parallel projection <b>displays.</b> (Reversed <b>polar</b> <b>displays</b> were always grossly nonrigid.) The interaction of ratings and stimulus parameters requires theories and experiments in which different KDE ratings are not treated interchangeably. When a two-dimensional (2 -D) projected image corre-sponds to a three-dimensional (3 -D) object that is rotating, viewers frequently perceive an object with depth.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} tidally induced asymmetric disc structure on accretion onto the white dwarf in intermediate polars. Using numerical simulation, we show {{that it is possible}} for tidally induced spiral waves to propagate sufficiently far into the disc of an intermediate polar that accretion onto the central white dwarf could be modulated as a result. We suggest that accretion from the resulting asymmetric inner disc may contribute to the observed X-ray and optical periodicities in the light curves of these systems. In contrast to the stream-fed accretion model for these periodicities, the tidal picture predicts that modulation can exist even for systems with weaker magnetic fields where the magnetospheric radius is smaller than the radius of periastron of the mass transfer stream. We also predict that additional periodic components should exist in the emission from low mass ratio intermediate <b>polars</b> <b>displaying</b> superhumps.

The optical light curves of all three <b>polars</b> <b>displayed</b> large magnitude changes during our observations.

40|$|The work {{presented}} in this thesis focuses on the effect on structure and properties of the rhombohedral (R) perovskite system, Bi(Ti 3 / 8 Fe 2 / 8 Mg 3 / 8) O 3 (BTFM), when solid solutions with CaTiO 3 (CTO) are made. Bismuth-based perovskites are established as candidates to replace the piezoelectric material Pb(Zr 1 -xTix) O 3 as they have high Curie and depolarisation temperatures which are necessary for applications and are not toxic. BTFM has a Curie temperature of ~ 730 °C; however it shows poor electromechanical properties. In Chapter 3 of this thesis is shown that a range of xBTFM-(1 -x) CTO compositions were synthesised successfully in the range 0. 6 ≤ x ≤ 1 obtaining the perovskite structure. They were proved to be polar by second harmonic generation measurements. Compositions in the range 0. 6 ≤ x ≤ 0. 825 adopt an orthorhombic (O) structure. For x ≥ 0. 95 the R structure crystallises in the polar space group R 3 c with polarisation along [111]p as BTFM while in the range 0. 837 ≤ x ≤ 0. 925 a mixed phase, O + R, region is achieved. In Chapter 4 of this thesis, {{the study of the}} space group assignment for the O phase based on the reflection conditions and microscopy studies is shown. By using the Maximum Entrophy Method / Rietveld method a six sites disordered model for the A-site has been built based on the charge density distribution using synchrotron X-ray diffraction (SXRD) data. A joint refinement using SXRD and neutron data was performed on composition x = 0. 8 and the structure of this new polar phase crystallising in Pna 21 with polarisation along [001]p has been solved. However, the O phase despite of being <b>polar</b> <b>displays</b> poor physical properties being the maximum piezoelectric coefficient obtained of 2. 8 pC/N for x = 0. 835. In Chapter 5, preliminary structural analysis outcomes for the mixed phase, O + R, compositions with different polarisation directions along [001]p and [111]p respectively are shown along with their physical properties measurements results. By making solid solutions of BTFM and CTO, a maximum piezoelectric coefficient of 53 pC/N has been achieved for x = 0. 835. This value is about two orders of magnitude greater than for BTFM (0. 6 pC/N). A preliminary phase diagram of xBTFM-(1 -x) CTO materials versus temperature has been built...|$|R
40|$|Aims: We {{investigate}} the physical {{nature of the}} X-ray emitting source 1 RXS J 165443. 5 - 191620 through optical photometry and time-resolved spectroscopy. Methods: Optical photometry is obtained {{from a variety of}} telescopes all over the world spanning about 27 days. Additionally, time-resolved spectroscopy is obtained from the MDM observatory. Results: The optical photometry clearly displays modulations consistent with those observed in magnetic cataclysmic variables: a low-frequency signal interpreted as the orbital period, a high-frequency signal interpreted as the white dwarf spin period, and an orbital sideband modulation. Our findings and interpretations are further confirmed through optical, time-resolved, spectroscopy that displays H-alpha radial velocity shifts modulated on the binary orbital period. Conclusion: We confirm the true nature of 1 RXS J 165443. 5 - 191620 as an intermediate polar with a spin period of 546 seconds and an orbital period of 3. 7 hours.

40|$|Self-organisation {{is one of}} {{the main}} {{features}} of long chain compounds such lipids and surfactant molecules from which most of the colloidal particles are constituted or stabilized. The structures developed depend on the interactions of these molecules with water (lyotropism). The weakly polar lipids such as triglycerides self-organise in crystalline or liquid-crystalline layers displaying thermotropism [1 - 3]. The molecules bearing both long-chain(s) and polar or ionised group(s) such as phospholipids or surfactants self pack in supramolecular multidimensional structures or aggregates like micelles, vesicles emulsions, [4 - 6] of complex topology. This class of <b>polar</b> molecules <b>displays</b> both lyotropic and thermotropic behaviours.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{interaction}} of spin-labeled lipids with â-barrel transmembrane proteins {{has been studied}} by the electron spin resonance (ESR) methods developed for R-helical integral proteins. The outer membrane protein OmpA and the ferrichrome-iron receptor FhuA from the outer membrane of Escherichia coli were reconstituted in bilayers of dimyristoylphosphatidylglycerol. The ESR spectra from phosphatidyl-glycerol spin labeled on the 14 -C atom of the sn- 2 chain contain a second component from motionally restricted lipids contacting the intramembranous surface of the â-barrel, {{in addition to that}} from the fluid bilayer lipids. The stoichiometry of motionally restricted lipids, 11 and 32 lipids/monomer for OmpA and FhuA, respectively, is constant irrespective of the total lipid/protein ratio. It is proportional to the number of transmembrane â-strands, eight for OmpA and 22 for FhuA, and correlates reasonably well with the intramembranous perimeter of the protein. Spin-labeled lipids with different <b>polar</b> headgroups <b>display</b> a differential selectivity of interaction with the two proteins. The more pronounced pattern of lipid selectivity for FhuA than for OmpA correlates with the preponderance of positively charged residues facing the lipids in the extensions of the â-sheet and shorter interconnecting loops on the extracellular side of FhuA.
