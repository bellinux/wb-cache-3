5|$|On Earth, nickel occurs {{most often}} in {{combination}} with sulfur and iron in <b>pentlandite,</b> with sulfur in millerite, with arsenic in the mineral nickeline, and with arsenic and sulfur in nickel galena. Nickel is commonly found in iron meteorites as the alloys kamacite and taenite.|$|E
5|$|As the 74th most {{abundant}} element in Earth's crust, ruthenium is relatively rare, found in about 100parts per trillion. This element is generally found in ores {{with the other}} platinum group metals in the Ural Mountains and in North and South America. Small but commercially important quantities are also found in <b>pentlandite</b> extracted from Sudbury, Ontario, Canada, and in pyroxenite deposits in South Africa. The native form of ruthenium is a very rare mineral (Ir replaces part of Ru in its structure).|$|E
5|$|Metallic or native iron {{is rarely}} {{found on the}} surface of the Earth because it tends to oxidize, but its oxides are {{pervasive}} and represent the primary ores. While it makes up about 5% of the Earth's crust, both the Earth's inner and outer core are believed to consist largely of an iron-nickel alloy constituting 35% of the mass of the Earth as a whole. Iron is consequently the most abundant element on Earth, but only the fourth most abundant element in the Earth's crust, after oxygen, silicon, and aluminium. Most of the iron in the crust is found combined with oxygen as iron oxide minerals such as hematite (Fe2O3), magnetite (Fe3O4), and siderite (FeCO3). Many igneous rocks also contain the sulfide minerals pyrrhotite and <b>pentlandite.</b>|$|E
5|$|Use {{of nickel}} (as a natural {{meteoric}} nickel–iron alloy) has been traced {{as far back}} as 3500 BCE. Nickel was first isolated and classified as a chemical element in 1751 by Axel Fredrik Cronstedt, who initially mistook the ore for a copper mineral, in the cobalt mines of Los, Hälsingland, Sweden. The element's name comes from a mischievous sprite of German miner mythology, Nickel (similar to Old Nick), that personified the fact that copper-nickel ores resisted refinement into copper. An economically important source of nickel is the iron ore limonite, which often contains 1–2% nickel. Nickel's other important ore minerals include garnierite, and <b>pentlandite.</b> Major production sites include the Sudbury region in Canada (which is thought to be of meteoric origin), New Caledonia in the Pacific, and Norilsk in Russia.|$|E
25|$|Sudbury's <b>pentlandite,</b> pyrite and {{pyrrhotite}} ores contain profitable {{amounts of}} many elements—primarily nickel and copper, but also platinum, palladium and other valuable metals.|$|E
25|$|While sulfide {{minerals}} do {{not change}} their mineralogy during metamorphism as silicates do, the yield strength of the nickel sulfide <b>pentlandite,</b> and copper sulfide chalcopyrite is {{less than that of}} pyrrhotite and pyrite, resulting in a potential to segregate the sulfides mechanically throughout a shear zone.|$|E
25|$|Ultramafic {{mineralogy}} {{is especially}} susceptible to retrograde metamorphism, especially when water is present. Few komatiite sequences display even pristine metamorphic assembages, with most metamorphic olivine replaced by serpentine, anthophyllite, talc or chlorite. Pyroxene tends to retrogress to actinolite-cummingtonite or chlorite. Chromite may hydrothermally alter to stichtite, and <b>pentlandite</b> may retrogress into millerite or heazlewoodite.|$|E
25|$|A {{variety of}} iron, copper, arsenic and zinc ores such as arsenopyrite, pyrrhotite, pyrite and {{chalcopyrite}} with sphalerite, are present as small veins and in quartz veins throughout north-trending shear zones that cut the iron-rich tholeiitic basalts of the Arsenic Lake Formation. Dikes composed of quartz-feldspar porphyry run parallel to or lie within the shear zones and are {{cut by the}} mineralization. Chalcopyrite occupies later fractures which intersect massive arsenopyrite. Sparse quartz veins normally exist in or adjacent to the arsenopyrite-rich zones. Several northeast-trending deformation zones intersect pyroxenite of a mafic sill in northwest Strathy Township. Within these high-strain zones quartz veins normally contain chalcopyrite, pyrite, pyrrhotite with exsolved <b>pentlandite</b> and traces of sphalerite and galena. Chalcopyrite, pyrrhotite and <b>pentlandite</b> are deposited throughout shear zones which lack quartz veining. These zones are not known to contain large amounts of gold, although investigations are incomplete. It is also unknown if platinum group metals (which include platinum, palladium, rhodium, iridium, osmium and ruthenium) exist in these zones because no searches for platinum group elements have been undertaken.|$|E
2500|$|Gold {{and copper}} values occupy a northeast-trending iron {{formation}} within the Net Lake-Vermilion Lake Deformation Zone. This mineralization is only known to exist southeast of Cooke Lake and immediately south of Net Lake. A unit of chert, magnetite and pyrrhotite outcrops along the southwest shore of Net Lake at Temagami North. Pyrrhotite, {{the most common}} sulfide mineral, occurs as small veins and disseminations. Small amounts of pyrite, sphalerite and exsolved <b>pentlandite</b> and chalcopyrite are present with the pyrrhotite. The main exposure lies immediately south of the Kanichee Mine Road, which branches off Highway 11. Minor gold and copper values constitute this zone. This sulfide-bearing unit is located within felsic volcanic rocks of the Older Volcanic Complex and is capped by large, dark green, iron-rich tholeiitic basalts of the Arsenic Lake Formation. It has been interpreted that the sulfide zone represents a volcanogenic massive sulfide ore deposit based {{on the structure of}} the sulfide zone and the associated rock types. These ore deposits are created by volcanic-associated hydrothermal events in submarine environments. However, there is evidence that the sulfide mineralization does not have a volcanogenic origin. An unusual feature of this sulfide deposit is the large degree of magnetite at the actual showing. Studies have shown that the chert-magnetite iron formations in the West and North Pits of Sherman Mine extend under and along a series of small lakes from Vermillion Lake to Net Lake. These iron formations are located at roughly the same stratigraphic position as the magnetite-bearing iron formation on the southwestern shore of Net Lake. A northwest-trending cross fault is accompanied by drag folding of a chert-magnetite iron formation unit southeast of Cooke Lake. Also exposed in this area is a dark yellow [...] wide quartz vein composed of pyrite that cross cuts the iron formation at the northeastern end. This west-northwest trending quartz vein is about [...] long.|$|E

50|$|Millerite is {{a common}} {{metamorphic}} mineral replacing <b>pentlandite</b> within serpentinite ultramafics. It is formed in this way by removal of sulfur from <b>pentlandite</b> or other nickeliferous sulfide minerals during metamorphism or metasomatism.|$|E
50|$|The komatiite locally {{is highly}} {{magnesian}} and favours talc-magnesite assemblages, having been intensely talc-carbonated. Accessory minerals {{observed in the}} ore body include nickeline, nickeliferous chalcopyrite, cuprous <b>pentlandite,</b> arsenian <b>pentlandite,</b> violarite and arsenopyrite.|$|E
50|$|<b>Pentlandite</b> is an iron-nickel sulfide, (Fe,Ni)9S8. <b>Pentlandite</b> has {{a narrow}} {{variation}} range in Ni:Fe {{but it is}} usually described as having a Ni:Fe of 1:1. It also contains minor cobalt, usually at low levels as a fraction of weight.|$|E
5000|$|Millerite, when {{found in}} enough concentration, {{is a very}} {{important}} ore of nickel because, for its mass as a sulfide mineral, it contains a higher percentage of nickel than <b>pentlandite.</b> This means that, for every percent of millerite, an ore contains more nickel than an equivalent percentage of <b>pentlandite</b> sulfide.|$|E
50|$|<b>Pentlandite</b> is an {{effective}} electrolytic catalyst of hydrogen from water.|$|E
50|$|It occurs {{associated}} with kamacite, taenite, schreibersite, cohenite, <b>pentlandite</b> and magnetite.|$|E
50|$|Millerite {{is found}} as a {{metamorphic}} replacement of <b>pentlandite</b> within the Silver Swan nickel deposit, Western Australia, {{and throughout the}} many ultramafic serpentinite bodies of the Yilgarn Craton, Western Australia, generally as a replacement of metamorphosed <b>pentlandite.</b> There is one known occurrence of millerite in South Africa, near Pafuri in the Transvaal. The deposit has never been commercially mined.|$|E

50|$|Nickeline {{is formed}} by {{hydrothermal}} modification of ultramafic rocks and associated ore deposits, {{and may be}} formed by replacement of nickel-copper bearing sulfides (replacing <b>pentlandite,</b> and in association with copper arsenic sulfides), or via metasomatism of sulfide-free ultramafic rocks, where metasomatic fluids introduce sulfur, carbonate, and arsenic. This typically results in mineral assemblaged including millerite, heazelwoodite and metamorphic pentlandite-pyrite via sulfidation and associated arsenopyrite-nickeline-breithauptite. Associated minerals include: arsenopyrite, barite, silver, cobaltite, pyrrhotite, <b>pentlandite,</b> chalcopyrite, breithauptite and maucherite. Nickeline alters to annabergite (a coating of green nickel arsenate) on exposure to moist air.|$|E
50|$|Pyrrhotite is {{a rather}} common trace {{constituent}} of mafic igneous rocks especially norites. It occurs as segregation deposits in layered intrusions associated with <b>pentlandite,</b> chalcopyrite and other sulfides. It is an important constituent of the Sudbury intrusion where it occurs in masses associated with copper and nickel mineralisation. It also occurs in pegmatites and in contact metamorphic zones. Pyrrhotite is often accompanied by pyrite, marcasite and magnetite. Pyrrhotite does not have specific applications. It is mined primarily because it is associated with <b>pentlandite,</b> sulfide mineral that can contain significant amounts of nickel and cobalt.|$|E
50|$|It is {{a member}} of the {{cobaltite}} group and forms a series with willyamite ((Co,Ni)SbS). It occurs with nickeline, gersdorffite, <b>pentlandite,</b> chalcopyrite, pyrrhotite, galena, tetrahedrite and dyscrasite in hydrothermal deposits.|$|E
