40|$|A rainfall-induced {{debris flow}} warning is {{implemented}} employing real-time rain gauge The pre-warning {{for the time}} of landslide triggering derives the threshold or critical rainfall from historical events involving regional rainfall patterns and geological conditions. In cases of debris flow, the time taken cumulative runoff, yield abundant water for debris triggering, is an important index needs monitoring. In gathered historical cases, rainfall time history data from the nearest rain gauge stations to debris-flow sites connected to debris. ow are used to define relationships between the rainfall intensity and duration. The effects by which the regional patterns (antecedent rainfall, duration, intensity, cumulative rainfall) and geological settings combine together to trigger a debris-flow are analyzed for real-time monitoring. The analyses focused on 61 historical hazard events with the timing of debris flow initiation and rainfall duration to burst debris-flow characteristics recorded. A combination of averaged rainfall intensity and duration is a more practical index for debris-flow monitoring than critical or threshold rainfall intensity. Because, the outburst timing of debris flows correlates closely to the <b>peak</b> <b>hourly</b> rainfall and the forecasting of <b>peak</b> <b>hourly</b> rainfall reached in a meteorological event could be a valuable index for real-time debris-flow warning...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} two {{new strategies}} for controlling air economizers. The model-based control strategy uses {{a model to}} estimate the load on the cooling coil for 100 % outdoor air and minimum outdoor air and transitions dampers between these two positions to minimize the load. The optimization-based control strategy uses a cooling coil model and a one-dimensional optimization routine to determine the fraction of outdoor air that minimizes the coil load. A coil model based on the contact-mixture analogy was adopted for this study and validated with experimental data. Simulations were {{used to compare the}} new economizer control strategies with traditional strategies. Simulations evaluated the sensitivity of the annual and peak cooling loads to outdoor air and return air sensor errors and climatic conditions. Incorrect control decisions stemming from sensor errors reduce the achievable energy savings and lead to higher <b>peak</b> <b>hourly</b> loads. For a scenario representative of poorly maintained sensors, the lowest annual coil loads of the economizer strategies investigated are 3. 0 - 40. 3 % higher than those achieved for the ideal scenario of optimization-based control and ideal sensors (i. e., no sensor errors), and the lowest <b>peak</b> <b>hourly</b> loads for those cases are 6. 8 - 84. 1 % higher than those for the ideal scenario.

40|$|Most {{hydrological}} models use continuous daily precipitation {{and potential}} evapotranspiration for streamflow estimation. With the projected increase in mean surface temperature, hydrological processes {{are set to}} intensify irrespective of the underlying changes to the mean precipitation. The effect {{of an increase in}} rainfall intensity on the long-term water balance is, however, not adequately accounted for in the commonly used hydrological models. This study follows from a previous comparative analysis of a non-stationary daily series of stream flow of a forested watershed (River Rimbaud) in the French Alps (area = 1. 478 km 2) (1966 – 2006). Non-stationarity in the recorded stream flow occurred {{as a result of a}} severe wild fire in 1990. Two daily models (AWBM and SimHyd) were initially calibrated for each of three distinct phases in relation to the well documented land disturbance. At the daily and monthly time scales, both models performed satisfactorily with the Nash–Sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency (NSE) varying from 0. 77 to 0. 92. When aggregated to the annual time scale, both models underestimated the flow by about 22 % with a reduced NSE at about 0. 71. Exploratory data analysis was undertaken to relate daily <b>peak</b> <b>hourly</b> rainfall intensity to the discrepancy between the observed and modelled daily runoff amount. Preliminary results show that the effect of <b>peak</b> <b>hourly</b> rainfall intensity on runoff prediction is insignificant, and model performance is unlikely to improve when peak daily precipitation is included. Trend analysis indicated that the large decrease of precipitation when daily precipitation amount exceeded 10 – 20 mm may have contributed greatly to the decrease in stream flow of this forested watershed.
