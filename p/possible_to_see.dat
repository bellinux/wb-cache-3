5|$|Hartshead Pike is a stone tower {{on top of}} Hartshead Hill {{overlooking}} Ashton and Oldham. The current {{building was}} constructed in 1863 {{although there has been}} a building on the site since at least the mid-18th century, although the original purpose is obscure. The pike may have been the site of a beacon in the late 16th century. It has a visitor centre and {{from the top of the}} hill it is <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the Jodrell Bank Observatory in Cheshire, the Welsh hills, and the Holme Moss transmitter in West Yorkshire.|$|E
5|$|In the Local Supercluster it is <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> star clusters, {{and current}} telescopes could in {{principle}} observe faint individual {{stars in the}} Local Group (see Cepheids). However, outside the Local Supercluster of galaxies, neither individual stars nor clusters of stars have been observed. The only exception is a faint image of a large star cluster containing {{hundreds of thousands of}} stars located at a distance of one billion light years—ten times further than the most distant star cluster previously observed.|$|E

5|$|Entrance to {{national}} park is available by boat in Wijdefjorden from the north, or over land from Billefjorden and Dicksonfjorden from the south. During winter, {{the area is}} accessible from Longyearbyen, either by snowmobile or by ski. There are several older trapper cabins in the park, {{and some of these}} are lent to residents of Longyearbyen. Except for Einsteinvatnet, a lake with Arctic char, there are few destinations within the park, although the park {{can be used as a}} basis for other destinations. This includes trips to Perriertoppen, Svalbard's second-highest peak, and the glacier Åsgårdsfonna. Because of the shape of the park, there is little good hiking within the park, except for walking along the beaches on either side of the fjord. It is <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the entire national park from Mittag-Lefflerbreen, which can be hiked to from Pyramiden.|$|E
5|$|Phase-contrast X-ray imaging (Fig.26) {{refers to}} a variety of {{techniques}} that use phase information of a coherent x-ray beam to image soft tissues. (For an elementary discussion, see Phase-contrast x-ray imaging (introduction). For a more in-depth review, see Phase-contrast X-ray imaging.) It has become an important method for visualizing cellular and histological structures {{in a wide range of}} biological and medical studies. There are several technologies being used for x-ray phase-contrast imaging, all utilizing different principles to convert phase variations in the x-rays emerging from an object into intensity variations. These include propagation-based phase contrast, talbot interferometry, moiré-based far-field interferometry, refraction-enhanced imaging, and x-ray interferometry. These methods provide higher contrast compared to normal absorption-contrast x-ray imaging, making it <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> smaller details. A disadvantage is that these methods require more sophisticated equipment, such as synchrotron or microfocus x-ray sources, x-ray optics, or high resolution x-ray detectors.|$|E
5|$|The Jardin des Mont du Récollets {{provides}} expansive views {{over the}} plains of Flanders and beyond; {{on a clear day}} it is <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the North Sea, the English coast and the belfry of Bruges. It used to be said that from Cassel one could see five kingdoms: France, Belgium, Holland, England and Heaven. The garden also hosts an equestrian statue of Marshal Foch and the Monument des Trois Batailles, commemorating the battles of 1071, 1328 and 1677. Just below the gardens is the Porte du Château of 1621, the last substantial part of the old castle to remain standing. The city walls no longer stand but footpaths and streets still trace their former course.|$|E

25|$|Using a light microscope, it is {{just barely}} <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> tiny green granules—which were named grana. With {{electron}} microscopy, it became <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the thylakoid system in more detail, revealing it to consist of stacks of flat thylakoids which made up the grana, and long interconnecting stromal thylakoids which linked different grana.|$|E

50|$|Ramshorn snails {{lay eggs}} in globules, {{which tend to}} be {{brownish}} in color. The globules contain about a dozen or so eggs, though it can vary. The globules are translucent, so it is <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> visually <b>see</b> the new snails develop in size. The newborn snails are clearish white.|$|R

25|$|The {{polytene}} banding of the 'picture wing' group, the best-studied {{group of}} Hawaiian drosophilids, enabled Carson {{to work out}} the evolutionary tree long before genome analysis was practicable.

25|$|Connections between {{languages}} can {{be traced}} because the processes that change languages are not random, but follow strict patterns. Especially sound shifts, the changing of vowels and consonants, are important, although grammar (especially morphology) and the lexicon (vocabulary) may also be significant. Historical-comparative linguistics thus makes it <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> great similarities between languages which at first sight might seem very different.|$|E
