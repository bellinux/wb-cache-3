5000|$|<b>Prostrate</b> <b>pigweed</b> is {{a common}} name for several plants and may refer to: ...|$|E
50|$|Common names include common tumbleweed, tumble pigweed, tumbleweed, <b>prostrate</b> <b>pigweed,</b> pigweed amaranth, white amaranth, {{and white}} pigweed.|$|E
40|$|Preplant {{incorporated}} and/or preemergence herbicide treatments including metolachlor (Dual®), EPTC with safener (Eradicane®), cyanazine (Bladex®), pendimethalin (Prowl®), and tank-mix combinations provided good (88 %) to excellent (> 98 %) {{weed control}} of <b>prostrate</b> and tumble <b>pigweeds</b> and purslane in sweet corn...|$|R
50|$|Polygonum aviculare or common {{knotgrass}} is a plant {{related to}} buckwheat and dock. It is also called <b>prostrate</b> knotweed, birdweed, <b>pigweed</b> and lowgrass. It is an annual found in fields and wasteland, with white flowers from June to October. It is widespread across {{many countries in}} temperate regions, apparently native to Eurasia and North America, naturalized in temperate parts of the Southern Hemisphere.|$|R
40|$|Preemergence {{herbicide}} treatments metolachlor (Dual®) and pendimethalin (Prowl®) gave {{better than}} acceptable weed control (> 85 %) of <b>prostrate</b> and tumble <b>pigweeds,</b> puncturevine, common purslane, and groundcherry in cantaloupes. Preplant incorporated treatments provided less than adequate control of pigweeds and groundcherry. Bentazon (Basagran®) applied postemergence gave good control of pigweeds but groundcherry control was marginal. Napropamide (Devrinol®), trifluralin (Treflan®), and DCPA (Dacthal (D) caused cantaloupe stand reduction and injury. Bensulide (Prefar®) and Basagran® were safe when applied on cantaloupes...|$|R
5000|$|Amaranthus blitoides, {{commonly}} called mat amaranth, <b>prostrate</b> <b>pigweed,</b> procumbent pigweed, prostrate amaranth, or matweed, is a glabrous annual plants species. It usually grows up to 0.6 m, {{though it may}} grow up to 1 m (3 feet). It flowers in the summer to fall.|$|E
40|$|Callisto at 0. 24 lb AI/A applied PREE gave {{a similar}} {{level of control}} of <b>prostrate</b> <b>pigweed</b> as did Dual Magnum, Outlook, and Prowl. POST {{applications}} of Callisto at 0. 188 lb AI/A were equivalent to the higher rate of 0. 24 lb AI/A. Callisto, Distinct, and Clarity provided excellent POST control of pigweed. Callisto applied POST {{was the same as}} PREE followed by POST sequentially. Aim provided marginally acceptable control of pigweed...|$|E
40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} different management on composition, density and distribution patterns of <b>prostrate</b> <b>pigweed</b> and red root pigweed seed banks, an experiment was conducted in a grain corn field at the Agricultural Research Station, Ferdowsi University of Mashhad in 2006 growing season. The treatments consisted of application of: 25 kg/ha nitrogen fertilizer {{at the time of}} corn planting with 2, 4 -D+MCPA herbicide(533 g. ai. /ha 2. 4. D+ 467 g. ai. /ha MCPA), 25 kg/ha nitrogen fertilizer at the time of corn planting without 2, 4 -D+MCPA, 25 kg/ha nitrogen fertilizer at the time of corn planting and six-leaf stage with 2, 4 -D+MCPA, 25 kg/ha nitrogen fertilizer at the time of corn planting and six-leaf stage without 2, 4 -D+MCPA, 120 kg/ha nitrogen fertilizer at the time of corn planting with 2, 4 -D+MCPA, 120 kg/ha nitrogen fertilizer at the time of corn planting without 2, 4 -D+MCPA, 120 kg/ha nitrogen fertilizer at the time of corn planting and six-leaf stage with 2, 4 -D+MCPA and 120 kg/ha nitrogen fertilizer at the time of corn planting and six-leaf stage without 2, 4 -D+MCPA. The percentage of Amaranthus blitoides seed free spaces was zero throughout the season. Application of herbicide was useful in reducing A. blitoides seed bank. Semivariograms of seeds fitted with spherical and exponential models. Semivariogram analysis in the levels of treatments indicated a range of influence of 1. 17 m to 50. 21 m for <b>prostrate</b> <b>pigweed</b> and 1. 15 m to 44. 98 m for red root pigweed. The highest spatial correlation for <b>prostrate</b> <b>pigweed</b> was 1. 91 % and the lowest one was 32. 37 %. Weed seed bank patches was obvious in two species maps. The nitrogen fertilizer have not a strong effect on reducing the amount of seed bank but the application of herbicide was a useful factor to reducing weed seed bank...|$|E
40|$|At 4 {{weeks after}} {{treatment}} (WAT), all preemergence (PREE) treatments were completely safe on cantaloupes. At 1 WAT of postemergence (POST) applications, marginally acceptable melon injury (11 to 19 %) was observed. At 6 WAT, crop injury increased significantly for both halosulfuron and bentazon. Halosulfuron (POST) following bensulide (PREE) caused minimal crop injury. The pigweeds were marginally controlled when POST treatments followed PREE herbicides. Tumble pigweed (Amaranthus albus) {{was more difficult}} to control than <b>prostrate</b> <b>pigweed</b> (A. blitoides). Halosulfuron gave good control of nutsedge (Cyperus rotundus) at 6 WAT...|$|E
40|$|Several pigweed {{species are}} found in the Great Plains. Pigweeds {{commonly}} reduce crop yields and interfere with harvest. One means of controlling these weeds is through the use of herbicides. Recent research indicates that some pigweed species respond differently to various herbicides; therefore, proper identification is needed for good control. This extension contains a generalized distribution map; photographs of seeds, seedling, and mature plants; and text describing other identifying features for each pigweed species. The species are grouped with others that have similar shape and form. The pigweed species listed in this publication are: redroot pigweed, smooth pigweed, Powell amaranth, spiny amaranth, tumble pigweed, <b>prostrate</b> <b>pigweed,</b> common waterhemp, tall waterhemp, and Palmer amaranth...|$|E
40|$|Sandea at 0. 03 lb AI/A {{combined}} with rimsulfuron at 0. 02 lb AI/A gave exceptionally good control of <b>prostrate</b> <b>pigweed</b> and lambsquarters at 98 % and 96 %, respectively, when applied postemergence (POST) in cantaloupes. Sandea applied POST in a tank-mix with increasing rates of rimsulfuron showed marginally acceptable to unacceptable crop injury. All POST applications of Sandea following preemergence (PREE) herbicides or applied alone provided 90 % or better control of lambsquarters. Sandea and Strategy gave unacceptable control of pigweed and lambsquarters at 60 - 70 % {{relative to the}} standard, Prefar. Sandea applied alone POST was less effective against pigweed than lambsquarters. A treatment of a PREE herbicide followed by Sandea was not as efficacious as the Sandea plus rimsulfuron tank-mix applied POST to control both pigweed and lambsquarters...|$|E
40|$|Oxyfluorfen (Goal®) {{herbicide}} at 0. 125 to 0. 25 lb. a. i. /A applied postemergence (POST) to onions at the 3 -leaf {{stage of}} growth effectively controlled London rocket, yellow sweetclover, and <b>prostrate</b> <b>pigweed</b> with marginal injury to onions. Earlier POST applications on 1 - and 2 -leaf onions caused injury and some stand reduction. Bromoxynil (Buctril®) herbicide at 0. 25 lb. a. i. /A applied early POST gave generally good weed control but did not adequately control sweetclover. Buctril® applied in clear weather did not injure 1 -leaf onions but caused severe injury on 2 - and 3 -leaf onions when applied during cloudy weather conditions. Buctril® plus pendimethalin (Prowl®) tank-mix combination applied POST provided good control of London rocket, sweetclover, and prostrate pigweed; however, onion injury was severe due to applying Buctril® in cloudy weather. Buctril® and Goal® effectively controlled weeds present in the onions but timing of POST applications was critical with respect to onion size and weather conditions to minimize injury...|$|E
40|$|Bensulide (Prefar®), {{clomazone}} (Command®), sulfentrazone (FMC), and halosulfuron (FMC) treatments applied preemergence (PREE) gave {{very good}} weed control of <b>prostrate</b> <b>pigweed</b> (Amaranthus blitoides), lambsquarters (Chenopodium album), and common purslane (Potulaca oleracea) at 5 weeks after treatment (WAT). Bentazon (Basagran ® and halosulfuron applied postemergence (POST) alone were marginally effective {{at less than}} 85 % against the pigweed species at 2 WAT and controlled lambsquarters and common purslane. POST treatments following PREE treatments were highly effective to control most weeds. Watermelon injury was acceptable for Command and halosulfuron treatments. Basagran caused slight injury when applied POST on the watermelons. Carfentrazone was not effective against the weeds present in this test site and was safe on the crop. The greatest number of marketable watermelons were harvested from plots having treatments that provided effective weed control. Command plus Prefar PREE followed by Basagran POST and Prefar PREE followed by halosulfuron POST treated watermelons yielded high numbers of marketable fruit...|$|E
40|$|Soybean yield {{reductions}} from sunflower and velvetleaf {{on a per}} plant basis {{were over}} twice as great in 1986 as in 1987, but were similar on a total weight basis. Tall waterhemp caused greater yield reductions on a total weight basis in 1987 than in 1986, but similar reductions on a plant basis each year. Soybean yield reductions from sunflower interference were 27 percent at 2 sunflowers per 11. 3 m row in 1986 and 17 percent at 4 per row in 1987. Yield reductions from 6 velvetleaf per row were 22 and 7 percent and from 6 tall waterhemp 15 and 12 percent in 1986 and 1987 respectively. ^ To economically justify postemergence control 0. 4 and 1. 2 sunflower, 0. 5 and 7. 8 velvetleaf, and 1. 1 and 1. 2 tall waterhemp were needed per 10 m row 1986 and 1987 respectively. ^ In growth chamber studies fresh weight of grain amaranth and giant pigweed were highest and <b>prostrate</b> <b>pigweed</b> lowest at 30 / 24 C, 24 / 18 C and 18 / 12 C day/night temperature regimes. Giant pigweed emerged and grew most rapidly. ^ Giant, grain and Palmer were least and tall waterhemp and redroot most susceptible to preemergence herbicides. Metolachlor applied preemergence at 0. 84 kg/ha resulted in 52 and 74 percent grain amaranth and <b>prostrate</b> <b>pigweed</b> growth reduction compared to 94 to 100 percent for the others. Least susceptible to postemergence herbicides were spiny, Palmer and giant pigweed with prostrate, tumble, and redroot pigweed most susceptible. Bentazon applied postemergence resulted in 4, 39 and 36 percent control of spiny, Palmer and giant pigweed, compared to 74, 59 and 52 percent for redroot, tumble and prostrate pigweeds. ^ 14 C bentazon absorption did not always correspond to growth reduction of pigweeds. Least 14 C was absorbed by prostrate although growth reduction was high. Palmer, giant and smooth also absorbed little 14 C. Tumble, redroot and spiny amaranth absorbed a high amount of 14 C bentazon with a corresponding high growth reduction of tumble and redroot pigweeds, but little growth reduction of spiny amaranth. ...|$|E
40|$|Clomazone (Command®), {{bensulide}} (Prefar®), sulfentrazone, and halosulfuron treatments applied preemergence (PREE) provided {{very good}} control of <b>prostrate</b> <b>pigweed</b> (Amaranthus blitoides), lambsquarters (Chenopodium album), and common purslane (Portulaca oleracea) at better than 90 % at 5 weeks after treatment (WAT). Halosulfuron {{was effective in}} controlling all weeds better than 90 % at 7 WAT Carfentrazone was not effective against most of the weeds present in the test but appeared to be safe on cantaloupe. Postemergence (POST) treatments alone did not provide acceptable control of pigweeds but controlled lambsquarters and common purslane at 2 WAT. Halosulfuron and bentazon (Basagran®) applied POST following PREE treatments controlled most of the weeds better than 90 % through 7 WAT. Cantaloupe yields were highest with good weed control provided by PREE treatments followed by POST herbicide applications. Basagran at 0. 50 lb /A injured cantaloupe after applications but yields were not affected compared to the untreated check. Command, sulfentrazone, and halosulfuron caused cantaloupe injury after PREE applications. Basagran caused substantial crop injury after POST applications...|$|E
40|$|Toothpick ammi (Ammi visnaga (L.) Lamarck, Apiaceae), {{a summer}} annual of Eurasian origin, {{commonly}} occurs along agricultural field margins in the Sacramento Valley of northern California, typically flowering from June to August. Observations during 1979 - 1984 yielded 65 distinguishable insect taxa attending the flowers, including 60 {{groups that were}} {{at least in part}} entomophagous. Peak attendances occurred for Braconidae, Ichneumonidae, Sarcophagidae, Sphecidae, Tachinidae, and Vespidae during early morning hours. Hay alfalfa (Medicago sativa L., Fabaceae) was grown in replicated plots with borders ofeither: (1) toothpick ammi, (2) common knotweed (Polygonum aviculare L., Polygonaceae), (3) <b>prostrate</b> <b>pigweed</b> (Amaranthus graecizans L [...] Amaranthaceae), or (4) Clean-cultivated edges. Borders of flowering toothpick ammi attracted numerous entomophaga, but had no effect on densities of minute pirate bug (Orius trisricolor [White], Hemiptera: Anthocoridae) occurring in alfalfa. Pepper (Capsicum annuum L., Solanaceae) was grown with borders of either: (I) Vegetative Ammi, from which the flowers were repeatedly clipped, (2) Normally-flowering Amwi; or (3) Clean-cultivated borders (control) to assess impact on abundance of entomophaga.
