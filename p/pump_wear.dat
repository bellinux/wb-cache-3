While these situations are rare and unfortunate, the failure investigation and recovery from the event serve a valuable purpose in advancing future space mechanism development. Such a scenario began on July 31, 2010 with the premature failure of an ammonia pump on the external active thermal control system of the International Space Station. The ground-based inspections of the returned pump and ensuing failure investigation revealed five potential bearing forces that were un-accounted for in the design phase and qualification testing of the pump. These forces could combine in a number of random orientations to overload the pump bearings leading to solid-surface contact, wear, and premature failure. The recovery plan identified one of these five forces as being related to the square of the operating speed of the pump and this fact was used to recover design life through a change in flight rules for the operation of the pump module.

40|$|Lecturepg. 41 Monitoring {{vibration}} as a {{predictive maintenance}} tool will not consistently prevent catastrophic damage and/or fluid release from sealess pumps. When vibration readings are taken periodically, a pump may be destroyed between monitoring schedules. Using acceleration {{to monitor the}} internal rotor of a sealess pump does not {{work as well as}} it does on a sealed pump configuration. There are several reasons for this. First, the internal rotor mass is relatively low when compared {{to the rest of the}} pump. The external mass dampens the vibration signal and a clear interpretation is not always possible. Second, vibration generated by inconsistent fluid flow during abnormal operating conditions can create confusing vibration amplitudes. Thirds, sealess pumps are relatively new and experience with vibration interpretation is limited. Monitoring sealess pumps by means other than vibration are generally reactionary, such as indicating the presence of liquid where none should be or detecting the conditions that will result in internal rotor damage. Also, some devices that monitor internal rotor condition create an additional leak path from the pump to atmosphere. Internal rotor monitoring methods generally rely on ?wearing through something? to create a signal that is detectable outside of the pump. The signal is representative of the remaining bearing life. These methods are not effective unless the internal <b>pump</b> <b>wear</b> is uniform over time.

40|$|The annual {{agricultural}} electric pumping usage in California {{is around}} 10 million MWh {{and most of}} it occurs in the Sacramento and San Joaquin Valleys, wher e the majority of agriculture is located (Burt et al., 2003). Pumping costs are often higher than they should be for two reasons: more water is pumped than is necessary, and/or the pumping plant operates inefficiently (either the pump itself is inefficient, or the total dynamic head is greater than needed). Ideally, new electric overall pumping plant efficienci es (OPPE) should be at leas t 70 percent (for greater than 25 kilowatts) and every new pumping plant should be tested to verify/determine the starting OPPE. Current practices in the California agricultural irri gation market do not typically guarantee a new OPPE, nor are verification tests performed by the pump vendor or others. Pumps that are initially efficien t can become inefficient through <b>pump</b> <b>wear,</b> changes in groundwater conditions, and changes in the irrigation system (Hanson, 1988). Options for improving OPPE include adjusting impellers, repairing or replacing worn pu mps, replacing mismatched pumps, and converting to energy efficient electric motors (Hanson, 2002). Variable frequency drives, while not improving the OPPE, reduce the input kW by only produc ing the flow and pressure combin ation that is required at the moment. Pumping plants should be evaluated every several years to determine th e status of the pump and possible reasons for poor efficiency. Evalua ting a pumping plant requires a pump test, during which capacity (flow rate), lift, discharg e pressure and input horsepower are measur ed. Electric utilities such as Pacific Gas and Electric Company have provided such eval uations for over 70 years in California to minimize energy consumption in the irrigation sector. Additional programs have been sponsored by the California Energy Commission (Burt and Howes, 2005). Though pump repair or replacement can substantially improve performa nce, energy savings will also depend on management and the design of the irrigati on system. To reduce electrical energy use, the kilowatt-hours must decrease because of fewer kilo watts (kW) or less operati ng time, or both. If the new/repaired pump produces a higher flow rate than before, the hours of operation must be reduced to deliver the same volume; operating the same number of hours can use just as much electricity as before. Irrigation pumps are typica lly overdesigned to cope with the worst working conditions (normally peak demands, and low groundwater levels) but this means that in normal operation the pump will use more kW than necessary for a desired flow rate. In such cases, installing variable frequency drives (VFDs) allows pumps to run at slower speeds in cases of lower demand (pressure or flow rate), requiring less kW – even though the impeller/bowl efficiency may be lower than at the maximum design flow rate and pressure. High efficiency motors should save 3 - 5 % of their operating co st, although some motors labeled as being “high efficiency” a ppear to have lower efficiency th an standard motors (Burt et al. 2008). The points above are well known in concept. However, information from large da tasets of actual pump performance is difficult to obtain.

40|$|Condition Monitoring is an {{area that}} has seen {{substantial}} growth in the last few decades. The purpose for implementing condition monitoring in industry is to increase productivity, decrease maintenance costs and increase safety. Therefore, condition monitoring can be used not only for planning maintenance but also for allowing the selection of the most efficient equipment to minimize operating costs. Hydraulic systems are widely used in industry, aerospace and agriculture and are becoming more complex in construction and in function. Reliability of the systems must be supported by an efficient maintenance scheme. Due to component wear or failure, some system parameters may change causing abnormal behaviour in each component or in the overall circuit. Research in this area has been substantial, and includes specialized studies on artificial fault simulation at the University of Saskatchewan. In this research, an axial pump was the focus of the study. In an axial piston <b>pump,</b> <b>wear</b> between the various faces of components can occur {{in many parts of the}} unit. As a consequence, leakage can occur in locations such as between the valve plate and barrel, the drive shaft and oil wiper, the control piston and piston guide, and the swash plate and slippers. In this study, wear (and hence leakage) between the pistons and cylinder bores in the barrel was of interest. Researchers at the University of Saskatchewan, as well as at other research institutions, have been involved in studies to detect wear in pumps using a variety of condition monitoring algorithms. However, to verify the reliability and indeed, limitations of some of the approaches, it is necessary to test the algorithms on systems with “real” leakage. To introduce actual wear in the piston of pumps can be very difficult and very expensive. Hence, introducing piston wear in an “artificial” manner would be of great benefit in the evaluation of various condition monitoring techniques. Since leakage is a direct consequence of piston wear, it is logical to conclude that varying the leakage in some prescribed manner can be used to artificially simulate wear. A prime concern, therefore, is to be able to precisely understand the dynamic relationships between the wear and leakage and the effect it has on the output flow or pressure waveform from the pump. Introducing an artificial leakage to simulate the wear of pistons is a complex task. The creation of an artificial leakage path was not simply a process of providing a resistive short to the tank at the outlet of the pump port as was done in other studies. The objective was to create a leakage environment that would simulate leakage from a single piston (or combination of several pistons thereof). The complexity of the flow and pressure ripple waveforms (which various condition monitoring algorithms did require) was such that a more comprehensive leakage behaviour had to be modeled and experimentally created. A pressure control servo valve with a very high frequency response was employed to divert the flow from the pump outlet with a prescribed waveform directly to the tank to simulate the piston leakage from the high pressure discharge chamber to the pump case drain chamber as the simulated worn piston made contact with the high pressure chamber. The control algorithm could mimic the action of a single worn piston at various degrees of wear. The experimental results indicated that the experimental system could successfully introduce artificial leakage into the pump which was quite consistent with a unit with a “real” worn piston. Comparisons of the pressure ripples from an actual faulty pump (worn piston) and the “artificial” faulty pump (artificial leakage) are presented...|$|E
