Uranium reactors had already been established, and Hyman Rickover, de facto head of the US nuclear program, wanted the plutonium from uranium-powered nuclear plants to make bombs.

However, with computers, rather than calculate an interpolation into a table, it is often better to find some simpler calculation giving equivalent results. Everything now depends on the exact details of {{the format of the}} representation, plus what operations are available to access and manipulate the parts of the number. For example, Fortran offers an EXPONENT(x) function to obtain the <b>power.</b> <b>Effort</b> expended in devising a good initial approximation is to be recouped by thereby avoiding the additional iterations of the refinement process that would have been needed for a poor approximation. Since these are few (one iteration requires a divide, an add, and a halving) the constraint is severe.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: A general {{concept of}} {{interfaces}} between physical and virtual systems {{based on a}} continuity of energy-flow, introduced as hyper-bonds, will be extended. <b>Power</b> (<b>effort</b> × flow) can be bi-directionally transferred from the physical energy-level to the virtual signal/information-level and vice versa. In mixed reality systems, using these hyper-bonds, power connections of relevant phenomena can be described by bond graph theory. Two improvements of the hyper-bond concept are presented: 1. the explicit description of both, continuous-time dynamics of real subsystems and discrete-time dynamics of virtual subsystems in bond graphs and 2. {{the definition of a}} hyper-bond subsystem in terms of bond graphs and control-block diagrams, which can perform a power connection and conversion of continuous-time/discrete-time signals between real/virtual subsystems. An example of modeling mixed reality systems with energy interfaces (haptic ball manipulator) is demonstrated, showing the potentiality for low cost automation. Copyright © 2006 IFA...|$|E

A comparator bank triggers these multiple TDCs. This multiple event approach has advantages over classic single TDC solutions when facing unknown channel gains, noise corruption, and strong fading channel behavior.

40|$|Gene {{characterization}} is {{an essential}} step {{in the understanding of}} biological process. However, sequence analysis is a laboratorious procedure, that requires an experienced annotator, who needs to be familiar with different softwares [1]. We developed a computational gene annotation system in order to automatically identify genes and their products. It was currently established for annotation of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) involved in the control of cellular proliferation and the origin of tumors [2]. This system is composed by a graphical client-server interface supported by a MySQL database. The choice of a Web interface aims to integrate and facilitate the use of the numerous publicly available genomic tools and, thus, obtain a complete and homogeneous analysis of the ESTs. The database was modeled to store the annotation history which is helpful to the annotator in verifing when and how the annotation was carried out. Moreover, the structure of this database allows insertion of other Bioinformatics programs. The annotation is comprised of two parts: automatic and manual. At the automatic section, firstly, the ESTs are identified and located in a genome using the BLAST and BLAT alignment programs. Then, the ESTs are characterized through searches in public databases such as Locus Link and PFAM. Concluded the automatic part, it is necessary to manually input Gene Ontology data due to the difficulty in finding computationally the information on the gene function [3]. The results obtained from the annotation are stored in the database to be used for future consultation and to help the design of new experiments. This annotation system decreases repetitive man/woman <b>power</b> <b>effort</b> tasks, providing a useful tool for genome research laboratories and a friendly environment [...] ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract [...] Web mining is {{basically}} knowledge discovery from the World Wide Web (WWW). This practical application of data mining helps {{to integrate the}} data gathered by the traditional data mining methodologies or data mining techniques as well as data gathered by the WWW. The term Web mining {{has been used in}} three distinct ways which are web content mining, web usage mining and web structure mining. Here, we are uses Web structure mining, it is the process of using graph theory to analyze the node and connection structure of a web site. In this research paper we are uses the distinct type of web mining called “Web Structure Mining ” which helps to extract patterns from hyperlinks in a web where the function of hyperlink to connect a web page with any other location of the same or different web page. A specific hyperlink behaves like a structural component in case of “web structure mining”. In this research paper, we are merging the concept of web mining with the network security so that we can easily detect the online attacks occur on the network by using web agents (i. e. - web agents are basically web robots) rather than using man <b>power</b> <b>effort.</b> The major objective is to reduce cost as well as time while identifying online attack. Here we use “rule induction data mining technique ” to achieve maximum accuracy of results. The special focus is to detect online active attack by the web agents after that they will provide security by using various mechanisms and techniques. In this way, we can also say that these web agents help to protect us from attacker during online data transfer which follows the concept of network security. The first task of web agents is to identify the type of active attack after that provide several ways to prevent security. In this way we can use a “Hybrid approach” (i. e. - web mining with network security). The major benefit to use this hybrid approach is to save time and cost which are the major objectives of data mining...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (D. Ed.) [...] University of Melbourne, Faculty of Education, 2004 The {{research}} {{aimed to}} investigate how leaders behaved and were perceived by their staff to behave {{during a period}} of successful change. More specifically the study examined the work of leaders who acted strategically, namely, the presidents of Rajabhat Institutes in Bangkok, when a new policy, Mass Education, was introduced and successfully implemented. The methodology used for this study was the qualitative approach. The study focused on the strategic leadership of the Presidents of two Rajabhat Institutes and used a semi-structured interview method and documentary review to collect data. The participants were the Presidents of the two Rajabhat Institutes, six administrative staff and six teachers from each Institute. Five elements of strategic leadership were used as a framework for analysis. The discussion of the findings was aided by a conceptual framework of strategic leadership, educational change and Thai culture. The findings revealed that the Presidents achieved success in the implementation of change through their actions, as classified according to the five elements in a framework of strategic leadership. It is apparent that both Presidents were very much concerned about global knowledge. Their knowledge of global and local trends gained them the trust of their colleagues. During their term as Presidents, they planned for the Institutes to enter into partnerships with international universities, with the aim of benchmarking on an international scale. Their vision was reflected in changes at the Institutes. The Presidents and their leadership teams collaborated as the key agents of change. In sharing knowledge and encouraging others, both Presidents performed the role of knowledge generators, mostly through communication in both formal and informal ways, which they considered their forte. The Presidents selected ways, appropriate for their own organisations, to share knowledge. Along with knowledge and support, the Presidents supported teachers by making resources available and by providing incentives for good work. In establishing structure, setting priorities and being key sources of expertise, the Presidents achieved their vision by aligning structures with plans and the tasks to be performed. They served as good models of hard work, dependability, and forthright action. This study revealed little about the long-term plans, which were flexible due to insufficient budgets. They effectively managed the annual governmental budgets of their Institutes to provide resources to support teachers and students. In ensuring the attention of the organisation's community was focused on important change, the Presidents worked hard to support the national reform agenda and to build human resources for community development. Their ability to provide knowledge through information technology was an appropriate way to serve the country in the implementation of the Mass Education policy. Strategic intent was apparent in the framework of the plan in its attempt to achieve desired outcomes. Strategic planning in the use of information technology contributed to achieving the goal. The use of advanced technology in learning and teaching enabled the Institutes to provide a wide range of curricula for the communities they served. The strong emphasis on community development led to cooperation between Institutes and the community. In monitoring and reviewing the implementation of policy, the Presidents informally and indirectly evaluated the programs. The purpose of evaluation was to improve the learning and teaching processes. The Presidents gave rewards and incentives to the teachers for good performance. The study revealed that the successful change that resulted from their strong strategic leadership was influenced by Thai values and Buddhist culture. The study showed that the Presidents were aware of the values and the culture of the people they were working with. Self-concept and self-esteem as well as ego-self are important when considering change. Senior status and hierarchical chain of respect are also important. The values of bun-khun (pay back) and krengjai (deference) were used on many occasions to ensure cooperation. The personal preference for "true-good-friend" (Kalayanamitr) also played a major role. The Presidents' ability to encourage staff to commit to change also reflected personal preference. In regard to Buddhist culture, the study revealed that both Presidents observed four aspects of Dhamma-oriented leadership: Wisdom <b>Power,</b> <b>Effort</b> Power, Faultlessness Power and Kindliness Power. In addition, the Buddhist culture of a middle way, and a harmonious and peaceful life led to avoidance of problems or confrontation. Persuasive talk, or looking for the next person to do the task, was the choice. Recommendations are offered for improving the practice of strategic leadership and for the conduct of research in the Thai setting. Restricted Access: Staff and Students of the University Onl...|$|E
