40|$|The {{variability}} {{and limited}} predictability of wind power challenges {{the operation of}} power systems, where the generation and load are required in balance at all times. The transmission system operator (TSO) is the responsible party. In a liberalized energy sector, key technical elements of power system operation have been transferred to markets and are thereby translated into economic responsibilities born by all system parties. The Dutch TSO TenneT operates the 15 min interval real-time system balancing the market platform where energy responsibilities are economically assessed. Market parties subject to programme responsibilities with wind power {{as part of their}} generation portfolio must bear the integration costs of wind power’s variability and forecast errors. The question arises what the real value of wind power is in the market. In this paper, a straightforward approach is used for the economic evaluation of existing wind power, taking Dutch market as a case study. Factual production data are obtained from a 108 MW offshore wind farm. Two variations of persistence forecast model are applied for the assessment of wind power value, which is quantified using price data on the Dutch wholesale markets and the TSO’s balancing market. It is found that presently in The Netherlands, wind power is a price-taker with a value equalling 90 – 110 % of averaged market prices, including the imbalance cost component. The right-skewed distribution of APX (Amsterdam <b>Power</b> <b>eXchange)</b> <b>spot</b> <b>market</b> prices is found to reduce the market value of wind power. The impact of forecast errors on overall wind power value is low due to the small impact of wind power on short-term wholesale market prices...|$|E

In this paper, we assess the overall efficiency of the German electricity wholesale market using cointegration analysis and error correction modelling.

We show that the wholesale market seems to be inefficient and not well functioning. The inability of European Energy <b>Exchange</b> <b>spot</b> <b>market</b> in providing an efficient price reference to the power market suggest that the <b>power</b> <b>exchange</b> still lacks liquidity.

40|$|Abstract—With {{the recent}} uptake in {{renewable}} energies, such as wind and solar, often comes the apprehension of unreliable energy supply due to {{variations in the}} availability of those energy sources, also resulting in severe fluctuations {{in the price of}} electricity at energy <b>exchange</b> <b>spot</b> <b>markets.</b> However, those fluctuations in energy costs {{can also be used to}} stimulate industry players to shift energy intense processes to times when renewable energies are abundant, not only saving money but at the same time also stabilising the power grid.

40|$|We study dealer {{behavior}} in the foreign <b>exchange</b> <b>spot</b> <b>market</b> using a detailed data set on the complete transactions of four dealers. There is strong support for an information effect in incoming trades. Although {{there is evidence that}} the information effect increases with trade size in direct bilateral trades, the direction of a trade seems to be more important. The large share of electronically brokered trades is probably responsible for this finding. In direct trades it is the initiating dealer that determines trade size, while in broker trades it is the dealer submitting the limit order that determines the maximum trade size. We also find strong evidence of inventory control for all the four dealers. Inventory control is not, however, manifested through a dealer's own prices as suggested in inventory models. This is different from the strong price effect from inventory control found in previous work by Lyons [J. Fin. Econ 39 (1995) 321]. A possible explanation for this finding is that the introduction of electronic brokers allowed more trading options. Furthermore, we document differences in trading styles among the four dealers, especially how they actually control their inventories. Foreign Exchange; Trading; Microstructure...|$|R

40|$|An {{attempt is}} made to create a model of {{exchange}} rates that explains the short term, daily levels of the foreign <b>exchange</b> <b>spot</b> <b>market.</b> The model is a monetary type {{that focuses on the}} eurocurrency markets and the current account. It has a liquidity preference form and employs daily data. The futures rate, the euro interest rate, the eurocurrency money stocks and a current account variable are the individual variables of the model. The futures rate and the euro interest rates are from the assumed Fisher's 'Covered Interest Rate Paradigm'. The eurocurrency money stock variable's justification is based on the real world structure of the <b>spot</b> <b>market</b> where the foreign exchange desks of the major world commercial banks are the dominant players. The current account variable, which is motivated by a desire to improve on the short run performance of the Purchasing Power Parity variable of other monetary models, is justified by trade theory. The liquidity preference form of the model is in keeping with current monetary models. The econometric results show that the model is better than the random walk model. However the results of the individual variables are mixed. The futures rate accounts {{for the vast majority of}} the model's success. Although the eurocurrency variable is as statistically significant as the interest rate differentials from the widely accepted Fisher's Covered Interest Rate Parity paradigm, neither was as significant as the futures rate. The current account variable results are not statistically significant. Thus, the current account variable may be discarded while the eurocurrency interest rates and euromoney variables warrant further study. As a result of the dominance of the futures rate variable, models that cry to capture rational expectations such as the News or Chaos Models are appealing. This rational expectations characteristic of the market combined with the dominance of speculation over economic fundamentals also points toward game theory as a good candidate for further study...|$|R

40|$|The {{focus of}} this thesis {{is to develop a}} model that aims to predict how {{electronic}} network latency affects the performance, and in turn the profit and loss of Automatic Market Making making in the Foreign <b>Exchange</b> <b>Spot</b> <b>market.</b> The output from this model will then be used in an investment analysis to determine if the improved profit from upgrading a automatic trading platform is large enough to give a solid return on investment. It´s widely known between players in the Financial Services industry that network performance affects the profitability of automatic trading algorithm, latency in networks will delay the view of market prices and order execution and therefore make trading algorithms less predictable. To date there have not been any extensive research focusing on the scale of the impact on profitability. A greater understanding of how much network latency affects the performance of automatic trading strategies will give an indication on how much it´s worth investing in surrounding IT systems and IT infrastructure in order to maximize the profitability. During this research a simplified model of Automatic FX <b>Spot</b> <b>Market</b> Making was developed. Based on that model a trading scenario representing a typical Automatic Market Making approach was built. The model and the scenario was then be implemented as a computer program and simulations where run and relative profitability data collected. The analysis of the data from the simulations clearly shows that profitability of an Automatic Market Making Strategy drops drastically when network performance drops. The model shows that there is a large difference in profitability between networks with no latency compared to a network with some latency, with further latency the profitability shrinks in a slower rate. The findings in this research clearly indicates that it is economically profitable to invest in high performing electronic networks, which minimize latency as much as possible when running a Automatic Market Making operation. However, before investing in a state of the art Automatic Trading system a bank should make sure that the underlying financial models are correct. 3 This research has been done together with the head of FX Algoritmic Trading at UBS Investment Bank and the results are of direct interest to both UBS and other participants in the Automatic trading space. rickard. berglen@gmail. co...|$|R
