50|$|The band's {{previous}} album, The Divine Conspiracy, {{was dealing}} {{with the idea that}} God created many religions and that it was to man to understand that they are all the same, and this album will be dealing with the <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>thoughts</b> and imaginations, as Mark Jansen stated: The album title, Design Your Universe, deals with new breakthroughs in quantum physics. It proves that we are all connected to each other on subatomic level. Also, it shows that we can create or at least influence matter with our thoughts… a very interesting fact. Because it changes everything for us, our whole worldview collapses once you accept these facts and integrate them in your lives. So this had to become the new album title. Three songs of this album continue the A New Age Dawns saga, which started on the album Consign to Oblivion of 2005.|$|E

The latest generation gadgets i-pad, i-pod, i-phone are making the life smooth and affordable. Most of these devices are controlled by the human being with some physical movement. Think of the situation when the futuristic devices will move with the <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>thoughts</b> and speed of emotions. The present paper is a core idea of i-Thoun (an electronic gadget Intelligent based Thought network), a new generation computing device which will run {{with the speed of}} thoughts. The network, system connectivity and data transfer all will be available with a high definition speed and with enormous security. The present paper will give the technocrats a new vision and direction of the futuristic computing devices...|$|E

The following concepts from quantum mechanics are explored as possible theories that may support <b>power</b> <b>of</b> thought: the inseparability of the wave function, Bohm’s principle of active information and the Stapp-von Neumann interpretatio...|$|R
