50|$|Parsytec {{has become}} known in the late 1980s and early 1990s as a {{manufacturer}} of transputer-based parallel systems. Products ranged from a single transputer <b>plug-in</b> <b>board</b> for the IBM PC up to large massively-parallel systems with thousands of transputers (or processors, respectively) such as the Parsytec GC. Some sources call the latter ultracomputer sized, scalable multicomputers (smC).|$|E

50|$|The PICMG 2.30 {{extension}} {{introduces a}} new J2 connector type on the <b>plug-in</b> <b>board,</b> an Ultra Hard Metric (UHM) connector with virtual coaxial box shielding technology, which reduces crosstalk at high speeds. This connector supports high frequencies of 5 Gbit/s, even when mated with the CompactPCI-standard unshielded 2-mm hard-metric headers.The matching P2 backplane connector {{remains the same}} as for CompactPCI, as do the J1/P1 connectors.|$|E
50|$|The PICMG {{subcommittee}} {{drafting the}} standard {{has proposed a}} new, denser backplane connector type with a 2 mm x 1.4 mm pitch that supports higher transfer rates of up to 12 Gbit/s without a need for bridges or switches. It offers up to 184 pin pairs on a 3U board.A major difference compared to CompactPCI is that with CompactPCI Serial the plug connector is on the board, while the receptacle is on the backplane. This approach is intended to make the standard more robust by avoiding twisted pins on the backplane: If a pin fails, only the <b>plug-in</b> <b>board</b> must be exchanged.The system slot of CompactPCI Serial has six connectors: P1 to P6.On peripheral boards only P1 is mandatory, while P2 to P6 are optional.|$|E
50|$|The {{first product}} {{developed}} was a GPIB controller (computing) <b>plug-in</b> <b>board</b> for the IBM PC. The founders eventually {{came up with}} the idea of creating one or more software development tools for the PC which they could sell to provide working capital. The first such product was PolyLibrarian, an object module library utility, which was introduced in late 1982 and written by Kinzer. At the time, there were few, if any, object module librarians available to PC programmers. In 1983, Polytron introduced PolyMake, an MS-DOS version of the well known Unix make utility, initially written by Perkins. The PolyMake product was followed in 1985 by the Polytron Version Control System (PVCS) (also written by Kinzer), that was loosely based on the RCS change control system authored by Walt Tichy while at Purdue University.|$|E

5000|$|One common {{variety of}} single board {{computer}} uses standardized computer form factors intended {{for use in a}} backplane enclosure. Some of these types are CompactPCI, PXI, VMEbus, VXI, and PICMG. SBCs have been built around various internal processing structures including the Intel architecture, multiprocessing architectures, and lower power processing systems like RISC and SPARC. In the Intel PC world, the intelligence and interface/control circuitry is placed on a <b>plug-in</b> <b>board</b> that is then inserted into a passive (or active) backplane. The end result is similar to having a system built with a motherboard, except that the backplane determines the slot configuration. Backplanes are available with a mix of slots (ISA, PCI, PCIX, PCI-Express, etc.), usually totaling 20 or fewer, meaning it will fit in a 19" [...] rackmount enclosure (17" [...] wide chassis).|$|E
5000|$|When {{microprocessors}} (CPU chips) became available, SWTPC {{became one}} of the first suppliers of microcomputers to the general public, focusing on designs using the Motorola 6800 and, later, the 6809 CPUs. Many of these products were available in kit form as well. SWTPC also designed and supplied computer terminals, chassis, processor cards, memory cards, motherboards, I/O cards, disk drive systems, and tape storage systems. From the older [...] "TV Typewriter" [...] design a Video terminal had evolved the CT-64 terminal system, which was an essential part of many early SWTPC systems. Later a more intelligent version of this terminal, the CT-82, was introduced, and a graphical terminal the GT-6144 Graphics Terminal. Still later a SS-50 bus <b>plug-in</b> <b>board,</b> the [...] "Data Systems 68 6845 Video Display Board" [...] was introduced, and a keyboard could be connected to this board. With this solution an external terminal was no longer needed.|$|E
50|$|After the 810, Atari {{released}} the more reliable, enhanced density (130 KB) 1050 drive.In {{addition to the}} extra storage, the serial I/O could be cranked up a notch even faster than the 810 Happy product by the faster speed of the 1050s 6502 processor.The 1050 Enhancement was also a <b>plug-in</b> <b>board,</b> and could be installed without soldering or permanent modification.In addition to the buffered reading and writing with zero latency and faster serial i/o, it supported true double density (180 KB). The 1050 Controller was a small board that was installed inside the 1050 Happy drive that had 2 switches and an led that allowed enabling or disabling disk write-protect to override the notch in the disk. It also allowed switch selection of a slower mode to provide compatibility with some picky programs. Some commercial software only ran in the original slow speed mode. The controller required a mechanical modification to the drive's enclosure and hence its installation was harder than the happy board.|$|E

50|$|There are 384 normal (e.g. instrumental) presets and 48 drum kits. The S90 also {{includes}} standard GM presets. User presets are 128 normal and 16 drum kits. Presets may be expanded through {{up to three}} <b>plug-in</b> <b>boards</b> allowing a bank of 64 presets for each plug-in slot.|$|R
50|$|A {{plan was}} formed to provide a 24 track {{recorder}} <b>plug-in</b> <b>board</b> for Tascam digital mixers, {{but at the end}} Tascam didn't sign the contract as they had received a better offer from one of their existing 3rd party developers (in end the product never appeared). Chris Wright then presented the same idea to Mackie (which at the time was a $300 million NASDAQ listed corporation) and an agreement was made to produce a stand-alone 24 track recorder, that eventually became the Mackie SDR2496. Mackie held off on signing the contract, as their investigations into Sydec's heath had shown that the company was vulnerable and eventually made an offer to buy the shares of Sydec which was accepted. Mackie announced to the world's music industry that they had bought Soundscape at the NAMM show in 2001, which wasn't correct, and in doing so infringed the images, logos copyright owned by Soundscape Digital Technology Ltd. Soundscape's distribution network and customers became extremely nervous and business stalled, just as the long-awaited Mixpander was being launched. Soundscape disputed Mackie's use of their intellectual property and a legal action ensued ending in the High Court in London.|$|E

Designed system provides an automatic test running, a saving of measured data and a test protocol generation. The solution The requirement of an {{automatic data processing}} and an evaluation suggests to use a computer as a control device of a test system. This premise conducts to design a prototype of a test system using virtual instrumentation based on PC plug-in boards. This solution is cheaper and more variable than the system consists from stand-alone instruments connected by IEEE 488 bus. A system for the automatic quality testing of ripple control receivers based on virtual instrumentation was designed and developed.

40|$|Abstract: The paper {{analyses}} {{an effective}} method of increasing accuracy of active power measurement (and energy measurement) by non-coherent sampling. The measurement bias caused by non-coherent sampling are reduced by windowing the instantaneous power sequence of samples by various generalized cosine windows. Active power is found by processing signal in time domain, without using FFT. Newly obtained analytical formulae are given, a comparison to classical method and numerical simulations verifying the derived formulae are presented. A simple method of compensation multiplexing delay by measurement using multiplexing DAQ <b>plug-in</b> <b>board</b> is explained and verified both in simulation and measurement. Application of windowing for measurement of multi-frequency signals is also included, formula for standard uncertainty of active power estimate is given. Basic numerical integration methods applied to quantized input signals in power computation are briefly compared, and numerical values showing decrease in power bias for selected windows are shown...|$|E
40|$|A 36 m Small Angle Neutron Scattering (SANS) Spectrometer (SMARTer) {{has been}} {{installed}} in Serpong, Indonesia in 1992.

40|$|The {{realized}} {{measuring system}} {{consists of a}} set of <b>plug-in</b> <b>boards</b> for a PC. The plug-in arbitrary waveform generator PC 420 (12 -bit, up to 40 MSa/s) in conjunction with the external power Krohn-Hite amplifier serves for generating of excitation waveforms. Measuring boards acquire the waveforms of excitation current and induced voltage. A pair of JanasCard AD 14 measuring boards (nominally 14 -bit, ADC, 100 kSa/s) is mutually interconnected and shares the common start and common clock signals for better synchronization. The clock signals of the data acquisition boards are interconnected with the clock circuit of the <b>plug-in</b> generator <b>board</b> and thus the measurement is synchronous with excitation. In this way, an equivalent-time sampling can be used to extend the frequency range up to 100 kHz. The problems that were observed in this system are the limited resolution of measuring boards (Effective Number of Bits) and the phase error caused by the phase differences of both channels and by the frequency dependence of the sensing resistor.
