50|$|The <b>Portuguese</b> <b>oyster,</b> Crassostrea angulata, is {{a species}} of oyster found in the {{southwest}} Iberian Peninsula, {{closely related to the}} Pacific oyster. Although first identified as a native European species, genetic studies have suggested the <b>Portuguese</b> <b>oyster</b> originated from the Pacific coast of Asia and was introduced to Europe by Portuguese trading ships in the 16th century. The species is usually found in coastal river mouths and estuaries.|$|E
50|$|Prior to {{decimation}} by iridoviral {{disease in}} 1969, C. angulata was extensively cultivated in France and Portugal {{as part of}} the edible oyster industry. The Pacific oyster, which is more resistant to the disease, was introduced in the 1970s and has since replaced C. angulata as the main commercial species.

An oil tanker spill in 1978 further damaged the oyster industry, which continued to suffer until 1981. The oyster industry suffered substantially around the bay. This was a disaster for whole of France and Europe as the Arcachon oyster is a world-famous delicacy.|$|E
40|$|Wastewater {{effluent}} from aquaculture ponds {{can affect}} aquatic ecosystems. To mitigate this problem, we designed 2 sets (southern and northern) of land-based and farm-scale sequential {{integrated multi-trophic aquaculture}} (IMTA) systems {{in order to reduce}} water pollution and to diversify and optimize aquaculture products in coastal southern Taiwan. In each system, the 1 st pond cultivated milkfish as the main aquaculture product, the 2 nd pond cultivated <b>Portuguese</b> <b>oysters</b> as the product to reduce suspended particles, and the 3 rd pond cultivated the seaweed Gracilaria sp. as feed and to absorb nutrients. Photosynthetic bacteria (PSB) were added to the southern system in order to reduce nutrients. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate and compare performance parameters of the compartments and the overall IMTA systems preliminarily. Our results showed that the southern system with the addition of PSB had lower PO 4 − 3 -P, slightly higher turbidity, and higher brown algal biomass than the northern system. In the southern system, PO 4 − 3 -P and cyanobacteria levels were lowest at the end of the seaweed pond. In the northern system, NO 2 −-N and phytoplankton levels were lowest at the end of the seaweed pond. Turbidity was reduced in the oyster pond and further reduced in the Gracilaria pond in both systems. The high seaweed yield in the northern system indicated substantial nutrient absorption. Advantages and limitations in terms of water purification and aquaculture production of these IMTA systems are evaluated in the present paper...|$|R
40|$|After 100 {{years of}} {{published}} recording traces {{pertaining to the}} oyster electrocardiogram (ECG), we revisited the original experiments of Eiger (1913), using state-of-the-art electrophysiology recorders. Our aim was to confirm that a recordable ECG, {{similar to that of}} higher vertebrates, is present in the <b>oyster</b> heart. <b>Portuguese</b> <b>oysters</b> Crassostrea angulata, collected from the Guadiana estuary, Portugal, were used. The oysters were drilled through the right valve to reveal the pericardium. Gold and silver electrodes were placed through the hole and electrophysiological recordings were obtained. Stimulation of the oyster heart was performed in vivo and in vitro using a constant current power supply. Placement of electrodes around the heart revealed a trace that very closely matched the published ECG of Eiger (1913). However, we were unable to confirm that the recording was an ECG of the oyster heart. Moreover, measurements on isolated oyster hearts revealed a low conductivity (0. 10 S m‒ 1). We did, however, record a depolarization signal from what we believe to be the visceral ganglia, and this preceded contractions of the oyster heart. Our findings indicate that so-called ECGs, previously recorded by [2] in Ostrea edulis, but also the “ECG” recorded by [4] in C. virginica from oyster hearts, are in fact an artifact arising from relative movement of the recording electrodes, giving rise to a baseline shift that mimics in some ways the P and QRS features of a typical ECG. Nevertheless, such recordings provide information pertaining to heart rate and are not without importance...|$|R
40|$|Oyster {{aquaculture}} {{is a new}} {{and fast}} growing sector in Vietnam, but confusion exists about {{the identity of the}} species presently under culture, whether they are Pacific <b>oysters</b> (Crassostrea gigas), <b>Portuguese</b> <b>oysters</b> (Crassostrea angulata), hybrids thereof, or other species. This study was carried out to identify which oyster or oysters are most commonly cultured in Vietnam and, additionally, once the species identity was resolved, to assess three farmed Vietnamese stocks for levels of genetic variation and suitability for captive breeding programs. To resolve the taxonomy issues, we searched for nucleotide differences (characteristic attributes) in published mitochondrial DNA cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (COI) sequences that, for the first time, would categorically separate and distinguish in particular C. angulata from C. gigas. On review of 300 published haplotypes of C. angulata and C. gigas based on a 293 bp nucleotide-fragment of published COI sequences, we found that there were five distinct nucleotides that are categorically different between C. angulata and C. gigas and that could be considered as diagnostic nucleotides. Using these five diagnostic nucleotides, we confirmed that the samples from northern Vietnam are C. angulatam, not C. gigas. Similarly, we identified other oyster species in Vietnam from Nhatrang as C. sikamea and C. madrasensis. DNA microsatellite data (following) can also support understanding of the taxonomy, directly by comparing allele types and frequencies between putative species, but also indirectly because as nuclear DNA, microsatellite genotypes may reveal if hybridization is occurring (as evidenced by deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium). No evidence, considering Hardy-Weinberg deviations, for interspecific hybridization was found. To address the diversity issues, three hatchery bred populations of C. angulata were screened for allelic variation at nine DNA microsatellite loci. All three lines had high allelic diversity, moderate effective population sizes (Ne), and little evidence of kinship, which, by precent with other hatchery bred highly fecund oyster species, is a little unexpected. It is speculated that local hatchery practises may involve sharing stock among hatcheries which then may contribute to the maintenance of moderate to high levels of diversity during hatchery reproduction of this highly fecund species...|$|R
5000|$|The <b>Portuguese</b> <b>oyster</b> (Crassostrea angulata) {{cultivated}} off the Atlantic {{coast of}} France and Portugal was largely {{killed by an}} iridoviral disease in 1969. To replace the stock, large quantities of Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas) spat were imported from Japan. Some {{efforts were made to}} kill any fouling organisms that might be associated with the spat by immersing it for two periods, each of one hour, in fresh water. However, in the early 1970s, there were reports of a brown Didemnum [...] ascidian on oyster beds in the region. Around the same time, oyster spat from Japan was introduced into the Pacific coastal regions of Canada and the USA and soon afterwards an ascidian was observed there, and later identified as D. vexillum. By 2014, this tunicate was present in the eastern Atlantic, North Sea and Mediterranean Sea in the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Ireland, France and Italy. On the east coast of North America its range extended from New Jersey, New York, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Massachusetts and New Hampshire, to Maine. In the eastern Pacific its range extends from Alaska to California. It is also present in New Zealand, where it was first observed in 2001, its only known encroachment into the Southern Hemisphere.|$|E

40|$|The <b>Portuguese</b> <b>oyster</b> Crassostrea angulata (Lamarck, 1819) {{was long}} {{assumed to be}} native to the northeastern Atlantic, however, a number of lines of {{evidence}} now indicate {{that it is a}} close relative, or identical, to the Asian Pacific oyster C. gigas (Thunberg, 1793). Three hypotheses have been proposed to explain how this strikingly disjunct geographic distribution may have come about: ancient vicariance events, recent anthropogenic introduction to Asia and recent anthropogenic introduction to Europe. We have performed a molecular phylogenetic analysis of C. angulata based on mitochondrial DNA sequence data for a 579 -nucleotide fragment of cytochrome oxidase I. Our results show that <b>Portuguese</b> <b>oyster</b> haplotypes cluster robustly within a clade of Asian congeners and are closely related, but not identical, to C. gigas from Japan. The mitochondrial data are the first to show that Portuguese oysters are genetically distinct from geographically representative samples of Japanese Pacific oysters. Our phylogenetic analyses are consistent with a recent introduction of C. angulata to Europe either from a non-Japanese Asian source population or from a subsequently displaced Japanese source population. Genetic characterization of Pacific oysters throughout their Asian range is necessary to fully reveal the phylogenetic relationships among Portuguese and Pacific oysters...|$|E
40|$|Sperm {{cryopreservation}} is {{a widely}} employed technique that promotes alternative techniques to contribute to broodstock management or restoration programs for species of commercial interest, endangered species or species with an interesting genotype. The preservation of genetic material from improved stocks or from the original population is extremely important for the oyster aquaculture industry to prevent the potential impacts of epidemic diseases and natural disasters. The <b>Portuguese</b> <b>oyster,</b> Crassostrea angulata, {{was the most important}} species commercialized by the shellfish industry. However, inadequate management of this industry and pathology occurrences resulted in a significant decrease in natural populations. For this reason, in this work a successful sperm cryopreservation protocol for this important species has been developed for the first time. Different internal cryoprotectants (DMSO, ethylene glycol, polyethylene glycol and methanol) at several concentrations (5, 10, 20 %), containers (straws vs cryovials) and freezing rates (slow and fast rates) were tested. Cryoprotectant toxicity tests corroborated that this assay did {{not take into account the}} following steps of cryopreservation protocol as sperm agglutination. A fast freezing rate of cells diluted in 10 % DMSO and the use of straws as containers were the best cryopreservation conditions for <b>Portuguese</b> <b>oyster</b> sperm. Finally, fertilization assays confirmed the efficiency of the cryopreservation protocol in oyster sperm. These results demonstrated that different susceptibilities have been detected concerning sperm cryopreservation depending on oyster species or genetic material composition...|$|E
40|$|Rising {{anthropogenic}} {{carbon dioxide}} (CO 2) dissolving into coastal waters is decreasing the pH and carbonate ion concentration, thereby lowering the saturation state of calcium carbonate (CaCO 3) minerals {{through a process}} named ocean acidification (OA). The unprecedented threats posed by such low pH on calcifying larvae of several edible oyster species {{have not yet been}} fully explored. Effects of low pH (7. 9, 7. 6, 7. 4) on the early growth phase of <b>Portuguese</b> <b>oyster</b> (Crassostrea angulata) veliger larvae was examined at ambient salinity (34 ppt) and the low-salinity (27 ppt) treatment. Additionally, the combined effect of pH (8. 1, 7. 6), salinity (24 and 34 ppt) and temperature (24 °C and 30 °C) was examined using factorial experimental design. Surprisingly, the early growth phase from hatching to 5 -day-old veliger stage showed high tolerance to pH 7. 9 and pH 7. 6 at both 34 ppt and 27 ppt. Larval shell area was significantly smaller at pH 7. 4 only in low-salinity. In the 3 -factor experiment, shell area was affected by salinity and the interaction between salinity and temperature but not by other combinations. Larvae produced the largest shell at the elevated temperature in low-salinity, regardless of pH. Thus the growth of the <b>Portuguese</b> <b>oyster</b> larvae appears to be robust to near-future pH level (> 7. 6) when combined with projected elevated temperature and low-salinity in the coastal aquaculture zones of South China Sea. © 2012. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

Bivalve production, especially Crassostrea angulata (<b>Portuguese</b> <b>oyster)</b> has been practiced from long ago, and although its production suffered several constraints, in recent years it has been increasing the interests in recovering production and in preserving nature populations. In this sense, new research needs to guarantee an efficient and economically viable production, contributing to a relatively new environmental concern: wild population restoration. Nowadays, pure wild populations of Crassostrea angulata are rare to find due to multiple factors that affected this oyster industry. Cryopreservation technology could promote alternative techniques to contribute for the resource management efficiency of the <b>Portuguese</b> <b>oyster</b> and associated economic activity. In this sense, standardization of procedures is important for Crassostrea genus. At the present there are no cryopreservation reports on Crassostrea angulata sperm, and therefore, one of the objectives of this work is to design a cryopreservation protocol for this species, testing the more adequate cryoprotectant solution, its ideal concentration, different freezing rates and types of containers. In parallel, this stablished protocol was applied in Crassostrea gigas and compared to other previously published for this species. Analysis of motility, viability, agglutination and fertilizations were used as guides for the establishment of the protocol in C. angulata. Moreover, ATP content, DNA fragmentation and lipid peroxidation were done in order to standardize the same protocol for both species. Movement analysis were assessed by CASA system, viability through common staining techniques and flow cytometer, agglutination was quantified according to the scale developed by Dong et al., (2007), ATP content determined by bioluminescence, Comet assay was performed to quantify the DNA fragmentation and lipid peroxidation determined spectrophotometrically by measuring the absorbance of the malondialdehyde (MDA). Significant differences were observed (p< 0. 05) for lipid peroxidation and fertilization trials whereas ATP content and fragmentation of DNA of the cryopreserved samples did not differ significantly from the control. In C. gigas, the same analysis were performed and did not reveal post-thaw quality differences in the samples cryopreserved with 10 % DMSO. The established protocol revealed to be effective and with a low degree of cellular damage on C. angulata sperm and, at the same time, viable to apply in other species, such as Crassostrea gigas...|$|E
40|$|WOS: 000391962700004 International audienceIt is {{commonly}} presumed that the <b>Portuguese</b> <b>oyster</b> Crassostrea angulata was {{introduced into the}} North East (NE) Atlantic from Asia. The analysis of the nucleotide sequence of a highly polymorphic non-coding mitochondrial region (major noncoding region - MNR) of C. angulata samples collected in Europe (Portugal), Africa (Morocco) and Asia (Shantou and Taiwan) provided new insight into the introduction of this species into the NE Atlantic.

To understand the potential feasibility of hybridization {{between the two}} species, two-by-two factorial cross-experiments were conducted in Shenzhen (Guangdong province). An asymmetry in fertilization was revealed: C. hongkongensis eggs could be fertilized by C. angulata sperm, but the reciprocal cross was not possible. The fertilization and hatching success in the C. hongkongensis females x C. angulata males (HA) cross was lower than the two intraspecific crosses. Moreover, hybrid larvae had a slower growth rate than those from parental progenies due to genome incompatibility. However, {{the size of the}} spat and adult growth were greater than those of the two parental progeny, with obvious heterosis during the grow-out stage. The survival advantage of hybrids was examined at all times. The surprising finding was that all hybrids were completely fertile, meaning they could produce normal and functional gametes. Genetic analysis by molecular markers was applied to confirm that the HA spat were true hybrids. Our results revealed that the interspecific hybridization between C. hongkongensis and C. angulata is completely successful in one direction.

40|$|Genetic {{programs}} are {{an essential component}} of aquaculture operations and can operate as a management tool to prevent inbreeding as well as facilitate selection for improved traits and increased profitability. A key requirement for the operation of genetic programs is the ability to reproduce select animals in captivity, that is, to have full control of the reproductive process. This study focuses on genetics and reproduction of two important but, before this thesis, taxonomically confused/ indistinct aquaculture oyster species: Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas or <b>Portuguese</b> <b>oyster,</b> Crassostrea angulata (this unidentified species is hereafter referred to VNO) and on Sydney rock oyster, Saccostrea glomerata with the aim to develop genetic, molecular and physiological tools required for an optimal operation of genetic programs for these species.

In 1956, it was taken on again intensively in the Scour Basin of Ostend. If we consider the obtained results with the affination of Flat and <b>Portuguese</b> <b>oyster,</b> this 86 ha closed basin, is of an exceptional productivity. Essays on the understanding of the origin of calcified oysters, done from 1960 until 1966, turned out to be very promising and an integral oyster culture from the larvae up to the adult oyster could be observed. In any case the last few years, eventhough compared to before a normal emission of larvae of Ostrea edulis, there has not been a fixation of the origin. Regular samples of plankton, effected from June until August, in 1969 and in 1970, revealed that the offspring of the Flat Oyster showed no growing, while the larvae of other bivalve species in the Scour Bassin, like Mytilus, Mya and Cardium, grew normally. Experiences of artificial oyster cultures in laboratory, effected in 1969 and in 1970, showed the same absence of growth when larvae were placed in water originating from the Scour basin, while in sea water originating from elsewhere, the offspring the stage of metamorphose of larvae was reached within 10 days. Possible causes for the unsuccessfulness are discussed in detail.

Follistatin {{plays a key}} role in regulating folliculogenesis and the development of ovary. However, limited information on follistatin genes from molluscs is available until now. By using Race, real-time PCR, in situ hybridization and in silico analysis, a full-length cDNA of follistatin of the <b>Portuguese</b> <b>oyster</b> Crassostrea angulata was acquired. The full-length (1297 bp) cDNA of Ca-follistatin encodes a peptide of 241 amino acids. The similarity of its deduced amino acid sequence to these of other invertebrate species was about 60 %. Ca-follistatin mRNA transcript was most abundantly expressed in ovary (p< 0. 05), and it was also expressed in testis, adductor muscle, mantle, gill and visceral mass. In situ hybridization revealed that the expression and distribution of Ca-follistatin gene were expressed exclusively in granulosa cells, neither in cumulus oophorus nor in oocytes. During the reproductive cycle of female oyster (initiation stage, maturation stage, ripeness stage and partially spent stage), the expression of Ca-follistatin in the ovary continuously increased from initiation to ripeness stages attaining its highest value (p< 0. 05), then the expression level decreased sharply to the lowest point in the partially spent stage (p< 0. 05), whereas the Ca-follistatin mRNA transcript of male oyster in the testis maintained a relatively stable low level during the first three stages, and also noticeably decreased thereafter (p< 0. 05).

On the other hand, a high proportion of aneuploid cells in somatic tissues have been observed in C. gigas. In this study, we analysed the putative association between aneuploidy levels and the detection of OsHV- 1 in gills of C. gigas, the <b>Portuguese</b> <b>oyster</b> C. angulata and their F 1 hybrids cultured in Ria Formosa (Portugal). OsHV- 1 was detected by PCR in 5. 4 % of the total of oysters analysed (n = 111) namely in 11. 1 %, 8. 0 % and 1. 7 % of C. gigas, C. angulata and F 1 hybrid respectively. Sequencing analysis of a viral fragment amplified with the C 2 /C 6 primer pair revealed a high similarity with the OsHV- 1 reference type. Moreover, in situ hybridization confirmed the presence of OsHV- 1 in gill tissue. Oysters where OsHV- 1 was detected had a significantly higher mean percentage of aneuploid cells (25 %) than the ones where the virus was not detected (18 %). However, the overall low percentage of positive samples contrasted with the high mean percentage of aneuploidy observed, with 50 % of the oysters analysed showing a percentage of aneuploid cells between 20 % and 30 %. We hypothesize that somatic aneuploidy may adversely affect oysters making them more prone to OsHV- 1 infection, but the virus is unlikely to be the cause of somatic aneuploidy. FCT.

40|$|Oysters are {{economically}} (aquaculture) and ecologically important bivalves, with a calcareous {{shell that}} offers mechanical strength and protects them from predators. The shell composition is {{a blend of}} inorganic crystals and shell proteins that form an organic matrix which encloses and protects the soft inner tissue of the oyster. It has been found that the mechanical properties of shells of different oyster species vary. The objective {{of the present study was}} to compare the composition of shell matrix proteins of two phylogenetically related species: the Hong Kong oyster (C rassostrea hongkongensis) and the <b>Portuguese</b> <b>oyster</b> (C rassostrea angulata) which differ in their shell hardness and mechanical properties. Hong Kong oyster shells are comparatively stronger than Portuguese oysters. In the present study, modern proteomics and bioinformatics tools have been used to understand the nature of the Organic Matrix Proteins (OMP) and the possible mechanism involved in the variations observed in the mechanical properties of these two species of oyster shells. After visualizing proteins on SDSPAGE (1 DE) and twodimensional electrophoresis (2 DE) gels, the protein spots and their intensities were compared using PDQuest software and fourteen proteins of C. hongkongensis were found to be significantly different (student’s ttest; p< 0. 05) when compared to the C. angulata. Furthermore, shell OMP separated on 1 DE gels were processed using Triple TOF 5600 mass spectrometry and 42 proteins of C. hongkongensis and 37 of C. angulata identified. A Circos based comparative analysis of the shell proteins of both oyster species were prepared and compared against the shell proteome of other shell forming gastropods, molluscs and the proteome database of the Pacific oyster (C. gigas), whose genome has recently been sequenced, to study the evolutionary conservation of OMP and their function. This pioneering comparative proteomics of the two closely related oyster species, yet with remarkably different mechanical properties, expanded our understating of the molecular mechanism behind the naturally occurring shells of Hong Kong and Portuguese oysters having different hardness and mechanical properties. From biomaterial perspectives, knowledge gained through this study will be useful in biomedical research fields to develop novel biomaterials.

In this way the zootechnological development for seed hatchery production is extremely important. Broodstock conditioning is a key step in the process of rearing bivalve in hatchery. Many factors regulate the reproductive cycle, being food the most important. However the influence of the nutritional quality of different phytoplankton on sexual maturation has been poorly explored. To evaluate the effects of different diets on C. angulata sexual maturity, broodstock were conditioned with different food regimes: Diet 1 : bi-specific combination of Pavlova lutheri and Isochrysis galbana clone T-ISO (1 : 1); Diet 2 : tri-specific combination of P. lutheri, I galbana clone T-ISO and Skeletonema constatum (1 : 1 : 1); Diet 3 : bi-specific combination of S. constatum and Chaetoceros calcitrans (1 : 1) and Diet 4 : tri-specific combination of P. lutheri, S. constatum and C. calcitrans (1 : 1 : 1). During conditioning, condition index and gonad histological analysis were performed. Results showed heterogeneity between diets. At the beginning of conditioning 60 % of individuals were in resting (stage 0), 30 % were males in early gametogenesis (stage I) and 10 % were females in mature stage (stage III). At the end of the conditioning, the most effective diet was the Diet 3 (60 % of mature oysters with a mean condition index value of 2. 83 ± 0. 95). Whereas those fed with Diet 1 have an unsuccessfully gonadic development, with 80 % of individuals in resting stage. Indeed, the condition index, in Diet 1 decreased during the conditioning period. The results obtained in this study reinforce the idea that the diatom microalgae group is essential in the conditioning of C. angulata broodstock. This work constitute an important first step in the hatchery C. angulata broodstock nutrition and a prerequisite for future work on improvement of broodstock conditioning and the optimization of feeding practices that will maximize the conditioning phase and minimize cost in aquaculture hatcheries...|$|E
