Aiming at Chery A 3 sedan, set up the active braking control dynamic simulation system base on MATLAB/Simulink. Adopting the brake driving integration ESP control strategy, analyze and verify the stability control performance of <b>independent</b> <b>vehicle</b> system and vehicle ESP test system based on active braking control respectively in under steering and excessive steering two test conditions. The analyzing results indicate that the test system based on active braking control can effectively assist vehicle travelling in the absence of ESP control or ESP control system failure; when vehicle has ESP control system, the driving stability control performance of this system and <b>independent</b> <b>vehicle</b> system has remarkable consistency. The active braking control system provides a basis for research of vehicle driving stability control test. 1...|$|R

In the article, a four-wheel independent steering linear quadratic regulator controller for model following purpose is designed first. Then, by analyzing the four-wheel <b>independent</b> steering <b>vehicle</b> dynamic characteristics and the influence of linear quadratic regulator control parameters on control performance, a linear quadratic regulator control parameter adjustment strategy based on vehicle steering state is proposed to achieve the adaptive adjustment of linear quadratic regulator control parameters. In addition, to further improve the control performance, the proposed varying parameter linear quadratic regulator control system is optimized by genetic algorithm. Finally, simulation studies have been conducted by applying the proposed control system to the 8 -degree-of-freedom four-wheel <b>independent</b> steering <b>vehicle</b> dynamics model. The simulation results indicate that the proposed control system has better performance and robustness and can effectively improve the stability and steering safety of the four-wheel <b>independent</b> steering <b>vehicle...</b>|$|R
