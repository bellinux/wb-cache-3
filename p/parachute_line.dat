40|$|At {{touchdown}} Orion must be aligned so {{that the}} crew person's feet are forward {{in the direction of}} the horizontal velocity. To ensure that this requirement is met active heading control is being implemented on the Orion crew module. This technique reduces probability of roll-over during splashdown, assures axial loads on the crew at touchdown, and alleviates structural requirements on impact allowing for a light-weight structural design. On-board sensors are used to measure current vehicle orientation and horizontal velocity used in generation of the heading error signal. Linear velocity measured by the IMU drifts while under parachutes due to wind gusts and has to be corrected by GPS; this makes GPS critical for successful landing. Jet fire logic is achieved by use of a phase-plane and commands are realized by using roll jets from the reaction control system (RCS); using pre existing hardware eliminates additional hardware and structural requirements. Touchdown performance is measured by an orientation envelope that was co-developed with structures {{so that the}} performance requirements overlap adding system redundancy. Heading control also introduces new difficulties to be addressed such as <b>parachute</b> <b>line</b> twist torque as well as increasing vehicle sensitivity to wind shifts and sea states. Solving these difficulties requires added complexity to flight software as well as increasing the propellant required to achieve successful touchdown. while offering promising results, the criticality of GPS along with a significant propellant cost raises questions on the effectiveness of using touchdown heading control...|$|E

5000|$|The [...] "horseshoe" [...] is an out-of-sequence deployment, {{when the}} <b>parachute</b> <b>lines</b> and bag are {{released}} before the bag drogue and bridle.

New line hook includes expander that opens up two locking loops so <b>parachute</b> <b>lines</b> are pulled through them. Parachutes are packed at high {{pressure to be}} compressed into limited space available in test vehicles...|$|R
50|$|The lack of {{ejection}} seats {{meant that}} the Voskhod crew would return to Earth inside their spacecraft unlike the Vostok cosmonauts who ejected and parachuted down separately. Because of this, a new landing system was developed, which added a small solid-fuel rocket to the <b>parachute</b> <b>lines.</b> It fired as the descent module neared touchdown, providing a softer landing.|$|R
2500|$|Activation {{begins when}} the pilot-chute is thrown out. It inflates and creates drag, pulling the pin {{out of the}} closing loop and {{allowing}} the pilot-chute to pull the deployment bag from the container. The <b>parachute</b> <b>lines</b> are pulled loose from the rubber bands and extend as the canopy starts to open. A rectangular piece of fabric called the [...] "slider" [...] (which separates the <b>parachute</b> <b>lines</b> into four main groups fed through grommets in the four respective corners of the slider) slows {{the opening of the}} parachute and works its way down until the canopy is fully open and the slider is just above the head of the skydiver. The slider slows and controls the deployment of the parachute. Without a slider, the parachute would inflate fast, potentially damaging the parachute fabric and/or suspension lines, as well as causing discomfort, injury or even death of the jumper. During a normal deployment, a skydiver will generally experience a few seconds of intense deceleration, in the realm of 3 to 4 g, while the parachute slows the descent from [...] to approximately 28km/h (17mph).|$|R
50|$|The {{flight was}} also memorable for its {{dramatic}} re-entry. The craft's service module did not separate, so it entered the atmosphere nose-first, leaving cosmonaut Boris Volynov hanging by his restraining straps. As the craft aerobraked, the atmosphere burned through the module. But the craft righted itself before the escape hatch was burned through. Then, the <b>parachute</b> <b>lines</b> tangled and the landing rockets failed, {{resulting in a}} hard landing which broke Volynov's teeth.|$|R

50|$|In {{the case}} of Voskhod 2, an {{inflatable}} exterior airlock was also added to the descent module opposite the entry hatch. The airlock was jettisoned after use. This apparatus was needed because the vehicle avionics and environmental systems were air-cooled, and depressurization in orbit would cause overheating. A solid-fueled braking rocket was also added to the <b>parachute</b> <b>lines</b> to provide for a softer landing at touchdown. This was necessary because, unlike the Vostok, the Voskhod descent module landed with the crewmen still inside.|$|R
5000|$|The M3 was {{initially}} issued with a riveted leather M6 scabbard with a protective guard {{designed to prevent}} the point from piercing the sheath and injuring the wearer. [...] A rawhide thong {{on the end of}} the sheath allowed the user to tie the sheathed knife to his leg. [...] U.S. paratroopers frequently wore an M3 and sheath tied to a boot for emergency use in cutting <b>parachute</b> <b>lines</b> or close-quarters defense. The M6 was later dropped in favor of the M8 scabbard.|$|R
5000|$|All ram-air parafoils {{have two}} layers of fabric—top and bottom—connected by airfoil-shaped fabric ribs to form [...] "cells". The cells fill with high {{pressure}} air from vents that face forward {{on the leading edge}} of the airfoil. The fabric is shaped and the <b>parachute</b> <b>lines</b> trimmed under load such that the ballooning fabric inflates into an airfoil shape. This airfoil is sometimes maintained by use of fabric one-way valves called airlocks. The first ram-air test jump was performed by United States Navy test jumper Joe Crotwell.|$|R
5000|$|The {{town was}} named after Parachute Creek, that flowed into town from the northwest. According to legend, {{a member of the}} Hayden Survey in 1879 noted that the {{watershed}} patterns of the Roan Plateau, north of present-day <b>Parachute,</b> resembled <b>parachute</b> <b>lines</b> and chose the name [...] "Parachute" [...] for the area. On maps of the area, several streams converge on the town like the shroud <b>lines</b> of a <b>parachute,</b> and the arc of the ridge line above the streams resembles the canopy of a parachute.|$|R

2500|$|In the Palomares {{incident}} of 17 January 1966, a hydrogen bomb {{was lost in}} the Mediterranean Sea when a B-52 bomber collided with a KC-135 tanker near Palomares, Spain. [...] The bomb was located, at a depth of , by the United States Navy submersible DSV Alvin after a 2½ month search. [...] After Alvin was unsuccessful in recovering the bomb, the Navy brought in CURV-I. [...] CURV-I was successful in attaching grapnels to the bomb but became entangled in the bomb’s <b>parachute</b> <b>lines.</b> [...] The entangled bomb, parachute, and CURV-I were successfully raised together to the surface 81 days after the original incident.|$|R
50|$|On April 5, 1975, Soyuz 7K-T No.39, {{the second}} stage of a Soyuz rocket {{carrying}} 2 cosmonauts to the Salyut 4 space station malfunctioned, resulting in the first manned launch abort. The cosmonauts were carried several thousand miles downrange and became worried that they would land in China, which the Soviet Union was then having difficult relations with. The capsule hit a mountain, sliding down a slope and almost slid off a cliff; fortunately the <b>parachute</b> <b>lines</b> snagged on trees and kept this from happening. As it was, the two suffered severe injuries and the commander, Lazerev, never flew again.|$|R

50|$|The Voskhod 2 {{spacecraft}} was a Vostok spacecraft with a backup, {{solid fuel}} retrorocket, attached atop the descent module. The ejection seat was removed and two seats were added, (at a 90-degree angle {{relative to the}} Vostok crew seats position). An inflatable exterior airlock was also added to the descent module opposite the entry hatch. After use, the airlock was jettisoned. There was no provision for crew escape {{in the event of}} a launch or landing emergency. A solid fuel braking rocket was also added to the <b>parachute</b> <b>lines</b> to provide for a softer landing at touchdown. This was necessary because, unlike the Vostok, the crew landed with the Voskhod descent module.|$|R
50|$|Rescue {{swimmers}} {{have been}} used for air-sea rescue work to assist in picking up survivors who are not able to reach the rescue craft, especially those incapacitated by exposure to cold water. Since the mid-1980s when standards were set down for their instruction and implementation, rescue swimmers have deployed from rescue helicopters or rescue boats and have been trained to extricate downed airmen from fouled <b>parachute</b> <b>lines</b> and ejection seats. Rescue swimmers must meet a number of difficult requirements: their physical conditioning must be kept at a high level, they must be expert in first aid treatment methods, and they are often highly trained technicians crucial to the operation of the rescue craft.|$|R
5000|$|Spider web silk is {{as strong}} as the Kevlar used in {{bulletproof}} vests. Engineers could in principle use such a material, if it could be reengineered to have a long enough life, for <b>parachute</b> <b>lines,</b> suspension bridge cables, artificial ligaments for medicine, and other purposes. Other research has proposed adhesive glue from mussels, solar cells made like leaves, fabric that emulates shark skin, harvesting water from fog like a beetle, and more. Murray's law, which in conventional form determined the optimum diameter of blood vessels, has been re-derived to provide simple equations for the pipe or tube diameter which gives a minimum mass engineering system. Aircraft wing design [...] and flight techniques are being inspired by birds and bats.|$|R

5000|$|A [...] "horseshoe" [...] {{describes}} a malfunction where a parachute deploys, but remains {{attached to a}} skydiver by its risers {{and at least one}} other point. This prevents the canopy from opening properly and the canopy and lines form a horseshoe shape extending from the risers up and then back down again to the other point where the parachute remains attached to or entangled with the skydiver. This malfunction may occur when the closing pin of a skydiving rig is released from the closing loop and allows the deployment bag to separate from the container. Because the pilot chute is still stowed, the malfunction takes on the shape of a horseshoe. This malfunction may also occur if the pilot chute or bridle connecting the pilot chute to the canopy becomes entangled with the skydiver. It is possible, though rare, to experience this type of malfunction when one or more <b>parachute</b> <b>lines</b> entangle with or snag on some portion of the parachute rig.|$|R

The An-26 made its public debut at the 27th Paris Air Show at Le Bourget where the second prototype, CCCP-26184 (c/n00202), was shown in the static aircraft park.|$|R
50|$|The wake is {{the region}} of {{disturbed}} flow (often turbulent) downstream of a solid body moving through a fluid, caused by {{the flow of the}} fluid around the body. For a blunt body in subsonic external flow, for example the Apollo or Orion capsules during descent and landing, the wake is massively separated and behind the body is a reverse flow region where the flow is moving toward the body. This phenomenon is often observed in wind tunnel testing of aircraft, and is especially important when parachute systems are involved, because unless the <b>parachute</b> <b>lines</b> extend the canopy beyond the reverse flow region, the chute can fail to inflate and thus collapse. Parachutes deployed into wakes suffer dynamic pressure deficits which reduce their expected drag forces. High-fidelity computational fluid dynamics simulations are often undertaken to model wake flows, although such modeling has uncertainties associated with turbulence modeling (for example RANS versus LES implementations), in addition to unsteady flow effects. Example applications include rocket stage separation and aircraft store separation.|$|R
