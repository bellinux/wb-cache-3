40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the project was}} to develop a novel <b>package</b> <b>plant</b> using available process technologies that would be competitive in the domestic waste water treatment market. A market analysis identified the business opportunity for Balmoral Tanks to develop a <b>package</b> <b>plant</b> with higher treatment capability than its current product. A customer survey and a review of Regulatory standards provided valuable input into the design considerations for the <b>package</b> <b>plant.</b> A review of available process technologies and materials of construction resulted in the selection of a Moving Bed Biolm Reactor (MBBR) process and High Density Polyethylene material as the optimum design basis for the <b>package</b> <b>plant.</b> A detailed design exercise scoped out and specified all the components of the MBBR <b>package</b> <b>plant.</b> A four month duration programme for testing the prototype at Cranfield University facilities was devised which satisfactorily simulated typical domestic wastewater treatment operating conditions. Test rig problems associated with very low ambient temperatures were experienced {{in the early stages of}} testing and were identified and resolved. The prototype <b>package</b> <b>plant</b> unit subsequently operated satisfactorily and the performance was demonstrated to meet all the wastewater constituent removal design specifications. The MBBR process performance was shown to be consistent with published findings of other researchers. Novel fabrication methods developed by Balmoral Tanks resulted in the cost of the new MBBR <b>package</b> <b>plant</b> being only 3 % higher than that of Balmoral Tanks current lower specification product. The new MBBR <b>package</b> <b>plant</b> is shown to be a potentially very marketable domestic wastewater treatment product...|$|E

Water-borne chemicals and microbial pathogens pose a health risk to anyone living downstream from sewage treatment facilities. This study assessed the effluent from a <b>package</b> <b>plant</b> with a design capacity of 48 kℓ/ 24 hours, servicing 12 household units and a restaurant in Mogale City. Over a 12 month period, fortnightly water samples were collected from ten selected sites including two boreholes, a river and two dams. Standard parameters including physical (pH, EC, temperature, DO and SS), chemical (nutrient concentration) and biological (bacterial counts) were analysed using handheld meters, standard membrane filter techniques and colorimetric methods. One borehole was affected by pathogen and nitrate runoff from an adjacent poultry farm. If regularly monitored, the <b>package</b> <b>plant</b> effectively removed microbes (most samples contained 0 cfu/ 100 mℓ) but above limit COD, ammonia and phosphate was released in the effluent (with maximum values of 322 mg/ℓ, 42. 52 mg/ℓ and 7. 18 mg/ℓ, respectively).

The system was found to produce an effluent comparable to <b>package</b> <b>plant</b> effluents with respect to BOD 5 and suspended solids but superior with respect to reliability and fecal coliforms. Disposal of the treated effluent to the soil through absorption trenches or to the sea through a short outfall are the most appropriate disposal methods, although reuse for irrigation after disinfection can also be practiced. The initial capital cost of the system is at most half the cost of the conventional package plants and the operation and maintenance expenditure negligible.

40|$|A {{modern and}} {{efficient}} sewerage system {{is vital for}} the country, to ensure that waste water is treated before the effluent being discharged into the waterways (eg. Lake, river and sea). Sewage Treatment Plants (STP) is designed to collect, treat and dispose human waste and other wastewaters generated from urban dwellings and commercial facilities. Since the treatment of sewerage is a vital and continuous activity, the sewage treatment plant must be managed and functioned judiciously. Upgrading the existing wastewater treatment plant systems refers {{to a variety of}} design and operational technique to improve the performance or increase plant capacity. Thus, the aim {{of this study is to}} evaluate the workability and effectiveness of the use of <b>Package</b> <b>Plant</b> System for upgrading the conventional treatment plant in order to meet the standard requirement. This study discussed on the Sewage Treatment Plant in Malaysia and also analysed problems that often face in operating and maintaining the conventional treatment plant. The methodology adopted for this study are through literature to understand the scenario of the existing Sewage Treatment Plant (STP), gathering information and data from questionnaire survey and case studies conducted. The result of the study shows that the upgrading of existing sewage treatment plant is recommended after considering the limitations of the performance of STPs. Apart of that, it is also important to upgrade the performance of STP to maintain their efficiency and reliability.

40|$|Operation and {{maintenance}} (O&M) problems cut across al l types and sizes of water treatment plants in South Africa because of various reasons ranging from institutional arrangements to actual {{operation of the}} works. The {{aim of the research}} project was to optimise the operation {{and maintenance}} of two small water treatment plants in Limpopo and apply the lessons learned to the other small treatment plants in Limpopo and Mpumalanga. The research involved going to the two identified small water treatment plants (for {{the purpose of this study}} they were labelled Plant A and B) in Limpopo province to evaluate the process units from the raw water abstraction to final treated water that is then reticulated into the consumers. There were major problems identified in Plant A; ranging from cracked rapid sand filters, inadequate raw water source(dries up during winter),unattended or long response times to defective items reported by operators. In Plant B problems range from old and clogged fi lter media in the pressure sand fi lters, wrongly or inappropriate instal lations of dosing pipes, installation of an additional <b>package</b> <b>plant</b> which its parts and maintenance technicians are not locally available (imported from Brazil), connection of two clear water tanks by a pipe without valve in between for control purposes [...] Both Plants A and B had poor budgeting for operation and maintenance and the Process Control lers were not motivated to do their work due to lack of proper management and control.

40|$|Without the {{planning}} of non-technical issues, water treatment plants may face challenges in sustaining safe drinking water. Parameters such as {{the planning}} of financial resources, human resources, a lack of professional process controllers, poor working conditions, staff shortages {{and a lack of}} appropriate training of process controllers contribute to the underperformance of drinking water treatment plants. This study aimed at applying the Diagnostic Tool for Non-Technical Compliance to assess the compliance of small drinking water plants with management norms. Six water treatments (Vondo water scheme, Malamulele, Mutshedzi, Mutale regional water treatment plant, Tshedza and Tshedza <b>package</b> <b>plant)</b> were selected from the Vhembe district municipality of the Limpopo province in South Africa. From the abovementioned non-technical parameters, the results showed that during the first assessment period (August 2008 and June 2009) selected water treatment plants scored between 53 % and 68 % and fell under Class 2, indicating serious challenges requiring attention and improvement. During the second assessment period (November and December 2010), a slight improvement was observed as all plants scored between 72 % and 80 %, falling under the Class 2 category. Even after corrective actions and remeasurement, none of the plants met the compliance standards, which range from 90 % to 100 % to obtain the Class 1 compliance standard. The study recommended that tactical and strategic plans that clearly define the operational procedures, process controlling, financial planning, maintenance culture, emergency preparedness and regular monitoring and evaluation should be entrenched for the smooth running of the small water treatment plants. Furthermore, all water services providers and water services authorities should apply the diagnostic tools as developed, which provides guidance on a stepwise procedure on plant operations and management on a daily basis...|$|E
40|$|UnrestrictedMethyl {{tertiary}} butyl ether (MTBE) {{is used as}} a {{fuel additive}} to reduce air pollution. However, the threat to public health from MTBE contaminated groundwater prompted the legislature to ban MTBE. Through the years, numerous methods have been developed to treat MTBE, and many of these advanced treatment processes are complicated and costly. The present research investigates the development of a simple and cost-effective process for the degradation of MTBE.; Chain reactions involving ultrasound and Fenton's reagent are the epitome of this system. Fenton's reagent can be continuously supplied by sonolysis of water and naturally occurring metal salts in groundwater. The laboratory test results have shown complete MTBE degradation under the ultrasound-assisted chemical process (UACP) within one hour. For subsurface operations in the field, ultrasonic transducers attached on the double-wall pipe and horizontal directional drilling technology can greatly increase the effective area of in-situ remediation.; A whistle type in-line mixer installed in a re-circulating flow loop without external electric power was used to create hydrodynamic cavitation and induce oxidation in UACP. Experimental data have shown 13 percent addition to 75 percent degradation of MTBE by Fenton's reagent in five minutes.; The groundwater systems usually only have a water pump and a disinfection process. Once there is a MTBE plume approaching, the only choice for them is to shut down the production wells unless they have enough funding. Equipment wise, UACP only needs chemical pump and ultrasonic transducer. This allows for low cost, easy installation, convenient maintenance, and easy decommissioning. Therefore, UACP with in-line mixer {{can be used as a}} drinking water <b>package</b> <b>plant</b> to benefit small water systems in rural communities.; Furthermore, UACP can be placed at the start of a treatment chain to avoid contamination breakthrough, placed at the end of a treatment chain as a polishing step, or added to the distribution systems to solve disinfection by-product problem...|$|E

The system included primary clarification and sludge storage facilities, and a 0. 55 m (1. 8 ft) disc diameter, 20. 9 m^ 2 (225 ft^ 2) four-stage rotating disc treatment unit. The test unit was tested at four hydraulic loadings of 0. 09 to 0. 27 m^ 3 /day/m^ 2 (2. 25 - 6. 7 gpd/ft^ 2). Peripheral rotational disc speed was constant at 0. 3 m/s (1. 0 fps) and waste water temperate was 27 °C to 28 °C during the study. 	At hydraulic loadings of 0. 09 to 0. 27 m^ 3 /day/m^ 2 (2. 25 - 6. 7 gpd/ft^ 2) of disc area, the test unit achieved respectively 94 to 82 % overall removal of carbonaceous BOD 5 and 96 to 82 % overall removal of suspended solids when treating degritted raw domestic waste water. This yielded effluent concentrations of 12 to 32 mg/l BOD 5 and 7 to 21 mg/l suspended solids. Sludge production from the disc section was 0. 40 to 0. 50 mass units sludge produced per mass unit BOD 5 removed in the disc section. 	Low maintenance requirements, low power consumption, and resistance {{to the effects of}} hydraulic surges make the rotating disc process very attractive for <b>package</b> <b>plant</b> installations in Hawaii. In-place equipment cost for rotating disc package systems treating sewage volumes of 94. 5 m^ 3 /day (25, 000 gpd) and 378 m^ 3 /day (100, 000 gpd) were estimated to be about 10 % higher than for extended aeration and high-rate activated sludge package systems. However, the total annual cost over a 20 -yr period was respectively about 14 % and 20 % lower for the rotating disc package systems than the extended aeration and high-rate activated sludge package systems...|$|E
