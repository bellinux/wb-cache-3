40|$|Abstract— In recent years, the {{occurrence}} of <b>protein</b> <b>shortage</b> of children under 5 years old in many poor area has dramatically increased. Since this situation can cause serious problem to children like a delay in their growth, delay in their development and also disfigurement, disability, dependency, the early diagnose of <b>protein</b> <b>shortage</b> is vital. Many applications have been developed in performing disease detection such as an expert system for diagnosing diabetics and artificial neural network (ANN) applications for diagnosing breast cancer, acidosis diseases, and lung cancer. This paper is mainly focusing {{on the development of}} <b>protein</b> <b>shortage</b> disease diagnosing application using Backpropagation Neural Network (BPNN) technique. It covers two classes of <b>protein</b> <b>shortage</b> that are Heavy Protein Deficiency. On top of this, a BPNN model is constructed based on result analysis of the training and testing from the developed application. The model has been successfully tested using new data set.

This paper presents the design and implementation of an aquacultural development decision support system (ADDSS) that would systematically aid the planner in making choices regarding the development planning of the aquaculture industry for a given region. The system is composed of three main components: a model base containing all relevant models which are essentially multiple objective in nature, a database containing all relevant data, and a dialog component providing a user interface to the other two components of the system. The application of ADDSS is demonstrated through a case study from Northern Egypt where aquaculture appears as a viable industry for supplying cheap and good quality protein, balancing the foreign exchange deficits, improving the standard o...|$|R

Following World War II, many Europeans were starving, and many Malthusians attributed this {{not only to the}} war, but also to the inability of the world to produce enough food to support the increasing population. According to a 1946 FAO report, the world would need to produce 25 to 35% more food in 1960 than in 1939 {{to keep up with the}} increasing population, while health improvements would require a 90 to 100% increase. Because meat was costly and energy-intensive to produce, <b>protein</b> <b>shortages</b> were also an issue. Increasing cultivated area alone would go only so far in providing adequate nutrition to the population. The USDA calculated that, to feed the U.S. population by 1975, it would have to add 200 million acres (800,000 km²) of land, but only 45 million were available. One way to combat national food shortages was to increase the land available for farmers, yet the American frontier and farm land had long since been extinguished in trade for expansion and urban life. Hopes rested solely on new agricultural techniques and technologies. Because of these circumstances, an alternative solution was needed.|$|R
40|$|Insects {{are part}} of the {{traditional}} diets of approximately 2 billion people worldwide. Insects can contribute to food security and {{be a part of the}} solution to <b>protein</b> <b>shortages,</b> given their high nutritional value, low emissions of greenhouse gases, low requirements for land and water, and the high efficiency at which they can convert feed into food. This article outlines the potential of insects as a food for humans as well as a feedstock for animals and fish. The majority of insects consumed in developing countries today are harvested in nature from wild populations. In Western countries, the disgust factor in considering insects as food, combined currently with their limited availability on the market, and a lack of regulations governing insects as food and feed, are major barriers for their further expansion. However, the biggest opportunity may well lie in the production of insect biomass as feedstock for animals and fish, to partly replace the increasingly expensive protein ingredients of compound feeds in the livestock industries. Considering the immense quantities of insect biomass needed to replace current protein-rich ingredients such as meal from fish and soybeans, automated mass rearing facilities need to be developed. For this to occur, significant technological innovations, changes in consumer food preferences, insect-encompassing food and feed legislation, and progress towards more sustainable food production systems are needed. The close collaboration of government, food and feed industry, media, chefs, and academia will be essential for success...|$|R
40|$|Ruminant {{production}} {{that is very}} popular in Nigeria livestock production faces series of problems, chief {{among them is the}} <b>shortage</b> of <b>protein</b> supply in adequate amount for optimum performance of the animals. The forages, which constitute the bulk of the source of feed for these animals, fluctuate in supply with poor nutrient content especially during the dry season of the year. The convectional protein concentrates which boost the protein supply faces intense competition from man. It has become imperative for intensive effort to be made at making the unconventional sources of protein available to the farmers. Neem seed cake/ kernel cake fits as one of the unconventional protein supply in view of the high level of the protein content and balancing of the amino acids. It is capable of offering a big relief to these <b>protein</b> <b>shortages.</b> The neem seed is readily available {{in the northern part of}} Nigeria that is the home to the largest of number of ruminants in the country.

Overall, this study aimed to utilize protein supplements effectively to guide dietary formulations to increase milk yield and save plant protein resources. To this end, we studied four cows with a permanent rumen fistula and duodenal T-shape fistula in a 4 × 4 Latin square experimental design. The {{results showed that the}} total small intestine absorbable amino acids and small intestine absorbable essential amino acids were higher in the SBM (26. 34 % and 13. 11 % dry matter [DM], respectively) than in the SFM (13. 97 % and 6. 89 % DM, respectively). The small intestine absorbable Lys contents of the SFM, SSM, RSM and SBM were 0. 86 %, 0. 88 %, 1. 43 %, and 2. 12 % (DM basis), respectively, and the absorbable Met contents of these meals were 0. 28 %, 1. 03 %, 0. 52 %, and 0. 47 % (DM basis), respectively.

40|$|Aquaculture {{production}} is increasing annualy and wild fisheries for fishmeal production remain stagnant. As a consequence, extensive {{research has been}} deployed to reduce dietary fishmeal inclusion in feeds of farmed species. Usage of alternative protein sources derived from plants continues to increase with the most popular sources being oilseeds, legumes and cereal grains. The downside of these sources {{is that most of}} them could directly be used for human consumption arising legitimate criticism from voices referring to countries where <b>protein</b> <b>shortages</b> lead to malnutrition among the population. Jatropha curcas is a tropical oilseed with upcoming popularity for sustainable fuel sourcing. The plant is thought to thrive in semi-arid and arid areas, not just producing oil, {{but at the same time}} reclaiming previously eroded land for the local population. For these reasons, annual cultivation of Jatropha curcas is thought to rise over the next decades. After oil is extracted from the seed, the remaining press cake, is currently used as a fertilizer or energy source. This is mostly due to toxic phorbol esters that until recent- ly limited any nutritional applications. In 2011, a method to detoxify Jatropha press cake was developed and paved the way for nutritional research on the resulting detoxified Jatropha curcas kernel meal (JKM) to be launched. JKM offers very high protein content with a balanced amino acid composition suggesting opportunities for usage as a feedstuff in aquaculture diets. JKM further has higher mineral content than comparable oilseeds. However, potential anti-nutritional factors (ANFs) present in the meal could lead to impairment of nutrient availability or other adverse effects. Previous research has already started to evaluate JKM as a protein source for a variety of aquaculture species. This thesis attempts to further identify the potential of JKM as a protein source and assess the effects of JKM on the development of two model cultured teleost species, common carp (Cyprinus carpio) and Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus), as they represent two of the most farmed species, particularly in the tropics. The work comprises growth trials on both species using fishmeal as a subject of replacement in solely fishmeal protein-based diets and on more practical fishmeal/plant protein-based diets. It engages with the effects of phytate, a prominent component of JKM with potential anti-nutritional attributes and commercially available phytase feed supplements to diminish these attributes, as well as oxalate, another plant-specific component with high concentrations in JKM and with limited attention in aquaculture nutrition research. Carp and tilapia showed varying results with different inclusion levels of JKM. For carp 50...|$|R

Results We report here the development of an enhancer-blocking assay for studying insulator activity in Drosophila cultured cells. We show that the activities of diverse Drosophila insulators including suHw, SF 1, SF 1 b, Fab 7 and Fab 8 are supported in these cells. We further show that double stranded RNA (dsRNA) -mediated knockdown of SuHw and dCTCF factors disrupts the enhancer-blocking function of suHw and Fab 8, respectively, thereby establishing the effectiveness of using RNA interference in our cell-based assay for probing insulator function. Conclusion The novel boundary assay provides a quantitative and efficient method for analyzing insulator mechanism and can be further exploited in genome-wide RNAi screens for insulator components.

The complex of diseases re-lated to protein-calorie malnutrition, kwashiorkor.

In normal fed rats, cholecystokinin had no effect on brown adipose tissue or growth, while, in severely food intake-restricted rats, it caused brown adipose tissue hypertrophy and reduced growth. In moderately food intake-restricted rats, both cholecystokinin and simmondsin induced pancreatic hypertrophy, increased brown adipose weight and metabolism and caused a slight decrease in growth. We conclude that cholecystokinin may decrease growth performance in fast growing severely food intake-restricted rats by stimulating brown adipose tissue metabolism, probably because of <b>protein</b> <b>shortage</b> induced by pancreatic hyperstimulation.

40|$|Refuelling by {{migratory birds}} before {{take-off}} on long flights {{is generally considered}} a two-phase process, with protein accumulation preceding rapid fat deposition.

40|$|International audiencePlants {{display a}} number of {{responses}} to low iron availability {{in order to increase}} iron uptake from the soil. In the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, the ferric-chelate reductase FRO 2 and the ferrous iron transporter IRT 1 control iron entry from the soil into the root epidermis. To maintain iron homeostasis, the expression of FRO 2 and IRT 1 is tightly controlled by iron deficiency at the transcriptional level. The basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor FIT represents the most upstream actor known in the iron-deficiency signaling pathway, and directly regulates the expression of the root iron uptake machinery genes FRO 2 and IRT 1. However, how FIT is controlled by iron and acts to activate transcription of its targets remains obscure. Here we show that FIT mRNA and endogenous FIT protein accumulate in Arabidopsis roots upon iron deficiency. However, using plants constitutively expressing FIT, we observed that FIT protein accumulation is reduced in iron-limited conditions. This post-transcriptional regulation of FIT is perfectly synchronized with the accumulation of endogenous FIT and IRT 1 proteins, and therefore is part of the early responses to low iron. We demonstrated that such regulation affects FIT protein stability under iron deficiency as a result of 26 S proteasome-dependent degradation. In addition, we showed that FIT post-translational regulation by iron is required for FRO 2 and IRT 1 gene expression. Taken together our results indicate that FIT transcriptional and post-translational regulations are integrated in plant roots to ensure that the positive regulator FIT accumulates as a short-lived <b>protein</b> following iron <b>shortage,</b> and to allow proper iron-deficiency responses...|$|R

Diets were compared in which part of the silage from intensively managed grassland was replaced with 0 % (100 IM), 20 % (20 SPP), 40 % (40 SPP) or 60 % (60 SPP) silage from species-poor semi-natural grassland or with 60 % silage from species-rich semi-natural grassland (60 SPR). On a dry matter basis, the total mixed ration (TMR) contained 63 % grass silage, 18 % maize silage and 19 % concentrates. Concentrates were either low or high in protein to prevent <b>protein</b> surpluses or <b>shortages.</b> High producing cows were offered additional concentrates in concentrate boxes. The additional concentrates had the same composition as the concentrates in the TMR. With the 60 SPP diet voluntary daily intake decreased by 1. 4 kg DM cow− 1 day− 1. Uncorrected milk production was {{the same for all}} diets, but milk fat yield was lower with the 60 SPP diet and milk protein yield lower with the 60 SPR diet than with the other diets. No statistically significant differences in fat and protein corrected milk production were observed between the 100 IM and the 20 SPP diet. The fat and protein corrected milk production with the other diets was significantly lower than with 100 IM. All cows gained body weight, but there were no statistically significant differences between diets.

The vast majority of Atlantic salmon sold in the United States is “farm raised” salmon, which are salmon that never swim freely in any body of water other than a fish pen. This system of fish farming is known as aquaculture. The global production of salmon, which exceeded one million tons in 2008, is the top aquaculture money maker. Moreover, aquaculture accounts for seventythree percent of global salmon production. Aquaculture allows for greater control of production and also helps deter the overfishing of already fragile wild Atlantic salmon populations. Increasingly, however, the aquaculture process has been subject to criticisms relating to the prevalence of disease and sea lice in its products, the frequency of species escape, and the creation of “dead zones” from highly concentrated waste. Additionally, there is a growing awareness that the antibiotics used on farmed salmon may not be healthy for human consumption. More significantly, the depleted state of wild fisheries places increased demand on the production capacities of aquaculture. In order to make salmon aquaculture a more viable and productive business, scientists have begun creating genetically modified (GM) Atlantic salmon with various traits. With the production of the AquAdvantage Salmon (AAS), which grows up to four times larger than traditional Atlantic salmon because of the introduction of growth hormone genes from other fish, AquaBounty Technologies (AquaBounty) has {{been at the forefront of}} genetic modification in Atlantic salmon. AquaBounty markets the AAS as a panacea for fish farming issues and global <b>protein</b> <b>shortages.</b> The patenting and production of GM salmon, however, presents a number of potential risks, including food safety, market dominance over a very important food source, and various property issues resulting from AAS escaping and cross-breeding with wild salmon. This last consideration is the focus of this comment. If AAS escapes and either out-competes the native salmon populations or mates with them and forever alters their genetic makeup, then this will result in a showdown of competing legal interests. Conventional Atlantic salmon fishermen (hereinafter non-GM fishermen) and public stakeholders in wild Atlantic salmon have certain property interests based on the public trust doctrine. Biotechnology companies, such as AquaBounty, arguably have a more discrete and enforceable property interest based on their patent of AAS. Few parties dispute AquaBounty’s right to protect and produce its patented fish so long as the fish remain in AquaBounty’s production sites. But what will happen if AquaBounty’s fish escape into the wild? No case law definitively resolves this question. This paper, therefore, relies on an analogy to case law addressing the capture of wildlife and patent infringement of GM plants. Because the factual details in these two areas of GM plant law may differ from those in the GM animals context, the following hypothetical escape scenario is offered as the factual foundation of a potential lawsuit against non-GM fishermen for infringement of an AAS patent: The AAS has been mass produced at a number of New England aquaculture sites with great success. One night, however, the combination of a power outage and a huge storm compromises a low containment system at an aquaculture site. A number of AAS escape and populate the surrounding area. Resulting generations, which may be wild-AAS hybrids or simply second generation AAS, express the same genes for increased growth and cold resistance that AquaBounty patented in AAS. After a couple of years, the AAS fish farm discovers that its revenues have been decreasing by a small margin and traces this decrease to greater competition at a local fish market. After sending an experienced AAS representative to the market, the fish farm realizes—based on anecdotal evidence from the fishermen and increased growth characteristics of the fish—that these fish are likely wild-AAS hybrids. The representative buys some of the fish and discovers that they contain the patented genes of AAS. AquaBounty, which has a license with the fish farm to maintain its intellectual property rights in AAS, sues the fishermen for infringement. At trial, the fishermen discover that there is no such thing as an “innocent infringer” and find themselves responsible for damages to AquaBounty for lost profits. Two major issues must be addressed: How can non-GM fishermen protect their property interests in native salmon given the threat of escape in a pre-escape market? How should property rights be determined in a post-escape market? This Comment explores these two questions through the lenses of wildlife law and patent law. Part II looks to the AAS itself and answers many of the questions about how it is produced, how it is contained, and how the current production and containment systems will change significantly when the focus moves from research and development to large-scale production for consumption. Part III looks to traditional legal concepts of property ownership in wild animals and shows how the traditional concept of capture, when applied to the unique circumstances of GM animals, leaves more questions than answers about how to determine possession of AAS. It then explores the public trust doctrine as an alternative means of protection for non-GM fishermen. Part IV shows how the existing state of GM patent law favors biotechnology companies over non-GM farmers and fisherman, whether or not they intend to infringe the GM organism patent. Finally, Part V concludes that this uncomfortable relationship between these two traditional approaches to property law and GM animals requires judicial and legislative adjustment to provide for equitable treatment of non-GM fishermen subject to unintentional infringement suits. It also offers three existing pre-escape remedies to act as preemptive measures against possible infringement suits and one post-escape response to infringement suits...|$|R
40|$|The Southern African Development Community (SADC) region {{includes}} 15 {{member states}} which all face growing population numbers {{and a possible}} <b>protein</b> <b>shortage</b> within the next 20 years. Although these countries have a wealth of livestock genetic resources and mostly are quite agriculturally dependent, there exist clear limitations and challenges regarding animal recording, genetic improvement, production efficiency and the implementation of new technologies, such as genomic selection (GS). Genomic selection incorporates genomic information with phenotypic information (breeding values) to derive genomic estimated breeding values (GEBV) and leads to an increased rate of genetic improvement. The countries within the SADC region are in several stages of development with regard to agriculture and infrastructural development and this limits the implementation of advanced technologies. The establishing of reference populations seems beyond the capacity of most of these countries at present, mainly in terms of financial viability, infrastructural support and national cohesion. Genomic technology however holds potential for the introgression of favourable genes in resource-poor livestock production systems and traceability of livestock products. Furthermore,identification of traits associated with adaptability and disease resistance and unique products would contribute to food security on various levels. This review discusses interventions that may mitigate constraints, and proposes key research areas needed for addressing the limitations mentioned.

40|$|Fish is the {{cheapest}} animal protein source in Nigeria and dry fish, in particular, {{has the potential}} to solve the pervasive <b>protein</b> <b>shortage</b> problem owing to its relative affordability compared with fresh fish. Boosting dry fish consumption will entail retail price reduction which is achievable only if the market for dry fish operates efficiently. This study, after testing and correcting price series for non-stationarity, modelled marketing efficiency in 66 pairs of spatially separated markets. The unit root test was used to reveal the order of econometric integration of the price series. All price series showed non-stationarity at their levels (P< 0. 05) but on first-differencing, they all rejected the null hypothesis of non-stationarity. This confirmed that they were generated by the same stochastic processes and thus capable of exhibiting long-run spatial equilibrium. The vector auto-regressive test showed that 59. 1 % of the markets had prices which were spatially integrated on the long-run. The Granger causality model revealed that prices in Bauchi, Akure, Makurdi and kano markets were driving prices in other locations. Kano market exhibited very strong exogeneity while others were either strongly or weakly exogenous. It is concluded that there is low extent of spatial pricing efficiency in Nigeria‟s dry fish market. The study recommended improved market infrastructures, improved information collection, collation and dissemination and decisive policy reforms aimed at lowering retail price at the identified leader markets, as ways of enhancing spatial pricing efficiency...|$|E
40|$|Protein status elicits {{compensatory}} {{changes in}} food intake and food preferences 1 – 3 Sanne Griffioen-Roose, Monica Mars, Els Siebelink, Graham Finlayson, Daniel Tomé, and Cees de Graaf Background: Protein is an indispensable component within the human diet. It is unclear, however, whether behavioral strategies exist to avoid shortages. Objective: The {{objective was to}} investigate the effect of a low protein status compared with a high protein status on food intake and food preferences. Design: We used a randomized crossover design that consisted of a 14 -d fully controlled dietary intervention involving 37 subjects [mean 6 SD age: 21 6 2 y; BMI (in kg/m 2) : 21. 9 6 1. 5] who consumed individualized, isoenergetic diets that were either low in protein [0. 5 g protein kg body weight (BW) 21 d 21] or high in protein (2. 0 g protein kg BW 21 d 21). The diets were followed by an ad libitum phase of 2. 5 d, during which a large array of food items was available, and protein and energy intakes were measured. Results:We showed that in the ad libitum phase protein intake was 13 % higher after the low-protein diet than after the high-protein diet (253 6 70 compared with 225 6 63 g, P, 0. 001), whereas total energy intake was not different. The higher intake of protein was evident throughout the ad libitum phase of 2. 5 d. In addition, after the low-protein diet, food preferences for savory high-protein foods were enhanced. Conclusions: After a protein deficit, food intake and food prefer-ences show adaptive changes that suggest that compensatory mech-anisms are induced to restore adequate protein status. This indicates that there are human behavioral strategies present to avoid <b>protein</b> <b>shortage</b> and that these involve selection of savory high-protein foods.

40|$|The Namibian meat {{industry}} {{relies on}} the export of weaners to the South African feedlot industry while the largest part of the cattle population in the communal areas of Namibia remain underutilised. Producing a marketable cattle carcass for slaughter, which contributes the most to the Namibian economy, remains a challenge that needs {{a high level of}} understanding of all management variables under control by the rangeland manager. The nutritional requirements of cattle are one the important areas for maximising the return from the land and ensuring long term sustainability of the farming enterprise. A commercial farming enterprise, with the same climate and sandy soils that were predominantly found in the communal farming areas of Namibia, was chosen as experimental site. Three groupings of cattle were exposed to different experimental techniques and treatments over a 15 month trial period. The first grouping of cattle was 6 oesophageal fistulated cattle used, to collect veld samples selected by the cattle, every 3 weeks to estimate the contribution of the tree and shrub savannah towards the diet of the cattle. The second grouping was 110 cattle allocated to different nutrient supplementation treatments for slaughter at 28 months of age. Five different nutrient supplementation treatments were chosen for 5 groups of 22 cattle, consisting of steers and heifers, {{for the duration of the}} period on an ad libitum basis. The 5 treatments were applied to illustrate the economic concept of diminishing marginal returns as the increasing feeding cost progressively deteriorated the amount of profit that would be expected. The optimal supplementation strategy would thus be identified according to the financial resources available to a farmer. Some of the treatments were also planned to progressively result in negative associative effects on forage intake, as energy containing raw materials in such treatments would replace the intake of natural available forage. The need for replacing forage was a common practice in droughts when the availability of forage was limiting or when the finishing of cattle during a short period before slaughter was planned. The cattle needed to be foraging less to conserve energy and thus increase protein accretion and fat deposition. The control of the experiment was the rock salt treatment group (RST) which only received a rock salt lick throughout the dry and wet seasons of the year. This was generally used for the supplementation of wildlife and cattle on rangeland in Namibia and it placed nearly no strain on the finances of a farmer. The remaining four treatments received commercially manufactured lick products with a diverse set of applications that were not strictly used according to the manufacturer's guidelines. During the wet season it was a well-established practice to only supplement with phosphorus and trace mineral containing licks due to the forage having maximum nutritional value during this time in which no additional benefit would be derived from the supplementation of protein and energy containing licks. All treatments, except for the rock salt treatment group (RST), were thus placed on a phosphorus and trace mineral lick during the wet season as part of the nutrient supplementation treatment programs. Different licks were made available to the cattle in the treatment groups, during the dry season, from which the treatment groups derived their names. One group was placed on a phosphorus and trace mineral lick for the duration of the trial, during the wet and dry season, and defined as the 6 % phosphorus treatment group (6 %PT). A maintenance treatment group (MTT) received protein in addition to phosphorus in the lick during the dry season. The production treatment group (PDT) received energy containing raw materials in addition to the minerals and protein as established in the MTT. The finisher treatment group (FST) received a larger amount of energy containing materials which diluted the mineral and protein concentration of the dry season lick even further than in the PDT. The third experimental procedure was to establish a group of 5 ruminally cannulated cattle that would individually be rotated every 3 weeks between the supplement fed treatment groups. The cattle would then be sampled for ruminal fluid, blood and faeces to observe the short term impact of the supplements during the different seasons on these variables and the diagnostic value of these parameters to indicate the nutritional status of cattle. The results clearly illustrated that the cattle had exhibited “nutritional wisdom”. The selection of higher quality plant material than what was on offer in the veld was highlighted in a review of previous oesophageal fistulated cattle research. The strong influence of rainfall on the forage quality (increased phosphorus and protein) was highlighted. During spring the phosphorus and protein reached their maximum concentrations. It was only during the wet season that animal performances were optimised when the quantity of high quality forage increased. The average daily ad libitum nutrient supplement consumption per animal on the different treatments was strongly influenced by these seasonal changes in forage quality and quantity. The lick intake increased as the dry season progressed and the quality of the forage the animals were able to select decreased. During spring the lick intake sharply decreased as the forage quality improved. The cattle adapted their intake level with the aim of maximising their energy intake, which resulted in the highest possible performance possible, from the forage and lick that was on offer to them. Monitoring the average monthly lick intake per animal would give valuable information to the farmer on the quality of the forage selected. The trends observed in average lick intake during the year could be used as an inexpensive indicator of veld qualit. An upper threshold could be set on lick intakes that would signal that a specific area was optimally grazed and that a camp rotation would aid in conserving the rangeland and optimise animal performance. The year round supplementation of rock salt lick group (RST), or alternatively no nutrient supplement, under these conditions had clearly shown a minimal contribution to the nutritional status of cattle and that this strategy would lead to certain financial underperformance or ruin of the cattle farmer. From the results presented, the year round supplementation with a phosphorus and trace mineral lick (6 %PT) was indicated as the absolute minimum nutrient supplementation strategy that would need to be followed in all communal and commercial cattle farming areas of Namibia and probably similar farming locations around the world. Free access to phosphorus licks throughout the year to growing cattle must be ensured by the farmer to allow the cattle to select the correct amount that it would require to optimise performance. This strategy required the least amount of capital to implement and had the largest return on investment for a newly established farmer. If limited amounts of energy containing materials (molasses, maize, bran) were included in the nutrient supplement on offer it allowed the animal the opportunity to only consume the minimum amount of phosphorus that it required throughout the year to balance the shortages that occurred in the forage that it was selecting from. The finisher lick given during the dry season on the FST clearly illustrated that salt and phosphorus were poor regulators of supplemental intake if the cattle were able to increase their total energy retention by over consuming and probably excreting of minerals. The optimum nutrient supplementation strategy was the MTT that alleviated the primary phosphorus and secondary <b>protein</b> <b>shortages</b> during the dry season. This strategy had a much higher capital requirement and would be most suitable for the established cattle farmer that was able to afford this strategy or had access to credit. The PDT and FST were associated with higher supplementation costs that resulted in the highest turnover for the cattle farmer, although at lower profit than the MTT. The PDT and FST supplementation strategies would be more appropriate if the improved nutritional status of the cattle was utilised in a cow herd for improved reproduction or in stud farming when genetic expression of growth potential would offset the cost of supplementation.

40|$|Aim of {{the present}} study was to {{evaluate}} the effect of diets with optimal (CP 15 % DM) or suboptimal (CP 12. 3 % DM) protein content, supplemented (CLA+) or not (CLA-) with rumen-protected conjugated linoleic acid (rpCLA) on some cheesemaking properties. Twenty Holstein-Fresian mid lactating dairy cows have been reared following a 4 × 4 Latin square experimental design of 4 periods, 3 weeks each. Individual milk samples, collected during the third week of each period, were analysed for chemical composition, traditional milk coagulation properties (MCP: RCT, k 20 and a 30) and for recording curd firmness (CF) every 15 s over a 90 min period. Data acquired from each sample were used to model CF over time calculating the following parameters: rennet coagulation time (RCTeq), asymptotic potential CF (CFP), CF rate constant (kCF), syneresis rate constant (kCF), maximum CF achieved within 90 min (CFmax) and time to CFmax (tmax). Data were analysed using period, diet and group (random) as sources of variation. Cows evidenced a strong individual variability within groups and were classified as early (RCT 20 min) coagulating cows. Dietary <b>protein</b> <b>shortage</b> reduced milk protein and lactose content, while rpCLA supplementation depressed milk fat synthesis. Results showned that traditional MCP parameters were worsened by reduction of dietary protein in the case of milk produced by early coagulating cows, while rpCLA supplementation affected negatively all three traits on all cows. The study of CF model parameters evidenced that CP 12 diets have improved CF (CFP and CFmax) respect to CP 15 when fed to late coagulating cows while worsened CF (CFP and CFmax) and reduced kCF when fed to early coagulating cows.
