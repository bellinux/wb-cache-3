40|$|Throughout {{the years}} 2008 to 2010, we {{analyzed}} approximately two thousand oriental melon samplescollected from Seongju, using electron microscopy and testing by RT-PCR using primers specific for eightcucurbit-infecting viruses. Data from RT-PCR indicated that Cucumber green mottle mosaic virus (CGMMV),Watermelon mosaic virus 2 (WMV 2) and Zucchini yellow mosaic virus (ZYMV) were {{present and the}} otherviruses were not detected. Among them, CGMMV and WMV 2 were the most prevalent pathogens. CGMMVwas thought to infect oriental melon from the early growing season, and reached nearly 100 % in the later ofgrowing period. Otherwise, WMV 2 emerged from June, several months later compared to CGMMV. CGMMV was detected from all aerial parts of the oriental melon including seeds, but not from the roots ofthe grafted pumpkin rootstock. Seed of two out of five commercial varieties were shown to be CGMMVpositive. Nine varieties of pumpkins used as rootstocks were not infected with CGMMV. When the seedlingsof grafted oriental melon were transplanted into pots mixed with the oriental melon debris infected withCGMMV, they were not infected by CGMMV.

50|$|Christmas tree {{farming is}} a {{relatively}} new agricultural pursuit in Australia with the industry only sprouting up within the early 21st century. There are a number of differences in Christmas tree production in Australia when compared with nations in the Northern Hemisphere. The growing season differs because harvest is during a different time of year, this means that lessons learned about farming in the United States and Europe are more difficult to apply to Australia. The seasonal difference also affects the <b>pruning</b> and <b>shearing</b> schedule for the crop. The other primary difference in Australian Christmas tree farming is found in the type of tree grown, Pinus radiata, which is no longer commonly grown for Christmas trees in the United States and Europe, is popular in Australia.|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{growth of}} native Intermountain West shrub species sheared yearly. Five shrub species with potential {{for use in}} naturalized landscapes and roadside reclamation, silver sage (Artemesia cana), rabitbrush (Chrysothamnus nauseosus), red-stem dogwood (Cornus sericea), chokecherry (Prunus virginiana), and curlleaf mountain mahogany (Cercocarpus ledifolius), were planted as seedlings in summer 1989. From 1991 - 1993, half of the plants were sheared to within 0. 15 m (0. 5 ft) off the ground every spring prior to or at budbreak. Crown height and crown cross-sectional area were measured every year prior to <b>pruning.</b> Significant <b>shearing</b> effects were detected in some shrubs {{the first year after}} shearing, with crown area affected more than height. Height of three species with a multi-stemmed habit, C. nauseosus, A. cana, and C. sericea, was unaffected by shearing both years. Crown area of all species except C. sericea was reduced by shearing. All species were able to regrow at least 50 % of the crown and 70 % of the height of the unsheared plants, suggesting they would be able tolerate shearing as a management tool with little to no loss of vigor...|$|R

40|$|Manual <b>pruning</b> with {{pneumatic}} <b>shears</b> is {{a current}} practice used by pear ‘Rocha’ farmers in Portugal. However, is labour-intensive and therefore expensive. Work started in 2008 {{to study a}} mechanised alternative based on a discs-saw pruning machine mounted on a front loader of an agricultural tractor. The following three treatments were compared: T 1 - manual pruning performed annually using pneumatic shears. T 2 - mechanical pruning, performed annually, topping the canopy parallel to the ground; in 2008 and 2010 topping was followed by mechanical hedging of {{both sides of the}} canopy; in 2011 mechanical topping was complemented with manual pruning. T 3 - mechanical pruning, performed annually, topping the canopy parallel to the ground followed by a manual pruning complement; in 2008, prior to the manual complement, trees were hedged {{on both sides of the}} canopy. A randomised complete block design was used, with three replications, leading to 9 plots with three lines of 10 trees per plot. In each plot only the central line was used in the evaluation. Trials were performed in a 20 years old commercial orchard, planted in an array of 4 mx 2 m with trees trained as central leader system. The following data was collected: tree height and canopy width, before and after pruning interventions; weight of biomass removed; Fruit yield and working rates. Results show that yield in treatment 2 was always lower than in treatment 1; yield in treatment 3, except once, was always lower than in treatment 1. Mechanical pruning leads to a more uniform orchard when compared to manual pruning. Although not beneficial in terms of yield, the use of the tractor mounted cutting bar prior to manual pruning interventions result in a reduction of time required by this expensive operation. However, further field work at a real scale is needed to validate the economic value of the strategy of performing mechanical pruning, based on a discs-saw pruning machine, followed by a manual complement...|$|R
40|$|Over {{an eight-year}} period, {{harvesting}} methods based on simple mechanical aids (blade and shear) were evaluated against hand harvesting on mature morphologically contrasting tea clones in Southern Tanzania. The effects of shear step height (5 - 32 mm) and the harvest interval (1. 8 - 4. 2 phyllochrons) were also examined. Except {{in the year}} following pruning, large annual yields (5. 7 - 7. 9 t dry tea ha[minus sign] 1) were obtained by hand harvesting at intervals of two phyllochrons. For clones K 35 (large shoots) and T 207 (small shoots), the mean harvested shoot weights were equivalent to three unfurled leaves and a terminal bud. The proportions of broken shoots (40 - 48 %) and coarse material (4 - 6 %) were both relatively high. Using a blade resulted in similar yields to hand harvesting from K 35 but larger yields from T 207 (+ 13 %). The yield increase from clone T 207 {{was associated with the}} harvest of more shoots and heavier shoots, smaller increases in canopy height, and a higher proportion (7 - 9 %) of coarse material compared to hand harvesting. On bushes, which had been harvested by hand for two years following <b>pruning,</b> using flat <b>shears</b> (no step) supported on the tea canopy resulted, over a three year period, in yields 8 - 14 % less than those obtained by hand harvesting and, for clone K 35, a reduction in the leaf area index to below 5. The development of a larger leaf area index is made possible by adding a step to the shear. However, since annual yields were reduced by 40 - 50 kg ha[minus sign] 1 per mm increase in step height, the step should be the minimum necessary to maintain long-term bush productivity. As mean shoot weights following shear harvesting were about 13 % below those obtained by hand harvesting, there is scope, when using shears, to extend the harvest interval from 2 to 2. 5 phyllochrons...|$|R
