Liepert said that the plan, $10 million {{more expensive than the}} one he had announced in December, would see 60% of seniors pay less than they did under the status quo. The same month, Stelmach's government's budget revealed changes to which medical services it would cover: those de-listed included chiropractic services, at an annual savings of $53 million, and sex change operations, at an annual savings of $700,000. While the Canada Health Act requires the federal government to financially penalize provinces that do not support all [...] "medically necessary" [...] procedures, Liepert maintained that the de-listed services were not [...] "medically necessary" [...] {{from the perspective of the}} Act, and said that he anticipated no trouble from the federal government.|$|E

State Controller John Chiang said the raised rate was illegal. Wantanabe said the average for the county is 1.16%.

Under California's state tax code, the nearly $3 million overpaid by Bell homeowners, should be redirected to local schools, however, on September 1, 2010, lawmakers approved AB 900 by Assemblyman Kevin De Leon (D- Los Angeles), which returns $2.9 million in property tax refunds directly to the overcharged city residents. On September 13, 2010 Lieutenant Governor Abel Maldonado, approved the bill. Because the Montebello Unified School District's boundaries include a small area of Bell, it was to receive a portion of the $2.9 million property tax refund slated to be returned to Bell under A.B. 900, which was signed into law by Lt.
