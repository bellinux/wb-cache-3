40|$|AbstractThis paper {{investigates the}} {{economic}} feasibility of Power-to-Gas (P 2 G) systems and gas storage options for both H 2 and renewable methane. The study {{is based on}} a model-based analysis using the net present value (NPV) method, as well as Monte Carlo simulation for taking fuel and electricity price risks into account. We study three investment cases: a Base Case where the gas is directly sold, a Variant A where temporal arbitrage opportunities between the electricity and gas market are exploited, and a Variant B where the balancing markets (secondary reserve market for electricity, external balancing market for natural gas) are addressed. Centralized and decentralized storage facilities are compared with each other and the optimal type and size determined. In a detailed sensitivity analysis and cost analysis we identify the key factors which could potentially improve the economic viability of the concepts assessed. We find that P 2 G for bridging the balancing markets for power and gas cannot be operated profitably. For both temporal arbitrage and balancing energy, <b>pipe</b> <b>storage</b> is preferred. Relatively high feed-in tariffs (100 € MW- 1 for H 2, 130 € MW- 1 for methane) are required to render <b>pipe</b> <b>storage</b> for P 2 G economically viable...|$|E

40|$|For {{nearly three}} decades two {{technology}} processes have been available for production of PEX piping by moisture induced silane crosslinking (PEX-b). The first technology, the Sioplas ™ process, was invented and patented by Dow Corning. This process requires extruding pipe from a reactive compound composed of silane groups which have been grafted onto polyethylene (PE) polymer chains {{by the addition of}} organic peroxide in an off-line compounding process. The second technology, the Monosil ™ process, was developed by Maillefer as a one-step-process where all of the components of PE base resin, additives, peroxide and silane are grafted in a specialized compounding extruder which also extrudes the pipe in-line. This paper describes a new innovative technology process that offers the PEX pipe industry a third choice in materials for producing PEX-b piping. The Vinyl Silane Copolymer or Visico ™ process, invented and patented by Borealis AS, copolymerizes the silane directly into the PE polymer chain during the polymerization process. This ensures an excellent homogeneous distribution of the reactive silane sites and avoids the heavy use of organic peroxides needed by the other PEX-b technologies to graft the silane component. The resulting product offers greater process stability and higher purity for superior taste & odor performance in PEX piping. All of these technologies require post treating the pipe with steam or hot water to induce the crosslinking reaction and produce PEX-b pipe although the new Borealis Ambicat ™ catalyst system for MDPE PEX-b radiant heating pipe enables crosslinking to take place during <b>pipe</b> <b>storage</b> at ambient temperatures by absorbing moisture from the surrounding air in the warehouse or yard...|$|E
40|$|Problems {{related to}} the impact of storm waters in the final outlet for urban sewer pipes have been studied thanks to the {{analysis}} conducted in an experimental sample basin drained by a combined sewer network, located in the city of Rome (S = 2015 ha); the chosen basin is the Cesarina - San Basilio catchment, situated in an area east of the centre of Rome, {{on the right side of}} the river Aniene. The aim of these measurements is the qualitative and quantitative characterisation of load waves occurring in the main sewer pipe during a storm event, as well as the analysis of erosion and transport of deposited solid material and the location of sewer trunks with high probability of temporary solid deposits between two consecutive storm waves. The complexity of solid transport phenomena implied the need for simplified analysis schemes and simulative models appropriately calibrated with experimental data, suitable for a technical solution of such problems. In particular, the validity of experimental records allows the calibration of a hydrodynamic model whose implementation facilitates the extension of data from a sewer trunk of the network to another. In the hydraulic model, a flow simulation engine has been used to solve the complete De Saint Venant equation under the hypothesis of mono-dimensional flow, and to represent full-section flow, <b>pipe</b> <b>storage</b> capacity, gushing-back phenomena, inlet and outlet energy losses and flow inversion.

40|$|Hydrological {{processes}} are complex to compute in hilly areas {{when compared to}} plain areas. The governing processes behind runoff generation on hillslopes are subsurface storm flow, saturation excess flow, overland flow, return flow and <b>pipe</b> <b>storage.</b> The simulations of the above processes in the soil matrix require detailed hillslope hydrological modelling. In the present study, a hillslope experimental plot {{has been designed to}} study the runoff generation processes on the plot scale. The setup is designed keeping in view the natural hillslope conditions prevailing in the Northwestern Himalayas, India where high intensity rainfall events occur frequently. A rainfall simulator was installed over the experimental hillslope plot to generate rainfall with an intensity of 100 mm/h, which represents the dominating rainfall intensity range in the region. Soil moisture sensors were also installed at variable depths from 100 to 1000 mm at different locations of the plot to observe the soil moisture regime. From the experimental observations it was found that once the soil is saturated, it remains at field capacity for the next 24 – 36 h. Such antecedent moisture conditions are most favorable for the generation of rapid stormflow from hillslopes. A dye infiltration test was performed on the undisturbed soil column to observe the macropore fraction variability over the vegetated hillslopes. The estimated macropore fractions are used as essential input for the hillslope hydrological model. The main objective {{of the present study was}} to develop and test a method for estimating runoff responses from natural rainfall over hillslopes of the Northwestern Himalayas using a portable rainfall simulator. Using the experimental data and the developed conceptual model, the overland flow and the subsurface flow through a macropore-dominated area have been estimated/analyzed. The surface and subsurface runoff estimated using the developed hillslope hydrological model compared well with the observed surface runoff for a rainfall intensity of 100 mm/h. The surface runoff hydrograph was very well predicted by the model, with correlation coefficient (R 2) and Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (E) as 0. 95 and 0. 91, respectively. The observed soil/macropore storage component was estimated with the help of water balance equation and compared with the model predicted macropore storage.

Each company employee must be committed to the use of effective methods to achieve optimum efficiency, productivity, and quality to produce competitive goods. Statistical Process Control (SPC), in its broad sense, is a collection of production methods and management concepts and practices that can be used throughout the company. SPC involves the use of statistical signals to identify sources of variation, to improve performance, and to maintain control production at higher quality levels. This work investigates the implementation phase of SPC in a company, which produce rigid unplasticized poly vinyl chloride (uPVC) pipes for cold water supplies. SPC techniques were used to identify the variations of finished pipes quality parameters and quantify these variations. Stepwise approach was initiated to control the processes and uplift the quality of the finished pipes. Selected -processes were monitored, analyzed and improved through multi-disciplinary process actions teams. By using awareness and pilot project phases SPC was successfully implemented in a pipe extrusion line. Process flow chart was used to define variable and attribute data of pipe extrusion line. Flow chart was helped to control and minimize external causes to a great extent. Intemal and external customer satisfaction was achieved due to through monitoring of variable and 'attribute data from the incoming raw materials to finished <b>pipe</b> <b>storage.</b> Root causes for variations in the extrusion line were studied through detailed cause and effect relations.

The exposure assessment of FCM components includes consequently a number of uncertainties. Data are often scarce or missing (e. g. market data on the type of packaging of food consumed) and/or are based on an extrapolation of data available for comparable FCM components with a similar functionality.

A nominally similar material of commercial manufacture was also tested for comparison and cast polyester resin specimens were tested to determine the contribution of the matrix material. Fracture testing was carried out in four point bending using single edge cracked specimens. A number of techniques for specimen preparation and fracture testing were developed, including acoustic emission monitoring to detect and characterise crack growth in composites, and the use of photoelastic observations to give a qualitative indication of stress distributions during testing. Existing expressions for fracture toughness (developed using isotropic materials) were shown to be inappropriate for use with most composite materials and an expression suitable for the 0 ° uniaxial material used here was developed experimentally by compliance testing. A study was made of the use of instrumented impact testing for the measurement of fracture toughness of cast polyester resin. Comparison was made with the results of slow three point bend fracture tests of similar specimens. A number of features of the impact fracture of this material were revealed which gave valuable insights into the applicability of the method with this and similar materials. It has been shown that fracture toughness determination can be usefully applied to glass-fibre reinforced polyester composites, provided that the nature of fracture in the material is appreciated so that suitable test procedures are used...|$|R
