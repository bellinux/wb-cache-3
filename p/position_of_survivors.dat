40|$|Several {{categories}} of medical expenditures {{are not covered}} by Medicare, including prescription drugs, most nursing home stays, and extended hospital visits. Out-of-pocket costs for these items can be substantial, and what’s more, {{they are likely to be}} concentrated at the end of life. At the same time, it is well documented that poverty is 3 - 4 times more common among widows than among similarly aged married women. This study examines the potential link between these two phenomena, asking the question: to what extent do out-of-pocket health care costs of a dying spouse affect the financial <b>position</b> <b>of</b> the <b>survivor?</b> We find that out-of-pocket medical spending increases substantially just prior to death, and that these expenditures are large relative to income for a large share of elderly couples. Simulations investigate the extent to which expansions in insurance coverage to include nursing home care or prescription drug coverage could improve the financial well-being of the surviving spouse. ...|$|R
40|$|Background: There {{is limited}} {{information}} on health-related {{quality of life}} (HRQOL) <b>of</b> injured accident <b>survivors.</b> The aim <b>of</b> {{the present study was}} to assess acute stress, post traumatic stress disorder and health-related quality of life in injured accident survivors. Materials and Methods: Eighty-eight patients admitted to the orthopaedics and trauma surgery department of Rasht Porsina Hospital were enrolled to this descriptive study. SRS- PTSD (post-traumatic stress) and SF- 36 (short-form of health-related quality of life) questionnaires were completed and assessed one week and two months after the accident. Results: Acute stress of the first week of the accident was found to be an independent predictor of post-traumatic stress of two months later. Regression analysis showed a statistically significant relationship between <b>position</b> <b>of</b> the <b>survivor</b> as a driver and score of post-traumatic stress disorder two months post-accident (P= 0. 024). The results also showed a statistically significant improvement in physical function (P= 0. 005), lack of improvement in role limitations due to physical injury (P= 0. 02), no improvement in mental function including mental health (P= 0. 001), role limitations due to emotional problems (P= 0. 01) and vitality (P= 0. 001). Conclusion: There is a significant relationship between PTSD and quality of life <b>of</b> the injured <b>survivors.</b> The return <b>of</b> injured accident <b>survivors</b> to pre-injury HRQOL may depend not only on optimal medical care but also on awareness and timely interventions regarding PTSS...|$|R

40|$|Psychiatric {{diagnosis}} {{is used to}} categorise and treat mental health problems in the UK yet is widely criticised for struggling to convincingly categorise the experience of distress {{and that it is}} socially constructed from the culmination of historical and cultural interactions. Service-user accounts are varied and there is a paucity of qualitative research that considers the positive and negative effects of labelling. To understand identity construction {{in the context of a}} psychiatric diagnosis, the present study recruited 16 participants from a service-user research group and five focus groups were conducted. Transcripts were studied using Foucauldian Discourse Analysis. Two major identities were detected ‘illness identity’ and ‘recovery identity’. Participants drew on multiple and competing discourses and which placed them in the <b>position</b> <b>of</b> patient and/or <b>survivor.</b> Medical discourses were dominant throughout the focus groups and were used in a way to convey the fluidity of the identity and how they related to their diagnosis.

40|$|The papers by Plumb, Beresford and colleagues, Thomas, and Spandler and Calton {{which were}} {{a point of}} {{departure}} for the symposium are replete with both the complexity of competing ideas for framing the theory and politics <b>of</b> mental health <b>survivor</b> identity in a context of wider ‘disability’ struggles and the sense that activism for change is paramount. Different theories or means of making sense <b>of</b> the social <b>position</b> <b>of</b> mental health <b>survivors</b> have the potential to underpin movement activism. Questions arise over the extent to which different understandings, and the means by which they are arrived at, might foster solidarity or division with potential allies. This paper will not directly seek to develop critique of the merits or otherwise of social models of disability for the mental health context. Rather, it will explore understandings of ways by which individuals and groups might take part in discussion and debate to arrive at more agreeable theories or politics of mental health. A critical look at Habermas’s (1986, 1987) theory of communicative action will be developed and its relevance for this context discussed. The idea of the university as an interesting social space for deliberations on movement politics and theory will be highlighted, bringing together movement activists and critically engaged academics...|$|R

40|$|The Statute of the {{permanent}} International Criminal Court (the 2 ̆ 2 ICC 2 ̆ 2) agreed to in Rome in 1998 contains many provisions that deal with the specific concerns and rights <b>of</b> victims and <b>survivors</b> <b>of</b> the international crimes that the ICC will have jurisdiction over. It consolidates {{the work of the}} two ad hoc international criminal Tribunals (the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda) in this area, but also further enhances the role and rights of victims in a number of innovative ways. These three international criminal Tribunals thus collectively represent an important step forward in the recognition of the suffering and the <b>position</b> <b>of</b> victims and <b>survivors</b> <b>of</b> international crimes. This article will examine three main issues in relation to victims and the ICC. First, after identifying the protective measures for victims allowed at the discretion of the international criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, it will focus on the most controversial measure (which the ICC can also order) - the non-disclosure to the defence of the identity of witnesses. Does this protective measure violate a defendant 2 ̆ 7 s right to a fair trial? The Statute of the ICC also allows, {{for the first time in}} international criminal justice, for the right of victims to obtain their own legal representation, subject to the discretion of the ICC. The second issue is how is this going to work in practice in light of the fact that international crimes normally involve hundreds, if not thousands or even tens of thousands, of victims? And finally, while the ICC Statute provides for the possibility of reparations to victims, where will the money come from, and thus what are the chances of victims actually being able to receive compensation...|$|R

40|$|This {{study was}} {{an inquiry into}} whether the {{character}} traits and symptoms <b>of</b> Holocaust <b>survivors</b> {{had an effect on}} their children. Further, it was an attempt to distinguish between two groups <b>of</b> <b>survivors</b> 2 ̆ 7 children: children <b>of</b> <b>survivors</b> who were adolescents in the Concentration Camps and children <b>of</b> <b>survivors</b> who were adults in the Camps. ^ The subjects in this study comprised a total sample of 64 Jewish individuals. The sample was apportioned into four groups of subjects: two experimental and two control groups. There were 16 individuals in each group, an equal number of males and females. ^ The sources of data were: the Life History Questionnaire, the Personal Attributes Inventory [...] a composite of scales and subscales and the Structured Interview. ^ Each of the dependent variables was analyzed using a 2 x 2 x 2 analysis of variance. The three-way ANOVA assessed the effects of Camp Experience (children <b>of</b> <b>survivors</b> and controls), Sex (male and female), and Developmental Level (children of parents who were adolescents during WWII and children of parents who were adults during WWII). ^ The ANOVA yielded a main effect for Camp Experience on eleven of the twenty personality attributes assessed. Despite measurable differences between children <b>of</b> <b>survivors</b> and controls, the mean scores obtained by both groups on all dependent variables were within the normal range. That children <b>of</b> <b>survivors</b> obtained normal mean scores is strong evidence for their normality. The findings encourage the concept of a 2 ̆ 2 survivor child 2 ̆ 7 s complex, 2 ̆ 2 which acknowledges the impact <b>of</b> <b>survivor</b> parents on their children, but visualizes this impact as producing a constellation of outstanding personality attributes, within the normal range that is unique to children <b>of</b> <b>survivors.</b> ^ The analysis of variance also revealed that children <b>of</b> <b>survivors</b> whose parents were adolescents in the Concentration Camps were no different from children <b>of</b> <b>survivors</b> whose parents were adults in the Camps on the majority of dependent variables assessed.
