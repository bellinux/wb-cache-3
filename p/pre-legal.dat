40|$|This article {{examines}} {{the nature of the}} concept of criminal intent. The analysis of this concept is grounded on the recognition that the concept constitutes a juridical particularization of the very basic, <b>pre-legal</b> notion of intentionality. On the basis of a number of phenomenological and hermeneutical insights, it is concluded that intent is essentially a bivalent concept: it is characterized by both subject-intrinsic and subject-extrinsic properties. In this context, the intersubjective, interpretative accessibility of subjective intentional utterances is discussed ('normativisation'). Moreover, it is argued that the nature of criminal intent is characterized by a second bivalent feature: intent both parallels and deviates from its <b>pre-legal</b> counterpart. The distance between both concepts is explained in terms of a teleological account of the function of the criminal law system in society. In order to realize the different purposes that the criminal law system is taken to serve, it needs concepts whose semantic scope is outlined to a sufficient degree of precision. It is argued that the criminal law cannot afford for its concept of intent to become too alienated from the <b>pre-legal</b> concept of intention of which it forms a particularization. Criminal intent is to be regarded as a pivoting point between the doctrinal world of the criminal law and the intersubjective life-world. The principle of legality provides the key to answering the question of how the criminal law - if it is {{to live up to its}} claim to legitimate authority - should safeguard a sufficiently firm connection between its concept of intent and the everyday concept of intention...|$|E
40|$|This study {{deals with}} {{the way in which}} the {{criminal}} system, in conformity with its function, lends its own criminal contours to the <b>pre-legal</b> concepts of intentionality and intention. The research question is formulated as follows: in what way does intentional conduct acquire criminal relevance, in such a manner that the said conduct may be characterised as criminally intentional or possibly negligent conduct? The study focuses on the semantic issue of the contents and on the methodological issue of the furnishing of proof of what may be termed the cardinal criminal particularisation of the <b>pre-legal</b> and everyday concept of intention: the mental element of intent. In a derivative sense some considerations are also devoted to what may be termed the ‘privative’ specification thereof: the criminal notion of negligence. In recent literature on the subject, the question is often raised, whether intent and negligence are primarily mental or primarily normative concepts. In this study, it is argued that they are mental and therefore normative concepts. They consist of particularisations of certain types of the <b>pre-legal</b> concept of intentionality. This implies that these criminal particularisations show bivalent characteristics in two directions. From a horizontal perspective, they are characterised by both a subject-intrinsic and a subject-extrinsic moment. They therefore do not possess an ‘object-like’ character; they are not states of affairs that may or may not be observable and that could be localised ‘somewhere’, like in the psyche of a subject or in the actions of a subject. From a vertical point of view, the concepts of intent and negligence in criminal law show both differences from and parallels to their <b>pre-legal</b> equivalents. The term ‘normativisation’ relates to an interpretative strategy, which by means of external indications makes statements on internal states of affairs. Hermeneutics provides the background, against which a description is presented of this interpretative method according to which the legal meanings ‘intentional’ or ‘negligent’ can be attributed to a certain act. The normativising method is described by means of a theory that may be indicated as the ‘text model’. According to this model, human actions share some essential qualities with texts, on the basis of which both actions and texts are ‘readable’. In the application of the normativising method, the underlying intention is conceptually narrowed down to that aspect of intentionality, that materialised in the action under consideration. In other words: the focus is on the ‘subject-extrinsic’ aspect of intentionality and the ‘subject-intrinsic’ aspect thereof is put in brackets. In this study, it is argued that the applicability of the normativising method within criminal law is restricted: a full eclipse of any reference to the acting subject is incompatible with the function of criminal law and the pertaining dialectic between the legality question and the legitimacy question. With reference to an old German doctrine, called Parallelwertung in der Laiensphäre, it is argued that the application of the normativising method is to be combined with an individualising interpretation movement that aims to connect to the ‘narrative identity’ of the accused...|$|E

First Amendment doctrine has been reluctant to take much notice of <b>pre-legal</b> institutional categories, such as “press,” “universities,” and “libraries,” but allowing the increased use of such institutional realities in the design of First Amendment doctrine may well produce a First Amendment doctrine with far fewer anomalies and much greater utility. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{relationship}} between speech and law is long-standing. As {{attacks on the}} trial bar 2 ̆ 7 s competence have grown, speech researchers have become more interested in that relationship and in the role they can play in helping attorneys and future attorneys develop communication skills. Based on legal and speech research on communication skills in legal practice, a survey of Kansas attorneys was conducted to answer five questions: (1) What communication skills are needed {{in the practice of}} law according to type and length of practice? (2) Does participation in trial work affect perceptions of the importance of communication skills? (3) Where and how do lawyers currently acquire communication skills? (4) What do lawyers perceive to be the best methods of teaching the communication skills needed in legal practice? and (5) Do lawyers with <b>pre-legal</b> or CLE (Continuing Legal Education) training in communication skills perceive themselves as more effective communicators than those without? Results of the survey indicated that all 23 communication skills addressed were considered as 2 ̆ 2 Somewhat Important 2 ̆ 2 or 2 ̆ 2 Important 2 ̆ 2 by all 368 respondents. The variable of length and type of practice affected ratings as did frequency of trial participation. Previous findings showing that skills are acquired primarily through personal experience were corroborated. Additionally, attorneys in this study believed that 22 of the 23 skills are better learned through sources other than those they had used. No statistical differences in self-evaluations were found for those with <b>pre-legal</b> or CLE training and those without. Because 181 respondents had practiced over 10 years, experience appeared to balance gains made through instruction. Based on results, speech communication departments should play {{a more active role in}} educating pre-law students. Legal communication sources should include a broader range of communication skills than traditional trial skills. Speech professionals should also become more actively involved in CLE instruction and should advise law school educators regarding appropriate teaching techniques in communication skills. ...|$|E
40|$|I had {{intended}} to explore the traditional philosophical problem of property, that is, to analyse and evaluate various justifications {{for the right to}} private property, which have ranged through the utilitarian, to do with efficient use of resources; the psychological, such as the supposed human need for unique external attachments; the religious, including Old Testament and other supposed scriptual mandates for private property; and the most famous of all, namely, that associated with Locke, which itself includes elements of utilitarian, religious, psychological and even, arguably, independent and additional moral desert justifications.

The theoretical part of the text is based on treatises of Czechoslovak dissidents who examined the phenomenon of citizenship, being themselves citizens of illiberal regime. The treatises originate mainly in the 1970 s and look at the citizen through the eyes of the dissent of "normalised" Czechoslovakia.

40|$|According to Hart’s {{concept of}} law {{one of the}} {{distinctive}} characteristics of a legal order {{is that it is}} sustainable on the basis of official acceptance alone. Can we go further and say that law is morally risky {{in the sense that it}} is endemically liable to become alienated from its subjects? On the basis of Hart’s weak formulation of acceptance there is nothing to suppose that acceptance and (an absence of) alienation are connected. However, on closer inspection, this weak formulation is defective, failing to account for the normative and collective aspect of the law qua social norm. Pursuing a stronger notion of acceptance as a critical reflective attitude does establish a link between acceptance and (an absence of) alienation, but it fails to establish that the legal regime is, by its nature, endemically alienating in a way that a <b>pre-legal</b> regime is not. It does, however, help to explain why any official-centred picture of the legal regime is problematic in terms of accounting for law’s normativity. Whether alienation materializes, it is concluded, depends on the social and political factors that condition our attitude towards the law rather than on the nature of law as such...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the concept of}} constituent power and constitutional form in Jürgen Habermas’ legal philosophy. It argues that a concept of constituent power needs to be embedded in a constitutional theory that can explain the difference between legitimate law and a mere wielding of power. Theories operating with assumptions of a <b>pre-legal</b> and unbound constituent power are either pre-modern or a-historical. While Habermas’ theory can convincingly spell out general terms for a legitimate constitutionalisation and legitimate law-making, however, {{it appears to be}} at the same time too thin and too thick with regard to two recent transformations of the democratic nation-state: Firstly, it cannot grasp the shift from enabling ‘freedom’ to upholding ‘security’ as the central description of the function of the nation-state. This shift has severe implications for the discourse on human rights and their a priori status as constraints on the popular sovereign: the security paradigm seems to trump the notion of inalienable individual rights and replace them with the rule that the end justifies the means. Secondly, the idea of a necessary internal link between public and private autonomy in Habermas’ system of rights appears to be unable to explain the emergence of supranational and transnational law outside of a national legal community. In a different reading, however, it can serve as a normative yardstick for existing regulatory structures, and as an orientation for the elaboration of new forms and institutions that may reduce the obvious democratic deficits of supranational and transnational regulation...|$|E
40|$|The global {{movement}} to provide domestic relationship status and benefits to same-sex couples {{has resulted in}} five different kinds of legal responses: (1) redefining marriage to include same-sex couples; (2) creation of marriage-equivalent civil union domestic relationships, with {{most or all of}} the legal incidents of marriage; (3) creation of a carefully customized domestic partner relationship providing access to some particular relational benefits; (4) allowing the private creation of legitimate same-sex relationships with private ordering of the relationships by the parties themselves (by contract, wills, etc.); and (5) total rejection of any legal recognition of same-sex relationships, usually by criminal prohibition. The polar extreme responses are inappropriate. This paper focuses on the flaws of legalizing same-sex marriage. Gender-integrating marriage is a very important <b>pre-legal</b> social institution, and positivist attempts to redefine marriage to include same-sex relations are conceptually flawed, like calling a tail a leg. Most nations today provide constitutional protection for marriage because it is widely considered to be a core, foundational social institution; and substantial protection of the dual-gender quality of marriage is manifest in many national constitutions. Efforts to “capture” the legal institution of marriage to promote the agenda of particular social movements have occurred before, but they have produced significant problems for marriage and for society. Legalization of same-sex marriage will transform the social understanding of what marriage is, what it means, and what is expected of married persons in ways that devalue and weaken the social institution of marriage...|$|E
40|$|Debates about legal ways of {{managing}} problem people and problem spaces sometimes {{end up in}} appellate courts. Existing critical analyses of such courts usually look only at {{the content of the}} decisions, content often said to be driven by racist, sexist, and/or classist interests. Content is also the focus of scholars of science and law, who document the ways in which technical and scientific expertise is either accepted or rejected by courts. But content analysis {{is not the only way}} to analyze knowledge processes. Here we present a methodologically novel study that stands back somewhat from the content of the various claims (about urban vices, in our case studies), focussing instead on the dynamics of knowledge B the ways in which knowledge claims circulate and get transformed as they proceed through various legal and <b>pre-legal</b> stages. Choosing to analyze the dynamics rather than the content of knowledge is inspired by Actor Network Theory, and Bruno Latour=s work in particular: but it is not a theoretical fad, since it very much reflects the workings of appellate courts. Judicial review tends to avoid making judgements about the content of the impugned law or ordinance, focussing more on the process, particularly on its formal character. This is familiar to anyone practicing administrative law, but no socio-legal scholars have theorized it. Here, an analysis of some appellate courts=reviews of projects to maintain moral order in the city shows that a dynamic analysis of knowledge production can tell us much about the knowledge games involved in such familiar but seldom theorized legal manouvres as judicial review and constitutional challenges...|$|E
40|$|Last Term, the Supreme Court {{relied on}} Gomillion [v. Lightfoot] {{to hold that}} Hawaii, like Alabama before it, had {{segregated}} voters by race {{in violation of the}} Fifteenth Amendment. The state law at issue in Rice v. Cayetano provided that only 2 ̆ 2 Hawaiians 2 ̆ 2 could vote for the trustees of the state 2 ̆ 7 s Office of Hawaiian Affairs (2 ̆ 2 OHA 2 ̆ 2), a public agency that oversees programs designed to benefit the State 2 ̆ 7 s native people. Rice holds that restricting the OHA electorate to descendants of the 1778 inhabitants of the Hawaiian Islands embodied a racial classification that effectively 2 ̆ 2 fenc[ed] out whole classes of [...] . ci tizens from decisionmaking in critical state affairs. [ [...] . ] Quite startling and worthy of attention, however, is the path the Court took in reaching its holding. [ [...] . ] This Article traces the Court 2 ̆ 7 s reasoning, which appears puzzling on its face, to a deeper understanding of racial classifications, participation in the electoral process, and the relationship between the two. Rice suggests that the primary value of political participation through voting lies not in the policies implemented by those elected, but in two distinct and related intrinsic benefits the vote produces: namely, the constitutive benefit an individual derives from political engagement with others and the expressive benefit derived from full membership in the political community. Rice posits, on the one hand, that a jurisdiction 2 ̆ 7 s use of race to define an electorate distorts these beneficial effects by imposing on voters a state-approved identity instead of leaving voters free to develop an identity on their own and by disseminating the message that racial identity represents a relevant criterion for entry into the political community. Rice presumes, on the other hand, that the constitutive and expressive aspects of voting provide a crucial element to a group identity that would otherwise not be viewed as 2 ̆ 2 racial. 2 ̆ 2 This view of race confirms the idea that, at least within our constitutional practice, the concept of racial identity is a complex legal conclusion, not a <b>pre-legal</b> fact. [ [...] . ] Read more broadly, Rice implies that many applications of section 2 of the Voting Rights Act are unconstitutional. Under this reading, Rice works a dramatic change in voting rights jurisprudence by indicating that electoral rules that even partially rely on race undermine the intrinsic values of voting and thereby violate the Fifteenth Amendment. In other words, districting plans not even subject to strict scrutiny under Shaw might be struck down under Rice. We can squarely confront these potentially far-reaching consequences of Rice, this Article suggests, only by recognizing the deeper conceptions of race and voting that underlie the case. [ [...] . ] This Article begins in Part I by discussing the factual background that gave rise to the conflict in Rice v. Cayetano. Part II then addresses the Court 2 ̆ 7 s decision in Rice, emphasizing the puzzling doctrinal route the majority took to reach its conclusion that the OHA 2 ̆ 7 s voting system violates the Fifteenth Amendment. Part III explores why the Court might have chosen this path and suggests that the decision reflects the views that (1) the Constitution protects the vote primarily because of its intrinsic value to the individual and (2) the concept of race is a complex legal conclusion, not a <b>pre-legal</b> fact. It also explores the implications this conception may have in future cases brought under both section 2 of the Voting Rights Act and Shaw v. Reno. This Article concludes by discussing Rice 2 ̆ 7 s distinct understanding of voting 2 ̆ 7 s constitutive benefit and by assessing Rice 2 ̆ 7 s reliance on Gomillion in light of the decision 2 ̆ 7 s conception of voting 2 ̆ 7 s intrinsic values...|$|E

40|$|In {{an earlier}} article I {{demonstrated}} that American courts are not constitutionally precluded from enforcing foreign judgments based on foreign laws that the Constitution prevents American governments from enacting. (Exporting the Constitution, 53 Emory L. J. 171 (2004)). Consider, for instance, an English defamation judgment based on English law, {{which is more}} pro-plaintiff than the First Amendment permits American law to be. I showed that although the English judgment may well be un-American insofar as it come from a non-American polity and reflects political values that are at variance with American constitutional law, neither the judgment itself nor its enforcement by an American court is unconstitutional. This Article addresses {{the question of whether}} such un-American foreign judgments should be enforced as a matter of policy. By comparing the different analyses that result from game theoretic and Rawlsian approaches to foreign relations, the Article shows that determining whether un-American judgments should be enforced invariably requires a tradeoff among competing interests that is an inherently subjective process informed by the decisionmaker 2 ̆ 7 s <b>pre-legal</b> commitments. Notwithstanding the fundamental differences between game theoretic and Rawlsian approaches, both agree that un-American foreign judgments should be enforced under certain conditions. This common conclusion highlights the practical costs of American courts 2 ̆ 7 mistaken conclusion that un-American judgments categorically cannot be enforced as a matter of constitutional law. The game theoretic and Rawlsian analyses also have important institutional implications. Both suggest that the political branches of government are better suited than courts to formulate a policy regarding the enforcement of un-American judgments. Game theory and Rawlsian analysis also support the conclusion that international treaties and executive agreements are particularly promising vehicles for generating rules of enforcement. Although the Article does not champion any one of the competing plausible normative approaches that could be taken to foreign relations, the Article 2 ̆ 7 s identification of all the interests that are implicated by the enforcement of un-American judgments enables informed tradeoffs. In the process, the Article shows that many of the standard policy objections to enforcing un-American foreign judgments fall away upon careful analysis...|$|E
40|$|In {{the wake}} of the recent {{financial}} crisis of 2008, and in the run-up to what some are calling a perfect fiscal storm, {{there is no shortage of}} commentary on the need for fundamental market reform. Though there are certainly disagreements about where the real problems are and what to do, almost all the commentary remains wedded to an old and entirely false image of “free competition. ” Of course, there is hardly consensus about whether markets require the heavy hand of regulative control, or are better left to regulate themselves, but a belief in the distinction between these two images — competition and control — is common ground. Unfortunately for all of us, this ground is a mirage. The idea of a <b>pre-legal,</b> “self-regulating” market has always been, and still is, a deep and abiding fiction. This Article argues that our continued commitments to the legal distinctions between competitive and controlled markets are far more dangerous than they are pedantic. If there is serious interest in avoiding the circular pitfalls of market society, which no doubt there is, attention must be paid to the manner in which the market is legally constructed from the bottom up, and the fact that there is nothing natural or necessary about that construction. In order to understand the dominant characterization of market society, we must map the basic legal postures that populate our conversations about free markets and the interventionist state — postures that have been built in the fields of classic and modern liberalism. This Article endeavors to stylize these liberalisms through an analysis of representative texts from John Locke, Henry Carter Adams, and Frank Knight. Though important, the awareness provided by this intellectual history of liberal legalism is insufficient for serious thinking about market reform — what is also needed is a critique of that history, a critique that reminds us that while liberalism provides legal rules for the creation and maintenance of the market, these rules are never neutral with respect to the distribution of wealth and resources among market players. In service of that recollection, the Article surveys three moments in a critical history of economic liberalism through a sample of texts from Karl Marx, Robert Hale, Morris Cohen, and Duncan Kennedy. To be sure, a successful strategy of market reform requires a great deal more than a familiarity with the legal styles of classic and modern liberalism, and leftist critiques of the liberal market’s legal structure. But that’s hardly the point. The point is that a successful strategy of market reform can’t do without them...|$|E
