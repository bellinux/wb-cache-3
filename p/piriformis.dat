5|$|The pudendal nerve passes {{between the}} <b>piriformis</b> muscle and coccygeus (ischiococcygeus) muscles {{and leaves the}} pelvis through {{the lower part of}} the greater sciatic foramen. It crosses over the lateral part of the sacrospinous {{ligament}} and reenters the pelvis through the lesser sciatic foramen. After reentering the pelvis, it accompanies the internal pudendal artery and internal pudendal vein upwards and forwards along the lateral wall of the ischiorectal fossa, being contained in a sheath of the obturator fascia termed the pudendal canal, along with the internal pudendal blood vessels.|$|E
25|$|<b>Piriformis</b> {{syndrome}} {{may also}} be associated with direct trauma to the <b>piriformis</b> muscle, such as in a fall or from a knife wound.|$|E
25|$|<b>Piriformis</b> {{syndrome}} {{does not}} occur in children, and is mostly seen in women of age between thirty and forty. This is due to hormone changes throughout their life, especially during pregnancy, where muscles around the pelvis, including <b>piriformis</b> muscles, tense up to stabilize the area for birth.|$|E
25|$|Failure of <b>piriformis</b> {{syndrome}} {{treatment may}} be secondary to an underlying obturator internus muscle injury.|$|E
25|$|A precise {{test for}} <b>piriformis</b> {{syndrome}} {{has not yet}} been developed and thus hard to diagnose this pain.|$|E
25|$|The {{result of}} the <b>piriformis</b> muscle spasm can be {{impingement}} of not only the sciatic nerve but also the pudendal nerve.|$|E
25|$|The {{posterior}} (Moore or Southern) approach accesses {{the joint}} and capsule through the back, taking <b>piriformis</b> muscle {{and the short}} external rotators of the femur. This approach gives excellent access to the acetabulum and femur and preserves the hip abductors and thus minimizes the risk of abductor dysfunction post operatively. It {{has the advantage of}} becoming a more extensile approach if needed. Critics cite a higher dislocation rate, although repair of the capsule, <b>piriformis</b> and the short external rotators along with use of modern large diameter head balls reduces this risk.|$|E
25|$|Imaging tests such as {{computerised}} tomography or {{magnetic resonance}} imaging can help with the diagnosis of lumbar disc herniation. The utility of MR neurography in the diagnoses of <b>piriformis</b> syndrome is controversial.|$|E
25|$|Parts of {{the body}} which play an {{important}} role in performing this asana are: both the intrinsic and extrinsic muscles of the feet, the quadriceps, the iliopsoas muscles, the <b>piriformis,</b> abdominal wall, and the diaphragm.|$|E
25|$|<b>Piriformis</b> {{syndrome}} is often left undiagnosed and mistaken with other pains due to similar symptoms with back pain, quadriceps pain, lower leg pain, and buttock pain. These symptoms include tenderness, tingling and numbness initiating in lower back and buttock area and then radiating {{down to the}} thigh and to the leg.|$|E
25|$|Medicines are {{commonly}} prescribed {{for the treatment}} of sciatica, but evidence for pain medication is poor. Specifically, low-quality evidence indicates that NSAIDs do not appear to improve immediate pain and all NSAIDs appear about equivalent. Evidence is also lacking in use of opioids and muscle relaxants by usual means. In those with sciatica due to <b>piriformis</b> syndrome, botulinum toxin injections may improve pain and or function. There is little evidence for steroids, either epidural or by pill. Low-quality evidence supports the use of gabapentin for acute pain relief in those with chronic sciatica.|$|E
25|$|Hip {{arthroscopy}} {{was initially}} {{used for the}} diagnosis of unexplained hip pain, but is now widely used {{in the treatment of}} conditions both in and outside the hip joint. The most common indication currently is for the treatment of femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) and its associated pathologies. Hip conditions that may be treated arthroscopically also includes labral tears, loose / foreign body removal, hip washout (for infection) or biopsy, chondral (cartilage) lesions, osteochondritis dissecans, ligamentum teres injuries (and reconstruction), Iliopsoas tendinopathy (or ‘snapping psoas’), trochanteric pain syndrome, snapping iliotibial band, osteoarthritis (controversial), sciatic nerve compression (<b>piriformis</b> syndrome), ischiofemoral impingement and direct assessment of hip replacement.|$|E
25|$|About 90% of {{the time}} sciatica {{is due to a}} spinal disc {{herniation}} pressing on one of the lumbar or sacral nerve roots. Other problems that may result in sciatica include spondylolisthesis, spinal stenosis, <b>piriformis</b> syndrome, pelvic tumors, and compression by a baby's head during pregnancy. The straight-leg-raising test is often helpful in diagnosis. The test is positive if, when the leg is raised while a person is lying on their back, pain shoots below the knee. In most cases medical imaging is not needed. Exceptions to this are when bowel or bladder function is affected, there is significant loss of feeling or weakness, symptoms are long standing, or there is a concern of a tumor or infection. Conditions that may present similarly are diseases of the hip and early herpes zoster before the rash appears.|$|E
25|$|Sciatica is {{generally}} {{caused by the}} compression of lumbar nerves L4, or L5 or sacral nerves S1, S2, or S3, or by compression of the sciatic nerve itself. When sciatica is caused by compression of a dorsal nerve root (radix), it is considered a lumbar radiculopathy (or radiculitis when accompanied with an inflammatory response). This can occur {{as a result of}} a spinal disk bulge or spinal disc herniation (a herniated intervertebral disc), or from roughening, enlarging, or misalignment (spondylolisthesis) of the vertebrae, or as a result of degenerated discs that can reduce the diameter of the lateral foramen (natural hole) through which nerve roots exit the spine. The intervertebral discs consist of an annulus fibrosus, which forms a ring surrounding the inner nucleus pulposus. When there is a tear in the anulus fibrosus, the nucleus pulposus (pulp) may extrude through the tear and press against spinal nerves within the spinal cord, cauda equina, or exiting nerve roots, causing inflammation, numbness, or excruciating pain. Inflammation of the spinal canal can also spread to adjacent facet joints and cause lower back pain and/or referred pain in the posterior thigh(s). Pseudosciatic pain can also be caused by compression of peripheral sections of the nerve, usually from soft tissue tension in the <b>piriformis</b> or related muscles.|$|E
25|$|<b>Piriformis</b> {{syndrome}} (PS) data {{is often}} confused with other conditions due {{to differences in}} definitions, survey methods and whether or not occupational groups or general population are surveyed. This causes a lack of group harmony about the diagnosis and treatment of PS, affecting its epidemiology. In a study, 0.33% of 1293 patients with lower back pain cited an incident for PS. A separate study showed 6% of 750 patients with the same incidence. About 6% - 8% of lower back pain occurrences were attributed to PS, though other reports concluded about 5% - 36%. In a survey conducted on the general population, 12.2% - 27% included a lifetime occurrence of PS, while 2.2% - 19.5% showed an annual occurrence. However further studies show that the proportion of the sciatica, in terms of PS, is about 0.1% in orthopaedic practice. This is more common in women with a ratio of 3 to 1 and most likely due to the wider quadriceps femoris muscle angle in the os coxae. Between the years of 1991- 1994, PS was found to be 75% prevalent in New York, Connecticut, New Jersey, Pennsylvania; 20% in other American urban centers; and 5% in North and South America, Europe, Asia, Africa and Australia. The common ages of occurrence happen between thirty and forty, and are scarcely found in patients younger than twenty; this has been known to affect all lifestyles.|$|E
25|$|The {{posterior}} dorsal hip {{muscles are}} inserted on or directly below the greater trochanter of the femur. The tensor fasciae latae, {{stretching from the}} anterior superior iliac spine down into the iliotibial tract, presses {{the head of the}} femur into the acetabulum but also flexes, rotates medially, and abducts to hip joint. The <b>piriformis</b> originates on the anterior pelvic surface of the sacrum, passes through the greater sciatic foramen, and inserts on the posterior aspect of the tip of the greater trochanter. In a standing posture it is a lateral rotator, but it also assists extending the thigh. The gluteus maximus has its origin between (and around) the iliac crest and the coccyx from where one part radiates into the iliotibial tract and the other stretches down to the gluteal tuberosity under the greater trochanter. The gluteus maximus is primarily an extensor and lateral rotator of the hip joint, and it comes into action when climbing stairs or rising from a sitting to standing posture. Furthermore, the part inserted into the fascia latae abducts and the part inserted into the gluteal tuberosity adducts the hip. The two deep glutei muscles, the gluteus medius and minimus, originate on the lateral side of the pelvis. The medius muscle is shaped like a cap. Its anterior fibers act as a medial rotator and flexor; the posterior fibers as a lateral rotator and extensor; and the entire muscle abducts the hip. The minimus has similar functions and both muscles are inserted onto the greater trochanter.|$|E
2500|$|When the <b>piriformis</b> muscle shortens or spasms due to trauma or overuse, it can {{compress}} or strangle the {{sciatic nerve}} beneath the muscle. Generally, conditions {{of this type}} {{are referred to as}} nerve entrapment or as entrapment neuropathies; the particular condition known as <b>piriformis</b> syndrome refers to sciatica symptoms not originating from spinal roots and/or spinal disc compression, but involving the overlying <b>piriformis</b> muscle. In 17% of an assumed normal population the sciatic nerve passes through the <b>piriformis</b> muscle, rather than underneath it; however, in patients undergoing surgery for suspected <b>piriformis</b> syndrome such an anomaly was found only 16.2% of the time leading to doubt {{about the importance of the}} anomaly as a factor in <b>piriformis</b> syndrome. Some researchers discount the importance of this relationship in the etiology of the syndrome. [...] Oddly, MRI findings have shown that both hypertrophy (unusual largeness) and atrophy (unusually smallness) of the <b>piriformis</b> muscle correlate with the supposed condition.|$|E
2500|$|It {{has been}} theorized {{that people who}} {{regularly}} exercise by running, bicycling, and other forward-moving activities may be more susceptible to developing <b>piriformis</b> syndrome {{if they do not}} engage in lateral stretching and strengthening exercises. When not balanced by lateral movement of the legs, repeated forward movements can lead to disproportionately weak hip abductors and tight adductors. Thus, disproportionately weak hip abductors/gluteus medius muscles, combined with very tight adductor muscles, can cause the <b>piriformis</b> muscle to shorten and severely contract. This means the abductors on the outside cannot work properly and strain is put on the <b>piriformis.</b> [...] However, {{it is also possible that}} such people are actually experiencing small herniations in a spinal disc which then impinge on the sciatic nerve and cause the <b>piriformis</b> to spasm secondarily. [...] Evidence for a specific relationship between the strength or weakness of certain hip muscles and sciatic nerve pain centered around the <b>piriformis</b> muscle remains scant. [...] Also, this sports-related explanation is useless for understanding <b>piriformis</b> syndrome in those who are not unusually physically active (which is often the case).|$|E
2500|$|Possible {{causes of}} the {{syndrome}} are anatomical variations in the muscle-nerve relationship in the hip which place the <b>piriformis</b> muscle {{too close to the}} sciatic nerve (cadaver studies have shown this condition to be rather rare, however), or from simple overuse or strain that causes swelling in the muscle and compression on the nerve. [...] Other research has suggested that pinching of the S1 nerve around the spine may cause the <b>piriformis</b> muscle to spasm secondarily; regardless, pain {{in the area of the}} <b>piriformis</b> often co-occurs with bona fide sciatica.|$|E
2500|$|In 2012, 17.2% {{of lower}} back pain {{patients}} developed <b>piriformis</b> syndrome.|$|E
2500|$|Immediate though {{temporary}} {{relief of}} <b>piriformis</b> syndrome {{can usually be}} brought about by injection of a local anaesthetic into the <b>piriformis</b> muscle. [...] Symptomatic relief of muscle and nerve pain can also sometimes be obtained by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and/or muscle relaxants, though {{the use of such}} medication or even more powerful prescription medication for relief of sciatica is often assessed by patients to be largely ineffective at relieving pain. Conservative treatment usually begins with stretching exercises, myofascial release, massage, and avoidance of contributory activities such as running, bicycling, rowing, heavy lifting, etc. Some clinicians recommend formal physical therapy, including soft tissue mobilization, hip joint mobilization, teaching stretching techniques, and strengthening of the gluteus maximus, gluteus medius, and biceps femoris to reduce strain on the <b>piriformis.</b> More advanced physical therapy treatment can include pelvic-trochanter isometric stretching, hip abductor, external rotator and extensor strengthening exercises, [...] transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), and massage physiotherapy of the <b>piriformis</b> muscle region. One study of 14 people with what appeared to be <b>piriformis</b> syndrome indicated that rehabilitation programs that included physical therapy, low doses of muscle relaxants and pain relief medication were effective at alleviating most muscle and nerve pain caused by what the research subjects had been told was <b>piriformis</b> syndrome. [...] However, as this study included very few individuals and did not have a control group not receiving treatment (both serious methodological flaws), it provides no insight as to whether the pain in the <b>piriformis</b> would have simply dissipated on its own without any treatment at all and is therefore not only uninformative, it may actually be misleading. The injury is considered largely self-limiting and spontaneous recovery is usually on the order of a few days or a week to six weeks or longer if left untreated.|$|E
2500|$|In 2011, out of 263 {{patients}} {{between the}} ages of 45 to 84 treated for <b>piriformis</b> syndrome, 53.3% were female. Females are two times more likely to develop <b>piriformis</b> syndrome than males. [...] Moreover, females had longer stay in hospital during 2011 due to high prevalence of the pain in females. The average cost of treatment was $29,070 for hospitalizing average 4 days.|$|E
2500|$|Failure of {{conservative}} treatments such as stretching and {{strengthening of the}} <b>piriformis</b> muscle or {{a high level of}} immediate pain intensity may bring into consideration various therapeutic injections such as local anesthetics (e.g., lidocaine), Anti-inflammatory drugs and/or corticosteroids, botulinum toxin (BTX, BOTOX), or a combination of the three, all of which have a well-documented effectiveness at relieving muscle-related pain. Injection technique is a significant issue since the <b>piriformis</b> is a very deep seated muscle. A radiologist may assist in this clinical setting by injecting a small dose of medication containing a paralysing agent such as botulinum toxin under high-frequency ultrasound or CT control. This inactivates the <b>piriformis</b> muscle for 3 to 6 months, without resulting in leg weakness or impaired activity. [...] Though the <b>piriformis</b> muscle becomes inactivated, the surrounding muscles quickly take over its role without any noticeable change in strength or gait. [...] Such treatments may be more or less curative (with no return to pain), or may have limited timespans of effectiveness.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Piriformis</b> {{syndrome}} {{occurs when}} the sciatic nerve is compressed or pinched by the <b>piriformis</b> muscle of the hip. [...] It usually only affects one hip at a given time, though both hips may produce <b>piriformis</b> syndrome {{at some point in}} the patient's lifetime, and having had it once greatly increases the chance that it will recur in one hip or the other at some future point unless action is taken to prevent this. Indications include sciatica (radiating pain in the buttock, posterior thigh and lower leg) and the physical exam finding of tenderness in the area of the sciatic notch. If the <b>piriformis</b> muscle can be located beneath the other gluteal muscles, it will feel noticeably cord-like and will be painful to compress or massage. [...] The pain is exacerbated with any activity that causes flexion of the hip including lifting, prolonged sitting, or walking. The diagnosis is largely clinical and is one of exclusion. During a physical examination, attempts may be made to stretch the irritated <b>piriformis</b> and provoke sciatic nerve compression, such as the Freiberg test, the Pace test, the FABER test (flexion, abduction, external rotation), and the FAIR test (flexion, adduction, internal rotation). Conditions to be ruled out include herniated nucleus pulposus (HNP), facet arthropathy, spinal stenosis, and lumbar muscle strain.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Piriformis</b> {{syndrome}} is a controversial condition that, {{depending on the}} analysis, varies from a [...] "very rare" [...] cause to contributing to up to 8% of low back or buttock pain. In 17% of the population, the sciatic nerve runs through the <b>piriformis</b> muscle rather than beneath it. When the muscle shortens or spasms due to trauma or overuse, it is posited that this causes compression of the sciatic nerve. It has colloquially {{been referred to as}} [...] "wallet sciatica" [...] since a wallet carried in a rear hip pocket compresses the buttock muscles and sciatic nerve when the bearer sits down. [...] <b>Piriformis</b> syndrome causes sciatica when the nerve root itself remains normal and no herniation of a spinal disc is apparent.|$|E
2500|$|One {{large scale}} formal {{prospective}} outcome trial {{found that the}} weight of the evidence-based medicine is that <b>piriformis</b> syndrome should be considered as a possible diagnosis when sciatica occurs without a clear spinal cause. The need for controlled studies is supported by studies of spinal disc disease that show a high frequency of abnormal discs in asymptomatic patients. [...] Although damage to lower spinal discs is frequently associated with sciatic pain, such pain itself is not consistently associated with damaged discs, meaning other reasons (such as the swelling of the <b>piriformis</b> muscle) need to be considered, though spasms of the <b>piriformis</b> may also be caused by damage to the nerve roots of the sacrum— the causal relationship remains unclear, and the existence of the syndrome is itself open to question.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Piriformis</b> {{syndrome}} is a somewhat controversial {{diagnosis of a}} neuromuscular disorder which {{is related to the}} sciatic nerve. [...] According to the terms of the syndrome, the sciatic nerve becomes compressed or otherwise irritated by the <b>piriformis</b> muscle causing pain, tingling and numbness in the hip/ buttocks and along the path of the sciatic nerve descending the lower thigh and into the leg. It {{is one of the few}} conditions which causes posterior hip pain. [...] The condition has no external signs. [...] Diagnosis is often difficult due to few validated and standardized diagnostic tests, but two tests have been well-described and clinically validated: one is electrophysiological, called the FAIR-test, which measures delay in sciatic nerve conductions when the <b>piriformis</b> muscle is stretched against it. The other is magnetic resonance neurography, a type of MRI that highlights inflammation and the nerves themselves. Some say that the most important criterion is the exclusion of sciatica resulting from compression/irritation of spinal nerve roots, as by a herniated disc. However, compression may be present, but not causal, in the setting of sciatica due to <b>piriformis</b> syndrome. [...] Recovery time ranges between a few days to six weeks or more for complete recovery.|$|E
2500|$|The {{most common}} {{etiology}} of <b>piriformis</b> syndrome is that {{resulting from a}} specific previous injury due to trauma. Large injuries include trauma to the buttocks while [...] "micro traumas" [...] result from small repeated bouts of stress on the <b>piriformis</b> itself. To the extent that <b>piriformis</b> syndrome {{is the result of}} some type of trauma and not neuropathy, such secondary causes are considered preventable, especially those occurring in daily activities: according to this theory, periods of prolonged sitting, especially on hard surfaces, produce minor stress that can be relieved with bouts of standing. An individual's environment, including lifestyle factors and physical activity, determine susceptibility to trauma of any given type. Although empirical research findings on the subject have never been published, many believe that taking sensible precautions during high-impact sports and when working in physically demanding conditions may decrease the risk of experiencing <b>piriformis</b> syndrome, either by forestalling injury to the muscle itself or injury to the nerve root that causes it to spasm. In this vein, proper safety and padded equipment should be worn for protection during any type of regular, firm contact (i.e., American football, etc.). In the workplace, individuals are encouraged to make regular assessments of their surroundings and attempt to recognize those things in one's routine that might produce micro or macro traumas. [...] No research has substantiated the effectiveness of any such routine, however, and participation in one may do nothing but heighten an individual's sense of worry over physical minutiae while have no effect in reducing the likeliness of experiencing or re-experiencing <b>piriformis</b> syndrome.|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to causing gluteal pain that may radiate down buttock and the leg, the syndrome may present with pain that is relieved by walking with the {{foot on the}} involved side pointing outward. This position externally rotates the hip, lessening the stretch on the <b>piriformis</b> and relieving the pain slightly. <b>Piriformis</b> syndrome {{is also known as}} [...] "wallet sciatica" [...] or [...] "fat wallet syndrome," [...] as the condition can be caused or aggravated by sitting with a large wallet in the affected side's rear pocket.|$|E
2500|$|Diagnostic {{modalities}} such as CT scan, MRI, ultrasound, and EMG {{are mostly}} useful in excluding other conditions. However, magnetic resonance neurography {{is a medical}} imaging technique that can show the presence of irritation of the sciatic nerve {{at the level of}} the sciatic notch where the nerve passes under the <b>piriformis</b> muscle. Magnetic resonance neurography is considered [...] "investigational/not medically necessary" [...] by some insurance companies. Neurography can determine whether or not a patient has a split sciatic nerve or a split <b>piriformis</b> muscle – this may be important in getting a good result from injections or surgery. Image guided injections carried out in an open MRI scanner, or other 3D image guidance can accurately relax the <b>piriformis</b> muscle to test the diagnosis. Other injection methods such as blind injection, fluoroscopic guided injection, ultrasound, or EMG guidance can work but are not as reliable and have other drawbacks.|$|E
2500|$|One {{research}} group reported {{a case study}} of a single individual with <b>piriformis</b> syndrome whose symptoms were entirely resolved through physical therapy sessions that worked to strengthen the hip abductors, external rotators and extensors. This treatment involved three phases: non-weight bearing exercises, weight bearing exercises, and ballistic exercises. The purpose of non-weight bearing exercises is to focus on isolated muscle recruitment. Ballistic and dynamic exercises consists of plyometrics. [...] As this was {{a case study of}} a single individual, however, its statistical significance is meaningless and it may indicate nothing important regarding <b>piriformis</b> syndrome.|$|E
2500|$|The {{sciatic nerve}} is formed from the L4 to S3 {{segments}} of the sacral plexus, a collection of nerve fibres that emerge from the sacral part of the spinal cord. The fibres unite to form a single nerve {{in front of the}} <b>piriformis</b> muscle. The nerve passes beneath <b>piriformis</b> and through the greater sciatic foramen, exiting the pelvis. From here, it travels down the posterior thigh to the popliteal fossa. The nerve travels in the posterior compartment of the thigh behind (superficial to) the adductor magnus muscle, and is itself in front of (deep to) one head of the biceps femoris muscle. At the popliteal fossa, the nerve divides into its two branches: ...|$|E
2500|$|Other {{suggestions}} from some researchers and physical therapists have included prevention strategies include warming up before physical activity, practicing correct exercise form, stretching, and doing strength training, though these are often suggested for helping treat or prevent any physical injury {{and are not}} piriformis-specific in their approach As with any type of exercise, {{it is thought that}} warmups will decrease the risk of injury during flexion or rotation of the hip. Stretching increases range of motion, while strengthening hip adductors and abductors theoretically allows the <b>piriformis</b> to tolerate trauma more readily. However, to the extent that <b>piriformis</b> syndrome is actually related to sciatic nerve pain based in the spine, physically [...] "warming up" [...] the hip muscles will have no effect in preventing disc herniation and subsequent experience of pain along the sciatic pathway.|$|E
2500|$|Stretching of {{the tight}} {{structures}} (<b>piriformis,</b> hip abductor, and hip flexor muscle) may alleviate the symptoms. The involved muscle is stretched (for 30 seconds), {{repeated three times}} separated by 30 second to 1 minute rest periods, in sets performed two times daily for six to eight weeks. [...] This should allow the soldier to progress back into jogging until symptoms disappear.|$|E
2500|$|Pain {{caused by}} a {{compression}} or irritation of the sciatic nerve by {{a problem in the}} lower back is called sciatica. [...] Common causes of sciatica include the following lower back and hip conditions: [...] spinal disc herniation, degenerative disc disease, lumbar spinal stenosis, spondylolisthesis, and <b>piriformis</b> syndrome. [...] Other acute causes of sciatica include coughing, muscular hypertension, and sneezing.|$|E
2500|$|For {{rare cases}} with unrelenting chronic pain, surgery may be recommended. [...] Surgical {{release of the}} <b>piriformis</b> muscle is often effective. Minimal access surgery using newly {{reported}} techniques has also proven successful in a large-scale formal outcome published in 2005. [...] As with injections, the deactivated/ excised muscle's role in leg movement is completely compensated for by surrounding hip muscles.|$|E
