2500|$|Brodovitch's {{task was}} to bring American {{advertising}} design up {{to the level of}} Europe's, which was thought to have a far more modern spirit. Before his arrival, advertising students were simply copying the magazine styles of N. C. Wyeth and Howard Pyle. The illustrations were beautiful, but had evolved from the tradition of 19th-century romantic realism, a thing of the past. Brodovitch's teaching technique, on the other hand, was unlike any other the students had been exposed to. He would always teach with a visual aid. Brodovitch would bring into class French and German magazines to examine the pages with his students, explaining the artist's work or technique. He would raise questions like, [...] "Could this line be better? Could it be like, for example, Cocteau?" [...] When not in the classroom, Brodovitch would take the class on outings around Philadelphia to see factories, laboratories, shopping centers, housing projects, dumps, and the zoo. The students were then told to make a [...] "graphic impression" [...] of what they had seen, whether a <b>photographic</b> <b>interpretation,</b> a drawing, or an abstraction.

40|$|International audienceWe report new Sm–Nd, Lu–Hf, and Pb–Pb mineral and whole-rock isotope {{data for}} the basaltic {{shergottite}} Zagami, as well as Pb–Pb whole-rock isotope {{data for the}} basaltic shergottite Los Angeles, the lherzolitic shergottite Dar-al-Gani 476 (DaG 476), and the clinopyroxenite Nakhla. In agreement with previous findings, our new Sm–Nd and Lu–Hf mineral ages on the Martian meteorite Zagami are young (155 and 185 Ma, respectively). The 207 Pb/ 206 Pb– 204 Pb/ 206 Pb compositions of the insoluble fractions of shergottites (Zagami, Los Angeles, and literature data for Shergotty and EETA 79001) form an excellent alignment indicative of a 4. 0 Ga crystallization age. The range of Pb isotope compositions observed in the leachates of these samples attests to negligible contamination of the shergottites by terrestrial Pb and argues against mixing relationships. The age of 4. 048 ± 0. 017 Ga (MSWD = 1. 5) provided by the Pb isotope compositions of the Zagami whole-rock and residues is therefore taken to date the crystallization of this rock, which, so far, {{was believed to be}} only not, vert, similar 180 Ma old. Based on this result, we argue that the lithosphere of Mars is extremely old and that most mineral ages were reset recently by acidic aqueous solutions percolating through the Martian surface. This interpretation is consistent with <b>photographic</b> <b>interpretations</b> of erosional features on Mars. It also relieves the constraint imposed by the presence of anomalies of 142 Nd and 182 W (both products of extinct radioactive nuclides) that the Martian mantle should have preserved primordial isotopic heterogeneities, thus allowing for the planet interior to be actively convecting...|$|R

40|$|This {{qualitative}} arts-based {{research study}} explores family literacy experiences {{that occur in}} homes with adults and children through interviews, observations, and the visual analysis of photographs that document such experiences. I employ visual methodologies to examine how families view, experience, and talk about family literacy and literacy in their social and cultural lives. This study is guided by the following questions: 1) What social and cultural practices do families employ as they engage in literacy experiences in their homes? 2) How and where are social and cultural family literacy experiences visually represented? 3) How can visual representations of family literacy experiences be interpreted? The research that investigates sites of family literacy within the home, is limited in general, and even less research has used visual methodologies to examine literacy within the home. I chose to study family literacy sites, practices and experiences because I want to understand how society and culture influence literacy skills.

40|$|International audienceThe future ExoMars rover mission (ESA/Roscosmos), to be {{launched}} in 2018, will investigate the habitability of the Martian surface and near subsurface, and search for traces of past life {{in the form of}} textural biosignatures and organic molecules. In support of this mission, a selection of relevant Mars analogue materials has been characterised and stored in the International Space Analogue Rockstore (ISAR), hosted in Orléans, France. Two ISAR samples were analysed by prototypes of the ExoMars rover instruments used for petrographic study. The objective was to determine whether a full interpretation of the rocks could be achieved {{on the basis of the}} data obtained by the ExoMars visible-IR imager and spectrometer (MicrOmega), the close-up imager (CLUPI), the drill infrared spectrometer (Ma_Miss) and the Raman spectrometer (RLS), first separately then in their entirety. In order to not influence the initial instrumental interpretation, the samples were sent to the different teams without any additional information. This first step was called the “Blind Test” phase. The data obtained by the instruments were then complemented with photography of the relevant outcrops (as would be available during the ExoMars mission) before being presented to two geologists tasked with the interpretation. The context data and photography of the outcrops and of the samples were sufficient for the geologists to identify the rocks. This initial identification was crucial for the subsequent, iterative interpretation of the spectroscopic data. The data from the different spectrometers was, thus, cross-calibrated against the <b>photographic</b> <b>interpretations</b> and against each other. In this way, important mineralogical details, such as evidence of aqueous alteration of the rocks, provided relevant information concerning potential habitable conditions. The final conclusion from this test is that, when processed together, the ExoMars payload instruments produce complementary data allowing reliable interpretation of the geological context and potential for habitable environments. This background information is fundamental for the analysis and interpretation of organics in the processed Martian rocks...|$|R

40|$|The thesis {{examines}} {{the work of}} photographer Nick Hedges (b. 1943) who made photographs for the housing charity Shelter between 1968 and 1972. It concentrates on Hedges’ methodology, his representation of the homeless child, and how this was deployed in Shelter’s campaign strategy. Moreover, it {{examines the}} wider political, sociological and cultural debates surrounding the conception, production, dissemination and reception of the Shelter photographs. The thesis argues that Hedges’ photographs, although contextualised by an ostensibly radical charity agenda, were shaped by an established photographic and art historical tradition reaching back to the nineteenth century. This is examined {{in the light of}} a shifting conception of what constituted an ethically sound representation of homelessness amongst leftist critics in Britain from the 1970 s onwards. The thesis equally discusses the archive as a site of <b>photographic</b> accession, <b>interpretation</b> and display, and outlines the issues that face archive professionals charged with the presentation of the Shelter photographs to a contemporary audience. By combining art historical analysis of Hedges’ photographs with research into their current framing in the archive, the thesis offers a distinctive contribution to scholarship, exploring how photographic meaning is shaped, subverted and disseminated by individuals, organisations and institutions alike...|$|R
40|$|Terrain {{patterns}} play {{an important}} role in determining the nature of water resources and related hydrological modelling. Digital Elevation Models (DEMs), offering an efficient way to represent ground surface, allow automated direct extraction of hydrological features (Garbrecht and Martz, 1999), thus bringing advantages in terms of processing efficiency, cost effectiveness, and accuracy assessment, compared with traditional methods based on topographic maps, field surveys, or <b>photographic</b> <b>interpretations.</b> However, researchers have found that DEM quality and resolution affect the accuracy of any extracted hydrological features (Kenward et al., 2000). Therefore, DEM quality and resolution must be specified according to the nature and application of the hydrological features. The most commonly used DEM in Victoria, Australia is Vicmap Elevation delivered by the Land Victoria, Department of Sustainability and Environment. It was produced by using elevation data mainly derived from existing contour map at a scale of 1 : 25, 000 and digital stereo capture, providing a state-wide terrain surface representation with a horizontal resolution of 20 metres. The claimed standard deviations, vertical and horizontal, are 5 metres and 10 metres respectively (Land- Victoria, 2002). In worst case, horizontal errors could be up to ± 30 m. Although high resolution stereo aerial photos provide a potential way to generate high resolution DEMs, under the limitations of currently used technologies by prevalent commercial photogrammetry software, only DSMs (Digital Surface Models) other than DEMs can be directly generated. Manual removal of the nonground data so that the DSM is transformed into a DEM is time consuming. Therefore, using stereo aerial photos to produce DEM with currently available techniques is not an accurate and costeffective method. Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data covering 6900 km² of the Corangamite Catchment area of Victoria were collected over the period 19 July 2003 to 10 August 2003. It will be used to support a series of salinity and water management projects for the Corangamite Catchment Management Authority (CCMA). The DEM derived from the LiDAR data has a vertical accuracy of 0. 5 m and a horizontal accuracy of 1. 5 m. The high quality DEM leads to derive much detailed terrain and hydrological attributes with high accuracy. Available data sources of DEMs in a catchment management area were evaluated in this study, including the Vicmap DEM, a DEM generated from stereo aerial photos, and LiDAR-derived DEM. LiDAR technology and LiDAR derived DEM were described. In order to assess the capability of LiDAR-derived DEM for improving the quality of extracted hydrological features, sub-catchment boundaries and drainage networks were generated from the Vicmap DEM and the LiDAR-derived DEM. Results were compared and analysed in terms of accuracy and resolution of DEMs. Elevation differences between Vicmap and LiDAR-derived DEMs are significant, up to 65 m in some areas. Subcatchment boundaries derived from these two DEMs are also quite different. In spite of using same resolution for the Vicmap DEM and the LiDARderived DEM, high accuracy LiDAR-derived DEM gave a detailed delineation of sub-catchment. Compared with results derived from LiDAR DEM, the drainage networks derived from Vicmap DEM do not give a detailed description, and even lead to discrepancies in some areas. It is demonstrated that a LiDAR-derived DEM with high accuracy and high resolution offers the capability of improving the quality of hydrological features extracted from DEMs. ...|$|R
