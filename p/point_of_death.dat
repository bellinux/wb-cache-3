5|$|Further details {{concerning}} Sejanus' fall {{are provided}} by Cassius Dio, writing nearly 200 years later in his Roman History. It appears that, when Tiberius heard to what extent Sejanus had already usurped his authority in Rome, he immediately took steps to remove him from power. However, he realised that an outright condemnation could provoke Sejanus to attempt a coup. Instead, Tiberius addressed a number of contradictory letters to the Senate, some of which praised Sejanus and his friends and some of which denounced them. Tiberius variously {{announced that he would}} arrive in Rome the next day or that he was at the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>death.</b> He stepped down as consul, forcing Sejanus to do the same and conferred an honorary priesthood upon Caligula, rekindling popular support for the house of Germanicus. The ensuing confusion was successful in alienating Sejanus from many of his followers. With the intentions of the emperor no longer clear, it was now deemed a safer course of action at Rome to withdraw from overt support to Sejanus until the matter was clearly settled.|$|E

25|$|A lack {{of oxygen}} or {{chemical}} changes in the lungs may cause the heart to stop beating. This cardiac arrest stops {{the flow of blood}} and thus stops the transport of oxygen to the brain. Cardiac arrest used to be the traditional <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> but at this point there is still a chance of recovery. The brain cannot survive long without oxygen and the continued {{lack of oxygen}} in the blood combined with the cardiac arrest will lead to the deterioration of brain cells causing first brain damage and eventually brain death from which recovery is generally considered impossible. The brain will die after approximately six minutes without oxygen at normal body temperature, but hypothermia of the central nervous system may prolong this.|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectivesThis study {{sought to}} {{determine}} the short- and long-term outcome of primary coronary angioplasty and thrombolytic therapy for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in patients older than 75 years of age. BackgroundThe benefit of reperfusion therapy in elderly patients with AMI is uncertain, although elderly people account for a large proportion <b>of</b> <b>deaths.</b> MethodsWe randomly assigned a total of 87 patients with an AMI who were older than 75 years to treatment with angioplasty or intravenous (IV) streptokinase. Clinical outcome was measured by taking the end <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> and the combination <b>of</b> <b>death,</b> reinfarction or stroke during follow-up. ResultsThe primary end <b>point,</b> a composite <b>of</b> <b>death,</b> reinfarction or stroke, at 30 days had occurred in 4 (9 %) patients in the angioplasty group as compared with 12 (29 %) in the thrombolysis group (p = 0. 01, relative risk [RR]: 4. 3, 95 % confidence interval [CI]: 1. 2 to 20. 0). At one year the corresponding figures were 6 (13 %) and 18 (44 %), respectively (p = 0. 001, RR: 5. 2, 95 % CI: 1. 7 to 18. 1). ConclusionsIn this series of patients with AMI who were older than 75 years, primary coronary angioplasty had a significant clinical benefit when compared with IV streptokinase therapy...|$|R

25|$|After {{moving to}} Carthage, Maximus studied several Neo-Platonist writers {{and became a}} {{prominent}} author. When {{one of his friends}} began espousing the Christological position known as Monothelitism, Maximus was drawn into the controversy, in which he supported the Chalcedonian position that Jesus had both a human and a divine will. Maximus is venerated in both Eastern Christianity and Western Christianity. His Christological positions eventually resulted in his torture and exile, soon after which he died. However, his theology was vindicated by the Third Council of Constantinople, and he was venerated as a saint soon after his death. His feast day is celebrated twice during the year: on 21 January and on 13 August. His title of Confessor means that he suffered for the faith, but not to the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>death,</b> and thus is distinguished from a martyr.

40|$|Background Anemia is {{prevalent}} {{in patients with}} chronic heart failure, the proportion of which increases with deteriorating New York Heart Association functional class. Anemia is also associated with increased symptoms, more frequent hospitalizations, and, in some studies, with an increased mortality rate. We have demonstrated that N-terminal brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) is a powerful predictor <b>of</b> <b>death</b> in advanced heart failure and is superior to the traditional markers of chronic heart failure (CHF) severity. However, to date, there are no published data that compare the prognostic ability of NT-proBNP with that of hemoglobin and hematocrit in patients with advanced heart failure who are referred for consideration of cardiac transplantation {{at a time when}} erythropoietin is under investigation as a treatment option in such a population. Methods and Results We prospectively studied 182 consecutive patients with advanced CHF who had been referred for consideration of cardiac transplantation. Blood samples were taken at recruitment for routine investigation and for NT-proBNP analysis; the patients' condition was followed for a median of 554 days. The primary end <b>point</b> <b>of</b> all-cause <b>death</b> was reached in 30 patients, and the secondary end <b>point</b> <b>of</b> all-cause <b>death</b> or urgent cardiac transplantation was reached in 34 patients. The mean hemoglobin level was 13. 9 ± 2. 2 g/dL, and the median concentration of NT-proBNP was 1505 pg/mL (interquartile range, 517 – 4015). The only multivariate predictor <b>of</b> all-cause <b>death</b> (χ 2 = 14. 2; P &# 60;. 001) or the secondary end <b>point</b> <b>of</b> all-cause <b>death</b> or urgent transplantation (χ 2 = 21. 8; P &# 60;. 001) was an NT-proBNP concentration above the median value. Conclusion A single measurement of NT-proBNP in patients with advanced CHF can help to identify patients who are at a higher risk <b>of</b> <b>death</b> and is a better prognostic marker than anemia...|$|R

25|$|There {{are three}} states of afterlife in Catholic belief. Heaven {{is a time}} of glorious union with God and a life of unspeakable joy that lasts forever.

It is a state requiring penance and purgation of sin through God's mercy aided by the prayers of others. Finally, those who freely chose a life of sin and selfishness, were not sorry for their sins and had no intention of changing their ways go to hell, an everlasting separation from God. The Church teaches that no one is condemned to hell without freely deciding to reject God and his love. He predestines no one to hell and no one can determine whether anyone else has been condemned.

40|$|AbstractOBJECTIVEThis {{study was}} {{performed}} to assess the effect of treatment with ramipril on the incidence of cardiac events after invasive revascularization in patients with asymptomatic moderate left ventricular dysfunction. BACKGROUNDIn patients with angina pectoris and left ventricular dysfunction, both invasive revascularization and treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors reduce cardiac mortality and morbidity. Whether there is a benefit from combining the two treatment strategies has never been evaluated prospectively. METHODSAfter invasive revascularization, 159 patients with preoperative chronic stable angina pectoris, left ventricular ejection fraction between 0. 30 and 0. 50 and no clinical heart failure {{were randomly assigned to}} receive double-blind treatment with either ramipril or placebo and subsequently followed for a median of 33 months. RESULTSRamipril reduced the incidence of the triple-composite end <b>point</b> <b>of</b> cardiac <b>death,</b> acute myocardial infarction or clinical heart failure (risk reduction 58 %; 95 % confidence interval 7 % to 80 %, p = 0. 031). The incidence of the quadruple-composite end <b>point</b> <b>of</b> cardiac <b>death,</b> acute myocardial infarction, clinical heart failure or recurrent angina pectoris was not altered with ramipril. These findings were consistent across subgroups with respect to left ventricular ejection fraction below or above 0. 40, and whether coronary artery bypass grafting or percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty was performed. CONCLUSIONSIn patients with angina pectoris and asymptomatic moderate left ventricular dysfunction, long-term treatment with ramipril after invasive revascularization significantly reduced the incidence of the composite end <b>point</b> <b>of</b> cardiac <b>death,</b> acute myocardial infarction or clinical heart failure, indicating that the beneficial effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor treatment may be extended to include treatment of this patient group...|$|R

500|$|... is a {{forbidden}} summoning jutsu {{that is used}} {{to revive}} the dead in a state of near-life. The process of this jutsu begins by obtaining a genetic sample from the deceased, either through grave robbery or blood stains and salvaged organs. A living person is then sacrificed for the deceased spirit to inhabit and serve as a slave to the user's will. However, the Jutsu can only function if the deceased soul is within the realm of Pure Land and not elsewhere in the afterlife like in the stomach of the Reaper. Though it was the Tobirama Senju who invented the Reanimation Jutsu for the purpose of creating an indestructible army used in suicide attacks, the jutsu was later completed by Orochimaru when he [...] revived Tobirama Senju and Hashirama Senju. Kabuto perfected the jutsu {{to the point where he}} is able to revive dozens of ninja in one execution, needing to focus all his mental energy to fully control them. People revived through this process are almost invulnerable to even the most fatal attacks, as they will simply regenerate any damage taken (although it takes some time for especially damaging attacks like Rasengan and they can also be paralyzed by specific attacks, such as poison). Having already died, the resurrected expel any basic needs living people required; they have unlimited chakra and power due to not needing to replenish them. In addition, they cannot be subjected to genjutsu jutsu that affect living things like the Infinite Tsukuyomi. The only effective means to destroy a ninja brought back is with Yin-Yang Style techniques that damage the body beyond regeneration to the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>death.</b>|$|E
