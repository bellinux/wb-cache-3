5|$|Neon {{played a}} role in the basic {{understanding}} of the nature of atoms in 1913, when J. J. Thomson, as part of his exploration into the composition of canal rays, channeled streams of neon ions through a magnetic and an electric field and measured the deflection of the streams with a <b>photographic</b> <b>plate.</b> Thomson observed two separate patches of light on the <b>photographic</b> <b>plate</b> (see image), which suggested two different parabolas of deflection. Thomson eventually concluded that some of the atoms in the neon gas were of higher mass than the rest. Though not understood at the time by Thomson, this was the first discovery of isotopes of stable atoms. Thomson's device was a crude version of the instrument we now term a mass spectrometer.|$|E
5|$|One model had its lens {{fixed to}} a bag bellows. A scissor {{mechanism}} held the bellows in its expanded state until {{the photo was}} taken, but condensed it immediately afterwards. This allowed one exposure of size 6cm×9cm on a <b>photographic</b> <b>plate,</b> at a focal length of 85mm.|$|E
5|$|Double- and multi- {{exposure}} holography is one {{of three}} methods used to create holographic interferograms. A first exposure records the object in an unstressed state. Subsequent exposures on the same <b>photographic</b> <b>plate</b> are made while the object is subjected to some stress. The composite image depicts the difference between the stressed and unstressed states.|$|E

5|$|Before 1907, all {{magnitude}} {{measurements for}} stars were obtained through visual comparison of relative brightness, {{a process that}} was slow and inexact. Later photographic methods would use starlight to make a representation on a <b>photographic</b> <b>plate.</b> Regardless, neither method was adequate for quantitative measurements. The drawback of previous methods of measuring stellar magnitude made the use of electricity for empirically gathering astronomical data revolutionary for the science of astronomy. Joel Stebbins' pioneering research for astronomical photometry {{took place at the}} observatory.|$|E
5|$|That same year, J.J. Thomson {{conducted}} {{an experiment in}} which he channeled a stream of neon ions through magnetic and electric fields, striking a <b>photographic</b> <b>plate</b> at the other end. He observed two glowing patches on the plate, which suggested two different deflection trajectories. Thomson concluded this was {{because some of the}} neon ions had a different mass. The nature of this differing mass would later be explained by the discovery of neutrons in 1932.|$|E
5|$|These {{include two}} images {{that show the}} subject standing. One captures a full length view, in which the subject is unclothed except {{for a pair of}} {{stockings}} and shoes. In the other, the subject's right leg is raised to provide a clearer view of the genitalia. Another image presents the subject lying back with one arm covering the face while someone else's hand pulls on the penile tissue. A similar photograph shows the subject in an examination position, with a hand– visible in the uncut <b>photographic</b> <b>plate</b> as belonging to Maisonneuve– spreading the vaginal lips. The series also includes a close-up of the subject's genitalia, with the legs open.|$|E

5|$|The {{idea that}} {{crystals}} {{could be used}} as a diffraction grating for X-rays arose in 1912 in a conversation between Paul Peter Ewald and Max von Laue in the English Garden in Munich. Ewald had proposed a resonator model of crystals for his thesis, but this model could not be validated using visible light, since the wavelength was much larger than the spacing between the resonators. Von Laue realized that electromagnetic radiation of a shorter wavelength was needed to observe such small spacings, and suggested that X-rays might have a wavelength comparable to the unit-cell spacing in crystals. Von Laue worked with two technicians, Walter Friedrich and his assistant Paul Knipping, to shine a beam of X-rays through a copper sulfate crystal and record its diffraction on a <b>photographic</b> <b>plate.</b> After being developed, the plate showed a large number of well-defined spots arranged in a pattern of intersecting circles around the spot produced by the central beam. Von Laue developed a law that connects the scattering angles and the size and orientation of the unit-cell spacings in the crystal, for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1914.|$|E

25|$|The use of X-rays as an {{important}} medical diagnostic tool began with their discovery in 1895 by German physicist Wilhelm Röntgen. He noticed that these rays could penetrate the skin, allowing the skeletal structure to be captured on a specially treated <b>photographic</b> <b>plate.</b>|$|E

5000|$|In 1951 Dutch {{astronomer}} Peter van de Kamp and {{his student}} Sarah Lippincott claimed the astrometric detection of a planetary system using <b>photographic</b> <b>plates</b> {{taken with the}} 24 in refractor telescope at Swarthmore College's Sproul Observatory. In 1960, Sarah Lippincott repeated the 1951 claim of a planetary system, only this time having different parameters. She used the original <b>photographic</b> <b>plates</b> and new plates taken with the same telescope. [...] <b>Photographic</b> <b>plates</b> from this observatory, taken at the same time, were used by Van de Kamp for his erroneous claim of a planetary system for Barnard's Star. The <b>photographic</b> <b>plates</b> made with the Sproul 24-inch refractor and used for these and other studies were later shown to be flawed. The claims of planetary companions for both stars were refuted in 1974 with astrometric measurements made by George Gatewood of the Allegheny Observatory.|$|R

25|$|In 1912, {{as part of}} his {{exploration}} into the composition of the streams of positively charged particles then known as canal rays, Thomson and his research assistant F. W. Aston channelled a stream of neon ions through a magnetic and an electric field and measured its deflection by placing a <b>photographic</b> <b>plate</b> in its path. They observed two patches of light on the <b>photographic</b> <b>plate</b> (see image on right), which suggested two different parabolas of deflection, and concluded that neon is composed of atoms of two different atomic masses (neon-20 and neon-22), that is to say of two isotopes. This was the first evidence for isotopes of a stable element; Frederick Soddy had previously proposed the existence of isotopes to explain the decay of certain radioactive elements.|$|E
25|$|The {{image on}} the shroud is much clearer in {{black-and-white}} negative than in its natural sepia color, and this negative image was first observed in 1898 on the reverse <b>photographic</b> <b>plate</b> of amateur photographer Secondo Pia, who was allowed to photograph it while it was being exhibited. A variety of methods have been proposed {{for the formation of}} the image, but the actual method used has not yet been conclusively identified. Despite numerous investigations and tests, the status of the Shroud of Turin remains murky, {{and the nature of the}} image and how it was fixed on the cloth remain puzzling. The shroud continues to be both intensely studied and controversial.|$|E
25|$|Optical {{or light}} {{microscopy}} involves passing visible light transmitted through or reflected {{from the sample}} through a single lens or multiple lenses to allow a magnified view of the sample. The resulting image can be detected directly by the eye, imaged on a <b>photographic</b> <b>plate,</b> or captured digitally. The single lens with its attachments, or the system of lenses and imaging equipment, along with the appropriate lighting equipment, sample stage, and support, makes up the basic light microscope. The most recent development is the digital microscope, which uses a CCD camera {{to focus on the}} exhibit of interest. The image is shown on a computer screen, so eye-pieces are unnecessary.|$|E

It was their job to check the <b>photographic</b> <b>plates</b> taken on behalf of Harlow Shapley, then Director at Harvard.

50|$|OJ 287 is a BL Lac object located 3.5 billion {{light-years away}} that has {{produced}} quasi-periodic optical outbursts going back approximately 120 years, as first apparent on <b>photographic</b> <b>plates</b> from 1891. It has been seen on <b>photographic</b> <b>plates</b> since at least 1887. It was first detected at radio wavelengths {{during the course of}} the Ohio Sky Survey.|$|R
50|$|<b>Photographic</b> <b>plates</b> {{were also}} an {{important}} tool in early high-energy physics, as they get blackened by ionizing radiation. For example, in the 1910s, Victor Franz Hess discovered cosmic radiation as it left traces on stacks of <b>photographic</b> <b>plates,</b> which he left for that purpose on high mountains or sent into the even higher atmosphere using balloons.|$|R
25|$|The galaxy Maffei 1 was {{discovered}} on a hyper-sensitized I-N <b>photographic</b> <b>plate</b> exposed on 29 September 1967 with the Schmidt telescope at Asiago Observatory. Maffei found Maffei 1, together with its companion spiral galaxy Maffei 2, while searching for diffuse nebulae and T Tauri stars. The object had an apparent size up to 50″ {{in the near}} infrared but was not visible on the corresponding blue light sensitive plate. Its spectrum lacked any emission or absorption lines. Later it was shown to be radio-quiet as well. In 1970 Hyron Spinrad suggested that Maffei 1 is a nearby heavily obscured giant elliptical galaxy. Maffei 1 would be among the ten brightest galaxies in the northern sky if not situated behind the Milky Way.|$|E
25|$|A {{currently}} familiar depiction {{is that on}} the Shroud of Turin, whose records go back to 1353. Controversy {{surrounds the}} shroud and its exact origin remains subject to debate. The Shroud of Turin is respected by Christians of several traditions, including Baptists, Catholics, Lutherans, Methodists, Orthodox, Pentecostals, and Presbyterians. It {{is one of the}} Catholic devotions approved by the Holy See, that to the Holy Face of Jesus, now uses the image of the face on the shroud as it appeared in the negative of the photograph taken by amateur photographer Secondo Pia in 1898. The image cannot be clearly seen on the shroud itself with the naked eye, and it surprised Pia {{to the extent that he}} said he almost dropped and broke the <b>photographic</b> <b>plate</b> when he first saw the developed negative image on it in the evening of 28 May 1898.|$|E
25|$|The {{required}} {{exposure time}} {{depended on the}} lighting conditions, {{the sensitivity of the}} <b>photographic</b> <b>plate,</b> and the camera lens aperture used. In a letter to Leo Tolstoy requesting a portrait sitting, Prokudin-Gorsky described the exposure as taking one to three seconds, but later, when recollecting his time with Tolstoy, he described a six-second exposure on a sunny day. Blaise Agüera y Arcas studied one landscape view, photographed in broad daylight but showing a clear, well-defined moon, and used the moon's movement to estimate that the whole procedure of three filtered exposures and two repositionings of the camera's plate holder had taken over a minute. The lens aperture Prokudin-Gorsky chose to use greatly affected the exposure time required. A small aperture is often used for landscape photography because it allows objects at various distances to all be sharply imaged at the same time, while the use of a large aperture is common for portraiture and plainly evident in the Tolstoy portrait. All other factors being equal, if for example a 16-second exposure was required when using a 1/4-inch-diameter aperture, an exposure of only 1 second would suffice with a 1-inch aperture.|$|E

(In the early 1900s, women were not allowed to operate telescopes.) Because Leavitt had independent means, Pickering initially did not have to pay her. Later, she received $0.30 an hour for her work. She was reportedly “hard-working, serious-minded …, little given to frivolous pursuits and selflessly devoted to her family, her church, and her career.” ...|$|E
500|$|Elsie's father, Arthur, was a keen amateur photographer, and {{had set up}} his own darkroom.

Two months later the girls borrowed his camera again, and this time returned with a photograph of Elsie sitting on the lawn holding out her hand to a [...] gnome. Exasperated by what he believed to be [...] "nothing but a prank", and convinced that the girls must have tampered with his camera in some way, Arthur Wright refused to lend it to them again.

Since the position of Mars may also be deduced from the observed RA and Dec positions of Phobos and Deimos, we can also assess the accuracy of Mars' ephemeris. First astrometric results will be presented...|$|R
