40|$|The {{technique}} of behavioral contracting {{is used to}} strengthen the control of family and school over the behavior of delinquents. A behavioral contract {{is a means of}} scheduling the exchange of <b>positive</b> <b>reinforcements</b> among two or more persons. The use of these contracts is predicated upon four assumptions: (1) receipt of <b>positive</b> <b>reinforcements</b> in interpersonal exchanges is a privilege rather than a right; (2) effective interpersonal agreements are governed by the norm of reciprocity; (3) the value of an interpersonal exchange is a direct function of the range, rate and magnitude of the <b>positive</b> <b>reinforcements</b> mediated by that exchange; and (4) rules create freedom in interpersonal exchanges. The use of a behavioral contract with one delinquent girl is described and analyzed using Markovian methods...|$|R
40|$|This article {{presents}} a {{research on the}} influence of <b>positive</b> <b>reinforcements</b> on motivation for education and training activities. The study is conducted in a real educational environment. Numerous different theories perceive the motivation of the individual as a driving force for every action and behavior. In this paper, we draw attention to the <b>positive</b> <b>reinforcements,</b> rewards and incentives provided in the learning process, which could influence the motivation for learning and respectively the better performance of the students. The subject of the study is the <b>positive</b> <b>reinforcements,</b> rewards and incentives provided in the training process. The object of the study is cadets {{in the last year of}} their education in the Military Science professional field, specializing in Organization and Management of Military Units at a Tactical Level at the National Military University in Bulgaria. The study includes students and cadets in the first year of education as control groups for comparison. Keywords...|$|R
5|$|Behavioral {{researchers}} have found that a choice for instant versus delayed gratification is influenced by several factors including whether the reward is negative or <b>positive</b> <b>reinforcement.</b> A past study by Solnick et al., focused on an experiment where the main concentrations were time added to both conditions and the preference of the participants with experiencing a loud noise for variable amounts of time: 15, 30, 60, and 90 seconds. The buttons to turn off the noise were manipulated by one button turning off the noise for {{a short amount of time}} and the other turning the noise off for an extended time. The participants were found to be more willing to turn off the noise immediately for 90 seconds rather than turning it off for the 120 seconds after a 60-second delay was issued. Findings illustrate that participants chose not to delay their gratification for the relief of noise but rather instantly silence it for a shorter amount of time.|$|E
5|$|In a Year 3 {{elementary}} {{classroom in}} South Wales a teacher was having difficulty keeping three girls on task during designated private study times. The teacher reached for aid from behavior analysts, and a delayed gratification behavior modification plan {{was put into}} place. The study gave limits on the amounts of questions the children could ask, {{and if they did}} not exceed the limit, they were given tokens for rewards. The token economy for rewards is an example of delayed gratification, by way of cool processing. Instead of having the girls focus on attention-seeking behaviors that distracted the teacher and the students, the teacher had them focus on how many questions they had, and if they needed to ask for help from the teacher. They also focused on gaining tokens rather than focusing on the final reward, which increased their delays. By giving the children this goal and the promise of <b>positive</b> <b>reinforcement</b> for good behavior, the girls dropped their rate of question-asking and attention-seeking.|$|E
5|$|The use {{of marine}} mammals by the Navy, even in {{accordance}} with the Navy's policy, continues to meet opposition. The Navy's policy says that only <b>positive</b> <b>reinforcement</b> is to be used while training the military dolphins, and that they be cared for {{in accordance with}} accepted standards in animal care. The inevitable stresses involved in training are topics of controversy, as their treatment is unlike the animals' natural lifestyle, especially towards their confined spaces when not training. There is also controversy over the use of muzzles and other inhibitors, which prevent the dolphins from foraging for food while working. The Navy states that this is to prevent them from ingesting harmful objects, but conservation activists say this is done to reinforce the trainers' control over the dolphins, who hand out food rewards. The means of transportation is also an issue for conservation activists, since they are hauled in dry carriers, and switching tanks and introducing the dolphin to new dolphins is potentially dangerous as they are territorial.|$|E

5|$|Detective Mode, {{allowing}} {{the investigation of}} crimes, was not considered an improvement by Kotaku and GameSpot; while they considered it a good idea, its execution was minimal since a player simply looks for the next highlighted piece of evidence rather than solving a puzzle. Game Informer liked it, {{saying that they were}} complicated and showed how Batman analyzes a crime scene. The combat system received mixed reviews. The shock gloves were criticized as overpowered and making fights too easy, allowing Batman unblockable attacks (instantly disabling most opponents) and removing the need for tactics. Reviewers said that changes to combat punished more than challenged; greater enemy numbers and variety made sustaining an attack difficult, and (combined with an array of gadgets which hindered—rather than damaged—enemies) made encounters long and repetitive. Joystiq noted that the game emphasized combat over stealth. Kotaku called the combat rating system distracting screen clutter which broke the player's concentration, but GameFront said that the system was <b>positive</b> <b>reinforcement</b> for successful fights. The stealth sections were considered of similar quality to previous installments; their unchanged function left the methods of obtaining victory the same, making for a rote experience. The Remote Claw was criticized for making stealth sections too easy, allowing multiple enemies to be disabled without moving from the player's starting position.|$|E

25|$|The first {{scientific}} studies identifying neurons that responded {{in ways that}} suggested they encode for conditioned stimuli came from work by Mahlon deLong and by R.T. Richardson. They showed that nucleus basalis neurons, which release acetylcholine broadly throughout the cerebral cortex, are activated shortly after a conditioned stimulus, or after a primary reward if no conditioned stimulus exists. These neurons are equally active for positive and negative reinforcers, and {{have been shown to}} be related to neuroplasticity in many cortical regions. Evidence also exists that dopamine is activated at similar times. There is considerable evidence that dopamine participates in both reinforcement and aversive learning. Dopamine pathways project much more densely onto frontal cortex regions. Cholinergic projections, in contrast, are dense even in the posterior cortical regions like the primary visual cortex. A study of patients with Parkinson's disease, a condition attributed to the insufficient action of dopamine, further illustrates the role of dopamine in <b>positive</b> <b>reinforcement.</b> It showed that while off their medication, patients learned more readily with aversive consequences than with <b>positive</b> <b>reinforcement.</b> Patients who were on their medication showed the opposite to be the case, <b>positive</b> <b>reinforcement</b> proving to be the more effective form of learning when dopamine activity is high.|$|E
