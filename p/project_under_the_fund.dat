The context of the dissertation is embedded in a Teacher Education Goes Into Virtual Schooling (TEGIVS) <b>project</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>Fund</b> for the Improvement of Postsecondary Education (FIPSE), U. S. Department of Education. The first article presented TEGIVS curricula and its preliminary evaluation, the second article discussed the study on preservice teachers 2 ̆ 7 perspectives and preconceptions about VS, and the third article described the development, validation, and implementation of a rubric to assess the preservice teachers 2 ̆ 7 competence as VS facilitators. Both quantitative and qualitative data were collected from preservice teachers and three practitioners in the area of VS. The main findings of the articles indicate that preservice teachers are ready to learn about VS, but hold preconceptions about VS. The most commonly stated preconception was technology is becomes teacher 2 ̆ 7 s surrogate in VS. The TEGIVS curriculum was found helpful in preparing preservice teachers see the complexity of teaching and learning online. Lastly, the competence assessment instrument developed and implemented to assess preservice teachers 2 ̆ 7 competence to facilitate in VS was found to be reliable and valid. Thus, this dissertation provides evidence for the need to integrate VS into teacher education, and further suggests that teacher education should identify and correct preservice teachers 2 ̆ 7 preconceptions about VS. The competence assessment instrument that included a scenario and rubric was developed as part of this dissertation and has not been implemented outside the TEGIVS project. Teacher education programs can also use this very first competence assessment instrument to assess VS facilitator competence of preservice teachers in the three aspects of technology, mentoring, and collaboration...|$|E

40|$|The shadow wage is {{the social}} {{opportunity}} cost of labor. After reviewing earlier theoretical and empirical literature, we define four labor market conditions: fairly socially efficient (FSE), quasi-Keynesian unemployment (QKU), urban labor dualism (ULD) and rural labor dualism (RLD). We offer, {{for the first time}} to date, an empirical estimation of the shadow wages for the EU at regional (NUTS 2) level. Our estimated values are in the form of conversion factors that translate actual observed real wages into shadow wages, as required by social cost-benefit analysis of investment <b>projects</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> Structural <b>Funds</b> of <b>the</b> EU. Our results are obtained with an empirical strategy that is easy to implement with aggregate data, differently from micro-data based approaches that are costly, project specific, and often difficult to be applied because of lack of data. We find that the conversion factor for the shadow wage rate is 0. 998 in 29 FSE regions (mostly capital cities); 0. 943 in 135 ULD regions (mostly in rich areas); 0. 8005 in 74 QKU regions, and just 0. 519 in 32 RLD regions. These findings point to high variability of labor markets in the EU and have important applications for project evaluation. Shadow wage, project evaluation, EU regions,...|$|R

2500|$|Additionally, certain {{organizations}} {{are looking into}} biomass briquette substitution {{in order to reduce}} the demand for fuelwood. Sustainable fuelwood production techniques are also being implemented. <b>The</b> Eco-Makala <b>project</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> World Wildlife <b>Fund</b> (WWF) has pledged to reforest 4500 ha by 2012 to provide the people of Goma with fuelwood. In the project, the trees are planted on soil belonging to local farmers, with the farmer's permission. The farmer hence becomes owner of the trees, and is able to make his own charcoal from these using a clamp. This amount of wood being planted to offset fuelwood collection is minimal when considering that over 300,000 ha of forest are destroyed each year alone. [...] The REDD campaign is aimed at addressing climate change as all of it projects are working towards an overall world reduction in its emissions by approximately 17 Gt CO2e by 2020 in order to arrive at the GHG atmospheric concentration target of 445 parts per million (pm) of CO2e.|$|R
40|$|High {{voltage cable}} {{requires}} a good insulating material such as {{low density polyethylene}} (LDPE) {{to be able to}} operate efficiently in high voltage stresses and high temperature environment. However, any polymeric material will experience degradation after prolonged application of high electrical stresses or other extreme conditions. The continuous degradation will shorten the life of a cable therefore further understanding on the behaviour of the aged high voltage cable needs to be undertaken. This may be observed through electroluminescence (EL) measurement. EL occurs when a solid-state material is subjected to a high electrical field stress and associated with the generation of charge carriers within the polymeric material and that these charges can be produced by injection, de-trapping and field-dissociation at the metal-polymer interface. The behaviour of EL emission can be affected by applied field, applied frequency, ageing time, ageing temperature and types of materials, among others. This paper focuses on the measurement of EL emission of additive-free LDPE thermally aged at different temperature subjected to varying electric stresses at 50 Hz. It can be observed that EL emission increases as voltage applied is increased. However, EL emission decreases as ageing temperature is increased for varying applied voltage.

40|$|In {{this article}} {{issues will be}} {{explored}} associated with emerging trends in UK higher education curricular policy which embody an explicit work orientation. In the HEINE project (a research <b>project</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> TSER initiative <b>funded</b> by <b>the</b> EU) we came across several examples of curricular change or trend which were introduced {{on the basis of}} a perceived need for students to rehearse, in an explicit way, the employment practices they were likely to enter. These justifications have embedded within them a theory which identifies what ought to be Higher Education/Work Relations (HEWR for short). In effect these are prescriptive theories. There are also ideographic or descriptive theories which attempt an articulation of the nature of HEWR. We have termed this theory as a form of neo-correspondence. Clearly, there is often a strong connection between them in that descriptive theories underpin ideas about what ought to be. The article refers to the broad area of policy interventions which focus on regular teaching and learning in the higher education context...|$|R
40|$|Scope of this Work The {{purpose of}} this work is to {{undertake}} a comprehensive investigation of the impact, and current use, of the Phase 4 <b>projects</b> commissioned <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>Fund</b> for <b>the</b> Development of Teaching and Learning (hereafter FDTL 4) on {{the teaching and learning}} of Mathematics and Statistics across the HE community. The methodology used within this investigation focuses upon the potential for long-term impact {{and the use of the}} outputs from each project to lead to a change in practice at the departmental level. Consideration is also given to their direct impact upon the student learning experience. This investigation focussed upon the following four research questions: 1. To what extent have the outcomes from the FDTL 4 projects influenced practice within their host departments? 2. To what extent has practice been influenced within partner institutions? 3. How have the outcomes from the FDTL 4 projects influenced the Maths, Stats & OR Community as a whole? 4. How have the outcomes from the FDTL 4 projects impacted directly upon the student learning experience within the Maths, Stats & OR Community? It should be noted that this work is not an evaluation of each project (indeed such work has already been undertaken by the individual project teams themselves), but an evaluation of the impact of <b>the</b> FDTL 4 <b>funding</b> stream made available in October 2002. As such, although past tense may be used when referring to the individual projects, this is simply to recognise that <b>the</b> initial <b>funding</b> made available to each project finished in September 2005.

40|$|The {{statement}} that "Social Economy" {{is the master}} key that opens the EU "Fund Box" constitutes the {{point of departure for}} the assessment of the impact of <b>the</b> EU <b>funds</b> on <b>the</b> expansion SEEs in Poland. It is quite often that Social Economy is treated almost like very well-known fairy tales entreat: "Open Sesame". The term Social Economy is very capacious. The use of this term allows to peruse a broad spectrum of <b>projects</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> EU <b>funding.</b> <b>The</b> leading program <b>under</b> which <b>the</b> EU <b>Funds</b> are dispersed <b>under</b> <b>the</b> umbrella of Social Economy is the "Human Capital Project". Considerable amount of funds was made available within the framework of this Project was made available to so institutions working in sup-port of the Social Economy with the aim to promote and enhance knowledge and skills needed to engage in and carry out activities as SEE. An excess of 712 million PLN was earmarked for the realization of these goals. The results of this to date are unsatisfactory. Despite that, more than 100 thousand persons interested in Social Economy went through training only 85 SEEs were created in the whole of Poland. “Self-sustainability” or in other words, the ability to sustain own economic activities independent of <b>the</b> EU <b>Funds,</b> is key to the success of SEEs. As a result of the participation in <b>the</b> EU <b>funded</b> projects SEEs improved their ﬁnancial capacity, {{but at the same time}} became grew dependent on the assistance of public ﬁnanc-ing. Tis is exempliﬁed by the fact that income derived from their own activities constitutes only 45, 6 percent of the entire income as compared to 72, 8 percent of income derived from own economic activities by entities that do not participate in <b>the</b> EU <b>funded</b> <b>projects.</b> Availability of <b>funds</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> “Human Capital” <b>project</b> results in the fact that income derived from the sale of goods and services account for only 43. 1 percent of the total income while for the non-participants that income accounts for 58, 9 percent. What’s also interesting the SEEs that receive ﬁnancial support are not interested in undertaking business challenges and risks such a applying for bank loans. Figures show that credit constitutes only 0, 6 percent of their total income while, for the non-participants, it accounts for 1, 7 percent of their total incom...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the impact on}} Ghana ofthe fiscal decentralisation policy introduced {{by the government of}} President J. J. Rawlings by examining in detail its impact on a peripheral, but large district covered by Tamale Municipal Assembly (TMA). In Ghana the substantive mechanism used to effect fiscal decentralisation is the District Assemblies Common Fund (DACF) through which, since 1996, five per cent of national income has been transferred to the country's District Assemblies for development at the local level. Four aspects of the DACF are considered, namely management and operation ofthe DACF, the implementation of development <b>projects</b> <b>under</b> DACF <b>funding,</b> <b>the</b> DACF's impact on local economic development, and the impact of decentralisation policy in Ghana on the functioning of the TMA.. This thesis finds that the amount ofDACF revenue used for capital investment was very limited. Inadequate <b>funds</b> for <b>the</b> DACF made available by central government is further limited by how ministries, other organisations and local MPs seek a share of DACF monies. Fiscal decentralisation has brought some, ifvery limited, development to a few communities only. Any local development has been uneven and without a strategic direction set by the District Assembly. Much of <b>the</b> DACF <b>funds</b> continue to be allocated along patronage lines. The district assembly's decentralised planning system maintains (and may even reinforce) the power of the existing local power structure. Decision-making power remains embedded in the District Assembly and there has been no effective consultation with ordinary citizens. In some cases local elites deliberately block the involvement ofthe wider populace. <b>The</b> Poverty Alleviation <b>Fund</b> is <b>the</b> microcredit programme of the DACF, which aims to boost economic development and poverty alleviation at the district level. It was found that its impact on the local economy is very limited. The design of the PAF lacks devices to establish sustainability and effectiveness in economic development and/or poverty alleviation. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
