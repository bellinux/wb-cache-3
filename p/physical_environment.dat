Art designers spent seven days in Hong Kong, where they studied the city's environment, and took more than 20,000 photos as references for the <b>physical</b> <b>environment</b> in the game. They travelled on foot to various locales, such as clubs and malls, and interviewed ex-Triad members and retired members of the Hong Kong Police Force Anti-Triad unit, which inspired narratives and character design. The sound designers spent ten days in the city overseeing the dialogue sessions on weekdays and capturing ambient noises around the city at weekends.|$|E

40|$|This essay aims {{to examine}} how safety is {{reflected}} in local plans. This was done by describing the <b>physical</b> <b>environments,</b> which are addressed in the local plans {{and its impact on}} safety. It has also been undertaken to see if certain <b>physical</b> <b>environments</b> with respect to safety have been addressed differently. The paper is made with the qualitative method Thematic analysis. The method is used to analyze the three local plans that have been available during the essay. The analysis was done with my created themes Traffic separation, Accessibility, High vision, Light and bright and Human presence. The results have shown that the local plans takes up <b>physical</b> <b>environments</b> that are good for safety. It is also so that the results showed that the local plans and safe <b>physical</b> <b>environments</b> differ depending of the intent of each local plan...|$|R

5|$|By January 1974, a {{joint working}} party {{representing}} Greater Manchester had drawn up its county Structure Plan, ready for implementation by the Greater Manchester County Council. The plan set out objectives for the forthcoming metropolitan county. The highest priority was {{to increase the}} quality of life for its inhabitants by improving the county's <b>physical</b> <b>environment</b> and cultural facilities which had suffered following deindustrialisation—much of Greater Manchester's basic infrastructure dated from its 19th-century growth, and was unsuited to modern lifestyles. Other objectives were to reverse the trend of depopulation in central-Greater Manchester, to invest in country parks to improve the region's poor reputation on leisure facilities, and to improve the county's transport infrastructure and patterns.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} is outdoor learning. Program leaders believe that the outdoors environment provides a context for learning that is physically demanding and entirely different from that experienced every day at home and in school. The outdoors stimulates new ways of thinking and approaching both task- and group-related problems. As participants learn they can exceed what they perceive to be their physical limits, they find their mental capacity also grows. White Stag uses the <b>physical</b> <b>environment</b> to tire the individual and open their minds to new ways of thinking. The program does nothing indoors that can be done outdoors, and encourages physical fitness through outdoor activities. Using the outdoors avoids the negative association of a standard classroom environment.|$|E
5|$|Wade {{asserts that}} there is a clear {{continuity}} from the earlier apes of five million years ago to the anatomically modern humans who diverged from them, citing the genetic and social similarities between humans and chimpanzees. He attributes the divergence of the two species from a common ancestor to a change in their ecological niche; the ancestors of chimpanzees remained in the forests of equatorial Africa, whereas the ancestors of humans moved to open woodland and were exposed to different evolutionary pressures. Although Wade posits that much of human evolution {{can be attributed to the}} <b>physical</b> <b>environment,</b> he also believes that one of the major forces shaping evolution has been the nature of human society itself.|$|E

5|$|While {{investments}} in consumer goods were below projections, the expansion in output increased the Soviet people's standard of living. Refrigerators, owned by only 32 {{percent of the}} population in the early 1970s, had reached 86% of households by the late 1980s, and the ownership of color televisions increased from 51% in the early 1970s to 74% in the 1980s. On the other hand, though some areas improved during the Brezhnev era, the majority of civilian services deteriorated, with the <b>physical</b> <b>environment</b> for the common Soviet citizen falling apart rapidly. Diseases were on the rise because of the decaying health care system, and living space remained rather small by First World standards, with the common Soviet person living in 13.4 square metres. At the same time thousands of Moscow inhabitants were homeless, most of them living in shacks, doorways and parked trams. Authorities often conducted sweeps of movie theaters, restaurants, and saunas to locate people slacking off from work, particularly during major events like the 1980 Summer Olympics that attracted large numbers of foreign visitors. Nutrition ceased to improve in the late 1970s, with rationing of staple food products returning to locales such as Sverdlovsk. Environmental damage and pollution became a growing problem due to the Soviet government's policy of development at all costs, and {{some parts of the country}} such as the Kazakh SSR suffered particularly badly due to being used as a testing ground for nuclear weapons. While Soviet citizens in 1962 had enjoyed higher average life expectancy than the United States, by 1982 it had fallen by nearly five years.|$|E

40|$|The {{emergence}} of virtual environments, {{in the early}} form of social networks, and recent, more elaborate incarnations such as Second Life and the Global Information Grid (GIG), create opportunities for new means of collaborating that negate the typical constraints of <b>physical</b> <b>environments.</b> Combined with previous work demonstrating the semi-automated formation of collaborative teams, this represents a powerful advance in information exchange and collaboration capability. However, the inherent differences between traditional <b>physical</b> <b>environments</b> and these new virtual environments require that old methods of evaluation, acquisition, and integration of resources into collaborations be updated. We introduce a scenario and a prototype implementation to illustrate the different opportunities and challenges of finding resources for use by virtual collaborations, and suggest directions for modifying the strategies used in the <b>physical</b> <b>environments</b> to be better suited for use in virtual environments. ...|$|R
