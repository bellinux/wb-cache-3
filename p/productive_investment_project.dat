This paper brings together historical analysis and theories of organization development to reveal that the Bank was unwilling to lend for housing programs not because these were not sound, but because they were geared toward achieving social welfare objectives and were not directly linked to <b>productive</b> <b>investment</b> <b>projects,</b> such as dams, power stations, and railroads.

40|$|Banks are {{important}} for mobilizing savings and then channeling those funds to <b>productive</b> <b>investment</b> <b>projects.</b> While providing these and other services that contribute to economic growth and development, banks take on various types of risks {{with the expectation that}} the return they receive will compensate for the risks. This paper presents a simple model and tests the extent to which information asymmetry between bank owners and depositors induces risk-shifting behavior that allows for higher bank net interest margins. The empirical results support the hypothesis that the greater the degree of information asymmetry the higher net interest margins base upon a sample of 3, 115 banks in 98 countries.

40|$|Corruption {{is closely}} related to {{economic}} growth. This paper consid-ers the prospects for constructing a model of growth in an economy with bureaucrats who collect bribe from entrepreneurs to pursue their bribe income maximization. The bureaucrats have an ability to set their ef-fort level on receiving <b>investment</b> <b>projects,</b> and entrepreneurs must pay a bribe to operate their <b>investment</b> <b>project</b> if the bureaucrats observe them. Under progressive bribe rates along with project's profitability, corrup-tion can make entrepreneurs choose less <b>productive</b> <b>investment</b> <b>projects</b> to avoid high bribe rate, defined as a reversion of profitability. This rever-sion is possible to lead an economy to be captured in a corruption trap, where its unique steady states depends on its initial conditions, or a cor-ruption collapse, in which a high steady state fails to exist and only a lower steady state survives. A major implication of the analysis is that corrup-tion can explain part of income disparity among developed countries and poor corrupt countries. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{argues that}} output {{volatility}} {{depends on the}} degree of credit market imperfection. In the early stages of financial development, agents are constrained in their borrowing ability. As a result, the individual savings, affected by the labor supply, play a dual role in the economy, having repercussions on the interest rate. On the one hand, high savings imply high investment, low marginal product of capital and thus low interest rate. On the other hand, high savings affect the agents' ability to run highly <b>productive</b> <b>investment</b> <b>projects,</b> which increases the interest rate. When the former effect is dominant, a dynamic complementarity between individual and aggregate labor supply arises. This leads to a local and global indeterminacy of equilibrium paths. If the borrowing constraint is relaxed, the complementarity between individual and aggregate labor supply decisions weakens, equilibrium becomes globally unique and the possibility of having aggregate fluctuations in output disappears...|$|R
40|$|In this Paper, {{we examine}} bank lending {{decisions}} {{in an economy}} with spillover effects {{in the creation of}} new investment opportunities and asymmetric information in credit markets. We show that such features may lead to strategic considerations in the loan extension decision and in the pricing of loan contracts. We consider both lending and under-lending equilibria when the interest rate is exogenously given to banks. We show the existence of an asymmetric under-lending equilibrium in which <b>productive</b> <b>investment</b> <b>projects</b> do not get financed even if banks have adequate lending capacity. We also examine price-setting equilibria in which banks compete over interest rates charged to firms. We show that there exist price-setting equilibria in which all projects get financed if ex-post feasible. There also exists, however, an under-lending equilibrium in which when one bank does set a lower interest rate to capture a larger market, it may simultaneously reduce its lending. Our results suggest that volatility and unpredictability in bank lending capacities may be a key indicator of various adverse outcomes in our model. bank lending; interest rate competition; self-fulfilling beliefs; spillover effects; under-lending equilibria...|$|R
40|$|Until {{the late}} 1960 s, the World Bank {{presented}} {{itself as an}} institution devoted to making sound and directly productive project loans. Yet, during its early years, discussions took place within the Bank regarding the possibility of issuing different types of loans, namely (i) loans aimed at tackling social issues ('social loans'), and (ii) loans aimed at providing foreign currency to address disequilibria {{in the balance of}} payments ('impact loans'). This paper brings together historical analysis and theories of organization development to study the housing issue as a case in point. The analysis reveals that the Bank was unwilling to lend for housing programmes not because these were not sound - in fact, they were - but because they were geared toward achieving social welfare objectives and were not directly linked to <b>productive</b> <b>investment</b> <b>projects,</b> such as dams, power stations, and railroads. This early decision {{had a significant impact on}} the subsequent development of the Bank's view of policy-making: it locked the institution into a particular lending pattern, and deprived it of important intellectual resources. It was not until the late 1960 s that the Bank began to take social issues into consideration, rather late compared with other multilateral institutions. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{main problem}} of {{underdeveloped}} countries consists in an inflexible productive structure {{which makes it}} difficult to adopt to changes in world markets. There are three important instruments to improve their flexibility. The first instrument are the investments - not investments in general (this is only of interest in the context of stabilization policies) but specific <b>investment</b> <b>projects</b> or programs. The author distinguishes directly and indirectly <b>productive</b> <b>investments,</b> which require separate investment criteria. For the latter especially the fact ought to be taken account of that they cause large future current expenditures, therefore absorbe future resources ahead of creating them. The second instrument is the budget. In underdeveloped countries its task is not only to finance the public services but also to accumulate savings. It becomes the link between the public and the private sectors as well as between directly and indirectly <b>productive</b> <b>investments,</b> and, by this, the main instrument for development. The third instrument is the balance of payment policy: avoidance of balance of payment crises and efficient use of export receipt. Its further tasks consist in creating public savings—a task that is very often underestimated compared to the infant industry argument or the directing of import and export. In the last part the author scrutinizes a special problem of planning a specific investment project: shadow or accounting prices (wages, interest rates, exchange rate). The theory implies that all <b>investments</b> are directly <b>productive,</b> which ist too simple. When shadow prices are adopted, the budgetary consequences are neglected. E. g. a project is chosen on grounds of low shadow wages, nevertheless market wages have to be paid. The difference is a charge on the budget. The possibilities of <b>productive</b> <b>investment</b> are reduced, the composition of directly and indirectly <b>productive</b> <b>investments</b> altered in favour of the latter, and economic growth diminished. The author therefore concludes that the adoption of shadow prices calculated from a static system might prove disastrous to future growth. The solution would consist in realizingall <b>investment</b> <b>projects</b> the rate of return of which would exceed the interest rate of, say, the World Bank (more or less opportunity cost of capital), and limiting <b>investment</b> in indirectly <b>productive</b> activities to what the budget can stand, in particular to an amount that does not foreclose future savings...|$|R
40|$|I study a {{model of}} {{entrepreneurial}} investment in which <b>investment</b> <b>projects</b> are heterogeneous {{with respect to their}} exposure to an aggregate liquidity shock. A firm that is affected by the shock will mitigate its exposure by purchasing claims issued by a firm that is not. Liabilities of the unaffected firm may earn a liquidity premium due to their fungibility; and, because they are backed by <b>productive</b> <b>investment,</b> their supply is elastic to the demand. The segmentation implies that an aggregate liquidity shock has different consequences across sectors. The unaffected firm plays a role like that of a bank by supplying liquidity to other firms; this mechanism recalls the “real bills” doctrine of classical monetary theory.

This indicator measures adjustments to <b>investment</b> <b>projects</b> throughout the year, based on short-term economic changes. Being closely correlated to quarterly changes in corporate investment, it is available around three months before the publication of the initial quarterly national accounts figures. The distributions examined do not verify certain characteristics of normal distribution. Therefore, it is necessary to apply an estimation method which is robust to the revisions of outliers.

In this paper, we {{analyze the}} use of fiscal and {{monetary}} instruments to improve long-run welfare when <b>productive</b> <b>investment</b> is irreversible and uncollat-eralizable {{and there is no}} insurance.

When lump-sum subsidies are high, a consumption tax is likely to be more redistributive and thus more consumption smoothing than are the other sets of instruments analyzed in our model...|$|R

40|$|Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) {{consists}} of the obligation of the business society to pay attention on problems external to them, public problems, such as combating poverty and social inequity, reduction of spatial inequalities of income and wealth, through instruments and actions aimed especially at the “underprivileged society”, within their sphere of influence, following rules of Human Rights and environmental protection. In the exercise of their activities and performance of their social obligations, Corporations keep close connection with States. In this relation with governments, corruption, in its many ways, may hamper the operational process, raising the cost of <b>productive</b> <b>investment</b> and social <b>projects,</b> making it even impossible to develop them. In this scenario, businesses have to fight corruption to make possible the exercise of their social obligations.

40|$|The {{call for}} an {{across-the-board}} cut in {{the capital gains tax}} rate has won growing bipartisan support. Advocates claim that a tax cut would spur new <b>investment,</b> reward <b>productive</b> enterprise, serve as a simple proxy for inflation indexing, 1 and generate additional tax revenue from the consequent increases in asset turnover and productivity. Opponents contend {{a capital gains tax cut}} would disproportionately benefit the wealthiest taxpayers, that <b>productive</b> <b>investment</b> is relatively insensitive to capital gains tax rates, 2 and that any boost to asset turnover would be merely temporary. However, such debate ignores the fact that a large and growing share of capital gains tax revenues, perhaps as large as two-thirds of such receipts, are generated in the real estate sector, a sector that has little discernible impact on <b>productive</b> <b>investment</b> or employment. Moreover, the recent stock market rise has enlarged the number of taxpayers who now stand to gain from a capital gains tax cut [...] even as it further weakens the rationale that a cut is required to stimulate economic growth.
