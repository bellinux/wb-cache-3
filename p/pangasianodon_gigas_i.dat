50|$|No other {{river is}} home to so many species of very large fish. The biggest include three species of Probarbus babs, which can grow up to 1.5 m and weigh 70 kg, the giant {{freshwater}} stingray (Himantura polylepis, syn. H. chaophraya), which can reach at least 5 m in length and 1.9 m in width, the giant pangasius (Pangasius sanitwongsei), giant barb (Catlocarpio siamensis) and the endemic Mekong giant catfish (<b>Pangasianodon</b> <b>gigas).</b> The last three can grow up to about 3 m in length and weigh 300 kg. All of these have declined drastically because of dams, flood control, and overfishing.|$|R
50|$|According to International Rivers, the dam's {{construction}} {{would cause}} around 2,100 {{people to be}} resettled, and more than 202,000 {{people living in the}} dam's area would experience impacts due to the loss of agricultural land and riverbank gardens, bring an end to gold panning in the river, and provide less access to the forest resources of the Luang Prabang Range. The Xayaburi dam would also {{have a significant effect on}} the biodiversity of the river ecosystem, and the fisheries within the larger Mekong River basin. According to a World Wildlife Fund (WWF) report, the Xayaburi dam would drive the already critically endangered Mekong giant catfish (<b>Pangasianodon</b> <b>gigas)</b> to extinction.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{horizontal}} and vertical movements of eight immature hatchery-reared Mekong giant catfish <b>Pangasianodon</b> <b>gigas</b> were monitored using acoustic telemetry in Mae Peum Reservoir, Thailand between 2003 and 2004. The fish were monitored for between eight days and more than 9 months. All of the fish moved over the entire reservoir within approximately 40 days after release. Subsequently, the home range became small approximately 40 days after release. The fish preferred deep areas in the reservoir. The fish displayed diel {{horizontal and}} vertical movement patterns. The fish showed larger-scale horizontal movement during the daytime than at night. The fish repeatedly showed active vertical movement during the day, whilst there was little variation in swimming depth at night. Our results imply that the vertical movements of the fish {{were related to the}} environmental condition of the reservoir...|$|R
40|$|For {{conservation}} and successful stock enhancement of endangered species, {{an understanding of}} the movement patterns and behavior of the target species is indispensable. The Mekong giant catfish, <b>Pangasianodon</b> <b>gigas,</b> is endemic to the Mekong Basin and now is threatened with extinction. Although biotelemetry using acoustic transmitters and receivers is expected to reveal its movement patterns and behavior, the most suitable attachment method for the transmitter to the catfish is unknown. In this study we examined the effects of external attachment and surgical implantation on the survival and growth of the catfish, compared with those in control individuals, in an earthen fish pond for approximately 2 months. No fish died during the experimental period. Furthermore, we found no fungal infections in any fish and no significant differences in growth rate among treatment and control fish. However, all transmitters of externally tagged fish were lost during the experimental period. In contrast, transmitters of some surgically implanted fish remained in the peritoneal cavity. In conclusion, the surgical implantation technique is suitable for long-term monitoring of the catfish...|$|R

The fish spent more than 99 % of its time at less than 3 m below the surface. The maximum swimming depth was 5. 6 m. No sharp thermocline was present during the experiment. Temperature did not have any detectable effect on the pattern of vertical movement of the fish. The dissolved oxygen concentration (DO) was stratified, with a concentration of > 60 % saturation in the first 3 m below the surface falling to 10 % saturation at depths lower than 4 m. This specific DO stratification was found to limit the vertical movement of the catfish...|$|R
40|$|Non-commercial cooked Whiteleg shrimp (Penaeus vannamei) was valorized by {{application}} of protein hydrolysis treatments with different proteases (Giant catfish (<b>Pangasianodon</b> <b>gigas)</b> viscera proteases, commercial trypsin, and Alcalase®) for the obtainment of functional components (protein hydrolysates and carotenoids). Functional properties and in vitro inhibitory {{effect of the}} resulting protein hydrolysates on Dipeptidyl Peptidase-IV (DPP-IV) and Prolyloligopeptidase (PO) were evaluated. After hydrolysis, more than 73 % of protein was recovered in soluble form, whereas 11 - 15 % was insoluble. Carotenoids, determined as astaxanthin, were mainly present (> 97 %) in the insoluble protein fraction, presumably in form of complexes of high molecular weight. Protein hydrolysates showed excellent solubility (> 97 %) in a wide pH range (3 - 10), good oil holding capacity (0. 86 - 1. 83 g oil/g hydrolysates) and discrete inter-facial properties. Besides, all shrimp hydrolysates at concentration of 1 mg/mL provided DPP-IV inhibition activity (22. 7 - 61. 7 %) and those prepared with trypsin and Alcalase® also inhibited PO (35 - 40 % inhibition). The enzymatic processing of non-commercial boiled shrimp could be a useful way to valorize it, obtaining soluble proteins/peptides, potential hypoglycemic and antidepressant compounds (DPP-IV and PO inhibition peptides) and astaxanthin with interesting functional properties for food applications.

40|$|Spirulina {{has been}} commercially {{cultivated}} {{because of its}} high nutritional content. It {{can be considered a}} nutritional supplement for humans with various health benefits, and a feed supplement for animals having economic benefits. In aquaculture, Spirulina has been used to improve the immune system and increase the survival rate in juvenile commercial fish, as well as to increase their flesh pigment. From these applications, Spirulina could be used to replace high protein feed ingredient such as fishmeal and soybean meal to save the costs of feed. The M ekong Giant Catfish (Pla Buk), <b>Pangasianodon</b> <b>gigas</b> Chevey, {{is one of the largest}} species of freshwater catfish in the world. This fish is an endemic species in the Mekong River and its branches. At present, Thailand could culture this fish on a commercial scale. This study was conducted to investigate replacing fishmeal with Spirulina, at 0, 15, 30 and 100 %, and to evaluate growth, feed utilization and pigment in flesh of fish. The results showed that the proximate composition of the various feeds (4 formulas) had similar nutritional value. Average daily gain, specific growth rate and feed conversion rate were not significantly different. However total biomass increase of fish fed with Spirulina 0 % was significantly lower than fish fed with Spirulina 15, 30 and 100 % (p< 0. 05). The standard length of the fish and weight in terms of flesh, gut and stomach were not significantly different. As well, flesh pigment and carotenoids were not significantly different...|$|R
40|$|Catfishes of {{the family}} Pangasiidae are an {{important}} group that contributes significantly to the fisheries of the Mekong River basin. In recent times the populations of several catfish species have declined, thought {{to be due to}} overfishing and habitat changes brought about by anthropogenic influences. The Mekong giant catfish <b>Pangasianodon</b> <b>gigas</b> Chevey, 1913 is listed as Critically Endangered on the IUCN Red List. In the present study, we assessed the level of genetic diversity of nine catfish species using sequences of the large subunit of mitochondrial DNA (16 S rRNA). Approximately 570 base pairs (bp) were sequenced from 672 individuals of nine species. In all species studied, haplotype diversity and nucleotide diversity ranged from 0. 118 ± 0. 101 to 0. 667 ± 0. 141 and from 0. 0002 ± 0. 0003 to 0. 0016 ± 0. 0013, respectively. Four haplotypes were detected among 16 samples from natural populations of the critically endangered Mekong giant catfish. The results, in spite of the limited sample size for some species investigated, indicated that the level of genetic variation observed in wild populations of the Mekong giant catfish (haplotype diversity= 0. 350 ± 0. 148, nucleotide diversity= 0. 0009 ± 0. 0008) is commensurate with that of some other related species. This finding indicates that (1) wild populations of the Mekong giant catfish might be more robust than currently thought or (2) present wild populations of this species carry a genetic signature of the historically larger population(s). Findings from this study also have important implications for conservation of the Mekong giant catfish, especially in designing and implementing artificial breeding programme for restocking purposes. </div...|$|R

We collected water samples from six deep pools on the Mekong, identified through Local Ecological Knowledge, in Cambodia, Lao PDR, and Thailand. DNA was extracted and amplified from these samples using the designed primers and probes. Mekong giant catfish DNA was detected from one sample from the species’ presumed spawning grounds on the Mekong mainstream, near the border between northern Thailand and Lao PDR. eDNA sampling using species-specific primers has potential for surveying and monitoring poorly known species from complex tropical aquatic environments.

40|$|Abstract: Fish {{passage in}} an era of broken rivers: new {{approaches}} a reason for hope? In an era of decline of large-bodied, migratory fishes, river connectivity {{has been shown to be}} increasingly important for the conservation of native biodiversity. From North America to Asia, Europe to South America, issues with river connectivity influence – for better or worse - the life cycle, and population status, of migratory fishes. In the Mekong River Basin, the world’s largest fishes, including the Critically Endangered Mekong giant catfish <b>Pangasianodon</b> <b>gigas</b> and giant pangasius Pangasius sanitwongsei, face extinction because of mainstream dams on the lower Mekong. In China, populations of the Chinese sturgeon, Acipenser sinensis, and Chinese paddlefish, Psephurus gladius, have declined significantly since the construction of the Gezhouba and Three Gorges Dams. In North America, connectivity is increasingly recognized as a determining factor in the health of sturgeon and salmon populations in the Columbia and Fraser Rivers; similarly, American paddlefish, Polyodon spathula, and pallid sturgeon, Scaphirhynchus albus, are impacted by dams and habitat fragmentation. The situation is similar in New Zealand, where a combination of factors – from dams to habitat degradation to overfishing – is resulting in unprecedented population decline of species like the longfin eel Anguilla dieffenbachii. Identifying novel fish passage solutions that maximize environmental benefit and minimize cost is the only way to provide for needs of a rapidly growing human population while also protecting imperiled aquatic fauna. Fish passage broadly interpreted includes a wide range of solutions to increase connectivity and restore fish migrations and populations. New methods of study, technologies, decisions about dam placement and dam removal all offer potential for restoring threatened fish. On a policy level, the Convention on Migratory Species provides a framework for management of transboundary migratory freshwater fish – a neglected biota in urgent need of study and protection...|$|R

The fish were reared in net cages for 5 months (October, 2013 -March, 2014). The results showed that, Weight Gain (WG) and average daily weight gain (ADG) were the highest among the P. gigas (34. 45 and 0. 20, respectively). The Length Gain (LG), average daily length gain (ADL) and Specific Growth Rate (SGR) were highest among the RCBC (10. 66, 0. 062 and 2. 34, respectively). While the survival rate (55 %) was highest among the BC. The Feed Conversion Rate (FCR) showed high numbers in all fish except the hybrids. On the other hand, the hybrid species showed lower results in all growth indices except for the survival rate but which had as high a tendency as the RCBC. The LWR revealed “b” values for the P. gigas, RCBC, BC and F 1 hybrid that were 2. 94, 3. 12, 2. 67 and 2. 03 indicating that P. gigas and RCBC displayed isometric growth while others showed allometric growth.

50|$|In 1993, Pangasius {{was one of}} two extant genera (along with Helicophagus) in {{the family}} Pangasiidae. At this point, it was split into four subgenera. Pangasius (<b>Pangasianodon)</b> {{included}} P. <b>gigas</b> and P. hypophthalmus and was diagnosed by the absence of mandibular barbels, the absence of teeth in adults and the presence of a single-lobed swimbladder. Pangasius (Pteropangasius) included P. micronema and P. pleurotaenia and was diagnosed by four lobes in the swimbladder and with multiple segments in the last lobe. Pangasius (Neopangasius) included P. nieuwenhuisii, P. humeralis, P. lithostoma, P. kinabatanganensis, diagnosed by palatal teeth arranged in a single large patch and high vertebral counts. Pangasius (Pangasius) was the final subgenus and had no diagnostic features, containing the remaining species. These subgeneric classifications were confirmed in 2000 except for Neopangasius, found to be polyphyletic and to be part of Pangasius (Pangasius), thus leaving three subgenera.|$|R

This required the Cys βCH resonances of the oxidised protein to be sequence-specifically and stereo-specifically assigned, and this was accomplished by a combination of TOCSY and NOE measurements, allied to model building based on X-ray structures of related ferredoxins. An analysis of the estimated hyperfine shifts of the Cys βCH resonances with a Karplus-type equation relating the shifts to iron-sulfur-β carbon-/ 3 proton dihedral angles, taken together with the relative relaxation rates of the two βCH 2 resonances, estimated from their linewidths, then allowed the ironsulfur-/ 3 -carbon-α-carbon dihedral angles to be determined. A novel representation of the NMR data is presented which shows that the cluster dihedral angles are uniquely determined by the NMR data. The analysis reveals that the dihedral angles for D. africanus ferredoxin I are similar to the corresponding angles of other ferrredoxins even though there are differences in their 1 H NMR spectra. The sequence-specific and stereospecific assignments have been extended by analogy to the related Fe 4 S 4 -containing D. <b>gigas</b> ferredoxin <b>I,</b> and the stereospecific assignments to the Fe 4 S 4 -containing Thermococcus litoralis ferredoxin...|$|R
