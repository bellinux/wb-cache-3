The institution of a <b>patent</b> <b>system</b> in a developing country may confer significant social costs on that country; membership in the international <b>patent</b> <b>system</b> may exacerbate those costs.

40|$|Abstract: The <b>patent</b> <b>system</b> {{is making}} {{progress}} and incorporating international practice at a tremendous pace in China. However, scholars have been raising doubts {{to the benefits}} of the <b>patent</b> <b>system.</b> They believe that the social costs borne by the developing countries for the <b>patent</b> <b>system</b> exceed the overall economic gains in the current international circumstances. China’s current <b>patent</b> <b>system</b> indicates that {{there is a lack of}} sufficient understanding of the social costs and of the cost-benefit analysis of the <b>patent</b> <b>system,</b> which causes many controversies. Nowadays the related study is still struggling to quantify the social cost, while the qualitative analysis is highly disputed. However, an anatomy of the social costs is necessary to take specific cost control measures for the purpose of establishing an economically more efficient <b>patent</b> <b>system</b> suitable under China’s current circumstances...|$|R

Our simple argument is based on two properties of the <b>patent</b> <b>system.</b> First, a <b>patent</b> not only protects against infringement but also against retaliation by former collusion members. Second, a deviator has an equal chance with former collusion members to get a patent on new innovations. We show that if a <b>patent</b> <b>system</b> reduces spillovers, it renders collusion impossible. Moreover, {{it is possible to}} design a <b>patent</b> <b>system</b> that simultaneously increases knowledge spillovers and eliminates collusionPatens, Collusion, Secrecy, Innovation...|$|R
25|$|Vickers {{set up a}} {{partnership}} with the French aircraft manufacturer, Société des Avions Michel Wibault to exploit the <b>patented</b> <b>system</b> of all-metal construction developed by Michel Wibault. This used corrugated light alloy skin panels, and made for easy maintenance and inspection. As part of this partnership, Vickers placed an order with Wibault for a single Wibault 7, re-engined with a Bristol Jupiter VI radial engine, to act as a prototype for potential licensed production. The Wibault 7, and therefore the Vickers licensed copy, were single-engine high-wing parasol monoplanes.|$|E

The Arrow Ecology company has {{developed}} the ArrowBio process a <b>patented</b> <b>system</b> which takes trash directly from collection trucks and separates organic and inorganic materials through gravitational settling, screening, and hydro-mechanical shredding. The system is capable of sorting huge volumes of solid waste, salvaging recyclables, and turning the rest into biogas and rich agricultural compost. The system is used in California, Australia, Greece, Mexico, the United Kingdom and in Israel. For example, an ArrowBio plant that has been operational at the Hiriya landfill site since December 2003 serves the Tel Aviv area, and processes up to 150 tons of garbage a day.|$|E
25|$|Semantic compaction, (Minspeak), conceptually {{described}} as polysemic (multi-meaning) iconic encoding, {{is one of}} the three ways to represent language in Augmentative and alternative communication (AAC). It is a system utilized in AAC devices in which sequences of icons (pictorial symbols) are combined in order to form a word or a phrase. The goal is to increase independent communication in individuals who cannot use speech. Minspeak is the only <b>patented</b> <b>system</b> for Semantic Compaction and is based on multi-meaning icons that code vocabulary in short sequences determined by rule-driven patterns. Minspeak has been used with both children and adults with various disabilities, including cerebral palsy, motor speech disorders, developmental disabilities, autism spectrum disorder, and adult onset disabilities such as Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS).|$|E

40|$|One of the {{underlying}} justifications of the <b>patent</b> <b>system</b> is to encourage dissemination of scientific knowledge and promote innovation. Yet, the <b>patent</b> <b>system</b> is not a green card to innovation. Indeed, given our progress in science and the increasing rate of technological developments {{it is ironic that}} there is arguably a declining rate of innovation. From this perspective, it might be contended that the <b>patent</b> <b>system</b> is not meeting its said objectives. But the <b>patent</b> <b>system</b> should be seen in a wider context. While well-intended, it is far too simplistic to argue that patents are good or bad for innovation, or that they ‘freeze or spur’ innovation. The challenges to the <b>patent</b> <b>system</b> are complex and cannot solely be attributed to its laws. That is, the <b>patent</b> <b>system’s</b> constituting laws do not tell the full story. Often more telling are the institutional frameworks and socio-cultural and economic practices at the pre-patent inventive stage and the post-patent commercialization stage and beyond. And so when attempting to predict future developments, and ultimately, craft solutions, understanding and ensuring that the wider context is effective is paramount...|$|R

We review the main benefits and costs of the <b>patent</b> <b>system,</b> focusing on the role that patents play in providing incentives for innovation, in promoting the dissemination of knowledge, and in helping technology transfer and commercialization of new technology. From a more normative perspective, we address the questions of what the features of an optimal <b>patent</b> <b>system</b> are and whether the <b>patent</b> <b>system</b> is socially desirable. We examine the problem of the optimal length and scope of patent protection, both for the case of a single innovation and for the richer case of cumulative innovations.

The policy mixes that seem to be associated with a strong increase in demand for patents are: i) policies aiming at attracting FDI; ii) low relative costs (or fees); and iii) a relatively low quality of the examination processes. The significant differences in the <b>patent</b> <b>systems</b> of fast developing countries echo the differences observed between the <b>patent</b> <b>systems</b> in Europe, the USA and Japan. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} the English <b>patent</b> <b>system</b> and early railway-related inventive activity, and it is proposed that the <b>patent</b> <b>system</b> influenced the rate and direction of early railway technology. Contrary to the current historiography of the <b>patent</b> <b>system,</b> it is argued that prior to the Patent Law Amendment Act (1852), in the absence of substantive Parliamentary intervention, the judiciary crafted and shaped the principles of patent law which provided certainty and security for patentees. Inventors involved in railway-related technology found great utility in a unique <b>patent</b> <b>system</b> which they used, relied upon, and promoted to their peers. The requirement post- 1733 for a specification to be filed with a patent application, contributed to the origins of what today might be termed knowledge management. The <b>patent</b> <b>system</b> engendered a developing database of technical knowledge that was codified, controlled, circulated and commercially exploited. Profit was a key motive for those who patented railway-related inventions, which often involved high expenditure, of both time and money, and the <b>patent</b> <b>system</b> secured vital monopoly profits. The pecuniary advantage offered by an effective <b>patent</b> <b>system</b> served to incentivise the development and diffusion of early railway technology. This thesis demonstrates the value of industry-specific analysis of the workings of the <b>patent</b> <b>system.</b> The early railways are recognised as a fully cultural artefact, an approach that provides insights into the technological processes and economic development of the early railways, and since nascent railway technology was but one of several emerging, interwoven technologies, the investigation extends beyond the railway proper. These proposals are tested by reference to contemporary evidence relating to the professional engineering enterprises of George and Robert Stephenson, Marc and Isambard Kingdom Brunel and a number of individuals of less renown, whose patented inventive activity met the demands of the emerging railways. ...|$|R
