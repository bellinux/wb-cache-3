50|$|Switching loads (inductive, capacitive, and resistive), such as {{electric}} motors, transformers, heaters, lamps, ballast, power supplies, etc., {{all cause}} electromagnetic interference especially at currents above 2 A. The usual method used for suppressing EMI is by connecting a snubber network, a resistor {{in series with}} a capacitor, across a <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>contacts.</b> While this may offer modest EMI reduction at very low currents, snubbers do not work at currents over 2 A with electromechanical contacts.|$|E

50|$|Four-terminal sensing is {{also known}} as Kelvin sensing, after William Thomson, Lord Kelvin, who invented the Kelvin bridge in 1861 to measure very low {{resistances}} using four-terminal sensing. Each two-wire connection can be called a Kelvin connection. A <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>contacts</b> that is designed to connect a force-and-sense pair to a single terminal or lead simultaneously is called a Kelvin contact. A clip, often a crocodile clip, that connects a force-and-sense pair is called a Kelvin clip.|$|E
5000|$|For a chain {{with two}} binary contacts, three {{arrangements}} are available: parallel, series and crossed. For a chain with n contacts, the topology {{can be described}} by an n by n matrix in which each element illustrates the relation between a <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>contacts</b> and may {{take one of the}} three states, P, S and X.

5000|$|In electronics, {{switches}} {{are classified}} {{according to the}} arrangement of their contacts. A <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>contacts</b> {{is said to be}} [...] "closed" [...] when current can flow from one to the other. When the contacts are separated by an insulating air gap, they are said to be [...] "open", and no current can flow between them at normal voltages.

50|$|While a <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>{{contacts}}</b> is closed, only a {{small part}} of the contacts are in intimate contact due to asperities and low-conductivity films. Because of the constriction of the current to a very small area, the current density frequently becomes so high that it melts a microscopic portion of the contact. During the close-to-open (break) transition, a microscopic molten bridge forms and eventually ruptures asymmetrically, transferring contact material between contacts and increasing the surface roughness. This can also occur during the open-to-close (make) transition due to contact bounce.|$|E

50|$|A {{diaphragm}} or leaf shutter (as {{distinct from}} the simple leaf shutter above) consists {{of a number of}} thin blades which briefly uncover the camera aperture to make the exposure. The blades slide over each other in a way which creates a circular aperture which enlarges as quickly as possible to uncover the whole lens, stays open for the required time, then closes in the same way. The larger the number of blades, the more accurately circular is the aperture. Flash synchronization is easily achieved with a <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>contacts</b> that close when the shutter is fully open.|$|E

The sprags operate to lock the output drive assembly to the casing to prevent rotation thereof in an idle mode of operation.

50|$|The {{reed switch}} (sometimes {{also known as}} Herkon) is an {{electrical}} switch operated by an applied magnetic field. It was invented at Bell Telephone Laboratories in 1936 by W. B. Ellwood. It consists of a <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>contacts</b> on ferromagnetic metal reeds in a hermetically sealed glass envelope. The contacts may be normally open, closing when a magnetic field is present, or normally closed and opening when a magnetic field is applied. The switch may be actuated by a coil, making a reed relay, or by bringing a magnet near to the switch. Once the magnet is {{pulled away from the}} switch, the reed switch will go back to its original position.|$|E
5000|$|Before the 1970s, mercury {{switches}} were popular. Their {{cost was}} more than that of other designs, but they were totally silent in operation. The switch actuator tipped a sealed glass vial connected via flexible leads, causing a drop of liquid metallic mercury to roll {{from one end to the}} other. When it arrived at the contact end, the drop of mercury bridged a <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>contacts</b> to complete the circuit. Many of these switches were also equipped with a neon lamp connected across the contacts, and thus in series with the electrical load. This caused the indicator to glow faintly when the switch was off, as an aid to finding the switch in a dark room.|$|E
50|$|Modular {{connectors}} come in four sizes: 4-, 6-, 8-, and 10-position, where {{a position}} is a location for a contact. Not {{all of the}} positions may have contacts installed. When contacts are omitted, they are typically done so from the outermost <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>contacts</b> inward, such {{that the number of}} contacts is almost always an even number. The insulating plastic bodies of 4P and 6P connectors have different widths, whereas 8P or 10P connectors share an even larger body width. The connector body positions with omitted contacts or contacts unattached to wires are unused for the electrical connection, but ensure that the plug fits correctly. For instance, RJ11 cables often have connectors with six positions and four contacts, to which are attached just two wires.|$|E

50|$|The {{stiffness}} matrix {{depends on the}} contact spring stiffness and the spring location. The {{stiffness matrix}} is for only one <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>contact</b> springs. However, the global stiffness matrix is determined by summing up the stiffness matrices <b>of</b> individual <b>pairs</b> <b>of</b> springs around each element. Consequently, the developed stiffness matrix has total effects from all <b>pairs</b> <b>of</b> springs, according to the stress situation around the element. This technique {{can be used in}} both load and displacement control cases. The 3D stiffness matrix may be deduced similarly.|$|R
50|$|The vacuum {{interrupter}} uses a high vacuum to extinguish the arc between a <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>contacts.</b> As the contacts move apart, the current flows {{through a small}} area. There is {{a sharp increase in}} resistance between the contacts and the temperature at the contact surface increases rapidly until the occurrence of electrode metal evaporation. At the same time, the electric field is very high across the small contact gap. The breakdown of the gap produces a vacuum arc. As the alternating current passes through a zero, and the gap between the fixed and moving contact widens, the conductive plasma produced by the arc moves away from the gap and becomes non-conductive. The current is interrupted, unless the impressed voltage is large enough to break down the wider gap of the open contacts.|$|E
5000|$|The terms {{pole and}} throw {{are also used}} to {{describe}} switch contact variations. The number of [...] "poles" [...] {{is the number of}} electrically separate switches which are controlled by a single physical actuator. For example, a [...] "2-pole" [...] switch has two separate, parallel sets of contacts that open and close in unison via the same mechanism. The number of [...] "throws" [...] is the number of separate wiring path choices other than [...] "open" [...] that the switch can adopt for each pole. A single-throw switch has one <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>contacts</b> that can either be closed or open. A double-throw switch has a contact that can be connected to either of two other contacts, a triple-throw has a contact which can be connected to one of three other contacts, etc.|$|E
50|$|The {{master and}} slave pendulums were linked {{together}} in a feedback loop which kept the slave synchronized with the master. The slave clock had a mechanical escapement using a 15-tooth count wheel which was moved forward each right-hand pendulum swing by a pawl attached to the pendulum. Every 15 oscillations (30 seconds), this released a gravity lever which gave the slave pendulum a push. This simultaneously closed a switch which reset the gravity lever and sent a pulse of current to an electromagnet which released a second gravity lever in the master unit to give the master pendulum a push. The impulse {{was provided by the}} weight of the gravity lever (acting as a remontoire) rolling off a wheel attached to the pendulum, this mechanism ensuring that the pendulum received an identical impulse, at precisely the same part of its stroke, every 30 seconds. The falling gravity lever closed another <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>contacts</b> which reset the lever and provided an electrical pulse back to the slave unit.|$|E

5000|$|Trolleybus wire {{switches}} (called frogs in the UK) {{are used}} where a trolleybus line branches into two or where two lines join. A switch may {{be either in}} a [...] "straight through" [...] or [...] "turnout" [...] position; it normally remains in the [...] "straight through" [...] position unless it has been triggered, and reverts to it {{after a few seconds}} or after the pole shoe passes through and strikes a release lever. (In Boston, the resting or [...] "default" [...] position is the [...] "leftmost" [...] position.) Triggering is typically accomplished by a <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>contacts,</b> one on each wire close to and before the switch assembly, which power a pair of electromagnets, one in each frog with diverging wires.

5000|$|Two {{methods are}} {{employed}} {{to find the}} nodes. [...] One is to use some type of voltage indicator, such as an RF voltmeter or light bulb, attached to a <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>contacts</b> that slide {{up and down the}} wires. [...] When the bulb reaches a node, the voltage between the wires goes to zero, so the bulb goes out. If the indicator has too low an impedance it will disturb the standing wave on the line, so a high impedance indicator must be used; a regular incandescent bulb has too low a resistance. Lecher and early researchers used long thin Geissler tubes, laying the glass tube directly across the line. The high voltage of early transmitters excited a glow discharge in the gas. In modern times small neon bulbs are often used. One problem with using glow discharge bulbs is their high striking voltage makes it difficult to localize the exact voltage minimum. In precision wavemeters an RF voltmeter is used.|$|E
5000|$|An {{electrical}} contact is an electrical circuit component found in electrical switches, relays, connectors and circuit breakers. Each contact {{is a piece}} of electrically conductive material, usually metal. When a <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>contacts</b> touch, they can pass an electrical current with a certain contact resistance, dependent on surface structure, surface chemistry and contact time; when the pair is separated by an insulating gap, then the pair does not pass a current. When the contacts touch, the switch is [...] "closed"; when the contacts are separated, the switch is [...] "open". The gap must be an insulating medium such as air, vacuum, oil, SF6 or other electrically insulating fluid. Contacts may be operated by humans in push-buttons and switches, by mechanical pressure in sensors or machine cams, and electromechanically in relays. The surfaces where contacts touch are usually composed of metals such as silver or gold alloys that have high electrical conductivity, wear resistance, oxidation resistance and other properties. [...] Beyond the contact surface and immediate area, the {{electrical contact}} is usually composed of other metals for mechanical and cost reasons.|$|E
40|$|Friction affects {{several aspects}} {{important}} {{to the design of}} kinematic couplings, but particularly the ability to reach its centered position is fundamental (In this paper, the term kinematic coupling refers to any connection device based on <b>pairs</b> <b>of</b> <b>contacting</b> surfaces that provide six constraints in an ideal sense). It becomes centered when all <b>pairs</b> <b>of</b> <b>contacting</b> surfaces are fully seated even though a small uncertainty may exist about the exact center where potential energy is minimum. For many applications, centering ability is a good indicator for optimizing the coupling design. Typically, the coupling design process has been largely heuristic based on a few guidelines [Slocum, 1992]. Several simple kinematic couplings (for example, a symmetric three-vee coupling) are compared for centering ability using closed-form equations. More general configurations lacking obvious symmetries are difficult to model in this way. A unique kinematic coupling for large interchangeable optics assemblies in the National Ignition Facility motivated the development of a computer program to optimize centering ability. However, space limits the description of the program to the basic algorithm. Currently the program is written in MathcadTM Plus 6 and is available upon request...|$|R

40|$|In this work, an {{analytical}} method {{has been presented}} for calculating the load sharing among the meshing teeth in high contact ratio spur gearing. Assumption for this procedure is that the tooth deflection at each {{of two or three}} <b>pairs</b> <b>of</b> <b>contact</b> is equal in all cases and the sum of normal loads contributed by each of two or three <b>pairs</b> <b>of</b> <b>contact</b> is equal to maximum normal load. Dynamic loads on high contact ratio spur gears are calculated by using {{an analytical}} model based on torsional vibration of gears. Dynamic load variations during a mesh cycle of a tooth are determined. Variable stiffnesses of gear teeth which are required for dynamic load calculations are found by using analytical expressions. Bending, shear, axial compression and Hertzian contact deflections are considered for tooth stiffness calculation. Viscous damping and friction among the mating teeth are also included in this analysis. Contact stresses are calculated by using analytical expressions developed for two elastic bodies held in contact by forces normal to the area <b>of</b> <b>contact</b> and accompanied by tangential frictional force. Contact stress variations during a mesh cycle of a tooth are determined. It is found that the operating speed has a significant influence on the dynamic load acting on the gear tooth. The magnitude and location of maximum dynamic load changes with operating speed...|$|R
