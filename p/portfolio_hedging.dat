40|$|The problem studied {{is that of}} <b>hedging</b> a <b>portfolio</b> {{of options}} in {{discrete}} time where underlying security prices are driven {{by a combination of}} idiosyncratic and systematic risk factors.

30|$|This {{configuration}} {{presents a}} significant challenge for Swiss franc-based investors. The {{long periods of}} very significant under-performance disqualify in our view a policy of systematic hedging of currency risks. Taking into account the additional intermediation, transaction costs associated with <b>portfolio</b> <b>hedging</b> could make a policy of systematic currency hedging prohibitive. Yet {{it is also a}} fact that the periods of sharp CHF appreciation loom large over the overall portfolio performance and they should be avoided if at all possible. All in all, these observations strongly support a policy of selective currency hedging by a long-run Swiss-based investor. This in turn requires a careful analysis of FX relationships so as to be in position to make informed decisions on the timing of the hedging decisions. Here {{is not the place to}} develop an exchange rate forecasting model and we should maintain the presumption that crises are essentially unpredictable. 10 But we can modestly build on the return-towards-the mean property of real exchange rates over the medium to long run.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The use of {{derivatives}} {{can lead}} to higher yields and lower funding costs. In addition, derivatives are indispensable tools for risk management. We analyze the derivative <b>portfolio</b> <b>hedging</b> problems based on value at risk (VaR) and conditional value at risk (CVaR). We show that these derivative portfolio optimization problems are often ill-posed and the resulting optimal portfolios frequently incur large transaction and management costs. In addition, the optimal portfolio may perform poorly under a slight model error. A CVaR optimization model including a proportional cost is proposed to produce optimal portfolios with fewer instruments and smaller transaction cost with similar expected returns and a small compromise in risk. In addition, we illustrate the importance of sensitivity testing of the hedging performance with respect to model error; the optimal portfolio under a suitable cost consideration performs much more robustly with respect to model error. Finally, we discuss computational issues for large scale CVaR optimization problems and consider a smoothing technique which solves a CVaR optimization problem more eÆciently than the standard linear programming methods...|$|E
