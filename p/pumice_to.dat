50|$|Surfaces of restorations may {{be damaged}} by {{conventional}} tooth polishing with prophylactic paste. Materials such as gold, amalgam, composite, porcelain and titanium implants can be polished by using specifically designed pastes {{such as those}} that contain rouge, tripoli, cuttle, emery, coarse <b>pumice</b> <b>to</b> prevent roughened or scratched surfaces. It is important to refer to manufacturer’s directions before using any product on dental restorations.|$|E

30|$|The {{importance}} of the pumice pore structure for the internal water curing was demonstrated. The use of full saturated <b>pumice</b> leads <b>to</b> lower autogenous deformations and higher compressive strength than the other mixtures.|$|R
50|$|Consumers wanting jeans {{that appear}} worn can buy jeans {{that have been}} {{specially}} treated. To give the fabrics the worn look, sandblasting done with chemicals or by adding <b>pumice</b> stone <b>to</b> the washing process or abrading with sandpaper is often done.|$|R
50|$|Below {{the village}} once lay a farm, {{which may have}} been the “seed” for the first {{settlement}} in what is now the municipality. The oldest houses are all bungalows built out of Rhenish brick (an air-dried brick made of 9 parts <b>pumice</b> <b>to</b> 1 part lime) and simple woodwork. The front door opens straight into the kitchen. Above the stove was the smoke hood for smoking meat.|$|E
50|$|While Gernot Minke, the German {{professor}} of earthen architecture, first developed a technique of using bags filled with <b>pumice</b> <b>to</b> build walls, it was architect and builder Nader Khalili who first popularized earthbag construction (particularly for residential buildings). Khalili called his technique superadobe, because he filled the bags with moistened adobe soil. Buildings at the Cal Earth Institute in Hesperia, CA, which he established in 1991, include domes and vaulted roofs. Khalili pioneered code approval of earthbag domes for seismic risk regions. Several books and videos {{have been produced}} by the institute to demonstrate his methods, however {{a number of other}} individuals and groups now offer training workshops.|$|E
5000|$|In the past, {{teeth with}} stains or other color {{changes were made}} to look better {{through the use of}} {{restorative}} materials, such as dental porcelain. These materials would create a thin veneer over the outer surface of the tooth. Although veneers looked better, these materials did not match the structure or characteristics of the tooth enamel and replacement was frequently needed. As far back as 1916, some researchers were advocating instead removing a thin layer of the outermost enamel to expose the (presumably) undamaged layer underneath. [...] The first practical application of enamel microabrasion was developed by Theodore Croll and Richard Cavanaugh in 1986, who used a combination of weak hydrochloric acid and <b>pumice</b> <b>to</b> remove a few tenths of millimeters of the enamel.|$|E

50|$|Rodney Strong Vineyards {{sustainably}} farms their 14 estate vineyards. They are certified sustainable by the California Sustainable Winegrowing Alliance {{and were}} the first carbon neutral winery in Sonoma County.Their sustainable practices include solar panels which were installed in 2003 {{on the roof of}} the barrel room. At the time this was the largest winery solar array in the world. They use soil management techniques to conserve the land including: proper runoff management, erosion prevention, reducing soil compaction, composting grape <b>pumice</b> <b>to</b> return to the soils as organic matter, minimal tillage and the intelligent use of cover crops. Vineyard water management is extremely important and includes using drip irrigation to reduce water use, along with tools, technologies and strategies to monitor water in soils and vines. Rodney Strong Vineyards are Fish Friendly Farming (FFF) certified to restore fish and wildlife habitats and improve water quality. They protect air quality by using natural cover crops, completely eliminating the burning of winter prunings and the use of environmentally safe wetting agents for vineyard roads.|$|E
5000|$|The {{lowest levels}} of the present {{basilica}} contain remnants of {{the foundation of a}} possibly republican era building that might have been destroyed in the Great Fire of 64. An industrial building - probably the imperial mint of Rome from the late 1st century A.D. onwards (because a similar building is represented on a 16th-century drawing of a fragment of the Severan marble plan of the city), was built or remodelled on the same site during the Flavian period. Shortly after an insula, or apartment block, was also built. It was separated from the industrial building by a narrow alleyway. About a hundred years later (c. 200) a mithraeum, a sanctuary of the cult of Mithras, was built in the courtyard of the insula. The main cult room (the speleum, [...] "cave"), which is about 9.6m long and 6m wide, was discovered in 1867 but could not be investigated until 1914 due to lack of drainage. The exedra, the shallow apse {{at the far end of}} the low vaulted space, was trimmed with <b>pumice</b> <b>to</b> render it more cave-like.|$|E
50|$|The tallest {{mountain}} Ruapehu, is an Andesite cone {{that was}} once twice as high but has been eroded. All of the cones are composite stratovolcanoes made up of layers of lava and tephra. They are in the intermediate category meaning they have a moderate amount of silica in the magma. The percentage of silica is the deciding factor in the thickness or viscosity of the lava. This contrasts with ignimbrite which is a gas-rich material ejected from the ground at high speed forming a giant white hot fountain 55 kilometres high. When the ignimbrite falls it flows outwards at high speed (600-900 km/h) and can travel many kilometres even going up and over hills and mountains before it cools, trapping air inside. Especially around Lake Taupo the eroded ignimbrite includes pieces of pumice, a lightweight rock that floats on water. The top, unwelded layer of the ignimbrite sheet is relatively soft and easily eroded by streams and rivers which transport the <b>pumice</b> <b>to</b> the lake. The lower, welded layers of the ignimbrite sheets are more dense, though still porous. These lower compressed layers often show the glint of heated silicon specks. This stone, called Hinuera stone(after the quarry of origin), is used for building cladding. The ring plain around the central volcanoes is formed from numerous lahars or mudflows that occur when either the crater lake water is ejected from Ruapehu or snow is melted, during an eruption. The water runs down the mountain picking up ash, lapilli, blocks and bombs as well as previously eroded rock forming a thick dense mud {{that is capable of}} picking up car sized rocks. An old lahar flow is visible from the approach road to Whakapapa ski field. In December 1953 a sudden lahar at night on Mt Ruapehu knocked out the rail bridge at Tangiwai causing three carriages of the Wellington-Auckland express to plunge into the Whangaehu River killing many passengers.The last major eruption in the area was the last eruption from the Lake Taupo volcanic complex 1800 years ago which ejected lava and especially wind blown tephra over a wide area to the north and north east of the North Island. About 30cubic kilometres of material were released making this the biggest volcanic event in the world in the last 5,000 years.|$|E
50|$|Once this debris {{was blown}} out, a {{fountain}} of cinders shot up a great distance into the sky. As this huge amount of ash and <b>pumice</b> began <b>to</b> fall back towards the earth, it formed a pumice ring, or cinder cone, about the original vent. This cinder cone is still visible today.|$|R

30|$|Batch {{experimental}} {{laboratory scale}} studies were undertaken {{in a different}} world on the potential of <b>pumice</b> <b>to</b> reduce the concentration of heavy metals including chromium from aqueous solution in the laboratory. But in this study the chromium removal efficiency of pumice and scoria was done from real tannery wastewater.|$|E
30|$|Since {{industrial}} effluents like tannery wastewater containing sulfide and sulfate are {{toxic to}} aquatic environment, {{it is essential}} to reduce them and bring the discharge levels of these species to below the toxic limit. In this investigation the sulfate removal potential of pumice was greater than scoria the efficiency of <b>pumice</b> <b>to</b> remove sulfate was from 83 to 84 % whereas scoria shows from 75 to 77 %. In general both filter mediums were effective to remove sulfide and sulfate from tannery wastewater.|$|E
30|$|The {{untreated}} tannery wastewater {{revealed that}} the mean concentration of BOD 5, COD, TSS, orthophosphate, ammonium, nitrite, nitrate, sulfide, sulfate and chromium were beyond the permissible limits. Nitrate removal efficiency of scoria and pumice were 99 and 95 % respectively at retention time of 72  h. Phosphate removal was better by scoria on the first 24 and 48  h. The efficiency of <b>pumice</b> <b>to</b> remove sulfate was 83 – 84 %, whereas scoria shows 75 – 77 %. In the first 24 and 48  h retention time, pumice and scoria achieved 76 and 71 % in chromium reduction respectively.|$|E
50|$|The lavas of {{different}} volcanoes, when cooled and hardened, differ much in their appearance and composition. If a rhyolite lava-stream cools quickly, it can quickly freeze {{into a black}} glassy substance called obsidian. When filled with bubbles of gas, the same lava may form the spongy appearing <b>pumice.</b> Allowed <b>to</b> cool slowly, it forms a light-colored, uniformly solid rock called rhyolite.|$|R

40|$|In {{this study}} about {{internal}} curing of High Performance Concrete, X-ray absorption showed that considerable {{transport of water}} from saturated lightweight aggregates (<b>pumice)</b> <b>to</b> hydrating cement paste [water/cement (w/c) ratio 0. 3] {{took place in the}} first days after casting and covered a distance of at least 4 mm. As a consequence, the amount of water released by the lightweight aggregates, rather than the spatial distribution of the aggregates, is in this case the crucial factor to avoid early-age self-desiccation shrinkage. INTRODUCTlON High strength cementitious materials are characterized by superior propenies in the hardened state. Yet, their application encounters some difficulties, in panicular due to sensitivity to earlyage cracking, which is associated with sell-desiccation and autogenous shrinkagle (1). Conventional curing techniques are not always effective in eliminating cracking, since the water migration into the concrete is limited by the tightness of the cement paste (2) ...|$|E
