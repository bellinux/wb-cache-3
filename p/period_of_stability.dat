5|$|Conrad {{completed}} {{construction of}} the castles of Hohensalzburg, Werfen, and Friesach, which Archbishop Gebhard had started to build in 1077. In Styria, he reformed the military organization and administration of church properties, and built strong fortresses. For defense against Hungary, he built strongholds at Leibnitz (Seggau) and Pettau (Ptuj), and Brestanica castle. He also expanded the Burg Deutschlandsberg castle {{at the center of}} the Salzburg possessions in western Styria. In 1131, he made peace with King Béla II of Hungary, which was followed by a long <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>stability</b> in the border region.|$|E
5|$|During the Russian Civil War, and {{immediately}} afterwards, the Commissariat usually confiscated property to support government operations. Following a short <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>stability</b> {{after the civil}} war the Commissariat introduced several governmental taxes on the population. The commissariat's structure differed little from its Tsarist predecessor, the only notable difference was that the Soviet ministry was very centralised while the Tsarist's finance ministry was a very decentralised one. The Commissariat, and later the Ministry, prepared the state budget in a joint process with its republican and local branches. The Ministry's structure went through few changes due to the Soviet government's conservative approaches to change. Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev introduced several reforms during his rule which had the unintended consequence of considerably hurting the ministry's prestige.|$|E
5|$|Following the European tour, Butthole Surfers {{experienced}} more upheaval when Nervosa left around Christmas 1985, {{as she was}} tired of the living conditions associated with constant touring and had a desire to be with family. She was replaced by another female drummer, Kytha Gernatt, who was dubbed Cabbage Gomez, Jr. in the press soon after joining the band. Cabbage had previously performed with Kathleen Lynch (a.k.a. Kathleen, a.k.a. Ta-Da the Shit Lady) in the band Easturn Stars; Lynch gained fame as Butthole Surfers' infamous naked dancer from 1986 to 1989. Kramer also left during this period and was replaced by Jeff Pinkus, who gave the band's bass position its longest <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>stability</b> by staying until 1994.|$|E
40|$|A {{method has}} been {{presented}} for detecting, recording and automatically analyzing turbulent temperature fluctuations in the atmosphere. The method is used to present, in tabulated form, the data necessary for the computations of the means, standard deviations and correlation coefficient for two electrical signals representing the temperature fluctuations at two detectors. The recording system increases the versatility of the analysis system by acting as a memory so that the original raw data are not lost for re-examination and analysis;The errors and limitations of the instrumental aspects of this investigation have been analyzed and discussed;From the experimental results of this investigation the following conclusions have been drawn. The intensity of thermal turbulence has a dependence upon atmospheric <b>stability.</b> The intensity <b>of</b> the thermal fluctuations is greater during <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> instability than during <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> <b>stability.</b> The intensity <b>of</b> the thermal fluctuations decreases with height during <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> instability and increases with height during <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> <b>stability.</b> The vertical scale of thermal turbulence increases with decreasing stability. The {{rate at which the}} vertical scale of thermal turbulence increases with height is greater during <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> instability than during <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> <b>stability...</b>|$|R

5|$|Casimir IV's successor, John I Albert, {{wanted to}} grant Moldavia to his younger brother, Sigismund, but Stephen's {{diplomacy}} {{prevented him from}} invading Moldavia for years. John Albert broke into Moldavia in 1497, but Stephen and his Hungarian and Ottoman allies routed the Polish army in the Battle of the Cosmin Forest. Stephen again tried to recapture Chilia and Cetatea Albă, but had to acknowledge {{the loss of the}} two ports to the Ottomans in 1503. During his last years, his son and co-ruler, Bogdan III, played {{an active role in the}} government. Stephen's long rule represented a <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>stability</b> in the history of Moldavia. From the 16th century onwards both his subjects and foreigners remembered him as a great ruler. Modern Romanians regard him as one of their greatest national heroes, although he also endures as a cult figure in Moldovenism. After the Romanian Orthodox Church canonized him in 1992, he is venerated as Stephen the Great and Holy (Ștefan cel Mare și Sfânt).|$|E
5|$|However, the {{financial}} crisis of 2007–08 ended this <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>stability,</b> and, on 16 April 2007, the governor (at that time Mervyn King), was obliged to write the first MPC open letter to the chancellor (Gordon Brown), explaining why the inflation had deviated from the target of 2% per year {{by more than one}} percentage point (3.1%). By February 2013, he had had to write 14 such letters to chancellors. Between October 2008 and March 2009 the base rate was cut six times to an all-time low of 0.5% in order to avoid deflation and spur growth. In March 2009, the MPC launched a programme of quantitative easing, initially injecting £75 billion into the economy. By March 2010, it had also increased the amount of money set aside for quantitative easing to £200 billion, a figure later increased by a further £75 billion in the months following October 2011. The MPC announced two further £50 billion rounds of quantitative easing in February and July 2012, bringing the total to £375 billion whilst simultaneously keeping the base rate at 0.5%. In March 2013, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, called on the MPC to follow its American counterpart (the Federal Reserve Board) in committing itself to keeping interest rates low for a prolonged period of time via appropriate forward guidance, which it did on 7 August.|$|E
5|$|The Queen, seeking {{support of}} her own son's claims to the throne over those of Surendra, invited Mathabar Singh Thapa back after almost six years in exile. Upon his arrival in Kathmandu, an {{investigation}} of his uncle's death took place, {{and a number of}} his Pande enemies were massacred. As for Ranajang Pande, he had by that time contracted mental illness and would not have posed any threat to Mathabar. Nevertheless, Ranajang was paraded through the streets and made to witness the execution of his family members, after which he was forced to commit suicide by poison. By December 1843, Mathabar Singh was appointed prime minister; but after a year in power, he alienated both the King and the Queen by supporting Surendra's claim over the throne. On May 17, 1845, he was assassinated, on both the King and Queen's orders, by his nephew, Jang Bahadur Kunwar. The death of Mathabar Singh ended the Thapa hegemony and set the stage for Kot massacre and the establishment of Rana Dynasty, a dictatorship of hereditary prime ministers, which was founded on the basic template provided by Bhimsen Thapa. These events provided the long <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>stability</b> the country needed but at the cost of political and economic development.|$|E
50|$|The Punctuated Equilibrium model {{originated}} in the 1980s and is a complement to complexity theory. It argues that organizations evolve over time, with long <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> <b>stability</b> that are disrupted by short <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> large change. These disruptions {{set the stage for}} a new period in the life of the organization.|$|R
5|$|Paleoclimatology is {{the study}} of past climate over a great <b>period</b> <b>of</b> the Earth's history. It uses {{evidence}} from ice sheets, tree rings, sediments, coral, and rocks to determine the past state of the climate. It demonstrates <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> <b>stability</b> and <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> change and can indicate whether changes follow patterns such as regular cycles.|$|R

25|$|The {{cognitive}} account {{suggests that}} memories are remembered best because they occur {{during a period}} of rapid change followed by a period of relative stability. There is an assumed memory advantage for the novel and distinct events that is followed by a <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>stability.</b> The novel events are subject to greater elaborative cognitive processing leading to better encoding of these memories. Moreover, the <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>stability</b> that follows increases the stability of the cues for these memories and increases the chances of recall.|$|E

50|$|Although some {{patients}} present with normal lung function, {{pulmonary function tests}} generally demonstrate fixed airway obstruction with a decreased FEV1 and reduced FEV1/FVC ratio without bronchodilator response. Air trapping is common and leads to increased residual volumes. As the disease progresses, a mixed pattern of obstruction and restriction may develop. In general the obstructive lung disease is slowly progressive with <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> <b>stability.</b>|$|R
25|$|With Mark Cohon as {{commissioner}} of the league the CFL entered a <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>stability</b> and growth. New television deals, two new collective bargaining agreements, the 100th Grey Cup celebration, and widespread stadium renovation and rebuilding highlighted this era. The 100th anniversary of the Grey Cup had the highest ever television ratings for a championship game in English Canada.|$|E
25|$|By the dynasty's end, a very {{different}} state had emerged: medieval Byzantium, a chiefly agrarian, military-dominated society that was engaged in a lengthy struggle with the Muslim Caliphate. However, this state was also far more homogeneous, being reduced to its mostly Greek-speaking and firmly Chalcedonian core territories, which enabled it to weather these storms and enter a <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>stability</b> under the successor Isaurian Dynasty.|$|E
25|$|In 1974 a {{study of}} the ZETA results {{demonstrated}} an interesting side-effect; after an experimental run ended, the plasma would enter a short <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>stability.</b> This led to the reversed field pinch concept, which has seen some level of development since. On May 1, 1974, the KMS fusion company (founded by Kip Siegel) achieves the world's first laser induced fusion in a deuterium-tritium pellet.|$|E
50|$|Boundary {{conditions}} were also addressed on choosing between structural and contextual ambidexterity. For example, spatial separation was suggested {{as an appropriate}} solution for environments characterized by long <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> <b>stability,</b> disrupted by rare events of discontinuous change. Research also found that firms operating in dynamic competitive environments rely on contextual ambidexterity rather than developing spatially separated units (Jansen, van den Bosch, & Volberda, 2005).|$|R
