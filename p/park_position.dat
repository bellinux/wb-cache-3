5000|$|The Controlled Coupling HydraMatic {{incorporated}} a secondary fluid coupling {{and a pair}} of sprag clutches in place of the former friction clutch and brake bands, shifting in part by alternately draining and filling the secondary coupling. It was a later version of GM's [...] "dual range Hydra-Matic", first introduced in some 1952 models. The dual range feature allowed the driver to hold the transmission in third gear until the maximum allowable upshift points, for improved performance in traffic or in mountain driving.

Also, the original Hydramatic required periodic band adjustments as a routine maintenance item that later versions did not. Early 1940 model Oldsmobiles with Hydra-Matic Drive could be started with the transmission selector lever in any position. The car would then start to move, unless the transmission lever had been left in N, neutral.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Automatic/semi-automatic parking system {{consists}} of three components: target <b>parking</b> <b>position</b> designation, path planning, and path tracking. This paper summarizes published papers about target <b>parking</b> <b>position</b> designation up to now, and proposes four phase strategy based on the strong and weak points of each method. Generally, target <b>parking</b> <b>position</b> designation can be classified into four categories: GUI-based, parking slot marking-based, free space-based, and infrastructure-based. Among them, according to used sensor and signal processing technology free space-based {{can be divided into}} seven categories again: ultrasonic sensor-based, short range radar(SRR) -based, still image-based, motion stereo-based, binocular stereo-based, light stripe projection(LSP) based, and scanning laser radar-based. As we can not find one almighty method, we expect target <b>parking</b> <b>position</b> designation method to evolve according to changes of related technologies and industrial environments. Our prediction suggests four phase strategy: 1) Ultrasonic sensor-based free space detection + rear view camera-based monitoring, 2) ultrasonic sensor-based free space detection + human machine interface (HMI) + semi-automatic parking slot markings recognition, 3) scanning laser radar-based + HMI + semi-automatic parking slot markings recognition, and 4) scanning laser radar-based...|$|R
30|$|Moreover, {{according}} to whether they have a fixed <b>parking</b> <b>position,</b> the PrEVs {{can be divided into}} three groups: ① Group A, the PrEVs with fixed <b>parking</b> <b>position</b> and self-charging posts. ② Group B, the PrEVs without fixed <b>parking</b> <b>position</b> but equipped with battery swapping system. ③ Group C, for which centralized charging in charging station is the only choice. Assuming a PrEV in Group C can finish its charging before 22 : 00, it charges and leaves, otherwise the charging station will take charge of it for both charging and parking till its owner come to pick it up on the next day. According to [19], the proportions of Group A, B and C are set as 0.55, 0.33 and 0.12 respectively.|$|R
50|$|The HydraMatic was {{designed}} to combine hydraulic operation of a planetary gearbox (allowing much shifting to be automated) with a fluid coupling instead of a friction clutch, {{eliminating the need for}} de-clutching. The transmission would have four forward speeds (3.82:1, 2.63:1, 1.45:1, and 1.00:1) plus reverse, with all acceleration provided by gearing; its fluid coupling did not multiply the engine output as a torque converter does. (In this way, it was less sophisticated than the 1924 Vulcan (Vulcan-Werke Hamburg und Stettin) prototype, which had a torque converter.) It incorporated a parking pawl which was engaged when the shift selector was placed in reverse with the engine off. There was no separate <b>Park</b> <b>position</b> as found with modern transmissions.|$|E
50|$|The Thunderbird for 1961 {{introduced}} several firsts for {{the automotive}} market. The most distinctive {{feature of the}} 1961 to 1963 Thunderbirds was the highly touted 'Swing Away' steering wheel. With the transmission in the <b>park</b> <b>position</b> the steering wheel would slide approximately 18 in to the right allowing the driver to exit the vehicle easily. Other innovations include a floating rear view mirror. Common on all autos produced today, this feature was first found on 1961 Thunderbirds. Depending on variable options Thunderbirds for 1961 could be purchased with options like air conditioning, power windows, power seats, AM radio, fender skirts and white wall tires. Several standard features, like power steering and power brakes, back up lights and bucket seats were costly options on most other autos.|$|E
5000|$|A car {{should be}} allowed to come to a {{complete}} stop before setting the transmission into park to prevent damage. Usually, Park (P) is one of only two selections in which the car's engine can be started, the other being Neutral (N). This is typically achieved via a normally open inhibitor switch (sometimes called a [...] "neutral safety switch") wired in series with the starter motor engagement circuit, which is closed when P or N is selected, completing the circuit (when the key is turned to the start position). In many modern cars and trucks, the driver must have the foot brake applied before the transmission can be taken out of park. The <b>Park</b> <b>position</b> is omitted on buses/coaches (and some road tractors) with automatic transmission (on which a parking pawl is not practical), which must instead be placed in neutral with the air-operated parking brakes set.|$|E

5000|$|The first {{automatic}} transmission using hydraulic fluid {{was developed in}} 1932 by two Brazilian engineers, José Braz Araripe and Fernando Lehly Lemos; Later, the prototype and the project were sold to General Motors, who introduced the technology in the 1940 Oldsmobile model as a [...] "Hydra-Matic" [...] transmission. However, an article published by the Wall Street Journal credits the German auto parts company ZF Friedrichshafen for the invention, which would have occurred shortly after World War I. In 1934, both REO and General Motors developed semi-{{automatic transmission}}s that were less difficult to operate than a fully manual unit. These designs, however, continued to use a clutch to engage the engine with the transmission. The General Motors unit, dubbed the [...] "Automatic Safety Transmission," [...] was notable in that it employed a power-shifting planetary gearbox that was hydraulically controlled and was sensitive to road speed, anticipating future development. Parallel to the development in the 1930s of an automatically shifting gearbox was Chrysler's work on adapting the fluid coupling to automotive use. Invented early in the 20th century, the fluid coupling was {{the answer to the}} question of how to avoid stalling the engine when the vehicle was stopped with the transmission in gear. Chrysler itself never used the fluid coupling with any of its automatic transmissions, but did use it in conjunction with a hybrid manual transmission called [...] "Fluid Drive" [...] (the similar Hy-Drive used a torque converter). These developments in automatic gearbox and fluid coupling technology eventually culminated in the introduction in 1939 of the General Motors Hydra-Matic, the world's first mass-produced automatic transmission. Available as an option on 1940 Oldsmobiles and later Cadillacs, the Hydra-Matic combined a fluid coupling with three hydraulically controlled planetary gearsets to produce four forward speeds plus reverse. The transmission was sensitive to engine throttle position and road speed, producing fully automatic up- and down-shifting that varied according to operating conditions. The Hydra-Matic was subsequently adopted by Cadillac and Pontiac, and was sold to various other automakers, including Bentley, Hudson, Kaiser, Nash, and Rolls-Royce. It also found use during World War II in some military vehicles. From 1950 to 1954, Lincoln cars were also available with the Hydra-Matic. Mercedes-Benz subsequently devised a four-speed fluid coupling transmission that was similar in principle to the Hydra-Matic, but of a different design. Interestingly, the original Hydra-Matic incorporated two features which are widely emulated in today's transmissions. The Hydra-Matic's ratio spread through the four gears produced excellent [...] "step-off" [...] and acceleration in first, good spacing of intermediate gears, and the effect of an overdrive in fourth, by virtue of the low numerical rear axle ratio used in the vehicles of the time. In addition, in third and fourth gear, the fluid coupling only handled a portion of the engine's torque, resulting in a high degree of efficiency. In this respect, the transmission's behavior was similar to modern units incorporating a lock-up torque converter. In 1956, GM introduced the [...] "Jetaway" [...] Hydra-Matic, which was different in design than the older model. Addressing the issue of shift quality, which was an ongoing problem with the original Hydra-Matic, the new transmission utilized two fluid couplings, the primary one that linked the transmission to the engine, and a secondary one that replaced the clutch assembly that controlled the forward gearset in the original. The result was much smoother shifting, especially from first to second gear, but with a loss in efficiency and an increase in complexity. Another innovation for this new style Hydra-Matic was the appearance of a <b>Park</b> <b>position</b> on the selector. The original Hydra-Matic, which continued in production until the mid-1960s, still used the reverse position for parking pawl engagement. The first torque converter automatic, Buick's Dynaflow, was introduced for the 1948 model year. It was followed by Packard's Ultramatic in mid-1949 and Chevrolet's Powerglide for the 1950 model year. Each of these transmissions had only two forward speeds, relying on the converter for additional torque multiplication. In the early 1950s, BorgWarner developed a series of three-speed torque converter automatics for American Motors, Ford Motor Company, Studebaker, and several other manufacturers in the US and other countries. Chrysler was late in developing its own true automatic, introducing the two-speed torque converter PowerFlite in 1953, and the three-speed TorqueFlite in 1956. The latter was the first to utilize the Simpson compound planetary gearset. General Motors produced multiple-turbine torque converters from 1954 to 1961. These included the Twin-Turbine Dynaflow and the triple-turbine Turboglide transmissions. The shifting took place in the torque converter, rather than through pressure valves and changes in planetary gear connections. Each turbine was connected to the drive shaft through a different gear train. These phased from one ratio to another according to demand, rather than shifting. The Turboglide actually had two speed ratios in reverse, with one of the turbines rotating backwards. By the late 1960s, most of the fluid-coupling four-speed and two-speed transmissions had disappeared in favor of three-speed units with torque converters. Also around this time, whale oil was removed from automatic transmission fluid. By the early 1980s, these were being supplemented and eventually replaced by overdrive-equipped transmissions providing four or more forward speeds. Many transmissions also adopted the lock-up torque converter (a mechanical clutch locking the torque converter pump and turbine together to eliminate slip at cruising speed) to improve fuel economy. As computerized engine control units (ECUs) became more capable, much of the logic built into the transmission's valve body was offloaded to the ECU. Some manufacturers use a separate computer dedicated to the transmission called a transmission control unit (TCU), also known as the transmission control module (TCM), which shares information with the engine management computer. In this case, solenoids turned on and off by the computer control shift patterns and gear ratios, rather than the spring-loaded valves in the valve body. This allows for more precise control of shift points, shift quality, lower shift times, and (on some newer cars) semi-automatic control, where the driver tells the computer when to shift. The result is an impressive combination of efficiency and smoothness. Some computers even identify the driver's style and adapt to best suit it.|$|E
40|$|Wireless sensor {{networks}} commonly {{consist of}} a large number of tiny sensor nodes that are deployed either inside the target area or very close to it to cooperatively monitor the target area. Energy efficiency and network lifetime are two challenges that most of researchers deal with. In this paper, to improve the performance of sensor networks, we propose an energyefficient competitive clustering algorithm for wireless sensor networks using a controlled mobile sink. Clustering algorithm can effectively organize sensor nodes and the use of a controlled mobile sink node can mitigate hot spot problem or energy holes. The selection of optimal moving trajectory for sink nodes is an NP-hard problem. In our algorithm, we firstly study an competitive clustering algorithm in which cluster heads are rotated in each round and selected mainly based on their competition range and their residual energy. Besides, we use mobile sink node instead of fixed sink node. The mobile sink node moves at a certain speed along a predefined path and sojourn at some <b>park</b> <b>position</b> to collect data packets. Simulation results validate that competitive clustering algorithm outperforms LEACH and the use of mobile sink node significantly improve the performance of the sensor network...|$|E

A Computer Aided Engineering (CAE) tool to calculate the output that is required for an evaluation of a park lock mechanism design will be created.

The CAE tool created uses an Excel Visual Basics for Applications (VBA) workbook for all calculations. The tool allows the user to choose different vehicles with the required specification to evaluate the values for that PLM. The CAE tool will save time and cost if lots of different PLM’s are going to be designed. The CAE tool has potential for future work when more calculations can be added that can be in use for the evaluation the PLM.

40|$|In this study, a {{model for}} the {{evaluation}} of the environmental risk of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD) for the aquatic organisms has been developed. These compounds are brominated flame retardants (BRFs) used in plastics, electronic devices, textiles and others to prevent fire. The model designed is based on a technical application of the Fuzzy Theory. In particular, three interconnected Fuzzy Inference Systems (FIS) have been created through the use of the Fuzzy Toolbox in Matlab. In order to improve and make the model scientifically robust, several international experts have been questioned about different information needed to build the fuzzy system. Information from 38 questionnaires have been collected and statistically treated. The model has been tested in two case studies, using the data provided by four samples campaigns in two Ebro tributaries in north east of the Spain, the Cinca River (2002 and 2004) and the Vero River (2004 and 2005). Concentrations in biota and sediments obtained in the sample campaigns have been used directly as input for the model. Missing data for HBCD and PBDEs, as BMF factor and toxicity data have been obtained through scientific literature. In both rivers, there exists an industrial park with a widespread use and consequently discharge of flame retardants into the water body. The proposed model evaluates the risk in different points according to the industrial <b>park</b> <b>position.</b> In the Vero River, only PBDEs have been found. The risk of these compounds for the aquatic organisms before the source of pollution has been categorized as LOW (both in 2004 and 2005), with a value of 0. 352 (in a range [0 - 1]). After the industrial park, the risk (0. 62) has been considered to be mainly MODERATE in 2004, and mainly HIGH (0. 78) in 2005. In Cinca River, four different samples points have been analysed, finding a HIGH risk (0. 78) for HBCD in the most contaminated site (near the industrial city of Monzón). Values for PBDEs are much lower in this case study, representing LOW risk in all the analysed points. Concerning the model design, the classic procedure of the FIS has been modified with the aim to give weights or relative importance to the several environmental variables involved in the model. This new insight has been compared with the classic FIS system and has proved to be more conservative and sensitive for all the case studies. The results obtained with the proposed methodology prove that the qualitative environmental risk assessment of PBDEs and HBCD is possible through fuzzy logic. Numerical values and bibliographic data can be translated into fuzzy sets, dealing with the uncertainty and providing a final output easy to understand by the human mind (e. g. LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH risk). This information can be very useful for the decision making processes...|$|E
