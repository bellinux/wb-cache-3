5|$|One {{does not}} only feel a social or {{external}} pressure to fulfill roles {{and expectations of}} being a good parent, sibling, or child, however. There is a distinctly emotional and internal pressure to be ‘good’ due to psychological attachments in spousal, sibling and/or parent-children relationships. Psychological persuasion in advertisements appeals to one's motives, attitudes and personalities. The family symbol is psychologically persuasive in that it appeals to the emotional attachments between spouses, siblings, or <b>parent-child</b> relationships. To continue the above example, the mother not only wants to purchase a product that purportedly limits irritation or harm for her child due to her social role and expectations, but also because she feels an emotional attachment to her child. The attempt to activate the emotions of audiences and to psychologically persuade is popular among advertisements. Family affects us significantly on this psychological level – {{the level at which}} advertisements are most effective.|$|E
5|$|Minority Report also {{continues}} Spielberg's {{tradition of}} depicting broken families.*Vest. pg. 136 In Dick's short story, Anderton is a childless, married man whose main motives are self-preservation and preventing the disassembly of the PreCrime division. While {{he is also}} trying to save himself in the movie, his greater concern is uncovering the story behind his son's disappearance. Spielberg would later transform his next science fiction film, War of the Worlds, from a story about a single man to one about a divorced father concerned with protecting his children. Buckland notes that the two tragic <b>parent-child</b> relationships in the picture (Agatha and Ann Lively, John and Sean Anderton) have a common element. The movie has four shots of them submerged in water. Agatha's face is shown in a close up shot, taken from directly above her, when she is submerged in her photon milk, nutrient bath. When photos of her mother's submerged corpse are shown to her, the emphasized photograph is a similar image of her face taken from directly above. Anderton and his son are shown together in a pool flashback scene in which they have a contest to see who can hold their breath longest. John is underwater when his son is taken, and later in the apartment he is shown lying motionless, immersed in a filled bathtub, in a manner Buckland finds similar to the shots of Agatha and Ann. Buckland notes that co-screenwriter Frank introduced the water theme, as he wrote Agatha and her mother's back stories while adding the bathtub scene.|$|E

40|$|An image {{compression}} algorithm based on wavelet packet transform is introduced. The algorithm extends the <b>parent-children</b> link established across dyadic wavelet decomposition bands to a <b>parent-children</b> link across wavelet packet decomposition bands. Then, a method {{proposed for the}} efficient encoding of dyadic wavelet transform coefficients [1] is used for encoding of wavelet packet transform coefficients. The method exploits interband and intraband dependencies of the transform coefficients. Experimental results show that wavelet packet transform brings consistent improvement over dyadic wavelet transform. 1. INTRODUCTION Wavelet packet transform (WPT) is a generalization of the dyadic wavelet transform (DWT) that offers a rich set of decomposition structures. WPT was first introduced by Coifman et al.

25|$|The APSAC Task Force {{describes}} how the conceptual focus of these treatments is the child's individual internal pathology and past caregivers rather than current <b>parent-child</b> relationships or current environment. If the child is well-behaved outside the home this is seen as successful manipulation of outsiders, rather than as evidence of {{a problem in the}} current home or current <b>parent-child</b> relationship. The APSAC Task Force noted that this perspective has its attractions because it relieves the caregivers of responsibility to change aspects of their own behavior and aspirations. Proponents believe that traditional therapies fail to help children with attachment problems because it is impossible to establish a trusting relationship with them. They believe this is because children with attachment problems actively avoid forming genuine relationships. Proponents emphasize the child's resistance to attachment and the need to break it down. In rebirthing and similar approaches, protests of distress from the child are considered to be resistance that must be overcome by more coercion.|$|E

Studies have shown that as immediate as 24 hours after a child is born most parents have already engaged in gender stereotypic expectations of sons or daughters. Through examples such as painting a room pink or blue, encouragement to participate in shared sex-typed activities, offering gender differentiated toys, or treating the opposite sex child differently, these <b>parent-child</b> interactions have long lasting influence on how a child connects to certain gender-specific behaviors.|$|E
25|$|Some {{characteristics}} of stuttered speech {{are not as}} easy for listeners to detect. As a result, diagnosing stuttering requires the skills of a certified speech-language pathologist (SLP).

Information from both sources should span multiple, various settings and times. The SLP may collect a case history on the individual through a detailed interview or conversation with the parents (if client is a child). They may also observe <b>parent-child</b> interactions and observe the speech patterns of the child's parents. The overall goal of assessment for the SLP will be (1) to determine whether a speech disfluency exists, and (2) assess if its severity warrants concern for further treatment.|$|E

25|$|Corresponding {{with the}} attitudes of {{humanistic}} psychology, the developmental potential of the child- as in the acknowledgement of their strengths {{as well as their}} handicaps, and the importance of the therapist- child relationship are central factors in Orff music therapy. Theoretical foundations are also influenced by the strong emphasis on social integration and the involvement of parents in the therapeutic process found in social paediatrics. Knowledge of developmental psychology puts into perspective how developmental disabilities influence the child, as do their social and familial environments. The basis for interaction in this method is known as responsive interaction, in which the therapist meets the child at their level and responds according to their initiatives, combining both humanistic and developmental psychology philosophies. Involving the parents in this type of interaction, by having them participate directly or observe the therapist's techniques, equips the parents with ideas of how to interact appropriately with their child, thus fostering a positive <b>parent-child</b> relationship.|$|E
25|$|As {{children}} reach adolescence, {{the period}} of time between age 13 and 19, the dynamics of the <b>parent-child</b> relationship change as peer groups are now the focus of attention. An adolescent with cleft lip or cleft palate will deal with the typical challenges faced by most of their peers including issues related to self-esteem, dating and social acceptance. Adolescents, however, view appearance as the most important characteristic, above intelligence and humor. This being the case, adolescents are susceptible to additional problems because they cannot hide their facial differences from their peers. Adolescent boys typically deal with issues relating to withdrawal, attention, thought, and internalizing problems, and may possibly develop anxiousness-depression and aggressive behaviors. Adolescent girls are more likely to develop problems relating to self-concept and appearance. Individuals with cleft lip or cleft palate often deal with threats to their quality of life for multiple reasons including: unsuccessful social relationships, deviance in social appearance and multiple surgeries.|$|E
25|$|Adolescence marks a {{rapid change}} in one's role within a family. Young {{children}} tend to assert themselves forcefully, but are unable to demonstrate much influence over family decisions until early adolescence, when they are increasingly viewed by parents as equals. The adolescent faces the task of increasing independence while preserving a caring relationship {{with his or her}} parents. When children go through puberty, there is often a significant increase in <b>parent–child</b> conflict and a less cohesive familial bond. Arguments often concern minor issues of control, such as curfew, acceptable clothing, and the adolescent's right to privacy, which adolescents may have previously viewed as issues over which their parents had complete authority. Parent-adolescent disagreement also increases as friends demonstrate a greater impact on one another, new influences on the adolescent that may be in opposition to parents' values. Social media has also played an increasing role in adolescent and parent disagreements. While parents never had to worry about the threats of social media in the past, it has become a dangerous place for children. While adolescents strive for their freedoms, the unknowns to parents of what their child is doing on social media sites is a challenging subject, due to the increasing amount of predators on social media sites. Many parents have very little knowledge of social networking sites {{in the first place and}} this further increases their mistrust. An important challenge for the parent–adolescent relationship is to understand how to enhance the opportunities of online communication while managing its risks. Although conflicts between children and parents increase during adolescence, these are just relatively minor issues. Regarding their important life issues, most adolescents still share the same attitudes and values as their parents.|$|E
