50|$|Indistinguishability is an {{important}} property for maintaining the confidentiality of encrypted communications. However, the property of indistinguishability has in some cases been found to imply other, apparently unrelated security properties. Sometimes these implications go in both directions, making two definitions equivalent; for example, {{it is known that}} the property of indistinguishability under adaptive chosen ciphertext attack (IND-CCA2) is equivalent to the property of non-malleability under the same attack scenario (NM-CCA2). This equivalence is not immediately obvious, as non-malleability is a <b>property</b> <b>dealing</b> with message integrity, rather than confidentiality. In other cases, it has been demonstrated that indistinguishability can be combined with certain other definitions, in order to imply still other useful definitions, and vice versa. The following list summarizes a few known implications, though {{it is by no means}} complete.|$|E

Between 1996 and 1998, when a prohibition was in effect in Haryana, Pahalwan bootlegging business made him rich and powerful. Subsequently, Pahalwan started eliminating his rivals. Pahalwan's gang killed Balraj in 1998. Pahalwan was arrested that year, but released. Balraj's brother Anoop tried to reach a compromise with Pahalwan's gang, but was unsuccessful. He then started killing Pahalwan's men, and Pahalwan fled to Australia. In September 1999, Anoop's gang shot dead Pahalwan's 22-year old brother Kuldeep. In retaliation, Anoop's 19-year old nephew Yash Pal was killed by Pahalwan's gang on the same day. Pahalwan returned to India in 2003, and was arrested by the Delhi police before being released. Anoop's henchmen made several attempts to kill him. In 2004, Pahalwan's gang killed Anoop and two police officers as Anoop was being brought to a Rohtak court.

40|$|AbstractWe {{introduce}} a novel process calculus called DBSPI (distributed broadcast SPI-calculus) which models mobile ad hoc networks (MANET). The calculus is a cryptographic broadcast calculus with locations and migration. Communication and migration {{are limited to}} neighborhoods. Neighborhood definitions are explicitly part of the syntax allowing dynamic extension using bound identifiers. In this semantic setting we study authentication of agents in MANET protocols. A safety <b>property</b> <b>dealing</b> with authentication correspondence assertions is defined. Later a dependent type and effect system is given and it is shown to be sound, i. e. protocols which are typeable are also safe. This result is lifted to open systems which involves Dolev-Yao attackers. Our Dolev-Yao attacker may use public keys for encryption and can attack any neighborhood it wishes. Our technique {{is applied to the}} Mobile IP registration protocol – a type check shows it is safe. To our knowledge this is the first type system for a MANET calculus doing that...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{mainstream}} programming languages such as Erlang or Scala have renewed {{the interest}} on the Actor model of concurrency. However, {{the literature on the}} static analysis of actor systems is still lacking of mature formal methods. In this paper we present a minimal actor calculus that takes as primitive the basic constructs of Scala's Actors API. More precisely, actors can send asynchronous messages, process received messages according to a pattern matching mechanism, and dynamically create new actors, whose scope can be extruded by passing actor names as message parameters. Drawing inspiration from the linear types and session type theories developed for process calculi, we put forward a behavioural type system that addresses the key issues of an actor calculus. We then study a safety <b>property</b> <b>dealing</b> with the determinism of finite actor com- munication. More precisely, we show that well typed and balanced actor systems are (i) deadlock-free and (ii) any message will eventually be handled by the target actor, and dually no actor will indefinitely wait for an expected messag...|$|E

40|$|Gain is {{an antenna}} <b>property</b> <b>dealing</b> with an antenna’s ability to direct its {{radiated}} {{power in a}} desired direction, or synonymously, to receive energy preferentially from a desired direction. However, gain is not a quantity which can be {{defined in terms of}} physical quantities such as the Watt, ohm or joule, but is a dimensionless ratio. As a consequence, antenna gain results from the interaction of all other antenna characteristics. This article will explore these interactions using elementary definitions of antenna properties. Antenna characteristics of gain, beamwidth and efficiency are independent of the antenna’s use for either transmitting or receiving. Generally these characteristics are more simply described for the transmitting antenna; however, the properties described in this article apply to both cases. Gain definitions, and antenna characteristics related to gain, are found in a glossary on page 6, and will appear in italics within text. First, the concept of directive gain will be examined, followed by related antenna factors such as beamwidth and efficiency. Some simple equations are listed at the conclusion which permit approximate computations of directive gain and half-power beamwidth for directional type antennas...|$|E
30|$|Swelling {{capacity}} usually becomes prime {{significance in}} many practical applications of biomedical field that includes either personal hygiene products, drug delivery systems or in tissue engineering {{and also in}} agriculture as water releasing or storing system. This swelling capacity {{is said to be}} affected when comes in contact with external solutions like different ions, salt concentrations and valencies. The favorable <b>property</b> <b>dealing</b> with the hydrogel is the ability to swell when kept in any solvent. One of the best theories that explains the swelling mechanisms is the Donnan equilibrium theory which states that there always exist electrostatic interactions and osmotic pressure between inside and outside of the gel (Sadeghi and Hosseinzadeh 2010). When any hydrogel comes in contact with the solvent molecules, the solvent tries to attack the hydrogel surface and penetrate within the polymeric network structure. The hydrogel possesses any of the acidic or basic pendant groups within its polymeric backbone structure. If the acidic group is present, then the H+ ions move out and combine with the OH− ions and form H 2 O. In this way, charge neutrality gets balanced. If the cation concentration rises, then there is an increase in the osmotic pressure in the gel system which finally causes shrinkage in it. However, the equilibrium stage is achieved within the swelling phenomenon when the elastic force within the network structure of the gel as well as osmotic pressure outside balances (De et al. 2002). In this series of experiment, swelling studies of biomineralized (CaCO 3) PVP–CMC hydrogel were performed using different stimulus like: temperature, pH, and several simulated biological solutions which has been explained below.|$|E
40|$|What {{happens when}} {{resources}} get valuable and scarce? How is Intellectual <b>Property</b> <b>dealing</b> with market failures related to sub-patentable innovation or purely traditional knowledge with interesting applications? The protection of traditional knowledge and genetic resources (TKGR) {{has been one}} of the major modern challenges in international IP law. The entry into force of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) and its implementation in national legislation has created more questions than the ones it answered. The objective of this dissertation is to assist in the evaluation of current national and regional implementation initiatives as well in the presentation and evaluation of different forms of entitlements that could be applicable in the case of TKGR. The dissertation has employed a theoretical framework for this evaluation, by combining the Coase Theorem and Rawls' theory of justice. The choice of these two theoretical models is not a random one. In order for the entitlement covering TKGR to be successful, it has to be efficient. It has to offer a stable and efficient marketplace where access to TKGR is possible without unnecessary frictions. However, efficiency could not be the only objective.   An entitlement focusing solely on efficiency would fall short of the needs and special considerations of TKGR trade. It would above all be counter to the objectives and major principles of the CBD, the “fair and equitable sharing of the benefits” and would certainly fail to address the very important North-South perspective.   Fairness is thus a necessary complement to the efficiency of the proposed entitlement. This dissertation proposes a thorough investigation of the special characteristics, of right-holders, subject-matter, market place as well as of the general expectations that an entitlement is supposed to fulfill. In parallel to that, it  looks into the meaning and scope of alternative entitlements in order to be able to propose the best alternative. ...|$|E
