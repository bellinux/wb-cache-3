5000|$|SL-1200M3D (released in 1997) has {{a silver}} finish like the MK2, a {{detached}} dust cover (no hinges), and no self-locking detent ("click") at {{the zero point}} of the <b>pitch</b> <b>adjustment</b> slider, allowing more precise control of pitch near that point. It has a reset button that sets the <b>pitch</b> <b>adjustment</b> to 0, regardless of the actual position of the <b>pitch</b> <b>adjustment</b> slider. In addition the M3D series has unique details: the brand and model label is printed in a single line instead of two; and the stroboscopic light is red with a slightly orange tone. This model also introduced a slot near the counterweight allowing for storage of a second headshell.|$|E

5000|$|Some {{instruments}} can {{be played}} only with constant, mechanical vibrato (or none at all). This effect is notable in electric organists using a Leslie speaker, {{the most popular of}} which use a two-speed vibrato; a degree of expression is gained from the acceleration between speeds. Vibrato on the theremin, which is a continuously variable-pitch instrument with no [...] "stops", can range from delicate to extravagant, and often serves to mask the small <b>pitch</b> <b>adjustments</b> that instrument requires.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT * This paper {{discusses}} {{results on}} several {{issues related to}} future tiltrotor craft. Experiments show that wing trailing edge flap deflection causes a lateral shift of the wake impingement region. Steady surface blowing to redirect the wake produces a 20 % improvement in {{the effect of the}} flaps, essentially eliminating download at a low forward speed. Flow visualization and large area velocimetry have been shown in large-scale experiments, efficiently enough to enable flow control experiments. Measurement distances have reached the values needed for measurements around full-scale vehicles. Instantaneous velocity field data suggest that cyclic <b>pitch</b> <b>adjustments</b> might enable a further reduction in download...|$|R
50|$|DJ {{turntables}} {{can have}} an adjustment up to ±20%, but this is more often used for beat synchronization between songs than for <b>pitch</b> <b>adjustment,</b> which is mostly useful only in transitions between beatless and ambient parts.

5000|$|SL-1200LTD The SL-1200 Limited Edition was {{introduced}} in 1997 to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the SL-1200 series. Only 10,000 units were made, all of which sold out {{in less than a}} year. Like the MK3D, it has a pitch reset button, but differs in that it also has a self-locking detent at the zero position of <b>pitch</b> <b>adjustment.</b> This model has a piano black gloss finish and gold-plated hardware. It was priced at about US$1200.00.|$|E
50|$|Like unfretted string instruments, the {{trombone}} {{relies on}} the musician precisely positioning something, {{in this case the}} trombone's slide. The slide's <b>pitch</b> <b>adjustment</b> on a single partial is approximately the interval of a tritone on a slide length of over 80 centimeters. The trombonist may use his/her ear to minutely adjust pitch on sustained notes. By coincidence, the position of the bell on most trombones provides a reference for third position, but this is not accessible during fast passages. Articulation is also an important consideration when playing trombone: imprecise articulation may add unwanted glissando to a note not requiring it.|$|E

40|$|A tiltwing aircraft, {{capable of}} {{in-flight}} conversion between a hover and forward cruise mode, employs a counter-rotating proprotor arrangement which permits a significantly increased cruise efficiency without sacrificing either {{the size of}} the conversion envelope or the wing efficiency. A benefit in hover is also provided because of the lower effective disk loading for the counter-rotating proprotor, as opposed to a single rotation proprotor of the same diameter. At least one proprotor is provided on each wing section, preferably mounted on the wingtip, with each proprotor having two counter-rotating blade rows. Each blade row has a plurality of blades which are relatively stiff-in-plane and are mounted such that cyclic <b>pitch</b> <b>adjustments</b> may be made for hover control during flight...|$|R
5000|$|Since the {{frequency}} ratio of a semitone {{is close to}} 106%, increasing or decreasing the playback speed of a recording by 6% will shift the pitch up or down by about one semitone, or [...] "half-step". Upscale reel-to-reel magnetic tape recorders typically have <b>pitch</b> <b>adjustments</b> of up to ±6%, generally used to match the playback or recording pitch to other music sources having slightly different tunings (or possibly recorded on equipment that was not running at quite the right speed). Modern recording studios utilize digital pitch shifting to achieve similar results, ranging from cents up to several half-steps (note that reel-to-reel adjustments also affect the tempo of the recorded sound, while digital shifting does not).|$|R
50|$|Only {{available}} in Japan / Southeast Asia Markets Price for around $650.00. It has a matte black finish. This model {{is aimed at}} the hi-end audiophile market rather than DJs. It is the last model made with the detent ("click") in the neutral position (+/- 0%) of the <b>pitch</b> <b>adjustment</b> slider. In addition to the existing 33 RPM and 45 RPM buttons, the MK4 adds a 78 RPM button. It {{is designed to be}} used with regular removable RCA cables (along with a removable ground/earth cable) rather than having hard wired RCA cables like all other 1200/1210 models. The tonearm was different to the previous models as it was made from titanium.|$|E
5000|$|SL-1210M5G (released on 1 November 2002) has {{a glossy}} black finish with silver speckles. It {{was a special}} 30th-anniversary edition. It was {{initially}} launched in Japan only (together with the MK5) but then became internationally available. It switches between ±8% and ±16% ranges for <b>pitch</b> <b>adjustment,</b> and the pitch control is digital. It also features blue target lights and blue pitch-number illumination. The brake strength potentiometer, although still located beneath platter, can now be adjusted, unlike previous models, using a small plastic knob. Minor improvements over Mk2, Mk3, Mk4, & 1200LTD include improved tonearm mounting and oxygen-free copper wire, improved vibration damping in the body, improvements to pitch control accuracy and better LEDs. Available as 120 volt model for the North American market.|$|E
50|$|The {{engine is}} {{designed}} to operate at a constant speed, no matter the thrust output—a characteristic permitted by the Astafan's use of precise fuel metering and fan blade <b>pitch</b> <b>adjustment.</b> To control the engine, the pilot first sets the speed lever, which adjusts fuel flow {{in proportion to the}} selected engine speed. Then the pilot moves the thrust lever (analogous to a throttle), actuating the fan pitch piston by way of a mechanical linkage and hydraulic valve, and varying the blade pitch. In response, the speed governor holds engine speed steady by adjusting fuel delivery to the combustor. The control system also monitors turbine temperature and adjusts blade pitch (and therefore engine load) to maintain it within the preferred range of 350 °C to 450 °C. Additionally, the system automatically protects against excessive fuel delivery or unusual changes in blade pitch. Using the thrust lever, pilots can start an Astafan in fine pitch (for minimal resistive torque), select takeoff (coarse) pitch, feather the fan, or even reverse the fan pitch in flight (with the fan providing reverse thrust in lieu of conventional reversers).|$|E
40|$|Russian and German {{have been}} {{previously}} {{been described as}} ‘truncating‘, or cutting off target frequencies of the phrase-final pitch trajectories when the time available for voicing is compromised. However, supporting evidence is rare and limited to only a few pitch categories. This paper reports a production study conducted to document <b>pitch</b> <b>adjustments</b> to linguistic materials, in which the amount of voicing available for the realization of a pitch pattern varies from relatively long to extremely short. Productions of nuclear H+L*, H* and L*+H pitch accents followed by a low boundary tone were investigated in the two languages. The {{results of the study}} show that speakers of both ‘truncating languages’‘ do not exclusively utilize truncation exclusively when accommodating to different segmental environments. On the contrary, they employ several strategies – among them is truncation but also compression and temporal re-alignment –to produce the target pitch categories under increasing time pressure. Given that speakers can systematically apply all three adjustment strategies to produce some pitch patterns (H* L% in German and Russian) while not using truncation in others (H+L* L% particularly in Russian), we question the effectiveness of the typological classification of these two languages as ‘truncating’. Moreover, the phonetic detail of truncation varies considerably, both across and within the two languages, indicating that truncation cannot be easily be modeled as a unified phenomenon. The results further suggest that the phrase-final <b>pitch</b> <b>adjustments</b> are crucially sensitive to the phonological composition of the tonal string and the status of a particular tonal event (associated vs. boundary tone), and do not apply to falling vs. rising pitch contours across the board, as previously put forward for German. Implications for the intonational phonology and prosodic typology are addressed in the discussion...|$|R
25|$|Violins are tuned {{by turning}} the pegs in the pegbox under the scroll, or by {{adjusting}} the fine tuner screws at the tailpiece. All violins have pegs; fine tuners (also called fine adjusters) are optional. Most fine tuners consist of a metal screw that moves a lever attached to the string end. They permit very small <b>pitch</b> <b>adjustments</b> much more easily than the pegs. By turning one clockwise, the pitch becomes sharper (as the string is under more tension) and turning one counterclockwise, the pitch becomes flatter (as the string is under less tension).

Since modern E strings are steel, a fine tuner is typically fitted for that string. Fine tuners are not used with gut strings, which are more elastic than steel or synthetic-core strings and do not respond adequately to the very small movements of fine tuners.|$|R
40|$|Maximum 200 words) The {{sensitivity}} of blade tracking in hover to variations in root pitch was examined for two rotor configurations. Tests were conducted using a four-bladed articulated rotor {{mounted on the}} NASA-Army aeroelastic rotor experimental system (ARES). Two rotor configurations were tested: one consisting of a blade set with flexible fiberglass spars and one with stiffer (by a factor of five in flapwise and torsional stiffnesses) aluminum spars. Both blade sets were identical in planform and airfoil distribution and were untwisted. The two configurations were ballasted to the same Lock number so that a direct comparison of the tracking sensitivity to a gross change in blade stiffness could be made. Experimental results show no large {{differences between the two}} sets of blades in the {{sensitivity of}} the blade tracking to root <b>pitch</b> <b>adjustments.</b> However, a measurable reduction in in-track coning of the fiberglass spar blades with respect to the aluminum blades is noted at higher [...] ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{continuous}} conical bore construction {{patented by}} Couturier was a core principle in his designs. E.A. Couturier company {{was known for}} the unique shape of the valve tubing, which, in its original and purest form did not support any tuning slide for fine <b>pitch</b> <b>adjustment.</b> This design was to support the most continuously conical bore possible and also offered less {{resistance to air flow}} through the horn. Slides, when present, continued a conical progression by varying the wall thickness in order to achieve a movable cylindrical exterior. Those instruments built without valve slides tasked the players to bend some notes using their lips and also to rotate the horn to free the instrument of condensation during rests. The Couturier cornet was typically available in a Bb/A model with a rotary valve for selecting the key of the horn while other makers of the era such as H.N. White used interchangeable tuning slides. Couturier and the company received numerous patents for conical bore instruments, a phonograph, the A/B-flat [...] "quick change valve", and a mute design.|$|E
50|$|Despite the {{similarity}} between HS and (μ+1)-ES on some levels, there are {{a sufficient number of}} strong evidences to substantiate the fact that the two algorithms are completely different methods both conceptually and operationally. Firstly HS used <b>Pitch</b> <b>adjustment</b> probabilistic ally second, the local search strategies implemented by these techniques are completely dissimilar. In the harmony search method, if PAR test gives the answer of “yes,” the new value of a design variable is taken as the value available in the harmony matrix either one row up or down, or few rows up or down. On the other hand in evolution strategies the new value of a design variable is obtained by applying a normally distributed based mutation to the design variable. This mutation will not generate a value which may be in the one or more rows up or down. Naturally, the new value of a particular design variable will be different in this operation. Even if no mutation is applied to the design variable and one of the parent vectors is selected for the new design variable, this vector will be different from the one selected in the harmony search algorithm. This means harmony search method differs from the evolution strategies in its local search strategy.|$|E

50|$|The reed is {{considerably}} {{larger than the}} bassoon's, at 65 - 75 mm in total length (and 20 mm in width) as compared to 53 - 58 mm for most bassoon reeds. The large blades allow ample vibration that produces the low register of the instrument. The contrabassoon reed is similar to an average bassoon's in that scraping the reed affects both the intonation and response of the instrument. The fingering of the contrabassoon is slightly different {{than that of the}} bassoon, particularly at the register change and in the extreme high range. The instrument is twice as long, curves around on itself twice, and, due to its weight and shape, is supported by an endpin rather than a seat strap. Additional support is sometimes given by a strap around the player's neck. A wider hand position is also required, as the primary finger keys are widely spaced. The contrabassoon has a water key to expel condensation and a tuning slide for gross <b>pitch</b> <b>adjustments.</b> The instrument comes in a few pieces (plus bocal); some models cannot be disassembled without a screwdriver. Sometimes, however, the bell can be detached, and instruments with a low A extension often come in two parts.|$|R

40|$|The Harmony Search is a {{relatively}} new meta-heuristic algorithm for continuous optimization, in which its concept imitates the process of music improvisation. This paper proposes an improved harmony search algorithm called Harmony Search with Adaptive <b>Pitch</b> <b>Adjustment</b> (HSAPA). The adaptive <b>pitch</b> <b>adjustment</b> scheme during a search period is inspired from the velocity clamping in particle swarm optimizations. The <b>pitch</b> <b>adjustment</b> rate is also dynamically adapted. The proposed algorithm is evaluated using thirteen wellknown benchmark functions of various characteristics. The experiment is performed using both 30 and 100 dimensions to investigate its performance at both medium and high number of decision variables.

5000|$|An {{important}} {{distinction between the}} double bass {{and other members of}} the violin family is the construction of the pegbox and the tuning mechanism. While the violin, viola, and cello all use friction pegs for tuning adjustments (tightening and loosening the string tension to raise or lower the string's pitch), the double bass has metal machine heads and gears. One of the challenges with tuning pegs is that the friction between the wood peg and the peg hole may become insufficient to hold the peg in place, particularly if the peg hole become worn and enlarged. The key on the tuning machine of a double bass turns a metal worm, which drives a worm gear that winds the string. Turning the key in one direction tightens the string (thus raising its pitch); turning the key the opposite direction reduces the tension on the string (thus lowering its pitch). While this development makes fine tuners on the tailpiece (important for violin, viola and cello players, as their instruments use friction pegs for major <b>pitch</b> <b>adjustments)</b> unnecessary, a very small number of bassists use them nevertheless. One rationale for using fine tuners on bass is that for instruments with the low C extension, the pulley system for the long string may not effectively transfer turns of the key into changes of string tension/pitch. At the base of the double bass is a metal rod with a spiked or rubberized end called the endpin, which rests on the floor. This endpin is generally thicker and more robust than that of a cello, because of the greater mass of the instrument.|$|R
