50|$|Su-30MKI {{aerodynamic}} configuration is {{a longitudinal}} triplane with relaxed stability. The canard increases the aircraft lift ability and deflects automatically to allow high {{angle of attack}} (AoA) flights allowing it to perform Pugachev's Cobra. The integral aerodynamic configuration combined with thrust vectoring results in extremely capable manoeuvrability, taking off and landing characteristics. This high agility allows rapid deployment of weapons in any direction as desired by the crew. The canard notably assists in controlling the aircraft at large angles-of-attack and bringing it to a level flight condition. The aircraft has a fly-by-wire (FBW) with quadruple redundancy. Dependent on flight conditions, signals from the control stick <b>position</b> <b>transmitter</b> or the FCS may be coupled to remote control amplifiers and combined with feedback signals from acceleration sensors and rate gyros. The resultant control signals are coupled to the high-speed electro-hydraulic actuators of the elevators, rudders and the canard. The output signals are compared and, if the difference is significant, the faulty channel is disconnected. FBW {{is based on a}} stall warning and barrier mechanism which prevents stalls through dramatic increases of control stick pressure, allowing a pilot to effectively control the aircraft without exceeding the angle of attack and acceleration limitations. Although the maximum angle of attack is limited by the canards, the FBW acts as an additional safety mechanism.|$|E
30|$|The {{baseline}} configuration {{consists of a}} fixed position SDR transmitter and a rotating transmitter. The rotating node emits a pure sine wave continuously, thus it can be implemented using a simple, low-cost device, such as a WSN. The fixed <b>position</b> <b>transmitter</b> transmits a pure sine wave at a close frequency. Since multiple receivers need to make synchronized measurements, a time synchronization approach is necessary. Instead of implementing a time synchronization protocol on the SDR platform, we embed timing information in the transmitted signal itself. The SDR transmitter periodically emits a windowed chirp signal before a pure sine wave segment. That chirp can be accurately decoded on the receiver side {{and it makes a}} common time reference point for all receivers. The range of this short frequency sweep does not overlap with the frequencies of the pure sinusoids.|$|E

40|$|In broad terms, the {{objective}} of this thesis {{is to be able to}} measure and analyse pressure signals coming from different points of a turbine. For this purpose it is needed to read and control a signal, that travels from the turbine to a mechanical multiplexer, which can receive a maximum of 48 pressure inputs and even though it has only one output, it is able to rotate and vary the output pressure which enables the analysis of different pressures in 48 alternate locations of our analysed turbine. This pressure signal, coming from the multiplexor, is sent to the pressure scan which transforms the pressure from a mechanical input into an analogue signal between - 10 V and 10 V. The signal is then adapted by an amplifier and a filter so that the microcontroller can receive and read it. Then the microcontroller generates a digital signal that will be afterwards read by an external PC via RS 232 serial port using LabView to analyse the pressure signals. On the other hand, the multiplexor can rotate by two different means. The first one is just by pushing manually two switches called “manual step” (increase one position) and “manual home” (come back to 48, also called 0 or Home position) located at the optocoupler board. The other way is by sending the order, of step and home, from LabView to the microcontroller through the RS 232 interface. Apart from this, we were also committed to find out the functionality of some cables which are coming from the <b>position</b> <b>transmitter</b> (belongs to the multiplexor) that are currently unconnected and study how to know exactly when the multiplexor is in home position.

40|$|Abstract — In recent years, UWB has {{received}} much attention as a suitable Physical Layer (PHY) for Wireless Personal Area Networks (WPANS). UWB allows for low cost, low power, high bandwidth, short reach communication {{well suited for}} personal operating spaces. One of the key features offered by UWB is very accurate ranging between a transmitter/receiver pair. The IEEE 802. 15. 3 is a MAC protocol that has been proposed for WPANs. In this MAC, a combination of CSMA/CA and TDMA is used to achieve channel scheduling. The TDMA component ensures only one transmitter/receiver pair within a piconet is active {{at any given time}} thereby ensuring an exclusion region that covers the whole piconet. In this paper, we propose a less stringent scheduling mechanism that allows for concurrent communication between UWB transmitter/receiver pairs within a piconet. Exclusion is necessary only when the communicating entities are close enough such that interference between them would adversely affect successful reception of data at the receivers. The Piconet Coordinator (PNC) uses the ranging information provided by UWB to accurately <b>position</b> <b>transmitters</b> and receivers. The PNC schedules parallel transmissions between distinct transmit/receive pairs {{as long as they do}} not interfere.
