50|$|Many jurisdictions have {{different}} taxing schemes for <b>potables</b> based upon <b>alcohol</b> content. Since barley wine {{has a high}} alcohol content, it is, in some jurisdictions, taxed {{at a higher rate}} than other beers. Thus, barley wines tend to suffer a further price premium as compared to other beers. Similarly, many jurisdictions {{have different}} regulations regarding where beers and wines can be sold, leading to confusion regarding in which category barley wines fall and therefore limiting access.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Thermally dried {{thermophilic}} K. marxianus {{has proved}} to be an effective starter culture for whey fermentation. Convective drying of K. marxianus can be performed effectively in the range 35 - 60 o C. The best drying temperature for is considered 35 o C since it is the most cost effective without any substantial difference in kinetic parameters when compared with higher temperatures. The impact of thermally dried starter culture of K. marxianus is high, since several products could be produced from whey, such as <b>potable</b> and fuel-grade <b>alcohol,</b> baker’s yeast, SCP to feed animals and a Kefir drink-type. Furthermore, the economical impact of thermally dried starter culture production is essential, since it may lead small dairy enterprises to treat their own whey by producing added value products and protecting the environment from this much polluted liquid. GC-MS analysis of fermented whey indicates that it contains volatiles similar to traditional drinks produced from vegeta-ble raw materials...|$|R
50|$|Later, a {{small amount}} of Croton oil was added to the neutral grain spirits which powered U.S. torpedoes. Drinking alcohol with the oil {{additive}} caused painful cramps, internal bleeding and a violent emptying of the bowels. It was intended as a replacement for methanol which had caused blindness in some sailors. To avoid the Croton oil, sailors devised crude stills to slowly separate the alcohol from the poison, as alcohol evaporated at a lower temperature than Croton oil. The stills were sometimes called 'Gilly' stills, and the resulting <b>potable</b> <b>alcohol</b> was known as 'gilly'.|$|E

40|$|The wine {{equalisation}} tax (WET), {{introduced by the}} A New Tax System (Wine Equalisation Tax) Act 1999 (Cth), is, in essence, a wholesale sales tax on certain wine containing a specified content of <b>potable</b> <b>alcohol</b> that is sold for consumption in Australia. The apparent fiscal purpose of the Act is to reduce and recoup the public costs of alcohol abuse. The hallmarks of sound tax legislation are traditionally encapsulated in the tax policy principles of simplicity, equity, economic efficiency and fiscal adequacy. This article explores {{the extent to which}} these hallmarks are reflected in the rules of the Act. The authors conclude that the WET is not a "good tax" in light of any of the principles, and its deficiencies raise the threshold issue of whether alcohol taxation is an appropriate way to address the public costs of alcohol abuse. In the authors' opinion, there is no valid argument for its retention...|$|E
40|$|Sorghum and millets are the {{important}} food and fodder crops predominantly in semi-arid regionsaregaining importance in a woridthat is increasingly becoming populous, malnourished and facing large climatic uncertainties. These crops are adapted to range of temperatures, moisture- regimes and input conditions supplying {{food and feed}} to millions of dryland farmers, particularly in the developing world. Besides they also form important raw material for <b>potable</b> <b>alcohol</b> and starch production in industrialized countries. Among these crops, sorghum is the world's fifth most important cereal, {{in terms of both}} production and area planted. Millet, a general category for several species of small-grained cereal crops, is the world's seventh most important cereal grain (FAO, 1995). Roughly 90 percent of the world's sorghum area and 95 percent of the world's millet area lie in the developing countries, mainly in Africa and Asia (Table 1). These crops are primarily grown in agro-ecologies subjected to low rainfall and drought. Most such areas are unsuitable for the production of other grains unless irrigation is available. Sorghum is widely grown both for food and as a feed grain, while millet is produced almost entirely for food. These crops are also moving to new niches like rice-fallow sorghums in India [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Sorghum is {{a unique}} crop {{produced}} for domestic and export markets with multiple uses as food, feed, fodder, fuel and fi ber grown globally. The sorghum grain is the major ingredient in cattle feed, poultry and swine around the globe. Stover is an important fodder source for both milch and draft animals in mixed crop-livestock systems. Sorghum provides raw material to many industrial uses like <b>potable</b> <b>alcohol,</b> transport grade ethanol malt, beer, liquids, gruels, starch, adhesives, core binders for metal casting, ore refi ning and grits as packaging material. Spatial distribution shows that it is grown on 40. 5 M ha in 98 countries of Africa, Asia, Oceania and the Americas. Nigeria, India, the USA, Mexico, Sudan, China and Argentina are the major producers of sorghum. The crop is adapted {{to a wide range}} of temperatures, including high elevations in East Africa. In South Asia, where adoption rates are high, the most signifi cant adoption constraints are specifi c varietal traits (e. g., disease resistance, duration, yield, stover quality). In Africa, where adoption rates are lower, the most signifi cant adoption constraints are access to seed and information, bird damage (associated with early-maturing varieties) and poor soil fertility/lack of fertilizer. Recent global trends also show that both grain yield and production increased refl ecting increase in use of improved varieties, increased demand due to population growth and higher world prices for major cereals. The area under sorghum is increasing gradually in West and Central Africa (WCA) while in other regions it’s area is showing a declining trend over last few decades. In general, the grain is grown in more economically advanced countries for feed purpose and in less developed countries for food purpose. According to IFPRI models, the future scenario indicates that demand for cereals is to increase by 40...|$|E

A yeast co-product (yeast protein concentrate unrefined (YPCU)) {{obtained from a}} bio-ethanol process using wheat was tested using iso-nitrogenous (38 % crude protein) and iso-lipidic (8 %) diets for juvenile mirror carp (Cyprinus carpio). The fishmeal (FM) protein component of a basal diet was replaced by (YPCU) at 7. 5, 15, 20, and 50 % of total dietary protein. After an 8 week feeding trial, all fish fed YPCU yielded better growth performance than the control fed fish, with diets containing 15 % and 20 % YPCU being optimal. Whole body composition was unaffected by dietary treatment, however, ash levels were elevated in fish fed > 15 % YPCU. Hepatic alanine amino transferase (ALAT) and aspartate amino transferase (ASAT) were measured as bio-indicators of liver function in carp. Only ASAT activity was significantly lower for carp fed 20 % and 50 % YPCU. Additionally, histological assessment of liver and intestinal tissues gave no indication of impairment, but high YPCU inclusion (> 15 %) elevated the number of goblet cells present in the posterior intestine. Molecular microbiological analysis using DGGE revealed no definitive changes in intestinal microbial communities. In a second study, bio-ethanol yeast (refined YPCR and unrefined YPCU) and dried distillers grain with solubles (DDGS) a co-product of the bio-fuel process and distillery yeast from <b>potable</b> <b>alcohol</b> (whisky) production (YPCPA) were evaluated as before for carp. FM was replaced with 30 % of YPCU, YPCR and YPCPA and 15, or 30 % DDGS {{with a combination of}} 10 % YPCR. Weight gain, and Apparent Net Protein Utilization (ANPU%) were higher in fish fed YPCU 30 %, equivalent for fish fed FM, YPCR 30 %,DDGS 15 % and DDGS 30 %, and lower in fish fed YPCPA 30 % diets. Feed conversion ratio was significantly increased in carp fed YPCU 30 % and decreased for carp fed DDGS 30 % and YPC PA 30 % compared with the control group. A significant improvement of net mineral retention was seen for carp feed the yeast supplementation diets compared to the fishmeal control group. The YPCU 30 % diet produced the highest mineral retention in fish fed yeasts and the YPCPA 30 % gave lowest retention. The microvilli density of the intestinal tract decreased for carp fed YPCR 30 %, but microvilli length significantly increased in fish fed YPCU 30 % compared with other groups, thus indicating changes in gut integrity. In the third study, four diets were formulated to replace 0, 10, 20 and 30 % of the fishmeal with refined yeast protein concentrate (YPCR) for Nile tilapia (O. niloticus) of mean weight 12. 39 g. Growth performance and feed efficiency were not affected with up to 20 % replacement with YPCR. There were no obvious changes in the liver structure, but high yeast inclusion showed higher numbers of intestinal goblet cells with increasing YPCR dietary inclusion suggesting enhanced intestinal integrity. Microvilli density and length was significantly (P = 0. 025) improved with up to 10 % and 30 % YPCR inclusion in comparison to other dietary treatments. It was generally concluded that YPC co-products were effectively viable for both juvenile carp and tilapia offering an option for partial fish meal replacement.
