This <b>proton</b> <b>motive</b> <b>force</b> then drives ATP synthesis. The electrons needed to drive this electron transport chain come from light-gathering proteins called photosynthetic reaction centres or rhodopsins.

5|$|At {{the base}} of the {{bacterial}} flagellum, where it enters the cell membrane, a motor protein acts as a rotary engine. The engine is powered by <b>proton</b> <b>motive</b> <b>force,</b> i.e. by the flow of protons (hydrogen ions) across the bacterial cell membrane due to a concentration gradient set up by the cell's metabolism. (In species of the genus Vibrio, {{there are two kinds of}} flagella, lateral and polar, and some are driven by a sodium ion pump rather than a proton pump.) Flagella are quite efficient, allowing bacteria to move at speeds of up to 60cell lengths per second. The rotary motor at {{the base of}} the flagellum is similar in structure to ATP synthase. Spirillum bacteria have helical bodies with flagella at either end, and they spin about the central axis of their bodies as they move through the water.|$|E

40|$|Lactic acid {{bacteria}} are industrially important microorganisms recognized for their fermentative ability mostly in their probiotic benefits {{as well as}} lactic acid production for various applications. Nevertheless, lactic acid fermentation often suffers end-product inhibition which decreases the cell growth rate. The inhibition of lactic acid {{is due to the}} solubility of the undissociated lactic acid within the cytoplasmic membrane and insolubility of dissociated lactate, which causes acidification of cytoplasm and failure of <b>proton</b> <b>motive</b> <b>forces.</b> This phenomenon influences the transmembrane pH gradient and decreases the amount of energy available for cell growth. In general, the restriction imposed by lactic acid on its fermentation can be avoided by extractive fermentation techniques, which can also be exploited for product recovery...|$|R

5000|$|The {{translocase}} itself comprises 7 proteins, {{including a}} chaperone protein (SecB), an ATPase (SecA), an integral membrane complex (SecCY, SecE and SecG), and two additional membrane proteins that promote {{the release of}} the mature peptide into the periplasm (SecD and SecF). The chaperone protein SecB [...] is a highly acidic homotetrameric protein that exists as a [...] "dimer of dimers" [...] in the bacterial cytoplasm. SecB maintains preproteins in an unfolded state after translation, and targets these to the peripheral membrane protein ATPase SecA for secretion. Together with SecY and SecG, SecE forms a multimeric channel through which preproteins are translocated, using both <b>proton</b> <b>motive</b> <b>forces</b> and ATP-driven secretion. The latter is mediated by SecA. The structure of the Escherichia coli SecYEG assembly revealed a sandwich of two membranes interacting through the extensive cytoplasmic domains. Each membrane is composed of dimers of SecYEG. The monomeric complex contains 15 transmembrane helices.|$|R
25|$|Because {{no energy}} is {{directly}} {{available to the}} outer membrane, the energy to drive the transport of ferric-enterobactin by FepA originates from the <b>proton</b> <b>motive</b> <b>force</b> (electrochemical gradient) generated by the inner membrane complex TonB–ExbB–ExbD.

30|$|The {{results from}} the present study (Table  1) are similar to the {{findings}} of Monteagudo et al. (1997), who reported that there was an inhibition on bacterial growth by lactic acid when the lactic acid was rapidly being produced after the exponential phase of the growth. Reduced in final viable cell concentration of P. acidilactici was associated with high lactic acid concentration in the culture. This was due to the acidification of cytoplasm and failure of <b>proton</b> <b>motive</b> <b>forces</b> (Wee et al. 2006). The acidification of cytoplasm is causes by the undissociated lactic acid that passes through the bacterial membrane and dissociates inside the cell. The undissociated lactic acid is soluble within the cytoplasmic membrane whilst the dissociated lactate is insoluble. Eventually, this affects the transmembrane pH gradient and reduces the amount of energy that may be used for cell growth. Since lactic acid produced from fermentation causes acidification of medium and cytoplasm which inhibits the bacterial growth, therefore lactic acid produced in the culture must be either neutralized or removed as it is formed {{in order to maintain the}} pH within the optimal range (pH 5 – 7) (Nomura et al. 1987; Roberto et al. 2007).|$|R
40|$|Vibrio parahaemolyticus {{possesses}} {{two types}} of flagella, polar and lateral, powered by distinct energy sources, which are derived from the sodium and <b>proton</b> <b>motive</b> <b>forces,</b> respectively. Although proton-powered flagella in Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium have been extensively studied, the mechanism of torque generation is still not understood. Molecular knowledge {{of the structure of}} the sodium-driven motor is only now being developed. In this work, we identify the switch components, FliG, FliM, and FliN, of the sodium-type motor. This brings the total number of genes identified as pertinent to polar motor function to seven. Both FliM and FliN possess charged domains not found in proton-type homologs; however, they can interact with the proton-type motor of E. coli to a limited extent. Residues known to be critical for torque generation in the proton-type motor are conserved in the sodium-type motor, suggesting a common mechanism for energy transfer at the rotor-stator interface regardless of the driving force powering rotation. Mutants representing a complete panel of insertionally inactivated switch and motor genes were constructed. All of these mutants were defective in sodium-driven swimming motility. Alkaline phosphatase could be fused to the C termini of MotB and MotY without abolishing motility, whereas deletion of the unusual, highly charged C-terminal domain of FliM disrupted motor function. All of the mutants retained proton-driven, lateral motility over surfaces. Thus, although central chemotaxis genes are shared by the polar and lateral systems, genes encoding the switch components, as well as the motor genes, are distinct for each motility system...|$|R

25|$|The plasma {{membrane}} or bacterial cytoplasmic membrane {{is composed of}} a phospholipid bilayer and thus has all of the general functions of a cell membrane such as acting as a permeability barrier for most molecules and serving as the location for the transport of molecules into the cell. In addition to these functions, prokaryotic membranes also function in energy conservation as the location about which a <b>proton</b> <b>motive</b> <b>force</b> is generated. Unlike eukaryotes, bacterial membranes (with some exceptions e.g. Mycoplasma and methanotrophs) generally do not contain sterols. However, many microbes do contain structurally related compounds called hopanoids which likely fulfill the same function. Unlike eukaryotes, bacteria can have {{a wide variety of}} fatty acids within their membranes. Along with typical saturated and unsaturated fatty acids, bacteria can contain fatty acids with additional methyl, hydroxy or even cyclic groups. The relative proportions of these fatty acids can be modulated by the bacterium to maintain the optimum fluidity of the membrane (e.g. following temperature change).|$|E
25|$|The {{molecular}} {{mechanism of}} ATP (Adenosine triphosphate) generation in chloroplasts {{is similar to}} that in mitochondria and takes the required energy from the <b>proton</b> <b>motive</b> <b>force</b> (PMF). However, chloroplasts rely more on the chemical potential of the PMF to generate the potential energy required for ATP synthesis. The PMF is the sum of a proton chemical potential (given by the proton concentration gradient) and a transmembrane electrical potential (given by charge separation across the membrane). Compared to the inner membranes of mitochondria, which have a significantly higher membrane potential due to charge separation, thylakoid membranes lack a charge gradient. To compensate for this, the 10,000 fold proton concentration gradient across the thylakoid membrane is much higher compared to a 10 fold gradient across the inner membrane of mitochondria. The resulting chemiosmotic potential between the lumen and stroma is high enough to drive ATP synthesis using the ATP synthase. As the protons travel back down the gradient through channels in ATP synthase, ADP + Pi are combined into ATP. In this manner, the light-dependent reactions are coupled to the synthesis of ATP via the proton gradient.|$|E

40|$|Many {{antidepressants}} are cationic amphipaths, which spontaneously {{accumulate in}} natural or reconstituted membranes {{in the absence}} of their specific protein targets. However, the clinical relevance of cellular membrane accumulation by antidepressants in the human brain is unknown and hotly debated. Here we take a novel, evolutionarily informed approach to studying the effects of the selective-serotonin reuptake inhibitor sertraline/Zoloft® on cell physiology in the model eukaryote Saccharomyces cerevisiae (budding yeast), which lacks a serotonin transporter entirely. We biochemically and pharmacologically characterized cellular uptake and subcellular distribution of radiolabeled sertraline, and in parallel performed a quantitative ultrastructural analysis of organellar membrane homeostasis in untreated vs. sertraline-treated cells. These experiments have revealed that sertraline enters yeast cells and then reshapes vesiculogenic membranes by a complex process. Internalization of the neutral species proceeds by simple diffusion, is accelerated by <b>proton</b> <b>motive</b> <b>forces</b> generated by the vacuolar H(+) -ATPase, but is counteracted by energy-dependent xenobiotic efflux pumps. At equilibrium, a small fraction (10 - 15 %) of reprotonated sertraline is soluble while the bulk (90 - 85 %) partitions into organellar membranes by adsorption to interfacial anionic sites or by intercalation into the hydrophobic phase of the bilayer. Asymmetric accumulation of sertraline in vesiculogenic membranes leads to local membrane curvature stresses that trigger an adaptive autophagic response. In mutants with altered clathrin function, this adaptive response is associated with increased lipid droplet formation. Our data not only support the notion of a serotonin transporter-independent component of antidepressant function, but also enable a conceptual framework for characterizing the physiological states associated with chronic but not acute antidepressant administration in a model eukaryote...|$|R

Batch cultures of strain H 18 which were fermenting glucose did not utilize succinate, and glucose-limited continuous cultures were {{only able to}} decarboxylate significant amounts of succinate at slow (less than 0. 1 h- 1) dilution rates. Strain H 18 grew more slowly on lactate than glucose (0. 2 versus 0. 4 h- 1, respectively), {{and more than half}} of the lactate was initially converted to succinate. Succinate was only utilized after growth on lactate had ceased. Although nonenergized and glucose-energized cells had similar <b>proton</b> <b>motive</b> <b>forces</b> and ATP levels, glucose-energized cells were unable to transport succinate. Transport by nonenergized cells was decreased by small increases in osmotic strength, and it is possible that energy-dependent inhibition of succinate transport was related to changes in cell turgor. Since cells which were deenergized with 2 -deoxyglucose or iodoacetate did not transport succinate, it appeared that glycogen metabolism was providing the driving force for succinate uptake. An artificial delta pH drove succinate transport in deenergized cells, but an artificial membrane potential (delta psi) could not serve as a driving force. Because succinate is nearly fully dissociated at pH 7. 0 and the transport process was electroneutral, it appeared that succinate was taken up in symport with two protons. An Eadie-Hofstee plot indicated that the rate of uptake was unusually rapid at high substrate concentrations, but the low-velocity, high-affinity component could account for succinate utilization by stationary cultures.

Alkaliphilic bacteria that grow optimally at high pH values use Na(+) for solute uptake and flagellar rotation because the <b>proton</b> (H(+)) <b>motive</b> <b>force</b> is insufficient for use at extremely alkaline pH. Only three types of electrically driven rotary motors exist in nature: the F-type ATPase, the V-type ATPase, and the bacterial flagellar motor. Until now, only H(+) and Na(+) have been reported as coupling ions for these motors. Here, we report that the alkaliphilic bacterium Bacillus alcalophilus Vedder 1934 can grow not only under a Na(+) -rich and potassium ion (K(+)) -poor condition but also under the opposite condition in an extremely alkaline environment. In this organism, swimming performance depends on concentrations of Na(+), K(+) or Rb(+). In the absence of Na(+), swimming behavior is clearly K(+) - dependent. This pattern was confirmed in swimming assays of stator-less Bacillus subtilis and Escherichia coli mutants expressing MotPS from B. alcalophilus (BA-MotPS).

Our results suggested a role of NhaS 3 in the maintenance of ion homeostasis of H+, Na+, and K+ in supporting the conversion of photosynthetic products and in the supply of energy in the dark...|$|R
40|$|At {{the start}} of this study, two peptide {{transport}} activities were known in L. lactis: one for the transport of oligopeptides and one for translocation of di- and tripeptides. Further analysis revealed that these two transport activities were distinct in their biochemical properties (this study; Kunji et al., 1993). Oligopeptides of four upto at least twelve amino acid residues were transported in an ATP-dependent manner by an oligopeptide permease (Opp), while translocation of di- and tripeptides were ascribed to a <b>proton</b> <b>motive</b> force-driven peptide transport system (DtpT). In this thesis, the molecular properties of the <b>proton</b> <b>motive</b> force-driven peptide transport system DtpT are described. Zie: Summary and concluding remarks...|$|R
