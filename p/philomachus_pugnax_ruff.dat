40|$|By next {{generation}} transcriptome sequencing, {{it is possible}} to obtain data on both nucleotide sequence variation and gene expression. We have used this approach (RNA-Seq) to investigate the genetic basis for differences in plumage coloration and mating strategies in a non-model bird species, the ruff (<b>Philomachus</b> <b>pugnax).</b> <b>Ruff</b> males show enormous variation in the coloration of ornamental feathers, used for individual recognition. This polymorphism is linked to reproductive strategies, with dark males (Independents) defending territories on leks against other Independents, whereas white morphs (Satellites) co-occupy Independent's courts without agonistic interactions. Previous work found a strong genetic component for mating strategy, but the genes involved were not identified. We present feather transcriptome data of more than 6, 000 de-novo sequenced ruff genes (although with limited coverage for many of them). None of the identified genes showed significant expression divergence between males, but many genetic markers showed nucleotide differentiation between different color morphs and mating strategies. These include several feather keratin genes, splicing factors, and the Xg blood-group gene. Many of the genes with significant genetic structure between mating strategies have not yet been annotated and their functions remain to be elucidated. We also conducted in-depth investigations of 28 pre-identified coloration candidate genes. Two of these (EDNRB and TYR) were specifically expressed in black- and rust-colored males, respectively. We have demonstrated the utility of {{next generation}} transcriptome sequencing for identifying and genotyping large number of genetic markers in a non-model species without previous genomic resources, and highlight the potential of this approach for addressing the genetic basis of ecologically important variation...|$|E
40|$|Variation in {{reproductive}} behavior permits individuals to optimize fitness given their genetics, physiological condition, social status, age and current environmental conditions. For species with alternative reproductive strategies, behavioral differences {{are driven by}} natural and sexual selection and further mediated by the endocrine system. In this study, I explore endocrinological mechanisms associated with alternative reproductive strategies in the <b>ruff</b> (<b>Philomachus</b> <b>pugnax).</b> <b>Ruffs</b> breed on leks, where males use one of three genetically determined alternative reproductive strategies or phenotypes. Resident males rely on male-male aggression, colorful plumage, large body size and intensive display activity to establish courts on a lek and attract females. Satellite males operate outside the dominance hierarchy of the lek, relying on semi-cooperative displays with residents, lighter display plumage coloration and agility to access receptive females. Males using the third male strategy, considered 'sneakers' or 'female mimics', completely forgo typical male breeding plumage, territoriality and obvious display behaviors to obtain clandestine access to females. The differences in level of aggression and display behaviors among phenotypes suggest predictable differences in steroid hormone concentrations, which {{play a critical role}} in breeding behavior in birds. I therefore examined seasonal hormone profiles of male ruffs and applied predictions from the challenge hypothesis, which posits circulating androgen concentration will vary in relation to intensity of male-male competition during the breeding season. Consistent with the challenge hypothesis, androgen levels were higher during periods of lek instability in territorial resident ruffs. In contrast, when housed in large flocks, androstenedione was elevated during the breeding season in satellite ruffs and followed the pattern typically observed for testosterone in polygamous birds. In response to distinctly different seasonal androgen and androstenedione profiles, I further examined the activational role of androstenedione on satellite male breeding behavior. Androstenedione stimulated both resident and satellite typical behaviors consistent with genetic morph, and thus did not specifically activate the satellite phenotype...|$|R
40|$|Determining the {{molecular}} mechanisms underlying variation in morphology, physiology and behaviour {{is a prime}} focus {{in the field of}} evolutionary genetics. This thesis investigates {{the molecular}} genetics of the unusual alternative male reproductive morphs of a shorebird, the <b>ruff</b> (<b>Philomachus</b> <b>pugnax).</b> <b>Ruffs</b> possess three distinct alternative reproductive morphs: i) territorial dark-plumed ‘Independents’, ii) non-territorial white-plumed ‘Satellites’, and iii) small unplumed female-like males called ‘Faeders’. Independent and satellite morph development is determined by an autosomal genetic polymorphism at the Satellite locus, and a dominant autosomal allele of unknown location also controls development of the female-mimicking faeders. To investigate the molecular genetics of alternative reproductive morphs in this non-model organism, I used several analytical approaches and molecular techniques, including: developing two microsatellite libraries and characterizing microsatellite markers, constructing a first-generation linkage map of the ruff genome, attempting to specifically map behavioural and plumage loci on this map, and sequencing the melanocortin- 1 receptor (Mc 1 r) gene to investigate its role in plumage polymorphism. I characterize 102 microsatellite markers from the ruff and present 7 linkage groups and 5 single marker loci homologous to chicken and zebra finch chromosomes. Through linkage analysis, I identified the chromosomal location of Faeder, the locus that controls development of the female mimic morph and find it to be unlinked to the Satellite locus. This preliminary data appear to support a two-locus epistatic model of male morph determination, although further studies are needed to confirm this finding. I demonstrated that sequence variation in the coding region of Mc 1 r is not solely responsible for the dark and white plumage polymorphism in ruffs, and that other melanin–based colouration, regulatory, or structural genes likely contribute to the plumage polymorphism observed in this species. One non-synonymous SNP, His 207 Arg, located in the transmembrane region of Mc 1 r, may be under selection, with the possibility of a lethal in ruffs maintained by overdominance, or else gene duplication. This thesis broadens and brings together previous areas of research in the ruff and sets the stage for further genomic work addressing questions of evolutionary interest in this enigmatic shorebird...|$|R
40|$|The {{adaptive}} {{significance of}} polyandry by female {{birds in the}} absence of direct benefits remains unclear. We determined the frequencies of polyandrous mating and multiple paternity in the ruff, a lekking shorebird with a genetic dimorphism in male mating behavior. More than half of female ruffs mate with, and have clutches fertilized by, more than one male. Individual females mate with males of both behavioral morphs more often than expected. Polyandrous mating was more likely following copulation interference, but interference was uncommon. The multiple paternity rate of ruffs is the highest known for avian lekking species and for shorebirds. The general hypothesis that pair-bond constraints are the major selective factor favoring multiple mating in birds does not predict our findings. Active genetic diversification, which has been widely dismissed as a functional explanation for polyandrous mating in birds, may apply with respect to the behavioral polymorphism in ruffs because of a Mendelian genetic basis for male behavioral morph determination and aspects of male–male cooperation and female choice. However, rates of multiple paternity in other species of lekking birds are higher than generally realized, and the potential benefits of diversification in general deserve further consideration.

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown that preen wax {{composition}} in some sandpipers shifts from the usual monoesters to diesters during the breeding season, possibly to reduce the ability of mammalian predators to find nests using olfactory cues. To investigate further the relationship between incubation and wax secretion, we examined seven sandpiper species with different incubation patterns (species in which both sexes incubate, in which only males incubate and in which only females incubate). During the breeding period, diester preen wax was secreted almost exclusively by the incubating sex in species with uniparental incubation, and by both sexes in species with biparental incubation. These findings suggest that diester preen waxes have a function that is directly related to incubation. Unexpectedly, in female-incubating Curlew Sandpiper Calidris ferruginea and Buff-breasted Sandpiper Tryngites subruficollis, some males also secreted diester preen waxes during the breeding period. This suggests that some males may in fact incubate, that these waxes may be a remnant from their evolutionary past when both sexes incubated, or that males need to be olfactorally cryptic because they are involved in the making of nest scrapes. The seasonal pattern of preen wax composition was also studied in captive male, female and female-mimicking male (`faeder¿) <b>Ruff</b> <b>Philomachus</b> <b>pugnax.</b> Captive female <b>Ruff</b> changed preen wax composition from monoesters to diesters in the spring despite the fact that no incubation took place.

50|$|Their {{reproductive}} {{strategy is}} of interest, as {{both males and}} females are unusual among animals. Males are polymorphic and exist in 3 forms, α, β, and γ of different sizes. Of the three, α males are the largest and most dominant; they mate with multiple females in a harem. The β males mimic the females and therefore manage to mate with some of the females in an α male's harem. The γ form is much smaller and mimics the juvenile form, also allowing it to escape detection. Relatively speaking, the γ males invest the most energy in their testes, followed by the β males and the α males. Other species in which alternative reproductive strategies caused by a genetic polymorphism occur are the swordtail (Xiphophorus nigrensis), the tree lizard (Urosaurus ornatus), the <b>ruff</b> (<b>Philomachus</b> <b>pugnax)</b> and the side-blotched lizard (Uta stansburiana).|$|R

40|$|Maintaining polymorphisms for genes with {{effects of}} {{ecological}} significance may involve conflicting selection in males and females. We present {{data from a}} captive population of <b>ruffs</b> (<b>Philomachus</b> <b>pugnax)</b> showing that a dominant allele controls development into both small, ‘female mimic’ males (‘faeders’), and a previously undescribed class of small ‘female faeders’. Most male ruffs have elaborate breeding plumage and display behaviour, but 0. 5 – 1. 5 % are faeders, which lack both. Females from a captive population previously lacking faeders were bred with two founder faeder males and their faeder sons. The faeders’ offspring had a quadrimodal size distribution comprising normal-sized males and females, faeders and atypically small females. By contrast, ornamented males fathered only normal-sized offspring. We conclude that both founding faeders were heterozygous for a faeder allele absent from the original population. This allele is dominant to previously described genes that determine development into independent versus satellite ornamented males.

The persistence of identifiable annual cycles {{enabled us to}} study variability in two blood parameters, one a measure of {{red blood cell count}} (hematocrit) and the other an index of white blood cell (WBC) abundance (percentage). In both species hematocrit values averaged 0. 43, somewhat lower than those measured in free-living red knots. Hematocrit varied little with time of year and we were unable to convincingly confirm predicted elevated hematocrit levels during periods of storage of fat for migration. In both species the percentage of WBCs (percent WBCs) initially declined from 0. 6 to 0. 8 %; levels stabilized at 0. 4 % in ruffs and 0. 3 % in red knots after half a year in captivity. Using observations of the same individual red knots in the years before and after the experimental year as controls, biweekly extraction of about 30 % of blood volume did not negatively affect seasonal changes in body mass and moult and breeding-plumage cycles. In nutritionally stressed red knots, hematocrit levels were low, and in these birds only, the small wounds inflicted by bleeding healed with difficulty. ...|$|R
40|$|To {{contribute}} {{to an understanding of}} the evolutionary processes that shape variation in immune responses, we compared several components of the innate and acquired arms of the immune system in five related, but ecologically diverse, migratory shorebirds (<b>ruff</b> <b>Philomachus</b> <b>pugnax</b> L., ruddy turnstone Arenaria interpres L., bar-tailed godwit Limosa lapponica L., sanderling Calidris alba Pallas and red knot C. canutus L.). We used a hemolysis–hemagglutination assay in free-living shorebirds to assess two of the innate components (natural antibodies and complement-mediated lysis), and a modified quantitative enzyme–linked immunosorbent assay in birds held in captivity to assess the acquired component (humoral antibodies against tetanus and diphtheria toxoid) of immunity. Ruddy turnstones showed the highest levels of both innate and acquired immune responses. We suggest that turnstones could have evolved strong immune responses because they scavenge among rotting organic material on the seashore, where they might be exposed to a particularly broad range of pathogens. Although ruffs stand out among shorebirds in having a high prevalence of avian malaria, they do not exhibit higher immune response levels. Our results indicate that relationships between immune response and infection are not likely to follow a broad general pattern, but instead depend on type of parasite exposure, among other factors. ...|$|R
40|$|Sequence {{variation}} in the melanocortin- 1 receptor (MC 1 R) gene explains color morph {{variation in}} several species of birds and mammals. <b>Ruffs</b> (<b>Philomachus</b> <b>pugnax)</b> exhibit major dark/light color differences in melanin-based male breeding plumage which is closely associated with alternative reproductive behavior. A previous study identified a microsatellite marker (Ppu 020) near the MC 1 R locus associated with the presence/absence of ornamental plumage. We investigated whether coding sequence {{variation in the}} MC 1 R gene explains major dark/light plumage color variation and/or the presence/absence of ornamental plumage in ruffs. Among 821 bp of the MC 1 R coding region from 44 male ruffs we found 3 single nucleotide polymorphisms, representing 1 nonsynonymous and 2 synonymous amino acid substitutions. None were associated with major dark/light color differences or the presence/absence of ornamental plumage. At all amino acid sites known to be functionally important in other avian species with dark/light plumage color variation, ruffs were either monomorphic or the shared polymorphism did not coincide with color morph. Neither ornamental plumage color differences nor the presence/absence of ornamental plumage in ruffs {{are likely to be}} caused entirely by amino acid variation within the coding regions of the MC 1 R locus. Regulatory elements and structural variation at other loci may be involved in melanin expression and contribute to the extreme plumage polymorphism observed in this species...|$|R
40|$|Aim: Over {{the last}} two decades, {{thousands}} of northward migrating <b>ruffs</b> (<b>Philomachus</b> <b>pugnax)</b> have disappeared from western European staging sites. These migratory ruffs were partly temperate breeding birds, but most individuals head towards the Eurasian Arctic tundras where 95 % of the global population breeds. This regional decline may represent either: (1) local loss of breeding birds in western Europe, (2) a global decline, (3) shift(s) in distribution or (4) a combination of these. Location: Northern Eurasia. Methods: To put the declines in western Europe in context, we analysed Arctic monitoring data from {{the last two}} decades to detect changes in regional breeding densities across northern Eurasia. We used a novel approach applying generalized additive modelling (GAM) and generalized estimations equations (GEE). Results: We show that the global breeding population of ruffs has made a significant eastwards shift into the Asian part of the breeding range. In the European Arctic, ruffs decreased during the last 18 years. At the same time, in western Siberia, ruffs increased. In eastern Siberia, no significant population changes could be detected. These changes corroborate the finding that during northward migration, growing numbers of ruffs avoided staging areas in the Netherlands and Sweden and started migrating along a more easterly route leading into western Siberia. Main conclusions: We detected an unprecedented large-scale population redistribution of ruffs and suggest that this is a response to loss of habitat quality at the traditional staging site in the Netherlands. ...|$|R
40|$|Among the sandpiper family Scolopacidae, the <b>Ruff</b> <b>Philomachus</b> <b>pugnax</b> {{combines}} a large seasonal {{change in the}} appearance of the plumage with a very pronounced sexual plumage dimorphism. Studies on the east and south African wintering grounds of Ruffs indicate that before northward migration at least the males moult (part of their basic (winter) plumage into a kind of alternative plumage. We studied the details of the subsequent moult into a final (supplemental) breeding plumage by quantifying the presence of three feather types - (1) winter (basic), (2) striped (alternate) and (3) breeding (supplemental) - in breast feather samples of 1441 Ruffs captured on staging areas in The Netherlands during northward migration in 1993 - 97. Ruffs arriving in March show a mix of winter and striped feathers. In April, the 'breeding feather' type appears in both male and female Ruffs, and partially takes the place of winter feathers as well as striped feathers in males, and winter feathers only in females. The presence of three plumages in Ruffs is thus confirmed for males, but also occurs in female Ruffs and in Bar-tailed Godwits Limosa lapponica. We suggest that striped feathers represent the 'original' alternative plumage feather type of the sandpiper family and that the showy feathers of the, in the European literature fortuitously appropriately named, 'supplementary plumage' represent an additional feather generation. Such colourful nuptial plumages could thus be derived characters that have evolved independently in several scolopacid genera, presumably under particularly strong sexual selection pressures...|$|R
40|$|Then, {{early in}} 2012, {{unprecedented}} numbers were recorded at two coastal sites. On 30 January Mark and Alison Muller counted 25 birds on salt pans {{north of the}} Wami River {{on the edge of}} Saadani NP. Then on 5 February at least 28 birds were found on the salt pans north of Bagamoyo, the site that held the single bird in January 2005. The first six birds were found feeding, not by moving in tight circles but simply swimming and rapidly inserting their bills just {{below the surface of the}} flooded pans. Minutes later successive groups of three, two and four birds were noted resting along the banks of adjacent pans. Within 30 minutes a larger flock of 13 birds was found, two feeding in a similar manner to the first group, the others resting on exposed substrate. A small flock of Marsh Sandpipers Tringa stagnatalis and a single <b>Ruff</b> <b>Philomachus</b> <b>pugnax</b> were observed feeding in the same manner as the phalaropes among a larger flock of Black-winged Stilts Himantopus himantopus. The stilts were also catching prey just below the surface but were tall enough to wade in the shallow water. All 28 phalaropes were still present on 11 March. These phalaropes were presumably from the wintering population known to occur well offshore in the northwest Indian Ocean (Cramp 1983). Their unprecedented numbers suggest either weather or food related movements of this population away from their traditional wintering grounds...|$|R
40|$|Background <b>Ruffs</b> (Aves: <b>Philomachus</b> <b>pugnax)</b> {{possess a}} genetic {{polymorphism}} for male mating behaviour resulting in three permanent alternative male reproductive morphs: (i) territorial ‘Independents’, (ii) non-territorial ‘Satellites’, and (iii) female-mimicking ‘Faeders’. Development into independent or satellite morphs {{has previously been}} shown to be due to a single-locus, two-allele autosomal Mendelian mode of inheritance at the Satellite locus. Here, we use linkage analysis to map the chromosomal location of the Faeder locus, which controls development into the Faeder morph, and draw further conclusions about candidate genes, assuming shared synteny with other birds. Results Segregation data on the Faeder locus were obtained from captive-bred pedigrees comprising 64 multi-generation families (N =  381). There was no evidence that the Faeder locus was linked to the Satellite locus, but it was linked with microsatellite marker Ppu 020. Comparative mapping of ruff microsatellite markers against the chicken (Gallus gallus) and zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata) genomes places the Ppu 020 and Faeder loci on a region of chromosome 11 that includes the Melanocortin- 1 receptor (MC 1 R) gene, which regulates colour polymorphisms in numerous birds and other vertebrates. Melanin-based colouration varies with life-history strategies in ruffs and other species, thus the MC 1 R gene is a strong candidate {{to play a role in}} alternative male morph determination. Conclusion Two unlinked loci appear to control behavioural development in ruffs. The Faeder locus is linked to Ppu 020, which, assuming synteny, is located on avian chromosome 11. MC 1 R is a candidate gene involved in alternative male morph determination in ruffs...|$|R
40|$|The {{fuelling}} {{performance of}} long-distance migrants at staging areas indicates local conditions and determines {{the viability of}} migration routes. Here we present a first case study where long-term fuelling performance was documented along two migration routes with differential population trends. <b>Ruffs</b> (<b>Philomachus</b> <b>pugnax)</b> are shorebirds of inland freshwater wetlands that migrate from the sub-Saharan wintering grounds, via Europe, to the northern Eurasian breeding grounds. Assessments from 2001 to 2008 of fuelling during northward migration at the major western and eastern staging site revealed that daily mass gain rates steeply declined across years in the grasslands for dairy production in Friesland, The Netherlands, and remained constant in the Pripyat floodplains in Belarus, 1500 km further east. Migrants in Friesland decreased from 2001 to 2010 by 66 %, amounting {{to a loss of}} 21, 000 individuals when counts were adjusted for length of stay as determined by resightings. In the same period numbers in Pripyat increased by 12, 000. Ruffs individually ringed in Friesland were resighted in subsequent springs at increasingly eastern sites including Pripyat. Our results corroborate published evidence for an eastward redistribution of Arctic breeding ruffs and suggest that the decreasing fuelling rates in the westernmost staging area contribute to this redistribution. The shift implies that responses occur within a single generation. The hypothesis that the choice of route during northward migration may be driven by food availability can now be tested by creating greater areas of wet grasslands in Friesland. When local staging conditions improve we predict that ruffs will make the reverse shift. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
