40|$|Progress in {{cell type}} {{reprogramming}} has revived {{the interest in}} Waddington’s concept of the epigenetic landscape. Recently researchers developed the quasi-potential theory to represent the Waddington’s landscape. The Quasi-potential U(x), derived from interactions in the gene regulatory network (GRN) of a cell, quantifies the relative stability of network states, which determine the effort required for state transitions in a multi-stable dynamical system. However, quasi-potential landscapes, originally developed for continuous systems, are not suitable for discrete-valued networks which are important tools to study complex systems. In this paper, we provide a framework to quantify the landscape for discrete Boolean networks (BNs). We apply our framework to study <b>pancreas</b> <b>cell</b> differentiation where an ensemble of BN models is considered based {{on the structure of}} a minimal GRN for pancreas development. We impose biologically motivated structural constraints (corresponding to specific type of Boolean functions) and dynamical constraints (corresponding to stable attractor states) to limit the space of BN models for pancreas development. In addition, we enforce a novel functional constraint corresponding to the relative ordering of attractor states in BN models to restrict the space of BN models to the biological relevant class. We find that BNs with canalyzing/sign-compatible Boolean functions best capture the dynamics of <b>pancreas</b> <b>cell</b> differentiation. This framework can also determine the genes' influence on cell state transitions, and thus can facilitate the rational design of cell reprogramming protocols...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Obesity is a {{major health}} problem in the world today. Obesity is closely {{associated}} with insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. Epidemiological {{studies have shown that}} obese persons {{are in a state of}} insulin resistance, however, most of them do not progress to type 2 diabetes. This occurs because the beta cell function is still good enough for maintaining normal glucose level. Obestatin and visfatin are cytokines that are known to have a role in beta cell function. The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between visfatin and obestatin and Homeostasis Model Assessment of beta cell function (HOMA-β) and Homeostasis Model Assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study involving 80 central obesity men with waist circumference > 90 cm, age 30 - 65 years old. Visfatin and obestatin were measured by ELISA method. Beta <b>pancreas</b> <b>cell</b> dysfunction and insulin resistance were calculated by HOMA model. RESULTS: Our study showed a correlation between visfatin and HOMA-β (r= 0. 244 and p = 0. 029) and visfatin with HOMA-IR (r= 0. 287 and p= 0. 001) and no correlation was found between obestatin with HOMA-β (r= 0. 010 and p= 0. 990) and obestatin with HOMA-IR (r= 0. 080 and p= 0. 480). We also found visfatin and obestatin concentrations were fluctuative depending on the measurements of the waist circumferences. CONCLUSIONS: High visfatin and low obestatin concentration were independently associated with increased beta <b>pancreas</b> <b>cell</b> dysfunction and insulin resistance...|$|E
40|$|SummaryPdx 1 is a {{transcription}} factor of fundamental importance to pancreas formation and adult islet β cell function. However, {{little is known}} about the positive- and negative-acting coregulators recruited to mediate transcriptional control. Here, we isolated numerous Pdx 1 -interacting factors possessing a wide range of cellular functions linked with this protein, including, but not limited to, coregulators associated with transcriptional activation and repression, DNA damage response, and DNA replication. Because chromatin remodeling activities are essential to developmental lineage decisions and adult cell function, our analysis focused on investigating the influence of the Swi/Snf chromatin remodeler on Pdx 1 action. The two mutually exclusive and indispensable Swi/Snf core ATPase subunits, Brg 1 and Brm, distinctly affected target gene expression in β cells. Furthermore, physiological and pathophysiological conditions dynamically regulated Pdx 1 binding to these Swi/Snf complexes in vivo.

40|$|To {{elucidate}} {{the role of}} intermediate filament proteins in endocrine cells, we investigated the expression and subcellular distribution of GFAP in mouse islets of Langerhans. For this purpose, combined immunocytochemical and biochemical analysis with a panel of antibodies was carried out to identify GFAP-immunoreactive cells in mouse endocrine <b>pancreas.</b> <b>Cell</b> fractionation into NP- 40 -soluble and detergent/high salt-insoluble components was performed to assess whether GFAP was located in the cytosolic and/or cytoskeletal compartments of immunoreactive cells. Immunoelectron microscopic analysis was carried out to determine the subcellular distribution of the protein. Peripheral islet cells were stained with anti-GFAP antiserum. These cells were identified as glucagon-secreting cells by immunocytochemical staining of consecutive sections with anti-somatostatin, anti-GFAP, and anti-glucagon antisera. Western blotting analysis of both NP- 40 -soluble and detergent/high-salt insoluble fractions of isolated islets of Langerhans allowed detection of GFAP in both cytosolic and cytoskeletal compartments.

40|$|Alcohol {{abuse is}} the major cause of chronic {{inflammation}} of the pancreas (i. e., chronic pancreatitis). Although {{it has long been}} thought that alcoholic pancreatitis is a chronic disease from the outset, evidence is accumulating to indicate that chronic damage in the pancreas may result from repeated attacks of acute tissue inflammation and death (i. e., necroinflammation). Initially, research into the pathogenesis of alcoholic pancreatitis was related to ductular and sphincteric abnormalities. In recent years, the focus has shifted to the type of <b>pancreas</b> <b>cell</b> that produces digestive juices (i. e., acinar cell). Alcohol now is known to exert a number of toxic effects on acinar cells. Notably, acinar cells have been shown to metabolize alcohol (i. e., ethanol) via both oxidative (i. e., involving oxygen) and nonoxidative pathways. The isolation and study of pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs) —the key effectors in the development of connective tissue fibers (i. e., fibrogenesis) in the pancreas—has greatly enhanced our understanding of the pathogenesis of chronic pancreatitis. Pancreatic stellate cells become activated in response to ethanol and acetaldehyde, a toxic byproduct of alcohol metabolism. In addition, PSCs have the capacity to metabolize alcohol via alcohol dehydrogenase (the major oxidizing enzyme for ethanol). The fact that {{only a small percentage of}} heavy alcoholics develop chronic pancreatitis has led to the search for precipitating factors of the disease.

However, pancreas harvesting requires modification of conventional slaughtering to reduce ischemia time. It {{has been shown}} that bovine pancreatic islets can be more easily obtained and they show satisfactory in vitro and in vivo function. To improve the isolation procedure we compared the effect of bovine donor age on islet isolation. METHODS: Islets were isolated by collagenase digestion and sequential sieving from calves (6 months of age) and from adult bovine (> 16 months of age). After isolation the number of islet equivalents was calculated and histological and immunohistochemical studies performed. The purity and viability of islet for each preparation was also estimated. In vitro function of islets was evaluated by static insulin secretion assay, and alginate encapsulated islets were transplanted in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats for in vivo functional evaluation. RESULTS: A significantly higher number of islets were obtained from calf pancreas, compared with adult bovine pancreas. Hystological examination showed intact morphologic features of islets. The purity of islet preparations was higher from calf pancreas than from adult <b>pancreas.</b> <b>Cell</b> viability, and insulin production in presence of high glucose concentration, were not affected by donor age. All animals receiving microencapsulated islets from calves showed normoglycemia for prolonged periods (17 - 40 days).

By analyzing the potential complementary microRNA (miRNA) targeting sequence of PLK 1, we identified that miRNA- 3686 (hereby and thereafter mir 3696) could be the potential regulator for PLK 1. Real-time PCR demonstrated that the mir 3686 has a relatively higher expression in the immortalized <b>pancreas</b> <b>cell</b> HPDE 6 C 7 than pancreas carcinoma derived cell line PANC 1. The upregulation of mir 3686 in HPDE 6 C 7 cell corresponded with the low expression of PLK 1 as well. Both luciferase based reporter assay and evaluation of endogenous PLK 1 expression demonstrated that mir 3686 regulated PLK 1, which confirms our speculation. Moreover, we found that transfection of mir 3686 in PANC 1 cell could lead to proliferation inhibition and promote apoptosis. Further analysis demonstrated that mir 3686 transfection in PANC 1 cell also inhibited cell invasion, and clone formation in cell invasion assay and clonogenic cell survival assay, respectively. In contrast, inhibition of mir 3686 expression in HPDE 6 C 7 cell enhanced the capability of proliferation, cell invasion and clone formation.

The identification of alternative sources for the induction of insulin-producing surrogate beta-cells is a matter of profound importance. PDX- 1 /VP 16, BETA 2 /NeuroD, and MafA overexpression have been shown to influence the differentiation and proliferation of pancreatic stem cells. However, few studies have been conducted using adult animal pancreatic stem cells. Methods: Adult pig pancreatic cells were prepared from the non-endocrine fraction of adult pig pancreata. Porcine neonatal <b>pancreas</b> <b>cell</b> clusters (NPCCs) were prepared from neonatal pigs aged 1 - 2 days. The dispersed pancreatic cells were infected with PDX- 1 /VP 16, BETA 2 /NeuroD, and MafA adenoviruses. After infection, these cells were transplanted under the kidney capsules of normoglycemic nude mice. Results: The adenovirus-mediated overexpression of PDX- 1, BETA 2 /NeuroD and MafA induced insulin gene expression in NP CCs, but not in adult pig pancreatic cells. Immunocytochemistry revealed that the number of insulin-positive cells in NPCCs and adult pig pancreatic cells was approximately 2. 6 - and 1. 1 -fold greater than those in the green fluorescent protein control group, respectively. At four weeks after transplantation, the relative volume of insulin-positive cells in the grafts increased in the NPCCs, but not in the adult porcine pancreatic cells.

SP cells were flow sorted from dissociated <b>pancreas</b> <b>cells</b> of adult mice, analysed for phenotype and cultured with growth promoting and differentiation factors before analysis for hormone expression and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion.

Using immunohistochemistry, Northern blotting, and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, we examined the expression of HGF and Met in normal pancreas and pancreas cancer. Scatter assays, wound-healing assays, and migration through transwell filters were used to study HGF-stimulated motility of IMIM-PC- 2 cancer cells. In tumors, HGF is mainly detected in stromal cells, whereas Met is overexpressed in cancer cells with an unpolarized distribution. In vitro, HGF stimulates motogenesis but not proliferation in cancer cells. Cell motility {{is accompanied by a}} rapid decrease in the cytoskeleton-bound E-cadherin, an acceleration of cellular adhesion to the substrate, an up-regulation of urokinase plasminogen activator (u-PA) RNA and protein, and a change in the solubility and proteolysis of the u-PA receptor. Cell motility is significantly reduced by inhibitors of u-PA proteolytic activity such as antibodies neutralizing u-PA activity, plasminogen activator inhibitor 1, and amiloride. These results show that a paracrine loop of HGF activation may participate in the development or progression of pancreas cancer. In vitro, the HGF-stimulated motogenesis of <b>pancreas</b> cancer <b>cells</b> involves the activation of the u-PA/u-PA receptor proteolytic system, suggesting its role in the invasive stages of tumor progression...|$|R
