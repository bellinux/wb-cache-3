5|$|Since 1905, Windsor Park {{in south}} Belfast has been Linfield's home ground. In the initial {{years after the}} club was formed in 1886, Linfield had to change grounds several times for various reasons such as housing development. The {{numerous}} ground changes and the club's desire to have a <b>permanent</b> <b>home</b> with which to build an identity resulted in {{the purchase of a}} piece of land known as the 'bog meadows' just off lower Windsor Avenue on 1 October 1904. Later known as Windsor Park, this became the club's <b>permanent</b> <b>home</b> as well as the venue for international matches. The first game at Windsor took place on 29 August 1905, with Linfield playing out a 0–0 draw against Distillery in a friendly match arranged to officially commemorate the opening of the stadium. The first competitive game played at the stadium took place just a few days later on 2 September 1905, and ended with a 1–0 win for Linfield over Glentoran – the other half of Belfast's Big Two – though Belfast Celtic were Linfield's main rivals at the time.|$|E
