40|$|In the Dutch {{health care}} system, {{hospitals}} {{are expected to}} compete. A necessary condition for competition among <b>hospitals</b> is that <b>patients</b> do not automatically choose the nearest hospital, but are—at least to some extent—sensitive to differences in hospital quality. In this study, an analysis is performed on the underlying features of <b>patient</b> <b>hospital</b> choice in a setting where prices do not matter for patients {{as a result of}} health insurance coverage. Using claims data from all Dutch hospitals over the years 2008 – 2010, a conditional logit model examines the relationship between patient characteristics (age, gender and reoperations) and hospital attributes (hospital quality information, waiting times on treatments and travel time for <b>patients</b> to the <b>hospitals)</b> in the market for general nonemergency hip replacement treatments. The results show that travel time is the most important determinant in <b>patient</b> <b>hospital</b> choice. From our analysis, however, it follows that publicly available hospital quality ratings and waiting times also {{have a significant impact on}} <b>patient</b> <b>hospital</b> choice. The panel data used for this study (2008 – 2010) is rather short, which may explain why no coherent and persistent changes in <b>patient</b> <b>hospital</b> choice behaviour over time are found...|$|R

Second, we examine whether patients requiring similar treatment had similar per <b>patient</b> <b>hospital</b> costs by considering patients treated for coronary heart disease. Third, we consider the impact that population ageing and changes in treatment propensities are likely to have on hospital usage and costs by 2009 - 2010, assuming that no changes occur in per unit treatment costs.
