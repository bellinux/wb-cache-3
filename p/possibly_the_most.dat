5|$|Del Potro is an {{offensive}} baseliner {{with a very}} powerful serve and deep, flat, topspin groundstroke, where he pushes his opponents deeper with his heavy groundstroke and trying to blast past them with a winner. His forehand {{is one of his}} main strengths and <b>possibly</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> powerful in the game, capable of frequently generating speeds of 160km/h.|$|E
5|$|Star Wars creator George Lucas {{personally}} directed Shaw for {{his appearance}} in the final scene of the film, {{in which he is}} a Force Ghost of Anakin. Shaw's image in this scene was replaced with that of Christensen in the 2004 release. This last attempt to tie the prequel and original trilogies together proved to be <b>possibly</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> controversial change in the Star Wars re-releases.|$|E
5|$|Telopea truncata is one, and <b>possibly</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> distinctive, of five {{species from}} southeastern Australia {{which make up}} the genus Telopea. It is the {{earliest}} offshoot of a lineage that {{gives rise to the}} Gippsland waratah (T.oreades) and Monga waratah (T.mongaensis) of southeastern mainland Australia. The perianths of T.truncata are of a single shade of red, whereas those of its mainland relatives are coloured with two distinct shades of red—the surfaces facing the centre of the flower head are a much brighter red than those facing away.|$|E

5|$|The Hamden tornado {{was by far}} {{the most}} {{destructive}} tornado of this family, and <b>possibly</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> damaging of the entire outbreak. It touched down at 5:38pm near the Wilbur Cross Parkway. Industrial cranes and cars were tossed through the air, and rows of houses, as well as an industrial park, were flattened. The tornado lifted just a few minutes later at 5:45. The damage path was only five miles long, stopping just short of the city of New Haven, but it damaged or destroyed almost 400 structures in its path.|$|E
5|$|Underground Egyptian tombs {{built in}} the desert provide <b>possibly</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> {{protective}} environment {{for the preservation of}} papyrus documents. For example, there are many well-preserved Book of the Dead funerary papyri placed in tombs to act as afterlife guides for the souls of the deceased tomb occupants. However, it was only customary during the late Middle Kingdom and first half of the New Kingdom to place non-religious papyri in burial chambers. Thus, the majority of well-preserved literary papyri are dated to this period.|$|E
5|$|A typical {{feature in}} Vanajas was over-engineered {{structures}} which were robust rather than optimised. The main components were sourced from well-established suppliers. VAT also showed progressive thinking in driver ergonomics; the comfortably sprung and hydraulically damped driver's seat was positioned {{close to the}} door, to ease reversing. The seat had several {{ways in which it}} could be adjusted. Hanging pedals, which were set to the same level, became standard at an early stage. Vanaja's interior heater, which produced 9,000kcal/h, was <b>possibly</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> efficient available in lorries by the 1960s. Many Vanaja drivers valued the particularly soft suspension of the vehicles. Two-axle lorries were available in 4×2 and 4×4 layouts; the three-axle models were produced as 6×2, 6×4, 4×4+2 and 6×6.|$|E

5|$|American {{economist}} and former Chairman of the Federal Reserve Paul Volcker {{has argued that}} the lack of global consensus on key issues threatens efforts to reform the global financial system. He has argued that quite <b>possibly</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> important issue is a unified approach to addressing failures of systemically important financial institutions, noting public taxpayers and government officials have grown disillusioned with deploying tax revenues to bail out creditors for the sake of stopping contagion and mitigating economic disaster. Volcker has expressed an array of potential coordinated measures: increased policy surveillance by the IMF and commitment from nations to adopt agreed-upon best practices, mandatory consultation from multilateral bodies leading to more direct policy recommendations, stricter controls on national qualification for emergency financing facilities (such as those offered by the IMF or by central banks), and improved incentive structures with financial penalties.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the war, Australians {{were far}} more circumspect. The nation's {{involvement}} cost more than 60,000 Australian lives and many more were left unable to work {{as a result of their}} injuries. The impact of the war was felt in many other areas as well. Financially it was very costly, while the effect on the social and political landscape was considerable and threatened to cause serious divides in the nation's social fabric. Conscription was <b>possibly</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> contentious issue and ultimately, despite having conscription for home service, Australia was one of only two combatants not to use conscripts in the fighting. Nevertheless, for many Australians the nation's involvement in World War I and the Gallipoli campaign was seen as a symbol of its emergence as an international actor, while many of the notions of the Australian character and nationhood that exist today have their origins in the war and Anzac Day is commemorated as a national holiday.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{perceived}} conservatism, in 1963 Brabham {{was the first}} Formula One team to use a wind tunnel to hone their designs to reduce drag and stop the cars lifting off the ground at speed. The practice only became the norm in the early 1980s, and is <b>possibly</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> {{important factor in the}} design of modern cars. Towards the end of the 1960s, teams began to exploit aerodynamic downforce to push the cars' tyres down harder on the track and enable them to maintain faster speeds through high-speed corners. At the 1968 Belgian Grand Prix, Brabham were the first, alongside Ferrari, to introduce full width rear wings to this effect.|$|E
50|$|Ateleaspis <b>possibly</b> is <b>the</b> <b>most</b> basal {{vertebrate}} with paired fins. Ateleaspis was a {{small fish}} (about 15 - 20 cm) and had a flat headshield a narrow trunk covered by brick-like scales.|$|R

50|$|The {{nature of}} their job may require {{constant}} exposure to toxins and pesticides and subjects them to increasingly extreme weather as climate change progresses.

5|$|In 518, Scupi was {{destroyed}} by a violent earthquake, <b>possibly</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> devastating one Macedonia has ever experienced. At that time, the region was threatened by the Barbarian invasions, and the city inhabitants had already fled in forests and mountains before the disaster occurred. Scupi was eventually rebuilt by Justinian I. During his reign, many Byzantine towns were relocated on hills and other easily defendable places to face invasions. Scupi was thus transferred on another site: the promontory on which stands the fortress. However, Scupi was sacked by Slavs {{at the end of}} the 6th century and the city seems to have fallen under Slavic rule in 695. The Slavic tribe which settled in Scupi were probably the Berziti who had invaded the entire Vardar valley. The city is not mentioned during the three following centuries but along with the rest of Upper Vardar it became part of the expanding First Bulgarian Empire in the 830s.|$|E
5|$|Lions {{continue}} to be featured in modern literature, from the messianic Aslan in The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe and following books from The Chronicles of Narnia series written by C. S. Lewis, to the comedic Cowardly Lion in The Wonderful Wizard of Oz. The advent of moving pictures saw the continued presence of lion symbolism; {{one of the most}} iconic and widely recognised lions is Leo the Lion, which has been the mascot for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) studios since the 1920s. The 1960s saw the appearance of what is <b>possibly</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> famous lioness, the Kenyan animal Elsa in the movie Born Free, based on the true-life book of the same title. The lion's role as king of the beasts has been used in cartoons, such as the 1994 Disney animated feature film The Lion King.|$|E
5|$|<b>Possibly</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> {{pervasive}} {{influence on}} Walpole was Walter Scott, whose romanticism {{is reflected in}} much of the later writer's fiction. Such was Walpole's love of Scott that he liked to think of himself as the latter's reincarnation. He amassed the largest collection in Britain of Scott manuscripts and early editions, and constantly reread the novels. With the Herries stories Walpole restored the popularity of the historical novel, a form for which Scott was famous but which had been out of fashion for decades. The Herries series begins in the 18th century and follows a Lakeland family through the generations up to modern times.|$|E

5|$|With the Vijayanagara Kingdom now {{imperial}} in stature, Harihara II, {{the second}} son of Bukka Raya I, further consolidated the kingdom beyond the Krishna River {{and brought the}} whole of South India under the Vijayanagara umbrella. The next ruler, Deva Raya I, emerged successful against the Gajapatis of Odisha and undertook important works of fortification and irrigation. Italian traveler Niccolo de Conti wrote of him {{as the most powerful}} ruler of India. Deva Raya II (called Gajabetekara) succeeded to the throne in 1424 and was <b>possibly</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> capable of the Sangama dynasty rulers. He quelled rebelling feudal lords as well as the Zamorin of Calicut and Quilon in the south. He invaded the island of Lanka and became overlord of the kings of Burma at Pegu and Tanasserim.|$|E
5|$|In 1954, Takechi {{followed}} Susugigawa with a noh-kyōgen {{version of}} Junji Kinoshita's Yūzuru. Yūzuru {{is one of}} the most successful Japanese post-World War II plays, having received over a thousand performances at schools and theaters both within Japan and internationally since its debut in 1949. Composer Ikuma Dan wrote an opera version of the play in 1952. Since its premiere, Dan's opera has been performed more than 550 times, making it <b>possibly</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> popular opera written in Japanese. Dan was recruited to write the original music for Takechi's production of the play. Dan combined the noh-style solo vocal lines with a Western orchestra and chorus. On the same program as Yūzuru was another Takechi-directed kyōgen, Higashi wa Higashi (East is East), a parody of the kyōgen style. Among the innovations Takechi made in this play was the inclusion of a former Takarazuka actress in the usually all-male kyōgen cast. In the ultra-conservative noh and kyōgen communities, simply appearing in a rival school's production could result in an actor's excommunication from the profession. Because of the public attention drawn through Takechi's relentless publicity work and communication with the media, punitive actions against actors who worked with Takechi were avoided.|$|E
5|$|<b>Possibly</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> {{famous of}} all his {{international}} caps came in a match in Glasgow against Scotland in October 1930, in which a depleted Welsh side, unable to call up many of their star players as Football League clubs refused to release them for international duty, became known as 'Keenor and the 10 unknowns'. Ted Robbin's side, playing on a Saturday when the English leagues had a full programme, {{had no choice but}} to play 10 players from either the lower divisions, Welsh League sides or from the non-leagues. The Welsh featured just seven players from Football League sides, with only Keenor and Cardiff teammates Len Evans and Walter Robbins playing in the top two divisions, 3 players from Welsh league sides Cardiff Corinthians, Llanelli and Colwyn Bay and one player from non-league side Oswestry Town. The side featured nine debutants in the line-up, Keenor and Cardiff teammate Len Evans being the only two with previous experience at international level. Wales had previously been forced into a similar situation eight months earlier, in February 1930, when Keenor had played in a severely weakened side that had lost 7–0 to Ireland, Joe Bambrick scoring six times in the game, describing the match as the worst game he had ever played.|$|E

5|$|Warlugulong {{was first}} {{exhibited}} at {{a show in}} Alice Springs, where it attracted crowds of interested viewers, but failed to sell. Realities Gallery in Melbourne then included the work in a major exhibition of Papunya Tula artworks. It was purchased for A$1,200 by the Commonwealth Bank, which hung it in a bank training centre cafeteria on the Mornington Peninsula. The bank sold it by auction in 1996. The auction house trading the work expected it to fetch around $5,000 and {{did not make a}} feature of it in the catalogue, but dealers including Hank Ebes, the successful bidder, recognised the painting's significance and it sold for $36,000 plus commission. After hanging in Ebes's living room for eleven years, it was auctioned in Melbourne by Sotheby's on 24 July 2007. It sold for $2.4million, thoroughly eclipsing the previous record for an Indigenous Australian painting, set when Emily Kngwarreye's Earth's Creation was bought in May of the same year for just over $1million. Warlugulongs buyer was the National Gallery of Australia, which purchased the work as part of its 25th Anniversary Gifts Program. The Gallery considers the painting to be <b>possibly</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> important in its collection of Indigenous Australian art. As of 2016, the work is on display in the National Gallery.|$|E
