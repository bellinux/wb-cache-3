Important evidence of Mycenaean armor has also been found in Thebes (c. 1350–1250 BC), which include a pair of shoulder guards, smaller than to those from Dendra, with additional plates protecting the upper arms, attached to the lower edge of the shoulder guards.|$|E

25|$|The {{process that}} created the septaria that {{characterize}} septarian concretions remains unclear.

Widely-dierent practical languages (exem-pli ed by Java, Haskell, Prolog, and Erlang) with their rich <b>panoplies</b> of abstractions and syntax are explained by straightforward translations into closely-related kernel languages, simple languages that consist of small numbers of programmer-signicant concepts.

We have taught the approach at three universities in courses ranging from second-year undergraduate courses to graduate courses. We are completing a textbook with accompanying materials. As part of a curriculum, the approach naturally complements courses on algo-rithms & data structures and program design & software engineering.

In appearance, they would have been almost identical to the hypaspists. In battle, the Greek hoplites had a less active role than the Macedonian phalangites and hypaspists. At Gaugamela, the Greek infantry formed the defensive rear of the box formation Alexander arranged his army into, while the Macedonians formed its front face. Nevertheless, they performed a valuable function in facing down attempts by the Persian cavalry to surround the Macedonian army and helped deal with the breakthrough of some Persian horsemen who went on to attack the baggage.|$|E
25|$|After {{writing a}} column about Japanese popular culture {{for nearly a}} decade for the ezine PopMatters and penning over 600 entries in an online travelblog, Holden {{published}} the memoir, Peripatetic Postcards: The journey of life, through 25 of the world's cities, in 2010. Holden characterizes the work as a literary memoir of being and becoming; a set of lessons about life and musings on the human condition by a writer searching to find his way. The book opens by outlining a philosophy for undertaking the journey of life—what Holden calls “peripatacity”—and then enumerates a set of rules for conducting the journey. Subsequent chapters focus on the processes, people, places, predicaments, and philosophies encountered along life’s road. A final chapter personifies the journey by following the progress of the author, his wife and bi-cultural children on road trips through their native America and Japan—trips that prompt reflections on childhood, death, love, fate, God, happiness, family, home, place, personal growth, and the meaning of life. Throughout, Peripatetic Postcards operates at two levels: seeking to convey the <b>panoply</b> of human experience for those looking to broaden their understanding of the human condition in an increasingly globalized world, while also providing a model for discovery, personified in the author's experience.|$|E

It {{was invented in}} Italy {{at the beginning of}} the 15 th century. It quickly appeared in Poland. We think so because we can see it hewn out on the tombstone of Wierzbięta from Branice. This tombstone bears a date on 1425. This kind of armament occured comparatively often on the Polish territory in the latter part of the 15 th century. Both iconographie and written sources testify to that. The registers of mercenary army units, drown up from 1471 to 1500, are one of the most valuable written sources. In this article the author analysed 7 registers of that kind. We can notice connexions bettween offensive and protective armaments on the ground of that. In period 1471 - 1474 there were organized some mercenary squads for armed fighting with the king of Hungary - Maciej the Korwin. Hungarians adhered to West-European style of fighting and that’s why these Polish mercenary squads consisted, in the greater part, of spearmen equiped with the clads of plate. They composed about 21 - 25 % of mercenaries. The <b>panoplies</b> were the majority of the spearmen equipment. Zadanie pt.

40|$|In Take the Floor I {{explored}} {{the conditions of}} communication inflected by habitus. Apart from Bourdieu’s definition of the notion, Rapport and Overing (2003 : 2) emphasized those transposable dispositions which generate structured social practices. Understanding the conditions of habitus allows the generator of discourses, endowed with agency, to insert in them manipulative or propagandistic ingredients. Thus, literature can very well function as a platform for public relations or advertising. Every author assesses readers’ objectives and needs before elaborating narratives. Postmodernism also resorted to multi-layered discourses in the post-totalitarian epoch and revived the importance of cultural symbols (flags, statues, and religious icons), exactly as in the medieval epoch (cf. Sammuel P. Huntington. The Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of World Order, 1997). In order to deconstruct the toxic discourses of a macdonaldized and disneylandized post-industrial society, reception has to resort to mediated discourse analysis, as it includes the social identities and social relationships made possible by certain discourses (Hyland and Paltridge 2011 : 10). Actions are transformed into texts and texts into actions in a never-ending entextualization. The reception of literature is basically intralingual translation and every literary encoded message will be decoded in <b>panoplies</b> of meanings, depending {{on the level of}} communication between works of art and their readership. Respecting the pattern of everyday communication, the feedback offered by readers is influenced by context, noise, mood, level of decoding, filters and so on...|$|R
