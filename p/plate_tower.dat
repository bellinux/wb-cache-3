50|$|Wet {{scrubbers}} that remove {{gaseous pollutants}} {{are referred to}} as absorbers. Good gas-to-liquid contact is essential to obtain high removal efficiencies in absorbers. Various wet-scrubber designs are used to remove gaseous pollutants, with the packed tower and the <b>plate</b> <b>tower</b> being the most common.|$|E
5000|$|The crib was {{transported to}} the site from Amherstburg, Ontario. It was built pre-fabricated 45 by 18 ft, sunk in 22 ft of water, filled with {{concrete}} and surrounded by a granite pier. The light station pier is shaped like a vessel. Its pointed end is directed toward {{the mouth of the}} river to break river-powered ice floes. Above the crib and pier, the 49 ft high cast iron boiler <b>plate</b> <b>tower</b> is 22 ft in diameter at its base and 18 ft at the top. [...] There is an attached storage building and radio beacon.|$|E
5000|$|Spray towers can be {{used for}} gas absorption, but they are not as {{effective}} as packed or <b>plate</b> <b>towers.</b> Spray towers can be very effective in removing pollutants if the pollutants are highly soluble or if a chemical reagent is added to the liquid.|$|R
50|$|They are {{the most}} widely used {{scrubbers}} because their open construction enables them to remove most particles without plugging or scalding.

40|$|Deodorization and {{volatile}} organic compound abatement from polluted air streams can be accomplished with the biological <b>plate</b> <b>tower</b> (BPT), which {{has proved to be}} a reliable alternative to biofilters and biotrickling filters. Unlike those, the BPT is a non-clogging device, with constant active surface, and steady performance, making it ideal for scale-up and modelling. The initial BPT design needed improvement for better performance. The cylindrical body (circular plates) was replaced by a rectangular cuboid (rectangular plates). Holes in the plates did augment the amount of active biomass (hanging from the holes and under the plates), without reducing the transfer of toluene from the gaseous to the liquid phase. The diminished distance between plates was well tolerated in cocurrent flow, allowing much higher quantities of biomass in the same reactor volume. With 18 and 14 mm spacing between adjacent plates, the BPT, with and without holes, was tested for flooding, holdup and pressure drop. Several gas and liquid flows were tested, both in co-current and countercurrent. In hydrodynamic terms, the BPT-HB with co-current flow was clearly the best option. Higher stability with higher flow rates, and lower pressure drops were observed. The inoculum was obtained from wastewater plant activated sludge (petrochemical industry) ...|$|E

5000|$|To promote maximum gas-liquid {{surface area}} and {{residence}} time, {{a number of}} wet scrubber designs have been used, including spray <b>towers,</b> venturis, <b>plate</b> <b>towers,</b> and mobile packed beds. Because of scale buildup, plugging, or erosion, which affect FGD dependability and absorber efficiency, the trend is to use simple scrubbers such as spray towers instead of more complicated ones. The configuration of the tower may be vertical or horizontal, and flue gas can flow cocurrently, countercurrently, or crosscurrently {{with respect to the}} liquid. The chief drawback of spray towers is that they require a higher liquid-to-gas ratio requirement for equivalent [...] removal than other absorber designs.|$|R

40|$|Butadiene 1 : 3 is {{separated}} from other C 4 -hydrocarbons by extractive distillation in a sieve <b>plate</b> <b>tower.</b> Prior to the development work to be described, the pressure in the extraction tower was controlled at a fixed value. The tower pressure-boilup control loop did not behave satisfactorily {{in the presence of}} non-condensables which entered with the feed. The capacity of the flooded reflux drum condenser for the tower was limiting production during summer months. The tower pressure control loop was put on manual. The pressure was allowed to drop to its lowest attainable value for the existing conditions of boilup and condenser cooling capability. This manner of operation is known as floating pressure control. By taking advantage of the higher relative volatility at the lower tower pressure, energy usage was reduced and there was an increase in production capacity. The tower operation at a lower temperature reduced tower and reboiler fouling. Substantial savings have resulted from these improvements. The annual energy consumption has been reduced by 25 % and maximum productive capacity is higher by 15 %. The rate of tower and reboiler fouling has not been fully quantified but is greatly reduced. A more stable tower operation has also contributed to higher productivity and reduced energy usage. Venting of non-condensables does not affect tower stability and the operators have adapted well to the new control strategy...|$|E

50|$|By {{stacking}} reducing floor <b>plates,</b> the <b>tower</b> tapers dramatically {{to minimize}} the surface area exposed to wind, sun, and moisture. The gently-undulating curves of the façade subtly denote {{the integration of the}} three distinct programs within a singular smooth object. Square in plan with rounded corners, the floor plate geometry enables unique interior fit-outs and customization options for occupants. Research by the architect has the shown that lateral forces due to vortex shedding can be controlled by tapering the vertical profile of the tower and softening any sharp corners in plan. The building’s aerodynamic shape greatly reduces this vortex shedding by “confusing the wind” and disrupting the opportunity for any resonating wind forces and loads on the structure.|$|R
