Jaojoby's 2004 follow-up album Malagasy, which {{was recorded}} in semi-live conditions on the island of Réunion in a small venue before an audience of the artist's friends, featured lyrics that sought to promote optimism and national reconciliation; the artist announced that he would not involve himself in national <b>politics</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> future.

5|$|Between October 1992 and March 1993, Sargsyan {{served as}} the Presidential Adviser on Defence Affairs and the Presidential Envoy to Border Regions of Armenia. Subsequently, he was {{appointed}} the State Minister on Defence, Security and Internal Affairs. In these positions, Sargsyan had {{a major role in}} the advance of the Armenian army. With other key commanders, he regulated the operations to the Armenian forces in Nagorno-Karabakh. He was particularly active in unifying the various semi-independent detachments active in the war zone. Political chaos in Azerbaijan and the demoralization of the Azerbaijani army resulted in the Armenian forces taking control over the territories outside of the original Soviet-drawn borders of Nagorno-Karabakh. In 1993, Sargsyan founded and led Yerkrapah, a union of 5,000 war veterans, that had a great influence in Armenia's domestic <b>politics</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> post-war years and became the main base for Vazgen Sargsyan to rise in power.|$|E

5|$|By {{the end of}} the war, Model {{had gained}} a {{reputation}} as a capable officer with great potential. Early on in his military career, Model had written a book on the Prussian general August Neidhardt von Gneisenau. In addition, he was already known to Hans von Seeckt, head of the slimmed-down Reichswehr, from his staff postings during the war, and he was equipped with an excellent reference from Major-General Franz von Rantau, commander of the 36th Reserve Division. It was thus no surprise {{that he was one of}} the 4,000 officers retained in the Reichswehr. Model generally kept away from <b>politics</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> chaotic period that marked the birth of the Weimar Republic, although as an army officer he was involved in the bloody suppression of the 1920 communist uprising in the Ruhr.|$|E
5|$|Charles Robert Forbes (February 14, 1878 – April 10, 1952) was {{appointed}} the first Director of the Veterans' Bureau by President Warren G.

He first became active in <b>politics</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Pacific Northwest. In 1912, Forbes moved to Hawaii and served as chairman on various federal commissions. While Senator Warren G. Harding was on vacation in Hawaii the two met by chance and became friends. After the 1920 U.S. Presidential election, President Harding appointed Forbes director to the newly created Veterans' Bureau, a powerful position in charge {{of millions of dollars in}} government expenditures and supplies.|$|E

5|$|Historians {{have since}} {{connected}} {{the success of}} Save Our Children with the organization of conservative Christian participation in political processes. Although forceful Christian involvement had not taken a widespread role in <b>politics</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States since 1925, within two years the Reverend Jerry Falwell developed a coalition of conservative religious groups named the Moral Majority that influenced the Republican Party to incorporate a social agenda in national politics. Homosexuality, the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA), abortion, and pornography were among the issues most central to the Moral Majority's priorities until it folded in 1989. For many gay people, the surprise at the outcome of all the campaigns in 1977 and 1978 instilled a new determination and consolidated activism and communities in many cities where the gay community had not been politically active.|$|E
5|$|Home Rule was the {{key issue}} in British <b>politics</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> late 1880s. The debate {{revolved}} around granting Ireland more powers to govern themselves. William Ewart Gladstone, the Liberal Prime Minister, proposed the First Home Rule Bill in April 1886, aiming to devolve power to Ireland. The Conservatives were opposed to the Bill, and were joined {{by a number of}} Liberal members in defeating the Bill. This caused a split in the Liberal party, the creation of the Liberal Unionist Party, and a fresh general election, just a year after the last. At the 1886 general election, the Conservatives entered government with Lord Salibsury as Prime Minister. They formed a majority with the Liberal Unionists.|$|E
