The thesis motivating this research is {{that large numbers of}} industrial optimisation tasks involving spatial reasoning (such as 2 D <b>part</b> <b>nesting)</b> can be outsourced as human intelligence tasks to rural workers to provide a sustainable source of skilled employment. We hypothesis that 3 D spatial reasoning ability is essential to solve spatial optimization tasks. In this paper we reported the 3 D spatial manipulation ability of eighty rural workers in four rural business process outsourcing (BPO) centres in India. The assessments reveal that although the average spatial manipulation ability is less than the literature reported benchmark, there are talented workers identified in all the four rural centres, and the results identify priority activities required to enable the proposed approach...|$|E

But, inappropriate control and setting may lead to material defects, machine malfunction or even catastrophe. Hence, {{the purpose of this study}} is to implement the ideas from lean six sigma for optimizing laser cutting conditions to prolong the service life of the laser cutting machine. The entire dissertation will be surrounded in optimize machining parameters for EPILOG Legend 36 Ext – Model 9000 laser cutting machine in the FKM lab by using DMAIC approach. And, the whole idea of optimal control was encapsulated in Lean Six Sigma methodology which summarized in the abbreviation (DMAIC) : Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve and Control. First of all, a list of problem statement has constructed to clarify the objectives of the project to be studied. Second, a value stream mapping diagram has constructed to serve as an overview of the entire maintenance management system in order to measure the bottlenecks between personnel and information flow from relevant management level. Third, a mathematical modelling software such as MATLAB was used to formulate the relationship between the cutting parameters towards the cutting quality of acrylic specimens. Forth, solutions to machining dysfunctions has proposed and optimum cutting conditions were developed by using Design Expert software. Fifth, a standard practice such as SOP (standard of procedure) was developed to replace current machining procedures. Finally, improved plans were further monitored in order to ensure the improvements were sustainable. After implementing DMAIC, it was found that the information given by supplier’s manual should be continually revised since machining parameters due to deteriorate of machine parts. The values of revising SOP may help FKM lab to save cost in machine repair...|$|E

40|$|What is the Migratory Bird Treaty Act? The Migratory Bird Treaty Act (MBTA) is {{the primary}} {{legislation}} in the U. S. established to conserve migratory birds. Under the MBTA, no one may take, possess, import, export, transport, sell, purchase, barter, or offer for sale, purchase, or barter, any migratory bird, or the <b>parts,</b> <b>nests,</b> or eggs of such a bird except {{under the terms of}} a valid permit issued pursuant to Federal regulations. The MBTA convers migratory bird species protected under four international treaties between the U. S. and Canada, Mexico, Japan, and Russia. All {{but a few of the}} bird species natural occurring in the U. S. are protected under the Act. What are Migratory Bird Permits? The MBTA greatly restricts what activities may be undertaken involving migratory birds. However, the Act also provides that the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service may issue permits authorizing otherwise prohibited activities for scientific, educational, cultural, and other purposes. Pursuant to this provision, the Service issues permits to qualified applicants for the following activities involving migratory birds: Import/Export. Permits are issued to authorize the import and export of migratory birds and their <b>parts,</b> <b>nests</b> and eggs. (Certain permit exceptions apply to lawfully taken game birds). Scientific Collecting. Permits are issued to individuals collecting migratory birds on behalf of scientific institutions and agencies for educational and/or scientific purposes. Taxidermy. Permits are issued to qualified individuals to mount or otherwise perform taxidermy services on migratory birds, their <b>parts,</b> <b>nests</b> or eggs, belonging to someone else. Waterfowl Sale and Disposal. Although a permit is not required to possess properly marked captive-bred waterfowl or their eggs, a permit is necessary to engage in the sale or transfer of such birds. Properly marked captive-bred mallard ducks are an exception, requiring no permit to sell, buy or keep. Falconry. Permits are issued to individuals engaging in falconry, which is the art of training raptors for pursuit of game and the sport of hunting with raptors. Raptor Propagation. Permits are issued to qualified individuals and institutions breeding raptors for falconry and conservation purposes. Depredation permits. Permits are issued to take, possess, or transport migratory birds for damage control purposes, such as protection of personal or public property or for human health or safety reasons. Special Purpose. Permits are issued where the applicant demonstrates a legitimate purpose not otherwise provided for by any standard permit...|$|R

In contrast to most literature on this topic, a part {{does not have to}} be cut at once. If this reduces the total non-cutting time, it is possible to cut a number of elements on a given part, then cut other parts and then return later to finish cutting the given part. The problem is modeled as a generalized traveling salesperson problem with special precedence constraints. An initial feasible solution is generated and improved by local moves embedded in a tabu search framework.

40|$|The goal of {{the current}} thesis {{is to provide a}} {{framework}} for investigating and understanding visual processing of hierarchical structure (i. e., local <b>parts</b> <b>nested</b> in global wholes, such as trees nested in forests) under incidental processing conditions—that is, where processing of information at global and local levels is both uninformative (cannot aid task performance) and task-irrelevant (need not be processed to perform the task). To do so, a novel method combining two widely-used paradigms (spatial cueing and compound stimulus paradigms) is used for implicitly probing observers’ perceptual representations over the course of processing. This compound arrow cueing paradigm was used in five experiments to address a series of objectives. First, which level (global or local) is more dominant in the evolution of a percept? Relatedly, is the temporal structuring of global and local processing fixed or flexible? And what is the time course of level-specific advantages—do they occur earlier or later in the course of processing, and do they follow a transient or protracted time course? Finally, what controls level-specific selection (sensory, perceptual, and/or attentional factors) ? The results of the five experiments addressing these issues contribute to a greater understanding of visual perception by elucidating the nature of global and local processing under incidental processing conditions. ...|$|R

The performance of the proposed rule was tested against three priority rules: first-in-first-out, shortest processing time, and longest processing time. The results of the simulation experiment showed that the dispatching rule performs better than the rules tested. The third problem is concerned with scheduling laser cutting operations.
