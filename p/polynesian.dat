5|$|Early Māori {{adapted the}} tropically based east <b>Polynesian</b> culture {{in line with}} the {{challenges}} associated with a larger and more diverse environment, eventually developing their own distinctive culture. Social organisation was largely communal with families (whānau), subtribes (hapū) and tribes (iwi) ruled by a chief (rangatira), whose position was subject to the community's approval. The British and Irish immigrants brought aspects of their own culture to New Zealand and also influenced Māori culture, particularly with the introduction of Christianity. However, Māori still regard their allegiance to tribal groups as a vital part of their identity, and Māori kinship roles resemble those of other <b>Polynesian</b> peoples. More recently American, Australian, Asian and other European cultures have exerted influence on New Zealand. Non-Māori <b>Polynesian</b> cultures are also apparent, with Pasifika, the world's largest <b>Polynesian</b> festival, now an annual event in Auckland.|$|E
5|$|Finney {{disagreed}} with the accidental voyaging portion of Sharp's hypothesis. To investigate the problem, he founded the <b>Polynesian</b> Voyaging Society with Herb Kane and Tommy Holmes in 1973, intent on building a voyaging canoe to sail from Hawaii to Tahiti to test whether intentional two-way voyaging throughout Oceania could be replicated. With the help of Mau's navigational knowledge guiding Hōkūle‘a, the <b>Polynesian</b> Voyaging Society demonstrated that intentional voyaging was not only possible, but also the ancestors of the Polynesians could have settled the Pacific on similar voyages using non-instrument wayfinding techniques such as Mau's. Finally, linguistic and archaeological {{evidence suggests that the}} history of the <b>Polynesian</b> people does not originate in the East Pacific but in the West. Recent developments in the field of DNA analysis have unequivocally settled the debate of <b>Polynesian</b> origin. They prove Polynesians share common ancestry with indigenous Taiwanese and East Asians.|$|E
5|$|In the 1990s, {{the island}} was leased to Urima Felix, a French <b>Polynesian</b> entrepreneur; he {{established}} a small homestead {{on one of the}} islets and reportedly had plans for development of the atoll. The island is also occasionally visited by <b>Polynesian</b> copra gatherers under agreements with the Kiribati government in Tarawa.|$|E
50|$|However, {{since the}} 1970s {{the number of}} French <b>Polynesians</b> {{admitted}} each year was more varied: So, in 1975, the number of admissions was reduced compared to previous years, because only 47 people of this origin were admitted. Also in 1984 were admitted 59 French <b>Polynesians,</b> a number that was reduced to 19 people of same origin in 1986. For its part, in 1991 it was registered that 31 French <b>Polynesians</b> emigrated to US with legal status in this year and, in 1997, other 21 French <b>Polynesians</b> obtained the admission for live in US.|$|R
50|$|During {{the twentieth}} century, the annual number of French <b>Polynesians</b> {{who moved to}} the US was small but with certain growth between the 1950 and 70s. So, while in 1954 just three French <b>Polynesians</b> arrived in the United States, in 1956 entry of 14 {{immigrant}} French <b>Polynesians</b> it was recorded and in 1965 were admitted other 49 people of same origin.|$|R
40|$|We {{have used}} Y-chromosomal polymorphisms to trace {{paternal}} lineages in <b>Polynesians</b> {{by use of}} samples pre-viously typed for mtDNA variants. A genealogical ap-proach utilizing hierarchical analysis of eight rare-event biallelic polymorphisms, seven microsatellite loci, and internal structural analysis of the hypervariable mini-satellite, MSY 1, {{has been used to}} define three major paternal-lineage clusters in <b>Polynesians.</b> Two of these clusters, both defined by novel MSY 1 modular structures and representing 55 % of the <b>Polynesians</b> studied, are also found in coastal Papua New Guinea. Reduced Pol-ynesian diversity, relative to that in Melanesians, is il-lustrated by the presence of several examples of identical MSY 1 codes and microsatellite haplotypes within these lineage clusters in <b>Polynesians.</b> The complete lack of...|$|R
5|$|Little {{is known}} about the Marquesan Dog.

5|$|There are {{at least}} two {{different}} dependent glyphs used for the concept of a guiding star. The generic <b>Polynesian</b> term is Ihu-ku (Hawaiian) which translates to “standing above the bow”. This concept is associated with the ‘phallic’ dependent glyph. For a specific guiding star used to make landfall on an island, the <b>Polynesian</b> term is hoku ai’aina, which is translated to “stars which ate, ruled the land”. This concept is referred to with the ‘hand’ dependent glyph.|$|E

5|$|With Finney's help, Mau {{was awarded}} a special {{fellowship}} at the East-West Center. Mau returned to Honolulu in April 1975 to begin work with the Hawaii-based <b>Polynesian</b> Voyaging Society, eventually navigating the double-hulled canoe, Hōkūle‘a, from Hawaii to Tahiti on its maiden voyage in 1976. Mau trained and mentored Native Hawaiian navigator Nainoa Thompson, who would later become a master navigator. David Henry Lewis, a scholar of <b>Polynesian</b> navigation, documented Mau's work.|$|E
5|$|The Dietrich {{hypothesis}} interprets rongorongo {{not as a}} script, but as a notational {{system for}} astronomical, calendrical, and navigational data.

5|$|Among the {{northern}} <b>Polynesian</b> people, Vega {{was known as}} whetu o te tau, the year star. For a period of history it marked the start of their new year when the ground would be prepared for planting. Eventually this function became denoted by the Pleiades.|$|E
50|$|The Nauruans {{have two}} {{elements}} of their population: the native Micronesians and the <b>Polynesians</b> who had immigrated long before. The Micronesians are represented through coarse, dark hair; the <b>Polynesians</b> are lighter brown and have smoother, black hair. Through these two extremes the diverse transitions came to exist.|$|R
50|$|The {{history of}} the Pitcairn Islands begins with the {{colonization}} of the islands by <b>Polynesians</b> in the 11th century.

Almost all his fellow mutineers (including Christian), and their male <b>Polynesian</b> companions, had killed each other over time in varying conflicts. The only survivors of these conflicts were Adams and Ned Young, who had subsequently died of asthma in 1800. No action was taken against Adams.|$|E
5|$|Corvus was {{recognized}} as a constellation by several <b>Polynesian</b> cultures. In the Marquesas Islands, it was called Mee; in Pukapuka, it was called Te Manu, and in the Society Islands, it was called Metua-ai-papa. To Torres Strait Islanders, Corvus was the right hand (holding kupa fruit) of the huge constellation Tagai, a man fishing.|$|E
5|$|Even though Agatha passed {{close to}} Mexico as it weakened, no impact {{is known to}} have been caused. Waves caused by Agatha did impact a ship called the <b>Polynesian</b> Diakan. A Greek {{freighter}} en route from Pago Pago to Terminal Island, California, the <b>Polynesian</b> Diakan began flooding on June 3, forcing the 32-man crew to abandon the vessel. The exact cause of the initial flooding was unknown, but was speculated to be primarily due to cargo shifting and not the weather. The crew was rescued by the United States Coast Guard. Three members required hospitalization. After being reached on June 6 by a tugboat in a salvage attempt, the vessel capsized and sank near San Clemente Island on June 7, taking its multimillion-dollar cargo of 71 containers of canned tuna with it. The reason for the sinking was unknown.|$|E

40|$|Rearrangements {{involving}} {{genes of}} the alpha- and beta-globin loci were frequently detected in DNA from <b>Polynesians.</b> A founder effect and genetic drift occurring 2, 000 - 3, 000 {{years ago as}} <b>Polynesians</b> migrated eastward across the Pacific is proposed as the likely mechanism for these genetic changes that include deletions or additions of alpha-, gamma-, and zeta-globin genes and an unusual {{restriction fragment length polymorphism}} (RFLP) associated with the zeta gene. Preliminary data show different frequencies for gene rearrangements between island groups. Further study of these differences should provide additional information on the prehistory of <b>Polynesians...</b>|$|R
