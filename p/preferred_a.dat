5|$|In the air, {{there were}} also two {{competing}} designs, originating from groups of different backgrounds and needs. The Army Signal Corps, representing military aviators, <b>preferred</b> <b>a</b> solution based on a stream of audio navigation signals, constantly fed into the pilots' ears via a headset. Civilian pilots on the other hand, who were mostly airmail pilots flying cross-country to deliver the mail, felt the audio signals would be annoying and difficult to use over long flights, and <b>preferred</b> <b>a</b> visual solution, with an indicator in the instrument panel.|$|E

5|$|After {{her husband}} fell into captivity, Constance {{announced}} her intention {{to administer the}} principality, but most Antiochene noblemen <b>preferred</b> <b>a</b> male ruler. BaldwinIII of Jerusalem hurried to Antioch and declared Constance's fifteen-year-old son, Bohemond III, the lawful prince, charging Patriarch Aimery with {{the administration of the}} principality. Constance did not accept Baldwin's decision and protested against it to Emperor Manuel.|$|E
5|$|Colonel Moor quickly apologized. While General Ewing {{respected}} {{the discipline of}} the German regiment, he <b>preferred</b> <b>a</b> different atmosphere in his own command, better suited to Americans. He was capable of recognizing the military tradition of other units while accommodating {{the unique needs of}} his own. General Ewing was ordered to North Carolina in 1865, and was planning an expedition up the Roanoke river to co-operate with the Army of the James, when Lee surrendered.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} years of the 1960s the Australian Army and Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) {{considered}} new types of tactical transport aircraft to replace the RAAF's obsolete Douglas Dakotas. The Army wanted a simple and rugged aircraft that could be purchased immediately, and pressed for the acquisition of de Havilland Canada DHC-4 Caribous, but the RAAF regarded the Caribou as inadequate for the role and <b>preferred</b> <b>a</b> more sophisticated aircraft, leading to delays in the selection process.|$|E

5|$|If the Annals of Inisfallen {{is to be}} believed, Toirdelbach {{acquired}} {{possession of}} Dublin when the Dubliners themselves offered him its kingship. Although this record may be mere Uí Briain propaganda, it could instead reveal that the Dubliners <b>preferred</b> <b>a</b> distant overlord from Munster rather than one from neighbouring Leinster. Within the year, the kingship was held by Gofraid mac Amlaíb meic Ragnaill (died 1075). The latter {{appears to have been}} a kinsman of Echmarcach, and may well have been handed the kinship by Toirdelbach, perhaps on account of the considerable distance between the kingdoms.|$|E
5|$|In general, apeomyines are a {{widespread}} but generally rare group of dentally distinctive eomyids with a tendency towards large size. Fejfar and colleagues suggested that apeomyines were ecologically distinct from other eomyids and probably <b>preferred</b> <b>a</b> drier habitat. Although other scientists recognized Apeomyinae as a subfamily, in a 2008 summary of North American eomyids, Lawrence Flynn placed {{the group as}} a tribe, Apeomyini, within the subfamily Eomyinae. Flynn described Apeomyoides as the most derived apeomyine.|$|E
5|$|Isidore van Kinsbergen {{was known}} as a perfectionist. During his work in Borobudur, he {{selected}} the statues and panels which had been preserved best to take pictures of. He <b>preferred</b> <b>a</b> non-frontal angle, which shows a better depth of the relief and the skills of the relief maker. To stress its timeless beauty, van Kinsbergen blocked out the original background in the negative film instead of putting up a black curtain during photographing.|$|E

50|$|Chronotype {{refers to}} the {{behavioral}} manifestation of underlying circadian rhythms of myriad physical processes. A person's chronotype is the propensity for the individual to sleep {{at a particular time}} during a 24-hour period. 'Eveningness' (delayed sleep period) and 'morningness' (advanced sleep period) are the two extremes with most individuals having some flexibility in the timing of their sleep period. However, across development there are changes in the propensity of the sleep period with pre-pubescent children <b>preferring</b> <b>an</b> advanced sleep period, adolescents <b>preferring</b> <b>a</b> delayed sleep period and many elderly <b>preferring</b> <b>an</b> advanced sleep period.|$|R
50|$|The polyamory {{community}} is {{better suited for}} couples who <b>prefer</b> <b>a</b> polyamorous style of open marriage. The swinging {{community is}} better suited for couples who <b>prefer</b> <b>a</b> swinging style of open marriage. However, some couples {{may not have a}} strong preference for either style of open marriage. These couples may feel equally at home in both the Polyamory community and the Swinging community. The partners within a couple may also differ in their preferences. One partner may <b>prefer</b> <b>a</b> polyamorous style of open marriage and participate in the Polyamory community, while the other partner may <b>prefer</b> <b>a</b> swinging style of open marriage and participate in the swinging community. Variations in couple preferences and individual preferences thus result in a certain amount of overlap between the polyamory and swinging communities.|$|R
5|$|Soon {{after his}} elevation, Basiliscus had {{despatched}} Illus {{and his brother}} Trocundus against Zeno, who, now in his native fortresses, had resumed {{the life of an}} Isaurian chieftain. Basiliscus, however, failed to fulfill the promises he made to the two generals; furthermore, they received letters from some of the leading ministers at the court, urging them to secure the return of Zeno, for the city now <b>preferred</b> <b>a</b> restored Isaurian to a Miaphysite whose unpopularity increased with the fiscal rapacity of his ministers.|$|E
5|$|The {{tactical}} {{approaches of}} the two sides were cancelling each other out. Real's slow pace interspersed with high speed bursts, while Liverpool <b>preferred</b> <b>a</b> more deliberate approach, keeping possession and making use of their wingers. Their various forms of marking also negated each other, Real man marked Liverpool's best players such as Dalglish and Souness, while Liverpool were content for the nearest defender to mark {{the man on the}} ball.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the 1950s, {{the most}} popular kind of country music was the Nashville Sound, which was a slick and pop-oriented style. Many musicians <b>preferred</b> <b>a</b> rougher sound, leading to the {{development}} of the Lubbock Sound and Bakersfield Sound. The Bakersfield Sound was innovated in Bakersfield, California in the mid to late 1950s, by performers like Wynn Stewart, who used elements of Western swing and rock, such as the breakbeat, along with a honky tonk vocal style. He was followed by a wave of performers like Buck Owens and Merle Haggard, who popularized the style.|$|E

5|$|William Morton Wheeler {{comments}} that P. longiceps were possibly an arboreal nesting species. This means the ant {{did not live}} in the soil and nested in trees instead. He assumed this due to its long legs, strong claws and long mandibles; Prionomyrmex was also assumed to be predacious, equipped with a well developed and powerful sting that was most likely used to kill prey. Prionomyrmex may have <b>preferred</b> <b>a</b> jungle habitat at low elevations, and is even more primitive in its body structure than Myrmecia. Female stylopids were known to parasite Prionomyrmex ants.|$|E
5|$|After Prussia {{expressed}} an interest in the ship, the Emperor of France, Napoleon III, bought her in April for 2.5 million dollars over the objections of his own navy, which <b>preferred</b> <b>a</b> home-built ship. The exact date of purchase is unknown, but Welles noted in his diary on 7 May that Webb had told him of the sale. On 27 June, Webb refunded the money that had been paid to him and also purchased those items furnished by the government. A little over a week later, he attempted to sail to France, but had to return to port the following day due to engine problems. These were not resolved until 19 July when he, and his entire family, set sail. Dunderberg arrived at Cherbourg on 3 August and the French Navy took possession three days later.|$|E
5|$|After his retirement, San Martín {{intended}} {{to live in}} Cuyo. Although the war of independence had ended in the region, the Argentine Civil Wars continued. The unitarians wanted to organize {{the country as a}} unitary state centered on Buenos Aires, and the federals, who <b>preferred</b> <b>a</b> federation of provinces. San Martín had good relations with the federal caudillos and a personal feud with unitarian leader Bernardino Rivadavia, but tried to stay neutral. San Martín's wife, María de los Remedios de Escalada, died in 1823, so he returned to Buenos Aires. He took his daughter Mercedes Tomasa, who was living with her mother's family, and sailed to Europe.|$|E

5|$|Baseball {{had been}} {{governed by a}} three-man National Commission, {{consisting}} of American League President Ban Johnson, National League President John Heydler and Cincinnati Reds owner Garry Herrmann. In January 1920, Herrmann left office {{at the request of}} other club owners, leaving the Commission effectively deadlocked between Johnson and Heydler. A number of club owners, disliking one or both league presidents, <b>preferred</b> <b>a</b> single commissioner to rule over the game, but were willing to see the National Commission continue if Herrmann was replaced by someone who would provide strong leadership. Landis's name was mentioned in the press for this role, and the influential baseball newspaper The Sporting News sought his appointment.|$|E
5|$|Consolidated Edison {{provides}} {{electric power}} {{and natural gas}} to the village, and the Briarcliff Manor Department of Public Works supplies water from the Catskill Aqueduct to the village's water system. The department also maintains the sewer system, village vehicles, roads, and grounds, operates a recycling center, and removes snow. In 2012 the village tied for fourth place (out of 48 Westchester municipalities) {{in the percentage of}} recycled waste (71percent, above the county average of 52percent). The department, primarily rooted in the 1941 sale of Walter Law's Briarcliff Table Water Company, began with a state-mandated street commissioner. The commissioner in 1914 was Arthur Brown; asked by village officials if he needed an automobile, Brown replied that he <b>preferred</b> <b>a</b> horse but would use an automobile if the village purchased it (it did not). The department has about thirty vehicles and employs twenty-nine people.|$|E
5|$|During {{and after}} the debates over church government, the Assembly framed other {{documents}} which did not cause open rifts. The Directory for Public Worship, which was to replace the Book of Common Prayer, was swiftly written in 1644 and passed by Parliament on 3January 1645. The Directory, accepted by the Scots as well, took a middle course between the presbyterians and congregationalists. The presbyterians {{for the most part}} <b>preferred</b> <b>a</b> fixed liturgy while congregationalists favoured extemporaneous prayer. The Directory consisted of an order for services with sample prayers. The Assembly also recommended a psalter, translated by Francis Rous for use in worship.|$|E
