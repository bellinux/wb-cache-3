5|$|It is {{not known}} whether pterosaurs practiced any form of parental care, but their ability to fly {{as soon as they}} emerged from the egg and the {{numerous}} flaplings found in environments far from nests and alongside adults has led most researchers, including Christopher Bennett and David Unwin, to conclude that the young were dependent on their <b>parents</b> <b>for</b> {{a relatively short period of}} time, during a period of rapid growth while the wings grew long enough to fly, and then left the nest to fend for themselves, possibly within days of hatching. Alternatively, they may have used stored yolk products for nourishment during their first few days of life, as in modern reptiles, rather than depend on <b>parents</b> <b>for</b> food.|$|E
5|$|Many {{parenting}} schedules {{for joint}} physical custody provide for a more equal time share between <b>parents.</b> <b>For</b> example, parents may choose a form of alternating custody, pursuant to which the children live {{for a period of}} time with one parent, and then for a similar amount of time with the other parent.|$|E

Dyslexia eventually became the central topic and theme of the film.

5|$|Laying {{takes place}} in September and October. A clutch {{of four or five}} white and {{slightly}} shiny eggs, measuring 30 x 24mm, is laid. The incubation period has been recorded as anywhere from 19 to 23 days, with the female performing this duty alone. Newly hatched chicks are covered with long white down, and are largely helpless (nidicolous). They leave the nest four to five weeks after hatching and join up with other young birds in flocks, though rely on their <b>parents</b> <b>for</b> food for another fortnight after fledging.|$|E
5|$|Mating {{has been}} {{observed}} to {{take place at the}} end of the dry season, in early November, and births were inferred between late February and early March. Only one infant is born per season, despite females having two pairs of nipples. Infants are initially parked in unguarded tree holes while the mother forages. Older infants have not been observed clinging to the mother, and as they get older, they are parked in vegetation until they can move independently. Females produce milk for two years following the birth of the young. The offspring may remain under the care of their <b>parents</b> <b>for</b> three years or more, and there is no information about their dispersal at maturity. Females have not been observed giving birth in consecutive years.|$|E
