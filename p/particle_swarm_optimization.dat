40|$|Abstract The paper extends our {{pervious}} work on solving multi-contingency transient stability constrained optimal {{power flow}} problems (MC-TSCOPF) with {{the approach of}} <b>particles</b> <b>swarm</b> <b>optimization</b> (PSO). A hybrid PSO method that incorporates with a new wavelet theory based mutation operation, intends to improve the searching strategies on previously used PSO methods, is proposed to solve MC-TSCOPF problems. It employs wavelet theory in enhancing PSO methods in exploring solution spaces more effectively and robustly in reaching better solutions. A case study on the New England 39 -bus system indicates that the proposed hybrid PSO outperforms significantly existing PSO methods in terms of solution quality and stability. As a result, reasonable solutions can be reached with faster convergence speeds and smaller computational efforts.

25|$|<b>Particle</b> <b>swarm</b> <b>optimization</b> {{is another}} {{algorithm}} widely used {{to solve problems}} related to swarms. It was developed in 1995 by Kennedy and Eberhart and was first aimed at simulating the social behaviour and choreography of bird flocks and fish schools. The algorithm was simplified and it was observed to be performing optimization. The system initially seeds a population with random solutions. It then searches in the problem space through successive generations using stochastic optimization {{to find the best}} solutions. The solutions it finds are called particles. Each particle stores its position as well as the best solution it has achieved so far. The particle swarm optimizer tracks the best local value obtained so far by any particle in the local neighbourhood. The remaining particles then move through the problem space following the lead of the optimum particles. At each time iteration, the particle swarm optimiser accelerates each particle toward its optimum locations according to simple mathematical rules. <b>Particle</b> <b>swarm</b> <b>optimization</b> has been applied in many areas. It has few parameters to adjust, and a version that works well for a specific applications can also work well with minor modifications across a range of related applications.

Four of the five moons of Pluto rotate chaotically. In quantum physics and electrical engineering, the study of large arrays of Josephson junctions benefitted greatly from chaos theory.

2500|$|With an ACO algorithm, the {{shortest}} path in a graph, between two points A and B, is built {{from a combination}} of several paths. It is not easy to give a precise definition of what algorithm is or is not an ant colony, because the definition may vary according to the authors and uses. Broadly speaking, ant colony algorithms are regarded as populated metaheuristics with each solution represented by an ant moving in the search space. Ants mark the best solutions and take account of previous markings to optimize their search. They can be seen as probabilistic multi-agent algorithms using a probability distribution to make the transition between each iteration. In their versions for combinatorial problems, they use an iterative construction of solutions. According to some authors, the thing which distinguishes ACO algorithms from other relatives (such as algorithms to estimate the distribution or <b>particle</b> <b>swarm</b> <b>optimization)</b> is precisely their constructive aspect. In combinatorial problems, {{it is possible that the}} best solution eventually be found, even though no ant would prove effective. Thus, in the example of the Travelling salesman problem, it is not necessary that an ant actually travels {{the shortest}} route: the shortest route can be built from the strongest segments of the best solutions. However, this definition can be problematic in the case of problems in real variables, where no structure of 'neighbours' exists. The collective behaviour of social insects remains a source of inspiration for researchers. The wide variety of algorithms (for optimization or not) seeking self-organization in biological systems has led to the concept of [...] "swarm intelligence", which is a very general framework in which ant colony algorithms fit.|$|E
