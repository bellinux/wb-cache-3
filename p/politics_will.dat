2500|$|Ekmeleddin İhsanoğlu was {{announced}} as the joint {{candidate of the}} Republican People's Party (CHP) and the Nationalist Movement Party (MHP) on 16 June 2014. The decision drew criticism from many CHP supporters due to his former role as Secretary General of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, which {{some members of the}} CHP saw as an organisation which lacked secular and Kemalist credentials. An opinion poll on show of 23 Juneed that only 32% of CHP supporters were happy with their party's choice of candidate, compared to 75% of MHP supporters. Meanwhile, 68% of CHP supporters were dissatisfied with the decision, compared to only 25% of MHP supporters. In response to the controversy over his secular credentials, İhsanoğlu stated on 26 June that he thought of Mustafa Kemal Atatürk as a [...] "national hero" [...] and that he had defended secularism in many of his books. On 4 July, he stated that he is [...] "not an enemy of Atatürk," [...] and that [...] "incorporating religion into <b>politics</b> <b>will</b> lead to trouble." [...] Former CHP leader Deniz Baykal, who was seen as a potential CHP nominee, criticised İhsanoğlu's candidacy, stating that the CHP and MHP should have held a vote amongst their members to choose a candidate.|$|E

60|$|Then {{of course}} there was more fighting, as every one knew would happen, except the British Colonial Office; indeed all Zululand ran with blood.

60|$|The {{only way}} which the author's {{principles}} leave for our escape, is to reverse our condition into that of France, {{and to take}} her losing cards into our hands. But though his principles drive him to it, his <b>politics</b> <b>will</b> not suffer him to walk on this ground. Talking at our ease and of other countries, we may bear to be diverted with such speculations; but in England we shall never be taught to look upon the annihilation of our trade, the ruin of our credit, the defeat of our armies, {{and the loss of}} our ultramarine dominions (whatever the author may think of them), to be the high road to prosperity and greatness.|$|E
6000|$|Lively Woman is indeed, as Carlyle {{would put}} it, [...] "hellbent" [...] on {{purification}} of politics by adding {{herself as an}} ingredient. It {{is unlikely that the}} injection of her personality into the contention (and politics is essentially a contention) will allay any animosities, sweeten any tempers, elevate any motives. The strifes of women are distinctly meaner than those of men--which are out of all reason mean; their methods of overcoming opponents distinctly more unscrupulous. That their participation in <b>politics</b> <b>will</b> notably alter the conditions of the game is not to be denied; that, unfortunately, is obvious; but that it will make the player less malignant and the playing more honorable is a proposition in support of which one can utter a deal of gorgeous nonsense, with a less insupportable sense of its unfitness, than in the service of any other delusion.|$|E
6000|$|... "Madame Chevreuse's party {{consists}} {{largely of}} herself. She is a power, but at present {{no one can}} say with whom she will ally herself. Hitherto she has been simply anti-Richelieu, and was his most troublesome and bitter enemy; and I should say that not improbably she will at once begin to conspire against Mazarin as she did against him. She has been the queen's greatest ally; but then the queen was always a bitter enemy of Richelieu, whereas at present it is supposed that she is strongly in favour of Mazarin. In a few months the situation will clear itself, parties will become defined. No doubt Enghien's victory will add to the power and importance of Conde, who is already dangerously strong; then matters will become interesting. At present the situation is somewhat chaotic, and <b>politics</b> <b>will</b> not be openly and generally discussed, simply because no one knows what anyone else's opinion may be." ...|$|E

6000|$|As {{these two}} kinds of men appear {{principal}} leaders in all the late transactions, their junction and <b>politics</b> <b>will</b> serve to account, not upon any principles of law or of policy, but as a cause, for the general fury with which all the landed property of ecclesiastical corporations has been attacked, and the great care which, contrary to their pretended principles, has been taken of a moneyed interest originating from {{the authority of the}} crown. All the envy against wealth and power was artificially directed against other descriptions of riches. On what other principle than that which I have stated can we account for an appearance so extraordinary and unnatural as that of the ecclesiastical possessions, which had stood so many successions of ages and shocks of civil violences, and were guarded at once by justice and by prejudice, being applied to the payment of debts comparatively recent, invidious, and contracted by a decried and subverted government? ...|$|E

You wouldn't have thought mild little Gus could be so bloodthirsty, would you? Shows what party <b>politics</b> <b>will</b> do for a man.

Our sources of intelligence are such as cannot, by any possibility, be made public--and, indeed, such as no other London or European journal could, by any chance, acquire. But this we are free to say, that the very earliest information connected with the movement of English and Continental <b>politics</b> <b>will</b> be found only in the columns of the Pall Mall Gazette, The Statesman and the Capitalist, the Country Gentleman and the Divine, will be amongst our readers, because our writers are amongst them. We address ourselves to the higher circles of society: we care not to disown it--the Pall Mall Gazette is written by gentlemen for gentlemen; its conductors speak to the classes in which they live and were born.

60|$|I {{am aware}} that this theory of <b>politics</b> <b>will</b> seem to many to be stilted, overstrained, and, as the Americans would say, high-faluten. Many will declare that the {{majority}} even of those who call themselves politicians,--perhaps even of those who take {{an active part in}} politics,--are stirred by no such feelings as these, and acknowledge no such motives. Men become Tories or Whigs, Liberals or Conservatives, partly by education,--following their fathers,--partly by chance, partly as openings come, partly in accordance with the bent of their minds, but still without any far-fetched reasonings as to distances and the diminution of distances. No doubt it is so; and in the battle of politics, as it goes, men are led further and further away from first causes, till at last a measure is opposed by one simply because it is advocated by another, and Members of Parliament swarm into lobbies, following the dictation of their leaders, and not their own individual judgments. But the principle is at work throughout. To many, though hardly acknowledged, it is still apparent. On almost all it has its effect; though there are the intriguers, the clever conjurers, to whom politics is simply such a game as is billiards or rackets, only played with greater results. To the minds that create and lead and sway political opinion, some such theory is, I think, ever present.|$|E
60|$|The {{time will}} soon {{come when the}} mere {{common-sense}} of Dickens, like the mere common-sense of Macaulay (though his was poisoned by learning and Whig <b>politics),</b> <b>will</b> appear to give a plainer and therefore truer picture {{of the mass of}} history than the mystical perversity of a man of genius writing only out of his own temperament, like Carlyle or Taine. If a man has a new theory of ethics there is one thing he must not be allowed to do. Let him give laws on Sinai, let him dictate a Bible, let him fill the world with cathedrals if he can. But he must not be allowed to write a history of England; or a history of any country. All history was conducted on ordinary morality: with his extraordinary morality he is certain to read it all askew. Thus Carlyle tries to write of the Middle Ages with a bias against humility and mercy; that is, with a bias against the whole theoretic morality of the Middle Ages. The result is that he turns into a mere turmoil of arrogant German savages what was really the most complete and logical, if not the highest, of human civilisations. Historically speaking, it is better to be Dickens than to be this; better to be ignorant, provincial, slap-dash, seeing only the passing moment, but in that moment, to be true to eternal things.|$|E
