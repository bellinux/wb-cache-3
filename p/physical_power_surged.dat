50|$|All <b>physical</b> <b>Power</b> <b>Surges,</b> except one, {{involved}} players performing {{tasks in}} order to reveal pieces to a picture. After the team completed the <b>Power</b> <b>Surge,</b> they were given one chance to guess what the picture was for $40; {{failure to do so}} earned $40 for the opposing team. The games continued until all nine numbers were revealed, time ran out, or a team ran out of objects.|$|R

50|$|<b>Power</b> <b>Surge</b> is a high-impact thrill ride {{designed}} by Italian ride manufacturer Zamperla. The <b>Power</b> <b>Surge</b> was first operated in 1999, and {{is produced in}} both trailer-mounted and park versions. Zamperla recommends that riders be 48 inches (122 cm) or taller; however, 52 inches (132 cm) is more common.|$|R
50|$|<b>Power</b> <b>Surge</b> was a DC Comics {{event in}} 2002 {{intended}} {{to promote the}} start of The Power Company, a new comic book series by writer Kurt Busiek, who also wrote all seven issues of <b>Power</b> <b>Surge.</b> <b>Power</b> <b>Surge</b> was composed of seven eponymous one-shot issues (although each story had its own title), each highlighting {{one of the seven}} primary members of the Power Company. Each story prominently featured the involvement of a classic, already-famous comic book character (with the 'classic' character looming much larger on the cover than the book's nominal main character).|$|R
50|$|Pictures {{in round}} two were worth $75, with {{incorrect}} guesses still costing $20, and one <b>Power</b> <b>Surge</b> {{was on the}} board. This time the <b>Power</b> <b>Surges</b> were played at center stage and involved the players doing some sort of physical activity in order to reveal pieces of a picture puzzle.|$|R

50|$|At {{various points}} in the game the teams would uncover <b>Power</b> <b>Surges</b> {{randomly}} hidden on the board. In round one, a square that hid one allowed the team to play a bonus game for a chance at $20 and see an actual {{piece of the puzzle}} instead of the connected dots. There were two of these hidden in each picture and every <b>Power</b> <b>Surge</b> in the round involved some sort of knowledge-based activity.|$|R

50|$|The key {{distinction}} {{is that a}} warranty strictly covers defects in workmanship and materials, while service plans cover product failure in general {{with a list of}} exclusions. While the exclusion list includes most situations that would disqualify a product from warranty coverage, there are things that fall outside the product's condition that aren't excluded, such as <b>power</b> <b>surges.</b> However, this is offset by the infrequency of covered conditions, and misinterpretation. For example, a lightning strike is considered an environmental cause, and consequently is excluded from most service plans, even if they claim <b>power</b> <b>surge</b> protection.|$|R

25|$|Initial reports {{suggested}} that a <b>power</b> <b>surge</b> on the Underground power grid had caused explosions in power circuits. This was later ruled out by power suppliers National Grid. Commentators {{suggested that}} the explanation had been made because of bomb damage to power lines along the tracks; the rapid series of power failures caused by the explosions (or power being ended by means of switches at the locations to permit evacuation) looked similar, {{from the point of}} view of a control room operator, to a cascading series of circuit breaker operations that would result from a major <b>power</b> <b>surge.</b> A couple of hours after the bombings, Home Secretary Charles Clarke confirmed the incidents were terrorist attacks.|$|R
40|$|This {{document}} presents {{recommendations for}} electromagnetic operating envelopes to augment test criteria and test methods addressing electromagnetic interference (EMI), radio-frequency interference (RFI), and <b>power</b> <b>surges</b> that are applicable to safety-related {{instrumentation and control}} (I and C) systems in nuclear power plants. The Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) was engaged by the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) Office of Nuclear Regulatory Research to assist in developing the technical basis for regulatory guidance on EMI/RFI immunity and <b>power</b> <b>surge</b> withstand capability (SWC). Previous research has provided recommendations on electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) design and installation practices, endorsement of EMI/RFI immunity and SWC test criteria and test methods, and determination of ambient electromagnetic conditions at nuclear power plants. The present research involves development of recommended electromagnetic envelopes that are applicable to nuclear power plant locations where safety-related I and C systems either are or may be installed. These recommended envelopes establish both emissions criteria and the levels of radiated and conducted interference that I and C systems {{should be able to}} withstand without upset or malfunction. The EMI/RFI operating envelopes are derived from conditions in comparable military environments and are confirmed by comparison with the nuclear power plant electromagnetic environment based on measured plant emissions profiles. Detailed information on specific <b>power</b> <b>surge</b> conditions in nuclear power plants is not available, so industrial guidance on representative surge characteristics for susceptibility testing is adopted. An engineering assessment of the <b>power</b> <b>surge</b> environment in nuclear power plants leads to the recommendation of operating envelopes based on location categories and exposure levels defined in IEEE Std C 62. 41 - 1991, IEEE Recommended Practice on Surge Voltages in Low-Voltage AC Power Circuits...|$|R
