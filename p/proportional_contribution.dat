40|$|Soil {{carbon in}} {{permafrost}} ecosystems {{has the potential}} to become a major positive feedback to climate change if permafrost thaw increases heterotrophic decomposition. However, warming can also stimulate autotrophic production leading to increased ecosystem carbon storage-a negative climate change feedback. Few studies partitioning ecosystem respiration examine decadal warming effects or compare responses among ecosystems. Here, we first examined how 11 years of warming during different seasons affected autotrophic and heterotrophic respiration in a bryophyte-dominated peatland in Abisko, Sweden. We used natural abundance radiocarbon to partition ecosystem respiration into autotrophic respiration, associated with production, and heterotrophic decomposition. Summertime warming decreased the age of carbon respired by the ecosystem due to increased <b>proportional</b> <b>contributions</b> from autotrophic and young soil respiration and decreased <b>proportional</b> <b>contributions</b> from old soil. Summertime warming's large effect was due to not only warmer air temperatures during the growing season, but also to warmer deep soils year-round. Second, we compared ecosystem respiration responses between two contrasting ecosystems, the Abisko peatland and a tussock-dominated tundra in Healy, Alaska. Each ecosystem had two different timescales of warming (< 5 years and over a decade). Despite the Abisko peatland having greater ecosystem respiration and larger contributions from heterotrophic respiration than the Healy tundra, both systems responded consistently to short- and long-term warming with increased respiration, increased autotrophic contributions to ecosystem respiration, and increased ratios of autotrophic to heterotrophic respiration. We did not detect an increase in old soil carbon losses with warming at either site. If increased autotrophic respiration is balanced by increased primary production, {{as is the case in}} the Healy tundra, warming will not cause these ecosystems to become growing season carbon sources. Warming instead causes a persistent shift from heterotrophic to more autotrophic control of the growing season carbon cycle in these carbon-rich permafrost ecosystems...|$|R

40|$|Summary. Stable isotope {{sourcing}} is used {{to estimate}} <b>proportional</b> <b>contributions</b> of sources to a mixture, {{such as in the}} analysis of animal diets and plant nutrient use. Statistical methods for inference on the diet proportions by using stable isotopes have focused on the linear mixing model. Existing frequentist methods assume that the diet proportion vector can be uniquely solved for in terms of one or two isotope ratios. We develop large sample methods that apply to an arbitrary number of isotope ratios, assuming that the linear mixing model has a unique solution or is overconstrained. We generalize these methods to allow temporal modelling of the population mean diet, assuming that isotope ratio response data are collected over time. The methodology is motivated by a study of the diet of dunlin, a small migratory seabird...|$|R

Preston used life tables from 43 national populations, including both developed countries such as United States and England and developing countries such as Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Guatemal, México, Panama, Taiwan, Trinidad and Tobago, and Venezuela. He used multiple linear regression to analyze the cause-specific-age-standardized death rates by sex. The estimated slopes represented the <b>proportional</b> <b>contribution</b> of each cause to a unit change in the total mortality rate. With the exception of neoplasms in both sexes and cardiovascular disease in males, all of the estimated slopes were positive and statistically significant.

The major causes accounting for the decline were all infectious and parasitic diseases.|$|E

Against this, the over-taxed lower estates protested, and the Diet had to be suspended. The king intervened, not to quell the commons, as the senate insisted, but to compel the nobility to give way.

40|$|Fine {{sediment}} supply {{has been}} identified as an important factor contributing to the initiation of runoff-generated debris flows after fire. However, despite the significance of fines for post-fire debris flow generation, no investigations have sought to quantify sources of this material in debris flow affected catchments. In this study, we employ fallout radionuclides ((CS) -C- 137, Pb- 210 (ex) and Pu- 239,Pu- 240) as tracers to measure <b>proportional</b> <b>contributions</b> of fine sediment (< 10 mu m) from hillslope surface and channel bank sources to levee and terminal fan deposits formed by post-fire debris flows in two forest catchments in southeastern Australia. While Cs- 137 and Pb- 210 (ex) have been widely used in sediment tracing studies, application of Pu as a tracer represents a recent development and was limited to only one catchment. The ranges in estimated <b>proportional</b> hillslope surface <b>contributions</b> of fine sediment to individual debris flow deposits in each catchment were 22 - 69 % and 32 - 74 %. The greater susceptibility of Pb- 210 (ex) to apparent reductions in the ash content of channel deposits relative to hillslope sources resulted in its exclusion from the final analysis. No systematic change in the <b>proportional</b> source <b>contributions</b> to debris flow deposits was observed with distance downstream from channel initiation points. Instead, spatial variability in source contributions was largely influenced by the pattern of debris flow surges forming the deposits. Linking the tracing analysis with interpretation of depositional evidence allowed reconstruction of temporal sequences in sediment source contributions to debris flow surges. Hillslope source inputs dominated most elevated channel deposits such as marginal levees that were formed under peak flow conditions. This indicated the importance of hillslope runoff and fine sediment supply for debris flow generation in both catchments. In contrast, material stored within channels that was deposited during subsequent surges was predominantly channel-derived. The results demonstrate that fallout radionuclide tracers may provide unique information on changing source contributions of fine sediment during debris flow events. (C) 2011 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|This paper analyses, on an {{individual}} plant basis, the various components determining seed production in the evergreen shrub Lavandula latifolia (Labiatae), in order to estimate their relative contributions to individual differences in fecundity. The relationships between fecundity and age, size, and growth rate are also examined. Experimental pollination and watering were done {{in an attempt to}} alter natural patterns of partial fecundity components. Fecundity of individual plants is partitioned into its absolute (number of inflorescences, number of flowers per inflorescence) and relative (fruits/flower and seeds/fruit) partial components, and the following questions are addressed: (1) Are the individual differences in relative components of fecundity? (2) What are the <b>proportional</b> <b>contributions</b> of relative and absolute components of fecundity to individual variation in seed production? (3) Are relative measures of reproductive success reliable predictors of individual differences in fecundity? (4) When induced experimentally, do changes in partial fecundity components translate into modifications of the population's ranking of absolute fecundities? Fecundity depended more on plant size than age, was unrelated to growth rate, and was limited by water, but not pollen, availability. Individual plants differed in all components of fecundity examined, and differences were consistent among years. The <b>proportional</b> <b>contributions</b> of the various components to individual differences in fecundity were very unequal. Almost all variation among plants in seed production (° 90 % of variance) was explained by the variances and covariances of number of inflorescences and number of flowers per inflorescence. Variation among plants in the two relative components (fruit and seed set), even though statistically significant, had a negligible influence on individual differences in fecundity. These patterns remained invariant despite significant modification of flower production and fruit set induced by artificially watering a part of the study population. Fruit and seed set alone are unreliable indicators of individual differences in the maternal component of fitness in L. latifolia, and a review of relevant literature indicates that this probably applies to other polycarpic plants as well. Plant reproductive biology studies may make erroneous inferences if they consider exclusively data on relative fruit and seed set, and neglect the absolute components of individual differences in fecundity. It is proposed that, to circumvent these potential problems, demographic aspects and absolute estimates of seed output on a per individual basis should be examined in addition to the customarily employed fruit and seed set measures.
