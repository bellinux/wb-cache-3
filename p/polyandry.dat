5|$|The {{observation}} {{that all these}} Apis species engage in <b>polyandry</b> has led researchers to conclude that worker policing is plesiomorphic for the Apis genus.|$|E
5|$|Other mating systems, {{including}} polygyny, <b>polyandry,</b> polygamy, polygynandry, and promiscuity, also occur. Polygamous breeding systems {{arise when}} females {{are able to}} raise broods {{without the help of}} males. Some species may use more than one system depending on the circumstances.|$|E
5|$|The {{level of}} <b>polyandry</b> in the ruff {{is the highest}} known for any avian lekking species and for any shorebird. More than half of female ruffs mate with, and have {{clutches}} fertilised by, more than one male, and individual females mate with males of both main behavioural morphs more often than expected by chance. In lekking species, females can choose mates without risking the loss of support from males in nesting and rearing chicks, since the males take no part in raising the brood anyway. In the absence of this cost, if <b>polyandry</b> is advantageous, it {{would be expected to}} occur at a higher rate in lekking than among pair-bonded species.|$|E
5|$|The species Gryllus bimaculatus {{exhibits}} {{the reproductive}} pattern of <b>polyandry.</b> This sexual selective pattern increases the overall fitness {{of the species}} and promotes genetic variation. The females select and mate with multiple viable sperm donors and exhibit a distinct preference for novel mates.|$|E
5|$|In 1783, the Kodavas {{erupted in}} revolt against Tipu and threw their forces out of Coorg. In 1785, he marched into Mercara {{the capital of}} Coorg and {{addressed}} them. He showed racial and religious bias by stating that the Kodavas were guilty of <b>polyandry</b> in a speech before a gathering of Kodavas. He mistook the patrilineal patriarchal Kodavas to be a sub-group of matriarchal Nairs. He threatened {{that he would not}} revile or molest a single individual among them, but instead make Ahmadis (Muslims) out of the whole of them; transplanting them from their homeland in the Coorg to Seringapatam. This inflammatory speech with false accusations of <b>polyandry</b> and an open threat angered the Kodavas who thereafter hated Tipu and again revolted against him. Tipu seized nearly 70,000 Hindus of Coorg along with their king, Dodda Vira-Rajendra, and held them captive at Seringapatam. They were also forcibly converted to Islam and received the same harsh treatment as the Mangalorean Catholics. From 1786 until 1789, even the Nairs of Malabar were captured and deported to Seringapatam.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the gray}} mouse lemur {{displays}} multi-male, multi-female mating patterns, {{studies have shown}} that females do exhibit indirect mate selection (a form of selected <b>polyandry).</b> During the study, females would mate with 1–7 males up to 11 times during their single night of receptivity, but would avoid or counteract males that attempted to monopolize mating. Dominant males that attempt to monopolize tend to be larger and heavier individuals. Female selection however, has been shown to help increase genetic diversity among offspring.|$|E
5|$|Feminism was {{challenged}} by various minority groups for not entirely addressing {{the needs of}} minority populations. It was suggested that 'mainstream' feminism was upper caste and Hindu in its orientation and did not address the concerns of minority women. This {{led to the formation of}} the Awaaz-e-Niswaan (The Voice of Women) in 1987 in Mumbai in largely Muslim part of the city. The Muslim community has personal laws that often were considered harmful to the rights of Muslim women. The Muslim personal law allows Polygamy but not <b>Polyandry.</b>|$|E
5|$|The oribi is diurnal (active mainly {{during the}} day), though some {{activity}} {{may also be}} observed at night. The animal rests in cover during rain events. Unlike all other small antelopes, oribi can exhibit three types of mating systems, depending on the habitat – <b>polyandry,</b> polygyny and polygynandry; polygyny tends to prevail as the female-to-male ratio increases. A study suggested that polygyny is preferred in areas of high predator risk, as it leads to formation of groups as an anti-predator measure. Small herds of up to four members are also common.|$|E
5|$|After Vali's death, Sugriva acquires Vali's kingdom {{as well as}} Tara. The Ramayana {{does not}} record any formal {{marriage}} or any ritual purification—like the trial by fire Sita had to undergo when she is reacquired by Rama from Ravana—that Tara must undertake to marry Sugriva or return to Vali following his return from the dead. The lack of the description of formal marriage suggests, according to some critics, that Tara's relationship to Sugriva is neither widow re-marriage nor <b>polyandry,</b> but simply appropriation by Sugriva. In the references of the coronation of Sugriva as king, Angada is also described as the heir-apparent crown prince, while Tara is mentioned as Sugriva's wife. The Adhyatma Ramayana declares that Sugriva acquires Tara.|$|E
5|$|Colonies {{are mainly}} {{polygynous}} with polyandrous queens, however, <b>polyandry</b> in jack jumper colonies {{is low in}} comparison to other Myrmecia ants, but it is comparable to M. pyriformis ants. In 1979, Craig and Crozier investigated the genetic structure of jack jumper ant colonies, and although queens are unrelated {{to each other as}} mentioned previously, the occurrence of related queens in a single colony was possible. During colony foundation, there are suggestions of dependent colony foundation in jack jumper queens, although independent colony foundations can occur, as the queens do have fully developed wings and can fly. Isolation by distance (IBD) patterns have been recorded, specifically where nests that tend to be closer to each other were more genetically similar in comparison to other nests farther away.|$|E
5|$|Members of Picidae are {{typically}} monogamous, {{with a few}} species breeding cooperatively and some polygamy reported in a few species. <b>Polyandry,</b> where a female raises two broods with two separate males, has also {{been reported in the}} West Indian woodpecker. Another unusual social system is that of the acorn woodpecker, which is a polygynandrous cooperative breeder where groups of up to 12 individuals breed and help to raise the young. Young birds from previous years may stay behind to help raise the group's young, and studies have found reproductive success for the group goes up with group size, but individual success goes down. Birds may be forced to remain in groups {{due to a lack of}} habitat to disperse to.|$|E
5|$|Some mammals are {{perfectly}} monogamous, {{meaning that they}} mate for life and take no other partners (even after the original mate’s death), as with wolves, Eurasian beavers, and otters. There are three types of polygamy: either one or multiple dominant males have breeding rights (polygyny), multiple males that females mate with (<b>polyandry),</b> or multiple males have exclusive relations with multiple females (polygynandry). It is much more common for polygynous mating to happen, which, excluding leks, are estimated to occur in up to 90% of mammals. Lek mating occurs in harems, wherein {{one or a few}} males protect their harem of females from other males who would otherwise mate with the females, as in elephant seals; or males congregate around females and try to attract them with various courtship displays and vocalizations, as in harbor seals.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} {{different}} mating systems among teleosts. Some species are promiscuous, where {{both males and}} females breed with multiple partners and there are no obvious mate choices. This has been recorded in Baltic herring, guppies, Nassau groupers, humbug damselfish, cichlids and creole wrasses. Polygamy, where one sex has multiple partners can come in many forms. <b>Polyandry</b> consists of one adult female breeding with multiple males, which only breed with that female. This is rare among teleosts, and fish in general, but is found in the clownfish. In addition, it may also exist to an extent among anglerfish, where some females have more than one male attached to them. Polygyny, where one male breeds with multiple females, is much more common. This is recorded in sculpins, sunfish, darters, damselfish and cichlids where multiple females may visit a territorial male that guards and takes care of eggs and young. Polygyny may also involve a male guarding a harem of several females. This occurs in coral reef species, such as damselfishes, wrasses, parrotfishes, surgeonfishes, triggerfishes and tilefishes.|$|E
25|$|Fraternal <b>polyandry</b> (from the Latin frater—brother), {{also called}} adelphic <b>polyandry,</b> {{is a form}} of <b>polyandry</b> in which a woman is married to two or more men who are one another's brothers. Fraternal <b>polyandry</b> was (and {{sometimes}} still is) found in certain areas of Tibet, Nepal, and Northern India, where <b>polyandry</b> was accepted as a social practice. The Toda people of southern India practice fraternal <b>polyandry,</b> but monogamy has become prevalent recently. In contemporary Hindu society, polyandrous marriages in agrarian societies in the Malwa region of Punjab seem to occur to avoid division of farming land.|$|E
25|$|<b>Polyandry</b> in Tibet was {{a common}} {{practice}} and continues {{to a lesser extent}} today. In Tibet, <b>polyandry</b> has been outlawed since the Chinese takeover of the area in 1950, so it is difficult to measure the incidence of <b>polyandry</b> in what may have been the world's most polyandrous society. <b>Polyandry</b> in India still exists among minorities, and also in Bhutan, and the northern parts of Nepal. <b>Polyandry</b> has been practised in several parts of India, such as Rajasthan, Ladakh and Zanskar, in the Jaunsar-Bawar region in Uttarakhand, among the Toda of South India.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of {{multiple}} male mating, multiple paternities were observed in species as {{a result of}} convenience <b>polyandry.</b> Convenience <b>Polyandry</b> Hypothesis is the assumption that there is a greater cost for females when, refusing male mating attempts than in choice mating. It is the situation in which females adjust their mating rate to balance the costs of male harassment. It has been suggested that convenience <b>polyandry</b> would increase when females are weaker than males, decreasing the costs of sexual aggression. Convenience <b>polyandry</b> is seen in several arthropod species, like water striders (Gerris buenoi).|$|E
25|$|Polyandrous {{relations}} are disapproved of inmost expressions of Hinduism.There {{is at least}} one reference to <b>polyandry</b> in the ancient Hindu epic Mahabharata. Draupadi married the five Pandava brothers, as this is what she chose in a previous life. This ancient text remains largely neutral to the concept of <b>polyandry,</b> accepting this as her way of life. However, in the same epic, when questioned by Kunti to give an example of <b>polyandry,</b> Yudhishthira cites Gautam-clan Jatila (married to seven Saptarishis) and Hiranyaksha's sister Pracheti (married to ten brothers), thereby implying a more open attitude toward <b>polyandry</b> in Vedic society.|$|E
25|$|<b>Polyandry</b> is the {{practice}} wherein {{a woman has}} more than one husband at the same time. <b>Polyandry</b> is much less popular than polygyny and is illegal in virtually every state in the world. It occurs only in remote communities.|$|E
25|$|Infanticide {{avoidance}} {{is one of}} {{the major}} reason animals, like mammals, are inclined to choose <b>polyandry.</b> Infanticide is observed to be the major cause of mortality in various mammals. <b>Polyandry</b> is thought to evolve from their offspring's vulnerability to infanticide. There is evidence that <b>polyandry</b> is an effective strategy that is adapted by many to increase their offspring survival through the avoidance of male infanticide. Bank voles (Myodes glareolus) has supported the infanticide avoidance hypothesis where polyandrous females' offspring have a higher survival than monandrous females' offspring.|$|E
25|$|The female {{equivalent}} of fraternal <b>polyandry</b> is sororate marriage.|$|E
25|$|The {{lifestyles of}} the Lahauli and Spiti Bhot are similar, owing to their proximity. <b>Polyandry</b> was widely {{practiced by the}} Lahaulis in the past, {{although}} this practice has been dying out. The Spiti Bhot do not generally practice <b>polyandry</b> any more, although it is accepted in a few isolated regions.|$|E
25|$|Gough {{has gone}} further than Fuller {{with regard to}} the {{interpretation}} of events in the north, believing that {{there is no evidence of}} <b>polyandry</b> in that area at all. She argues that all European travelogues describing <b>polyandry</b> came from the region of Central Kerala. Gough notes the differing personal experiences of earlier Nair commentators and that this could go some way to explaining the varied pronouncement: Panikkar, who queries the existence of <b>polyandry,</b> comes from the northern Travancore region; that A. Aiyappan, who acknowledges its existence, comes from Central Kerala; and that both have based their writings on customs they grew up with in their very different environs.|$|E

25|$|<b>Polyandry</b> also {{occurs in}} some {{primates}} such as marmosets, {{and in the}} marsupial genus' Antechinus.|$|E
25|$|<b>Polyandry</b> is forbidden. A woman cannot {{have more}} than one husband at a time.|$|E
25|$|Guanches from Gran Canaria practized <b>polyandry</b> {{before the}} Spanish conquest. According to European accounts, during a great famine in 14th or 15th century, girls were killed after coming {{to life in}} order to {{equilibrate}} demography. This resulted in a surplus of males and a shortage of females, {{which led to the}} adoption of <b>polyandry,</b> allowing a woman to marry a maximum of five men.|$|E
25|$|In {{behavioral}} ecology, <b>polyandry</b> is a {{class of}} mating system where one female mates with several males in a breeding season. <b>Polyandry</b> is often compared to the polygyny system based on the cost and benefits incurred by members of each sex. Polygyny is where one male mates with several females in a breeding season (e.g., lions, deer, some primates, and many systems where there is an alpha male).|$|E
25|$|Nikah Ijtimah was a pagan {{tradition}} of <b>polyandry</b> in older Arab which was condemned and eradicated by Islam.|$|E
25|$|<b>Polyandry</b> {{was widely}} (and {{to some extent}} still is) practised in Lahaul-Spiti {{situated}} in isolation in the high Himalayas in India.|$|E
25|$|The {{origin of}} <b>polyandry</b> {{in nature and}} its {{adaptive}} value is a subject of ongoing controversy in evolutionary biology, {{partly due to the}} seemingly numerous costs it places on females - additional energetic and temporal allocation to reproduction, increased risk of predation, increased risk of sexually transmitted diseases and increased risk of physical harm caused by copulation/sexual coercion – for eusocial insects, the effects <b>polyandry</b> has on the colony member's coefficient of relatedness is also important, as reducing the relatedness of workers limits the power of kin selection to maintain the ultracooperative behaviours which are vital to a colonies' success. One hypothesis for the evolution of <b>polyandry</b> draws on the disease resistance that increased genetic diversity supposedly brings for a group, and a growing body of evidence from insect taxa supports this hypothesis, some of it discussed above.|$|E
25|$|The other {{practice}} {{though not}} well documented is <b>polyandry,</b> {{where a woman}} marries more than one man. Draupadi in the epic Mahabharat had five husbands: the Pandavas.|$|E
25|$|Some male {{behaviors}} {{that may have}} led to <b>polyandry</b> are displacement, where a male is gripped onto and mating with a female, another male may make an effort to mate as well and displace the male that was originally copulating; forced copulation, where there is a high density of aggressive males, and female abandonment, where a female but spots a better one to mate with and abandons the less favorable one. This can lead to sequential <b>polyandry</b> if the male leaves before the entire clutch is released and an additional male fertilizes these eggs as well. In Bibron's toadlet (Pseudophryne bibronii) females spread out their eggs across the nests of two to eight males, with those who exhibited higher levels of polyandrous behavior having higher mean offspring survivorship, showing that insurance against nest failure and dispersal of mortality risk is related to the evolution of <b>polyandry.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Polyandry</b> is {{believed}} to be more likely in societies with scarce environmental resources. It {{is believed}} to limit human population growth and enhance child survival. It is a rare form of marriage that exists not only among peasant families but also among the elite families. For example, <b>polyandry</b> in the Himalayan mountains is related to the scarcity of land. The marriage of all brothers in a family to the same wife allows family land to remain intact and undivided. If every brother married separately and had children, family land would be split into unsustainable small plots. In contrast, very poor persons not owning land were less likely to practice <b>polyandry</b> in Buddhist Ladakh and Zanskar. In Europe, the splitting up of land was prevented through the social practice of impartible inheritance. For example, disinheriting most siblings where many of whom then became celibate monks and priests.|$|E
25|$|Fraternal <b>polyandry</b> {{achieves}} a similar goal {{to that of}} primogeniture in 19th-century England. Primogeniture dictated that the eldest son inherited the family estate, while younger sons had to leave home and seek their own employment. Primogeniture maintained family estates intact over generations by permitting only one heir per generation. Fraternal <b>polyandry</b> also accomplishes this, but does so by keeping all the brothers together with just one wife {{so that there is}} only one set of heirs per generation. This strategy appears less successful the larger the fraternal sibling group.|$|E
25|$|Urukagina {{seems to}} had {{abolished}} the former custom of <b>polyandry</b> in his country, on {{pain of the}} woman taking multiple husbands being stoned with rocks upon which her crime was written.|$|E
25|$|<b>Polyandry,</b> the {{practice}} of a woman having more than one husband (even temporarily, after payment of a sum of money to the man or the man's family), by contrast, is not permitted.|$|E
