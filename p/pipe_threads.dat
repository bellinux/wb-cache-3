Based on {{the analysis of the}} sealing mechanism of <b>pipe</b> <b>thread,</b> the essence of the <b>pipe</b> <b>thread</b> loosening is caused by fretting damage and fatigue. The following three methods are used to reduce the damage: the processing requirements of internal and external screw thread tooth type and size will be improved；the deformations which are made by a screwing torque to the external thread of the material itself will fill the gap in each part after internal and external screw thread are screwed together;plasticity sealing filler are put between internal and external screw thread...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Failure of {{the drill}} <b>pipe</b> <b>thread</b> {{is always a}} very serious problem which may result in serious {{accidents}} and rework during the drilling of oil wells. Rupture crack of the drill <b>pipe</b> <b>thread</b> may result in great economic and labour losses, so they need to be inspected periodically. As the drill <b>pipe</b> <b>thread</b> is not a smooth surface and is in the end area of drill pipes, {{it is very difficult to}} be inspected by traditional Non-destructive testing (NDT) methods. According to the experiment results and the requirement of the working conditions in the field, a local MFL inspection method, which is the most adaptive inspection method, is determined. Laboratory testing and field experience show that this inspection method can detect the crack as small as 0. 6 mm (depth) in the thread root and thus reduces the risks of drilling failure. This local MFL inspection method can inspect flaws of the drill <b>pipe</b> <b>thread</b> that occur in practice exactly and quickly, and it has very wide application perspectives...|$|R

5000|$|In 1864, William Sellers, the {{president}} of Franklin Institute, presented a standard for nuts, bolts, and screws. Out of this effort came the first United States Standard threads, including <b>pipe</b> <b>threads.</b> (See also Screw thread § History of standardization.) ...|$|E
5000|$|Jointing threads: These are <b>pipe</b> <b>threads</b> where pressure-tightness is {{made through}} the mating of two threads together.

5000|$|Longscrew threads: These are {{parallel}} <b>pipe</b> <b>threads</b> used where a pressure-tight joint {{is achieved by}} the compression of a soft material (such as an o-ring seal or a washer) between the end face of the male thread and a socket or nipple face, with the tightening of a backnut.|$|E

5000|$|Both British {{standard}} and National <b>pipe</b> <b>thread</b> standards specify a thread taper of 1:16; {{the change in}} diameter is one sixteenth the distance travelled along the thread.

5000|$|Thread {{seal tape}} (also known as PTFE tape or plumber's tape) is a {{polytetrafluoroethylene}} (PTFE) film {{for use in}} sealing <b>pipe</b> <b>threads.</b> The tape is sold cut to specific widths and wound on a spool, {{making it easy to}} wind around <b>pipe</b> <b>threads.</b> It is also known by the genericised trade-name Teflon tape; while Teflon is in fact identical to PTFE, Chemours (the trade-mark holders) consider this usage incorrect, especially as they no longer manufacture Teflon in tape form. Thread seal tape lubricates allowing for a deeper seating of the threads, and it helps prevent the threads from seizing when being unscrewed. The tape also works as a deformable filler and thread lubricant, helping to seal the joint without hardening or making it more difficult to tighten, and instead making it easier to tighten.|$|E
50|$|The {{uninterrupted}} {{flow path}} of impact heads makes them {{less vulnerable to}} damage and clogging by dirt and sand in the water.

50|$|Essentially, {{the high}} energy {{repeated}} motion {{created by the}} rappers {{is the source of}} their wear. The consistent high intensity vibrations cause fatigue and wear on the rappers. Bolted joints are especially affected by this repetitive motion and must be replaced. Frequent failure of air in inlet fittings is another issue that arises from the motion. Repeated vibrations cause fittings to dull down and <b>pipe</b> <b>threads</b> break off, therefore, loosening the fittings.|$|E
