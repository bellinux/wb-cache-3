40|$|Abstract. Recent {{articles}} [6, 3, 5, 7] {{introduce the}} concept of <b>phase</b> <b>shifting</b> equivalent <b>keys</b> in stream ciphers, and exploit this concept in order to mount attacks on some specific ciphers. The idea behind <b>phase</b> <b>shifting</b> equivalent <b>keys</b> is that, for many ciphers, each internal state {{can be considered as}} the result of an injection of a key and initialization vector. This enables speeding up the standard exhaustive search algorithm among the 2 n possible keys by decreasing the constant factor of 2 n in the time complexity of the algorithm. However, this has erroneously been stated in [5, 7] as decreasing the complexity of the algorithm below 2 n. In this note, we show why this type of attacks, using <b>phase</b> <b>shifting</b> equivalent <b>keys</b> to improve exhaustive key search, can never reach time complexity below 2 n, where 2 n is the size of the key space. 1 Speeding up exhaustive search by using <b>phase</b> <b>shifting</b> equivalent <b>keys</b> In this section, we use (some of) the notations of [7]...|$|R
