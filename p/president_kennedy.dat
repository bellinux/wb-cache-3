5|$|Twenty-four {{hours after}} his arrest, King {{was allowed to}} see local {{attorneys}} from the SCLC. When Coretta Scott King did not hear from her husband, she called Walker and he suggested that she call <b>President</b> <b>Kennedy</b> directly. Mrs. King was recuperating at home {{after the birth of}} their fourth child when she received a call from <b>President</b> <b>Kennedy</b> the Monday after the arrest. The president told her she could expect a call from her husband soon. When Martin Luther King Jr. called his wife, their conversation was brief and guarded; he correctly assumed that his phones were tapped. Several days later, Jacqueline Kennedy called Coretta Scott King to express her concern for King while he was incarcerated.|$|E

25|$|Despite having {{commissioned}} William Manchester's authorized {{account of}} <b>President</b> <b>Kennedy's</b> death, The Death of a President, Jacqueline {{was subject to}} significant media attention in 1966–1967 when she and Robert Kennedy tried to block the publication. They sued publishers Harper & Row in December 1966; the suit was settled the following year when Manchester removed passages that detailed <b>President</b> <b>Kennedy's</b> private life. White viewed the ordeal as validation of the measures the Kennedy family, Jacqueline in particular, were prepared to take to preserve <b>President</b> <b>Kennedy's</b> public image.|$|R

5|$|Scales was {{the only}} {{defendant}} convicted under the membership clause.

5|$|The {{project was}} plagued with {{problems}} from the outset. The first was scope. <b>President</b> <b>Kennedy</b> had begun considering {{the structure of}} his library soon after taking office, {{and he wanted to}} include archives from his administration, a museum of personal items, and a political science institute. After the assassination, the list expanded to include a fitting memorial tribute to the slain president. The variety of necessary inclusions complicated the design process and caused significant delays.|$|E
5|$|Altgens {{shared a}} story about Billy Lovelady for No More Silence: An Oral History of the Assassination of <b>President</b> <b>Kennedy</b> (1998). Lovelady had {{contacted}} Altgens {{and asked him to}} deliver a copy of the first photograph along Elm Street. Altgens was met instead by Lovelady's wife, who said her husband would never agree to be interviewed. The couple had moved several times, but they were still being harassed by people who wanted the shirt Lovelady was wearing when Kennedy was shot.|$|E

In response, the Saudis purchased a British Thunderbird air defense system and developed their airfield in Khamis Mushayt. Riyadh also attempted to convince Washington to respond on its behalf. <b>President</b> <b>Kennedy</b> sent only a wing of jet fighters and bombers to Dhahran Airbase, demonstrating to Nasser {{the seriousness of}} American commitment to defending U.S. interests in Saudi Arabia.|$|E

He was ultimately appointed to the Eastern District of Pennsylvania by President Lyndon Johnson as a recess appointment on January 6, 1964, and was confirmed by the Senate later that year. At the time of his appointment, he was 35 years old. Higginbotham became a trustee of the University of Pennsylvania, of Yale University, and of Thomas Jefferson University.|$|E

5|$|In {{international}} affairs {{the most dramatic}} event during Douglas-Home's premiership was the assassination of <b>President</b> <b>Kennedy</b> in November 1963. Douglas-Home, clearly moved, broadcast a tribute on television. He had liked and worked well with Kennedy, and did not develop such a satisfactory relationship with Lyndon Johnson. Their governments had a serious disagreement {{on the question of}} British trade with Cuba. Under Douglas-Home the colonies of Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland gained independence, though this was as a result of negotiations led by Macleod under the Macmillan government.|$|E
5|$|John F. Kennedy {{was assassinated}} at 12:30p.m. Central Standard Time (18:30 UTC) on Friday, November 22, 1963, in Dealey Plaza, Dallas, Texas. Kennedy was fatally shot while {{traveling}} {{with his wife}} Jacqueline, Texas Governor John Connally, and the latter's wife Nellie, in a Presidential motorcade. The ten-month investigation by the Warren Commission of 1963–1964 concluded that <b>President</b> <b>Kennedy</b> was assassinated by Lee Harvey Oswald and that Oswald had acted entirely alone. It also concluded that Jack Ruby acted alone when he killed Oswald in police custody. Nonetheless, polls conducted from 1966 to 2004 found {{that as many as}} 80 percent of Americans have suspected that there was a plot or cover-up.|$|E
5|$|Kennedy {{initially}} {{opposed the}} march outright, {{because he was}} concerned it would negatively impact the drive for passage of civil rights legislation. However, the organizers were firm that the march would proceed. With the march going forward, the Kennedys decided {{it was important to}} work to ensure its success. <b>President</b> <b>Kennedy</b> was concerned the turnout would be less than 100,000. Therefore, he enlisted the aid of additional church leaders and the UAW union to help mobilize demonstrators for the cause.|$|E
