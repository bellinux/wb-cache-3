The test methods were developed for 356 mm two-sided laminated glass substrate with a magneto-optic active layer media technology.

Test methods are included for a series of different media characteristics, including operational, nonoperational, and storage environments; mechanical and physical characteristics; and substrate, recording layer, and <b>preformat</b> characteristics.

40|$|We {{describe}} {{the use of}} a reconfigurable interface board based on FPGAs and a UNIX workstation to implement a correlation tracker with 3. 8 ms latency. The correlation tracker is part of an active mirror system in use at the Swedish Vacuum Solar Telescope, La Palma, Canary Islands. The reconfigurable interface is used to leverage the workstation CPU, relieving it of tasks that it performs poorly such as rapid context switching and low-level bit manipulation. The reconfigurable interface handles control of external devices, high-performance input (16 MB/s) and data <b>preformatting.</b> The workstation CPU, a 64 -bit microprocessor, performs the bulk of the computation. For the key computations of the correlation tracker we are able to treat 8 pixels in parallel in the CPU's 64 -bit integer datapath.

We {{describe the}} design trade-offs that arose during the development o [...] ...|$|R
25|$|Reformatting an SD {{card with}} a {{different}} file system, or even with the same one, may make the card slower, or shorten its lifespan. Some cards use wear leveling, in which frequently modified blocks are mapped to different portions of memory at different times, and some wear-leveling algorithms are designed for the access patterns typical of FAT12, FAT16 or FAT32. In addition, the <b>preformatted</b> file system may use a cluster size that matches the erase region of the physical memory on the card; reformatting may change the cluster size and make writes less efficient.|$|E

5000|$|The lack of {{a formal}} system in {{traditional}} Chinese philosophy motivates {{the creation of a}} “systemic overcoat.” There is no historical narrative in Chinese philosophy similar to the one that exists in Western philosophy. [...] The material studied under the discipline of Chinese philosophy had been sifted in the early 20th century from the paradigms of classics, poetry, masters, and collected writings to create this field. [...] The academic philosophical model that is applied now to this discipline appeared only after Hu Shi’s Outline of the History of Chinese Philosophy and Feng Youlan’s History of Chinese Philosophy. [...] Both Feng Youlan and Hu Shi comprehended the lack of narrative in Chinese thought and thus proceeded to create a categorization that mirrored that of the Western paradigm. However, by <b>preformatting</b> the outline and selectively choosing material that fit, they presented a warped version of the original. [...] An accurate understanding of these texts is impossible because the original context has become obscured. The overcoat may express the concepts of Western philosophy that are present in Chinese thought, but in the process it causes an abstraction from the reality these concepts were couched in originally.|$|R

We conducted a study on Android devices by installing an instrumentation application, Device Analyzer, on participants’ handsets. Over a 4 month period we collected 10. 9 billion records from 674 different users. In this paper we describe {{how to use the}} research study features of Device Analyzer to control participant selection and to access information (with consent) that is withheld for privacy reasons from the main dataset. We describe our data processing architecture and the steps required to <b>preformat</b> and analyse the data. Our data contains 3329 distinct applications (from the Google Play store) but despite this, on average, a user makes use of only 8 unique applications in a week. Almost 100 % of our users make use of some email application on their phone. Fewer users (85 %) made use of the Facebook application but 4 – 5 times more frequently than for email with sessions lasting almost twice as long. We also investigated whether different applications have correlated usage using a network analysis and a principal component analysis. We see that application usage tends to correlate by vendor more than by activity. This is potentially due to vendors integrating or cross-promoting services between applications...|$|R

To make a good product or {{production}} processes system it is often focused on the working performance efficiency. Best practice or Benchmark is methods to focus on the best possible method to understand working processes, systems and performance ability. KPI's (Key <b>Preformats</b> Indicators) are measureable goals in all companies, this to align business activities to the vision, strategy and goals both in companies and project organizations. To achieve optimal effectiveness in large complex projects we are dealing with the execution of strategic and operational management and decisions throughout the projects lifecycles. A project is a living organization and use of change management and continues improvement techniques over the lifetime of the project will lead to improved project management and goal achievements. The EU-Project IFaCOM (Intelligent Fault Correction and Self Optimizing Manufacturing systems) has five end-user demonstrators where Zero Defect Manufacturing (ZDM) solutions are to be implemented. How to deal with un-certainty within the manufacturing processes for reaching near zero defects, in both product and process perspectives, is the main goal for the IFaCOM project. The ZDM framework is a quality controlled process system. The IFaCOM project uses ZDM concepts for manufacturing improvement. The added value for quality improvement is both a part of the continuous process improvements and the continuous improvement of product value to the costumer. Benchmarking and Best praxis methods will be used on the IFaCOM industry demonstrator implementations...|$|R

50|$|Dialysis occurs {{throughout}} {{nature and}} the principles of dialysis have been exploited by humans {{for thousands of years}} using natural animal or plant based membranes. The term dialysis was first routinely used for scientific or medical purposes in the late 1800s and early 1900s, pioneered by the work of Thomas Graham. The first mass-produced man-made membranes suitable for dialysis were not available until the 1930s based on materials used in the food packaging industry such as Cellophane. In the 1940s, Willem Kolff constructed the first dialyzer (artificial kidney), and successfully treated patients with renal failure using dialysis across semi-permeable membranes. Today, dialysis tubing for laboratory applications comes in a variety of dimensions and molecular-weight cutoffs (MWCO).

When entry is complete (or ENTER or PF key pressed on 3270's), {{a block of}} data, usually just the data entered by the operator (modified data), {{is sent to the}} host in one transmission. The 3270 terminal buffer (at the device) could be updated on a single character basis, if necessary, because of the existence of a [...] "set buffer address order" [...] (SBA), that usually preceded any data to be written/overwritten within the buffer. A complete buffer could also be read or replaced using the READ BUFFER command or WRITE Command (unformatted or formatted {{in the case of the}} 3270).|$|E

The types of Inmarsat ship earth station terminals recognized by the GMDSS are: Inmarsat B, C and F77. Inmarsat B and F77, {{an updated version of}} the now redundant Inmarsat A, provide ship/shore, ship/ship and shore/ship telephone, telex and high-speed data services, including a distress priority telephone and telex service to and from rescue coordination centers. Fleet 77 fully supports the Global Maritime Distress and Safety System (GMDSS) and includes advanced features such as emergency call prioritisation. The Inmarsat C provides ship/shore, shore/ship and ship/ship store-and-forward data and email messaging, the capability for sending <b>preformatted</b> distress messages to a rescue coordination center, and the Inmarsat C SafetyNET service. The Inmarsat C SafetyNET service is a satellite-based worldwide maritime safety information broadcast service of high seas weather warnings, NAVAREA navigational warnings, radionavigation warnings, ice reports and warnings generated by the USCG-conducted International Ice Patrol, and other similar information not provided by NAVTEX. SafetyNET works similarly to NAVTEX in areas outside NAVTEX coverage.|$|E
