5|$|In 1942, Wheeler {{recruited}} Way {{to work on}} the Manhattan <b>Project</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Metallurgical Laboratory in Chicago. Working with physicist Alvin Weinberg, Way analyzed {{neutron flux}} data from Enrico Fermi's early nuclear reactor designs to see whether {{it would be possible to}} create a self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction. These calculations were put to use in the construction of Chicago Pile-1. Afterwards, she examined the problem of nuclear poisoning of reactors by certain fission products. With physicist Eugene Wigner she developed the Way-Wigner approximation for fission product decay.|$|E
5|$|In 1945, Wigner {{accepted}} {{a position as}} the Director of Research at the Clinton Laboratories in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, which then had a staff of about 800.

But after the Atomic Energy Commission took over responsibility for the laboratory's operations from the Manhattan <b>Project</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> start of 1947, Wigner, feeling unsuited to a managerial role in the new environment, left Oak Ridge at the end of summer in 1947 and returned to Princeton University.|$|E

5|$|In 2003, the MBTA spent {{slightly}} less than $100,000 to rehabilitate the deteriorated garage and to convert the drop-off lane into a full busway with shelters, benches, and signage. The busway opened on September 9, 2003 and 21 MBTA Bus routes were rerouted from Central Square. In late 2005, the MBTA spent $168,000 for repairs to the garage roof, which frequently leaked during rain. The 1992 station was built with new concrete ties supporting the tracks connecting to the station, which proved less durable than expected. In September 2008, the MBTA board authorized a $1 million tie replacement and slope stabilization <b>project</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> station.|$|E
