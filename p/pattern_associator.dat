40|$|Mental {{variables}} {{are central to}} symbolic accounts of cognition. Conversely, ac-cording to the <b>pattern</b> <b>associator</b> hypothesis, {{variables are}} obsolete. We examine the representation of variables by investigating the Obligatory Contour Principle (OCP, McCarthy, 1986) in Hebrew. The OCP constrains gemination in Hebrew roots. Gemination is well formed at the root’s end (e. g., SMM), but not in its begin-ning (e. g., SSM). Roots and geminates, however, are variables; hence, according to the <b>pattern</b> <b>associator</b> view, the OCP is unrepresentable. Three experiments dem-onstrate that speakers {{are sensitive to the}} presence of root gemination and constrain its location. In forming words from novel biconsonantal roots, speakers prefer to reduplicate the root’s final over its initial radical, and they rate such outputs as more acceptable. The avoidance or rejection of root-initial gemination is independent of its position in the word and is inexplicable by the statistical frequency of root tokens. Our results suggest that linguistic representations specify variables. Speakers ’ com-petence, however, is governed by violable constraints. ª 2000 Academic Press This research was supported by the National Institute of Health’s NRSA (F 32 DC 000186 - 02) and FIRST awards (1 R 29 DC 03277 - 02) to Iris Berent.

40|$|Ling and Marinov (L & M) have {{constructed}} {{an interesting}} symbolic alternative to current connectionist models of language acquisition. The kind of detailed comparison of connectionist and symbolic models {{that they are}} pursuing works to clarify and solidify the basis of modelling as a research tool in cognitive science. Work {{such as that of}} Shavlik, Mooney, and Towell (1991) shows that symbolic <b>pattern</b> <b>associators</b> (SPA) can rival artificial neural networks (ANN) across a wide range of tasks. Moreover, these SPA models often run more quickly and can be interpreted through a concrete set of easily summarized production rules. Together, these various properties make SPAs good competitors with ANNs, particularly when issues of psychological and neuropsychological verisimilitude are not at stake. L & M believe that their model outperforms the connectionist model presented by MacWhinney and Leinbach (1991) (M & L) &quot;by a wide margin&quot;. This conclusion is incorrect, because many of the numbers they use to support the conclusion are incorrect. In fact the performance of the two models is remarkably similar along virtually all relevant dimensions. The actual figures that should have been included in Table 4 from L & M are as shown here in Table 1. The simulation from which the results in Table 1 are taken is a minimalized version of the simulation reported on in M & L. It only uses right-justified representations, one pool of hidden units, and no copy units. These changes were made not to improve performance, but {{to make it easier for}} others to replicate these results in their own laboratories.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we show how a {{recurrent}} neural network, of shunting type, receiving changing input {{can be used}} for pattern classification or association. An important feature of the proposed network is its ability to continuously process environmental (external) input. Such ability is very useful if one is to design a real-time reactive system in an unexpectedly changing environment. We firsly state sufficient conditions under which the network dynamics is convergent to stable ponctual attractors. Therefore, we show that relaxing the condition on symmetry of connectivity and making a local quadratic approximation of the dynamics can lead the network into an oscillatory mode. The corresponding limit cycles are shown to be stable. Application of the network with ponctual attractor dynamics to navigation in a changing environment is pointed out but is not in the scope of this paper. 1 Introduction Designing a decision system (a <b>pattern</b> classifier, or <b>associator)</b> usually assumes that the in [...] ...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: An {{artificial}} {{neural network}} has been developed that can analyze signals from piezoelectric sensors to detect the location and intensity of low-energy impact on a composite panel. The panel has two piezopolymer sensors attached some distance apart from each other. The signals are analyzed by the {{artificial neural network}} using a binary <b>pattern</b> <b>associator.</b> The binary <b>pattern</b> <b>associator</b> facilitates memory build-up during learn-ing while simplifying signal discrimination during testing. The impact monitoring system, which consists of the artificial neural network and the piezoelectric sensors, has been used successfully to detect the location and height of impact when a small steel ball is dropped onto a composite laminate., BACKGROUND NE OF THE main shortcomings of composite laminates is their vulnerabilityOto low-energy impact. The damage induced by such impact may not be visi-ble on the outside surfaces but can be substantial internally. Although, in princi-ple, an ultrasonic scanning such as C-scan {{can be used to}} detect the invisible in-ternal damage, its implementation in the field is not practical because the entire structure has to be inspected before the damage can be located. Therefore, it is imperative to develop an impact monitoring system that can monitor in-service impact events [1, 2]. The possibility of using piezoelectric sensors to monitor impact was studied in References [3, 4, 5]. The studies included various aspects of the impact monitor-ing technology: fabrication, sensor performance, impact analysis, and signal *~Author to whom correspondence should be addresse...|$|E
40|$|The {{ability to}} learn the past tense of English verbs has become a {{benchmark}} test for cognitive modelling. In a recent paper, Ling (1994) presented a detailed head-to-head comparison of the generalization abilities of a particular Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model and a general purpose Symbolic <b>Pattern</b> <b>Associator</b> (SPA).

40|$|Learning {{the past}} tense of English verbs - a {{seemingly}} minor aspect of language acquisition - has generated heated debates since 1986, {{and has become a}} landmark task for testing the adequacy of cognitive modeling. Several artificial neural networks (ANNs) have been implemented, and a challenge for better symbolic models has been posed. In this paper, we present a general-purpose Symbolic <b>Pattern</b> <b>Associator</b> (SPA) based upon the decision-tree learning algorithm ID 3. We conduct extensive head-to-head comparisons on the generalization ability between ANN models and the SPA under different representations. We conclude that the SPA generalizes {{the past tense}} of unseen verbs better than ANN models by a wide margin, and we offer insights as to why this should be the case. We also discuss a new default strategy for decision-tree learning algorithms. Comment: See [URL] for an online appendix and other files accompanying this articl...|$|E
40|$|In {{the debate}} over the power of connectionist models to handle {{linguistic}} phenomena, considerable attention has been focused on the learning of simple morphophonemic rules. Rumelhart and McClelland's celebrated model of the acquisition of the English past tense (1986), which used a simple <b>pattern</b> <b>associator</b> to learn mappings from stems to past tense forms, was advanced as evidence that networks could learn to emulate rule-like linguistic behavior. Pinker and Prince's equally celebrated critique of the past-tense model (1988) argued forcefully that the model was inadequate on several grounds. For our purposes, these are (1) #the fact that the model is not constrained in ways that humans language learners clearly are and (2) #the fact that, since the model cannot represent the notion "word", it cannot distinguish homophonous verbs. A further deficiency of the model, one not brought out by Pinker and Prince, {{is that it is not}} a processing account: the task that the network learns is that of [...] ...|$|E
40|$|The vast {{expressive}} {{power of}} language {{is made possible}} by two principles: the arbitrary soundmeaning pairing underlying words, and the discrete combinatorial system underlying grammar. These principles implicate distinct cognitive mechanisms: associative memory and symbolmanipulating rules. The distinction {{may be seen in}} the difference between regular inflection (e. g., walk-walked), which is productive and open-ended and hence implicates a rule, and irregular inflection (e. g., come-came, which is idiosyncratic and closed and hence implicates individually memorized words. Nonetheless, two very different theories have attempted to collapse the distinction; generative phonology invokes minor rules to generate irregular as well as regular forms, and connectionism invokes a <b>pattern</b> <b>associator</b> memory to store and retrieve regular as well as irregular forms. I present evidence from three disciplines that supports the traditional word/rule distinction, though with an enriched conception of lexical memory with some of the properties of a pattern-associator. Rules, nonetheless, are distinct from patternassociation, because a rule concatenates a suffix to a symbol for verbs, so it does not require access to memorized verbs or their sound patterns, but applies as the "default, " wheneve...|$|E
40|$|The Maltese Broken Plurals {{have always}} been treated as a {{mechanism}} totally lacking in rules or structure. The traditional view has been that {{there is simply no}} relation between the singular, and broken plural forms. Tamara Schembri [1], in her B. A. thesis, argues that this view is not entirely correct and offers evidence for regularities governing transformations between the respective forms. In this paper we describe an attempt to examine the computational implications of Schembri’s work for classification of the singular nouns and generation of the corresponding plural form. The solution adopted is based on based on artificial neural networks and involves a <b>pattern</b> <b>associator</b> flanked on both sides by an encoding and decoding unit. We experimented with various encoding schemes and parameter settings and the network produces results that, after optimisation, are closely correlated with Tamara Schembri’s theory. Results indicate that, although we are still far off from creating a complete computational model for the Broken Plural, the classification of nouns in their singular form is not impossible and can be achieved with a relatively high degree of accuracy using machine learning techniques.

40|$|Abstract. Age is a {{powerful}} variable that can be of signi ® cant value when modelling the health of forest-dominated ecosystem. Traditional investigations have attempted to extract age information fromremotely sensed databy regressing the spectral values with in situ derived age data. Traditional statistical approaches assume (a) normally distributed remote sensing and in situ data, (b) no collinearity among variables, and (c) linear data relationships. Arti ® cial neural networks (ANNs) are not bound by such assumptions and may yield improved predictive modelling of forest stand biophysical parameters if properly utilized. This study investigated traditional statistical and ANNapproaches to perform the predictive modelling {{of the age of}} loblolly pine (Pinus taeda) for large stands in southern Brazil using Thematic Mapper (TM) data. An extensive comparison of <b>pattern</b> <b>associator</b> and back-propagation ANNs versus both linear and nonlinear regres-sion analysis was conducted. Various neural network architectures were investi-gated to determine the optimal con ® guration for this particular dataset. Certain back-propagation ANNs modelled stand age signi ® cantly better than traditional statistical approaches because of their ability to take into account nonlinear, non-normally distributed data. The results suggest that ANN analysis may be of signi ® cant value when using remote sensing data tomodel certain forest variables. 1...|$|E
40|$|The {{formation}} of English past tenses {{has provided the}} arena in which alternative computational models of psycholinguistic processes have been most intensely tested. The debate has mainly revolved around accounts based on a single, analogising mechanism as exemplified by connectionist models and the dual mechanism theory of Pinker (1999) which combines elements of a <b>pattern</b> <b>associator</b> memory with a rule-based system. Prasada and Pinker (1993) provide evidence against the connectionist approach by showing that their networks failed to reproduce the behaviour of their English speaking subjects when forming the past tense of a subset of nonce verbs. Eddington (2000 a) provides an alternative single mechanism account of this data using exemplar-based, analogising models which are claimed to produce behaviour comparable to Prasada and Pinker's subjects. On {{the basis of these}} results he argues that not only is a general rejection of single mechanism, analogising accounts premature but also that exemplar-based models "may prove to have advantages over their connectionist counterparts". This paper tests these theoretically important claims. It is shown that the contrast between the particular exemplar-based theory, analogical modelling (AM), and connectionist model which forms the basis of Eddington's arguments is, in fact, a function of differences in the mappings the two simulations compute and that once these are removed, the AM advantage disappears. A detailed analysis of the predictions of the particular AM simulation presented further shows that, although the output bears superficial similarities with those produced by Prasada and Pinker's subjects, other properties are more problematic. © 2013 Elsevier B.

40|$|The {{mechanisms}} for pattern completion and pattern separation {{are described in}} the context of a theory of hippocampal function in which the hippocampal CA 3 system operates as a single attractor or autoassociation network to enable rapid, one-trial, associations between any spatial location (place in rodents, or spatial view in primates) and an object or reward, and to provide for completion of the whole memory during recall from any part. The factors important in the pattern completion in CA 3 and also a large number of independent memories stored in CA 3 include: a sparse distributed representation, representations that are independent due to the randomizing effect of the mossy fibres, heterosynaptic long-term depression as well as long-term potentiation in the recurrent collateral synapses, and diluted connectivity to minimize the number of multiple synapses between any pair of CA 3 neurons which otherwise distort the basins of attraction. Recall of information from CA 3 is implemented by the entorhinal cortex perforant path synapses to CA 3 cells, which in acting as a <b>pattern</b> <b>associator</b> allow some pattern generalization. Pattern separation is performed in the dentate granule cells using competitive learning to convert grid-like entorhinal cortex firing to place-like fields, and in the dentate to CA 3 connections that have diluted connectivity. Recall to the neocortex is achieved by a reverse hierarchical series of pattern association networks implemented by the hippocampo-cortical backprojections, each one of which performs some pattern generalization, to retrieve a complete pattern of cortical firing in higher-order cortical areas. New results on competitive networks show which factors contribute to their ability to perform pattern separation, pattern clustering, and pattern categorisation, and how these apply in different hippocampal and neocortical systems...|$|E
40|$|The {{dissertation}} {{represents a}} critical {{evaluation of the}} major connectionist theories of human cognitive architecture. The central connectionist thesis that artificial neural networks (ANNs) can serve as finitary models of human cognizers is examined and rejected. Connectionist theories, {{in contrast to the}} classical symbol-processing theories of cognitive architecture, cannot explain the productivity and systematicity of mental states. The {{reason for this is that}} ANN-based cognitive architectures cannot maintain representational states with compositional structure. Chapter One analyzes the implementational connectionism 2 ̆ 7 s solution to the problem of compositionality. It is shown that neither the theory of weak nor of strong compositionality can solve this problem.;Chapter Two criticises the attempt to establish connectionism as an alternative theory of human cognitive architecture through the introduction of the symbolic/subsymbolic distinction. The reasons for the introduction of this distinction are examined and found to be unconvincing. Several experimental comparisons between the TDIDT class of symbolic learning systems and the class of artificial neural networks using the error backpropagation algorithm are discussed. It is argued that the differences in the performance of these two classes of learning systems are insignificant and are not systematic. Such evidence contradicts the view that ANNs define a new kind of 2 ̆ 2 subsymbolic 2 ̆ 2 computation.;Supporters of eliminative connectionism have argued for a pattern association and pattern recognition-based explanation of cognitive processes. They deny that explicit rules and symbolic representations play any role in cognition. Their argument is based to a large extent on Rumelhart and McClelland 2 ̆ 7 s and MacWhinney and Leinbach 2 ̆ 7 s connectionist models of learning of the past tenses of English verbs. Chapter Three presents an analysis of an experimental comparison between these models and the Symbolic <b>Pattern</b> <b>Associator</b> (SPA) [...] a learning system based on the classical architecture. It is shown that the SPA outperforms the connectionist models; moreover, the SPA can represent the acquired knowledge in the form of explicit rules. The analysis of this comparison leads to the conclusion that symbol-processing models have a far better chance of explaining complex cognitive phenomena in terms of rules and symbolic representations than eliminative connectionism...|$|E
