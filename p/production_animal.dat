500|$|During its <b>production,</b> <b>animal</b> {{rights group}} People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) made {{allegations}} of animal cruelty against the film, reporting {{that one of}} the two chimpanzees used in the production was allegedly beaten after biting an actor. The incident was confirmed by the American Humane Association (AHA) Animal Safety Representative on the set, who reported that the stand-in for the Spritle character portrayed by Litt had been bitten without provocation. The AHA representative also reported that [...] "toward the end of filming, during a training session {{in the presence of the}} American Humane Representative, the trainer, in an uncontrolled impulse, hit the chimpanzee." [...] The AHA Film Unit referred to this abuse as [...] "completely inexcusable and unacceptable behavior in the use of any animal." [...] The AHA has rated Speed Racer [...] "Unacceptable" [...] chiefly because of this incident, with AHA noting [...] "the aforementioned training incident tarnishes the excellent work of the rest of production" [...] and that it [...] "has no method of separating the actions of one individual in the employ of a production from the production as a whole." ...|$|E

40|$|A {{large part}} of the {{environmental}} impact of <b>animal</b> <b>production</b> systems is due to the production of feed. Insects are suggested to efficiently convert feed to body mass and might therefore form a more sustainable food and/or feed source. Four diets were composed from by-products of food manufacturing and formulated such as to vary in protein and fat content. These were offered to newly hatched Argentinean cockroaches, black soldier flies, yellow mealworms, and house crickets. The first two species are potentially interesting as a feed ingredient, while the latter two are considered edible for humans. Feed conversion efficiency, survival, development time, as well as chemical composition (nitrogen, phosphorus, and fatty acids), were determined. The Argentinean cockroaches and the black soldier flies converted feed more efficiently than yellow mealworms, and house crickets. The first two were also more efficient than conventional <b>production</b> <b>animals.</b> On three of the four diets yellow mealworms and house crickets had a feed conversion efficiency similar to pigs. Furthermore, on the most suitable diet, they converted their feed as efficiently as poultry, when corrected for edible portion. All four species had a higher nitrogen-efficiency than conventional <b>production</b> <b>animals,</b> when corrected for edible portion. Offering carrots to yellow mealworms increased dry matter- and nitrogen-efficiency and decreased development time. Diet affected survival in all species but black soldier flies, and development time was strongly influenced in all four species. The chemical composition of Argentinean cockroaches was highly variable between diets, for black soldier flies it remained similar. The investigated species can be considered efficient <b>production</b> <b>animals</b> when suitable diets are provided. Hence, they could form a sustainable alternative to conventional <b>production</b> <b>animals</b> as a source of feed or food...|$|R

40|$|The {{combination}} of breeding for increased {{production and the}} intensification of housing conditions have resulted in increased occurrence of behavioral, physiological, and immunological disorders. These disorders affect health and welfare of <b>production</b> <b>animals</b> negatively. For future livestock systems, {{it is important to}} consider how to manage and breed <b>production</b> <b>animals.</b> In this paper, we will focus on selective breeding of laying hens. Selective breeding should not only be defined in terms of production, but should also include traits related to animal health and welfare. For this we like to introduce the concept of robustness. The concept of robustness includes individual traits of an animal that are relevant for health and welfare. Improving robustness by selective breeding will increase (or restore) the ability of animals to interact successfully with the environment and thereby to make them more able to adapt to an appropriate husbandry system. Application of robustness into a breeding goal will result in animals with improved health and welfare without affecting their integrity. Therefore, in order to be ethically acceptable, selective breeding in <b>animal</b> <b>production</b> should accept robustness as a breeding goa...|$|R
