To improve the surface quality of formed parts, a magnetic-driving plasma arc (MDPA) was applied in monitoring the distribution of heat flux.

The {{results indicated that the}} swing amplitude of MDPA increased linearly when the exciting current Ie < 1. 2 A, and the distribution of heat flux with MDPA was more uniform than that merely with plasma arc in the heating zone, which avoided the possible partial melting and ablation <b>of</b> <b>metal</b> <b>sheet.</b> Moreover, the “U-shape ” occurred with MDPA, and the material accumulation with MDPA was smaller than that merely with plasma arc on the surface <b>of</b> <b>metal</b> <b>sheet...</b>|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The {{work was}} aimed at {{temperature}} measurement {{with respect to the}} heating process in the bundles <b>of</b> <b>metal</b> <b>sheets</b> in the direct cutting zone during the cutting process conducted on a guillotine. Design/methodology/approach: The paper presents a methodology to analyse the process of heating the bundles <b>of</b> <b>metal</b> <b>sheets</b> during cutting on a guillotine, designed and built from scratch. The temperature in bundles in the direct cutting zone has been determined in an experimental way using a specialised infrared camera. The research has been conducted {{in order to reduce the}} number of randomly occurring defects during cutting <b>of</b> <b>metal</b> <b>sheets</b> on a guillotine. Findings: Possibilities of finding of the optimum cutting parameters on account of maximum permissible temperature in the bundles <b>of</b> <b>metal</b> <b>sheets</b> have been determined. The experimental data indicates that it is possible to select a set of guillotine parameters which allow for reducing of temperature measured in the direct cutting zone. Temperature reduction allows for avoidance of defects which might occur in the direct cutting zone as the result of progressing heat transfer during cutting. The defects occurring on the blade of a cutting tool might also contribute to the local growth of temperature corresponding to the positions of the defects on the blade. Research limitations/implications: The experimentally assumed characteristics of temperature versus time for in advance chosen cutting parameters may be generalized for a wide gamut of materials and for changeable cutting conditions; however, the obtained experimentally values of temperature are specific and related to the chosen types of materials and fixed cutting conditions of a guillotine. Practical implications: The appropriate selection of the cutting parameters on account of temperature characteristics is essential in terms of industrial economy. It enables reducing the amount of waste caused by defects in cutting bundles of sheets and decreases wear of the cutting tool. Originality/value: The results acquired from the research form a base for selection of the best parameter settings required for conducting the optimum cutting process on a guillotine. The optimum set of cutting parameters combined with the lowest possible value of temperature generated in the direct cutting zone leads to the reduction of defects’ number occurring during the process...|$|R
