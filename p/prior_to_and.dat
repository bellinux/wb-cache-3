5|$|A 2012 {{study on}} the effects of {{rainfall}} patterns and parasite infections on the body of the springbok in Etosha National Park observed that males and juveniles were in better health {{toward the end of the}} rainy season. Health of females was more affected by parasites than by rainfall; parasite count in females peaked <b>prior</b> <b>to</b> <b>and</b> immediately after parturition. Studies show that springbok host helminths (Haemonchus, Longistrongylus and Trichostrongylus), ixodid ticks (Rhipicephalus species), lice (Damalinia and Linognathus species). Eimeria species mainly affect juveniles.|$|E

5|$|After {{the end of}} World War II, amateur and {{professional}} wrestling enjoyed widespread popularity in New Zealand popular culture. Part of this of was due to its radio broadcasts from live events both <b>prior</b> <b>to</b> <b>and</b> after the war. By 1956, professional wrestling had surpassed the then-national sport of rugby in popularity and {{was the most popular}} spectator sport in New Zealand with the exception of horse racing. The Wellington Town Hall Concert Chamber was one of the more popular postwar venues for wrestling events. Within a few years, New Zealand champions were traveling oversees as far as Western Canada.|$|E

5|$|Forecasts of {{hurricane}} activity are issued before each hurricane season by noted hurricane expert William M. Gray {{and his associates}} at Colorado State University (CSU), and separately by forecasters with the U.S. Government's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). <b>Prior</b> <b>to</b> <b>and</b> during the 2005 season, Gray issued four forecasts, each time increasing the predicted level of activity. The NOAA issued two forecasts, one shortly before the season and one two months into the season, drastically increasing the predicted level of activity in the second release. Nonetheless, all forecasts fell {{far short of the}} actual activity of the season.|$|E
5|$|In {{patients}} of normal intelligence, rumination {{is not an}} intentional behavior and is habitually reversed using diaphragmatic breathing to counter the urge to regurgitate. Alongside reassurance, explanation and habit reversal, patients are shown how to breathe using their diaphragms <b>prior</b> <b>to</b> <b>and</b> during the normal rumination period. A similar breathing pattern {{can be used to}} prevent normal vomiting. Breathing in this method works by physically preventing the abdominal contractions required to expel stomach contents.|$|E

5|$|Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music {{became one}} of the best-selling albums {{recorded}} by a black musician of the time, as well as one of the best-selling country albums, shipping at least 500,000 copies in its first three months of release. This achievement was {{due in part to the}} mainstream promotional efforts Modern Sounds had received from ABC <b>prior</b> <b>to</b> <b>and</b> following release. The album proved to be a crossover hit as well, as distributors claimed the record had been selling in pop, R and country music markets; at the time, often referred to as white and black markets during the period.|$|E
5|$|The Australian {{contribution}} to the Battle of Normandy involved more than 3,000 military personnel serving under British command. The majority of these personnel {{were members of the}} Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF), though smaller numbers of Australians serving with the Royal Navy and British Army also participated in the fighting <b>prior</b> <b>to</b> <b>and</b> after the Allied landings on 6 June 1944.

5|$|The Pictish {{relationship}} with Rome {{appears to have}} been less overtly hostile than their Caledonian predecessors, at least in the beginning. There were no more pitched battles and conflict was generally limited to raiding parties {{from both sides of the}} frontier until immediately <b>prior</b> <b>to</b> <b>and</b> after the Roman retreat from Britannia. Their apparent success in holding back Roman forces cannot be explained solely with reference to the remoteness of Caledonia or the difficulties of the terrain. In part it may have been due to the difficulties encountered in subjugating a population that did not conform to the strictures of local governance that Roman power usually depended on to operate through.|$|E

5|$|The {{origins of}} the state {{boundaries}} marked by the monument occurred just <b>prior</b> <b>to,</b> <b>and</b> during, the American Civil War, when the United States Congress acted to form governments {{in the area to}} combat the spread of slavery to the region. When the early territories were formed, their boundaries were designated along meridian and parallel lines. Beginning in the 1860s, these lines were surveyed and marked. These early surveys included some errors, but even so, the markers placed became the legal boundaries, superseding the written descriptions of geographical meridians and parallels. This includes the Four Corners Monument, which has been legally established as the corner of the four states.|$|E
5|$|Throughout history {{mandrake}}s (Mandragora officinarum) {{have been}} highly sought after for their reputed aphrodisiac properties. However, {{the roots of}} the mandrake plant also contain large quantities of the alkaloid scopolamine, which, at high doses, acts as a central nervous system depressant, and makes the plant highly toxic to herbivores. Scopolamine was later found to be medicinally used for pain management <b>prior</b> <b>to</b> <b>and</b> during labor; in smaller doses it is used to prevent motion sickness. One of the most well-known medicinally valuable terpenes is an anticancer drug, taxol, isolated from the bark of the Pacific yew, Taxus brevifolia, in the early 1960s.|$|E
5|$|Between its 1968 debut and its {{appearance}} at the Beijing Olympics, Barbadian delegations appeared at every Summer Olympics except for the 1980 Summer Olympics, {{which took place in}} Moscow in the Soviet Union. With the exceptions of the 1968 and the 2008 Barbadian teams, every appearance by Barbados at the Olympics (as of Beijing) included at least ten athletes; its smallest delegation arrived in 2008, carrying only eight competitors. All the delegations except the one that arrived in 1968 have included female athletes. <b>Prior</b> <b>to</b> <b>and</b> including the 2008 Beijing Olympics, there had been one medalist from Barbados.

5|$|Harveys Lake {{has been}} popular for {{recreational}} purposes {{since the late}} 1800s. Places such as Warden Place and Sandy Beach were popular recreational areas near the lake in the early 1900s. Around this time period, there were four steamboats on Harveys Lake. They were used for carrying passengers and freight. Recreational steamboat rides on the lake were popular between 1900 and 1920. A 60-foot (18-meter) high Shoot the Chute {{was built in the}} area by Charles Shelley in 1910. It was one of the largest attractions in the lake's vicinity. A casino near the lake was opened by Frank Devlin in May 1924, but was demolished in 1980. Devlin also opened the largest bowling alley in northeast Pennsylvania near the lake. Throughout the 20th century, <b>prior</b> <b>to</b> <b>and</b> after World War II, the lake attracted thousands of visitors yearly.|$|E
5|$|Only {{the most}} {{politically}} charged and detailed weapons effects information was censored during this period. The Hiroshima-based magazine, Chugoku Bunka for example, in its first issue published March 10, 1946, devotes itself to detailing the damage from the bombing. Similarly, there was no censorship of the factually written witness accounts, the book Hiroshima written by Pulitzer Prize winner John Hersey, which was originally published in article form in the popular magazine The New Yorker, on August 31, 1946, {{is reported to have}} reached Tokyo in English by January 1947, and the translated version was released in Japan in 1949. The book narrates the stories of the lives of six bomb survivors from immediately <b>prior</b> <b>to,</b> <b>and</b> months after, the dropping of the Little Boy bomb. Beginning in 1974 a compilation of drawings and artwork made by the survivors of the bombings began to be compiled, with completion in 1977 and under both book and exhibition format, it was titled The Unforgettable Fire.|$|E
5|$|<b>Prior</b> <b>to</b> <b>and</b> during Israel's 1982 {{invasion}} of Lebanon, al-Wazir planned numerous attacks inside Israel against both {{civilian and military}} targets.

He settled in Amman for a two-year period and was then exiled to Tunis in 1986. From his base there, he started to organize youth committees in the Palestinian territories; these eventually became the backbone of the Palestinian forces in the First Intifada. However, he did not live to command the uprising. On April 16, 1988, he was assassinated at his home in Tunis, by Israeli commandos.|$|E
