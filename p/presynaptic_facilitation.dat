Using physiological concentrations of Mg 2 + during fractionation, we now find that, independent from cAMP, protein kinase C is translocated in sensory neurons by sensitizing stimuli. Translocation occurred after behavioral training of the animal and after application to isolated ganglia of serotonin or phorbol esters. Taken together with the neurophysiological evidence presented in the accompanying paper that phorbol esters can produce the facilitation, these biochemical results suggest that protein kinase C plays a role in producing the <b>presynaptic</b> <b>facilitation</b> that underlies short-term sensitization and dishabituation of defensive reflexes...|$|E

The informational content of each presynaptic action potential is therefore greater than initially expected. This property constitutes a form of fast activity-dependent modulation of functional coupling. Therefore, it could have important consequences on information processing in neural networks in parallel with more classical forms of <b>presynaptic</b> short-term <b>facilitation</b> based on repetitive stimulation, modulation of presynaptic calcium or modifications of the release machinery.

40|$|Behavioral {{sensitization}} of the gill-withdrawal reflex of Aplysia {{is caused}} by <b>presynaptic</b> <b>facilitation</b> at the synapses of the mechanoreceptor sensory neurons of the reflex onto the motor neurons and interneurons. The <b>presynaptic</b> <b>facilitation</b> {{has been shown to}} be simulated by serotonin (the putative presynaptic facilitatory transmitter) and by cyclic AMP and to be accompanied by an increase in the Ca 2 + current of sensory neuron cell bodies exposed to tetraethylammonium. This increase in the Ca 2 + current could result from either a direct action on the Ca 2 + channel or an action on an opposing K+ current. Here we report voltage clamp experiments which indicate that the increase in Ca 2 + current associated with <b>presynaptic</b> <b>facilitation</b> results from a decrease in a K+ current. Stimulation of the connective (the pathway that mediates sensitization) or application of serotonin causes a decrease in a voltage-sensitive, steady-state outward current measured under voltage clamp as well as an increase in the transient net inward and a decrease in the transient outward currents elicited by brief depolarizing command steps. The reversal potential of the steady-state synaptic current is sensitive to extracellular K+ concentration, and both the steady-state synaptic current and the changes in the transient currents are blocked by K+ current blocking agents and by washout of K+. These results suggest that serotonin and the natural transmitter released by connective stimulation act to decrease a voltage-sensitive K+ current.

40|$|Behavioral {{sensitization}} of the gill-withdrawal reflex of Aplysia is {{the result}} of a prolonged increase in transmitter release from the presynaptic terminals of sensory neurons. Earlier work suggested that this <b>presynaptic</b> <b>facilitation</b> might be mediated by a serotonin-sensitive adenylate cyclase in the sensory neuron terminals. Here we present evidence that <b>presynaptic</b> <b>facilitation</b> results from a cyclic AMP-dependent increase in the calcium current that underlies action potentials in the sensory neurons. The action potentials of sensory neuron cell bodies have, in addition to a sodium current, a calcium current that is enhanced by blocking the opposing potassium current with tetraethylammonium. Under these conditions, the action potentials show a slowly repolarizing plateau that follows the Nernst potential for a calcium electrode and serves as a sensitive assay for changes in calcium current. Stimulation of the pathway that mediates sensitization, incubation with serotonin or phosphodiesterase inhibitors, or intracellular injection of cyclic AMP produces an increase in the calcium plateau in the presence of tetraethylammonium. In addition, both before and after sensitizing stimulation, the duration of the plateau potential parallels transmitter release as measured by the amplitude of monosynaptic excitatory postsynaptic potentials evoked in the motor neurons by intracellular stimulation of single sensory neurons. These results are consistent with the idea that <b>presynaptic</b> <b>facilitation</b> is caused by a cyclic AMP-mediated increase in a voltage-sensitive calcium current in sensory neuron presynaptic terminals. This synaptic action is novel in that it can produce little or no change in the resting potential, is of long duration, and exerts its influence directly on a conductance triggered by the action potential, rather than on non-voltage-sensitive conductances, as is typical of conventional synaptic actions...|$|E

This behavioral plasticity involves <b>presynaptic</b> <b>facilitation</b> of synaptic transmission from the mechanosensory neurons that mediate the reflex to their central target cells.

To determine whether {{the time course of}} <b>presynaptic</b> <b>facilitation</b> might be due to a persistent increase in activity of adenylate cyclase (EC 4. 6. 1. 1) itself, persistence of the transmitter, or yet other processes, we developed a perfused-membrane method to analyze the time course of activation of adenylate cyclase by transient stimuli. After stimulation by a pulse of stimulatory transmitter, activation of adenylate cyclase decayed within 60 sec. This finding indicates that the enzyme does not remain persistently active in the absence of transmitter and suggests that short-term retention is likely to be due to other mechanisms.

40|$|AbstractThe past 15 {{years have}} been witness to a {{remarkable}} growth in knowledge regarding the modulation of “sympathetic traffic” to neuroeffector organs, including vascular tissue. The release of norepinephrine from peripheral sympathetic neurons is now known to be under both negative and positive feedback control. Norepinephrine, when released from peripheral neurons, acts on presynaptic alpha 2 -receptors to inhibit further neurotransmission. Vascular postsynaptic alpha 2 -receptors, sensitive to circulating catecholamines, subserve vasoconstriction. The antihypertensive agents clonidine, guanabenz and guanfacin likely reduce blood pressure by acting centrally on alpha 2 postsynaptic neurons to limit sympathetic transmission to blood vessels. Clonidine can produce venoconstriction and thereby improve orthostatic hypotension by activating venous alpha 2 -receptors. Additional presynaptic dopaminergic receptors (DA 2), muscarinic receptors (acetylcholine), opioid receptors, prostaglandin receptors, adenosine receptors (A 1) and histamine (H 2) receptors are present on sympathetic nerve membranes and, when engaged with the appropriate ligand, can limit the exocytotic process. Gamma-aminobutyric acid and serotonin demonstrate similar roles in reducing sympathetic nerve activity. In contrast to these inhibitory <b>presynaptic</b> mechanisms, <b>facilitation</b> of norepinephrine release appears to occur by way of neuronal angiotensin II receptor activation and perhaps through stimulation of sympathetic nerve membrane beta 2 -receptors. An appreciation of these inhibitory and facilitator mechanisms is useful {{in the treatment of}} a variety of clinical conditions, including hypertension, heart failure, orthostatic hypotension, septic shock and a number of common withdrawal syndromes...|$|R
40|$|Short-term {{behavioral}} sensitization of the gill-withdrawal reflex after tail stimuli in Aplysia {{leads to}} an enhancement of the connections between sensory and motor neurons of this reflex. Both behavioral sensitization and enhancement {{of the connection between}} sensory and motor neurons are importantly mediated by serotonin. Serotonin activates two types of receptors in the sensory neurons, one of which is coupled to the cAMP/protein kinase A (PKA) pathway and the other to the inositol triphosphate/protein kinase C (PKC) pathway. Here we describe a genetic approach to assessing the isolated contribution of the PKA pathway to short-term facilitation. We have cloned from Aplysia an octopamine receptor gene, Ap oa 1, that couples selectively to the cAMP/PKA pathway. We have ectopically expressed this receptor in Aplysia sensory neurons of the pleural ganglia, where it is not normally expressed. Activation of this receptor by octopamine stimulates all four presynaptic events involved in short-term synaptic facilitation that are normally produced by serotonin: (i) membrane depolarization; (ii) increased membrane excitability; (iii) increased spike duration; and (iv) <b>presynaptic</b> <b>facilitation.</b> These results indicate that the cAMP/PKA pathway alone is sufficient to produce all the features of <b>presynaptic</b> <b>facilitation...</b>|$|E
40|$|Sensitization of {{defensive}} gill and siphon withdrawal reflexes in Aplysia results, in part, from <b>presynaptic</b> <b>facilitation</b> of transmitter release from mechanoreceptor sensory neurons that innervate the siphon skin and synapse with interneurons and motor neurons. <b>Presynaptic</b> <b>facilitation</b> {{also can be}} elicited by application of serotonin. This facilitation is associated with two phenomena, a prolongation of the presynaptic action potential resulting from a decrease in a specific K+ current and an enhancement of the Ca 2 + transients elicited by depolarization. Previous work has shown that prolongation of the action potential enhances synaptic transmission at normal levels of release. Here we report that an additional set of processes also contributes to facilitation. When repeated activation of the sensory neurons induces profound homosynaptic depression, prolonging the duration of action potentials (or of depolarizing commands under voltage clamp) has little effect on transmitter release. Nonetheless, serotonin is still capable of enhancing release. Since homosynaptic depression underlies the behavioral process of habituation, {{the second set of}} processes, by counteracting the consequences of the depression, seems to mediate the effects of dishabituation in the sensory neuron.

40|$|<b>Presynaptic</b> <b>facilitation</b> of {{transmission}} from sensory to motor neurons contributes significantly to behavioral sensitization of defensive withdrawal reflexes in Aplysia. <b>Presynaptic</b> <b>facilitation</b> {{is associated with}} a decrease in the serotonin-sensitive K+ conductance. This decrease broadens the presynaptic action potential. In addition, the procedures that cause facilitation—stimulation of the connective (the pathway from the tail and head), application of modulatory transmitters, or injection of cAMP—also increase the excitability of the sensory neurons as tested with intracellular depolarizing pulses injected into the cell body. The increased excitability is reflected in a decreased threshold for generating action potentials and a reduction in accommodation to prolonged constant current stimuli. By influencing the excitability of the peripheral processes of the sensory neurons, stimulation of the connectives or serotonin also produces a small enhancement of the response of the sensory neurons to a tactile stimulus applied to the siphon. The excitability changes appear to result, at least in part, from the same cellular mechanisms that lead to broadening of the action potential, a cAMP-mediated closure of K+ channels. Therefore, these findings indicate that the same class of mechanisms can, in principle, have a dual action and provide further evidence for parallel processing in the modulation of transmitter release from a single neuron...|$|E

The evoked excitatory postsynaptic current (eEPSC) was recorded from SCN neurons located in hypothalamic brain slices. The eEPSC amplitude was stable during 0. 08 Hz stimulation and exhibited frequency-dependent short-term synaptic depression (SD) during 0. 5 to 100 Hz stimulus trains in 95 of 99 (96 %) recorded neurons. During SD the steady-state eEPSC amplitude decreased, whereas the cumulative charge transfer increased in a frequency-dependent manner and saturated at 20 Hz. SD was similar during subjective day and night and decreased with increasing temperature. Paired-pulse stimulation (PPS) and voltage-dependent Ca 2 + channel (VDCC) blockers were used to characterize a <b>presynaptic</b> release mechanism. <b>Facilitation</b> was present in 30 % and depression in 70 % of studied neurons during PPS. Synaptic transmission was reduced by blocking both N- and P/Q-type presynaptic VDCCs, but only the N-type channel blocker significantly relieved SD. Aniracetam inhibited AMPA receptor desensitization but did not alter SD.

40|$|<b>Presynaptic</b> <b>facilitation</b> of {{transmitter}} {{release from}} Aplysia sensory neurons {{is an important}} contributor to behavioral sensitization of the gill and siphon withdrawal reflex. The enhanced release is accompanied by reduction of the serotonin-sensitive S current in the sensory neurons and a consequent increase in duration of the presynaptic action potential (ranging from 10 % to 30 %). We find that changes of similar magnitude in the duration of depolarizing voltage-clamp steps in sensory neurons in intact abdominal ganglia yield increases in synaptic potentials of 45 - 120 %. In dissociated cell culture, these changes lead to increases of 25 - 60 % in the synaptic potential.

Sensitization of the gill-withdrawal reflex in Aplysia involves enhancement of transmitter release by <b>presynaptic</b> <b>facilitation</b> at a particular set of synaptic connections between identified sensory neurons and their follower cells.

Such LLIs could also be evoked in VLPO neurons by pressure application of NMDA within the SCN, indicating the specific activation of SCN neurons. This LLI was shown to result from the <b>presynaptic</b> <b>facilitation</b> of noradrenaline release, because it was suppressed in presence of yohimbine, a selective antagonist of � 2 -adrenoreceptors. The LLI depended on the opening of a potassium conductance, because it was annulled at E K and could be reversed below E K. These results show that the SCN can provide an LLI of the sleep-promoting VLPO neurons that could {{play a role in the}} circadian organization of the sleep–waking cycle.

40|$|Activation {{of protein}} kinase C (PKC) by phorbol ester {{facilitates}} hormonal secretion and transmitter release, and phorbol ester-induced synaptic potentiation (PESP) {{is a model}} for <b>presynaptic</b> <b>facilitation.</b> A variety of PKC isoforms are expressed in the central nervous system, but the isoform involved in the PESP has not been identified. To address this question, we have applied immunocytochemical and electrophysiological techniques to the calyx of Held synapse in the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB) of rat auditory brainstem. Western blot analysis indicated that both the Ca 2 +-dependent “conventional” PKC and Ca 2 +-independent “novel” PKC isoforms are expressed in the MNTB. Denervation of afferent fibers followed by organotypic culture, however, selectively decreased “novel” ɛPKC isoform expressed in this region. The afferent calyx terminal was clearly labeled with the ɛPKC immunofluorescence. On stimulation with phorbol ester, presynaptic ɛPKC underwent autophosphorylation and unidirectional translocation toward the synaptic side. Chelating presynaptic Ca 2 +, by using membrane permeable EGTA analogue or high concentration of EGTA directly loaded into calyceal terminals, had only a minor attenuating effect on the PESP. We conclude that the Ca 2 +-independent ɛPKC isoform mediates the PESP at this mammalian central nervous system synapse...|$|E
40|$|In many brain regions, Ca 2 + influx through {{presynaptic}} P 2 X receptors influences GABA {{release from}} interneurones. In patch-clamp recordings of Purkinje cells (PCs) in rat cerebellar slices, broad spectrum P 2 receptor antagonists, PPADS (30  [mu]M) or suramin (12  [mu]M), {{result in a}} decreased amplitude and increased failure rate of minimal evoked GABAergic synaptic currents from basket cells. The effect is mimicked by desensitizing P 2 X 1 / 3 -containing receptors with [alpha],[beta]-methylene ATP. This suggests <b>presynaptic</b> <b>facilitation</b> of GABA release via P 2 XR-mediated Ca 2 + influx activated by endogenously released ATP. In contrast, activation of P 2 Y 4 receptors (using UTP, 30  [mu]M, but not P 2 Y 1 or P 2 Y 6 receptor ligands) results in inhibition of GABA release. Immunological studies reveal the presence of most known P 2 Rs in >= 20 % of GABAergic terminals in the cerebellum. P 2 X 3 receptors and P 2 Y 4 receptors occur in approximately 60 % and 50 % of GABAergic synaptosomes respectively and are localized presynaptically. Previous studies report that PC output is also influenced by postsynaptic purinergic receptors located on both PCs and interneurones. [URL]...|$|E
40|$|Classical {{conditioning}} of Aplysia's siphon-withdrawal reflex {{is thought}} to be due to a presynaptic mechanism-activity-dependent <b>presynaptic</b> <b>facilitation</b> of sensorimotor connections. Recent experiments with sensorimotor synapses in dissociated cell culture, however, provide an alternative cellular mechanism for classical conditioning-Hebbian long-term potentiation (LTP) of sensorimotor connections. Induction of Hebbian LTP of these connections is mediated by activation of N-methyl-D-aspartate-related receptors and requires the postsynaptic elevation of intracellular Ca 2 +. To determine whether the enhancement of sensorimotor synapses during classical conditioning in Aplysia-like LTP of sensorimotor synapses in culture-also depends upon the elevation of postsynaptic Ca 2 +, we carried out experiments involving the cellular analog of classical conditioning of siphon withdrawal. We examined changes in the strength of monosynaptic siphon sensorimotor connections in the abdominal ganglion of Aplysia following paired presentations of sensory neuron activation and tail nerve shock. This training regimen resulted in significant enhancement of the monosynaptic sensorimotor excitatory postsynaptic potential, as compared with the sensorimotor excitatory postsynaptic potential in preparations that received only test stimulation. Infusing the motor neuron with 1, 2 -bis(2 -aminophenoxy) ethane-N,N-N',N'-tetraacetic acid, a specific chelator of intracellular Ca 2 +, prior to paired stimulation training blocked this synaptic enhancement. Our results implicate a postsynaptic, possibly Hebbian, mechanism in classical conditioning in Aplysia...|$|E
