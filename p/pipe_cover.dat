40|$|AbstractA Cellular Automata {{approach}} is introduced {{in this paper}} for the optimal design of sewer network problems. The solution of sewer network optimization problems requires the determination of pipe diameters and average <b>pipe</b> <b>cover</b> depths, minimizing {{the total cost of}} the sewer network subject to operational constraints. One constraint of the problem, namely, the maximum relative depth of flow, is first used to define the pipe diameters in terms of the pipe slope and, hence, the nodal elevation of the network. As a result, the sewer network optimization problem is redefined, in terms of the network nodal elevations, and the resulting problem is solved using a Cellular Automata (CA) approach. The nodes of the network are used as the CA cell, with the corresponding elevations as CA cell states. The updating rule of the proposed CA is then derived by requiring the stationary total penalized objective function of the problem, with respect to the cell state. The proposed method is used to solve two benchmark examples and the results are compared to those obtained by other methods. The results indicate that the proposed method is highly efficient compared to alternative methods, while producing comparable results...|$|E
40|$|AbstractRecently trench ducts for allocating {{conveying}} pipes {{for various}} hydraulic or electric lines are tremendously constructed due to {{rapid growth of}} life and communication demand. Graded sands and concrete are usually in conventional excavation and backfill operation. Controlled low-strength material (CLSM) has been proposed as a suitable substitute for this construction. However, exact and reliable analysis is required to assure the stress and settlement limitation. This paper presents static analysis of trench duct backfilled with sustainable materials and conventional materials using boundary element (BE) method. The Young's moduli of CLSM are obtained from laboratory tests for two different binder mixtures, CLSM B- 130 / 30 % and CLSM B- 8 -/ 30 %, respectively. Two-dimensional planar strain is employed in the BE formulation of static analysis and comparison study of 4 kinds of backfill materials, i. e., graded sand, CLSM B 130 - 30 %, CLSM B 130 - 80 %, and concrete. Emphasis is put on the lateral pressure on the side wall, settlement {{at the top of}} trench duct, vertical displacement along the centerline of duct and top of <b>pipe</b> <b>cover,</b> induced by three wheel surcharges: concentrated, strip and uniform lane loads. Convergence tests of BEM results are first conducted. Numerical results show that the settlement and lateral pressure of CLSM backfills are acceptable to assure the applicability of CLSM as a suitable sustainable material employed for trench duct design and backfill construction...|$|E
40|$|An {{automated}} algorithm {{based on}} the dynamic hydrological and hydraulic simulation modules in Storm Water Management Model (SWMM) was developed to aid the design of storm sewer networks, provided that a layout is given. Numerical performance of the proposed algorithm was compared with the existing design methods with two application cases. The automated computation process of the sewer network design was divided into two stages and solved iteratively, determining pipe diameter and pipe slope, respectively. In the first stage, starting {{with a set of}} initial values including pipe diameter, <b>pipe</b> <b>cover</b> depth, and ground elevation at manholes, the iteration was carried out from the downstream to the upstream while the pipe slopes of the network were assumed to be fixed and the diameter of each pipe segment was calculated. In the second stage, pipe diameters calculated from the first stage were fixed and the pipe slopes were calculated successively from the downstream pipe segment to the upstream pipe segment. Every time the diameter or slope of a pipe segment was adjusted, the pipe flow rate, velocity, and flow depth were obtained by running SWMM hydrological and hydraulic simulation modules. The iteration terminated once the combination scheme of pipe diameters and slopes met the design ordinance which requires the pipe flows full under gravity in a design return period. A real urban sewer system in a hilly city and a benchmark sewer network from the literature were tested to validate the proposed automated algorithm, and good performance was shown. The automated design results explicitly show that the proposed storm sewer design approach leads to a quality solution with reduced computational effort...|$|E

40|$|The thermal {{utilisation}} of {{the ground}} with the help of earth-coupled structural elements (“energy geostructures”) is a future-oriented method for domestic heat generation. Due to the incorporation of heat exchanging pipes into necessary structural elements, the installation costs for energy geostructures are much lower than for common geothermal systems. Traditionally, concrete geostructures are used as energy geostructures, whereby the heat exchanging pipes are attached to the existing reinforcement. In this context, the thermal activation of piles, walls, base slabs and tunnels is known. In this thesis, thermo-active seal panels were developed. The thermo-active seal panels can replace a conventional sealing system, for example for basement walls, which are in contact to (streaming) groundwater. The heat exchanging pipes are incorporated into concrete protecting plates made of PE-HD. Due to the thin plate a nearly direct contact to the ground can be achieved. Furthermore, a flexible arrangement of the heat exchanging pipes is possible, due to the existing regular arranged pimples (anchors) on the concrete protecting plate. For determining the effectiveness of the thermo-active seal panels, a large-scale laboratory test station was developed. In this test station, heat extraction tests were carried out, whereby different boundary conditions and system configurations were tested. The determined heat output varied between 25 W/m² and 300 W/m² depending on the applied conditions. The median was about 80 W/m². Thus, the possible heat output of thermo-active seal panels is in the same order of magnitude as documented values in literature for other energy geostructures. Until now, no suitable calculation approach, which considers all influencing parameters, exists. This is due to the fact, that different heat transport mechanisms in the ground, in the structural element and in the heat exchanging system with varying complexity has to be considered. Furthermore, different scales characterize the different sub-processes. Thus, the coupling of all sub-processes is an additional difficulty. Moreover, no rotation-symmetrical heat transfer exists for plane energy geostructures. Therefore, a heat transfer to the ground (outside) and to the adjacent room (inside) has to be taken into account. Hence, a calculation approach for plane energy geostructures was developed in this thesis. This approach considers all heat transport processes involved using the analogy to thermally active building systems (TABS). The multi-layered structural element as well as the heat exchanging system is modelled via thermal resistances. Due to a star connection, a distinction between the heat transfer to the outside and to the inside can be made and both heat flows can be calculated separately. For the coupling of the thermal resistance model and the ground both, analytical methods and numerical methods, were used. However, just numerical methods enable a detailed design of energy geostructures with sufficient accuracy. Thus, the thermal resistance model was implemented in the software tool SHEMAT-Suite, whereas the Geophysica Beratungs-gesellschaft mbH (Aachen) was responsible for the numerical implementation. The mathematical approach and its numerical implementation were verified and validated. For this purpose, comparative calculations using a fully discretised Finite-Element-Modell (COMSOL) were carried out. The results of both numerical models show a very good agreement. Additionally, a comparison between numerical model and laboratory tests was carried out. The modelled and measured return temperatures show also a very good agreement. Thus, the validity of the new calculation approach and its numerical implementation is proved. Furthermore, the computing times of the new approach are of some order of magnitude smaller than the computing time of the fully discretised numerical model. Energy geostructures are mainly utilised in the near-surface ground. Therefore, a time-varying ground temperature has to be taken into account. In this thesis, a calculation algorithm for determining the average earth-surface temperature for each month was developed. This approach is based on the energy balance at the earth surface. Therefore, a suitable combination of calculation approaches for each component of the energy balance was derived. This reference approach set delivers a very good agreement with measured ground temperatures for locations in Germany. Finally, an extensive parameter study was carried out. The most important parameters are the flow rate in the heat exchanging system, the ground temperature, the groundwater flow (direction and amount), the pipe and shank distance as well as the <b>pipe</b> <b>cover.</b> Furthermore, recommendations for the constructive design of plane and shallow energy geostructures were given. In this case, the avoidance of the heat flow to the inside is one important aspect to prevent a thermal circuit...|$|E
