40|$|At {{the onset}} of the study it is {{necessary}} to mention that its topic will be circumscribed to regulations <b>on</b> parliamentary <b>immunity</b> in the Romanian Constitutions and in comparative law - selective aspects. By this approach, the proposed study opens a complex and complete vision, but not exhaustive, to the reflections on regulation of parliamentary immunity in the Romanian Constitutions and in comparative law. In comparative law analysis, we will keep a symmetrical approach to identifying regulations <b>on</b> parliamentary <b>immunity</b> in the Constitutions of other countries. Following an outline - the following parts of the study are dealt with successively: 1. Introduction. 2. Identification of constitutional rules <b>on</b> parliamentary <b>immunity</b> in the Romanian Constitutions and in comparative law. 3.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} social theoretical literatures <b>on</b> <b>immunity</b> in {{the context}} of contemporary biopolitical debates about antibiotics and antimicrobial resistance (AMR). An exploration of contributions to the online forum ‘Mumsnet’ about antibiotic use and AMR serves as an empirical anchorage to these literatures. Five themes emerge from these data: ‘temporal constraints and technological fixes’; ‘restorative bodies’; ‘spatial othering’; ‘moral accountabilities’ and ‘domestic immunitary environments’. We offer the concept ‘immunitary moralism’ to capture the way antibiotics prompt moral reflection <b>on</b> <b>immunity,</b> biopolitical citizenship, bodily integrity and communal probity. We reveal how the moral politics of blame and immunitary othering are present in online debates about AMR, and explore the way these registers resonate with writings in biopolitical philosophy on the ascendency of immunitary individualism and tensions between community and immunity (communitas and immunitas) ...|$|R
50|$|In October 2008, some German {{newspapers}} {{reported that}} Heilmann was {{under investigation for}} having threatened a former room mate and that the committee <b>on</b> <b>immunity</b> of the Bundestag had lifted his immunity in the matter. Heilmann denied this and had a counter statement published. (According to taz charges were filed due to attempted coercion ("versuchte Nötigung"). Heilmann's counter statement fits to this explanation as he states that the committee <b>on</b> <b>immunity</b> of the Bundestag has dealt on October 17 with the matter in question related to short messages he sent to his former room mate.) This matter was reported in Heilmann's Wikipedia article. This claim, as well as claims that he had withheld parts of his Stasi records, were also cited by Heilmann as reasons for his action against Wikimedia Deutschland.|$|R

The thesis looks in detail at the provisions <b>on</b> <b>immunity</b> in the constitutions which were in force in the Czech lands after 1848; it also gives {{an overview of the}} cases of allowing deputy prosecutions during 1918 - 1938 and under the communist rule (1948 - 1989).
