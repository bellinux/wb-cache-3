ISPs are under no obligation to monitor whether its patrons are sending funds to <b>payment</b> <b>processors</b> or even directly to gambling sites. But once it receives notice from a U.S. Attorney or a state attorney general, the ISP can be forced to appear at a hearing to be ordered to sever its links.|$|R
