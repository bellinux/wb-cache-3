40|$|Hypothesis: Medicare health {{maintenance}} organizations (HMOs) do not {{reduce the cost of}} colon resections in elderly patients. Design Review of prospectively collected and mandatory reported Florida hospital discharge data from January 1, 1995, through December 31, 1999. We used the 2 test for trend analysis to assess significant change in age, mortality, and complications, and the Kruskal-Wallis test to compare inflation-adjusted hospital charges, comorbidity, length of stay, and secondary procedures. Setting Administrative database including all community- and university-based surgeons. Patients All patients 70 years or older who underwent colon resection from 1995 through 1999. Main Outcome Measures Age, mortality, complications, length of stay, number of comorbidities and secondary procedures, hospital charges, and type of colon resection. Results: The frequency of different colon resections increased by 10 % to 30 % from 1995 through 1999. Total hospital charges increased during the study period (P<. 001), whereas mortality and complications remained unchanged. Length of stay, number of secondary procedures, and comorbidities were the most significant contributors to hospital charges. Despite a significantly shorter hospital stay, Medicare HMO patients had similar hospital charges to those of original Medicare patients. Conclusions: Colon resections can be undertaken in elderly patients with acceptable morbidity. <b>Per</b> <b>diem</b> <b>charges</b> were higher for patients covered by Medicare HMO, despite their having shorter lengths of stay, fewer comorbidities, and fewer secondary procedures...|$|E

40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the changes in}} the pattern of clinical activity in a 1900 -bed Belgian teaching hospital in the period 1979 - 1987, we extracted data from the historical files of the hospital's central invoicing system. The total charge for a day of hospitalization, care and treatment increased by 83 %. In this total <b>per</b> <b>diem</b> <b>charge</b> the share of hospital charges in the strict sense declined from 60 to 53 %; the shares of charges for services and for pharmaceuticals rose, respectively, from 29 to 32, and from 10 to 15 %. Within charges for services the share for diagnostic services declined by 22 %; the share for surgery rose by 16 %, and that for miscellaneous other services by 89 %. For diagnostic services the decline was particularly clear for laboratory medicine (- 32 %) and for conventional imaging services (- 22 %), while cardiac and endoscopic investigations show a prominent expansion (+ 78 and + 83 %, respectively). In surgery the growth is quite homogeneous with the charges for urology, ophthalmology and orthopedics as the most important growers. In a group of miscellaneous, not diagnostic nor surgical services, which grows faster than all other groups, there is a marked shift from rather simple to technologically more advanced services. The increase in the pharmacy's bill results from increases in charge for both drugs (+ 49 %) and materials (+ 95 %). We conclude that the observed changes in charges reflect an intensification of care and an impact of technological innovation on clinical practice, including a phenomenon of substitution of old technologies for newer ones. status: publishe...|$|R
