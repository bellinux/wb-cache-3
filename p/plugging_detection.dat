25|$|Windows Vista aims {{to simplify}} the detection, configuration, and {{installation}} of external displays and projectors by introducing a standardized setup procedure and interface. The WDDM architecture in Windows Vista enables hot <b>plug</b> <b>detection</b> of external displays and alerts the new Transient Multimon Manager (TMM) when an external display is connected to a system, which then presents an Aero Wizard interface for the configuration and setup of the display. In previous versions of Windows, installation routines for displays often varied based on hardware configurations such as function keys and specific manufacturer requirements, and typically required separate software interfaces. When possible, the TMM also saves user preferences for individual displays to improve mobility scenarios as these preferences can then be restored when a display is reconnected at a different time or location. The aforementioned improvements are intended to enable a display connectivity experience that provides the ease of use observed with plug and play peripherals.|$|R

40|$|Blastocyst {{implantation}} is {{a critical}} stage {{in the establishment of}} pregnancy. Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) is essential for mouse blastocyst implantation and also plays a role in human pregnancy. We examined the effect of a potent LIF antagonist (LA) on mouse implantation. In mice, LIF expression peaks on day 3. 5 of pregnancy (D 3. 5) (D 0. 5 = day of mating <b>plug</b> <b>detection)</b> in the uterine glandular epithelium. LA (7 mg/kg per day) administered from D 2. 5 to D 4. 5 via four hourly i. p. injections plus continuous administration via miniosmotic pump resulted in complete implantation failure. To improve its pharmacokinetic properties, we conjugated LA to polyethylene glycol (PEG), achieving a significant increase in serum levels. PEGylated LA (PEGLA) (37. 5 mg/kg per day) administered via three i. p. injections between D 2. 5 and D 3. 5 also resulted in complete implantation failure. PEGLA immunolocalized to the uterine luminal epithelium at the time of blastocyst implantation. Both LA and PEGLA reduced phosphorylation of the downstream signaling molecule STAT 3 in luminal epithelial cells on D 3. 5. The effects of PEGLA were found to be endometrial, with no embryo-lethal effects observed. These data demonstrate that administration of a PEGylated LIF antagonist is an effective method of targeting LIF signaling in the endometrium and a promising novel approach in the development of nonhormonal contraceptives for women...|$|R
40|$|Adequate {{differentiation}} or decidualization of endometrial stromal cells (ESC) {{is critical}} for successful pregnancy in humans and rodents. Here, we investigated the role of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) in human and murine decidualization. Ex vivo human (H) ESC decidualization was induced by estrogen (E, 10 − 8 M) plus medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA, 10 − 7 M). Exogenous LIF (≥ 50 ng/ml) induced STAT 3 phosphorylation in non-decidualized and decidualized HESC and enhanced E+MPA-induced decidualization (measured by PRL secretion, P 100 pg/mg G-CSF, IL 6, IL 8, and MCP 1. Decidualized HESC secreted IL 6, IL 8, IL 15 and MCP 1. LIF (50 ng/ml) up-regulated IL 6 and IL 15 (P< 0. 05) secretion in decidualized HESC compared to 0. 5 ng/ml LIF. In murine endometrium, LIF and LIFR immunolocalized to decidualized stromal cells on day 5 of gestation (day 0  = day of <b>plug</b> <b>detection).</b> Western blotting confirmed that LIF and the LIFR were up-regulated in intra-implantation sites compared to inter-implantation sites on Day 5 of gestation. To determine the role of LIF during in vivo murine decidualization, intra-peritoneal injections of a long-acting LIF antagonist (PEGLA; 900 or 1200 µg) were given just post-attachment, during the initiation of decidualization on day 4. PEGLA treatment reduced implantation site decidual area (P< 0. 05) and desmin staining immuno-intensity (P< 0. 05) compared to control on day 6 of gestation. This study demonstrated that LIF was an important regulator of decidualization in humans and mice and data provides insight into the processes underlying decidualization, which are important for understanding implantation and placentation...|$|R

40|$|The current paper {{describes}} {{the development and}} characterization of a pillar array chip that is constructed out of a sandwich of cyclo olefin polymer (COP) sheets. The silicon master of a 5 cm long pillar array was embossed into the COP, yielding 4. 3 µm deep pillars of 15. 3 µm diameter with an external porosity of 43 % and a well designed sidewall region to avoid side wall induced band broadening. A closed channel configuration was obtained by pressure assisted thermal bonding to a non-processed COP lid. Injection of coumarin dye <b>plugs</b> and <b>detection</b> with a fluorescence microscope showed very close agreement of this channel configuration to theoretical expectations in terms of band broadening. This agreement {{is due to the}} low taper, the optimized sidewall region and the excellent bonding quality between the two polymer sheets, even at the pillar area. Under non-retained conditions (pure methanol as mobile phase), plate heights as low as 4 µm were obtained. Under retained conditions, using the native hydrophobic properties of the COP channel (in 70 / 30 v/v water/methanol mixture as mobile phase), a minimum plate height of 6 µm was obtained. A 4 component separation was successfully achieved, demonstrating that COP is a cheap and efficient alternative for silicon and silica based liquid chromatography formats...|$|R
40|$|This article {{describes}} plug-based microﬂuidic technology that enables rapid detection and drug susceptibility screening of bacteria in samples, including complex biological matrices, without preincubation. Unlike conventional bacterial culture and detection methods, which rely on incubation {{of a sample}} to increase the concentration of bacteria to detectable levels, this method conﬁnes individual bacteria into droplets nanoliters in volume. When single cells are conﬁned into plugs of small volume such that the loading is less than one bacterium per <b>plug,</b> the <b>detection</b> time is proportional to plug volume. Conﬁnement increases cell density and allows released molecules to accumulate around the cell, eliminating the pre-incubation step and reducing {{the time required to}} detect the bacteria. We refer to this approach as ‘stochastic conﬁnement’. Using the microﬂuidic hybrid method, this technology was used to determine the antibiogram – or chart of antibiotic sensitivity – of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) to many antibiotics in a single experiment and to measure the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the drug cefoxitin (CFX) against this strain. In addition, this technology was used to distinguish between sensitive and resistant strains of S. aureus in samples of human blood plasma. High-throughput microﬂuidic techniques combined with single-cell measurements also enable multiple tests to be performed simultaneously on a single sample containing bacteria. This technology may provide a method of rapid and effective patient-speciﬁc treatment of bacterial infections and could be extended to a variety of applications that require multiple functional tests of bacterial samples on reduced timescales...|$|R
40|$|Are other HOX genes, in {{addition}} to HOXA 10, involved in endometrial receptivity? The highly expressed HOXA 9, HOXA 11 and HOXD 10 genes also appear {{to be involved in}} endometrial receptivity. Within the HOX family of homeobox transcription factor genes are the leading candidates for the regulation of embryonic implantation. A crucial role of HOXA 10 in endometrial receptivity has been well established. To identify HOX candidate genes, we performed data mining on all 39 human HOX genes in the 'Human body index' gene expression database of normal human tissue. The temporal and spatial expression pattern of four highly expressed HOX genes in the human endometrium was determined. To further investigate the function of these Hox genes, we used a robust in vivo mouse model in which we blocked maternal Hox gene expression. Analysis of a gene expression profile set in the public domain consisting of 504 samples representing 95 different normal human tissues, showed that {{in addition}} to HOXA 10, also HOXA 9, HOXA 11, HOXB 6 and HOXD 10 mRNA showed increased expression in the human endometrium (16 samples). The temporal and spatial expression pattern of these four HOX genes throughout the menstrual cycle was determined in the endometrium from 27 female patients eligible for IVF-embryo transfer with a normal cycle by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), western blot and immunohistochemistry. The role of maternal Hoxa 9, Hoxa 11 and Hoxd 10 was assessed in a mouse implantation model by expression knockdown using RNA interference. Forty mice were transfected with Hoxa 9 -, Hoxa 11 - or Hoxd 10 -specific small hairpin RNA (shRNA) constructs or a vector control by injection into the uterine horn at Day 2 after vaginal <b>plug</b> <b>detection</b> (Day 1) (160 mice in total). The effects were examined by qRT-PCR and western blot at Day 4 and litter sizes counted at Day 9 of pregnancy. HOXA 10, HOXA 9, HOXA 11 and HOXD 10 all showed increased expression during the mid-secretory phase of the menstrual cycle (P < 0. 01). Knockdown of Hoxa 9, Hoxa 11 and Hoxd 10 in the murine uterus resulted in significantly reduced average implantation rates (P < 0. 01) and, with regard to four Hox target genes, also correlated with a significantly increased empty spiracles homolog 2 (Emx 2) and insulin-like growth factor binding protein- 1 (Igfbp 1), and decreased integrin β 3 (Itgb 3) and leukemia inhibitory factor (Lif), expression (P < 0. 01). Menstrual cycle stage was not confirmed by serum hormone analysis. We verified the absence of significant differences in stage-specific expression of the reference genes used in our study (ACTB/Actb and GAPDH/Gapdh) and therefore possible limitations of this approach were minimized. In addition, the translatability of our data from a mouse model to patients needs to be investigated further. We provide evidence that three other HOX genes {{in addition to}} HOXA 10 are involved in endometrial receptivity, and that part of their function is asserted through several known HOX target genes, suggesting the presence of a central HOX signal transduction pathwa...|$|R

40|$|The goal of {{the present}} work {{was to develop a}} {{microchip}} for amplification and detection of mRNA by employing nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (NASBA) technology. The technology platform should in principle be adaptable for any clinical analysis using mRNA or ssDNA as a target. To demonstrate the microchip functionality, identification of human papillomavirus (HPV) type 16, the etiological agent for cervical cancer has been used. The work shows for the first time successful real-time amplification and detection employing NASBA in microsystem formats using custom-made instruments. The first silicon-glass chips contained reaction chambers of 10 nl and 50 nl, which decreased the NASBA reaction volume by a factor of 2000 and 400, respectively. Further, experiments employing cyclic olefin copolymer (COC) microchips for simultaneous amplification and detection, automatically distributed the sample into 10 parallel reaction channels with detection volumes of 80 nl. In order to detect the simultaneous amplification in the reaction channels, a second custom-made optical detection system with increased sensitivity, heat regulation and an automatic non-contact pumping mechanism, was made. Dilution series of both artificial HPV 16 oligonucleotides and SiHa cell lines showed that the detection limits for the microchips were comparable to those obtained for experiments performed in conventional routine-based laboratory-systems. For experiments related {{to the development of a}} self-contained microchip for NASBA, the detection volume was increased to 500 nl due to the advantage of an increased fluorescence signal. For the NASBA reaction, biocompatible surfaces are critical. It was not possible to amplify any target in microchips with native silicon or COC surfaces. Adsorption measurements indicated clearly that fluorescently labelled mouse IgG bound non-specifically to the hydrophobic native COC surfaces, while PEG coated COC surfaces showed adequate protein resistance. Of the coatings tested for the COC microchips, surfaces modified with PEG showed the best biocompatibility. Successful amplification was obtained with silicon microchips when the surfaces were modified with either SigmaCote™ or SiO 2. In order to integrate the NASBA reagents on chip, a thorough evaluation of the reagents to be spotted and dried was performed. Because of the limited number of microchipsavailable, it was necessary to map the most critical parameters on macroscale prior to transfer to the microscale. The DMSO and sorbitol enclosed in the standard NASBA reaction mixture were difficult to dry, and therefore it was necessary to add these compounds to the oligonucleotides or the sample of extracted nucleic acids before the sample was applied on the amplification chip. The standard NASBA reagents consist of the two main solutions, mastermix and enzymes, in addition to the sample. Both the mastermix and the enzymes were stable only when spotted and dried separately. Protectants, such as PEG and trehalose were essential for recovery of enzymatic activity after drying on macroscale. The times for diffusion of modified molecular beacons in dried mastermix and of fluorescently labelled mouse IgG in the dried enzyme solution were ~ 60 seconds and ~ 10 minutes, respectively. So far, only dried enzymes with 0. 05 % PEG protectant have been successfully amplified on chip. Successful amplification using a rehydrated mastermix on microchip still remains. Optimal design and fabrication methods of the microchips were found to be crucial for chip performance. Rough surfaces do not only create background noise for the optical measurements, but it also contributes to generation of bubbles and problems related to manipulation of the sample within the channel network. The silicon microchips were manufactured with optically smooth surfaces. However, low surface roughness was not easily obtained for the COC microchips. Of the fabrication methods evaluated, it was the injection moulded chips which showed the smoothest surfaces, closely followed by the hot embossed chips. Milled and laser ablated chips produced the roughest surfaces. A novel non-contact pumping mechanism based on on-chip flexible COC membranes, combined with actuation pins in the surrounding instrument, was tested and evaluated. The mechanism enabled metering, isolation and movement of nanoliter sized sample plugs in parallel reaction channels. The COC chips with integrated pumps were able to simultaneously move parallel sample plugs along the reaction channels in four different positions. Each reaction channel contained a set of 4 actuation chambers in order to obtain metering, isolation and movement of the sample <b>plug</b> into the <b>detection</b> area. The pump accuracy depended on the evaporation of sample and the deformation of the COC membranes. The results presented in this work are promising with regard to the development of a complete integrated and self-contained mRNA amplification microchip for multi-parallel target testing of clinical samples...|$|R
