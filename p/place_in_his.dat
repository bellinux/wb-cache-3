5|$|In {{every other}} {{transaction}} of life no man's wits {{could be more}} regular than those of Smart, for this prevalence of one idea pertinaciously keeping the first <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> head had in no sense, except in what immediately related to itself, perverted his judgement at all; his opinions were unchanged as before, nor did he seem more likely to fall {{into a state of}} distraction than any other man; less so, perhaps, as he calmed every violent start of passion by prayer.|$|E

5|$|When John Diefenbaker {{took office}} as Prime Minister of Canada on June 21, 1957, only one Progressive Conservative MP, Earl Rowe, {{had served in}} federal {{governmental}} office, {{for a brief period}} under Bennett in 1935. Rowe was no friend of Diefenbaker, and was given no <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> government. Diefenbaker appointed Ellen Fairclough as Secretary of State for Canada, the first woman to be appointed to a Cabinet post, and Michael Starr as Minister of Labour, the first Canadian of Ukrainian descent to serve in Cabinet.|$|E
5|$|Brashear was {{not given}} an {{extension}} during the season, and {{prior to the start}} of the free agency he indicated that he would like to return to Washington, citing the prospect of winning a Stanley Cup. Brashear noted that at his age and <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> career, taking care of his family was his top priority and that money would be the deciding factor in his destination. The Capitals, however, opted not re-sign him. After initial talks with the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL)'s Vityaz Chekhov, he eventually agreed to a two-year, $2.8 million contract with the New York Rangers. At an event for season-ticket holders, Brashear was booed due to the altercation with the Rangers in the previous post-season. He set a personal milestone during the 2009–10 season by playing in his 1,000th NHL game on November 12 against the Atlanta Thrashers.|$|E

5|$|Dominic Johnson {{participated in}} {{athletics}} as a pole vaulter, {{returning to the}} Olympics for his third time; Johnson had previously participated as a pole vaulter (and, at one time, a relay runner) on behalf of Saint Lucia in the 2000 Summer Olympics and 1996 Summer Olympics. Johnson flew to San Diego days before the competition cutoff and made the qualifying preliminary height for the Olympics shortly after winning a silver medal at the Central American and Caribbean Championships in Cali, Columbia. Johnson's event took place on 20 August 2008. With a height of 5.30 metres, Johnson did not qualify, although he tied for seventeenth <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> qualifying group. As such, he did not advance. Johnson tied with the Czech pole vaulter Štěpán Janáček for thirtieth place overall.|$|E
5|$|For Thanksgiving 1988, {{his family}} spent the holiday with him, {{although}} he had developed neuropathy and was increasingly bed-ridden and reliant on morphine; he died in his bed on December 16, 1988 {{at the age of}} 41. Sylvester had planned his own funeral, insisting that he be dressed in a red kimono and placed in an open-top coffin for the mourners to see, with his friend Yvette Flunder doing his corpse's makeup. He wanted Tracy to sing at his funeral, accompanied by choirs and many flowers. The whole affair took <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> church, the Love Center, with a sermon being provided by Reverend Walter Hawkins. The event was packed, with standing room only, and the coffin was subsequently taken and buried at his family's plot in Inglewood Park Cemetery. An album titled Immortal was posthumously released; it contained Sylvester's final studio recordings, and was compiled by Marty Blecman.|$|E

En route to Australia, Tarbuck met with Admiral Chester Nimitz, who told him {{in no uncertain terms}} that anti-Army and anti-MacArthur sentiments had no <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> command. As it was, Tarbuck became a loyal supporter of MacArthur.|$|E

5|$|In late 2003, Bindrich came {{in fifth}} in the German Youth Championship U18 which got him elected to the German Under-18 team. He gained his first Inter{{national}} Master norm in 2004 for the B national team in the Mitropa Cup. After this he attended tournaments in several Eastern countries, such as Krakow, Budapest, Moscow and Riga. Later that year Bindrich supported the German Cancer Society by holding a simultaneous exhibition. In 2005, he earned his second IM norm in a grandmaster tournament in Crimea. Bindrich settled first <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> first adult event in the early January 2006 Staufer Open {{and a few days}} later in Geneva, he earned his 3rd and final IM norm, and was awarded the International Master title.|$|E

The caretaker and his wife leave for Varanasi after taking {{the money for the}} rent, leaving the caretaker's daughter, Kannamma (Manorama), and brother-in-law, Ramaiah (Nagesh), in charge {{of the house and the}} guests. JB decides not to reveal his true identity, pretending instead to be JB's personal secretary Balu, and pays the rent for a <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> own house. Ramaiah, who has never met JB, takes the money and gives JB's room to Balu.|$|E
5|$|Jamaican-born runner Derrick Atkins was {{the only}} Bahamian to {{participate}} in the men's 100meters race at the Beijing Olympics. Atkins was placed in the eighth heat during the 14 August qualification round, facing athletes that included Russia's Andrey Epishin and Norway's Jaysuma Saidy Ndure. Atkins ranked first in his heat of eight athletes with a time of 10.28seconds, defeating second-place heat finalist Epishin by 0.06seconds. Of the 80 athletes who participated in the qualification round of the event, Atkins tied Cuban Jenris Vizcaino for eighteenth place. He advanced to quarterfinals on 15 August. At quarterfinals, Atkins participated in the fifth heat against athletes that included Walter Dix of the United States and Asafa Powell of Jamaica. Atkins finished in third <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> heat with a time of 10.14seconds, falling behind Walter Dix, who ranked second with a time of 10.08seconds; and placing ahead of Antigua and Barbuda's Daniel Bailey, who ranked fourth with a time of 10.23seconds.

5|$|The {{earliest}} known {{version of}} the Romeo and Juliet tale akin to Shakespeare's play {{is the story of}} Mariotto and Gianozza by Masuccio Salernitano, in the 33rd novel of his Il Novellino published in 1476. Salernitano sets the story in Siena and insists its events took <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> own lifetime. His {{version of the}} story includes the secret marriage, the colluding friar, the fray where a prominent citizen is killed, Mariotto's exile, Gianozza's forced marriage, the potion plot, and the crucial message that goes astray. In this version, Mariotto is caught and beheaded and Gianozza dies of grief.|$|E
5|$|The {{execution}} of Victor Peirce in episode eight {{is portrayed as}} taking <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> car {{at the front of}} his home, but Peirce was shot dead while parked opposite a supermarket in Bay Street, Port Melbourne. The murder of alleged drug dealer Willie Thompson was portrayed in episode ten as Thompson being shot after leaving a martial arts class in broad daylight. However, Thompson was shot dead at around 9:30 pm, and the murder occurred on Waverley Road in the Melbourne suburb of Chadstone, as he began to drive off in his car, directly outside the entrance to the martial arts centre. Another fiction portrayed was the murder of Nik Radev by both Victor Brincat and Andrew Veniamin in the late hours of the night when Radev was in fact ambushed on a residential street in Coburg in the company of two bodyguards in the late afternoon.|$|E
5|$|Wallace {{returns to}} Sarawak, where {{he stays in}} the {{circular}} 'head-house' of a Dyak village, travels upriver, and describes the Durian, praising it as the king of fruits with exquisite and unsurpassed flavour, and the Dyak's slender bamboo bridges, as well as ferns and Nepenthes pitcher plants. On a mountain he finds the only <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> entire journey where moths are abundant; he collected 1,386 moths on a total of 26 nights, but over 800 of these were caught on four very wet and dark nights. He attributes the reason to having a ceiling that effectively trapped the moths; in other houses the moths at once escaped into the roof, and he recommends naturalists to bring a verandah-shaped tent {{to enable them to}} catch moths.|$|E

After a race-long duel with the Ferrari of close friend Fernando Alonso, Webber {{finished}} his final race {{in second place}} behind teammate Sebastian Vettel, setting the fastest lap of the race. By finishing second, Webber jumped from fifth to third in the final championship standings, overtaking both Lewis Hamilton and Kimi Räikkönen, who did not compete {{in the final two}} races of the season. Despite their frosty relationship and winning his thirteenth race of the year (and ninth in succession), Vettel was happy to hand the spotlight on the podium in Brazil to his retiring teammate, congratulating him on his career.|$|E
5|$|After his Grand Prix racing career {{ended in}} 1983, Roberts briefly {{considered}} an auto racing career {{before deciding to}} field a Grand Prix team. In 1984, he entered a team into the 250cc world championship with riders Wayne Rainey and Alan Carter using Yamaha bikes. In 1986 he moved up to the 500cc world championship with riders Randy Mamola and Mike Baldwin. After returning to the United States {{to compete in the}} AMA Superbike championship, Wayne Rainey re-joined the team in 1988, finishing in third <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> inaugural 500cc season then, improving to second place behind Eddie Lawson in 1989. In 1990, Roberts secured the financial support of the Marlboro cigarette company, and his team became the official Yamaha factory racing team. Rainey and John Kocinski won the 500cc and 250cc world championships in 1990, making Roberts the most successful team manager in Grand Prix racing at the time. Rainey went on to win three consecutive 500cc world championships for Roberts' team. After Rainey was left paralyzed in a crash at the 1993 Italian Grand Prix, the Roberts team continued racing with Luca Cadalora as their main rider, but struggled during a period dominated by Honda and their rider, Mick Doohan.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the court {{vacation}} in August 1904, Hastings decided that {{it would be best to}} find a tenancy in a more prestigious set of chambers; Corbet only dealt with two or three cases a year, and solicitors were unlikely to give briefs to a barrister of whom they had never heard. The set of chambers below Corbet's was run by Charles Gill, a well-respected barrister. Hastings would be able to improve his career through an association with Gill, but Gill did not actually know Hastings and had no reason to offer him a <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> chambers. Hastings decided he would spend the court vacation writing a law book, and introduce himself to Gill by asking if he would mind having the book dedicated to him. Hastings wrote the book on the subject of the law relating to money-lending, something he knew very little about. He got around this by including large extracts from the judgements in cases related to money-lending, which increased the size of the book and reduced how much he would actually have to write.|$|E
