5|$|Standard owes {{protection}} {{money from}} his time in prison and is beaten up by Albanian gangster Cook, who demands that Standard rob a <b>pawnshop</b> for $40,000 {{to pay off the}} debt. Cook gives Benicio a bullet as a symbol that he and his mother are in danger. The Driver, concerned for the safety of Irene and Benicio, offers to act as the getaway driver for the <b>pawnshop</b> robbery.|$|E
5|$|The job goes awry {{when the}} <b>pawnshop</b> owner shoots and kills Standard while the Driver {{is waiting for}} him with Cook's accomplice, Blanche. Pursued by a mysterious adversary, the Driver and Blanche escape after an intense car chase. The Driver hides with Blanche in a motel where he learns from a news report that Standard, {{according}} to the <b>pawnshop</b> owner, performed the robbery by himself and that no money had been stolen. When she lies about being oblivious to the second car when the Driver interrogates her, he slaps Blanche and threatens to hurt her {{to get her to}} talk. Blanche then admits that the bag contains a million dollars and that she and Cook planned to re-steal the money using the car that chased them. Two of Cook's men ambush them in the motel room, and kill Blanche before the Driver manages to kill them both.|$|E

Analyzing data from a report released in 1997 by the National Institute of Justice, fewer than 2% of convicted criminals bought their firearm {{at a flea market}} or gun show. About 12% purchased their firearm from a retail store or <b>pawnshop,</b> and 80% bought from family, friends, or an illegal source.|$|E

5|$|Later, Stottlemeyer and Disher {{watch the}} film's {{shooting}} and Natalie's prediction is right: Ruskin has impersonated Monk {{to the point}} that he is unable to complete the sequence because he is hassled by the setting's disorder. He leaves the studio, goes to Monk's house to know what are his reasons to do his job, and explores Monk's files on Trudy's murder, grieving Monk. An afflicted Monk goes to Natalie's house, where he solves the case when he sees torn paper by Julie to prevent Natalie from reading it. The <b>pawnshop</b> is adjacent to a restaurant, where clients are drawn on the wall. On the crime's night, Leverett and Cullman were sketched and Leverett tried to destroy the evidence.|$|E
5|$|The Princess Block {{disappeared}} from Henderson’s Directory, a local city directory, in 1956, implying that its researchers {{thought it was}} completely vacant. The building was re-included in 1960, but the theatre's former address at 10337 Whyte Avenue remained vacant and unlisted for another six years. By 1966, the exterior doors had been removed entirely to create storefronts (see photo), and the theatre itself had been occupied by Quick Cash Exchange, a <b>pawnshop.</b> The third floor was split into several apartments, while the second floor was entirely occupied by Strathcona TV and Columbia Photo Studio. The basement was still a pool hall, Princess Billiards.|$|E
5|$|The next day, Ruskin follows Monk {{again as}} he investigates a case at a <b>pawnshop</b> in which its owner was shot during a robbery. Monk is {{intrigued}} {{as to why the}} burglar entered through the wall and only stole a small amount of money and a wristwatch. After discussing if Ruskin's presence can harm Monk, Natalie (Traylor Howard) and Monk find the crime's weapon. Monk finds the same glitter he found on Cullman's hair in the gun and argues the thief stole the watch to replace his one, deducing that the same person committed both crimes.|$|E

5|$|A {{variety of}} occupations could be chosen or {{inherited}} from a father's line of work. This would include – {{but was not}} limited to – coffinmakers, ironworkers and blacksmiths, tailors, cooks and noodle-makers, retail merchants, tavern, teahouse, or winehouse managers, shoemakers, seal cutters, <b>pawnshop</b> owners, brothel heads, and merchant bankers engaging in a proto-banking system involving notes of exchange. Virtually every town had a brothel where female and male prostitutes could be had. Male catamites fetched a higher price than female concubines since pederasty with a teenage boy was seen as a mark of elite status, regardless of sodomy being repugnant to sexual norms. Public bathing became much more common than in earlier periods. Urban shops and retailers sold a variety of goods such as special paper money to burn at ancestral sacrifices, specialized luxury goods, headgear, fine cloth, teas, and others. Smaller communities and townships too poor or scattered to support shops and artisans obtained their goods from periodic market fairs and traveling peddlers. A small township also provided a place for simple schooling, news and gossip, matchmaking, religious festivals, traveling theater groups, tax collection, and bases of famine relief distribution.|$|E

President Arista named him director of the Monte de Piedad (national <b>pawnshop),</b> a position which he held until 1853. He died on 10 February 1854 in his modest house in Tacubaya.

Mary Margaret and David run up to Emma to hug her, while Henry runs to Regina and hugs both her and Emma. As Neal begins to wake up, David tells Mary Margaret to forget what happened under the curse, then the couple kiss. Finally, Gold checks on Belle as she is sleeping, when Hook arrived to the <b>pawnshop</b> and tells him Henry got away. Gold asks how he failed at kidnapping a child, only to have Hook respond to that answer by saying his heart wasn't in it. Since Gold knows that the Snow Queen’s plan failed, he tells Hook it’s his last day on earth. Hook makes a final request as a dying wish to leave Emma {{and the rest of}} Storybrooke intact. Gold says as long as Emma doesn't get in his way, she’ll survive. He says once he steps over the line with his magic, they have nothing to fear from him – but says he can’t make that promise {{for the rest of the}} world. Confident that he will go through with his plans, a smug but sinister Gold leaves the <b>pawnshop</b> to walk out into the fresh Storybrooke snowy air.|$|E

25|$|The {{youngest}} of three sons, Donizetti {{was born in}} 1797 in Bergamo's Borgo Canale quarter located just outside the city walls. His family was very poor and had no tradition of music, his father Andrea being the caretaker of the town <b>pawnshop.</b> Simone Mayr, a German composer of internationally successful operas, had become maestro di cappella at Bergamo's principal church in 1802. He founded the Lezioni Caritatevoli school in Bergamo in 1805 {{for the purpose of}} providing musical training, including classes in literature, beyond what choirboys ordinarily received up until the time that their voices broke.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} effect of the market for stolen goods on crime, using county level data for the United States between 1997 and 2010. We analyze this issue through the lens of <b>pawnshops,</b> a {{widespread}} business that offers secured loans to people, with items of personal property used as collateral. The endogeneity of <b>pawnshops</b> to crime is addressed exploiting the exogenous shift in the gold price - the main determinant of pawnbrokers' profit function - as a quasi natural experiment, where the intensity of the treatment is given by the initial concentration of <b>pawnshops</b> in the county. A one standard deviation increase in pawnshops' concentration raises by 0. 05 standard deviation {{the effect of}} gold price on burglaries and robberies. No effect is detected on all other crimes...|$|R

He then moved with his family back to San Francisco, where they lived in an apartment above the newly built bar, the old one having previously been torn down {{to make way for}} a freeway entrance. Two months later, on Garcia's fifteenth birthday, his mother bought an accordion for him, to his great disappointment. Garcia had long been captivated by many rhythm and blues artists, especially Chuck Berry and Bo Diddley: his one wish at this point was to have an electric guitar. After some pleading, his mother exchanged the accordion for a Danelectro with a small amplifier at a local <b>pawnshop.</b> Garcia's stepfather, who was somewhat proficient with instruments, helped tune his guitar to an unusual open tuning.|$|E

25|$|The crowd {{began to}} attack Black {{areas of the}} city, moving to the Levee (Seventh and Washington), a {{predominantly}} Black business area. It included dives and saloons {{as well as some}} official businesses. First, the mob attacked the <b>pawnshop</b> of John Olberman, who was Jewish, and stole guns and ammunition. Then, they destroyed a total of 35 other Black-owned businesses, and shattered windows and storefronts all along Washington Street. Among the businesses destroyed were saloons owned by two Black business and political leaders, one an active Republican and the other a Democrat. Three White men were shot in the conflict, allegedly by Blacks defending their businesses on Washington Street. One of the White victims was crushed by the mob, and two others died later of their wounds. Otherwise, about half of the reported casualties were from gunfire and about a quarter from bricks hurled into the crowd.|$|E
50|$|The {{pawnbroker}} {{assumes the}} risk that an item might have been stolen. However, laws in many jurisdictions protect both the community and broker from unknowingly handling stolen goods (also known as fencing). These laws often require that the pawnbroker establish positive identification of the seller through photo identification (such as a driver's license or government-issued identity document), {{as well as a}} holding period placed on an item purchased by a pawnbroker (to allow time for local law enforcement authorities to track stolen items). In some jurisdictions, <b>pawnshops</b> must give a list of all newly pawned items and any associated serial number to police, so the police can determine if any of the items have been reported stolen. Many police departments advise burglary or robbery victims to visit local <b>pawnshops</b> {{to see if they can}} locate stolen items. Some <b>pawnshops</b> set up their own screening criteria to avoid buying stolen property.|$|R
50|$|The pawnbrokers were {{undermined}} by the Second World War during The Japanese occupation of Hong Kong but they flourished again after the war in 1945 because of the inflation and shortage of resources. To circulate and resolve fund and finance, the Hong Kong Government urged the pawn industry to revive itself. With the support of government, The Hong Kong & Kowloon Pawnbrokers' Association Limited {{was set up in}} 1947. There were only 11 members at the time. Between 1950 and 1960 the number of members increased to more than 90, reaching 138 in 1994. Today it has more than 161 members and coupled with non-member <b>pawnshops,</b> there are approximately 250 <b>pawnshops</b> in Hong Kong. <b>Pawnshops</b> are mainly located in Hong Kong Island, particularly Central, and Kowloon, and since many jewellers and goldsmiths shop are located in Central, the mortgage and loan amount is usually higher.|$|R
