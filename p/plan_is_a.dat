The Israeli government gave up hope for negotiated settlement to the conflict and pursued a unilateral policy of physically separating Israel from Palestinian communities by beginning construction on the Israeli West Bank barrier.

25|$|The Elon Peace <b>Plan</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> {{solution}} for the Arab-Israeli conflict proposed in 2002 by former minister Binyamin Elon.

All these actions should be done in agreement with Jordan and the Palestinian population. This solution is tied to the demographics of Jordan where it's claimed that Jordan is essentially already the Palestinian state, as it has so many Palestinian refugees and their descendants.|$|E

25|$|The Mayor of Terminus City, Salvor Hardin, {{proposes to}} play the planets against each other. His <b>plan</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> success; the Foundation remains untouched, and he is {{promoted}} to Mayor of Terminus (the planet). Meanwhile, {{the minds of the}} Foundation continue to develop newer and greater technologies which are smaller and more powerful than the Empire's equivalents. Using its scientific advantage, Terminus develops trade routes with nearby planets, eventually taking them over when its technology becomes a much-needed commodity. The interplanetary traders effectively become the new diplomats to other planets. One such trader, Hober Mallow, becomes powerful enough to challenge and win the seat of Mayor and, by cutting off supplies to a nearby region, also succeeds in adding more planets to the Foundation's reach.|$|E
25|$|The great gate {{stands to}} the north of the {{entrance}} forecourt (jilaukhana) and provides a symbolic transition between the worldly realm of bazaars and caravanserai and the spiritual realm of the paradise garden, mosque and the mausoleum. Its rectangular <b>plan</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> variation of the 9-part hasht bihisht plan found in the mausoleum. The corners are articulated with octagonal towers giving the structure a defensive appearance. External domes were reserved for tombs and mosques and so the large central space does not receive any outward expression of its internal dome. From within the great gate, the Mausoleum is framed by the pointed arch of the portal. Inscriptions from the Qu'ran are inlaid around the two northern and southern pishtaqs, the southern one 'Daybreak' invites believers to enter the garden of paradise.|$|E
