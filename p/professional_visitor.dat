6000|$|Intenser {{than these}} vague shades {{meanwhile}} is my {{vision of the}} halls of Ferrero--where the orgy of the senses and even the riot of the mind, of which I have just spoken, must quite literally have led me more of a dance than anywhere. Let this sketch of a lost order note withal that under so scant a general provision for infant exercise, as distinguished from infant ease, our hopping and sliding in tune had to be deemed urgent. It was the sense for this form of relief that clearly was general, superseding as the ampler Ferrero scene did previous limited exhibitions; even those, for that matter, coming back {{to me in the}} ancient person of M. Charriau--I guess at the writing of his name--whom I work in but confusedly as a <b>professional</b> <b>visitor,</b> a subject gaped at across a gulf of fear, in one of our huddled schools; all the more that I perfectly evoke him as resembling, with a difference or two, the portraits of the aged Voltaire, and that he had, fiddle in hand and jarret tendu, incited the young agility of our mother and aunt. Edward Ferrero was another matter; in the prime of life, good-looking, romantic and moustachio'd, he was suddenly to figure, on the outbreak of the Civil War, as a General of volunteers--very much {{as if he had been}} one of Bonaparte's improvised young marshals; in anticipation of which, however, he wasn't at all fierce or superior, to my remembrance, but most kind to sprawling youth, in a charming man of the world fashion and as if we wanted but a touch to become also men of the world. Remarkably good-looking, as I say, by the measure of that period, and extraordinarily agile--he could so gracefully leap and bound that his bounding into the military saddle, such occasion offering, had all the felicity, and only wanted the pink fleshings, of the circus--he was still more admired by the mothers, with whom he had to my eyes a most elegant relation, than by the pupils; among all of whom, at the frequent and delightful soirées, he caused trays laden with lucent syrups repeatedly to circulate. The scale of these entertainments, as I figured it, and the florid frescoes, just damp though they were with newness, and the free lemonade, and the freedom of remark, equally great, with the mothers, were the lavish note in him--just as the fact that he never himself fiddled, but was followed, over the shining parquet, by attendant fiddlers, represented doubtless a shadow the less on his later dignity, so far as that dignity was compassed. Dignity marked in full measure even at the time the presence of his sister Madame Dubreuil, a handsome authoritative person who instructed us equally, in fact preponderantly, and who, though comparatively not sympathetic, so engaged, physiognomically, my wondering interest, that I hear to this hour her shrill Franco-American accent: [...] "Don't look at me, little boy--look at my feet." [...] I see them now, these somewhat fat members, beneath the uplifted skirt, encased in [...] "bronzed" [...] slippers, without heels but attached, by graceful cross-bands over her white stockings, to her solid ankles--an emphatic sign of the time; not less than I recover my surprised sense of their supporting her without loss of balance, substantial as she was, in the [...] "first position"; her command of which, her ankles clapped close together and her body very erect, was so perfect that even with her toes, right and left, fairly turning the corner backward, she never fell prone on her face.|$|E
40|$|One of {{the main}} {{determinants}} of successful cultural tourism is clearly responding {{to the needs of}} visitors. Developing explicitly targeted and professional studies to assist planning, design and development is crucial and the importance of professional training for staff must be emphasised. However simply knowing your audience is not enough and part of the dynamics of success must be in the recognition of the importance of those who visit {{as well as those who}} do not. This paper focuses on the need for <b>professional</b> <b>visitor</b> studies that include models of research on the non-visitor. It presents actual and potential studies such as interviews with potential visitors who turn away from the gates of an attraction, focus groups with representatives of non -visiting groups, exit questionnaires at airports etc. In terms of a developing tourism industry, such visitor data will support the development of special packages aimed at cultural tourists, will increase the tourist spend and will position Africa as a key provider of cultural tourism on the world stage...|$|E

Risk factors for seropositivity on non-dairy sheep farms were identified at farm and sheep level by univariate and multivariate multilevel analyses. Based on 953 dairy and 5671 non-dairy serum samples, sheep seroprevalences were 18. 7 per cent and 2. 0 per cent, respectively, and 78. 6 per cent and 30. 5 per cent at farm level.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{examined}} {{to what extent}} tourism {{is present in the}} stay of <b>professional</b> <b>visitors</b> in Barcelona, Spain. Increased opportunities in mobility and ICTs may facilitate this combination of professional and touristic activities. Following the literature, it is hypothesized that this group increasingly includes touristic activity in their professional stay, which may be performed at everyday locations such as workplace and hotel location. After a quantitative analysis of conference visitors’ activities, it was found that tourism and professional activity intermingle in the Barcelona context. However, contrary to expectations, touristic activities were mainly performed at the conventional tourism areas of the city. Furthermore, the use of (public) transport and mobile ICT-devices seem to facilitate touristic activity. The findings indicate that tourism is no longer a single, isolated activity, and should increasingly be seen in relation to daily life activities. The case of professional travel triggers further consequences for tourism research, professional life and urban contexts...|$|R

Data of 107 farms which had been never vaccinated against BHV 1 remained for the analysis. A positive BHV 1 status on these 107 farms could only be caused by introduction of BHV 1. Risk factors for introduction of BHV 1 on the farms were quantified using logistic regression. BHV 1 -positive farms purchased cattle and participated in cattle shows more often compared with BHV 1 -negative farms.

40|$|A 2 -year {{cohort study}} was {{conducted}} to investigate the probability of disease introduction into Dutch dairy farms. The farms were tested regularly for diseases and were visited biannually to collect management data. Ninety-five specific pathogen-free (SPF) dairy farms were selected from a database of bovine herpesvirus type 1 (BHV 1) -free farms to study the probability of, and risk factors for, introduction of BHV 1, bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV), Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serotype Dublin (S. dublin), and Leptospira interrogans serovar hardjo (L. hardjo). Although most of the 95 SPF farms had a low risk on introduction of infectious diseases, one disease was introduced into 12 farms and two diseases were introduced into one farm. Three farms experienced an outbreak of BHV 1, one farm an outbreak of L. hardjo, two farms BVDV, six farms S. dublin, and one farm both BHV 1 and S. dublin. The total incidence rate was 0. 09 (0. 06 – 0. 12) per herd-year at risk. The results suggest that the "non-outbreak" farms were significantly more closed than the "outbreak" farms.
