40|$|This article throws light {{upon the}} history of the national-progressive {{movement}} of the late 19 th and early 20 th century, which is called Jadidism. The history of Jadidism and its evolution from enlightenment to a powerful political movement can be retraced in it. Jadidism became an alternative form of the intellectual renewal of Muslim society. The beginning of the movement was connected with the introduction of the phonetics, so called “usul-i jadid”, method of teaching reading and writing instead of letter and syllabic one in maktabs and madrasas, that is a new method. The Jadids criticized religious fanaticism, required the substitution of obsolete religious schools for national secular ones, advocated the development of science and culture, supported the <b>publishing</b> <b>of</b> <b>newspapers</b> in the native language, the opening of cultural and educational establishments, which favoured the consolidation of the democratic forces of the society. From the very beginning the Jadids were aimed to the reform of the traditional system of education of Muslim religious school, establishing new-method schools, publishing, theatre, social, and political and cultural institutions, which, under their influence, were turning into a powerful ideological weapon in the struggle against economical, moral, and political backwardness of the peoples of Turkestan more and more. They were eager to study the experience and progress of the other people of the world, especially the best practices of the Muslim reformers of the Crimea, the Volga Region, the Transcaucasia, Turkey, and Iran, who had already became aware of the progressive social and political, spiritual and cultural life of Europe. The main merit of the Jadids of Turkestan consists in {{the fact that they were}} the first to ground political arguments of the national liberation movement against Russian colonialism. The national elite of Turkestan discredited the ‘legitimacy’ of the colonial form of government, and later it served as the basis of a powerful political movement...|$|E

40|$|The paper {{investigates the}} {{promotion}} of books through advertising in the newspapers published in Osijek {{in the second half}} of the 19 th century. From late 18 th century and in the course of the 19 th century’s intense developments in the <b>publishing</b> <b>of</b> <b>newspapers</b> and journals, advertising in this medium was one of the ways to promote books. Booksellers and publishers advertised books in newspaper ads, relying on the fact that newspapers had become a common and omnipresent medium for disseminating information. Book advertisements were evidence of the position of books in relation to other aspects of culture and society, of the approach to their promotion and, finally, of the importance of book promotion. In order to investigate how and how much book ads were present, and how Croatian books were promoted and reached the readership, the paper analyses daily and monthly publications, such as Esseker allgemeine illustrierte Zeitung from 1869, Die Drau from 1968 to 1877, and Branislav from 1878. Among the eleven different papers published {{in the second half of}} the 19 th century in Osijek, these were selected for their content, as they were the first illustrated newspapers (Esseker allgemeine illustrierte Zeitung). The investigation focused on the influence of the newly emerged illustrated press and on the influence of the newspapers published in Croatian language (Branislav), as a possible tool for spreading and promotion of Croatian books. Another focus was on the influence of continued publication and on the growth of a steady readership (Die Drau). The papers were analysed with the aim to locate book advertisements which were then subjected to content analysis. Also provided is a brief overview of the book production and publication in Croatia and in Osijek at the time, and an overview of the emergence of newspapers in Osijek with a brief account of the titles selected for study in order to gain an insight into the context in which book ads appeared. It was found that book advertising coincided with the emergence of newspapers, with ads at first appearing only occasionally, but later, with the development and spreading of newspapers, more frequently. Book ads were not, for the most part, included in the sections reserved for advertising but, rather, in the sections covering cultural matters, notices, daily news, etc. Visually, they were not prominent and were addressed at the existing readership, especially in the German newspapers. They may be divided into several categories: ads for books published outside Osijek and Croatia, ads for books available in Osijek’s bookshops, ads for newspapers and journals, and printers’ ads. Only a small number of book ads were printed in the ads section. Information included in the ads covered the title, author’s name, content, price, publisher and the name of the bookseller. Attached is a bibliography of advertisements in the above-listed newspapers.   Keywords: books; book advertising; newspapers; advertisements; Osijek; printing; 19 th century </table...|$|E
40|$|The {{object of}} the {{dissertation}} titled German loanwords in the Croatian digital newspaper corpora was to explore and analyze German loanwords in the contemporary Croatian texts using linguistic technologies supported by subsequent manual data processing. Regarding German loanwords in Croatian language, German-Croatian contacts that left their traces in Croatian can be traced from the prehistoric time (Zepic, 2002). As a consequence of political constellations in European history, Croatian language was {{under the influence of}} the German language until the 20 th century. Due to the intense political and economic contacts, German loanwords entered the Croatian language on a large scale, with the largest acquisitions between 1527 and 1868, when Croatia was part of the Habsburg Monarchy. On the other hand, from the early standardization phase of the Croatian language up to date, the process of language purification is being conducted, which reduced the number of German loanwords in the standard Croatian language. But, for many years, German had an important role in Croatian language and its presence was especially noticeable in daily newspapers that were published in German in various Croatian cities. <b>Publishing</b> <b>of</b> <b>newspapers</b> in German during the history shows the importance and role of German language in Croatia, just as the contemporary daily press tends to be the reflection of the actual state of language. Using language technologies, the research conducted as part of this PhD dissertation revealed to what extent German loanwords are used in Croatian language (i. e., the representation of German loanwords in contemporary Croatian language texts). The method analyzed the appearance of German loanwords in the Croatian corpora and regional daily newspapers. Firstly, we have determined which German loanwords appear in the contemporary Croatian language, and as a source for compiling such a list we used dictionaries of standard Croatian language, dictionaries of foreign words, regional dictionaries and PhD thesis studying German loanwords in the Croatian language (nine sources in total). The analysis of these sources provided a list of 17. 988 different German loanwords. The further comparative computer analysis of these sources showed that all German loanwords were not recorded in all sources. Many German loanwords were recorded in a single source (e. g. Petrovic's Eseker dictionary, which records German words from the Eseker dialect). The compiled list of German loanwords allowed for their computational analysis in the digitized daily press (namely four newspapers collected during the period of twelve months), as well as in the hrWaC web corpus comprising the texts from the whole. hr domain collected over a period of four years. Searching hrWaC, we found 8. 400 German loanwords out of 17. 988 compiled from the nine sources. These 8. 400 lemmas were found in 786. 356 text files in their basic form (nominative case for nouns and adjectives, infinitive form for verbs) or in some other wordform. The manual analysis of these 8. 400 German loanwords showed that some wordforms of these German loanwords were identical to some Croatian words (i. e, they were homonyms). In some cases, these "fake" Germanisms had significantly higher frequency than the "real" German loanwords. Analysis of German loanwords allowed for the classification of German loanwords into two basic groups. The criterion for the classification was the overlap of German loanwords with Croatian language words, in one or all inflectional forms, or lack of such overlap. The first group consists of German loanwords that have a meaning or meanings that bind to the original German word, which were (phonetically and/or morphologically) adapted to Croatian language, but still represent German loanwords. The second group consists of those German loanwords that overlap with some Croatian words (i. e. they represent homonyms). This second group is divided into two sub-groups: the first sub-group consists of homonyms which belong to the same word class (e. g., "grad"- German loanword meaning "level" vs. "grad"- Croatian word meaning "city") while the second subgroup consists of homonyms that belong to different word classes (e. g., "lak"- German loanword meaning "varnish" vs. "lak"- Croatian word meaning "easy"), ie. the noun vs. the adjective). Furthermore, the computer analysis of the frequency of German loanwords in daily newspapers showed that most of them appeared in Rijeka's Novi List. This newspaper is followed by Slobodna Dalmacija and Vecernji list, with a relatively equal number of German loanwords. The lowest frequency of German loanwords was determined in the daily newspaper Glas Slavonije. In the period of twelve months we found a total of 191 German loanwords in four different daily newspapers: Novi List, Slobodna Dalmacija, Vecernji list and Glas Slavonije [...] Given the cross-section of German loanwords found in daily newspapers (191 German loanwords) and hrWaC web corpus, all German loanwords found in newspapers have been confirmed in hrWaC web corpus, since hrWaC contains texts from the entire. hr domain, including digital editions of daily newspapers. Furthemore, language technologies enabled us to determine how often German loanwords appear in contemporary texts - Croatian hrWaC web corpus and regional daily newspapers. Both sources are considered contemporary, since the newspaper and the corpus mirror the everyday use of the Croatian language. This thesis gives the comparative analysis of German loanwords collected from various sources (dictionaries, scientific papers), revealing the overlap and the overlap frequency in all sources as well as the overlap frequency of German loanwords from written sources and contemporary digital texts (daily newspapers and corpus). The study found that German loanwords that are most frequently found in web corpus originate from dictionaries of foreign words. The analysis of the frequency of German loanwords from the "New dictionary of foreign words" by Bratoljub Klaić (2012) and "Dictionary of Foreign Words" by Anic, Klaic & Domovic (2001) showed that 965 German loanwords from these sources had frequency in hrWaC-in greater than 1, 000. This dissertation succeeded to built a mechanism for the analysis of German loanwords in Croatian language that can be applied to other languages. It is important to point out that regardless of the computer preparation and processing, much of the analysis had to be made manually. The analysis of the frequency of German loanwords in the contemporary Croatian language resulted in a frequency dictionary of German loanwords in the Croatian language. Out of four hypotheses, two were proven, one only partially, and one was not proven. The hypothesis that German loanwords are systematically used in Croatian language is partially proven. The analysis revealed that out of 17. 988 German loanwords collected from all written sources, 47...|$|E
