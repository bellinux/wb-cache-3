40|$|In this study, {{conducted}} {{within the}} United Kingdom, the authors compared scores on five cultural values—namely, individualism, collectivism, familism, romanti-cism, and spiritualism—(a) between African-descended persons and European-descended persons and (b) between African-descended persons and Asian-descended persons. We predicted that African-descended persons would score higher than European-descended and Asian-descended <b>persons</b> <b>on</b> collectivism, lower than European-descended <b>persons</b> <b>on</b> individualism, and lower than Asian-descended <b>persons</b> <b>on</b> spiritualism. A total of 227 individuals (92 men, 132 women, and 3 individuals {{who did not}} indicate their gender) participated in the present study. Results of a {{multivariate analysis of variance}} followed by a series of one-way analyses of variance and planned comparisons indicated that African-descended persons scored significantly higher than European-descended <b>persons</b> <b>on</b> collectivism, familism, and romanticism; African-descended persons did not differ from European-descended <b>persons</b> <b>on</b> individualism or spiritualism; and African-descended persons did not differ from Asian-descended <b>persons</b> <b>on</b> any of the cultural values.

5|$|Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) and {{her mother}} visit her brother Bill and his {{pregnant}} wife Tara around Christmas time. Scully answers the phone, and the <b>person</b> <b>on</b> the other line, who sounds just like her dead sister Melissa, tells her that someone needs her help. Scully traces the call to a nearby home in San Diego {{where a group of}} cops are investigating the suicide of a woman, Roberta Sim. The lead detective, Kresge, tells Scully that it was impossible for Roberta to have dialed, as she died before the telephone call was made. That night after dinner Scully reveals to her mother that due to her abduction and cancer she is unable to bear children. Scully flashes back to when as a child, she hid her pet rabbit from her brother in a lunchbox, only for it to suffocate and die. Scully receives another telephone call from the same <b>person</b> <b>on</b> her cell phone, which was once again made from the Sim home. Roberta's husband, Marshall, is meeting with two dark-suited men inside his house and has no desire to listen to and help Scully figure out what is going on.|$|E
