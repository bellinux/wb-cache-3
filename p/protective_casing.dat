25|$|Human {{interaction}} with objects {{poses a threat}} of accidental contamination. Moisture and oils from human skin can cause staining of organic materials and corrosion of metals. This risk can be mitigated through implemented handling protocols such as washing hands and wearing protective gloves to minimize direct contact. Objects may also be enclosed in <b>protective</b> <b>casing</b> to further reduce direct handling when possible. Proper storage techniques, {{such as the use}} of neutral tissue or untreated cotton packed in polyethylene sheeting or acid-free corrugated cardboard, may be used to individually wrap pieces to prevent accidental contamination of objects between handling and display. Storage and display cases should be carefully evaluated for off-gassing risks, and following storage procedures such as those outlined above will all reduce the risk of contaminant damage to objects.|$|E
25|$|The TV Century 21 Dalek {{comic strip}} {{presents}} a different description of Skaro’s sentient life. One race, the Daleks, are depicted as short, blue-skinned, aggressive humanoids. They {{are engaged in}} a vicious war against the Thals who, although not shown in the strip, are described as tall, handsome, peaceful and living in constant fear of Dalek attack. The Daleks build a neutron bomb to finally bring the conflict to an end but a meteorite storm detonates the device prematurely, apparently destroying most of the life on Skaro. A mutated Dalek commandeers a prototype war machine, created shortly before the holocaust, to act as a mobile <b>protective</b> <b>casing.</b> It then convinces the last two humanoid Daleks, Yarvelling and Zolfian, to build more casings for the many other mutants which have survived. No further mention of the Thals is made in the strip, the implication being that they all perished in the nuclear conflagration.|$|E

Insects do not have lungs; oxygen and other gases, such as carbon dioxide, pass through their exoskeleton via tiny valves called spiracles. Insects also lack closed blood vessels; instead, they have a long, thin, perforated tube {{along the top of the}} body (called the [...] "dorsal aorta") that functions like a heart, and pumps haemolymph toward the head, thus driving the circulation of the internal fluids. The nervous system consists of a ventral nerve cord that runs the length of the body, with several ganglia and branches along the way reaching into the extremities of the appendages.|$|E

The games were later released in English for iOS devices on April 22, 2013, and became the first games in the series to be localized and released outside Japan. The titles of the English releases were respectively renamed as Harmonic Score, Rhythmic Record, and Melodic Disc, but the games retained the original titles for the Japanese iOS releases. Support for the iOS releases ended on March 15, 2016, and the downloadable content was also be made unavailable on that date.

50|$|The first {{total failure}} was {{the launch of}} a Nimbus weather {{satellite}} on May 5, 1968 when the Thor veered off course shortly {{after the start of}} the pitch and roll program and was destroyed by Range Safety. This mission was noteworthy because the satellite carried a pair of isotopic power generators known as SNAP (Systems For Nuclear Auxiliary Power). As the possibility of a launch failure had been considered during their design, the power generators were equipped with a very sturdy casing to prevent their radioactive contents from escaping into the environment. After the destruction of Nimbus-B's launch vehicle, Navy crews began an extensive search for the SNAP generators. On September 27, the Nimbus satellite was located in 300 feet of water near the Santa Barbara Islands with the SNAP units nearby. They were successfully fished out of the ocean two weeks later and their <b>protective</b> <b>casings</b> found to be intact. The fuel inside them was taken out and reused in a subsequent Nimbus launch.|$|R

DETAILED DESCRIPTION - INDEPENDENT CLAIMS are included for (1) a method {{for the production}} of (II) by coating metal powder (P) as above and then mixing the coated particles with a plastic (2) plastic composite material comprising a mixture of (I) and plastic (3) electronic components encapsulated with (II).

ADVANTAGE - Enables the production of electrically-insulating plastic composite material with a relatively high thermal conductivity, especially in the range 2 - 20 W/mK.

40|$|Natamycin is {{a natural}} {{antimicrobial}} food additive substance used to protect food against growth of fungi and yeast. Its use is reliable and safe for the human body. Natamycin kills fungi and yeast that could spoil the taste and smell of preserved meat products. Because {{of the lack of}} literature references on its detection in meat products, the aim {{of this study was to}} elaborate a method for determination of natamycin used to impregnate fermented dry salami casings. To detect the content of the effective substance, high-performance liquid chromatography with UV/Vis and mass spectrometry detection was employed; natamycin had been extracted from area-normalized surface layers of model salami <b>protective</b> <b>casings</b> to a mixture of methanol-water and detected with the above method. Moreover, the effective amount of natamycin in salami casings purchased from retail network was monitored, too. Practical Applications: As the practical application of the above elaborated detection method, the analyses of samples of fermented dry salami casings which were purchased from a retail network showed natamycin presence just in minimal or zero amounts. Extract from area surfaces of model and real samples no contained amounts of natamycin exceeding the limits specified by valid regulations. Thus, the analyses of natamycin in casings of commercially produced fermented dry salami showed its probable ability to degrade before the salami is purchased by the consumers. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc...|$|R

Because the drillers were using an insufficient length of <b>protective</b> <b>casing,</b> when the well hit a high-pressure zone in the field, it blew out, spewing enormous quantities of oil and gas into the water from the sea floor. While crews were able to cap the wellhead and relieve the pressure there, the adjacent geologic formations were not strong enough to contain the pressure, and lacking a steel <b>protective</b> <b>casing,</b> the reservoir fluid and gas ripped through the sedimentary sand layers directly on the ocean floor; the result was the 1969 Santa Barbara oil spill of 80,000 to 100,000 barrels, which eventually coated over 40 miles of southern California coastline with oil, an ecological disaster which killed upward of 10,000 birds and numerous sea mammals and other creatures.|$|E

50|$|Pinguicula longifolia, {{commonly}} known as the long-leaved butterwort, is a perennial carnivorous sub-alpine plant of the Central Pyrenees, found {{on both sides of the}} border. It catches its prey by using its modified leaves that lie on the ground and have “densely covered stalked glands that bear a droplet of sticky mucilage on its top.” The need to capture arthropods is driven by the lack of nutrients present in the soil. P. l. subsp. longifolia obtain their nutrition primarily from flying insects, mainly diptera, which replenished the carnivorous plant with nitrogen. P. l. subsp. longifolia grows in wet shady areas and on vertical or overhanging limestone walls. It has been found at altitudes between 700 - 1900 meters. In the spring, the winter buds open and the first carnivorous leaves present themselves. These leaves are then followed by the flowers in early summer. Throughout summer the leaves can grow up to 14 cm in length and have glands present on both sides of the leaves, which is highly characteristic of P. l. subsp. longifolia. More carnivorous leaves arise throughout summer, and when the conditions become unfavourable, around autumn, a <b>protective</b> winter <b>casing</b> composed of scale like leaves is produced, in the centre of the rosette, called the hibernacula, also known as the plant bud. The leaves halt production and the old leaves wither and decay; P. l. subsp. longifolia is now ready for the winter dormancy. There must be optimal growth during the summer for P. l. subsp. longifolia, otherwise they produce weakened hibernacula which rot very easily.|$|R
