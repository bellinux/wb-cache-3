For rapid prototyping on an optical table mirror mounts {{can be used}} to hold other elements besides mirrors, for example lenses often need to be aligned for minimal coma. Sometimes prisms only need two axes alignment and can be mounted on a mirror mount rather than a three-axis <b>prism</b> <b>table.</b>|$|E
40|$|In {{steel fiber}} {{reinforced}} concrete (SFRC), the fibers are {{generally considered to}} be oriented isotropically. However, it is known that the procedures used in the specimen fabrication during quality control and material characterization may influence the distribution of the fibers significantly. This has an important effect on the properties determined from the specimens, which has to be considered when the results are used to analyze the behavior of other elements. In the present work, the orientation and segregation of fibers in cylindrical specimens and prisms, which are normally used in the mechanical characterization of SFRC, are evaluated. The type of compaction (i. e., table vibration, hand tamping and internal vibration) is seen to have a considerable influence on the distribution of the fibers. In the <b>prisms,</b> <b>table</b> vibration increases the tendency for the fibers to be oriented horizontally. In the cylindrical specimens, hand tamping appears to cause the least non-uniformity of the fiber distribution. The study was conducted on conventional concretes with 40 kg/m 3 of fibers...|$|R
50|$|It {{frequently}} {{occurs as}} well-formed crystals, which are orthorhombic and occasionally show indications of hemimorphism: {{they have the}} form of six-sided <b>prisms</b> or flat <b>tables</b> terminated by large basal planes and often modified at the edges by numerous pyramid-planes. Twinning on the prism-planes is of frequent occurrence, giving rise to pseudo-hexagonal groups like those of aragonite. The colour is iron-black, and the lustre metallic and brilliant; on exposure to light, however, the crystals soon become dull. Stephanite is an important ore of silver in some mining camps.|$|R
40|$|CHRiSM is a {{probabilistic}} {{logic programming}} language which combines CHR, {{a high level}} programming language that uses multi-headed rewrite rules, and PRISM, a Prolog extension that allows for probabilistic predicates and learning. Tabling is often important for efficient computation in probabilistic contexts, because it can avoid frequent re-computation of probabilistic distributions. <b>PRISM</b> contains a <b>tabling</b> system {{which was designed to}} work with Prolog, but it is unclear how to make it work correctly and efficiently with the constraint store of CHR. As a result, tabling has not been used in CHRiSM. In this paper, we propose a method to make CHRiSM programs more accommodating to the <b>tabling</b> system of <b>PRISM,</b> by performing an analysis of which CHRiSM constraints can affect the outcome of a given goal and determining when it is safe to use tabled results of subgoals. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The cores and reflectors in modem High Temperature Gas Cooled Reactors (HTRs) are {{constructed}} from graphite components. There {{are two main}} designs; the Pebble Bed design and the <b>Prism</b> design, see <b>Table</b> 1. In both of these designs the graphite not only acts as a moderator, but is also a major structural component that may provide channels for the fuel and coolant gas, channels for control and safety shut off devices and provide thermal and neutron shielding. In addition, graphite components may act as a heat sink or conduction path during reactor trips and transients. During reactor operation, many of the graphite component physical properties are significantly changed by irradiation. These changes lead to the generation of significant internal shrinkage stresses and thermal shut down stresses {{that could lead to}} component failure. In addition, if the graphite is irradiated to a very high irradiation dose, irradiation swelling can lead to a rapid reduction in modulus and strength, making the component friable. The irradiation behaviour of graphite is strongly dependent on its virgin microstructure, which is determined by the manufacturing route. Nevertheless, there are available, irradiation data on many obsolete graphites of known microstructures. There is also a well-developed physical understandin...|$|R
40|$|This Final Report {{summarizes}} {{work performed}} under DOE STTR Phase II Grant No. DE-FG 02 - 05 ER 86258 during the project period from August 2006 to August 2009. The project, “Development of Spectral and Atomic Models for Diagnosing Energetic Particle Characteristics in Fast Ignition Experiments,” {{was led by}} Prism Computational Sciences (Madison, WI), and involved collaboration with subcontractors University of Nevada-Reno and Voss Scientific (Albuquerque, NM). In this project, we have:  Developed and implemented a multi-dimensional, multi-frequency radiation transport model in the LSP hybrid fluid-PIC (particle-in-cell) code [1, 2].  Updated the LSP code to {{support the use of}} accurate equation-of-state (EOS) <b>tables</b> generated by <b>Prism’s</b> PROPACEOS [3] code to compute more accurate temperatures in high energy density physics (HEDP) plasmas.  Updated LSP to support the use of <b>Prism’s</b> multi-frequency opacity <b>tables.</b>  Generated equation of state and opacity data for LSP simulations for several materials being used in plasma jet experimental studies.  Developed and implemented parallel processing techniques for the radiation physics algorithms in LSP.  Benchmarked the new radiation transport and radiation physics algorithms in LSP and compared simulation results with analytic solutions and results from numerical radiation-hydrodynamics calculations.  Performed simulations using Prism radiation physics codes to address issues related to radiative cooling and ionization dynamics in plasma jet experiments.  Performed simulations to study the effects of radiation transport and radiation losses due to electrode contaminants in plasma jet experiments.  Updated the LSP code to generate output using NetCDF to provide a better, more flexible interface to SPECT 3 D [4] in order to post-process LSP output.  Updated the SPECT 3 D code to better support the post-processing of large-scale 2 -D and 3 -D datasets generated by simulation codes such as LSP.  Updated atomic physics modeling to provide for more comprehensive and accurate atomic databases that feed into the radiation physics modeling (spectral simulations and opacity tables).  Developed polarization spectroscopy modeling techniques suitable for diagnosing energetic particle characteristics in HEDP experiments. A description of these items is provided in this report. The above efforts lay the groundwork for utilizing the LSP and SPECT 3 D codes in providing simulation support for DOE-sponsored HEDP experiments, such as plasma jet and fast ignition physics experiments. We believe that taken together, the LSP and SPECT 3 D codes have unique capabilities for advancing our understanding of the physics of these HEDP plasmas. Based on conversations early in this project with our DOE program manager, Dr. Francis Thio, our efforts emphasized developing radiation physics and atomic modeling capabilities that can be utilized in the LSP PIC code, and performing radiation physics studies for plasma jets. A relatively minor component focused on the development of methods to diagnose energetic particle characteristics in short-pulse laser experiments related to fast ignition physics. The period of performance for the grant was extended by one year to August 2009 with a one-year no-cost extension, at the request of subcontractor University of Nevada-Reno...|$|R
