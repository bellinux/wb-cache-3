Experiments by the Dutch in the 19th century proved the inefficacy of linseed oil, metallic paint, powdered glass, carbonization (i.e., burning the outer layers of the wood), and any of the usual biocides such as chromated copper arsenate. They also attempted covering wooden pylons with precisely arranged iron nails, but this too had no lasting effect. In 1878 {{it was discovered that}} creosote was an effective deterrent, though to work best it had to be applied to soft, resinous woods like pine; in order to work on harder woods such as oak, special care had to be taken to ensure the wood was completely permeated by the creosote.

5000|$|Rollfilm or {{roll film}} is {{any type of}} spool-wound <b>photographic</b> film <b>protected</b> from white light {{exposure}} by a paper backing, as opposed to film which is protected from exposure and wound forward in a cartridge. The term originated in contrast to sheet film. Confusingly, roll film was originally {{often referred to as}} [...] "cartridge" [...] film because of its resemblance to a shotgun cartridge. The opaque backing paper allows roll film to be loaded in daylight. It is typically printed with frame number markings which can be viewed through a small red window {{at the rear of the}} camera. A spool of roll film is usually loaded on one side of the camera and pulled across to an identical take up spool on the other side of the shutter as exposures are made. When the roll is fully exposed, the take up spool is removed for processing and the empty spool on which the film was originally wound is moved to the other side, becoming the take up spool for the next roll of film.|$|R

25|$|Since the UCC {{prescribed}} {{a minimum}} copyright term of 25 years, chapter IV of the Fundamentals was changed accordingly.

In the Georgian SSR, these kinds of works were copyrighted for 20 years since their publication or creation, in the Moldavian and Uzbek SSR, for 15 years, and in Azerbaijan for ten years. In Kazakhstan, <b>photographic</b> works were <b>protected</b> for ten years and collections of photos for 15 years. These reduced terms took advantage of a provision in the UCC that set a minimum term of ten years since publication for these kinds of works. The law of the Russian SSR did not contain any such reduced copyright terms for these kinds of works. The new, longer copyright term only applied to works that were still copyrighted in the USSR in 1973.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} elegant indirectness that certain e-gasuri {{patterns}} exhibit while using traditional symbols to express familiar Japanese sayings and concepts. E-gasuri is the Japanese word for fabrics patterned with pictures created with the ikat resist dying technique. Kasuri essentially means ikat. Kasuri becomes gasuri {{in the compound}} word e-gasuri. E means picture. The ikat technique of dying threads before they are woven produces images with blurred outlines. This blurred appearance is a treasured aspect of the e-gasuri aesthetic. E-gasuri is usually (but not exclusively) associated today with indigo resist dyed blue and white cotton and bast fabrics. The following three paragraphs describe the techniques that were most often used to create {{the majority of the}} Japanese picture ikat textiles that survive today. By the early 19 th century Japanese weavers were creating e-gasuri using yet unwoven warp threads, weft threads or both which were tightly wrapped by hand at predetermined intervals with a material that <b>protected</b> the <b>wrapped</b> areas of thread from absorbing dye when submerged in dye vats, usually filled with indigo. When woven with painstaking care the precisely calculated predetermined white resist segments produced pictures in the finished cloth. By the 1830 ’s e-gasuri warp or weft threads were being patterned, again before being woven, with pairs of wooden boards carved with mirror images of a design that created a resist when clamped together over the threads. The clamped blocks could be submerged in dye vats. Often, holes were drilled into the blocks to allow dye into selected areas. Sometimes dyes were poured directly into the holes. Wax could also be poured into the holes to create a resist for subsequent dye baths. These textiles are called itajime-gasuri but they often include hand tied resist design elements as well...|$|R
40|$|On 30 January 1972, British {{soldiers}} {{shot dead}} 13 unarmed civilians (another dying of wounds weeks later) during a Civil Rights Association march in Derry. 17 -years old Jackie Duddy {{was the first}} fatality, {{shot in the back}} while fleeing. Father Edward Daly was running beside him, and used his handkerchief as a ‘truce flag’ to allow removal of the corpse as shooting continued. In that place, in “unjustified and unjustifiable” circumstances [David Cameron, 2010], a humble hankie became an historical, locational, cultural and political artefact, preserved in the iconic, much reproduced, <b>photographic</b> image, and <b>protected</b> in Duddy’s family home and subsequently in the Free Derry Museum’s archives of Bloody Sunday. That artefact embodies both personal tragedy and political transformation in the social imagination of Northern Ireland, a flag of humanity providing an alternative to those traditional flags marking sectarian affiliation or heraldic triumphalism. When we accept that Ireland herself is a stained and bloodied cloth, marked irreversibly by history, conflict, denial and abuse, stained by repression and denial of all her people’s rights and needs, bloodied by the haemorrhage of her people, then – with empathy, humility and heart – we just might make peace with our past...|$|R
40|$|Gee Vaucher’s {{work with}} [British anarcho-punk band] Crass showed her both {{exploiting}} and extending {{the possibilities of}} record cover art, for political and creative purposes. She worked {{at the tail end}} of the high popularity of record cover art, an interdisciplinary art form that burgeoned in the 1960 s and 1970 s, <b>wrapping,</b> <b>protecting,</b> packaging and enhancing the new music, and which began to diminish in size and importance with the onset of digital music consumption from the 1980 s on (CDs then downloads). Steve Jones and Martin Sorger note that ‘[v]isually, the 12 -inch square of the album cover has proven a fertile forum for the development of a rich sense of cultural, artistic, and social history’, and argue that the record cover ‘is the historical cornerstone of pre-recorded music packaging’. In the 1960 s and 1970 s, record companies and artists produced increasingly ‘elaborate packages. Album covers incorporated die-cuts, embossing, multiple gate-folds, books, posters, and assorted gimmicky constructions and novelties. One variety included covers shaped after the paraphernalia of rock: speakers, amps, concert tickets, record players, and so on’. Vaucher and Crass, during the band’s active existence from 1977 to 1984, extended the boundaries of record cover art in both 7 ” and 12 ” forms. Vaucher’s art was a sustained challenge to the idea that the record cover was a subsidiary artefact to the music of the record itself...|$|R
40|$|DNA {{replication}} is {{a complex}} process that involves an organism’s ability to faithfully replicate and maintain its genomic code. One of {{the initial stages of}} DNA replication is the separation of double-stranded DNA into complementary single-stranded DNA. This action is performed minimally by the replicative DNA helicase. DNA helicases are present in all three domains of life and are essential for cellular survival. Mutations to helicases can lead to a predisposition for susceptibility to cancers and other diseases. The actual mechanism for DNA unwinding and processing at the replication fork, however is unknown. We chose a model archaeal system (Sulfolobus solfataricus - Sso) that is homologous to eukaryotes, but is simplified in its DNA replication machinery. The DNA replicative helicase in Sso is the homohexameric minichromosome maintenance protein (MCM) which is homologous to the eukaryotic heterohexamer Mcm 2 - 7. I have discovered the novel mechanism for unwinding in Sso which we named the steric exclusion and wrapping model (SEW). The SEW model involves MCM encircling the DNA leading strand and sterically excluding the lagging strand which then physically wraps around the exterior of the helicase. We hypothesize this <b>wrapping</b> <b>protects</b> the single-stranded DNA from degradation to allow for elongation on the lagging strand. The binding path on the exterior of the helicase was further characterized through the mutation of two basic residues that we determined electrostatically interact with the single-stranded DNA. Additionally, I have characterized a conserved single point mutation that disrupts hexamerization, implying additional functional significance for the motif in which it is located. Finally, I characterized interactions within the archaeal primosome including the atypical physical interaction between eukaryotic-like helicase MCM and bacterial-like primase DnaG and the functional relationship between MCM and single-stranded binding protein. My thesis provide a significant contribution to the overall understanding of the mechanism and function of proteins in the archaeal primosome, which will be applicable to more complex eukaryotic systems...|$|R
40|$|Wind {{becomes an}} {{increasingly}} important factor when designing large and tall structures. The construction of a building does not only has to carry its own weight and the live load, but also the horizontal wind forces acting on its facade. Wind is not a static load; it changes in force and duration over time. The construction of a building needs to be dimensioned to withstand the peak values of the wind load {{in a particular area}} {{despite the fact that they}} might only occur a few times in the building life cycle otherwise, the building would succumb to those extreme wind forces. As a result the building is heavily over-dimensioned for most of its lifetime. If those peak values of the wind-load were to be avoided, the building could cope with a weaker construction, potentially saving weight and construction costs. The idea is to use an aircushion in front of the buildings facade with the intension that its flexible and dynamical behaviour would smoothen out the extreme wind load values, in the same way transported goods are <b>protected</b> by bubble <b>wrap</b> from reckless handling. This is a dynamical system where the aircushion would basically function as a spring and could be represented by one. So the question becomes, can the addition of an aircushion in front of a facade reduce the forces on the supports? And this translates to the following problem statement: Does the flexible and dynamical behaviour of an aircushion facade element reduce the wind load on the underlying structure? From there a parameter study is done to see how the different properties of the aircushion can influence its response to a specific wind load, and what the optimal conditions are of the aircushion for the maximum reduction of reaction forces on the supports. In this thesis only one wind spectrum is used. The shape of the aircushion is a closed strip with air trapped inside, which can be simplified into a twodimensional model. The aircushion membrane is discretized into mass particles connected to each other through springs and dampers. The springs simulate the stretch of the membrane, the dampers simulate the energy loss due to friction and the mass particles simulate the weight of the membrane itself. This is done in stages, where each model is more complex than the previous one. The equations of motion that describe the behaviour of the models are found by setting up the Lagrange 2 ̆ 6 apos;s equation of motion. Due to the complexity of these equations, programmes were written in Matlab that could produce and solve these Lagrane 2 ̆ 6 apos;s equations numerically. Matlab could also provide the necessary output that showed the aircushions behaviour to the wind load. For the parameter study five parameters of the aircushion were varied one at the time, they were the length of the membrane in its deflated state; the Young 2 ̆ 6 apos;s modulus of the membrane material; the internal inflation pressure; the weight of the aircushion and the total height of the aircushion itself. The parameter study showed that none of the parameter values caused a reduction in reaction forces, the best what they could do is approach the reaction forces of the static solution. This was achieved by increasing the overall stiffness of the aircushion reducing its dynamical behaviour; this would indicate that the dynamical behaviour would only increase the domain of the reaction forces instead of smoothing out the peak values. When dynamic behaviour was possible, the reaction forces would oscillate around the average gradient, which would be the same as the static solution. This meant that the reaction forces would only be smaller than the static solution for small periods of time. Using the optimal conditions from the parameter study resulted in a very stiff aircushion that showed little dynamical behaviour resulting in a response similar to that of a static system when no aircushion is placed in front of the facade structure. One of the reasons why the reaction forces did not lower overall was because the aircushion used in this thesis is a closed system where the air cannot escape; there was no real dissipation of energy than only the energy loss due to friction.
