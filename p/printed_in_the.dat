5|$|By 1922, the eight-hour day {{had become}} common in American industry. One {{exception}} was in steel mills, where workers labored through a twelve-hour workday, {{seven days a}} week. Hoover considered this practice barbaric, and got Harding to convene a conference of steel manufacturers {{with a view to}} ending it. The conference established a committee under the leadership of U. S. Steel chairman Elbert Gary, which in early 1923 recommended against ending the practice. Harding sent a letter to Gary deploring the result, which was <b>printed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> press, and public outcry caused the manufacturers to reverse themselves and standardize the eight-hour day.|$|E

40|$|This note {{argues that}} the Copyright Act should be changed to permit {{compensated}} importation where the underlying work is out of <b>print</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States. Part I discusses the relevant sections of the Copyright Act and their interpretation by the courts. Part II demonstrates that compensated importation should be allowed when a work is out of <b>print</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States. Part III proposes a solution into eh form of a compulsory license for out-of-print imports where the work {{has been out of}} <b>print</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States for a certain length of time. This note concludes that the interests of the creators and of the public would be better served by allowing importation of works that are out of <b>print</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United states...|$|R

5|$|By the 1970s, {{the idea}} that the game had been created solely by Charles Darrow had become popular folklore; it was <b>printed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> game's {{instructions}} for many years, in a 1974 book devoted to Monopoly, and was cited in a general book about toys even as recently as 2007. Even a guide to family games published for Reader's Digest in 2003 only gave credit to Darrow and Elizabeth Magie, erroneously stating that Magie's original game was created in the 19th century, and not acknowledging any of the game's development between Magie's creation of the game, and the eventual publication by Parker Brothers.|$|E

5|$|Miguel de Benavides {{was born}} in 1550 in the Castilian town of Carrión de los Condes, {{province}} of Palencia, Spain, {{in the heart of}} the austere, grain-producing Tierra de Campos. Benavides was steeped in the theological principles of Francisco de Vitoria and Bartolomé de las Casas, who exchanged the prestigious professorial chair for remote and difficult new missions of the Philippines. He was chosen to govern the newly created Diocese of Nueva Segovia (now Vigan) as its First Bishop (1595–1601). He wrote the Doctrina Christiana in Chinese, the first book <b>printed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Philippines.|$|E
5|$|Morrowind also {{contained}} a fair bit of voiced dialogue; an aspect somewhat better {{received by the}} gaming press. Of note is Lynda Carter, television's Wonder Woman, promoted by Bethesda {{for her role in}} voicing the female Nords in the game. Morrowinds race-specific voice acting received praise from some reviewers, though was met with disdain from others, who disliked the discord between a culturally inflected voice spoken in an alien dialect and the grammatically flawless dialogue <b>printed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dialogue boxes. The Special Edition Soundtrack was released over DirectSong as a digital release.|$|E

5|$|On 11 February, one {{day after}} the {{conclusion}} of the match and three days after the riot, Harris wrote a letter to one of his friends about the disturbance. It was clear that he intended the letter to be <b>printed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> press, and it appeared in full in The Daily Telegraph on 1 April, among other London newspapers, reigniting the furore. Wisden Cricketers' Almanack considered the incident of such significance that it reprinted the whole correspondence.
