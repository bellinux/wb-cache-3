5|$|Edward Grant, a {{historian}} of science, has <b>provided</b> <b>evidence</b> that medieval scholastic philosophers generally considered the celestial spheres to be solid {{in the sense}} of three-dimensional or continuous, but most did not consider them solid {{in the sense of}} hard.

5|$|The site at Palmyra <b>provided</b> <b>evidence</b> for a Neolithic {{settlement}} near Efqa, {{with stone}} tools dated to 7500BC. Archaeological sounding in the tell beneath the Temple of Bel uncovered a mud-brick structure built around 2500 BC, followed by structures built during the Middle Bronze Age and Iron Age.|$|E

5|$|Archaeological {{excavations}} {{of several}} sites in Tamil Nadu and Kerala have yielded remnants from the Sangam era, such as {{different kinds of}} pottery, pottery with inscriptions, imported ceramic ware, industrial objects, brick structures and spinning whorls. Techniques such as stratigraphy and paleography have helped establish the date of these items to the Sangam era. The excavated artifacts have <b>provided</b> <b>evidence</b> for existence of different economic activities mentioned in Sangam literature such as agriculture, weaving, smithy, gem cutting, building construction, pearl fishing and painting.|$|E
5|$|By 2002, Blue's Clues had {{received}} several awards {{for excellence in}} children's programming, educational software, and licensing, and had been nominated for nine Emmy Awards. It has been syndicated in 120 countries and translated into 15 languages. Regional versions of the show featuring local hosts have been produced in other countries. It {{was one of the}} first preschool shows to incorporate American Sign Language into its content.

5|$|Historically in Lancashire, Crompton (as it was {{originally}} known) and its surroundings have <b>provided</b> <b>evidence</b> of ancient British and Anglian activity in the area. During the Middle Ages, Crompton formed a small township of scattered woods, farmsteads, moorland, and swamp with a small and close community of families. The local lordship was weak or absent, and so Crompton failed to emerge as a manor with its own lord and court. Farming was the main industry of this broadly independent and self-supporting rural area, with locals supplementing their incomes by hand-loom woollen weaving in the domestic system.|$|E
5|$|Historically in Lancashire, Tyldesley and its {{surroundings}} have <b>provided</b> <b>evidence</b> for {{the remains of}} a Roman road passing through the township on its ancient course between Coccium (Wigan) and Mamucium (Manchester). Following the Anglo-Saxon invasion of Britain, Tyldesley was part of the manor of Warrington, until the Norman conquest of England, when the settlement constituted a township called Tyldesley-with-Shakerley in the ancient parish of Leigh.|$|E
5|$|Historically part of Lancashire, Worsley has <b>provided</b> <b>evidence</b> of Roman and Anglo-Saxon activity, {{including}} two Roman roads. The completion in 1761 of the Bridgewater Canal allowed Worsley to expand {{from a small}} village of cottage industries to an important town based upon cotton manufacture, iron-working, brick-making and extensive coal mining. Later expansion came after the First and Second World Wars, when large urban estates {{were built in the}} region.|$|E

5|$|In 1952, {{astronomer}} Paul W. Merrill in California {{detected the}} spectral signature of technetium (specifically wavelengths of 403.1nm, 423.8nm, 426.2nm, and 429.7nm) in light from S-type red giants. The stars were {{near the end}} of their lives, yet were rich in this short-lived element, indicating that it was being produced in the stars by nuclear reactions. This evidence bolstered the hypothesis that heavier elements are the product of nucleosynthesis in stars. More recently, such observations <b>provided</b> <b>evidence</b> that elements are formed by neutron capture in the s-process.|$|E
5|$|Ofotbanen {{lost their}} license from the Norwegian Railway Inspectorate on 7October 2008. This was because Ofotbanen had not {{documented}} necessary accounts for 2007, nor <b>provided</b> <b>evidence</b> of necessary liquidity. On 24October, {{the company was}} declared bankrupt. Rail Management subsequently established the new company Ofotbanen Drift, and stated {{that the cause of}} the bankruptcy was that Autolink had not let them make a private placement of NOK10 million.|$|E
5|$|Pottery shards {{found at}} the {{important}} site of Jarlshof also indicate that there was Neolithic activity there although the main settlement dates from the Bronze Age. This includes a smithy, a cluster of wheelhouses and a later broch. The site has <b>provided</b> <b>evidence</b> of habitation during various phases right up until Viking times. Heel-shaped cairns, are a style of chambered cairn unique to Shetland, with a particularly large example on Vementry.|$|E

40|$|Samples {{taken from}} middens at the Neolithic site of Catalhoyuk in Turkey have been {{analysed}} using IR spectroscopy {{backed up by}} powder XRD and SEM-EDX. Microcomponents studied include fossil hack-berries (<b>providing</b> <b>evidence</b> of ancient diet and seasonality), mineral nodules (<b>providing</b> <b>evidence</b> of post-depositional change) and phytoliths (mineralised plant cells, <b>providing</b> <b>evidence</b> of usage of plant species). Finely laminated ashy deposits have also been investigated allowing chemical and mineralogical variations to be explored. It is found that many layers which appear visually to be quite distinctive have, in fact, very similar mineralogy. (C) 2009 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

5|$|The quark {{model was}} {{independently}} proposed by physicists Murray Gell-Mann and George Zweig in 1964. Quarks were introduced {{as parts of}} an ordering scheme for hadrons, and there was little evidence for their physical existence until deep inelastic scattering experiments at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center in 1968. Accelerator experiments have <b>provided</b> <b>evidence</b> for all six flavors. The top quark {{was the last to}} be discovered at Fermilab in 1995.|$|E
5|$|Through {{observation}} of the light curves of many Type Ia supernovae, {{it was discovered that}} they appear to have a common peak luminosity. By measuring the luminosity of these events, the distance to their host galaxy can be estimated with good accuracy. Thus this category of supernovae has become highly useful as a standard candle for measuring cosmic distances. In 1998, the High-Z Supernova Search and the Supernova Cosmology Project discovered that the most distant Type Ia supernovae appeared dimmer than expected. This has <b>provided</b> <b>evidence</b> that {{the expansion of the universe}} may be accelerating.|$|E
5|$|Cassini {{photographs}} {{have led}} to other significant discoveries. They have revealed a previously undiscovered planetary ring, outside the brighter main rings of Saturn and inside the G and Erings. The source of this ring is hypothesized to be the crashing of a meteoroid off Janus and Epimetheus. In July 2006, Cassini images <b>provided</b> <b>evidence</b> of hydrocarbon lakes near Titan's north pole, the presence of which were confirmed in January 2007. In March 2007, additional images near Titan's north pole revealed hydrocarbon seas, the largest of which is almost {{the size of the}} Caspian Sea. In October 2006, the probe detected an 8,000km diameter cyclone-like storm with an eyewall at Saturn's south pole.|$|E
