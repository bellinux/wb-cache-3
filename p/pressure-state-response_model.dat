One subset of environmental indicators is the collection of ecological indicators which can include physical, biological and chemical measures such as atmospheric temperature, the concentration of ozone in the stratosphere {{or the number of}} breeding bird pairs in an area. These are also referred to as “state” indicators as their focus is {{on the state of the}} environment or conditions in the environment. A second subset is the collection of indicators that measure human activities or anthropogenic pressures, such as greenhouse gas emissions. These are also referred to as “pressure” indicators. Finally, there are indicators, such as the number of people serviced by sewage treatment, which track societal responses to environmental issues.|$|E

In this study, an ecological risk index system was developed corresponding to the factors of urban ecosystem risk including in <b>Pressure-State-Response</b> <b>model</b> (PSR). Thus, an emergy-based ecological risk evaluation model (EERM) was proposed to evaluate and simulate the risk levels for urban expansion, which offers an integrated evaluation tool in view of urban ecosystem pressure, state and response. Emergy analysis methods are explained, illustrated and used to diagram the urban ecosystem, to evaluate environmental and economic inputs and harvested yield, and to assess the sustainability of the Tianjin during 1995 to 2009. The results have shown that, from 1995 to 2009, the pressure rating of the urban ecology risk in this area had been rising continually.

40|$|Ten {{case studies}} from seven major {{pastoral}} regions across six continents were studied {{in this paper}} by conceptualizing three factors (agro-ecosystem resilience, livelihood options, and institution capacity) as the axes of a three-dimensional vulnerability framework. This analysis highlights the vulnerability of agriculture-based livelihood systems to global changes and helps identify what institutions {{have the potential to}} mobilize effective relief in different pastoral regions. In terms of results, this vulnerability assessment shows that the vulnerability of pastoralism was very different in all the cases across the globe. As such, a further analysis, based on the <b>pressure-state-response</b> (PSR) <b>model</b> was undertaken to enhance our understanding of the ways that global changes put pressures on pastoral livelihoods worldwide. From this we conclude that climate change and climate variability are driving fragile pastoral ecosystems into more vulnerable conditions. Socioeconomic factors, such as changes in land tenure, agriculture, sedentarization, and institutions are fracturing large-scale pastoral ecosystems into spatially isolated systems. The implications of this analysis are that professionals, practitioners, and policy makers should jointly develop a coupled human and natural systems approach that focuses on enhancing the resilience of pastoral communities and their practices. This requires institutional developments to support asset building and good governance to enhance adaptive capability. In addition, pastoralists' adaptation strategies to global change need to be supported by public awareness and improved by institutional decisions at different scales and dimensions...|$|R
