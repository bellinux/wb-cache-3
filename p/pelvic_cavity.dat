5|$|If {{the fetal}} remains {{are found in}} a fetal {{position}} and are wholly within the <b>pelvic</b> <b>cavity</b> of the adult, the fetus died and was interred prior to delivery. The pregnant woman may therefore have died due to labor complications.|$|E
5|$|The {{anatomical}} {{structure of the}} internal organs and tissues of the female reproductive tract provides a pathway for pathogens to ascend from the vagina to the <b>pelvic</b> <b>cavity</b> thorough the infundibulum.

5|$|If the {{majority}} of the fetal remains are in the <b>pelvic</b> <b>cavity</b> of the adult, yet the legs are extended and/or the cranium lies among the ribs, then the infant may have been delivered and then placed on top of the mother's torso prior to burial. As both bodies skeletonized, the infant's bones would have settled among the mother's ribs and vertebrae.|$|E

50|$|Between {{the inner}} {{surface of the}} general layer of the fascia which lines the {{interior}} of the abdominal and <b>pelvic</b> <b>cavities,</b> and the peritoneum, there is a considerable amount of connective tissue, termed the extraperitoneal fat or subperitoneal connective tissue.|$|R
5|$|In 1975, it was {{reported}} that during the excavation of a medieval cemetery in Kings Worthy, England, fetal remains appeared to lie within the birth canal of the skeleton of a young woman, with the fetal cranium external to the pelvic outlet and between the two femora (thigh bones) and the fetal leg bones clearly within the <b>pelvic</b> <b>cavity.</b> Other cases of coffin birth at archaeological sites have been described, such as in 1978 at a Neolithic site in Germany, at a medieval site in Denmark in 1982, and in 2009 at an Early Christian period site at Fingal, Ireland. A coffin birth was also described in a 2011 episode of the BBC show History Cold Case, featuring the Roman era remains of a woman and three neonates discovered near Baldock, Hertfordshire. Another was identified in 2006 in a 14th-century Black Death cemetery in Genoa, Italy.|$|E
25|$|Recovery time {{following}} {{laparoscopic surgery}} is shorter and less painful than following traditional abdominal surgery. Instead {{of opening the}} <b>pelvic</b> <b>cavity</b> with a wide incision (laparotomy), a laparoscope (a thin, lighted tube) and surgical instruments are inserted into the <b>pelvic</b> <b>cavity</b> via small incisions. Rectopexy and anterior resection have been performed laparoscopically with good results.|$|E
25|$|The pelvic {{region of}} the trunk {{includes}} the bony pelvis, the <b>pelvic</b> <b>cavity</b> (the space enclosed by the bony pelvis), the pelvic floor, below the <b>pelvic</b> <b>cavity,</b> and the perineum, below the pelvic floor. The pelvic skeleton is formed {{in the area of}} the back, by the sacrum and the coccyx and anteriorly and to the left and right sides, by a pair of hip bones.|$|E
50|$|Laparoscopic surgery {{includes}} operations {{within the}} abdominal or <b>pelvic</b> <b>cavities,</b> whereas keyhole surgery {{performed on the}} thoracic or chest cavity is called thoracoscopic surgery. Specific surgical instruments used in a laparoscopic surgery include: forceps, scissors, probes, dissectors, hooks, retractors and more. Laparoscopic and thoracoscopic surgery belong to the broader field of endoscopy.|$|R
40|$|Mesenteric cyst {{is a rare}} {{abdominal}} disease, with {{a higher}} incidence among women and 1 : 250. 000 incidence among hospitalized adults and 1 : 200. 000 among hospitalized children. Thereby, we report {{a case of a}} 10 years old child, male, presenting a large mesenteric cyst, which occupied almost all the abdominal and <b>pelvic</b> <b>cavities</b> and treated by resection during laparotomy...|$|R
50|$|An {{example of}} this would be a patient {{breathing}} nitrous oxide in an operating room (surrounded by air). Cuffs on the endotracheal tubes must be monitored as nitrous oxide will diffuse into the air filled space causing the volume to increase. In laparoscopic surgery, nitrous oxide is avoided since the gas will diffuse into the abdominal or <b>pelvic</b> <b>cavities</b> causing an increase in internal pressure. In the case of a tympanoplasty, the skin flap will not lay down as the nitrous oxide will be diffusing into the middle ear.|$|R
25|$|The <b>pelvic</b> <b>cavity</b> {{is a body}} cavity that is {{bounded by}} {{the bones of the}} pelvis and which {{primarily}} contains reproductive organs and the rectum.|$|E
25|$|The {{squatting}} position gives {{a greater}} {{increase of pressure}} in the <b>pelvic</b> <b>cavity</b> with minimal muscular effort. The birth canal will open 20 to 30% more in a squat {{than in any other}} position. It is recommended for the second stage of childbirth.|$|E
25|$|Clear-cell adenocarcinomas are histopathologically {{similar to}} other clear cell carcinomas, with clear cells and hobnail cells. They {{represent}} approximately 5–10% of epithelial ovarian cancers and are associated with endometriosis in the <b>pelvic</b> <b>cavity.</b> They are typically early-stage and therefore curable by surgery, but advanced clear-cell adenocarcinomas (approximately 20%) have a poor prognosis and are often resistant to platinum chemotherapy.|$|E
5000|$|Trocars {{are also}} used {{near the end of}} the {{embalming}} process to provide drainage of bodily fluids and organs after the vascular replacement of blood with embalming chemicals. Rather than a round tube being inserted, the three sided knife of the classic trocar would split the outer skin into three [...] "wings" [...] which was then easily sutured closed in a less obtrusive way. It is attached to a suction hose (which usually is attached to a running water source and drain known as a hydroaspirator). The process of removing gas, fluids, and semi-solids from the body cavities and hollow organs using the trocar is known as aspiration. The instrument is inserted into the body two inches to the left and two inches up from the navel. After the thoracic, abdominal, and <b>pelvic</b> <b>cavities</b> have been aspirated, the embalmer injects cavity fluid into the thoracic, abdominal and <b>pelvic</b> <b>cavities</b> using a smaller trocar attached via a hose which is connected to a bottle of high index cavity fluid. The bottle is held upside down in the air so as to let gravity take the cavity fluid through the trocar and into the cavities. The embalmer moves the trocar in the same manner that he or she used when aspirating the cavities in order to fully and evenly distribute the chemical.|$|R
30|$|If the IUDs {{were going}} through the uterine serosa, or entirely outside the uterus, invading the organs in the <b>pelvic</b> {{abdominal}} <b>cavity</b> would {{make it difficult to}} remove devices. This invokes an increased risk for severe complications.|$|R
40|$|A desmoplastic {{small round}} cell tumor is a {{malignant}} tumor of the abdominal and <b>pelvic</b> <b>cavities.</b> This tumor involves serosal surfaces {{such as the}} peritoneum, pleura, and scrotum. In this case report a 28 -year old male presented with a desmoplastic small round cell tumor located in the abdomen along with urological symptoms. When the diagnosis was completed, the patient’s tumor had metastasized to the liver and retroperitoneal lymph nodes. This case not only has exemplified that this tumor is rare and fatal but its prompt diagnosis is critical. However it is most likely that the diagnosis of this tumor is found when it has metastasized and this is unfortunately very late...|$|R
25|$|In the newborn, the {{symphysis}} pubis is 9–10mm in width, with thick cartilaginous end-plates. By mid-adolescence the adult size is achieved. During adulthood the end-plates decrease in width to a thinner layer. Degeneration of the {{symphysis pubis}} accompanies aging and postpartum. Women {{have a greater}} thickness of this pubic disc which allows more mobility of the pelvic bones, hence providing a greater diameter of <b>pelvic</b> <b>cavity</b> during childbirth.|$|E
25|$|The two hip bones {{connect the}} spine {{with the lower}} limbs. They are {{attached}} to the sacrum posteriorly, connected to each other anteriorly, and joined with the two femurs at the hip joints. The gap enclosed by the bony pelvis, called the <b>pelvic</b> <b>cavity,</b> is the section of the body underneath the abdomen and mainly consists of the reproductive organs (sex organs) and the rectum, while the pelvic floor {{at the base of the}} cavity assists in supporting the organs of the abdomen.|$|E
25|$|Surgical {{approaches}} in rectal prolapse {{can be either}} perineal or abdominal. A perineal approach (or trans-perineal) refers to surgical access to the rectum and sigmoid colon via incision around the anus and perineum (the area between the genitals and the anus). Abdominal approach (trans-abdominal approach) involves the surgeon cutting into the abdomen and gaining surgical access to the <b>pelvic</b> <b>cavity.</b> Procedures for rectal prolapse may involve fixation of the bowel (rectopexy), or resection (a portion removed), or both. Trans-anal (endo-anal) procedures are also described where access to the internal rectum is gained through the anus itself.|$|E
40|$|The {{method of}} {{computed}} tomography (CT) brought forward {{the question about}} the anatomic adequacy of the images obtained. At the beginning the carnivores were used as experimental models for the needs of human medicine. Along with the increase in canine and feline populations and in connection with the ensuing and rising diagnostic requirements the interest in CT is increasing in veterinary medicine too. Consequently the clinical cardiology is faced with different anatomical reconstructions of topographic images which impose to examine and make precise the cardiovascular structures in order to remove the diagnostic dilemmas resulting from the individual particularities, the situation of the organs in the thoracic and <b>pelvic</b> <b>cavities</b> at different body positions...|$|R
50|$|Dr. Walker {{had quite}} a broad {{experience}} with surgery. He could go over the whole peritoneal cavity, disregarding today’s distinction between the abdominal and <b>pelvic</b> <b>cavities.</b> Walker knew urology and proctology. Dr. Walker also served as acting Chairman of the Department of Surgery at Hubbard. Finally, as the year 1944 progressed, Dr. Matthew Walker was made Chairman and Professor of the Department of Surgery. As such, Matthew Walker {{served as chairman of}} Meharry's medical school curriculum committee. During this period, with the Dean of the medical school, Dr. Daniel Thomas Rolfe, Dr. Walker revitalized the entire medical school curriculum. Walker served in this position of chair of the medical school curriculum in the 1950s and beyond. He was made a Fellow of the International College of Surgeons in 1947.|$|R
30|$|Varicocele has {{an adverse}} effect on the histologic, endocrine, and testis {{function}} (Romeo and Santoro 2009). Varicocelectomy is indicated {{in the case of}} infertility, when the testicular volume is decreased, such as in adolescents, and when associated with persistent pain (Spinelli et al. 2010). There are several surgical procedures for varicocele. Two meta-analyses considered that the microsurgical varicocelectomy technique has higher spontaneous pregnancy rates and lower postoperative recurrence and hydrocele formation than conventional varicocelectomy techniques in infertile man (Ding et al. 2012; Cayan et al. 2009). LESS has been developed with the hypothesis that minimizing the number of skin incisions needed {{to gain access to the}} abdominal or <b>pelvic</b> <b>cavities</b> may benefit patients in regard to pain control, convalescence, cosmesis, and access related complications. Driven by these advantages, the world experience in urologic LESS is steadily increasing (Wang et al. 2013; Kaouk et al. 2011).|$|R
25|$|The pelvic {{region of}} the trunk is {{the lower part of}} the trunk, between the abdomen and the thighs.

40|$|Purpose: To {{describe}} the postoperative progressive course of advanced-stage adenocarcinoma arising from a mature cystic teratoma (MCT) and review the literature regarding this disease. Methods: A 59 -year-old woman visited our hospital with an abdominal mass. Laparotomy showed {{enlargement of the}} left ovary and dissemination throughout the abdominal and <b>pelvic</b> <b>cavities.</b> The diagnosis was FIGO stage IIIB adenocarcinoma arising from a MCT. We report this case in detail with {{a review of the}} literature. Results: A literature search yielded 9 cases of stage III adenocarcinoma with malignant transformation. Six of these 9 patients died within 12 months after diagnosis. Of the 8 patients who underwent postoperative chemotherapy, 3 survived for over 39 months. The review indicates that prognosis of adenocarcinoma is as poor as that for squamous cell carcinoma arising from a MCT. Conclusions: In general, as with this case, prognosis of advanced adenocarcinoma associated with a MCT is poor. However, we should be aware that not all patients are resistant to chemotherapy...|$|R
2500|$|The blood {{does not}} come into {{direct contact with the}} parenchymal cells and tissues in the body (except in case of an injury causing rupture of one or more blood vessels), but {{constituents}} of the blood first exit the microvascular exchange blood vessels to become interstitial fluid, which comes into contact with the parenchymal cells of the body. Lymph is the fluid that is formed when interstitial fluid enters the initial lymphatic vessels of the lymphatic system. The lymph is then moved along the lymphatic vessel network by either intrinsic contractions of the lymphatic passages or by extrinsic compression of the lymphatic vessels via external tissue forces (e.g., the contractions of skeletal muscles), or by lymph hearts in some animals. The organization of lymph nodes and drainage follows the organization of the body into external and internal regions; therefore, the lymphatic drainage of the head, limbs, and body cavity walls follows an external route, and the lymphatic drainage of the thorax, abdomen, and <b>pelvic</b> <b>cavities</b> follows an internal route.

30|$|At {{the end of}} the {{digestibility}} trial, all experimental {{animals were}} slaughtered after an overnight fasting. Slaughter weight was recorded and animals were killed by severing the jugular vein using a knife. Blood was collected and weighed. The esophagus was tied to prevent the back flow of rumen content while suspending the animals for skinning. The skin was flayed carefully to avoid adherence of fat and muscle tissue to the skin, and was weighed along with legs below the fetlock joints. The weights of the kidney and omental fat, lungs, trachea, esophagus, heart, kidneys, liver with gall bladder, spleen, testis and penis, the entire alimentary canal (esophagus, reticulo-rumen, omasum and abomasum, small intestine and large intestine), full gut, empty gut, tail, tongue and head were recorded separately. Empty body weight was determined by subtracting the gut fill from slaughter body weight. Hot carcass weight was determined by excluding contents of the thoracic, abdominal and <b>pelvic</b> <b>cavities,</b> head, skin, feet and tail of the animal. Dressing percentage was calculated on the bases of slaughter weight and empty body weight as ratio of hot carcass weight to slaughter weight and empty body weight, respectively multiplied by 100.|$|R
2500|$|The {{distance}} between the ischia bones is small in males, making the outlet narrow, but large in females, who have a relatively large outlet.

2500|$|In {{complicated}} diverticulitis, an inflamed diverticulum can rupture, allowing {{bacteria to}} subsequently infect externally from the [...] colon. If the infection spreads to {{the lining of}} the abdominal cavity (the peritoneum), peritonitis results. Sometimes, inflamed diverticula can cause narrowing of the bowel, leading to an obstruction. In some cases, the affected part of the colon adheres to the bladder or other organs in the <b>pelvic</b> <b>cavity,</b> causing a , or creating an abnormal connection between an organ and adjacent structure or other organ (in the case of diverticulitis, the colon and an adjacent organ).|$|E
2500|$|Common {{ostriches}} {{have two}} kidneys, which are chocolate brown in color, granular in texture, and {{lie in a}} depression in the <b>pelvic</b> <b>cavity</b> of the dorsal wall. They are covered by peritoneum and a layer of fat. Each kidney is about [...] long, [...] wide, and divided into a cranial, middle, and caudal sections by large veins. The caudal section is the largest, extends {{into the middle of}} the pelvis. The ureters leave the ventral caudomedial surface and continue caudally, near the midline into the opening of the urodeum of the cloaca. Although there is no bladder, a dilated pouch of ureter stores the urine until it is secreted continuously down from the ureters to the urodeum until discharged.|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of adhesions in the peritoneal and <b>pelvic</b> <b>cavities,</b> which commonly form after surgery or infection, cause significant morbidity and mortality. However, {{the pathogenesis of}} adhesion formation is still poorly understood. Because T cells are important in orchestrating fibrinogenic tissue disorders, we hypothesized that they {{play a critical role}} in the pathogenesis of peritoneal adhesion formation. Using a cecal abrasion surgical model in rodents, T cell depletion and adoptive transfer experiments demonstrated that this host response is dependent on CD 4 � � � T cells. These cells were also critical to adhesion formation associated with experimental intraabdominal sepsis. T cell transfer studies with mice deficient in signal transducer and activator of transcription (Stat) 4 and Stat 6 revealed that adhesion formation was dependent on a T helper 1 response. Activated T cells homed to the peritoneal cavity 6 hours after cecal abrasion surgery and predominated at this site during adhesiogenesis. Increased levels of the T cell– derived proinflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL) - 17 and of neutrophil chemoattractant CXC chemokines macrophage inflammatory protein- 2 /CXCL 8 and cytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattractant/CXCL 1 were associated with adhesion formation.

40|$|İntroduction: Splenosis {{is defined}} as the {{autotransplantation}} of splenic tissue to abnormal locations after splenic injury. Heterotopic spleen can be found within the abdominal and <b>pelvic</b> <b>cavities.</b> We report a tubal splenosis case in a 48 year old woman who underwent splenectomy following a blunt trauma 41 years prior to presentation. Case report: A 48 years old gravida 3, para 3, was admitted to our gynecology clinic for pelvic pain, menstrual irregularities and abnormal bleeding. The patient had a six months history of sonographically detected 40 x 20 mm pelvic mass. She also had a blunt trauma and splenectomy history from 41 years ago. Total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy was performed. Intraoperative exploration revealed a 40 mm sized suspicious mass immediately adjacent to the right fallopian tube. The histopathologic examination of the specimen reported normal splenic tissue with polymorphous small lymphocytes, granulocytes, and frequent hemosiderin laden macrophages. Discussion: Posttraumatic pelvic splenosis is a rare condition. Splenosis should be kept in mind as a differential diagnosis especially for patients with a history of posttraumatic splenectomy who are scheduled for pelvic mass surgery. Although most of the patients are diagnosed postoperatively, if preoperative diagnosis could be made, there is no medical indication for this normally functioning tissue to be resected...|$|R
