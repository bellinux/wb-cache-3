30|$|The {{fact that}} <b>POME</b> {{contains}} substantial concentration of carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, nutrients and minerals favourable for microbial growth {{makes it a}} potential fermentation substrate. However, exploration of <b>POME</b> as a substrate for bioflocculant production is still lacking. So far, only a few studies were reported on isolating bioflocculant-producing microorganisms from <b>POME,</b> i.e. Staphylococcus cohnii spp. (Wong et al. 2012), Chryseomonas luteola (Syafalni et al. 2012), Bacillus marisflavi, Bacillus toyonensis and Stenotrophomonas daejeonensis (Nurul Adela et al. 2015 a). The potential of <b>POME</b> as a carbon source was only recently reported by Aljuboori and co-workers (2014). However, this study reported on the usage of raw <b>POME</b> as a substrate. In <b>POME,</b> there are two forms of carbohydrates, i.e. insoluble and soluble carbohydrates. The amount of total soluble carbohydrates is very low {{compared to that of}} the insoluble ones having high molecular weight such as cellulose, hemicellulose and starch (Ho and Tan 1983). Therefore, it is necessary to hydrolyse the complex carbohydrates in <b>POME</b> prior to fermentation to aid or speed up the microbial process. In this study, raw <b>POME</b> was firstly enzymatically hydrolysed to release the fermentable sugars. The hydrolysed <b>POME</b> was then used as a carbon source to examine its viability for bioflocculant production by B. marisflavi. The optimal conditions in <b>POME</b> hydrolysis and the resulting bioflocculant production by B. marisflavi were also examined.|$|R
