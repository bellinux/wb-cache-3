5|$|Hańska {{wrote to}} Balzac {{several times during}} 1832. On 7 November she posted a seven-page letter filled with praise and flattery:Your soul embraces centuries, Monsieur; its {{philosophical}} concepts {{appear to be the}} fruit of long study matured by time; yet I am told that you are still young. I would like to know you, but feel that I have no need to do so. I know you through my own spiritual instinct; I <b>picture</b> <b>you</b> in my own way and feel that were I to set eyes upon you I should exclaim, 'That is he!' Your outward semblance probably does not reveal your brilliant imagination; you have to be moved, the sacred fire of genius has to be lit, if you are to show yourself as you really are, and you are what I feel you to be—a man superior in his knowledge of the human heart.|$|E
25|$|A fictional {{portrayal}} of Lloyd's Underwriting Room {{was featured in}} the 1965 motion <b>picture</b> <b>You</b> Must Be Joking! The Lutine bell figured prominently in the film's plot.|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{put you on}} a {{pedestal}} and I find you have feet of clay. You have blurred the image which I formed of you. I can never think of <b>you</b> again without <b>picturing</b> <b>you</b> as you stood in that saloon, stammering and helpless...." ...|$|R
500|$|With {{no return}} address, Balzac {{was left to}} reply in the Gazette de France, {{with the hope that}} she would see the notice. She did not, but wrote again in November: [...] "Your soul embraces centuries, monsieur; its {{philosophical}} concepts appear to be the fruit of long study matured by time; yet I am told you are still young. I would like to know you, but feel I have no need to do so. I know you through my own spiritual instinct; I <b>picture</b> <b>you</b> in my own way, and feel that if I were to actually set eyes upon you, I should instantly exclaim, 'That is he!'" ...|$|E
500|$|The {{album was}} {{released}} {{in the rest of}} the world in the first week of February. The title comes as a tangent to the central theme of the album, [...] "the living noise of a metropolis". The cover art is part of A Modern Project by German photographer Rut Blees Luxemburg, famous for her night cityscapes of London and for the cover art of The Streets' Original Pirate Material. The photograph is an aerial image of London's Westway, which shows the road and the adjacent sports pitches lit by the sodium glow of street lamps, and was chosen because the band believed [...] "it was important we captured London breathing". Luxemburg has explained that [...] "in this <b>picture</b> <b>you</b> can see how intricately and optimistically public space in the city is shared".|$|E
500|$|Cagney's {{next film}} was Mister Roberts, {{directed}} by John Ford and slated to star Spencer Tracy. [...] Tracy's involvement ensured that Cagney accepted a supporting role, {{although in the}} end, Tracy did not take part. Cagney had worked with Ford before on What Price Glory?, and they had gotten along fairly well. However, as soon as Ford met Cagney at the airport, the director warned him that they would [...] "tangle asses", which caught Cagney by surprise. He later said, [...] "I would have kicked his brains out. He was so goddamned mean to everybody. He was truly a nasty old man." [...] The next day, Cagney was slightly late on set, incensing Ford. Cagney cut short his imminent tirade, saying [...] "When I started this <b>picture,</b> <b>you</b> said that we would tangle asses before this was over. I'm ready now – are you?" [...] Ford walked away, {{and they had no}} more problems, though Cagney never particularly liked Ford.|$|E
6000|$|... "Surely not, Madame," [...] I said. [...] "Monsieur de St. Gre spoke {{often to}} me of the {{wonderful}} <b>pictures</b> <b>you</b> drew of the personages at court." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I hear so {{much about}} Dalrymple's <b>pictures!</b> <b>You</b> don't mean the {{portrait}} of Lady Glencora Palliser? That is nearly finished, and {{will be in the}} Exhibition this year." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, I wakened {{long enough}} to use the telephone," [...] he replied with a smile. [...] "There are more {{wonderful}} inventions {{in the world than}} motion <b>pictures,</b> <b>you</b> know." ...|$|R
2500|$|Jack Dagger - Dagger is {{the knife}} {{throwing}} stage persona of Todd Abrams, who styles himself as [...] "The King of Fling". His signature stunt is cutting a cucumber or similar vegetable held on his assistant's arm. Abrams {{is also an}} actor, whip artist, and juggler and performed as Adam Sandler's [...] "stunt hands" [...] in the motion <b>picture</b> <b>You</b> Don't Mess with the Zohan. He {{was inducted into the}} International Knife Throwers Hall of Fame in 2005 as [...] "Impalement Artist of the Year" [...] and was honoured as [...] "National Knife Throwing Performer of the Year" [...] in 2006.|$|E
2500|$|A {{turning point}} of his artistic life came when he first noticed a fellow student drawing. Baal-Teshuva writes that for the young Chagall, {{watching}} someone draw [...] "was like a vision, a revelation in black and white". Chagall would later {{say that there was}} no art of any kind in his family's home and the concept was totally alien to him. When Chagall asked the schoolmate how he learned to draw, his friend replied, [...] "Go and find a book in the library, idiot, choose any <b>picture</b> <b>you</b> like, and just copy it". He soon began copying images from books and found the experience so rewarding he then decided he wanted to become an artist.|$|E
2500|$|The {{great thing}} about Kylie is that she differs from other celebrities. There is a {{separation}} between how celebrities perceive themselves and what the public wants to see. Most are concerned with reproducing a certain logo or caricature of themselves. They want to cling on to an image developed years ago which makes things difficult {{because there is no}} room to take a <b>picture,</b> <b>you</b> aren't really forced to improvise which is when the best things happen. Every photographer has their own very personal vision of her, and she lets them have it. That is the big difference with Kylie, that she walks in and says 'This is me, {{what are you going to}} do with it.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, Warburton does {{everything}} one wants," [...] Miss Molyneux {{answered with a}} quick, shy laugh. [...] "How very many <b>pictures</b> <b>you</b> have!" [...] she went on, turning to Ralph.|$|R
6000|$|With no {{suspicion}} of being passed {{from hand to}} hand, she promised to send him her address, and said: [...] "I'd {{like to see the}} <b>pictures</b> <b>you</b> have here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If <b>you</b> like <b>pictures,</b> <b>you</b> shall {{come and}} see mine some day. I do a great many. Papa shows me how. His are splendid. Do you draw or paint yours?" ...|$|R
2500|$|In 2010, she starred with Aaron Eckhart in {{the film}} {{adaptation}} of the Pulitzer Prize-winning play Rabbit Hole, for which she vacated {{her role in the}} Woody Allen <b>picture</b> <b>You</b> Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger. Her work on Rabbit Hole earned her critical acclaim, and received nominations for the Academy Awards, Golden Globe Awards, and Screen Actors Guild Awards, Kidman also produced this film. She lent her voice to a promotional video that Australia used to support its bid to host the 2018 FIFA World Cup. TV Guide reported in 2008 that Kidman will star in The Danish Girl, a film adaptation of the novel of the same name, playing Lili Elbe, the world's first postoperative transsexual. Screen Daily reported that shooting would begin in Germany in July 2011. However the project has been delayed following the exit of the director, Lasse Hallström and Kidman's co-star Rachel Weisz. In 2009, Variety [...] said that she would produce and star in a film adaptation of the Chris Cleave novel Little Bee, in association with BBC Films.|$|E
60|$|A {{disturbing}} <b>picture,</b> <b>you</b> will admit. It {{was with}} a rather imperious gesture that I summoned Jeeves to my side.|$|E
6000|$|... "Merry, {{you look}} purty as a <b>picture.</b> <b>You</b> {{look just like}} the wife I be'n a-huntin' for all these years, sure 's shootin'." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I can't wait {{to show it}} to you, Honora--to see you in it," [...] he exclaimed. [...] "I have so long <b>pictured</b> <b>you</b> there, and {{our life}} as it will be." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "O Dick, Dick, how sore {{my heart}} has been! Your father {{said you could}} not get across the desert on foot, and I have <b>pictured</b> <b>you</b> lying on the sands dying." ...|$|R
6000|$|As she re-entered the sitting-room a tall girl rose languidly to meet her, and Lawson said: [...] "Miss Curtis, this is Miss Brisbane, {{the painter}} of the <b>pictures</b> <b>you</b> see about." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There be a reason, Father, why I {{must remain}} in England {{for a time}} at least, though the <b>picture</b> <b>you</b> put is indeed wondrous alluring." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, well! Then you'd {{better go}} to her, my dear!" [...] her new friend said, soothingly. [...] "She'll find you the <b>picture</b> <b>you</b> want. Good-bye, dear!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's a pity {{you were}} not here a few minutes ago. I have just bought a <b>picture.</b> <b>You</b> might have put the thing through for me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How I hated {{you when}} I saw you! What a fright I thought <b>you</b> were! I <b>pictured</b> <b>you</b> to {{myself as a}} sort of ogre, willing to eat up {{everybody}} for the gratification of your own vanity." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I want to," [...] she answered. [...] "It isn't all curiosity. I think it's {{time for}} women to insist on seeing war with their own eyes, not trust any longer to the <b>pictures</b> <b>you</b> men paint." [...] She smiled.|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't!" [...] she interrupted. [...] "You {{know what}} I mean. Do leave off {{painting}} your ghastly <b>pictures.</b> <b>You</b> know quite well what I mean. Philip Romilly is here by my side. What can {{they hope to}} find there in his place?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'What persistence!' exclaimed Paula, colouring. 'Very well, if you WILL {{photograph}} my <b>picture</b> <b>you</b> must. It {{is really}} not worthy further pleading. Take it when you like.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What <b>picture,</b> <b>you</b> natural?" [...] {{said his}} father. [...] "I {{used to think}} you only a scapegrace, but I believe you will turn out a born idiot." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll {{have the}} lot," [...] he muttered. [...] "Every drop; every d--d drop! Ay, and I'll keep the <b>picture.</b> <b>You</b> see, my friend, you see; deal the cards." ...|$|E
60|$|What lovely <b>pictures</b> <b>you</b> {{would have}} made in the old {{butterfly}} times, of opal and felspar! What lost creatures we all are, we nice ones! The Alps and clouds that I could have done, if I had been shown how.|$|R
60|$|JENNIFER. It is {{too late}} for reproaches now. When I turned and saw you just now, I {{wondered}} how you could come here coolly {{to look at his}} <b>pictures.</b> <b>You</b> answered the question. To you, he was only a clever brute.|$|R
6000|$|... "I can't realise it, even now," [...] {{she went}} on, drawing {{her hand away}} at last. [...] "I <b>pictured</b> <b>you</b> at Westminster, in {{committee}} rooms {{and all sorts of}} places. Aren't you forging weapons to drive us from our homes and portion out our savings?" ...|$|R
