40|$|Individual {{and group}} {{identity}} is often {{closely associated with}} language use. Language, in turn, often serves {{as a proxy for}} culture which provides the background against which language use occurs. For the Greek community in Melbourne, Australia, use of Greek is an important symbolic aspect of ethnic identification <b>and</b> <b>personal</b> <b>and</b> groupidentity. Even for those younger members of the community whose daily interactions occur primarily in English and who view themselves as first language speakers of English, Greek plays a specific role in <b>expression</b> of <b>personal</b> identity <b>and</b> <b>cultural</b> <b>expression.</b> The use of Greek provides a link to the culture of origin and serves as a symbolic marker of association with a specific group in the larger Australian context. For first generation Greek Australians, exposure to the language and culture came primarily from immigrant parents. However, many of these individuals also attended Greek school which served to reinforce their knowledge and ability to use the language. Their children, the second generation, often use Greek words routinely in specific contexts, such as when talking about food and religion or when referring to family members (grandmother, grandfather). While they often attend Greek school as well, there is evidence that overall ability to speak Greek fluently in the community is declining. Nonetheless, selective use of Greek terms remains an important identity marker. This paper will describe the use of Greek words and terms by English–speaking members of the Melbourne community and discuss its significance as a form of <b>cultural</b> identification <b>and</b> <b>personal</b> identity. The phenomenon of Greek school as a vehicle for language exposure will also be discussed. Data, based on in depth interviews with members of the Greek community, will be used to illustrate the contexts in which switches to Greek occur and elucidate the cognitive background of such usage...|$|R
40|$|An {{eighteenth-century}} book of woven samples can {{be considered}} as a seminal link between the production of raw materials in one <b>cultural</b> context <b>and</b> clothing or furnishing in another. In bringing images of such samples from Norwich to Hawaii for a twenty-first century conference on Textiles as <b>Cultural</b> <b>Expressions</b> I am also conscious of mapping an openended dialogue which engages the historical and the contemporary. This perspective is recognized by anthropologist Arjun Appadurai when he says that ‘from a methodological point of view it is the things-in-motion that illuminate their human and social context. Thus, although consideration of books and cards of samples from late eighteenth century Norwich (UK) form the material evidence informing this account, it is the notion of ‘textilein- motion’ that most appropriately highlights textile as cultural agency, enabling a fuller understanding of ways in which textile systems and visual semantics intersect with economic, social, political, technical, linguistic <b>and</b> <b>personal</b> interests. <b>Cultural</b> <b>expression</b> is as pertinent to the historian as it is to the material traces of the history that is studied, and as Appadurai and others demonstrate in The Social Life of Things, textiles are particularly potent as agents <b>and</b> signifiers of <b>cultural</b> formation. Perhaps it is as an agency of formation rather than as ‘expression’ that textile holds greatest sway...|$|R

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to sketch out the parameters of the fashion industry. Whilst, without doubt fashion is a means of <b>personal</b> <b>and</b> <b>cultural</b> <b>expression,</b> it is also an industry. The industrial and economic aspects have been relatively under-researched. We highlight the fact that the fashion industry is fast evolving, and growing. Traditional economic analyses have under-examined some of the crucial drivers of change in this sector but these are all important issues for a number of reasons. First, the local and global consequences of the transformation of the fashion industry help us to understand the challenges facing urban and regional economies, particularly in Europe. Second, the fashion industry, like the cultural industries more generally, is leading a new form of economic development that blends qualitative elements and quantitative forms, a culturalisation of economic action. In so doing we also raise three questions, one has already been alluded to: what is the ‘fashion industry’; and following this, a second: is the fashion industry the same, or different, to other cultural industries? Finally, in relation to the dynamics of change, we point to the role of situatedness: the importance of place and institutional embedding...|$|E
40|$|The Belgian city of Ghent in the {{province}} East-Flanders accomodates ca 15, 000 people of Turkish origin, representing 6 % of the population. In general, they live concentrated in certain neighbourhoods of the city, forming communities characterized by strong family and community ties. Culturally, the language, religion and overall culture of {{their country of origin}} still {{play an important role in}} their lifes (Kanmaz, 2003; Kaya & Kentel, 2007). Within and beyond those communities, Turkish folk music manifests itself in diverse social strata and seems to play an important role in the process of identity construction. This is also the case in Turkey itself, where Turkish folk music continues to function as an adequate means of <b>personal</b> <b>and</b> <b>cultural</b> <b>expression.</b> The broad genre of ‘Turkish folk music’, however, is a complex and diverse field in itself, consisting of many interrelated variables (distinct repertoires and performance styles, different meanings and functions – depending on the regional and social contexts where it occurs). This paper investigates these interactions by elucidating the individual and social meanings and functions of this music genre in the specified diaspora context, also referring to a broader context through a comparison with the situation in Turkey. Methodologically, a qualitative, ethnographic approach will be applied to a selection of cases (musical events). An etic perspective (based on observation) will be combined with an emic perspective (based on structured interviews with musicians, audience and employers) ...|$|E
500|$|The [...] "ancient {{craft of}} {{communicating}} events and experiences, using words, images, sounds and gestures" [...] by {{telling a story}} {{is not only the}} means by which people passed on their <b>cultural</b> values <b>and</b> traditions and history from one generation to another, it has been an important part of most forms of entertainment ever since the earliest times. Stories are still told in the early forms, for example, around a fire while camping, or when listening to the stories of another culture as a tourist. [...] "The earliest storytelling sequences we possess, now of course, committed to writing, were undoubtedly originally a speaking from mouth to ear and their force as entertainment derived from the very same elements we today enjoy in films and novels." [...] Storytelling is an activity that has evolved and developed [...] "toward variety". Many entertainments, including storytelling but especially music and drama, remain familiar but have developed into a wide variety of form to suit a very wide range of <b>personal</b> preferences <b>and</b> <b>cultural</b> <b>expression.</b> Many types are blended or supported by other forms. For example, drama, stories and banqueting (or dining) are commonly enhanced by music; sport and games are incorporated into other activities to increase appeal. Some may have evolved from serious or necessary activities (such as running and jumping) into competition and then become entertainment. It is said, for example, that pole vaulting [...] "may have originated in the Netherlands, where people used long poles to vault over wide canals rather than wear out their clogs walking miles to the nearest bridge. Others maintain that pole vaulting was used in warfare to vault over fortress walls during battle." [...] The equipment for such sports has become increasingly sophisticated. Vaulting poles, for example, were originally made from woods such as ash, hickory or hazel; [...] in the 19th century bamboo was used and in the 21st century poles can be made of carbon fibre. Other activities, such as walking on stilts, are still seen in circus performances in the 21st century. Gladiatorial combats, also known as [...] "gladiatorial games", popular during Roman times, provide a good example of an activity that is a combination of sport, punishment, and entertainment.|$|R

40|$|Abstract The {{originality}} {{and significance}} {{of this research is}} to use a?cross-modal? perspective to experience the ?multi-dimensional? nature of the arts, specifically in the area of music and the visual arts. This research will focus on investigating common cross-disciplinary attributes and apply them in the realm of ?appreciation? in aesthetic education in music and visual art. 	 The three major research problems and issues in this dissertation are as follows: (1) What are the common elements in music and the visual arts? (2) Do people make correspondences between music and painting by using the work of painters and musicians? (3) How do we define the role of music and its adaptability in linking with other expressive forms in contemporary education? Ultimately, the entire dissertation serves to redefine the ?value? and uniqueness of the arts (music and visual art) in the holistic development of an individual, in particularly in moulding and enhancing the skills of <b>personal</b> <b>and</b> <b>cultural</b> <b>expression.</b> 	 The aims in this research are taken from various angles which correspond with the questions about ?interdisciplinary study? and the ideas of ?changing teaching and learning? in the 21 st century. Interdisciplinary Studies has been a term which has provoked a great deal of controversy in current educational development, particularly in Asian countries, and especially in music education. The originality of this research lies in three areas. First, a cross-modal perspective is used to explore the common elements in music and visual art, especially in the dimensions of ?brightness?, ?intensity? and ?line?. Second, a cross-modal perspective in music will be adopted. Instead of focusing on the melody, harmony and form of music repertoire, sensory qualities, such as ?brightness?, ?intensity? and ?line? will be used as musical vocabulary to interpret cross-modal perception in experiencing the arts. Third, this dissertation will investigate the art experience, especially the thinking and cognitive appraisal in viewing the arts, of the creators and the spectators...|$|E

40|$|Works {{of artistic}} <b>and</b> <b>cultural</b> <b>expression</b> have been celebrated, censored, deplored and debated since the {{beginning}} of Western Civilization. Cultural achievements have long been identified as sources of moral uplift, symbols of status and refinement, the basis for civic identity, and the expression of collective values. The arts have also been the source of bitter conflict and the target of political and ideological passions ever since the Old Testament proclaimed, “Thou shalt not make unto thee a graven image. ” Over the years, Americans have, more or less, successfully navigated this cultural sea, tossed between waves of outrage and approbation over artworks <b>and</b> <b>cultural</b> <b>expression</b> that both challenge and affirm notions of public morality, decency, shared values and beauty. Recently, the pitch and intensity of these debates seem to have risen as art <b>and</b> <b>cultural</b> <b>expression</b> have been depicted on the front pages of our newspapers as sources of conflict over the boundaries of permissible expression in American communities.
