5000|$|<b>Page</b> <b>mode</b> DRAM {{was later}} {{improved}} {{with a small}} modification which further reduced latency. DRAMs with this improvement were called fast <b>page</b> <b>mode</b> DRAMs (FPM DRAMs). In <b>page</b> <b>mode</b> DRAM, [...] was asserted before the column address was supplied. In FPM DRAM, the column address could be supplied while [...] was still deasserted. The column address propagated through the column address data path, but did not output data on the data pins until [...] was asserted. Prior to [...] being asserted, the data out pins were held at high-Z. FPM DRAM reduced tCAC latency.|$|E

40|$|Three buffer {{systems of}} Imidazole 2 Acetic acid, HEPES 2 Imidazole/Bis-tris and Bis-tris 2 HEPES 2 MES were {{designed}} {{based on the}} principle of discontinuous polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) for the native PAGE which could be performed in pH 7. 0 and 6. 5 in order to analyze and prepare the minor components of allophycocyanin (AP) and R-phycocyanin (R-PC) from marine red macroalga Polysiphonia urceolata. These AP and R-PC phycobiliproteins are easily denatured in alkaline environments. The obtained results demonstrated that the <b>PAGE</b> <b>modes</b> performed in the buffer systems of HEPES 2 Imidazole/Bis-tris and Bis-tris 2 HEPES 2 MES gave the satisfactory resolution and separation of AP and R-PC proteins. The absorption and fluorescence spectra of the AP and R-PC proteins which were prepared by the established <b>PAGE</b> <b>modes</b> proved that they maintained natural spectroscopic characteristics. The established <b>PAGE</b> <b>modes</b> may also provide useful references and selections for some other proteins that are sensitive to alkaline environments or are not effectively separated by the classical <b>PAGE</b> <b>modes</b> performed normally in alkaline buffer systems...|$|R
50|$|As a result, {{a greater}} number of {{programs}} were able to utilize the enhanced direct <b>page</b> addressing <b>mode</b> versus legacy processors that only included the zero <b>page</b> addressing <b>mode.</b>|$|R
50|$|Additionally, a third index {{register}} (Z) was included, the stack pointer was widened to 16 bits, and the zero <b>page</b> addressing <b>mode</b> was superseded {{by the more}} flexible direct <b>page</b> addressing <b>mode.</b>|$|R

50|$|EDO DRAM, {{sometimes}} referred to as Hyper <b>Page</b> <b>Mode</b> enabled DRAM, is similar to Fast <b>Page</b> <b>Mode</b> DRAM with the additional feature that a new access cycle can be started while keeping the data output of the previous cycle active. This allows a certain amount of overlap in operation (pipelining), allowing somewhat improved performance. It was 5% faster than FPM DRAM, which it began to replace in 1995, when Intel introduced the 430FX chipset that supported EDO DRAM.|$|E
50|$|DRAM {{technologies}} used in SIMMs include FPM (Fast <b>Page</b> <b>Mode</b> memory, used in all 30-pin {{and early}} 72-pin modules), and the higher-performance EDO DRAM (used in later 72-pin modules).|$|E
40|$|SPC- 3 {{allows the}} Protocol-Specific Port <b>mode</b> <b>page</b> (19 h) to use either the per target port or the shared <b>mode</b> <b>page</b> policy: (from spc 3 r 20 a 7. 4. 14) The <b>mode</b> <b>page</b> policy (see 6. 7) for this <b>mode</b> <b>page</b> shall be shared or per target port {{and should be}} per target port. If a target device has {{multiple}} target ports, changes in the parameters for one target port should not affect other target ports. However, the READY LED MEANING bit that SAS- 1. 1 defines in the page doesn’t make sense with as a per target port bit, since the SAS drive connector only includes one READY LED pin for its two ports (not one per port). Different settings for different target ports don’t make sense. The bit needs to be considered always shared regardless of the mode policy. This {{is similar to the}} TST field in the Control <b>mode</b> <b>page</b> in SPC- 3, which is always shared regardless of the <b>mode</b> <b>page</b> policy of that <b>mode</b> <b>page.</b> Suggested changes to SAS- 1. 1 0. 0. 0. 0. 1 Protocol-Specific Port <b>mode</b> <b>page</b> overview The Protocol-Specific Port <b>mode</b> <b>page</b> (see SPC- 3) contains parameters that affect SSP target port operation. If the <b>mode</b> <b>page</b> is implemented, all logical units in SCSI target devices in SAS domains supporting the MODE SELECT or MODE SENSE commands shall implement the page, and there shall be one copy of the <b>mode</b> <b>page</b> shared by all SSP initiator ports. If a SAS target device has multiple SSP target ports, changes in the short page parameters for one SSP target port should not affect other SSP target ports.

5000|$|<b>Page</b> <b>mode</b> DRAM {{is a minor}} {{modification}} to the first-generation DRAM IC interface which {{improved the}} performance of reads and writes to a row by avoiding the inefficiency of precharging and opening the same row repeatedly to access a different column.
