50|$|In {{regard to}} the effects of father absence, a recent British study {{assessed}} child <b>problem</b> <b>behaviour</b> in over 15,000 families using the clinical cut-offs of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), controlling for household factors such as resources, parental mental health and inter-parental relationship. The study found that father absence at a given age, similar to poverty and parental psychological distress, predicted a high probability of the child scoring above the cut-off score for total difficulties two years later. Likewise, father absence predicted several specific difficulties including borderline personality disorder, severe hyperactivity and abnormal emotional problems. Reciprocally, a child’s severe externalising and social during his/her preschool years were also associated with a greater probability of the father being absent two years later. The authors concluded that father absence seemed {{to be more of a}} cause than a consequence of child <b>problem</b> <b>behaviour.</b>|$|E

50|$|Since {{parents are}} {{role models for}} their children, it is {{critical}} to understand parental behaviour in the context of adolescent sexuality. Unsafe parental behaviour (such as smoking) are linked to adolescent engagement in risky behaviour. The fact that a parent smokes increases the likelihood of an adolescent engaging in <b>problem</b> <b>behaviour,</b> including risky sexual behaviour. The idea that risk is reproduced in generations is evident; parental behaviour is mirrored by the adolescent. Kim, Schooler and Sorsoli demonstrated “that adolescents’ perceptions of parental caring are an important mechanism in the association between parental television involvement and adolescents’ self-esteem, body image and sexuality”. Parental involvement is desirable when viewing sexual behaviour on TV; the shared experience enables parents to clarify what is seen. Parents and peers both influence adolescent sexuality.|$|E
40|$|Aim – Previous {{studies of}} the {{association}} between polydrug use and other risk behaviours have generally been limited to specific substances and {{a small number of}} behaviours. The aim {{of this study is to}} obtain better insight into polydrug use (comprising legal and illegal substances: tobacco, alcohol, tranquillisers/sedatives, cannabis, and other illegal drugs) and its association with co-occurring <b>problem</b> <b>behaviours</b> drawn from various broad domains (sexual, aggressive, delinquent, school achievement, relationships) among European adolescents. METHODS – Data were obtained from 101, 401 16 -year-old students from 35 European countries participating in the 2011 ESPAD survey. Associations between polydrug use and other <b>problem</b> <b>behaviours</b> were examined by multinomial and binary logistic regression analyses. RESULTS – Tranquillisers/sedatives appeared among the commonest combinations in the polydrug use pattern, especially for females. A strong trend was found between levels of involvement with polydrug use and other <b>problem</b> <b>behaviours</b> for both genders. The highest associations with polydrug use were for problems with the police, risky sexual behaviour and skipping school. Gender differences showed higher prevalences among boys than girls of <b>problem</b> <b>behaviours</b> of aggressive, antisocial type, while girls prevailed over boys in relationship problems. CONCLUSION – An incremental relationship exists between the level of involvement with polydrug use and the co-occurrence of <b>problem</b> <b>behaviours.</b> Preventative interventions should consider the misuse of tranquillisers/sedatives within the context of polydrug use by adolescents and expand their target groups towards multiple <b>problem</b> <b>behaviours...</b>|$|R
40|$|Background The {{positive}} relationship between <b>problem</b> <b>behaviours</b> of children with additional complex needs and psychological distress in their caregivers has been widely evidenced. Fewer studies, however, have assessed the relationship between care recipients’ <b>problem</b> <b>behaviours</b> and key physiological processes, relevant for the physical health status of their care providers. This study examined the psychological, endocrine and health corollaries of child <b>problem</b> <b>behaviours</b> in caregivers of children with autism and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Methods Caregivers (n[*]=[*] 18) completed self-report measures of psychological distress, child <b>problem</b> <b>behaviours</b> and incidences of commonly occurring ailments. To capture important parameters of the basal diurnal cortisol pattern, caregivers collected saliva samples at waking, 30 [*]min post waking, 1200 [*]h and 2200 [*]h on two consecutive weekdays. Results Data revealed a {{positive relationship}} between caregivers’ perceived levels of stress and problems with child conduct behaviours. In addition, caregivers who reported more problems with child emotional and hyperactivity behaviours displayed atypical cortisol patterns characterised by flatter diurnal cortisol slopes and reduced cortisol awakening response magnitude.

Although pre-contemplative smokers (individuals believing they do not exhibit any <b>problem</b> <b>behaviour)</b> revealed high levels of omnipotence, ex-smokers did as well. These results suggest personal fable actually {{plays an important role in}} smoking cessation and researchers should consider re-evaluating the constructs to determine whether omnipotence could become stronger after smoking cessation (omnipotence in this particular case being the individual’s belief that he can stop smoking whenever he wants).

This study examined the relationship between <b>problem</b> <b>behaviours</b> and other psychopathology, and compared the predictive validity of dimensional and categorical models experienced by adults with intellectual disabilities. Methods Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses appropriate for non-continuous data were used to derive, and validate, symptom dimensions using two clinical datasets (n = 457; n = 274). Categorical diagnoses were derived using DC-LD. Severity and 5 -year longitudinal outcome was measured using a battery of instruments. Results Five factors/dimensions were identified and confirmed. <b>Problem</b> <b>behaviours</b> were included in an emotion dysregulation-problem behaviour dimension that was distinct from the depressive, anxiety, organic and psychosis dimensions.

40|$|In this study, gender {{differences}} in adolescent <b>problem</b> <b>behaviour</b> and its possible causes on the individual and contextual level are analysed. The focus lies on differences {{between boys and girls}} in the influence of personality, family and national cultural context characteristics. Insights from different theoretical traditions are combined. We use information on 18, 027 adolescents from 24 European countries from the 2010 EU Kids Online Survey to estimate multivariate multilevel models on important determinants of <b>problem</b> <b>behaviour</b> and their gender specific influence. Consistent with previous research, we find that adolescent boys show more <b>problem</b> <b>behaviour</b> than adolescent girls. Personality traits, such as self-control, largely explain this gender gap. Low self-control affects girls more strongly than boys. Both adolescent boys and girls in single parent households are more likely to participate in <b>problem</b> <b>behaviour.</b> Boys are more likely to use <b>problem</b> <b>behaviour</b> to cope with a low socioeconomic parental status than girls. Lastly, we found that the gender gap in <b>problem</b> <b>behaviour</b> differs between countries, and is partly explained by the level of gender inequality in a country. Cultural gender norms hinder <b>problem</b> <b>behaviour</b> among adolescent girls, whereas boys show more <b>problem</b> <b>behaviour</b> in these countries...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Objective: In {{this study}} {{the quality of}} the affective {{parent-child}} relationship and {{the quality of the}} sibling relationship were examined in relation to externalising and internalising <b>problem</b> <b>behaviour</b> of young adolescents. Method: A total of 574 10 - to 14 - year-olds filled out questionnaires on parent-child relationship quality, sibling relationship quality and externalizing and internalizing <b>problem</b> <b>behaviour.</b> Results: Results showed a significant effect between a low quality of affective parent-child relationship and a low quality of sibling relationship on the one hand and increase in both externalising and internalising <b>problem</b> <b>behaviour</b> on the other hand. For high quality parent-child and sibling relationships this significant effect on either forms of <b>problem</b> <b>behaviour</b> was not found. Conclusions: A low affective quality of the parent-child relationship and low quality of the sibling relationship were found to be risk-factors for externalizing and internalizing <b>problem</b> <b>behaviour.</b> A high quality of both relationships was not found to be a protective factor for externalizing and internalizing <b>problem</b> <b>behaviour...</b>|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} whether {{the total amount}} of time in childcare through the first 3  years of life was associated with children's receptive vocabulary, externalising and internalising <b>problem</b> <b>behaviours</b> at age 4 - 5  years, and whether this association varied for different types of childcare. METHODS: We used data from the prospective, population-based Longitudinal Study of Australian Children (n= 3208 - 4066, depending on outcome). Parental reports of the time spent in different types of childcare were collected at face-to-face interviews at age 0 - 1 years and at age 2 - 3  years. Children's receptive vocabulary was directly assessed in the child's home, and externalising and internalising behaviours were measured by questionnaire, completed by parents and teachers at age 4 - 5  years. RESULTS: At 3  years of age, 75 % of the sample spent regular time in the care of someone other than the parent. After adjustment, more time in childcare was not associated with children's receptive vocabulary ability but was associated with higher levels of parent-reported (β= 0. 10 (95 % CI 0. 00 to  0. 21)) and teacher-reported (β= 0. 31 (0. 19 to 0. 44)) externalising <b>problem</b> <b>behaviours</b> and lower levels of parent-reported internalising <b>problem</b> <b>behaviours</b> (β=- 0. 08 (- 0. 15 to - 0. 00)). Compared with children who did not attend any type of childcare, children in centre-based care had higher parent-reported and teacher-reported externalising and lower internalising <b>problem</b> <b>behaviours.</b> CONCLUSIONS: More time in centre-based childcare (but not other types of care) through the first 3  years of life was associated with higher parent-reported and teacher-reported externalising <b>problem</b> <b>behaviours,</b> and lower parent-reported internalising <b>problem</b> <b>behaviours</b> but not with children's receptive vocabulary ability at school entry.

40|$|Children and {{adolescents}} {{at risk for}} school failure have {{become the focus of}} increased attention because the severity of problems facing them has been intensifying. Teachers report that at-risk children {{and adolescents}} in the classroom are not only effecting their own educational opportunities but also those of their peers. Furthermore, in the area of education services for First Nation communities, biases in the identification of at-risk students has been suggested to exist. In order for effective remediation to occur, it is necessary to examine those processes which place children and adolescents at-risk. As <b>problem</b> <b>behaviours</b> have been identified as placing children and adolescents at risk for failure in school or life, those variables which influence the development of <b>problem</b> <b>behaviours</b> need be understood. Thus {{the purpose of the present}} study is to investigate the predictors of <b>problem</b> <b>behaviours</b> which place the student population served by the Saskatoon Tribal Council at risk for failure in school. Specifically, the study examines the predictors of <b>problem</b> <b>behaviours</b> as measured by the Teacher Rating Scale of the Behaviour Rating Profile- 2 nd Edition with the variables sex, age group, school, nonverbal reasoning ability as measured by the Matrix Analogies Test-Short Form, and academic performance as measured by the teacher completed Academic Performance Rating Scale. In determining the strength of the relationship between the variables <b>problem</b> <b>behaviours,</b> academic performance, non-verbal reasoning ability, age group, sex, and school correlates are presented. Further analysis of the data using multiple linear regression, with <b>problem</b> <b>behaviours</b> as the criterion variable and non-verbal reasoning ability, academic performance, school, sex, and age group as the predictor variables are reported. The present study also determined if there is a significant difference in <b>problem</b> <b>behaviours</b> for the student population served by the Saskatoon Tribal Council as based on age group (6 to 9 years of age, 10 to 13 years of age, and 14 to 18 years of age), sex (male and female), and school (Band or provincial). The results of the study indicate that because academic performance continues to be such a strong predictor of <b>problem</b> <b>behaviours,</b> underscores the importance of the school as an ameliorative factor in the prevention and treatment of behavioural problems. As well, because females 10 to 13 years of age attending provincial schools are rated with fewer <b>problem</b> <b>behaviours</b> than their counterparts attending Band schools, or those in other age groups, is indicative of the need for the appropriate allocation of resources for children and youth at-risk. Given these findings, the present study recognizes the significance of intervention as a preventive measure for all age groups and the responsibility of federal and provincial funding agencies to continue to make available to First Nation communities resources appropriate for the development of educational services for students at-risk...|$|R
40|$|<b>Problem</b> <b>behaviours</b> in {{children}} with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) are {{a major source of}} parenting stress, as they restrict family capacity to maintain quality domestic and social life. It is therefore critical to support parents to manage the <b>problem</b> <b>behaviours</b> of their child with ASD. Recent mindfulness intervention studies have successfully addressed this issue. The current pilot study pursues this line of enquiry and extends the scope of mindfulness intervention by training parents to become a mindfulness teacher of their own child with ASD and <b>problem</b> <b>behaviours,</b> so together they can work on enhancing the quality of their domestic and social life. A total of six dyads of mothers (CA range 34 – 48 years) and children with ASD and <b>problem</b> <b>behaviours</b> (CA range 8 – 15 years) participated in a two-stage mindfulness intervention. Mothers attended an 8 -week mindfulness program to attain fluency in the theory and practice of mindfulness meditation (Stage 1). Based on this fluency they then taught mindfulness activities to their child (Stage 2). This paper reports on the effects of the mindfulness intervention provided for mothers (Stage 1) and children (Stage 2) as demonstrated by the level of mindfulness, parenting stress, and family quality of life for mothers, and <b>problem</b> <b>behaviours</b> for children. The results highlight overall improvements in the targeted areas. Some benefits, issues, and challenges of mindfulness training for parents and their children with ASD are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Background: During the {{adolescent}} period, risktaking behaviour increases. These behaviours can compromise the successful transition from adolescence to adulthood. The {{purpose of this}} study was to examine social support as a mediator of the relation between <b>problem</b> <b>behaviour</b> and gambling frequency among Finnish adolescents. Methods: Data were obtained from the national School Health Promotion Study (SHPS) from the years 2010 and 2011 (N= 102 545). Adolescents were classified in the most homogeneous groups based on their <b>problem</b> <b>behaviour</b> via latent class analysis. Results: Path analysis indicated that social support was negatively associated with <b>problem</b> <b>behaviour,</b> and <b>problem</b> <b>behaviour</b> and social support were negatively related (except for social support from friends among boys) to gambling. Social support from parents and school mediated, albeit weakly, the relations between <b>problem</b> <b>behaviour</b> and gambling among girls and boys. Conclusions: <b>Problem</b> <b>behaviour</b> may affect gambling through social support from school and parents. Thus prevention and intervention strategies should focus on strengthening adolescents’ social support. In addition,because of the clustering of different problem behaviours instead of concentrating on a single form of <b>problem</b> <b>behaviour</b> multiple-behaviour interventions may have a much greater impact on public health...|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} we tried to answer the {{question}} what the effect is of quality of the sibling relation (warmth/closeness, relative status/power and conflict) on externalizing <b>problem</b> <b>behaviour</b> of early adolescents. An additional question was if there were differences between gender combinations (sisters, brothers and mixed-sex sibling pairs) in these effects. The research showed that relative status/power has a negative connection with externalizing <b>problem</b> <b>behaviour.</b> Conflict has a positive connection with externalizing <b>problem</b> <b>behaviour.</b> Sisters scored the highest on warmth/closeness, which means that they have a warmer sibling relationship than brothers and mixed-sex sibling pairs. Furthermore, brothers had a significant higher score on conflict than sisters. There are differences between the three gender combinations with regard to the effect of quality of the sibling relation on externalizing <b>problem</b> <b>behaviour.</b> Firstly, the effect of relative status/power on externalizing <b>problem</b> <b>behaviour</b> is higher for brothers than for sisters and mixed-sex sibling pairs. Secondly, the effect of conflict on externalizing <b>problem</b> <b>behaviour</b> is higher for brothers and sisters than for mixed-sex sibling pairs. 	The results of this research show that quality of the sibling relation is an important predictor of externalizing <b>problem</b> <b>behaviour.</b> More knowledge about this subject is important for the field of prevention...|$|E

However, no relationship was found between empathy and externalizing <b>problem</b> <b>behaviour.</b> Mediation analysis showed that the relationship between moral judgment and externalizing <b>problem</b> <b>behaviour</b> was explained by cognitive distortions. The conclusion from this study is that cognitive distortions are an important predictor of externalizing <b>problem</b> <b>behaviour.</b> Perhaps these results can lead to developing a program for children with externalizing problems that reduces the prevalence of cognitive distortions...|$|E

40|$|Psychiatric {{medications}} {{are often}} used {{in the treatment of}} mental disorders as well as for <b>problem</b> <b>behaviours</b> in people with learning disabilities. However, there is little evidence directly relating to people with learning disability, and most treatment decisions and experience of medication are based on research in the general population. Good practice demands that clinicians make every effort to ascertain whether the presenting complaints are those of a diagnosable mental disorder and that there is multidisciplinary support to ameliorate <b>problem</b> <b>behaviours...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{current study}} {{examined}} emotion socialization (ES) processes in mothers {{of children with}} autism spectrum disorder (ASD) using a quantitative and qualitative approach. The quantitative methodology was used to explore ES practices and the outcome of child <b>problem</b> <b>behaviours,</b> while taking into account maternal characteristics of the broad autism phenotype (BAP) and distress (stress, anxiety, depression and parenting stress). For the quantitative portion of the study, participants included 57 mothers of children age 6 to 16 years diagnosed with high functioning ASD. Mothers were separated into groups: without BAP status group and with BAP status group. The results revealed that ES practices alone did not predict child <b>problem</b> <b>behaviours.</b> However, with the inclusion of distress as a moderator, the relation between ES and <b>problem</b> <b>behaviours</b> revealed differences between the BAP groups. That is, in mothers without BAP status, when predicting child <b>problem</b> <b>behaviours,</b> stress moderated emotion coaching, supportive reactions, and positive expressiveness. Anxiety and parenting stress also moderated emotion coaching. In mothers with BAP status, stress and parenting stress moderated the relation between negative expressiveness and child <b>problem</b> <b>behaviours.</b> Within the qualitative framework of the study, a thematic analysis revealed that mothers of children with ASD use a number of ES approaches when their children are experiencing negative emotions. Themes consistent with ES practices within typically developing populations emerged, as well as additional themes {{that have not been}} adequately captured in the literature (e. g., socialization that often accommodates children’s behavioural and emotional challenges) and therefore may be more unique to mothers parenting children with ASD. Clinical implications and future directions are discussed...|$|R
