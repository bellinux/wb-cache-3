40|$|Efficient {{allocation}} of shelves in retail {{is essential to}} gain and maintain competitiveness. Shelf Space Allocation Problem (SSAP) {{is an extension of}} the knapsack problem; the objective is determination of the products and their locations on shelves to maximize expected profit. Various factors such as location within the store, <b>product</b> <b>adjacencies</b> and number of facings allocated for that particular product affect profitability of a product. Due to the size and complexity of the problem, metahuristic methods are preferred. This manuscript provides two metaheuristic solution algorithms to the model proposed by Ayhan et al. (2007), which is an extension of the model introduced by Yang (2001). This study has shown that for problems of various sizes both Tabu Search (TS) and Genetic Algorithm (GA) can provide better solutions than the greedy algorithm proposed by Ayhan et al...|$|E
40|$|U. S. Food Retailing has {{undergone}} tremendous structural and marketing {{change in the}} past decade. Marketers of consumer goods are increasingly competitive in gaining {{the attention of a}} more time-starved, demanding, buyer savvy consumer. As a result of these and other macro changes in the marketing environment, retailers have been forced to add, delete, modify, or create new techniques to deliver their products. More specifically, in the channels of grocery, drug, and mass retailing, manufacturers and retailers alike are in constant search of the "store design of the future" that will generate consumer excitement and sustain and increase sales. This foundation study investigates specific changes in marketing and structural techniques in these three channels of trade from 19871997. The research methodology employed was that of secondary data collection, analysis, and synthesis. Insight gained from examples and anecdotes taken in sum across these three channels formed the basic trends identified in each channel. From this point, possible conclusions and implications for the future were drawn. These possible outcomes and predictions were tested against a number of retail executives at the Food Marketing Institute in May of 1998. Following expert advice, final predictions for the store design of the next five years were outlined and summarized. Main results of this foundation study are best summarized in the three channels discussed. First in the grocery trade trends driving the past ten years include: grocery store numbers in steep decline, store openings and remodeling continue, hiring and retaining quality employees a challenge, home meal replacement dominates landscape, store-within-a-store designs are popular, grocery store operators need food service expertise, consumer direct an area of investigation, centerof-store is concern spot, and loyalty marketing on the rise. As a result of analysis and discussion, conclusions for the future include: store-within-a-store dominates grocery retailing, an "inversion" of the store draws attention to prepared foods, a movement of physical locations will better serve a busy consumer, more alliances and partnerships to improve efficiencies and deliver appropriate products, innovation imperative, consumer direct remains uncertain. In the drug store retail arena the following trends were identified: total stores in decline, sales in precipitous increase, consolidation dominates, convenience is critical, professional health care is a differentiation point, pharmacies work on "warmth", stores are easier to navigate, front end merchandise gains prominence, store-within-a-store designs on rise, home health care becomes a key deliverable. These trends combined with market forces lead to the following trends over the next five years: product diversification is critical to long term sustainability, consolidations continues in dramatic fashion in next five years, "me-too" retailing is severely punished by demanding consumers, customer convenience drives store layout, Home Health Care and Wellness dominates all departments. Finally trends identified in mass retailing include: explosive growth in terms of area and store numbers, a plethora of store formats dot the landscape, convenience again drives layout, store-within-a-store designs gain more popularity, foodservice becomes an increasingly important business. Projections {{for the next five years}} in mass retailing include: a continued rising interest from consumers to have food in mass retail stores, <b>product</b> <b>adjacencies</b> and bundling key to meeting customer convenience, stores will become more simple in layout, higher margin products will drive profitability, and unique mass retailers will find their own niche in market. These conclusions provide a solid foundation from which to frame discussion of the consumer retailing marketplace. It is recommended that primary data studies be conducted to confirm and/or modify these implications and predictions. These studies should be conducted on regular basis to gain a complete understanding of this rapidly evolving environment...|$|E

40|$|Lake of the Woods (LoW) is an {{international}} (USA/Canada) inland water body under significant water quality pressures from recurring cyanobacteria blooms. Its remote location combined with the hydrologically complex nature of its waters makes adequate in situ monitoring of the lake difficult. This work aimed to test the potential of Envisat’s Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) full-res-olution imagery for monitoring algal blooms in the lake. A full assessment of MERIS L 1 and L 2 chlorophyll and chlorophyll-related products was carried out over LoW during an intense surface algal bloom in September 2009. The Case 2 regional model and fluorescence line height/maximum chlorophyll index (MCI) plug-ins for BEAM were assessed {{for their ability to}} accurately distinguish the bloom. Results suggest that none of the Case- 2 -specific algorithms effectively extract chlorophyll concentrations over LoW, whereas the greatest potential is seen within the MCI <b>product.</b> <b>Adjacency</b> effects in near-shore waters are shown to be signifi-cant, although the improved contrast between ocean and land processor (ICOL) does not appear to notably improve water constituent retrievals in these waters. Images of L 2 MCI are shown to adequately identify the bloom and are used to track the evolution of the bloom across the lake. Evidence is presented for the effects of variable depth distributions of cyanobacteria on the surface signal seen by the sensor; imagery suggests that day-to-day variations in wind-induced mixing have a profound impact on surface algal biomass as detected by remote sensing...|$|R

In particular, we show that the format of Boldi and Vigna allows computing the product in time proportional to the compressed graph size. Our experimental results show speedups of at least 2 on graphs that were compressed at least 5 times with respect to the original. We show that other successful graph compression formats enjoy this property as well...|$|R
40|$|We {{introduce}} a new matrix product, that we call the wreath product of matrices. The name is inspired by the analogous product for graphs, and the following important correspondence is proven: the wreath <b>product</b> of the <b>adjacency</b> matrices of two graphs provides the adjacency matrix of the wreath product of the graphs. This correspondence is exploited in order to study the spectral properties of the famous Lamplighter random walk: the spectrum is explicitly determined for the "Walk or switch" model on a complete graph of any size, with two lamp colors. The investigation of the spectrum of the matrix wreath product is actually developed for the more general case where the second factor is a circulant matrix. Finally, an application {{to the study of}} generalized Sylvester matrix equations is treated. Comment: 25 page...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} {{context-aware}} hybrid classification {{system for the}} problem of fine-grained product class recognition in computer vision. Recently, retail product recognition has become an interesting computer vision research topic. We focus on the classification of products on shelves in a store. This is a very challenging classification problem because many product classes are visually similar in terms of shape, color, texture, and metric size. In shelves, same or similar products {{are more likely to}} appear adjacent to each other and displayed in certain arrangements rather than at random. The arrangement of the products on the shelves has a spatial continuity both in brand and metric size. By using this context information, the co-occurrence of the <b>products</b> and the <b>adjacency</b> relations between the products can be statistically modeled. The proposed hybrid approach improves the accuracy of context-free image classifiers such as Support Vector Machines (SVMs), by combining them with a probabilistic graphical model such as Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) or Conditional Random Fields (CRFs). The fundamental goal of this paper is using contextual relationships in retail shelves to improve the classification accuracy by executing a context-aware approach...|$|R
40|$|UnrestrictedMathematical {{modeling}} {{represents one}} of the major tools for the conception and management of the ever increasing complexity of systems engineering. Unfortunately, present approaches to math modeling suffer from several theoretical problems which include: model consistency, computational allowability, management of the topologically complex flow of software algorithms, rearrangement of independent and dependent variables, distinction between the model structure and software programs and perhaps the most challenging, the exponential explosions resulting from the management of even medium sized models as well as the large models of the thousands of dimensions necessary to define and manage the complex systems of the future.; Constraint theory was designed to solve the above problems employing a rigorous application of graph theory and attempts to employ the generalizability of mathematics to extend the math model manager’s conceptual understanding from half a dozen dimensions to the desired thousands of dimensions. Constraint theory (CT) went through several stages of detail and maturity, starting with the PhD dissertation in the 1960 ’s and progressing through several papers and two other PhD research programs. CT’s present frontier can be characterized by the Constraint Theory book written by Dr. George Friedman and published by Springer in 2005.; CT differs from linear programming (LP) in several ways. LP requires a full model of explicit mathematical expressions in linear form whereas CT employs a meta-model based upon relevancy between general (linear or non-linear) relations and variables. CT seeks to determine a model consistency and computational allowability without having to actually solve for a specific solution set whereas LP assumes that the problem is well-posed while attempting to solve for an optimal solution within a given constrained trade space.; As mentioned above, the exponential explosions associated with the management of thousand-dimensional models is truly enormous, on the order of 2 N examinations of a model’s N equations are required to determine consistency, for example. CT has converged this process – which would take several universe lifetimes even with nanosecond computer cycle times – by a factor of trillions. This convergence is based on an ordered series of graph theoretic steps involving connected-ness, tree-ness, circuit-ness and cluster-ness. A constraint theoretic structure called the “Basic Nodal Square” (BNS) is identified as the kernel of constraint in a math model. An n × n BNS is essentially a complete sub-system of n relations and n variables within the overall model. However, Friedman’s book effectively stops at the identification of circuit clusters of approximately 30 relations, and suggests that BNS within these clusters can be found by modern computers in a few hours. It is suggested that perhaps more research can employ the topological property of adjacency to converge the search for BNS within larger circuit clusters.; The central contribution resultant from this investigation realizes and improves the computational efficiency of BNS search by factors of trillions, asymptotically (see Figure 10 - 2). This improvement has been accomplished by innovative application of graph theory, topology, algorithm analysis and linear algebra, which were not addressed to sufficient depth in the original efforts. Leveraging research results in graph theory since the early 1970 ’s, several BNS search methods, based on nodal adjacency, circuit adjacency and nodal degree, have been developed and compared against the baseline (brute-force) approach of 2 N. Primary key research findings and enablers include:; a. Decomposition of a model graph into its connected components by employing the graph-theoretic concept of a spanning tree and applying the depth-first search algorithm. [...] b. Innovation of the edge-centric method, over the legacy approach of vertex-centricity, to identify, and remove, internal trees (or bridges) within a connected component. [...] c. Further isolation of circuit clusters containing potential BNS by using the graph-theoretic concept of articulation point (or separating vertex). [...] d. Rigorous proof of circuit vector-based theorems to simplify the computational complexity of constructing unions of adjacent circuits, and thus reduce BNS search space. [...] e. Application of vectorial dot <b>product</b> to detect <b>adjacency</b> among circuits, and overlapping among nodes or BNSs. [...] f. Development and demonstration of a meta-meta-model graph to represent overlapping among nodes and to reduce the solution-time for BNS search, from exponential to polynomial.; Additional accomplishments further improve the utility of CT by developing an integrated set of efficient computing algorithms to determine model consistency and computational allowability. The output of these algorithms can also advise the model builder of repair alternatives to correct any model inconsistency detected. Such algorithms are necessary {{to bridge the gap between}} theoretical abstracts and practical realization of CT in terms of an effective computer-assisted tool for math model management...|$|R

Os resultados da pesquisa mostram que as intera????es apresentam uma macroorganiza????o estruturada em cinco atividades chave (ZIMMERMAN, 1984; 1992), sequencialmente negociadas: 1) abertura/identifica????o/alinhamento; 2) solicita????o; 3) sequ??ncia interrogativa; 4) resposta; e 5) fechamento, em que o grande par {{adjacente}} solicita????o/resposta se constitui na sequ??ncia central do evento. Percebe-se, tamb??m, uma forte orienta????o dos comunicantes para a solicita????o de uma viatura, e dos atendentes, para o envio de uma viatura como o produto final desse par adjacente central e da presta????o de servi??o dos atendimentos do 190. Quando a necessidade do envio de uma viatura ?? posta em d??vida, a rotina das pr??ticas de atender ?? desestabilizada, e o mandato institucional desse servi??o ?? questionado, gerando consequ??ncias interacionais para a conversa em andamento. A an??lise dos dados revela a orienta????o dos comunicantes para suas Categorias de Perten??a (SACKS, 1992; SCHEGLOFF, 1972; SELL; OSTERMANN, 2009) na produ????o de accounts narrativos (DE FINA, 2009) que buscam convencer os atendentes da legitimidade de sua solicita????o de ajuda. Orientados pelo conhecimento socialmente compartilhado do que se constituem em eventos moralmente sancion??veis, ao mesmo tempo em que vitimizam o comunicante, os accounts narrativos produzidos pelos comunicantes constroem uma rela????o de antagonismo entre ele e o seu agressor, o qual ?? responsabilizado pelos fatos reportados. A orienta????o dos participantes para determinadas Categorias de Perten??a tamb??m ?? revelada na formula????o do local para onde a viatura deve ser enviada. O engessamento provocado pelas limita????es do formul??rio eletr??nico de solicita????o de servi??o ?? materializado, por exemplo, na necessidade de informa????o do nome de um logradouro e de um numeral previamente cadastrados no software utilizado. Esse tipo de restri????o imp??e limita????es quanto ?? inser????o de outros formatos de endere??o ??? vigentes na organiza????o social atual, principalmente das camadas sociais menos favorecidas ??? e que divergem do formato padr??o, dificultando, assim, o acesso dessas pessoas ?? seguran??a p??blica. Verificou-se tamb??m que, para a manuten????o da intersubjetividade no atendimento telef??nico do 190, tanto o atendente, quanto o comunicante, precisam estar orientados para o atendimento das demandas impostas pelo software operacional, o que tornou poss??vel compreender que a investiga????o da intersubjetividade nos novos contextos tecnologizados demanda que o pesquisador alargue os campos semi??ticos (C. GOODWIN, 2000) investigados. Da mesma forma, os recursos lingu??stico-interacionais mobilizados pelos comunicantes, ao formularem o local para onde a viatura deve ser enviada, demonstra a sua falta de letramento quanto ??s pr??ticas sociais em quest??o. Esse estudo resultou em um curso de capacita????o de 50 horas/aula para a qualifica????o dos atendimentos telef??nicos desse servi??o de emerg??ncia e na implementa????o de um processo seletivo interno para o ingresso na fun????o de atendente, que tamb??m s??o discutidos no texto. This study analyzes {{two hundred}} telephone emergency calls between callers and call takers at Brigada Militar (190), in Porto Alegre, from an ethnographic (O???REILLY, 2009) perspective {{and based on}} Ethnomethodological Conversation Analysis (GARFINKEL, 1967; SACKS, 1992) and Membership Categorization Analysis principles (SACKS, 1992; SCHEGLOFF, 1972; SELL; OSTERMANN, 2009). The results of this research study show that the interactions present a macrostructure organized into five key activities that are sequentially negotiated (ZIMMERMAN, 1984; 1992) : 1) opening/identification/alignment; 2) request; 3) interrogative sequence; 4) response; and 5) closing, in which the adjacency pair request/response consists of the main sequence of the event. Callers??? strong orientation to the request for a police car and call takers??? orientation to the dispatch of a police car are also identified as the final <b>product</b> of this <b>adjacency</b> pair and of the provision of the service. When {{the need for the}} dispatch of a police car is questioned by a caller, the routine of the practices involved in the processing of the call is destabilized and the institutional mandate of 190 is questioned, and this fact brings in interactional consequences to the flow of the interactions. The analysis of the data reveals callers??? orientation to certain Membership Categories (SACKS, 1992; SCHEGLOFF, 1972; SELL; OSTERMANN, 2009) in the production of narrative accounts (DE FINA, 2009), which aim at convincing call takers of the legitimacy of their requests. Based on the socially shared knowledge of morally loaded events, {{at the same time that}} these narrative accounts victimize the caller, they also build an antagonistic relationship between caller and aggressor ??? with the latter being allegedly responsible for the facts being reported. Participants??? orientations to certain Membership Categories can also be seen in their formulation of the place to where the police car must be dispatched. The limitations imposed by the electronic form is materialized, for instance, in the need to insert the name of a street and a number, which can be retrieved from the database, in the address slot. This restriction limits the insertion of other formats of address ??? which can be found in the current social organization (especially in the less privileged social classes) ??? and which restricts the access of those people to public safety. It was also possible to notice that, the maintenance of intersubjectivity in emergency calls depends on callers??? and call takers??? orientation to meet the demands of the software, and this fact shows that the study of intersubjectity in new, technologized contexts demands that the researcher considers other semiotic fields (C. GOODWIN, 2000) in the investigation. At the same time, the linguistic resources mobilized by the callers when formulating the place where the police car must be sent to displays their illiteracy concerning the social practices of the modern world. This research resulted in a fifty-hour training program to qualify the call-taking services and in the implementation of an internal recruitment process for the position of call taker, which are also discussed in this work...|$|R
