The following day, oil ministers {{agreed to the}} embargo, a cut in production by five percent from September's output and to continue to cut production in five percent monthly increments until their economic and political objectives were met. On October 19, Nixon requested Congress to appropriate $2.2billion in emergency aid to Israel, including $1.5billion in outright grants. George Lenczowski notes, [...] "Military supplies did not exhaust Nixon's eagerness to prevent Israel's collapse...This [...] decision triggered a collective OPEC response." [...] Libya immediately announced it would embargo oil shipments to the United States. Saudi Arabia and the other Arab oil-producing states joined the embargo on October 20, 1973.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{discusses}} {{an alternative}} to the ex <b>post</b> <b>pricing</b> model currently under development within ISO New Eng-land’s (ISO NE) ancillary service market. Since ISO NE’s real-time ancillary service market co-optimizes both energy and reserve products, ex <b>post</b> <b>pricing</b> is needed for both energy and reserve. A co-optimization approach for ex <b>post</b> <b>pricing</b> requires defining com-plex pricing rules and implementing heuristics to ensure consistent binding constraints with the ex ante dispatch. In order to avoid com-plexity and uncertainty of required heuristics, a new ex <b>post</b> <b>pricing</b> schema is proposed to calculate the ex post energy and reserve prices in a decoupled way while recognizing the coupling effect of energy and reserve. In the proposed approach, ex <b>post</b> energy <b>prices</b> are first computed by incorporating the ex ante marginal opportunity cost of reserve in the energy offer; the ex <b>post</b> reserve <b>prices</b> are then calculated by considering the ex post marginal opportunit...|$|R

5000|$|The <b>posted</b> <b>price</b> of oil was {{originally}} the determinant factor {{of the taxes}} that oil companies had to pay. This concept was beneficial to the oil companies {{because they were the}} ones who controlled the posted prices. Companies could increase the actual price of oil without changing the <b>posted</b> <b>price,</b> thus avoiding an increase in taxes paid to the producing country.Oil-producing countries did not realize that the companies were adjusting oil prices until the cost of oil dropped in the late 1950s and companies started reducing posted prices very frequently. [...] The main reason for the reduction in oil prices was the change in the world’s energy situation after 1957 that led to competition between energy sources. Efforts to find markets led to price cuts. Price cutting was first achieved by shaving profit margins, but soon prices were reduced to levels far lower than posted prices as companies producing oil in the Middle East started to offer crude to independent and state-owned refineries.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} contains three chapters. It analyzes {{a market}} where firms can choose {{whether or not}} to publicly <b>post</b> their <b>prices.</b> <b>Price</b> <b>posting</b> rewards a firm by reducing search costs for customers and thus attracting more demand, at the risk of triggering more direct price competition. In the first two chapters, I use a continuous model and a discrete model to discuss possible market equilibria, respectively. In a non-cooperative and dynamic environment, I find that when the supporting information technology becomes available to all firms, a firm wants to <b>post</b> <b>prices</b> only when it has appropriate cost advantage over its competitors. A lower cost of <b>posting</b> <b>prices</b> encourages firms to <b>post</b> their <b>prices.</b> <b>Price</b> <b>posting</b> improves market efficiency unless one firm has too much cost advantage. When a more efficient entrant replaces the incumbent price-posting firm, the incumbent wants to hide its prices again. These results explain why in some markets firms or individual traders hesitate to publicly <b>post</b> their <b>prices</b> and some even impose search costs on their prices. In the third chapter, I use a laboratory experiment to show how a market evolves when firms or individual traders endogenously determine the search costs on their prices. In the experiment, human subjects play sellers and the computer calculates demands and profits, assuming consumers behave optimally. I assign costs and demand parameters to subjects and let them choose both their prices and {{whether or not to}} publicly post them. I alter the production costs, the fixed cost of <b>posting</b> <b>prices,</b> and the possibility of communication among subjects across treatments to show the effect of these factors on market structure. Experimental results show that one is more likely to <b>post</b> <b>prices</b> when he or she has lower unit cost and when the fixed cost of <b>posting</b> <b>prices</b> becomes lower. <b>Price</b> <b>posting</b> lowers effective <b>prices</b> when communication among subjects is not allowed but raises prices when subjects can communicate with each other...|$|R

Key words: affiliation, experimental auctions, <b>posted</b> <b>prices.</b> Experimental auctions have become a pop-ular tool in many branches of economics, including agricultural, environmental, and reg-ulatory economics. Economists have used experimental auctions to examine issues such as the willingness-to-pay/willingness-to-accept disparity (e. g., Kahneman, Knetsch, and Thaler 1990; Shogren et al. 1994; Shogren et al. 2001), the value of information regarding food products (e. g., Huffman et al. 2003; Rousu et al. 2002, 2004), and pricing in electricity markets (e. g., Abbink, Brandts, and McDaniel 2003). Repeated trials are now a standard practice in experimental auctions. In repeated trial auc-tions participants place bids on the same prod-ucts in multiple potentially binding rounds, and the experimenter posts {{one or more of the}} bid prices after each round. 1 In this article we take a fresh look at whether <b>posted</b> <b>prices</b> affect bids in later rounds.

40|$|Abstract. Consumer auctions {{were very}} popular {{in the early days}} of {{internet}} commerce, but today online sellers mostly use <b>posted</b> <b>prices.</b> Data from eBay shows that compositional shifts in the items being sold, or the sellers offering these items, cannot account for this evolution. Instead, the returns to sellers using auctions have diminished. We develop a model to distinguish two hypotheses: a shift in buyer demand away from auctions, and general narrowing of seller margins that favors <b>posted</b> <b>prices.</b> Our estimates suggest that the former is more important. We also provide evidence on where auctions still are used, and on why some sellers may continue to use both auctions and <b>posted</b> <b>prices.</b> We are grateful to Pat Bajari, Preston McAfee and many seminar participants for helpful comments...|$|R

When the proportion of haggling consumers goes up, prices tend to rise.|$|E

Its taxable profit was therefore correspondingly greater than had been declared by Europa, and its taxable income was therefore increased accordingly for all the tax years 1959-1965.

50|$|In {{a series}} of {{controlled}} laboratory experiments, Klaus M.
