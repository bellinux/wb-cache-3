5000|$|There {{is a vast}} {{academic}} literature {{on the impact of}} cross-listings on the value of the cross-listed firms. Most studies (for example, Miller, 1999) find that a cross-listing on a U.S. stock market by a non-U.S. firm is associated with a significantly positive stock <b>price</b> <b>reaction</b> in the home market. This finding suggests that the stock market expects the cross-listing to {{have a positive impact on}} firm value. Doidge, Karolyi, and Stulz (2004) show that companies with a cross-listing in the United States have a higher valuation than non-cross-listed corporations, especially for firms with high growth opportunities domiciled in countries with relatively weak investor protection. The premium they find is larger for companies listed at official US stock exchanges (Level II and III ADR programs) than for over-the-counter listings (Level I ADR program) and private placements (Rule 144A ADR’s). Doidge, Karolyi, and Stulz (2004) argue that a cross-listing in the United States reduces the extent to which controlling shareholders can engage in expropriation (through [...] "bonding" [...] to the high corporate governance standards in the United States) and thereby increases the firm’s ability to take advantage of growth opportunities. Recent research, shows that the listing premium for crosslisting has evaporated, due to new U.S. regulations and competition from other exchanges. Some recent academic research finds that smaller foreign firms seeking cross listing venues may be opting for UK exchanges over U.S. exchanges due to the costs imposed by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. On the other hand, larger firms seeking [...] "bonding" [...] benefits from a U.S. listing continue to seek a U.S. exchange listing. There are also studies, however, such as Sarkissian and Schill (2009), who argue that cross-listings do not create long-term valuation benefits.|$|E

This model constitutes an improvement over previous theories of convertible debt that consider these stock <b>price</b> <b>reactions</b> separately and neglect the possibility of agency conflicts.

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} impact of three {{corporate}} events on corporate bond prices in the U. S. Specifically, the first empirical essay examines whether bond <b>prices</b> exhibit delayed <b>reactions</b> to earnings announcements. The second essay examines whether bond prices react to equity analysts’ recommendation revisions and the third essay examines whether bond prices react to unexpected dividend changes. The results from the first essay show that the bond <b>price</b> <b>reactions</b> to earnings news are asymmetric, with greater reactions following negative earnings surprises than following positive earnings surprises. This {{is consistent with the}} Black–Scholes (1973) bond pricing model. Bond <b>price</b> <b>reactions</b> are also reported to be affected by bond risk. Because issuers of riskier bonds are more likely to face default, earnings news is reported to be more pertinent to the value of riskier bonds. The second essay reports similar asymmetric bond <b>price</b> <b>reactions.</b> The bond <b>price</b> <b>reactions</b> appear to be directed more towards recommendation downgrades than towards upgrades. In addition, riskier bonds tend to exhibit stronger reactions to recommendation revisions than safer bonds do. The third essay documents significant and negative bond <b>price</b> <b>reactions</b> to dividend cuts and the significant reactions of speculative-grade (riskier) bonds to dividend changes. The bond price changes are {{in the same direction as}} the dividend changes are, which supports the dividend information content hypothesis rather than the wealth expropriation hypothesis, which would predict opposite bond <b>price</b> <b>reactions...</b>|$|R

50|$|The {{ability to}} prevent {{shareholders}} or managers to acquire private benefits from their firms {{is an important}} aspect of corporate governance since it represents an important source of potential conflict with public shareholders. After all the rationale of raising external capital must be towards that it must be raised only after management's commitment to return this capital to investors and not to extract it for the controlling shareholders' personal use (Karolyi, 2006). Stulz (1999) as cited in Karolyi (2006), placed emphasis on the potential agency conflicts and information asymmetry problems that corporate managers or controlling shareholders would face with public shareholders in their effort to raise external capital. Agency conflicts could arise in the case where the set of actions of corporate managers or controlling shareholders are not aligned with the interests of public shareholders. On the other hand, information problems may arise if the management of the company, although having good information about future cash flows, is unable to credibly convince investors about the accuracy of these cash flows (Karolyi, 2006). Managers can alter those problems if they choose to bond themselves in a better governance regime by cross-listing in order to commit not to engage in illegal activities and as a result they can increase the firms’ value since they are able to raise external capital. Consequently, cross border listing effectively improves a company’s corporate governance regime and this particularly true for such companies that come from countries with inadequate supervision and disclosure standards (Karolyi, 2006; Witmer, 2006,Pagano et al., 2002). In addition, firms that decide to list their shares on a more demanding exchange in terms of disclosure and corporate governance standards enjoy a better post listing profitability than those that cross list in other exchanges. Karolyi (1998) as cited in Pagano et al. (1999), after surveying several number of studies showed that the <b>price</b> <b>reaction</b> is significant for foreign listings in the US which is the country with the highest disclosure standards, whereas it is insignificant otherwise.|$|E

Therefore, foreign plant closing announcements should produce a smaller stock price decline that domestic plant closing announcements.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY The agricultural industry often asks, “What effects will the publishing of agricultural statistics have on the market of our product? ” Markets of agricultural commodities that involve {{a great deal of}} speculation have especially wondered about this. In response, the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) publishes two reports (<b>Price</b> <b>Reactions</b> After USDA Crop Reports and <b>Price</b> <b>Reactions</b> After USDA Livestock Reports) showing that the <b>price</b> <b>reactions</b> to the official release of certain NASS publications tend to even out over time.
