40|$|Background: The {{transcription}} factor Nrf 2, encoded by the NFE 2 L 2 gene, {{is an important}} regulator of the cellular protection against oxidative stress. <b>Parkinson</b> <b>s</b> disease is a neurodegenerative disease highly associated with oxidative stress. In a previously published study, we reported associations of NFE 2 L 2 haplotypes with risk and age at onset of idiopathic <b>Parkinson</b> <b>s</b> disease in a Swedish discovery material and a Polish replication material. Here, we have extended the replication study and performed meta-analyses including the Polish material and four new independent European patient-control materials. Furthermore, all SNPs included in the haplotype windows were investigated individually for associations with <b>Parkinson</b> <b>s</b> disease in meta-analyses including all six materials. Methods: Totally 1038 patients and 1600 control subjects were studied. Based on previous NFE 2 L 2 haplotype associations with <b>Parkinson</b> <b>s</b> disease, five NFE 2 L 2 tag SNPs were genotyped by allelic discrimination and three functional NFE 2 L 2 promoter SNPs were genotyped by sequencing. The impact of individual SNPs and haplotypes on risk and age at onset of <b>Parkinson</b> <b>s</b> disease were investigated in each material individually and in meta-analyses of the obtained results. Results: Meta-analyses of NFE 2 L 2 haplotypes showed association of haplotype GAGCAAAA, including the fully functional promoter haplotype AGC, with decreased risk (OR = 0. 8 per allele, p = 0. 012) and delayed onset (+ 1. 1 years per allele, p = 0. 048) of <b>Parkinson</b> <b>s</b> disease. These results support the previously observed protective effect of this haplotype in the first study. Further, meta-analyses of the SNPs included in the haplotypes revealed four NFE 2 L 2 SNPs associated with age at onset of <b>Parkinson</b> <b>s</b> disease (rs 7557529 G > A, - 1. 0 years per allele, p = 0. 042; rs 35652124 A > G, - 1. 1 years per allele, p = 0. 045; rs 2886161 A > G, - 1. 2 years per allele, p = 0. 021; rs 1806649 G > A, + 1. 2 years per allele, p = 0. 029). One of these (rs 35652124) is a functional SNP located in the NFE 2 L 2 promoter. No individual SNP was associated with risk of <b>Parkinson</b> <b>s</b> disease. Conclusion: Our results {{support the hypothesis that}} variation in the NFE 2 L 2 gene, encoding a central protein in the cellular protection against oxidative stress, may contribute to the pathogenesis of <b>Parkinson</b> <b>s</b> disease. Functional studies are now needed to explore these results further...|$|R

40|$|This study {{consists}} of two parts: first, the thesis with a general theoretical overview of the topic. Second, the draft paper Impulsivity and impulse control disorders in <b>Parkinson</b> <b>s</b> disease – A pilot study of assessment instruments in a clinic. The purpose of this work has been {{to contribute to the}} awareness of ICDs as a potential problem in <b>Parkinson</b> <b>s</b> disease (PD), and to investigate possible tools and their utility to assess this problem in a specialised neurologic policlinic in Norway. In the pilot study we translated the Questionnaire for Impulse-Compulsive Disorders in <b>Parkinson</b> <b>s</b> Disease (QUIP) and the Barrat Impulsiveness Scale (BIS- 11) to Norwegian and administered them to a convenience sample of PD patients. Statistical analyses was undertaken with SPSS version 15. 0. The analyses showed comparable numbers of ICDs in our sample of patients compared with previous findings and we found a significant correlation between the presence of an ICD and the degree of impulsivity. This study emphasizes the need for an increased awareness about ICDs and other compulsive disorders in <b>Parkinson</b> <b>s</b> disease as a possible side effect of their medication. The sensitive nature of these disorders requires a systematic and cautious approach, although an appreciation of their presence in a process of normalization seems equally important. Even though the pilot study was done on a small population after convenience sample our findings support previous studies that encourage clinicians to do routine testing for ICDs and other compulsive behaviours in PD patients...|$|R
40|$|Objective – a {{description}} of clinical cases of impulsive­compulsive disorders in <b>Parkinson,</b> <b>s</b> disease. The first clinical case. Patient N., 75 years old, suffering for 15 years from <b>Parkinson,</b> <b>s</b> disease, akinetic­rigid form of the disease, stage 4 by Hyun–Yar. Since 2009, he received levodopa/carbidopa 250 / 25 mg 5 times/day (daily dose of 1250 mg of levodopa); pramipexole 3. 5 mg per day (daily dose 3. 5 mg), amantadine sulfate 100 mg 5 times/day (daily dose 500 mg). While taking antiparkinsonian drugs the patient developed behavioral disorders such as dopamine disregulatory syndrome combined with punding, hypersexuality and compulsive shopping accompanied by visual hallucinations. The total equivalent dose of levodopa was 1600 mg per day. The second clinical case. Patient R., 52 years old, suffers from <b>Parkinson,</b> <b>s</b> disease about 5 years, a mixed form. She complained of slowness of movement, tremor in her left hand, sleep disturbances, poor mood. The clinic was appointed piribedil 50 mg 3 times per day. Despite {{the fact that the}} patient took only one of dopaminergic drugs in a therapeutic daily dose, she developed impulsive­compulsive disorder as hyper­ sexuality, compulsive shopping and binge eating.   Results. In the first clinical case for correction of behavioral disorders in patients with <b>Parkinson,</b> <b>s</b> disease levodopa/carbidopa dose was reduced to 750 mg per day (3 / 4 Tab. 4 times a day); added to levodopa/benserazide dispersible 100 mg morning and levodopa/benserazide 100 mg before sleep (total dose of levodopa of 950 mg per day). Amantadine sulfate and pramipexole were canceled. It was added to the therapy of atypical neuroleptic clozapine dose 6, 25 mg overnight. After 3 months marked improvement, regressed visual hallucina­ tions, improved family relationships, background mood became more stable. The patient continue to sing karaoke, but this hobby has be­ come less intrusive.   In the second clinical event correction impulsive­compulsive disorders piribedil was replaced with pramipexole 1. 5 mg prolonged form one time a day. At the control examination after 3 months behavioral disorders completely regressed. Conclusion.

ABSTRACT: The doctoral thesis deals with diagnosing communication disability for people with <b>Parkinson</b> <b>s</b> disease (PD). PD is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder associated with high occurrence of hypokinetic dysarthria (HD). The theoretical part of the thesis characterizes <b>Parkinson</b> <b>s</b> disease, weak and strong points of logopaedic diagnostics and describes HD. The empirical part of the thesis is based on quantitative research. The aims of our study were to modify test Dysarthric profile 3 F {{to be more sensitive}} to mild stage of HD, to detect HD symptoms in early untreated PD patiens, to notice HD progression in retest, to objectify results of clinical evaluation by acoustic measurments and to detect subjective perception of patient s own speech. We studied people with PD and neurologically healthy control speakers. We evaluated HD in 50 % PD subjects in early untreated stage of PD and in 74 % PD speakers in retest. We observe that between the most sensitive diagnostical tasks in clinical evaluation with high correlation with acoustic analysis belong evaluation of hoarse voice in sustained phonation of vowels and [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Mesencephalic {{dopamine}} (mesDA) neurons degenerate {{in patients}} with <b>Parkinson</b> <b>s</b> disease. In order to develop new treatment strategies for rescuing or replacing degenerating mesDA neurons, an improved understanding of the development and survival of these neurons in the normal brain is required. In paper I we identify two key players, Lmx 1 a and Msx 1, implicated in the specification of mesDA neurons. Lmx 1 a and Msx 1 are important for ensuring the correct mesDA neuron differentiation cascade by suppressing alternative cell fates, promoting neurogenesis and inducing the generation of mesDA neurons. In papers I and II we provide evidence that over-expression of Lmx 1 a both in mouse and human embryonic stem cells leads to an efficient generation of authentic mesDA neurons. These in vitro engineered mesDA neurons might, in the future, {{be used as a}} cell source in cell replacement therapy for patients with <b>Parkinson</b> <b>s</b> disease. However, to ensure a safe treatment, the use of embryonic stem cells depends on avoiding adverse effects such as uncontrolled cell growth. In papers II and III we show that an enrichment for embryonic stem cellderived progenitor cells or mature neurons, prior to grafting, removes unwanted dividing cells. Moreover, a higher number of mesDA neurons are present in the grafts after transplantation of sorted neurons, compared to progenitor cells. In paper IV, we show that ligands for the retinoic X receptor are present in the mesDA neuron domain in vivo, and that they mediate neuronal survival in primary mesDA neurons expressing both Nurr 1 and the retinoic X receptor. These factors might be of interest as a potential treatment strategy to enhance survival of endogenous or transplanted mesDA neurons for patients with <b>Parkinson</b> <b>s</b> disease. The work presented in this thesis has increased the knowledge concerning the development of mesDA neurons and has helped to establish a protocol enabling the production of highly purified mesDA neurons. This knowledge can facilitate the establishment of new therapies for patients with <b>Parkinson</b> <b>s</b> disease, be a useful tool in drug screenings and help to identify additional factors important for the development, survival and maintenance of the mesDA system...|$|R
40|$|Dopamine is {{fundamental}} in human behavior for movement, cognition and reward. A dysfunctional dopamine system is implicated in several neurological and psychiatric {{disorders such as}} <b>Parkinson</b> <b>s</b> disease and schizophrenia. Dopamine mediates its effects through five receptors. Dopamine D 2 receptors are well studied and successful drug targets {{in the treatment of}} <b>Parkinson</b> <b>s</b> disease and schizophrenia. The functional role of dopamine D 1 receptors is not fully understood and the clinical potential remains elusive. In the present thesis, full dopamine D 1 receptor agonists were used to characterize the functional roles of these dopamine receptor subtypes. A number of aspects of psychomotor activation relevant for <b>Parkinson</b> <b>s</b> disease and schizophrenia were examined with the full dopamine D 1 receptor agonists dihydrexidine and A 68930. Stimulation of dopamine D 1 receptors by dihydrexidine and A 68930 resulted in inhibition of locomotor activity in rats exploring an open-field. In habituated animals, with a low baseline activity, as well as in dopamine depleted rats, no locomotor activation was evident following dopamine D 1 receptor stimulation. The results suggest inhibitory actions of dopamine D 1 receptors in psychomotor activation. In fact, dihydrexidine and A 68930 blocked amphetamine-induced hyperactivity, a traditional sign of antipsychotic action. A possible site of action for the effects of dihydrexidine and A 68930 is stimulation of prefrontal dopamine D 1 receptors, as indexed by neuronal activation (c-fos). A different approach to examine dopamine D 1 receptor agonism was used with clozapine that previously has been shown to possess dopamine D 1 receptor agonist properties in vivo. Clozapine does not cause extrapyramidal side effects and can be used in drug-induced psychosis in <b>Parkinson</b> <b>s</b> disease. Two new atypical antipsychotics, olanzapine and quetiapine, that both have a similar pharamacological profile to clozapine, were compared with clozapine on drug-induced catalepsy. In contrast to olanzapine and quetiapine, clozapine blocked catalepsy. It is concluded that the pharmacological profile of clozapine differs from olanzapine and quetiapine, a finding that possibly can be explained by dopamine D 1 receptor agonism as a feature of clozapine. Whether the inhibition of psychomotor activity by dihydrexidine and A 68930 reside in specific D 1 or D 5 receptor stimulation is not known. In an attempt to functionally separate dopamine D 1 and D 5 receptor function, siRNA for induction of RNA interference (RNAi) was used to specifically knock-down D 1 receptors. Despite high efficacy in an in vitro system, no receptor knockdown was obtained in rodent brain with siRNA. The results suggest that a refinement of the RNAi technology is needed before functional studies in vivo is possible. The present thesis suggests important functional roles of brain dopamine D 1 receptors that may have relevance for schizophrenia and <b>Parkinson</b> <b>s</b> disease. A particularly interesting finding is an inhibitory role of prefrontal dopamine D 1 receptors on psychomotor activation, a finding that may have clinical implications in the treatment of schizophrenia...|$|R
40|$|Background Recent {{quantitative}} neuroimaging {{studies have}} been successful in capturing phenotype and genotype-speci fi c changes in dementia syndromes, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, <b>Parkinson</b> ? <b>s</b> disease and other neurodegenerative conditions. However, the majority of imaging studies are cross-sectional, despite the obvious superiority of longitudinal study designs in characterising disease trajectories, response to therapy, progression rates and evaluating the presymptomatic phase of neurodegenerative conditions. Objectives The aim of this work is to perform a systematic review of longitudinal imaging initiatives in neurodegeneration focusing on methodology, optimal statistical models, follow-up intervals, attrition rates, primary study outcomes and presymptomatic studies. Methods Longitudinal imaging studies were identi fi ed from ? PubMed ? and reviewed from 1990 to 2014. The search terms ? longitudinal ?, ? MRI ?, ? presymptomatic ? and ? imaging ? were utilised in combination with one of the following degenerative conditions; Alzheimer ? s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/motor neuron disease, frontotemporal dementia, Huntington ? s disease, multiple sclerosis, <b>Parkinson</b> ? <b>s</b> disease, ataxia, HIV, alcohol abuse/ dependence. Results A total of 423 longitudinal imaging papers and 103 genotype-based presymptomatic studies were identi fi ed and systematically reviewed. Imaging techniques, follow-up intervals and attrition rates showed signi fi cant variation depending on the primary diagnosis. Commonly used statistical models included analysis of annualised percentage change, mixed and random effect models, and non-linear cumulative models with acceleration ? deceleration components.

40|$|Acquired color {{deficiency}} in the tritan axis in Parkinson’s disease {{has already been}} reported, manifesting itself as impaired performance in various visual tasks. However, its clinical significance has always been controversial. In this study we evaluated the performance of <b>Parkinson</b> <b>s</b> disease patients in Lanthony 15 -desaturated clinical test {{and for the first}} time, compared it with the standard Farnsworth-Munsell 15 -dichotomous test, {{in order to determine the}} clinical value of the color vision {{deficiency in}} these shorter tests and their relationship with other factors such as age, duration and severity of the disease, and the presence of signs and symptoms of depression and hallucinations. This blind case-control study was performed on 39 definitely diagnosed patients (of which 14 patients were excluded because of confounding variables) and 25 sex and age-adjusted controls in a neurologic referral center. The subjects were selected by consecutive sampling. Eleven patients in Farnsworth-Munsell and 3 patients in Lanthony showed normal function, however, overall patients had significantly weaker performance than controls (P-value= 0. 003 and 0. 000 for FM and Lanthony respectively). The pattern of responses in Lanthony was consistent with a mild tritanomalia and had a significant correlation with the severity of motor signs and symptoms (Spearman coefficient= 0. 44, P-value= 0. 027). The weaker correlation of color deficiency with age in patients (Spearman coefficient= 0. 42) in comparison with controls (Spearman coefficient= 0. 60) also signifies the role of the pathophysiology of the disease. We concluded that color deficiency is a clinically significant visual dysfunction in patients with <b>Parkinson</b> <b>s</b> disease...|$|R

A gene therapy approach, aimed at restoring dopamine synthesis in the affected brain by viral vector delivery of genes that encode the dopamine-synthesizing enzymes, may offer a solution to this problem.

They overcome the ethical issues inherent to the use of human fetal tissue or embryonic stem cells.

Aim: To explore Parkinson disease patient features associated with a greater burden among their caregivers. Material ana Methods: Fifty one patients with Parkinson disease (aged 67 ± 12 years, 29 men, with 8 ± 5 years of disease) and their caregivers, were studied. Patients were assessed with the Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale III, the Hoehn & Yahr stage standardization, <b>Parkinson</b> <b>s</b> minimental test, the neurop-sychiatric inventory and the Beck Depression Inventory (IDB). The Zarit Burden Interview (ESZ) was applied to caregivers. Results: According to IDB, 45 % of patients whose caregiverspresented little or no burden had a depression, compared to 78 % of those whose caregivers had modérate or intense burden. (p < 0. 01). The ESZ score of caregivers correlated significantly with Parkinson patients' age, IDB and axial involvement in the UPDRS-III (correlation coefficients ofOAp < 0. 01, 0. 6 p < 0. 01 and 0. 46 p < 0. 01, respectively).

40|$|Background: The Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale 21 (DASS- 21) is a {{frequently}} used measure of emotional disturbance symptoms in <b>Parkinson</b> <b>s</b> disease (PD). However, {{the factor structure}} of the DASS- 21 in PD has yet to be explored. Objective: To assess whether the scale is measuring these symptoms in PD {{in the same way as}} the general population. Methods: The present study fit a series of established DASS- 21 factor structures with both confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and exploratory structural equation modelling (ESEM) using data from 251 participants with PD. Results: The 3 -factor ESEM provided the best fit. The depression and stress scales fit well, however, few items on the anxiety subscale loaded clearly, with several items significantly loading onto the depression or stress factors. Conclusions: Whilst the depression and stress subscales appear suitable in PD, poor loadings and internal consistency indicate the anxiety subscale may not accurately assess anxiety symptomology in PD. This may be due to the scale s reliance on physiological symptoms as indicators of anxiety, when many of these are present in PD. Thus, the anxiety subscale of the DASS- 21 may not be a suitable measure of anxiety in PD...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Normal {{cellular}} metabolism generates {{reactive oxygen species}} which interact with DNA, lipids and proteins in cells. Cellular damage due to oxidative stress is proposed {{to contribute to the}} pathophysiology of cancer, neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer <b>s</b> and <b>Parkinson</b> <b>s</b> and to the process of aging. The central nervous system is thought to be particularly susceptible to oxidative stress due to the high rate of oxygen consumption. Base excision DNA repair (BER) is the major pathway that removes oxidative DNA base lesions. Among hundreds of lesions, 7, 8 -dihydro- 8 -oxoguanine (8 -oxoG) is believed {{to be one of the}} most important oxidized lesions due to their relatively high incidence and their miscoding properties. OGG 1 (8 -oxoguanine DNA glycosylase- 1) is one of the main DNA glycosylases present in mammalian cells that removes 7, 8 -dihydro- 8 -oxoguanine (8 -oxoG) lesions.

40|$|Patients with Parkinson's disease fail {{to fully}} profit from advance {{information}} about a target's movement in tracking tasks, possibly indicating deficient anticipation of the target's movement. Time estimation has been claimed to be deficient in Parkinson's disease. On the background of these studies, we tested the hypothesis that motion imagery is impaired in Parkinson's disease. Eleven non-demented patients with <b>Parkinson</b> <b>s</b> disease and nine age-matched controls participated in experiments testing their ability to anticipate trajectories of moving points (prediction whether two moving points would crash or not) and to estimate the time needed for completion of an invisible target's movement (a point moving around a circle). In addition, mirror drawing, a task involving motor learning and adjustment of movement to incongruent visual feedback, was tested. The Parkinson's disease patients, who failed to improve on mirror drawing, were not impaired on the imagery tasks: they estimated movement time and predicted trajectories with equal precision as the controls. Motion imagery thus appears to be intact in Parkinson's disease. However, Parkinson's disease patients did not accelerate their predictions of trajectories with practice {{as fast as the}} controls, a deficit which may be interpreted in terms of the fronto-striatal dysfunction repeatedly demonstrated in Parkinson's disease...|$|R
40|$|AIMS: To {{review the}} role played by the {{mitochondrial}} permeability transition pore (MPTP) in different physiological and pathological processes. METHOD: Both genetic and functional alterations in mitochondria can lead to errors that trigger programmed cell death, which in turn give rise to a number of diseases that affect the nervous system. Over the last few years the mitochondrion has been seen as the link between the different signalling pathways involved in some degenerative processes. The mitochondrion seems to play an important part in the cellular decision making that leads, irreversibly, toward the execution phase in cellular death processes. This being the case, the action would be mediated by the permeability of its membranes, through the formation of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore, and would involve phenomena such as the dissipation of the mitochondrial electrochemical potential and the release of substances from within it. These substances include apoptosis inducing factor (AIF), apoptosis protease activating factor 1 (apaf 1), cytochrome c and members of the protease family: the caspases. These alterations have been described in neurodegenerative pathologies such as Alzheimer <b>s</b> and <b>Parkinson</b> <b>s</b> disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and transmissible spongiform encephalopaties. CONCLUSIONS: Designing pharmaceutical products capable of interfering with the functions of MPTP would allow a better therapeutic approach in neurological pathologies...|$|R

Furthermore, concepts for protective shielding also pose a technically challenging issue {{due to the nature}} of cosmic radiation and current mass and power constraints with modern exploration technology. As biological damage from exposure is associated with increased oxidative stress, it would be enabling to mitigate and/or prevent stress prior to the development of clinical symptoms and disease. This paper hypothesizes a "systems biology" approach in which a combination of chemical and biological mitigation techniques are used conjunctively. It proposes using new, therapeutic, medical gases as both chemical radioprotectors for radical scavenging and biological promoters for management of the body s response to exposure. From reviewing radiochemistry of water, biological effects of CO, H 2, NO, and H 2 S gas, and mechanisms of radiation biology, it is concluded that this approach may have great therapeutic potential for exposure. Furthermore, it also appears to have potential for curtailing the pathogenesis of other diseases in which oxidative stress has been implicated including cardiovascular disease, cancer, chronic inflammatory disease, hypertension, ischemia/reperfusion injury, acute respiratory distress syndrome, <b>Parkinson</b> <b>s</b> and Alzheimer s disease, cataracts, and aging...|$|R
40|$|A {{simple and}} fast method with high {{reliability}} {{is necessary for}} the identification of mutations, polymorphisms and sequence variants (MPSV) within many genes and many samples, e. g. for clarifying the genetic background of individuals with multifactorial diseases. Here we review our experience with the polymerase chain reaction/single-strand conformation polymorphism (PCR/SSCP) analysis to identify MPSV in a number of genes thought {{to be involved in the}} pathogenesis of multifactorial neurological disorders, including autoimmune diseases like multiple sclerosis (MS) and neurodegenerative disorders like <b>Parkinson</b> <b>s</b> disease (PD). The method is based on the property of the DNA that the electrophoretic mobility of single stranded nucleic acids depends not only on their size but also on their sequence. The target sequences were amplified, digested into fragments ranging from 50 - 240 base pairs (bp), heat-denatured and analysed on native polyacrylamide (PAA) gels of different composition. The analysis of a great number of different PCR products demonstrates that the detection rate of MPSV depends on the fragment lengths, the temperature during electrophoresis and the composition of the gel. In general, the detection of MPSV is neither influenced by their location within the DNA fragment nor by the type of substitution, i. e., transitions or transversions. The standard PCR/SSCP system described here provides high reliability and detection rates. It allows the efficient analysis of a large number of DNA samples and many different genes...|$|R

One objective was to investigate in what state of PD {{we can see the}} greatest benefits with infusion compared with corresponding oral treatment (Sinemet CR).

Methods: We have computed mean absolute error (MAE) and mean squared error (MSE) for the clinical rating from - 3 (severe parkinsonism) to + 3 (severe dyskinesia) as measures of the clinical state over the treatment periods of the study. Standard deviation (SD) of the rating was used as a measure of response fluctuations. Linear regression and visual inspection of graphs were used to estimate relationships between these measures and variables related to disease progression such as years on levodopa (YLD) or unified PD rating scale part II (UPDRS II). Results: We found that MAE for infusion had a strong linear correlation to YLD (r 2 = 0. 80) while the corresponding relation for oral treatment looked more sigmoid, particularly for the more advanced patients (YLD> 18) ...|$|R

40|$|Lewy bodies (LB) {{were first}} {{described}} by Lewy in 1912 [1] as neuronal pale eosinophilic inclusions {{which became a}} pathological hallmark of <b>Parkinson</b> <b>s</b> disease (PD). In his original study, Lewy defined these inclusions as pale eosinophilic cytoplasmic structures, and studies since then have revealed LB to be ubiquitin-, alpha-synuclein-, and parkin-containing inclusions. This suggests that knowledge of the biochemical steps involved in the genesis of LB might disclose a final common pathway which might be responsible for different types of inherited and sporadic parkinsonism. This {{would lead to the}} identification of new therapeutic targets for interfering with disease progression. Although LB were originally described solely in PD, in the last decade these inclusions were described in a spectrum of degenerative disorders ranging from pure movement disorders to dementia. This suggests that common biochemical alterations leading to the formation of intracellular inclusions might underlie various pathological conditions. Consequently, the knowledge of the biochemical steps involved in the formation of neuronal inclusions could represent a key to develop new therapeutic strategies. In recent years it has been possible to develop both in vitro and in vivo neuronal inclusions resembling Lewy bodies. These experimental approaches have ranged from the use of alpha-synuclein transgenic mice to the continuous exposure to a mitochondrial complex I inhibitor.

40|$|The Late Eocene Benkovac Stone Member of the Promina Formation of {{northern}} Dalmatia, Croatia, is a thinly bedded succession of alternating carbonate sandstones and calcareous mudstones, ca. 40 m thick, exposed as a narrow, SE-trending outcrop belt {{near the town}} of Benkovac. This unit occurs in the middle part of the Promina Formation, which is a spectacular calciclastic succession of deposits of late Middle Eocene to Early Oligocene age, about 2000 m thick, showing an upward trasition from deep-marine turbidites to shallow-marine and alluvial deposits. The sheet-like sandstone beds of the Benkovac Stone Member are mainly 1 – 25 cm thick and have been classified into 6 facies and 3 subfacies, differing in stratification or showing various internal sequences of stratification types. The thicker and most common beds show plane-parallel stratification passing upward into hummocky cross-lamination and undulatory to flat parallel lamination (<b>Facies</b> <b>S</b> 1), or consist of only the latter two divisions (<b>Facies</b> <b>S</b> 2). Subordinate beds show convolute stratification (<b>Facies</b> <b>S</b> 3), are amalgamated (<b>Facies</b> <b>S</b> 4), or are homogenized and merely graded (<b>Facies</b> <b>S</b> 6). The thinner beds have more uneven boundaries and show translatory ripple cross-lamination (Subfacies S 5 a), climbing ripple cross-lamination (Subfacies S 5 b) or pinch-and-swell lamination attributed to starved and rolling-grain ripples (Subfacies S 5 c). The intervening mudstone beds (Facies M) are silt-streaked and bioturbated. Trace fossils indicate a combination of Zoophycos and Cruziana ichnofacies. The sedimentary succession was deposited in a microtidal offshore transition zone characterized by muddy “background” sedimentation punctuated by discrete storm events. The observed spectrum of tempestite sandstone beds represents a wide range of storm events, varying in magnitude and in the mode of sand dispersal – from the pure action of oscillatory waves to pure geostrophic currents. The majority of tempestites are attributed to a combination of these two end-member factors, with the geostrophic currents often enhanced by a high load of sediment suspension (density-modified currents). The Benkovac Stone Member is underlain by muddy offshore deposits (Debelo Brdo Member) and covered by sandy to gravelly shoreface deposits (Otavac Member), which in turn pass upwards into braidplain deltaic and alluvial deposits. This regressive succession {{is considered to be a}} parasequence deposited as a highstand systems tract during a gradual, stepwise rise of relative sea level. The thick parasequence consists of progradational and retrogradational sets of much smaller parasequences, the record of which differs markedly in the shoreface and offshore transitional part. The difference is attributed to the underlying contrast in the physical factors controlling the supply of sand to these shallow shelf zones...|$|R
40|$|Background: Being {{a family}} {{caregiver}} {{for a person}} with <b>Parkinson</b> <b>s</b> disease (PD) can negatively impact health and wellbeing, but it appears less clear to what extent caregivers health/social service needs are met. Objective: We explored {{the extent to which}} PD family caregivers experience sufficient access to health/social services, as compared to age-matched controls; and the associations between this and demographic and health-related variables. Methods: A cross-sectional survey of 66 PD family caregivers and 79 age-matched control subjects including the SF- 36 health survey, the Nottingham Health Profile Sleep section (NHP-Sleep), and questions regarding contacts with various health/social related services and whether these were perceived as sufficient. Results: People reporting insufficient access (n = 29) were more often PD family caregivers than controls (83 % vs. 37 %), did more often have a disease of their own (79 % vs. 46 %), and reported poorer health according to the SF- 36 and the NHPSleep. Being a PD family caregiver (OR, 8. 90), reporting more pain (OR, 1. 02) and having an own disease (OR, 3. 46) were independently associated with insufficient health/social service access. Conclusions: Our results imply that those in greatest need for health/social services (i. e., those with poorer health, an own disease, and who are PD family caregivers) are those whose health/social service needs are least met. Larger studies are needed for firmer conclusions and regarding how unmet health/social service needs impacts caregiver health and wellbeing. Health/social service providers should not only focus on patients but also consider their family members needs...|$|R
40|$|The lithostratigrahy and {{sedimentology}} of the fossiliferous Upper Cretaceous strata {{exposed in}} the Gobi Desert of Mongolia at Ukhaa Tolgod are described and mapped on aerial photos. Topographic features are also mapped by plane table and alidade. Five lithologic and sedimentologic facies are described: E- 1, distinctly cross-stratified sandstone with fine structure, interpreted to represent eolian dune deposits; E- 2, vaguely bedded sandstone with cross-stratified concretionary sheets, interpreted to represent eolian dune deposits modified by diagenetic formation of slope-parallel concretionary sheets of pedogenic calcite; S, structureless sandstone lacking concretions or cross-strata, interpreted to represent sandslide deposits generated by mass wasting along the lee slopes; C, conglomerate interpreted to represent basin-margin conglomerates washed into the dune field from adjacent topographic highs; and M, mudstone and siltstone interpreted to represent interdune deposition in ephemeral ponds and lakes. Facies E- 2 and S {{have not been}} reported previously. Eleven stratigraphic sections at various localities within the Ukhaa Tolgod drainage basin are documented. The exposed composite section consists of about 75 m of pale orange sandstones, greenish-brown conglomerates, and brown siltstones that are products of an arid environment. Four schematic cross sections are documented to illustrate the lateral relationships among the five facies. In the Ukhaa Tolgod area, the beds dip about 2. 5 u to the south, away from the nearby Gilbent Range. This structural attitude is interpreted {{to be related to}} the uplift of the Gilbent block along normal faults exposed at the base of the range. The dune-derived sandslides of <b>Facies</b> <b>S</b> contain a rich skeletal fauna of Late Cretaceous dinosaurs, mammals, and lizards. Essentially, all the skeletal remains collected at Ukhaa Tolgod come from <b>Facies</b> <b>S.</b> <b>Facies</b> E- 1 does contain numerous, concave-up depressions in the cross-strata interpreted as vertebrate tracks. Facies E- 2 contains abundant cylindrical structures interpreted as burrows. The strata at Ukhaa Tolgod are referred to the Djadokhta Formation. As seen in the Bayn Dzak Member at Bayn Dzak, facies E- 1, E- 2, S, and M dominate the lower part of the section at Ukhaa Tolgod, with prominent beds of Facies C exposed near the top. Accordingly, the exposures at Ukhaa Tolgod are referred to the Bayn Dzak Member of the Djadokhta Formation. Classic exposures of the Barun Goyot Formation at Khulsan differ in having units of flat-bedded sandstone intercalated with beds of <b>Facies</b> <b>S</b> near the top of the section. To date, over 1, 000 vertebrate skulls and skeletons have been collected from <b>Facies</b> <b>S.</b> Most are preserved as float contained in small calcareous nodules; however, some were found in situ. Many specimens represent either fairly complete skulls or skulls with articulated or associated postcranial skeletons. Based on faunal similarities between Bayn Dzak and Ukhaa Tolgod, the fauna at Ukhaa Tolgod is interpreted to reflect a Campanian age. The rich assemblage of fossils makes Ukhaa Tolgod one of the richest Late Cretaceous vertebrate fossil localities in the world, and the fossils provide unique insights into evolutionary developments of mammals, lizards, and dinosaurs, including birds, less than 10 my before the terminal Cretaceous extinction event...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of a functional central nervous system relies on the generation of distinct neuronal subtypes in a spatially and temporally defined order. The spatial organisation is achieved at early developmental time points when neural progenitor cells encounter fields of secreted morphogenic signalling molecules along the anterioposterior and dorsoventral axes of the embryo. Translation of these gradients into distinct expression patterns of determinant genes leads {{to the establishment of}} molecularly defined progenitor domains, each producing a specific type of neuron. The process of neurogenesis through which progenitor cells differentiate into maturing neurons is tightly regulated. Proneural genes promote neurogenesis, whereas Notch signalling counteracts this activity to ensure a balance between the numbers of progenitor cells and neurons. One of the challenges in the field of developmental neuroscience, and the main subject of this thesis, is to unravel the molecular cascades that underlie the differentiation programmes of distinct types of neurons. In paper I and II we identify key components of the midbrain dopaminergic (mDA) and hindbrain serotonergic (5 -HT) differentiation pathways. mDA and 5 -HT neurons are clinically relevant cell types as the degeneration of mDA cells is the major hallmark of <b>Parkinsons</b> <b>s</b> disease, and dysregulation of 5 -HT homeostasis has been associated with a number of disorders including autism, schizophrenia, and drug addiction. In paper I we propose that the transcription factors Lmx 1 a and Msx 1 / 2 are important for the acquisition of the mDA cell fate by suppressing alternative cell fates, promoting the progression of neurogenesis, and inducing expression of mDA specific marker genes. Moreover, we find that Lmx 1 a has the ability to direct differentiating embryonic stem cells into mDA neurons, an approach that may be instrumental in the {{development of}} cell replacement strategies for the treatment of patients with <b>Parkinson</b> <b>s</b> disease. In Paper II we identify the transcription factor Lmx 1 b as an early postmitotic marker of 5 -HT neurons. We provide evidence that Lmx 1 b acts as an intermediate determinant in the serotonergic differentiation programme downstream of the progenitor marker Nkx 2. 2 but upstream of neurotransmitter expression. In paper III we construct a comprehensive human atlas of the developmental expression of molecules that have previously been implicated in neuronal and glial patterning, specification and differentiation in common model organisms. We find {{that the majority of the}} developmentally important genes found in model organisms show a conserved expression pattern in human suggesting preserved molecular mechanisms, thus validating the use of model organisms to understand human development and disease. Nevertheless, a few deviations were observed, emphasising the importance of such comparisons. In paper IV we investigate the control and functional rationale behind the regional expression of the Notch ligands, Dll 1 and Jag 1, in the developing spinal cord. We find that the patterning genes which govern cell fate determination also delimit the expression of these Notch ligands into distinct progenitor domains. Furthermore, a similar expression control of the Notch-modifying Fringe genes prevents Notch signalling across borders between Dll 1 + and Jag 1 + domains. We surmise that these two levels of signalling regulation ensure a domain specific control of neurogenesis which may be important to make sure that the correct numbers of each neuronal subtype are generated in the developing spinal cord...|$|R
40|$|Neuronal {{apoptosis}} {{is involved}} in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and <b>Parkinson.</b> <b>s</b> disease. An efficient means of preventing {{it remains to be}} found. Some n- 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) such as docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22 : 6 n- 3) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, 20 : 5 n- 3) have been reported to be protective against the neuronal apoptosis and neuronal degeneration seen after spinal cord injury (SCI) [1]. However, it is unclear which kinds of PUFAs have the most potent ability to inhibit neuronal apoptosis and whether the simultaneous treatment of PUFAs inhibits the apoptosis. In the present study, we compared the abilities of various n- 3 - and n- 6 - PUFAs to inhibit the apoptosis induced after the administration of different apoptotic inducers, etoposide, okadaic acid, and AraC, in mouse neuroblastoma cells (Neuro 2 a). Preincubation with DHA (22 : 6 n- 3), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, 20 : 5 n- 3), alpha-linolenic acid (alpha-LNA, 18 : 3 n- 3), linoleic acid (LA, 18 : 2 n- 6), arachidonic acid (AA, 20 : 4 n- 3), and gamma-linolenic acid (gamma-LNA, 18 : 3 n- 6) significantly inhibited caspase- 3 activity and LDH leakage but simultaneous treatment with the PUFAs had no effect on the apoptosis of Neuro 2 a cells. There were no significant differences of the anti-apoptotic eff ect among the PUFAs. These results suggest that PUFAs may not be effective for inhibiting neuronal cell death after acute and chronic neurodegenerative disorders. However, dietary supplementation with PUFAs may be beneficial as a potential means to delay the onset of the diseases and/or their rate of progression...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{studies of}} <b>Parkinson</b> <b>s</b> disease {{indicate}} that dorsal motor nucleus of nerve vagus {{is one of}} the earliest brain areas affected by alpha synuclein and Lewy bodies pathology. The influence of electrical stimulation of vagus nerve on elemental composition of dopamine related brain structures in rats is investigated. Synchrotron radiation based X ray fluorescence was applied to the elemental micro imaging and quantification in thin tissue sections. It was found that elements such as P, S, Cl, K, Ca, Fe, Cu, Zn, Se, Br and Rb are present in motor cortex, corpus striatum, nucleus accumbens, substantia nigra, ventral tectal area, and dorsal motor nucleus of vagus. The topographic analysis shows that macro elements like P, S, Cl and K are highly concentrated within the fiber bundles of corpus striatum. In contrast the levels of trace elements like Fe and Zn are the lowest in these structures. It was found that statistically significant differences between the animals with electrical stimulation of vagus nerve and the control are observed in the left side of corpus striatum for P p 0. 04, S p 0. 02, Cl p 0. 05, K p 0. 02, Fe p 0. 04 and Zn p 0. 02. The mass fractions of these elements are increased in the group for which the electrical stimulation of vagus nerve was performed. Moreover, the contents of Ca p 0. 02, Zn p 0. 07 and Rb p 0. 04 in substantia nigra of right hemisphere are found to be significantly lower in the group with stimulation of vagus nerve than in the control rat...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background: Aquaporin 4 (AQP 4) is the {{predominant}} water channel {{in the brain}} and is localized to the astrocytes and ependymal cells. In astrocytes it is expressed in the astrocyte membranes facing blood vessels and pia in a highly polarized manner. This polarization has been demonstrated to be important in the water and K+ homeostasis. Several studies indicate that the polarized expression of AQP 4 has {{an important role in the}} pathophysiology of several cerebral disorders, including brain edema, epilepsy and Alzheimer s disease. Objective: In this study, we want to investigate the distribution and expression pattern of AQP 4 in mouse substantia nigra (SN). AQP 4 has not been explored in this area previously. By examining its distribution, we want to see whether AQP 4 could have a role in the neuronal function in this area under normal and pathological conditions Methods: We investigated the AQP 4 distribution in the SN and neocortex of C 57 BL/ 6 mice. The animals were perfusion fixed and brains analyzed using confocal immunofluorescence and quantitative immunogold electron microscopy. Results: We found significantly higher levels of AQP 4 in the SN, as compared to the neocortex. The AQP 4 expression was highly polarized around blood vessels, both in the pars compacta and pars reticulata. There was also substantially more AQP 4 in astrocyte processes throughout the neuropil in the SN compared to the neocortex. Conclusion: The high expression of AQP 4 in both endfeet and non-endfeet membranes indicate that this molecule might play an important role for maintenance of neuronal function in the SN.

40|$|Background: Previous studies {{employed}} {{demanding and}} complex hand tasks {{to study the}} brain activation in people with <b>Parkinson</b> <b>s</b> Disease (PD). There is inconsistent finding about the cerebellar activity during movement execution of this patient population. Objectives: This study aimed to examine the brain activation patterns of PD individuals in the on-state and healthy control subjects in a simple finger tapping task. Methods: Twenty-seven patients with PD and 22 age-matched healthy subjects were recruited for the study. Subjects were instructed to perform simple finger tapping tasks under self- and cue-initiated conditions in separate runs while their brain activations were captured using fMRI. Results: Healthy subjects had higher brain activity in contralateral precentral gyrus during the self-initiated task, and higher brain activity in the ipsilateral middle occipital gyrus during the cue-initiated task. PD patients had higher brain activity in the cerebellum Crus I (bilateral) and lobules VI (ipsilateral) during the self-initiated task and higher brain activity in the contralateral middle frontal gyrus during the cue-initiated task. When compared with healthy controls, PD patients had lower brain activity in the contralateral inferior parietal lobule during the self-initiated task, and lower brain activity in the ipsilateral cerebellum lobule VIII, lobule VIIB and vermis VIII, and thalamus during the cue-initiated task. Conjunction analysis indicated that both groups had activation in bilateral cerebellum and SMA and ipsilateral precentral gyrus and postcentral gyrus during both self- and cue-initiated movement. Individuals with PD exhibited higher brain activity in the executive zone (cerebellum Crus I and II) during self-initiated movement, and lower brain activity in the sensorimotor zone (i. e. lobule VIIb and VIII of the cerebellum) during cue-initiated movement. Discussions: The findings suggest that individuals with PD may use more executive control when performing simple movements. Department of Rehabilitation Science...|$|R

40|$|Copper is an {{essential}} element that is required {{for a variety of}} important cellular functions. Since not only copper deficiency, but also excess of copper can seriously affect cellular functions, cellular copper metabolism is tightly regulated. Disturbances of copper homeostasis are the underlying defect of the inherited diseases Menkes and Wilson s disease and have also been linked to several neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer <b>s</b> disease and <b>Parkinson</b> <b>s</b> disease. Known astrocytes features strongly suggest a pivotal role of theses cells in the metal metabolism of the brain. Using astrocyte-rich primary cultures as model system, this thesis investigated the copper metabolism as well as copper-mediated alterations in the metabolism of astrocytes. Cultured astrocytes efficiently accumulated copper with saturable kinetics. The characteristics of the observed copper accumulation suggest that both copper transporter receptor 1 (Ctr 1) and a Ctr 1 -independent mechanism are involved in astrocytic copper accumulation. Cultured astrocytes were also found to release copper in a time-, concentration- and temperature-dependent manner. Copper export from these cells most likely involves the copper-ATPase ATP 7 A. Thus, with being capable of both taking up and exporting copper, astrocytes possess the cellular machinery required to transport copper from the blood-brain barrier to the brain parenchyma. Cultured astrocytes were remarkable resistance against copper-induced toxicity. Nevertheless, prolonged copper treatment led to profound alterations in their metabolism. For example, copper accumulation by cultured astrocytes was accompanied by a stimulation of glycolytic flux, an increase in the cellular glutathione content and an acceleration of glutathione export. Such copper-mediated alterations in the metabolism of astrocytes may also occur in vivo, for example in copper overload conditions such in Wilson s disease and could either contribute to disease progression or serve as compensatory response to protect the brain against the toxic effects of an excess of copper...|$|R
