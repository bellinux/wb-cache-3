5|$|It {{has been}} {{postulated}} {{that at one}} time the manuscript was in the possession of Cardinal Bessarion, because the minuscule supplement has a text similar to one of Bessarion's manuscripts. T. C. Skeat believes that Bessarion's mentor, the patriarchal notary in Constantinople John Chortasmenos, had the book brought to Rome from Constantinople {{around the time of the}} fall of the Byzantine Empire. According to Paul Canart, the decorative initials added to the manuscript in the Middle Ages are reminiscent of Constantinopolitan decoration of the 10th century, but the poor execution gives the impression they were added in the 11th or 12th century, and likely not before the 12th century in light of the way they appear in connection with notes in a minuscule hand at the beginning of the book of Daniel. T. C. Skeat, a <b>paleographer</b> at the British Museum, first argued that Codex Vaticanus was among the 50 Bibles that the Emperor Constantine I ordered Eusebius of Caesarea to produce. The similarity of the text with the papyri and Coptic version (including some letter formation), parallels with Athanasius' canon of 367 suggest an Egyptian or Alexandrian origin.|$|E

However the second graphologist, Agamemnon Tselikas, a <b>paleographer,</b> director of the National Bank of Greece Cultural Foundation and also of the Mediterranean Research Institute for Paleography, Bibliography and History of Texts, concluded it was a 20th-century forgery of 18th century script, and that the most likely forger was either Smith or someone in Smith's employ.|$|E

[...] Answering his own question, he offers that while in the contemporary political climate, [...] "One hardly needs to be Braveheart to be openly antagonistic to Israel at a meeting of anthropologists," [...] the more serious problem lies in the tradition of post-colonial studies, where anthropologists like Abu El Haj can [...] "construct their analyses with little concern for empirical or logical connectedness. Like mythology, they are masters of the found object, and pull in anything to create a story. This methodology has no connection to science. Its power lies in its politics and its aesthetics, and not in such boring ideas as validity and reliability." [...] In the same issue, Jonathan Rosenbaum, <b>paleographer</b> and President of Gratz College, suggests that Abu El Haj's [...] "personal agenda" [...] is [...] "the furtherance of her own nationalistic ideology at the expense of decades of careful excavations and rigorous publications" [...] establishing the historicity of much of the Biblical narrative.

2500|$|In 1871, Richard Simpson {{proposed}} that some {{additions to the}} play had been written by Shakespeare, {{and a year later}} James Spedding, editor of the works of Sir Francis Bacon, while rejecting some of Simpson's suggestions, supported the attribution to Shakespeare of the passage credited to Hand D. In 1916, the <b>paleographer</b> Sir Edward Maunde Thompson published a minute analysis of the handwriting of the addition and judged it to be Shakespeare's. The case was strengthened with the publication of Shakespeare's Hand in the Play of Sir Thomas More (1923) by five noted scholars who analysed the play from multiple perspectives, all of which led to the same affirmative conclusion. A second significant gathering of scholars to consider Sir Thomas More grew out of a seminar that was held during the meeting of the Shakespeare Association of America at Ashland, Oregon in 1983. [...] It resulted in a second book of essays, eight by eight different authors, that was published as Shakespeare and Sir Thomas More; Essays on the Play and its Shakespearean Interest. [...] It is a comprehensive study of the manuscript, and states that it appears more likely than ever that Shakespeare did indeed contribute to the revision of this play. This would make it the only surviving manuscript text written by Shakespeare. Although some dissenters remain, the attribution has been generally accepted since the mid-20th century and most authoritative editions of Shakespeare's works, including The Oxford Shakespeare, include the play. It was performed with Shakespeare's name included amongst the authors by the Royal Shakespeare Company in 2005.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} {{new techniques}} of medieval manuscript text discrimination {{in order to}} assist <b>paleographers</b> to understand the ancient manuscripts. One {{of the purposes of}} paleography is to cluster medieval writings into families, to find relations between them, and find their historical period and/or location. This work aims to confirm paleographers’ classification of medieval writings. It also explores the occasion to show the viability to discriminate medieval writings by using image analysis. In this paper, we define the e-paleography as the assistance of the paleography science by computer vision. Our foremost idea is to select writing features which do not require image segmentation and layout analysis. Our method is based on the Spatial Grey-Level Dependence (SGLD) which measures the join probability between grey level values of pixels for each spatial relation. We prose a statistical measure witch generalizes SGLD, and we also propose the Spatial Curvature Dependence (SCD), the Spatial Orientation Dependence (SOD) and the Spatial Curvature/Orientation Dependence (SCOD), which describe local spatial orientation and curvature of writing shapes. The experimental results are very hopeful and confirm the classifications of medieval writings specified by <b>paleographers...</b>|$|R

5000|$|Over time, {{the current}} system of rapid silent reading for {{information}} replaced the older, slower, and more dramatic performance based reading, and word dividers and punctuation became more beneficial to text. Though <b>paleographers</b> disagree about the chronological decline of scriptio continua throughout the world, it is generally accepted that the addition of spaces first appeared in Irish and Anglo-Saxon Bibles and Gospels from the seventh and eighth centuries. Subsequently, an increasing number of European texts adopted conventional spacing, and within the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, all European texts were written with word separation.|$|R

50|$|When word {{separation}} {{became the}} standard system, {{it was seen}} as a simplification of Roman culture because it undermined the metric and rhythmic fluency generated through scriptio continua. In contrast, <b>paleographers</b> today identify the extinction of scriptio continua as a critical factor in augmenting the widespread absorption of knowledge in the Pre-Modern Era. By saving the reader the taxing process of interpreting pauses and breaks, the inclusion of spaces enables the brain to comprehend written text more rapidly. Furthermore, the brain has a greater capacity to profoundly synthesize text and commit a greater portion of information to memory.|$|R
