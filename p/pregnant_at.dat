5|$|The {{numbers of}} women with SCI giving birth and having healthy babies are increasing. Around a half to two-thirds of women with SCI report {{they might want to}} have children, and 14–20% do get <b>pregnant</b> <b>at</b> least once. Although female {{fertility}} is not usually permanently reduced by SCI, there is a stress response that can happen immediately post-injury that alters levels of fertility-related hormones in the body. In about half of women, menstruation stops after the injury but then returns within an average of five months—it returns within a year for a large majority. After menstruation returns, women with SCI become <b>pregnant</b> <b>at</b> a rate close to that {{of the rest of the}} population.|$|E

5|$|Ganesan {{originally}} {{offered the}} role of Vellaiyathevan to S. S. Rajendran, who declined it due to {{his commitment to the}} film Sivagangai Seemai (1959). He later requested actress Savitri to ask her husband Gemini Ganesan to play the role, which she agreed to do despite being <b>pregnant</b> <b>at</b> that time. Gemini Ganesan was initially reluctant to accept the role, but eventually agreed. Padmini, O. A. K. Thevar, and V. K. Ramasamy were chosen to play Vellaiyammal, Oomaithurai and Ettappan respectively. S. Varalakshmi played Kattabomman's wife, Jakkamma, and also worked as a playback singer.|$|E

5|$|Stephen's betrothal to the {{daughter}} of Yaroslav Osmomysl of Halych was broken in 1166. He married Agnes of Austria {{at the end of}} the year. From this marriage a son, Béla, was born in 1167, but the child died in the same year. Agnes survived her husband and was <b>pregnant</b> <b>at</b> the time of his death.

5|$|In 1937, Victoria's brother, Ernest Louis, {{died and}} soon {{afterwards}} her widowed sister-in-law, nephew, granddaughter {{and two of}} her great-grandchildren all died in an air crash at Ostend. Victoria's granddaughter, Princess Cecilie of Greece and Denmark, had married Victoria's nephew (Ernest Louis's son), George Donatus of Hesse. They and their two young sons, Louis and Alexander, were all killed. Cecilie was <b>pregnant</b> <b>at</b> {{the time and the}} stillborn child was found among the wreckage. Cecilie's youngest child, Johanna, who was not on the plane, was adopted by her uncle Prince Louis of Hesse and by Rhine but the little girl only survived her parents and older brothers by eighteen months, dying in 1939 of meningitis.|$|E
5|$|In {{the seventh}} {{round of the}} 1977 NBA draft, the New Orleans Jazz {{selected}} Harris with the 137th pick overall. She became the second woman ever drafted by an NBA team, after Denise Long, who was selected by the San Francisco Warriors in the 1969 draft. However, the league voided the Warriors' selection, thus Harris became {{the first and only}} woman ever officially drafted. Harris did not express an interest to play in the NBA and declined to try out for the Jazz. It was later revealed that she was <b>pregnant</b> <b>at</b> the time, which made her unable to attend the Jazz's training camp. She was selected ahead of 33 other male players, including the Jazz's eighth round selection, Dave Speicher from the University of Toledo.|$|E

40|$|We {{report a}} case of an epileptic <b>pregnant</b> woman <b>at</b> 20 weeks of {{gestation}} treated with carbamazepine, whose fetus was affected by major malformations {{probably due to the}} drug teratogenicity.

After seven months the patient was <b>pregnant</b> again, <b>at</b> 14 weeks of gestation she aborted spontaneously a fetus with no malformations.

5|$|Louis {{married his}} second wife, Elizabeth, around 20 June 1353. Elizabeth was the {{daughter}} of Stephen II, Ban of Bosnia, and Stephen's wife, Elizabeth of Kuyavia. Louis and his new wife were within the prohibited degree of kinship, because Louis's mother and his wife's grandmother were cousins, but they applied for a papal dispensation only about four months after their marriage. Historian Iván Bertényi says that this haste suggests that Elizabeth, who had been living in the court of Louis's mother, was <b>pregnant</b> <b>at</b> the time of the marriage. If this theory is valid, Louis's and his wife's first child was stillborn. Their next child, Catherine, was born in 1370 and died in 1378. The next daughter, Mary, who would succeed Louis in Hungary, was born in 1371. Louis's youngest daughter, Hedwig, who was born in 1373, became queen regnant of Poland.|$|E
5|$|University of Alabama {{graduate}} and single parent Tahesia Harrigan {{was the sole}} female competitor from the British Virgin Islands, and one of two participating in a track and field event and for the BVI as a whole. Her appearance at Beijing was her first Olympic appearance; she did not compete in the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens because she was <b>pregnant</b> <b>at</b> the time. When at the Olympics, Harrigan competed {{in the first round}} of the 100m dash on 15 August, where she was placed in Heat 2 against, among others, Lauryn Williams of the United States and Christine Arron of France. Harrigan ranked third in a heat of eight athletes with a time of 11.46seconds, placing behind Williams by 0.08seconds and ahead of Brazil's Lucimar Moura by 0.14seconds. Overall, Harrigan tied Jade Latoya Bailey of Barbados for 25th place out of 85. She progressed to the next round.|$|E
5|$|In Zoha Prison in Romania, {{there are}} {{interviews}} with traffickers serving prison sentences {{that the film}} suggested were too short {{in light of the}} severity of the crime of human trafficking. The typical sentence for this crime is six or seven years, while the sentence for trafficking in drugs is normally twenty years. Two Romanian traffickers, Traian and Ovidiu, attest to having starved, punched, and kicked the girls they trafficked. Ovidiu recounts a story, in an interview filmed in February 2007, about kidnapping a prostitute and selling her for sex when he was 14. He expresses no remorse for these actions. The sentences served by Traian and Ovidiu were short enough that, by the time the film was released, they were no longer in prison. Ana, a girl they trafficked, is also interviewed in the film, saying that she lost a tooth in one of her beatings. She describes being <b>pregnant</b> <b>at</b> the time, but not telling this to her captors because of fears for the unborn child's safety.|$|E

5|$|In the Metamorphoses by Antoninus Liberalis, written {{somewhere in}} the 2nd or 3rd century A.D., the myth is set in Phoenicia, near Mount Lebanon. Here King Thias, son of Belus and Orithyia, had a {{daughter}} named Smyrna. Being of great beauty, she was sought by men from far and wide. She had devised many tricks in order to delay her parents and defer the day they would choose a husband for her. Smyrna had been driven mad by desire for her father {{and did not want}} anybody else. At first she hid her desires, eventually telling her nurse, Hippolyte, the secret of her true feelings. Hippolyte told the king that a girl of exalted parentage wanted to lie with him, but in secret. The affair lasted {{for an extended period of}} time, and Smyrna became <b>pregnant.</b> <b>At</b> this point, Thias desired to know who she was so he hid a light, illuminating the room and discovering Smyrna's identity when she entered. In shock, Smyrna gave birth prematurely to her child. She then raised her hands and said a prayer, which was heard by Zeus who took pity on her and turned her into a tree. Thias killed himself, and it was on the wish of Zeus that the child was brought up and named Adonis.|$|E
