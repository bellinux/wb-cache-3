Fast mapping is the <b>process</b> <b>of</b> <b>learning</b> a new concept upon a single exposure and is used in word learning not only by infants and toddlers, but by preschool children and adults as well. This principle is very useful for word learning in conversational settings, as words tend not to be explained explicitly in conversation, but may be referred to frequently throughout the span of a conversation.|$|E
5|$|Dialogue {{heard in}} the dream {{sequence}} uses a distinctive reversed manner of speech. This was achieved by recording the actors' line phonetically reversed, and playing this audio backwards. David Lynch had begun experimenting with the technique in 1971, and had originally planned {{to use it in}} his 1977 debut feature, Eraserhead, before it finally found use in this episode. Describing the <b>process</b> <b>of</b> <b>learning</b> his lines backwards, Anderson notes that he first worked out the phonemes of each word rather than simply reading it back to front, and disregarded the inflection of any given word as this helped bolster the discordant effect of the end result. The reversed audio was also altered with a slight reverb effect. The actors were required to perform their movements backwards, as elements of the scene would be reversed entirely.|$|E

40|$|The formal <b>processes</b> <b>of</b> <b>learning</b> play an {{important}} role in the <b>learning</b> <b>of</b> individuals and usually are associated with coaching, schools, courses, among others. However, this article highlights the need for observation of the aspects that permeate the informal learning in organizations, including those which happen in the formal <b>processes</b> <b>of</b> <b>learning.</b> From the time in which individuals in their day-by-day work perform tasks, held assertions, solve problems and cooperate with colleagues, they are participating in a <b>process</b> <b>of</b> informal <b>learning,</b> from the interaction between the individual and the context. This form <b>of</b> <b>learning</b> is based in a context with rules, values, attitudes, expectations, artifacts, among other socio-cultural elements. Thus, this essay aims to explore the contributions of the literature about the informal learning.

In 1935, Foote applied to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, hoping to join with the older Percy boys, but was denied admission because of an unfavorable recommendation from his high school principal. He presented himself for admission anyway, and as result of a battery of admissions tests, he was accepted. In 1936 he was initiated in the Alpha Delta chapter of the Alpha Tau Omega fraternity. Interested more in the <b>process</b> <b>of</b> <b>learning</b> than in earning a degree, Foote was not a model student.

25|$|In Steven Johnson's book, Everything Bad Is Good for You, {{he argues}} that video games in fact demand far more from a player than {{traditional}} games like Monopoly. To experience the game, the player must first determine the objectives, {{as well as how}} to complete them. They must then learn the game controls and how the human-machine interface works, including menus and HUDs. Beyond such skills, which after some time become quite fundamental and are taken for granted by many gamers, video games are based upon the player navigating (and eventually mastering) a highly complex system with many variables. This requires a strong analytical ability, as well as flexibility and adaptability. He argues that the <b>process</b> <b>of</b> <b>learning</b> the boundaries, goals, and controls of a given game is often a highly demanding one that calls on many different areas of cognitive function. Indeed, most games require a great deal of patience and focus from the player, and, contrary to the popular perception that games provide instant gratification, games actually delay gratification far longer than other forms of entertainment such as film or even many books. Some research suggests video games may even increase players' attention capacities.|$|E
