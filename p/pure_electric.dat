This work proposes to hybridize solar sail propulsion and solar electric propulsion on the same spacecraft to enable such a pole-sitter orbit. Locally optimal control laws are found with a semianalytical inverse method, starting from a trajectory that satisfies the pole-sitter condition in the sun–Earth circular restricted three-body problem. These solutions are subsequently used as a first guess to find optimal orbits, using a direct method based on pseudospectral transcription. The orbital dynamics of both the <b>pure</b> solar <b>electric</b> propulsion case and the hybrid case are investigated and compared.
