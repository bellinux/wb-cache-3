5|$|The fleet {{returned}} to waters off Okinawa on 4 May and renewed its {{attacks on the}} airfields on the Sakishima Islands. Vice-Admiral Bernard Rawlings, second {{in command of the}} BPF, and his staff had determined that bombardment of Japanese gun positions by the heavy guns of battleships and cruisers might be a more effective method of destroying them than aerial attack. They detached King George V and Howe, as well as five cruisers, that morning to bombard Nobara and Hiara airfields while fighters flew a <b>protective</b> <b>CAP</b> over them and spotted the fall of their shells. The loss of the most effective anti-aircraft ships was more important than anticipated and the Japanese were {{able to take advantage of}} the opportunity. The carrier had just launched two Corsairs for bombardment-spotting duties and the deck park of eleven Avengers was being moved forward to allow aircraft to land when an undetected Mitsubishi A6M Zero fighter attacked at 11:31. The Zero first strafed the flight deck before any of Formidables guns could open fire and then turned sharply to dive into the forward flight deck despite the ship's hard turn to starboard. The fighter released a bomb shortly before it would have impacted the deck and was destroyed by the bomb's blast, although the remnants of the Zero struck Formidable.|$|E

2500|$|Chapter 5. The Beanproof Cap of Foulproof Taylor. Chapter 5 {{begins by}} {{describing}} challenges fielders face when {{looking for a}} fly ball in the sun. [...] To see better, {{as well as to}} protect their eyes, players began wearing sun glasses during in the early 1900s. Protecting a players eyes, however was of secondary importance to protecting a player's head which could only be accomplished by a hardened shell worn under, over or in the place of a cap. One of the early inventors of protective headgear was James Philip Leo Taylor, a British immigrant and inventor, who after suffering a groin injury, developed one of the first protective cups designed to protect male genitalia. Taylor's version of a <b>protective</b> <b>cap</b> never became popular nor did he ever achieve fame or wealth {{as a result of his}} other safety inventions, but eventually, and mainly as the result of devastating accidents, safety gear was worn by all baseball players.|$|E
