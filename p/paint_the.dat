5|$|In 2006, {{students}} from the Art Institute of Portland used stencils to advertise a concert for the Oregon Food Bank. The students believed they were using spray chalk, but after completion, they learned they were actually using spray <b>paint.</b> <b>The</b> students were told that even temporary markings count as graffiti, and the students offered to remove the paint and apologize to businesses affected. Criminal charges were not filed.|$|E

5|$|Ivanović {{had left}} Vienna in 1840 {{and gone to}} study at the Munich Academy, {{possibly}} owing to Czacki's further generosity. Subsequent statements suggest that Ivanović was inspired to <b>paint</b> <b>The</b> Conquest of Belgrade around this time. Writing in 1873, she recalled how the painting came about: While studying at the Munich Academy, I started to read History of the Serb People. I wanted to <b>paint</b> <b>the</b> brave battle of Mirko on my canvas. With seven of his comrades he succeeded in entering the city at night while the Muslims were celebrating Bajram (Eid al-Fitr) and didn't even think about any danger. Mirko and his comrades killed the guards at the town gate. Their rifle shots were the signal for the others. Ivanović soon travelled to Belgrade, visited the battlesite, conversed {{with some of the}} participants in Belgrade's capture, and examined period clothing and weaponry used in the battle. She created the composition in 1844–45; it was painted in Belgrade.|$|E

5|$|My {{object in}} the present work is to <b>paint</b> <b>the</b> rich Jew in his true colors, as the enemy of society; {{to show that the}} Jew who steals millions, can, in Europe, at any rate, defy the laws with impunity, and that he almost {{invariably}} escapes punishment owing to improper occult influences, and the mighty power of Israelitish gold.|$|E

5|$|At 2 a.m. on {{the night}} of 18 October 2015, a group of 30 Jews, on {{instruction}} from Rabbi Eliezer Berland, went to the tomb without permits, in contravention of a standing IDF order, to clean and <b>paint</b> <b>the</b> compound that was burned three days before. As they were attacked by local Palestinians, six of them were bruised by beatings, and one of their vehicles was burnt. They claimed that the Palestinian police, who had detained them, had also beaten them, before they were handed over to the Israeli army, which had been called to extract the others.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} 1926, Rix Nicholas and Dorothy Richmond {{together}} {{returned to}} Australia. Energised by her success, Rix Nicholas purchased a car, filled its rear compartment with painting equipment, and the pair set out to <b>paint</b> <b>the</b> landscape, ranging from Canberra and the Monaro plains to the south, up into central Queensland. This included a publicity-attracting occasion where she painted figures {{on the beach at}} Bondi, reported by various publications including Australian magazine, The Home.|$|E
50|$|Unfortunately, none of {{the names}} of the artists have survived, so modern {{scholars}} have been obliged to give the recognizable artistic hands and workshops nicknames based on the subject matter of their works, museums which possess the works, or individuals who have distinguished the works from others. Some of the most famous of the Apulian vase painters at Taras are now called: <b>the</b> Iliupersis <b>Painter,</b> <b>the</b> Lycurgus <b>Painter,</b> <b>the</b> Gioia del Colle <b>Painter,</b> <b>the</b> Darius <b>Painter,</b> <b>the</b> Underworld <b>Painter,</b> and <b>the</b> White Sakkos <b>Painter,</b> among others.|$|R
50|$|The {{earliest}} {{representatives of}} the style worked in the workshop of the potter Myson between 480 and 450 BC. The most important artist of the style {{at that time was}} <b>the</b> Pan <b>Painter.</b> Also significant were <b>the</b> Pig <b>Painter,</b> <b>the</b> Leningrad <b>Painter</b> and <b>the</b> Agrigento <b>Painter.</b> <b>The</b> middle phase, between about 450 and 425 BC, is dominated by the Nausikaa-Hephaistos Group, comprising seven artists. Its leading and eponymous artists were <b>the</b> Nausikaa <b>Painter</b> and <b>the</b> Hephaistos <b>Painter.</b> <b>The</b> last important artists of the style, {{near the end of the}} 5th century, are <b>the</b> Academy <b>Painter</b> and <b>the</b> <b>Painter</b> of Athens 1183.|$|R

5|$|Before {{applying}} the top coats of <b>paint,</b> <b>the</b> LMS would apply a matt undercoat of shop grey {{in which it}} was customary to photograph the locomotive for the first time. The ensuing LMS top coats for the Coronation Class came in two basic colours during this period: Caledonian blue and crimson lake. Linings for streamliners involved the renowned 'speed whiskers' comprising stripes emerging from a fixed point in the lower centre of the front of the locomotive to run in parallel along the sides. Non-streamliners carried the standard LMS-style lining.|$|E
5|$|For Lord Charlemont, Hogarth {{chose to}} <b>paint</b> <b>the</b> satirical Piquet, or Virtue in Danger (also known as The Lady's Last Stake, after a 1708 play by Colley Cibber), which, with echoes of Marriage à-la-Mode, shows an army officer {{offering}} an aristocratic lady {{a chance to}} recover the fortune she has just lost by gambling (with the implication that if she loses again, {{she will have to}} take him as her lover). After Grosvenor saw this painting in Hogarth's studio in 1758, he asked Hogarth to paint a picture for him as well, under the same terms.|$|E
5|$|For Shaw's Ferrari, it {{was decided}} that {{purchasing}} an actual model of which only 350 exist and would cost at least $1million would be too expensive and the vehicle would be unsuitable for filming purposes. Instead, two replicas were commissioned, a process which took three months under the supervision of prop master Peter Gelfman. The replicas then received additional reinforcement for filming purposes from Steve Kirshoff and the special effects crew. After running camera tests on several authentic Ferrari colors, {{it was decided}} to <b>paint</b> <b>the</b> replicas bright red {{in order to create a}} lasting impression instead of using the actual metallic brown muted-coloring of McQueen's vehicle.|$|E
50|$|In 1997, Wonnacott <b>painted</b> <b>the</b> British prime {{minister}} John Major. In 2000, he <b>painted</b> <b>the</b> British Royal Family in a 12-foot tall artwork.|$|R

The next collaborative work [...] "Spirit of Paris" [...] was unveiled at a private reception at Lawrence Ross Galleries in Beverly Hills in January 1986. Americo <b>painted</b> <b>the</b> right most one-third of <b>the</b> <b>painting,</b> while Eva <b>painted</b> <b>the</b> center third and A.B. <b>painted</b> <b>the</b> left most one-third of <b>the</b> <b>painting.</b> Each artist signed below the area of their work.|$|R
50|$|The {{process of}} {{restoring}} <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> began <b>the</b> same day. Following consultations with chemists, art restorers began washing {{the surface of}} <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> with water; they kept <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> in <b>the</b> vertical position, and sprayed water at <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> to prevent further degradation of <b>the</b> <b>painting.</b>|$|R
5|$|In late August 1917, {{the rotary}} engine F.I {{prototype}} {{was assigned to}} Voss as his personal aircraft. In his childhood, Voss had flown Japanese fighting kites with his cousins in Krefeld; the decorations on the kites gave him the inspiration to <b>paint</b> <b>the</b> nose cowling of his triplane with two eyes, eyebrows and a moustache. The arrival of the new fighter brought celebrities visiting. On 31 August, Anthony Fokker escorted German Chancellor Georg Michaelis and Major General Ernst von Lossberg to see and film the new triplane. On 9 September, Crown Prince Wilhelm would also visit Jasta 10.|$|E

Patrick then races to the Krusty Krab to tell Mr. Krabs with SpongeBob trying to stop him, inadvertently getting Patrick to say the word in the process. When SpongeBob bursts {{through the front door}} and tells Mr. Krabs that Patrick said the swear word, Patrick then joins along. Eventually, Mr. Krabs stops their gibberish explanations, and takes SpongeBob and Patrick outside and makes them <b>paint</b> <b>the</b> Krusty Krab as punishment.|$|E
5|$|Leonardo {{worked in}} Milan from 1482 until 1499. He was {{commissioned}} to <b>paint</b> <b>the</b> Virgin of the Rocks for the Confraternity of the Immaculate Conception and The Last Supper for the monastery of Santa Maria delle Grazie. In {{the spring of}} 1485, Leonardo travelled to Hungary on behalf of Ludovico to meet Matthias Corvinus, for whom he {{is believed to have}} painted a Holy Family. Between 1493 and 1495, Leonardo listed a woman called Caterina among his dependents in his taxation documents. When she died in 1495, the list of funeral expenditures suggests that she was his mother.|$|E
50|$|He was facile both {{in history}} and {{portrait}} paintings. Among his first works was a Marius besieged by the Cimbri. In 1822, he <b>painted</b> <b>the</b> Oath of the Horatii.

5|$|Matejko {{began to}} <b>paint</b> <b>the</b> Prussian Homage on Christmas Eve 1879 and {{finished}} it in 1882. He donated {{it to the}} Polish nation during {{the meeting of the}} Diet of Galicia (Sejm Krajowy) in Lwów (Lviv) on 7 October 1882 to start a collection designed to revive the remodelling of Wawel Castle. It was subsequently exhibited in Kraków, Lwów and Warsaw, as well as in Berlin, Paris, Budapest, and most notably in Rome and Vienna. When it returned to Kraków in 1885, it was temporarily exhibited in the Sukiennice Museum because the Royal Wawel Castle was occupied at that time by the Austrian army, as Kraków was part of the Austrian partition of Poland.|$|E
5|$|On {{a single}} day in 1825, 23 ships were left {{stranded}} off the coast. In 1833, Martinus Rørbye became the first artist to <b>paint</b> <b>the</b> fishermen and landscapes of Skagen, {{almost half a century}} before the arrival of the Skagen Painters. Skagen Church was inaugurated in 1841, and the first guest house in the town opened in 1844. In 1858, the grey lighthouse was inaugurated. The same year, bye-laws were established specifying building requirements including the completion of tiled roofs within five years. Skagen was struck by the cholera epidemic of 1853.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} surviving {{depiction of}} the abbey is by the engravers Samuel and Nathaniel Buck, who specialised in landmarks and great ruins. Their engraving (1733) shows {{the church of the}} abbey much as it is today, {{with the exception of the}} high vault of the south transept still present. The picture has notable errors and was clearly done from memory and rough sketches. The most famous artist to <b>paint</b> <b>the</b> ruins was John Constable, whose 1833 painting of the west end of the church shows it among trees.|$|E
