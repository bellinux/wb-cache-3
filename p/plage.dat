5|$|The {{spore print}} is pale purplish brown. Spores are ovoid (egg-shaped) to {{somewhat}} ellipsoidal, binucleate (visible when stained with acetocarmine solution), often contain a single oil droplet, and measure 6–8.5 by 4–5.5µm. The spore walls are roughened with small points and ridges, {{and have a}} small <b>plage.</b> The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are club-shaped, four-spored, and measure 24–26 by 6–8.5µm. Cystidia on the gill face (pleurocystidia) are abundant. They are spindle-shaped with swollen middles, and thick tips that are occasionally encrusted with translucent crystals. They have dimensions of 43–86 by 10–24µm, with walls that are pale brown to translucent, and up to 3µm thick. Cystidia on the gill edge (cheilocystidia) are roughly the same morphologically, but shorter. The cap cuticle comprises a layer of radially arranged gelatinized hyphae measuring 1–4µm in diameter. Clamp connections {{are present in the}} hyphae.|$|E
5|$|The {{division}} was allotted three specific tasks to achieve {{as a part}} of Tonga, apart from protecting the eastern flank of the Allied seaborne landings and taking control of the areas of strategic importance to the east of Caen. First, it was to capture intact the two bridges over the Caen Canal and the Orne River at Bénouville and Ranville. The bridges then would be defended against counterattacks. Gale knew that the capture of the bridges would be critical for the resupply and reinforcement of his division, but he did not know that the bridges were incapable of supporting tanks. Second, the {{division was}} to destroy the heavily fortified Merville coastal artillery battery located at Franceville <b>Plage,</b> to ensure that it could not shell the British forces landing in the area codenamed Sword. The third mission was to destroy several bridges which spanned the River Dives, located near the towns of Varaville, Robehomme, Bures and Troarn. The division would then hold the territory that it had seized, until it could be relieved by advancing British ground forces.|$|E
25|$|Located on {{a narrow}} {{peninsula}} halfway between the medieval town Vannes and the seaside resort Quiberon, Carnac is split into two centres - Carnac-Ville and Carnac-Plage (the beachfront).

40|$|The Hyades {{are known}} to differ in their {{photometric}} properties (Crawford 1969; Campbell 1984) and spectral properties (Rose 1984) from field stars of similar metal abundance. Using spectra of solar <b>plages,</b> it is demonstrated that the Hyades spectral anomalies are caused by excess emission from magnetic regions (<b>plages)</b> on the surfaces of these cluster stars. It is further speculated that the Hyades photometric anomalies arise from the same cause, but photometric data on solar <b>plages</b> necessary {{to resolve this issue}} are not available. The Pleiades stars and a few extreme emission stars show similar spectral anomalies, but of such magnitude to indicate that <b>plages</b> on Pleiades stars have higher surface brightnesses than on the sun and do not merely cover a larger fraction of the stars...|$|R

25|$|The goal {{of local}} helioseismology, a term first used in 1993, is to {{interpret}} the full wave field observed at the surface, not just the mode (more precisely, eigenmode) frequencies. Another {{way to look at}} it, is that global helioseismology studies standing waves of the entire Sun and local helioseismology studies propagating waves in parts of the Sun. A variety of solar phenomena are being studied, including sunspots, <b>plage,</b> supergranulation, giant cell convection, magnetically active region evolution, meridional circulation, and solar rotation. Local helioseismology provides a three-dimensional view of the solar interior, which is important to understand large-scale flows, magnetic structures, and their interactions in the solar interior.|$|E

25|$|The {{group that}} landed at Le Touquet had the Merlimont <b>Plage</b> Hotel as an objective. Intelligence had {{suggested}} that the Germans were using the hotel as a barracks. When the group reached the hotel they discovered it was empty and {{the doors and windows}} boarded up. Unable to find another target, they returned to the beach, only to discover their boat had put back out to sea. During the wait, two German sentries stumbled on the group and were quietly killed by the troops' bayonets. Another German patrol then approached across the sand dunes and the group was forced to swim out to the boat, leaving its weapons behind.|$|E
25|$|The raid {{would be}} carried out by 115 {{officers}} and other ranks, who were divided into four groups., Each group would be landed on one of the target beaches at Neufchâtel-Hardelot, Stella <b>Plage,</b> Berck and Le Touquet. They were to spend no more than 80 minutes ashore before returning to their boats. The RAF boats were not equipped for a mission like this and lacked exact navigation equipment and the compasses were known to be unreliable. Crossing the channel they also came to the notice of patrolling RAF aircraft who, not being aware of the mission, came in close to investigate. At around 02:00 hours on 24 June 1940, the boats reached France and put their men ashore.|$|E
25|$|The first {{prototype}} {{was flown}} in early 1936 (according to newest research, earlier given date December 1935 is wrong). It won the contest over the Lublin R-XXI {{project and the}} PWS factory project, but factory trials showed that its performance was still not satisfactory. In 1937 two modified prototypes were built, designated RWD-14a, but both crashed during trials that year due to steering mechanism faults (the pilots survived). Finally, in early 1938 the fourth improved prototype, designated RWD-14b, was built. After successful trials it was ordered by the Polish Air Force, receiving the name Czapla (Polish: heron), but due to a long development process, it was regarded as only an interim model, to replace the R-XIII until {{the advent of the}} more modern LWS-3 Mewa. In return for refunding the development costs, the DWL gave the rights to produce the RWD-14b to the state factory LWS (Lubelska Wytwórnia Samolotów – Lublin Aircraft Works, a successor of the <b>Plage</b> i Laśkiewicz).|$|E

25|$|The {{climate of}} Geneva is temperate, oceanic (Köppen: Cfb). Winters are cool, usually with light frosts {{at night and}} thawing {{conditions}} during the day. Summers are relatively warm. Precipitation is adequate and is relatively well-distributed throughout the year, although autumn is slightly wetter than the other seasons. Ice storms near Lac Léman are quite normal in the winter. In the summer many people enjoy swimming in the lake, and frequently patronise public beaches such as Genève <b>Plage</b> and the Bains des Pâquis. Geneva, in certain years, receives snow in the colder months of the year. The nearby mountains are subject to substantial snowfall and are suitable for skiing. Many world-renowned ski resorts such as Verbier and Crans-Montana are just over two hours away by car. Mont Salève (1379 m), {{just across the border}} in France, dominates the southerly view from the city centre and Mont Blanc, the highest of the Alpine range is visible from most of the city, towering high above Chamonix, which along with Morzine, Le Grand Bornand, La Clusaz, and resorts of the Grand Massif such as Samoens, Morillon and Flaine, are the closest French skiing destinations to Geneva.|$|E

De Haan introduced Gauguin to Thomas Carlyle's novel Sartor Resartus (1836) by way of conversation.
