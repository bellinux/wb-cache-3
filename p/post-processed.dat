However, a few distinct moments can be observed in the film's music, either composed by Andrei Toncu (Andrei imagining stealing the trolleybus), or already existing recordings, edited so that they would integrate into the movie's atmosphere (Elvis Presley's dedication is dynamically equalized to suggest the shift from one radio to another). Another scene in which multiple layers of sound were used was the radio show heard in Giani's car about the breeding of Memestra brassicae butterflies.|$|E

25|$|In industry, thermal {{analyses}} are often {{ignored in the}} design process or performed too latenbsp&—nbsp&when design changes are limited and become too costly. Of the three methods mentioned in this article, theoretical and numerical methods {{can be used to}} determine an estimate of the heat sink or component temperatures of products before a physical model has been made. A theoretical model is normally used as a first order estimate. Online heat sink calculators can provide a reasonable estimate of forced and natural convection heat sink performance based on a combination of theoretical and empirically derived correlations. Numerical methods or computational fluid dynamics (CFD) provide a qualitative (and sometimes even quantitative) prediction of fluid flows. What this means is that it will give a visual or <b>post-processed</b> result of a simulation, like the images in figures 16 and 17, and the CFD animations in figure 18 and 19, but the quantitative or absolute accuracy of the result is sensitive to the inclusion and accuracy of the appropriate parameters.|$|E

Many microstructures, which contain cantilever beams, comb structures and microrotors, are fabricated using the CMOS surface micromachining <b>post-process.</b> Using the same process, two devices such as a radio frequency (RF) switch and a micro-xy stage are successfully developed.

40|$|The {{fabrication}} of a microelectromechanical resonator using the commercial 0. 35 mu m complementary {{metal oxide semiconductor}} (CMOS) process and a <b>post-process</b> has been implemented.

Easy execution and low cost are the advantages of the <b>post-process.</b> The resonator comprises a driving part and a sensing part. The sensing part produces a change in capacitance when applying a driving voltage to the driving part in the resonator.

The emerging high-performance AFSIW technology is of high {{interest for the}} design of microwave and millimeter-wave substrate integrated systems based on low-cost multilayer printed circuit board (PCB) process. However, to comply with stringent specifica-tions, especially for space, aeronautical and safety applications, a filter <b>post-process</b> tuning technique is desired. AFSIW single pole filter <b>post-process</b> tuning using a capacitive post is theoret-ically analyzed. It is demonstrated that a tuning of more than 3 % of the resonant frequency is achieved at 21 GHz using a 0. 3 mm radius post with a 40 % insertion ratio. For experi-mental demonstration, a fourth-order AFSIW band pass filter operating in the 20. 88 to 21. 11 GHz band is designed and fabri-cated. Due to fabrication tolerances, it is shown that its perfor-mances are not in line with expected results. Using capacitive post tuning, characteristics are improved and agree with opti-mized results.
