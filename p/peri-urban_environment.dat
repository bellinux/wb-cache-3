The <b>peri‐urban</b> <b>environment</b> extends along the coast for 100 km north and south of the city. Within the region is a fragmented landscape of suburbs, parks and remnant woodlands. The Eucalyptus gomphocephala woodland south of Perth is classified within the <b>peri‐urban</b> <b>environment.</b> Numerous Phytophthora species have been isolated from dead and dying endemic trees. The most frequently isolated species is P. multivora (65 %), followed by P. aff. arenaria (21 %); P. palmivora, P. syringae, P. inundata, P. aff. humicola, P. nicotianae and P. sp. ohioensis have also been isolated, although rarely. P. multivora and P. aff. arenaria have both been isolated from dying E. marginata (jarrah), E. gomphocephala (tuart), Corymbia calophylla (marri), C. ficifolia (red flowering gum) and Agonis flexuosa (WA peppermint). While P. multivora is commonly encountered in less impacted ecosystems, the other species found in the periurban environment (P. inundata and P. nicotianae) are rarely or never isolated. In the riparian ecosystem, P. aff. humicola has been isolated from dying Casuarina obesa. The knowledge about the impact of these species on our remnant trees is lacking. Further research is required on the origin, pathogenicity and control of these species to deliver effective management strategies...|$|E

40|$|Natural {{regeneration}} is {{a critical}} component of forest ecosystems sustainability. Local extinction can occur without adequate regenerationor seedling recruitment prior to adult senescence. The urban and <b>peri-urban</b> <b>environment</b> is particularly challenging for recruitment. For example, al-though many forest species have specific requirements involving fire events, few opportunities associated with fire exist in contemporary urban and peri-urban environments. For our study species, Eucalyptus gomphocephala, en masse recruitment can occur in ashbeds following a hot fire. However, this may not occur following low-intensity, fuel reduction burns that are prescribed for many E. gomphocephala woodlands and forests. Nevertheless, ashbeds could be created by con-structing and burning coarse woody debris (CWD) piles. In a series of collaborative case studies involving community groups, NGOs and Local and State Government agencies, we investigated whether seedling recruitment could be facilitated through broadcast seeding after: a) creating CWD piles prior to a low intensity, prescribed burn; b) naturally-occurring ashbeds following a ho...|$|E

40|$|Artificial {{light at}} night (ALAN) is an {{increasing}} phenomenon worldwide. It causes a wealth of biological and ecological effects that may eventually affect populations and ecosystems. Despite the growing concern about ALAN, {{little is known about}} the light levels species are exposed to at night, especially for wetlands and underwater habitats. We determined nocturnal irradiance in urban and peri-urban wetlands above and under water, and assessed the effect of cloud cover on the variability of ALAN across the urban gradient. Even in aquatic habitats, cloud cover could increase irradiance beyond values observed during clear full moon nights. We report a negative relationship between baseline irradiance and the increase in irradiance during overcast nights. According to this result and previous studies, we propose that the change in the variation regime of ALAN between the urban center and rural land at its periphery is a usual feature. We discuss the ecological and evolutionary implications of this spatial variation in the urban and <b>peri-urban</b> <b>environment...</b>|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{survival}} of farms requires innovative adaptation and investment {{to take advantage}} of the characteristics of the <b>peri-urban</b> <b>environment.</b> In Ontario, Canada, the Provincial Government passed in 2005 the Greenbelt Act that delimits Ontario’s Greenbelt—an area of 1. 8 million acres where land is protected from development around the metropolitan region of the Greater Golden Horseshoe. This paper presents research on farm-level analysis of farmers’ investment decision-making aiming at understanding the impact of Ontario’s Greenbelt on farm investment. We interviewed 21 peri-urban farmers from Southern Ontario and 3 Greenbelt experts. Three sources of data are used to understand farm investment decision-making: farmers’ mental maps, the interview transcriptions, and the information provided by a complementary questionnaire. The results demonstrate that Ontario’s Greenbelt, designed to make agriculture the primary land use in the designated area through farmland preservation, is not sufficient. Protecting a sustainable and efficient agricultural sector requires the presence of the other actors in the whole food chain in order to supply farmers and help them access markets for their products, as well as provide information and technical services...|$|E

40|$|Managing {{drainage}} {{in rural}} and <b>peri-urban</b> <b>environments</b> {{has become an}} essential part of integrated water management. Drainage has become a science of control, storage and (re) use while meeting triple bottom-line requirements (environment, social and economic assessments). Controlled drainage in rural settings aims at maintaining a groundwater table regime that will provide adequate rootzone aeration and soil salinity control but will not remove or use more water than necessary. In urban and <b>peri-urban</b> <b>environments,</b> the philosophy of water sensitive urban design (WSUD) aims at an integrated approach to urban water management through emphasising sensitivity to water in urban design. Urban landscape and architectural building elements now combine the areas of controlling flood flows, detention and treatment of stormwater and the reuse of stormwater as their principal functionalities. Constructed wetlands treat stormwater for recharge of aquifers and subsequent recovery for non-potable reuse. The increase in population, the urbanisation of rural and lowland (coastal-) areas, and the emergence of mega-cities together call for state-of-the-art drainage design as part of integrated water resources management at a river basin scale.

Certain efforts were made in this direction including the application of edge enhancement and detection operators, wavelets, Hough Transform etc. However it is difficult to choose among optimal algorithms since the complex scenes portrayed on satellite images are strongly dependent on the radiometric and physical properties of the sensors and on the illumination properties and topographic relief of each scene. Therefore, the category of information to be extracted (scale and context) determines the “suitability ” of the method applied for linear feature extraction.

Considered a rural disease occurring mainly in paddy-field dominated landscapes where pigs are amplifying hosts, JE may nevertheless circulate in a wider range of environment given the diversity of its potential hosts and vectors. The main objective {{of this study was to}} assess the intensity of JE transmission to pigs in a <b>peri-urban</b> <b>environment</b> in the outskirt of Phnom Penh, Cambodia. We estimated the force of JE infection in two cohorts of 15 sentinel pigs by fitting a generalised linear model on seroprevalence monitoring data observed during two four-month periods in 2014. Our results provide evidence for intensive circulation of JE virus in a periurban area near Phnom Penh, the capital and most populated city of Cambodia. Understanding JE virus transmission in different environments is important for planning JE virus control in the long term and is also an interesting model to study the complexity of vector-borne diseases. Collecting quantitative data such as the force of infection will help calibrate epidemiological model that can be used to better understand complex vector-borne disease epidemiological cycles.

40|$|Abstract Understanding how {{risks to}} human health change {{as a result of}} {{seasonal}} variations in environmental conditions is likely to become of increasing importance in the context of climatic change, especially in lower-income countries. A multi-disciplinary approach can be a useful tool for improving understanding, particularly in situations where existing data resources are limited but the environmental health implications of seasonal hazards may be high. This short article describes a multi-disciplinary approach combining analysis of changes in levels of environmental contamination, seasonal variations in disease incidence and a social scientific analysis of health behaviour. The methodology was field-tested in a <b>peri-urban</b> <b>environment</b> in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam, where poor households face alternate seasonal extremes in the local environment as the water level in the Delta changes from flood to dry season. Low-income households in the research sites rely on river water for domestic uses, including provision of drinking water, and it is commonly perceived that the seasonal changes alter risk from diarrhoeal diseases and other diseases associated with contamination of water. The discussion focuses on the implementation of the methodology in the field, and draws lessons from the research process that can help in refining and developing the approach for application in other locations where seasonal dynamics of disease risk may have important consequences for public health. </p...|$|E
40|$|Forest patches are an {{important}} feature for increasing and maintain plant diversity in the urban and peri-urban landscapes. However, in such environments, the number of alien trees has increased over time due to the invasion of those species planted for ornamental and soil stabilization purposes. These species are able to invade abandoned areas whether forming patches of forests or linear features of different dimensions that may be considered novel urban ecosystems and a sort of urban wilderness. However, invasive alien tree species can also cause several detrimental effects. From the conservation and management perspective, the impacts on plant assemblages are of extreme importance. Alien tree species can {{have an effect on}} native communities and also can favour the establishment of other alien plants. Interestingly, their spread and consequences on plant diversity may be different in urban and peri-urban areas highlighting that their negative impacts are not an axiom. Here we discuss all these aspects by taking as an example black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia L.) in both urban and <b>peri-urban</b> <b>environments.</b> We conclude highlighting the need of further investigations on the impacts of alien tree species in urban and <b>peri-urban</b> <b>environments</b> distinguishing these from those due to urbanization per se, on the ecosystem services and social benefits related to such forests and, hence, the importance of considering invasive alien tree species in urban planning...|$|R

I {{argue that the}} typical epidemiological model, utilized by most health intervention programs, and largely based on a person’s identif’ing characteristics such as migration status, religion, education and tribal affiliation, are insufficient tools for predicting a primary caregiver’s health seeking behaviour when children are afflicted with homa (fever), most often attributed to malaria. Rather, one’s sphere of interaction, defmed by one’s shared values attributed with status as a primary caregiver, participation in the informal economy and interspersed residential patterns typical of the <b>peri-urban</b> <b>environment</b> are the principal factors determining caregivers ’ strategies.

Ultimately, based on this research, I conclude that first, social interaction surpasses static categories in defining primary caregivers ’ health seeking strategies; second, in order for health intervention programs to be successful, they must be based upon a community’s specific dynamics; third, social networks forged through social interactions offer a formidable means of established communication via which health messages can be broadcast, and health intervention programs can be distributed. i...|$|E

Females of the {{two species}} have adapted to undergo preimaginal development in natural or artificial collections of freshwater near human habitations and feed on human blood. While there is an effective vaccine against yellow fever, the control of dengue and chikungunya is mainly dependent on reducing freshwater preimaginal development habitats {{of the two}} vectors. We show here that Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus lay eggs and their larvae survive to emerge as adults in brackish water (water with 30 ppt salt are termed fresh, brackish and saline respectively).

40|$|Urbanization is {{becoming}} increasingly {{important in terms of}} climate change and ecosystem functionality worldwide. We are only beginning to understand how the processes of urbanization influence ecosystem dynamics and how <b>peri-urban</b> <b>environments</b> contribute to climate change. Brisbane in South East Queensland (SEQ) currently has the most extensive urban sprawl of all Australian cities. This leads to substantial land use changes in urban and <b>peri-urban</b> <b>environments</b> and the subsequent gaseous emissions from soils are to date neglected for IPCC climate change estimations. This research examines how land use change effects methane (CH 4) and nitrous oxide (N 2 O) fluxes from peri-urban soils and consequently influences the Global Warming Potential (GWP) of rural ecosystems in agricultural use undergoing urbanization. Therefore, manual and fully automated static chamber measurements determined soil gas fluxes over a full year and an intensive sampling campaign of 80 days after land use change. Turf grass, as the major peri-urban land cover, increased the GWP by 415 kg CO 2 -e ha 1 over the first 80 days after conversion from a well-established pasture. This results principally from increased daily average N 2 O emissions of 0. 5 g N 2 O ha- 1 d- 1 from the pasture to 18. 3 g N 2 O ha- 1 d- 1 from the turf grass due to fertilizer application during conversion. Compared to the native dry sclerophyll eucalypt forest, turf grass establishment increases the GWP by another 30 kg CO 2 -e ha 1. The results presented in this study clearly indicate the substantial impact of urbanization on soil-atmosphere gas exchange in form of non-CO 2 greenhouse gas emissions particularly after turf grass establishment...|$|R

With these changes, the need to understand and to include urban biodiversity patterns in research and management programmes is becoming vital. Recent {{studies have shown that}} remote sensing tools can be useful in studies examining biodiversity patterns in natural landscapes. The present study aimed to explore whether remote sensing tools can be applied in biodiversity research in an urban landscape. More specifically, the study examined whether the Landsat-derived Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and linear spectral unmixing of urban land cover can predict bird richness in the city of Jerusalem. Bird richness was sampled in 40 1 -ha sites over a range of urban environments in 329 surveys. NDVI and the per cent cover of built-up area were strongly and negatively correlated with each other, and were both very successful in explaining the number of bird species in the study sites.

This study was undertaken to determine the co-existence and prevalence of Philodina roseola and other Bdelloid rotifers in the container habitats of Ae. aegypti mosquitoes. The investigation was conducted in 43 villages which belong to four districts in South India, affected by the epidemic of either dengue or Chikungunya fever.

Its capabilities overpass those of preceding optical particle counters (OPCs) allowing the characterization of all kind of aerosols from submicronic-sized absorbing carbonaceous particles in polluted air to very coarse particles (> 10 – 20 µm in diameter) in desert dust plumes or fog and clouds. LOAC's light and compact design allows measurements under all kinds of balloons, on-board unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and at Published by Copernicus Publications {{on behalf of the}} European Geosciences Union. 3674 J. -B. Renard et al. : LOAC: a counter/sizer for ground-based and balloon measurements – Part 2 ground level. We illustrate here the first LOAC airborne results obtained from a UAV and a variety of scientific balloons. The UAV was deployed in a <b>peri-urban</b> <b>environment</b> near Bordeaux in France. Balloon operations include (i) tethered balloons deployed in urban environments in Vi-enna (Austria) and Paris (France), (ii) pressurized balloons drifting in the lower troposphere over the western Mediter-ranean (during the Chemistry-Aerosol Mediterranean Experiment – ChArMEx campaigns), (iii) meteorological sounding balloons launched in the western Mediterranean region (ChArMEx) and from Aire-sur-l'Adour in southwestern France (VOLTAIRE-LOAC campaign). More focus is put on measurements performed in the Mediterranean during (ChArMEx) and especially during African dust transport events to illustrate the original capability of balloon-borne LOAC to monitor in situ coarse mineral dust particles. In particular, LOAC has detected unexpected large particles in desert sand plumes...|$|E
50|$|Small-scale {{livestock}} production entails less intensive production cycles, access to outdoors or pasture, typically judicious use of antibiotics, and {{a connection to}} local niche markets. This type of {{livestock production}} can be maintained in peri-urban and rural settings. There are advantages and disadvantages to each. While {{it is more difficult}} and costly to find land for livestock in peri-urban settings, incorporating livestock to small-scale farms can greatly increase the local food supply, reduce garden waste, and provide manure. <b>Peri-urban</b> <b>environments</b> can also provide excellent foraging for bees, with less exposure to the pests, diseases, and even pesticides that can be devastating to a colony. Conversely, rural small-scale livestock production is traditionally more common, and allows for larger-scale operations (although much smaller than industrial systems). However, access to formal markets, both to acquire inputs and to sell outputs, is critical for economic sustainability. Close rural-urban linkages are important to overcome constraints of feed scarcity and to better utilize the advantages of each system.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the housing-stewardship nexus in peri-urban areas {{based on the}} case of Ruwa and Epworth, satellite settlements of Harare, the capital city of Zimbabwe. The study seeks to establish the factors that shape <b>peri-urban</b> <b>environments</b> into better managed and sustainable areas of which housing development is perceived as the major activity taking place in this zone. Using the Stewardship Theory or Partnership Model as the main framework and point of departure, five basic approaches namely biblical-religious, business, environmental, vernacular, place-based community/grassroots approaches to the study are noted. The â€˜mixed-methodsâ€™ approach is used to analyse sustainability issues forming the crux of stewardship. Predominantly, the qualitative-interpretative paradigm informs the study of which the case and narrative study (case narratology) are the core research design approaches. Specific data collection tools have included extensive documentary analysis (newspaper articles, minutes, policy and legislative documents); household survey (involving 291 randomly selected households, 137 from Ruwa and 154 from Epworth, in which a semi-structured questionnaire has been used). observations (aided with photography) on operations and housing and environmental arterfacts were also carried out coupled with key informant interviews with purposefully selected officials (from Ruwa Town Council, Epworth Local Board, the Ministry of National Housing and Social Amenities, Environmental Management Agency and the Department of Physical Planning). Quantitative data has been analysed using SPSS Version 18. On the other hand, qualitative data analysis used content, discourse, statement and textual analysis. From the study, criteria for classifying actors are central in achieving meaningful stewardship of place and creation of sustainable <b>peri-urban</b> <b>environments.</b> Often there are conflicts among the actors given their contrasting priorities and interests. History of the place, income levels among the peri-urban dwellers, lack of defined and clear-cut policies and commitment by institutions towards the creation of sustainable settlements are the factors perpetuating these conflicts. The study recommends application and use of technologies for remote sensing (Geographic Information Systems included) to help in the monitoring of peri-urban areas development, achieving evidence-based policy which is an effective tool for stewardship, co-creating an institution whose focus is urban regional development and using scenario and collaborative planning methodologies to avoid chaotic peri-urbanisation...|$|R

Until recently, planners and policy makers have relied on regulatory 'command and control' planning approaches; however, there is growing interest {{in the use of}} market-based instruments to address natural resource management issues in complex and highly contested <b>peri-urban</b> <b>environments.</b> Tradable development rights are one type of market-based instrument. While tradable development rights have been used extensively in the United States, their application in Australia has been limited. Yet, in Australia, population growth and development in peri-urban areas is placing extensive pressure on natural resources and productive agricultural lands. These pressures are particularly acute in Australia's fastest growing metropolitan region, South East Queensland. By using a case study approach we explore stakeholder perspectives on the value of this tool to protect peri-urban landscape values. Whilst current planner and stakeholder perspectives suggest there is considerable support, there are substantial political, institutional, knowledge, resource and legislative barriers that need to be overcome before this tool can be a viable, realistic and acceptable option for land use planning in peri-urban regions such as South East Queensland.
