METHODS: To achieve the objective a cross-sectional design was used in three government schools of Mahmoodabad and Chanesar Goth, Jamshed Town, Karachi. Students of either gender drawn from these schools fulfilling the inclusion and exclusion criteria were interviewed using a pre-coded structured questionnaire. Along with demographic data, questions regarding frequency of Chaalia and Pan Masala use, practices of this habit in friends and family and <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>procurement</b> of these substances, were inquired. Knowledge was assessed about harmful effects and its source of information. In addition, practices in relation to that knowledge were assessed.

40|$|In {{apparent}} realisation of the <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>procurement</b> {{in driving}} {{the implementation of}} socio-economic policies, successive governments across the globe are increasingly demanding more from suppliers {{as it pertains to}} the delivery of socio-economic benefits. This has resulted in a significant shift in what constitutes success in the respective projects which they commission; from factors related to the ‘iron triangle’ to contributions of the project to the growth of the local economy. Policies such as the Social Value Act, and the Nigerian Oil and Gas Industry Content Development Act (NOGICDA) in the United Kingdom and Nigeria respectively readily come to mind. Judging by the plethora of literature bemoaning the prevailing high poverty and unemployment rates in developing and resource-rich countries such as Nigeria; {{it would appear that the}} implementation of such policies has failed to deliver the expected outcomes. This opinion is affirmed by several studies which point to the possibility of implementation failure in such countries. Surprisingly, none of these studies has made any attempt to explore the manner in which implementation is organised and governed. Obviously, the seeming absence of a veritable platform for implementation analysis constitutes an immense challenge to effective analysis. As a result of this, previous investigators appear to have failed to properly tackle this imbroglio from a holistic and systemic perspective. To bridge this gap, this qualitative study embarked upon an evaluation of the implementation process using the NOGICD Act as an exemplar. The failure of the nation’s economic sectors to achieve sufficient backward linkage with the oil and gas industry, as evidenced by the reported failure of local suppliers to gain entry into the supply chains of major infrastructure projects contributed to this choice. The Viable Systems and Temporary Multi-Organisations theoretical lenses were applied in the conceptualisation of the inherent complex interorganisational relationships thus resulting in the development of a Viable Infrastructure Delivery Systems Model (VIDM); a model premised on systemic and cybernetic principles. The VIDM was then applied in conceptualising and evaluating the extant interorganisational relationships within selected infrastructure delivery system case studies in Nigeria and the United Kingdom depicting the multi-case study nature of the study. A mixture of unstructured, semi-structured, and structured interviews were employed at various stages of the study. Also, policy and publicly available contract documents were explored. Subsequently, the emergent data was qualitatively analysed using pre-set themes, with NVivo software. The findings obtained were used to test various propositions on a within-case and cross-case basis. It was observed that the VIDM was better positioned to conceptualise and evaluate the various interorganisational interactions within infrastructure delivery systems and how they influence implementation success. Furthermore, the application of the VIDM within the selected cases enabled the discovery of various issues within the IDS capable of undermining successful implementation such as non-alignment of goals within the IDS, excessive government interference, lack of appropriate criteria for measurement of benefits and cognition-related issues. It is expected that the VIDM would be used by implementation advisors for conceptualising and evaluating interorganisational relationships during policy or strategy implementation cycles and/or for (re) designing implementation processes for viability within the Nigerian oil and gas industry...|$|E

40|$|Lost {{amidst the}} hype {{surrounding}} {{the prospects of}} Australian uranium sales to China, India and Taiwan has been the possibility of indirect Australian involvement {{in the construction of}} submarines for Taiwan. With only four ageing submarines currently in service Taiwan is badly in need of reviving its fleet. Although some hawkers canvassed the possibility of the Australian Submarine Corporation (ASC) exporting its Type 471 Collins submarines to Taiwan in the early 1990 s this was never a realistic option. Given Australia's endeavours to maintain positive relations with China, diplomacy deemed arms sales to Taiwan irrational. Yet the story does not end there. It is instead rerouted through the United States. In this study, the Howard government's interest in increasing the intimacy of its defence connections with the US {{over the past ten years}} now abrade against its newfound interest in commercial relations with China. Ultimately, what this narrative speaks to is the sometimes delicate nature for governments of the connections between trade and security and in particular the <b>place</b> <b>of</b> arms <b>procurement</b> in this nexus...|$|R
40|$|Development aid {{is defined}} as the {{financial}} aid given by governments and agencies to support the economic, environmental, social, and political needs of developing countries. With the government acquisition of goods, civil works, and services representing between 15 - 20 percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) for most countries, the value <b>of</b> <b>procurement</b> policy and its application are very high. Recent high profile cases in the news, ranging from the military purchase of clothing from foreign sources that raise human rights issues, to the criticism of the implementation of the Affordable Care Act website, to a range of corruption cases around the world, are bringing policymakers’ attention to a field traditionally treated as equivalent in notoriety to the plumbing and wiring of government facilities. These cases, however, illustrate the range of objectives that public policy now <b>places</b> <b>of</b> the public <b>procurement</b> <b>of</b> goods and services, and the need for a broader dialogue. Reforms worldwide are being discussed through the World Trade Organization (WTO) Government Procurement Agreement and the European Union {{as well as by the}} multilateral development institutions. Underlying these reforms is a tension between a rules-based system with limited, if any, discretion to avoid fraud and corruption versus an outcome based focus that requires greater use of discretion and judgment to ensure better adaptation to circumstances. The lecture will focus primarily on the public procurement debate for development aid; but the issues have a resonance well beyond developing countries...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{suggests}} that cultural landscapes were permeated by religious meanings in all pre-modern societies, including Sami societies before c. AD 1600. We suggest that {{knowledge of this}} sacred landscape was not restricted to an elite or to shamans, but was widely shared. For the Sami, religious rituals and associated images (e. g. rock art) involved all levels within a social hierarchy that linked the individual adult or child, the family, the band or sijdda, and the association of family groups or vuobme. We can decode the sacred landscapes of such societies if we can reconstruct sites of perceived anomaly and liminality in the landscape. This is discussed in the article with reference to Proto-Uralic cosmology {{in general and the}} Sami world-view in particular. The concepts of anomaly and liminality enable us to interpret the Badjelannda rock art site in Laponia, northern Sweden, as not only a <b>place</b> <b>of</b> resource <b>procurement</b> (asbestos, soapstone) but also a sacred site. We suggest that the Badjelannda site should be seen as a gateway to the Underworld, and therefore visits for quarrying, human burials at the site, or wild reindeer hunting in the vicinity were marked by ritual acts, directed perhaps towards the Sami female deity Máttaráhkká. The rock art should therefore be interpreted as an aspect of religious ritual, and in a context where anomalous topography signified that the Badjelannda site was necessarily a liminal place...|$|R

40|$|Purchasing {{function}} is, {{along with}} a sale, {{one of the most}} important functions of every commercial (trading) company. Management <b>of</b> <b>procurement</b> is related to selection and number of suppliers, policy relations with them, setting <b>of</b> purchasing (<b>procurement)</b> quotas as well as to methods and types of payments. The role <b>of</b> <b>procurement</b> in relations between suppliers and buyers has been changing with market developments. Purchasing is no longer just a passive function for selecting the best suppliers to send orders to, but it establishes partnership relations with suppliers. The objectives <b>of</b> <b>procurement</b> function, among others, are timely and safe delivery, professional relationships with suppliers, product quality, inventory optimization and cost reduction. Due to strong competitive pressures in the markets where they operate that limit the possibility of significant influence on individual forming of selling prices of goods and services, commercial (trading) companies are forced to find appropriate methods to reduce their operating costs. One of the business areas where a company can realize cost reductions is <b>procurement.</b> The complexity <b>of</b> business operations and market relations are influencing the value <b>of</b> costs <b>of</b> <b>procurement</b> <b>of</b> goods and services that represent a significant share in the sales value of commercial companies. In order to reduce and control procurement costs, enterprises must develop and implement appropriate cost management systems. Reducing procurement costs can be achieved in two key areas, namely in the area <b>of</b> prices <b>of</b> <b>procurement</b> objects and in the area of cost reduction <b>of</b> <b>procurement</b> function. Traditional approach <b>of</b> <b>procurement</b> cost management, which is oriented on management <b>of</b> prices <b>of</b> <b>procurement</b> objects and for which needed information is supplied by financial accounting, is not suitable to actual needs of the enterprises. Therefore, it is necessary to develop appropriate contemporary cost management models that are based on information of management accounting and, in general, of management information systems, in order to increase the profitability <b>of</b> commercial enterprises. <b>procurement</b> function, purchasing costs, management of purchasing costs...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the economic characteristics <b>of</b> construction <b>procurement</b> systems partially {{in terms of}} transaction cost economics and partly those of project management. It proposes the theoretical principle of an inconsistent trinity, according to which, in selecting a procurement system, the client will inevitably face a trade-off between the procurement system best able to deliver: (1) fastest completion of the project (and therefore higher discounted present value of revenue from the project); (2) least vulnerability when making changes (lower transaction hold-up costs arising from temporal or process specificity); as well as (3) least vulnerability to non-performance (lower transaction measurement costs from greater visibility to third parties for ordering of disputes). The model provides a potentially testable contribution to a transaction cost theory <b>of</b> construction <b>procurement.</b> It also has two implications: (1) the three main family types <b>of</b> <b>procurement</b> systems are held to be intrinsically different in economic terms, so selection <b>of</b> <b>procurement</b> system does matter; (2) no system can enjoy absolute advantage over others, so the proposed strategy <b>of</b> <b>procurement</b> system selection is to align the characteristics <b>of</b> <b>procurement</b> systems with attributes of projects.

It investigated and explored the issues and barriers to effective implementation <b>of</b> different <b>procurement</b> methods that the organisations used, the environment and its suitability for implementing different forms <b>of</b> <b>procurement</b> in context <b>of</b> public sector in Pakistan and the relationship it had to successful project outcomes. The research {{was carried out in}} two stages. In the first stage archival analysis was conducted of government documents, reports including reports by international organisations, policy documents and literature. As a result of this it was found that there are two different methods <b>of</b> <b>procurement</b> used for procuring infrastructure projects in public sector in Pakistan i. e. the traditional method for example competitive design-bid-build and the non-traditional method for example Public-Private-Partnership (PPP). During the second stage case studies were selected based on archival analysis. A total of 6 public sector organisations had been selected as organisational case studies and 8 projects had been selected among these organisations as project case studies. Out of the 6 organisations 5 were federal government and 1 provincial government organisation. The organisational coverage of sub-sectors of infrastructure includes transport, water and power sub-sectors. Geographically the organisations and projects covered all four provinces and tribal areas as well as the state of Azad and Jammu Kashmir. Projects were selected on the basis <b>of</b> <b>procurement</b> method. Out <b>of</b> the total 8, 3 of the projects were on Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT), 2 projects on Build-Own-Operate (BOO), 1 project on Build-Own-Operate-Transfer (BOOT) (only BOOT project in Pakistan) and 2 projects on traditional method <b>of</b> <b>procurement</b> were selected. A total of 24 respondents participated from these 6 organisations. The case studies were analysed using qualitative content analysis techniques of the in depth interviews. Cross case analysis had also been carried out based on looking at the similarities and differences across similar as well as different methods <b>of</b> <b>procurement.</b> As a result multiple issues have been identified which affected the choice <b>of</b> <b>procurement.</b> The barriers and constraints to implementation <b>of</b> <b>procurement</b> have also been described in detail.
