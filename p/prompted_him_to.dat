5|$|In August 2010, Baggio was {{appointed}} {{president of the}} technical sector of the Italian Football Federation (FIGC), replacing his former Italy national team manager Azeglio Vicini. On 23 January 2013, Baggio {{stepped down from the}} position, stating the FIGC had ignored his ideas about improving the system and focusing on youth talent, which <b>prompted</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> resign.|$|E
5|$|The {{expenditures}} that Caracalla {{made with}} the large bonuses he gave to soldiers <b>prompted</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> debase the coinage soon after his ascension. At the end of Severus' reign, and early into Caracalla's, the Roman denarius had an approximate silver purity of around 55%, {{but by the end}} of his reign the purity had been reduced to about 51%.|$|E
5|$|Fairley's declining health <b>prompted</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> leave London {{and move}} to The Grove, Sonning, Berkshire, where he died on 19 April 1966, and {{was buried in the}} {{graveyard}} of St Andrew's Church, Sonning. He was survived by his wife and their two sons, who were both medical doctors, and also by the son of his first marriage, who had become an Australian Army officer.

5|$|Lame duck {{president}} John Quincy Adams nominated Crittenden to the U.S. Supreme Court on December 17, 1828 but Senators {{who supported}} president-elect Jackson voted to postpone confirmation until Jackson could nominate his own man. After his brief service as Kentucky Secretary of State, {{the state legislature}} elected Crittenden to the second of his four non-consecutive stints in the U.S. Senate. Upon his election as president, William Henry Harrison appointed Crittenden as Attorney General, but 5 months after Harrison's death, political differences <b>prompted</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> resign rather than continue his service under Harrison's successor, John Tyler.|$|E
5|$|Mahendra's {{passion for}} cinema <b>prompted</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> leave for India {{and join the}} Film and Television Institute of India, Pune in 1966. He had to take up {{cinematography}} as he could not gain admissions to other disciplines. At the institute he was exposed to world cinema as he got an opportunity to watch films made by François Truffaut and Jean-Luc Godard, both associated with the French New Wave movement. In 1969, Mahendra graduated from the institute with a gold medal.|$|E
5|$|Marochetti {{was born}} in Italy and was ennobled by the Kingdom of Sardinia but {{lived and worked in}} France, {{creating}} a number of prestigious works for the royalist French government in the 1830s. He made his name by creating equestrian statues; one, of the Duke of Wellington, was erected in Glasgow in 1840. By the 1840s, however, his popularity in continental Europe was in decline. The French Revolution of 1848, which saw the final overthrow of the French monarchy, <b>prompted</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> resettle in London and seek new patrons among the British elite.|$|E

5|$|Virtue's Last Reward was {{developed}} by Chunsoft and directed by Kotaro Uchikoshi, who had previously led the production of Nine Hours, Nine Persons, Nine Doors. While his original intention was to make Nine Hours, Nine Persons, Nine Doors a stand-alone title, its unexpected critical success in North America <b>prompted</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> continue the series. In an attempt to reduce costs, Uchikoshi asked Chunsoft if he could develop Virtue's Last Reward and its eventual sequel simultaneously, as both games would use the same engine and digital assets; Chunsoft agreed to his proposal, and green-lit production.|$|E
5|$|After {{the success}} of The Combat, Etty {{continued}} with his preferred theme of history paintings containing nudity; of the 15 pictures he exhibited at the Royal Academy during the 1820s (including Cleopatra, Pandora and The Combat) all but one contained a nude figure. He was elected a full Royal Academician in 1828, {{at that time the}} most prestigious honour available to an artist. The Combat was the first very large work attempted by Etty, and its success <b>prompted</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> produce further works on a similar scale over the rest of his career; he produced nine very large paintings illustrating moral themes throughout his career. As time went by his canvases came to be increasingly dominated by nude women.|$|E
5|$|Burgmeier {{was born}} in Triesen, Liechtenstein, a small town with a {{population}} of 4,500, close to the border with Switzerland. He is the younger son of Heinz and Elsbeth, following Patrick Burgmeier, who played football for Vaduz and USV Eschen/Mauren. From a young age, Franz played both football and skied. He played for the Liechtenstein youth team in Swiss competitions from ages 11 to 16, winning the championship when he was 13. However, at 16, a knee injury, which he suffered while skiing, nearly ended his football career and <b>prompted</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> stop the former sport.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{irregularities}} in {{the approval of}} the Lecompton Constitution by Kansas voters, Breckinridge agreed with Buchanan that it was legitimate, but he kept his position secret, and some believed he agreed with his friend, Stephen Douglas, that Lecompton was invalid. Breckinridge's absence from the Senate during debate on admitting Kansas to the Union under Lecompton seemed to confirm this, but his leave—to take his wife from Baton Rouge, Louisiana, where she was recovering from an illness, to Washington, D.C.—had been planned for months. The death of his grandmother, Polly Breckinridge, <b>prompted</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> leave earlier than planned. During his absence, both houses of Congress voted to re-submit the Lecompton Constitution to Kansas voters for approval. On resubmission, it was overwhelmingly rejected.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the end of}} World War I, he was {{assigned}} to several positions that would qualify him for the high commands he was to hold in later years. He was promoted to first lieutenant on June 4, 1920 and spent two years at Marine Barracks, Quantico, Virginia, as the Adjutant-Registrar of the Marine Corps Institute, after which he was sent on a short tour in Louisiana guarding the mail. His interest in military aviation <b>prompted</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> apply for flight training at NAS Pensacola, Florida and he earned his gold wings as a Naval Aviator in 1922. Soon after, he was ordered to the Marine Air Station at Guam where he had his introduction to the semitropical islands of the Marianas with which his name was later to become so closely linked.|$|E
5|$|Jean-Joseph Rabearivelo (4 March 1901 or 1903– 22 June 1937), born Joseph-Casimir Rabearivelo, {{is widely}} {{considered}} to be Africa's first modern poet and the greatest literary artist of Madagascar. Part {{of the first generation}} raised under French colonization, Rabearivelo grew up impoverished and failed to complete secondary education. His passion for French literature and traditional Malagasy poetry <b>prompted</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> read extensively and educate himself on a variety of subjects, including the French language and its poetic and prose traditions. He published his first poems as an adolescent in local literary reviews, soon obtaining employment at a publishing house where he worked as a proofreader and editor of its literary journals. He published numerous poetry anthologies in French and Malagasy, as well as literary critiques, an opera, and two novels.|$|E

5|$|Kim himself {{considered}} his treatise a failure. Films it {{had contributed to}} were enjoyed at home, but abroad they were ridiculed. North Korean cinema could not compete {{with the quality of}} foreign, and in particular South Korean, films. This directly <b>prompted</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> kidnap Shin Sang-ok, South Korea's most famous film director, in 1978. Shin and his wife, actress Choi Eun-hee, were kept in North Korea for eight years under cruel conditions. Nevertheless, Shin studied On the Art of the Cinema to please Kim with the kaijū film Pulgasari, which credits Kim as the executive producer. Kim was delighted with the film and allowed Shin and Choi to travel to Vienna, where they were supposed to negotiate a deal for a sequel. The couple used the opportunity to escape, and ended up in America.|$|E
5|$|McCudden's {{long-term}} interest in mechanics <b>prompted</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> modify his own aircraft to increase combat performance. He {{made a series}} of modifications to his aircraft which caused them to excel in performance in comparison to any other S.E.5 at the front and perhaps any other German fighter available at the time. Performance, a generic term, required improvements in all-round capability. McCudden's changes were made with one main objective in mind: high-altitude performance. He had achieved some success without these personal experiments. On 23 December 1917, for example, he intercepted an enemy aircraft at 18,000 feet and drove it down to 8,000 feet before shooting it down for his 30th victory. Incidentally, he was nearly killed in action when one of the wings broke away from his victim and nearly struck his own aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the end of}} 1976, Bowie's {{interest}} in the burgeoning German music scene, {{as well as his}} drug addiction, <b>prompted</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> move to West Berlin to clean up and revitalise his career. There he was often seen riding a bicycle between his apartment on Hauptstraße in Schöneberg and Hansa Tonstudio, the recording studio he used, located on Köthener Straße in Kreuzberg, near the Berlin Wall. While working with Brian Eno and sharing an apartment with Iggy Pop, he began to focus on minimalist, ambient music for the first of three albums, co-produced with Tony Visconti, that became known as his Berlin Trilogy. During the same period, Iggy Pop, with Bowie as a co-writer and musician, completed his solo album debut The Idiot and its follow-up Lust for Life, touring the UK, Europe, and the US in March and April 1977.|$|E
