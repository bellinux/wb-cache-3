50|$|A slot machine's {{theoretical}} <b>payout</b> <b>percentage</b> {{is set at}} {{the factory}} when the software is written.

Based on current technology, this is a time-consuming process and as such is done infrequently. In certain jurisdictions, such as New Jersey, the EPROM has a tamper-evident seal and can only be changed in the presence of Gaming Control Board officials.

The literature of economics suggests that different outcomes are attached to varying industry structures.

Accordingly, this article will test two hypotheses: (1) whether monopoly casinos will offer artificially higher prices to customers, and (2) whether monopoly casinos will offer their customers lower service quality by using fewer employees and offering fewer amenities at their gaming properties. This article will categorize thirteen U. S. commercial casino jurisdictions along a continuum from the most closed and monopolistic to the most open and competitive jurisdictions. Specifically, this article will compare price points and service attributes for the varying casino structures. This includes: slot machine <b>payout</b> <b>percentages,</b> number of employees, and quantity of amenities, such as number of hotel rooms, volume of convention space, number of restaurants, and number of entertainment venues. The relationship of these factors will be analyzed to test the basic hypotheses presented above...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we aim to}} study the impact on {{dividends}} policy of gender diversity {{on the board of}} directors (hereinafter BD). We hypothesise that the proportion of women directors, the proportion of independent, institutional and executive female directors, and the percentage of shares held by female directors on BD, have an impact on the dividends policy of Spanish companies. Our findings, analysing the whole sample, show that the proportion of female directors, and shares held by female directors, are positively associated with dividend <b>payout,</b> while the <b>percentage</b> of institutional female directors has a negative impact. The percentage of independent and executive female directors has no effect on dividend payout. When companies with losses are removed from the sample, the findings report that the percentage of female directors on BD and the percentage of independent female directors impact positively on dividend policy, while the percentage of institutional and executive female directors has a negative effect. The proportion of shares held by female directors on BD does not have an effect on dividend payout when only companies with profits are examined. Thus, the results confirm that gender diversity has an influence on dividend payout, so the existing legislation should encourage more participation by women in governing bodies. Our evidence supports the Act for Effective Equality between Women and Men, which establishes that listing companies have to achieve a quota of 40 % of women in decision-making bodies by 2015...|$|R

40|$|In {{the course}} of my {{research}} I found a great deal of speculative writing on fundraising, but very little quantitative research and virtually nothing on the impact of not tying the annual fund into long-term strategic planning. I found a great deal of literature related to strategic planning and some studies done on financial vulnerability for nonprofits. Most importantly—through the work of Bill Massy relating to managing budget efficiency, long-term planning and endowment—I was able to ground my study in his framework for sources of operating revenue. I developed a very simple equation whereby the operating budget is equal to the annual fund plus endowment payout plus net tuition. Revenue from research indirect cost and government subsidy is not applicable to private institutions, and I found net revenue from auxiliary enterprise to be insignificant and, therefore, did not include it in the study. ^ The question arose as to where the benchmark should lie for setting the annual fund and endowment <b>payout</b> as <b>percentages</b> of the operating budget. I used the Voluntary Support of Education report as a database to test private masters granting institutions. To find the benchmark, I conducted two analyses of variance using categorical independent variables for both the ratio of annual fund to operating budget and the endowment payout ratio to the operating budget. ^ What emerged from the study was a benchmark, but more importantly a sense of the psychology driving the bad business practice attributable to many presidents. The psychology is related to the high subjective time discount of many presidents i. e. the executive tendency to spend rather than save. Perhaps most interesting of all is the taxonomy created by the study, whereby using the 4 percent benchmark, institutions are divided into four groups: those with low annual fund and low endowment payouts, those with high annual funds and low endowment payouts, those with low annual funds and high endowment payouts, and those with high annual funds and high endowment payouts. ^ I anticipate that the findings in this study will draw attention to the issue of subjective time discount among presidents and alter the perception that presidential perspective is most accurate for setting budgets and strategic planning. Moreover, I believe the taxonomy can be used to inform the decision making process for strategic planning. (Abstract shortened by UMI.) ...|$|R
