40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the most important}} properties of the <b>PIN</b> <b>diode</b> and illustrates methodology for it calculation. A <b>PIN</b> <b>diode</b> is a semiconductor device that operates as a variable resistor at RF and microwave frequencies. The resistance value of the <b>PIN</b> <b>diode</b> is determined only by the forward biased dc current. In switch and attenuator applications, the <b>PIN</b> <b>diode</b> should ideally control the RF signal level without introducing distortion which might change {{the shape of the}} RF signal. An important additional feature of the <b>PIN</b> <b>diode</b> is its ability to control large RF signals while using much smaller levels of dc excitation. In addition, the PIN's small size, weight, high switching speed, and minimized parasitic elements make it ideally suited for use in miniature, broadband RF signal control components...|$|R
40|$|The {{performance}} of the <b>PIN</b> <b>diode</b> is very much depends on the chip geometry and the semiconductor material used, especially in the intrinsic region. The biasing voltage applied to the <b>PIN</b> <b>diode</b> determines the amount holes and electrons injected into the intrinsic region and the values of its resistivity. This will give effect to the I-V {{performance of}} the <b>PIN</b> <b>diode</b> on its resistivity. This research studied the effects of width (and subsequently area) variations of intrinsic region of Silicon <b>PIN</b> <b>diode</b> on its I-V performance. The two dimensional structures and recipes of <b>PIN</b> <b>diode</b> are designed and simulated using Sentaurus TCAD tools. The thickness of <b>PIN</b> <b>diode</b> is kept at 40 um while only the width is varied accordingly. Three variations of width have been chosen of width 90 um, 80 um and 70 um in order to study the impacts of width accordingly. Three variations of width have been chosen of width variation has on the I-V performance. Based on the simulation result, {{it is found that}} the current level is proportional to the PIN structure width...|$|R

50|$|<b>PIN</b> <b>diodes</b> {{might be}} used, for example, as {{the bridge and}} shunt {{resistors}} in a bridged-T attenuator. Another common approach is to use <b>PIN</b> <b>diodes</b> as terminations connected to the 0 degree and -90 degree ports of a quadrature hybrid. The signal to be attenuated {{is applied to the}} input port, and the attenuated result is taken from the isolation port. The advantages of this approach over the bridged-T and pi approaches are (1) complementary PIN diode bias drives are not needed—the same bias is applied to both diodes—and (2) the loss in the attenuator equals the return loss of the terminations, which can be varied over a very wide range.|$|E

40|$|A codesigned compact {{dual-band}} filtering antenna {{incorporating a}} <b>PIN</b> <b>diode</b> for 2. 45 / 5. 2 [*]GHz wireless {{local area network}} (WLAN) applications is proposed in this paper. The integrated filtering antenna system consists of a simple monopole radiator, a microstrip dual-band band-pass filter, and a <b>PIN</b> <b>diode.</b> The performance of the filtering antenna is notably promoted by optimizing the impedance between the antenna and the band-pass filter, with good selectivity and out-of-band rejection.

The results showed that the resonant frequency of the discrete <b>PIN</b> <b>diode</b> on the DGS was shifted to higher frequency during ON state and was shifted to lower frequency during OFF state. Then, by realizing the SPST switch circuit using FR 4 substrate in 1. 5 GHz frequency band, the measured result clearly showed that high isolation (> 30 dB) of the proposed SPST switch during OFF state was produced by using DGS compared to a SPST switch without DGS.

40|$|Detailed {{theoretical}} {{analysis of}} three different modes or types of high efficiency oscillation in a <b>PIN</b> <b>diode</b> are presented. For the TRAPATT mode in a <b>PIN</b> <b>diode,</b> it is shown that a traveling avalanche zone {{is not necessary to}} generate a dense trapped plasma. An economical computer program for TRAPATT oscillations in a <b>PIN</b> <b>diode</b> is described. Typical results of diode power, dc-to-RF conversion efficiency, and required circuit impedances are presented for several different current waveforms. A semianalytical solution for a second type of high efficiency mode in a <b>PIN</b> <b>diode</b> is derived assuming a rectangular current waveform. A quasi-static approximation is employed to derive a semianalytical solution for the voltage across a <b>PIN</b> <b>diode</b> in a third mode, where avalanching occurs during a major portion of a half cycle. Calculations for this mode indicate that the power increases proportionally to the magnitude of the drive current with a small decrease in efficiency relative to the ordinary TRAPATT mode. An analytical solution is also given for a <b>PIN</b> <b>diode,</b> where it is assumed that the ionization coefficient is a step function. It is shown that the step-ionization approximation permits one to draw possible patterns of avalanche region in the depletion layer as a function of time. A rule governing admissible patterns is derived and an example solution given for one admissible pattern. Preliminary experimental results on the high-efficiency oscillations are presented and discussed. Two different experimental circuits, which used channel-dropping filters to provide independent harmonic tuning, are described. Simpler circuits used to produce high-efficiency oscillations are discussed. Results of experiments using inexpensive Fairchild FD 300 diodes are given...|$|R
