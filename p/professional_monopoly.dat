Nigerian Pharmacy technicians {{in collaboration with}} NBTE are able to achieve these by introducing ND/HND in pharmaceutical technology. PCN is doing everything possible to stop this training in order to sustain its monopoly, demanding Federal ministry of education to direct NBTE to stop accrediting the polytechnics while these course are offered in Ghana, Sudan and other countries. The meeting called at the instance of National Board for Technical Education (NBTE) on 25th May 2016 where the Pharmacists Council of Nigeria (PCN), representative of the Honourable Minister of Health, Federal Ministry of Education, Pharmaceutical Society of Nigeria (PSN) and National Association of Pharmaceutical Technologists and Pharmacy Technicians of Nigeria were in attendance; certain issues bothering on the nomenclature Pharmaceutical Technologists, the curriculum and the accrediting body for polytechnic graduates of pharmaceutical Technology were raised. There it was made clear that the nomenclature (Pharmaceutical Technologist) is not new in Nigeria as the training of people bearing the name were trained at the former School of Pharmaceutical Technologists between 19811 and 1985. The premises of the school is being used as the liaison office of the Pharmacists Council of Nigeria (PCN) today. It was also established that National Board for Technical Education (NBTE) is saddled with the accreditation of courses offered by Polytechnics and Monotechnics in the Federal Republic of Nigeria.

The typical operating mode of traditional medicine {{in the region is}} characterized by a relatively stable, though asymmetrical, relationship with the biomedically-oriented health care system with a varying degree of collaboration. The present paper looks at the major conflict between OM and pharmacy in South Korea in the 1990 s. Most of the discussions over the so-called 'Hanyak Punjaeng' (OM vs pharmacy dispute) have so far been carried out in the perspective of interest/pressure group politics. But this paper presents an alternative analysis about the genesis, process and resolution of the dispute. It is argued that Robert Alford's 'structural interests' model, rather than the conventional pluralist perspective, offers the most plausible explanation of the conflict. Three key findings are ascertained. First, a sectional, inter-professional conflict can erupt into a major social cataclysm beyond the confines of health care services, an unlikely incident of a 'low politics' case becoming a 'high politics' affair. Second, a bipartite <b>professional</b> <b>monopoly</b> based on the principle of professional credentialism came to be established. Third, the dispute brought about a notable change in the structural power distribution between the corporate rationalizer and professional monopolist.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the present and}} future role of the health professions in health services delivery systems in low-income countries. Unlike richer countries, most low-income countries do not have a tradition of labour market regulation and the capacity of the professions themselves to regulate the provision of health services by their members tends to be weak. The paper looks at the impact of <b>professional</b> <b>monopolies</b> on the performance of health services delivery systems, e. g. equity of access, effectiveness of services, efficiency in the use of scarce resources, responsiveness to users' needs, including protection against the financial impact of utilising health services. It identifies issues which policy-makers face in relation to opening the health labour market while guaranteeing the safety and security of services provided by professionals. The suggestion is made that a "social contract", granting privileges of practice in exchange of a commitment to actively maintain and enhance the quality of their services, may be a viable course of action. This would require that the actors in the policy process collaborate in strengthening the capacity of regulatory agencies to perform their role.

40|$|This paper explores {{aspects of}} the {{development}} of the Community Legal Service (CLS) sector in England and Wales in the light of conflicts arising around the concept of professionalism. Specifically, we will be concerned with the juxtaposition of two occupational groupings with distinct approaches to knowledge culture and ethos: the law firms involved in publicly funded legal advice, and the Not for Profit (NfP) advice sector, including Citizens’ Advice Bureaux (CABx) and specialist agencies such as Shelter and Mind. The paper briefly discusses this development, and other alternative models of service provision suggested in the Clementi Review, {{in the context of the}} costs pressures of the legal aid budget, and the adoption by the Department of Constitutional affairs of an economic model which em braces the market control critique of the legal profession. Illich’s more radical variant of this critique is reviewed, alongside his prediction that ‘learning nets’, facilitated by new technology, offered a radical challenge to <b>professional</b> <b>monopolies</b> over expert knowledge. The contrasting models of training and development in the NfP and firm sector are then discussed: the NfP sector characterised by an emphasis on collective learning and maintaining organisational culture and ethos, the firm sector by an emphasis on accredited, individually portable human capital. The paper then speculates as to whether this contrast offers the prospect of a more pluralist model of educating and training legal service providers, or whether the pressures of quality regimes will erode these differences...|$|R

At various times during the past century, these two professions have clashed over the scope and definition of their respective services. Lawyers traditionally have relied upon a <b>professional</b> <b>monopoly</b> to provide “legal” services as a device to exclude nonlawyers from the practice of law. Supported by statutes in many jurisdictions making the unauthorized practice of law a criminal offense and ethics rules prohibiting lawyers from assisting in the unauthorized practice of law, lawyers have always been able to identify some inner sanctum of professional services that only they could handle. Because of jurisdictional differences in both substantive and procedural law, state-by-state licensing of lawyers created a somewhat balkanized practice milieu, notwithstanding the fact that many areas of practice were based on federal, rather than state, law...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Lack {{of access}} to oral care is a severe problem in the United States with over one-third of the {{population}} lacking dental insurance. In this group, 32 million people lack dental insurance and access to public dental services (Medicaid or Medicare), and 7 million of them need dental care. In some high-risk populations, such as Native Americans, two-thirds have unmet dental needs. Only 1 percent of Medicaid-eligible babies have a dental examination before twelve months of age. In this paper the social covenant of the dental profession is examined and suggestions made for improving access to care through improved efficiency. It is proposed that 1) private dentists should accept 5 percent per annum of their patients for indigent care funded by improved efficiency from utilizing allied dental providers (ADP) in new roles, and 2) ADP should have their own independent state boards. If dentists refuse to honor their social covenant, then ADP {{should be allowed to}} practice independently, breaking the <b>professional</b> <b>monopoly...</b>|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the impact of}} the process of professionalism on alternative medicine in Britain, particularly as regards its relationship with orthodox medicine. In the nineteenth century the development of alternative medicine was linked to the professionalisation of medicine, in so far as the rise of medical orthodoxy played a central part in its definition as a marginal activity. The <b>professional</b> <b>monopoly</b> so created subsequently became further from other occupational groups in the health care division of labour, as it expanded to include a number of subordinated professions allied to medicine. The latest challenge from the 1960 s onwards has come from the resurgence of alternative medicine, not least because a number of groups associated with unorthodox therapies have now themselves begun to take the path to professionalisation. This new trend and its implications for both medical dominance and the wider public are discussed in this paper, as the wheel of professionalisation appears to be turning full circle in Britain as the new millenium approaches...|$|E

It is argued that transfer fees can involve monopoly rents; the selling club extracts a share of the nonnegative differential between its reservation price and the buying club’s maximum bid-price. It is shown that a necessary condition for the presence of monopoly rents can be established by testing whether buying-club characteristics are jointly significant determinants of transfer fees after controlling for player characteristics, time effects and selling-club characteristics. Using a sample of 1, 350 English professional football transfer fees covering the period June 1990 to August 1996, it is found that monopoly rents may exist but the degree of monopoly rents may differ with the size of the transfer fee.

The paper starts by identifying relevant literature on the topic. It further focuses on {{the identification of the}} characteristics of a profession.

Attention is paid to the role of municipal administration education and training in promoting professionalism.

These roles are acknowledging politics, acting as leaders, promoting ethics and acknowledging workplace diversity.

40|$|Lawyers are underserving or {{overcharging}} many {{persons of}} moderate income {{who are in}} need of legal services. This can be unfortunate for the client group affected. It also has major ethical implications. The bar, a profession with semi-monopoly privileges, has an ethical obligation, in return for its <b>professional</b> status and <b>monopoly</b> benefits, to make its services available at a fair price to all needing legal services who can afford to pay. The ethical obligation is enhanced by the fact that if lawyers do not serve moderate-income persons in need of their help, others less qualified are likely to provide the needed services. The bar very properly has been greatly concerned with the ethical standards and behavior of individual lawyers and law firms. It should be equally concerned with the profession 2 ̆ 7 s overall ethical obligation to the society at large and to major groups within the society.

Other evidence will {{be a function of}} differing theoretical orientations employed against that basic data. These orientations, though analytically separable, should and may cohere in a framework for the study of mythology. The approach taken here postulates myth as a subset of religion, the cultural institution. Do all myths deal with religious subjects? Postponing for now the issue of classification of folk traditions, the author considers a negative case among the North American Indians. Ake Hultkrantz found an "ideological dichotomy among the Great Basin Shoshone, whose myths lacked any cultic function. ” Working from a conservative definition of myth as epic traditions of the gods acting in "illo tempore," he discovered that Shoshone origin myths lacked any ritual reference and conversely, that important rituals such as the Sun Dance did not display an accompanying origin myth. Hultkrantz proposed an evolutionary model to explain the apparent isolation of myth from religious rituals one aspect of social structure, the differentiation of religious specialists (absent among the Shoshone), can establish the <b>professional</b> <b>monopoly</b> of storytelling necessary for the integration of myth with ritual (Hultkrantz 1972 339 - 53) ...|$|E

As much envied as reviled, the reputation and prestige of lawyers is now {{considered by many to}} be at an all-time low. Its image as a noble and honourable profession is in tatters. Society tends to view lawyers as a rich and elite profession that is more interested in its own pocketbook than the public interest. The number of savage jokes about lawyers would be funny if they did not touch a raw nerve: after all, humour is not so much an escape from reality as from despair.

Indeed, health systems comprise of numerous actors, {{and one of the most}} important and influential is the medical doctor, playing a vital role in policy transfer at the national level (Benson 2013). The influence of medical professionals stems beyond shaping the implementation of health policies, to also potentially altering the policy content and process (Koon & Mayhew 2013). In lowand middle-income countries (LMICs) the health system is a dynamic mix of multiple stakeholders, including supra-national organizations, Global Health Initiatives and NonGovernmental Organizations (Samb et al. 2009), resulting in an environment where contesting interests and values are competing for relevance and authority. This study examined the power dynamics of medical professionals in the Nigerian health system through an in-depth case study of the interactions between the Global Fund grant and Nigerian medical professionals. Results are based on an in-depth qualitative study involving 34 semi-structured key informant interviews with policy makers, board-meeting observations, and documentary analysis. Data was analysed iteratively in order to gain insight into the power dynamics of medical professionals in policy processes and to analytically identify structural and agential factors within the health system that encourage or discourage professional dominance. Medical professionals maintained dominance and <b>professional</b> <b>monopoly,</b> thereby controlling policy spaces. Global actors and the local government were challenging interest groups, with a preference for rapid biomedical models that focus on medications and test kits, and the supply of health services, while neglecting social science narratives and demand creation.

The research design was a case study involving both qualitative and quantitative data. The context that shaped the team's process of ethical dilemma identification was conceptualised {{for the purpose of}} this research within a systems theory framework of interrelated factors at a societal, organisational and clinical level with ethics theory pervading the entire scene. The findings indicated that dilemmas arose in situations concerning patient care, team strain, and limited resources with the most common dilemma across disciplines arising from lack of community resources. Further findings suggested that clinicians were aware of various forces shaping practice but these ideas were not well connected conceptually. Staff felt wary of identifying ethical dilemmas because they were unsure of the process and sensed a reticence in the unit's social processes around negotiation and problem solving. Important social factors that were perceived to affect their abilities around ethical dilemma identification included rational economics, <b>professional</b> socialisation, medical-legal <b>monopoly</b> with a concomitant use of the ethic of justice, and managerial strategies. The concept of transference and countertransference issues within the staffing group was explored. These results are useful for the team to understand the nature of their own particular dilemmas and what factors constrain and enhance their abilities to identify dilemmas. Other health care settings may find that replication of the research results in a similar way may raise awareness of their moral situation.

40|$|The overall {{point of}} the study is to {{describe}} and understand the endeavours of the pre-school teachers’ trade union to establish professionalism within this field of work, {{from the end of the}} 1960 s to 2005. In order to shed light on the subject the main questions asked and answered in this study were: How does the pre-school teachers’ trade union act on issues regarding the autonomy of the pre-school teaching profession? To what extent, and in what way, does the pre-school teachers’ trade union strengthen the pre-school teaching profession’s position by differentiating itself from, and/or allying itself with other professional groups? Which knowledge base is the pre-school teachers’ trade union trying to establish and how does the union act on issues concerning the pre-school teaching profession’s knowledge base? How can these endeavours be understood from a gender perspective? The study presents profession and gender theoretical perspectives. It is based on an analysis of trade-union and official documents concerning pre-school, such as government enquiries, general guidelines and formal instructions. The analysis shows that state regulation of pre-school and its teachers has increased over the 45 -year period in question. The result of this has been clearer directives but, at the same time, a loss of professional autonomy. The pre-school teachers’ trade unions’ endeavours to establish a <b>professional</b> <b>monopoly</b> through attempting to differentiate the profession by excluding people without a university degree, has been unsuccessful despite exclusion strategies aimed at nursery nurses. A clear effort can be seen to build an alliance with the teachers in compulsory schools. Aside from extending the pre-school teachers’ university training to 3. 5 years, it is also evident that the move from care and developmental psychology to pedagogy and learning has been effected through the alliance with the compulsory school teachers. From a gender perspective, the context of pre-school teaching can be seen to have changed symbolically from one primarily intended to provide care and monitor children to a more pedagogical institution. Pre-school teachers have become teachers and children’s learning is emphasised more than their development. Overall this means that the pre-school teachers have a new identity and that pre-school teaching is no longer so clearly a woman’s job...|$|E
40|$|The {{practice}} of securing information was until recently associated strongly with securing the Information Technology systems which store and process it. As it has {{developed as a}} specialised area of work however, particularly as the critical importance of human and social factors has increasingly been recognised, it has acquired an identity separate from that of computing. The separation has been sufficient {{for the formation of}} a new, distinct occupation, with specialised credentialing bodies being established to attest to practitioners’ professional competence. This study is the first empirical academic investigation into the professionalisation of UK Information Security. It considers attitudes towards professional status, the desirability and practicality of licensing, the current standing of the occupation and its prospects for the future. The analysis draws heavily from the substantial Sociology of the Professions, both from the structural and procedural theory of profession-forming and the later critiques of motivation, class and power. Semi-structured interviews were undertaken with twenty-seven individuals comprising security analysts, managers, academics, professional bodies and the UK Government. Interviews took place between November 2012 and March 2015. Results are presented in two stages of analysis, using Actor–Network Theory as a theoretical lens. Whilst significant progress has been made towards forming a recognisable Information Security profession, its status is not yet comparable to more established peers. Aligned with US National Research Council findings but using a broader basis in professionalisation theory, the UK occupation was found to be too diffusely demarcated both internally and with respect to its bordering professions. It has yet to coalesce around distinct internal specialities with discrete qualification routes and establish the hierarchical arrangement of its major branches. Without such stratification of roles and a well-accepted claim to controlling a clearly demarcated body of knowledge, {{it is not possible to}} establish the boundaries of a graduate profession superior to any supporting para-professions, and thus position itself as requiring an advanced abstract education comparable to its peers. A rationalisation of credentials and institutions is required to produce a strong professional body which can advance the cause of the profession and properly establish and embed these roles. At present however – contrary to the tenor of much of the relevant sociology – neither the pursuit of professional status nor the exclusion of unqualified workers were found to be major motivators for current practitioners. By contrast government, the final arbiter of <b>professional</b> <b>monopoly,</b> is attempting urgently to increase the appeal of the profession to address a national skills shortfall, but is wary of direct market intervention in the form of licensing. Therefore, whilst change is rapid, significant impediments to full professional recognition remain...|$|E
40|$|This study {{attempted}} {{to assess the}} degree of professionalism associated with the teaching of English in the secondary schools of St. John's, Newfoundland. The data were obtained by means of questionnaires and an interview schedule. The questionnaires were completed by principals, heads of English departments and individual English teachers from the thirteen secondary schools {{in the city of}} St. John's. The interview schedule was used in interviewing school superintendents. All the instruments were geared to the ten criteria for professionalism in English identified by the investigator. The study {{attempted to}} ascertain {{the extent to which the}} teaching of English in the secondary schools of St. John's met the conditions implicit in the ten criteria. These criteria are: professional autonomy for teachers of English, the requirement of special training and knowledge in English, <b>professional</b> <b>monopoly</b> which requires that, as far as possible, only qualified English teachers teach English in secondary schools, career commitment, the inservice education of English teachers, involvement in research and development, group consciousness and integration in the form of an association of English teachers, an equitable workload for the teacher of English, special classrooms for English instruction, and the secondary school English department. The main findings of the study indicated that there was a gap between what participants accepted as constituting criteria for professionalism in English on the one hand, and on the other the extent to which these criteria were being met in the study schools. Analysis of the findings suggested several facts among which were the following: (1) The restrictions implicit in the provincial Education Act placed English in the same category as other subjects thereby making it difficult for the English teacher to teach English as he considered appropriate to his particular situation. (2) By the standards of the criteria used in this study, there appeared to be a scarcity of qualified English teachers in the study schools. (3) Analysis of data indicated apparent lack of commitment, on the part of English teachers, to English instruction as a career. The major recommendations arising from the study include the following: (1) Teachers of English in each school should be allowed more responsibility over the English programme and should, as far as possible, be free to teach in the way they consider appropriate to their individual situations. (2) Teachers of English in St. John's should set up a system to foster contacts among themselves as a professional group. (3) Consideration should be given, by the school administrators in St. John's, to the conditions under which the English teacher works, for example, an equitable work load that takes special note of the demands which English instruction makes on the teacher, and classrooms designed and equipped specifically for the teaching of English...|$|E
