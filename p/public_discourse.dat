We consider <b>public</b> <b>discourses</b> as a site for the display, negotiation, challenging, and/or (re-) construction of gender ideologies. By “public discourses”, we mean both discourses {{that take place in}} <b>public</b> settings and <b>discourses</b> that are accessible to general audiences in media and new media alike.

40|$|As {{we enter}} {{an era of}} {{so-called}} Do it Yourself health, “patient agency” has become a dominant theme in <b>public</b> <b>discourses</b> of health and medicine. Despite increased salience, patient agency remains a vague term {{that is capable of}} being operationalized and moralized in ways that escape attention. To illustrate this, I chart common rhetorical configurations of patient agency in <b>public</b> <b>discourses</b> of health and medicine, and in doing so find that patient agency is commonly rhetoricized as one of three overlapping patient capacities: the capacity to know, the capacity to prevent, and the capacity to decide. Ultimately, I argue that these three rhetorics of patient agency can be deployed to cultivate health subjectivities imbued with untenable ideals of individual control that constrain, rather than open, patients’ rhetorical choices...|$|R

A comparative discourse {{analysis was used to}} examine five important dimensions in China’s political discourses concerning the one-China policy: theme, relationship managing, target public, national identity, and national development. Additionally, an exploratory discourse analysis was conducted to further investigate the characteristics of Hu Jintao’s <b>public</b> <b>discourses</b> on the Taiwan issue. These analyses in the present research may provide contributions in developing negotiation agenda and political campaign strategies, particular for policymakers and public communication practitioners, who strive to build a better relationship between China and Taiwan.

40|$|This paper investigates <b>public</b> <b>discourses</b> of {{multilingualism}} in Britain. In {{contrast to}} previous research {{that focused on}} specific varieties, we examine multilingualism as a metalinguistic construct and are interested in what is frequently said about multilingualism. More specifically, we explore {{the extent to which}} media discourses are consonant or diverge from the attitudes of lay people. Media discourses are investigated using a corpus-assisted discourse study approach and large press corpora. Results from the corpus study were incorporated in an attitude survey distributed to 200 participants living in a larger town in Britain. Our study shows that while positive media discourses were mostly shared by the general public, some of the negative themes, especially related to immigration, were challenged. Our study shows the usefulness of triangulating corpus-linguistic methods with a survey to provide a more comprehensive understanding of <b>public</b> <b>discourses</b> about language matters and offers implications for promoting multilingualism in society...|$|R

40|$|Science Studies, Vol. 22 (2009), No. 1, 24 - 43 This paper investigates how <b>public</b> <b>discourses,</b> as {{articulated}} in EU policy and Austrian media documents, {{take part in}} the creation and stabilisation of a new patient figure – the e-patient. The documents we analysed act as one material form for enacting, performing and giving meaning to the changes occurring when a new technology enters established networks in the medical realm. Our analysis will show that the <b>public</b> <b>discourses</b> we studied deploy three rather different forms of discursive registers, each of which address and perform a specific relation between currently new information and communication technologies and citizen-patients. From one place, moment or problem-solution package to the next a slightly different hybrid and ‘multiple citizen-patient’ is being shaped, discussed, observed or concealed. The multiplicity we observed reveals crucial tensions and contradicting expectations expressed towards the future citizen-patient, showing the challenges for e-health in the making...|$|R
