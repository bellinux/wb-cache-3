However, if it is proved that he or she has not been heard of for seven years by those who would naturally have heard of the person if he or she had been alive, the burden of <b>proving</b> <b>that</b> the person is alive shifts to the person who affirms this.|$|E

5|$|A {{few weeks}} after {{accepting}} the offer, Apollo is assigned to investigate three separate incidents: a hit-and-run involving Phoenix, the theft of a noodle vendor's cart, and the disappearance of Trucy's favorite pair of panties. At the same time, the Kitaki crime family hires him to defend one of their own, Wocky Kitaki, in a murder trial concerning the death of Dr. Pal Meraktis. By connecting the incidents to evidence recovered {{with the help of}} Detective Ema Skye, Apollo discredits the case against Wocky by <b>proving</b> <b>that</b> his fiancée, Alita Tiala, {{was the only one who}} could have committed the crime.|$|E

Scully relieves Mulder, who is watching Tooms' new residence; they are unaware that Tooms is hiding in the trunk of Mulder's car. He manages to break into Mulder's apartment, where he injures himself and imprints Mulder's shoe print on his face. Tooms' frameup leads the police to question Mulder. Skinner then forbids Mulder from contacting Tooms.|$|E

Tucker zealously defended higher salaries for more tenured professors, and he was enraged when the University reduced his annual salary from $1500 to $1000.

5|$|In 1772, the French {{scientist}} Antoine Lavoisier used a lens {{to concentrate}} {{the rays of}} the sun on a diamond in an atmosphere of oxygen, and showed that the only product of the combustion was carbon dioxide, <b>proving</b> <b>that</b> diamond is composed of carbon. Later in 1797, the English chemist Smithson Tennant repeated and expanded that experiment. By demonstrating that burning diamond and graphite releases the same amount of gas, he established the chemical equivalence of these substances.|$|E

In addition to <b>proving</b> <b>that</b> his name was Joseph, not John, they were able to describe in more detail his life story. They refuted some of the inaccuracies in Treves's account, showing that Merrick's mother did not abandon him, and that Merrick deliberately chose to exhibit himself to make a living.|$|E
5|$|In Multani v.

Justice Louise Charron, who delivered the Court's majority opinion, applied the Oakes test to section 2(a) of the Charter. She held that the school could not discharge its burden of <b>proving</b> <b>that</b> prohibiting the kirpan was a reasonable limit on the student's constitutional freedom of religion.|$|E

Homer then realizes that it was really his father in a Santa costume, <b>proving</b> <b>that</b> Grampa did actually care for him. Homer quickly reunites with Grampa, who by coincidence has also gone to the farmhouse to reflect. They both admit they are screw-ups – since they both caused separate fires in the farmhouse – and they finally reconcile.|$|E
