GEP undertook the development of NiMH technology for commercial cell applications in 1987. This program focused on wound cell technology for replacement of current NiCd technology. As an off shoot of this program small, wound cells were used to evaluate initial design options for aerospace <b>prismatic</b> <b>cell</b> designs. Early in 1991, the first aerospace <b>prismatic</b> <b>cell</b> designs were built in a 6 Ah cell configuration. These cells were used to initially characterize performance in prismatic configurations and begin early life cycle testing. Soon after the 6 Ah cells were on test, several 22 Ah cells were built to test other options. The results of testing of these cells were used to identify potential problem areas for long lived cells and develop solutions to those problems. Following these two cell builds, a set of 7 Ah cells was built to evaluate improvements to the technology. To date results from these tests are very promising.

40|$|We {{describe}} an inversion method for 3 D geomagnetic data based on approximation {{of the source}} distribution by means of positive constrained Gaussian functions. In this way, smoothness and positivity are automatically imposed on the source without any subjective input from the user apart from selecting the number of functions to use. The algorithm has been tested with synthetic data in order to resolve sources at very different depths, using data from one measurement plane only. The forward modeling is based on <b>prismatic</b> <b>cell</b> parameterization, but the algebraic nonuniqueness is reduced because a relationship among the cells, expressed by the Gaussian envelope, is assumed to describe the spatial variation of the source distribution.

The algorithm proceeds by minimization of a (chi) 2 misfit function between real and predicted data using a nonlinear Levenberg-Marquardt iteration scheme, easily implemented on a desktop PC, without any additional regularization.

40|$|Recently，various new {{fluoride}} crystals {{have been}} developed as host for solid-state tunable UV lasers. Cerium（Ce）doped laser materials {{have been developed}} for use in the direct and efficient generation of tunable ultraviolet（UV）laser using a UV pump source．These have emerged as convenient and compact laser sources based on the electronically dipole-allowed interconfigurational 5 d- 4 f transitions of Ce 3 ＋ ions in wide band-gap fluoride crystals. They are especially attractive for ultrashort-pulse generation and amplifications in the UV region．Among these crystal Ce 3 +;LiCaAIF 6 （Ce：LiCAF）which was first reported by M. A. Dubinskii et al in 1993 ，is the first known tunable UV laser directly pumped by the fourth harmonic of standard Nd：YAG laser. It proved to have sustained high output due to the absence of solarization effects therefore leading to efficient and sustained high power laser emission. This crystal is typically grown by the Bridgman and Czochralski（CZ）methods. Part of the difficulty in developing new materials is the high cost and difficulty in producing large crystals by standard crystal growth methods. To economically and efficiently grown a large crystal with laser quality，the micro-pulling down（μPD）method modified for fluoride crystal growth is advantageous. Owing to a fast growth speed，a high quality crystal can be grown at a shorter time and at a lower cost compared with other melt growth schemes. Moreover, μ-PD method has the capability to control the shape of the grown crystal to produce fiber; rod; tube, and so on. In this thesis, successful growth of a laser-quality Ce:LiCAF crystal using the micro-pulling down method is described. To improve the Ce:LicAF laser quality we also described the numerical simulation for optical properties of Ce:LiCAF. This is the first Ce:LiCAF crystal to be grown by the μ-PD method, thus its basic optical properties have to be investigated. Primarily, given specified experimental parameters, the goal was to determine the important optical parameters of the Ce:LiCAF sample in order to design the appropriate experimental conditions. The properties that were investigated using numerical methods were radius, absorption coefficient, and absorption profile for specified given values of optical pump beam diameter, pump energy and an assumed refractive index for Ce:LiCAF. One way of possibly increasing the laser output power for the Ce:LiCAF laser oscillator is to design a multiple side pumping scheme. In the experiment, the <b>prismatic</b> <b>cell</b> was applied {{for the first time in}} this work to a solid state laser system. It can offer an improved laser output beam quality due to more uniform electric field distribution in the crystal. It could also reduce the risk of damage in the crystal. Moreover multi-pass pumping will yield high power. This pumping geometry is similar in principle to a <b>prismatic</b> <b>cell</b> that was previously used in dye laser and was applied for the first time in this work to a solid-state laser system. This will be especially important in designing a high energy optically pump Ce:LiCAF laser. The quality of the Ce:LiCAF crystal as a laser material was then experimentally evaluated.
