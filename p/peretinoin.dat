40|$|Hepatocellular {{carcinoma}} (HCC) often {{develops in}} association with liver cirrhosis, and its high recurrence rate leads to poor patient prognosis. Although recent evidence suggests that <b>peretinoin,</b> {{a member of the}} acyclic retinoid family, may be an effective chemopreventive drug for HCC, published data about its effects on hepatic mesenchymal cells, such as stellate cells and endothelial cells, remain limited. Using a mouse model in which platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) -C is overexpressed (Pdgf-c Tg), resulting in hepatic fibrosis, steatosis, and eventually, HCC development, we show that <b>peretinoin</b> significantly represses the development of hepatic fibrosis and tumors. <b>Peretinoin</b> inhibited the signaling pathways of fibrogenesis, angiogenesis, and Wnt/β-catenin in Pdgfc transgenic mice. In vitro, <b>peretinoin</b> repressed the expression of PDGF receptors α/β in primary mouse hepatic stellate cells (HSC), hepatoma cells, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells. <b>Peretinoin</b> also inhibited PDGF-C-activated transformation of HSCs into myofibroblasts. Together, our findings show that PDGF signaling is a target of <b>peretinoin</b> in preventing the development of hepatic fibrosis and HCC. © 2012 AACR.

40|$|Clinical {{studies suggest}} that the oral acyclic retinoid <b>Peretinoin</b> may reduce the {{recurrence}} of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) following surgical ablation of primary tumours. Since hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a major cause of HCC, we assessed whether <b>Peretinoin</b> and other retinoids have any effect on HCV infection. For this purpose, we measured the effects of several retinoids on the replication of genotype 1 a, 1 b, and 2 a HCV in vitro. <b>Peretinoin</b> inhibited RNA replication for all genotypes and showed the strongest antiviral effect among the retinoids tested. Furthermore, it reduced infectious virus release by 80 - 90 % without affecting virus assembly. These effects could be due to reduced signalling from lipid droplets, triglyceride abundance, and the expression of mature sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 c and fatty acid synthase. These negative effects of <b>Peretinoin</b> on HCV infection may be beneficial in addition to its potential for HCC chemoprevention in HCV-infected patients...|$|E
