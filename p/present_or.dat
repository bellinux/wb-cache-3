Holding negative funds or allowing sufficient patients to die will bring about losing requirements. When the goals have been met the player has the option to move on to a new, more elaborate hospital with tougher winning conditions and more diseases <b>present,</b> <b>or</b> stick with their current one. If enough rats have been shot, the player is taken to a special level whose goal is to shoot as many as possible.|$|E

5|$|The person's {{understanding}} {{of his or}} her mental illness is evaluated by exploring his or her explanatory account of the problem, and {{understanding of}} the treatment options. In this context, insight can be said to have three components: recognition that one has a mental illness, compliance with treatment, and the ability to re-label unusual mental events (such as delusions and hallucinations) as pathological. As insight is on a continuum, the clinician should not describe it as simply <b>present</b> <b>or</b> absent, but should report the patient's explanatory account descriptively.|$|E

During one such research effort, involving electromagnetic reduction of objects' weight, the two men accidentally discover an 'A-to-B' time loop side-effect: objects left in the weight-reducing field exhibit temporal anomalies, proceeding normally (from time 'A,' when the field was activated, to time 'B,' when the field is powered off), then backwards (from 'B' back to 'A') in a continuously repeating sequence, such that objects can leave {{the field in the}} <b>present,</b> <b>or</b> at some previous point.|$|E
5|$|While the {{procession}} was an actual historic event, Matejko took many artistic liberties, such as including persons {{who were not}} in fact <b>present</b> <b>or</b> had died earlier. He did so because he intended the painting to be a synthesis of {{the final years of}} the Commonwealth. He also felt that there was no real historic moment or location that fully captured the spirit of the Constitution, and so he, the artist, needed to create such a moment.|$|E
5|$|A monarch is {{the head}} of a monarchy, a form of {{government}} in which a state or polity is ruled by an individual who normally rules for life or until abdication, and typically inherits the throne by birth. Monarchs may be autocrats (as in all absolute monarchies) or may be ceremonial figureheads, exercising only limited or no reserve powers at all, with actual authority vested in a legislature and/or executive cabinet (as in many constitutional monarchies). In many cases, a monarch will also be linked with a state religion. Most states only have a single monarch at any given time, although a regent may rule when the monarch is a minor, not <b>present,</b> <b>or</b> otherwise incapable of ruling. Cases in which two monarchs rule simultaneously over a single state, as is the current situation in Andorra, are known as coregencies.|$|E
40|$|Odds ratios (ORs) {{are widely}} used in {{scientific}} research to demonstrate associations between outcome variables and covariates (risk factors) of interest and are often described in language suitable for risks or probabilities, but odds and probabilities are related, not equivalent. In situations where the outcome is not rare (e. g., obesity), ORs no longer approximate the relative risk ratio and may be misinterpreted. Our study examines the extent of misinterpretation of ORs in Obesity and International Journal of Obesity. We reviewed all 2010 issues of these journals to identify all articles that <b>presented</b> <b>ORs.</b> Included articles were then primarily reviewed for correct presentation and interpretation of ORs; and secondarily reviewed for article characteristics {{that may have been}} associated with how <b>ORs</b> are <b>presented</b> and interpreted. Of the 855 articles examined, 62 (7. 3 %) <b>presented</b> <b>ORs.</b> <b>ORs</b> were <b>presented</b> incorrectly in 23. 2 % of these articles. Clinical articles were more likely to <b>present</b> <b>ORs</b> correctly than social science or basic science articles. Studies with outcome variables that had higher relative prevalence were less likely to <b>present</b> <b>ORs</b> correctly. Overall, almost a quarter of the studies <b>presenting</b> <b>ORs</b> in two leading journals on obesity misinterpreted them. Furthermore, even when researchers <b>present</b> <b>ORs</b> correctly, the lay media may misinterpret them as relative risk ratios. Therefore, we suggest that when the magnitude of associations is of interest, researchers should carefully and accurately present interpretable measures of association [...] including risk ratios and risk differences [...] to minimize confusion and misrepresentation of research results...|$|R

5|$|Although {{there are}} many diverse pathogens, {{many of which are}} {{constantly}} mutating, it is a surprise that a majority of individuals remain free of infections. Thus, maintenance of health requires the body to recognize all pathogens (antigens they <b>present</b> <b>or</b> produce) likely to exist. This is achieved by maintaining a pool of immensely large (about 109) clones of B cells, each of which reacts against a specific epitope by recognizing and producing antibodies against it. However, at any given time very few clones actually remain receptive to their specific epitope. Thus, approximately 107 different epitopes can be recognized by all the B cell clones combined. Moreover, in a lifetime, an individual usually requires the generation of antibodies against very few antigens in comparison with the number that the body can recognize and respond against.|$|E
5|$|An infinitive form, {{that uses}} the plain form of the verb and the {{preposition}} to, is used for verbal clauses that are syntactically subordinate to a finite verbal clause. Finite verbal clauses {{are those that are}} formed around a verb in the <b>present</b> <b>or</b> preterit form. In clauses with auxiliary verbs they are the finite verbs and the main verb is treated as a subordinate clause. For example, he has to go where only the auxiliary verb have is inflected for time and the main verb to go is in the infinitive, or in a complement clause such as I saw him leave, where the main verb is to see which is in a preterite form, and leave is in the infinitive.|$|E

5|$|Canis dirus {{lived in}} the late Pleistocene to the early Holocene (125,000–10,000 years before <b>present</b> <b>or</b> YBP) in North and South America (although no members of Canis survive in the latter continent). The {{majority}} of fossils from the eastern C.d.dirus have been dated 125,000–75,000YBP, but the western C.d.guildayi fossils are not only smaller in size but more recent; thus it has been proposed that C.d.guildayi derived from C.d.dirus. However, there are disputed specimens of C.dirus that date to 250,000YBP. Fossil specimens of C.dirus discovered at four sites in the Hay Springs area of Sheridan County, Nebraska, were named Aenocyon dirus nebrascensis (Frick 1930, undescribed), but Frick did not publish {{a description of the}}m. Nowak later referred to this material as C.armbrusteri; then, in 2009, Tedford formally published a description of the specimens and noted that, although they exhibited some morphological characteristics of both C.armbrusteri and C.dirus, he referred to them only as C.dirus. These Nebraskan fossil specimens may represent the earliest record of C.dirus.|$|E
5|$|Chagas disease, {{also known}} as American trypanosomiasis, is a {{tropical}} parasitic disease caused by the protist Trypanosoma cruzi. It is spread mostly by insects known as Triatominae or kissing bugs. The symptoms change {{over the course of}} the infection. In the early stage, symptoms are typically either not <b>present</b> <b>or</b> mild, and may include fever, swollen lymph nodes, headaches, or local swelling at the site of the bite. After 8–12 weeks, individuals enter the chronic phase of disease and in 60–70% it never produces further symptoms. The other 30 to 40% of people develop further symptoms 10 to 30 years after the initial infection, including enlargement of the ventricles of the heart in 20 to 30%, leading to heart failure. An enlarged esophagus or an enlarged colon may also occur in 10% of people.|$|E

Above the tank top level, on the Orlop Deck, F Deck and E Deck, the doors closed horizontally and were manually operated. They could be closed at the door itself or from the deck above.|$|E

5|$|Mycena adscendens {{produces}} a white spore print. The spores are broadly , amyloid, and have dimensions of 8–10 by 5–6.5µm. Basidia (spore-bearing cells) are two-spored, club-shaped, and measure 14–17 by 7–9µm. Pleurocystidia (cystidia on the gill faces) may be <b>present</b> <b>or</b> absent. If present, they {{are similar to}} the cheilocystidia (cystidia on the gill edges). The cheilocystidia are abundant, measuring 28–44 by 8–12µm. They are variable in shape, often fusoid-ventricose (fuse-shaped with a swollen center) or with 2–3 needle-like projections arising from the apex; the projections are sometimes forked. The swollen parts of the cheilocystidia are covered with short rodlike protuberances or warts. The flesh of the gills is vinaceous-brown when stained in iodine. The flesh of the cap is made up of greatly enlarged cells, with the surface covered with club-shaped to almost globular cells measuring 25–40 by about 20µm. Their walls are finely verrucose (covered with small warts), and all but the verrucose cells are -brown in iodine. Clamp connections are abundant in the hyphae.|$|E
5|$|The blue-faced honeyeater {{appears to}} be {{generally}} sedentary within its range, especially {{in much of the}} Northern Territory, Queensland and New South Wales. However, in many places (generally south of the Tropic of Capricorn), populations may be <b>present</b> <b>or</b> absent at different times of the year, although this appears to result from nomadic rather than seasonal migratory movements. Around Wellington in central New South Wales, birds were recorded over winter months, and were more common in autumn around the Talbragar River. Birds were present all year round near Inverell in northern New South Wales, but noted to be flying eastwards from January to May, and westwards in June and July. In Jandowae in southeastern Queensland, birds were regularly recorded flying north and east from March to June, and returning south and west in July and August, and were absent from the area in spring and summer.|$|E
5|$|The {{book was}} not {{intended}} to either <b>present</b> <b>or</b> defend any particular position in environmental ethics, but rather to explore what process philosophers could say or have said about environmental issues. There are, for Palmer, two key problems with a process approach to environmental ethics. The first concerns the value of human and nonhuman life; for process thinkers, the latter will always be trumped by the former in terms of value. The second concerns human perspectives; as process philosophy invariably models interpretation of all entities on human experience, it is not well-suited to characterising non-human nature. Palmer thus concludes that process philosophy does not provide a suitable basis for environmental ethics.|$|E

5|$|There are a {{large number}} of battles {{attributed}} to Wellington. Although many leave the impression that he was <b>present</b> <b>or</b> in command at those actions, it was sometimes the case that he entrusted other officers to engage the enemy, such as at remote locations, and that he could not have attended them all in person. Similarly, Wellington was not usually in command of rear guard actions, during advances or retreats, despite his army engaging in them often. Engagements where the lack of his presence is absolutely certain, or where his position is unconfirmed by records and accounts, are not included in his battle record.|$|E
5|$|There may {{nonetheless}} be {{a connection}} between the murder of Eadulf and events further south. For the same year the Chronicle of John of Worcester related that, because of an attack on two of Harthacnut's tax-collectors there, Siward took part in a reprisal on the city and monastery of Worcester. Harthacnut reigned only another year, dying on 8 June 1042. He was succeeded by the exiled English ætheling Edward. As an ætheling, a royal prince with a <b>present</b> <b>or</b> likely future claim on the throne, Edward appears to have been invited back by Harthacnut in 1041, fortuitously smoothing over the coming change in ruler. Edward was crowned king on Easter Day, 3 April 1043.|$|E
5|$|Up {{to three}} {{thoracic}} segments may be fused {{with the head}} to form a cephalothorax; the associated appendages turn forward and are modified as maxillipeds (accessory mouthparts). A carapace may be absent, <b>present</b> <b>or</b> secondarily lost, and may cover the head, part {{or all of the}} thorax and some of the abdomen. It is variable in form and may be fused dorsally with some of the thoracic segments or occasionally be in two parts, hinged dorsally. Typically, each of the thoracic appendages is biramous and the endopods are the better developed of the branches, being used for crawling or grasping. Each endopod consist of seven articulating segments; the coxa, basis, ischium, merus, carpus, propodus and dactylus. In decapods, the claw is formed by the articulation of the dactylus against an outgrowth of the propodus. In some taxa, the exopods are lost and the appendages are uniramous.|$|E
