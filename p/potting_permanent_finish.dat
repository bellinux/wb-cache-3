40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 46 - 47) Permanent press fabrics {{are popular}} {{today because of}} their easy care properties. However, {{it has not been}} verified whether or not this same finish might also act as an antibacterial agent. Therefore, this study investigated the hypothesis that <b>permanent</b> press <b>finishes</b> might stop or curtail bacterial growth on fabrics. Inoculations of two bacteria, E. Coli and B. mega on finished and unfinished fabric samples provided results for a comparative study. Some samples were inoculated and plated immediately; others were inoculated and kept in a humidity chamber for twenty-four hours before plating to simulate storage and climatic conditions; and a third group were inoculated, kept in a humidity chamber for twenty-four hours and then laundered in and according to suggested Launderometer standards. The samples from this last test were then either plated whole or macerated and plated. The Agar Plate Test method (AATCC test standard for detection and evaluation of antibacterial finishes) and the Streak Test method were used for another set of tests. Another segment of the study concerned naturally soiled finished and unfinished fabrics. Small samples of each fabric were sewn in regular clothing, worn one day, and then plated. The permanent press samples that were inoculated and subsequently plated showed little or no growth whereas all the unfinished samples showed considerably increased growth. The permanent press samples that were inoculated and stored for twenty-four hours in a humidity chamber before plating showed no growth while the unfinished samples all exhibited bacterial growth. Of the samples that were inoculated, stored for twenty-four hours in the humidity chamber, washed, and plated whole, all finished samples had no growth but all untreated samples showed growth. Of the washed samples that were macerated, the untreated macerated fibers showed from five to six times more growth than the permanent press samples. The Agar Plate Test and Streak Test both showed that the permanent press samples inhibited bacterial growth whereas the unfinished samples showed no inhibition of growth. On all samples of naturally soiled permanent press fabrics, the majority of samples containing bacterial growth had less growth than the unfinished samples. These results would indicate that the <b>permanent</b> press <b>finish</b> can inhibit some bacterial growth and thus may act concomitantly as an antibacterial finish...|$|R

[...] People with formaldehyde allergy are advised to avoid formaldehyde releasers as well (e.g., Quaternium-15, imidazolidinyl urea, and diazolidinyl urea). People who suffer allergic reactions to formaldehyde tend to display lesions on the skin in the areas that have had direct contact with the substance, such as the neck or thighs (often due to formaldehyde released from <b>permanent</b> press <b>finished</b> clothing) or dermatitis on the face (typically from cosmetics). Formaldehyde has been banned in cosmetics in both Sweden and Japan. The eyes are most sensitive to formaldehyde exposure: The lowest level at which many people can begin to smell formaldehyde is about 0.05 ppm and the highest level is 1 ppm. The maximum concentration value at the workplace is 0.3 ppm. In controlled chamber studies, individuals begin to sense eye irritation at about 0.5 ppm; 5 to 20 percent report eye irritation at 0.5 to 1 ppm; and greater certainty for sensory irritation occurred at 1 ppm and above. While some agencies have used a level as low as 0.1 ppm as a threshold for irritation, the expert panel found that a level of 0.3 ppm would protect against nearly all irritation.

Management systems for finishing beef cattle, {{designed to meet}} environmental goals in the Less Favoured Areas (LFAs) of the UK, often rely on the integration of grazing of semi-natural pastures with sown permanent pasture. In this experiment, three management options were compared: (i) permanent pasture for grazing and silage production (treatment PP), (ii) permanent pasture for grazing and silage and grazing of Molinia-dominant semi-natural pasture in summer from June to August inclusively (treatment PP + SNP) and (iii) permanent pasture for grazing and silage and red clover (RC) silage for 0 ? 25 of the silage requirement in winter (treatment PP + RC). The performance of spring-born Welsh Black steers was measured from turnout in spring 2002 until finishing in summer 2003. During summer 2002, the liveweight gain of steers grazing the semi-natural pasture was significantly {{lower than that of}} steers grazing the permanent pasture. There was a trend for the liveweight gains of the steers on the PP + SNP treatment to be higher from housing in autumn 2002, and live weights on all treatments were similar {{at the start of the}} red clover-feeding phase. Steers offered red clover silage had a significantly higher liveweight gains than those offered grass silage, but there was only a trend for a higher live weight at the end of the winter-feeding period.

I gratefully appreciate the gift and wish to extend my sincere thanks to the club. For the present, at least, I’m comfortably situated at Miami Beach, the “playground of the South. ” I was lucky in getting {{a job in the}} office; I feel as if I owe a great deal to Bryant training for being placed where I am. I’m anxiously looking forward to a real good experience in office work while in the Army which might get me somewhere in civilian life after the war. The Service Club news letter came about a week ago and was very informative and interesting. I can quite understand the reason for mimeographing the letters, as the list of men in service must be long by now and still growing. It must be a full time job keeping track of all those entering the service. Bryant must be quite changed with so many of the professors leaving. Without Prof. Shors of Iowa and Prof. Lee of the metropolitan city of Pawtucket, the college would look as if something important was missing. However, they are doing important work in helping with the war effort, and maybe Bryant will be favored with their services again. I suppose Prof. Gulsky [sic] is still planting his corn; his jokes were about the corniest I’ve heard, but it made the hard work and tough problems seem so much easier and we did have lots of fun. The weather is fine here and I’ll bet there are many who wish they could be in my place. The ocean is just across the street and the swimming is swell; oftentimes the water is warmer than the air, which is usually pretty warm itself. I {{was one of those who}} were lucky enough to be transferred to <b>permanent</b> post before <b>finishing</b> my basic training. The basic period is 25 days for the Air Forces and I only completed seven. It seemed good to get away from the drilling and live a civilized life once more. I am practically living a life of a civilian, except that they don’t have to fall out for roll call or take callisthenics [sic]every day. Once again accept my sincere thanks. You can hardly realize what it means to hear from you and how much the gift is appreciated. Gratefully yours. Harold R. Hobson [Transcription ends...|$|R
