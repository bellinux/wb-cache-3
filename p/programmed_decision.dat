40|$|Knowledge is a {{category}} that includes many past decisions. They {{could be good}} for the past but it is a question if they can work in the future. We can talk about programmed and non-programmed decisions. When a predetermined situation triggers a predetermined response we can talk about a <b>programmed</b> <b>decision.</b> If one wants to make a non-programmed decision he/she must search for information, identify the problem, evaluate possible alternatives, and act. If the process is more complicated, <b>programmed</b> <b>decision</b> will be more effective. Our research has revealed that future managers in Slovenia possess knowledge that involves more programmed that non-programmed decisions. This may indicate that they will have a lot of difficulties with decision making in complicated organisational systems. However, they cannot learn how to take decisions (even if they want to) because they do not know what they actually need. If they are successful at non-programmed decisions they want more knowledge from the same area; in fact they would need more knowledge about programmed decisions- and vice versa...|$|E
40|$|The use of on-line, {{real-time}} computer-based {{information systems}} to augment managerial decision making raises interesting and significant questions. In search of operational answers, {{the authors have}} developed and conducted experiments with a time-sharing computer model. By modeling the dynamics of a job shop the authors were able both {{to make use of}} and to evaluate academic research in job shop scheduling. The authors have devised a specific apportionment of the problem environment which permits users of their information system to explore the effects of various combinations of heuristics and <b>programmed</b> <b>decision</b> rules. The response of over 300 managers and academicians who have participated in the experiments provides evidence of the practicality of such an approach to multi-dimensional, time-variant problem solving. ...|$|E
40|$|According {{to total}} rationality, the {{economic}} man, {{in attempt to}} maximize her/his utility, considers all the alternatives and chooses the best one, the optimal solution. According to Simon's conception of bounded rationality {{we have a number}} of limitations to being rational; as a consequence we are left with two choices: we can either search for an optimal solution within a limited solution-space, or we can define our expectations in advance and accept the first solution that satisfies them, this is the satisfactory solution. If we allow the decision taker to alter her/his expectations while searching we get adaptive rationality. In this paper we take the conception of adaptation to the extreme; if we cannot formulate any of our expectations in advance, than we search for alternatives and formulate objections against them. In this case, we accept the first solution which we have no objection against - the objectionless solution. Then we take to two extremes, the satisfactory and the objectionless solutions, and the corresponding rationalities under examination. The satisfactory solution corresponds to the routine (<b>programmed)</b> <b>decision,</b> while the objectionless solution corresponds to the original (non-programmed) decision. We know that these are non-existing extremities, the black and white, while the real-life decisions lay in the shades of the grey. By connecting the two models, we have developed the conception of the integrated rationality. The outcome is a solution which is both satisfactory and objectionless at the same time. We call it the acceptable solution...|$|E

40|$|The thesis {{takes the}} economist's concept of {{cost-benefit}} analysis and subjects it to a ‘developmental appraisal', from the management viewpoint and {{in respect of}} ‘in-company training'. In so doing it seeks to explore the contribution that the broad concept, when applied to training evaluation, can make to management decision making. The thesis concludes from an appraisal of the cost-benefit concept that differences when it is applied to in-company training compared with the economists traditional 'macro' usage, merit a different label, 'investment appraisal' of training. The place of the concept in training evaluation is then explored and in use it is shown {{to be subject to}} a great many constraints. The thesis proposes that these constraints be translated as opportunities within a 'new' framework which seeks to consider training evaluation from the management viewpoint. This framework proposes a twin role for evaluation: the conventional one of feedback to the trainer and organisation; and an additional one of identification of the key 'supportive' systems needed to meet the objectives of a particular programme. To test these roles a dichotomy is proposed between Programmed and non-Programmed training decisions, within which a classification of types of training is suggested. The investment appraisal concept is then applied to evaluations within each of these decision categories. The non-Programmed decision evaluation is conducted in an operative training situation in a rolling mill in the steel industry; the <b>Programmed</b> <b>Decision</b> evaluation is applied to a junior operative training programme in several steel companies. The thesis concludes from the results of the experiments that a useful methodology has been devised and that the major contribution of the application of the concept in practice is the opportunity it gives both for the identification of line management contribution to the success of training and obtaining of their involvement...|$|E

40|$|The 2014 Farm Bill {{eliminated}} {{direct payments}} to farmers {{in favor of}} two alternative safety net programs; Price Loss Coverage (PLC) and Agriculture Risk Coverage (ARC). Farmers must make a one-time, irrevocable choice of PLC, a county ARC program, or an individual ARC program for each covered commodity on their farm. The main objective {{of this study is}} to determine which program would be most beneficial for Texas farmers to choose. The study will utilize the Agricultural and Food Policy Center (AFPC) database of representative farms to determine how farmers will respond to the farm bill. Stochastic simulation will be used to examine farmers? choices and will provide insight into when the farmers should choose PLC versus ARC enrollment. By incorporating historical price and yield risk into the analyses the decision between PLC and ARC can be made knowing which of the two choices would perform best under uncertainty. The results show that most of the Texas representative farms in this study would choose PLC as their farm <b>program</b> <b>decision.</b> A total of eleven representative farms preferred PLC as the <b>program</b> <b>decision</b> for their entire farm, including whole farm and each crop?s choice. PLC is expected to be the most popular <b>program</b> <b>decision</b> based on the whole farm analysis. There were zero farms showing ARC as the whole farm <b>program</b> <b>decision...</b>|$|R
