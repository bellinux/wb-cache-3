40|$|The Mars Organic Mass Analyzer {{is being}} {{developed}} at Goddard Space Flight Center to identify organics and possible biological compounds on Mars. In the process of characterizing mass spectrometer size, weight, and power consumption, the use of <b>pulse</b> <b>counting</b> was considered for ion detection. <b>Pulse</b> <b>counting</b> has advantages over analog-mode amplification of the electron multiplier signal. Some advantages are reduced size of electronic components, low power consumption, ability to remotely characterize detector performance, and avoidance of analog circuit noise. The use of <b>pulse</b> <b>counting</b> as a detection method with ion trap instruments is relatively rare. However, with the recent development of high performance electrical components, this detection method is quite suitable and can demonstrate significant advantages over analog methods. Methods A prototype quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometer with an internal electron ionization source {{was used as a}} test setup to develop and evaluate the pulse-counting method. The anode signal from the electron multiplier was preamplified. The an 1 plified signal was fed into a fast comparator for pulse-level discrimination. The output of the comparator was fed directly into a Xilinx FPGA development board. Verilog HDL software was written to bin the counts at user-selectable intervals. This system was able to count pulses at rates in the GHz range. The stored ion count nun 1 ber per bin was transferred to custom ion trap control software. Pulse-counting mass spectra were compared with mass spectra obtained using the standard analog-mode ion detection. Prelin 1 inary Data Preliminary mass spectra have been obtained for both analog mode and pulse-counting mode under several sets of instrument operating conditions. Comparison of the spectra revealed better peak shapes for pulse-counting mode. Noise levels are as good as, or better than, analog-mode detection noise levels. To artificially force ion pile-up conditions, the ion trap was overfilled and ions were ejected at very high scan rates. Pile-up of ions was not significant for the ion trap under investigation even though the ions are ejected in so-called 'ion-micro packets'. It was found that <b>pulse</b> <b>counting</b> mode had higher dynamic range than analog mode, and that the first amplification stage in analog mode can distort mass peaks. The inherent speed of the <b>pulse</b> <b>counting</b> method also proved to be beneficial to ion trap operation and ion ejection characterization. Very high scan rates were possible with <b>pulse</b> <b>counting</b> since the digital circuitry response time is so much smaller than with the analog method. Careful investigation of the pulse-counting data also allowed observation of the applied resonant ejection frequency during mass analysis. Ejection of ion micro packets could be clearly observed in the binned data. A second oscillation frequency, much lower than the secular frequency, was also observed. Such an effect was earlier attributed to the oscillation of the total plasma cloud in the ion trap. While the components used to implement <b>pulse</b> <b>counting</b> are quite advanced, due to their prevalence in consumer electronics, the cost of this detection system is no more than that of an analog mode system. Total pulse-counting detection system electronics cost is under $ 25...|$|E

40|$|We used a {{retrospective}} approach to identify hydrologic metrics {{with the greatest}} potential for ecological relevance for use as resource management tools (i. e., hydrologic indicators) in rapidly urbanizing basins of the Puget Lowland.

Data utilized in the analysis included gauged flow and benthic macroinvertebrate data collected at 16 locations in 11 King County stream basins. Fifteen hydrologic metrics were calculated from daily average flow data and the Pacific Northwest Benthic Index of Biological Integrity (B-IBI) was used to represent the gradient of response of stream macroinvertebrates to urbanization. Urbanization was represented by percent Total Impervious Area (%TIA) and percent urban land cover (%Urban). We found eight hydrologic metrics that were significantly correlated with B-IBI scores (Low <b>Pulse</b> <b>Count</b> and Duration; High <b>Pulse</b> <b>Count,</b> Duration, and Range; Flow Reversals, TQmean, and R-B Index). Although {{there appeared to be}} a great deal of redundancy among these metrics with respect to their response to urbanization, only two of the metrics tested – High <b>Pulse</b> <b>Count</b> and High <b>Pulse</b> Range – best met all four criteria we established for selecting hydrologic indicators. The increase in these high pulse metrics with respect to urbanization is the result of an increase in winter high pulses and the occurrence of high pulse events during summer (increasing the frequency and range of high pulses), when practically none would have occurred prior to development. We performed an initial evaluation of the usefulness of our hydrologic indicators by calculating and comparing hydrologic metrics derived from continuous hydrologic simulations of selected basin management alternatives for Miller Creek, one of the most highly urbanized basins used in our study. We found that the preferred basin management alternative appeared to be effective in restoring some flow metrics close to simulated fully forested conditions (e. g., TQmean), but less effective in restoring other metrics such as High <b>Pulse</b> <b>Count</b> and Range. If future research continues to support our hypothesis that the flow regime, particularly High <b>Pulse</b> <b>Count</b> and Range, is an important control of biotic integrity in Puget Lowland streams, it would have significant implications for stormwater management...|$|R
