The Campus Martius originally was an exercise field where young men developed the skills of horsemanship and warfare. Hunting was also considered an appropriate pastime.

One very common circumstantial voice is the ordinary passive voice, which <b>promotes</b> <b>a</b> patient to the subject position.|$|R

Hoffmann had previously published a number of conventional directmate Babsons, {{but this one is}} significant as it is the first cyclic Babson: rather than black promotions being matched by White, they are related in cyclic form: Black <b>promoting</b> to <b>a</b> queen means White must <b>promote</b> to <b>a</b> bishop, Black <b>promoting</b> to <b>a</b> bishop means White must <b>promote</b> to <b>a</b> rook, Black <b>promoting</b> to <b>a</b> rook means White must <b>promote</b> to <b>a</b> knight, and Black <b>promoting</b> to <b>a</b> knight means White must <b>promote</b> to <b>a</b> queen.|$|R
5|$|An {{ethnically diverse}} region, Abkhazia was {{nominally}} {{led by the}} titular Abkhaz people, who made up less than 30% of the population; other major groups included Georgians, Armenians, Greeks, and Russians. Even though they did not form the majority, the Abkhaz were heavily favoured, and the Abkhaz language was <b>promoted,</b> <b>a</b> result of the korenizatsiia policies of the era. An Abkhaz national identity was promoted through these policies, instilling a sense of Abkhaz nationalism.|$|E

However, such <b>a</b> <b>promoted</b> piece cannot then <b>promote</b> <b>a</b> second time as its namesake does. For example, <b>a</b> lion <b>promotes</b> to <b>a</b> furious fiend. However, while <b>an</b> eastern barbarian <b>promotes</b> to <b>a</b> lion on its first capturing move, it does not further <b>promote</b> to <b>a</b> furious fiend on its second. Rather, it remains a lion {{for the rest of the}} game. This should be obvious from the game pieces, which only have two sides.|$|R

30|$|Considering {{parts and}} {{components}} suppliers, we verify that imports from the ROW, EU, EA, LA, and North America <b>promoted</b> <b>an</b> {{increase in the}} sophistication of the final products traded inside Latin America. A 1 % increase in North American participation in the import basket composition, all ceteris paribus, <b>promotes</b> <b>an</b> increase of 0.06 % {{in the quality of}} the intra-bloc export basket, while imports from EU <b>promoted</b> <b>an</b> increase of 0.04 %, followed by increases of 0.02 % in the case of imports from LA or EA, and 0.01 % for the ROW. The second column reveals that imports just from LA and North America had a positive effect in the electric machinery sector, while the coefficients for imports from other regions are statistically insignificant. Increases of 1 % in imports from North America <b>promote</b> <b>an</b> increase of 0.07 % in the quality of final electric machinery intra-bloc export basket, while imports from LA <b>promote</b> <b>an</b> increase of 0.06 %. Transport equipment coefficients were all statistically insignificant. In the second half of Table  5, we verify similar results for the case of pooled machinery data. North American imports <b>promote</b> <b>an</b> increase of 0.1 % in the quality of the parts and components export basket, while imports from the EU and EA <b>promote</b> <b>an</b> increase of 0.04 % each. In column 5, the coefficients are slightly different, revealing that imports only from China <b>promote</b> <b>a</b> 0.04 % increase in the intra-bloc export basket of electric machinery parts and components, while imports from EA have a negative effect. Once again, transport equipment coefficients are statistically insignificant.|$|R

During this time the Assembly outlawed torture and repealed all noble titles, and also chose the official Argentine National Anthem.|$|E

In 1927, he helped establish a ski jump in Grouse Mountain in North Vancouver.

He <b>promoted</b> <b>a</b> strict adherence to the amateur code, and stated that debates regarding professionalism were disruptive for the United States National Ski Association.|$|E
5|$|Around 1925, {{having had}} little success in Batavia, Andjar moved to Padang, {{where he was}} a {{reporter}} for the daily Sinar Soematera. At the same time, he worked with the city's Padangsche Opera, writing stage plays. In contrast to the standard musical theatre of the time, bangsawan, he <b>promoted</b> <b>a</b> more natural style, using dialogue instead of song to convey the story; he referred to this as toneel, based on the Dutch word for theatre. Among the works he wrote for the Padangsche Opera were adaptations of Melati van Agam, a 1923 work by Swan Pen, and Sitti Nurbaya, a 1922 novel by Marah Roesli. These works were well received.|$|E
5|$|At Final Resolution, {{the team}} of Robert Roode and Ms. Brooks fought {{the team of}} Booker T and Sharmell. The storyline behind this {{encounter}} involved Sharmell coming {{to the defense of}} Roode's manager Ms. Brooks, who Roode verbally abused on the December 13, 2007 episode of Impact!. After the encounter, Roode accidentally punched Sharmell in the face, resulting in a storyline fractured jaw which sidelined her from appearing for the promotion and upsetting her real-life husband Booker T. Following the event, Roode fired Brooks and higher her replacement Payton Banks on the January 10 episode of Impact!, setting up a match between the two at Against All Odds.

The party's opposition to the European Union grew stronger in the 1990s. The FPÖ opposed Austria's joining the EU in 1994, and <b>promoted</b> <b>a</b> popular initiative against the replacement of the Austrian Schilling with the Euro in 1998, but to no avail. Owing to perceived differences between Turkish and European culture, the party opposes the accession of Turkey to the EU; it has declared that should this happen, Austria must immediately leave the EU.|$|E
5|$|Elizabeth Courtauld, {{wife of the}} {{industrialist}} and art collector Samuel Courtauld, <b>promoted</b> <b>a</b> popular {{series of}} subscription concerts beginning in 1929 and on Schnabel's advice engaged Sargent as chief conductor, with guest conductors as eminent as Bruno Walter, Otto Klemperer and Stravinsky. The Courtauld-Sargent concerts, as they became known, were aimed at people who had not previously attended concerts. They attracted large audiences bringing Sargent's name before another section of the public. In addition to the core repertory, Sargent introduced new works by Bliss, Honegger, Kodály, Martinů, Prokofiev, Szymanowski and Walton, among others. At first, {{the plan was to}} engage the London Symphony Orchestra for these concerts, but the orchestra, a self-governing co-operative, refused to replace key players whom Sargent considered sub-standard. As a result, in conjunction with Beecham, Sargent set about establishing a new orchestra, the London Philharmonic.|$|E
5|$|Even the Jäger {{battalion}} {{was divided}} {{in the same}} way that the rest of the country was: 450 mostly socialist Jägers remained stationed in Germany as they could have chosen the Red side in the conflict. The leaders of the White Guards faced a similar problem with drafting young men to the army in February 1918: 30,000 obvious supporters of the Finnish labor movement never showed up. It was also uncertain whether common troopers drafted from the small-sized and poor farms of central and northern Finland had strong enough motivation to fight the Finnish Reds; the White's propaganda <b>promoted</b> <b>a</b> nationalist war against the Red, Bolshevist Russians, and belittled the significance of the Red Finns.|$|E
