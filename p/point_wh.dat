The {{selection}} has been done by employi ng numerical optimization algorithms, that produce a single cycle and fulfils all constrains. To build up the engine model, we estimate just six performance parameters. The search method that has been used here is the SQP method (Sequential Quadra tic program). Results show very good agreement for the thrust (f n), fan rotational speed and high pressure compressor rotational speed. Also the results represent very good agreement for pressure parameters pt 3, ps 4 and pt 7. By contrast the maximum disagreement does not exceed 3. 75 % for the exit temperature (tt 7) ...|$|E

The ob ject ives of the work are {{to determine whether the}} apparent similarity to the anodic ox idat ion of i ron ip neutra l electrolyte {{is due to the fact}} that s imi lar electro-chemica l processes are involved, and whether changes in the ox idat ion state of the film are brought about by sol id-state processes or by processes involv ing dissolved intermediates. The anodic oxide consists of an inner compact monova lent oxide covered by an outer d iva lent oxide. Reduct ion takes place in three stages: first the d iva lent oxide is reduced to a monova lent oxide by a process involv ing dissolved intermediates, then the under ly ing compact monova lent oxide is re-duced, and finally the monova lent oxide produced in the first stage is reduced. The final stage results in the growth of a copper deposi t on the outer surface of the oxide film, and fur ther cycl ing produces an inhomogeneous s t ructure wh ich is not suitable for e l l ipsometr ic study.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{influence}} of wettability on the formation, growth and mobiliza-tion of bubbles formed w h e n solution gas is released from water-flood residual oil have been visually {{observed in a}} series of experiments. The exper iments w e r e performed using a mixture of low boiling <b>point</b> hydrocarbons, <b>wh</b> ich had a positive spreading coefficient for the oil phase in contact wi th water and its own vapour. In an oil-wet matrix, nucleation of gas bubbles occurred {{on the surface of the}} matrix. While it was impossible to de termine w h e r e nucleation occurred in the water-wet condition, the results suggest that wettability influences the gas nucleation behaviour. In a water-wet system, the o i l-wa te r interfacial tension controlled the growth pa t te rn for the gas bubbles, but in an oil-wet system the gas-oil interfacial tension was the controlling parameter. As a result, it seems likely that wettability influences the critical saturation for mobilization of the gas phase. The behaviour of the oil phase during depressurization is influenced by wettability. In a water-wet system the physical form of the oil is changed from immobile droplets into films wh ich may be t ransported wi th the gas phase, and in which the oil is mobile. In contrast in an oil-wet system, the oil phase can move as films w h e n the gas is released from solution but generally will not initially move over many pores...|$|R

40|$|Hernando de Zafra was {{secretary}} {{and a very}} important person {{in the court of}} the Catholic Kings, whose origin, as Fern??ndez de Oviedo says, is very humble. Zafra's fame and fortune were his participation in the agreement for the delivery of the city of Granada, and, the commission that the Kings confided him te rule this city since its conquest in 1492 to 1507, when he died. The ability and secret of the business men were complete, and these texts about the capitulations have been kept. Garrido de Atienza has published a series of these documents in 1910; there are rough copies of letters sent to Boabdil and the nobles of Granada by the Kings; and to the Moslem business Men by Hernando de Zafra. Most of these documents have not date but their record is quite certain. I have completed this information with some documents that I founded in the Archive of the Real Chanciller??a of Granada, where the will and all the scripts about rent are. The Catholic Kings looked for their collaborators with a great sense of touch, it was a success in the case of Hernando de Zafra; it was not strange that ithe tread of a very good administrator would be in his country house. When he was born he did not have anything, but when he died, as the testament shows us, he had an immense fortune. But, the royal grants did not contribute to it, it was just his own The Catholic Kings gave him the fortress of Castril in 1490, beside it, a village will grow and an excellent factory of glass will be created, which will become very famous. We can see him taking part in the building of a "ba- tan", a very important industry in Granada. The other scripts about the lease of different properties ??? fundamentally ovens and mills???, although his only one son did them, are inspired in the economic criterion of Hernando de Zafra. Al his properties were spread when he died, in spite of his will. Hernando de Zafra made his testament in April, 12, 1507, in Granada, and it was opened the same year, in May, 28. And, he arranged that his natural son, Hernando S??nchez de Zafra, would be heir alter his mother's death. And, if the legitimation would not be enough, his nephew, Francisco de Zafra, would heir a great part, and so Tejutor, Aranales and Fi??ana, would be for his son. The testament is a long series of legacies, and he does not forget neither his relatives nor his :servants and providers, nor the convent which he founded, and where he was buried. A curious <b>point</b> <b>wh.</b> ich shows us that he was a wealthy man is when he arranges that while his wife and son are coming, the expensives of both houses were paid for the "mayorazgo", and they would divide the rest in two parts: one for the increase of the properties, and the other one would be dividad in two parts too: one for the redemption of captives and the other one to help the poors...|$|E
40|$|Observations confirm {{correctness}} of {{the statement}} that the best recommendation for a stallion is his progeny. The {{aim of this study}} was indicating purebred Arabian stallions passing on to their progeny best conformation traits, assessed in Polish shows, in the past decade, taking into consideration their origin. The analysis included national and foreign stallions used in Polish breeding of purebred Arabian horses, which are fathers of at least 5 heads of progeny. The authors own research proved that progeny of foreign stallions statistically differed significantly from the progeny sired by Polish stallions within all conformation traits tested in shows. In the studied period, the highest final score (91. 37 points) and note for the trait type (19. 11 points) was characteristic of the progeny of QR Marc. The best head was passed on by stallions: QR Marc (19. 06 <b>points)</b> and <b>WH</b> Justice (18. 78 points), born in the United States and owned by the European breeders. In the Top Ten of producers passing on a refined head to their progeny, there was only one Polish stallion bred in the Horse Stud Michalw, Ekstern (18. 29 points). Progeny with the most correct body structure was sired by foreign stallions, Eden C (18. 13 points) and QR Marc (18. 13 points), and by the Polish stallion, Zlocien (17. 95 points). The highest score for the trait legs was obtained by the progeny of the Qatar stallion Gazal Al Shaqab (16. 30 points). However, the title of the father of the best movers got an Israeli stallion, Laheeb (18. 91 points) ...|$|R
