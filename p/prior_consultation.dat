At {{the end of}} August 1965, they did not consider a Rhodesian UDI an immediate threat, and therefore focussed on the colony's maintained defiance of the mother country regarding Reedman and Lisbon. On 30 August, Johnston summarised Britain's stand on the issue for Bottomley's Commonwealth Relations Office. According to his understanding, he said, Rhodesia had been told just before Federal dissolution that it would retain the Federation's former powers regarding external affairs, but that this entrustment was subject to British discretion, {{and could not be}} exercised without extensive <b>prior</b> <b>consultation</b> and conformity to Britain's line.|$|E
5|$|The Montreal Laboratory {{had been}} a {{fruitful}} and successful international venture, although the Canadians had on occasion been resentful of British actions that were perceived as high-handed and insensitive. One such action came in November 1945 when the British government suddenly announced that Cockcroft {{had been a}}ppointed {{the head of the}} new Atomic Energy Research Establishment in Britain without any <b>prior</b> <b>consultation</b> {{and at a time when}} the NRX reactor was still under construction. Cockcroft did not depart Canada until September 1946, but it was a sure sign of waning British interest in collaboration with Canada. The British suggested he be replaced by the British physicist Bennett Lewis, who was eventually appointed, but only after the Canadian-born Walter Zinn turned the job down.|$|E
5|$|In R. v. Criminal Injuries Compensation Board, {{ex parte}} Lain (1967), {{it was held}} that {{the powers of the}} Board were in {{principle}} reviewable, despite it having been established under prerogative powers. This case was cited with approval in the GCHQ case, which reflects the modern position on the reviewability of prerogative powers in the United Kingdom. In this case, their Lordships unanimously held that executive action was not immune from judicial review merely because it was carried out in pursuance of a power derived from the common law (or the prerogative) rather than a statutory source. It was the subject-matter that counted, not the source. In this case, the Government, through an order in council, banned employees of the Government Communications Headquarters from joining a trade union. The House of Lords held that this exercise of the prerogative was judicially reviewable, and the trade unions had a legitimate expectation of <b>prior</b> <b>consultation</b> before the ban was imposed. However, although the failure to consult the unions was unfair, this lapse from proper procedure was overridden by national security considerations and thus not justiciable.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Emergency {{diagnosis}} of cancer is common and aetiologically complex. The proportion of emergency presenters who have consulted previously with relevant symptoms is uncertain. AIM: To examine how many patients with cancer, who were diagnosed as emergencies, have had previous primary care consultations with relevant symptoms; and among those, {{to examine how}} many had multiple consultations. DESIGN AND SETTING: Secondary analysis of patient survey data from the 2010 English Cancer Patient Experience Survey (CPES), previously linked to population-based data on diagnostic route. METHOD: For emergency presenters with 18 different cancers, associations were examined for two outcomes (<b>prior</b> GP <b>consultation</b> status; and 'three or more consultations' among prior consultees) using logistic regression. RESULTS: Among 4647 emergency presenters, 1349 (29 %) reported no <b>prior</b> <b>consultations,</b> being more common in males (32 % versus 25 % in females, P< 0. 001), older (44 % in ≥ 85 versus 30 % in 65 - 74 -year-olds, P< 0. 001), and the most deprived (35 % versus 25 % least deprived, P = 0. 001) patients; and highest/lowest for patients with brain cancer (46 %) and mesothelioma (13 %), respectively (P< 0. 001 for overall variation by cancer site). Among 3298 emergency presenters with <b>prior</b> <b>consultations,</b> 1356 (41 %) had three or more consultations, which were more likely in females (P< 0. 001), younger (P< 0. 001), and non-white patients (P = 0. 017) and those with multiple myeloma, and least likely for patients with leukaemia (P< 0. 001). CONCLUSION: Contrary to suggestions that emergency presentations represent missed diagnoses, about one-third of emergency presenters (particularly those in older and more deprived groups) have no <b>prior</b> GP <b>consultations.</b> Furthermore, only about one-third report multiple (three or more) consultations, which are more likely in 'harder-to-suspect' groups.

25|$|The title {{appeared}} in Classical Greece {{in the late}} 5th century BC, and was used for generals given independent authority, i.e. a supreme commander (stratēgos autokratōr). In Classical Athens, stratēgoi autokratores were generals endowed with autonomous power of command, i.e. {{they were able to}} make certain military and diplomatic decisions without <b>prior</b> <b>consultation</b> with the Athenian assembly. This was enacted when the general was expected to operate far from Athens, for instance during the Sicilian Expedition. Nevertheless, the generals remained accountable to the assembly for their conduct upon their return. Similar practices were followed by other Greek states, such as Syracuse, where the post served as a power base for several of the city's tyrants. Stratēgoi autokratores were also appointed by various leagues of city-states to head their combined armies. Thus Philip II of Macedon was declared as hēgemōn and stratēgos autokratōr of the southern Greek states by the League of Corinth, a position later given to his son Alexander the Great as well. The term was also employed for envoys entrusted with plenipotentiary powers (presbeis autokratores).|$|E

The tunnel had been in place for about a dozen years, but open {{conflict}} broke out after the government of Benjamin Netanyahu decided to open a new entrance to the tunnel from the Via Dolorosa in the Muslim quarter of the Old City. Palestinians and the Islamic Waqf authorities were outraged that the decision was taken without <b>prior</b> <b>consultation.</b> They claimed that the work threatened the foundations of the compound and those of houses in the Muslim quarter and that it was actually aimed at tunnelling under the holy compound complex to find remains of Solomon's Temple, similar to previous accusations in the 1980s. As a result of the rumor, Arabs rioted in Jerusalem and then spread to the West Bank, leading to the deaths of 86 Palestinians and 15 Israeli soldiers.|$|E

500|$|At the Combined Policy Committee {{meeting in}} February 1946, without <b>prior</b> <b>consultation</b> with Canada, the British {{announced}} {{their intention to}} build a graphite-moderated nuclear reactor in the United Kingdom.

The Canadians had been given what they deemed assurances that the Chalk River Laboratories would be a joint enterprise, and regarded the British decision as a breach of faith. Anglo-American cooperation largely ended in April 1946 when Truman declared that the United States would not assist Britain in the design, construction or operation of a plutonium production reactor.
