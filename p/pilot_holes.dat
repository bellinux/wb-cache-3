50|$|When a screw {{is driven}} into a {{material}} without a <b>pilot</b> <b>hole,</b> it {{can act as}} a wedge, generating outward pressure which can cause many materials to split. By drilling a small <b>pilot</b> <b>hole</b> into the material, into which a screw is then driven, less wedging takes place, thereby reducing the likelihood of the material being split. The proper size <b>pilot</b> <b>hole</b> also improves the resistance of the screw to pulling out of the material or loosening under load.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACTObjective: To assess if {{the screw}} design (self-drilling/self-tapping) and the <b>pilot</b> <b>hole</b> tapping {{could affect the}} {{insertion}} torque and screw pullout strength of the screw used in anterior fixation of the cervical spine. Methods: Forty self-tapping screws and 20 self-drilling screws were inserted into 10 models of artificial bone and 10 cervical vertebrae of sheep. The studied parameters were the insertion torque and pullout strength. The following groups were created: Group I-self-tapping screw insertion after <b>pilot</b> <b>hole</b> drilling and tapping; Group II-self-tapping screw insertion after <b>pilot</b> <b>hole</b> drilling without tapping; Group III-self-drilling screw insertion without drilling and tapping. In Groups I and II, the <b>pilot</b> <b>hole</b> had 14. 0 mm in depth and was made with a 3 mmn drill, while tapping was made with a 4 mm tap. The insertion torque was measured and the pullout test was performed. The comparison between groups was made considering the mean insertion torque and the maximum mean pullout strength with the variance analysis (ANOVA; p≤ 0. 05). Results: Previous drilling and tapping of <b>pilot</b> <b>hole</b> significantly decreased the insertion torque and the pullout strength. Conclusion: The insertion torque and pullout strength of self-drilling screws were significantly higher when compared to self-tapping screws inserted after <b>pilot</b> <b>hole</b> tapping...|$|R
50|$|In {{traditional}} {{raise boring}} operations, mining companies use a drilling technique known as ‘up-reaming’. Normally, {{this type of}} rig first drills a small <b>pilot</b> <b>hole</b> downward, then large machine cutters {{are attached to the}} drill which is sticking out the bottom of the <b>pilot</b> <b>hole.</b> The massive cutters are pulled up as they grind through thick rock, boring along the <b>pilot</b> <b>hole.</b> In this case however, since the space below was blocked and the raise bore bit could not be attached from underground, the rig was modified to widen the hole from above.|$|R

50|$|When a screw {{is driven}} without a <b>pilot</b> <b>hole,</b> or with too small a <b>pilot</b> <b>hole,</b> {{the core of}} the screw may bind and lead to the screw being broken.

For common wood screws, the pilot providing clearance for {{the core of the}} screw may be followed by a larger bit to shallower depth to provide clearance for the larger, unthreaded shank of the screw. For standard wood screws, special pilot drill bits are manufactured to produce the correct hole profile in a single operation, rather than needing several different drill bit sizes and depths.|$|R

5000|$|The {{pilot hole}} also reduces the power needed {{to turn a}} large drill bit, and reduces the large bit {{breakage}} risk. For twist drill bits, the pilot size is usually selected so that the chisel point of the larger drill {{does not need to}} remove any material, which reduces the chance of splitting the web of the bit. A pilot thus sized also prevents a larger drill bit from slipping on the material and guides the larger bit effectively. Very large holes may be stepped by drilling successively larger <b>pilot</b> <b>holes</b> before the final size drill is used.|$|E

50|$|Sometimes wood {{splitting}} is undesirable. Methods to prevent splitting in woodworking are the butterfly joint, truss connector plates, or metal straps. Columns may be hollowed {{in the center}} to prevent splitting. Nail points may be blunted or <b>pilot</b> <b>holes</b> drilled to prevent splitting of lumber while nailing or screwing. End grain sealers are liquid products usually containing wax which helps prevent rapid drying of the ends of lumber resulting in splits.

50|$|The {{most common}} use of bone {{grafting}} {{is in the}} application of dental implants to restore the edentulous area of a missing tooth. Dental implants require bones underneath them for support and proper integration into the mouth. As mentioned earlier bone grafts come in various forms such as autologous (from the same person), Allograft, Xenograft (mainly bovine bone), and Alloplastic materials. Bone grafts can be used prior to implant placement or simultaneously. People who have been edentulous (without teeth) for a prolonged period may not have enough bone left in the necessary locations. In this case, bone can be taken from the chin, from the <b>pilot</b> <b>holes</b> for the implants, or even from the iliac crest of the pelvis and inserted into the mouth underneath the new implant.|$|E
5000|$|Chinese elm {{heartwood}} ranges in tone from reddish brown {{to light}} tan or flesh coloured, while the sapwood approaches off-white. The grain is often handsome and dramatic. Unlike other elms, freshly cut Chinese elm has a peppery or spicy odour. While it turns easily {{and will take}} a nice polish off the lathe without any finish, and it holds detail well, the fibrous wood is usually considered too tough for carving or hand tools. Chinese elm contains silica which is hard on planer knives and chainsaws, but it sands fairly easily. Like other woods with interlocking grain, planes should be kept extra sharp to prevent tearing at the grain margins. It steam-bends easily, holds screws well but <b>pilot</b> <b>holes</b> and countersinking are needed. It {{tends to be a}} [...] "lively" [...] wood, tending to warp and distort while drying.

50|$|The {{excavation}} {{of the eastern}} bore began in June 2005 (according to another source in May 2005) and boring of the western tunnel began in October of the same year. The excavation ran every day around the clock and was only Interrupted {{for one or two}} weeks over Christmas and on the feast day of Saint Barbara, patron saint of tunnellers (4 December). The tunnellers worked in two shifts of ten hours and four hours during the night was set aside for the maintenance of equipment and for the drilling of <b>pilot</b> <b>holes</b> for exploring the ground ahead. The advance of the eastern tunnel between tunnel-kilometers 3.7 and 4.3 experienced unexpected delays after an inflow of from 20 to 30 litres of water per second were experienced at the rock face and a closed-face tunnelling method had to be adopted. The tunneling of the western bore avoided a delay by making a timely change in tunnelling method.|$|E
50|$|Many owners stored, abandoned, or {{sold their}} {{incomplete}} kits, {{but a few}} hundred diehard builders finished them {{with a variety of}} engines, with installations designed by third parties and former Bede Aircraft dealers. Having to hunt for an engine was only one problem. The time to build the aircraft was much longer than quoted, as much as 3,500 hours. Some of this was due to the need to fit their selected engine into an airframe designed for the Hirth, which was no longer available. Additionally, the construction techniques had improved somewhat since early Bede designs, but fastening the panels still required drilling, deburring, dimpling, drilling again and deburring again for each rivet. With the original mixed-construction design this would not have been as much of a task, but with the all-metal version this was extremely time consuming. While Bede claimed the aircraft could be put together by anyone in a garage, builders generally agree that doing so without proper construction techniques could result in a potentially dangerous aircraft. One way to overcome that issue is to use a set of properly laid-out jigs to align and drill the <b>pilot</b> <b>holes</b> for the airframe, wings and other components. For all of these reasons, it was some time before completed BD-5s started to appear.|$|E
40|$|Pedicle screws {{are placed}} using <b>pilot</b> <b>holes.</b> The {{trajectory}} of <b>pilot</b> <b>holes</b> can be verified by pedicle sounding or radiographs. However, a pilot hole {{alone does not}} insure that the screw will follow the pilot hole. No studies have characterized the risk of misalignment of a pedicle screw with respect to its pilot hole trajectory. The objective {{of this study was}} to measure the misalignment angles between pedicle screws and <b>pilot</b> <b>holes</b> with or without tapping. Six human cadaveric thoracic spines were used. One hundred and forty <b>pilot</b> <b>holes</b> were created with a straight probe. Steel wires were temporarily inserted and their positions were recorded with CT scans. The left pedicles were tapped with 4. 5  mm fluted tap and the right pedicles remained untapped. Pedicle screws (5. 5  mm) were inserted into the tapped and untapped pedicles followed by CT scans. The trajectories of <b>pilot</b> <b>holes</b> and screws were calculated using three-dimensional vector analysis. A total of 133 <b>pilot</b> <b>holes</b> (95 %) were inside pedicles. For the untapped side, 14 out of 68 (20 %) screws did not follow the <b>pilot</b> <b>holes</b> and were outside the pedicles. For the tapped side, 2 out of 65 (3 %) did not follow and breached the pedicles. The average misalignment angles between the screw and pilot hole trajectory were 7. 7 ° ±  6. 5 ° and 5. 6 ° ±  3. 2 ° for the untapped side and tapped side, respectively (P <  0. 05). Most pedicle screws had lateral screw breach (13 out of 16) whereas most <b>pilot</b> <b>holes</b> had medial pedicle breach (6 out of 7). Tapping of <b>pilot</b> <b>holes</b> (1  mm undertap) helps align pedicle screws and reduces the risk of screw malposition. Although most pedicle screws had lateral breach, the risk of medial pedicle breach of the <b>pilot</b> <b>holes</b> must be recognized...|$|E
