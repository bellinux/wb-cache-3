40|$|Background: Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (lupus) and its {{complications}} could lower individual’s health-related {{quality of}} life (HRQOL). Self-care is highly needed to build independency and sustain self-involvement in lupus management. People with lupus need to have proper sensory knowledge and high self-efficacy for implementing optimal <b>preventive</b> <b>action</b> towards trigger factors and self-care practice at home. This study aims to explain the correlation between sensory knowledge, self-efficacy, <b>preventive</b> <b>action</b> towards trigger factors, self-care practice and HRQOL in people with lupus. Methodology: This is a cross-sectional study mixing the model of Self-Care and Precede Proceed. Population was all lupus patients doing regular check up in Rheumatology Unit of Dr. Soetomo Hospital {{in the period of}} October-December 2014. Sample size was 36 chosen by total sampling. Independent variables: sensory knowledge, self-efficacy, <b>preventive</b> <b>action</b> towards trigger factors and self-care practice; dependent variable: HRQOL. Instruments used were ODAPUS-HEBI and LUPUSPRO. Data analysis was using regression test; α≤ 0. 05. Result: 36 respondents participated, all were females. Age range was 20 - 44 years old. Mostly were high school graduates, married and still actively working. Disease duration was 0. 5 – 12 years. Most respondents have high sensory knowledge and self-efficacy; optimum <b>preventive</b> <b>action</b> towards trigger factors and self-care practice, but HRQOL was not optimal. All data were normally distributed. Only sensory knowledge proved to be linear with HRQOL. There was a weak significant correlation identified between sensory knowledge and HRQOL (r= 0. 344, p= 0. 040); while self-efficacy, <b>preventive</b> <b>action</b> towards exposure and self-care practice proved to have no correlation with HRQOL (p>α). Conclusion: Sensory knowledge is correlated with HRQOL in people with lupus. Self-efficacy, <b>preventive</b> <b>action</b> towards trigger factors and self-care practice were proved to have no correlation...|$|R

40|$|Various {{diseases}} and physiological disturbances can caouse bedrest condition. Immobilization {{for a long}} time (bedrest) can cause some physiological responds suchas : the change of musculloskeletal system, cardiovascular change, respiratory change, urinary change, bowel change and inlegument change. Inlegument change may cause ulkus dekubitus. Ulkus dekubitus is an impact of pinched blood vessel between sufferer’s bone and sufferer’s bad board. In the effort to increase health level, nurse’s knowledge about ulkus and both its cause and <b>preventive</b> <b>action</b> is needed. Therefore, researcher is interested in doing research on nurse’s knowledge level about <b>preventive</b> <b>action</b> of ulkus dekubitus on bedrest patient. This research has purpose to know nurse’s knowledge level about <b>preventive</b> <b>action</b> of ulkus dekubitus on bedrest patient that is treated in hospital. Advantage of this research is ti minimize the occurance of ulkus dekubitus, so that people belief in hospital treatment increase. Design which is used in this research is descriptive with population sample of all nurse in internal, surgical, neurological shed totaled 56 respondents. Method used is quantitative score. After the research was done, it is obtained that nurse’s knowledge about <b>preventive</b> <b>action</b> of ulkus dekubitus is 80, 79...|$|R

40|$|When {{there are}} safety representatives (SRs) at the {{workplace}} {{higher levels of}} <b>preventive</b> <b>action</b> have been observed. However, no study has analyzed workers’ health and safety results when workers (do not) know they have SRs. Based on data from the VII Spanish Working Conditions Survey (2011), this paper explores differences in the intensity of self-reported <b>preventive</b> <b>action</b> among workers reporting to have SRs at their workplaces, workers reporting not having them, and workers unaware of SRs’ existence. The sample included employees aged 16 to 65 years working at firms with 6 workers or more (n= 5, 562). A multinomial logistic regression was undertaken to study the association between the reported existence of SRs and levels of <b>preventive</b> <b>action</b> (high, intermediate and non-existent), comparing workers unaware of SRs’ existence to those reporting to have SRs and those reporting no SRs. Models were adjusted by socio-demographic and employment-related features. It was found that workers reporting SRs’ existence were protected by greater <b>preventive</b> <b>action,</b> both at the intermediate (aOR= 2. 87, 95 % CI 2. 39 to 3. 44) and high level (aOR= 10. 26, 95 % CI 7. 27 to 14. 50), {{and that there were}} no statistically significant differences between workers reporting not to have SRs and those unaware of SRs. Our results draw attention to a group of workers who might have SRs without being aware of it and remain less protected by <b>preventive</b> <b>action.</b> These workers would benefit from interventions aimed at making SRs known and available to all workers...|$|R
