50|$|Historically, most early {{computer}} hardware {{was designed as}} proprietary until the 1980s, when IBM PC changed this paradigm. Earlier, in the 1970s, many vendors tried to challenge IBM's monopoly in the mainframe computer market by reverse engineering and producing hardware components electrically compatible with expensive equipment and (usually) able to run the same software. Those vendors were nicknamed <b>plug</b> <b>compatible</b> <b>manufacturers</b> (<b>PCMs).</b>|$|R
5000|$|Note {{also the}} {{confusing}} term [...] "System/370-compatible", {{which appeared in}} IBM source documents to describe certain products. Outside IBM, this term would more often describe systems from Amdahl Corporation, Hitachi Ltd., and others, that could run the same S/370 software. This choice of terminology by IBM {{may have been a}} deliberate attempt to ignore the existence of those <b>plug</b> <b>compatible</b> <b>manufacturers</b> (<b>PCMs),</b> because they competed aggressively against IBM hardware dominance.|$|R
50|$|A plug-compatible {{machine is}} one that has been {{designed}} to be backward compatible with a prior machine. In particular, a new computer system that is plug-compatible has not only the same connectors and protocol interfaces to peripherals, but also binary code compatibilityâ€”it runs the same software as the old system. A <b>plug</b> <b>compatible</b> <b>manufacturer</b> or <b>PCM</b> is a company that makes such products.|$|R
50|$|The first {{disk drive}} to use {{removable}} media was the IBM 1311 drive. It {{was introduced in}} 1962 using the IBM 1316 disk pack to store two million characters. It {{was followed by the}} IBM 2311 (1964) 5 megabyte and IBM 2314 (1965) 29 megabyte disk pack HDDs.Memorex in 1968 shipped the first HDD, the Memorex 630, <b>plug</b> <b>compatible</b> to an IBM model 2311 marking the beginning of independent competition (<b>Plug</b> <b>Compatible</b> <b>Manufacturers</b> or <b>PCMs)</b> for HDDs attached to IBM systems. It was followed in 1969 by the Memorex 660, an IBM 2314 compatible, which was OEM'ed to DEC and resold as the RP02.|$|R
5000|$|In a {{response}} to competition from <b>plug</b> <b>compatible</b> <b>manufacturers</b> of 2314 equivalent storage subsystems, IBM beginning 1970 introduced a series of low priced three drive module 2319s which were manufactured by removing one module from the four drive module 2313, rebranding it as a 2319 A1 and offering it at a substantially reduced rental price. This {{had the effect of}} lowering the rental price to new customers while keeping the high rental price on existing customers. The 2319-A1 attaches to integrated controllers for only the System/370 Models 135 and 145. Conventional 2314 DASD such as the 2312 or 2318 can attach to the 2319-A1 ...|$|R
50|$|After the 1972 {{introduction}} of the Intel 4004, microprocessor costs declined rapidly. In 1974 the American electronics magazine Radio-Electronics described the Mark-8 computer kit, based on the Intel 8008 processor. In January of the following year, Popular Electronics magazine published an article describing a kit based on the Intel 8080, a somewhat more powerful {{and easier to use}} processor. The Altair 8800 sold remarkably well even though initial memory size was limited to a few hundred bytes and there was no software available. However, the Altair kit was much less costly than an Intel development system of the time and so was purchased by companies interested in developing microprocessor control for their own products. Expansion memory boards and peripherals were soon listed by the original manufacturer, and later by <b>plug</b> <b>compatible</b> <b>manufacturers.</b> The very first Microsoft product was a 4 kilobyte paper tape BASIC interpreter, which allowed users to develop programs in a higher-level language. The alternative was to hand-assemble machine code that could be directly loaded into the microcomputer's memory using a front panel of toggle switches, pushbuttons and LED displays. While the hardware front panel emulated those used by early mainframe and minicomputers, after a very short time I/O through a terminal was the preferred human/machine interface, and front panels became extinct.|$|R

5000|$|The Anderson Powerpole is {{a family}} of {{electrical}} connectors by Anderson Power Products (APP), although <b>plug</b> <b>compatible</b> connectors are now available from alternate sources. Specific variants of this series of connectors have become de facto standards for conveying [...] "higher power" [...] direct current (DC) electrical power, although these standards are inconsistent and sometimes ignored.|$|R
50|$|In general, plug-compatible {{systems are}} {{designed}} where industry or de facto standards have rigorously defined the environment, {{and there is}} a large installed population of machines that can benefit from third-party enhancements. <b>Plug</b> <b>compatible</b> does not mean identical replacement.

50|$|One of {{the largest}} {{collections}} of DECsystem-10 architecture systems ever assembled was at CompuServe, which at its peak operated over 200 loosely coupled systems in three data centers in Columbus, Ohio. CompuServe used these systems as 'hosts', providing access to commercial applications {{as well as the}} CompuServe Information Service. While the first such systems were purchased from DEC, when DEC abandoned the PDP-10 architecture in favor of the VAX, CompuServe and other PDP-10 customers began purchasing <b>plug</b> <b>compatible</b> computers from Systems Concepts. As of January 2007, CompuServe continues to operate a small number of PDP-10 architecture machines to perform some billing and routing functions.|$|R

50|$|The Argus 500, {{designed}} about 3 years later, used parallel arithmetic and {{was much}} faster. It {{was designed to}} be plugged into a larger 19 inch rack mounted frame, together with up to four core store (memory) units. The Argus 400 was repackaged to be the same as the Argus 500 and the two machines were <b>plug</b> <b>compatible.</b> The Argus 400 used 18 small PCBs for its CPU each of which was wire-wrapped to the backplane using 70 miniature wire wraps. Removing a card was tedious. The Argus 500 initially used the same packages, and also wire-wrap, on larger boards, but later versions employed dual-in-line ICs which were soldered flat onto the PCB and were much easier to remove.|$|R

50|$|The {{original}} IBM OS/360 Object File Format {{was developed}} in 1964 for the new IBM System/360 mainframe computer. The format was also used by makers of <b>plug</b> <b>compatible</b> and workalike mainframes, including the Univac 90/60, 90/70 and 90/80 and Fujitsu B2800. The format was expanded to add symbolic records and expanded information about modules, plus support for procedures and functions with names longer than 8 characters. While this helped, it did not provide for the enhanced information necessary for today's more complicated programming languages and more advanced features such as objects, properties and methods, Unicode support, and virtual methods (a procedure in an object that is not known which procedure is invoked until the program runs, because a later definition of a procedure with the same name in a descendant object replaces the original procedure in the ancestor object).|$|R
5000|$|As the 6502 is {{externally}} clocked, {{upgrading the}} speed {{involves more than}} dropping a faster chip into the processor socket; many other components {{also need to be}} modified. To meet user demand, a number of companies sold hardware to speed up those systems. These [...] "accelerators" [...] included a modicum of high-speed RAM and glue circuitry used to synchronize the faster processor with the computer's original RAM and its peripherals. For example, the Apple II floppy disk relied on software accessing the controller's I/O registers with critical timing; Apple II accelerators were therefore designed to fall back to 1 MHz during disk access. The first accelerators were circuit boards; some later accelerators (such as the Zip Chip) miniaturized the processor and support circuits to fit into a DIP package that was <b>plug</b> <b>compatible</b> with the original processor.|$|R
