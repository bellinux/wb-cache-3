25|$|One of {{the newest}} {{organizational}} structures developed in the 20th century is team and the related concept of team development or team building. In small businesses, the team structure can define the entire organization. Teams can be both horizontal and vertical. While an organization is constituted {{as a set of}} people who synergize individual competencies to achieve newer dimensions, the quality of organizational structure revolves around the competencies of teams in totality. For example, every one of the Whole Foods Market stores, the largest natural-foods grocer in the US developing a focused strategy, is an autonomous <b>profit</b> <b>centre</b> composed of an average of 10 self-managed teams, while team leaders in each store and each region are also a team. Larger bureaucratic organizations can benefit from the flexibility of teams as well. Xerox, Motorola, and DaimlerChrysler are all among the companies that actively use teams to perform tasks.|$|E

50|$|A {{cost centre}} adds to a firm's cost whereas a <b>profit</b> <b>centre</b> {{adds to the}} firm's cost and profit. Furthermore, the main {{objective}} of a cost centre is to minimise cost whereas the main objective of a <b>profit</b> <b>centre</b> is to maximise profit. Profit centres provide a wider and more general measurement of performance than the cost centre. In cost centre, the manager is only responsible for the cost whereas in a <b>profit</b> <b>centre,</b> the manager is responsible for cost and profit. In situations like this when manager is responsible for both, profit and cost, the contribution of each manager {{to the goal of}} the firm becomes easier to measure.|$|E

50|$|A {{revenue centre}} has costs, however {{to the manager}} of a revenue centre this is of little {{importance}} as revenue is his sole performance indicator. Not all costs are ignored in a revenue centre. For example, {{the manager of a}} revenue centre is responsible for the expenses of his department (such as maintenance costs). In a sales office (the most widespread example of a revenue centre), maintenance costs can be construed as rent, salaries, taxes and security. However, any costs related to product sale and manufacturing are not included in such expenses. A revenue centre becomes a <b>profit</b> <b>centre</b> if the latter is encompassed, thus making a <b>profit</b> <b>centre</b> a blend of both a cost and revenue centre.|$|E

40|$|Through the accounts, {{the article}} {{examines}} the management practices employed on the Bowes estates in order to ascertain whether they were managed as <b>profit</b> <b>centres</b> to be exploited, and whether accounting aided managerial activity {{at this early stage}} of industrial development. The majority of the estate accounts were designed to keep track of rights and obligations. The survival of cost analysis, profit statements and planning data indicates that the estates were not treated simply as units of consumption and that the accounts played an important facilitating role. There are indications that a knowledge-power mechanism also existed within the estates, casting doubt both on the mutual exclusivity of Economic-rationalist and Foucauldian explanations of accounting activities and on the notion that a relevant distinction exists between modern and pre-modern business organization.

This paper argues that the higher education sector in Zimbabwe has changed significantly {{from what it was}} in 1957 when the University of Zimbabwe was established. Due to excessive demand for higher education, and the unavailability of adequate funding, universities need to borrow concepts from the world of business to survive in a volatile market. Institutions such as the Zimbabwe Open University have developed a strategic plan and a balance scorecard that is intended to assist the institution in responding to competitive forces within the higher education sector. Funding remains one of the main challenges for universities. Therefore, we have to develop structures, processes, cultures and products that will enable us to move away from viewing universities as cost <b>centres</b> to <b>profit</b> <b>centres</b> that generate income and in the process improve our products and processes...|$|R

Furthermore, it is observed that semi-profit centres have the most challenging task as they are in an invidious middle position they have to bid for internal projects in order to cover their costs while their freedom to attract external customers or to use a cost plus transfer price is usually limited...|$|R
