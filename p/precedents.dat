40|$|The article {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} <b>precedent</b> names as symbols of <b>precedent</b> phenomena in the material and spiritual culture of the Chinese. An evaluation of daily events and {{the attitude of the}} Chinese towards the world are reflected in the vocabulary of their language. The symbols of <b>precedent</b> phenomena can be proper names (anthroponomy, names of places), the date, as well as figurative and expressive means of language (idioms, sayings). <b>Precedent</b> names as symbols of <b>precedent</b> phenomena vividly and accurately capture the above-mentioned points, and encompass almost all spheres of life, history and spiritual development. The subject of our study are national <b>precedent</b> phenomena that define the ethno-cultural specificity, reflecting the history and culture of the Chinese people and their national character. Representatives of different cultures have different perceptions of the same <b>precedent</b> phenomena. Inadequate understanding of national invariants of <b>precedent</b> phenomena is often the source of communication failures. The aim {{of this paper is to}} highlight <b>precedent</b> names as a symbol of <b>precedent</b> phenomena in the discourse of the Chinese linguocultural community. For this purpose a classification of <b>precedent</b> names in Chinese was carried out. <b>Precedent</b> names which play an important role in shaping the Chinese national consciousness were taken from the Chinese-Russian Dictionary...|$|R

40|$|In modern {{domestic}} and foreign linguistics, there are many works dedicated {{to the study of}} typological characteristics of <b>precedent</b> phenomena. However, <b>precedent</b> religious names have not been comprehensively determined as an integral component of the overall base of <b>precedent</b> units. This emphasizes the urgency to turn to the classification of <b>precedent</b> religious names used in the artistic works of contemporary Ukrainian writers. The purpose of the article is to classify <b>precedent</b> religious names on the material of modern Ukrainian literature. Objective: to summarize the features of <b>precedent</b> religious names used in the mentioned sources, and systemize them according to the following criteria: type of a proper name, which is the basis of a <b>precedent</b> name, symbolic filling of a <b>precedent</b> religious name, and number of steady components of a <b>precedent</b> religious name. As a result of the study there were marked out theonyms, angelonyms and agionyms, demonyms and orkonyms, biblical mythotoponyms, iconyms, anthroponyms, biblionyms, ecclesionyms, heortonyms, periodonyms, processonyms, biblical oiconyms, oronyms, hydronyms; by specifics of symbolic filling there were picked out terminological and polysemantic <b>precedent</b> religious names; by the number of required components there were separated one-composite, composed tied, composed free, composed free with one obligatory part, and double <b>precedent</b> religious names...|$|R
5|$|As English courts do {{not form}} part of Singapore's {{hierarchy}} of courts, decisions of such courts are not binding on Singapore courts. However, {{as a result of}} Singapore's colonial heritage, English judicial <b>precedents</b> continue to exercise a strong influence on the legal system and are regarded as highly persuasive, particularly as regards the development of the common law, and the interpretation of English statutes applicable in Singapore and Singapore statutes modelled on English enactments. Judicial <b>precedents</b> from other jurisdictions may also be persuasive in specific areas of Singapore law. For instance, Indian decisions are persuasive in the areas of criminal law and procedure because Singapore borrowed heavily from India in these areas.|$|E
5|$|Finally, Burton {{argued that}} the Eastern District of Missouri was an unconstitutional venue and vicinage (an {{argument}} that the Court had accepted in Burton I). This time, the Court rejected the argument. The Court held that the agreement had occurred in St. Louis (as the jury had been instructed that it was required to find) based on Rialto's acceptance in St. Louis, the telegram, and the letter. The Court bolstered this view by citation to its own and other <b>precedents</b> concerning offer and acceptance in contract law. The Court further cited its earlier <b>precedents</b> holding that the venue provision of Article III {{does not require the}} physical presence of the defendant in the forum state.|$|E

50|$|In {{the civil}} law system of Japan, {{judicial}} <b>precedent</b> provides non-binding guidance on how laws should be interpreted in practice.

40|$|This {{article is}} devoted to the linguocultural {{analysis}} of <b>precedent</b> phenomena as parts of Quebecois’ cognitive base. <b>Precedent</b> phenomena being cultural facts are one of the key issues in modern linguistic and cognitive studies. By <b>precedent</b> phenomena we mean, according to Y. E. Prohorov, such entities when verbalized in discourse that refer to a certain cultural fact behind them. In the article the <b>precedent</b> phenomena such as <b>precedent</b> text, <b>precedent</b> situation, <b>precedent</b> utterance, and <b>precedent</b> name are analyzed. The main theses of the precedence theory given in the article (Y. N. Karaulov, Y. E. Prohorov, V. V. Krasnyh, D. B. Gudkov) {{are at the heart of}} precedence studies on the basis of different languages. However, a complex analysis of <b>precedent</b> phenomena in the Quebec national variant of French is new to Russian linguistics. The study of <b>precedent</b> phenomena enables us to elicit features of their functioning in ethnospecific discourse and determine cultural dominants existing in Quebecois’ linguistic world view. Given the fact that the size of the article is limited, we undertooke the analysis of eight phenomena <b>precedent</b> of the bearers of Quebec linguoculture. The choice of phenomena is determined by the frequency of their use in discourse. The facts analyzed are of national character, i. e. known to all members of the linguocultural community. A certain cultural fact is at the very core of each <b>precedent</b> phenomenon given in the article. To get the whole picture we analysed historic, political, and cultural context connected to the <b>precedent</b> phenomena in question. The study enables us to elicit distinctive features that are at the core of each phenomenon. The results are backed with the supportive material drawn from analysis of different types of discourse. The analysis of <b>precedent</b> phenomena undertaken in this article allows us to reconstruct, to a certain extent, Quebec cultural space and is a stepping stone to the reconstruction of the Quebecois linguistic world view...|$|R

40|$|This volume {{presents}} {{a variety of}} both normative and descriptive perspectives {{on the use of}} <b>precedent</b> by the United States Supreme Court. It brings together a diverse group of American legal scholars, some of whom have been influenced by the Segal/Spaeth 2 ̆ 2 attitudinal 2 ̆ 2 model and some of whom have not. The group of contributors includes legal theorists and empiricists, constitutional lawyers and legal generalists, leading authorities and up-and-coming scholars. The book addresses questions such as how the Court establishes durable <b>precedent,</b> how the Court decides to overrule <b>precedent,</b> the effects of <b>precedent</b> on case selection, the scope of constitutional <b>precedent,</b> the influence of concurrences and dissents, and the normative foundations of constitutional <b>precedent.</b> Most of these questions have been addressed by the Court itself only obliquely, if at all. The volume will be valuable to readers both in the United States and abroad, particularly in light of ongoing debates over the role of <b>precedent</b> in civil-law nations and emerging legal systems.

5|$|While Yellowstone {{was under}} army management, the activities, {{policies}} and procedures developed served as <b>precedents</b> for other national parks and subsequent actions by the National Park Service after its formation in 1916. The army solved {{a wide variety of}} problems and developed procedures covering a multitude of administrative issues. The military superintendents continued the evolution of park policies and conservation measures initiated by the first civilian administrators. They implemented backcountry patrols, access improvement, wildlife protection and management, protection of natural features, law enforcement and development of a ranger force. The army set <b>precedents</b> for future headquarters area development designs, visitor services such as educational outreach and interpretive tours. Their diligence in dealing with poachers led to legislation that provided for prosecution and punishment of illegal activity. That most of the <b>precedents</b> that the army established were incorporated later by the National Park Service is a lasting legacy of the important role the army played in U.S. national park history. Modern Park Ranger uniforms are legacies of army management of the park. Most iconically, the campaign hat, a flat-brow peaked hat worn by the cavalry {{in the last years of}} army management is nearly identical to the modern hats worn into the 21stcentury.|$|E

40|$|The {{relation}} between stare decisis {{and the rule}} of law was raised in the joint opinion in Planned Parenthood v. Casey. This paper explores, in a layered way, the various rule-of-law principles that affect the issue of <b>precedent</b> – particularly in the basic case that may be made for creating and following <b>precedent.</b> (This is not the only way we can think about stare decisis but it is an important way.) It looks at the rule-of-law constraints affecting the initial decision of the 2 ̆ 2 <b>precedent</b> judge, 2 ̆ 2 the way in which a subsequent judge participates in upholding the generality of the <b>precedent</b> judge 2 ̆ 7 s decision, and the way in which subsequent judges are bound by rule-of-law principles of constancy once a <b>precedent</b> has emerged. The paper argues that it is very important to distinguish these various layers, so that the account of <b>precedent</b> is not question-begging. Above all, it is an implicit critique of those theories of <b>precedent</b> that emphasize particularistic case-to-case analogy. It argues for a more rule-oriented approach than that, on rule-of-law grounds...|$|R

Several people who helped establish the Plantations of Ireland also played a part in the early colonisation of North America, particularly a group known as the West Country men.|$|E
5|$|Galen Clark was {{appointed}} by the commission as the Grant's first guardian, but neither Clark nor the commissioners {{had the authority to}} evict homesteaders (which included Hutchings). The issue was not settled until 1872 when the homesteader land holdings were invalidated by the U.S. Supreme Court. Clark and the reigning commissioners were ousted in 1880, this dispute also reaching the Supreme Court in 1880. The two Supreme Court decisions affecting management of the Yosemite Grant are considered important <b>precedents</b> in land management law. Hutchings became the new park guardian.|$|E

40|$|<b>Precedent</b> is the {{cornerstone}} of common law method. It is the core mechanism by which the common law reaches just outcomes. Through creation and application of <b>precedent,</b> common law seeks to produce justice. The appellate courts 2 ̆ 7 practice of issuing unpublished, non-precedential opinions has generated considerable discussion about the value of <b>precedent,</b> but that debate has centered on pragmatic and formalistic values. This essay argues that the practice of issuing non-precedential opinions does more than offend constitutional dictates and present pragmatic problems to the appellate system; abandoning <b>precedent</b> undermines justice itself. Issuance of the vast majority of decisions as nonprecedential tears the justice-seeking mechanism of <b>precedent</b> from the heart of our common law system...|$|R
40|$|Common law evolves {{not only}} through the {{outcomes}} of cases but also through the reasoning and citations to <b>precedent</b> employed in judicial opinions.

We find that the majority-opinion writer relies more heavily on <b>precedent</b> when the Court’s decision is accompanied by separate opinions. We also show that diversity of opinion on the Court, a factor often overlooked, has a significant relationship with citations to <b>precedent.</b> Finally, our {{results indicate that the}} ideology of the median justice influences citation practices more than ideology of the majority-opinion writer. 1...|$|R
