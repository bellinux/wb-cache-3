For instance, to increase access to grocery stores in underserved areas, the Bloomberg administration developed a program called FRESH that offers zoning and financial incentives to developers, grocery store operators and land owners. His administration also created a Healthy Bodega initiative, which provides healthful food samples and <b>promotional</b> <b>support</b> to grocers in lower-income areas {{to encourage them to}} carry one-percent milk and fruits and vegetables. Under Bloomberg's leadership, the city passed a Green Carts bill, which supports mobile produce vendors in lower-income areas; expanded farmers' markets using the city's Health Bucks program which provides coupons to eligible individuals to buy produce at farmers' markets in lower-income areas; and committed $111 million in capital funding for playground improvements. New York also {{was one of the first}} cities in the nation to help patrons make more informed decisions about their food choices by requiring fast-food and chain restaurants to label their menus with calorie information.|$|E

500|$|The {{following}} week, [...] "Harlem Shake" [...] debuted {{at number}} one on the US Billboard Hot 100 and climbed to {{number one on}} the Dance/Electronic Songs, while selling 262,000 units. It was the first instrumental track to top the Hot 100 since Jan Hammer's 1985 Miami Vice theme. It was also the twenty-first song in the Hot 100's history to debut at number one and was aided by 103 million weekly video streams, which was announced that week by Billboard and Nielsen SoundScan as a new component of their charts. According to Billboards editorial director Bill Werde, [...] "Harlem Shake"'s success prompted them to enact the chart policy after two years of discussions with YouTube. However, Silvio Pietroluongo, the magazine's director of charts, said in an interview for The A.V. Club that their timing was coincidental and came after a period of negotiating the chart policy and its logistics. However, because it lacked major label <b>promotional</b> <b>support,</b> the single registered low in airplay.

500|$|A {{third and}} final album was again helmed by David Kahne, which Allmusic writer Stewart Mason speculated was a [...] "reaction against the more {{commercial}} sound of Benefactor. By this time, Carter {{had been replaced by}} veteran session drummer Aaron Smith. Instincts was released in October 1984, debuted at No.68 on the Billboard 200, and proved to be the band's best-selling album. It also launched their most successful single, [...] "A Girl in Trouble (Is a Temporary Thing)," [...] which broke the Billboard Top 40 and peaked at No.35. Critical reactions were positive. Despite being the band's most successful effort to date, Columbia pulled the band's <b>promotional</b> <b>support</b> while on a nationwide tour. [...] "The very next town we got to after they made that decision, there wasn't an A person there," [...] said Iyall. [...] " [...] was no local person there, there were no interviews and in-stores arranged as they had been. All that just ground to a halt." [...] Iyall also revealed during that tour that she had signed with her own manager, David Rubinson, and would be leaving the band {{at the end of the}} tour. The band stayed together for a European tour at the beginning of 1985 and upon returning to San Francisco, Iyall quit the band to pursue a solo career. Constant touring has been cited by Iyall as the primary reason for the break-up. [...] "You get tired of each other, and you get intolerant of being uncomfortable and away from your family and your friends." [...] According to a VH1 reunion episode, the issue of Iyall's weight was the reason for the label dropping them. In 2003, Iyall agreed with this claim: [...] "Howie sold us from 415 to Columbia Records, and they were like 'Who's this fat chick?' They decided that was as far as it was going to get, and pulled their support." [...] Crawdaddy! writer Denise Sullivan stated that the label spoke to Iyall about losing weight, but she subsequently refused. In 2010, Iyall declined to discuss the issue, but added that she may not be taking full responsibility in the matter.|$|E

2500|$|Swervedriver's third album, Ejector Seat Reservation, was {{recorded}} primarily at Church Studios and Konk Studios in Crouch End, North London and again {{produced by the}} band and Alan Moulder. Aside from themes of fatalism and flight working their way into its composition, [...] "for some reason we were wanting to reverse the notion of being the band with the American references in our songs and so some very British reference points appeared in the lyrics," [...] explained Franklin. The band had a dispute with McGee over picking the album's launching single—they thought [...] "The Other Jesus" [...] was the obvious choice but McGee overrode them, selecting [...] "Last Day on Earth" [...] {{in an attempt to}} capitalize on the current trend perpetuated by Britpop bands like Oasis of featuring strings and acoustic guitars. Initial promo pressings of the record including the additional track [...] "It's All Happening Now" [...] had to be withdrawn after permission to use lyrics lifted from Bob Dylan's [...] "It's All Over Now, Baby Blue" [...] was denied. (They would later be given away to fan club members.) These incidents would prove to be just a precursor to the group's album woes, however. Realizing a vanishing return on their investment, American label A cut the band's funding, telling them the album would not fit into their release schedule for another year and a half. In response, the group requested to be released from their contract. With its loss of the band's licensing to A (approximately $350,000 per album), an already financially troubled Creation released Ejector Seat Reservation domestically on 15 July 1995 but dropped the band a week later. Subsequently, it received no <b>promotional</b> <b>support</b> (aside from a few small ads) and would remain unreleased in North America.|$|E
