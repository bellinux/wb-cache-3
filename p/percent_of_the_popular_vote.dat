In Congress, he worked for expansion of the money supply and {{for the opening of}} Indian Territory to white settlement. As the Greenback Party fell apart, a new anti-big business third party, the People's Party ("Populists"), arose. Weaver helped to organize the party and was their nominee {{for president in}} 1892. This time he was more successful and gained 8.5 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>popular</b> <b>vote</b> and won five states, but still fell far short of victory. The Populists merged with the Democrats {{by the end of the}} 19th century, and Weaver went with them, promoting the candidacy of William Jennings Bryan for president in 1896, 1900, and 1908. After serving as mayor of his home town, Colfax, Iowa, Weaver retired from his pursuit of elective office. He died in Iowa in 1912. Most of Weaver's political goals remained unfulfilled at his death, but many came to pass in the following decades.|$|E

Despite an aggressive use of campaign infomercials on prime time network television, his polling numbers never fully recovered from his initial exit.

Grant won 56 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>popular</b> <b>vote</b> and an Electoral College landslide of 286 to 66. A majority of African Americans in the South voted for Grant, while Democratic opposition remained mostly peaceful. Grant lost in six former slave states that wanted to see an end to Reconstruction.
