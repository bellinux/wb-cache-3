5|$|The Lombard {{migration}} {{started on}} Easter Monday, April 2, 568.

The conversion is likely to have been motivated mostly from political considerations, and intended to consolidate the migration's cohesion, distinguishing them from the Catholic Romans. It also connected Alboin and his <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Gothic heritage, and in this way obtain the support of the Ostrogoths serving in the Byzantine army as foederati.
