2500|$|In general, {{indirect}} costs such as premature mortality due to alcohol dependence, loss of productivity due to absenteeism and <b>presenteeism,</b> {{and cost of}} property damage and enforcement, far exceed the direct health care and law enforcement costs. Aggregating the economic cost from all sources, the impact can range from 0.45% - 5.44% of a country's gross domestic product (GDP). [...] The wide range is due to inconsistency in measurement of economic burden, as researchers in some studies attributed possible positive effects from long term alcohol consumption.|$|E
50|$|Exhaustion {{and future}} poor health are often other {{consequences}} of <b>presenteeism.</b> For example, Bergstrom, Bodin, Hagberg, Aronsson, and Josephson found that sickness <b>presenteeism</b> {{was a risk}} factor for future sick leave. Furthermore, in their study of job demands and <b>presenteeism,</b> Demerouti et al. found that <b>presenteeism</b> resulted in increased exhaustion.|$|E
5000|$|While {{progress}} has been made in regards to understanding <b>presenteeism,</b> many possible topics of inquiry still remain. In his literature review, Johns said that <b>presenteeism</b> had to be related to other constructs such as work attitudes and personality. Additionally, lessons from absenteeism could be applied to <b>presenteeism.</b> For instance, absenteeism can be defined as voluntary and involuntary, and scholars could consider applying such ideas to <b>presenteeism.</b> Lastly, the construct could be related to other elements of the work. Specifically, how does <b>presenteeism</b> relate to telework? Is an individual who works from home while he or she is sick exhibiting <b>presenteeism?</b> ...|$|E
5000|$|In some cases, {{scholars}} relate <b>presenteeism</b> to absenteeism, {{which is}} the tendency not {{to show up for}} scheduled work. Furthermore, Johns described the notion that some believe that factors that reduce absenteeism will increase <b>presenteeism.</b> He stated, however, that this is plausible but not always the case because he pointed out that Aronsson et al. found high rates of <b>presenteeism</b> in industries where absenteeism was also high. [...] Additionally, research that examines absenteeism is at times used to draw conclusions about <b>presenteeism.</b> For example, Virtanen, Kivimaki, Elovainio, Vahtera, and Ferrie found that employees exhibited much higher rates of absenteeism once they became permanent workers. The authors thought that this increase could have been due to decreases in the preexisting levels of <b>presenteeism.</b> However, they did not directly measure <b>presenteeism.</b> Commenting on such research behavior, Johns said in his review of the literature that researchers should not infer <b>presenteeism</b> from absenteeism data. Instead, the author noted that both constructs should be measured at the same time.|$|E
50|$|Certain occupations such as {{welfare and}} {{teaching}} {{are more prone}} to <b>presenteeism.</b> Doctors may attend work while sick due to feelings of being irreplaceable. Jobs with large workloads are associated with <b>presenteeism.</b> People whose self-esteem is based on performance, as well as workaholics, typically have high levels of <b>presenteeism.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Scholars {{have often}} {{measured}} <b>presenteeism</b> {{in terms of}} how often an individual attends work while unhealthy. For instance, Aronsson et al. asked participants to what extent over the past year they had gone to work despite feeling they should have taken sick leave. Respondents could choose from never, once, between two and 5 times, and more than 5 times. Other researchers have examined the frequency of <b>presenteeism</b> by asking participants a similar question. The responses, however, were on a scale of [...] "spells of one day <b>presenteeism,</b> spells of 2-4 day <b>presenteeism,</b> and spells of 5 day or more presenteeism." ...|$|E
5000|$|Individuals {{working in}} certain occupations {{may be more}} prone to <b>presenteeism.</b> In a study in Sweden, Aronsson et al. found that those {{offering}} welfare and teaching services demonstrated higher rates of <b>presenteeism.</b> The authors pointed out that these employees often worked with those in more vulnerable populations such as the elderly. Outside of education and healthcare, most of the occupations had lower rates of presenteeism; however, the results did suggest that higher risks jobs, which had more physical workload and stress, saw increased levels of <b>presenteeism.</b> Certain work environments may stimulate <b>presenteeism.</b> To explore this topic, Dew, Keefe, and Small qualitatively examined a private hospital, a large public hospital, and a small factory. In the private hospital, there was little pressure from management to exhibit presenteeism; however, a sense of family seemed to exist between the staff, and a strong loyalty to coworkers pushed employees {{to come to work}} while unhealthy. The public hospital had a distant management, but <b>presenteeism</b> was fostered by [...] "loyalty to professional image, colleagues, and the institution as a whole." [...] Finally, in the factory, there was strong pressure from management for employees to exhibit <b>presenteeism.</b> Furthermore, workers often had few other employment options, which often resulted in increased <b>presenteeism.</b>|$|E
5000|$|<b>Presenteeism</b> {{or working}} while sick can cause {{productivity}} loss, poor health, exhaustion and workplace epidemics. While the contrasting subject of absenteeism has historically received extensive {{attention in the}} management sciences, <b>presenteeism</b> has only recently been studied.|$|E
50|$|Certain health factors {{serve as}} {{risk factors for}} <b>presenteeism</b> as opposed to absenteeism. Boles, Pelletier, and Lynch {{examined}} a variety of emotional and physical health symptoms and noted that the odds of reporting <b>presenteeism</b> were largest for those with high stress compared to those without stress. Those with poor diet and less emotional fulfillment also {{reported higher levels of}} <b>presenteeism</b> than those without these conditions. The researchers noted that individuals with diabetes tended to report higher levels of absenteeism as opposed to those without the condition. Individuals who partook in no physical activity were more prone to report higher levels of both absenteeism and <b>presenteeism</b> compared to those who took part in some physical activity.|$|E
50|$|Performance-based {{self-esteem}} (PBSE) {{has also}} been considered another antecedent of <b>presenteeism.</b> This term describes the idea that individuals’ self-esteem may depend on their performance. Employees who demonstrate high levels of this construct have to prove their worth while on the job. Love et al. found that PBSE positively predicted presenteeism; however, the authors also discovered {{that the relationship between}} PBSE and <b>presenteeism</b> was strengthened when workers experienced high physical and psychological work demands. This finding suggested that demanding work environments could interact with employees’ overambitious work styles, which could result in over performance and increased levels of <b>presenteeism.</b>|$|E
5000|$|... #Subtitle level 2: Measurement of <b>presenteeism</b> and {{its impact}} on {{productivity}} ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Presenteeism</b> {{may have}} many motives. An {{employee}} {{may come to}} work because they simply need the money and cannot afford {{to take time off}} due to illness. Additionally, one could go to work due to a love and devotion to the job. In this case, <b>presenteeism</b> could be considered an act of organizational citizenship and inspire admiration from colleagues.|$|E
50|$|Those who exhibit workaholism tend to {{demonstrate}} {{higher levels of}} <b>presenteeism.</b> As defined by Schaufeli, Bakker, van der Heijden, and Prins, workaholics tend to work excessively and compulsively, and they are internally motivated to work to an excessive extent. In addition to their high levels of <b>presenteeism,</b> Schaufeli et al. discovered that workaholics also displayed the highest burnout and lowest happiness levels relative to other groups who were not defined as workaholics.|$|E
50|$|The {{burden of}} chronic NCDs {{including}} mental health conditions is felt in workplaces around the world, notably due to {{elevated levels of}} absenteeism, or absence from work because of illness, and <b>presenteeism,</b> or productivity lost from staff coming to work and performing below normal standards due to poor health. For example, the United Kingdom experienced a loss of about 175 million days in 2006 to absence from illness among a working population of 37.7 million people. The estimated cost of absences due to illness was over 20 billion pounds in the same year. The cost due to <b>presenteeism</b> is likely even larger, although methods of analyzing the economic impacts of <b>presenteeism</b> are still being developed. Methods for analyzing the distinct workplace impacts of NCDs versus other types of health conditions are also still being developed.|$|E
50|$|Jobs {{that have}} large workloads and many demands are often {{associated}} {{with higher levels of}} <b>presenteeism.</b> Caverely, Cunningham, and Macgregor studied Canadian firms and noted that <b>presenteeism</b> was often not the result of job insecurity. Instead individuals felt they had to come to work while ill or injured because they believed they had high workloads, many deadlines, and often very little backup support. Complementing this finding, McKevitt et al. also found that individuals feared their work would pile up if they did not go to their job. Moreover, Demerouti, Le Blanc, Bakker, Schaufeli, and Hox examined job demands and found that they had a positive relationship with <b>presenteeism.</b> In the case of this study, the authors defined job demands as aspects of the job that require physical and/or psychological effort.|$|E
5000|$|Scholars have {{provided}} various other {{descriptions of the}} concept. For instance, Simpson claimed that <b>presenteeism</b> is [...] "the tendency to stay at work beyond the time needed for effective performance on the job." [...] Aronsson, Gustafsson, and Dallner wrote that it means attending work even when one feels unhealthy. In a recent review of the literature, Johns highlighted the lack of agreement between the many definitions. The author claimed {{that many of the}} definitions lack utility and that the term is most often defined as going to work while ill. He further noted that definitions of <b>presenteeism,</b> which are centered on attending work while sick, have received more evidence of construct validity. In other words, when defined as coming to work while sick, <b>presenteeism</b> seems to relate more to logical outcome variables and correlates.|$|E
50|$|Simply viewing <b>presenteeism</b> as a {{negative}} act that leads to productivity loss and decreased health may be restricting potential analysis of the construct.|$|E
50|$|The 2014 American College of Occupational and Environment Medicine survey, Employment Status Matters: A Statewide Survey of Quality-of-Life, Prevention Behaviors, and Absenteeism and <b>Presenteeism,</b> {{included}} {{findings from}} the 2010 and 2012 studies.|$|E
5000|$|Management of {{employees}} by observing {{that they are}} present at the physical work place during accepted working hours and appear to be doing expected work tasks. Without objective setting may lead to <b>presenteeism.</b>|$|E
50|$|One {{consequence}} of <b>presenteeism</b> is productivity loss, and scholars {{have attempted to}} estimate these productivity numbers. While examining productivity decrements, however, it is implied that losses are measured relative to not having a particular sickness or health issue. Furthermore, in comparison to being absent from a job, those exhibiting <b>presenteeism</b> may be far more productive. Nonetheless, a large study by Goetzel et al. estimated that on average in the United States, an employee’s <b>presenteeism</b> costs or lost on-the-job productivity are approximately $255. Furthermore, the authors concluded {{that of all the}} health related costs faced by employers, one fifth to three fifths of those expenses could be attributable to on-the-job productivity losses. Complementing that study, Schultz and Edington provided a detailed review of the effects of certain health conditions on productivity. These authors examined conditions such as allergies, arthritis, chronic pain, diabetes, and mental health disorders. The studies in the review showed, for example, that increases in pollen are associated with decreased performance. Moreover, Schultz and Edington noted that chronic pain had to be studied more thoroughly to better understand its effects on productivity.|$|E
50|$|Codral's slogan Soldier On is an {{enduring}} feature of its advertisements, {{but as the}} medication allows cold sufferers to mask their symptoms, {{it is also associated}} with <b>presenteeism,</b> in the sense of showing up to work with a contagious illness, instead of taking sick leave.|$|E
5000|$|... 1. Variety in duties {{performed}} - A lack in variability {{can lead}} to <b>presenteeism,</b> in which the employee physically goes to work, but becomes unproductive or discontent due to boredom with repetitive work activities. If the tasks at work are varied, satisfaction comes more easily.|$|E
50|$|<b>Presenteeism</b> {{can also}} {{have an effect on}} {{occupational}} injuries for workers. A 2012 study from the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health showed that workers with access to paid sick leave were 28% less likely overall to suffer nonfatal injuries than workers without access to paid sick leave.|$|E
50|$|Temporary and {{permanent}} employment are often considered when examining the antecedents of <b>presenteeism.</b> More specifically, researchers have studied these positions {{with the thought}} that lack of job security will cause those who do not have permanent positions to come to work more often even if they are sick. This hypothesis, however, has not received complete support. Aronsson et al. discovered that permanent employees were more prone to <b>presenteeism</b> than those in more seasonal positions. In contrast, Aronsson and Gustafson found no effect of job type.Furthermore, Heponiemi et al. found that fixed-term employees as opposed to permanent employees were less likely to report working while ill, and the work of Bockerman and Laukkanen supported this finding. Based on these inconclusive results, Johns noted that researchers had to reconsider the job insecurity hypothesis.|$|E
50|$|Given the {{prominence}} {{and costs of}} <b>presenteeism,</b> scholars have suggested a variety of courses of action for employers. Companies should implement wellness programs for their employees aimed at increasing health and productivity. These organizations, however, must {{be aware that the}} effects of these programs may have an immediate impact on <b>presenteeism</b> as opposed to simply absenteeism. Firms must be cognizant of this fact when evaluating the effectiveness of their programs. Complimenting this suggestion, Schultz and Edington wrote that employees must be educated effectively so they can better manage their health. They also commented that employers need to consider the health of workers who are low risk along with those who have high-risk health conditions. In the United States, one other proposed response has been to require that paid sick and family leave be provided to all workers. In November 2006, San Francisco became the first jurisdiction to pass such a law.|$|E
50|$|The {{ease with}} which one can be {{replaced}} on the job also affects levels of <b>presenteeism.</b> Specifically, if one feels {{that he or she}} cannot be replaced, that individual is more prone to attend work while sick. Doctors are often examined in this regard. For example, Jena et al. studied residents in training and noted high rates of <b>presenteeism,</b> which they concluded were the result of feeling irreplaceable. Further extending the examination of the medical field, McKevitt, Morgan, Dundas, and Holland studied hundreds of healthcare professionals and found that more than 80 percent of respondents had worked while ill. Individuals listed some of the reasons they had not taken sick days, and many cited the fact that they felt large pressure to work. In some cases, general practitioners did not want to burden their partners, and many felt a strong commitment to the job that prevented them from taking sick leave.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the case}} of an {{infectious}} disease such as influenza a culture of <b>presenteeism</b> will inevitably also lead to further infections throughout the workforce compounding the ill-effects and leading to a much wider problem. In a 2014 survey by Canada Life Insurance over 80% of respondents stated that they had become ill {{as a result of an}} infection contracted in the workplace ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Presenteeism</b> {{costs the}} U.S. economy $180 billion {{annually}} in lost productivity. For employers, this costs {{an average of}} $255 per employee per year and exceeds the cost of absenteeism and medical and disability benefits. For workers in the foodservice industry, one analysis found that foodborne illness outbreak for a chain restaurant - including negative public opinion, which affects other operations in a metropolitan area - can be up to $7 million.|$|E
50|$|Aside from {{measuring}} {{the frequency of}} <b>presenteeism,</b> scholars often look to measure the effects of poor health on job productivity. The Work Limitations Questionnaire (WLQ) {{is often used to}} perform this task. With 25 items, it examines the extent to which respondents can handle time, physical, mental-interpersonal, and output demands. Additionally, The Stanford <b>Presenteeism</b> Scale seeks {{to determine the effects of}} health on productivity. It measures participants’ abilities to concentrate and perform work despite having a primary health problem. Using six items, respondents determine the extent to which they agree with statements that describe how their health condition may or may not affect their work. The scale measures two factors that the authors labeled as completing work and avoiding distraction. Finally, another measure often used is the World Health Organization Health and Work Performance Questionnaire (HPQ). This self-report measure acquires information about respondents’ health conditions and has them provide perceptions of their job performance. The WLQ and HPQ have become the two most popular instruments; however, one can access more thorough reviews of instruments that have been created to estimate the effects of health on productivity.|$|E
50|$|A perfect {{attendance}} {{award is}} traditionally given in U.S. schools {{as a way}} to honor students who have neither missed any days of nor been late to class. Supporters believe that the award promotes education by encouraging students to attend class whenever it is in session. However, some believe that offering a perfect attendance award promotes <b>presenteeism</b> and hurts public health by causing students to attend class when sick with a potentially contagious illness, while punishing those who make the decision to stay home to recover.|$|E
5000|$|The {{increase}} in popularity of ROWE strategy {{can be seen}} in the number of companies implementing it. Recently, companies and agencies like GAP Inc., Yum! Brands, SpinWeb, Dixie iron Works, Girl Scouts of San Gorgonio Council, Minnesota Department of Transportation and American Society of Clinical Oncology have been experimenting with ROWE. Additionally, Sweden has recently brought up the 6-hour a day work strategy in hope of increasing employee productivity. Experts suggest that this is a great step towards ROWE and also helps curb the consequences of <b>Presenteeism.</b>|$|E
50|$|According to Healthy Workforce 2010 and Beyond, a {{joint effort}} of the US Partnership for Prevention and the US Chamber of Commerce, {{organizations}} need to view employee health in terms of productivity {{rather than as an}} exercise in health care cost management. The emerging discipline of Health and Productivity Management (HPM) has shown that health and productivity are “inextricably linked” and that a healthy workforce leads to a healthy bottom line. There is now strong evidence that health status can impair day-to-day work performance (e.g., <b>presenteeism)</b> and {{have a negative effect on}} job output and quality. Current recommendations for employers are not only to help its unhealthy population become healthy but also to keep its healthy population from becoming sick. Employers are encouraged to implement population-based programs including health risk appraisals and health screenings in conjunctionwith targeted interventions.|$|E
50|$|The {{positive}} impact of workplace health promotion programs on productivity is widely discussed. The impact of workplace health promotion on absenteeism is substantial since productivity is impossible if an employee is absent. However, {{the effects of}} <b>presenteeism</b> are also significant, and working while sick is estimated to cost the United States economy more than $150 billion per year. Absenteeism is estimated to cost the average employer $660 annually per employee. Based on productivity costs, employees experiencing negative health conditions or at risk of developing impaired health cost employers up to $1601 more than healthy employees per year. Improvements in productivity and absenteeism following implementation of workplace health promotion programs can annually save employers $15.6 for every one dollar spent on health initiatives. More generally, employee health care costs and absentee day costs decrease by $3.27 and $2.73, respectively, for every dollar spent on workplace health promotion. In some cases, employer-based health programs {{have been shown to}} yield no reduction in health care spending or employer insurance outlay.|$|E
5000|$|The {{underlying}} {{premise of}} disease management {{is that when}} the right tools, ...experts, and equipment are applied to a population, labor costs (specifically: absenteeism, <b>presenteeism,</b> and direct insurance expenses) can be minimized in the near term, or resources can be provided more efficiently. The general idea is to ease the disease path, rather than cure the disease. Improving quality and activities for daily living are first and foremost. Improving cost, in some programs, is a necessary component, as well. However, some disease management systems believe that reductions in longer term problems may not be measureable today, but may warrant continuation of disease management programs until better data is available in 10-20 years. Most disease management vendors offer return on investment (ROI) for their programs, although over the years there have been dozens of ways to measure ROI. Responding to this inconsistency, an industry trade association, the Care Continuum Alliance, convened industry leaders to develop consensus guidelines for measuring clinical and financial outcomes in disease management, wellness and other population-based programs. Contributing to the work were public and private health and quality organizations, including the federal Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, the National Committee for Quality Assurance, URAC, and the Joint Commission. The project produced the first volume of a now four-volume Outcomes Guidelines Report, which details industry-consensus approaches to measuring outcomes.|$|E

Systematic search methods were applied to identify self-report instruments used to quantify <b>presenteeism</b> caused by MSD. A total of 24 self-reported <b>presenteeism</b> instruments were identified; 24 were designed for use in general health, and 1 was specifically designed for use in rheumatoid arthritis. One generic self-reported <b>presenteeism</b> instrument was explicitly reported to be underpinned by economic theory. Overtime, self-reported <b>presenteeism</b> instruments have become more differentiated and complex by incorporating many different contextual factors that may impact levels of <b>presenteeism.</b> Researchers are encouraged to further develop <b>presenteeism</b> instruments that are underpinned by relevant economic theory and informed by robust empirical research...|$|E
40|$|Although work {{factors have}} been {{associated}} with both <b>presenteeism</b> and exhaustion among hospital physicians, we lack knowledge on the dynamic relationship between demands in the work context and <b>presenteeism</b> and how this can be mediated by symptoms of exhaustion when controlling for job resources.

A cross-sectional survey of 545 university hospital physicians in Norway was conducted. Variables included in the model were <b>presenteeism,</b> exhaustion, work-family conflict, role conflict, social support and control over work pace. Findings from structural equation modeling indicated that exhaustion mediates the relationship between job demands and <b>presenteeism.</b> Job resources had no direct effect on <b>presenteeism</b> in the hypothesized model. The variables in the study explained 17 % of the variance in <b>presenteeism.</b> The study is one of the first to demonstrate that the relationship between job demands and <b>presenteeism</b> is mediated by exhaustion when controlling for job resources.
