Tests of price asymmetric long-run demand models produce ambiguous results. The pooled time series estimations find near unitary output elasticities, and reject linear demand models in favor of constant elasticity formulations. Despite large differences in product prices and crude prices, the data cannot reject use of a crude price model fir aggregate oil demand. A reduced-form model symmetric in product prices but with technology trends for non-price oil conservation compares favorably with other formulations, and provides slightly lower projections of future oil demand intensity. However, even these lower econometric projections imply substantial increases in aggregate oil demand, increases which exceed {{those found in the}} conventional judgmental estimates. ...|$|R

40|$|In 2004, Andy Paparozzi of the National Association of Printing Leadership (NAPL) {{reported}} {{that it was a}} good year for the U. S. printing industry, because it was the first year since 2001 in which the industry showed growth. However, this good news cannot appease the complaints from U. <b>S.</b> <b>printers</b> who are concerned about losing their jobs to overseas printers. According to a survey conducted by the Printing Industries of America/Graphic Arts Technical Foundation (PIA/GATF), 40 % of printers think that their customers are seeking global sourcing for their printing needs. Offshoring is the new reality of globalization. Journalists constantly mention the benefits and dangers in offshoring. No one is really sure if offshoring is beneficial or not, or if it is just overwhelming the printing industry. For the following thesis, the researcher conducted two surveys. One targeted U. S. print buyers (buyers, brokers, and book publishers); the other survey targeted Chinese printers. This research discusses the following issues: • How do Chinese <b>printers</b> view U. <b>S.</b> offshore print buying trends? • How are Chinese printers planning to upgrade and to improve their capabilities to acquire and to handle offshore print jobs? • Is there a trend (an increase or a decrease) in offshore print buying from China? • How do U. S. print buyers evaluate the need to send print jobs to China? • What are the obstacles that prevent U. S. print buyers from buying print from China? The research findings will benefit the U. <b>S.</b> <b>printers</b> by clarifying our understanding the print buyer’s behavior and reasons for purchasing their print offshore. With more accurate knowledge in this field, U. <b>S.</b> <b>printers</b> will be in a better position to know what it will take to become more competitive...|$|R

40|$|Brentano in 1870 s was {{the first}} to {{introduce}} intentionality to mean “conscious of”. At the end of the 1960 s, a version of this view was developed by analytic American philosophy to construct a theory of meaningful language. That led Dennett to claim that intentionality was mainly a feature of sentence, not mental states. In contrast, Searle in 1990 <b>s</b> <b>rejected</b> the Brentanian thesis and ex-plained intentionality by a biological naturalism. Thereafter, radical eliminativists such as Church-land claimed that all philosophical arguments merited replacement by neuroscientific knowledge. Unfortunately, very few neurophysiological studies attempted to scientifically tackle the problem raised by intentionality. The issue now emerging is a new conception of intentionality based on phenomenological, neurobiological and quantum theories, such as: 1) the notion of “intentional arc ” proposed in the philosophy of Merleau-Ponty; 2) the neurobiological and quantum model of Freeman, in which self-organizing pathways are accompanied by quantum transitions in control-ling intentionality in brain; 3) the recent hypothesis that some visuo-motor neurons would be in-volved in controlling these self-organized pathways; 4) the quantum models of Vitiello and Globus, in which a thermofield (dissipative) system governs the dynamic dialog of dual quantum mode...|$|R
40|$|American {{public law}} has {{traditionally}} been understood as an insider 2 ̆ 7 s game. Within this understanding, law is following the rules laid down, particularly those laid down by the United States Supreme Court. Rigorous legal analysis treats Supreme Court opinions as self-contained exercises to be understood or criticized from the inside - {{from the point of}} view of the Supreme Court Justices who write them. Thus, a turn-of-the-century formalist would try to situate a decision in the larger geometric unity of law, or might fault a decision for being inconsistent with precedent. Although the realists of the 1920 <b>s</b> <b>rejected</b> this sort of analysis and more aggressively criticized the Court, they too read the cases through the eyes of the Court - albeit a Court following a political or personal agenda. The legal process school of the 1950 s was realist in understanding law as policy and formalist in evaluating the Court through criteria such as reasoned elaboration, deference, and coherence with neutral or authoritative principles. But like the formalists and the realists before them, legal process thinkers were insiders, viewing law from the perspective of the New Deal Presidency and Court...|$|R
