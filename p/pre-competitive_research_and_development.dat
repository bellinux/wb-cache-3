40|$|This paper {{describes}} the work currently being {{undertaken by the}} University of Essex {{as part of the}} ACTS OPEN Project. ACTS (Advanced Communications Technologies and Services) is the European Commission's major programme for supporting <b>pre-competitive</b> <b>research</b> <b>and</b> technological <b>development</b> in telecommunications <b>and</b> associated services. The paper is logically divided into two major sections. The first introduces the OPEN (Optical Pan-European Network) project and defines its requirements, while the second deals with network performance parameters and objectives. The paper starts by giving a background for Project OPEN and then explaining the OPEN concept and principles behind transport networks. It then proceeds to highlight the major performance and behavioural characteristics required from such a network. The three architecture classes being considered in OPEN are outlined. A section on hierarchical networks, including a short literature survey on the subject concludes the first portion of the paper. Next, performance parameters and objectives are discussed. The paper then {{describes the}} performance parameters identified so far in OPEN. It briefly introduces the network modelling tool being developed at the University of Essex, and concludes with some comments on future plans. The aim of the OPEN project is to design a transparent transport service for Europe, supported by two representative field trials (involving three or four nodes each). Initial network design is based on the main work of an earlier project, COST 239 [1], and has identified nineteen cities across Europe (see Figure 1) {{to be included in the}} network design. Each of these nodes acts as a gateway for all the European international traffic for their country. ...|$|R

40|$|In recent years, an {{increasing}} political interest has developed in long-term strategic partnerships for science-industry collaboration in <b>pre-competitive</b> <b>research</b> <b>and</b> <b>development,</b> {{driven by a}} perception of a distinct "blind spot" in many innovation systems.

Nonetheless, the lessons to be learned from them are not by definition idiosyncratic. Against this background, this paper synthesises experiences from different countries and derives generalisable conclusion with regard to the both the nature of the phenomenon and opportunities for future policy actions to promote its development. In short, it finds that viable initiatives tend to be stakeholder driven and policy programmes have to reflect this in selecting competitively, raise clear expectations and endow individual initiatives with strategic capacity...|$|E

In this case, <b>research</b> <b>and</b> <b>development</b> has become a major need that can give alternative in solution of local development. The role of <b>research</b> <b>and</b> <b>development</b> is demandding quality {{that can be used in}} the procces of preparing the planning of local development programs. In the context of increasing the quality of <b>research</b> <b>and</b> <b>development</b> that is done by Bappeda, there are a very complex handicap must be faced. Some problem that must be overcome quickly is a relatively lower quality of the personnal on <b>research</b> <b>and</b> <b>development,</b> the policy of <b>research</b> <b>and</b> <b>development</b> do not refer to five agenda of development at Central Java Provice, lack of authorithy and competence in implementing the function of <b>research</b> <b>and</b> <b>development</b> <b>and</b> also limitation in facility of <b>research</b> <b>and</b> <b>development</b> net sistem that is still by sector. Problems of <b>research</b> <b>and</b> <b>development</b> that is faced by Bappeda need a structuraly and functionaly handling steps through the strategy planning on increasing quality of the <b>research</b> <b>and</b> <b>development.</b> Aims <b>and</b> advantages of this strategy, are emphazised on increasing and developing internal factor of <b>research</b> <b>and</b> <b>development</b> by using external factors thatcan encourage the improvement on <b>research</b> <b>and</b> <b>development</b> quality. It is hoped that the planning of strategy will be one of foundation of policy in increasing <b>research</b> <b>and</b> <b>development</b> quality at Bappeda in the future. In order to analyse strategi planning on increasing reasearch <b>and</b> <b>development</b> quality, it is used SWOT qualitative analisys method. By using Matrix Internal-External mode.
