40|$|This article explores Justice Scalia 2 ̆ 7 s {{views of}} {{judicial}} review of administrative action, as revealed in his writings on public land law, as both a scholar and a Supreme Court justice. It examines and explains why Professor Scalia favored judicial review of public land administration while Justice Scalia seems to abhor it. In a sweeping law review article published in 1970, Professor Scalia argued that the doctrine of sovereign immunity historically did not apply in public lands cases. On the Court he has penned {{two of the most}} significant decisions addressing judicial review of <b>public</b> <b>lands</b> <b>administration,</b> each of them imposing new restrictions (or reviving old ones) on the availability of judicial redress for executive unlawfulness. In Lujan v. National Wildlife Federation (“Lujan I“), Justice Scalia used the law of standing, injected with separation of powers principles, to foreclose programmatic judicial review of public land classification. And last year, in Norton v. Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance (“SUWA“), he used traditional mandamus principles to foreclose judicial review of officials 2 ̆ 7 alleged failure to achieve a plain congressional mandate to maintain the wilderness quality of public lands. Justice Scalia 2 ̆ 7 s imprint on public land law was foretold by his scholarly writings, including his public lands article, which place great emphasis on protecting executive discretion. He favors judicial review for the vindication of traditional private rights while disfavoring it as a means of ensuring the implementation of statutory, public values {{in the face of the}} contrary exercise of executive discretion...|$|E
40|$|In this article, I {{would like}} to {{accomplish}} two goals. First, I {{would like to}} retrace briefly the historical background of the Property Clause, and what led to my conclusions about it. Then, I would {{like to look at}} what implications my arguments have for <b>public</b> <b>lands</b> <b>administration</b> and for future scholarship. Two implications occur to me immediately in considering the governance of public property. First, I claim that congressional power under the Property Clause is very broad. What implications does this have for the management of public lands, and specifically, public property in light of the events of September 11, 2001 and the war on terrorism? Could new restrictive legislation flow from my earlier views? Second, the power granted in the Property Clause is a power granted to Congress, not to the President. Nevertheless, the Executive Branch obviously plays a great role in setting land management policies for federally owned property. Can troubling problems stem from this arrangement and the potential for the Executive Branch to overreach? Finally, in a radical twist from these two public policy issues, I would like to examine on the periphery an academic question and propose a scholarly agenda for the academic community. One of the underlying issues that arises in Property Clause cases is the treatment of disadvantaged groups. Interpretations of the Property Clause have hurt-in no particular order-African Americans, Indians, Mormons, and members of old economies, {{and there seems to be}} at least a small correlation between fights over public property and fights for the rights of otherwise disadvantaged groups. I will present the evidence that I have assembled, and I hope that I might inspire others to join me in exploring the nuances of these battles...|$|E

40|$|Access to land {{is deeply}} {{important}} in rural India, where {{the incidence of}} poverty is highly correlated with {{lack of access to}} land. The author provides a framework for assessing alternative approaches to improving access to land by India's rural poor. He considers India's record implementing land reform and identifies an approach that includes incremental reforms in <b>public</b> <b>land</b> <b>administration</b> to reduce transaction costs in land markets (thereby facilitating land transfers) and to increase transparency, making information accessible to the public to ensure that socially excluded groups benefit. Reducing constraints on access to land for the rural poor and socially excluded requires five key issues: restrictions on land-lease markets, the fragmentation of holdings, the widespread failure to translate women's legal rights into practice, poor access to (and encroachment on) the commons, and high transaction costs for land transfers. Among guidelines for policy reform the author suggests: a) Selectively deregulate land-lease (rental) markets, because rental markets may be important in giving the poor access to land. b) Reduce transaction costs in land markets, including both official costs and informal costs (such as bribes to expedite transactions), partly by improving systems for land registration and management of land records. c) Critically reassess <b>land</b> <b>administration</b> agencies and find ways to improve incentive structures, to reduce rent-seeking and base promotions on performance. d) Promote women's independent land rights through policy measures to increase women's bargaining power within the household and in society generally. e) Improve transparency of <b>land</b> <b>administration</b> and <b>public</b> access to information, to reduce rent-seeking by <b>land</b> <b>administration</b> officers and to strengthen poor people's land rights (and knowledge thereof). f) Strengthen institutions in civil society to provide the awareness, monitoring, and pressure needed for successful reform and to provide checks and balances on inappropriate uses of state power. In a companion paper (WPS 2124) the author addresses these issues at the level of a particular state - Orissa, one of India's poorest states - in an empirical study, from a transaction costs perspective, of social exclusion and <b>land</b> <b>administration.</b> Banks&Banking Reform,Environmental Economics&Policies,Land Use and Policies,Municipal Housing and Land,Agricultural Knowledge&Information Systems,Environmental Economics&Policies,Rural Land Policies for Poverty Reduction,Land Use and Policies,Banks&Banking Reform,Forestry...|$|R
40|$|Thesis Summary: <b>Public</b> <b>land</b> {{management}} in the United States is primarily {{a function of the}} United States Federal Government, with roughly ninety-five percent of America's <b>public</b> <b>lands</b> owned by the American people and intensely managed by America's federal government. Within Australia this trend is reversed, with Australia's states administering the vast majority of Australia's non-alienated common lands under noticeably less public, government and judicial scrutiny than occurs in the United States. The focus of this thesis is to explain why the United States developed primarily a national approach to <b>public</b> <b>land</b> management, while Australia's government lands are mainly managed at the state level and to illustrate the aftermath of these differences. Methods: This thesis will concentrate upon critical historical events, including similarities and differences in colonial and post-American Revolution land policies, constitutional provision, modern case law, and notable judicial decisions. Australia's state land policies will be revealed for strictly comparative purposes to demonstrate the importance of America's national <b>land</b> policies to <b>public</b> <b>land</b> conservation. Written and/or phone inquiries were conducted with each of Australia's state/territorial land administrative agencies and the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service. Similar inquiries were conducted with <b>public</b> <b>land</b> <b>administration</b> agencies within the United States, including the National Parks Service, National Forest Service, Bureau of Land Management, and the Arkansas Department of Parks. Historical references were obtained from the Tasmania University Library; Tasmania State Library; Saint Paul [Minnesota], Milwaukee [Wisconsin]. and Boston [Massachusetts] public libraries; as well as the university libraries of Minnesota, Wisconsin, Sydney, and Melbourne. Having traveled extensively throughout Australia as an environmental studies and aboriginal anthropology student at Sydney University in 1985, an extended dedication has been included to demonstrate that Native American and Native Australian civilizations declined because of land polices that encouraged genocide and displaced native people from their ancestral lands. Conclusions: The United States developed a national approach to <b>public</b> <b>land</b> management because of unanimous, early agreement among America's states; early governing land laws that solidified the constitutional, national land powers of the United States Congress; prodevelopment and later pro-conservation land philosophies; and important presidential initiatives in conservation. The aftermath of a national approach resulted in the United States Government securing 'true' national lands, while nationalism and romanticism succeeded in greatly furthering legalized land conservation. These factors may be illustrated by comparing America's national land policies to Australia's largely state administered land policies through differences in <b>public</b> <b>land</b> tenure, historic land policy, land law development, and executive and congressional initative...|$|R

40|$|On December 26, 2004, {{the world}} has {{evidenced}} {{one of the most}} horrible tragedies in history of humankind. <b>Land</b> <b>administration</b> sector was also badly influenced by the catastrophe. The cadastral offices in Province of Nanggroe Aceh Darussalam (NAD) and Nias were severely damaged by the tsunami. Most of cadastral records were lost or destroyed. The ground benchmarks, natural and man-made objects were also destroyed by tsunami and/or clearing out works in the tsunami affected areas. With nothing left on the ground, the <b>land</b> <b>administration</b> processes should be started from the scratch. The Government of Republic of Indonesia (GoI) was quickly responding by publishing five-year master plan of rehabilitation and reconstruction of NAD and Nias, especially on the spatial layout and land affairs. Unfortunately, many have criticised the GoI’s master plan. Besides its macro scale (Kamil, 2005), Fitzpatrick (2005) underlined the relocation camps and coastal buffer zones proposals as promoting disquiet among Acehnese. Many of Acehnese just wanted to go home and resettled their houses in the exactly same location as their previous houses that are swapped by tsunami (Montlake, 2005). NAD is well-know by its uniqueness among other Indonesian provinces since NAD has entirely different cultural background. As most of Indonesian region used to be ruled by Hindu and Buddha kingdom, NAD had only been ruled by several Islamic sultanates in different periods of time. Therefore, NAD has a strong Islamic culture. The implementation of Syariah, Islamic Law, has been strengthening the Islamic background of NAD. Besides its strong Islamic background, Acehneses have also different customary <b>land</b> <b>administration</b> system than other Indonesian provinces. The Acehneses’ customary <b>land</b> <b>administration</b> system is basically originated from the Islamic culture. The Acehneses’ customary <b>land</b> <b>administration</b> system is basically intending to maintain sustainable development and promoting equality for every Acehneses to enjoy the outcome of development. In order to focus on efforts of rehabilitating and reconstructing Banda Aceh, this study only highlights two out of three components of <b>land</b> <b>administration,</b> which are <b>land</b> tenure and land use. Land valuation, which is another component of <b>land</b> <b>administration,</b> is not included within this study due to the collapse of local governmental institution that is in charge in the valuation of land, as well as due to the prohibition of land transfer before the <b>land</b> <b>administration</b> system in Banda Aceh is working properly. In this study of <b>land</b> <b>administration</b> in post-disaster areas in Banda Aceh, the effectiveness of policy of GoI on rehabilitation and reconstruction of <b>land</b> <b>administration</b> in Banda Aceh is being evaluated. The evaluation of policy of GoI on rehabilitation and reconstruction of <b>land</b> <b>administration</b> in Banda Aceh is performed with special references to the Acehneses’ customary <b>land</b> <b>administration</b> system, <b>land</b> <b>administration</b> theories and cases, Indonesian <b>land</b> <b>administration</b> policy and regulation and progress on rehabilitation and reconstruction of <b>land</b> <b>administration</b> in Banda Aceh. During the performance of this research, interviews and literature study were held to gather information on above mentioned special references. Interviews were held in Banda Aceh, Jakarta and Bandung and covered {{the point of view of}} the decision maker, professional and intellectual on <b>land</b> <b>administration</b> field, as well as the aspiration of Acehneses and particularly the citizens of Banda Aceh. On the other hand, the literature study was particularly performed for collecting information on <b>land</b> <b>administration</b> theories and cases in post conflict areas. Moreover, information regarding Indonesian general and special <b>land</b> <b>administration</b> laws, regulations and policies for Banda Aceh was gathered during the performance of the literature study. Additionally, the aspiration of Acehneses, particularly the citizens of Banda Aceh was also acquired from the literature study, to complete the information gathered by interviews. Having evaluated the contribution of Acehneses’ customary <b>land</b> <b>administration</b> system, it is concluded that the customary <b>land</b> <b>administration</b> system is still wanted to be applied in Banda Aceh, even though the Indonesian <b>land</b> <b>administration</b> system has been applied in there for almost half of a century. Some immediate actions on rehabilitation and reconstruction of <b>land</b> <b>administration</b> in Banda Aceh that are not in accordance with the customary background of Acehneses, such as titling the land under Indonesian land tenure regime, could still be applied during the phase of rehabilitation and reconstruction. However, the customary <b>land</b> <b>administration</b> system is still wanted by the Acehneses and particularly citizens of Banda Aceh to be applied in Banda Aceh in the future. For evaluating effectiveness of policy of GoI on rehabilitation and reconstruction of <b>land</b> <b>administration</b> in Banda Aceh, a <b>land</b> <b>administration</b> system performance evaluation framework is developed in this study. The evaluation framework in this study is developed based on conventional <b>land</b> <b>administration</b> theories, as well as adopting the cadastral evaluation framework of Soft System Theory (see Barry, 1999; Augustinus and Barry, 2004). The <b>land</b> <b>administration</b> system performance evaluation framework comprises of three evaluation frameworks, which are evaluating the compliance level of <b>land</b> <b>administration</b> system and its components to the needs and wants of Banda Aceh citizens, as well as the fulfilment of objectives of the higher system of <b>land</b> <b>administration.</b> Having compared the Indonesian <b>land</b> <b>administration</b> system and its implementation to the <b>land</b> <b>administration</b> theories, as well as to the state of <b>land</b> <b>administration</b> in Banda Aceh, Indonesian <b>land</b> <b>administration</b> system is lack of compliance with the <b>land</b> <b>administration</b> problems in rehabilitation and reconstruction of Banda Aceh. Several basic problems have been identified, such as dualism of <b>land</b> <b>administration</b> regime and lack of fulfilment of land registration features that are simplicity, security, affordability, currency and sustainability, as well as lack of realism, binding power, participation/consultation and human resource in Indonesian land use system. Due to existence of previously mentioned basic problems, which leads to bad-operated and ineffective <b>land</b> <b>administration</b> system in Indonesia, immediate efforts are needed to address the <b>land</b> <b>administration</b> problem in rehabilitation and reconstruction of Banda Aceh. GoI, its representative and its partners in rehabilitation and reconstruction of <b>land</b> <b>administration</b> in Banda Aceh therefore have formulated regulations and guidelines regarding the rehabilitation and reconstruction of <b>land</b> <b>administration</b> in Banda Aceh. Having evaluated the policy of GoI on rehabilitation and reconstruction of <b>land</b> <b>administration</b> in Banda Aceh, it is concluded that the main problems of <b>land</b> <b>administration</b> in post-disaster areas, which are insecurity of land tenure and needs to address the effect of the catastrophe and disaster mitigation in spatial plan of Banda Aceh, have almost been solved. The policy of GoI on <b>land</b> <b>administration</b> in post-disaster areas in Banda Aceh also provides a means to fill the gap in Indonesian <b>land</b> <b>administration</b> regulatory framework, which could be employed as well in the future for advancing Indonesian <b>land</b> <b>administration</b> system. Nevertheless, adoption of breakthroughs proposed by and performed under the policy of GoI on <b>land</b> <b>administration</b> in post-disaster areas in Banda Aceh might not be able to fully fill the holes left by Indonesian <b>land</b> <b>administration</b> system, such as the recognition of Acehneses’ customary land tenure (known as Hak Ulayat in Indonesian land tenure system) and no binding power mandated to relevant governmental institutions to enforce the implementation of spatial plan. Without efforts to address the basic problems in Indonesian <b>land</b> <b>administration</b> system, the <b>land</b> <b>administration</b> state in post-disaster areas in Banda Aceh might return to its initial state, even after fully accommodating the previously mentioned breakthroughs in the rehabilitation and reconstruction of <b>land</b> <b>administration</b> in Banda Aceh. Therefore, besides adopting breakthroughs in the rehabilitation and reconstruction of <b>land</b> <b>administration</b> in Banda Aceh, this study recommends the government to provide supportive regulations to adapt to the customary background of Acehneses and Indonesia in general, as well as supportive regulations and procedures for accelerating the rehabilitation and reconstruction of <b>land</b> <b>administration</b> system in Banda Aceh. This study also recommends GoI to train and educate <b>land</b> <b>administration</b> professionals for ensuring the good performance of <b>land</b> <b>administration,</b> as well as to address the basic Indonesian <b>land</b> <b>administration</b> problems.

The vision is especially influenced by three trends in global <b>land</b> <b>administration</b> theory and practice, especially during the last five years and include: sustainable development; spatial enablement; and theoretical achievements in <b>land</b> <b>administration.</b> The challenges for modern <b>land</b> <b>administration</b> systems and in modern government are presented including the roles of <b>land</b> <b>administration</b> in formalizing <b>land</b> markets, implementing and understanding regulations and restrictions, and changing the nature of ownership. The role of spatial enablement and understanding the potential of iLand, the concept of integrated spatially enabled land information available on the Web, are central to understanding the national vision for <b>land</b> <b>administration</b> in Australia. Finally, future directions within technical and operational issues and collaboration and capacity building are presented to assist creation of a new land management model and national vision for spatially enabled <b>land</b> <b>administration</b> by countries in the APR. 27 - 29 JuneOpen Acces...|$|R
40|$|The {{last decade}} {{the call for}} {{unconventional}} approaches to <b>land</b> <b>administration</b> has become manifest. Many global and national policy documents challenge <b>land</b> <b>administration</b> systems to adopt new strategies to cope with pro poor land management, sustainable development eand economic growth. Conventional ways of <b>land</b> <b>administration,</b> e. g. titling programmes, are considered as being too complicated, too accurate, too slowly, too expensive and too much in favour of middle and elite classes. This paper aims at analysing what <b>land</b> <b>administration</b> is, what the new challenges are, and which {{research is needed to}} meet the new requirements.

40|$|Land {{surveyors}} {{are more}} used {{to deal with}} wealth than with poverty. In a world, which is rapidly urbanising with urban poor representing about 50 % in developing countries, new models of establishing tenure security are called for. The paper presents a diversified approach to land registration based on some key topics:- From illegality to formal tenure;- From government to governance;- Urban segregation and urban upgrading;- Management of <b>public</b> <b>land</b> and <b>public</b> space;- Definition of administrative and community boundaries;- Local <b>land</b> <b>administration</b> and basic information at community level. While the paper argues for more differentiated approaches to land tenure regularisation, some common denominators of actions underpinning poverty alleviation strategies, are also discussed, e. g,:- Decentralisation and deregulation;- Safegarding and upgrading public space;- Settlement of administrative and community boundaries;- Registering and managing <b>public</b> <b>land</b> and common land resources;- Establishment of basic information accessible and open for the general public. - Incremental improvements of tenure security in informal areas, especially slums; Titling programmes have so far focused on supporting the land market, while the poor als...|$|R
40|$|Current <b>land</b> <b>administration</b> {{systems are}} the product of 19 th century {{economic}} and land market paradigms and have failed to properly support sustainable development. The need for urgent reform is accepted, but the way forward unclear in many jurisdictions. This paper will discuss current international initiatives and research to develop a new <b>land</b> <b>administration</b> vision to promote sustainable development. Within this context, this paper describes the changing humankind to land relationship, identifies some of the growing environmental pressures facing modern society and the need for sustainable development, explores the evolving role of <b>land</b> <b>administration</b> in society and highlights the need for <b>land</b> <b>administration</b> systems to play a more proactive role in supporting sustainable development objectives. The process to re-engineer <b>land</b> <b>administrations</b> is briefly reviewed. The paper then highlights the development of a national <b>land</b> <b>administration</b> vision and strategy.

40|$|The {{trend in}} modern <b>land</b> <b>{{administration}}</b> systems towards e-land administration aims at improving access to land information {{and services for}} all stakeholders. Vietnam is no exception in this trend. The government has made large investments to develop the land information and registration system with the strong support from donor-funded land registration projects. One aim of land registration and titling {{is to build a}} transparent <b>land</b> <b>administration</b> system. Most investments have focused on the development of a computerised system to improve <b>land</b> <b>administration</b> delivery services. However, there have been some technical and non-technical factors which have become barriers to the implementation of an effective <b>land</b> <b>administration</b> system in the country. This paper presents the evaluation of grassroots stakeholders&# 039; accessibility to the <b>land</b> <b>administration,</b> and {{to the development of a}} modern <b>land</b> <b>administration</b> system in Vietnam. This research is based on a case study which investigates the challenges for development of a conceptual spatial data infrastructure to increase access to land information by all stakeholders in Vietnam...|$|R
