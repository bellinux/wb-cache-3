A 20 -kDa protein was upregulated in PAH-metabolizing M. vanbaalenii PYR- 1 cells compared to control cultures. The differentially expressed protein was identified as a β subunit of the terminal dioxygenase using mass spectrometry. PCR with degenerate primers designed based on de novo sequenced peptides and a series of <b>plaque</b> <b>hybridizations</b> were done to screen the M. vanbaalenii PYR- 1 genomic library. The genes, designated nidA 3 B 3, encoding the α and β subunits of terminal dioxygenase, were subsequently cloned and sequenced. The deduced enzyme revealed close similarities to the corresponding PAH ring-hydroxylating dioxygenases from Mycobacterium and Rhodococcus spp. but had the highest similarity, 61. 9 %, to the α subunit from Nocardioides sp. strain KP 7. The α subunit also showed 52 % sequence homology with the previously reported NidA from M. vanbaalenii PYR- 1. The genes nidA 3 B 3 were subcloned into the expression vector pET- 17 b, and the enzyme activity in Escherichia coli cells was reconstituted through coexpression with the ferredoxin (PhdC) and ferredoxin reductase (PhdD) genes of the phenanthrene dioxygenase from Nocardioides sp. strain KP 7. The recombinant PAH dioxygenase appeared to favor the HMW PAH substrates fluoranthene, pyrene, and phenanthrene. Several other PAHs, including naphthalene, anthracene, and benz[a]anthracene, were also converted to their corresponding cis-dihydrodiols.

Using {{the technique of}} differential <b>plaque</b> filter <b>hybridization,</b> a rat cDNA was isolated whose corresponding gene expression in the kidney was positively modulated up to threefold by sodium depletion. This mRNA was more abundantly expressed in the kidneys of 17 -week-old spontaneously hypertensive rats than those of age-matched Wistar-Kyoto rats. The putative protein encoded by this cDNA is a homologue of cyclophilin, a cytosolic binding protein for cyclosporin A. This cyclophilin-like protein mRNA was expressed in all the tissues examined, including the adrenal, atrium, brain, kidney, liver, lung, spleen, and ventricle. Sodium depletion in rats increased the expression level of this mRNA {{not only in the}} kidney but also in the liver. The administration of cyclosporin A in rats increased the expression level of this mRNA in the kidneys and livers. By virtue of its possible involvement in sodium homeostosis and its homology to cyclophilin, this molecule might have significant implications in the mechanism of cyclosporine-induced renal insufficiency and hypertension...|$|R

40|$|We have {{investigated}} the chromosomal organization of genes that are expressed specifically in the asexual spores (conidia) of the Ascomycete fungus Aspergillus nidulans, using two experimental approaches. In the first, 30 different recombinant clones, containing long nuclear DNA inserts {{and at least one}} spore-specific gene, were selected randomly. The total number of spore-specific genes present in each clone was then determined by RNA blot analysis. In the second approach, several chromosomal recombinant DNA libraries, having average insert lengths ranging from 1 to 15 kilobases, were constructed. The fraction of clones in each library having one or more spore-specific poly(A) +RNA-coding regions was then determined by colony or <b>plaque</b> filter <b>hybridization</b> with radiolabeled, spore-specific, complementary DNA.

40|$|Both pseudorabies {{virus and}} the various strains of avian sarcoma and {{leukosis}} viruses are economically important pathogens. In Canada, pseudorabies is an exotic virus which primarily infects swine. The disease is rapidly fatal in most species although adult pigs may become carriers. Because pseudorabies virus (PrV) is exotic to Canada, imported animals are rigorously tested {{for the presence of}} antibody titers to the virus. The leukosis caused by Rous associated virus (RAV) has a major impact on the health of poultry flocks. Different strains of the avian leukosis viruses cause damage of differing severity but the general characteristics of infection include decreases in both egg and meat production. There would be significant benefits if non-infectious, antigenic fractions from both of these viruses could be produced in bacterial cells. These proteins could be used in serum antibody testing to make the detection of both viruses considerably simpler than the currently used ELISA and virus neutralization tests. As well, the production of large quantities of RAV env protein could simplify studies of the mechanisms of host specificity and provide additional information about chicken cell receptors. I have attempted to produce an antigenically recognizable protein from both pseudo-rabies virus and Rous associated virus. Attempts were made to express such a protein from pseudorabies virus by cloning either cDNA or genomic DNA fragments into plasmid vectors followed by colony immunodetection using a polyclonal antibody against PrV prepared in pig. Although several recombinants produced positive immunological results, further examination showed that none contained PrV DNA sequences. Standard screening methods were modified and improved {{during the course of this}} work. Subsequently, other laboratories identified significant difficulties in using unpurified polyclonal antibodies prepared in swine which provided an explanation for the results I observed. A cDNA library constructed from RNA prepared from RAV- 1 was screened using a probe prepared from env sequences in pSR-XD 2, a plasmid containing much of the RSV sequence. Transformants containing RSV homologous DNA were identified. During purification of these clones and subsequent screenings many of the plasmids identified as containing RSV homologous sequence lost their inserts. Additional studies demonstrated that plasmids which exhibited the strongest homology with the RSV probe and which contained the longest inserts, lost these inserts at a high rate. A second cDNA cloning using a different bacterial host and a different viral strain (RAV- 2) produced several positive clones, with insert lengths ranging from 250 by to 950 bp. These inserts were sequenced and compared to known RSV and RAV sequences. A high degree of homology was observed. The longest RAV- 2 cDNA fragments included most of the env gp 37 polypeptide coding region. In order to test for expression of an antigen, inserts from two independently isolated recombinants were subcloned into lambdagt 11 in each of the three reading frames. A polyclonal antibody prepared against Rous sarcoma virus was used to test for the expression of any recognizable antigenic determinants. No antigen production was detected even though nucleic acid <b>plaque</b> <b>hybridizations</b> demonstrated that the subcloning had been successful in introducing RAV- 2 sequences into lambdagt 11. Possible explanations for this, as well as a discussion of the composition of the RAV- 2 sequences and their placement on the RSV genetic map are considered...|$|R

DNA fragment of 408 bp was amplified in the polymerase chain reactionby using Xc 11 genomic DNA as template. The 408 bp PCR product was then used astemplate for preparing DNA probe (xc 11 B). The Xc 11 genomic DNA was partiallydigested by sau 3 AI, and then DNA fragment around 5 - 15 kb was isolated and usedto construct the Xc 11 genomic library. Three recombinant phages which contain β subunit gene were isolated fromXc 11 genomic library by <b>plaques</b> <b>hybridization</b> with xc 11 B probe.

The DNA sequencing reactions were performed with the constructed deletion clonesand subclones in the 5. 3 kb inserted DNA fragment. The result of DNA sequencinganalysis showed that two open reading frames (ORF) could be found in the 5, 387 bp DNA fragment. The first ORF begins at the bp 63 and ends at bp 429, from whichan 121 amino acids polypeptide could be translated. The amino acids of the firstORF showed 67. 5 % identity with the E. coli L 7 protein. The second ORF contains 4, 146 bp and begins at the bp 681 from which an 1, 381 amino acids polypetidecould be translated. A 68. 96 % identity was found after comparing the second ORFwith the E. coli Beta protein. The deduced amino acids from bp 4, 932 to bp 5, 387 was found to share identity of over 70 % with the N-terminal 157 amino acids ofE. coli Beta protein. N-terminal sequence analysis was performed with the purifiedX. campestris RNA polymerase β subunit. The result of the N-terminal sequenceindicated showed that the cloned β gene was the same N- terminal amino acids asthe purified β subunit protein. This further proves that the 5. 3 kb DNA fragmentdid include the complete nucleotide sequence of the Beta gene.

40|$|The coding {{sequence}} for Anabaena 7120 glutamine synthetase [L-glutamate:ammonia ligase (ADP-forming), EC 6. 3. 1. 1] are {{shown to be}} contained within a 7. 5 -kilobase-pair (kbp) HindIII fragment that has been cloned by <b>plaque</b> <b>hybridization.</b> The hybridization probe for the cyanobacterial gene was a recombinant plasmid containing the glnA gene from Escherichia coli K- 12. Evidence that the cloned Anabaena fragment contains the glnA gene includes complementation of a glnA deletion mutant of E. coli and immunological identity of the enzyme produced by the cloned Anabaena fragment in E. coli with glutamine synthetase purified from Anabaena 7120. Heteroduplex analysis reveals 0. 65 kbp of homology between the 7. 5 -kbp Anabaena 7120 fragment and an 11 -kbp E. coli fragment that codes for E. coli glutamine synthetase. Studies of Anabaena glnA gene activity in E. coli suggest that the cyanobacterial gene is not repressible and that the Anabaena 7120 glutamine synthetase is not adenylylated in E. coli...|$|E
40|$|The APEX {{nuclease}} is a mammalian multifunctional {{repair enzyme}} having 5 ' apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) endonuclease, DNA 3 ' repair diesterase, 3 '- 5 ' exonuclease and DNA 3 ' phosphatase activities. The mouse Apex gene for the enzyme, was isolated from a mouse leukocyte genomic library by <b>plaque</b> <b>hybridization</b> with the mouse Apex cDNA as a probe. The nucleotide {{sequence of the}} Apex gene and its 5 '-and 3 '-flanking regions were determined. With reference to the published Apex cDNA sequence, the mouse Apex gene {{can be divided into}} five exons and four introns with a total length of about 2. 6 kb. The boundaries between exon and intron follow the GT/AG rule. The translation initiation and termination sites are located in exons Ⅱ and Ⅴ, respectively. A part of the 5 ' flanking region belongs to a CpG island, which extends to intron Ⅱ. The CpG island is thought to be a putative transcription regulatory region of the Apex gene, a housekeeping gene...|$|E
40|$|Rat serine dehydratase cDNA clones were {{isolated}} from a lambda gt 11 cDNA library {{on the basis}} of their reactivity with monospecific immunoglobulin to the purified enzyme. Using the cDNA insert from a clone that encoded the serine dehydratase subunit as a probe, additional clones {{were isolated}} from the same library by <b>plaque</b> <b>hybridization.</b> Nucleotide sequence analysis of the largest clone obtained showed that it has 1444 base pairs with an open reading frame consisting of 1089 base pairs. The deduced amino acid sequence contained sequences of several portions of the serine dehydratase protein, as determined by Edman degradation. Rat liver serine dehydratase mRNA virtually disappeared from livers of rats fed a protein-free diet for 5 days. Several genomic clones were isolated from two libraries. Determinations of the transcription start site and the structure of the 3 ' flanking region of the gene indicated that the coded mRNA is 1504 nucleotides long. The 5 ' promoter region contained a variety of sequences similar to several consensus sequences believed to be important for the regulation of specific gene expression...|$|E
40|$|In Clostridium acetobutylicum ATCC 824, {{acetoacetate}} decarboxylase (EC 4. 1. 1. 4) {{is essential}} for solvent production, catalyzing the decarboxylation of acetoacetate to acetone. We report here the purification of the enzyme from C. acetobutylicum ATCC 824 and the cloning and expression of the gene encoding the acetoacetate decarboxylase enzyme in Escherichia coli. A bacteriophage lambda EMBL 3 library of C. acetobutylicum DNA was screened by <b>plaque</b> <b>hybridization,</b> using oligodeoxynucleotide probes derived from the N-terminal amino acid sequence obtained from the purified protein. Phage DNA from positive plaques was analyzed by Southern hybridization. Restriction mapping and subsequent subcloning of DNA fragments hybridizing to the probes localized the gene within an approximately 2. 1 kb EcoRI/Bg/II fragment. A polypeptide with a molecular weight of approximately 28, 000 corresponding {{to that of the}} purified acetoacetate decarboxylase was observed in both Western blots (immunoblots) and maxicell analysis of whole-cell extracts of E. coli harboring the clostridial gene. Although the expression of the gene is tightly regulated in C. acetobutylicum, it was well expressed in E. coli, although from a promoter sequence of clostridial origin...|$|E
40|$|The Chinese hamster {{thymidine}} kinase (TK) gene has been isolated from a recombinant phage library constructed with genomic DNA from mouse Ltk- cells transformed to Tk+ by transfection with Chinese hamster genomic DNA. The phage library was screened by the Benton-Davis <b>plaque</b> <b>hybridization</b> technique, using as probes, subclones of recombinant phage that were isolated from mouse Ltk+ transformants by the tRNA suppressor rescue method. The Chinese hamster TK gene is contained within 13. 2 kilobases of genomic DNA in the isolate designated lambda 34 S 4. This gene, defined by restriction enzyme sensitivity experiments, homology studies with the chicken TK gene, and mRNA blotting experiments, may extend over 8. 5 kilobases. Subclones of the lambda 34 S 4 isolate used as hybridization probes identified a 1, 400 -nucleotide polyadenylated RNA as the hamster TK mRNA. The abundance of this mRNA varies dramatically in Chinese hamster cells cultured under various growth conditions, providing direct {{evidence that the}} growth dependence of TK activity may be regulated in an important way {{at the level of}} cytoplasmic TK mRNA...|$|E
40|$|Type 1 {{hereditary}} tyrosinemia (HT) is an {{autosomal recessive}} disease {{characterized by a}} deficiency of the enzyme fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (FAH; E. C. 3. 7. 1. 2). We have isolated human FAH cDNA clones by screening a liver cDNA expression library using specific antibodies and <b>plaque</b> <b>hybridization</b> with a rat FAH cDNA probe. A 1, 477 -bp cDNA was sequenced and shown to code for FAH by an in vitro transcription-translation assay and sequence homology with tryptic fragments of purified FAH. Transient expression of this FAH cDNA in transfected CV- 1 mammalian cells resulted in the synthesis of an immunoreactive protein comigrating with purified human liver FAH on SDS-PAGE and having enzymatic activity {{as shown by the}} hydrolysis of the natural substrate fumarylacetoacetate. This indicates that the single polypeptide chain encoded by the FAH gene contains all the genetic information required for functional activity, suggesting that the dimer found in vivo is a homodimer. The human FAH cDNA was used as a probe to determine the gene's chromosomal localization using somatic cell hybrids and in situ hybridization. The human FAH gene maps to the long arm of chromosome 15 in the region q 23 -q 25...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{identify}} novel mediators synthesized in activated macrophages, a cDNA library was prepared from cultures of the mouse macrophage cell line RAW 264. 7 that had been treated with lymphokine-rich conditioned medium from mitogen-stimulated mouse spleen cells. Differential <b>plaque</b> <b>hybridization</b> identified a cDNA, designated m 119, that detected a 1. 6 -kilobase mRNA that accumulated in response to gamma-interferon (IFN-gamma) but not in response to other macrophage activators, including IFN-alpha, IFN-beta, and lipopolysaccharide. The mRNA encoded a predicted protein of Mr 14, 461 containing a 21 -amino acid signal peptide. The primary structure of the predicted protein indicated {{that it is a}} member of a recently described family of cytokines related to platelet factor 4, including Gro/melanoma growth stimulatory activity and neutrophil-activating peptide/interleukin 8. The selective induction of the m 119 mRNA by IFN-gamma that the predicted m 119 protein mediates a macrophage activity regulated by IFN-gamma. The m 119 protein may be a cytokine that affects the growth, movement, or activation state of cells that participate in immune and inflammatory responses. It is proposed that the gene encoding this protein be called mig, for monokine induced by gamma interferon...|$|E
40|$|Linear {{forms of}} simian virus 40 (SV 40) DNA, when added to {{transfection}} mixtures containing circular SV 40 and phi X 174 RFI DNAs, enhanced {{the frequency of}} SV 40 /phi X 174 recombination, as measured by infectious center in situ <b>plaque</b> <b>hybridization</b> in monkey BSC- 1 cells. The sequences required for the enhancement of recombination by linear DNA reside within the SV 40 replication origin/regulatory region (nucleotides 5, 171 to 5, 243 / 0 to 128). Linearization of phi X 174 RFI DNA did not increase the recombination frequency. The SV 40 /phi X 174 recombinant structures arising from transfections supplemented with linear forms of origin-containing SV 40 DNA contained phi X 174 DNA sequences interspersed within tandem head-to-tail repeats derived from the recombination-enhancing linear DNA. Evidence is presented that the tandem repeats are not formed by homologous recombination and that linear forms of SV 40 DNA must compete with circular SV 40 DNA for the available T antigen to enhance recombination. We propose that the enhancement of recombination by linear SV 40 DNA results from the entry of that DNA into a rolling circle type of replication pathway which generates highly recombinogenic intermediates...|$|E
