40|$|Seasonal {{changes of}} tide signal(s), temperature, {{salinity}} and current were studied {{during the years}} 2004 - 2005 in the northernmost Gulf of Aqaba, which is under developmental activities, to obtain scientific bases for best management and sustainability. Spectrum analysis revealed <b>permanent</b> <b>signals</b> of tide measurements during all seasons, which represented semidiurnal and diurnal barotropic tides. The other signal periods of 8. 13, 6. 10 - 6. 32, 4. 16 and 1. 02 - 1. 05 h were not detected in all seasons, which were related to shallow water compound and overtides of principle solar and lunar constituents and to seiches generated in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aqaba. Spatial and temporal distributions of temperature, salinity and density showed significant differences between months in the coastal and offshore region and no significant differences among the coastal sites, between the surface and bottom waters and between coastal and offshore waters. Therefore, the temporal and spatial variation of water properties in the northernmost Gulf of Aqaba behave similarly compared to other parts. The coastal current below 12 m depth was weak (3 - 6 cms- 1) and fluctuated from east-northeastward to west-southwestward (parallel to the shoreline), which {{may be related to}} the effect of bottom topography and/or current density due to differential cooling between eastern and western parts in the study area, and wind-induced upwelling and downwelling in the eastern and western side, respectively. The prevailing northerly winds and stratification conditions during summer were the main causes of the southward current at 6 and 12 m depths with average speed of 28 and 12 cms- 1, respectively...|$|E

50|$|The {{off-hook}} tone (also receiver off-hook tone, off-hook warning, or howler tone) is a telephony signal used {{to alert}} a user that the telephone {{has been left}} off-hook without use for an extended period, effectively disabling the telephone line. See <b>permanent</b> <b>signal.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Permanent</b> <b>Signal</b> (PS) in US {{telephony}} jargon, or Permanent Loop in British usage, is {{a condition}} in which a POTS line is off-hook without connection {{for an extended period of}} time. This is indicated in modern switches by the silent termination after the off hook tone times out and the telephone exchange computer puts the telephone line on its High & Wet list or Wetlist. In older switches, however, a <b>Permanent</b> <b>Signal</b> Holding Trunk (PSHT) would play either a howler tone or a 480/500 Hz high tone (which would subsequently bleed into adjacent lines via crosstalk). Howler tone is a tone of increasing intensity that is intended to alert telephone users to the fact that the receiver has been left off the hook without being connected in a call.|$|R
25|$|Strowger-based, {{step-by-step}} {{offices in}} the Bell System required continuous maintenance, such as cleaning.

5000|$|In the North American Numbering Plan a quad-frequency tone is used, {{consisting}} of frequencies 1400 Hz, 2060 Hz, 2450 Hz, and 2600 hertz, at a cadence of 0.1s on, 0.1s off. It is played between the dial-tone timeout [...] recording ("If {{you would like}} to make a call...") and the <b>permanent</b> <b>signal</b> holding state. A single burst of off-hook tone is sometimes used to indicate to a party that their call is being transferred, notably at 1-800-BELL-SOUTH (800-235-5768).|$|R
50|$|A {{dial tone}} is a {{telephony}} signal sent by a telephone exchange or {{private branch exchange}} (PBX) to a terminating device, such as a telephone, when an off-hook condition is detected. It indicates that the exchange is working and is ready to initiate a telephone call. The tone stops when the first dialed digit is recognized. If no digits are forthcoming, the <b>permanent</b> <b>signal</b> procedure is invoked, often eliciting a special information tone and an intercept message, followed by the off-hook tone, requiring the caller to hang up and redial.|$|R
50|$|Once the {{contrast}} agent has been activated by cleavage {{of the sugar}} group, the signal enhancing effects will only diminish if the gadolinium is washed out of the compartment containing it, or if water’s access to the metal group is again inhibited. So, to prevent permanent enhancement of the MR signal, cells must either {{have a way to}} export the gadolinium group to the bloodstream, or they must be able to replace the cleaved sugar group. There is no data in the literature indicating that either approach is feasible in vivo, suggesting that these methods may result in <b>permanent</b> <b>signal</b> amplification.|$|R
50|$|Evolutionary {{psychologists have}} {{advanced}} {{a number of}} different possible explanations for concealed ovulation (and elements of several hypotheses may be true). Some posit that the lack of signaling in some species is a trait retained from evolutionary ancestors, not something that existed previously and later disappeared. If signaling is supposed to have existed and was lost, then it could have been merely due to reduced adaptive importance and lessened selection, or due to direct adaptive advantages for the concealment of ovulation. Yet another possibility (regarding humans specifically) is that while highly specific signaling of ovulation is absent, human female anatomy evolved to mimic <b>permanent</b> <b>signaling</b> of fertility.|$|R

50|$|In most mid-20th-century {{switching}} equipment, a <b>permanent</b> <b>signal</b> would tie up a junctor circuit, {{diminishing the}} ability of the switch to handle outgoing calls. When flooded cables or other conditions made this a real problem, switch staff would open the cable, or paper the off-normal contacts of the crossbar switch, or block the line relay from operating. These methods had the disadvantage of blocking all outgoing calls from that line until it was manually cleared. Manufacturers also sold devices that monitored the talk wires and held up the cutoff relay or crossbar hold magnet until the condition cleared. Some crossbar line circuit designs had a park condition allowing the line circuit itself to monitor the line.|$|R
50|$|Porcelain Raft is Mauro Remiddi's main music project. The New York-based {{musician}} {{began his}} long, prolific career in Italy, {{the place of}} his birth, playing for small, local projects.

In 2011 he signed with Secretly Canadian and released the debut Porcelain Raft full-length record Strange Weekend which peaked at #33 on the Billboard Top Heatseekers Albums chart. <b>Permanent</b> <b>Signal,</b> Porcelain Raft's second album was released on Secretly Canadian in August 2013.|$|R
50|$|In certain circumstances, {{there are}} needs to install {{temporary}} pedestrian crossing signals.

40|$|This paper investigates {{possible}} {{failure modes}} in both dynamic and static CMOS digital circuits due to noise disturbance. In current VLSI circuits, where mixture of static and dynamic implementation is very common, {{it is important}} to identify possible noise failure modes to help designers develop techniques to prevent such failures. Injection of noise causes temporary or <b>permanent</b> <b>signal</b> deviation on a circuit node depending on the level of noise and the affected circuit. The deviation of signal level of the circuit node may lead to functional failure in digital circuits, particularly in dynamic circuit families. Static circuits are inherently robust and can effectively restore the signal deviation before having undesired logic shift. However, some static circuits with a feedback loop cannot recover from noise-induced errors...|$|R
50|$|Depending on the {{duration}} {{and the nature}} of the temporary signals, the equipment can be installed in different way.

50|$|The mast is {{a closed}} {{cylinder}} of 2 m diameter, with an elevator inside. It is guyed at four levels, and carries booms at 20 m intervals in three directions. The 9.4 m booms can be swung up hydraulically, so that instruments at their ends {{can be handled}} from an upper balcony; this swivelling mounting allows much longer booms than the customary sideways-sliding construction. <b>Permanent</b> <b>signal</b> cables in the boom tubes run through the hollow swivel axis, so during boom motion they are only torsion-deformed, a more endurable load than bending. Built around the mast foot is a 200 m2 streamlined building for registration and maintenance purposes.On top of the mast, a compact weather radar was installed in 2007, measuring precipitation up to a radius of 60 km around the mast.|$|R
40|$|The {{cerebellum}} expresses one of {{the highest}} levels of the plasma membrane Ca 2 + ATPase, isoform 2 in the mammalian brain. This highly efficient plasma membrane calcium transporter protein is enriched within the main output neurons of the cerebellar cortex; i. e. the Purkinje neurons (PNs). Here we review recent evidence, including electrophysiological and calcium imaging approaches using the plasma membrane calcium ATPase 2 (PMCA 2) knockout mouse, to show that PMCA 2 is critical for the physiological control of calcium at cerebellar synapses and cerebellar dependent behaviour. These studies have also revealed that deletion of PMCA 2 throughout cerebellar development in the PMCA 2 knockout mouse leads to <b>permanent</b> <b>signalling</b> and morphological alterations in the PN dendrites. Whilst these findings highlight the importance of PMCA 2 during cerebellar synapse function and development, they also reveal some limitations in the use of the PMCA 2 knockout mouse and the need for additional experimental approaches including cell-specific and reversible manipulation of PMCAs...|$|R

40|$|A {{large number}} of {{alterations}} in genes encoding receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK), namely FLT 3, c-KIT, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptors, fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptors, and the anaplastic large cell lymphoma kinase (ALK), {{have been found in}} hematopoietic malignancies. They have drawn much attention after the development of tyrosine kinase inhibitors. RTK gene alterations include point mutations and gene fusions that result from chromosomal rearrangements. In both cases, they activate the kinase domain in the absence of ligand, producing a <b>permanent</b> <b>signal</b> for cell proliferation. Recently, this simple model has been refined. First, by contrast to wild-type RTK, many mutated RTK do not seem to signal from the plasma membrane, but from various locations inside the cell. Second, their signal transduction properties are altered: the pathways that are crucial for cell transformation, such as signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) factors, do not necessarily contribute to the physiologic functions of these receptors. Finally, different mechanisms prevent the termination of the signal, which normally occurs through receptor ubiquitination and degradation. Several mutations inactivating CBL, a key RTK E 3 ubiquitin ligase, have been recently described. In this review, we discuss the possible links among RTK trafficking, signaling, and degradation in leukemic cells. (Blood. 2010; 116 (14) : 2429 - 2437) status: publishe...|$|R
