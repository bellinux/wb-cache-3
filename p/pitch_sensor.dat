40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the effects}} of three pitch controller faults on the responses of an onshore wind turbine and a spar-type offshore floating wind turbine. These faults include: a stuck blade pitch actuator, a fixed value fault and a bias fault of the blade <b>pitch</b> <b>sensor.</b> The faults are modeled in the controller dynamic link library and a short-term extreme response analysis is performed using the HAWC 2 simulation tool. The main objectives of this paper are to investigate how different faults affect the performance of wind turbines for condition monitoring purposes and which differences exist in the structural responses between onshore and offshore floating wind turbines. Statistical analysis of the selected response parameters are conducted using the six 1 -hour stochastic samples for each load case. For condition monitoring purpose, {{the effects of}} faults on the responses at different wind speeds and fault amplitudes are investigated by comparing the same response under normal operation. The severities of the individual faults are categorized by the extreme values of structural loads and the structural components are sorted based on {{the magnitude of the}} fault effects on the extreme values. The <b>pitch</b> <b>sensor</b> fixed value fault is determined as the most severe fault case and the shaft appears as the structural component that experiences the highest risk. The effects of fault conditions on the offshore floating and the onshore wind turbines are compared to investigate the potential differences. The results show that faults cause more damage to the tower and the yaw bearing for the onshore wind turbine and more damage to the shaft for the offshore floating wind turbine...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a model-based scheme for fault detection of a blade pitch system in floating wind turbines. A blade pitch system {{is one of}} the most critical components due to its effect on the operational safety and the dynamics of wind turbines. Faults in this system should be detected at the early stage to prevent failures. To detect faults of blade <b>pitch</b> actuators and <b>sensors,</b> an appropriate observer should be designed to estimate the states of the system. Residuals are generated by a Kalman filter and a threshold based on H optimization, and linear matrix inequality (LMI) is used for residual evaluation. The proposed method is demonstrated in a case study that bias and fixed output in <b>pitch</b> <b>sensors</b> and stuck in pitch actuators.

The types of previously available sensors are detailed including strapdown accelerometers, roll and <b>pitch</b> <b>sensors,</b> gyro and magnetic compasses, depth sensor, and various types of acoustic positioning systems. A doppler velocimeter is added to this sensor suite to improve the performance of the filter. As {{an integral part of the}} filter, magnetic compass and gyrocompass biases are estimated to improve vehicle heading accuracy. The filter is designed to account for numerous real-life complications. These include varying rates of sensor output, lengthy gaps in reception of position information, presence of non-Gaussian position fix errors (flyers), and varying probability density functions for sensor errors. Simulated data are used to test the filter with varying availability of data and accuracy of initial conditions, along with actual data from a deployment of the towed DSL- 120 vehicle. The increased accuracy obtained by using the doppler velocimeter is emphasized. [URL]...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} improve {{reliability}} of wind turbines, {{it is important to}} detect faults in their very early occurrence, and to handle them in an optimal way. This paper focuses on the <b>pitch</b> <b>sensors</b> of the turbine blade system, as they are mainly used for wind turbine control, in order to maximise the power production, and the efficiency of the whole process. On the other hand, as the input–output behaviour of the system under diagnosis is nonlinear, this work suggests a modelling scheme relying on piecewise affine models, whose parameters are identified through the acquired input–output measurements affected by measurement uncertainty. Therefore, these hybrid prototypes are exploited for generating suitable residual signals, which allow the detection and the isolation of the considered sensor faults. This noise rejection scheme is used since the wind turbine measurements are not very reliable, due to the uncertainty of wind speed acting on the wind turbine, and to the turbulence around the rotor plane. A detailed benchmark model simulating the wind turbine where realistic fault conditions can be considered shows the effectiveness of both the identification and fault diagnosis techniques...|$|R

40|$|Reset {{controllers}} {{are commonly}} used to smooth the transient response of systems. We use this technique to improve a standard baseline pitch controller for offshore wind turbines (WTs). The introduction of this strategy enhances the overall performance of the WT. In particular, the fore-aft and side-to-side accelerations of the WT tower are significantly reduced, whilst a steadier power output is obtained, {{in comparison to the}} standard baseline pitch controller. Furthermore, our designed pitch control’s main advantage, with respect to the baseline, is its ease of implementation and reduced complexity as it does not require a gain-scheduling technique, nor pitch position measurement (thus, it is insensitive to <b>pitch</b> <b>sensor</b> faults).

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to show a novel {{fault-tolerant}} tracking control (FTC) strategy with robust fault estimation and compensating for simultaneous actuator sensor faults. Based on the framework of fault-tolerant control, developing an FTC design method for wind turbines is a challenge and, thus, they can tolerate simultaneous pitch actuator and <b>pitch</b> <b>sensor</b> faults having bounded first time derivatives. The paper’s key contribution is proposing a descriptor sliding mode method, in which for establishing a novel augmented descriptor system, with which we can estimate the state of system and reconstruct fault by designing descriptor sliding mode observer, the paper introduces an auxiliary descriptor state vector composed by a system state vector, actuator fault vector, and sensor fault vector. By the optimized method of LMI, the conditions for stability that estimated error dynamics are set up to promote the determination of the parameters designed. With this estimation, and designing a fault-tolerant controller, the system’s stability can be maintained.

40|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} {{the characteristics of}} a wind turbine under blade pitch angle and shaft speed sensor faults as well as pitch actuator faults. A land-based NREL 5 MW variable speed pitch reg- ulated wind turbine is considered as a reference. The conventional collective blade pitch angle controller strategy with independent pitch actuators control is used for load reduction. The wind turbine class is IEC-BII. The main purpose is to investigate the severity of end effects on structural loads and responses and consequently identify the high-risk components according to the type and amplitude of fault using a servo-aero-elastic simulation code, HAWC 2. Both transient and steady state effects of faults are studied. Such information is useful for wind turbine fault detection and identification as well as system reliability analysis. Results show the effects of faults on wind turbine power output and responses. <b>Pitch</b> <b>sensor</b> faults mainly affects the vibration of shaft main bearing, while generator power and aerodynamic thrust are not changed significantly, due to independent pitch actuator control of three blades.

40|$|New {{algorithms}} {{are described}} covering the simulation, processing, and calibration of penetration angles of the Barnes static Earth sensor assembly (SESA) as {{implemented in the}} Goddard Space Flight Center Flight Dynamics Division ground support system for the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Observatory. The new treatment involves {{a detailed analysis of}} the measurements by individual quadrants. It is shown that, to a good approximation, individual quadrant misalignments can be treated simply as penetration angle biases. Simple formulas suitable for real-time applications are introduced for computing quadrant-dependent effects. The simulator generates penetration angles by solving a quadratic equation with coefficients uniquely determined by the spacecraft's position and the quadrant's orientation in GeoCentric Inertial (GCI) coordinates. Measurement processing for attitude determination is based on linearized equations obtained by expanding the coefficients of the aforementioned quadratic equation as a Taylor series in both the Earth oblateness coefficient (alpha approx. 1 / 150) and the angle between the pointing axis and the geodetic nadir vector. A simple formula relating a measured value of the penetration angle to the deviation of the Earth-pointed axis from the geodetic nadir vector is derived. It is shown that even near {{the very edge of the}} quadrant's Field Of View (FOV), attitude errors resulting from quadratic effects are a few hundredths of a degree, which is small compared to the attitude determination accuracy requirement (0. 18 degree, 3 sigma) of TRMM. Calibration of SESA measurements is complicated by a first-order filtering used in the TRMM onboard algorithm to compute penetration angles from raw voltages. A simple calibration scheme is introduced where these complications are avoided by treating penetration angles as the primary raw measurements, which are adjusted using biases and scale factors. In addition to three misalignment parameters, the calibration state vector contains only two average penetration angle biases (one per each pair of opposite quadrants) since, because of the very narrow sensor FOV (+/- 2. 6 degrees), differences between biases of the penetration angles measured by opposite quadrants cannot be distinguished from roll and <b>pitch</b> <b>sensor</b> misalignments. After calibration, the estimated misalignments and average penetration angle biases are converted to the four penetration angle biases and to the yaw misalignment angle. The resultant biases and the estimated scale factors are finally used to update the coefficients necessary for onboard computations of penetration angles from measured voltages...|$|E
