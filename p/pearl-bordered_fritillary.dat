5|$|One of the project's {{goals is}} to protect, restore and create areas of reedbed, grazing marsh, fen, raised bog, lowland meadow, purple moor grass and rush {{pastures}} and wet woodland. Species of conservation concern (UK Biodiversity Action Plan priority species) {{that are likely to}} benefit from this project include plants such as: divided sedge (Carex divisa), English sticky eyebright (Euphrasia anglica), greater water parsnip (Sium latifolium), lesser butterfly orchid (Platanthera bifolia), marsh stitchwort (Stellaria palustris) and tubular water dropwort (Oenanthe fistulosa). The flora provides a habitat for several species of invertebrates. These include moths such as the argent and sable moth (Rheumaptera hastata), narrow bordered bee hawk-moth (Hemaris tityus) and narrow bordered bee hawk-moth (Hemaris tityus). While butterfly species include the small heath (Coenonympha pamphilus), <b>pearl-bordered</b> <b>fritillary</b> (Boloria euphrosyne) and small <b>pearl-bordered</b> <b>fritillary</b> (Boloria selene). Beetles found in the valley include the lesser silver water beetle (Hydrochara caraboides) and one-grooved diving beetle (Bidessus unistriatus). There are also shining ram's-horn snails (Segmentina nitida) and shrill carder bees (Bombus sylvarum).|$|E
5|$|Several rare {{butterflies}} are {{indigenous to}} the area, including the nationally scarce <b>pearl-bordered</b> <b>fritillary</b> (Boloria euphrosyne), Duke of Burgundy (Hamearis lucina), and white-letter hairstreak (Satyrium w-album). The {{large blue butterfly}} (Maculinea arion) became extinct in the hills in the late 1970s, since when a research project has been undertaken into its ecology and reintroduction. The white-clawed crayfish is also nationally rare and is a declining species with small populations in {{a tributary of the}} Mells River and the River Chew.|$|E
50|$|Four {{species of}} {{fritillary}} butterfly - marsh (Eurodryas aurinia), small pearl-bordered (Boloria selene), dark green (Argynnis aglaja), and silver-washed (Argynnis paphia) - have been noted. The marsh and small <b>pearl-bordered</b> <b>fritillaries</b> {{occur in the}} wet pastures, whilst the dark green is found on the drier bracken slopes and the silver-washed in the tree canopy. All have declined nationally and are local species, now principally of south-western Britain. Rare and also present is the brown hairstreak (Thecla betulae), while the small copper (Lycaena phlaeas) and green hairstreak (Callophrys rubi) are notably abundant.|$|R
5|$|Cheddar Wood and {{the smaller}} Macall's Wood form a {{biological}} Site of Special Scientific Interest from {{what remains of the}} wood of the Bishops of Bath and Wells in the 13thcentury and of King Edmund the Magnificent's wood in the 10th. During the 19thcentury, its lower fringes were grubbed out to make strawberry fields. Most of these have been allowed to revert to woodland. The wood was coppiced until 1917. This site compromises a wide range of habitats which include ancient and secondary semi-natural broadleaved woodland, unimproved neutral grassland, and a complex mosaic of calcareous grassland and acidic dry dwarf-shrub heath. Cheddar Wood is one of only a few English stations for starved wood-sedge (Carex depauperata). Purple gromwell (Lithospermum purpurocaeruleum), a nationally rare plant, also grows in the wood. Butterflies include silver-washed fritillary (Argynnis paphia), dark green fritillary (Argynnis aglaja), <b>pearl-bordered</b> <b>fritillary</b> (Boloria euphrosyne), holly blue (Celastrina argiolus) and brown argus (Aricia agestis). The slug Arion fasciatus, which has a restricted distribution in the south of England, and the soldier beetle Cantharis fusca also occur.|$|E
25|$|Rare {{plants that}} occur in Wanister Bog include devil's-bit scabious, Succisa pratensis, and marsh violet, Viola palustris. The former is the food plant of the marsh fritillary, Euphydryas aurinia, and the narrow-bordered bee hawk-moth, Hemaris tityus, while the latter is the food plant of the <b>pearl-bordered</b> <b>fritillary,</b> Boloria euphrosyne, and the small <b>pearl-bordered</b> <b>fritillary.</b>|$|E
25|$|Brackens of the Northern Hemisphere {{are used}} as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species {{including}} dark green fritillary, dot moth, high brown fritillary, gold swift, map-winged swift, <b>pearl-bordered</b> <b>fritillary,</b> orange swift, small angle shades, small <b>pearl-bordered</b> <b>fritillary.</b> They also form an important ecological partnership with plants such as violet and cow-wheat (Melampyrum pratense) for various Boloria fritillary species.|$|E
25|$|The Limestone grasslands {{support a}} wide variety of wild flowers, and many rarer {{butterflies}} can be seen. <b>Pearl-bordered</b> <b>fritillary,</b> Duke of Burgundy fritillary, marbled white, dingy skipper and grayling are just some of species that inhabit the national park.|$|E
25|$|Other notable insects {{include two}} other moths, {{northern}} drab, Orthosia opima, and dingy shell, Euchoeca nebulata, and a butterfly, the green hairstreak, Callophrys rubi. Another butterfly, the small <b>pearl-bordered</b> <b>fritillary,</b> Boloria selene, {{used to be}} common at Waldridge Fell but within County Durham is now confined to only four locations, all on heathland at around 300metres above sea level.|$|E
500|$|Scarce plants {{found at}} the warren include knotted {{pearlwort}} (Sagina nodosa), and slender bedstraw (Galium pumilum). Butterflies recorded here include the small blue (Cupido minimus), marbled white (Melanargia galathea), dingy skipper (Erynnis tages), grizzled skipper (Pyrgus malvae), [...] small <b>pearl-bordered</b> <b>fritillary</b> (Boloria selene), and wall brown (Lasiommata megera).|$|E

2500|$|Woodlands in North Dorset are scarce, and Piddles Wood {{is one of}} only {{a handful}} of such sites. Due to the heavy neutral and lighter acid soil types—caused by the {{underlying}} Kimmeridge Clay and Plateau Gravels—the site has a varying woodland flora, containing broadleaved, mixed and yew lowland. However, it is dominated by oak and [...] hazel—for which reason the site was listed as an SSSI—and its flora and fauna is typical of oak woodland in Dorset. Piddles Wood has an abundance of ground flora, including woodruff (Galium odoratum), sanicle (Sanicula europaea), early purple orchid (Orchis mascula), wood spurge (Euphorbia amygdaloides) and orpine (Sedum telephium). The site is also very rich for insect fauna, and among the butterflies found on the site are the white admiral (Limenitis camilla), wood white (Leptidea sinapis) and silver-washed fritillary (Argynnis paphia); it was previously home to the <b>pearl-bordered</b> <b>fritillary</b> (Boloria euphrosyne), although this is now believed to be extinct in Dorset. Adjacent to the edge of the site is an extensive poultry farm, containing approximately 100,000 birds.|$|E
