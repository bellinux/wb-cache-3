40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{examine and}} compare the <b>{{prescribing}}</b> <b>unit</b> and a new prescribing index adjusting for age and sex in assessing general practice prescribing. DESIGN [...] Analysis of all prescriptions issued by two practices in one year. Use of data to derive a prescribing index adjusting for age and sex. Comparison of effect of <b>prescribing</b> <b>unit</b> and new index on relation between 80 practices' prescribing data and family health services authority average. SETTING [...] Newcastle and Gateshead Family Health Services Authorities. Two urban practices with eight doctors and combined list size of 16, 300 patients. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Cost and number of prescriptions issued to each age and sex group. Effect of index on relation between practice data and family health services authority average. RESULTS [...] The number of items prescribed and total costs rose with age. Although total costs were greater for women than for men, individual items cost more for men aged 25 - 84. Comparison of data adjusted by the <b>prescribing</b> <b>unit</b> and the new index with authority averages produced no significant differences except in a few practices with skewed age-sex demography. Results with the two indexes differed by over 5 % in 34 % (27 / 80) of practices for costs and in 14 % (11 / 80) for items prescribed. CONCLUSIONS [...] The age and sex profile of a practice does not explain interpractice variation in prescribing patterns. Other unidentified factors need to be considered...|$|R

DESIGN [...] Analysis of prescribing data (PACT) for one year before and one year after practices become first, second, or third wave fundholders and comparison with practices that were not fundholders during {{any part of the}} study. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Prescribing costs (net ingredient cost per <b>prescribing</b> <b>unit),</b> <b>prescribing</b> volume (items per 1000 <b>prescribing</b> <b>units),</b> net ingredient cost per item, and percentage of generic prescribing. SETTING [...] Former Mersey Regional Health Authority. SUBJECTS [...] 100 fundholders (20 first wave, 31 second wave, 49 third wave) and 312 nonfundholders. RESULTS [...] Prescribing costs and volume rose throughout the study in all groups. In all three fundholding waves the rate of increase of prescribing costs was significantly lower than for nonfundholders. Both cost per item and prescribing volume tended to decrease, the former probably because of a significant increase in generic prescribing. Fundholding and non-fundholding practices differed in several respects. CONCLUSION [...] Fundholding has altered practice prescribing patterns compared with those of nonfundholders, increasing generic prescribing and reducing the rate of increase of prescribing costs...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To derive a {{predictive}} model for national prescribing behaviour {{in terms of}} basic morbidity and demographic factors. DESIGN [...] 24 demographic, morbidity, and practice factors were entered into a multiple regression analysis to determine the net ingredient cost per patient. SETTING [...] The 90 family health service authorities in England for 1989. RESULTS [...] For net ingredient cost per patient only two demographic factors (numbers of pensioners and the mobility of the registered population measured by list inflation) and two morbidity related factors (standardised mortality ratios and numbers of prepayment certificates issued) significantly contributed to a multiple regression model. This model explained 81 % {{of the variation in}} net ingredient cost per registered patient between family health services authorities. The model also enabled a weighting factor of 4. 6 (95 % confidence interval 3. 2 to 6. 7) to be derived for the net ingredient cost for elderly patients (compared with the existing <b>prescribing</b> <b>unit</b> factor of 3). CONCLUSIONS [...] The model shows that variations in prescribing costs essentially reflect demand. It also suggests that the current <b>prescribing</b> <b>unit</b> value of 3 for patients aged 65 or more underestimates the extra costs of prescribing for elderly patients...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{determine}} whether the first five waves of English fundholding practices have reduced their prescribing costs relative to non-fundholding practices, and the duration of any reduction achieved. DESIGN: Analysis of item and cost data for all general practices in England in the six years from April 1990 to March 1996. The practices {{of each of the}} first five waves were identified at the Prescription Pricing Authority. SETTING: All general practices in England. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Changes and rates of change in net ingredient cost per <b>prescribing</b> <b>unit,</b> and changes in number of items per <b>prescribing</b> <b>unit</b> in fundholding practices, before and after fundholding, relative to continuing non-fundholders. RESULTS: Absolute prescribing costs increased over the six years, by 66 % in the continuing non-fundholders and by 56 - 59 % for fundholders. Successive waves of fundholders showed a similar pattern of change: a small relative reduction in the pre-fundholding year, maximum relative reduction in the first year, and a declining relative reduction {{in the second and third}} years. After this, their increases in costs were largely similar to those of non-fundholders. The number of items dispensed remained stable over the six years in all groups. CONCLUSIONS: The real budgets operated by fundholders were associated with a reduction in costs of about 6 % relative to continuing non-fundholders, and this saving seemed to be retained during the study. The relative reduction was small compared with the absolute increase seen in all groups and disappeared after the third year of fundholding. It was brought about by lowering the average cost per item rather than by giving fewer items...|$|R

5000|$|Adopting {{the metric}} system was {{discussed}} in Parliament {{as early as}} 1818 and some industries and even some government agencies had metricated, or {{were in the process}} of metricating by the mid 1960s. However, a formal government policy to support metrication was not agreed until 1965. This policy, initiated in response to requests from industry, was to support voluntary metrication, with costs picked up where they fell. In 1969 the government created the Metrication Board as a quango to promote and coordinate metrication. In 1978, after some carpet retailers reverted to pricing by the square yard rather than the square metre, government policy shifted, and they started issuing orders making metrication mandatory in certain sectors. In 1980 government policy shifted again to prefer voluntary metrication, and the Metrication Board was abolished. By the time the Metrication Board was wound up, all the economic sectors that fell within its remit except road signage and parts of the retail trade sector had metricated.

40|$|Background General Practitioners (GP) {{have limited}} means to compete. As quality {{is hard to}} observe by patients, GPs have {{incentives}} to signal quality by using instruments patients perceive as quality. Objectives I investigate whether GPs <b>prescribe</b> more <b>units</b> when confronted with more competition. As there is no monetary benefit in doing so, this type of (perceived) quality competition originates from GPs satisfying patientsâ€™ expectations. Method Market level data on per capita and per contact number of items prescribed by GPs is studied for the Belgian market of General Practitioners. I hypothesize that GP competition has {{a positive impact on}} the prescribed volume, after controlling for medical needs and GP characteristics. Properly controlling for medical needs implies the use of a two-stage linear regression model. Findings The analysis indicates that a higher number of GPs per capita results in a higher number of <b>units</b> <b>prescribed</b> by GPs, both per capita and per contact. This is consistent with quality competition in the GP market, while inconsistent with alternatives explanations (GP scarcity, GP inducement and GP dispersing prescription in time). Conclusion GPs <b>prescribe</b> more <b>units</b> when there is more competition to satisfy patientsâ€™ expectations. The paper thus presents empirical evidence of (perceived) quality competition...|$|R
