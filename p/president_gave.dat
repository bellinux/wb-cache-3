Kennedy was given an honorary doctorate degree in law at the ceremony, making San Diego State the first in California to award an honorary doctorate degree. To commemorate his visit, the campus added his portrait to the campus library collection and a granite stone marker placed where his helicopter landed (California Historical Landmark #798). In April 2008, a plaque that commemorated his visit was stolen {{and has yet to}} be recovered. On May 29, 1964 Martin Luther King Jr. spoke at the Open Air Theater about proposed legislation in improving rights for African Americans.|$|E
25|$|On December 23, 1972, a {{magnitude}} 6.2 earthquake leveled the capital city, Managua. The earthquake killed 10,000 of the city's 400,000 residents and left another 50,000 homeless. About 80% of Managua's commercial buildings were destroyed. President Anastasio Somoza Debayle's National Guard embezzled {{much of the}} international aid that flowed into the country to assist in reconstruction, and several parts of downtown Managua were never rebuilt. The <b>president</b> <b>gave</b> reconstruction contracts preferentially to family and friends, thereby profiting from the quake and increasing his control of the city's economy. By some estimates, his personal wealth rose to US$400 million in 1974.|$|E
25|$|On May 30, the Court of State Security found Patrice Booto, {{the editor}} of Le Journal arrested in November 2005, guilty of {{insulting}} {{the head of state}} and sentenced him to six months in prison and a $500 (265,000 Congolese francs) fine. The charge stemmed from an article that Booto published claiming—without evidence—that the <b>president</b> <b>gave</b> $30 million to Tanzania for its education budget while the transitional government remained in a payment dispute with teachers. On July 27, after Booto paid the fine and spent nine months in jail, an appeals court found him guilty of reporting false information but acquitted him of insulting the head of state, resulting in his release on August 3.|$|E

25|$|When he {{returned}} to the US, he turned to drinking to forget his problems. His wife enlisted the help of his cousin, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who ordered the FBI to track him down, and he was brought back to his family. In late April 1942, his brother Archibald sought to have him committed to a sanitarium for a year; at month's end, he agreed to a four-month stay at an institution in Hartford. To extricate him from his current situation, the <b>President</b> <b>gave</b> him a commission as a major in the United States Army, and had him transferred and posted to Fort Richardson, Alaska, where he worked as an intelligence officer and helped establish a territorial militia of Eskimos and Aleuts.|$|E
25|$|The text of {{the first}} of the three books of the Principia was {{presented}} to the Royal Society at the close of April 1686. Hooke made some priority claims (but failed to substantiate them), causing some delay. When Hooke's claim was made known to Newton, who hated disputes, Newton threatened to withdraw and suppress Book 3 altogether, but Halley, showing considerable diplomatic skills, tactfully persuaded Newton to withdraw his threat and let it go forward to publication. Samuel Pepys, as <b>President,</b> <b>gave</b> his imprimatur on 30 June 1686, licensing the book for publication. The Society had just spent its book budget on a History of Fishes, and the cost of publication was borne by Edmund Halley (who was also then acting as publisher of the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society): the book appeared in summer 1687.|$|E
25|$|Ceaușescu was {{prepared}} {{to take a more}} decisive step in questioning Soviet policies. In the early years of his rule, he generally relaxed political pressures inside Romanian society, which led to the late 1960s and early 1970s being the most liberal decade in Socialist Romania. Gaining the public's confidence, Ceaușescu took a clear stand against the 1968 crushing of the Prague Spring by Leonid Brezhnev. After a visit from Charles de Gaulle earlier in the same year, during which the French <b>President</b> <b>gave</b> recognition to the incipient maverick, Ceaușescu's public speech in August deeply impressed the population, not only through its themes, but also because, uniquely, it was unscripted. He immediately attracted Western sympathies and backing, which lasted well beyond the 'liberal' phase of his rule; at the same time, the period brought forward the threat of armed Soviet invasion: significantly, many young men inside Romania joined the Patriotic Guards created {{on the spur of the}} moment, in order to meet the perceived threat. President Richard Nixon was invited to Bucharest in 1969, which was the first visit of a United States president to a Socialist country after the start of the Cold War.|$|E

General Abdul Waheed was an uptight, strict, and a professional officer with a views of Westernized democracy.

500|$|In 1942, Hand's friends {{once again}} lobbied {{for him to}} fill a Supreme Court vacancy, but Roosevelt did not appoint him. The <b>president</b> <b>gave</b> age as the reason, but {{philosophical}} differences with Hand may also have played a part. Another explanation lies in one of Justice William O. Douglas's autobiographies, where Douglas states that, despite Roosevelt's belief that Hand was the best person for the job, Roosevelt had been offended by the pressure Justice Felix Frankfurter placed on the president during a vigorous letter-writing campaign on Hand's behalf. [...] D.C. Circuit Judge Wiley Blount Rutledge, whom Roosevelt appointed, died in 1949, while Hand lived until 1961. [...] In a February 1944 correspondence with Frankfurter, Hand expressed a low opinion of Roosevelt’s new appointees, referring to Justice Hugo Black, Justice Douglas, and Justice Frank Murphy as [...] "Hillbilly Hugo, Good Old Bill, and Jesus lover of my Soul". [...] Deeply disappointed at the time, Hand later regretted his ambition: [...] "It was the importance, the power, the trappings of the God damn thing that really drew me on." ...|$|E

[...] The New Yorker traveled [...] in the campaign, reaching 24 of the 45states. [...] Hanna was now a public figure, and wanted to campaign for the Republicans in the western states. [...] McKinley, however, was reluctant, as Hanna had varied from the administration's position on trusts in a recent speech. [...] McKinley sent Postmaster General Charles Emory Smith to Chicago, where Hanna then was, {{to talk him out}} of the trip. [...] Hanna rapidly discerned that Smith had been sent by the President, and told him, [...] "Return to Washington and tell the President that God hates a coward." [...] McKinley and Hanna met in Canton several days later and settled their differences over lunch. [...] Hanna made his speaking tour in the West. [...] According to Hanna biographer Thomas Beer, Hanna's tour was a great success, though many viewers were surprised he did not wear suits decorated with the [...] "dollar mark".|$|E
500|$|Before Monitor was {{put into}} dry dock for repairs President Lincoln, Navy Secretary Fox, various {{officials}} {{and a few of}} Worden's close friends arrived to ceremoniously review the vessel and pay respect to the crew and former commander Worden, who after a long and partial recovery arrived for the occasion. Entire regiments were also directed to come by the naval yard and review the ship and honor the crew.

When Worden, with part of his face blacked from the wounds he received at Hampton Roads, came aboard, the heavy guns in the navy yard were fired in [...] President Lincoln came forward and greeted Worden and then introduced him to some of the others.

Worden called each of them by name and spoke friendly to and complimented each of them personally. When order was restored the <b>President</b> <b>gave</b> a short speech about Worden's career. At Fox's request, Worden gave a speech to the gathering about his voyage from New York to Hampton Roads, the trials they were faced with along the way and of the great battle between Monitor and Virginia, while paying tribute to many of the officers and men involved. In closing he gave special thanks to Ericsson, Lincoln, Welles and all who made construction of Monitor possible.|$|E

500|$|HUD {{tried again}} to {{implement}} a regulatory prohibition of seller-funded down payments when it re-proposed, in May 2007, its failed 1999 proposal. [...] There were some 15,000 comments from the public, the majority of which were brief statements of opposition written [...] "in a standard similar format and wording". [...] While the period for public comment was still open, the Committee on Financial Services held a hearing on down payment assistance, a primary topic at which was the HUD proposal. [...] Nehemiah's <b>president</b> <b>gave</b> testimony at this hearing, saying [...] "mend it, don't end it" [...] and, in a written statement, adding that the proposal [...] "makes no sense as rational behavior or measured action". [...] In October 2007, HUD pronounced its proposed change as [...] "final", meaning that it now would be implemented, with an effective date of October 31, 2007. [...] However, Nehemiah sued HUD in a federal district court, citing violations of the Administrative Procedure Act. [...] In particular, Nehemiah alleged that (i) HUD failed to provide a [...] "reasoned analysis" [...] for its change in policy, (ii) HUD ignored reasonable alternatives (such as charging mortgage-insurance premiums that varied according {{to the risk of}} default), (iii) HUD relied on data that was not provided to the public, and (iv) HUD's secretary (Alphonso Jackson) had prejudged the outcome before all public comments had been received. [...] At about the same time, another provider of seller-funded down-payment assistance (AmeriDream) filed a similar action in a different court. [...] On October 31, that other court issued a temporary order barring HUD from implementing the regulation until a final disposition had been reached. [...] The court in Nehemiah issued its final ruling in February 2008, finding that Nehemiah prevailed on some (but not all) of its allegations. [...] The court ordered HUD to vacate the regulation.|$|E
500|$|Throughout the afternoon, crowds {{had filled}} the floor outside the blocked-off aisle, and the {{galleries}} as well, {{wanting to see}} the President, {{even if they could}} not greet him. [...] McKinley arrived just on time, glanced at the arrangements, and walked over to his place, where he stood with Milburn on his left and Cortelyou on his right. [...] The pipe organ began to play [...] "The Star-Spangled Banner" [...] as McKinley ordered the doors open to admit those who had waited to greet him. The police let them in, and McKinley prepared to perform his [...] "favorite part of the job." [...] An experienced politician, McKinley could shake hands with 50 people per minute, gripping their hands first so as to both guide them past him quickly and prevent his fingers from being squeezed. [...] Cortelyou anxiously watched the time; about halfway through the ten minutes allotted, he sent word to Babcock to have the doors closed when the presidential secretary raised his hand. Seeing Cortelyou looking at his watch, Babcock moved towards the doors. [...] As the reception continued, the organist played works by Johann Sebastian Bach. The procession of citizens shaking hands with their President was interrupted when 12-year-old Myrtle Ledger of Spring Brook, New York, who was accompanied by her mother, asked McKinley for the red carnation he always wore on his lapel. [...] The <b>President</b> <b>gave</b> it to her, then resumed work without his trademark good-luck piece. [...] The Secret Service men looked suspiciously on a tall, swarthy man who appeared restless as he walked towards the President, but {{breathed a sigh of relief}} when he shook hands with McKinley without incident and began to move towards the exit. [...] The usual rule that those who approached the President must do so with their hands open and empty was not being enforced, perhaps due to the heat of the day, as several people were using handkerchiefs to wipe their brows; the man who followed the swarthy individual had his right hand wrapped in one, as if injured. [...] Seeing this, McKinley reached for his left hand instead. [...] As the two men's hands touched at 4:07pm, Czolgosz shot McKinley twice in the abdomen with a [...]32 Iver Johnson revolver concealed under the handkerchief.|$|E
