5|$|The strict {{requirements}} {{have been}} justified {{on the basis}} that the President should be a person of integrity and moral standing, with the ability to monitor the financial affairs {{of the state and the}} management of the public service sector. Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong has argued that this stringent screening process is necessary as the <b>President</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> stand as a political party nominee. He is thus not subjected to the internal screening mechanism of the ruling People's Action Party (PAP).|$|E
5|$|Furthermore, {{executive}} {{power in the}} EU isn't concentrated in a single institution. It becomes clearer under the Lisbon Treaty with {{the division of the}} European Council as a distinct institution with a fixed President. This arrangement has been compared to the dual executive system found in the French republic where there is a President (the Council President) and Prime Minister (the Commission President). However, unlike the French model, the Council <b>President</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> hold formal powers such as the ability to directly appoint and sack the other, or the ability to dissolve Parliament. Hence while the Council President may have prestige, it would lack power and while the Commission President would have power, it would lack the prestige of the former.|$|E
5|$|In early November 2008, the President of Iceland, Ólafur Ragnar Grímsson, at an {{informal}} lunch with foreign diplomats, criticized Iceland's traditional friends (particularly Britain, Sweden and Denmark) {{as well as}} the International Monetary Fund. According to a memo from the Norwegian embassy, he suggested that the Russians might want to use the Keflavík Air Base, the Russian ambassador replied that they had no need for it. The President is quoted to have said that Iceland would soon recover, even if they had to fight alone. The <b>President</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> necessarily agree with the government on these issues.|$|E

5|$|The Council {{is made up}} of its Chairman (as of 6 November 2012 the Chief Justice of Singapore, Sundaresh Menon), up to ten {{permanent}} members who are appointed for life, and up to ten ordinary members who are appointed for a period of three years and may be re-appointed. Appointments are made by the President on the advice of the Cabinet. If the <b>President</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> concur with Cabinet's advice, he may veto appointments. However, he is required to consult the Council of Presidential Advisers ("CPA"), and if the CPA does not concur with his view, Parliament may override his decision with a resolution passed with a two-thirds majority vote. The President has no power to remove current PCMR members.|$|E
25|$|In {{case the}} President is {{temporarily}} absent, {{one of the}} Vice-Presidents designated by him/her stands in for him/her. If the <b>President</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> designate any of the Vice-Presidents to stand in for him/her, the oldest Vice-President shall stand in for him/her.|$|E
25|$|Vice President Cheney {{advised that}} no one ever told him that Wilson went to Niger because of his wife's CIA status and, in fact, the Vice <b>President</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> have any idea to this day why Joseph Wilson was {{selected}} to go to Niger.|$|E
60|$|The <b>President</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> reply. He was anxiously {{watching}} the Record and scribbling {{notes on a}} paper beside him. His face was pale and his lips tightly compressed.|$|R
50|$|On 10 July 2008 the Slovak media {{reported}} that Kováč probably suffered from Parkinson's disease. The former <b>president</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> confirm this information but {{admitted that he}} had some health problems.|$|R

25|$|Non-partisan, no {{more than}} three Commissioners may belong to the same {{political}} party. The President also designates one of the Commissioners as Chairman, the SEC's top executive. However, the <b>President</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> possess the power to fire the appointed Commissioners, a provision that was made to ensure the independence of the SEC. This issue arose during the 2008 presidential election in connection with the ensuing financial crises.|$|E
25|$|The {{position}} of President is an honorary one. The <b>President</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> take a salary and is chosen from {{supporters of the}} club. Past holders of the seat have included former Prime Minister Sir John Major {{and a number of}} former players, an example of which is the 2011 President and 1960s Surrey slow left-arm bowler Roger Harman, who held the post for a single year, as has been customary in recent years. He was the 48th President.|$|E
25|$|According to the Constitution, the President Elect {{must take}} the Oath of Office on December 1, before {{a joint session of}} Congress; the Constitution also states that the presidential term begins on December 1. Members of Congress {{belonging}} to the parties in the Coalition had threatened to disrupt the ceremony, with actions similar to those that prevented Vicente Fox from delivering his State of the Union address on September 1. According to the Constitution, if the elected <b>president</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> take the Oath of Office on 1 December before a joint session, the presidency is declared vacant and an interim president must be named and new elections called.|$|E
50|$|While many <b>presidents</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> {{formally}} join {{a church}} until quite late in life, {{there is a}} genre of tales of deathbed conversions. Biographers usually doubt these, though the baptism of James K. Polk is well documented.|$|R
5000|$|For the 2015 gala performance, <b>President</b> Barack Obama <b>did</b> attend, after {{addressing}} {{the nation in}} a live telecast.

25|$|Among {{the many}} types of {{republic}}, the Kemalist republic is a representative democracy with a Parliament chosen in general elections, a President as head of state elected by Parliament and serving for a limited term, a Prime Minister appointed by the President, and other Ministers appointed by Parliament. The Kemalist <b>President</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> have direct executive powers, but has limited veto powers, {{and the right to}} contest with referendum. The day-to-day operation of government {{is the responsibility of the}} Council of Ministers formed by the Prime Minister and the other Ministers. There is a separation of powers between the executive (President and Council of Ministers), the legislative (Parliament) and the judiciary, in which no one branch of government has authority over another–although parliament is charged with the supervision of the Council of Ministers, which can be compelled to resign by a vote of no-confidence.|$|E
500|$|The Presidential Palace ( [...] , also {{referred}} to by the metonym Pantovčak) in Zagreb is the official workplace of the president. The <b>president</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> actually live in the building, as it is used as the Office of the President of Croatia {{rather than as a}} residence. The structure covers [...] It had been used as the official residence since then-president Franjo Tuđman moved there following the October 1991 bombing of Banski dvori. In addition to the original building, there is also an [...] annex built in 1993, an ancillary structure housing office security services and a bomb shelter predating the 1990s. The building, formerly known as Villa Zagorje or Tito's Villa, was designed by architects Vjenceslav Richter and Kazimir Ostrogović and completed in 1964 for the former Yugoslav president Josip Broz Tito.|$|E

Even though the <b>president</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> support the lyrics in question, he believed that some reports were distorting what Mr. Lynn stands for more broadly. Common gave a single line response to the entire controversy: [...] "I guess Sarah Palin and Fox News doesn't like me." ...|$|E

50|$|In August 2014, President Benigno Aquino III was {{urged by}} LPGMA Partylist Representative Arnel Ty to observe DST from November 2014 to January 2015 and March to June 2015 {{to prepare for}} the power crisis in the country but the <b>President</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> {{implement}} the DST.|$|R
2500|$|Most of the {{arguments}} that the <b>President</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> possess soft power stem from a strict interpretation of the Constitution and what are regarded as the traditional roles of the President. First, unless the Constitution states otherwise, the default position is that when exercising his functions the President has to act according to {{the advice of the}} Cabinet. In the context of the Constitution, the word advice does not carry its typical meaning of mere opinion or suggestion. The President is obliged to follow the Cabinet's advice. Thus, the <b>President</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> have any liberty to exercise soft power. Furthermore, {{it has been argued that}} since the President is elected to exercise the powers defined in the Constitution, the concept of [...] "political legitimacy" [...] posited by proponents would appear to be undermined by soft power, which has an unspecified and ambiguous scope.|$|E
2500|$|... "Guidance Patrols" [...] (gasht-e ershâd) — often {{referred}} to as [...] "religious police" [...] in Western media – enforce Islamic moral values and dress codes. Reformist politicians have criticized the unpopular patrols but the patrols ‘interminable’ according to Iranian judicial authorities who have pointed out that in the Islamic Republic the <b>president</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> have control over the enforcement of dress codes.|$|E
2500|$|Mohsen Sazegara, {{who was a}} {{high-ranking}} Tehran official before turning against the government, has argued that Ahmadinejad does not control the Guards outside of Iran. [...] "Not only the foreign ministry of Iran; even the <b>president</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> know what the Revolutionary Guards does outside of Iran. They directly report to the leader", he said, referring to Grand Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Although Ali Khamenei is the ultimate person {{in charge of the}} Quds Force, George Bush did not mention him. According to Richard Clarke, [...] "Quds force reports directly to the Supreme Ayatollah, through the commander-in-chief of the revolutionary guards." ...|$|E
50|$|In 1974, Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, {{seeking to}} amend Article 25 of the Constitution {{to make the}} rules of the dual office holding between a {{parliamentary}} office and functions of government.

50|$|Example 4: If the U.S. Congress {{passes a}} bill, the president's {{signature}} of the bill is sufficient to make it law. Note that the case whereby the <b>president</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> sign the bill, e.g. through exercising a presidential veto, <b>does</b> <b>not</b> mean that the bill has not become law (it could still have become law through a congressional override).|$|R
2500|$|In {{the largest}} Latter Day Saint denomination, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), bishops are called {{from among the}} members of a local congregation, known as a ward, and {{traditionally}} serve, without pay, for four to seven years (the length of service varies). A bishop must be a married high priest in the Melchizedek priesthood. The bishop acts as the presiding high priest of the ward. A bishop simultaneously serves {{as the president of the}} Aaronic priesthood and president of the priests quorum in the ward. In a branch, the branch president fulfills the same functions as a bishop; however, a branch <b>president</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> need to be a high priest.|$|E
2500|$|If {{the posts}} {{are not to}} be combined, some believe that the dual-presidential system could lead to [...] "cohabitation" [...] and infighting between the two offices. While it is {{comparable}} to the French model, where there is a President (the European Council president) and Prime Minister (the Commission President), the Council <b>president</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> hold formal powers such as the ability to directly appoint and sack the Commission President, or the ability to dissolve Parliament. Hence while the European Council president may have prestige, he/she lacks power and while the Commission President has power, he/she lacks the prestige of the former. Some believe this problem would be increased further if the Council president were to be strengthened by a democratic mandate, as mentioned above.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the first}} debate, held on RTÉ Radio 1's News at One, {{independent}} candidate Scallon explained she had delayed her {{entry into the}} race due to numerous family bereavements.

I have the knowledge and experience to be able to protect our sovereignty and that's the only question I think that's really urgent at this time." [...] When asked by Ryan Tubridy if she would refuse to sign any bill threatening , she responded by saying, [...] "You bet your boots I would". In fact, the <b>President</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> have such a veto power, being able only to refer a Bill to the Council of State for its consideration.|$|E
