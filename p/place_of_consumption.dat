6000|$|The Genius of {{our life}} is jealous of {{individual}}s, and will not have any individual great, except through the general. There is no choice to genius. A great man does not wake up on some fine morning, and say, [...] "I am full of life, I will go to sea, and find an Antarctic continent: to-day I will square the circle: I will ransack botany, and find a new food for man: I have a new architecture in my mind: I foresee a new mechanic power;" [...] no, but he finds himself in the river of the thoughts and events, forced onward by the ideas and necessities of his contemporaries. He stands where all the eyes of men look one way, and their hands all point in {{the direction in which}} he should go. The church has reared him amidst rites and pomps, and he carries out the advice which her music gave him, and builds a cathedral needed by her chants and processions. He finds a war raging: it educates him by trumpet, in barracks, and he betters the instruction. He finds two counties groping to bring coal, or flour, or fish, from the place of production to the <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>consumption,</b> and he hits on a railroad. Every master has found his materials collected, and his power lay in his sympathy with his people, and in his love of the materials he wrought in. What an economy of power! and what a compensation for the shortness of life! All is done to his hand. The world has brought him thus far on his way. The human race has gone out before him, sunk the hills, filled the hollows, and bridged the rivers. Men, nations, poets, artisans, women, all have worked for him, and he enters into their labors. Choose any other thing, out of the line of tendency, out of the national feeling and history, and he would have all to do for himself: his powers would be expended in the first preparations. Great genial power, one would almost say, consists in not being original at all; in being altogether receptive; in letting the world do all, and suffering the spirit of the hour to pass unobstructed through the mind.|$|E

40|$|Leisure time, leisure activities, {{and leisure}} spaces largely {{surround}} matters <b>of</b> <b>consumption.</b> However, the role consumption {{plays in the}} reproduction and performance of community is a necessarily contested topic among leisure scholars. For their part, leisure scholars have tended to regard <b>consumption</b> and <b>places</b> <b>of</b> <b>consumption</b> {{with a great deal}} of trepidation, skepticism, and even contempt (e. g., Arai & Pedlar, 2003; Hemingway, 1996; Reid, 1995; Stormann, 2000). Implications for and about community appear to be at the forefront <b>of</b> anxiety about <b>consumption</b> as it relates to leisure. As a result, a focus on “community” has become a practical response to assumptions about pervasive individualism, consumption, and the loss of community, in general. Following calls for the incorporation of community in leisure studies (Arai & Pedlar, 2003; Glover & Stewart, 2006) and drawing on Cook’s (2006 a) call to move leisure studies “beyond individualism” (p. 464), this study sought to empirically examine the significance local residents attribute to everyday <b>places</b> <b>of</b> <b>consumption.</b> Furthermore, this study aimed to challenge the idea that leisure time, activities, places, and spaces based on consumption serve only to further alienate individuals from communities, thus weakening the social relevance of leisure, in general (Arai & Pedlar, 2003). The purpose of this research, therefore, was to challenge the essentialist conceptualization <b>of</b> <b>consumption</b> by exploring the relationship between <b>places</b> <b>of</b> <b>consumption</b> and the everyday lived experience of community. To do so, I engaged patrons at the Kitchener Market, a venue that encourages consumptive acts, yet serves as a focal point for everyday engagement in community. The primary research question providing focus for this study was: What roles, if any, do <b>places</b> <b>of</b> <b>consumption,</b> particularly third <b>places,</b> play in the everyday lived experience of community? 	Results of this research suggest there are new ways for understanding leisure and community as they relate to consumption. Rather than considering <b>consumption</b> <b>places</b> as points <b>of</b> exchange with little or no emotional sentiment attached, this research suggests these places have to potential to develop and create community as well as incorporate consumer values, ideals, ethics, and sentiments. Third places, as everyday <b>places</b> <b>of</b> <b>consumption,</b> should be examined for their potential to create, enact, and build community. Consumption is not separate from society, community and leisure; rather, consumption constitutes a salient aspect of everyday living and should be considered an important component of community...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to characterise {{substantial}} out-of-home (SOH) eaters, describe the nutritional quality of their diet, compare SOH eaters and non-SOH eaters for a set of nutritional indicators and evaluate the quality of meals consumed at home and at different places outside the home. Information on food intake was collected with two 24 h recalls. Habitual food intake was estimated by the Nusser method. Non-dietary variables were obtained using a face-to-face questionnaire. SOH eaters were defined as individuals who consume at least 25 % of their daily energy out of home. A representative sample (it 3245) of the Belgian population aged 15 years and older was randomly selected from the National Register using a multi-stage stratified procedure. Of the Belgian population, 35. 2 % were defined as SOH eaters. Energy intake, energy density of the total diet and daily <b>consumption</b> <b>of</b> most food groups, except for fruits and vegetables, were substantially higher among SOH eaters compared with non-SOH eaters.
