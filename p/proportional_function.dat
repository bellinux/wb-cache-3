This research analyzed {{the accuracy of}} five continuous freight rate functions used to model freight rates: (1) a constant, (2) a proportional, (3) an adjusted inverse, (4) an exponential, and (5) a logarithmic. ^ Two types of problems were considered in this randomized experiment: (1) freight rate function and (2) inventory-theoretic. First, the best-fit parameters for each freight rate function were determined in the freight rate function problems. Best-fit parameters minimized the mean square difference between actual and approximated freight rates for a given combination of route, class, and discount. Second, the mean of each parameter was used in its respective function to approximate freight rates. Third, a regression equation was developed to predict the parameter value for each function. Each predicted parameter value was used in its respective function to approximate freight rates. Actual less-than-truckload and truckload freight rates were obtained for 2, 228 routes spanning the United States; for discounts of 20, 30, 40, and 50 %; and for class 60, 65, 70, and 77. 5. ^ In the inventory-theoretic problems, optimal order quantities and annual logistics costs were determined when using actual and approximated freight rates.

Randomly generated variables in each inventory-theoretic problem included: route, class, discount, unit weight, annual requirements, carrying cost rate, unit value, and order cost. ^ This research found that the <b>proportional</b> <b>function</b> was the most accurate in the freight rate function problems, followed by the exponential, adjusted inverse, constant, and logarithmic functions, respectively.

40|$|Based on data {{observed}} at the 12 small watersheds in hilly {{areas of the}} Loess Plateau, North China, the relationship between event runoff volume and sediment yield is examined. The results reveal that the runoff-sediment yield relationship at the inter-event timescale is mainly determined by the runoff-sediment concentration relationship at the intra-event timescale. In the study area, the sediment concentration tends to be stable when the flow discharge exceeds a certain critical value. Many factors that are important for determining the characteristics of low-magnitude events, such as flow discharge, particle size of fluvial sediment, and accumulation of loose material on land surfaces prior to a rainstorm, appear to have little importance for high-magnitude events. Consequently, mean sediment concentration tends to be stable for large flood events, suggesting a strong similarity between the two flow-sediment relationships at inter-and intra-event temporal scales. Furthermore, a <b>proportional</b> <b>function</b> is proposed to predict event sediment yield, and the correspondence between the predicted and observed sediment yields is examined. The performance of the model is good for high-magnitude events, especially extreme events. The applicability of the proposed model at the annual timescale is also discussed.

30|$|The {{proposed}} algorithm can {{be implemented}} in a centralized or distributed manner. Here, we employ a hybrid distributed-centralized manner to select the best link. This {{is due to the}} fact that determining weight fact W requires the statistical channel state information (CSI) of all links. At the same time, in practical communication systems, the distributed manner is preferable for the selection of the best link, especially in the case where the number of contention links is very large. For such hybrid manner, before each time slot, each relay transmits the statistical CSI to the central controller, which can be obtained by listening pilot signals from source and destination. After receiving the statistical CSI from all relays, the central controller performs the algorithm given in Table  4 and broadcasts the result to all relays. Upon receiving the signal from central controller, each relay then starts a timer by jointly considering the buffer sates and its input (S-R) and output (R-D) link strength as well as the weight factor W obtained from central controller. The duration of timer is a <b>proportional</b> <b>function</b> that depends on the weight factor W and S-R or R-D link strength. As a result, the best link can be selected.|$|E
40|$|Background. Most {{positive}} inotropic agents increase cardiac contractility {{by increasing}} the amount of Ca 2 cycled with each beat. The additional amount of oxygen that is consumed by the heart to cycle this additional Ca 2 ' is believed to reduce myocardial efficiency. On the other hand, {{it has been suggested that}} the agent EMD- 53998 increases the Ca 2 ' sensitivity of the contractile proteins without affecting the intracellular Ca 2 + transient in cardiac muscle. Therefore, application of this agent may increase cardiac contractility without decreasing myocardial efficiency. The purpose of the present study was to test this hypothesis. Methods and Results. We measured myocardial oxygen consumption (MVo 2) in six isolated, isovolumi-cally beating blood-perfused canine hearts. The hearts were paced at 120 beats per minute. Contractility was varied in each heart by infusion of either CaCI 2 or EMD- 53998. With infusion of either agent, MVo 2 was a linearly <b>proportional</b> <b>function</b> of contractility. No significant difference between CaCI 2 and EMD- 53998 could be detected in the interrelation between contractility and MVo 2. Conclusions. We conclude that the "calcium-sensitizing agent " EMD- 53998 is a potent positive inotropic agent in the isolated, blood-perfused canine heart. However, EMD- 53998 does not provide an energetic advantage over currently used positive inotropic agents. (Circua"tion 1992; 86 : 1945 - 1954...|$|E
40|$|A <b>proportional</b> hazard <b>function</b> {{together}} with partial likelihood estimation {{is the most}} common approach to the analysis of censored data. However, partial likelihood estimation is established {{on the grounds that the}} censoring is non-informative. The partial likelihood approach enjoys many good properties when the censoring is indeed non-informative. However, in reality, censoring can be informative. One pays a price in the efficiency of the estimator if partial likelihood estimation is used when the censoring is indeed informative. This problem is particularly acute in the nonparametric case. When censoring is informative, to make use of the information provided by the censoring times, it is better to take the local complete likelihood approach. Motivated by the data set about the first birth interval in Bangladesh, we propose here a varying-coefficient <b>proportional</b> hazard <b>function</b> to fit informatively censored data. We take the complete likelihood approach coupled with local linear modelling to estimate the functional coefficients involved in the model. Asymptotic properties of the proposed estimator are established, that show the proposed estimator is indeed more efficient than the maximum local partial likelihood estimator. A simulation study was conducted to demonstrate how much the proposed estimator improves the efficiency of the maximum local partial likelihood estimator when sample size is finite. In reality, we do not know whether censoring is informative or not, and a cross-validation based criterion is proposed to check whether the censoring is informative or not.

40|$|The {{relation}} between runoff volume and sediment yield for individual {{events in a}} given watershed receives little attention compared to the {{relation between}} water discharge and sediment yield, though it may underlie the event-based sediment-yield model for large-size watershed. The data observed at 12 experimental subwatersheds in the Dalihe river watershed in hilly areas of Loess Plateau, North China, was selected to develop and validate the relation. The peak flow is often considered as an important factor affecting event sediment yield. However, in the study areas, sediment concentration remains relatively constant when water discharge exceeds a certain critical value, implying that the heavier flow is not accompanied with the higher sediment transport capacity. Hence, only the runoff volume factor was considered in the sediment-yield model. As both the total sediment and runoff discharge were largely produced during the heavy-discharge stage, and the sediment concentration was negligibly variable during this stage, a <b>proportional</b> <b>function</b> {{can be used to}} model the relation between event runoff volume and sediment yield for a given subwatershed.

40|$|The spatio-temporal {{variation}} underlies and complicates studies {{related to}} earth surface processes. Subsequent to our previous studies reporting the temporal invariability of sediment concentration, this study further reports the spatial invariability of sediment concentration or the flow-sediment {{relationship in the}} hilly part of the Chinese Loess Plateau. The dense channel network dissects this area into numerous sub-watersheds, which are composed of entire slopes (a combination of the hill slope and the valley side slope). Our data mainly involves ten experimental sites of entire slope and sub-watershed and 580 flood events at three locations. Our analysis at the intra-event time scale shows that the instantaneous sediment concentrations in runoff can generally approach the detach-limited maximum sediment concentration since the active massing wasting ensures an abundant sediment supply. Consequently, the event mean sediment concentration does not only remain fairly constant among flow events but also among the experimental sites despite the possible differences in topography, soil management or land cover, water source, soil surface properties, etc. This observation also holds at the annual time scale. Our result implies that a single <b>proportional</b> <b>function</b> is adequate to fit the flow-sediment relationship for any entire slope or sub-watershed, where eroded sediments are primarily sourced, over a considerable areal extent unless soil property has changed or check dams are installed. Moreover, the proportionality coefficient, which {{is indicative of the}} maximum detachment capacity, can be approximated through flume experiments rather than necessarily through long-term field observations.

40|$|Little {{information}} {{is available on the}} scale behavior of the flow-sediment relationship despite numerous studies on the scale behavior of sediment yield. Based on data observed at 19 gauging stations and 10 runoff experimental plots, we examined the flow-sediment relationship in the context of spatio-temporal scales for hilly loess areas, China. Distinct from many rivers around the world, sediment concentration in runoff is totally independent of flow discharge at any spatial scale for hilly loess areas. At the intra-event timescale, the relationship between flow discharge and sediment discharge can be well fitted by a <b>proportional</b> <b>function</b> especially at the entire slope (a combination of the hill slope and the channel side slope) and the larger scale. At the inter-event timescale, the variability of mean sediment concentration for a single runoff event decreases dramatically with increasing spatial scale. Accordingly, the proportional model of event runoff volume and sediment yield proposed in Zheng et al. (2007 a and 2008) is applicable over a wide range of spatial scales from the hill slope to the large-sized watershed (up to 110, 000 km(2)). Both proportional models of the intra- and inter-event timescales are corroborated by the nonlinear regression technique, which yields a power fit with an exponent extremely close to 1. In a fully physical sense, however, the runoff-sediment yield relationship at the watershed scale should be linear with a negligible constant term due to the presence of base flow. At the annual timescale, the relationship between annual runoff volume and annual sediment yield at the watershed scale becomes linear with an indispensable constant term due to the higher proportion of base flow. The widely used power function is inappropriate for fitting the flow-sediment relationship in hilly loess areas at any spatio-temporal scales we examined. A comparable result was also obtained for the Walnut Gulch Experimental watershed of USA, suggesting that the proportional model may be universal for regions where sediment supply is sufficiently available.
