40|$|The study {{examined}} how communication elements and relational norms such as power asymmetry influence relationship quality {{from the perspective}} of grape growers in their relationships with wineries using an integrated model {{of the relationship between the}} two actors (grape grower and winery) in the Australian wine industry. First, a review of the literature identified a deficiency of research examining communication between grape growers and wineries and the effect that power asymmetry has on relationship quality. The literature review also identified that relationship quality is measured both uni-dimensionally and multi-dimensionally. Second, a qualitative exploratory study, involving in-depth interviews with grape growers, examined how dimensionality of collaborative communication and power asymmetry in the relationship (favouring the winery) influenced relationship quality. Furthermore, the elements of collaborative communication were found to influence the relationship quality, in particular the modality, formality, directionality and the non-coercive abilities of communication. The exploratory study, combined with the literature review, created a conceptual model based on a multidimensional measurement of relationship quality and an alternative conceptual model based on a uni-dimensional measurement. Finally, the study involved a questionnaire administered to grape growers to test quantitatively the conceptual models. The conceptual models were tested via Structural Equation Modelling using Partial Least Squares Regression. The main results showed that direct modes of communication (for example, face to face and direct email communication) positively affected relationship quality, while non-direct modes (such as seminars and newsletter) negatively affected relationship quality, and that the power asymmetry led to decreased grape prices and lower relationship quality. The linkages in the main conceptual model between satisfaction (an element of relationship quality), and many of the relational dimensions, were insignificant. The reason for this was due to the <b>price</b> <b>per</b> <b>tonne</b> that the grape growers received for their produce (grapes). The estimation of the alternative model, based on a uni-dimensional estimation of relationship quality, showed a greater fit of the data with less significant path estimations. Further analysis of the models showed a direct correlation between the relationship quality and price of grape supplied, whereby the higher the price they received, the higher the level of relationship quality they experienced. The quantitative phase of the study also highlighted three clusters of respondents' relationships with wineries. Firstly, there was an “unsustainable relationship”, whereby the respondents experienced low levels of relationship quality, high power asymmetry favouring the winery, and a very low <b>price</b> <b>per</b> <b>tonne</b> for their grapes. Respondents in this cluster were mainly located in warm climate grape growing regions, and mainly dealt with large, publicly owned wineries. Secondly, an “OK relationship” was observed, whereby respondents experienced higher levels of relationship quality and lower high power asymmetry favouring the winery than the “unsustainable relationship” cluster. They received a higher <b>price</b> <b>per</b> <b>tonne</b> than the “unsustainable relationship‟ cluster, were located in cool to warm climate grape growing regions, and dealt with more small, privately owned wineries than the “unsustainable relationship” cluster. Thirdly, there was a “good relationship”, whereby respondents experienced the highest level of relationship quality and the least amount of power asymmetry favouring the winery, of the three clusters. This cluster also received the highest <b>price</b> <b>per</b> <b>tonne</b> of the three clusters and was mostly located in cool climate wine growing regions. This cluster dealt with more small, privately owned wineries than the other two clusters. Wineries will need to take into consideration the results of this study, particularly the dimensionality of communication and power asymmetry effects, when dealing with grape growers. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|Future {{climate change}} is {{expected}} to affect inland waterway transport in most main natural waterways in Europe. For the river Rhine it is expected that, in summer, more and longer periods with low water levels will occur. In periods of low water levels inland waterway vessels have to reduce their load factors and, as a result, transport <b>prices</b> <b>per</b> <b>tonne</b> will increase. One possible consequence of these higher transport prices is a deterioration of the competitive position of inland waterway transport compared with rail and road transport, and thus a change in modal split. We study this issue using a GIS-based software model called NODUS which provides a tool for the detailed analysis of freight transportation over extensive multimodal networks. We assess the effect of low water levels on the costs of transport operations for inland waterway transport in North West Europe under several climate scenarios. It turns out, that {{the effect on the}} modal split is limited.

40|$|According to {{economic}} theory, imbalances in trade flows affect transport prices, because (some) carriers {{have to return}} without cargo from the low-demand region to the high-demand region. Therefore, transport prices in the high-demand direction have to exceed those in the low-demand direction. This implies that transport costs, and therefore trade costs, are fundamentally endogenous with respect to trade imbalances. We study the effect of an imbalance in trade flows on transport prices using micro-data on trips made by carriers in the inland waterway network in North West Europe. We find that imbalances in trade flows have substantial effects on transport prices. We estimate that a one standard deviation increase in the region's trade imbalance (the ratio of export and import cargo flows) increases the transport <b>price</b> <b>per</b> <b>tonne</b> of trips departing from this region by about 7 %. © The Author (2010).

40|$|Future climate {{conditions}} {{are likely to}} affect inland waterway transport in Europe. According to some climate scenarios, in summer, in the river Rhine, periods with low water levels are likely to occur more often and become more serious. Then inland waterway transport carriers will experience more severe restrictions on the load factor of their inland ships, which implies a stronger reduction in transport capacity in the market. Transport prices will rise under such conditions. Some studies reviewed in this paper find that at extremely low water levels, the <b>price</b> <b>per</b> <b>tonne</b> for inland waterway transport in the river Rhine area will almost double. These increased transport prices result in welfare losses. For the dry summer in 2003, the losses for North West Europe are estimated to sum up to around € 480 million. Increased transport prices trigger adaptation. Inland waterway carriers may use smaller vessels, and shippers {{have the opportunity to}} shift from inland waterway transport to alternative transport modes in periods with low water levels.

The C sequestration potential of rice–wheat systems of India on conversion to no-tillage {{is estimated to be}} 44. 1 Mt C over 20 years.

The economic analysis was summarized as carbon supply curves expressing the total additional C accumulated over 20 year for a <b>price</b> <b>per</b> <b>tonne</b> of carbon sequestered ranging from zero to USD 200.

40|$|Payment for Ecosystem Services (PES) schemes are proliferating but are {{challenged}} by insufficient attention to {{spatial and temporal}} inter-dependencies, interactions between different ecosystems and their services, {{and the need for}} multi-level governance. To address these challenges, this paper develops a place-based approach to {{the development and implementation of}} PES schemes that incorporates multi-level governance, bundling or layering of services across multiple scales, and shared values for ecosystem services. The approach is evaluated and illustrated using case study research to develop an explicitly place-based PES scheme, the Peatland Code, owned and managed by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature’s UK Peatland Programme and designed to pay for restoration of peatland habitats. Buyers preferred bundled schemes with premium pricing of a primary service, contrasting with sellers’ preferences for quantifying and marketing services separately in a layered scheme. There was limited awareness among key business sectors of dependencies on ecosystem services, or the risks and opportunities arising from their management. Companies with financial links to peatlands or a strong environmental sustainability focus were interested in the scheme, particularly in relation to climate regulation, water quality, biodiversity and flood risk mitigation benefits. Visitors were most interested in donating to projects that benefited wildlife and were willing to donate around £ 2 on-site during a visit. Sellers agreed a deliberated fair <b>price</b> <b>per</b> <b>tonne</b> of CO 2 equivalent from £ 11. 18 to £ 15. 65 across four sites in Scotland, with this range primarily driven by spatial variation in habitat degradation. In the Peak District, perceived declines in sheep and grouse productivity arising from ditch blocking led to substantially higher prices, but in other regions ditch blocking was viewed more positively. The Peatland Code was developed in close collaboration with stakeholders at catchment, landscape and national scales, enabling multi-level governance of the management and delivery of ecosystem services across these scales. Place-based PES schemes can mitigate negative trade-offs between ecosystem services, more effectively include cultural ecosystem services and engage with and empower diverse stakeholders in scheme design and governance...|$|E

Unfortunately, for many developing countries, {{this has not been}} the case; upon significantly reducing their tariffs, they are yet to see any tangible benefits. On the contrary, they have experienced a decline in market share and in some instances significant erosion of trade preferences that they had previously enjoyed with their trading partners. The preferential market access, from which Jamaica and other ACP (African Caribbean and Pacific) states benefit, through exports of sugar and bananas to the EU (European Union), has been eroded as a result of recent rulings by the WTO. These rulings have already affected the banana industry severely; resulting in loss of jobs, reduction in foreign exchange earnings and area planted in bananas. The sugar industry is expected to be similarly affected with the pending phased reduction in the <b>price</b> <b>per</b> <b>tonne,</b> which the EU proposes to pay ACP sugar producers. In light of the above, there is on-going search for non-traditional commodities with good export potential and the ability to compete in the international market place. Ackee is a non-traditional crop that is considered to have excellent foreign exchange earning potential. This paper will examine the prospect of expanding the volume of ackees exported, particularly to the US market. It will also discuss the health concerns associated with the consumption of the fruit, as well as present scientific evidence to allay food safety concerns associated with it. Finally a policy analysis matrix (PAM) approach was used to assess the comparative advantage of ackee, relative to sugar and bananas. The results of the PAM indicate that whilst sugar cane and bananas enjoy some comparative advantage, ackee uses locally resources most efficiently. This suggests that some of the resources that are currently being employed in the production of sugar cane and bananas could probably be more efficiently employed in the production of ackees.
