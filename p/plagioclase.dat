5|$|Little Ring Mountain at the {{northern}} end of the field contains at least 70% brown volcanic glass with isolated phenocrysts of <b>plagioclase.</b> Vesicular textures are up to 5%, suggesting that the lava erupted subaerially. Probable xenocrysts of quartz have been identified at the volcano. At least one xenolith fragment has been found in loose rubble at the volcano and included several quartz xenocrysts and polycrystalline quartz xenoliths in a glassy matrix with trachytic <b>plagioclase.</b>|$|E
5|$|Spectra {{taken of}} this crater during the Clementine mission {{were used to}} perform mineral mapping. The data {{indicated}} that the central peak {{is a type of}} rock called anorthosite, which is a slow-cooling form of igneous rock composed of <b>plagioclase</b> feldspar. By contrast the outer wall is troctolite, a rock composed of equal parts <b>plagioclase</b> and olivine.|$|E
5|$|The {{andesite}} lava of Ember Ridge comprises 55% brownish-green {{volcanic glass}} with a trachytic matrix of <b>plagioclase.</b> About 35% of Ember Ridge andesite contains phenocrysts of hornblende, augite, <b>plagioclase</b> and orthopyroxene and exist as isolated crystals and clots. A feature south of Ember Ridge, unofficially known as Betty's Bump, comprises andesite with phenocrysts of <b>plagioclase,</b> augite and olivine. Dark brown volcanic glass composes the Betty's Bump andesite {{as much as}} 20%. The relationship of Betty's Bump with Ember Ridge is unclear but it likely represents a separate volcanic feature due to its topographic isolation.|$|E
5|$|The predominate rock type is a white, coarse-grained, foliated {{hornblende}} tonalite. Minerals in the tonalite are quartz, <b>plagioclase,</b> alkali feldspar and hornblende.|$|E
5|$|Licancabur has erupted {{primarily}} andesite, but basaltic andesite and dacite {{have also}} been found. The rocks are dark and grey-coloured. Basaltic andesite {{was found in the}} older lavas, and dacite in the more-recent ones. Although the rocks have a seriate texture, the groundmass is hyalopilitic. Phenocrysts include amphibole, clinopyroxene, hornblende, orthopyroxene, <b>plagioclase</b> and titanomagnetite; olivine is found in andesite, and biotite in dacites. <b>Plagioclase</b> is the most common. The amount of phenocrysts in Licancabur's rocks is smaller than that in other Central Volcanic Zone volcanoes, such as Lascar.|$|E
5|$|Phenocrysts include <b>plagioclase</b> in {{andesite}} {{with smaller}} amounts of amphibole, biotite, clinopyroxene, and orthopyroxene. Apatite and zircon form accessory minerals. Dacites have similar composition but also contain hornblende. Olivine {{is found in}} the andesites and quartz in the dacites.|$|E
5|$|The {{composition}} of the rocks ranges from basaltic andesite to andesite. Phenocrysts contained in Mentolat's rocks include: clinopyroxene, olivine, orthopyroxene and <b>plagioclase.</b> Mentolat tephras have noticeably lower potassium contents than the tephras of other volcanoes in the region.|$|E
5|$|The {{principal}} rock is dacite, rich in potassium. The rocks have a porphyric {{appearance and}} contain few vesicles. They {{are also very}} rich in crystals, with the dominant phenocryst-forming minerals being biotite, hornblende and <b>plagioclase.</b> Less important are allanite, apatite, clinopyroxene, olivine, orthopyroxene, quartz, sphene and zircon. The groundmass contains <b>plagioclase,</b> pyroxene, silicon dioxide and oxides of iron and titanium. The composition of Ciomadul's rocks has been fairly constant throughout its evolution, and this diversity of its components indicate that the genesis of Ciomadul magmas involved mixing between felsic and mafic magma.|$|E
5|$|The rocks contain phenocrysts of clinopyroxene, {{hornblende}} and <b>plagioclase.</b> In {{terms of}} composition, the Fueguino rocks {{belong to the}} calc-alkaline series and resemble tholeiites and andesites from primitive volcanic arcs. Xenoliths from the Patagonian batholith are also found.|$|E
5|$|There are {{two large}} lava valleys on the island's {{southwest}} side which are u-shaped. The oldest of these flows are of Pleistocene age composed of basaltic trachyandesite and basaltic andesite, with smaller amounts of <b>plagioclase,</b> clinopyroxene, olivine, and hornblende.|$|E
5|$|Andesite at Slag Hill {{consists}} of 70% dark brown volcanic glass with varied degrees of trachytic texture in the plagioclastic matrix {{and less than}} 5% of the andesite comprises vesicular textures. <b>Plagioclase,</b> hornblende and augite are mostly in form as phenocrysts and comprise 1% to 10% of the andesite. Orthoclase crystals are found occasionally and they likely represent xenocrysts.|$|E
5|$|At Ring Mountain, {{andesite}} comprises 70% brown {{volcanic glass}} and vesicular textures {{as much as}} 15%. The plagioclastic matrix is trachytic. Augite, biotite, <b>plagioclase</b> and hornblende occur as microphenocrysts and comprise 1% to 7% of the andesite. Small qualities of quartz are common and occur as microxenocrysts. Microxenocrysts of orthoclase likely exist in andesite at Ring Mountain.|$|E
5|$|Crystallization of this {{magma ocean}} {{would have created}} a mafic mantle from the {{precipitation}} and sinking of the minerals olivine, clinopyroxene, and orthopyroxene; after about three-quarters of the magma ocean had crystallised, lower-density <b>plagioclase</b> minerals could form and float into a crust atop. The final liquids to crystallise would have been initially sandwiched between the crust and mantle, with a high abundance of incompatible and heat-producing elements.|$|E
5|$|The lighter-coloured {{regions of}} the Moon are called terrae, or more {{commonly}} highlands, because they are higher than most maria. They have been radiometrically dated to having formed 4.4billion years ago, and may represent <b>plagioclase</b> cumulates of the lunar magma ocean. In contrast to Earth, no major lunar mountains {{are believed to have}} formed as a result of tectonic events.|$|E
5|$|Troctolite 76535, a {{coarse-grained}} troctolite composed {{primarily of}} olivine and <b>plagioclase</b> was recovered {{in the valley}} {{as part of a}} rake sample. The sample has been called the most interesting to be returned from the Moon. This sample {{has been the subject of}} thermochronological calculations in order to determine whether the Moon ever generated a core dynamo or formed a metallic core.|$|E
5|$|Tufa {{deposits}} {{formed in}} the lake. The continental environment Pleistocene sediments were formed from lacustrine carbonate deposits. These rocks contain amphibole, clay minerals such as illite, kaolinite and smectite, feldspar, <b>plagioclase,</b> potassium feldspar, pyroxene and quartz. The composition of these rocks resembles that of the Altiplano soils.|$|E
5|$|Calabozos {{lies between}} two {{different}} types of volcanism—to its north, andesite and rhyolite are the primary constituents of lava while its southern neighbors are composed of more mafic andesite and basalt. It is mainly basaltic andesite and rhyodacite that make up Calabozos, forming a calcalkilic suite rich with potassium. Its lavas are dotted with phenocrysts, which vary from 2 to 25percent of their mass. These phenocrysts are typically made of <b>plagioclase,</b> but also contain clinopyroxene, orthopyroxene, ilmenite, apatite, and titanomagnetite.|$|E
5|$|Petrographically, the {{composition}} of the cluster ranges from andesite to dacite with SiO2 ranging from 62.8% to 65.7%. Andesites appear as lava flows while dacites form lava domes and dome complexes. The rocks from the main Aucanquilcha volcano are uniformly dacitic and show little evidence of temporal variation in their composition. Potassium content ranges from 1.5 to 4%. <b>Plagioclase</b> is the dominant component of the magma. Clinopyroxene+orthopyroxene+amphibole (hornblende and pargasite) or amphibole+biotite+minor amounts of pyroxene are subordinate components. Apatite, ilmenite, magnetite and zircon can also be found. There is evidence of magma mixing and mingling.|$|E
5|$|The dacite volcanics {{composing}} Mount Fee contain brown {{volcanic glass}} {{as much as}} 70% and vesicular textures as much as 15%. About 25% of the volcanics contain crystal content, including <b>plagioclase,</b> hornblende, orthopyroxene, orthoclase and sporadic quartz. The orthoclase crystals are interpreted to represent rock fragments that became enveloped during hardening of the dacitic lavas. A portion of the southwestern flank of Mount Fee comprises no volcanic glass, but rather composed of an abnormal cryptocrystalline matrix. This indicates {{that it might have}} developed as part of a subvolcanic intrusion.|$|E
5|$|The flank vents have erupted {{andesite}} and dacite, {{belonging to}} a potassium-poor calcalkaline series. Such a limited range of composition is typical for these volcanoes but might reflect {{the small amount of}} research conducted on them. Tephras of rhyolitic composition were generated by Monte Burney during the Pleistocene, according to compositional data. Holocene eruptions have near-identical composition. Minerals found in Burney rocks include amphibole, <b>plagioclase</b> and pyroxene; foreign components include clinopyroxene and olivine crystals as well as granite xenoliths stemming from the Patagonian batholith.|$|E
5|$|The rocks {{follow the}} calc-alkaline trend of magmatic differentiation, {{containing}} silicic lavas such as dacite. Their overall composition ranges from basaltic andesite to dacite, and the dominant lava rocks are andesite and basalt. Andesites range from green to gray in colour, and dacites are pink- and light-gray. The andesitic lavas contain phenocrysts of andesine, hornblende, <b>plagioclase</b> and hypersthene. Dacites have biotite, hornblende, <b>plagioclase</b> and quartz phenocrysts. Textures range from porphyritic to vitreophyritic. Andesites {{are more common}} in Pliocene rocks, and Pleistocene rocks tend to be dacitic. At least five cycles of andesite rock formation have been found on the southwest side of Koh-i-Sultan. Its rocks are typical volcanic-arc rocks in elemental chemistry, and may stem from mantle-derived magma. The satellite centre rocks differ from the main centre rocks in composition, suggesting that different processes generated the magmas which constructed the cones. There is a compositional trend from Bazman over Taftan to Sultan, with the latter having more potassium in its rocks than the other centres. Such compositional trends may come from different partial melting ratios and different fluid contributions to magma generation at each volcano.|$|E
5|$|Evidence {{from the}} Apollo 17 mission {{shows that the}} massifs {{surrounding}} the valley are composed primarily of feldspar-rich breccia and that basalt underlies the valley floor, {{a result of the}} lava flows during the valley's history. Seismic studies suggest that the basalt below the valley floor is about 1400 metres (4593.2feet) thick. Above the layer of subfloor basalt lies a deposit of unconsolidated material of various compositions ranging from volcanic material to impact-formed regolith. The valley floor's unusually low albedo, or reflectivity, {{is a direct result of}} the volcanic material and glass beads located there. The deeper craters on the valley floor act as 'natural drill holes' and allowed the astronauts to sample the subfloor basalt. These basalt samples are composed primarily of <b>plagioclase,</b> but also contain amounts of clinopyroxene and other minerals.|$|E
5|$|Mars is a {{terrestrial}} planet {{that consists of}} minerals containing silicon and oxygen, metals, and other elements that typically make up rock. The surface of Mars is primarily composed of tholeiitic basalt, although parts are more silica-rich than typical basalt and may be similar to andesitic rocks on Earth or silica glass. Regions of low albedo suggest concentrations of <b>plagioclase</b> feldspar, with northern low albedo regions displaying higher than normal concentrations of sheet silicates and high-silicon glass. Parts of the southern highlands include detectable amounts of high-calcium pyroxenes. Localized concentrations of hematite and olivine have been found. Much of the surface is deeply covered by finely grained iron(III) oxide dust.|$|E
5|$|The {{composition}} of some lava flows in the Wells Gray-Clearwater volcanic field is unusual because they include small, angular to rounded fragments of rock called nodules and crystals {{that come from}} the mantle. These green nodules are known as peridotites because they are mostly made of a magnesium iron silicate mineral called olivine. These lava flows also comprise large crystals of olivine, <b>plagioclase,</b> and pyroxene that crystallized deep within the Earth's crust and mantle. The lavas and nodules they contain {{are similar to those}} erupted at Volcano Mountain in the Yukon. The nodules help volcanologists and other geoscientists to verify what the mantle beneath the volcanic field is like.|$|E
5|$|Rubidium-87 has a {{half-life}} of years, {{which is}} {{more than three times the}} age of the universe of years, making it a primordial nuclide. It readily substitutes for potassium in minerals, and is therefore fairly widespread. Rb has been used extensively in dating rocks; 87Rb beta decays to stable 87Sr. During fractional crystallization, Sr tends to concentrate in <b>plagioclase,</b> leaving Rb in the liquid phase. Hence, the Rb/Sr ratio in residual magma may increase over time, and the progressing differentiation results in rocks with elevated Rb/Sr ratios. The highest ratios (10 or more) occur in pegmatites. If the initial amount of Sr is known or can be extrapolated, then the age can be determined by measurement of the Rb and Sr concentrations and of the 87Sr/86Sr ratio. The dates indicate the true age of the minerals only if the rocks have not been subsequently altered (see rubidium–strontium dating).|$|E
5|$|Level Mountain basalt and {{andesite}} flows {{were presented}} in the 1926 Canada Department of Mines Summary Report, 1925, Part A. The andesites were described as porphyritic rocks with phenocrysts of feldspar of various size in a greyish or greenish matrix. Both hornblende and augite andesites were noted to have been represented under a microscope. The basalts were described as black rocks with basic <b>plagioclase</b> with or without olivine and were noted in many cases to contain a considerable percentage of brownish glass. Although there was not sufficient time available to study these flows in detail it was revealed at several points that the andesites formed the older and the basalts the younger flows. G. M. Dawson of the Geological Survey of Canada (GSC) was able to demonstrate that on the Stikine River {{there were at least}} four flows of basalt. The basalts and andesites were considered to be younger than all the rocks they were observed in contact with, namely granitic intrusives, porphyries and greenstones. More definite evidence as to their age was obtained by W. A. Johnston and F. A. Kerr of the GSC who placed them in the Tertiary {{with some of the most}} recent flows of the Stikine valley probably belonging to the Pleistocene.|$|E
25|$|Magnesium-rich olivine forms a large {{proportion}} of peridotite, and so magnesium content is high. Layered igneous complexes have much more varied compositions, depending on the fractions of pyroxenes, chromite, <b>plagioclase,</b> and amphibole. Minor minerals and mineral groups in peridotite include <b>plagioclase,</b> spinel (commonly the mineral chromite), garnet (especially the mineral pyrope), amphibole, and phlogopite. In peridotite, <b>plagioclase</b> is stable at relatively low pressures (crustal depths), aluminous spinel at higher pressures (to depths of 60km or so), and garnet at yet higher pressures.|$|E
25|$|Primary (magmatic) mineral species also {{encountered}} in komatiites include olivine, the pyroxenes augite, pigeonite and bronzite, <b>plagioclase,</b> chromite, ilmenite and rarely pargasitic amphibole. Secondary (metamorphic) minerals include serpentine, chlorite, amphibole, sodic <b>plagioclase,</b> quartz, iron oxides and rarely phlogopite, baddeleyite, and pyrope or hydrogrossular garnet.|$|E
25|$|Phenocrysts in Hekla's lava {{can contain}} <b>plagioclase,</b> pyroxene, titanomagnetite, olivine & apatite.|$|E
25|$|Megacrysts, {{crystals}} or grains {{that are}} considerably {{larger than the}} encircling matrix, are commonly found in lava flows throughout the Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province. They consist of three different groups, including kaersutitic amphibole megacrysts, clinopyroxene megacrysts and <b>plagioclase</b> megacrysts. Megacrysts made of kaersutite {{are known to be}} found mainly at Llangorse Mountain in northern British Columbia. Black glassy clinopyroxene megacrysts are widespread throughout the Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province, suggesting their creation is independent of lithosphere structure. In contrast, clear glassy <b>plagioclase</b> megacrysts are found largely {{at the southern end of}} the Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province and largely within the boundaries of the Stikinia terrane. This suggests the <b>plagioclase</b> megacrysts have a source that is sensitive to the Earth's lithosphere, including contamination or magma ponding. Megacrysts made of <b>plagioclase</b> and clinopyroxene regionally show significant evidence of reaction with the associated magma, including sieve-textured cores and random, resorbed and embayed outer margins wherever they are located.|$|E
25|$|The first rocks {{brought back}} by Apollo 11 were basalts. Although the mission landed on Mare Tranquillitatis, a few millimetric {{fragments}} of rocks {{coming from the}} highlands were picked up. These are composed mainly of <b>plagioclase</b> feldspar; some fragments were composed exclusively of anorthositic <b>plagioclase.</b> The identification of these mineral fragments led to the bold hypothesis that {{a large portion of}} the Moon was once molten, and that the crust formed by fractional crystallization of this magma ocean.|$|E
25|$|Salado's rock is {{predominantly}} potassium-rich dacite and rhyodacite. Its lavas {{are high in}} biotite, hornblende, <b>plagioclase,</b> and opaques, {{with lower levels of}} augite, quartz, and hypersthene.|$|E
25|$|Pyroxenites {{are related}} ultramafic rocks, which are {{composed}} largely of orthopyroxene and/or clinopyroxene; minerals {{that may be}} present in lesser abundance include olivine, garnet, <b>plagioclase,</b> amphibole, and spinel.|$|E
25|$|The dark {{areas of}} Mars are characterised by the mafic rock-forming {{minerals}} olivine, pyroxene, and <b>plagioclase</b> feldspar. These minerals {{are the primary}} constituents of basalt, a dark volcanic rock that also makes up the Earth's oceanic crust and the lunar maria.|$|E
25|$|The {{rocks on}} the plains of Gusev are a type of basalt. They contain the {{minerals}} olivine, pyroxene, <b>plagioclase,</b> and magnetite, and they look like volcanic basalt as they are fine-grained with irregular holes (geologists would say they have vesicles and vugs).|$|E
25|$|The Bowning Deformation {{caused the}} north–south {{faulting}} and long folding {{in the area}} surrounding the ACT. This deformation was connected with the attachment of the terrane to the continent. During this stage metamorphism occurred. In the Canberra Graben and Cullarin Block, metamorphism mostly reached the upper greenschist stage, with shallow burial and temperature below 350°C. This changed the volcanics and sediments with sericitisation, saussuritisation, conversion of <b>plagioclase</b> to albite, and conversion of biotite to chlorite, titanite, epidote and opaque minerals. On the western margin in southwest Belconnen, Duffy, and Kambah in the Laidlaw and Walker Volcanics the temperature was lower and prehnite-pumpellyite facies was achieved. This was not sufficient to convert <b>plagioclase</b> to albite.|$|E
