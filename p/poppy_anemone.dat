50|$|The Israeli {{national}} flower is the <b>poppy</b> <b>anemone</b> (Anemone coronaria; calanit metzuya in Hebrew), {{chosen in}} 2013 to replace Cyclamen persicum.|$|E
50|$|Anemone coronaria, <b>poppy</b> <b>anemone,</b> Spanish marigold, windflower, is {{a species}} of {{flowering}} plant in the genus Anemone, native to the Mediterranean region.|$|E
50|$|Numerous cultivars {{have been}} {{selected}} and named, the most popular including the De Caen (single) and St Brigid (semi-double and double) groups of cultivars. The De Caen group are hybrids cultivated in the districts of Caen and Bayeux in France in the 18th century, and include 'Bicolor' (red with white), 'Blue Poppy' (blue), 'Mr Fokker' (purple), 'Sylphide' (deep pink) and 'The Bride' (white). Referred to as <b>poppy</b> <b>anemones</b> because they closely resemble the true poppy (Papaveroideae). St. Brigid cultivars originated in Ireland, and named after that county's saint, they include 'Lord Lieutenant' (purple blue) and 'The Governor' (red). In addition to these large groups, there are two minor groups, Rissoana which is very rustic and early blooming (November) and Grassensis with large double flowers that bloom in the spring.|$|R
25|$|The {{country on}} {{the eastern side of the}} Judean Hills falls into the Jordan Valley in a {{confused}} mass of rocky ridges and deep narrow valleys. All the main wadis run from west to east; often with steep high banks, while the tributaries joined from all directions, breaking up the ridges making the hills, almost impossible to cross. Most tracks ran along the narrow beds of ravines where progress had to be made in single file. Further north at Jebel Kuruntul (also known as Jebel Quruntul, the Mount of Temptation and Mount Quarantania) the mountains end abruptly in a 1,000-foot (300 m) cliff. Sometimes the attacking parties had to haul themselves and each other over abrupt cliffs to be in a position to fight at close quarters at the top. Yet, in early Spring, the area was covered by wild flowers including cyclamen, <b>anemones,</b> <b>poppies</b> and tulips.|$|R
40|$|On potato stems, leaves, and tubers. Many {{theories}} have been advanced {{with regard to}} the origin of the destructive Peronospora infestans or potato disease. Meteorological and electrical states of the atmosphere, saturation of the plant by water, degeneration by various methods of cultivation, the ravages of insect life, these and others have each in their time been brought forward as the cause of all the mischief with our potato crops. also liberalJy supplied n 1 e with siides for co 1 nparison. When the potato plant has been attacked by the disease, the leaves assume a pale tint, and discolored spots appear thereon; if, in this stage of the disease, the underside of the leaf is examined it will be found to be covered with whitish patches, these patches are stems with fruit and arise from the abundant septate and branched 1 nyceliu 1 n, or opalescent threadlike roots which grow {{in the midst of the}} cells of the leaf, and eventually appear through the stomata as fertile stems. The eighteen at present known species of Peronospora attack parsnips, peas, onions, spinach, lettuce, clover, nettles, <b>anemones,</b> <b>poppies,</b> roses, docks, etc., but apparently not in such a destructive manner as P. infestans does with potatoes...|$|R
50|$|Among {{the best}} known summer anemones is A. coronaria, often called the <b>poppy</b> <b>anemone,</b> a tuberous-rooted plant, with parsleylike divided leaves, and large showy poppylike {{blossoms}} on stalks of from 15-20 cm high; the flowers are of various colours, but the principal are scarlet, crimson, blue, purple, and white. There are also double-flowered varieties, in which the stamens in the centre are replaced by a tuft of narrow petals. It is an old garden favourite, and of the double forms there are named varieties.|$|E
40|$|Tubers of the <b>poppy</b> <b>anemone</b> (Anemone coronaria L.) ‘Sylphide’ before {{planting}} were soaked for 24 h in water or gibberellic acid (GA 3) and benzyladenine (BA) at three concentrations: 50, 100 and 150 mg·dm- 3. From the 10 th to 16 th week of culture, leaves were sampled at weekly intervals to prepare weighed portions for {{determination of the}} content of saccharides and pigments: chlorophyll (total content) and carotenoids. Gibberellic acid and benzyladenine stimulated the production of chlorophyll and carotenoids as well as the accumulation of saccharides in leaves.  ...|$|E
