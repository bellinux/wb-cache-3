40|$|The main ethical {{principle}} in prenatal testing is the autonomous {{decision of the}} pregnant woman concerned. However, recent developments in prenatal testing undermine this model. The overall number of invasive prenatal examinations has dropped significantly. Yet, the amount of pathologic results has increased. Due to the improvement in ultrasound diagnostics the predictability of possible disabilities or diseases of the unborn child has increased substantially. As {{a result of this}} pregnant women can take the decision whether or not to undergo invasive prenatal examinations on the basis of personal risk "evidence" produced earlier on by means of non-invasive screening. It can be questioned, how autonomous decisions can be if they are increasingly pre-informed through upstream riskassessments on the basis of non-invasive screening. Particularly ultrasound screening is often carried out without thorough counselling and sometimes even without consent. The concept of autonomy is difficult to uphold if women do not deliberately decide whether to undergo non-invasive screening, but the moment of such a deliberate decision comes only after positive screening results.

HL is encoded by HMGCL gene and many mutations have been reported. 3 HMG is commonly observed in Saudi Arabia. Methods We utilized Whole Genome Amplification (WGA), PCR and direct sequencing to identify mutations underlying 3 HMG in the Saudi population. Two patients from two unrelated families and thirty-four 3 HMG positive dried blood spots (DBS) were included. Results We detected the common missense mutation R 41 Q in 89 % of the tested alleles (64 alleles). 2 alleles carried the {{frame shift mutation}} F 305 fs (- 2) and the last two alleles had a novel splice site donor IVS 6 + 1 G>A mutation which was confirmed by its absence in more than 100 chromosomes from the normal population.

40|$|This article {{examines}} the theoretical representation of our coming into this world within the philosophical tradition. Western philosophy has, in fact, always favoured thanatos and, therefore, the abandonment of this world. Hence the erroneous belief that ethos does not pass through the new and the generated, but through fact in a deterministic sense and through the destruction of bios. Our birth places us well within full citizenship and political ethics. On this front, the German Jewish philosopher Hannah Arendt has enriched the philosophical reflection on birth with the neologism natality and has had the merit of introducing a new category of thought.

The results reported here suggest that BIA is an easy, fast, and automatable approach for detecting mutations of CF, allowing real-time monitoring of hybridization between 9 -mer CF PNA probes and target biotinylated PCR products generated from healthy, heterozygous subjects and homozygous W 1282 X samples and immobilized on streptavidin-coated sensor chips.

More importantly, the demonstration that SPR-based BIA could be associated with microarray technology allows us to hypothesize that the method described in the present paper could be used for the development of a protocol employing multispotting on SPR biosensors of many CF-PCR products and a real-time simultaneous analysis of hybridization to PNA probes.

It investigates two scenarios where people use ART. One, progenitor couples using assisted reproductive technology (ART) and their relationship to their embryos, including those that are cryopreserved. The inquiry uses scholarly literature that studies relationships between progenitor couples and their embryos, including a multi-institutional study conducted on fertility patients 2 ̆ 7 attitudes and opinions toward their cryopreserved embryos. It examines two Jodi Picoult novels, which portray the use of ART for begetting children as challenging the meaning {{of what it means to}} be a parent, partner, spouse, or family member. It considers narratives in both Picoult novels that use the findings from the studies to demonstrate how the characters are reacting to the possibilities ART offers. Picoult 2 ̆ 7 s novels, characterized as contemporary realistic fiction, are compared to novels of another type of popular fiction, alternate history, or science fiction. The second scenario involves societies using ART in futuristic novels and their relationship to their creations, including children that are cloned and androids that are manufactured. By comparing the two genres of popular fiction, it examines the relationality, or relatedness between people and the human or quasi-human beings that will be born from ART, in order to explore the impact ART has upon people.

It can be applied to a single patient or, as a usual practice, whole genome or whole exome sequencing for the patient plus parents. For whole exome sequencing (WES), it usually produces up to 100 million short sequencing reads of usually 100 bp long. These short reads were firstly compared with sequences of a reference human genome and mapped to genomic regions from which they were generated. Each position (base pair) of a coding exon is usually covered with dozens to hundreds of sequencing reads. Analysing the sequences of these reads allows for identification of mutations that are different from the reference sequences. For WES for a single individual, up to 100, 000 variants can be identified, with some of which are common variants in a population and some of which rare or private. The population frequencies of these variants are looked up in public databases such as those from the 1000 Genome Project or ESP 6500, a project that sequenced 6500 individuals in the US. An internal database is also established with WES data from 200 samples from the local population. For rare, severe genetic disorders that are likely to be caused by mutations from a single gene, we can safely rule out the common (> 1 % in a population) variants and only focus on the rare or private variants. The nature of the mutations, such as with or without amino acid changes, changes in the open reading frame of the protein, the nature of the amino acid changes (similarity of the amino acid changed to), the conservation of this amino acid in different species, and the function of the gene in relationship to the disease phenotype, are considered to help pinpoint the causal mutations. We will present examples on using WES for molecular diagnosis for paediatric genetic disorders in our Department. These include detection of de novo mutations (mutations that are not detected in parents), somatic mutations and compound heterozygous mutations, and mutations missed by traditional laboratory testing, which demonstrated the power of this new technology in providing accurate molecular diagnosis. published_or_final_versio...|$|E
25|$|<b>Pre-implantation</b> genetic <b>diagnosis</b> (PGD or PIGD) {{refers to}} the genetic {{profiling}} of embryos prior to implantation (as a form of embryo profiling), and sometimes even of oocytes prior to fertilization. PGD is considered {{in a similar fashion}} to prenatal diagnosis. When used to screen for a specific genetic disease, its main advantage is that it avoids selective pregnancy termination as the method makes it highly likely that the baby will be free of the disease under consideration. PGD thus is an adjunct to assisted reproductive technology, and requires in vitro fertilization (IVF) to obtain oocytes or embryos for evaluation.|$|R

Our comparative analysis revealed a paradox: In the abortion case study we found a restrictive principle with a pragmatic/liberal application in Germany, and a liberal law with a restrictive application in Slovakia. In the PGD case study we found a liberal approach and dominating critical religious voices in Slovakia; and a restrictive approach and dominating critical secular voices in Germany...|$|R
40|$|Three or more {{consecutive}} pregnancy {{losses are}} considered as recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL). About 1 % of all pregnant women face this distressing problem and o. 5 % to 5 % of spontaneous abortions are recurrent. Genetic, environmental, anatomic, hormonal, infectious and immunological factors {{are associated with}} RPL. Sometimes several factors might simultaneously be responsible for RPL. So diagnostic work up is to be extended. Life style changes, hormonal supplementation, anticoagulant and immunotherapy and surgical correction of certain uterine anatomic defects might help the couple to be parent. Genetic problem can be overcome by <b>pre-implantation</b> genetic <b>diagnosis</b> (PGD) and transferring good healthy embryos...|$|R
