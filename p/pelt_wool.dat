50|$|Karakul sheep are a {{multi-purpose}} breed, {{kept for}} milking, meat, <b>pelts,</b> and <b>wool.</b> As a fat-tailed breed, {{they have a}} distinctive meat. Many adult Karakul are double-coated; in this case, people separate the coarse guard hair from the undercoat. Karakul is relatively coarse fiber used for outer garment, carpets and for felting.|$|R
60|$|And now {{he noted}} that the horse moved to a {{definite}} goal. Where the prairie lay smooth he kept his course straight as an arrow's toward the east. Deflected by hill or arroyo or impractical spinous brakes, he quickly flowed again into the current, charted by his unerring instinct. At last, upon the side of a gentle rise, he suddenly subsided to a complacent walk. A stone's cast away stood a little mott of coma trees; beneath it a jacal such as the Mexicans erect--a one-room house of upright poles daubed with clay and roofed with grass or tule reeds. An experienced eye would have estimated the spot as the headquarters of a small sheep ranch. In the moonlight the ground in the nearby corral showed pulverized to a level smoothness by the hoofs of the sheep. Everywhere was carelessly distributed the paraphernalia of the place--ropes, bridles, saddles, sheep <b>pelts,</b> <b>wool</b> sacks, feed troughs, and camp litter. The barrel of drinking water stood in the end of the two-horse wagon near the door. The harness was piled, promiscuous, upon the wagon tongue, soaking up the dew.|$|R
5000|$|A small cottage {{industry}} in fur <b>pelts</b> and <b>wool</b> mixed with possum fur fibre has developed, and trappers and hunters provide the raw material. The fur is often sold as 'eco-fur' {{by a number}} of small manufacturing and retailing businesses. The numbers of animals taken for fur is rising and has almost equalled the numbers killed in poisoning. A number of New Zealand companies are exporting possum carcasses to Taiwan, Hong Kong and Malaysia for human consumption, where possum is regarded as a delicacy and known as [...] "Kiwi bear". There is also a small industry processing possum meat as 'Possyum' dog food, also for export.|$|R
500|$|A {{major concern}} of the Indian {{government}} is the trafficking of wildlife products such as tiger and leopard skins and bones, bear gall bladders, otter <b>pelts,</b> and shahtoosh <b>wool</b> into India. [...] The Indian government has undertaken a program to sensitise the police and other law enforcement agencies in the area. [...] Most of such illicit trade currently takes place via Nepal.|$|R
5000|$|João Soares de Sousa was {{maritime}} commander, {{a man of}} [...] "elevated stature, swarthy, {{strong and}} animated, a noble man and charitable". He rented his lands on the island {{in a way that}} mitigated the poverty that existed on the island, pardoning debts and extending deadlines, as well as not requiring a fixed payment for the use of island mills. Donatary-captains were known for charging a fixed rate, yet, João Soares allowed each to pay what they could and never cited them for their debts. In years when the crops failed and famine extended throughout the island, he permitted some to kill sheep, but required those to return the <b>pelts</b> and <b>wool.</b>|$|R
5|$|The Normans {{transformed}} Carmarthen into {{an international}} trading port, the only staple port in Wales. Merchants imported food and French wines and exported <b>wool,</b> <b>pelts,</b> leather, lead and tin. In the late medieval period the county's fortunes varied, as good and bad harvests occurred, increased taxes were levied by England, there were episodes of plague, and recruitment for wars removed the young men. Carmarthen was particularly susceptible to plague as it was brought in by flea-infested rats on board ships from southern France.|$|R
50|$|The A4 Sheep Bank Project is {{currently}} in its last phase. The project is working to support the transition of the mobile veterinary unit into a privatized business as well as assist sheep owners to form enterprise groups involved in trading live sheep, <b>pelts,</b> skins and <b>wool.</b> In addition, a wool-processing and yarn-spinning project will be established {{in order to create}} immediate employment opportunities and income for Afghan women to work from their homes. The production of high-quality handspun yarn would be able to add value to sheared sheep wool and link into other downstream industries such as textile, carpets and handicrafts, generating further income and job prospects.|$|R
40|$|The fellmongery process {{involves}} {{the removal of}} wool from sheep and lamb skins prior to tanning. The pelts also must be free from epidermic, sweat and fat glands, muscle tissue, blood vessels, fat cells and collagen fibrous tissue. The process consists of the following operations:- (1) Washing of pelts. (2) Lime/Na 2 S paint application. (3) Wool removal; manual pulling. (4) Lining; removal of residual <b>wool,</b> <b>pelt</b> conditioning, carried out in a "dolly" or drum. (5) Deliming and bating; removal of lime liquor and extraneous pelt matter, "dolly" or drum processing. (6) Pickling; preservation; "dolly" or drum processing. Thirty-nine fellmongeries, which were operating in New Zealand {{at the end of}} 1972 (42), were all departments of meat processing works. [From Introduction...|$|R
50|$|Captain Chauvin {{made the}} first {{organized}} attempt to control the fur trade in New France. In 1599 he acquired a monopoly from Henry IV and tried to establish a colony {{near the mouth of}} the Saguenay River at Tadoussac. French explorers, voyageurs and Coureur des bois such as Étienne Brûlé, Samuel de Champlain, Radisson, La Salle, and Le Sueur, while seeking routes through the continent, established relationships with Amerindians and continued to expand the trade of fur pelts for items considered 'common' by the Europeans. Mammal winter pelts were prized for warmth, particularly animal <b>pelts</b> for beaver <b>wool</b> felt hats, which were an expensive status symbol in Europe. The demand for beaver wool felt hats was such that the beaver in Europe and European Russia had largely disappeared through exploitation.|$|R
5000|$|Outside of the {{exhibition}} circles, rabbit raising remained a small scale but persistent household and farm endeavor, in many locations unregulated by the rules that governed the production of larger livestock. With the ongoing urbanization of world-wide population, rabbit raising gradually declined, but saw resurgences in both Europe and North America during World War II, in conjunction with victory gardens. [...] Eventually, farmers across Europe and in the United States began to approach cuniculture with the same scientific principles as had already been applied {{to the production of}} grains, poultry, and hoofstock. National agriculture breeding stations were established to improve local rabbit strains and to introduce more productive breeds. National breeding centers focused most on developing strains for production purposes, including meat, <b>pelts,</b> and <b>wool.</b> [...] These gradually faded from prominence in the United States, but remained viable longer in Europe. Meanwhile, rabbit raising for local markets gained prominence in developing nations as an economical means of producing protein. Various aid agencies promote the use of rabbits as livestock. The animals are particularly useful in areas where women are limited in employment outside the household, because rabbits can be kept successfully in small areas. [...] These same factors have contributed to the increased popularity of rabbits as ‘backyard livestock’ among locavores and homesteaders in more developed countries in North America and Europe. The addition of rabbit breeds to the listing of endangered heritage breeds by the American Livestock Breeds Conservatory has also led to increased interest for livestock conservationists. In contrast, throughout Asia, and particularly in China, rabbits are increasingly raised intensively and sold for export around the world.|$|R
