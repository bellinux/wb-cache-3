25|$|Use of a <b>polymer</b> <b>substrate</b> {{for use in}} the {{upcoming}} banknotes was announced by Jim Flaherty in the 2010 Canadian federal budget speech on 4 March 2010, at which time he also announced that in the future the loonie ($1 coin) and toonie ($2 coin) would be made of steel instead of nickel to reduce manufacturing costs. Canada would become the ninth country to print all its banknotes using a <b>polymer</b> <b>substrate,</b> following Australia, Bermuda, Brunei, New Zealand, Nicaragua, Papua New Guinea, Romania, and Vietnam.|$|E
25|$|The use of polymer as a {{substrate}} {{was considered}} in part because access to the <b>polymer</b> <b>substrate</b> could be controlled, and replicating the chemical and physical recipe would be difficult. The practice of restricting access to the substrate used for manufacturing money existed {{as early as the}} 13th century, during which Chinese rulers stationed guards at mulberry forests, as mulberry bark was used to produce paper money.|$|E
25|$|The {{printing}} process involves the substrate passing through presses for lithographic printing, intaglio printing, numbering printing, and varnish printing. The inks are transferred using the prepared plates, which are replaced when worn. The opacifier layers enable the inks of the offset and intaglio printing {{to adhere to}} the substrate. The varnish printing stage applies a required protective varnish to the <b>polymer</b> <b>substrate.</b> Offset printing deposits a 1.5µm layer, intaglio about 24µm, and the protective varnish is about 2µm thick.|$|E
40|$|Surface {{acoustic}} wave device with c-axis-oriented aluminum nitride (AlN) piezoelectric thin films on <b>polymer</b> <b>substrates</b> can be potentially used for development of flexible sensors, flexible microfluidic applications, microsystems, and lab-on-chip systems. In this work, the AlN films have been successfully deposited on <b>polymer</b> <b>substrates</b> using the DC reactive magnetron-sputtering method at room temperature, and the XRD, SEM, and AFM methods reveal that low deposition pressure is beneficial to the highly c-axis-oriented AlN film on <b>polymer</b> <b>substrates.</b> Studies toward the development of AlN thin film-based flexible surface {{acoustic wave}} devices on the <b>polymer</b> <b>substrates</b> are initiated and the experimental and simulated results demonstrate the devices showing the acoustic wave velocity of 9000 – 10000 [*]m/s, which indicate the AlN lamb wave...|$|R

40|$|Functional {{multi-purpose}} {{contact lenses}} have recently attracted attention as suitable means {{to exploit the}} characteristics of eyes to diagnose diseases and for drug delivery. This is made possible by developing functional contact lens with micro sensors placed on it, which can be worn on the eye surface. However there are several challenges {{that need to be}} addressed before reaching the final functional contact lens with incorporated micro devices and micro sensors for biomedical applications. One such challenge is related to the metallization on <b>polymer</b> <b>substrates.</b> In this work, we present the first results in the direction of realizing robust metal patterns on <b>polymer</b> <b>substrates.</b> The metal patterns presented here are electrodes for connecting different devices and micro antenna loops. We also compare the metallization techniques on different <b>polymer</b> <b>substrates</b> like PDMS, PET to name a few and different metals patterned like Ag, Au etc. Specific steps and solutions to issues like crack formation and adhesion of the metal on the <b>polymer</b> <b>substrates</b> are also discussed...|$|R
25|$|Significant {{design changes}} to the notes have {{occurred}} since 1935, with new series introduced in 1937, 1954, 1970, 1986, and 2001. In June 2011, newly designed notes printed on a <b>polymer</b> <b>substrate,</b> as opposed to cotton fibre, were announced; {{the first of these}} polymer notes, the $100 bill, began circulation on November 14, 2011, the $50 bill began circulation on March 26, 2012, the $20 denomination began circulation on November 7, 2012, and the $5 and $10 denominations began circulation on November 12, 2013.|$|E
25|$|Efforts {{to reduce}} {{counterfeiting}} {{in recent years}} have sharply reduced the number of counterfeit notes in circulation. The number of counterfeit notes passed annually in Canada peaked in 2004, when 553,000 counterfeit notes were passed. Counterfeiting has decreased annually since that peak, with only 53,536 notes passed in 2010. The new Frontier Series of banknotes significantly improves security primarily by using a <b>polymer</b> <b>substrate</b> to make up the note instead of the previously used fabric. Even as Canada’s counterfeiting problem escalated, the shift to polymer was viewed as too expensive. A polymer note costs 19 cents to produce, compared to 9 cents for a typical cotton-paper note.|$|E
25|$|Polymer note {{technology}} {{was developed by}} Australia, and Australia prints polymer banknotes {{for a number of}} other countries. In 1988, Australia introduced its first polymer bank note and in 1996, Australia became the first country in the world to have a complete series of polymer notes. Australia's notes are printed by Note Printing Australia, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Reserve Bank of Australia. Note Printing Australia prints polymer notes or simply supplies the <b>polymer</b> <b>substrate</b> for a growing number of other countries including Bangladesh, Brunei, Chile, Indonesia, Kuwait, Malaysia, Mexico, Nepal, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Romania, Samoa, Singapore, Solomon Islands, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Vietnam. Many other countries are showing a strong interest in the new technology.|$|E
40|$|A novel {{photochemical}} {{approach is}} presented to fabricate a silicon oxide (SiOx) layer, which we have named an “oxide nanoskin ” (ONS), whose thickness is defined in the molecular-order of 1 ~ 3 nm. Through the chemisorption of a vapor phase organosilane and subsequent photooxidation using 172 nm vacuum ultraviolet (UV) light, an extremely flat SiOx layer without cracks or aggregates was formed on various <b>polymer</b> <b>substrates.</b> Owing to this ONS coating, the charge density and surface acidity of the <b>polymer</b> <b>substrates</b> became almost equal to those of a native oxide-covered Si (SiOx/Si) substrate. In addition, there was marked improvement in the durability of the hydrophilicity and in the micro-wear resistance of the polymer surfaces. Moreover, organosilane self-assembled monolayer (SAM) chemistry currently available {{for the treatment of}} inorganic glass and Si substrates could be similarly utilized. Well-ordered SAMs {{with a wide variety of}} terminal-end groups (e. g., trifluorocarbon or amino groups) could be fabricated even on inert <b>polymer</b> <b>substrates,</b> in a manner similar to their fabrication on SiOx/Si substrates. Furthermore, we demonstrated the site-selective deposition of metal oxide and metal films on <b>polymer</b> <b>substrates</b> using photolithographically micropatterned SAMs as microtemplates. Well-shaped microstructures were achieved only on the <b>polymer</b> <b>substrates</b> with the ONS layer. On the substrates without the ONS layer, pattern resolution degraded significantly and growth rate decreased, since both depended greatly on the SAM density and quality. Our ONS was very useful not only in forming highly ordered SAMs on the <b>polymer</b> <b>substrates,</b> but also in obtaining excellent pattern resolution, sufficient growth rate, and adhesion of the target materials...|$|R
40|$|Patterning {{materials}} on hydrophobic <b>polymer</b> <b>substrates</b> have extensive applications in fabricating flexible devices at low cost, while the low transfer efficiency encumbers its advance. This paper provides a facile route to transfer {{materials on}}to hydrophobic <b>polymer</b> <b>substrates</b> with high efficiency by operating in organic solvent atmosphere. Under {{the assistance of}} condensed organic solvent layer on the substrate, bovine serum albumin (BSA) are desirably transferred onto untreated hydrophobic <b>polymer</b> <b>substrates,</b> such as poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS), polystyrene (PS), and poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) as a proof-of-concept experiment. Moreover, the combination of this method with stepwise contraction and adsorption nanolithography (SCAN) was also demonstrated as an alternative way to further miniaturize patterns prepared by other methods.

40|$|Antireflective {{coatings}} on <b>polymer</b> <b>substrates</b> {{as required}} for ophthalmic lenses and transparent display windows have to fulfill challenging requirements concerning their environmental stability. The mismatch of thermal properties of polymers and inorganic coatings causes stresses that {{may reduce the}} durability and dimensional stability of coated polymers. This study shows that ex-situ measurements of stresses have to be executed on <b>polymer</b> <b>substrates</b> rather than on inorganic substrates to record the residual film stress. Additionally, a concept of an elastic multilayer is applied to calculate stress gradients inside of single films and antireflective coatings {{during and after the}} deposition process on <b>polymer</b> <b>substrates.</b> For the development of coated polymer optics of high-stability it is essential {{to take into account the}} stress gradients across the coatings, and to apply special coating designs and optimized coating deposition parameters...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, the {{relation}} between the hydrolysis rate of dissolved <b>polymer</b> <b>substrates</b> and sludge concentration was investigated in two ways, viz. by laboratory experiments and by computer simulations. In the simulations, the hydrolysis of dissolved polymer components was regarded as a general depolymerisation process in which the bonds of the parent molecule break randomly until only monomer and dimer components remain. The results illustrate that for the hydrolysis of dissolved <b>polymer</b> <b>substrates</b> the enzyme activity is the rate-limiting factor. Moreover, a general depolymerisation process can describe the enzymatic hydrolysis of these components...|$|R
40|$|Reactive pulse {{magnetron}} sputtering processes are of increasing {{interest for the}} deposition of high-precision optical coatings of high density, low roughness and shift-free environmental stability. SiO 2, Si 3 N 4 and silicon oxynitride are attractive coating materials for interference filters produced by sputtering of a silicon target in a precisely controlled reactive gas mixture of oxygen and nitrogen. <b>Polymer</b> <b>substrates</b> are increasingly relevant {{for the application of}} optical coatings due to their mechanical and economical advantages. The opposing properties of hard and brittle metal oxide layers produced by sputtering on one hand and of the soft and elastic <b>polymer</b> <b>substrates</b> on the other hand may lead to adhesion failure and crack formation of the coatings. Magnetron PECVD (magPECVD) using HMDSO as precursor allows to deposit carbon containing films with polymer-like properties. Results show the suitability of these coatings as hard coatings or matching layers. Multifunctional layers on <b>polymer</b> <b>substrates</b> with antireflective and scratch resistant properties were deposited using a combined magPECVD and sputter deposition process...|$|R

In June 1998, the Bank of Canada prepared to use Luminus as the substrate for the Canadian Journey Series, but in December 1999 the manufacturer withdrew its supply bid because it could not produce the substrate at the scale required by the Bank of Canada for printing banknotes. The bank printed the Canadian Journey Series on a cotton fibre substrate with similar surface characteristics to Luminus {{so that it could}} transition production to using the <b>polymer</b> <b>substrate</b> when scale production issues were resolved. The Bank of Canada also secured Canadian rights for Luminus and continued to develop the substrate for future use.|$|E

40|$|Thin <b>polymer</b> <b>substrates</b> are {{promising}} materials for flexible electronics with many advantages. However, the dimensional stability of <b>polymer</b> <b>substrates</b> is low. Nowadays, this is overcome by laminating <b>polymer</b> <b>substrates</b> onto a rigid carrier. Nevertheless, carrier-less processing {{will be a}} foreseen next step for future manufacturing of plastic electronic devices, which will intensify the interest in dimensional stability of the plastic substrates. This paper describes a measurement method to characterise the in-plane hygroscopic and thermal properties of thin polymeric substrates using a Digital Image Correlation (DIC) based method. The precision and accuracy of the method is addressed, and the method was validated using copper, aluminium and silicon test samples. The hygroscopic and thermal properties of semi-crystalline Polyethylene Naphthalate (PEN) and amorphous Polyether Sulphone (PES) substrates, both attractive for flexible electronics, were characterized. The coefficients of thermal and moisture expansion were measured. Furthermore, the anisotropy in thermal and hygroscopic expansion was quantified using the full in-plane deformation measurement data. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R
40|$|A {{one-step}} {{process to}} fabricate conductive features on flexible <b>polymer</b> <b>substrates</b> by inkjet printing an organometallic silver ink directly onto a substrate that is heated to 130 °C is presented.

The combination of this ink and the simultaneous printing/sintering process opens up routes for the direct fabrication of conductive features on common <b>polymer</b> <b>substrates</b> that could be applied, for example, in roll-to-roll production of flexible microelectronic systems...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: This {{in vitro}} study was {{designed}} to evaluate both blood and human gingival fibroblast responses on fiber-reinforced composite (FRC) aimed to be used as oral implant abutment material. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Two different types of substrates were investigated: (a) Plain polymer (BisGMA 50 %-TEGDMA 50 %) and (b) FRC. The average surface roughness (Ra) was measured using spinning-disk confocal microscope. The phase composition was identified using X-ray diffraction analyzer. The degree of monomer conversion (DC%) was determined using FTIR spectrometry. The blood response, including the blood-clotting ability and platelet adhesion morphology, was evaluated. Fibroblast cell responses were studied in cell culture environment using routine test conditions. RESULTS: The Ra of the substrates investigated was less than 0. 1 mum with no signs of surface crystallization. The DC% was 89. 1 +/- 0. 5 %. The FRC substrates had a shorter clotting time and higher platelets activation state than plain <b>polymer</b> <b>substrates.</b> The FRC substrates showed higher (P < 0. 01 - 0. 001) amount of adhered cells than plain <b>polymer</b> <b>substrates</b> at all time points investigated. The strength of attachment was evaluated using serial trypsinization, the number of cells detached from FRC substrates was 59 +/- 5 %, whereas those detached from the plane <b>polymer</b> <b>substrates</b> was 70 +/- 5 %, indicating a stronger (P < 0. 01) cell attachment on the FRC surfaces. Fibroblasts grew more efficiently on FRC than on plain <b>polymer</b> <b>substrates,</b> showing significantly higher (P < 0. 01) cell metabolic activities throughout the experiment.
