25|$|In {{as early}} as the 1870s “{{polymers}}” formed by this process were known, but these polymers were initially thought of as undesirable byproducts associated with electric discharge, with little attention being given to their properties. It was not until the 1960s that the properties of these polymers where found to be useful. It was found that flawless thin polymeric coatings could be formed on metals, although for very thin films (<10mm) this has recently been shown to be an oversimplification. By selecting the monomer type and the energy density per monomer, known as the Yasuda parameter, the chemical composition and structure of the resulting thin film can be varied with a wide range. These films are usually inert, adhesive, and have low dielectric constants. Some common monomers polymerized by this method include styrene, ethylene, methacrylate and pyridine, just to name a few. The 1970s brought about many advances in plasma polymerization, including the polymerization of many different types of monomers. The mechanisms of deposition however were largely ignored until more recently. Since this time most attention devoted to plasma polymerization has been in the fields of coatings, but since it is difficult to control <b>polymer</b> <b>structure,</b> it has limited applications.|$|E

The processing conditions have an ultimate impact on the structure that develops during cooling.

40|$|Self-assembled {{periodic}} structures {{based upon}} chiralliquid crystalline materials have significant {{potential in the}} field of photonics ranging from fast-switching optoelectronic devices to low-threshold lasers. The flexoelectro-optic effect, which is observed in chiralnematic liquid crystals (LCs) when an electric field is applied perpendicular to the helical axis, has significant potential as it exhibits analogue switching in 10 – 100 [*]μs. However, the major technological barrier that prohibits the commercial realisation of this electro-opticeffect is the requirement of a uniform, in-plane alignment of the helix axis between glass substrates. Here, it is shown that periodic <b>polymer</b> <b>structures</b> engineered in the nematic phase of a chiral nematic LC device using direct laser writing can result in the spontaneous formation of the necessary uniform lying helix (ULH) state. Specifically, two-photon polymerization is used in conjunction with a spatial light modulator so as to correct for aberrations introduced by the bounding glass substrates enabling the <b>polymer</b> <b>structures</b> to be fabricated directly into the device.
