5000|$|Apricots are {{susceptible}} to various diseases whose relative importance is different in the major production regions {{as a consequence of}} their climatic differences. For example, hot weather as experienced in California's Central Valley will often cause pit burn, a condition of soft and brown fruit around the pit. Bacterial diseases include bacterial spot and crown gall. Fungal diseases include brown rot caused by Monilinia fructicola: infection of the blossom by rainfall leads to [...] "blossom wilt" [...] whereby the blossoms and young shoots turn brown and die; the twigs die back in a severe attack; brown rot of the fruit is due to Monilinia infection later in the season. Dieback of branches in the summer is attributed to the fungus Eutypa lata, where examination of the base of the dead branch will reveal a canker surrounding a <b>pruning</b> <b>wound.</b> Other fungal diseases are black knot, Alternaria spot and fruit rot, and powdery mildew. Unlike peaches, apricots are not affected by leaf curl, and bacterial canker (causing sunken patches in the bark which then spread and kill the affected branch or tree) and silver leaf are not serious threats, which means that pruning in late winter is considered safe.|$|E
40|$|The {{incidence}} of {{grapevine trunk disease}} pathogens in grapevine rootstock mother plants from different cultivars, ages and growing areas in South Africa was determined by means of isolations from the basal and <b>pruning</b> <b>wound</b> ends of 2 -year-old stubs.

40|$|Background and Aims: Eutypa dieback is an {{economically}} important disease of grapevines {{and a major}} threat to vineyard longevity throughout the world. Developing effective preventative strategies offers the best means of control. In this study, <b>pruning</b> <b>wound</b> protectants and various spray applications were evaluated for their ability to prevent infection by ascospores of Eutypa lata. Methods and Results: Fungicides and natural alternative treatments were applied by hand to grapevine pruning wounds in winter prior to inoculation with E. [*]lata. In a series of greenhouse and field experiments, tebuconazole, pyraclostrobin, fluazinam, garlic extract and lactoferrin significantly reduced infection. A range of tractor-driven sprayers was used to apply tebuconazole to pruning wounds, and those which provided good coverage reduced infection by E. [*]lata to a level similar to that when tebuconazole was applied with a paintbrush. Conclusion: Eutypa dieback can be controlled with several fungicides and natural treatments. Tractor-driven sprayers, which by design or modification can efficiently deliver maximum possible coverage at high output rates, can be used for application of <b>pruning</b> <b>wound</b> treatments. Significance of the Study: Results of this study contributed to registration of fungicides for use as <b>pruning</b> <b>wound</b> treatments to control E. [*]lata in Australia. Demonstrating the ability of tractor-driven sprayers to apply treatments effectively has led to greater industry adoption of dormant treatments and may decrease the future impact of Eutypa dieback.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 1998 The Douglas-fir {{pitch moth}} (DFPM), Synanthedon novaroensis, is {{attracted}} to exudations of oleoresin and oviposits at wounds on the bole of host trees.

30|$|Pruning {{to promote}} clear wood is an {{important}} component of the silvicultural regime of Pinus radiata (Neilsen and Pinkard 2003); however, this silvicultural investment can be negated in pruned trees exhibiting the symptoms of flute canker disease (Hopkins et al. 2012). It has been shown that N. fuckeliana is commonly associated with <b>wounds,</b> including <b>pruning</b> <b>wounds,</b> in European specimens of Picea abies (Metzler 1997). In New Zealand, flute canker disease is associated with <b>pruning</b> <b>wounds</b> on Pinus radiata (Gadgil et al. 2003; Hopkins et al. 2012). <b>Pruning</b> <b>wounds</b> have been demonstrated to be important infection courts for Sphaeropsis sapinea (Fr.)

30|$|Nectria flute canker, {{caused by}} N. fuckeliana (Dick and Crane 2009), is an {{important}} disease of Pinus radiata in New Zealand (Gadgil 2003) and Chile (Morales 2009). The flute canker disease is associated with <b>pruning</b> <b>wounds</b> (Gadgil 2003; Hopkins et al. 2012; Morales 2009) and the fungus {{has been found in}} wounded tissue of Picea abies in Europe (Huse 1981; Metzler 1997; Roll-Hansen and Roll-Hansen 19791980; Vasiliauskas and Stenlid 1998; Vasiliauskas et al. 1996); therefore, it was hypothesised that <b>pruning</b> <b>wounds</b> serve as the primary infection courts for N. fuckeliana in Pinus radiata. In this study, we assessed the presence of N. fuckeliana in pruned and unpruned Pinus radiata and the results indicated that <b>pruning</b> <b>wounds</b> are not the primary infection courts for the pathogen. There was no significant difference of the presence of the fungus in pruned and unpruned trees. These results do not rule out <b>pruning</b> <b>wounds</b> as infection courts for N. fuckeliana, and this study provides some limited evidence of an increasing level of infection in pruned versus unpruned trees {{over the course of the}} study (Figure 4). However, the similar level of infection between pruned and unpruned trees (Figure 3 a) suggests that the fungus is able to enter Pinus radiata via other routes, and demonstrates that <b>pruning</b> <b>wounds</b> are not the only infection courts or even the primary infection courts for the fungus. Despite this result, field evidence indicates that the development of Nectria flute canker disease is closely associated with pruning (Bulman 2007).|$|R

40|$|Thesis (PhD) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2014. ENGLISH ABSTRACT: Grapevine trunk {{diseases}} are {{a cause of}} decline and loss of productivity in grapevines at all stages of growth. These {{diseases are}} caused by a complex of wood-inhabiting fungi that infect mainly through pruning wounds. The management of these diseases relies on wound protection to prevent infection {{since there are no}} eradicative control measures to cure infected vines. There are few or no fungicides registered for grapevine <b>pruning</b> <b>wound</b> protection in most countries, while Trichoderma biocontrol agents are often available. This study aimed at improving grapevine wound protection by Trichoderma (T.) spp. and {{to gain a better understanding}} of the factors and mechanisms involved in biocontrol. The effect of pruning time (early or late) and five timings of application of the biocontrol agent after pruning on <b>pruning</b> <b>wound</b> colonisation by T. atroviride and T. harzianum were determined. Chenin blanc and Cabernet Sauvignon vineyards were pruned in July (early) and August (late) of 2011 and 2012, and pruning wounds were treated with suspensions of the Trichoderma spp. at various times (0, 6, 24, 48 and 96 hours) after <b>pruning.</b> <b>Wound</b> colonisation was depended on the physiological state of the vine at pruning for both cultivars. However, for the 2012 season in Chenin blanc, wound colonisation was similarly high for both pruning times, which was attributed to high rainfall and humidity. Application of the biocontrol agents 6 hours after pruning consistently resulted in high wound colonisation by the Trichoderma spp. in both cultivars and pruning times. In both cultivars, <b>pruning</b> <b>wound</b> infection due to natural inoculum was higher in wounds made in late winter than those made earlier. The effect of conidial formulation in nutritional (glucose, yeast extract and urea) and bio-enhancing (chitin and cell free culture filtrates) additives, on <b>pruning</b> <b>wound</b> colonisation by T. atroviride was also investigated. Nutritional additives increased the extent of <b>pruning</b> <b>wound</b> colonisation by T. atroviride compared to the un-amended conidial suspensions in a glass house study. The additives as well as Garrison, a fungicide containing <b>pruning</b> <b>wound</b> paint, and Eco 77 Â®, a registered T. harzianum biocontrol product, were tested in field trials for wound protection from infection by Phaeomoniella (Pa.) chlamydospora. In 2011, the pathogen was inoculated a day after pruning and all the Trichoderma spp. treatments similarly reduced Pa. chlamydospora infection by 75 % to 90 % in Thompson Seedless, while control was less in Chenin blanc and ranged from 40 % to 74 %. In 2012, the trial was carried out on Chenin blanc only and the pathogen was inoculated at intervals of 1, 3 and 7 days after <b>pruning.</b> <b>Wound</b> protection by the Trichoderma treatments was highest when wounds were inoculated with Pa. chlamydospora seven days after pruning. Two conidial formulations, a culture filtrate made from a chitin based medium and a combination of yeast extract, urea and glucose, consistently enhanced biocontrol efficacy. These formulations reduced Pa. chlamydospora infection to levels similar to those of Garrison. The integration of chemical and biological wound protection could provide both immediate and long term wound protection, but is limited by the sensitivity of the biocontrol agent to fungicides. Benzimidazole resistant Trichoderma strains were generated by gamma irradiation from the wild type isolates of T. atroviride (UST 1 and UST 2) and T. harzianum (T 77). Mutants from UST 1 and UST 2 were of similar biological fitness as the wild type isolates and retained their in vitro antagonistic activity against grapevine trunk pathogens, while the mutant from T 77 had reduced fitness and was not antagonistic to the pathogens. The wild type, UST 1, and its mutant were tested alone and in combination with thiophanate methyl and carbendazim, respectively, for their ability to prevent <b>pruning</b> <b>wound</b> infection by Pa. chlamydospora. The combination of the UST 1 mutant and carbendazim was the most effective treatment and gave the highest reduction in Pa. chlamydospora infection (70 % to 93 % control). Grapevine cell cultures were used to compare the response of grapevines to T. atroviride and Eutypa (E.) lata as a first step to determining the importance of Trichoderma-grapevine interactions in <b>pruning</b> <b>wound</b> bio-protection. The expression of genes coding for enzymes of the phenylpropanoid pathway and pathogenesis related (PR) proteins was profiled over a 48 -hour period using quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR. The cell cultures responded to fungal elicitors in a hypersensitive-like response that lead to a decrease in cell viability. Fungal elicitors from both fungi triggered the same genes and caused up-regulation of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL), 4 coumaroyl Co-A ligase (CCo-A), stilbene synthase (STS), chitinase class IV (CHIT IV), PR 3 and PR 4, and a down regulation of chalcone synthase (CHS) genes. Higher expression of PAL and CHIT IV in cell cultures treated with the T. atroviride elicitor led to a significantly higher (P < 0. 05) total phenolic content and chitinolytic enzyme activity of the cell cultures compared to cell cultures treated with the E. lata elicitor. The response of the cell cultures to the T. atroviride elicitor signifies that the induction of grapevine resistance may be involved in wound bio-protection. The role of secondary metabolites produced by Trichoderma spp. used in <b>pruning</b> <b>wound</b> protection was also investigated. A volatile antimicrobial compound, 6 -pentyl Î±-pyrone (6 PP), was isolated and found to be the major secondary metabolite from the T. atroviride (UST 1 and UST 2) and T. harzianum (T 77) isolates. This metabolite was found to inhibit mycelial growth, spore and conidia germination of E. lata, Neofussicocum (N.) australe, N. parvum and Pa. chlamydospora. The production of 6 PP was induced when the T. atroviride isolates were grown in a grapevine wood extract medium while for UST 1, the 6 PP concentration was further doubled when it was co-cultured with N. parvum. Results therefore, indicate that 6 PP is involved in the Trichoderma-pathogen interactions on pruning wounds. The results of this study have provided new information in regards to the application of Trichoderma-based <b>pruning</b> <b>wound</b> products. The best time of application proved to be 6 hours post pruning. The formulation of conidial suspensions of Trichoderma spp. with nutritional additives and in protein extracts of the biocontrol agent showed potential in reducing variability of wound bio-protection. However, further research would be necessary to develop commercial products. The application of a fungicide together with Trichoderma spp. in the field holds promise to improve control, but would require further trials for possible commercialisation. This study is the first to report on grapevine host defence genes that are activated by the Trichoderma spp. used in <b>pruning</b> <b>wound</b> protection. Together with the characterisation of the major secondary metabolite produced by these Trichoderma spp., this information aids in understanding the mechanisms involved in the complex interaction between the biocontrol agent, the host and the pathogen. AFRIKAANSE OPSOMMING: Wingerdstamsiektes veroorsaak terugsterwing en verlies aan produktiwiteit in wingerdstokke gedurende alle groeifases. Hierdie siektes word veroorsaak deur ân verskeidenheid van hout-koloniserende swamme wat die wingerdstok meestal deur snoeiwonde infekteer. Die bestuur van hierdie siektes is afhanklik van wondbeskerming om infeksie te verhoed, omdat daar geen uitwissende beheermetodes na infeksie bestaan nie. In meeste lande is daar min of geen swamdoders geregistreer vir snoeiwond beskerming, terwyl Trichoderma biobeheer agente gereÃ«ld beskikbaar is. Hierdie studie poog om wingerd wondbeskerming deur Trichoderma (T.) spp. te verbeter en ân meer volledige begrip van die faktore en meganismes betrokke by biologiese beheer te ontwikkel. Die effek van die tydsberekening van snoei (vroeg of laat) en vyf behandelingstye van die biobeheer agent na snoei op die kolonisering van snoeiwonde deur T. atroviride en T. harzianum is bepaal. Chenin blanc en Cabernet Sauvignon wingerde is gesnoei gedurende Julie (vroeg) en Augustus (laat) in 2011 en 2012, en snoeiwonde is behandel met Trichoderma spp. suspensies op verskillende tydspunte (0, 6, 24, 48 en 96 ure) na snoei. Wond-kolonisering was afhanklik van die fisiologiese toestand van die wingerdstok gedurende snoei vir albei kultivars. Gedurende die 2012 seisoen was wond-kolonisering ewe hoog vir albei snoeitye op Chenin blanc. Dit is verklaar deur hoÃ« reÃ«nval en humiditeit gedurende daardie seisoen. Die aanwending van biobeheer agente 6 ure na snoei het konsekwent hoÃ« kolonisering deur Trichoderma spp. tot gevolg gehad op albei kultivars en albei snoeitye. In albei kultivars is wondinfeksie as gevolg van natuurlike inokulum hoÃ«r gewees in wonde gemaak gedurende laat winter as in wonde wat vroeÃ«r in die seisoen gemaak is. Die effek van konidia formulasie in voeding (glukose, gisekstrak en urea) en bioverbetering (chitien en sel-vrye kultuurfiltraat) toevoegings op snoeiwond-kolonisering deur T. atroviride is ook ondersoek. Voeding toevoegings het die omvangs van snoeiwond-kolonisering deur T. atroviride vergroot in vergelyking met ongewysigde konidia suspensies gedurende ân glashuis studie. Die toevoegings, sowel as Garrison, ân snoeiwond verf wat ân swamdoder bevat, en Eco 77 Â®, ân geregistreerde T. harzianum biobeheer produk, is getoets in veldproewe vir wondbeskerming teen infeksie deur Phaeomoniella (Pa.) chlamydospora. In 2011 is die patogeen geÃ¯nokuleer ân dag na snoei en al die Trichoderma spp. behandelings het infeksie verminder met 75 % tot 90 % op Thompson Seedless. Beheer was minder suksesvol op Chenin blanc, waar slegs 40 % tot 74 % beheer behaal is. In 2012 is die proef uitgevoer slegs op Chenin blanc en die patogeen is geÃ¯nokuleer teen intervalle van 1, 3 en 7 dae na snoei. Wondbeskerming by die Trichoderma behandelinge was die hoogste wanneer wonde sewe dae na snoei geÃ¯nokuleer is met Pa. chlamydospora. Twee konidia formulasies, ân kultuurfiltraat wat bestaan het uit ân chitien-gebaseerde medium en ân kombinasie van gisekstrak, urea en glukose het deurlopend die effektiwiteit van biobeheer verbeter. Hierdie formulasies het Pa. chlamydospora infeksie verminder tot soortgelyke vlakke behaal deur Garrison. Die integrasie van chemiese- en biobeheer in wondbeskerming kan onmiddelike en langtermyn wondbeskerming bied, maar is beperk deur die sensitiwiteit van die biobeheer agent teen swamdoders. Benzimidazole-weerstandbiedende Trichoderma isolate is ontwikkel deur gamma-bestraling van die wilde-tipe isolate van T. atroviride (UST 1 en UST 2) en T. harzianum (T 77). Mutante van UST 1 en UST 2 het soortgelyke biologiese fiksheid getoon as die wilde-tipe en het hul in vitro antagonistiese aktiwiteit teen wingerd stampatogene behou, terwyl die mutant van T 77 verminderde fiksheid getoon het en nie meer antagonisties teen patogene was nie. Die wilde-tipe, UST 1, en sy mutant is apart en in kombinasie met thiofanaatmetiel en carbendazim, respektiewelik, getoets vir die vermoÃ« om snoeiwonde te beskerm teen Pa. chlamydospora. Die kombinasie van die UST 1 mutant met carbendazim was die mees effektiewe behandeling en het die hoogste vermindering in Pa. chlamydospora infeksie gelewer (70 tot 93 % beheer). As ân beginpunt om die belang van Trichoderma-wingerd interaksies in snoiewondbeheer te bepaal, is die invloed van T. atroviride en Eutypa (E.) lata op somatiese selkulture van wingerd vergelyk. Die effek van diÃ© behandelings op ensieme in die fenielpropanoÃ¯edweg en patogenese-verwante (PR) proteÃ¯ene is bepaal deur intydse PKR (real time PCR) van die korresponderende gene oor ân 48 uur tydperk. Die swam-afkomstige ontlokkers het ân hipersensitiewe-tipe reaksie in die selkulture ontlok, wat tot ân afname in sellewensvatbaarheid gelei het. Ontlokkers afkomstig van beide swamme het dieselfde gene aangeskakel en het induksie van fenielalanien ammoniak-liase (PAL), 4 kumaroÃ¯el Ko-A ligase (CCo-A), stilbeen sintase (STS), chitienase klas IV (CHIT IV), PR 3 en PR 4 veroorsaak en ân onderdrukking in chalkoon sintase (CHS) gene tot gevolg gehad. HoÃ«r uitdrukking van PAL en CHIT IV in selkulture behandel met die T. atroviride ontlokker het gelei tot ân beduidende hoÃ«r (P < 0. 05) totale fenoolinhoud en chitienolitiese aktiwiteit in selkulture in vergelyking met selkulture wat behandel is met die E. lata ontlokker. Die reaksie van die selkulture op die T. atroviride ontlokker dui daarop dat die induksie van wingerd weerstandbiedenheid betrokke mag wees in wond biobeheer. Die rol van sekondÃªre metaboliete geproduseer deur Trichoderma spp. wat gebruik word in snoeiwond beheer is ook ondersoek. ân Vlugtige antimikrobiese verbinding, 6 -pentiel Î±-pyroon (6 PP) is geÃ¯soleer en bepaal om die hoof sekondÃªre metaboliet afkomstig vanuit die T. atroviride (UST 1 en UST 2) en T. harzianum (T 77) isolate te wees. Hierdie metaboliet is betrokke by inhibisie van miselium groei, spoor en konidium ontkieming van E. lata, Neofusicoccum (N.) australe, N. parvum en Pa. chlamydospora. Die produksie van 6 PP is geÃ¯nduseer deur die T. atroviride in wingerd hout ekstrak te kweek. In die geval van UST 1, is die 6 PP konsenstrasie verdubbel deur die isolaat met saam met N. parvum te kweek. Hierdie resultaat is ân aanduiding dat 6 PP betrokke is in die Trichoderma-patogeen interaksie op snoeiwonde. Die resultate van hierdie studie het nuwe inligting met betrekking tot die aanwending van Trichoderma-gebaseerde snoeiwond produkte verskaf. Die beste tyd vir aanwending van sulke produkte was 6 ure na snoei. Die formulasie van konidia suspensies van Trichoderma spp. met voeding toevoegings en in proteÃ¯en ekstrakte van die biobeheer agent het potensiaal getoon in die vermindering van variasie in wondbeskerming deur biobeheer agente. Verdere navorsing sal nodig wees om kommersiÃ«le produkte te ontwikkel. Die aanwending van ân swamdoder saam met Trichoderma spp. in die wingerd is belowend om beheer te verbeter, maar het meer proewe nodig voor kommersialisering. Hierdie studie is die eerste om wingerd beskerming gene wat deur Trichoderma spp. geaktiveer word aan te meld. Laasgenoemde, saam met die beskrywing van die hoof sekondÃªre metaboliete wat deur hierdie Trichoderma spp. geproduseer word, dra by tot ân meer volledige begrip van die meganismes betrokke by die komplekse interaksie tussen die biobeheer agent, die gasheer en die patogeen...|$|E

40|$|Protection of wounds against {{infection}} by trunk disease pathogens is {{the most}} efficient and cost-effective means to prevent grapevine trunk diseases. Studies done to determine the effectiveness of chemical <b>pruning</b> <b>wound</b> protectants have mostly focused on the control of Eutypa lata. However, other important wound pathogens, such as Phaeomoniella chlamydospora, Phaeoacremonium spp., Phomopsis spp. and species of Botryosphaeriaceae (including Botryosphaeria and aggregate genera), pose just as significant a threat to sustainable grape production. Fungicide sensitivity {{studies have been conducted}} for Pa. chlamydospora, P. viticola and E. lata. However, no such studies have been conducted for the pathogenic species of Botryosphaeriaceae from grapevines in South Africa. Ten fungicides were, therefore, tested in vitro for their efficacy on mycelial inhibition of the four most common or pathogenic species of Botryosphaeriaceae in South Africa, 'B. ' obtusa, Neofusicoccum australe, N. parvum and Lasiodiplodia theobromae. Iprodione, pyrimethanil, copper ammonium acetate, kresoxim-methyl and boscalid were ineffective in inhibiting the mycelial growth at the highest concentrations tested (20 mu g/mL for copper ammonium acetate, 5 mu g/mL for other agents tested). Benomyl, tebuconazole, prochloraz manganese chloride and flusilazole were the most effective fungicides with EC 50 values for the different species ranging from 0. 36 - 0. 55, 0. 07 - 0. 17, 0. 07 - 1. 15 and 0. 04 - 0. 36 mu g/mL, respectively. These fungicides, except prochloraz manganese chloride, are registered for use on grapes in South Africa and were also reported to be effective against Pa. chlamydospora, P. viticola and E. lata. Results from bioassays on 1 -year-old Chenin Blanc grapevine shoots indicated that benomyl, tebuconazole and prochloraz manganese chloride were most effective in limiting lesion length in pruning wounds that were inoculated with species of Botryosphaeriaceae after fungicide treatment. The bioassay findings were, however, inconclusive due to low and varied re-isolation incidences. Benomyl, tebuconazole, prochloraz manganese chloride and flusilazole can be identified as fungicides to be evaluated as <b>pruning</b> <b>wound</b> protectants in additional bioassays and vineyard trials against species of Botryosphaeriaceae {{as well as the other}} grapevine trunk disease pathogens...|$|E
40|$|Pruning {{wild cherry}} (Prunus avium L.) {{is a common}} {{silvicultural}} practice carried out to produce valuable timber at a veneer wood quality. Sub-optimal pruning treatments can permit un-occluded <b>pruning</b> <b>wounds</b> to develop devaluing decay.

Branch stub length, branch diameter and radial stem increment during occlusion were found to be significant predictors for occlusion time. From the results it could be concluded that for the long term success of artificial pruning of wild cherry it is crucial to (i) keep branch stubs short (while avoiding damage to the branch collar), (ii) to enable the tree to maintain significant radial growth after pruning, (iii) to avoid large <b>pruning</b> <b>wounds</b> (> 2. 5 cm) by removing steeply angled and fast growing branches at an early stage...|$|R

Tebuconazole and carbendazim were the most effective fungicides for reducing colonization of pruning wounds inoculated with E. lata. Pyrimethanil and fluazinam also provided some control but were less effective than tebuconazole at the rates tested. Other treatments, such as cyprodinil + fludioxionil, pyraclostrobin, a garlic extract, and lactoferrin, reduced colonization of wounds by E. lata but require further evaluation at higher concentrations.

40|$|Thesis (MScAgric (Plant Pathology)) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2008. In recent years, {{several studies}} have {{conclusively}} shown that numerous pathogens, including several species in the Botryosphaeriaceae, Phomopsis, Phaeoacremonium, as well as Phaeomoniella chlamydospora and Eutypa lata, contribute to premature decline and dieback of grapevines. These pathogens {{have the ability to}} infect grapevines through pruning wounds, which leads {{to a wide range of}} symptoms developing that includes stunted growth, cankers and several types of wood necrosis. Pruning wounds stay susceptible for 2 to 16 weeks after pruning and sustained levels of <b>pruning</b> <b>wound</b> protection is therefore required. The aims of this study were to (i) evaluate the ability of several biological agents to protect pruning wounds, (ii) characterise unknown Trichoderma strains and identify their modes of action and (iii) determine the optimal time of season for biological agent application. Several biological agents were initially evaluated in a laboratory for their antagonism against trunk disease pathogens. The best performing control agents were tested in a field trial conducted on Merlot and Chenin blanc vines in the Stellenbosch region. Spurs were pruned to three buds and the fresh pruning wounds were treated with benomyl as a control treatment, Trichoderma-based commercial products, VinevaxÂ® and Eco 77 Â®, Bacillus subtilis, and Trichoderma isolates, USPP-T 1 and -T 2. Seven days after treatment the pruning wounds were spray inoculated with spore suspensions of four Botryosphaeriaceae spp. (Neofusicoccum australe, N. parvum, Diplodia seriata and Lasiodiplodia theobromae), Eutypa lata, Phaeomoniella chlamydospora and Phomopsis viticola. After a period of 8 months the treatments were evaluated by isolations onto potato dextrose agar. Trichodermabased products and isolates in most cases showed equal or better efficacy than benomyl, especially USPP-T 1 and -T 2. Moreover, these isolates demonstrated a very good ability to colonise the wound tissue. The two uncharacterised Trichoderma isolates (USPP-T 1 and USPP-T 2), which were shown to be highly antagonistic toward the grapevine trunk disease pathogens, were identified by means of DNA comparison, and their ability to inhibit the mycelium growth of the trunk disease pathogens by means of volatile and non-volatile metabolite production studied. The two gene areas that were used include the internal transcribed spacers (ITS 1 and 2) and the 5. 8 S ribosomal RNA gene and the translation elongation factor 1 ï¡ (EF). The ITS and EF sequences were aligned to published Trichoderma sequences and the percentage similarity determined and the two Trichoderma isolates were identified as Trichoderma atroviride. The volatile production of T. atroviride isolates was determined by placing an inverted Petri dish with Trichoderma on top of a dish with a pathogen isolate and then sealed with parafilm. Trichoderma isolates were grown for 2 days on PDA where after they were inverted over PDA plates containing mycelial plugs. The inhibition ranged from 23. 6 % for L. theobromae to 72. 4 % for P. viticola. Inhibition by non-volatile products was less than for the volatile inhibition. Inhibition ranged from 7. 5 % for N. parvum to 20. 6 % for L. theobromae. In the non-volatile inhibition USPP-T 1 caused significantly more mycelial inhibition than USPP-T 2. The timing of <b>pruning</b> <b>wound</b> treatment and subsequent penetration and colonisation of the wound site was also determined. One-year-old canes of the Shiraz and Chenin blanc cultivars were grown in a hydroponic system, pruned and spray treated with a spore suspension of Trichoderma atroviride (USPP-T 1) as well as a fluorescent pigment. On intervals 1, 3, 5 and 7 days after treatment, the distal nodes were removed and dissected longitudinally. From the one half, isolations were made at various distances from the pruning surface, while the other half was observed under ultra-violet light to determine the depth of fluorescent pigment penetration. Shortly after spray-inoculation of a fresh <b>pruning</b> <b>wound,</b> Trichoderma was isolated only from the wound surface and shallow depths into the wound (2 to 5 mm). One week after inoculation, Trichoderma was isolated at 10 mm depths, and after 2 weeks, at 15 mm depths. Fluorescent pigment particles were observed to a mean depth of 6 mm, which suggests that initial isolation of Trichoderma at these depths was resultant of the physical deposition of conidia deeper into the <b>pruning</b> <b>wound</b> tissue, whereas the isolation of Trichoderma from deeper depths might be attributed to colonisation of grapevine tissue. In a vineyard trial, fluorescent pigment was spray-applied to pruning wounds of Shiraz and Chenin blanc grapevines during July and September at intervals 0, 1, 3, 7 and 14 days after pruning. One week after treatment, the distal nodes were removed and dissected longitudinally. Each half was observed under UV light and the pigment penetration measured. For Chenin blanc and Shiraz, July pruning wounds showed significant deeper penetration of the pigment than pruning wounds treated in September. Moreover, pruning wounds made in September showed pigment particles in longitudinal sections up to 1 day after pruning, whereas wounds made in July showed pigment particles up to 3 days in the xylem vessels. These findings suggest that the best time for application of a biological control agent should be within the first 24 hours after pruning...|$|E

40|$|Colonisation of <b>pruning</b> <b>wounds</b> made by {{the removal}} of small ( 25 mm) {{branches}} leaving three different stub lengths (0, 15, and 30 cm), in spring, summer, autumn, and winter, was studied in a 4 -year-old stand of Eucalyptus delegatensis R. T. Baker in Kaingaroa State Forest. Isolations were made from all pruned branch stubs. Of the 288 trees examined, 46 % had visible rot and a further 29 % showed discoloration of the sapwood indicating {{an early stage of}} decay. In most of these trees, the rot-inducing fungi had gained entry through branches which had died through suppression. Of the experimentally pruned branches, the largest proportion with rot were those flush-pruned in spring and summer (eight and five respectively out of 24); only one of the autumn flush-pruned and none of the winter flush-pruned branches had rot. At the end of 12 months, 27. 4 % of the isolates from experi-mentally pruned branch stubs were of fungi capable of causing decay. The most common rot fungus isolated was Stereum purpureum (Pers, ex Fr.) Fr., which formed 12. 4 % {{of the total number of}} isolates.

Inoculations of pruning wounds made in two consecutive winters by suspensions of conidia of P. chlamydosporum and P. aleophilum showed that both fungi were able to invade through wounds during winter. Infections varied with pruning date and age of <b>pruning</b> <b>wound,</b> but were more serious and of longer duration with early pruning (December, January). Trapping studies showed that spores of P. chlamydosporum were captured throughout the whole year, while spores of P. aleophilum were mostly trapped during the vegetative period. Microscopic examination of adhesive tape applied to without bark zones of the canes showed the presence of conidia of P. aleophilum. From these studies, it emerged that only P. chlamydosporum is able to contaminate pruning wounds during winter. P. chlamydosporum and P. aleophilum may be propagated by infected canes in the nursery.

40|$|Eutypa lata and Phaeomoniella chlamydospora, as well {{as several}} species in Botryosphaeriaceae, Phomopsis and Phaeoacremonium are known trunk {{pathogens}} of grapevines, which use pruning wounds as infection portals. Duration of <b>pruning</b> <b>wound</b> susceptibility to some of these pathogens was largely unknown. To address this question, plants of the cv.

Eight months after inoculation, pathogen incidence in the treated wounds was determined by means of isolation from the pith and xylem tissue of treated plants. Lesions observed in these tissues were also measured and recorded. Results indicated that, irrespective of pathogen inoculated, pathogen incidence in the inoculated pruning wounds of both mid- and late winter declined with increasing wound age. The rate of decline was much slower in 2004 compared to 2005; however, wounds remained susceptible for 3 or more weeks after pruning in both years.

Eutypa lata, when inoculated onto wounds of vines in a mature vineyard (cv. Shiraz) and on detached canes (cv.

To evaluate the effect of water stress on infection of grapevines by Botryosphaeriaceae spp., 1 -year-old Shiraz/ 101 - 14 Mgt nursery grapevine plants were planted in plastic potting bags and placed outdoors under shade netting. Five weeks after planting, vines were pruned and the <b>pruning</b> <b>wounds</b> inoculated with spore suspensions of Neofusicoccum australe, Neofusicoccum parvum, Lasiodiplodia theobroma e or Diplodia seriata. Control treatments consisted of applications of sterile water or a Trichoderma harzianum spore suspension. Stem inoculations were done by inserting a colonised or uncolonised agar plug into a wound made in each stem. Four different irrigation regimes were introduced 12 weeks after planting to simulate varying degrees of water stress. Measurements of stomatal conductance, photosynthetic rate and leaf spectrometry were made to monitor physiological stress. Eight months after inoculation, vines were uprooted and the root, shoot and plant mass of each vine determined. Lesions observed in the inoculated <b>pruning</b> <b>wounds</b> and stems were also measured. Vines subjected to the lowest irrigation regime were significantly smaller than optimally irrigated vines. Water stressed vines also had significantly lower photosynthetic rates and levels of stomatal conductance compared with vines receiving optimal irrigation, indicating that these plants experienced significantly higher levels of physiological stress. The mean lesion length was significantly longer in the <b>pruning</b> <b>wounds</b> and stems of plants subjected to the lowest irrigation regime, with lesion length declining linearly with increasing irrigation volume.

A single wound was made on each shoot and fruitlet. Cankers on shoots and brown areas on fruits caused by successful infection were observed, respectively, 20 and 8 days af-ter contamination at 25 Â± 2 Â°C. The shoot wounds were progressively less competent for infection as the inter-val increased between wounding and contamination. The largest reduction in competence occurred in the first 24 h after wounding (from 80 - 85 % successful in-fections to approximately 10 - 20 %). The pear shoot pruning wounds were still competent after 48 h and up to 60 h, although less than 5 % of inoculations were successful.
