40|$|Vanadium is an {{important}} industrial metal that is mostly used as an alloying element in steel {{and to a lesser}} extent in titanium. It is generally produced in combination with other metals such as iron, titanium, and uranium. The typical production method begins with salt roasting of the ore or concentrate to produce a water soluble form of vanadium. Then the vanadium is leached, purified and precipitated as vanadium pentoxide. Most of the vanadium pentoxide produced is then combined with iron to create a ferrovandium alloy, via aluminothermic reduction, that is suitable for the iron and steel industry for alloying. Vanadium is also found in crude oil in a range that can vary from 10 to 1400 ppm depending on the location. As the oil is processed and refined the vanadium becomes enriched. Specifically it is enriched in the fly ash of heavy fuel oil power plants. While the original concentration of vanadium in oil is very small the amount of oil extracted from the earth is very large and this makes fly ash a significant source of vanadium. The vanadium that is contained in the heavy oil fly ash can be recovered by two general methods: hydrometallurgical and pyrometallurgical. The hydrometallurgical route usually involves leaching, purification, and precipitation to produce V 2 O 5. This V 2 O 5 can then be used to produce ferrovanadium. The developmental pyrometallurgical route directly uses the fly ash in combination with a reductant (C, Al, or Si) and a source of iron to produce a ferrovanadium alloy. This thesis investigates one <b>pyrometallurgical</b> <b>method,</b> which uses two industrial waste products, heavy fuel oil fly ash and basic oxygen furnace dust, to produce a ferrovanadium alloy. The carbon contained within the fly ash is used as the reductant so only fluxing agents must be added to the charge. The result is a very efficient process that requires very few virgin raw materials. The results show that a ferrovanadium alloy with 15 % vanadium can be produced by high temperature smelting of heavy oil fly ash and basic oxygen furnace dust. There are some impurities that remain in the metal, mainly nickel (~ 4 %), sulfur (~ 5 %), and carbon (~ 1. 5 %). The carbon to metal ratio had the largest effect on the final metal quality. The slag quality is also important to the final quality but more work must be done in this area. Simple water leaching tests were done on the as-received fly ash and the slag produced from smelting. The leach solution produced from the slag contained 100 times less metals than the solution produced from the as-received fly ash. Section Resource EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E

40|$|The {{extraction}} of copper from chalcopyrite has for centuries {{been limited to}} <b>pyrometallurgical</b> <b>methods.</b> Smelting of chalcopyrite is an efficient process but costly {{both in terms of}} capital investment, operating costs and environmental compliance. Biological extraction appeared as an appealing alternative. Unfortunately, traditional mesophilic biological extraction methods have met with little success. The chalcopyrite quickly becomes passivated and unacceptable copper extractions are achieved. It was not until the adoption of thermophilic systems that the biological leaching of chalcopyrite became a reality. Several questions remain as to the applicability of the thermophilic system for chalcopyrite; can the system operate auto-thermally; can reasonable extraction rates be achieved; is the process sensitive to mineralogy or grade; and can the precious metals be recovered? GeoBiotics, LLC has embarked on an extensive program to develop the GEOCOAT bioleaching system to chalcopyrite ores. This program encompasses mathematical heap modeling, laboratory amenability and column tests, and large-scale field trials.

40|$|Sulphuric acid {{pressure}} leaching of limonitic laterites is {{the process}} of choice to recover nickel and cobalt from equatorial lateritic ores, replacing the energy intensive <b>pyrometallurgical</b> <b>methods..</b> This process achieves a high nickel and cobalt extraction more than 95 % with a high selectivity due to simultaneous iron and aluminium dissolution and precipitation.

Raw limonite and the evolution of the nature of solid products during leaching were characterised using transmission electron microscopy. It was observed that limonite consists of aggregates of needle-like particles of goethite compacted together. Nickel was found to be predominately associated with this phase. During leaching, goethite dissolves continuously liberating nickel whilst iron re-precipitates as dense hematite particles in solution by ex situ precipitation.

Typical catalytic converter is built from the metallic or ceramic carrier with porous structure covered with the PGM metals especially platinum, palladium and rhodium.

Design/methodology/approach: This work presents method of PGM metals recovery from auto catalytic converters by means of solving them in the liquid metal. Liquid metal is put in motion using magneto-hydrodynamic pump, and then the PGM metals are eluted from channels of the used auto catalytic converters. Findings: All over the world the used auto catalytic converters are preceded by the use of pyrometallurgical, hydrometallurgical or mixed methods. Each method has some disadvantages. <b>Pyrometallurgical</b> <b>methods</b> need to use units which assure the necessary temperature. This is as expensive as energy consuming.

40|$|As {{requested}} by the US Congress, a roadmap has been established for development of ATW Technology. The roadmap defines a reference system along with preferred technologies which require further development to reduce technical risk, associated deployment scenarios, and a detailed plan of necessary R and D to support implementation of this technology. Also, the potential for international collaboration is discussed which {{has the potential to}} reduce the cost of the program. In addition, institutional issues are described that must be addressed in order to successfully pursue this technology, and the benefits resulting from full implementation are discussed. This report uses as its reference a fast spectrum liquid metal cooled system. Although Lead-Bismuth Eutectic is the preferred option, sodium coolant is chosen as the reference (backup) technology because it represents the lowest technical risk and an excellent basis for estimating the life cycle cost of the systems exists in the work carried out under DOE's ALMR (PRISM) program. Metal fuel and associated pyrochemical treatment is assumed. Similarly a linear accelerator has been adopted as the reference. A reference ATW plant was established to ensure consistent discussion of technical and life cycle cost issues. Over 60 years of operation, the reference ATW plant would process about 10, 000 tn of spent nuclear reactor fuel. This is in comparison to the current inventory of about 40, 000 tn of spent fuel and the projected inventory of about 86, 000 tn of spent fuel if all currently licensed nuclear power plants run until their license expire. The reference ATW plant was used together with an assumed scenario of no new nuclear plant orders in the US to generate the deployment scenario for ATW. In the R and D roadmap, key technical issues are identified and timescales proposed for the resolution of these issues. For the accelerator the main issue is the achievement of the necessary reliability in operation. To avoid frequent thermal transients and maintain grid stability the accelerator must reach levels of performance never previously required. For the target material the main technical choice is between solid or liquid targets. This issue is interlocked with the choice of coolant. Lead-Bismuth eutectic is potentially a superior choice for both these missions but represents a path with greater technical risk. For the blanket metal fuel has been selected. The reference method of processing of spent fuel from LWRs to provide the input material for ATW is chosen to be aqueous because of the large quantity of uranium that needs to be brought to a state that it can be treated as Class C waste. Again this is the path of least technical risk although the pyrometallurgical option will be pursued as an alternative. Processing of the fuel after irradiation in ATW will be undertaken using <b>pyrometallurgical</b> <b>methods.</b> The transmutation of Tc and I represents a special research issue and various options will be pursued to achieve these goals. Finally the system as a whole will need optimization from a reactivity and power control perspective.

40|$|Due {{to rapid}} {{industrialization}} {{the demand for}} heavy metals is ever increasing, but the reserves of high-grade ores are diminishing. Therefore {{there is a need}} to explore alternative sources of heavy metals. The rapid industrialization generates a variety of industrial wastes. These industrial wastes possess toxic elements such as heavy metals. Improper disposal of these wastes becomes a key factor in metal contamination and thus when leached into atmosphere cause serious environmental problem. These metals exert wide variety of adverse effects on human being. Some of the metals have extremely long biological half-life that essentially makes it a cumulative toxin. Also some metals are carcinogenic in nature. Among the wastes, electronic scraps, medical waste, metal finishing industry waste, spent petroleum catalysts, battery wastes, fly ash etc., are some of the major industrially produced wastes. These solid wastes mostly contain Au, Ag, Ni, Mo, Co, Cu, Zn, and Cr like heavy metals in it. Hence these waste materials which are causing serious environmental problems, can act as potential source for heavy metals. In this sense these industrial wastes can act as artifitial ores. The valuable metals can be recovered from these industrial wastes. There are varieties of methods in use for recovery of heavy metals. These include pyrometallurgical, hydrometallurgical and bio-hydrometallurgical <b>methods.</b> <b>Pyrometallurgical</b> recovery consists of the thermal treatment of ores and metal containing wastes to bring about physical and chemical transformations. This enables recovery of valuable metals. Calcining, roasting, smelting and refining are the pyrometallurgical processes used for metal recovery. The hydrometallurgical recovery uses mainly the leaching process. It involves the use of aqueous solutions containing a lixiviant which is brought into contact with a material containing a valuable metal. Further the metals are concentrated and purified by using precipitation, cementation, solvent extraction and ion exchange. The metals are finally recovered in pure form by using electrolysis and precipitation methods. Biohydrometallurgy is one of the most promising and revolutionary biotechnologies. This technique exploits microbiological processes for recovery of heavy metal ions. In last few decades the concept of microbiological leaching have played a grate role to recover valuable metals from various sulfide minerals or low grade ores. Now the microbiological leaching process has been shifted for its application to recover valuable metals from the different industrial wastes. There are many microrganisms which play important role in recovery of heavy metals from industrial wastes. Among the bacteria Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans, Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans, Leptospirillum ferrooxidans, and Sulfolobus sp., are well known for the bioleaching activity while Penicillium, and Aspergillus niger are some fungi those help in metal leaching process. The process of recovery makes sense only if the cost of recovery is much less than the value of the precious metal. The restrictions imposed on waste disposal and stringent environmental regulations demand eco-friendly technologies for metal recovery. This paper reports a review of number of industrial processes that generate metal containing waste and the various methods in use for recovery of metals from these wastes. This will help in selection of a proper method for recovery of heavy metals from industrial wastes...|$|R
40|$|NdFeB magnets {{currently}} {{dominate the}} magnet market {{due to their}} superior magnetic properties with maximum volume minimization. NdFeB magnets are composed of 25 - 35 wt. % rare earth elements (REE) along with ca. 1 wt. % B and the rest being transition metals (mainly Fe). REE, other than Nd, such as Dy, Pr, Tb and Gd or exogen elements, other than Fe, such as Al, Co, Ga, Nb, Si, Cu and Zr can also be present as minor admixtures. Depending on the operation medium, these magnets are usually also coated with Ni, Zn, etc. or can be embedded in epoxy. The on-going monopoly of China on REE oxide production {{in the last two}} decades along with continuously increasing demand for REE impose serious supply risks for certain REE (e. g. Nd and Dy). Due to their high REE content along with their increasing production rate, efficient recycling options for pre-consumer and end-of-life (EOL) NdFeB magnets are needed to combat that supply problem. To achieve these goals, 3 different hydrometallurgical or combined hydro- and pyrometallurgical flow sheets have been developed and completed within this thesis. These are namely, (1) Sulfation, Selective Roasting and Water Leaching, (2) Nitration, Calcination and Water Leaching, and (3) Complete Leaching, Iron Removal and Electrolysis. Both of the first two flow sheets were a combination of pyro- and hydrometallurgical methods and enabled > 95 % REE and 90 wt. %). In the third flow sheet, a different and only-hydrometallurgical approach was taken. Here, in addition to previous targets, it was aimed to recover minor but valuable base metals (e. g. Co, Ni and Cu) along with complete recycling of consumed acid and chemicals after electrolysis stage. However, this stage was found to be problematic and not a good candidate for purification of the leachate for REE. Additional steps were studied to overcome these problems and were found to be quite successful. However, the overall flow sheet extended significantly thereby requiring a justification through economic analysis. In the last phase of the doctorate, a separate work flow was studied, namely, (4) Comparative Oxidation Behaviors of Hydrogenated NdFeB Magnets. Here, it was aimed to investigate the thermal oxidation behaviours of differently hydrogenated magnets. Hydrogenation treatments are the most promising methods to physically remove waste NdFeB magnets from their surroundings. The oxidation tendency of the product after such treatments can be of importance for both direct and indirect recycling routes. While the initial composition of the magnet was found to have little or no effect on the oxidation behaviour of both hydrogenated and non-hydrogenated magnets, the hydrogenation treatment type had direct impact via both particle size distribution and oxidation mechanism. Among all 5 hydrogenation treatments, the hydrogenation decrepitation (HD) method was found to be the most effective treatment for subsequent conventional oxidative roasting-acid leaching flow sheet while disproportionated magnets were found to be the most stable powders.

40|$|Critical {{materials}} represent mostly metals {{having a}} big importance {{for the future of}} the economy in the European countries. It is very difficult to replace these critical metals by other metals. Because of their wide application, the demand for these metals is increased, but the production cannot follow their growing consumption. Rare earth elements (REE) belong to critical materials. They include 17 elements, very similar in terms of their chemical and physical properties due to their mineralogical structure (the best-known are lanthanum and thorium, which is radioactive). REE are divided into elements with a lower atomic mass and elements with a higher atomic mass. Heavier metals show a significantly lower presence in the upper earth crust. In 2010, the share of the REE production in China in the global production amounted to 97 %, constituting a near-monopoly in the world market. In different studies, the term “Strategic” is often used instead “of “critical” materials. The materials for military application are called “Strategic” (nickel). In comparison to strategic metals, critical materials have a big importance for the national economies of European countries (platinum group of metals, rare earth elements, cobalt). The European Commission prepared a strategic development plan for critical materials in the next twenty years. The rare earth elements The rare earth elements include 15 elements (Z= 57 through 71) and Yttrium (Z= 39) and scandium. Because of their reactivity and similarity, the REEs were found to be difficult to obtain [...] Lanthanide elements with a low atomic number are generally more abundant in the earth crust than those with high atomic numbers. World demand for rare earth elements is estimated by Humphries (CRS Report for Congress) at 134. 000 tons per year, with the global production of around 114. 000 tons annually. Humphries has reported in 2010 that there is no rare earth mine production in the United States. The major uses for rare earth elements include applications in auto catalysts, petroleum refining, metal alloys, cell phones, portable DVDs, etc. Permanent magnets containing neodymium, gadolinium and dysprosium are used in numerous electrical components and generators for wind turbines. The primary defense application (underwater mine detection, satellite power and communication systems, radar systems,etc.) use new materials: Neodymium Iron Boron, Samarium Cobalt. REEs extraction from monazite is performed by dissolution in a hot concentrated base or acid solutions. After cooling, the hydroxides of REEs and thorium are recovered by filtration, and thorium is separated by dissolution and selective precipitation. Metallurgy of indium   Indium belongs to the group of rare earth elements with a low melting point. Some addition of indium increases the strength, hardness and corrosion resistance of alloys. The most known producers are situated in Belgium, Canada, Russia, France and Japan. Indium is used as coating on metals applied in difficult operation conditions, and in semiconductor techniques for the production of diodes. It is formed as a semi-product after pyrometallurgical and hydrometallurgical treatment of sulphidic raw materials. Indium can be used with other valuable metals such as vanadium, thallium, gallium, germanium, and cadmium. The coating process based on Indium is performed by an electrolytic treatment on the surface.   Metallurgy of yttrium Yttrium compounds found interesting application in many fields. In particular, yttrium is used in the manufacture of superconductors, in super alloys of nickel and cobalt, and solid oxide fuel cells. Yttrium oxide has a high melting point and is used in ceramics. The compounds of yttrium are also used as catalysts. The growing industrial application of the rare earth elements led to a growing interest in finding new technologies for their recoveries. The selective dissolution of yttrium from lanthanum is performed by ammonium carbonate leaching. Conclusion The EU Raw materials Initiative was decided to identify a list of critical raw materials at the EU level. The EU-report describes a selection of 41 minerals and metals. Then, 14 elements were chosen as critical materials fort the economy of the European countries in the next twenty years. The future use of REEs is expected to be increased in the European countries. About 90 % of metal alloys are produced in China. The price of rare earth elements is reduced for the consumers in China in comparison to some companies in the USA and Europe. Therefore, the European countries and the USA have protested against this situation. The selective winning of rare earth elements is the most important aim in the processing of raw materials. The combination of <b>pyrometallurgical</b> and hydrometallurgical <b>methods</b> might be a new way of solving this problem in the European countries. </div...|$|R
