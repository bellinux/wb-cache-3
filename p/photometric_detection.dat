We also find a spectroscopic orbital frequency in IM Eridani of 6. 86649 (2) c/d. These observations can be reproduced by invoking an accretion disc that is tilted {{with respect to the}} orbital plane. This model works well for X-ray binaries, in which irradiation by a primary neutron star can account for the disc's tilt. A likely tilt mechanism has yet to be identified in CVs, yet the growing collection of observational evidence indicates that the phenomenon of tilt is indeed at work in this class of object. The results presented in this paper bring the number of CVs known to display signals associated with retrograde disc precession to twelve. We also find AQ Mensae to be an eclipsing system. The eclipse depths are highly variable, which suggests that the eclipses are grazing.

The pyrolysates of these kerogens are extremely complex mixtures. The technique with flame <b>photometric</b> <b>detection</b> yields a chromatogram that shows the distribution of only organic sulphur products in the pyrolysates. However, a considerable loss of sensitivity in flame <b>photometric</b> <b>detection</b> was apparent for higher-molecular-weight compounds. The use of the mass spectrometer as a detector, using characteristic m/z values of organic sulphur compounds for appropriate mass chromatograms, was therefore preferable.

40|$|We have {{developed}} a model to predict the post-collision brightness increase of sub-catastrophic collisions between asteroids and to evaluate {{the likelihood of a}} survey detecting these events. It is based on the cratering scaling laws of Holsapple and Housen (2007) and models the ejecta expansion following an impact as occurring in discrete shells each with their own velocity. We estimate the magnitude change between a series of target/impactor pairs, assuming it is given by the increase in reflecting surface area within a photometric aperture due to the resulting ejecta. As expected the photometric signal increases with impactor size, but we find also that the photometric signature decreases rapidly as the target asteroid diameter increases, due to gravitational fallback. We have used the model results to make an estimate of the impactor diameter for the (596) Scheila collision of D= 49 - 65 m depending on the impactor taxonomy, which is broadly consistent with previous estimates. We varied both the strength regime (highly porous and sand/cohesive soil) and the taxonomic type (S-, C- and D-type) to examine the effect on the magnitude change, finding that it is significant at early stages but has only a small effect on the overall lifetime of the photometric signal. Combining the results of this model with the collision frequency estimates of Bottke et al. (2005), we find that low-cadence surveys of approximately one visit per lunation will be insensitive to impacts on asteroids with D< 20 km if relying on <b>photometric</b> <b>detections...</b>|$|R
40|$|We present <b>photometric</b> <b>detections</b> of dust {{emission}} at 850 and 450 !m around the pre-main-sequence M 1 dwarf TWA 7 using the SCUBA {{camera on the}} James Clerk Maxwell Telescope. These data confirm {{the presence of a}} cold dust disk around TWA 7, amember of the TWHydraeAssociation (TWA). Based on the 850 !mflux, we estimate the mass of the disk to be 18 Mlunar (0. 2 M!) assuming amass opacity of 1. 7 cm 2 g" 1 with a temperature of 45 K. Thismakes the TWA 7 disk (d 55 pc) an order of magnitude more massive than the disk reported around AU Microscopii (GL 803), the closest (9. 9 pc) debris disk detected around anM dwarf. This is consistent with TWA 7 being slightly younger than AU Mic. We find that the mid-IR and submillimeter data require the disk to be comprised of dust at a range of temperatures. A model in which the dust is at a single radius from the star, with a range of temperatures according to grain size, is as effective at fitting the emission spectrum as a model in which the dust is of uniform size, but has a range of temperatures according to distance. We discuss this disk in the context of known disks in the TWA and around low-mass stars; a comparison of masses of disks in the TWA reveals no trend in mass or evolutionary state (gas-rich vs. debris) as a function of spectral type.

40|$|The {{directly}} detected planetary mass companion candidate {{close to}} the young, nearby star Fomalhaut is a subject of intense discussion. While the detection of common proper motion led to the interpretation as Jovian-mass companion, later non-detections in the infrared raised doubts. Recent astrometric measurements indicate a belt crossing or highly eccentric orbit for the object, if a companion, making the planetary interpretation potentially even more problematic. In this study we discuss the possibility of Fomalhaut b being a background object with a high proper motion. By analysing the available photometric and astrometric data of the object, we {{show that they are}} fully consistent with a neutron star: Neutron stars are faint, hot (blue), and fast moving. Neutron stars with an effective temperature of the whole surface area being 112, 000 K to 126, 500 K (with small to negligible extinction) at a distance of roughly 11 pc (best fit) would be consistent with all observables, namely with the <b>photometric</b> <b>detections</b> in the optical, with the upper limits in the infrared and X-rays, {{as well as with the}} astrometry (consistent with a distances of 11 pc or more and high proper motion as typical for neutron stars) as well as with non-detection of pulsation (not beamed). We consider the probability of finding an unrelated object or even a neutron star nearby and mostly co-aligned in proper motion with Fomalhaut A and come to the conclusion that this is definitely well possible.

40|$|The {{detection}} of shadow and shading edges {{is a first}} step towards reducing the imaging effects that are caused by interactions of the light source with surfaces that are in the scene. As most of the algorithms for shadow edge <b>detection</b> use <b>photometric</b> information, geometric information have been ignored so far. In this paper, the aim is to include geometric features for more robust shadow edge detection. First, thousands of patches are annotated as either containing a shadow edge or not. Then, geometric features of these patches are analyzed and it is shown that the combination of photometric and geometric features improves the classification of shadow edges with respect to using either one of these features with 14 %. These results demonstrate the added value of geometric features, in addition to photometric features, for the {{detection of}} shadow edges.
