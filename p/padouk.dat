50|$|Forestry was {{the primary}} source of {{economic}} activity in the country until 1968, when the industry was supplanted by crude oil as an earner of foreign exchange. Gabon is the largest exporter of raw wood in the region, and its sales represent 20% of Africa’s raw wood exports. Forestry is second only to the petroleum sector in export earnings, at $319.4 million in 2003. Gabon’s reserves of exploitable timber include: okoumé, 100 million cubic meters; ozigo, 25-35 million cubic meters; ilomba, 20-30 million cubic meters; azobé, 15-25 million cubic meters; and <b>padouk,</b> 10-20 million cubic meters.|$|E
50|$|Two {{theories}} {{exist for}} that obvious change in production: quick-grown wood (therefore not giving {{the time for}} the wood to age naturally and achieve the full density that padauk would naturally acquire over time) or a change in the wood species (African padauk for the first models, Indian padauk for the later ones). Another reason for the difference in color is the oxidation of the reddish pigments in <b>padouk</b> wood by UV light over time. All padauk darkens with age from a red/orange to a deep purplish brown, and the time between runs likely contributes to the differentiation in color.|$|E
50|$|Thomas Chippendale (1718 - 1779) {{was born}} in Otley in the West Riding of Yorkshire, England in June 1718. He became a cabinet-maker in London, {{designing}} furniture in the mid-Georgian, English Rococo, and Neoclassical styles. In 1754 he published a book of his designs, titled The Gentleman and Cabinet Maker's Director, upon which success he became renowned. The designs are regarded as reflecting the current British fashion for furniture of that period and are today reproduced globally. He was buried 16 November 1779, according to the records of St Martin-in-the-Fields, in the cemetery since built upon by the National Gallery.

GoldTone makes the MB-850+ Mandolin-Banjo, with a removable maple resonator (converting the instrument to an open-backed instrument). The selection is not large and the instruments are not common in stores. Morgan Monroe has recently made three models, the MM-MB1 Mandolin Banjo the MM-MB2 Mandolin Banjo, and the Banjolin DLX (8 strings). The Morgan Monroe banjos look like traditional mandolin-banjos and have wooden resonators. The Cumbus model has a spun aluminum resonator. Prices currently range from around US $150 to US $700. In Italy, Musikalia manufactures three models of Mandolin Banjo, always with wooden resonator (mahogany, <b>padouk</b> or maple root wood veneered), animal skin, but gives an alternative between simple or double aluminium ring.|$|E

[...] He periodically capitalized on grain patterns, intensive figure, and contrasting heartwood and sapwood colors as design elements in his works. [...] Silver components occasionally were added to functional wooden works, and he made a few cheese boards with flat ceramic inserts as cutting surfaces. [...] He was frugal with wood and used scraps to make saleable functional and art objects. Cutouts from large bowl forms, for example, were used to make fish, birds, and abstract sculptures, and the remaining pieces were used to make small salt bowls and spoons.|$|E

50|$|The {{majority}} of material comprising a modern guitar is still wood. Typical woods {{used for the}} body and neck of a guitar today are Mahogany, Ash, Maple, Basswood, Agathis, Alder, Poplar, Walnut, Spruce, and holly. Woods {{from around the world}} are also incorporated into modern acoustic and electric guitars. Some of these exotic tone woods include Koa, Rosewood, Bubinga, Korina, Lacewood, Zebrawood, <b>Padouk,</b> Redwood, and Wenge. With modern manufacturing techniques almost any wood can be used if it can be obtained in an acceptable quantity. Abundance, however, is not the only characteristic taken into consideration during the selection of a type of wood. Woods have unique acoustic properties and produce different sounds and resonances at different frequencies and points. Wood grain, pattern and defects (understand defects as genetic defects of the tree like quilt, flame...) also are factors that contribute to the beautification of the instrument and thus, to increase the sales. This happens specially on guitar tops or veneers.|$|E

The antioxidant activities were evaluated using the scavenging of 2 - 2 -diphenyl- 1 -picrylhydrazyl radical (DPPH.) and the oxygen uptake method. The total phenolic content (TPC) was evaluated {{according to the}} Folin-Ciocalteu assay in which gallic acid was used as standard. Condensed tannins were evaluated by using the Stiasny method. Chemical compositions of the extracts were evaluated by GC-MS. The results show that toluene/ethanol extracts from tali (Erythrophleum suaveolens) exhibit the highest antioxidant activity with CE 50 value of 3. 1 mg/L followed by movingui (Distemonanthus benthamianus) extracts (CE 50 value 3. 9 mg/L), <b>padouk</b> (Pterocarpus soyauxii Taubb) and moabi (Baillonella toxisperma) (CE 50 value of 5. 5 mg/L and 44 mg/L respectively). The TPC and condensed tannins of extracts were {{in the range of}} 54 - 992 mg eq. gallic acid/g of extract and 8 - 60 %, respectively. Homopterocarpin and pterocarpin were the major compounds found in the extracts of <b>padouk.</b> Catechin, gallic acid, and pyrogallol were the major compounds identified in tali extracts.

40|$|International audienceThe {{present study}} {{consists}} {{in studying the}} initiation and propagation of cracks at room temperature of three tropical species: Okume (Aucoumea Klaineana), Iroko (Pterocarpus Soyauxii) and <b>Padouk</b> (Malicia Excelsa). A short {{review of the literature}} shows that only few studies dealing with the fracture mechanics properties of this type of wood species are available. Similar studies are however routinely performed on temperate wood species such as Beech and Douglas, using mixed-mode crack growth (MMCG) specimens for instance [1, 2]. In this paper, tropical wood specimens are studied using the grid method [3] and such MMCG specimens, but made of the three aforementioned tropical species. This paper describes the wood specimens, which are subjected to an opening mode, the experimental device and the background of the grid technique used for tracking the location of the crack tip during the test. The origin and characteristics of the tropical wood species studied here are also given. The experimental results are given and compared in terms of force-displacement curves, but also in terms of energy release rate-crack length curves. Typical MMCG specimens made of each of the three different species are shown in Figure 1. The main difference between the three species is their density: Okume (density = 0. 44) is less dense than Iroko (density = 0. 64) and <b>Padouk</b> (density = 0. 79). For all the specimens, the initial crack length is the same: a= 20 mm. It is located at mid-height and oriented along the fiber direction, which is horizontal here. The initial crack is completed by a notch (length: 2 mm) made with a cutter in order to initiate correctly crack propagation. A grid, with a regular pitch of 200 microns, was transferred on one face of the specimens, see Figure 1 (d). The technique presented in [4] is used for this purpose. Figure 1. Wooden specimens: Okume (a), Iroko (b), <b>Padouk</b> (c) and the specimen Iroko equipped grid (d). The experimental device is shown in Figure 2. A 200 kN Zwick / Roel testing machine was used for the tests. A camera was fixed on a tripod at a distance of 67. 5 cm from the specimens in order to take images of the grid during the tests...|$|E

40|$|The {{possibility}} of supplementing the subjective traditional assessment of wood quality for percussion instruments with reliable acoustic measurements was studied. Sawn boards of African <b>padouk</b> (Pterocarpus soyauxii Taub.) were selected in a timber yard and classified into five grades {{by using the}} dynamic combined specific modulus of elasticity. Then they were sawn into raw xylophone bars, which were afterwards traditionally graded by listening to the sound damping at flexural bending excitation and additionally by acoustic measurements. A high quality grade matching of xylophone bars and sawn boards was confirmed. Highly graded material was mostly quarter sawn with straight or moderately interlocked grain. The sound quality of raw xylophone bars was not influenced by the wood density. It negatively correlated with sound damping (tan %) and positively with the specific modulus of elasticity and with absolute and relative acoustic conversion efficiency. The audial grading of xylophone bars could be improved or substituted by relative acoustic conversion efficiency...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{fracture}} {{processes of}} three tropical species: Aucoumea klaineana, Malicia excelsa and Pterocarpus soyauxii, 6 are investigated with the grid method. These species {{are widely used}} in many subtropical countries, in timber building 7 construction, {{as well as in}} semi-finished products and paper fabrication. However their fracture behaviour must still be 8 investigated, data being scarcely available on this subject. Modified Mixed Mode Crack Growth specimens are used in order 9 to obtain a stable crack growth evolution in opening, shear and mixed mode ratios. The images of the grid are analysed to 10 provide the crack opening displacement and the crack tip location. The stress intensity factors and the critical energy release 11 rates for each species are then obtained by using the compliance method in imposed displacement. The semi-experimental 12 energetic method is also applied in order to show the efficiency of the proposed technique to characterize the fracture 13 properties of the tropical species under study. 14 Keywords Mixed mode crack growth • Tropical wood species • Compliance method • Grid method 15 2. 1 Introduction 16 Today, wood is one of the solutions that sustainably limits global warming of our planet AU 1. In Central Africa and particularly in 17 equatorial regions, the forest {{plays a key role in}} this regulation. In the case of Gabon, the recent decision of stopping the 18 exportation of tropical species has opened the way to their local extension and to their more widespread use in local 19 individual and industrial buildings. However, the mechanical behavior of local species largely depends on temperature and 20 humidity variations, which can impair their structural efficiency, and thus lead to sudden failure during their service life. 21 Studying failure of tropical wood is crucial to know their behavior and guide local people in their choice of building 22 materials other than concrete and steel. This would also contribute to the sustainable development discussed during the 23 COP 21 meeting in Paris last year [1]. 24 This paper is focused on the study of the initiation and the crack propagation at room temperature of the following tropical 25 species: Iroko (Pterocarpus soyauxii), <b>Padouk</b> (Malicia excelsa) and Okume (Aucoumea klaineana). A short review of the 26 literature shows that few studies and data related to failure of this type of wood material are available. Similar studies 27 deal with temperate species as Douglas, Maritime pine and Abies Alba mills, using Compact Tension Shear (CTS) 28 specimens [2 – 4], Double Cantilever Beam (DCB) specimens [5], Mixed Mode Crack Growth (MMCG) [6] specimens 29 and TDCB specimens [7].

40|$|According {{to recent}} data (GLC 2000 map), African dense forests cover c. 236 million ha, that is 7. 9 % {{of the total}} {{continent}} area. The Central African forest is the last contiguous block of tropical forest in Africa; it covers an area of c. 203 million ha, whereas the forest cover of West Africa (c. 10 million ha) is highly fragmented. At {{the fringes of the}} Congo Basin, forests are replaced by woodlands and shrublands, mixed in some places with croplands. Woodlands and shrublands together cover 27 % of the continent, while grasslands represent 15 % of the land. The largest desert in the world is the Sahara desert that covers an area of c. 900 million ha or 33 % of the African continent. Agricultural activities extend over 12 % of the continent. The area of cropland is more important in West Africa than in Central Africa, respectively 16 % and 7 %. Closely related to agriculture, the deforestation rate is higher in West Africa (1. 7 % versus 0. 4 %). The other causes of deforestation are logging, mining activities, infrastructure development and fires. The most forested countries of the continent are: Central African Republic (c. 8 million ha), Gabon (c. 21 million ha), Cameroon (c. 21 million ha), Congo (c. 26 million ha) and D. R. Congo (c. 125 million ha). These five countries account for 85 % of the African dense forest. In Central Africa, 45 % of the total forest area is under a logging concession status. As a consequence, logging activities {{play a major role in}} the Central African rainforest’s future. According to the ITTO (International Tropical Timber Organization) figures, in 2003 the estimated productions of the five previously mentioned countries were: c. 7. 4 million m 3 of logs; c. 1. 1 million m 3 of sawn wood; c. 380, 000 m 3 of plywood and veneer, that is less than 1 % of the world production. Logging in Central Africa is characterized by its high selectivity. For economic reasons, only a few species are commercialized. Usually only one to two trees are felled per hectare and the cover disturbance is about 10 %. The most felled species can be grouped in two categories: hygrophilous evergreen rain forest species and moist semi-evergreen rain forest species. The first category is mainly composed of azobe Lophira alata, beli Julbernardia pellegriniana, douka Tieghemella africana, kevazingo Guibourtia spp., okoume Aucoumea klaineana, pachyloba Afzelia pachyloba, tali Erythrophleum ivorense. The second category is made up of afromosia Pericopsis elata, agba Prioria balsamifera, ayous Triplochyton scleroxylon, dibetou Lovoa trichiloides, frake Terminalia superba, iroko Milicia excelsa, kossipo Entandrophragma candollei, moabi Baillonella toxisperma, movingui Distemonanthus benthamianus, <b>padouk</b> Pterocarpus soyauxii, sapelli Entandrophragma cylindricum, sipo Entandrophragma utile. The major forest companies in the region are mostly subsidiaries of larger European firms (French, German, etc.) although Asian business is becoming more and more important. Obliged by the recent evolution of the Central African forestry laws, some of these logging companies are conceiving forest management plans. The management methods currently implemented were developed as normative regulations issued under the forest laws in the region. The basis of these methods is a statistical inventory of the resources which allows the determination of the population structures, i. e. the number of stems per diameter class. Considering increment and mortality, rotation and/or minimum felling diameters are adapted to reach a satisfactory reconstitution rate. Unfortunately, undamental knowledge about the species population dynamic parameters is still lacking and finally the precision on the rate of reconstitution after a cutting cycle is jeopardized. Moreover, these methods do not pay any attention to long-term preservation of the logged species, since species could have a satisfactory level of reconstitution after one rotation, but could disappear after a second cycle. For such species specific interventions are needed to improve their natural regeneration capacities. In this paper, examples are given for a 176, 000 ha management unit in Cameroon for flagship species: assamela Pericopsis elata, ayous Triplochyton scleroxylon, iroko Milicia excelsa, moabi Baillonella toxisperma, sapelli Entandrophragma cylindricum and tali Erythrophleum ivorense. The obtained results attest the need to implement sylvicultural techniques in order to maintain the production capacity of the African rain forests, this production capacity being the best guarantee for the preservation of their integrity.
