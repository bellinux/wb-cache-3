40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{parent-child}} {{survey is}} to investigate how television advertising is related to children’s <b>purchase</b> <b>requests,</b> materialism, disappointment, life dissatisfaction, and family conflict. In a first step, a conceptual model based on existing hypotheses was developed, and in a second step, this model was tested using a sample of 360 parent-child (8 - to 12 -year-olds) dyads. Using structural equation modeling, the findings show that advertising is positively and directly related to children’s <b>purchase</b> <b>requests</b> and materialism. It is also positively, though indirectly (mediated by advertising-induced <b>purchase</b> <b>requests),</b> related to family conflict, disappointment, and life dissatisfaction. Parent-child consumer communication and parental mediation of advertis-ing are important moderators {{of the effects of}} advertising on children’s pur-chase requests and materialism...|$|R

[...] This {{study found that the}} FITD technique was more effective than any of the incentive strategies in producing behavioural persistence. This is supported by the self-perception theory, which states that the FITD {{technique is}} effective only because internal thoughts are what drive peoples' behaviour. That is, external pressure (such as indebtedness) for compliance is not as effective in increasing compliance.|$|E
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} unlimitedA recent audit by the Department of Defense Inspector General (DODIG) of Navy inventory control points found {{a high value}} of <b>purchase</b> <b>requests</b> for repairable items that the auditors labeled as unnecessary or excessive. The dollar figures reported {{were based on the}} auditors' use of stratified sampling. This thesis examined the auditors' use of stratified sampling by attempting to replicate the auditors' process of stratifying and sampling. The author then attempted to verf the auditors' claimed confidence level and precision of the final result. This study questions the chosen sample size and sample stratification. In addition, this thesis found that the auditors' actual precision was not as tight as stated in the DODIG audit report. This was caused by the auditors' emphasis on the very high dollar value strata which had only a few <b>purchase</b> <b>requests</b> rather than on the stratum with the largest number of <b>purchase</b> <b>requests.</b> It was this latter stratum which had the highest projected number and total dollar value of excesses.

50|$|At {{the end of}} the Second World War, it {{was clear}} that the mix of tanks in service with the Swedish Armed Forces was not just {{obsolete}} but also presented a large logistical problem. Kungliga Arméförvaltningens Tygavdelning (KAFT, the weapons bureau of the army administrative service) conducted a study that concluded that the most cost-effective alternative would be to purchase the newly developed Centurion Mk 3, which, while quite modern, was judged to also have upgrade potential for future requirements. A <b>purchase</b> <b>request</b> was sent to Great Britain, but the reply was that no deliveries could be made before the needs of the British Army had been satisfied, which was deemed to take between five and 15 years. Thus, in 1951, the vehicle bureau of KAFT was set to develop a Swedish alternative project, E M I L. Parallel with this, negotiations were initiated with France about buying the AMX-13.|$|E

Benrus quoted a unit price of $28.28. Bulova alleged that Benrus merely imported cases and sold watch movements from foreign sources. Benrus’ documents were submitted and showed that it imported the movement and dial setting, dial stem and springbars and that the case, crown, attachments, packaging material, and jewel bearings were all domestically produced. The costs of the domestic components were in excess of 50 percent of the costs, meeting the requirement.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. A {{growing number}} of {{companies}} are outsourcing their purchasing processes to independent purchasing agencies. These agencies now have to process an ever increasing number of <b>purchase</b> <b>requests</b> each day. The conven-tional methods of selecting the right suppliers for the <b>purchase</b> <b>requests</b> incur heavy human and time costs. We have designed and implemented BestChoice, a decision support system for supplier selection. It allows the evaluator to cre-ate rules for supplier evaluation based on the Multi Attribute Utility Theory, a theory for evaluating the utility of alternatives. BestChoice provides rule struc-tures that can be saved and reused for similar selection cases. The architecture and selection rules of BestChoice are presented.

We believe that the combination of views and interaction capabilities in SellTrend provides an innovative approach to this problem and to other similar types of multivariate, temporally-driven transaction data analysis.

40|$|Objectives: To assess {{exposure}} to marketing of unhealthy food products {{and its relation}} to food related behavior and BMI in children aged 3 – 13, from different socioeconomic backgrounds in a south Indian town. Methods: Child-parent pairs (n = 306) were recruited at pediatric clinics. Exposure to food marketing was assessed by a digital logo recognition test. Children matched 18 logos of unhealthy food (high in fat/sugar/salt) featured in promotion material from the food industry to pictures of corresponding products. Children’s nutritional knowledge, food preferences, <b>purchase</b> <b>requests,</b> eating behavior and socioeconomic characteristics were assessed by a digital game and parental questionnaires. Anthropometric measurements were recorded. Results: Recognition rates for the brand logos ranged from 30 % to 80 %. Logo recognition ability increased with age (p, 0. 001) and socioeconomic level (p, 0. 001 comparing children in the highest and lowest of three socioeconomic groups). Adjusted for gender, age and socioeconomic group, logo recognition was associated with higher BMI (p = 0. 022) and nutritional knowledge (p, 0. 001) but not to unhealthy food preferences or <b>purchase</b> <b>requests.</b> Conclusions: Children from higher socioeconomic groups in the region had higher brand logo recognition ability and are possibly exposed to more food marketing. The study did not lend support to a link between {{exposure to}} marketing and poor eating behavior, distorted nutritional knowledge or increased <b>purchase</b> <b>requests.</b> The correlation between log...|$|R
