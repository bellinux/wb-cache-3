40|$|Abstract- Under an {{increasing}} social demand {{for improving the}} so-called eutrophication problems in stagnant surface waters, {{the development of the}} zeolite for detergent-use was initiated according to the request of the detergent manufacturer. In a cooperative study with the zeolite supplier, the specifications of zeolite suitable to Japanese washing conditions were determined, and {{it was found that the}} acid clay method via activated silicic acid gel is suitable for the manufacturing process because of the economical viability and the quality of zeolite 4 A obtained, which has small uniform-sized particles and high ion-exchange ability. By adding some improvements, specially prepared zeolite slurry was developed, which fulfills the require-ments for the <b>phosphate</b> <b>substitute</b> builder. The related technology required for manufacturing of non-phosphated deter-gent was also developed, particularly on formulation, spray-dry processing and improvement of the final product's physical properties. Thus non-phosphated powder detergents of high-zeolite formulation were successfully introduced since 1980, and owing to their excellent performance properties, the switchover from phosphated detergents to them has almost been corn-pleted by last year in Japan...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn vitro {{studies have}} shown {{promising}} results for balloon-guided inflation tibioplasty. It was our hypothesis that this technique may be safe and effective for use in depressed lateral tibial plateau fracture. We performed a prospective study of all patients suffering from a depressed lateral tibial plateau fracture, managed in our institution with inflation tibioplasty and a resorbable calcium phosphate bone substitute injection, between January 2012 and December 2013. Twenty patients, mean age 54. 3 +/- 12. 8 years, suffering from a depressed lateral tibial plateau fracture (Schatzker type II and III) were included. We then aimed to evaluate at a minimum follow-up of one year: (1) the rate of complications, (2) the clinical outcome (Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome (KOO) and 12 -Item Short Form Health Survey (SF- 12) scores); and (3) the radiographic outcome (evaluated by CT-scan). No peri-operative complications occurred. In one patient, calcium <b>phosphate</b> <b>substitute</b> {{was found in the}} infrapatellar fat pad on post-operative radiography with no clinical or radiographic consequences at one year. At one year after surgery, the KOO subscores were: Pain 80 (range 64 - 93), other symptoms 81. 3 (69 - 93), daily living activities 81. 9 (46 - 99), sport 65. 83 (20 - 100), and quality of life 67. 04 (31 - 100). The SF- 12 activity component was 40. 4 (28. 6 - 52. 2) and SF- 12 mental component 47. 71 (28 - 67. 1). The mean depressed step-off of the lateral joint decreased from 10. 7 +/- 4. 8 mm pre-operatively to 2. 7 +/- 1. 7 mm post-operatively (p < 0. 0001). Our observations suggest that the use of balloon-guided inflation tibioplasty with injection of a resorbable bone substitute is safe, and results in a high rate of anatomic reduction and good clinical outcomes in patients with depressed tibial plateau fractures.

40|$|Studies of {{the effect}} of {{substitution}} with 17 O on the e. p. r. spectra at 9 and 35 GHz of Mo(V) in the phosphate complex of sulphite oxidase are reported. Substitution of 17 O-enriched water for normal water, for samples of the enzymes reduced by sulphite in the presence of normal phosphate, produced no detectable effect on the e. p. r. signal. If <b>phosphate</b> <b>substituted</b> with 17 O was used, coupling due to 17 O, producing large anisotropic splittings in the spectrum, was clearly detectable. It is concluded that phosphate is co-ordinated directly to molybdenum in the active site of the enzyme, in an equatorial type of ligand position. An oxygen ligand must be displaced from the molybdenum in the process of binding the phosphate. Implications concerning the mechanism of the enzyme reactions are discussed...|$|R

40|$|The {{adsorption}} {{and organization}} of reactive microgels has been investigated on technical aluminium. By means of a two-step emulsion polymerisation with <b>phosphate</b> <b>substituted</b> monomer we obtain polymeric nano-particles with phosphate groups on the surface. In a first step cross-linked butyl acrylate/styrene particles were formed. In a second step a mixture of functionalised acrylate and butyl acrylate/styrene {{was added to the}} system. In this way, the composite particles were obtained. Particle size and size distribution were measured by F-FFF and light scattering methods. For phosphate functionalised dispersions, it was possible to show the distribution of P-species around particles by energy dispersive TEM easurements. These nano-particles adsorb spontaneously onto aluminium surfaces from aqeous dispersion. They form well packed layers, which have been proved by SEM measurements. The properties of the adsorbed microgel layers were confirmed by industrial linked adhesion and corrosion tests. Panels with adsorbed phosphate funczionalised particles have an excellent corrosion inhibition effect...|$|R

The compositional and structural changes in the tissue are probed from the enamel surface {{to a depth of}} about 200 3 ̆bcm. These changes reflect the state of tissue development. The subsurface carbonate gradient in the enamel could be observed over the range of about 102 ̆ 013100 3 ̆bcm. The carbonate-to-phosphate ratio increases in the depth profile. The depth profile also reveals changes in the substitutional distribution of carbonate ions.

40|$|To {{reduce the}} {{additional}} sodium hydroxide and ease processing of aluminum bearing sludge, the lithium hydrotalcite (LiHT) {{process has been}} invented by AREV A and demonstrated on a laboratory scale to remove alumina and regenerate/recycle sodium hydroxide prior to processing in the WTP. The method uses lithium hydroxide (LiOH) to precipitate sodium aluminate (NaAI(OH) {sub 4 }) as lithium hydrotalcite (Li{sub 2 }CO{sub 3 }. 4 Al(OH) {sub 3 }. 3 H{sub 2 }O) while generating sodium hydroxide (NaOH). In addition, <b>phosphate</b> <b>substitutes</b> in the reaction to a high degree, also as a filterable solid.
