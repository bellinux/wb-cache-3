2500|$|Even {{after the}} gases abated, rescue teams had {{to proceed with}} caution, {{continually}} testing for hazards such as water seeps, explosive gas concentrations, and unsafe roof conditions. This limited their rate of progress to [...] an hour. They checked in every , and then disconnected their telephones until the next checkpoint {{in order to avoid}} the possibility of a spark creating another explosion. MSHA had deployed a 1,300-lb. (520kg) robot into the mine as well, but <b>pulled</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> after it became mired [...] from the mine entrance.|$|E
2500|$|A strange-looking whale {{can be seen}} {{flying around}} the large statue {{during most of the}} video, {{specifically}} {{at the end of the}} video. The whale in the video was Joe Hahn's idea. He has been quoted as saying, [...] "It's not like I <b>pulled</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> of my ass; it made sense to me." [...] The reasoning behind its inclusion is still unknown. The whale could be identified as a [...] "space whale" [...] which takes the concept that life (or time) is too short for one to absorb all its mass surroundings. The whale also makes a brief appearance in the music video for [...] "Shadow of the Day".|$|E
2500|$|Because the Sword was goblin-forged, it is indestructible, and {{according}} to Griphook the goblin, the Sword was originally forged by the goblin Ragnuk the First and [...] "stolen" [...] by Gryffindor, as The Sword was taken by Griphook when the Sword fell from Harry's grasp during the raid on Bellatrix Lestrange's vault in book seven. The sword returned to wizard hands, when Neville <b>pulled</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> of the Sorting Hat {{and used it to}} decapitate Nagini, Voldemort's snake. This shows that no matter where the sword happened to be at the time, it will reappear in the Hat when a true member of Gryffindor house is in need of it.|$|E

2500|$|The term [...] "foo" [...] was {{borrowed}} from Bill Holman's Smokey Stover by a radar operator in the 415th Night Fighter Squadron, Donald J. Meiers, who (it is agreed by most 415th members) gave the foo fighters their name. Meiers was from Chicago {{and was an}} avid reader of Bill Holman's strip, which was run daily in the Chicago Tribune. Smokey Stover's catch-phrase was [...] "where there's foo, there's fire". In a mission debriefing on the evening November 27, 1944, Fritz Ringwald, the unit's S-2 Intelligence Officer, stated that Meiers and Ed Schleuter had sighted a red ball of fire that appeared to chase them {{through a variety of}} high-speed maneuvers. Fritz said that Meiers was extremely agitated and had a copy of the comic strip tucked in his back pocket. He <b>pulled</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> and slammed it down on Fritz's desk and said [...] "... it was another one of those fuckin' foo fighters!" [...] and stormed out of the debriefing room.|$|E
2500|$|Emanuel Custer was {{an outspoken}} Democrat who taught his {{children}} politics and toughness {{at an early}} age. In a February 3, 1887 letter to his son's widow, Libby, he related an incident [...] "when Autie [...] was about four years old. He {{had to have a}} tooth drawn, [...] and he was very much afraid of blood. When I took him to the doctor to have the tooth pulled, it was in the night and I told him if it bled well it would get well right away, and he must be a good soldier. When he got to the doctor he took his seat, and the pulling began. The forceps slipped off and he had to make a second trial. He <b>pulled</b> <b>it</b> <b>out,</b> and Autie never even scrunched. Going home, I led him by the arm. He jumped and skipped, and said 'Father you and me can whip all the Whigs in Michigan.' I thought that was saying a good deal but I did not contradict him." ...|$|E

5000|$|Another device, used in antiquity, {{was called}} a [...] "water thief" [...] or [...] "clepsydra". Carl Sagan {{described}} it in his book Cosmos as [...] "... a brazen sphere with an open neck and small holes in the bottom, it is filled by immersing it in water. If you <b>pull</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> with the neck uncovered, the water pours out of the holes, making a small shower. But if you <b>pull</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> properly, with the neck covered, the water is retained in the sphere until you lift your thumb." ...|$|R

5|$|Maggie {{asks the}} group for help to remove a bloated walker that fell into a {{freshwater}} well before it contaminates the water.

Meanwhile, Sid, feet still frozen, sulks about being on the Naughty List until Peaches calls on him to snap out of it: she intends {{to head to the}} North Pole with Sid, Crash, and Eddie so as to convince Santa Claus to take Sid off the Naughty List, along with Crash and Eddie, who, despite their misdeeds, still want Christmas.|$|R
