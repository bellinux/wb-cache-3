5|$|On 18 October, the 3rd Battalion of the 26th Infantry Regiment {{prepared}} to assault the Hotel Quellenhof, {{which was one}} of the last areas of resistance in the city.

Just after the 60th minute, Kerala Blasters defender Sandesh Jhingan almost headed the ball into his own net while trying to clear it.

5|$|Despite {{their losses}} the French {{survivors}} {{returned to the}} remaining guns, although most of their first broadside scattered into the sea, and {{at least some of}} their shot was misdirected towards the merchant ships. The French gunners aimed too high however, most of their shot tearing through the rigging of Sybille while the British broadsides slammed into the hull of Forte. This problem was partly attributed to the French gun quoins which had been replaned three days earlier, exacerbated by the lack of suitable gun crews which meant that many of the upperdeck guns were unmanned. The French gunners were also more used to firing warning shots at distant merchant ships and may not have realised that their guns needed to be depressed for combat at <b>point</b> <b>blank</b> range.|$|E

Hoste responded to the attempt with fire at <b>point</b> <b>blank</b> range from a carronade containing over 750 musket balls. The first shot killed Dubourdieu and almost all of his officers, creating confusion in the French squadron that resulted in Favorite being wrecked on Lissa's coastline. Hoste then engaged the following Flore and Bellone, forcing them both to surrender. The head of the British line, led by the HMS Volage engaged the three remaining French and Italian ships, driving off Danaé and Carolina and capturing Corona. Flore too later escaped to the safety of French batteries off Lesina.|$|E
5|$|The Prince {{had reason}} to feel aggrieved by this. He did have large patrimonial estates in the Netherlands that now were forfeit. Besides, {{the loss of his}} {{hereditary}} offices entailed a loss of income. According to his own calculations the arrears in all these incomes since 1795 amounted to 4 million guilders. The Staatsbewind refused to pay this, or any sum, <b>point</b> <b>blank,</b> and the peace treaty specifically exempted the Dutch from paying anything. Instead, an arrangement between the French, British and Prussians (the former stadtholder's champions) in the matter was reached that in return for dropping any and all claims William was to be compensated with the abbatial domains of Fulda and Corvey Abbey (see also Principality of Nassau-Orange-Fulda).|$|E
5|$|The {{battle is}} noted for the heavy death toll among the Dutch commanders. Philip of Nassau was mortally wounded at the {{beginning}} of the action, shot at <b>point</b> <b>blank</b> range through the body with an harquebus, his robes being set on fire. Robert Vere, brother of the English colonel Horace Vere, was slain by a lance thrust in the face. The drossaard of Zallandt and Count Ferdinand Kinsky were also killed. Count Ernst of Solms was seriously wounded and captured. Together with Philip, he was carried to Rheinberg, where both soldiers were visited by Mondragón and their Catholic cousins, the Van den Bergh brothers, and treated by the Spanish surgeons. Despite all the attentions, both Dutch commanders died of the wounds they had sustained; Nassau the night after the battle, and Solms three days later. Count Ernst Casimir was captured and ransomed for 10,000 florins. Mondragón dispatched him to Maurice of Nassau with the bodies of the dead counts, which were buried with honours at Arnhem.|$|E
40|$|Nothing to Declare" {{asks you}} to imagine Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen on safari in Beirut as it follows the trail of an obsessive wannabe design guru {{travelling}} through a middle-eastern war zone looking for inspiration. "Operation Wonderland" (shortlisted for a Critics Circle Award 2004) features an unlikely suicide bomber seeking to live out his fantasies and put a grim end to {{the magic of the}} Disneyesque theme park 'Wonderland', while "Roses and Morphine" sees the memories of war atrocities transformed into corrupted fairy tales in the archive of a mythical library. In his introduction, Professor John Bull contextualises <b>Point</b> <b>Blank's</b> work in the wider tradition and recent history of British political theatre. In accompanying critical essays, the two artistic directors highlight the trilogy's interrogation of postmodern relativism and offer an insight into the company's dramaturgical processes which transform theoretical ideas into mythical scenarios of bleak comic absurdity and visually-striking theatrical metaphor. The performance texts featured in this volume offer a radically new vision of twenty first century theatre. Subversive and satirical, they challenge the prevailing myths and orthodoxies of contemporary culture and late twentieth century performance practice. This definitive publication of <b>Point</b> <b>Blank's</b> early work is essential reading for students, audiences, actors and directors interested in radical new writing for performance. Comprehensive notes are provided to enable a range of potential re-stagings of the texts, and the critical essays offer readers new interpretations of the interplay between contemporary performance practice and the prevailing political climate...|$|R

5|$|The chase {{continued}} through a second night, the French frigate making significant gains over her pursuers but {{still unable to}} escape them completely. At 10:30 on 10 February, two sails appeared in the southeast, set on a course that would cut {{in front of the}} French frigate. These were the British frigate HMS Horatio under Captain George Scott and the brig HMS Driver. With enemies on all sides, Rousseau recognised that his only hope of escape lay in defeating Horatio: a swift victory would enable him to outrun pursuit from the east, travelling westwards into the Atlantic. Rapidly closing with the new arrivals, Junon opened fire at 12:36. Horatio immediately responded and then circled the slower French vessel and raked her before Rousseau could respond. Drawing close, the frigates exchanged broadsides at <b>point</b> <b>blank</b> range for 40 minutes. The heavier weight of the French ship soon told, with Scott and his first lieutenant severely wounded and their masts badly damaged. Unable {{to keep up with the}} French frigate, whose hull was badly holed but whose masts were only lightly damaged, Horatio fell back.|$|E
5|$|At the {{opposite}} end of the camp, three North Vietnamese PT-76 tanks rolled through the barbed-wire barrier in front of Company 102 and 103. From <b>point</b> <b>blank,</b> North Vietnamese tank crews destroyed several bunkers with their guns, forcing the soldiers of Company 102 and 103 to abandon their positions. Those who survived the onslaught either retreated to the reconnaissance positions, or along Highway 9, toward Khe Sanh in the east. About 800 meters to the west, Sergeant First Class Charles W. Lindewald, an adviser to the Mobile Strike Force, also reported back to Willoughby that the early warning outpost was in danger of being overrun. To save it, Lindewald directed artillery strikes on the North Vietnamese troops moving up towards his outpost, but he later died from a gunshot wound to the stomach as the North Vietnamese overran the outpost. At about 01:30, Shungel and his hastily organized tank-killer teams were busy engaging the North Vietnamese tanks that were roaming the Company 104 area; on many occasions the M-72 rockets fired by the Americans either missed completely, jammed, misfired, or simply failed to knock out the enemy tanks. By 02:30, the North Vietnamese had broken through the inner perimeter of the camp, and began harassing the soldiers trapped inside the tactical operations center, which included Willoughby along with seven other Americans, three South Vietnamese special forces, and 26 CIDG soldiers.|$|E
5|$|By day four, 20September, {{the brigade}} still holding {{out at the}} bridge had been split into two groups during the night by the Germans who had managed to {{infiltrate}} close enough to separate them into positions east and west of the bridge road. Any movement was subjected to machine-gun and sniper fire and they were under almost constant mortar and artillery attack. Added to this were probes by tanks and self propelled guns, which approached the defenders' buildings and opened fire at <b>point</b> <b>blank</b> range. The brigade, out of anti-tank ammunition, could do nothing to stop them in the east, but the 6pounders in the west still proved an effective deterrent. During the day, Lieutenant John Grayburn of the 2nd Battalion was killed and later posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross for his bravery during the fighting at the bridge. That morning, communications with 1st Airborne Division were established and Frost, on asking for reinforcements and supplies, was informed that the division was surrounded at Oosterbeek and the brigade was on their own. Frost was later wounded and command of the brigade assumed by Major Frederick Gough of the reconnaissance squadron. By midday the brigade position was untenable and the last defenders were withdrawn into {{what had been the}} Headquarters Company, 2nd Battalion's position. By nightfall they were still holding out, and in the darkness some men tried unsuccessfully to break out. At dawn on day five, {{what was left of the}} brigade was forced to surrender.|$|E

40|$|This article {{explores the}} tension between the ‘political’ and ‘ethical’ {{dimensions}} of contemporary verbatim practice, through an application of Slavoj Žižek’s theory of the universal symptom to two productions – DV 8 ’s To Be Straight With You (2007) and <b>Point</b> <b>Blank’s</b> An Evening with Psychosis (2009). The article looks in particular at the treatment of transcripts from interviewees who offer testimonies in support of the institutional discourses that are the target of each production’s ideological critique. By drawing on Žižek’s understanding of ethical codes that are never ‘universal’, but always constituted in relations of power, the article argues that the satirical and Brechtian treatment of certain verbatim testimonies through their theatrical framing and style of presentation constitutes a justifiable ‘political suspension of the ethical’ in each instance...|$|R
5|$|Lindwall {{returned}} {{to take the}} second new ball and trapped Jack Crapp, who did not offer a shot, for 37 to leave the score at 3/87.

Lindwall later had Edrich gloving a rearing ball to the wicket-keeper to leave England at 5/119. Compton returned upon {{the fall of the}} fifth wicket to revive the innings and Lindwall ended with 4/99 after having Godfrey Evans caught behind from an expansive cut shot. England ended on 363 all out on the second day; Compton made an unbeaten 145.

5|$|The 26th Infantry's initial {{attack on}} 13 October {{provided}} important insight {{on the nature}} of the fighting; American infantry had been ambushed by German defenders using sewers and cellars, forcing the advancing American infantry to clear each opening before continuing down streets, while Sherman tanks found it impossible to maneuver to suppress enemy fire. German civilians were cleared as the 26th Infantry advanced; no Germans were allowed to remain in the Americans' rear. Success in Aachen was measured by the number of houses captured, as the advance proved to be sluggish; in order to cope with the thick walls of the older buildings in the city, the 26th Infantry Regiment used howitzers at <b>point</b> <b>blank</b> range to destroy German fortifications. The howitzer created passageways that allowed infantrymen to advance from building to building without having to enter the city's streets, where they could be pinned down by enemy fire. Sherman tanks were ambushed, as they entered intersections, by concealed German anti-tank guns. Soon thereafter, American tanks and other armored vehicles would advance cautiously, often shooting buildings ahead of the accompanying infantry to clear them of possible defenders. Pinned on the surface by Allied aircraft, German infantrymen would use sewers to deploy behind American formations to attack them from the rear. German resistance was fierce, as they launched small counterattacks and used armor to halt American movements.|$|E
5|$|Finally at 03:30, rocket {{and mortar}} fire began falling on FSB Coral, {{concentrating on the}} 102nd Field Battery and the 1 RAR Mortar Platoon {{positions}} in an intense bombardment lasting five minutes. Following a ten-minute pause a number of flares signalled {{the start of the}} assault. Intending to capture the field guns, two North Vietnamese companies rushed the Australians from the north-east firing their AK-47 assault rifles, with the 1 RAR Mortar Platoon taking the brunt of the initial attack, while the 1 ATF Defence Platoon was also pinned down by heavy machine-gun fire. The New Zealand howitzers and 3 RAR mortars began firing in support, however they failed to halt the North Vietnamese and the initial assault succeeded in over-running the 1 RAR mortars, killing five and wounding eight. The flank of the main assault force then ran through the position at speed before moving on towards the gun position. During their earlier reconnaissance, the North Vietnamese had likely observed the guns to be laid facing east and had probably planned to assault from the north as a result, yet shortly before the main attack the battery had fired a mission to the north and the guns were now directly facing their axis of assault. Moving in long straight lines across a frontage of 150 to 200 men, the main North Vietnamese assault moved against the gun position as the Australian gunners opened fire over open sights with Splintex rounds at <b>point</b> <b>blank</b> range, with thousands of darts ripping through their ranks and breaking up successive waves into small groups. Amid the confusion, follow-up sections hesitated upon reaching the mortar position, while other groups skirmished around the flanks and between the artillery and mortars.|$|E

40|$|A {{method has}} been {{developed}} to analyze the wing/rotor interaction of tilt rotor aircraft in hover. The unsteady, thin-layer compressible Navier-Stokes equations are solved using an implicit, finite difference scheme that employs LU-ADI factorization. The rotor is modeled as an actuator disk which imparts a radial and azimuthal distribution of pressure rise and swirl to the flowfield. The 'chimera' approach of grid <b>point</b> <b>blanking</b> is used to update the rotor boundary conditions. Results are presented for both a rotor alone and for wing/rotor interaction where the thrust coefficient is 0. 0164 and wing flap deflection is 67 degrees. Many of the complex flow features are captured including the fountain effect, leading and trailing edge separation, and the unsteady wake beneath the wing. Wing surface pressures compare fairly well with experimental data although the time-averaged download is about twenty {{percent higher than the}} measured value. This discrepancy is due to a combination of factors that are discussed...|$|R
