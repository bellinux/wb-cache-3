5|$|A {{more recent}} {{development}} is the electric action which uses low voltage DC to control the key and/or stop mechanisms. Electricity may control the action indirectly through air pressure valves (<b>pneumatics),</b> {{in which case the}} action is electro-pneumatic. In such actions, an electromagnet attracts a small pilot valve which lets wind go to a bellows ("pneumatic") which opens the pallet. When electricity operates the action directly without the assistance of <b>pneumatics,</b> it is commonly referred to as direct electric action. In this type, the electromagnet's armature carries a disc pallet.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{purpose of}} the study is to measure the maximum static {{friction}} and dynamic friction in the actuation process of <b>pneumatic</b> cylinder after TiO 2 nanoparticles are added to grease. The study makes an innovative design of a new measuring equipment of friction force, which can measure the friction force between the piston seal in <b>pneumatic</b> cylinder and the cylinder bore. The friction force of <b>pneumatic</b> cylinder bore directly affects the output dynamic property of <b>pneumatic</b> cylinder motion. Friction force measuring system can measure the change of friction force of <b>pneumatic</b> cylinder bore under the condition with different operating speeds, and can analyze the relationship between friction force of <b>pneumatic</b> cylinder and output dynamic property of <b>pneumatic</b> cylinder. Such a friction force measuring equipment takes <b>pneumatic</b> cylinder as an output of motive force to drive the measurement of <b>pneumatic</b> cylinder, and uses load cell and draw-line encoder to measure the friction force of <b>pneumatic</b> cylinder bore and the motion speed. In the experiment, the friction forces of <b>pneumatic</b> cylinder given with oil and without oil are measured respectively, achieving the friction force property of <b>pneumatic</b> cylinder bore when being lubricated by nanogrease added with nanoparticles of different weight percentages (wt. %).

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is simplifying and downsizing of <b>pneumatic</b> system consisting of many <b>pneumatic</b> actuators. For this purpose a new method of multiplex <b>pneumatic</b> transmission for multi-pneumatic servo system is proposed. The <b>pneumatic</b> valve for this system has a simple structure consisting of two vibrators supported by springs. The working principle of the valve is based on vibrator resonance caused by multiplex <b>pneumatic</b> vibration in air supply line and this makes the valve work as an ON/OFF valve without electric wire or independent <b>pneumatic</b> tubes. Valve control needs superimposed only an air supply tube for its independent control, making this <b>pneumatic</b> system suitable for the system having many degrees of freedom. Two prototype valves have been developed to confirm the basic function and adapted to the <b>pneumatic</b> system consisting of two <b>pneumatic</b> cylinders.

25|$|The first Chicken, no. 33, was {{met with}} dissatisfaction by the employees. They were built without air brakes, which meant that the {{conductor}} would have to traverse a full tram to reach the emergency brake should the motorman fall unconscious. The railway authorities sided with the employees, requiring the company to rebuild the unit. A similar concern was raised concerning the trailers. As air brakes are fail safe, the trailers would automatically brake should the trailer become disconnected. With the need for pressurized air system in place, the advantages of pneumatic door were reaped. However, the <b>pneumatics</b> systems largely ate up the costs savings of rebuilding material. Most of the work was carried out at Sagene Depot, and was carried out between mid-1954 to 1958.|$|E
25|$|Frank Horstmann, in Leviathan und die Erpumper. Erinnerungen an Thomas Hobbes in der Luftpumpe, {{has criticized}} Shapin and Schaffer's {{use of the}} {{historical}} evidence.

Before May 1648, for example, Hobbes preferred vacuist interpretations of experimental <b>pneumatics</b> and strictly rejected plenist interpretations as not imaginable; but Shapin and Schaffer turn the vacuist into a plenist by ignoring all the vacuist interpretations and by producing a very faulty translation as a putative proof for a plenist interpretation. Horstmann argues that there are many similar errors and wrong quotations in Leviathan and the Air-Pump and suggests that the chapters dealing with Hobbes are constructed on heavy and sometimes systematic misrepresentations of the historical record.|$|E
40|$|A <b>pneumatic</b> {{actuator}} is {{a device}} {{that is capable of}} converting energy from a pressurized gas into motion. While motion can be created through other means, such as a hydraulic or electric motor, <b>pneumatic</b> actuators are safer, cheaper, and cleaner. Therefore, <b>pneumatic</b> actuators have been used widely in the field of industry automation. However, the compressibility of air and the inherent non-linearity of <b>pneumatic</b> actuators cause challenges in controlling accurately position of <b>pneumatic</b> actuators. This paper presents an accurate non-linear back-box model (NBBM) for identifying the dynamic behavior of <b>pneumatic</b> actuators. Once the optimized NBBM of the <b>pneumatic</b> actuator is obtained, it can give a generation of an effective solution for designing a position controller of that. Here, the NBBM is a multi-player perceptron neural network (MLPNN), whose parameters are optimized by using the Lervenberg-Marquardt Back Propagation (LMBP) algorithm. For the model verification, a <b>pneumatic</b> actuator was set up to investigate the dynamics of it as well as to generate the training data. Next, the advanced NBBM for the <b>pneumatic</b> actuator is performed with suitable inputs to estimate the cylinder piston displacement. Finally, the NBBM ability is evaluated by a comparison of the estimated and real <b>pneumatic</b> actuator performance...|$|R

25|$|Among 787 flight systems, a key {{change from}} {{traditional}} airliners is the electrical architecture. The architecture is bleedless and replaces bleed air and hydraulic power sources with electrically powered compressors and pumps, while completely eliminating <b>pneumatics</b> and hydraulics from some subsystems, e.g., engine starters or brakes.

The total available on-board electrical power is 1.45 megawatts, which is five times the power available on conventional pneumatic airliners; the most notable electrically powered systems include engine start, cabin pressurization, horizontal stabilizer trim, and wheel brakes. Wing ice protection is another new system; it uses electro-thermal heater mats on the wing slats instead of traditional hot bleed air.

25|$|The {{authenticity}} of Philo's {{description of a}} cardan suspension has been doubted by some authors {{on the ground that}} the part of Philo's Pneumatica which describes the use of the gimbal survived only in an Arabic translation of the early 9th century. Thus, the sinologist Joseph Needham suspected Arab interpolation as late as 1965. However, Carra de Vaux, author of the French translation which still provides the basis for modern scholars, regards the <b>Pneumatics</b> as essentially genuine. The historian of technology George Sarton (1959) also asserts that it is safe to assume the Arabic version is a faithful copying of Philo's original, and credits Philon explicitly with the invention. So does his colleague Michael Lewis (2001). In fact, research by the latter scholar (1997) demonstrates that the Arab copy contains sequences of Greek letters which fell out of use after the 1st century, thereby strengthening the case that it is a faithful copy of the Hellenistic original, a view recently also shared by the classicist Andrew Wilson (2002).|$|E

In the study, several S-shape <b>pneumatic</b> micropumps with various layouts were designed and fabricated based on thick-film photoresist lithography and polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) replication processes. To investigate designs with a suitable pumping performance, S-shape <b>pneumatic</b> micropumps with varied lengths (1000, 5000 and 10 000 νm), varied widths (20, 40 and 200 νm) of the <b>pneumatic</b> microchannel bridging two rectangular <b>pneumatic</b> chambers, and different numbers of <b>pneumatic</b> channel bends (two and four U-shape bends) were designed and evaluated experimentally by using high-speed CCD-coupled microscopic observation of the movement of PDMS membrane pulsation and pumping rate measurements.
