The department manages 16 colleges and the region of Normandy manages 9 schools.

A boarding school of excellence, the Claude Bernard college, opened in 2011. The first college in Le Havre dates to the 16th century, the high school François I was founded during the Second Empire and is the oldest in Le Havre. The philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre (1905-1980) and Raymond Aron (1905-1983) taught there. The writer Armand Salacrou (1899-1989) studied in this institution.|$|E
40|$|Research {{rationale}} To {{understand the}} teaching and learning phenomena, it is interesting to examine what happens in schools located in sensitive urban areas. In fact, these phenomena are easier to observe in a <b>Priority</b> <b>education</b> <b>zone,</b> as opposed to an ordinary school, because all that occurs is amplified, as through a magnifying glass (Rochex, 1997). In these kinds of schools, the teachers have to deal with a paradox between a learning logic and the logic of engagement in learning. The latter is favored by an immediate achievement in the set tasks. This occurs more easily when the tasks are simple and closed, but they do not lead to real disciplinary learning. However, some teachers desire to really teach in these schools; indeed, they intend to foster student’s engagement without sacrificing real disciplinary learning. It is interesting to observe how they carry it out in practice. Theoretical frame For this, we can use the theory of didactic action (Sensevy and al., 2005, Sensevy, 2007) which models what happens in a didactic system, the irreducible three-way relationship linking teacher...|$|E
40|$|URL] audienceAbstract This paper {{concerns}} {{conditions for}} fostering productive disciplinary engagement. They {{have been established}} during a regular physics lesson with a half class group in a secondary school (grade 7), located in a <b>Priority</b> <b>education</b> <b>zone</b> in a sensitive urban area. This case study has been realized using the video of the lesson and teacher and student interviews. The theory of didactic action (Sensevy and al., 2005) {{has been used to}} analyze the development of the lesson. We have examined the actors' participation in the progress of knowledge in the class and the building of the “didactic milieu” in which it takes place (like Brousseau, 1997, we consider that the milieu is “all that the students relate to at the learning moment”). This part of the investigation has been carried out using interviews. The disciplinary engagement has been evaluated using the criteria proposed by Engle and Conant (2002) (e. g. number of students in the group making significant contributions to the topic under discussion, nature of contributions - collaborative or independent -, number of students involved in “off-task” activities, relations between student's discourse and what is usually scholarly discussed in physics, progress of the students' knowledge, emergence of new questions). We observed in this lesson that productive disciplinary engagement was favored by a significant problematization of subject matter, combined with a particular management of the didactic interactions: the teacher chose a maieutical process (related to the Socratic method of eliciting knowledge by a series of questions and answers) based on collective exchanges, she prioritized dialogical communication, she facilitated the students' reasoning, clearly identifying the knowledge at stake in each step, delimitating the elements submitted to discussion, highlighting the relevant features of the studied situations, frequently institutionalizing knowledge as it progressed, and concluding exchanges herself when they became fruitless and demotivating. Under these conditions, the students collaborated in the teacher's action, allowing the progress of knowledge in the class thanks to their joint action, and at the same time, the disappearance of the discipline problems often linked to these kinds of schools...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{highlights}} {{the challenges of}} the heads of schools {{in the context of the}} underachieving primary schools which are termed as Zones d’Education Prioritaires- ZEP schools (<b>Priority</b> <b>Education</b> <b>Zones</b> as its English translation would mean). These schools are found in the deprived regions of the Republic of Mauritius and have been given specific considerations by the government. This significance of this paper lies in its attempt to explore those planning processes from a perspective of implementing a total quality management approach while delivering on the set objectives with the right leadership style. The arguments presented can provide some answers to questions asked about the failing schools. The discussions are framed around developing a standard management protocol and therefore evolving a School Improvement Framework (SIF) to improve performance of ZEP schools in the country. The above considerations are important as they are part of the educational reform agenda of the Ministry of Education as it meets the internationally agreed goals...|$|R

25|$|Pursuant to its {{campaign}} pledges, the Mauroy Government established 14,760 new permanent teaching posts {{at the elementary}} and secondary levels in June 1981, and provided for 16,800 more in the 1982 budget and an additional 8,370 in the 1983 budget. A major increase in the modest salaries of elementary school teachers was announced. Technical education at the secondary level was declared to be a priority area, with special attention in the form of more scholarship money, additional teaching positions, and the commitment of 430million francs per year for three years for the introduction of new technologies into the school programme. However, these actions (particularly the creation of only 400 new technical teachers’ positions in 1981, when enrolment went up by 11,000) were seen as inadequate by the National Union of Technical Education-Autonomous Apprenticeship. In December 1981, a general science programme in the eleventh grade (premier) was created to replace the mathematics programme (the Bac C) which, after the fall from favour of Latin and Greek, had {{come to be known as}} a “royal road into élitist schools and careers.” The Premier S programme was an attempt to postpone definitive scholastic and social segregation, and also to reduce the importance of mathematical aptitude as the primary criterion for selection into élite schools. Greater funds were allocated to education, with the education budget was increased by 17.3% in 1982 and by 15% in 1983. In 1981–82, as a means of tackling cases of education failure, the Ministry of Education subsidized projects designed to help weaker students in 4,500 of the country’s 7,300 secondary schools. Although these subsidies were only of 30million francs, the programme encouraged secondary schools to pay attention to the problem.

The authors reach this conclusion by examining four European programs of <b>priority</b> <b>education</b> (PPE). Two basic tendencies are identified. On the one hand, recent deployment of the English and French initiatives seems to be altering the formulation of problems they are designed to address by enhancing in practice a decontextualized notion of individual educational need in which it is considered legitimate to intervene. On the other hand, the Catalan and Dutch programs, which theoretically address both territorial and nonformal educational inequalities, in fact apply prioritization schemes and interventions mainly based on school-based social measures...|$|R

Secondly, the main current governmental initiative in the field, <b>Priority</b> Intervention <b>Education</b> Territories (TEIP 2), is analyzed. It aims to reduce school failure and school dropout in deprived areas and attempts to fulfill the goals set for Europe in terms of education and training. We analyze TEIP 2 program’s impact on students’ school achievement, dropout and on the possibilities of innovating pedagogical practices. We argue that significant changes have occurred in the conceptions and goals of <b>priority</b> <b>education</b> in Portugal, especially in what concerns the need for schools to acknowledge the sociological and cultural diversity of their students and families. However, it cannot be neglected that current policies show an important vulnerability in what concerns their ambitious goals, as they simultaneously try to achieve system modernization, social cohesion and reduction of social inequalities. In our opinion, the question of knowing if these principles and logics of action are compatible or can coexist is remaining, especially {{in the context of a}} deep economic and financial crisis that is nowadays prevailing in Portugal...|$|R
