40|$|This paper {{examines}} the Weak-Form Efficient Market Hypothesis across {{time for the}} Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) by hypothesizing Normal Distribution and Random walk in <b>periodic</b> <b>return</b> series. Monthly all share indices of the NSE are examined for three periods including January 1985 to December 1992, January 1993 to December 1999, and January 2000 to December 2007. Our Normality tests are conducted using Skewness, Kurtosis, Kolmogorov-Smirnov, and Q-Q Normal Chart; whereas Random walk is tested using the non-parametric Runs test. Results of the Normality tests show that returns from NSE do not follow normal distribution in all the periods. Runs test results reject the randomness of the return series of the NSE in the periods studied. Overall results from the tests suggest that the NSE is not Weak-Form efficient across the time periods of this study. The results however, show that improvements in NSE trading system have positive effect on efficiency. Relaxing institutional restrictions on trading securities {{in the market and}} strengthening the regulatory capacities of NSE and Nigerian Securities and Exchange Commission (NSEC) to enforce market discipline were recommended. ...|$|E
40|$|Background. For {{most stroke}} survivors, {{rehabilitation}} therapy {{is the only}} treatment option available. The beneficial effects of early reha-bilitation on neuroplasticity and functional recovery have been modeled in experimental stroke {{using a combination of}} enriched environ-ment and rehabilitation. However, the impact of a secondary intervention, such as a <b>periodic</b> <b>return</b> to therapy, remains unclear. Objective. This study examines whether a return to enriched rehabilitation (ie, “tune-up”) can further promote functional recovery or produce ben-eficial changes in brain plasticity in the chronic phase of stroke recovery. Methods. Rats were exposed to focal ischemia (endothelin- 1 applied to forelimb sensorimotor cortex and dorsolateral striatum) and allowed to recover either in standard housing or in a combination of enriched environment and rehabilitative reaching for 9 weeks. Animals were then exposed to rotating periods of standard housing (5 weeks) and intensive “tune-up ” therapy consisting of various sensorimotor/cognitive activities (2 weeks). Functional recovery was assessed using the Montoya staircase, beam-traversing, and cylinder tests, and Golgi–Cox analysis was used to examine dendritic com-plexity in the contralesional forelimb motor cortex. Results. Although early enriched rehabilitation significantly improved sensorimotor function in both the beam and staircase tests, “tune-up ” therapy had no effect on recovery. Golgi–Cox analysis revealed no effect of treatment on dendritic complexity. Conclusions. This study reaffirms the benefits of early rehabilitation for functional recovery after stroke. However, “tune-up ” therapy provided no benefit in ischemic animals regardless of earlier rehabilitation experience. It is possible that alternative approaches in the chronic phase may prove more effective...|$|E
40|$|Most {{lakes and}} closed basins in Tibet are {{surrounded}} by abandoned shorelines attesting for high-water levels in the past. Two such lakes, Longmu Co and Sumxi Co (Western Tibet), were the focus of detailed palaeoclimatic work during the 1989 Sino-French expedition based {{on the study of}} lake sediments and analysis of a piston core. Here it is shown that additional information may be deduced from the abandoned shorelines around Longmu Co. A 1800 m long topographic profile was levelled from 75 m up to 230 m above the present lake elevation (5008 m), on which the shorelines form a flight of horizontal terraces separated by more or less degraded scarps. The elevations of the terraces were spaced regularly about 1. 35 m, except for 3 – 5 m high lacunae reccurring every 15 – 16 m. The potential annual evapo-transpiration was computed based on meteorological data collected at Tien Shui Hai from 13 / 08 / 89 to 11 / 09 / 90. Using a modified Penman formula a value of 1. 60 ± 0. 3 m/yr was obtained under close system conditions (no outlet) and a synthetic curve of lake regression was derived which appears to be consistent with the measured shoreline heights. It is concluded that the 1. 35 m terraces represent annual regression of the lake level. By contrast, the 3 – 5 m high lacunae might reflect the <b>periodic</b> <b>return,</b> about every 9 – 12 yr, of particular climatic conditions responsible for a perturbation of the annual process of shoreline formation. All the shorelines of this profile have formed probably within one century, during a continuous and abrupt regression of the lake. Such evolution has also been identified in the sediments of a piston core collected at Sumxi Co, and dated at about 6 - 5. 5 kyr B. P. The lake level must have been at its highest stand, shortly before that major regression. The mechanism responsible for this middle Holocene high stand and for the major sudden drop of the lake level remains uncertain...|$|E

40|$|The article {{expresses the}} view that the current Internal Revenue Code has evolved into a hybrid income tax and {{consumption}} tax. It begins by explaining the difference between an income tax and a consumption tax and provides the backgrounds of the alternative forms of consumption tax: (1) consumed income, (2) yield exemption, and (3) point-of-sale taxation. Under the consumed income tax model of consumption tax, the individual taxpayer includes all items of income, both from labor and from capital, in its tax base, and then subtracts or deducts the portion of that income that he saves or invests. The resulting amount represents the portion of his income that he has not saved, (i. e., that he has consumed), and is the amount that is subject to tax. In that manner, the consumed income tax would levy the tax directly on consumption, and would be computed and collected at the individual level. A similar end result - taxing consumption, but not savings - can be achieved without allowing a deduction for new saving or investment but rather by permitting the returns from the investment to be exempt from tax instead, regardless of whether they are consumed or saved. Under certain assumptions this yield exemption variation will have the equivalent effect of the consumed income model, which taxes the proceeds from the investment. The article identifies the most important consumption tax provisions of the current Internal Revenue Code, which include the following: (1) the realization requirement, capital gains, dividends, and stepped-up basis at death under section 1014, all constituting either complete or partial yield exemption provisions; (2) retirement plans, which involve consumed income tax provisions because they allow a deduction upon contribution, {{with the exception of the}} Roth IRA, which is a yield exemption provision; (3) section 529 education plans, which provide yield exemption for restricted savings dedicated to paying qualified education expenses; (4) homeownership, which entails the yield exemption benefits of non-taxability of imputed income from the use of the home - a benefit similar to the <b>periodic</b> <b>return</b> on the investment in the home - and excludability from income of all or most of the gain on the sale of the home (for most taxpayers), and also involves as a bonus the deductibility of the home mortgage interest, subject to statutory limits, and real property taxes; (5) business tax incentives, allowing a full or partial deduction for expenditures that under income tax principles would otherwise have to be capitalized and depreciated over their useful life. The article reflects on the implications of this evolution in the tax law, including that it may no longer be appropriate to analyze tax provisions under traditional tax expenditure analysis, and concludes that the United States tax system would best be described as an income tax/consumption tax hybrid, with noticeable movement with each set of income tax code amendments to a consumption tax...|$|E
