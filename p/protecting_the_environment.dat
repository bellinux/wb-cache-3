5|$|Spent {{nuclear fuel}} is the {{radioactive}} by-product of electricity generation at commercial nuclear power plants, and {{high-level radioactive waste}} is the by-product from reprocessing spent fuel to produce fissile material for nuclear weapons. In 1982, the United States Congress established a national policy {{to solve the problem}} of nuclear waste disposal. This policy is a federal law called the Nuclear Waste Policy Act, which made the DOE responsible for finding a site, building, and operating an underground disposal facility called a geologic repository. The recommendation to use a geologic repository dates back to 1957 when the National Academy of Sciences recommended that the best means of <b>protecting</b> <b>the</b> <b>environment</b> and public health and safety would be to dispose of the waste in rock deep underground.|$|E

25|$|Organic Farming was {{introduced}} in 1988.

Accredited farms strictly monitor and supervise the uses of pesticides, and produce are further analysed for chemical remnants before they are sold at accredited retail outlets.

40|$|It is {{believed}} that the construction activities cause adverse impacts to <b>the</b> <b>environment.</b> In order to <b>protect</b> <b>the</b> <b>environment</b> from these impacts, {{it has been suggested}} that <b>the</b> <b>environment</b> should be considered as the fourth construction objective of the project. This study tests the hypothesis "Environment is the fourth construction objective" through a statistical analysis. To test this hypothesis seven sub hypotheses are developed based on the systems suggested in the literature review: to reduce generic resources in a construction project, in order to <b>protect</b> <b>the</b> <b>environment.</b> To obtain <b>the</b> field data, a questionnaire is prepared based on the systems suggested in the literature review in order to <b>protect</b> <b>the</b> <b>environment.</b> And also views are obtained through this questionnaire on how to implement <b>the</b> actions to <b>protect</b> <b>the</b> <b>environment</b> during project cycle. The owners and specialists of the construction industry in Sri-Lanka are targeted as respondents to the questionnaire. Results shows that <b>the</b> hypothesis" <b>Environment</b> is <b>the</b> fourth construction objective" is not rejected and that owners and specialists in the construction industry are wiling to implement new construction practices to minimize the impacts to <b>the</b> <b>environment.</b> Respondents are in favour of having legislations in order to implement <b>the</b> measures to <b>protect</b> <b>the</b> <b>environment</b> due to construction projects...|$|R

25|$|Ehrlich {{has argued}} that {{humanity}} has simply deferred the disaster {{by the use of}} more intensive agricultural techniques, such as those introduced during the so-called Green Revolution. Ehrlich claims that increasing populations and affluence are increasingly stressing the global environment, due to such factors as loss of biodiversity, overfishing, global warming, urbanization, chemical pollution and competition for raw materials. He maintains that due to growing global incomes, reducing consumption and human population is critical to <b>protecting</b> <b>the</b> <b>environment</b> and maintaining living standards, and that current rates of growth are still too great for a sustainable future.|$|E
25|$|Markham {{offers a}} mix of {{activities}} for its residents to promote its idea of being a place for all. It does this through cultural, entertainment and institutional activities in hopes that its residents will find {{one or more of}} these events attractive. Activities are also free to take place on streets and squares where people live, work, shop and play to make events more accessible for its residents. Its buildings and public transportation are designed with an attractive and inviting attitude in mind to create a more comfortable space. The City also values the importance of a “walkable” downtown as it allows its residents to enjoy buildings and services being in walking distance of each other. This space is pedestrian friendly, creating an accessible space for all. Overall, Markham aims to put its residents and their families first, bringing jobs closer into its boundaries and <b>protecting</b> <b>the</b> <b>environment.</b>|$|E

25|$|Many of Donald Trump's {{nominees for}} {{positions}} within his cabinet dispute proven facts about climate change. They include Scott Pruitt {{for the head}} of the EPA who as an Oklahoma attorney general repeatedly sued the EPA over its rules. Since becoming {{the head of the}} EPA, Pruitt has been running on an agenda solely concerned to bring jobs to the coal mining industry despite many of these mines having violated legislation <b>protecting</b> <b>the</b> <b>environment</b> (e.g. the Clean Water Act). Following the United Nations Climate Treaty, signed by 200 nations in 2015, Trump's actions are a distinct step backwards from phasing out fossil fuels. Most notably, on March 28, 2017, Trump signed the Energy Independence Executive Order designed {{to get rid of the}} Clean Power Plan initiated by President Obama. As a result, any previous action and steps taken to stop climate change will not be sustained. Trump has also promised to bring back the coal industry despite most greenhouse gases coming from coal-based power plants.|$|E

500|$|The United Nations (UN) is an {{intergovernmental}} organization tasked to promote international co-operation {{and to create}} and maintain international order. A replacement for the ineffective League of Nations, the organization was [...] established on 24 October 1945 after World War II {{in order to prevent}} another such conflict. At its founding, the UN had 51 member states; there are now 193. The headquarters of the UN is in Manhattan, New York City, and is subject to extraterritoriality. Further main offices are situated in Geneva, Nairobi, and Vienna. The organization is financed by assessed and voluntary contributions from its member states. Its objectives include maintaining international peace and security, promoting human rights, fostering social and economic development, <b>protecting</b> <b>the</b> <b>environment,</b> and providing humanitarian aid in cases of famine, natural disaster, and armed conflict.

500|$|Bulgaria {{adopted the}} Kyoto Protocol and {{achieved}} the protocol's objectives by reducing {{carbon dioxide emissions}} from 1990 to 2009 by 30 percent. However, pollution from factories and metallurgy works and severe deforestation continue to cause major problems {{to the health and}} welfare of the population. In 2013, air pollution in Bulgaria was more severe than any other European country. Urban areas are particularly affected by energy production from coal-based powerplants and automobile traffic, while pesticide usage in the agriculture and antiquated industrial sewage systems produce extensive soil and water pollution with chemicals and detergents. Bulgaria is home to Maritsa Iztok-2, a lignite-fired power station causing the highest damage costs to health and the environment in the entire European Union according to the European Environment Agency. It is the only EU member which does not recycle municipal waste, although an electronic waste recycling plant opened in June 2010. The situation has improved in recent years, and several government-funded programs have been put into place in an attempt to reduce pollution levels. According to Yale University's 2012 Environmental Performance Index, Bulgaria is a [...] "modest performer" [...] in <b>protecting</b> <b>the</b> <b>environment.</b> Over 75% of surface rivers meet the standards for good quality. An improvement of water quality began in 1998 and has maintained a sustainable trend of moderate improvement.|$|E
