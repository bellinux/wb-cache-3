5000|$|There {{are various}} compromises between the {{development}} speed when using an interpreter and the execution speed when using a compiler. Some systems (such as some Lisps) allow interpreted and compiled code to {{call each other}} and to share variables. This means that once a routine has been tested and debugged under the interpreter it can be compiled and thus benefit from faster execution while other routines are being developed. Many interpreters do not execute the source code as it stands but convert it into some more compact internal form. Many BASIC interpreters replace keywords with single byte tokens which can be used to find the instruction in a jump table. A few interpreters, such as the PBASIC interpreter, achieve even higher levels of <b>program</b> <b>compaction</b> by using a bit-oriented rather than a byte-oriented program memory structure, where commands tokens occupy perhaps 5 bits, nominally [...] "16-bit" [...] constants are stored in a variable-length code requiring 3, 6, 10, or 18 bits, and address operands include a [...] "bit offset". Many BASIC interpreters can store and read back their own tokenized internal representation.|$|E

40|$|Introduction On most {{embedded}} systems, memory {{space and}} power resources are limited.

Compilers for embedded systems usually try to generate the most compact code possible, and libraries for embedded systems are usually quite a lot smaller than those for general purpose computer systems. One area of improvement that has in general been overlooked, is the linking process. Recent research [2] has shown {{that it is possible}} to achieve considerable <b>program</b> <b>compaction</b> at link time, as the linker has a view of the complete program, including libraries, and therefore it is not bound to a number of the conservative assumptions a compiler has to make.

Only a limited spectrum of waste is amenable to incineration due to various limitations. In comparison, compaction gives a moderate volume reduction of around 5. However these systems are simple, economical, operating at ambient temperatures and consuming nominal man-Rem expenditure.

40|$|Issue: Some {{curbside}} recycling collection <b>programs</b> use <b>compaction</b> {{vehicles to}} collect designated recyclables. While this will yield greater amounts of material on a collection route than collecting materials loose and {{placing them in}} non-compaction vehicles, {{there is a greater}} possibility of introducing contaminants to the PET recycling process. Best Practice: Collecting recyclables in compaction vehicles [...] like the trucks used to collect household trash [...] is {{the most efficient way to}} collect and transport recyclables. However, many curbside collection programs request their residents to commingle recyclable glass, metal and plastic containers together. When commingled containers are compacted, there is a greater tendency for glass breakage. When this happens, small pieces of glass can get trapped inside PET bottles and containers. This trapped glass can cause serious damage to processing equipment throughout the PET recycling process. Therefore, the best practice for curbside collection of PET plastics is to collect PET plastic containers commingled with other recyclable containers except glass in compaction vehicles.

The {{compaction}} {{of agricultural}} soils {{is a serious}} problem in the agricultural community due to it’s proven negative effects that {{can be seen as a}} form of land degradation. Due to agricultural traffic, applied stresses are transmitted to deeper depths and may alter physical, chemical and biological properties of soils. This paper outlines the structure of a computer application for the assessment of in field agricultural traffic, which is developed as a module within a <b>program</b> for soil <b>compaction</b> control that can be also used as a standalone application that can be installed on any PC or mobile device. The proposed computer application is designed to be used not only as a standalone application but also build in an application for soil compaction assessment. The application is a result of extensive literature and experimental research activities, so it uses proper input parameters data available literature and personal research data gathered by authors of this paper. Following the available studies are defined the input parameters, the general layout of the software application is showed and described, the general structure is analysed and the output data is mentioned. In this paper we designed a software application for agricultural traffic assessment, developed to be as a useful tool not only for in field traffic management but also for soil compaction management on long term, that can be used on small or large farms so the user will have a clear status of the traffic on the field...|$|R
40|$|Sulfate-induced heave, {{resulting}} from the chemical treatment of sulfate rich soils, {{has been known to}} cause significant damage to pavements and other structures particularly in the south-western United States. This research addressed the problem of sulfate-induced heave in coal mine spoils, formed as a result of shallow strip coal mining, after treatment with calcium-based stabilizers. These spoils occur in areas of Indiana in which substantial infrastructure development is taking place and will continue to occur in the next 10 - 15 years. Samples of coal mine spoils were obtained from different sites in Indiana. While the majority of the samples exhibited sulfate contents below values generally considered to be a concern, selected samples exhibited elevated sulfate contents, in the thousands of ppm. One of these samples, from the Hawthorn coal mine area in Sullivan County, Indiana, with sulfate content exceed 10, 000 ppm, the critical threshold value above which, according to the literature, significant heave may be expected, was selected for extensive testing. The sample, extremely heterogeneous in nature, was crushed and screened to eliminate the coarser aggregates. The study investigated the swelling behavior of this material treated with the following calcium-based stabilizers: hydrated lime, quick lime and Portland cement, at dosages ranging from 1. 5 % to 9 % by dry mass of the soil. The experimental <b>program</b> involved <b>compaction</b> tests performed using the Harvard miniature apparatus, and subsequent swelling tests on specimens compacted at optimum water content. The swelling tests, conducted over a period of one month were performed using the sand bath method in a custom setup housed in an environmental chamber. All specimens of the spoils treated with the stabilizers were found to exhibit swelling greater than that measured on the untreated spoil. Swelling of the treated spoil, was initially delayed and approached a constant value after approximately one month. The highest swelling strain (in excess of 10 %) was measured on the specimens treated with 3 % hydrated lime. Also for the other stabilizers, a lower dosage typically resulted in higher final swelling strains. Tests were also conducted to examine the effect of the surcharge stress on the swelling behavior and explore the effectiveness of the following two mitigation techniques: pre-compaction mellowing and double lime treatment. A pre-compaction mellowing period of 2 - 3 days was observed to lead to swelling strains comparable to those of the untreated soil. No advantages could be identified in using double lime treatment. The experimental program also included tests for the chemical and mineralogical characterization of the spoil-stabilizer mixtures and the specimen pore fluid {{at the end of the}} swelling stage. In particular, X-ray diffraction and thermo-gravimetric analyses provided evidence of the presence of ettringite in all soil-stabilizer specimens. The crystallization pressure exerted from inside the soil because of the formation of this new phase can be considered responsible for the observed swelling. In a few cases, including that corresponding to the highest swelling strain, the detection of ettringite was problematic. This seems to result from the formation, with low additions of calcium, of a poorly-crystallized ettringite. Several mitigation strategies were investigated: double lime treatment, pre-compaction mellowin...|$|R
40|$|This thesis aims to {{elucidate}} {{the effects of}} pressure solution and phyllosilicates on the compaction and shear behaviour of granular materials chosen to simulate fault gouge deforming under hydrothermal conditions. I implemented three different experimental programs. The first <b>program</b> consists of <b>compaction</b> experiments on quartz sand and phyllosilicate-bearing quartz sand. Clear evidence was found for compaction by IPS. The main conclusion is that IPS compaction under the conditions studied, {{is controlled by the}} rate of dissolution of quartz within the grain contacts. The presence of muscovite hinders compaction, through a chemical retardation effect, on the dissolution rate, of aluminium ions dissolved in the fluid from the muscovite. The second program consists of high strain rotary shear experiments performed on simulated fault gouges consisting of halite-muscovite mixtures. I observed velocity-strengthening behaviour up to a sliding velocity of 0. 3 - 1 μm/s, along with the development of a mylonitic microstructure consisting of an anastomosing foliation enveloping elongate halite clasts. The deformation mechanism was slip on the phyllosilicate foliation with accommodation by pressure solution of the intervening halite. At higher velocities, I observed a velocity weakening effect in the mixtures of halite and muscovite. This was accompanied by a cataclastic microstructure with no foliation but with significant porosity development. I explain this behaviour in terms of a granular flow mechanism involving competition between dilatation and pressure solution controlled compaction. The time-dependence of compaction leads to higher porosities at higher sliding velocities. Higher porosity implies a lower dilatancy angle for granular flow and thus faster shear produces a lower macroscopic shear strength. Slide-hold-slide experiments show that samples deformed in the low-velocity regime do not restrengthen on re-shear, while those deformed in the high velocity regime regain high strength. Healing rates, recorded for the latter samples, increase with sliding velocity. This is explained by a higher steady state porosity being maintained during steady state sliding, so that compaction is increased during hold periods. The increased compaction leads to an increased granular dilatancy angle, hence higher healing rates following rapid slip. The third program consists of rotary shear experiments on simulated quartz gouges under hydrothermal conditions. They show strain hardening up to a shear strain γ of 0. 6 - 1. 8, followed by weakening of up to 30...|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} of the variability of engineering properties of municipal solid waste {{as a function of}} placement conditions was conducted. Limited data have been reported for the engineering properties of municipal solid waste (MSW) as a function of placement conditions. Wastes have high variability of engineering properties due to heterogeneity in composition and component size; influence from time based effects; and presence of compressible solids. Control of moisture content of MSW at the time of waste placement provides opportunity for increased capacity at a given landfill site due to higher compacted unit weight as well as for control of other geotechnical properties. A laboratory experimental test program was conducted on manufactured municipal solid waste (MMSW) that was representative of waste stream in the United States. Large scale test equipment was used to minimize the effects of scaling on results. The experimental <b>program</b> included <b>compaction,</b> compressibility, hydraulic conductivity, and shear strength testing over moisture contents ranging from 11 % to 110 %. Baseline compaction curves were developed for different compactive efforts. Similar to soils, the MMSW had bell shaped compaction curves that peaked at a maximum dry unit weight and associated optimum moisture content. The compaction curve generated at modified compactive effort had a maximum dry unit weight of 5. 1 kN/m 3 and optimum moisture content of 66 %. Four times modified compactive effort testing resulted in a maximum dry unit weight of 5. 9 kN/m 3 and corresponding optimum moisture content of 56 %. The compaction curve generated for four times modified compactive effort was used as a baseline for subsequent testing. Compression index was calculated from the strain-log stress curves for total stress conditions and is referred to as apparent compression index. Apparent compression index decreased from 1. 1 to 0. 34 with increasing moisture content. Secant modulus of elasticity was calculated between 1 % and 25 % strain and ranged from approximately 200 kPa to 4, 800 kPa over the range of tested moisture contents. Tangent modulus ranged from 400 kPa to 6, 200 kPa between 1 % and 25 % strain. Both the secant and tangent modulus peaked between 30 % and 56 % moisture content. Wet of optimum, the moduli of elasticity decreased with increasing moisture content. The hydraulic conductivity was measured under constant head at a hydraulic gradient of 1 and decreased asymptotically from approximately 1. 3 x 10 - 2 cm/s to 8 x 10 - 5 cm/s as the moisture content was increased to optimum. The hydraulic conductivity of the MMSW increased slightly wet of optimum. The internal angle of friction of the MMSW was measured at 15 % shear strain and decreased from approximately 40 ° to 30 ° with increasing moisture content. Test results demonstrated that both the molding moisture content and dry unit weight have significant impact on the MMSW geotechnical properties, although it appears that molding moisture content ultimately controls the behavior. Based on the results of the tests it was speculated that, similar to clay soils, increases in moisture content allowed for breakdown of the fabric and physical rearrangement of waste components which in turn controlled geotechnical behavior. Overall trends were comparable for MMSW and soil and included: increased dry density and increased stiffness to optimum moisture content; decreased hydraulic conductivity with increased compaction moisture content; and decreased shear strength with increased compaction moisture content. The results of the test program have environmental and economic implications for design and operation of landfills as well as post closure use...|$|R
40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Civil EngineeringDunja PericThe {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to investigate the effects of drying on the strength gain of masonry sand stabilized with a co-product from wood pulping called calcium lignosulfonate. Lignin is an amorphous polymer found in plant cell walls. It provides protection against disease and allows the transport of water and nutrients. Adhesive properties of lignin generated interest in adding its modifications to soils as means to prevent erosion from wind and vehicle traffic on unpaved roads. Lignin has the potential to become a more sustainable alternative to traditional stabilizers because its source is renewable and abundant, and its toxicity is negligible. Extensive testing has recently been completed to quantify the stress-strain relationships and Mohr-Coulomb strength parameters of sand- calcium lignosulfonate-water (S-CaL-W) mixes at early age (Bartley, 2011). The experimental program consisted of performing Standard Proctor Tests to determine maximum densities and optimum moisture contents for mixes having different gravimetric lignin contents and direct shear tests on selected sample configurations. Based on these results, it was decided to conduct shear strength testing of the samples containing 4 %, 6 % and 9 % of calcium lignosulfonate after they had been exposed to air drying. To this end, responses of the selected sample configurations to drying at 71 ° F and 27 % relative humidity were measured to determine the target water contents for shear strength testing. Drying curves were obtained by plotting the measured water content or water to CaL ratio versus the elapsed time. Drying times for shear strength were chosen based on how long it took the moisture contents to decrease by specified levels. The available results of direct shear tests show that drying significantly increases both the cohesion and the friction angle of the S-CaL-W mixes with respect to the early age cohesion and friction angle. In addition to the direct shear test <b>program</b> a laboratory <b>compaction</b> test was conducted on CaL and water only, thus providing the maximum dry density of CaL and the corresponding optimum water to CaL ratio. It is also noted that relative humidity was discovered to be the limiting factor in the strength gain of S-CaL-W mixes. The reasons behind its sensitivity to water are due to the presence of HPLC sugars within the calcium lignosulfonate structure. These sugars hold the water through the chemical interaction of the sugars with hydrogen ions and water molecules...|$|R
