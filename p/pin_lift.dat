50|$|The Tonophone, {{played by}} a pinned {{cylinder}} instead of being operated by direct mechanical linkages, was pneumatically operated. The cylinder <b>pins</b> <b>lifted</b> levers which opened valves to a pneumatic mechanism which operated the piano. First shown at the 1901 Pan-American Exposition, the Tonophone {{won a gold medal}} at the exhibition, and went on to be a commercial success. Today, there are thought to be fewer than four complete and working Tonophones left in the world.|$|R

25|$|In {{the lock}} back, {{as in many}} folding knives, a stop pin acting on the top (or behind) the blade {{prevents}} it from rotating clockwise. A hook on the tang of the blade engages with a hook on the rocker bar which prevents the blade rotating counter-clockwise. The rocker bar is held in position by a torsion bar. To release the knife the rocker bar is pushed downwards as indicated and pivots around the rocker <b>pin,</b> <b>lifting</b> the hook and freeing the blade.|$|R
50|$|Hammer and gong - The {{hammer lever}} (F) is {{actuated}} by pins or teeth (G) {{on one of}} the striking train wheels. As the wheel turns the <b>pin</b> <b>lifts</b> the hammer lever, until the lever slips off the pin, allowing the hammer to drop, hitting the gong (E). Early house clocks used traditional hemispherical shaped bells. Later house clocks used gongs made of long steel tubes or bars, which have a sound more like large church bells. Mantel and other small clocks use thick hardened steel wires, which are coiled into a spiral to save space.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this report is to {{document}} {{the results of the}} 150 % rated capacity load test performed by DynCorp Hoisting and Rigging on the CASTOR GSF special cask lifting beams. The two lifting beams were originally rated and tested at 20, 000 kg (44, 000 lb) by the cask manufacturer in Germany. The testing performed by DynCorp rated and tested the lifting beams to 30, 000 kg (66, 000 lb) + 0 %, - 5 %, for Hanford Site use. The CASTOR GSF cask, used to transport isotopic Heat Sources (canisters), must be lifted with its own designed lifting beam system (Figures 1, 2, and 3). As designed, the beam material is RSt 37 - 2 (equivalent to American Society for Testing and Materials [ASTM] A- 570), the eye plate is St 52 - 2 (equivalent to ASTM A- 516), and the <b>lifting</b> <b>pin</b> is St 50 (equivalent to ASTM A- 515). The beam has two opposing 58 mm (2. 3 in.) diameter by 120 mm(4. 7 in.) length, high grade steel pins that engage the cask for <b>lifting.</b> The <b>pins</b> have a manual locking mechanism to prevent disengagement from the casks. The static, gross weight (loaded) of the cask 18, 640 kg (41, 000 lb) on the pins prevents movement of the <b>pins</b> during <b>lifting.</b> This is due to the frictional force of the cask on the <b>pins</b> when <b>lifting</b> begins...|$|R
5000|$|The {{action of}} these small {{instruments}} {{is known as the}} [...] "English single" [...] and is unusually simple (for instance, it is far simpler than the original piano action as invented by Bartolomeo Cristofori.) It consists of a small [...] "sticker" [...] simply pushing up on a hammer, while a rod passing through the hitch <b>pin</b> plank <b>lifted</b> up a damper lever hinged from a rail attached to the spine. The action is illustrated below.|$|R
40|$|From the Proceedings of the 1978 Meetings of the Arizona Section - American Water Resources Assn. and the Hydrology Section - Arizona Academy of Science - April 14 - 15, 1978, Flagstaff, ArizonaDescribed is a {{microroughness}} meter {{developed to}} obtain numerous and accurate measurements of rangeland surface microroughness and characteristics. The meter, {{which consists of}} four basic parts: (1) meter base and pin guide, (2) <b>pin</b> <b>lifting</b> support bar and lifting mechanism, (3) 100 vertically moving pins, and (4) stripchart support guide and winding mechanism, was designed to measure soil surface evaluations and characteristics of a 1 m 2 plot. Performance tests on multi-plot sprinkler infiltrometer studies conducted on the Santa Rita Experimental Range in southeastern Arizona indicated that the meter was accurate and relatively precise in repeating soil surface roughness measurements but was not precise in defining the theoretical characteristics of constructed surfaces. It was concluded, however, that these errors in precision were insignificant and due partly to surface geometry construction errors and that the meter is a convenient, quick, simple and accurate means of measuring surface roughness in studies requiring many plots and data points...|$|R
50|$|Diesel's {{original}} engine injected fuel {{with the}} assistance of compressed air, which atomized the fuel and forced it into the engine through a nozzle (a similar principle to an aerosol spray). The nozzle opening was closed by a <b>pin</b> valve <b>lifted</b> by the camshaft to initiate the fuel injection before top dead centre (TDC). This is called an air-blast injection. Driving the compressor used some power but the efficiency and net power output was more than any other combustion engine at that time.|$|R

50|$|The clock with Gothic angle pillars {{was made}} in 1541. The drum (big music cylinder) part of the clock {{was built in the}} {{enlarged}} frame by Willem Spraackel round 1690. It chimes every quarter of the hour with on half and full hour the full strike on lowest bell, the bourdon of the carillon. (half full strike on a large smaller bell) this is called 'Hollandse slag' (Dutch strike). In 1690 the clock was changed into one with a pendulum an invention by Christiaan Huygens around this time. The drum plays a short melody on the four quarters of all hours of the natural day. This has been a tradition in Alkmaar since first bells were hang on the towers in the 1540s. Also in the night man {{had to be able to}} hear what time it was. The city carillonneur changes the melodies on the drum twice a year. This is called 'versteken' (remove and insertion of the <b>pins</b> which <b>lift</b> the hammers on the bells).|$|R
50|$|Above the big wheel, {{the count}} wheel {{is mounted on}} the front of the clock outside the clock frame. The count wheel has 78 teeth on the outside, and the 12 notches are on the inside of the count wheel. The main arbor has an 8-tooth pinion which drives the count wheel. This {{directly}} reflects the ratio of strikes to <b>lifting</b> <b>pins</b> on the main wheel, as each turn of the count wheel has to produce 78 strikes (the total of numbers 1 through 12). One turn of the count wheel is equal to 9¾ turns of the big wheel.|$|R

50|$|To keep weight low, {{fiberglass}} fenders and hood were used. The hood {{featured a}} functional hood scoop and four hood <b>pins</b> for full <b>lift</b> off {{removal of the}} hood. Lightweight acid dipped steel doors with thin side window glass were used. The doors lacked a window mechanism and to slide the windows, a strap {{was attached to the}} bottom of the glass. To keep glass up, the strap latched to the inside of the door. The interior included only two bucket seats from a Dodge van. Center console, heater, sound deadeners, side view mirrors, radio, carpeting, and even arm rests were deleted to save weight.|$|R
50|$|Serinettes {{are housed}} in a wooden case, {{normally}} of walnut, and typically measuring 265 × 200 × 150 mm. The instrument is played by turning a crank mounted on the front. The crank pumps a bellows to supply air to the pipes, and also turns a wooden barrel by means of gears. Driven into the barrel are brass pins and staples with which the pieces of music are encoded. Mounted over the barrel is a bar carrying wooden keys connected to valves by vertical wooden rods. As the barrel turns, the <b>pins</b> and staples <b>lift</b> the keys, in turn opening the valves to let air into the pipes, which are located {{at the rear of}} the instrument. Tunes are selected by first lifting the bar carrying the keys, then shifting the barrel along its length. This brings a different set of pins and staples in line with the keys.|$|R
5000|$|As {{the slide}} of the pistol enters battery, the striker engages the sear. At this point, the sear is held {{back in a}} {{partially}} cocked condition. When the trigger of the M&P is pulled, the trigger bar first engages the firing <b>pin</b> safety plunger, <b>lifting</b> it upward, and releasing firing pin safety. At the rearward extreme of the trigger bar's travel, it engages the sear. The sear is rotated downward by the trigger bar, fully cocking, then releasing the striker. The striker makes contact with the primer of the chambered round, which in turn ignites the gunpowder and propels the bullet forward. According to renowned M&P gunsmith Dan Burwell, the angle on the rear face of the sear creates a camming action against the striker. This camming action moves the striker to the rear very slightly during the trigger pull, thus finishing the [...] "cocking". This system {{is similar to the}} partially tensioned striker found in the Glock series of pistols. When the pistol cycles for the next shot, the striker will be automatically pre-set in a 98% cocked position. Because the striker is only 98% cocked prior to the trigger being pulled, Smith & Wesson classifies the M&P's action as [...] "striker fired (double action only)".|$|R
60|$|Bathsheba {{held the}} note {{in her right}} hand. Boldwood handed towards her a plate of cut bread-and-butter; when, {{in order to take}} a slice, she put the note into her left hand, where she was still holding the purse, and then allowed her hand to drop beside her close to the canvas. The moment had come for saving his game, and Troy impulsively felt that he would play the card. For yet another time he looked at the fair hand, and saw the pink finger-tips, and the blue veins of the wrist, encircled by a {{bracelet}} of coral chippings which she wore: how familiar it all was to him! Then, with the lightning action in which he was such an adept, he noiselessly slipped his hand under the bottom of the tent-cloth, which was far from being <b>pinned</b> tightly down, <b>lifted</b> it a little way, keeping his eye to the hole, snatched the note from her fingers, dropped the canvas, and ran away in the gloom towards the bank and ditch, smiling at the scream of astonishment which burst from her. Troy then slid down {{on the outside of the}} rampart, hastened round in the bottom of the entrenchment to a distance of a hundred yards, ascended again, and crossed boldly in a slow walk towards the front entrance of the tent. His object was now to get to Pennyways, and prevent a repetition of the announcement until such time as he should choose.|$|R
50|$|A set of levers called keys is {{positioned}} {{just above the}} surface of the barrel. Each key corresponds to one pitch. A rod is connected to the rear of each key. The other end of the rod is a metal pin which operates a valve within the wind chest. When the instrument is played (by turning the crank), offsets on the crank shaft cause bellows to open and close to produce pressurized air. A reservoir/regulator maintains a constant pressure. A worm gear on the crank shaft causes the barrel to rotate slowly and its <b>pins</b> and staples <b>lift</b> the fronts of the keys. This causes {{the other end of the}} key to press down on the end of the rod which, in turn, activates the valve and allows air from the bellows to pass into the corresponding pipe. To allow different tunes to be played from one barrel, the barrel can be moved laterally to bring a different set of pins and staples under the keys. Street barrel organs usually play 7 to 9 tunes, although small organs (usually the older ones) can play up to 15 tunes. Less commonly (and usually for large orchestrions) the pinning will form one continuous spiral and the barrel will be gradually moved as it rotates so that the pins remain lined up with the keys. In this case, each barrel plays only one long tune.|$|R
50|$|The {{release lever}} (L) holds the rack (M) {{up when the}} clock is not striking. On the shaft of the minute hand (not shown), which rotates once per hour, there is a {{projection}}. As the change of the hour approaches, this projection slowly lifts the release lever, allowing the rack to fall until its point rests on the snail (N). The amount the rack can fall, and thus the number of strikes, {{is determined by the}} position of the snail. Exactly on the hour the striking train (G, H, K) is released and begins to turn. As it turns, the <b>pins</b> (G) repeatedly <b>lift</b> the hammer (F) and allow it to drop, ringing the gong (E). The gear ratios are arranged so that the gear wheel (H) makes one revolution each strike. A small pin (S) on this wheel engages the rack teeth, lifting the rack up by one tooth each turn. When the rack reaches the end of its teeth it stops the striking train from turning (using a mechanism not shown in the diagram, {{in such a way that}} gear (H) is held stationary with the pin (S) not engaging the rack, so that the rack is able to fall freely again on the next hour). So the number of strikes is equal to the number of teeth of the rack which are used, which depends on the position of the snail.|$|R
5000|$|The 'Double Three-legged Gravity Escapement' {{shown here}} {{is a form of}} {{escapement}} first devised by a barrister named Bloxam and later improved by Lord Grimthorpe. It is the standard for all really accurate 'Tower' clocks. [...] In the animation shown here the two [...] "gravity arms" [...] are coloured blue and red. The two three-legged escape wheels are also coloured blue and red. They work in two parallel planes so that the blue wheel only impacts the locking block on the blue arm and the red wheel only impacts the red arm. In a real escapement these impacts give rise to loud audible [...] "ticks" [...] and these are indicated by the appearance of a * beside the locking blocks. The three black <b>lifting</b> <b>pins</b> are key to the operation of the escapement. They cause the weighted gravity arms to be raised by an amount indicated by the pair of parallel lines {{on each side of the}} escapement. This gain in potential energy is the energy given to the pendulum on each cycle. For the Trinity College Cambridge Clock a mass of around 50 grams is lifted through 3 mm each 1.5 seconds - which works out to 1 mW of power. The driving power from the falling weight is about 12 mW, so t{{here is a}} substantial excess of power used to drive the escapement. Much of this energy is dissipated in the acceleration and deceleration of the frictional [...] "fly" [...] attached to the escape wheels.|$|R
5000|$|In {{a typical}} hemp system, a [...] "line set" [...] {{consists}} of multiple hemp lines running from a batten above the stage {{up to the}} grid, through loft blocks to a headblock and then down to the fly floor where they are tied off in a group to a belaying pin on the <b>pin</b> rail. The <b>lift</b> lines and hand (operating) lines {{are one and the}} same. Typically, a lift line runs from the sand bag (counterweight) assigned to a specific line set, up to [...] "a single loft block" [...] above the fly floor and back down to the fly floor. A trim clamp (a.k.a. knuckle-buster) or a [...] "Sunday" [...] (a circle of wire rope) is used to attach this sandbag to the [...] "line set" [...] to balance the load placed on the batten. The sandbags are usually filled to weigh the same as the loads, making the two weights (the weight of the batten and the weight of the bag) equal. This arrangement assures greater safety. When the flyman wishes to fly a batten (scenery or lights) [...] "In" [...] (i.e., to the floor), the flyman pulls down on the lift line thereby raising the sandbag off the fly floor and the batten descends. When the flyman wishes to fly the batten [...] "Out", he pulls down on the line set (leaving it tied off) and the batten flies out as the sand bag descends to the flyfloor. This arrangement allows the flyman to control the speed of ascent and/or descent and provides greater safety for people on the stage below. The proper [...] "Out" [...] position for the batten is set when the sand bag reaches the fly floor in its descent (adjustable) and the proper [...] "In" [...] position for the batten is established when the line set (previously tied off to the pin rail) is fully extended (adjustable). This makes it unnecessary to [...] "spike" [...] or [...] "mark" [...] either the line set or the lift line. (An [...] "unbalanced working line set" [...] should never be allowed to exist over the stage.) ...|$|R
