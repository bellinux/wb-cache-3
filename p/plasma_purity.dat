40|$|Multiple myeloma is a {{heterogeneous}} disease, which {{is characterized by}} the occurrence of specific genomic abnormalities that are both of diagnostic and prognostic relevance. Since the detection of these abnormalities through molecular-genetic techniques is hampered by the overall low percentage of plasma cells present in primary bone marrow aspirates, we assessed the efficacy of these techniques in enriched plasma cell fractions from 61 multiple myeloma patients. Using interphase FISH, genomic abnormalities could be detected in 96 % of the enriched samples as compared to 61 % in the cultured whole bone marrow samples.

40|$|Evaluation and {{diagnosis}} of blood alterations {{is a common}} request for clinical laboratories, requiring a complex technological approach and dedication of health resources. In this paper, we present a microfluidic device that owing to a novel combination of hydrodynamic and dielectrophoretic techniques can separate plasma from fresh blood in a microfluidic channel {{and for the first}} time allows optical real-time monitoring of the components of plasma without pre- or post-processing. The microchannel is based on a set of dead-end branches at each side and is initially filled using capillary forces with a 2 -mu L droplet of fresh blood. During this process, stagnation zones are generated at the dead-end branches and some red blood cells (RBCs) are trapped there. An electric field is then applied and dielectrophoretic trapping of RBCs is used to prevent more RBCs entering into the channel, which works like a sieve. Besides, an electroosmotic flow is generated to sweep the rest of the RBCs from the central part of the channel. Consequently, an RBC-free zone of plasma is formed in the middle of the channel, allowing real-time monitoring of the platelet behavior. To study the generation of stagnation zones and to ensure RBC trapping in the initial constrictions, two numerical models were solved. The proposed experimental design separates up to 0. 1 mu L blood plasma from a 2 -mu L fresh human blood droplet.

40|$|In future, {{high power}} density fusion devices, {{the need to}} prevent {{excessive}} local deposition of the plasma energy efflux on the first-wall surfaces is a critical design consideration {{in order to maintain}} the integrity of such surfaces. This requirement must be met without significant impact on <b>plasma</b> <b>purity</b> or overall plasma confinement. For the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER), these constraints have led to the following design criteria [1] P{sub rad}/(P{sub input} + P{sub {alpha}}) = 83 %, P{sub rad,core}/(P{sub input} + P{sub {alpha}}) = 33 %, P{sub target}/P{sub loss} = 17 %, Z{sub eff} 0. 85. Here, P{sub loss} is the power flowing out of the core (i. e., P{sub input} + P{sub {alpha}} - P{sub rad,core}) and P{sub target} is the power conducted to the target plate. These criteria represent a compromise between obtaining sufficient radiation to reduce the target heat load to a tolerable level, minimizing core fuel dilution, and maintaining sufficient power flow through the edge plasma to maintain H-mode confinement. Past experiments have had difficulty achieving these conditions simultaneously when using seeded impurities, and therefore there has been some concern regarding the viability of the ITER design. However, recent experiments in DIII-D using the puff and pump technique with argon as the seeded impurity have demonstrated the compatibility of these design constraints. In particular, steady-state plasma conditions have been achieved with P{sub rad}/P{sub input} = 72 %, P{sub rad,core}/P{sub input} = 16 %, P{sub target}/P{sub loss} = 17 %, Z{sub eff} = 1. 85, and {tau}{sub E}/{tau}{sub E,ITER 93 H} = 1. 05...|$|E

40|$|The {{excitation}} {{of a novel}} kind {{of heavy}} particle [1, 2] mode {{at the edge of}} the plasma column is considered as the signature of the I-con nement Regime [37]. The outward transport of impurities produced by this mode is in fact consistent with the observed expulsion of them from the main body of the plasma column (a high degree of <b>plasma</b> <b>purity</b> is a necessary feature for fusion burning plasmas capable of approaching ignition). Moreover, the theoretically predicted mode phase velocity, in the direction of the electron diamagnetic velocity, has been con rmed by relevant experimental analyses [8] of the excited uctuations (around 200 kHz). The plasma rotation" in the direction of the ion diamagnetic velocity is also consistent, according to the Accretion Theory [9] of this phenomenon, with the direction of the mode phase velocity. Another feature of the mode that predicted by the theory is that the I-Regime exhibits a knee of the ion temperature {{at the edge of the}} plasma column but not one of the particle density as the mode excitation factor is the relative main ion temperature gradient exceeding the local relative density gradient. The net plasma current density appearing in the saturation stage of the relevant instability, where the induced particle and energy uxes are drastically reduced, is associated with the signi cant amplitudes of the poloidal magnetic eld uctuations [6, 7] observed to accompany the density uctuations.

40|$|Abstract. The {{issue of}} “First wall {{materials}} & compatibility with ITER /DEMO relevant plasmas ” {{is among the}} R&D missions for possible new European plasma fusion devices that the FAST project will address. FAST can operate with ITER relevant values of P/R (up to 22 MW/m, against the ITER 24 MW/m, inclusive of the � particles power), thanks to its compactness; thus it can investigate the physics of large heat loads on divertor plates. The FAST divertor will be made of bulk W tiles, for basic operations, but also fully toroidal divertor targets made of liquid lithium (L-Li) are foreseen. To have reliable predictions of the thermal loads on the divertor plates and of the core <b>plasma</b> <b>purity</b> a number of numerical self-consistent simulations have been made for the H-mode and steady-state scenario by using the code COREDIV. This code, already validated in the past on experimental data (namely JET, FTU, Textor), is able to describe self-consistently the core and edge plasma in a tokamak device by imposing the continuity of energy and particle fluxes and of particle densities and temperatures at the separatrix. In the present work the results of such calculations will be illustrated, including heat loads on the divertor. The overall picture shows that, marginally in the intermediate and, necessarily in the high density H-mode scenarios (= 2 and 5 · 10 20 m- 3 respectively), impurity seeding should be foreseen with W as target material: however, {{only a small amount}} of Ar (0. 03 % atomic concentration), not affecting the core purity, is sufficient to maintain the divertor peak loads below 18 MW/m 2, that represents the safety limit for th...|$|E

Microfluidic platforms present {{an opportunity for}} low cost, portable diagnostic sensors through manipulation of small volumes of fluids on isolated, compact devices. One of the challenges of microfluidic sensors is the biological sample pretreatment steps that are manually performed prior to on-chip loading and sensing. This issue is especially prominent for human blood, which contains about a billion cells in one milliliter total volume. These blood cells can rupture, clog devices, block optical readouts, and foul electrodes. At the same time, the liquid portion of human blood, plasma, is rich {{in a variety of}} disease indicators, many of which have not yet been identified, and thus is an essential part in the diagnostic field. This thesis focuses on the design of a small, around 1 cm long, microfluidic device that separates out blood plasma from undiluted human blood. This design does not require any external field or equipment, beyond a loading syringe and collection tubing. The separation results show 10 - 100 times improvement in <b>plasma</b> <b>purity</b> over the literature values for passive separation designs. This separation system was then combined with a colorimetric malaria sensor that produced a visually detectable colored result with a 7. 5 nM limit of detection in whole blood.

Fast infra-red camera measurements show broad deposition profiles during type I ELMs and energy densi-ties of ~ 0. 12 MJm- 2. During the recent D-T experiments, the codeposition of tritium on cold shadowed surfaces in the inner divertor has been identified as an important form of long-term tritium retention.

Analysis of very pronounced examples showed that the number of peaks per toroidal turn is 1 or 2, which is clearly lower than the corresponding numbers in linear stability calculations.

SMPs may be considered as a signature of the non-linearELMphase originating at the separatrix or further inside. Thus they provide a handle to investigate the transition from linear to non-linear ELM phase. By comparison with data from gas puff imaging processes in the non-linear phase at or inside the separatrix and in the scrape-off layer (SOL) can be correlated.

Be is selected owing to its low atomic number, its low tritium retention and excellent getter properties, but material erosion limits the lifetime of plasma-facing components PFCs made of Be. Initial ERO modelling of the shaped Be first wall modules close to the ITER separatrix predict high erosion rates and limited armour lifetime. However, uncertainties in the modelling, in particular in the atomic data and sputtering yields, still exist and further bench- mark under ITER-comparable tokamak conditions is required.

The phenomenon of tachyphylaxis associated with repeated doses of DDAVP (4) limits its utility even in patients with type 1 disease undergoing major surgery or trauma since in these settings, higher levels of vWF need to be maintained for several days.

When the interparticle distance in the structure is constant and particle positions have good time stability this structure was defined like "plasma crystal". Otherwise, we observed process of the "dusty crystal" melting and in that case structure was defined like "dusty liquid". Experimental data were obtained by using computer-based measure system, which lets us to see, record and analyse images of the macroparticle structure in "laser sheet" cross section. Experimental investigations of dusty structure growth by consistent dosed injections of the macroparticles into the {{glow discharge}} plasma are carried out. These experiments with good statistical reliability showed that the mean interparticle distance inside the structure is constant regardless of the structure volume. Invariability of the structure volume during the process of dusty crystal melting was established. Comment: 12 th International Congress on Plasma Physics, 25 - 29 October 2004, Nice (France...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The plasma {{membrane}} (PM) is a compartment of significant interest because cell surface proteins influence {{the way in}} which a cell interacts with its neighbours and its extracellular environment. However, PM is hard to isolate because of its low abundance. Aqueous two-phase affinity purification (2 PAP), based on PEG/Dextran two-phase fractionation and lectin affinity for PM-derived microsomes, is an emerging method for the isolation of high <b>purity</b> <b>plasma</b> membranes from several vertebrate sources. In contrast, PM isolation techniques in important invertebrate genetic model systems, such as Drosophila melanogaster, have relied upon enrichment by density gradient centrifugation. To facilitate genetic investigation of activities contributing to the content of the PM sub-proteome, we sought to adapt 2 PAP to this invertebrate model to provide a robust PM isolation technique for Drosophila. Results We show that 2 PAP alone does not completely remove contaminating endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondrial membrane. However, a novel combination of density gradient centrifugation plus 2 PAP results in a robust PM preparation. To demonstrate the utility of this technique we isolated PM from fly heads and successfully identified 432 proteins using MudPIT, of which 37 % are integral membrane proteins from all compartments. Of the 432 proteins, 22 % have been previously assigned to the PM compartment, and a further 34 % are currently unassigned to any compartment and represent candidates for assignment to the PM. The remainder have previous assignments to other compartments. Conclusion A combination of density gradient centrifugation and 2 PAP results in a robust, high purity PM preparation from Drosophila, something neither technique can achieve on its own. This novel preparation should lay the groundwork for the proteomic investigation of the PM in different genetic backgrounds in Drosophila. Our results also identify two key steps in this procedure: The optimization of membrane partitioning in the PEG/Dextran mixture, and careful choice of the correct lectin for the affinity purification step in light of variations in bulk membrane lipid composition and glycosylation patterns respectively. This points the way for further adaptations into other systems. </p...|$|R
40|$|Experimental {{research}} on the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) will go far beyond what is possible on present-day tokamaks to address new and challenging issues in the physics of reactor-like plasmas. First and foremost, experiments in ITER will explore the physics issues of burning plasmas [...] plasmas that are dominantly self-heated by alpha-particles created by the fusion reactions themselves. Such issues will include (i) new plasma-physical effects introduced by the presence within the plasma of an intense population of energetic alpha particles; (ii) the physics of magnetic confinement for a burning plasma, which will involve a complex interplay of transport, stability and an internal self-generated heat source; and (iii) the physics of very-long-pulse/steady-state burning plasmas, in which much of the plasma current is also self-generated and which will require effective control of <b>plasma</b> <b>purity</b> and plasma-wall interactions. Achieving and sustaining burning plasma regimes in a tokamak necessarily requires plasmas that are larger than those in present experiments and have higher energy content and power flow, as well as much longer pulse length. Accordingly, the experimental program on ITER will embrace the study of issues of plasma physics and plasma-materials interactions that are specific to a reactor-scale fusion experiment. Such issues will include (i) confinement physics for a tokamak in which, for the first time, the core-plasma and the edge-plasma are simultaneously in a reactor-like regime; (ii) phenomena arising during plasma transients, including so-called disruptions, in regimes of high plasma current and thermal energy; and (iii) physics of a radiative divertor designed for handling high power flow for long pulses, including novel plasma and atomic-physics effects as well as materials science of surfaces subject to intense plasma interaction. Experiments on ITER will be conducted by researchers in control rooms situated at major fusion laboratories around the world, linked by high-speed computer networks [...] thus extending further what is already a much-acclaimed paradigm for international collaboration in science...|$|E
40|$|Thin liquid layers {{have been}} {{proposed}} for heat extraction and protection of the solid surfaces of divertors in magnetic fusion reactors. A number of conceptual designs for plasma-facing components (PFC) use stationary and flowing liquid layers as a renewable first wall for reactor chambers to remove heat and shield solid surfaces from damaging radiation while maintaining acceptable <b>plasma</b> <b>purity</b> levels. Such liquid-protected PFC {{have the potential to}} make fusion more commercially attractive by increasing reactor lifetimes and decreasing failure rates. The results of this research will help identify the parameter ranges for successful operation of such protection schemes. This thesis investigates the thermocapillary behavior of axisymmetric horizontal liquid layers with initial heights from 0. 27 to 3. 0 mm. A negative radial temperature gradient is imposed {{at the bottom of the}} liquid layer. Experimental, numerical and asymptotic analyses were carried out for thin layers where buoyancy forces are negligible. A novel asymptotic solution for this axisymmetric geometry was derived from the previous two-dimensional long-wave analysis by Sen et al. (1982). A numerical simulation using the level contour reconstruction method was used to follow the evolution of the liquid-gas interface above an axisymmetric non-isothermal solid surface. Experimental validation of the theoretical and numerical studies was performed using silicone oils of various viscosities (μ = 0. 48 × 10 - 2 9. 6 × 10 - 2 N s/m 2). Two measurement techniques, a needle contact method and laser-confocal displacement method, were employed to obtain height profiles for applied temperature differences up to 65 °C. Finally, reflectance shadowgraphy was used to visualize free-surface deformation and classify flow regimes in thick layers, where the assumptions of negligible buoyancy and axisymmetric flow are no longer valid. The results of this investigation will allow designers to determine operating windows for successful implementation of liquid-protected PFC. Ph. D.

40|$|The ASDEX Upgrade (AUG) {{programme}} {{is directed}} towards physics input to critical {{elements of the}} ITER design and the preparation of ITER operation, as well as addressing physics issues for a future DEMO design. Since 2015, AUG {{is equipped with a}} new pair of 3 -strap ICRF antennas, which were designed for a reduction of tungsten release during ICRF operation. As predicted, a factor two reduction on the ICRF-induced W plasma content could be achieved by the reduction of the sheath voltage at the antenna limiters via the compensation of the image currents of the central and side straps in the antenna frame. There are two main operational scenario lines in AUG. Experiments with low collisionality, which comprise current drive, ELM mitigation/suppression and fast ion physics, are mainly done with freshly boronized walls to reduce the tungsten influx at these high edge temperature conditions. Full ELM suppression and non-inductive operation up to a plasma current of I p= 0. 8 could be obtained at low plasma density. Plasma exhaust is studied under conditions of high neutral divertor pressure and separatrix electron density, where a fresh boronization is not required. Substantial progress could be achieved for the understanding of the confinement degradation by strong D puffing and the improvement with nitrogen or carbon seeding. Inward/outward shifts of the electron density profile relative to the temperature profile effect the edge stability via the pressure profile changes and lead to improved/decreased pedestal performance. Seeding and D gas puffing are found to effect the core fueling via changes in a region of high density on the high field side (HFSHD). The integration of all above mentioned operational scenarios will be feasible and naturally obtained in a large device where the edge is more opaque for neutrals and higher plasma temperatures provide a lower collisionality. The combination of exhaust control with pellet fueling has been successfully demonstrated. High divertor enrichment values of nitrogen E N>= 10 have been obtained during pellet injection, which is a prerequisite for the simultaneous achievement of good core <b>plasma</b> <b>purity</b> and high divertor radiation levels. Impurity accumulation observed in the all-metal AUG device caused by the strong neoclassical inward transport of tungsten in the pedestal is expected to be relieved by the higher neoclassical temperature screening in larger devices...|$|E
40|$|Équipe 107 : Physique des plasmas chaudsInternational audienceThe former all-carbon wall on JET {{has been}} {{replaced}} with beryllium in the main torus and tungsten in the divertor to mimic the surface materials envisaged for ITER. Comparisons are presented between type I H-mode characteristics in each design by examining respective scans over deuterium fuelling and impurity seeding, required to ameliorate exhaust loads both in JET at full capability and in ITER. Attention is focused upon a common high-triangularity, single-null divertor configuration at 2. 5 MA, q(95) approximate to 3. 5 yielding the most robust all-C performance. Contrasting results between the alternative linings are found firstly in unseeded <b>plasmas,</b> for which <b>purity</b> is improved and intrinsic radiation reduced in the ITER-like wall (ILW) but normalized energy confinement is approximate to 30 % lower than in all-C counterparts, owing to a commensurately lower (electron) pedestal temperature. Divertor recycling is also radically altered, with slower, inboard-outboard asymmetric transients at ELMs and spontaneous oscillations in between them. Secondly, nitrogen seeding elicits opposite responses in the ILW to all-C experience, tending to raise plasma density, reduce ELM frequency, and above all to recover (electron) pedestal pressure, hence global confinement, almost back to previous levels. A hitherto unrecognized role of light impurities in pedestal stability and dynamics is consequently suggested. Thirdly, while heat loads on the divertor outboard target between ELMs are successfully reduced {{in proportion to the}} radiative cooling and ELM frequency effects of N in both wall environments, more surprisingly, average power ejected by ELMs also declines in the same proportion for the ILW. Detachment between transients is simultaneously promoted. Finally, inter-ELM W sources in the ILW divertor tend to fall with N input, although core accumulation possibly due to increased particle confinement still leads to significantly less steady conditions than in all-C plasmas. This limitation of ILW H-modes so far will be readdressed in future campaigns to continue progress towards a fully integrated scenario suitable for D-T experiments on JET and for `baseline' operation on ITER.
