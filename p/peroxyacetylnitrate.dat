40|$|Abstract. The {{impact of}} acetone (or any HO•: source) on tropospheric photochem-istry is {{largest in the}} high NO • regime. The {{fractional}} increases in OH and ozone production associated with acetone increase rapidly with NO • when NO • mixing ratios become larger than 300 parts per trillion by volume (pptv). This occurs {{in part because the}} HOx yield of acetone is larger at higher NO • mixing ratios, going from about 1 HO • at NO • • 10 pptvto 3 HO • at NO • • 1000 pptv. We also investigate the effect of acetone on the partitioning of the NOy family. Acetone increases the conversion of NO to NO 2, HNO 4, HNO 3, and <b>peroxyacetylnitrate</b> (PAN). Conversion of NO to PAN dominates at low NO•, while conversion of NO to HNO 3 dominates at high NOx. These NO decreases significantly diminish the increases in OH and ozone production one would otherwise anticipate from the increases in HOe. In particular, acetone can be expected to reduce ozone production for NO • < 25 pptv. We also show that most of the changes in species concentrations arising from the introduction of a HOx source can be accurately predicted using simple expressions derived from linear perturbation theory. 1...|$|E

The photochemical point model reproduces the observed NO 2 /NO concentration ratio to within 30 %, and has similar success in simulating observed concentrations of peroxides (H 2 O 2, CH 3 OOH), lending confidence in its use to investigate ozone chemistry.

Median NOy concentrations declined from 947 ppt in May to 444 ppt by July. NOy fluxes were observed {{into and out}} of the snow, but the magnitudes were usually below 1 μmol m− 2 h− 1 because of the low HNO 3 concentration and weak turbulence over the snow surface. Some of the highest observed fluxes may be due to temporary storage by equilibrium sorption of <b>peroxyacetylnitrate</b> (PAN) or other organic nitrogen species on ice surfaces in the upper snowpack. Sublimation of snow at the surface or during blowing snow events is associated with efflux of NOy from the snowpack. Because the NOy fluxes during summer at Summit are bidirectional and small in magnitude, the net result of turbulent NOyexchange is insignificant compared to the 2 μmol m− 2 d− 1 mean input from fresh snow during the summer months. If the arctic NOy reservoir is predominantly PAN (or compounds with similar properties), thermal dissociation of this NOy is sufficient to support the observed flux of nitrate in fresh snow.

OMI NO 2 satellite observations constrain Asian anthropogenic NOx emissions and indicate a factor of 2 increase from 2000 to 2006 in China. Satellite observations of CO from AIRS and TES indicate two major events of Asian transpacific pollution during INTEX-B. Correlation between TES CO and ozone observations shows evidence for transpacific ozone pollution. The semi-permanent Pacific High and Aleutian Low cause splitting of transpacific pollution plumes over the Northeast Pacific.

This study {{focuses on}} the effects of subgrid (on general {{circulation}} model (GCM) scales) convective venting of the planetary boundary layer to the free troposphere and on the interactive effects of aerosols, ozone, UV actinic flux, and radiative forcing of climate. We developed a single-column chemical transport model (SCCTM) consistent with the global Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS) GCM and Chemical Transport Model (CTM). The SCCTM includes vertical transport by convection, turbulent mixing, a flexible photochemical scheme, and interactive calculations of radiative fluxes and photolysis rates. The model is designed as a chemical and physical core to be used in a completely interactive GCM. At this time it is driven by data from the GEOS Data Assimilation System archived by the Data Assimilation Office at NASA Goddard. We simulated an ozone/aerosol pollution episode in the Baltimore-Washington region and a convective event in the central United States. These physically distinct case studies provide a thorough test for the chemical scheme and physical parameterizations employed in the SCCTM. The ozone episode simulation showed strong sensitivity to aerosol optical depth, with increased average PBL ozone due to the effects of aerosols on photolysis rates. Observed aerosols produced a surface cooling of up to 100 W m- 2 and stabilized the atmosphere suppressing convection. In the convective event over Oklahoma a squall line carried pollutants into the free troposphere increasing 03 by up to 35 ppbv and <b>peroxyacetylnitrate</b> by up to 400 pptv.

Global CO column distributions in MOPITT and GEOS-CHEM are highly correlated (R 2 = 0. 87), with no significant model bias. The largest regional bias is over Southeast Asia, where the model is 18 % too high. A 60 % decrease of regional biomass burning emissions in the model (to 39 Tg yr− 1) would correct the discrepancy; this result is consistent with TRACE-P observations. MOPITT and TRACE-P also give consistent constraints on the Chinese source of CO from fuel combustion (181 Tg CO yr− 1). Four major events of trans-Pacific transport of Asian pollution in spring 2001 were seen by MOPITT, in situ platforms, and GEOS-CHEM. One of them was sampled by TRACE-P (26 – 27 February) as a succession of pollution layers over the northeast Pacific. These layers all originated from one single event of Asian outflow that split into northern and southern plumes over the central Pacific. The northern plume (sampled at 6 – 8 km off California) had no ozone enhancement. The southern subsiding plume (sampled at 2 – 4 km west of Hawaii) contained a 8 – 17 ppbv ozone enhancement, driven by decomposition of <b>peroxyacetylnitrate</b> (PAN) to nitrogen oxides (NOx).

The largest differences in the abundance of <b>peroxyacetylnitrate</b> (PAN) were found when the isoprene emission strength was reduced by 50 % and in tests with increased or decreased efficiency of the deposition of intermediates. The deposition assumptions were also {{found to have a}} significant effect on the upper tropospheric HO x production. Different implicit assumptions about the loss of intermediate products were identified as a major reason for the deviations among the tested isoprene oxidation schemes. The total tropospheric burden of O 3 calculated in the sensitivity runs is increased compared to the background methane chemistry by 26 ± 9   Tg(O 3) from 273 to an average from the sensitivity runs of 299 Tg(O 3). % revised Thus, there is a spread of ± 35 % of the overall effect of isoprene in the model among the tested scenarios. This range of uncertainty and the much larger local deviations found in the test runs suggest that the treatment of isoprene in global models can only be seen as a first order estimate at present, and points towards specific processes in need of focused future work...|$|E
40|$|Aerosol {{sampling}} for {{the determination}} of the concentrations of soluble ionic species and the natural radionuclides 7 Be and 210 Pb was conducted from the NASA DC- 8 over the western Pacific as part of GTE/PEM-West B during February-March 1994. Concentrations of most soluble ionic species in the free troposphere were higher in samples collected on flights originating from Hong Kong and Japan than those collected further east over the open ocean. In both regions the measured concentrations were higher than those found during PEM-West A (fall 1991). Activities of 210 Pb, a tracer of air masses influenced by sources on the Asian continent, showed the same patterns. These data indicate the effect of stronger continental outflow from Asia over the western Pacific during the spring compared to fall season. For readily scavenged aerosol-associated species and soluble acidic gases the strongest indications of Asian outflow were restricted to altitudes below 6 km. The distribution of the continental tracer 210 Pb was also compared to those {{of a large number of}} gas phase species measured on the DC- 8. Relatively strong correlations were found with O 3 and <b>peroxyacetylnitrate</b> (PAN), but only during the flights over the remote Pacific. During PEM-West A, similar correlations were seen, but they were stronger near Asia. We believe that these correlations are a signature of continental air that has been processed by deep wet convection over land before being advected over the ocean. One flight over the Sea of Japan provided the opportunity to sample upper troposphere/lower stratosphere air in and around a tropopause fold. Concentrations of 7 Be reached 7 pCi m− 3 STP, and peak O 3 mixing ratios of 480 ppb were encountered at 10. 7 km. The 7 Be data are used to estimate the fraction of stratospheric air mixed down into the troposphere by circulation in the fold...|$|E
40|$|The Free Tropospheric Experiment (FREETEX' 98) was {{conducted}} at the Jungfraujoch Observatory in the Swiss Alps (3580 m above sea level) during the well-documented spring maximum in ozone. In spring the Jungfraujoch frequently lies in the free troposphere but can also be influenced by air from the planetary boundary layer. Measurements of NOx, NOy, <b>peroxyacetylnitrate</b> (PAN), HCHO, O 3, CO, nonmethane hydrocarbons, peroxy radicals, j(O 1 D), j(NO 2), {{and a variety of}} other tropospheric constituents crucial to ozone photochemical cycles were made over a 1 -month period. Two independent measurements of NOx, NOy, and PAN showed good agreement. Average free tropospheric daytime NO levels were about 50 pptv, sufficient to sustain photochemical ozone formation. Although high mixing ratios were encountered, PAN decomposition did not contribute to NOx production during FREETEX' 98. Ozone production efficiencies (EN) derived from observed ?O 3 /(NOz) ratios in free tropospheric air were 20 - 30 molecules of O 3 produced per NOx molecule oxidized and agreed well with a photochemical model. A much lower ozone production efficiency of 4 was determined in a photochemically aged air mass arriving from southern Europe, in line with other measurements and calculations in regimes containing high levels of oxidized nitrogen. Model simulations indicated that by sequestering NOx and HO 2, low-temperature formation of peroxynitric acid (PNA) decreased ozone production by 20 % and instantaneous ozone production efficiencies by 40 %, whereas PAN formation had little effect. The model reproduced well the observed sharp transformation from ozone production to ozone destruction (defined as ?O 3 /?(NOz) = 0) at 20 - 25 pptv NO. The observed and calculated strong dependence of EN on NOx concentration in the low-NOx regime highlights the difficulty in assigning a single O 3 production efficiency value to remote regions, where most of the CO and CH 4 in the atmosphere are oxidized...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} first {{description}} {{and evaluation of}} GEOS-CHEM, a global threedimensional (3 -D) model of tropospheric chemistry driven by assimilated meteorological observations from the Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS) of the NASA Data Assimilation Office (DAO). The model is applied to a 1 -year simulation of tropospheric ozone-NOx-hydrocarbon chemistry for 1994, and is evaluated with observations both for 1994 and for other years. It reproduces usually to within 10 ppb the concentrations of ozone observed from the worldwide ozonesonde data network. It simulates correctly the seasonal phases and amplitudes of ozone concentrations for different regions and altitudes, but tends to underestimate the seasonal amplitude at northern midlatitudes. Observed concentrations of NO and <b>peroxyacetylnitrate</b> (PAN) observed in aircraft campaigns are generally reproduced to within a factor of 2 and often much better. Concentrations of HNO 3 in the remote troposphere are overestimated typically {{by a factor of}} 2 – 3, a common problem in global models that may reflect a combination of insufficient precipitation scavenging and gas-aerosol partitioning not resolved by the model. The model yields an atmospheric lifetime of methylchloroform (proxy for global OH) of 5. 1 years, as compared to a best estimate from observations of 5. 5 +/− 0. 8 years, and simulates H 2 O 2 concentrations observed from aircraft with significant regional disagreements but no global bias. The OH concentrations are ∼ 20 % higher than in our previous global 3 -D model which included an UV-absorbing aerosol. Concentrations of CO tend to be underestimated by the model, often by 10 – 30 ppb, which could reflect a combination of excessive OH (a 20 % decrease in model OH could be accommodated by the methylchloroform constraint) and an underestimate of CO sources (particularly biogenic). The model underestimates observed acetone concentrations over the South Pacific in fall by a factor of 3; a missing source from the ocean may be implicated...|$|E
40|$|Measurements of {{nitrogen}} deposition and concentrations of NO, NO 2, NO y (total oxidized N), and O 3 {{have been made}} at Harvard Forest in central Massachusetts since 1990 to define the atmospheric budget for reactive N near a major source region. Total (wet plus dry) reactive N deposition for the period 1990 – 1996 averaged 47 mmol m− 2 yr− 1 (126 μmol m− 2 d− 1, 6. 4 kg N ha− 1 yr− 1), with 34 % contributed by dry deposition. Atmospheric input adds about 12 % to the N made available annually by mineralization in the forest soil. The corresponding deposition rate at a distant site, Schefferville, Quebec, was 20 mmol m− 2 d− 1 during summer 1990. Both heterogeneous and homogeneous reactions efficiently convert NO x to HNO 3 in the boundary layer. HNO 3 is subsequently removed rapidly by either dry deposition or precipitation. The characteristic (e-folding) time for NO x oxidation ranges from 0. 30 days in summer, when OH radical is abundant, to ∼ 1. 5 days in the winter, when heterogeneous reactions are dominant and O 3 concentrations are lowest. The characteristic time for removal of NO x oxidation products (defined as NO y minus NO x) from the boundary layer by wet and dry deposition is ∼ 1 day, except in winter when it decreases to 0. 6 day. Biogenic hydrocarbons contribute to N deposition through formation of organic nitrates but are also precursors of reservoir species, such as <b>peroxyacetylnitrate,</b> that may be exported from the region. A simple model assuming pseudo first-order rates for oxidation of NO x, followed by deposition, predicts that 45 % of NO x in the northeastern U. S. boundary layer is removed in 1 day during summer and 27 % is removed in winter. It takes 3. 5 and 5 days for 95 % removal in summer and winter, respectively...|$|E
40|$|Anthropogenic {{emissions}} of {{volatile organic compounds}} (VOC) in the troposphere and their consecutive degradation in presence of nitrogen oxides, result {{in the production of}} secondary products like ozone, nitric oxide and <b>peroxyacetylnitrate</b> (PAN). These pollutants seriously affect the environment and human health. In addition, certain VOCs contribute to the production of secondary organic aerosols (SOA), which also affect human health, act as substrates for heterogeneous chemical reactions, affect tropospheric chemistry and scatter solar radiation modifying atmospheric radiative forcing. A considerable percentage of these emissions, are due to the use of organic compounds as solvents i. e. compounds able to dissolve, suspend or extract other materials, without any chemical reactions to occur. This percentage in Europe is about 25 % of total anthropogenic {{emissions of}} non methane VOC. The understanding of the environmental changes due to the anthropogenic activities is facilitated by the study of the impact of solvent use emissions on tropospheric chemistry, both on local and global scales. In addition, because volatile compounds present different ability to produce pollutants, it is of particular interest to investigate if possible replacements of solvents in use with other new compounds, could lead in reduction of pollutant concentrations. Such global estimates are prohibited by the large number of species used as solvents today and hence, by the even greater number of chemical species that are involved in their atmospheric chemical degradation. To overpass these limitations for global models, a small number of compounds must be selected to represent in the model all solvents in use today. In addition a reduced degradation scheme has to be used, to maintain a limited number of chemical species suitable for consideration into a global model. The aim of the present study is the estimate of the impact of solvents in use and of their possible replacement with selected oxygenated compounds, on the oxidizing power of the atmosphere and particularly on ozone, nitric oxide, PAN and SOA levels. ...|$|E
40|$|The second Free Tropospheric Experiment (FREETEX ' 98) {{took place}} at the Jungfraujoch Observatory (3580 m above sea level), Switzerland, in March/April 1998. A number of trace gases and {{photolysis}} parameters were measured, including peroxy radicals (HO 2 +RO 2), the photolysis rate coefficients j(NO 2) and j(O 1 D), O 3, NOx, NOy, HCHO, <b>peroxyacetylnitrate</b> (PAN), CO, CN, and hydrocarbons. The average midday concentration of HO 2 +RO 2 observed during the campaign is 13 ± 3 parts per trillion by volume (pptv). The peroxy radical concentrations measured during FREETEX ' 98 are discussed in terms of the respective NO measurements and box model calculations. By screening out polluted and cloudy conditions during FREETEX ' 98, 8 relatively clean days are selected. These 8 days represent near free tropospheric conditions. The average midday concentration of HO 2 +RO 2 observed during these 8 days is 17 ± 5 pptv and the modeled diurnal cycle of [HO 2]+[CH 3 O 2] simulated by a photochemical box model shows very good agreement with the mean diurnal cycle of the peroxy radicals over these 8 days. The in situ net ozone production rate is calculated for each day during FREETEX ' 98 using the peroxy radical, j(O 1 D), NO, H 2 O, and O 3 measurements. The mean net ozone production rate during the 8 relatively clean selected days is 0. 09 ppbv h- 1. If more stringent criteria are applied, 3 free tropospheric days can be selected with a mean net ozone production rate of 0. 05 ± 0. 01 ppbv h- 1, indicating the positive role of in situ photochemistry during springtime in the free troposphere over the Alps and supporting the previous results of the first FREETEX campaign in April/May 1996. Using the experimental data, it is estimated that the ozone compensation point, that is, the point where photochemical ozone production equals destruction, occurs at 24 ± 9 pptv of NO in good agreement with theoretical calculations...|$|E
40|$|Climatologies of tropospheric NOx(NO + NO 2) and NOy (total {{reactive}} nitrogen: NOx + NO 3 + 2 x N 2 O 5 + HNO 2 + HNO 3 + HNO 4 + ClONO 2 + PAN (<b>peroxyacetylnitrate)</b> + other organic nitrates) {{have been}} compiled from data previously published and, in most cases, publicly archived. Emphasis {{has been on}} non-urban measurements, including rural and remote ground sites, as well as aircraft data. Although the distribution of data is sparse, a compilation in this manner can begin to provide {{an understanding of the}} spatial and temporal distributions of these reactive nitrogen species. The cleanest measurements in the boundary layer are in Alaska, northern Canada and the eastern Pacific, with median NO mixing ratios below 10 pptv, NOx below 50 pptv, and NOy below 300 pptv. The highest NO values (greater than 1 ppbv) were found in eastern North America and Europe, with correspondingly high NOy (similar to 5 ppbv). A significantly narrower range of concentrations is seen in the free troposphere, particularly at 3 - 6 km, with NO typically about 10 pptv in the boreal summer. NO increases with altitude to similar to 100 pptv at 9 - 12 km, whereas NOy does not show a trend with altitude, but varies between 100 and 1000 pptv. Decreasing mixing ratios eastward of the Asian and North American continents are seen in all three species at all altitudes. Model-generated climatologies of NOx and NOy from six chemical transport models are also presented and are compared with observations in the boundary layer and the middle troposphere for summer and winter. These comparisons test our understanding of the chemical and transport processes responsible for these species distributions. Although the model results show differences between them, and disagreement with observations, none are systematically different for all seasons and altitudes. Some {{of the differences between the}} observations and model results may likely be attributed to the specific meteorological conditions at the time that measurements were made differing from the model meteorology, which is either climatological how from GCMs or actual meteorology for an arbitrary year. Differences in emission inventories, and convection and washout schemes in the models will also affect the calculated NOx and NOy distributions. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd...|$|E
40|$|During the Tropospheric Ozone Production {{about the}} Spring Equinox (TOPSE) {{aircraft}} program, ozone depletion events (ODEs) {{in the high}} latitude surface layer were investigated using lidar and in situ instruments. Flight legs of 100 km or longer distance were flown 32 times at 30 m altitude over a variety of regions north of 58 ° between early February and late May 2000. ODEs were found on each flight over the Arctic Ocean but their occurrence was rare at more southern latitudes. However, large area events with depletion to over 2 km altitude in one case were found {{as far south as}} Baffin Bay and Hudson Bay and as late as 22 May. There is good evidence that these more southern events did not form in situ but were the result of export of ozone-depleted air from the surface layer of the Arctic Ocean. Surprisingly, relatively intact transport of ODEs occurred over distances of 900 – 2000 km and in some cases over rough terrain. Accumulation of constituents in the frozen surface over the dark winter period cannot be a strong prerequisite of ozone depletion since latitudes south of the Arctic Ocean would also experience a long dark period. Some process unique to the Arctic Ocean surface or its coastal regions remains unidentified for the release of ozone-depleting halogens. There was no correspondence between coarse surface features such as solid ice/snow, open leads, or polynyas with the occurrence of or intensity of ozone depletion over the Arctic or subarctic regions. Depletion events also occurred in the absence of long-range transport of relatively fresh “pollution” within the high latitude surface layer, at least in spring 2000. Direct measurements of halogen radicals were not made. However, the flights do provide detailed information on the vertical structure of the surface layer and, during the constant 30 m altitude legs, measurements of a variety of constituents including hydroxyl and peroxy radicals. A summary of the behavior of these constituents is made. The measurements were consistent with a source of formaldehyde from the snow/ice surface. Median NOx in the surface layer was 15 pptv or less, suggesting that surface emissions were substantially converted to reservoir constituents by 30 m altitude and that ozone production rates were small (0. 15 – 1. 5 ppbv/d) at this altitude. <b>Peroxyacetylnitrate</b> (PAN) was by far the major constituent of NOy in the surface layer independent of the ozone mixing ratio...|$|E
