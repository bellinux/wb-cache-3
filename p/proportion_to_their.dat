5|$|His {{early works}} in dynamics, {{the science of}} motion and {{mechanics}} were his circa 1590 Pisan De Motu (On Motion) and his circa 1600 Paduan Le Meccaniche (Mechanics). The former was based on Aristotelian–Archimedean fluid dynamics and held that the speed of gravitational fall in a fluid medium was proportional to the excess of a body's specific weight over that of the medium, whereby in a vacuum, bodies would fall with speeds in <b>proportion</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> specific weights. It also subscribed to the Philoponan impetus dynamics in which impetus is self-dissipating and free-fall in a vacuum would have an essential terminal speed according to specific weight after an initial period of acceleration.|$|E

In practice, the ECB's banknotes are put into circulation by the NCBs, thereby incurring matching liabilities vis-à-vis the ECB.

5|$|The {{bottlenose}} dolphin {{has a single}} blowhole located on the dorsal surface of the head consisting of a hole and a muscular flap. The flap is closed during muscle relaxation and opens during contraction. Dolphins are voluntary breathers, who must deliberately surface and open their blowholes to get air. They can store almost twice as much oxygen in <b>proportion</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> body weight as a human can: the dolphin can store 36 milliliters (ml) of oxygen per kg of body weight, compared with 20 ml per kg for humans. This is an adaptation to diving.

5|$|In Batesian mimicry {{the mimic}} shares signals {{similar to the}} model, but {{does not have the}} {{attribute}} that makes it unprofitable to predators (e.g., unpalatability). In other words, a Batesian mimic is a sheep in wolf's clothing. It is named after Henry Walter Bates, an English naturalist whose work on butterflies in the Amazon rainforest (described in The Naturalist on the River Amazons) was pioneering in this field of study. Mimics {{are less likely to be}} found out (for example by predators) when in low <b>proportion</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> model. This phenomenon is called negative frequency dependent selection, and it applies in most forms of mimicry. Batesian mimicry can only be maintained if the harm caused to the predator by eating a model outweighs the benefit of eating a mimic. The nature of learning is weighted in favor of the mimics, for a predator that has a bad first experience with a model tends to avoid anything that looks like it for a long time, and does not re-sample soon to see whether the initial experience was a false negative. However, if mimics become more abundant than models, then the probability of a young predator having a first experience with a mimic increases. Such systems are therefore most likely to be stable where both the model and the mimic occur, and where the model is more abundant than the mimic. This is not the case in Müllerian mimicry, which is described next.|$|E
5|$|The Intergroups in the European Parliament are {{informal}} fora which gather MEPs {{from various}} political groups around any topic. They do not express {{the view of}} the European Parliament. They serve a double purpose: to address a topic which is transversal to several committees and in a less formal manner. Their daily secretariat can be run either through the office of MEPs or through interest groups, be them corporate lobbies or NGOs. The favored access to MEPs which the organization running the secretariat enjoys can be one explanation to the multiplication of Intergroups in the 1990s. They are now strictly regulated and financial support, direct or otherwise (via Secretariat staff, for example) must be officially specified in a declaration of financial interests. Also Intergroups are established or renewed {{at the beginning of each}} legislature through a specific process. Indeed, the proposal for the constitution or renewal of an Intergroup must be supported by at least 3 political groups whose support is limited to a specific number of proposals in <b>proportion</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> size (for example, for the legislature 2014-2019, the EPP or S political groups could support 22 proposals whereas the Greens/EFA or the EFDD political groups only 7).|$|E

40|$|Growth of Leucaena leucocephala and Albizia lebbeck trees was {{investigated}} under low water {{supply in the}} field using a complete randomized block design at the Research and Experiments Station of the College of Food Science and Agriculture, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. The trees were irrigated at either 160 (well water supply) or 500 mm (low water supply) of a class "A" evaporation-pan records for two years. Differences were occurred between L. leucocephala and A. lebbeck trees across irrigation treatments with greater values for L. leucocephala {{in most of the}} growth characteristics measured. Comparing with L. leucocephala, leaves of A. lebbeck comprises only small proportion of the total weight of tree while allocated equal <b>proportions</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> branches and roots (41 %). while L. leucocephala trees allocated almost similar <b>proportions</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> branches, stem and roots (27 - 28 %). Low water supply decreased stem by 19. 5 % with stem diameter was unaffected. Leaf, branches, stem, root and consequently total dry weight of the trees decreases by 42, 51. 5, 45, 51 and 94 % in low water supply. However, the performance of L. leucocephala and A. lebbeck trees endured low irrigation conditions in terms of survival and maintaining reasonable growth.
