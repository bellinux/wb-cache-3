40|$|Purpose: This study compares {{incidence}} and mortality of penile cancer in Puerto Rico (PR) with other racial/ethnic {{groups in the}} United States (US) and evaluates the extent in which socioeconomic position index (SEP) or its components infl uence {{incidence and}} mortality in PR. Materials and Methods: Age-standardized rates were calculated for incidence and mor-tality {{based on data from}} the PR Cancer Registry and the US National Cancer Institute’s Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results program, using the direct method. Results: <b>PR</b> <b>men</b> had approximately 3 -fold higher incidence of penile cancer as compared to non-Hispanic white (Standardized rate ratio [SRR]: 3. 33; 95 %CI= 2. 80 - 3. 95). A higher incidence of penile cancer was also reported in <b>PR</b> <b>men</b> as compared to non-Hispanic blacks and Hispanics men.

40|$|Evidence {{suggests}} that Dutch people smoke substantially {{more than their}} British counterparts. These differences have been suggested to relate, in part, to the health-related policy {{differences between the two}} countries. It is unclear whether these differences affect smoking among ethnic minority groups in similar ways. We assessed whether the lower smoking prevalence in the U. K. general population compared with the Netherlands is also observed in ethnic minority groups (i. e., Dutch vs. English South Asians and Dutch- vs. English-Africans). We used similar surveys from the United Kingdom and the Netherlands to explore these questions. The response rate ranges from 60 % in the Health Survey for England and the SUNSET study to 67. 5 % in Newcastle Heart Project (n = 21, 429). After adjustment for other factors, compared with White-Dutch, the prevalence ratio (PR) of current smoking was lower in White-English <b>men</b> (<b>PR</b> = 0. 58, 95 % CI: 0. 49 - 0. 67) and women (PR = 0. 56, 0. 49 - 0. 65).

Similar to the White group, the prevalence of smoking was lower in South Asian and African men and women in England than their corresponding Dutch counterparts. These differences suggest that, among other factors, antismoking policies might have a similar influence on both ethnic majority and minority groups and illustrate the potential importance of national context on public health policy on ethnic minority groups' smoking behavio...|$|R

Healthy People 2000 objectives call {{for increasing the}} proportion of hypertensive men whose blood pressure is under control to at least 40 %. In addition, the objectives recommend reducing the prevalence of overweight to 41 % among hypertensive women, and to 35 % among hypertensive men (5). The Hispanic Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (HHANES) collected data on Mexican Americans (MA), Cuban Americans (CA), and Puerto Ricans (PR) living in the continental United States. A trained physician measured systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure twice in one visit. Our findings provide data to assess baseline estimates for several Healthy People 2000 objectives among Hispanics.

40|$|Abstract Background Maputo, the Mozambique capital, {{contrasts}} {{with the rest of}} the country with regard to its sociodemographic characteristics and patterns of tobacco exposure. We conducted a migrant study to compare the prevalence of manufactured-cigarette smoking and traditional forms of tobacco use among dwellers in the capital who were also born in Maputo City (MC/MC) with those born in southern (SP/MC) and northern (NP/MC) provinces, and additionally with inhabitants in the latter regions. Methods In 2003, a representative sample of 12, 902 Mozambicans aged 25 - 64 years was evaluated. We computed age- and education-adjusted prevalence ratios (PR) with 95 %-confidence intervals (95 %CI) using Poisson regression. Results The prevalence of any type of tobacco consumption among Maputo City inhabitants born in other provinces contrasted with the pattern observed in locally born inhabitants (SP/MC vs. MC/MC: <b>men,</b> <b>PR,</b> 0. 61; 95 %CI, 0. 44 - 0. 85; women, PR, 0. 38, 95 %CI, 0. 18 - 0. 79; NP/MC vs. MC/MC: <b>men,</b> <b>PR,</b> 0. 66; 95 %CI, 0. 34 - 1. 29; women, PR, 4. 56, 95 %CI, 1. 78 - 11. 69); the prevalence among city inhabitants born in other provinces resembled the pattern seen in inhabitants of their provinces of origin. Traditional forms of tobacco consumption among men were rare in Maputo City, which is in stark contrast to the situation in other provinces. Conclusions Cultural background, affordability, and availability of different types of tobacco in urban Mozambique need to be considered when developing strategies to control the tobacco epidemic. </p...|$|R

Cross-sectional study with data from 25 479 economically active people aged 50 - 64 years resident in 11 European countries who participated in wave 2 or wave 5 of the SHARE project (2006 and 2013). The outcome variables were hazardous drinking, abstention in previous 3 months and the weekly average number of drinks per drinker. The prevalence ratios of hazardous drinking and abstention, comparing the prevalence in 2013 vs. 2006, were estimated with Poisson regression models with robust variance, and {{the changes in the}} number of drinks per week with Poisson regression models. The prevalence of hazardous drinking decreased among both <b>men</b> (<b>PR</b> = 0. 75; 95 %CI = 0. 63 - 0. 92) and women (PR = 0. 91; 95 %CI = 0. 72 - 1. 15), although the latter decrease was smaller and not statistically significant.

40|$|Objetivo: Catalunya y Euskadi recibieron durante el siglo XX importantes contingentes de inmigración del resto de España. El objetivo es analizar las desigualdades en salud según el lugar de nacimiento (población autóctona y nacida en otras comunidades autónomas). Métodos: Estudio {{transversal}} sobre población no institucionalizada de 50 a 79 años de edad, con datos de las encuestas de salud de Catalunya 2006 (n= 5. 483) y de Euskadi 2007 (n= 3. 424). Se utilizaron modelos log-binomiales para calcular las razones de prevalencia (RP) de mala salud percibida según el lugar de nacimiento, estratificadas por sexo y clase social, y ajustadas sucesivamente por edad, clase social y nivel de estudios. Resultados Las personas procedentes de otras comunidades autónomas valoraban peor su salud que las autóctonas, tanto en Euskadi (RP ajustada por edad en hombres de 1, 30, intervalo de confianza del 95 % [IC 95 %] 1, 11 - 1, 54; y en mujeres RP de 1, 42 e IC 95 % de 1, 25 - 1, 62) como en Catalunya (en hombres RP 1, 41 e IC 95 % de 1, 26 - 1, 62; en mujeres RP de 1, 25 e IC 95 % de 1, 16 - 1, 35). Las RP se redujeron, pero permanecieron significativas tras ajustar por clase social y nivel de estudios, y estratificando por clase social manual y no manual. Conclusiones: En ambas comunidades existen desigualdades en salud en detrimento de la población procedente del resto de España, que constituye alrededor de la mitad de la población en las cohortes de edad estudiadas. Futuros estudios deberían explorar la persistencia de estas desigualdades en otros indicadores de salud y su reproducción en las segundas generaciones, así como identificar puntos de entrada para políticas preventivas. Objective: Catalonia and the Basque Country received substantial immigration quotas {{from the}} rest of Spain during the twentieth century. This study aimed to analyze inequalities in health by birthplace (the population born in the same region or other autonomous regions) in these two geographical areas. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study in the non-institutionalized population aged 50 to 79 years, with data from the health surveys of Catalonia 2006 (n= 5, 483) and the Basque Country 2007 (n= 3, 424). We used log-binomial models to estimate the prevalence ratios (PR) of poor self-rated health by birthplace, stratified by sex and social class, and successively adjusted for age, social class and educational attainment. Results: Immigrants from other autonomous regions had poorer self-rated health than the native-born population, both in the Basque Country (age-adjusted <b>PR</b> in <b>men</b> 1. 30, 95 % CI 1. 11 - 1. 54; women 1. 42, 95 % CI 1. 25 - 1. 62,) and in Catalonia (<b>PR</b> in <b>men</b> 1. 41, 95 % CI 1. 26 - 1. 62; PR in women 1. 25, 95 % CI 1. 16 - 1. 35). PRs were reduced but remained significant after adjustment for social class and educational attainment and stratification by manual or non-manual social class. Conclusions: In both communities there are health inequalities that are detrimental to the immigrant population {{from the rest}} of Spain, which constitutes approximately half of the population in the studied age cohorts. Future studies should explore the persistence of these inequalities in other health indicators and their reproduction in second generations, and identify entry points for preventive policies...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{relationship}} between physical workload, sports, and lifestyle factors {{and the development of}} knee osteoarthrosis (OA) in ex-elite athletes, in {{men and women in the}} population, and in physical education (PE) teachers. It is based on four investigations: two cohort studies, one population-based case-referent study, and one field study. In a cohort study of 114 male ex-elite athletes in track-and-field, and 355 referents from the population, the aim was to investigate if musculoskeletal dysfunctions, especially OA in knees and hips were more common. The results show that hip OA was more common among the exelite athletes (PR 3. 6, 95 % CI 1. 4 - 9. 3), and probably also knee OA (PR 2. 8, 95 % CI 0. 7 - 11). The ex-elite athletes estimated their present general health to be better, they were more active in fitness activities, and were less overweight than the referents. A case-referent study of 625 men and women who had had knee prosthesis surgery and referents from the population aimed to investigate risk factors for severe knee OA. The strongest risk factor was overweight (OR men 3. 9, 95 % CI 2. 3 - 6. 4, women 9. 2, 95 % CI 5. 3 - 16. 0). Forestry and construction workers, and female and male farmers had an increased relative risk of severe knee OA compared with the referents. Lifts, jumps, kneeling, squatting, and vibrations significantly increased the odds ratios two or three-fold for men. Those women who had taken care of elderly relatives or handicapped children at home had an increased relative risk of severe knee OA (OR 2. 2, 95 % CI 1. 3 - 3. 6). Sports activities increased the relative risk for men, but sports exposure in women, both cases and referents, was very limited, and no increased risk could therefore be found. Moderate, daily physical activities, such as cycling and walking did not increase the relative risk among men and women. In a cohort study of 571 female and male PE teachers and referents from the population, the aim was to investigate if PE teachers develop more OA in the knees and hips, and other musculoskeletal disorders. The results show that men and women who had been working as PE teachers 10 years or more had a higher prevalence of knee OA compared with the population controls (<b>PR</b> <b>men</b> 2. 8, 95 % CI 1. 6 - 4. 8, women 3. 2, 95 % CI 1. 8 - 5. 5). They also had to change jobs more often due to knee dysfunction. There was an increased prevalence of hip OA for the female PE teachers. The PE teachers reported a better health status, and fewer serious diseases than the population referents. They were also less overweight, had a considerably higher lifelong sports exposure, and smoked less. In a field study, physical load exposure was monitored during entire workdays in thirty female and male PE teachers. The measurements were performed with equipment attached to the body, or systematic registrations. The results indicate that PE teachers have a considerable physical workload on the lower extremities in their everyday work and a high cardiovascular load in comparison with several other occupational groups. In conclusion the studies demonstrate that overweight is the most important risk factor for symptomatic knee OA among men and women, and high physical load in work, home nursing, and high sports exposure are contributing factors...|$|R
