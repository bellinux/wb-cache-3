As a <b>portrait</b> <b>photographer,</b> she was gentle, intuitive and confident. Her life's work is a result of a constant, concentrated effort.|$|E

25|$|The {{building}} {{also contains}} the Carnegie Hall Archives, established in 1986, and the Rose Museum, {{which opened in}} 1991. Until 2009 studios above the Hall contained working spaces for artists in the performing and graphic arts including music, drama, dance, as well as architects, playwrights, literary agents, photographers and painters. The spaces were unusual in being purpose-designed for artistic work, with very high ceilings, skylights and large windows for natural light. In 2007 the Carnegie Hall Corporation announced plans to evict the 33 remaining studio residents, {{some of whom had}} been in the building since the 1950s, including celebrity <b>portrait</b> <b>photographer</b> Editta Sherman and fashion photographer Bill Cunningham.

25|$|The {{tradition}} of dressing up in character {{continued into the}} following centuries. One of the photographic series by Julia Margaret Cameron, a pupil of the painter George Frederic Watts, was of mythical characters, for whom she used the children of friends and servants as models. Young Kate Keown sat for the head of “Circe” in about 1865 and is pictured wearing a grape and vineleaf headdress to suggest the character’s use of wine to bring a change in personality. The society <b>portrait</b> <b>photographer</b> Yevonde Middleton, also known as Madame Yevonde, was to use a 1935 aristocratic charity ball {{as the foundation for}} her own series of mythological portraits in colour. Its participants were invited to her studio afterwards to pose in their costumes. There Baroness Dacre is pictured as Circe with a leafy headdress about golden ringlets and clasping a large Baroque porcelain goblet.|$|E
500|$|The {{subject of}} {{soldiers}} earning the VC has been popular with artists since the medal's inception.

Later the collection was broken up and many of the paintings were sent to the various regiments depicted. Some were damaged or destroyed. [...] A number of the acts were also portrayed in a Second World War propaganda pamphlet, and the images commissioned by the Ministry of Information are presented in an online gallery available on the website of The National Archives.

The design of the photographer was based on American <b>portrait</b> <b>photographer</b> Annie Leibovitz. The song that plays during the photographing scenes is [...] "I'm Too Sexy" [...] by English pop trio Right Said Fred. During {{the rules and regulations}} announcement, Comic Book Guy declares that sexual intercourse will only be permitted once every seven years in Springfield. This is a reference to pon farr, a term used in the Star Trek franchise to describe the psychophysical effect of the estrous cycle that affects the fictional race Vulcans every seven years. His taunting of [...] "I am smart, much smarter than you, Hib-bert!" [...] is also to the tune of the Star Trek fanfare.
