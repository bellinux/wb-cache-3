5|$|A {{mandatory}} order is {{an order of}} the High Court commanding a public authority to perform a public duty, while a prohibiting order operates to prevent illegal action by an authority from occurring in the first place. A quashing order, the most commonly sought prerogative order, {{has the effect of}} invalidating an ultra vires decision made by an authority. Obtaining a mandatory, prohibiting or quashing order is a two-stage <b>process,</b> <b>as</b> an applicant must be granted leave by the Court to apply for the order. The Court must find the existence of a proper public law issue and available grounds of review. Leave will be granted provided that an arguable and prima facie case of reasonable suspicion that the authority has acted in breach of administrative law rules is established.|$|E

5|$|At Hanford, {{plutonium}} production {{fell off}} as Reactors B, D and F wore out, poisoned by fission products and {{swelling of the}} graphite moderator known as the Wigner effect. The swelling damaged the charging tubes where the uranium was irradiated to produce plutonium, rendering them unusable. In {{order to maintain the}} supply of polonium for the urchin initiators, production was curtailed and the oldest unit, B pile, was closed down so at least one reactor would be available in the future. Research continued, with DuPont and the Metallurgical Laboratory developing a redox solvent extraction <b>process</b> <b>as</b> an alternative plutonium extraction technique to the bismuth phosphate process, which left unspent uranium in a state from which it could not easily be recovered.|$|E
5|$|Benny Chan {{described}} the filming <b>process</b> <b>as</b> {{some of the}} darkest days of his career, explaining that the baby was a factor beyond his control, and could not work more than eight hours a day. Whenever a scene involving the baby was shot, the crew members had to be silent, communicating in sign language. Benny Chan stated it took time, patience, and money to guide the baby through each shot, and numerous retakes were required due to the baby's constant crying and napping. As a result, production went over budget. Special methods were sometimes used to coax the baby into co-operation. One scene required the baby to suckle Chan's nipple. The baby was initially hesitant, but relented after the crew brushed {{a large amount of}} honey onto the nipple.|$|E

40|$|Metaphors can be <b>processed</b> <b>as</b> {{comparisons}} or categorizations (Gibbs 2 ̆ 6 Colston, 2012). The {{quality of}} metaphor hypothesis suggests that inapt metaphors are <b>processed</b> <b>as</b> comparisons and apt metaphors are processed categorizations (Glucksberg 2 ̆ 6 Haught, 2006). In two experiments, novel metaphors were manipulated on semantic neighbourhood density (SND) and topic concreteness and presented to participants at two reading deadlines that {{are believed to}} characterize symmetric (e. g. comparison) and directional (e. g. categorization) processing stages (e. g., Wolff 2 ̆ 6 Gentner, 2011). Participants rated the comprehensibility of metaphors. The results suggest that low SND metaphors are <b>processed</b> <b>as</b> categorizations whereas high SND metaphors are <b>processed</b> <b>as</b> comparisons. In the case of metaphors made up of high SND, an abstract topic is more favourable for categorization than a concrete topic.
