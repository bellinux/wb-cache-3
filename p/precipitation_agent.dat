There are various <b>precipitation</b> <b>agents</b> {{that can be used}} to remove metals from solution, these being hydroxide, carbonates or sulphides. Sulphide precipitation has been gaining increased attention because of the advantages it holds above the other methods.

The problem with this, and coupled to the high reactivity of the sulphide ion, is the creation of high local supersaturation. The supersaturation governs all precipitation and crystallisation processes in the way that it features in nucleation and growth rates. In crystallisation processes, the supersaturation can easily be controlled by thermal methods of evaporation or cooling.
