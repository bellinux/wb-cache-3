40|$|In my thesis, in the {{theoretical}} part I deal with atrial fibrillation. I also deal with management of atrial fibrillation treatment. In the paper I explain {{the basic principles}} of <b>pharmaco-economic</b> <b>evaluation</b> in the Czech Republic, on the basis of which laws these pharmacological interventions are evaluated and who are in the Czech Republic. In the work I present cost breakdown and what are the most commonly used pharmaco-economic analyzes. In the practical part I will apply {{the theoretical}} knowledge. I have developed cost utility analysis based on available clinical evidence - randomized clinical trials ARISTOTLE (Granger, 2011), RE-LY (Connolly, 2009), ROCKET AF (Patel, 2011). I made an indirect comparison of the total benefits of NOACs. In the baseline scenario, I have calculated QALY to evaluate the benefits of effectiveness, safety and reduction of mortality. I have also dealt with a bleeding-related scenario. The ICER's greatest contribution to the public healthcare system has shown the active substance apixaban in both scenarios.

40|$|To optimally develop or adjust {{national}} {{contingency plans}} {{to respond to}} the next influenza pandemic, we developed a decision type model and estimated the total health burden and direct medical costs during the next possible influenza pandemic in the Netherlands on the basis of health care burden during a regular epidemic. Using an arithmetic decision tree-type model we took into account population characteristics, varying influenza attack rates, health care consumption according to the Dutch health care model and all-cause mortality. Actual direct medical cost estimates were based on the Dutch guidelines for <b>pharmaco-economic</b> <b>evaluation.</b> In the base-case scenario with no preventive measure available and an average influenza attack rate of 30 %, 4, 958, 188 influenza infections, 1, 552, 687 GP consultations, 83, 515 hospitalizations and 173, 396 deaths will take place in The Netherlands.

Several efforts have been done by the government, however access people to the medicines is still a big issue. To improve the affordability of medicines for public, the policy related to the medicines prices need to be revised. In addition, the appropriate of this policy {{would lead to the}} efficient of medicines expenditure.

40|$|Objective: Health-related {{quality of}} life (HRQoL) in {{patients}} with systemic sclerosis (SSc), a chronic disabling disease associated to physical and psychological impairment, is often left behind in clinical practice and research. This {{is due to the}} use of tools that are not complete or mainly designed for the physical condition only. We tested EQ- 5 D, a valid, simple and brief questionnaire for HRQoL that has never been validated in SSc. Methods: 33 consecutive SSc patients referring to our Rheumatology Department and undergoing treatment have been asked to fulfil EQ- 5 D together with HAQ. Results: EQ- 5 D demonstrated good acceptability, feasibility and validity in patients affected by SSc. Conceptually equivalent domains of EQ- 5 D demonstrated a good correlation with HAQ correspondent domains. Conclusions: We suggest the use of EQ- 5 D in SSc patients as a HRQoL measure in clinical practice, as well as an outcome parameter in randomized clinical trials and/or in <b>pharmaco-economic</b> <b>evaluations...</b>|$|R
40|$|Background and Objectives Pharmaco-economics {{provides}} a standardized methodology for valid comparisons of interventions in different fields of health care. The role of pharmaco-economics {{in the safety}} of blood and blood products has, however, been very limited to date. This review discusses the <b>pharmaco-economic</b> <b>evaluations</b> of strategies to enhance blood product safety that have been published in the scientific literature. Materials and Methods We reviewed pharmaco-economic methodology with special reference to cost-effectiveness analysis. We searched the literature for cost-effectiveness in blood product safety. Results Net costs per quality adjusted life-year (QALY) gained varied from cost-saving for human immunodefiency virus (HIV) - and hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibody screening and leucoreduction to several million $US per QALY gained for solvent-detergent treatment of plasma, nucleic acid amplification testing and HIV p 24 antigen testing. Conclusions To date the safety of blood transfusion has been largely determined by available technology, irrespective of pharmaco-economics. Net costs up to several million $US per QALY gained were found for interventions implemented...|$|R
40|$|Background: Generic {{drugs are}} used by {{millions}} of patients for economic reasons, so their evaluation must be highly transparent. Objective: To assess the quality of reporting of bioequivalence trials comparing generic to brand-name drugs. Methodology/Principal Findings: PubMed was searched for reports of bioequivalence trials comparing generic to brandname drugs between January 2005 and December 2008. Articles were included if {{the aim of the}} study was to assess the bioequivalency of generic and brand-name drugs. We excluded case studies, <b>pharmaco-economic</b> <b>evaluations,</b> and validation dosage assays of drugs. We evaluated whether important information about funding, methodology, location of trials, and participants were reported. We also assessed whether the criteria required by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicine Agency (EMA) to conclude bioequivalence were reported and that the conclusions were in agreement with the results. We identified 134 potentially relevant articles but eliminated 55 because the brand-name or generic drug status of the reference drug was unknown. Thus, we evaluated 79 articles. The funding source and location of the trial were reported in 41 % and 56 % of articles, respectively. The type of statistical analysis was reported in 94 % of articles, but the methods to generate the randomization sequence and to conceal allocation were reported in only 15 % and 5 %, respectively. In total, 65 articles of single-dose trials (89 %) concluded bioequivalence. Of these, 20 (31 %) did not report the 3 criteria withi...|$|R
40|$|Precision {{medicine}} {{is a medical}} model aiming to deliver customised healthcare - with medical decisions, practices, and/or products tailored to the individual patient informed but not directed by guidelines. Allergen immunotherapy has unique immunological rationale, since the approach is tailored to the specific IgE spectrum of an individual and modifies the natural course of the disease as it has a persistent efficacy after completion of treatment. In this perspective Allergen Immunotherapy - AIT has to be presently considered a prototype of Precision Medicine. Precise information and biomarkers provided by systems medicine and network medicine will address the discovery of Allergen immunotherapy biomarkers for (i) identification of the causes, (ii) stratification of eligible patients for AIT and (iii) the assessment of AIT efficacy. This area of medical technology is evolving rapidly and, compelemented by e-health, will {{change the way we}} practice medicine. It will help to monitor patients' disease control and data for (i) patient stratification, (ii) clinical trials, (iii) monitoring the efficacy and safety of targeted therapies which are critical for reaching an appropriate reimbursement. Biomarkers associated with e-health combined with a clinical decision support system (CDSS) will change the scope of Allergen immunotherapy. The cost/effectiveness of Allergen immunotherapy is a key issue for successful implementation. It should include the long-term benefits in the <b>pharmaco-economic</b> <b>evaluation,</b> since no other allergy treatment has this specific characteristic.

40|$|Background: Recent {{evidence}} {{demonstrates that}} rotavirus vaccination {{is the best}} strategy for reducing rotavirus gastro-enteritis (RVGE) in young children. Aims: This study describes the epidemiology of RVGE hospitalisation of Sicilian children before universal rotavirus vaccination was introduced into the regional immunisation programme in January 2013. Methods: An observational study was undertaken by analyzing data obtained from the Regional Hospital Discharge database, including hospitalisation from 2003 to 2012 of subjects aged 0 - 59 months who lived in Sicily. Children discharged with the rotavirus-specific ICD- 9 -CM code of 008 · 61 on first or any diagnosis stage {{were considered to be}} RVGE cases. Results: From 2003 to 2012, 9317 children (median age 19 months, M/F ratio 1 · 19) were hospitalised with a diagnosis of RVGE. During the study period, annual rates of hospitalisation were between 2 · 64 and 4 · 68 cases/ 1000 children (mean 3 · 74 cases). Incidence rates were higher in children aged 6 - 11 months (8 · 85 / 1, 000 children/year), decreasing significantly with age (P< 0 · 001). RVGE hospitalisation peaked during winter and spring with a statistically significant downward trend throughout summer and autumn. Conclusion: During the study period, the cumulative risk of hospitalisation with RVGE was determined to be about one in 54 Sicilian children in the 1 st 5 years of life. Although the present study cannot be considered a proper <b>pharmaco-economic</b> <b>evaluation,</b> the findings suggest that in Sicily the health and economic burden of RVGE hospitalisation strongly supports the introduction of rotavirus vaccination into the regional immunisation programme as a probably cost-saving intervention...|$|E
40|$|The {{cost-effectiveness}} of enzyme {{replacement therapy}} (ERT) compared to standard medical care was evaluated in the Dutch cohort {{of patients with}} Fabry disease. Cost-effectiveness analysis was performed using a life-time state-transition model. Transition probabilities, effectiveness data and costs were derived from retrospective data and prospective follow-up of the Dutch study cohort consisting {{of males and females}} aged 5 - 78 years. Intervention with ERT (either agalsidase alfa or agalsidase beta) was compared to the standard medical care. The main outcome measures were years without end organ damage (renal, cardiac en cerebrovascular complications), quality adjusted life years (QALYs), and costs. Over a 70 year lifetime, an untreated Fabry patient will generate 55. 0 years free of end-organ damage (53. 5 years in males, 56. 9 years in females) and 48. 6 QALYs (47. 8 in males, 49. 7 in females). Starting ERT in a symptomatic patient increases the number of years free of end-organ damage by 1. 5 year (1. 6 in males, 1. 3 in females), while the number of QALYs gained increases by a similar amount (1. 7 in males, 1. 4 in females). The costs of ERT starting in the symptomatic stage are between € 9 - € 10 million (£ 7. 9 - £ 8. 8 million, $ 13. 0 - $ 14. 5 million) during a patient's lifetime. Consequently, the extra costs per additional year free of end-organ damage and the extra costs per additional QALY range from € 5. 5 - € 7. 5 million (£ 4. 8 - £ 6. 6 million, $ 8. 0 - $ 10. 8 million), undiscounted. In symptomatic patients with Fabry disease, ERT has limited effect on quality of life and progression to end organ damage. The <b>pharmaco-economic</b> <b>evaluation</b> shows that this modest effectiveness drives the costs per QALY and the costs per year free of end-organ damage to millions of euros. Differentiation of patients who may benefit from ERT should be improved to enhance cost-effectivenes...|$|E
40|$|This study compares two {{cytotoxic}} regimens {{comprising the}} same dose and schedule of cisplatin (CP) plus vinorelbine (VNR) or gemcitabine (GEM) administered {{under the same}} schedule to patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC). From April 1998 to February 2003, 285 patients were randomised to receive either VNR 25 mg/m 2 on days 1 and 8 as an intravenous (i. v.) bolus plus CP 75 mg/m 2 on day 1 (regimen A) or GEM 1200 mg/m 2 on days 1 and 8 as an i. v. 30 -min infusion plus CP 75 mg/m 2 on day 1 (regimen B). Both treatments were recycled every 21 days. If no progression had occurred after six cycles, the patients continued to receive VNR or GEM monochemotherapy weekly. Cross-over of the two single agents was considered if disease progression occurred. Objective response (OR), time to progression (TTP) and overall survival (OS) were analysed according to the intention-to-treat principle. 272 patients were ultimately eligible (137 on A and 135 on B). Their main characteristics were: male/female ratio 214 / 58; median age 63 (range 32 – 77) years; median Karnofsky Performance Status (PS) 80 (range 70 – 100); stage IIIB 34 %, stage IV 61 %, recurrent disease 5 %; histology – epidermoid 29 %, adenocarcinoma 53 %, other NSCLC 18 %. The characteristics of the patients in the two arms were well matched. The following response rates were observed in regimens A and B, respectively: complete response (CR) 0. 7 % and 3. 7 %, partial response (PR) 31. 9 % and 22. 2 % (P = 0. 321). Median CR + PR duration was 8 months in both arms. Clinical benefit represented by an improvement in symptoms was evident in 25. 7 % and 28. 1 %, respectively. Median TTP was 5 months in both arms and median OS 11 months in both arms. Grade III–IV neutropenia occurred in 30. 7 % and 17. 7 % of the patients in arms A and B, respectively (P = 0. 017); thrombocytopenia occurred in 0 % and 9. 3 % (P = 0. 004), respectively. No difference {{in the incidence of}} anaemia was observed. Non-haematological toxicity was generally mild: a higher incidence of grade 1 – 2 peripheral neurotoxicity and grade 1 – 2 local toxicity with regimen A and grade 1 – 2 liver toxicity with regimen B was reported. A pharmacoeconomic comparison showed a difference between the two doublets, principally due to the different costs of VNR and GEM. Under the study conditions the combination of VNR or GEM with the same dose and schedule of CP produced similar OR, clinical benefits, TTP and OS in advanced NSCLC, and only mild toxicological differences were observed. <b>Pharmaco-economic</b> <b>evaluation</b> favoured the CP + VNR double...|$|E
40|$|Diagnostic {{accuracy}} studies {{alone are}} not sufficient; the test's impact on patient outcome {{ought to be}} performed. Before introducing a test in clinical practice, its societal impact should be assessed as well. The cost-effectiveness of diagnostic tests is often assessed by means of economic models. Modelling is particularly well suited for diagnostic tests because of the complexity and the uncertainty of many clinical decisions. Its major strength lies on an explicit and systematic approach to decision making. But the results of such an analysis are also largely dependent on the assumptions underlying the model and on the inclusion of all relevant costs and outcomes. This search for valid input parameters has been pursued in the current thesis. Implicit in economic analysis {{is the concept of}} assigning some monetary cost to the considered intervention. Accurate data on resource cost of 18 F-FDG-PET are often scarce and contradictory. One possible way to calculate reliable cost data is Activity-Based Costing (ABC), a cost calculation method that allocates resource costs to products based on activity consumption. ABC goes beyond being just a more accurate accounting system. This approach can be used for operational decision making to improve the departmental workflow as well as to understand the financial impact of changes in consumption patterns or of the acquisition of new equipment (cost management), like acquiring a new hybrid scanner or establishing a PET-CT facility. In the first chapter of the thesis, we will conduct two comprehensive descriptive cost analyses based on the ABC methodology of an 18 F-FDG-PET study and of the commercial production of 18 F-FDG patient dose. The determination of accurate costs estimates will better identify the critical cost components and evaluate the impact in changes in cost patterns. The quality of a <b>pharmaco-economic</b> <b>evaluation</b> crucially depends on the value of the data based on the best available up-to-date evidence on the intervention and its comparator. As in other branches of science and medical care, the majority of PET review articles are narrative rather than systematic. The key difference between them is, for the latter, the explicit and systematic searching methodology and the critical appraisal of the studies. One of the goals of the thesis is to illustrate the advantage of a systematic review. We therefore designed, in the second chapter, a systematic review of 18 F-FDG-PET in the staging Cutaneous Malignant Melanoma work-up. Patients with metastatic melanoma have traditionally been managed with various systemic treatments; however, overall survival with this approach has been disappointing. Conventional teaching has been that resection was not indicated when the cancer is disseminated. Several series have however reported long-term survival after resection of distant metastases. In the absence of more active agents, surgery should be therefore reconsidered in the treatment paradigm at least for some highly selected patients. Recently, Petersen et al published a large prospective study on the management of patients with suspected pulmonary metastasized melanoma, showing that complete metastasectomy is the only factor affecting the overall survival. Improved survival is dependent on careful patient selection. Even if most guidelines consider 18 F-FDG-PET-CT to detect occult extra-pulmonary disease prior to lung metastasectomy, the societal impact has never been assessed. In the third chapter we investigate, by means of a Markov model, the cost-effectiveness of 18 F-FDG-PET for the surgical management of pulmonary metastases from Cutaneous Malignant Melanoma.
