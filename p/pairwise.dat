5|$|Another common {{progressive}} alignment method called T-Coffee is {{slower than}} Clustal and its derivatives but generally produces more accurate alignments for distantly related sequence sets. T-Coffee calculates <b>pairwise</b> alignments {{by combining the}} direct alignment of the pair with indirect alignments that aligns each sequence of the pair to a third sequence. It uses the output from Clustal as well as another local alignment program LALIGN, which finds multiple regions of local alignment between two sequences. The resulting alignment and phylogenetic tree are used {{as a guide to}} produce new and more accurate weighting factors.|$|E
5|$|Multiple {{sequence}} alignment also {{refers to}} the process of aligning such a sequence set. Because three or more sequences of biologically relevant length can be difficult and are almost always time-consuming to align by hand, computational algorithms are used to produce and analyze the alignments. MSAs require more sophisticated methodologies than <b>pairwise</b> alignment because they are more computationally complex. Most multiple sequence alignment programs use heuristic methods rather than global optimization because identifying the optimal alignment between more than a few sequences of moderate length is prohibitively computationally expensive.|$|E
5|$|SAM {{has been}} used as a source of {{alignments}} for protein structure prediction to participate in the CASP structure prediction experiment and to develop a database of predicted proteins in the yeast species S. cerevisiae. HHsearch is a software package for the detection of remotely related protein sequences based on the <b>pairwise</b> comparison of HMMs. A server running HHsearch (HHpred) was by far the fastest of the 10 best automatic structure prediction servers in the CASP7 and CASP8 structure prediction competitions.|$|E
5|$|The all-pairs widest path {{problem has}} {{applications}} in the Schulze method for choosing a winner in multiway elections in which voters rank the candidates in preference order. The Schulze method constructs a complete directed graph in which the vertices represent the candidates and every two vertices are connected by an edge. Each edge is directed from the winner to the loser of a <b>pairwise</b> contest between the two candidates it connects, and is labeled with the margin of victory of that contest. Then the method computes widest paths between all pairs of vertices, {{and the winner is}} the candidate whose vertex has wider paths to each opponent than vice versa. The results of an election using this method are consistent with the Condorcet method – a candidate who wins all <b>pairwise</b> contests automatically wins the whole election – but it generally allows a winner to be selected, even in situations where the Concorcet method itself fails. The Schulze method has been used by several organizations including the Wikimedia Foundation.|$|E
5|$|Each {{party in}} a coevolutionary {{relationship}} exerts selective pressures on the other, thereby affecting each other's evolution. Coevolution includes many forms of mutualism, host-parasite, and predator-prey relationships between species, as well as competition within or between species. In many cases, the selective pressures drive an evolutionary arms race between the species involved. <b>Pairwise</b> or specific coevolution, between exactly two species, {{is not the only}} possibility; in guild or diffuse coevolution, several species may evolve a trait in reciprocity with a trait in another species, as has happened between the flowering plants and pollinating insects such as bees, flies, and beetles.|$|E
25|$|A set of vectors in {{an inner}} product space is called <b>pairwise</b> {{orthogonal}} if each pairing {{of them is}} orthogonal. Such a set is called an orthogonal set. Nonzero <b>pairwise</b> orthogonal vectors are always linearly independent.|$|E

25|$|Note, {{that the}} isotypes of not {{equivalent}} irreducible representations are <b>pairwise</b> orthogonal.|$|E
25|$|Make {{the results}} table, such as used above in the Example {{and called the}} 'matrix of <b>pairwise</b> preferences'. If using margins rather than raw vote totals, {{subtract}} it from its transpose. Then every positive number is a <b>pairwise</b> win for the candidate on that row (and marked green), ties are 0, and losses are negative (marked red). Order the candidates by how long they last in elimination.|$|E

25|$|The {{assumption}} of independence can be weakened to <b>pairwise</b> independence, {{but in that}} case the proof is more difficult.|$|E
25|$|The {{two samples}} to be {{compared}} (<b>pairwise</b> comparison) are grown/acquired. In this example treated sample (case) and untreated sample (control).|$|E
25|$|When two {{straight}} lines intersect at a point, four angles are formed. <b>Pairwise</b> these angles are named {{according to their}} location relative to each other.|$|E
25|$|In this basis, {{it becomes}} clear that the split-complex numbers are ring-isomorphic to the direct sum R ⊕ R with {{addition}} and multiplication defined <b>pairwise.</b>|$|E
25|$|Given a graph G = (V,E), a {{matching}} M in G {{is a set}} of <b>pairwise</b> non-adjacent edges; that is, no two edges share a common vertex.|$|E
25|$|For a {{group of}} twins, <b>pairwise</b> {{concordance}} is defined as C/(C+D), where C {{is the number of}} concordant pairs and D is the number of discordant pairs.|$|E
25|$|When {{it comes}} to the exact <b>pairwise</b> {{collision}} detection, this is highly trajectory dependent, and one almost has to use a numerical root-finding algorithm to compute the instant of impact.|$|E
25|$|Given any set X of <b>pairwise</b> {{disjoint}} non-empty sets, {{there exists}} {{at least one}} set C that contains exactly one element in common {{with each of the}} sets in X.|$|E
25|$|Pruning is also {{desirable}} here, both n-body pruning and <b>pairwise</b> pruning, but the algorithms {{must take}} time {{and the types of}} motions used in the underlying physical system into consideration.|$|E
25|$|For every degree a {{there is}} a degree {{strictly}} between a and aprime&. In fact, {{there is a}} countable sequence of <b>pairwise</b> incomparable degrees between a and aprime&.|$|E
25|$|The {{cells for}} d have a light green {{background}} if d > d, otherwise {{the background is}} light red. There is no undisputed winner by only looking at the <b>pairwise</b> differences here.|$|E
25|$|Generally, {{sequence}} alignment means {{constructing a}} string from {{two or more}} given strings with the greatest similarity by adding, deleting letters, or adding a space for each string. The multiple sequence alignment problem is generally based on <b>pairwise</b> sequence alignment and currently, for <b>pairwise</b> sequence alignment problem, biologists can use dynamic programming approach to obtain its optimal solution. However, the multiple sequence alignment problem {{is still one of}} the intractable problems in bioinformatics, because finding the optimal solution of multiple sequence alignment has been proved as a NP-complete problem so that only approximate optimal solution can be obtained.|$|E
25|$|Gauss's presumed {{method was}} {{to realize that}} <b>pairwise</b> {{addition}} of terms from {{opposite ends of the}} list yielded identical intermediate sums: 1+100=101, 2+99=101, 3+98=101, and so on, for a total sum of 50×101=5050.|$|E
25|$|Differential {{simulations}} {{with large}} numbers of objects perform the calculations in a hierarchical <b>pairwise</b> fashion between centers of mass. Using this scheme, galaxies, star clusters and other large assemblages of objects have been simulated.|$|E
25|$|The network {{construction}} is highly robust results {{with respect to}} different choices of the soft threshold. In contrast, results based on unweighted networks, constructed by thresholding a <b>pairwise</b> association measure, often strongly depend on the threshold.|$|E
25|$|Statistical {{potentials}} are empirical methods {{based on}} observed residue-residue contact frequencies among proteins of known {{structure in the}} PDB. They assign a probability or energy score to each possible <b>pairwise</b> interaction between amino acids and combine these <b>pairwise</b> interaction scores into a single score for the entire model. Some such methods can also produce a residue-by-residue assessment that identifies poorly scoring regions within the model, though the model may have a reasonable score overall. These methods emphasize the hydrophobic core and solvent-exposed polar amino acids often present in globular proteins. Examples of popular statistical potentials include Prosa and DOPE. Statistical potentials are more computationally efficient than energy calculations.|$|E
25|$|Entire arrays {{may have}} obvious flaws {{detectable}} by visual inspection, <b>pairwise</b> comparisons to arrays {{in the same}} experimental group, or by analysis of RNA degradation. Results may improve by removing these arrays from the analysis entirely.|$|E
25|$|Weighted {{correlation}} {{network analysis}} (WGCNA) involves weighted networks defined by soft-thresholding the <b>pairwise</b> correlations among variables (e.g. measures of transcript abundance). WGCNA {{can be applied}} to compute eigengenes, which are highly robust biomarkers (features) useful for diagnosis and prognosis.|$|E
25|$|In {{the case}} of {{deformable}} bodies such as cloth simulation, {{it may not be}} possible to use a more specific <b>pairwise</b> pruning algorithm as discussed below, and an n-body pruning algorithm is the best that can be done.|$|E
25|$|X is a Hausdorff space if all {{distinct}} {{points in}} X are <b>pairwise</b> neighborhood-separable. This condition {{is the third}} separation axiom (after T0 and T1), which is why Hausdorff spaces are also called T2 spaces. The name separated space is also used.|$|E
25|$|The Schulze {{method is}} a Condorcet method, {{which means the}} following: {{if there is a}} {{candidate}} who is preferred by a majority over every other candidate in <b>pairwise</b> comparisons, then this candidate will be the winner when the Schulze method is applied.|$|E
25|$|This energy {{function}} only introduces probability biases {{for a spin}} having a value and {{for a pair of}} spins having the same value. Higher order correlations are unconstrained by the multipliers. An activity pattern sampled from this distribution requires the largest number of bits to store in a computer, in the most efficient coding scheme imaginable, as compared with any other distribution with the same average activity and <b>pairwise</b> correlations. This means that Ising models are relevant to any system which is described by bits which are as random as possible, with constraints on the <b>pairwise</b> correlations and the average number of 1s, which frequently occurs in both the physical and social sciences.|$|E
25|$|One {{way is to}} {{have enough}} {{switching}} fabric {{to assure that the}} <b>pairwise</b> allocation will always succeed by building a fully connected mesh network. This is the method usually used in central office switches, which have low utilization of their resources.|$|E
25|$|For example, a {{group of}} 10 twins have been pre-selected to have one {{affected}} member (of the pair). During {{the course of the}} study four other previously non-affected members become affected, giving a <b>pairwise</b> concordance of 4/(4+6) or 4/10 or 40%.|$|E
25|$|Celera used a {{technique}} called whole genome shotgun sequencing, employing <b>pairwise</b> end sequencing, which {{had been used to}} sequence bacterial genomes of up to six million base pairs in length, but not for anything nearly as large as the three billion base pair human genome.|$|E
25|$|The {{classical}} core of {{the subject}} of combinatorial designs is built around balanced incomplete block designs (BIBDs), Hadamard matrices and Hadamard designs, symmetric BIBDs, Latin squares, resolvable BIBDs, difference sets, and <b>pairwise</b> balanced designs (PBDs). Other combinatorial designs are related to or have been developed {{from the study of}} these fundamental ones.|$|E
