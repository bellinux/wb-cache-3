Philip Hooker, a local carpenter's son who had been establishing himself as an architect in the Albany area, was commissioned to design it. It took several years to get construction going on Hooker's first major work, delayed by <b>punch</b> <b>list</b> items like changing the roof cladding from shingles to in and altering the cupola design.

5000|$|In most contracts, the General Conditions to the Contract for Construction {{requires}} the Contractor, when {{he believes it}} to be so, to declare the construction project to have reached [...] "substantial completion" [...] and request a [...] "pre-final" [...] inspection. According to the General Conditions (AIA A201 Section 9.8.2), the Contractor prepares and submits to the Architect a comprehensive list of items to be completed or corrected. This snag list, generated by the Contractor {{is known as the}} <b>punch</b> <b>list.</b> Upon receipt of the Contractor's list, the Architect then inspects the work to determine if the Work is [...] "substantially complete." [...] Final contractor payment is made when the <b>punch</b> <b>list</b> of items are completed to meet the project design required by the contract, or some other mutually agreed resolution for each item is reached. Examples of <b>punch</b> <b>list</b> items include damaged building components (e.g. repair broken window, replace stained wallboard, repair cracked paving, etc.), or problems with the final installation of building materials or equipment (e.g. reinstall peeling carpet, replace missing roof shingles, fire and pressure test boiler, obtain elevator use permit, activate security system, etc.).|$|E

40|$|According to Total Quality Management (TQM), Lean Production and Six Sigma literature, {{companies}} should develop organisational arrangements that foster learning from experience and base decisions on facts, since continuous improvements require continuous experience feedback in some form. In Sweden every construction project is checked in several inspections, and data about defects are collected in paper-based “punch lists”, {{but what happens}} to these data after the defects have been corrected and the building is delivered to the client? This study describes the current inspection regime {{in terms of the}} scope it provides for collecting experience feedback in the Swedish construction industry, and evaluates the extent to which Swedish construction companies recognise this scope. Empirically, it is based on a survey of the views of field superintendents in medium-sized to large building/construction contractors regarding the use of inspection data as a source of experience feedback in their respective companies. The results show that contractors are generally aware that inspection data can provide valuable information for experience feedback and constant improvements, but currently they do not have systems or processes for feeding back experience from inspections. The possibility of replacing paper-based <b>punch</b> <b>lists</b> with a digital system to process and access inspection data is discussed, which it is proposed could provide a means for improving organisational experience feedback-based learning among construction contractors.

40|$|The {{expression}} Lessons Learned {{has been}} an important concept in NASA and aerospace industries for many years. It was conceived as a tool to perpetuate experience and keep from repeating costly mistakes. If this is to be done, the lessons must not only be learned- they must be remembered. Experience has shown that as management systems and key people change the lessons are forgotten. The crucial messages generated from the review of the Challenger accident must not be lost. We must keep them alive and readily retrievable to: Help engineers build safety into their basic designs. Provide check lists for trade studies and for development testing. Help structure verification and validation plans and procedures. Focus attention on high risk areas in management systems. Provide <b>punch</b> <b>lists</b> for real-time risk assessment to be used in consideration of deviations and waivers. Identify and develop detailed remedial actions to correct weaknesses in management evidenced by mistakes, failures, accidents, mishaps and safety problems. Assist in prioritizing management attention in areas particularly vulnerable to critical oversights and human errors. Help evaluate safety risk conditions. If all of these objectives are to be accomplished effectively, the lessons learned information must be entered in computer files with insight into its many eventual uses, and once retrieved, it must be recast to fit the specific application at hand. This task is not easy, but it is possible with skilled and dedicated people. The uses of these materials are limited only by the creativity and determination of the lessons learned practitioner. The payoff- to keep from repeating costly mistakes- is worth the effort...|$|R

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The history of crude oil desalting/dehydration plant (DDP) has been marked in progressive phases-the simple gravity settling phase, the chemical treatment phase, the electrical enhancement phase and the dilution water phase. In recent times, the proper cachet would be the control-optimisation phase marked by terms such as "DDP process control", "desalter optimisation control" or "DDP automating technology". Another less perceptible aspect, but nonetheless important, has been both a <b>punch</b> <b>listing</b> of traditional plant boundaries and a grouping of factors that play the essential roles in a desalting/dehydration plant (DDP). Nowadays, modelling and optimising of a DDP performance has become more apparent in petroleum and chemical engineering, which has been traditionally concerned with production and refinery processing industries. Today's desalting/dehydration technology finds itself as {{an important factor in}} such diverse areas as petroleum engineering, environmental concerns, and advanced technology materials. The movement into these areas has created a need not only for sources useful for professionals but also for gathering relevant information essential in improving product quality and its impact on health, safety and environmental (HSE) aspects. All of the foregoing, clearly establishes the need for a comprehensive knowledge of DDP and emulsion theories, process modelling and optimisation techniques. The main objective of this work is to model and qualitatively optimise a desalting/dehydration plant. In due course, the contents of this thesis will cover in depth both the basic areas of emulsion treatment fundamentals, modelling desalting/dehydration processes and optimising the performance of desalting plants. In addition, emphasis is also placed on more advanced topics such as optimisation technology and process modifications. At the results and recommendation stage, the theme of this work-optimising desalting/dehydration plant will practically be furnished in an applicable scheme. Finally, a significant compendium of figures and experimental data are presented. This thesis, therefore, essentially presents the research and important principles of desalting/dehydration systems. It also gives the oil industry a wide breadth of important information presented in a concise and focused manner. In search of data quality and product on-line-improvement, this combination will be a powerful tool for operators and professionals in a decision support environment...|$|R

50|$|About 1863 the Arts Club in Hanover Square was started, with Keene {{as one of}} the {{original}} members. In 1864 John Leech died, and Keene's work in Punch thenceforward found wider opportunities. It was about this time that the greatest of all modern artists of his class, Menzel, discovered Keene's existence, and became a subscriber to Punch solely for the sake of enjoying week by week the work of his brother craftsman. In 1872, Keene, who, though fully possessed of the humorous sense, was not within measurable distance of Leech as a jester, and whose drawings were consequently not sufficiently funny to appeal to the laughter-loving public, was fortunate enough to make the acquaintance of Joseph Crawhall, {{who had been in the}} habit for many years of jotting down any humorous incidents he might hear of or observe, illustrating them at leisure for his own amusement. These were placed unreservedly at Keene's disposal, and to their inspiration we owe at least 250 of his most successful drawings in the last twenty years of his connection with <b>Punch.</b> A <b>list</b> of more than 200 of these subjects is given at the end of The Life and Letters of Charles Keene.|$|R
