The results are compared to the exposure and capital reserves obtained under the method recommended by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS).

40|$|CONCLUSION The {{analysis}} of the exposure measurement problem {{has shown that the}} proper measurement of counterparty exposure for <b>portfolios</b> <b>of</b> derivatives <b>transactions</b> is a complex task that cannot be performed without making a lot of simplifying assumptions. Because of the complicated interaction of correlation effects and offsettings from different transactions, the single transaction framework which is currently used by most banks is definitely not capable of accurately determining the portfolio credit risk. When simulation techniques are applied to estimate exposure, the accuracy of exposure estimations can be increased significantly. However, a lot of modelling choices has to be made concerning the valuation <b>of</b> <b>transactions</b> and the stochastic model of underlying market rates. Because the system has to make projections of market rates into the far future, the choice of an appropriate stochastic model for market rate dynamics is crucial in order to prevent unreasonable scenarios. The predominant application of models based on Brownian Motion in today’s bank risk management therefore leads to questionable results in respect to derivatives exposure evaluation...|$|R

Although portfolio utility functions {{can take many}} forms, common formulations define it as the expected <b>portfolio</b> return (net <b>of</b> <b>transaction</b> and financing costs) minus a cost of risk. The latter component, the cost of risk, {{is defined as the}} portfolio risk multiplied by a risk aversion parameter (or unit price of risk). Practitioners often add additional constraints to improve diversification and further limit risk. Examples of such constraints are asset, sector, and region portfolio weight limits.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to compare two {{different}} <b>portfolio</b> strategies consisting <b>of</b> insider <b>transactions</b> and stock recommendations and examine whether they posses any information advantage.   The portfolios are balanced once every three-, six- and twelve- months in the period of 2007 - 2009. Our results show a pattern for these investment strategies. The <b>portfolio</b> consisting <b>of</b> insider <b>transactions</b> generates a positive return in equity in a negative market environment and the opposite reaction in a positive environment. The result for the <b>portfolio</b> consisting <b>of</b> stock recommendations show a positive return of equity in positive environment and the opposite effect in negative environment. The pattern that has been observed can be classified as an anomaly. Therefore, we conclude that the market cannot be classified as efficient in a short term perspective. This anomaly is short-lived which indicates that the market is efficient in a long term perspective. ...|$|R

With the usual disclaimer on remaining errors, the authors acknowledge the stimulating exchange of ideas with Remko Ybema and Alexander Gijsen. The ECN project number is 7. 7513. 03. 01. Throughout the past years, the frontrunners in the field of carbon trading have started establishing their businesses. Some market actors took action towards achieving their emission targets under the Kyoto Protocol, such as the Dutch government, and others commenced establishing a market not for own use but for general market start-up purposes, such as the World Bank’s Prototype Carbon Fund. Also smaller businesses started to explore the possibilities of trading in carbon credits in different fields. Several smaller voluntary initiatives are also reported, mainly aimed at individual consumer activities, households or small companies. Carbon accounting for emissions resulting of air travel or household energy use and individual transport is in place in both Europe and the United States. With an increased consciousness of organisations and the general public of the problems associated with greenhouse gas emissions, voluntary agreements like these may gain a significant market share. This report gives an overview of general preferences of technology, type of project and other characteristics of projects. Only projects approved by all parties involved are reviewed. It can be concluded that projects under CDM have a preference for large-scale hydro, gas capture and fuel switch projects, which each constitute almost 25 % of the total CDM emission reductions...|$|R

40|$|Climate {{change and}} its {{mitigation}} is rapidly becoming {{an item of}} social concern. Climate change mitigation involves reduction of atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations through emissions reduction and or sequestration enhancement (collectively called offsets). Many have asked how agriculture and forestry can participate in mitigation efforts. Given that over 80 percent of greenhouse gas emissions arise from the energy sector, the role of agriculture and forestry depends critically on {{the costs of the}} offsets they can achieve in comparison with offset costs elsewhere in the economy. A number of researchers have examined the relative offset costs but have generally looked only at producer level costs. However there are also costs incurred when implementing, selling and conveying offset credits to a buyer. Also when commodities are involved like bioenergy feedstocks, the costs of readying these for use in implementing an offset strategy need to be reflected. This generally involves the broadly defined category <b>of</b> <b>transaction</b> costs. This dissertation examines the possible effects <b>of</b> <b>transactions</b> costs and storage costs for bioenergy commodities and how they affect the agriculture and forestry <b>portfolio</b> <b>of</b> mitigation strategies across a range of carbon dioxide equivalent prices. The model is used to simulate the effects with and without transactions and storage costs. Using an agriculture and forestry sector model called FASOMGHG, the dissertation finds that consideration <b>of</b> <b>transactions</b> and storage costs reduces the agricultural contribution total mitigation and changes the desirable <b>portfolio</b> <b>of</b> alternatives. In terms <b>of</b> the <b>portfolio,</b> <b>transactions</b> costs inclusion diminishes the desirability of soil sequestration and forest management while increasing the bioenergy and afforestation role. Storage costs diminish the bioenergy role and favor forest and sequestration items. The results of this study illustrate that transactions and storage costs are important considerations in policy and market design when addressing the reduction of greenhouse gas concentrations in climate change related decision making...|$|R
