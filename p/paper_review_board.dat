5000|$|On May 6, 1953, {{the first}} Administrative Committee (AdCom) {{meeting of the}} newly formed PGUE was held in Washington D.C. The first AdCom {{felt that it was}} very {{important}} to have a journal where members could publish their papers. The first issue of the Transactions of the Professional Group on Ultrasonics Engineering was published in June, 1954, one year after formation of PGUS. The first Editor-in-Chief of the Transactions was Oskar E. Mattiat of Clevite-Brush Development Co., ably assisted by a <b>Paper</b> <b>Review</b> <b>Board</b> of three from the Electrical Engineering Department of the University of Illinois. The review board was led by Dr. William J. Fry, with Frank J. Fry, a brother, and Floyd Dunn, a graduate student under Fry, assisting. The review board ceased in 1962, and Associate Editors were appointed in 1963.|$|E

There are a myriad number of ways to approach this goal. Separating the significant few from the trivial many involves listening to market demands and responding with the appropriate investment in capital and or, process improvements that provides solutions. This <b>paper</b> <b>reviews</b> the existing <b>boarding</b> environment and processes in and around the gate hold room area and proposes improvements through a threefold approach. First, add dynamic informational displays that update information regarding the boarding status. Second, reengineer the boarding sequence to reduce {{the time it takes to}} board and third, reengineer the process of loading carry-on luggage...|$|R
40|$|Abstract – Chip Scale Packages {{have become}} a major new {{packaging}} format in recent years. One of the first industries to embrace this package format is the mobile communications sector. CSP’s offer several advantages over leaded components, such as relatively small footprint, and can be processed with standard surface mount equipment. They have become so popular that CSP’s are now used in almost all phone designs. Originally {{it was believed that}} chip scale packages would not require underfilling to meet reliability requirements. However most manufacturers have found it necessary to underfill these devices, to be able to meet users expectations for reliable phones. As the functionality of mobile phone handset increases, the complexity of the handset system PCB increases. This is pushing component densities to higher levels and the space between the CSP and the nearest components is has been drastically reduced in recent years. This now requires that strategies for underfilling CSP’s include the effect of the adjacent passive components. This <b>paper</b> will <b>review</b> <b>board</b> construction materials and placement of CSP and adjacent passive components and look at their impact on the underfill process. We will also discuss underfill of components under radio frequency shields...|$|R
40|$|The {{scope of}} this work {{is to provide a}} {{framework}} that can facilitate the detailed simulation of gypsum board thermo-chemistry at ambient and elevated temperature conditions. The <b>paper</b> <b>reviews</b> gypsum <b>board</b> thermo-chemistry, presents a methodological approach for the calculation of composition and reaction energy, and focuses on methods calculating the 'kinetic triplet'. The chemical kinetics of three main reactions that take place when a gypsum board is exposed at elevated temperatures: evaporation of free moisture content, dehydration of chemically bound water and crystal mesh reorganization were investigated using Differential Scanning Calorimetry measurements under non isothermal conditions and in an inert atmosphere. Experiments using samples of deionized water and commercial gypsum board were carried out at temperatures up to 600 °C, with different heating rates. Mass and energy balance equations were considered in order to define the initial composition of a gypsum board and the energy that is absorbed/produced after the completion of the examined reactions. Model-free and model-fitting approaches were used for the definition of the kinetic parameters of the examined reactions. The approach minimizes the need for expensive and detailed experiments necessary for the determination of the gypsum board behavior at elevated temperatures. © 2011 Elsevier B. V.

Second, the <b>paper</b> <b>reviews</b> recent debates regarding the roles of politics and theory in US ethnographic research. A third focus is placed on methodological issues, such as the increasing diversity of ethnographic research methods and designs, as well as a new set of research requirements administered by ethical <b>review</b> <b>boards</b> at all US universities...|$|R

5000|$|Once {{a person}} is found not criminally {{responsible}} ("NCR"), {{he or she will}} have a hearing by a <b>Review</b> <b>Board</b> within 45 days (90 days if the court extends the delay). A <b>Review</b> <b>Board</b> is established under Part XX.1 of the Criminal Code and is composed of at least three members, a person who is a judge or eligible to be a judge, a psychiatrist and another expert in a relevant field, such as social work, criminology or psychology. Parties at a <b>Review</b> <b>Board</b> hearing are usually the accused, the Crown and the hospital responsible for the supervision or assessment of the accused. A <b>Review</b> <b>Board</b> is responsible for both accused persons found NCR or accused persons found unfit to stand trial on account of mental disorder. A <b>Review</b> <b>Board</b> dealing with an NCR offender must consider two questions: whether the accused is a [...] "significant threat to the safety of the public" [...] and, if so, what the [...] "least onerous and least restrictive" [...] restrictions on the liberty of the accused should be in order to mitigate such a threat. Proceedings before a <b>Review</b> <b>Board</b> are inquisitorial rather than adversarial. Often the <b>Review</b> <b>Board</b> will be active in conducting an inquiry. Where the <b>Review</b> <b>Board</b> is unable to conclude that the accused is a significant threat to the safety of the public, the <b>review</b> <b>board</b> must grant the accused an absolute discharge, an order essentially terminating the jurisdiction of the criminal law over the accused. Otherwise the <b>Review</b> <b>Board</b> must order that the accused be either discharged subject to conditions or detained in a hospital, both subject to conditions. The conditions imposed must be the least onerous and least restrictive necessary to mitigate any danger the accused may pose to others.|$|R

The significant difference between Dispute <b>Review</b> <b>Boards</b> and most other Alternate Dispute Review techniques (and possibly the reason why or Dispute <b>Review</b> <b>Boards</b> have had such success in recent years) is that the Dispute <b>Review</b> <b>Board</b> is appointed at the commencement of a project before any disputes arise and, by undertaking regular visits to the site, is actively involved throughout the project (and possibly any agreed period thereafter).|$|R
