2500|$|Carboxylic acids are {{commonly}} identified using their trivial names, and usually have the suffix -ic acid. IUPAC-recommended names also exist; in this system, carboxylic acids have an -oic acid suffix. For example, butyric acid (C3H7CO2H) is butanoic acid by IUPAC guidelines. The -oic acid nomenclature detail {{is based on}} the name of the previously-known chemical benzoic acid. For nomenclature of complex molecules containining a carboxylic acid, the carboxyl can be considered position one of the parent chain even if there are other substituents, for example, 3-chloropropanoic acid.

2500|$|The {{names of}} organic {{compounds}} are either systematic, following logically from {{a set of}} rules, or nonsystematic, following various traditions. Systematic nomenclature is stipulated by specifications from IUPAC. [...] Systematic nomenclature starts with the name for a <b>parent</b> <b>structure</b> within the molecule of interest. [...] This parent name is then modified by prefixes, suffixes, and numbers to unambiguously convey the structure. Given that millions of organic compounds are known, rigorous use of systematic names can be cumbersome. [...] Thus, IUPAC recommendations are more closely followed for simple compounds, but not complex molecules. [...] To use the systematic naming, one must know the structures and names of the parent structures. [...] Parent structures include unsubstituted hydrocarbons, heterocycles, and monofunctionalized derivatives thereof.|$|E

We predict an altogether new crystal structure in Cd-Pt and Pd-Pt, and several new ground states in Pd-rich and Pt-rich binary systems...|$|R

Out of all renewable energy sources, the Sun is the only source that produces enough energy to fulfill all our energy needs, {{now and in the}} future. Photovoltaics based on -conjugated polymers are envisioned to offer a low cost alternative to the present technology, but optimization of the polymer structure is needed to achieve efficiencies high enough to make this technology economically viable. This thesis deals with both the optimization of several <b>parent</b> <b>structures</b> via the process of energy level engineering and establishing structure-property relationships upon alteration of these <b>parent</b> <b>structures.</b> The initial work explored the effect of carbon-silicon exchange on various physical, optical and photovoltaic properties of fluorene/silafluorene-based copolymers. The optical, redox and photovoltaic properties of these polymers remained virtually unchanged except for the thermal behavior. The work was continued by optimizing the energy levels and bandgap of TQ 1 with the aim to surpass its already high power conversion efficiency of 6 %. Aside from improved spectral coverage and energy level optimization, several interesting structure-property relationships were found. Finally, another well-performing structure, PDPPTPT, was modified with alkoxy sidechains to investigate the effect on various polymer properties. Aside from a redshifted absorption, additional flexibility in the polymer backbone was obtained with concomitant changes in polymer properties. By comparing polymer and oligomer properties, methoxy substitution seems to initially increase melting and crystallization temperatures, but this is then supposedly counteracted due to increased irregularity in the polymer backbone...|$|R
