40|$|Analyses {{and design}} studies were {{conducted}} on the technical and economic feasibility of installing the JT 8 D- 109 refan engine on the DC- 9 aircraft. Design criteria included minimum change to the airframe to achieve desired acoustic levels. Several acoustic configurations were studied with two selected for detailed investigations. The minimum selected acoustic treatment configuration results in an estimated aircraft weight increase of 608 kg (1, 342 lb) and the maximum selected acoustic treatment configuration results in an estimated aircraft weight increase of 809 kg (1, 784 lb). The range loss for the minimum and maximum selected acoustic treatment configurations based on long range cruise at 10 668 m (35, 000 ft) altitude with a typical payload of 6 804 kg (15, 000 lb) amounts to 54 km (86 n. mi.) respectively. Estimated reduction in EPNL's for minimum selected treatment show 8 EPNdB at approach, 12 EPNdB for takeoff with <b>power</b> <b>cutback,</b> 15 EPNdB for takeoff without <b>power</b> <b>cutback</b> and 12 EPNdB for sideline using FAR Part 36. Little difference was estimated in EPNL between minimum and maximum treatments due to reduced performance of maximum treatment. No major technical problems were encountered in the study. The refan concept for the DC- 9 appears technically feasible and economically viable at approximately $ 1, 000, 000 per airplane. An additional study of the installation of JT 3 D- 9 refan engine on the DC- 8 - 50 / 61 and DC- 8 - 62 / 63 aircraft is included. Three levels of acoustic treatment were suggested for DC- 8 - 50 / 61 and two levels for DC- 8 - 62 / 63. Results indicate the DC- 8 technically can be retrofitted with refan engines for approximately $ 2, 500, 000 per airplane...|$|E
40|$|Now days, energy {{consumption}} in conniving of mobile wireless network {{is very important}} research topic due to its pervasive ingress and large potential consumption.

40|$|The noise during takeoff of a {{supersonic}} transport is {{calculated for the}} flyover and the lateral reference noise measurement points defined by ICAO Annex 16. Only the contribution of jet mixing noise is considered. The influences of the following parameters are considered: jet speed, aircraft weight, aircraft wing loading, aircraft lift-to-drag ratio, {{and the amount of}} <b>power</b> <b>cutback</b> after takeoff. The influence of the takeoff procedure is also studied. It is shown that jet speed has the largest influence of all parameters and that values of about 400 m/s or less are required to satisfy the noise limits that are currently valid for subsonic aircraft. Such low jet speeds can be achieved by choosing large engine bypass ratios or by employing ejector mixers with large nozzle exit diameters. The first solution may be difficult to realize technically for a {{supersonic transport}}, the second solution requires that the mixer can be fully retracted, which may be impossible because of its size...|$|E

Model Propulsion Simulator test rigs able to mount contrarotating fan blades of up to 24. 5 -inch diameter were used, and one of these was installed in a large anechoic test chamber for acoustic measurement of conditions simulating representative takeoffs, <b>power</b> <b>cutbacks,</b> and landing approaches.

This not only drained the game of achievements, as ballplayers marched off to serve their country, but also created severe {{restrictions}} on the game through gas rationing and electrical <b>power,</b> travel <b>cutbacks</b> and the elimination of night games in coastal areas {{on both sides of the}} country.|$|R
25|$|In the 21st {{century as}} the PRC vastly {{increased}} its defense spending, Taiwan registered the lowest growth {{in defense spending}} of the major Asia-Pacific <b>powers.</b> These <b>cutbacks</b> where felt as vital land based systems were cut in order to afford an upgrade of aging fourth generation jet fighters (needed {{to respond to the}} PRC's fifth generation fighter programs). And even the jet fighter upgrades were cut back in areas such as high performance jet engines. The U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission found that these defense cuts could jeopardize Taiwan's military preparedness.|$|R
40|$|A novel {{process for}} the {{fabrication}} of Long Range Surface Plasmon Polariton (LRSPP) waveguide based biosensors is presented herein. The structure of the biosensor is comprised of Au stripe waveguide devices embedded in thick CYTOP claddings with a SiO 2 solvent diffusion barrier and etch-stop layer. The SiO 2 layer is introduced to improve the end quality of Au waveguide structures, which previously deformed during the deposit of the upper cladding process and to limit the over-etching of CYTOP to create micro-fluidic channels. The E-beam evaporation method is adapted to deposit a thin SiO 2 on the bottom cladding of CYTOP. A new micro-fluidic design pattern is introduced. Micro-fluidic channels were created on selective Au waveguides through O 2 plasma etching. The presented data and figures are refractive index measurements of different materials, thickness measurements, microscope images, and AFM images. Optical <b>power</b> <b>cutback</b> measurements were performed on fully CYTOP-cladded symmetric LRSPP waveguides. The end-fire coupling method was used to excite LRSPP modes with cleaved polarization maintaining (PM) fibre. The measured mode power attenuation (MPA) was 6. 7 dB/mm after using index-matched liquid at input and output fibre-waveguide interfaces. The results were compared with the theoretical calculations and simulations. Poor coupling efficiency and scattering due to the SiO 2 are suspected for off-target measurements...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{aircraft}} operational techniques {{in the terminal}} area on community noise impact of future short-haul aircraft was investigated. These operational techniques affected altitude, flap retraction rate, thrust cutback altitude, amount of thrust cutback, and amount of turning. During landing the parameters varied were glide slope angle, change in slope angle (two segment approach), and flap extension rate. One mechanical-flap (MF) aircraft and one externally-blown-flap (EBF) aircraft were used to study by noise impact at four U. S. airports, Hanscom Field (Boston); Washington National; Midway (Chicago); and Orange County (California). With the exception of Washington National (DCA), the study showed that a reduction of approximately 40 percent {{in the number of}} people highly annoyed (as defined in the study) can be obtained by using these operational techniques. At DCA the number of people highly annoyed using the standard procedure was quite low, but it is significant that the minimumimpact case for Runway 36 reduced the number of people highly annoyed to zero using a <b>power</b> <b>cutback</b> and a turning departure path. The evaluation procedures and methodology developed in this study represents an advance in acoustical state-of-the-art and should provide an effective and useful tool for determining aircraft noise impact upon the airport community...|$|E
40|$|The {{inspectors}} reviewed a self-revealing non-cited {{violation of}} 10 CFR 50. 65 a(4), for the licensee’s failure {{to assess and}} manage an increase in risk prior to planned maintenance activities. Specifically, on January 25, 2012, the licensee failed to include the potential to deenergize a 4. 16 kV bus when working on a control room hand switch in the risk assessment for Unit 2, resulting in an unplanned reactor <b>power</b> <b>cutback.</b> The licensee plans to revise procedures, as a corrective action, {{to develop and implement}} a structured operational risk assessment process for use by the senior reactor operator when authorizing un-scheduled work to commence in the field. The licensee entered this issue into the corrective action program as Palo Verde Action Request (PVAR) 4036588. The licensee’s failure to assess and manage an increase in risk prior to planned maintenance activities was a performance deficiency. The performance deficiency is more than minor, and therefore a finding, because it affects the equipment performance attribute of the Initiating Events Cornerstone and its objective of limiting the likelihood of those events that upset plant stability and challenge critical safety functions during power operations. Because the licensee utilizes a qualitative risk assessment for these maintenance activities, Manual Chapter 0609, Appendix K, “Maintenance Risk Assessment and Risk Management Significance Determination Process, ” Flowchart 2, could not be used to determine the risk significance of the finding. Using the qualitative review process of Manual Chapte...|$|E
500|$|The crisis also {{prompted}} the Ministry of Foreign Affairs {{to reduce its}} foreign aid to developing nations, from 0.31% to 0.27% of GNP. [...] The effect of the aid cut was greatly amplified by the falling value of the króna: {{the budget of the}} Icelandic International Development Agency (ICEIDA) was reduced from US$22 million to $13 million. [...] Since Iceland's foreign aid is targeted in sectors for which the country has particular expertise (e.g., fisheries, geothermal <b>power),</b> the <b>cutbacks</b> will have a substantial impact in countries which receive Icelandic aid – most noticeably in Sri Lanka, where ICEIDA is pulling out altogether.|$|R
40|$|Predicted {{engine core}} noise levels for subsonic CTOL {{aircraft}} engines are compared with measured total aircraft noise levels and to current and proposed federal noise certification requirements. Comparisons are made at FAR- 36 measuring stations and {{take into consideration}} both full and <b>cutback</b> <b>power</b> operations at takeoff. The spectral shape used for the prediction of core noise is identified as the spectral envelope, with a peak at 400 Hz which {{is assumed to be}} shifted in flight by a Doppler shift in frequency. Preceived noise levels are computed for appropriate engine power settings at desired flight conditions, and reductions in sideline noise levels are made to account for jet and airframe shielding effects. Results indicate that core noise can provide a barrier to the proposed EPA stage 4 and 5 federal noise rules for wide-body aircraft, with the most severe core noise problem occurring at takeoff and sideline measuring stations...|$|R
40|$|Credence to systems {{weights and}} {{assurance}} that the noise study AST concept can be balanced were studied. Current titanium structural technology is assumed. A duct-burning turbofan variable stream control engine (VSCE), with noise reduction potential through use of a coannular nozzle was used. With 273 passengers, range of the AST- 105 - 1 for a cruise Mach number of 2. 62 is essentially transpacific. Lift-to-drag ratio is slightly higher than for previous AST configurations. It is trimmable over a center-of-gravity range of 4. 7 m (15. 5 ft). Inherent high positive effective dihedral, typical of arrow-wing configurations in high-lift approach, would limit AST- 105 - 1 to operating in crosswinds of 11. 6 m/sec (22. 4 kt), or less, with 75 percent of available lateral control. Normal <b>power</b> takeoff with <b>cutback</b> results in noise in excess of Federal Aviation Regulation Part 36 but less than for conventional procedure takeoff. Results of advanced (noncertificated) programmed throttle takeoff and approach procedures, not yet optimized, indicate that such {{can be an important}} additional method noise reduction...|$|R
40|$|Langley Research Center (LaRC) has {{for years}} {{been a leader}} in field {{acoustic}} array measurement technique. Two field-deployable digital measurement systems have been developed to support acoustic research programs at LaRC. For several years, LaRC has used the Digital Acoustic Measurement System (DAMS) for measuring the acoustic noise levels from rotorcraft and tiltrotor aircraft. Recently, a second system called Remote Acquisition and Storage System (RASS) was developed and deployed {{for the first time in}} the field along with DAMS system for the Community Noise Flight Test using the NASA LaRC- 757 aircraft during April, 2000. The test was performed at Airborne Airport in Wilmington, OH to validate predicted noise reduction benefits from alternative operational procedures. The test matrix was composed of various combinations of altitude, <b>cutback</b> <b>power,</b> and aircraft weight. The DAMS digitizes the acoustic inputs at the microphone site and can be located up to 2000 feet from the van which houses the acquisition, storage and analysis equipment. Digitized data from up to 10 microphones is recorded on a Jaz disk and is analyzed post-test by microcomputer system. The RASS digitizes and stores acoustic inputs at the microphone site that can be located up to three miles from the base station and can compose a 3 mile by 3 mile array of microphones. 16 -bit digitized data from the microphones is stored on removable Jaz disk and is transferred through a high speed array to a very large high speed permanent storage device. Up to 30 microphones can be utilized in the array. System control and monitoring is accomplished via Radio Frequency (RF) link. This paper will present a detailed description of both systems, along with acoustic data analysis from both systems...|$|R
