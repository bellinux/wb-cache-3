40|$|The thesis {{describes}} {{conditions for}} carrying out cabotage in road freight transport, in comparison to current and past development at the EU level, and in transport policy of the EU described in the primary law. The most current changes at the field <b>of</b> <b>cabotage</b> are a good precondition for the future growth {{of this type of}} transport. The issue <b>of</b> <b>cabotage</b> could be described in three groups of topics, the first being the unified EU regulations <b>of</b> <b>cabotage</b> and conditions set {{for carrying out}} cabotage, the second concerns topics, that are similar in every EU country due to harmonization of national law, for example the payment of VAT, admission to the occupancy of road haulier or technical conditions for vehicles. The third group deals with matters that are different in every EU country, e. g. toll systems. Carrying out cabotage is therefore to be adjusted to all aforesaid conditions, which have a direct influence to the economical background <b>of</b> <b>cabotage</b> transports...|$|R

40|$|Traditionally, the United States has {{aspired to}} the {{operation}} of its industries {{in a system of}} free enterprise. One of the oldest instances of government intervention in shipping - the cabotage law- was designed to preserve for domestic vessels all trade between domestic points. Recently, however, developments in maritime commerce have led United States courts to an examination <b>of</b> <b>cabotage</b> legislation. The result has noticeably limited the scope of United States coast-wise laws. Specifically, questions have arisen over: 1) the eligibility for coastwise trade of vessels which have been reconstructed from parts of two other ships, 2) the application <b>of</b> <b>cabotage</b> legislation to cargo which returns to the United States after having been processed or refined abroad, 6 and 3) the entry into coastwise trade of federally subsidized vessels. After discussing the purpose and scope <b>of</b> the <b>cabotage</b> law, this Note will discuss these issues and their significance in the overall scheme of United States shipping...|$|R

40|$|The term air {{cabotage}} {{refers to the}} carriage of air traffic between two points within {{the territory of the}} same state. This carriage is generally reserved to the aircraft of the territorial state and is thus inaccessible to foreign carriers. This thesis gives a brief account of the origins of the concept <b>of</b> <b>cabotage</b> in maritime law and of its introduction in the early international air law conventions. The thesis then proceeds to focus on the problem <b>of</b> air <b>cabotage</b> in the North-American context and particularly on the current bilateral negotiations between the USA and Canada at which cabotage rights in the USA are being sought by Canada. It further projects on the EEC context, where air transport liberalization measures toward the completion of a single integrated market will eventually (perhaps very soon) lead to the availability for Community carriers <b>of</b> <b>cabotage</b> rights within any EEC Member State. The creation <b>of</b> a "Community <b>cabotage</b> area" where only Community carriers would be able to carry Community traffic is also analyzed. Finally, the consequences of these developments are examined as far as EEC Member States' obligations under the Chicago Convention and relations with third states are concerned.

50|$|From {{the end of}} March 2014, {{the airline}} withdrew its Ancona-Roma Fiumicino and Trapani-Roma Fiumicino routes, as a result <b>of</b> <b>cabotage</b> restrictions, which prevent Swiss {{aviation}} companies from operating domestic flights in the European Union. It was previously possible for Darwin Airline to fly these routes thanks to a derogation from the Italian Civil Aviation Authority, however, this was not renewed. In January 2014, Darwin Airline cancelled its Aosta-Roma Fiumicino route before it had commenced; a result <b>of</b> the same <b>cabotage</b> and the European Union's refusal to make an exception for a Swiss company.|$|R

40|$|A {{significant}} proportion of offshore trade with North America is carried in 20 and 40 foot marine containers. It would appear logical to use empty international marine containers in domestic service if controlled by a Canadian carrier. Until recently this form <b>of</b> <b>cabotage</b> was restricted by Canadian customs regulations. This paper examines the environmental impact <b>of</b> the <b>cabotage</b> regime on the movement of international containers in Canadian domestic service and how these regulations influenced supply chain efficiencies. The discussion begins with a historical perspective and theoretical underpinning, followed by a comparison of North American container regulations. A review of global reforms and contemporary perspectives on cabotage regulations is provided, followed by a chronology of Canadian container regulatory reform. An economic framework and method of analysis is presented and three case studies are examined to illustrate the environmental and economic impact <b>of</b> a liberalized <b>cabotage</b> regime...|$|R

40|$|The {{impediments to}} the {{contracting}} of marriage are those circumstances expressly stipulated {{by the law}} whose existence incapacitates the contracting of marriage. The article present and analyzes the impediments to marriage according to articles 5 - 9 of the Family Code and to art. 273 - 277 of the Civil Code. Thus, we will see that according to art. 5 - 9 of the Family Code and to art. 273 - 276 of the Civil Code the impediments to marriage are: 1. {{the existence of a}} previous valid marriage (the state of bigamy); 2. the <b>prohibition</b> <b>of</b> marriage between blood relatives; 3. the <b>prohibition</b> <b>of</b> marriage between relatives by adoption; 4. the <b>prohibition</b> <b>of</b> marriage between the legal tutor and the minor child; 5. the <b>prohibition</b> <b>of</b> marriage of the mentally alienated people and of the mentally retarded people; 6. the <b>prohibition</b> <b>of</b> marriage between the people who suffer from temporary lack of judgment; 7. the <b>prohibition</b> <b>of</b> same-sex marriage. However, the provisions in the Civil Code only bring under regulation as an impediment the <b>prohibition</b> <b>of</b> marriage between the persons who suffer from temporary lack of judgment. Art. 277 paragraph 3 in the Civil Code stipulates the <b>prohibition</b> <b>of</b> the civil partnerships between people of different or same sex. the Family Code, the new Civil Code, impediments to the contracting of marriage, the existence of a previous valid marriage (the state of bigamy); 2. the <b>prohibition</b> <b>of</b> marriage between blood relatives; the <b>prohibition</b> <b>of</b> marriage between relatives by adoption; the <b>prohibition</b> <b>of</b> marriage between the legal tutor and the minor child; the <b>prohibition</b> <b>of</b> marriage of the mentally alienated people and of the mentally retarded people; the <b>prohibition</b> <b>of</b> marriage between the people who suffer from temporary lack <b>of</b> judgment; the <b>prohibition</b> <b>of</b> same-sex marriage...|$|R

40|$|This {{article will}} address the issue {{regarding}} <b>prohibition</b> <b>of</b> torture and its challenges at two levels: ASEAN and Indonesia. The <b>prohibition</b> <b>of</b> torture {{is considered to be}} a rule of “jus cogens” or peremptory norm as well as customary law. In addition the <b>prohibition</b> <b>of</b> torture is absolute and non-derogable. Therefore. it entails some obligations for states whether or not they ratify the CAT. States have the universal obligations to prevent torture and inhuman degrading treatment in theirjurisdiction under international customary law. Since many of ASEAN countries do not ratified ICCPR, the AICHR have to implement the <b>prohibition</b> <b>of</b> torture based on the customary international law. In addition, AICHR needs to monitor the national law regarding the <b>prohibition</b> <b>of</b> torture. However. theAlCHR lacks of protection mandate and might not mnctioning well especially when dealing with the allegation <b>of</b> the <b>prohibition</b> <b>of</b> torture or other human rights’ allegations within ASEAN jurisdiction. In Indonesia. the use of torture to get the confession is widely used by the police. Not all the perpetrators are brought to the Court of Law and are given an equitable sentences: although. Indonesia does have a regulation on <b>prohibition</b> <b>of</b> torture; the Criminal Code, the Law No 39 / 1999 concerning Human Rights. and the Law No. 26 / 2000 concerning Human Rights Courts.

Part II then reviews the provisions and impact of Regulation 3577 / 92 which continued and complemented the development of the EC common shipping policy initiated by the 1986 Legislative Package.
