This involves observing paw prints in the ground and taking measurements of width, length and indentation to determine the individual that was in the location. Dogs are also used to assist tracking the tiger by smell. Once the tigers are found, photographs, drawings and notes regarding sex, location, and other details of the individual are taken and sent back to the study camp. There are also multiple reserves that allow professional guided tourists to explore via elephant mahout, where sightings are recorded if tigers are seen along the trails.|$|E
5000|$|In the 1990s a {{group of}} friends got {{together}} to form an NGO called Tiger Watch (TW), of which Rathore was made the Vice-Chairman.

In 2004 DK produced a report which contradicted the Forest Department’s claim that the census showed 45 tigers in the park. According to DK’s report there were just 26. He substantiated his claim with photographs taken by camera traps, a more foolproof method of tiger <b>population</b> <b>estimation</b> than the old method of taking plaster casts of pugmarks.

The distribution and <b>population</b> <b>estimations</b> provided by the IUCN are based on occasional field sampling or non-rigorous methodologies and could be erroneous and misleading. To obtain reliable <b>estimations</b> of the <b>population</b> size and distribution of three threatened species, Calopteryx exul, Coenagrion mercuriale, and Gomphus lucasii, we first conducted capture-mark-recapture in a natural population during one flight season, and second we carried out intensive sampling of adults, larvae and exuviae in the Seybouse watershed, Northeast Algeria. In addition, a revision of odonate occurrence and distribution in the watershed was done by pooling information collected over six years (2010 – 2015). Our results show that <b>population</b> <b>estimations</b> of the three species are much higher than what the IUCN presents; that is, 2208 individuals of C. exul (22. 08 % of the estimated global population), 1765 individuals of C. mercuriale, and 11, 204 individuals of Gomphus lucasii (about 4. 5 times as large as the estimated global population). Moreover, a total of 42 species were recorded in the study site, of which seven are new. The mean number of localities per species increased by a factor of 2. 47, e. g. from six to 12 in C. exul, two to 12 in Coenagrion mercuriale and five to 14 in Gomphus lucasii.
