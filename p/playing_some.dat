5|$|A band {{formed by}} the American musicians Thomas Jude on guitars, Paul Morris on keyboards, Nick Douglas on bass and Tom Coombs on drums was {{assembled}} for the supporting tour. Doro was a more commercial offering than the previous album, but resulted in a flop in the US. On the contrary, it sold well in Europe, accelerating PolyGram's decision to interrupt the publication of Doro's albums in America, where the commercial appeal of glam metal and classic rock acts was rapidly declining in favor of grunge and alternative rock. Doro concluded 1990 <b>playing</b> <b>some</b> dates in Germany, opening for Scorpions.|$|E

5|$|McMillin's {{success in}} Louisiana {{allowed him to}} move on to Geneva College in Beaver Falls, Pennsylvania, where he was the school's 13th head {{football}} coach for three seasons (1925–1927).

Geneva College fans generally consider McMillin among the best coaches in school history. His teams, renowned for <b>playing</b> <b>some</b> of the best teams in college football, prided themselves on a challenging schedule. Geneva opened the 1926 season with a 16–7 upset of Harvard.|$|E
5|$|Zoldak {{was born}} on December 8, 1918 in Brooklyn, New York. He was raised by his mother, and worked at her {{confectionery}} shop, both while {{he was growing up}} and during the baseball offseason. He attended Eastern District High School, and took up the game of baseball at McCarren Park, as his high school did not have a baseball team. He began his professional career with the Palatka Azaleas in 1938, and threw 13 innings in two games. He was released afterwards, and played college baseball for the Fordham Rams baseball team while also <b>playing</b> <b>some</b> semi-professional baseball for a team in Cedarhurst, New York.

5|$|Leeds {{finished}} second in the league for the third successive season in the 1971–72 campaign, despite <b>playing</b> <b>some</b> of the best football in the club's history. They knocked out Bristol Rovers, Liverpool, Cardiff City, Tottenham Hotspur and Birmingham City to reach the 1972 FA Cup Final with Arsenal; they then won the trophy {{for the first time in}} the club's history with Allan Clarke scoring the final's only goal. Two days after the final Leeds could have secured the Double by winning a point against Wolverhampton Wanderers at Molineux, but a 21 defeat handed the title to Derby County. On 3 February 1982, Bremner won £100,000 libel damages, along with legal costs, after he sued the Sunday People newspaper for publishing an article on 11 September 1977 that alleged he tried to fix football matches, including the May 1972 game at Wolves.|$|E
5|$|McCarty {{remained}} a {{presence on the}} field for the Knights in 2001, expanding his role by <b>playing</b> <b>some</b> snaps as a fullback.

McCarty also finished that game with 110 yards and two touchdowns on only three carries. Despite giving up only 19 points during the entire regular season, the Knights lost 32–26 in the quarter-finals of the playoffs against the Centennial Centaurs after McCarty was stopped one yard away from the endzone on the last play of the game.|$|E
5|$|Prokofiev was a soloist {{with the}} London Symphony Orchestra, {{conducted}} by Piero Coppola, {{in the first}} recording of his Piano Concerto No. 3, recorded in London by His Master's Voice in June 1932.

5|$|Siwiec's timing {{has been}} {{described}} as unfortunate, as he chose to commit his act during a dance (mazurka), at which time his cry was muffled due to the sounds of an orchestra <b>playing.</b> <b>Some,</b> like Tomas Kavaliauskas or Krzysztof Kąkolewski, have speculated that if he had chosen to act moments earlier, during a speech by Polish communist leader Władysław Gomułka, first secretary of the Polish United Workers Party, the commotion he caused would have likely interrupted it and his message might have been witnessed more widely. Publicist Antoni Zambrowski noted that many other self-immolators like Czech Jan Palach had cooperated with anti-communist opposition movements and left messages and other documents which helped publicize their activities; Siwiec worked alone and so the Polish anti-communist opposition with which he identified with was not aware of his action and the meaning behind it until much later.|$|E
