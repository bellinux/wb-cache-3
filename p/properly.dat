5|$|Class II: LDLR is not <b>properly</b> transported {{from the}} {{endoplasmic}} reticulum to the Golgi apparatus for expression {{on the cell}} surface.|$|E
5|$|Class III: LDLR {{does not}} <b>properly</b> bind LDL {{on the cell}} surface because of a defect in either apolipoprotein B100 (R3500Q) or in LDL-R.|$|E

5|$|Fodor's own position, instead, {{is that to}} <b>properly</b> {{account for}} the nature of {{intentional}} attitudes, {{it is necessary to}} employ a three-place relation between individuals, representations and propositional contents.|$|E
5|$|Historically, people repored that Fragile Allegiance did {{not work}} <b>properly</b> on Windows XP and later Windows platforms, as the game was {{designed}} for MS-DOS and ported to Windows 95. The most common issues being reported are no audio, the game failing to start, and the game crashing when trying to rename anything, including saved games. As no patch was ever released for the game, people have had to use emulators such as VDMSound or DOSBox {{in order to get}} the game to function <b>properly</b> but it may still crash when trying to rename a saved game.|$|E
5|$|In addition, {{while they}} might not <b>properly</b> be called process philosophers, Whitehead has been {{influential}} {{in the philosophy of}} Gilles Deleuze, Milič Čapek, Isabelle Stengers, Bruno Latour, Susanne Langer, and Maurice Merleau-Ponty.|$|E

5|$|Placing {{the hedge}} hopper {{so that it}} worked <b>properly</b> proved {{difficult}} to get right and the War Office discouraged its use in favour of the more conventional flame fougasse installation.|$|E
5|$|<b>Properly</b> {{equipped}} {{and experienced}} canoeists can kayak {{to the island}} from Hartland Point or Lee Bay. This takes 4 to 6 hours depending on wind and tides.|$|E
5|$|Rapid {{technical}} advancements in transmission tomography {{made possible}} the very good specificity and sensitivity capability of this technique, enabling the possibility of <b>properly</b> seeing the superficial tissues.|$|E
5|$|Reuleaux triangles {{have also}} been called spherical triangles, but that term more <b>properly</b> refers to triangles on the curved surface of a sphere.|$|E

5|$|The {{death of}} an {{individual}} – signified by the tolling of the bell – is thus a treasure buried {{at the bottom of}} a mine: only of value if it is given to someone who makes good use of it. In this he refers to the work of Augustine of Hippo, specifically On Christian Doctrine, in which Augustine describes the knowledge of pagans as gold and silver: something that can be involved in Christian purposes if appropriated <b>properly.</b> Donne, twisting this idea, is arguing that the {{death of an}}y individual is something others can learn from, should they understand it <b>properly.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{doors of}} the two {{prototype}} trains were changed in 1999 as they were not working <b>properly.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{international}} {{version was}} imported by Bergsala AB into Scandinavian countries {{in small amounts}} and was re-titled Mr. Gimmick. It was released on 19 May 1993. Unlike its Japanese counterpart, this version features nine lives instead of four to counter the game's extreme difficulty. The game also contains downgraded music {{due to the lack}} of an expanded sound channel chip. Since the European cartridge is encoded for PAL region, the game will not work <b>properly</b> on a North American NTSC NES due to graphical glitches, but an identical NTSC prototype ROM has been leaked online which functions <b>properly.</b>|$|E

5|$|Wider {{management}} failings {{were found}} by the investigation to {{have contributed to the}} explosion: management safety checks at the site were found to be deficient and not <b>properly</b> followed. Site staff did not have control over the flow rates and timing of two of the three inlet sources, meaning {{that they did not have}} enough information to <b>properly</b> manage the storage of incoming fuel. Further, overall throughput had increased, reducing wait times further and shifting the emphasis to process operations instead of process safety.|$|E

Upon receiving the tidings of his rival's defeat and death at Alexandria, the new Emperor at once forwarded supplies of urgently needed grain to Rome, along with an edict or a declaration of policy, in which he gave assurance of an entire reversal of the laws of Nero, especially those relating to treason. In early 70, Vespasian was still in Egypt however, continuing to consolidate support from the Egyptians before departing. By the end 70, he finally returned to Rome, and was <b>properly</b> installed as Emperor.|$|E
5|$|Among the Romani people, mullo (literally {{one who is}} dead) are {{believed}} to return from the dead and cause malicious acts as well as drink human blood, most often that of a relative or {{the person who had}} caused their death. Other potential victims were those who did not <b>properly</b> observe the burial ceremonies or kept the deceased's possessions instead of <b>properly</b> destroying them. Female vampires could return, lead a normal life and even marry but would eventually exhaust the husband with their sexual appetite. Similar to other European beliefs, male vampires could father children, known as dhampirs, who could be hired to detect and get rid of vampires.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} {{of a large number of}} command {{officers}} being fired for failing to do their job <b>properly,</b> in 2012 the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) ordered a new method of selecting command officers across the Navy.|$|E

The engines {{had been prepared}} by Shelby but had not been <b>properly</b> developed, {{and as a result}} overheated; Shelby eventually refunded the development cost to Rootes. All three of the Le Mans Tigers have survived.|$|E

5|$|Damage to the {{trochlear nerve}} (IV) {{can also cause}} {{diplopia}} with the eye adducted and elevated. The result will be an eye which can not move downwards <b>properly</b> (especially downwards when in an inward position). This is due to impairment in the superior oblique muscle, which is innervated by the trochlear nerve.|$|E
5|$|During formal occasions, {{four people}} are {{required}} to <b>properly</b> fold the flag, where each person holds one of the sides. A correctly folded flag must be a square limiting the national shield. However, the order by which the different folding steps are performed to achieve this result is not legislated.|$|E
