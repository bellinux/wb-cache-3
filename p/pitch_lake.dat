500|$|Apart {{from these}} {{residential}} buildings, farms and their associated land, {{there was little}} else in the area now known as Southgate until Crawley Development Corporation started building the neighbourhood in the 1950s. [...] Some shops, a corn merchant's premises and a brewery were built near the level crossing in the late 19th century. [...] Crawley's first permanent cinema, the Imperial, was established nearby in 1911, replacing a temporary structure; it burnt down in 1928 but was rebuilt, only to be superseded by a larger building in the town centre in the 1930s. [...] It has been a car dealership since the 1940s. [...] Further down the Brighton Road, near the Hogs Hill Farm where Iron Age remains were later found, the Half Moon Inn and Hotel {{was built in the}} late 19th century, and rebuilt in 1890. [...] To the west, Goffs Park was established as a parkland and recreational area by the early 20th century.

6000|$|... {331a} This myth {{about the}} famous <b>Pitch</b> <b>Lake</b> of Trinidad was told almost {{word for word}} to a M.

60|$|This is {{the remnant}} {{of one of}} the many rash speculations {{connected}} with the <b>Pitch</b> <b>Lake.</b> At a depth of some two hundred and fifty feet 'oil was struck,' as the American saying is. But (so we were told) it would not rise in the boring, and had to be pumped up. It could not, therefore, compete in price with the Pennsylvanian oil, which, when tapped, springs out of the ground of itself, to a height sometimes of many feet, under the pressure of the superincumbent rocks, yielding enormous profits, and turning needy adventurers into millionaires, though full half of the oil is sometimes wasted for the want of means to secure it.|$|E
6000|$|He left {{somewhat}} too soon. For on the 22d of March Raleigh sailed into Cedros Bay, {{and then}} went up to La Brea and the <b>Pitch</b> <b>Lake.</b> [...] There he noted, as Columbus had done before him, oysters growing on the mangrove roots; and noted, too, 'that abundance of stone pitch, that all the ships of the world might be therewith laden from thence; and we made trial of it in trimming our shippes, to be most excellent good, and melteth not with the sun as the pitch of Norway.' From thence he ran up the west coast to 'the mountain of Annaparima' (St. Fernando hill), and passing {{the mouth of the}} Caroni, anchored at what was then the village of Port of Spain.|$|E

The design also placed the diving tanks above the waterline of the single, cylindrical hull, which necessitated a heavy ballast keel for vertical stability. This arrangement required mechanical pumping, a procedure that took 8 minutes. U-1s propulsion system consisted of two gasoline engines for surface running and two electric motors for running while submerged.|$|R
6000|$|We {{looked back}} at the foul place, and agreed that it is well for the human mind that the <b>Pitch</b> <b>Lake</b> was still unknown when Dante wrote that hideous poem of his--the opprobrium (as I hold) of the Middle Age. For if such were the dreams of its noblest and purest genius, what must have been the dreams of the ignoble and impure multitude? [...] But had he seen this lake, how easy, how tempting too, it would have been to him to embody in imagery the surmise of a certain 'Father,' and heighten the torments of the lost beings, sinking slowly into that black Bolge beneath the baking rays of the tropic sun, by the sight of the saved, walking where we walked, beneath cool {{fragrant}} shade, among the pillars of a temple to which the Parthenon is mean and small.|$|E
60|$|Its first discoverers, of course, {{were not}} bound {{to see that}} a <b>pitch</b> <b>lake</b> of ninety-nine acres was no more {{wonderful}} {{than any of the}} little pitch wells--'spues' or 'galls,' as we should call them in Hampshire--a yard across; or any one of the tiny veins and lumps of pitch which abound in the surrounding forests; and no less wonderful than if it had covered ninety-nine thousand acres instead of ninety- nine. Moreover, it was a novelty. People were not aware of the vast quantity of similar deposits which exist up and down the hotter regions of the globe. And being new and big too, its genesis demanded, for the comfort of the barbaric intellect, a cataclysm, and a convulsion, and some sort of prodigious birth, which was till lately referred, like many another strange object, to volcanic action. The explanation savoured somewhat of a 'bull'; for what a volcano could do to pitch, save to burn it up into coke and gases, it is difficult to see.|$|E
60|$|May {{not this}} strange {{formation}} of natural brick and china-ware be of immense age--humanly, not geologically, speaking? May {{it not be}} far older than the <b>Pitch</b> <b>Lake</b> above--older, possibly, than the formation of any asphalt at all? And may not the asphalt mingled with it have been squeezed into it and round it, as it is being squeezed into and through the unburnt strata at so many points in Guapo, La Brea, Oropuche, and San Fernando? At least, so it seemed to us, as {{we sat on the}} shore, waiting for the boat to take us round to La Brea, and drank in dreamily with our eyes the beauty of that strange lonely place. The only living things, save ourselves, which were visible were a few pelicans sleeping on a skerry, and a shoal of dolphins rolling silently in threes--husband, wife, and little child--as they fished their way along the tide mark between the yellow water and the green. The sky blazed overhead, the sea below; the red rocks and green forests blazed around; and we sat enjoying the genial silence, not of darkness, but of light, not of death, but of life, as the noble heat permeated every nerve, and made us feel young, and strong, and blithe once more.|$|E

5|$|The U-1-class design {{had several}} {{features}} typical of Lake's designs, including a diving chamber under {{the bow and}} two variable <b>pitch</b> propellers. <b>Lake's</b> design also called for two retractable wheels that, in theory, could allow travel over the seabed. The design also placed the diving tanks above the waterline of the single, cylindrical hull, which necessitated a heavy ballast keel for vertical stability. The propulsion system for the U-1 class consisted of two gasoline engines for surface running and two electric motors for running while submerged. For underwater steering and maneuverability, the design featured four pairs of diving planes.|$|R

6000|$|It now {{turns out}} that the <b>Pitch</b> <b>Lake,</b> like most other things, owes its {{appearance}} on the surface to no convulsion or vagary at all, but to a most slow, orderly, and respectable process of nature, by which buried vegetable matter, which would have become peat, and finally brown coal, in a temperate climate, becomes, under the hot tropic soil, asphalt and oil, continually oozing up beneath the pressure of the strata above it. Such, at least, is the opinion of Messrs. Wall and Sawkins, the geological surveyors of Trinidad, and of several chemists whom they quote; and I am bound to say, that all I saw at the lake and elsewhere, during two separate visits, can be easily explained on their hypothesis, and that no other possible cause suggests itself as yet. The same cause, it may be, has produced the submarine spring of petroleum, off the shore near Point Rouge, where men can at times skim the floating oil off the surface of the sea; the petroleum and asphalt of the Windward Islands and of Cuba, especially the well-known Barbadoes tar; and the petroleum springs of the mainland, described by Humboldt, at Truxillo, in the Gulf of Cumana; and 'the inexhaustible deposits of mineral pitch in the provinces of Merida and Coro, and, above all, in that of Maracaybo. [...] In the latter it is employed for caulking the ships which navigate the lake.' {145} But the reader shall hear what the famous lake is like, and judge for himself. Why not? He may not be 'scientific,' but, as Professor Huxley well says, what is scientific thought but common sense well regulated? ...|$|E
