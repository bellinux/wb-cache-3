40|$|The high {{failure rates}} of change {{initiatives}} threaten {{the sustainability of}} commercial printing operations. The focus of this qualitative multicase study was to research the strategies commercial <b>printing</b> <b>managers</b> use to succeed in gaining frontline employee buy-in during change initiatives to improve productivity and profitability in a manufacturing environment. The participants included four commercial <b>printing</b> <b>managers</b> from the Midwestern United States. Each manager had implemented successful change initiatives in the past 2 years and maintained profitability of the business for 12 months before the study. McGregor 2 ̆ 7 s (1960) Theory Y served {{as the basis for}} the conceptual framework. Data collection included semistructured face-to-face interviews with managers, a review of company documents, and observations. Descriptive coding and sequential review of the interview transcripts using a modified Van Kaam thematic data analysis process revealed five themes: (a) constructive communication, (b) leadership behaviors, (c) performance management, (d) employee management, and (e) employee motivation. Recommendations for action include further research on using constructive communication tactics and identifying stimuli of employee resistance to buy in to change initiatives. Commercial <b>printing</b> <b>managers</b> may apply these results to engage frontline employees in participating in the implementation of change initiatives that improve productivity and profitability. Implications for social change include the increased potential of improving the success of commercial <b>printing</b> <b>managers</b> in implementing change initiatives that positively impact employment and economic health within communities...|$|R
50|$|Pinpin {{started working}} as an {{apprentice}} at the printing press in Abucay in 1609. The printing press was run by the Dominicans, and Father Blancas employed young Pinpin and taught him the printing techniques of the time. In just one year he had developed enough skills to be promoted to <b>printing</b> <b>manager.</b>|$|R
50|$|Starting with Red Hat Linux 9, Red Hat {{provided}} an integrated <b>print</b> <b>manager</b> based on CUPS and integrated into GNOME. This allowed adding printers via a user interface {{similar to the}} one Microsoft Windows uses, where a new printer could be added using an add new printer wizard, along with changing default printer-properties in a window containing a list of installed printers. Jobs could also be started and stopped using a <b>print</b> <b>manager</b> and the printer could be paused using a context menu that pops up when the printer icon is right-clicked.|$|E
50|$|The <b>print</b> <b>manager</b> program TurboPrint, by German firm IrseeSoft, is the {{de facto}} {{standard}} for advanced printing on the Amiga. It is a modular program with many drivers which support many modern printers. PrintStudio Professional I and II are another well known printer driver system for the Amiga.|$|E
50|$|Far's {{standard}} functionality can {{be greatly}} extended with macros (written in Lua scripting language, primarily used to record keypress sequences) and plugins. Standard plugins installed by default include FTP, Windows network, extensible archive file support and temporary panel (sandbox) virtual file systems, a process list, <b>print</b> <b>manager,</b> filename case converter, and several editor plugins to format, wrap, and otherwise alter text.|$|E
50|$|Xubuntu 8.04 Long Term Support (LTS) {{was made}} {{available}} on 24 April 2008. This version of Xubuntu used Xfce 4.4.2, Xorg 7.3 and Linux kernel 2.6.24. It introduced PolicyKit for permissions control, PulseAudio {{and a new}} <b>printing</b> <b>manager.</b> It also introduced Wubi, that allowed Windows users to install Xubuntu as a program on Windows.|$|R
50|$|QuickDraw GX was a {{replacement}} for the QuickDraw (QD) 2D graphics engine and <b>Printing</b> <b>Manager</b> inside the classic Mac OS. Its underlying drawing platform was a resolution-independent object oriented retained mode system, making it much easier for programmers to perform common tasks (compared to the original QuickDraw). Additionally, GX added various curve-drawing commands that had been lacking from QD, as well as introducing TrueType as its basic font system.|$|R

50|$|Eric Raymond criticised {{this system}} in his piece The Luxury of Ignorance. Raymond had {{attempted}} to install CUPS using the Fedora Core 1 <b>print</b> <b>manager</b> but found it non-intuitive; he criticised the interface designers for not designing with the user's point-of-view in mind. He found the idea of printer queues was not obvious because users create queues on their local computer but these queues are actually created on the CUPS server.|$|E
50|$|Icons {{could be}} dragged and dropped {{for the first}} time, in {{addition}} to having a more detailed appearance. A file could be dragged onto the <b>Print</b> <b>Manager</b> icon and the file would be printed by the current printer, assuming it was associated with an application capable of printing, such as a word processor. Alternatively, the file could be dragged out of File Manager and dropped onto an application icon or window for processing.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In their {{everyday}} work people {{are confronted with}} ever growing amounts of information and thus often feel overloaded with data. Trails, built from information about the users ’ browsing paths and activities, are an established approach to assist users in navigating vast information spaces and finding appropriate information. While existing systems focus on web browsers only, we argue that trails can be generated by any application. We describe TrailTRECer, a framework which supports trail-based information access, and which is open to any application. The usability of the framework {{and the concept of}} user trails were tested by building a trail-enabled browser client and a <b>print</b> <b>manager</b> client. Initial user evaluations indicate the usefulness of this approach. ...|$|E
5000|$|The Legibility Group typefaces were {{extremely}} popular and remained {{used by many}} newspapers worldwide throughout the metal type period and beyond; many other newspaper typefaces such as Intertype Imperial were created based on their design. (Monotype's Times New Roman is an exception, as it was created for the unusually high standard of printing of the Times in the 1930s, although its bold is more similar to the Legibility Group style.) In 1972, British <b>printing</b> <b>manager</b> Allen Hutt commented that [...] "the majority of the world's newspapers are typeset in {{one or another of}} the traditional Linotype 'Legibility Group', and most of the rest in their derivatives." ...|$|R

5000|$|Motteler and Germany {{were finally}} {{able to return to}} Germany in 1901. Thanks to their {{enforced}} absence they had been unable to play {{a leading role in the}} SPD's formative decade. Motteler was accompanied by more Social Democratic documentation, and he also organised the repatriation of all the archived documents from the Marx-Engels of which he had been given charge following the death, in exile in London in August 1895, of Friedrich Engels. [...] On returning to Germany Motteler immediately returned to the newspaper business, becoming the <b>printing</b> <b>manager</b> and publishing director of the Leipziger Volkszeitung (newspaper). [...] In the 1903 General Election he won a Leipzig seats for the Social Democrats, and he sat in the Reichstag till 1907. He died a few months after the 1907 election, having remained active as a social democratic activist and newspaper manager almost to the end.|$|R

This program is especially used at the land office as well as at the project offices, is regularly updated, has sufficient technical support and the form. dgn is commonly known. With regard to the fact, that the evidence of real estate register operates with a form. vfk, I would strongly recommend to use the program POZEM, because the programs Topol and UR-Roupec are not able to automatically convert any data in the form. vfk...|$|R
40|$|The {{printing}} industry in Sub-Sahara Africa faces numerous problems inhibiting further growth and development. Because of {{a scarcity of}} published information regarding these problems, and regarding {{the nature of the}} industry in general, this study hoped to establish a beginning and baseline for researchers, <b>printing</b> <b>managers,</b> suppliers, development planners, and anyone else interested {{in the development of the}} African {{printing industry}}. Specifically, the objectives of this study were to identify: 1) the general characteristics of the printing industry in Sub-Sahara Africa; and 2) the primary constraints inhibiting its further growth and development. Information was gathered by several means, including a search of the literature, interviews, and a survey of manufacturers. General economic data was also gathered and statistically analyzed by country cluster and factor analyzes. Further, the industry is examined in terms of international technology transfer research findings. The study showed that the printing industry in Sub-Sahara Africa is characterized by the following generalizations: A wide range of diversity in technological sophistication from one country to another; rapid technological change; a scarcity of local sources of printing equipment and supplies; a generally low level of printing quality; predominantly single color printing; a relatively high cost for raw materials; high tariffs on industry inputs; a scarcity and low level of technical skills; poor management; a generally rudimentary level of technology; considerable infrastructure problems; small and underdeveloped markets; poor environmental control; poor printer/publisher relations; and a scarcity of training and educational institutions for the graphic arts. Recommendations to participants and recommendations for further research are presented...|$|R
40|$|In {{spite of}} its {{advantages}} over manual estimating methods, computer assisted estimating (CAE) lacks acceptance in the printing industry today. Possible reasons for non-acceptance are: 1) the cost of CAE, 2) CAE 2 ̆ 7 s lack of versatility, 3) <b>printing</b> <b>manager</b> 2 ̆ 7 s lack of knowledge {{on the subject of}} CAE and/or computers in general, and 4) the small size {{of the majority of the}} printing companies does not warrant the use of CAE. A survey questionnaire was designed for the purpose of finding out how printing companies feel about CAE, and if the reasons listed above are, in fact, major influences on their decision not to use CAE. The responses of the survey were analyzed by use of the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS). There were 312 survey responses used in data analysis. From this data, it was concluded that the major reason for CAE rejection among the responding population is the cost of CAE. The factor of company size must be considered also when stating this conclusion, since 55 percent of the printing companies responding employ between one and twenty-five people. In the overall population, when the number of employees in printing companies increases, so does CAE usage, which indicates the size of the company is an important factor towards CAE acceptance among the respondents to the survey. The major factor influencing the acceptance of CAE in the form of a problem with CAE itself (and not the printing company) is CAE 2 ̆ 7 s lack of program versatility. The author feels that this problem will be overcome in the near future with improved customized and semi-customized system programming...|$|R

40|$|The {{exhibition}} {{was held in}} the Rare Books Exhibition space, Sir Louis Matheson Library, Monash University from 26 June - 30 september 2014. Opening address given by Des Cowley, Rare <b>Printed</b> Collections <b>Manager,</b> State Library of Victoria. This exhibition of dust jackets in the Rare Books Collection shows how these covers have changed from being a simple cover for protection to the main vehicle for advertising a book. From the Edwardian period onwards publishers began to lavish their design effort on the jacket rather than the book cover and we see jacket design start to reflect trends in commercial art. This exhibition includes dust jackets from 1860 to the recent deluxe limited edition Penguin Designer Classics series, and those designed by well-known artists and engravers Salvador Dali, Edward Bawden, John Farleigh, Robert Gibbings, Barnett Freedman, Eric Gill, E. McKnight Kauffer, Sidney Nolan and many more. </p...|$|R
50|$|The art {{collection}} {{remained at the}} Matthews Library building, renamed Matthews Center. Contributions from donors expanded the museum's collections, particularly of prints and American crafts. In 1977, the museum received a National Endowment for the Arts matching grant to purchase of contemporary American ceramics. By 1978, the museum occupied the entire {{second floor of the}} Matthews Center, with some 10,000 sq ft of exhibition space. In April 1989, the ASU Art Museum moved into the newly completed Nelson Fine Arts Center, designed by architect Antoine Predock, where the museum remains today.
