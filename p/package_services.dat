40|$|In retail stores, {{consumers}} are frequently offered choices between {{large and small}} packages of products. Previous literature characterizes choices between large and small packages primarily {{as a means for}} manufacturers to practice price discrimination.

In this paper, we examine consumers’ willingness to pay more for the <b>services</b> provided by <b>packaging,</b> {{and the degree to which}} this changes their susceptibility to price discrimination. We conduct a series of studies in which consumers make choices among alternatives with different package characteristics, brands, and prices, holding constant the purchase quantity. We find evidence that {{consumers are}} willing to pay for <b>packaging</b> <b>services,</b> and that their willingness to pay for these services varies across product categories. Our results suggest that in product categories for which freshness is a concern, <b>packaging</b> <b>services</b> may be underutilized as positioning attributes. We also find evidence that consumers are willing to pay more for <b>packaging</b> <b>services</b> provided by name brands than for store brands, suggesting that name brands can increase their profits by offering <b>packaging</b> <b>services...</b>|$|R

40|$|Research in {{the area}} of <b>packaged</b> tour <b>services,</b> {{provided}} by the national and foreign tour operators has concentrated on mutual relationships among tourist-perceived service quality, satisfaction and repurchase intentions. However, little research in this domain has been done to explain the impact of repurchase intentions of experienced tourists on the relation between perceived quality of service and their satisfaction. This model was tested using substantial data set of experienced tourists with time span of three years. While previous literature has suggested that quality perceptions impose direct effect on tourist satisfaction, this study shows that such effect is more powerful when mediated by repurchase intentions of experienced tourists.

40|$|Abstract—For {{a service}} {{to be used in}} a {{commercial}} setting, certain service delivery functions such as monitoring, billing, authentication, etc need to be <b>packaged</b> with the <b>service.</b> Because of the growing number of available services and the diversity in their offerings, predefined service delivery functions like that offered by existing service brokers (e. g. StrikeIron or Salesforce) cannot be easily adapted and plugged in with the core service from a third party provider. The need is to have a lightweight <b>service</b> <b>packaging</b> platform that offers service providers the ability to create reusable <b>service</b> <b>packages</b> by assembling existing service delivery functions or creating new ones. In this paper we introduce the notion of <b>service</b> <b>packages</b> and a pattern-based approach to <b>service</b> <b>packaging.</b> We highlight what is required from a platform to have such <b>service</b> <b>packaging</b> capabilities, and detail a prototype platform that we have developed to meet these requirements.
