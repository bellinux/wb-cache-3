40|$|The Antarctic Muon and Neutrino Detection Array (AMANDA) project {{initially}} required placing 10 -inch spheres in holes 1000 m deep at the South Pole. Drilling began {{during the}} 2 ̆ 793 - 2 ̆ 794 field season using a hot-water drill {{because it was}} the best method capable of drilling holes that were plumb within 0. 1 degrees. This type of drill is also modular allowing for expansion to <b>provide</b> <b>more</b> <b>heat</b> if necessary without constructing an entirely new drill. Discovery of bubbles in the ice at 1000 m required expansion of drilling capability to drill holes 2000 m deep to accommodate 13 -inch spheres.

The successful AMANDA drilling experiences and the analysis of the data returned from the AMANDA spheres has led to the IceCube project proposal. This project will require drilling 80 ∿ 60 -cm diameter holes to 2400 m.

The annual mean surface temperature has risen about 0. 5 - 0. 8 degrees C. The precipitation trends have not been identified during the past 100 years in China, although the frequency and intensity of extreme weather/climate events have increased, especially of drought. Water scarcity, more frequent and serious outbreaks of insects and diseases, and soil degradation caused by climate change have impacted agro-environmental conditions. However, temperature rise prolonged the crop growth seasons and cold damages have reduced in Northeast China. The projection of climate change indicates that the surface temperature {{will continue to increase}} with about 3. 9 to 6. 0 degrees C and precipitation is expected to increase by 9 to 11 % at the end of 21 st century in China. Climate warming will <b>provide</b> <b>more</b> <b>heat</b> and as a consequence, the boundary of the triple- cropping system (TCS) will extend northwards by as much as 200 to 300 km, from the Yangtze River Valley to the Yellow River Basin, and the current double-cropping system (DCS) will move to the central part of China, into the current single cropping system (SCS) area which will decrease in SCS surface area of 23. 1 % by 2050. Climate warming will also affect the optimum location for the cultivation of China's main crop varieties. If no measures are taken to adapt to climate changes, compared with the potential yield in 1961 - 1990, yields of irrigated wheat, corn and rice are projected to decrease by 2. 2 - 6. 7 %, 0. 4 %- 11. 9 % and 4. 3 - 12. 4 % respectively in the 2050 s. Climate warming will enhance potential evaporation and reduce the availability of soil moisture, thus causing a greater need for agricultural irrigation, intensifying the conflict between water supply and demand especially in arid and semi-arid areas of China. With adequate irrigation, the extent of the reduction in yield of China's corn and wheat can be improved by 5 % to 15 %, and rice by 5 % or so than the potential yield in 1961 - 1990. Adaptive measures can reduce the agricultural loss under climate change.

50|$|Molds (or tooling) {{are either}} {{fabricated}} from welded sheet steel or cast. The fabrication method is often driven by part size and complexity; most intricate parts are likely {{made out of}} cast tooling. Molds are typically manufactured from stainless steel or aluminum. Aluminum molds are usually much thicker than an equivalent steel mold, {{as it is a}} softer metal. This thickness does not affect cycle times significantly since aluminum's thermal conductivity is many times greater than steel. Due to the need to develop a model prior to casting, cast molds tend to have additional costs associated with the manufacturing of the tooling, whereas fabricated steel or aluminum molds, particularly when used for less complex parts, are less expensive. However, some molds contain both aluminum and steel. This allows for variable thicknesses in the walls of the product. While this process is not as precise as injection molding, it does provide the designer with more options. The aluminum addition to the steel <b>provides</b> <b>more</b> <b>heat</b> capacity, causing the melt-flow to stay in a fluid state for a longer period.|$|R

The chiller was designed for hot environments and could only achieve a coefficient of performance (COP) of 1. 0 using an air-cooled condenser. In this work, the condenser was modified to have circulating water absorb heat, which was then cooled in membrane modules by evaporation across a hydrophobic membrane into an air stream. Steady-state operation of the chiller was achieved with the SGME system. Increasing either air flow or water circulation rate increased the COP of the chiller, which reached a value of 1. 83 with an optimal heat load of 435 W.

The most efficient AOGCMs are chosen by comparison between the 1970 - 1999 outputs of the Climate of the twentieth Century experiment (20 C 3 M) and reanalyses (ECMWF, NCEP/NCAR).

The shape-memory {{elements in the}} form of spirals characterized by two-way action were made of nitinol (NiTi) one-way wires with the inner state transition temperature of 35 C. The fabric prototype developed was made of three layers of nonwovens manufactured from the blends of flax and steel fibers and the two interlayers included spirals, made from NiTi or a reference copper (Cu) wire. The inner layer (heater) was heated by electrical current. The external prototype layers imitated the fabric. Mirrors and an infrared camera were used to measure the thermal properties. The tempera-ture of the external surfaces was analyzed as a function of heating time. At approximately 35 C, a change in the curve of the dependence of temperature on the heating time of the prototype with NiTi elements could be observed; the rate of the temperature increase began to decrease. The width of the interlayer with air and NiTi elements increases by approximately 2. 5 mm during heating. The observed phenomenon is caused by the expansion of the NiTi spirals and did not occur with the prototype composed of non-active reference Cu elements.
