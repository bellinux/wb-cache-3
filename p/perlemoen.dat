40|$|The {{biotechnology}} {{of production}} and utilisation of the cyanobacterium Spirulina has been well documented. Research has centred mainly on application in human and animal nutrition, and has been motivated by the high protein, vitamin, fatty acid and growth factor contents. The main obstacle in realising the full potential of this feed source has been the high production costs associated with its mass culture in defined media. The observation of blooms of Spirulina in tannery effluent evaporation ponds in Wellington, South Africa, prompted this investigation into the harvesting, and nutritional and toxicological evaluation of this potentially low-cost production system, with the ultimate aim of using the product in aquaculture rations. An investigation of the chemical gradient along the evaporation cascade showed {{a positive correlation between}} the prevailing chemical conditions and the dominant species populations. A standing crop of 9. 5 tonnes/ha of Spirulina was found to be present in the latter alkaline ponds, characterised by relatively lower organic and sulphur contents. Initial harvesting of the biomass was achieved by the design, construction and implementation of a small-scale screen harvest, which yielded a 25 kg (dry weight) crop. A scale-up model was then designed, and implemented in a technical scale harvest, yielding a crop of 250 kg (dry weight). Both these harvests utilised the bloom of surface-autoflocculated biomass. Concentrated cell slurries were sun-dried on muslin beds, and milled to a coarse powder. An evaluation of the harvest revealed a chemical content similar to other published reports of defined media cultures, {{with the exception of the}} protein and amino acid contents. The observed lower levels of the latter two are almost certainly due to the sun-drying method employed, known to reduce the protein content due to thermal denaturation. Legislation demands the strict toxicological evaluation of new protein sources, and because of the effluent-nature of the growth medium of this source of Spirulina, its viability lies only in the application as an animal feed or supplement. A range of toxicological tests were chosen that were targeted to elucidate the possible toxicological constraints of this effluentgrown source of protein in animal nutrition. The nucleic acid and pesticide contents of the harvested biomass were within the prescribed safety ranges. Atomic absorption showed minimal accumulation of minerals and heavy metals from the effluent. A bioassay with the brine shrimp Anemia salina showed that the biomass contained no toxicologically active water-soluble components. A short term feeding trial with new-born chicks showed that supplementation with Spirulina had no effect on the growth rates and feed conversion ratios of the different feeding groups. Pathological analyses showed that the liver was the only target organ to elicit a change in response to supplementation of the diets with Spirulina. A general decrease in liver weight was noted, with Cu, Ca, Fe and Zn being significantly accumulated. A histopathological examination however, showed no cellular and functional aberration from the control animals. The toxicological analyses gave the preliminary safe go-ahead for the evaluation of effluent-grown Spirulina in aquaculture nutrition. The South African abalone Haliotis midae, and the rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss were chosen as representative species of edible cultured organisms. The technology for the culture of the <b>perlemoen</b> abalone is being established in South Africa, with the main area of research being the development of an artificial diet for high density culture. A 40 day growth trial demonstrated that lower concentrations of Spirulina supplemented to an agar-based fishmeal diet resulted in growth rates and feed conversion ratios similar to the control fishmeal and purified-casein diets, and thus has application potential in the nutrition of this high-cost marine delicacy. The aquaculture technology of freshwater rainbow trout is already well established. An eight week feeding trial with various concentrations of Spirulina showed that this effluent-grown protein source can partially replace fishmeal in semi-purified diets. Fish fed Spirulina did not exhibit decisive manifestations of toxicity, as determined in a histopathological study. In addition, Spirulina supplementation resulted in enhanced colouration of the skin and flesh, which may have implications in the aesthetic marketing of this sought-after table fish. The primary aim of this preliminary investigation thus concerned the determination of the biotechnological potential of this effluent-source of Spirulina. A technology transfer from the economically unfeasible defined-media culture was implemented. This project is ultimately aimed as a contribution towards the treatment of tannery wastewater, by the removal of contaminants from the effluent in the form of organic biomass. ...|$|E
40|$|The largest abalone in South Africa, the <b>perlemoen,</b> Haliotis midae, occurs along {{approximately}} {{two-thirds of}} the country's coastline, but has only {{been the target of}} an extensive commercial fishery in the south-western part of South Africa. Large-scale illegal fishing has however proliferated throughout its entire range over the last 10 – 15 years, which has had serious effects on stock abundance and once productive populations are facing economic collapse. Abalone stock enhancement has been put forward as an addition or alternative to traditional fisheries management practices, which can potentially rehabilitate overfished abalone populations and enhance natural production. The aim of this project was to investigate the potential of abalone stock enhancement for managing an area in the Eastern Cape Province, which was being subjected to intense illegal fishing pressure. A research approach was adopted to investigate the scale and effects of this poaching and to investigate the survival of artificially cultured abalone seed in the natural environment. A model of a commercial-scale ranching operation was investigated to assess the economic feasibility of such a scheme. Analysis of poaching cases and research samples from Cape Recife indicated high levels of fishing effort that appeared to be causing the observed declines in emergent abalone abundance and average size. Poaching cases from Cape Recife contributed 32 % {{of the total number of}} cases of known origin in the Eastern Cape Province from 1998 – 2002, with the majority of the cases (82 %) originating from within the Port Elizabeth metropole. There was an exponential increase in the number of poaching cases in the Eastern Cape Province (r²= 0. 967) and Port Elizabeth over this period but actual annual total catch stabilized, particularly at Cape Recife, where estimates of CPUE declined significantly from 2000 – 2002 (p 85 % in confiscations and research collections, and did not change significantly over the period of examination. Comparison of illegal catches with an adjacent site indicated that the emergent abalone population at Cape Recife had a significantly higher proportion of undersized emergent animals (p< 0. 001) and they were significantly smaller than the abalone from the closest site, Noordhoek, and other areas in Port Elizabeth from 2000 – 2002 (p< 0. 001). The apparent declines in emergent abalone abundance indicated by the poaching data were corroborated by sampling of emergent abalone abundance at Cape Recife. Numbers of abalone declined significantly from 125. 6 to 53. 8 per 20 min count (p< 0. 001), from April 1998 –October 2001 and density declined from 1. 3 to 0. 8 m⁻² over a similar period (p< 0. 001). Juvenile density did not change over this period, although there were significant differences in density observed between two different habitats (p< 0. 001). Initial releases of cultured juvenile abalone showed that they could be distinguished from their wild counterparts for at least a year after release, by their different shell colouration. Short-term, small-scale trials (7 – 10 days) using animals between 17 and 30 mm SL had mean survival rates of 64 – 82 % (mean 70. 4 %) and the effect of size on survival was not significant in most cases, although the power to detect differences was low. Attempts to measure the effect of habitat on survival were not conclusive, although refuges under sea urchins appeared to be favoured by both seed and wild abalone, although urchins were not an absolute requirement for survival. Similar medium-term trials (31 – 74 days) in sheltered sites yielded mean returns of 53. 1 % using 25 mm SL animals and similar trials in a more exposed area had more variable survival rates of between 18. 4 and 73. 6 %, after 25 – 27 days. A comparison between careful hand-seeding and surface-scattering seed release methods in the open-ocean habitat showed no significant differences in survival rate after 41 days. Larger seed survived significantly better than the smaller seed when scattered on the surface (p< 0. 0001) and the smaller seed survived significantly better when seeded carefully by hand onto the substrate (p< 0. 028). Further medium-term releases of large numbers of seed abalone, released using the surface-scattering method in open-ocean habitat, gave mean survival rates of 32. 8 % over periods of 83 – 114 days. Assessment of a seeding trial using release modules to seed juvenile animals in the open-ocean was hampered by poor sea conditions and difficult to search substrates, and a mean recovery rate of 3. 1 % was obtained for the sites that were sampled. Movement of seed was low in the more sheltered sites, and also appeared to be affected by the amount of available habitat. Growth of seed was measured using changes in shell colouration and there were significant differences between areas. An average growth of 1. 6 mm. month⁻¹ shell length was calculated for all areas. The potential for commercial scale abalone ranching to be used to enhance a territorial user right fishery was investigated using a model of economic feasibility. Internal rates of return of 30. 3 and 36. 9 % were obtained from two harvest regimes using different harvest sizes. There was a high degree of risk associated with these figures owing to a lack of consistent seed survival rate estimates, and the input parameters, which are subject to variation, showed a significant effect on profitability. The operation of this type of ranching scheme is probably not economically feasible as a stand-alone operation but could probably be operated effectively in conjunction with an existing abalone farm. By adding a small wild catch component the profitability of a ranching scheme could be significantly improved. The results of the present study indicate that high levels of poaching at Cape Recife have led to declines in emergent abalone abundance, which will probably lead to stock collapse in the near future. This implies that fisheries managers have failed to fulfil the provisions of fisheries policy in South Africa. The present results from seeding trials show that cultured juveniles can survive and make a contribution to overall stock abundance. Furthermore, while there are obstacles to economic feasibility, commercial ranching has the potential to be a valuable addition to current abalone management strategy...|$|E
40|$|Global {{growth in}} aquaculture, {{referred}} to as the blue revolution, is seen {{by many to be the}} solution to future food scarcity. However, this growth has been accompanied by disease emergence. Disease emergence is inevitable when host populations are concentrated and densities exceed the threshold value for occurrence of outbreaks. Abalone farming is a relatively recent development and diseases of abalone are not well characterised. There have been relatively few systematic surveys of abalone diseases in the world. Much of the available information resulted from investigations of specific disease outbreaks, such as withering syndrome in California. The outstanding example of a formal survey of abalone health was conducted in Australia. A methodical survey of abalone health, encompassing all farms and including wild abalone, has never been done in South Africa. However, South Africa has for many years had a herd health program for abalone producers and this has generated the largest body of data on abalone disease occurrence in the world. Although these data have some shortcomings, it was felt that analysis could provide insights into the epidemiology of parasites in farmed Haliotis midae, as well as informing better surveillance techniques for the future. Data for abalone submitted from nine farms as part of the herd health management program during the period 1 January 2000 to 31 December 2004 were analysed. No wild abalone were included in these data and the only abalone species considered was the South African abalone or <b>perlemoen,</b> Haliotis midae. Data on the age of the abalone and their diet were obtained from the farms. The abalone originated from either flow through or recirculation systems. Each animal was weighed and measured at the laboratory. A standard set of tissue sections was fixed and processed for histology. Presence of parasites was recorded, as well as the sex and degree of gonad development. Once data had been captured in Excel, a series of tables was constructed from counts of infected and non infected abalone for all host and environmental factors contained in the data set. Charts of the tables were drawn. Where host and environmental factors appeared to interact, these data were also tabulated and charted. Statistical analyses of the data in Excel followed. All analyses were performed for sessile ciliates, renal coccidia, gut protozoa, digestive gland PAGE 2 OF 137 protozoa and rickettsia like prokaryotes. The rarity of trematode infections made meaningful analyses difficult. The chi square test, effect sizes and odds ratios were used to seek significant associations. When confounding and interaction were suspected, stratum specific odds ratios were calculated. The summary odds ratio used in this study was the Mantel Haenszel summary odds ratio. The Breslow Day test for interaction was performed when necessary. Confidence intervals were determined using the method of Woolf. The overall prevalence of the various parasites was very variable. Sessile ciliates were the most common, with a prevalence of 68. 3 %. Rickettsia like prokaryotes were found in 13. 1 % of animals. The other gut associated parasites were more scarce, with prevalences under five percent. Renal coccidia affected less than two percent of animals. Trematode infections were extremely rare, at a prevalence of 0. 05 %. The results of the chi square test showed a significant association between age and parasite prevalence for all parasites tested. Odds ratios were calculated comparing animals of 24 months and younger to those older than 24 months. In all cases, except trematode and left kidney coccidian infections, risk of parasite infection tended to increase with increasing age. For left kidney coccidian infections, risk of infection decreased with increasing age. Trends for body mass were similar to those for age, which is expected, as animals generally become larger with increasing age. A significant association between growth rate and parasite prevalence existed for some parasites. The chi square test showed a significant association between condition index and parasite prevalence for all parasites tested. A significant association between sex and parasite prevalence was found for all parasites tested. A significant association also existed between parasite prevalence and gonad development for sessile ciliates, renal coccidia and gut protozoa. There were significant differences in parasite prevalences between farms for all parasites tested. The South and West coasts were next compared using the chi square test. There were significant differences in parasite prevalences between coasts for only three of the parasites tested, namely renal coccidia, gut protozoa and rickettsia. Crude odds ratios showed that, with the exception of left kidney coccidia and trematodes, there was a greater risk of parasite infection on the West than the South coast. For left kidney coccidia, the risk was greater on the PAGE 3 OF 137 South coast. A chi square test was performed to examine the relationship between parasite prevalence in Hermanus and other areas. A significant difference was found for renal coccidia and gut associated parasites. The crude odds ratios for parasite prevalence in other areas compared to Hermanus were calculated. With the exception of sessile ciliates and trematodes, there was a greater risk of parasite infection in areas other than Hermanus. In the case of sessile ciliates, there was a greater risk within Hermanus than in other areas. Unfortunately, it was almost impossible to determine whether a seasonal effect exists for parasite prevalence from the available data. This was shown to be partly due to the effect of prevalence on individual farms. Significant differences in parasite prevalences between diets for all parasites tested were shown using the chi square test. To further test the strength of the association, odds ratios were calculated comparing only kelp and artificial feed. For right kidney coccidia and gut associated parasites, the odds ratios indicated a significantly increased risk of infection in animals receiving kelp compared to those on artificial feed. There was no difference in risk for sessile ciliates and left kidney coccidia. The majority of animals originated in flow through systems. The chi square test showed significant differences in parasite prevalences between systems for sessile ciliates, renal coccidia and rickettsia like prokaryotes. Odds ratios showed a significantly greater risk of sessile ciliate infections, but a smaller risk of left kidney coccidia, in animals in flow through systems when comparing only kelp fed animals. Age is likely to lead to increased prevalences if the risk of infection is constant over time and also if infections are retained. Physiological changes in the animals may also affect their risk of infection. A further important aspect of age in abalone relates to changes in husbandry. Increasing age may be the underlying reason for some of the prevalence patterns seen with mass and sex. The origin of the sample population was considered in terms of farm of origin as well as geographic area. Abalone production in the study area was highly concentrated, with approximately two thirds coming from six farms situated within ten kilometres of each another on the South coast and almost forty percent from Hermanus alone. The present study found no PAGE 4 OF 137 evidence of increased parasite prevalence in areas where abalone farming is concentrated. It was felt that this study could not generate much insight into seasonal occurrence, due to uneven distribution of variables between months. The relationship between diet and parasite prevalence was perhaps the most interesting aspect of this study and possible reasons for the association are explored. Lastly, the results indicated that parasite buildup in recirculation systems was not as problematical as may be expected. It is possible that the increased prevalence of left kidney coccidia in recirculation systems is linked to the resistance of the host population rather than to the dynamics of the actual system. The very low prevalence of sessile ciliates in recirculation systems could not be explained by examination of any other variable considered in this study. Overall, the prevalences of soft tissue parasites in Haliotis midae compared favourably with those found for parasites of other abalone species abroad. Measures which would tend to reduce parasite prevalence include separation of age groups and maintaining a relatively young population on the farm. Culling of underperforming animals is recommended. Kelp should not be used in animals of two years or younger. In older animals, there was still a greater risk associated with kelp than with artificial feed, but it was not as marked. Recirculation systems proved to be less associated with increased parasite prevalence than one may expect. The other major findings of this study did not lend themselves to practical application.

40|$|Thesis (MScEng) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2012. ENGLISH ABSTRACT: Nearly all South African abalone farms {{function}} on {{an intensive}} pump-ashore, flow-through system. Large volumes of sea water that are pumped ashore flow through abalone or kelp harvesting tanks and finally gravitate {{back to the}} ocean. If the effluent from an abalone farm can be desalinated without permanent membrane fouling, then sea water reverse osmosis (SWRO) technology can be integrated effectively with established abalone farms without having to increase the farms’ intake system capacities. Without the need to construct and maintain an intake system, the overall cost of desalination can be reduced. Therefore, {{the aim of this}} study was to determine the feasibility and viability of integrating a SWRO desalination plant with a typical South African abalone farm. The project focused on four areas of concern, namely: - characterisation of typical South African abalone farm water - SWRO desalination plant pilot study and membrane fouling behaviour - general operation of a typical abalone farm and its implications for desalination - cost estimates and implications for the integration of an SWRO desalination plant with an abalone farm During a nine-month on-site investigation, sea water turbidity was reduced by up to 43 % from a mean value of 0. 82 NTU in the influent stream to 0. 47 NTU in the combined effluent stream from the abalone tanks. Even with spikes in the influent turbidity, the turbidity of the combined effluent from all abalone tanks (excluding tank flush water) remained below 1 NTU. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in both the influent and combined effluent remained below 1 mg/litre. Ultrafiltration (UF) was selected as pre-treatment to the reverse osmosis (RO) in order to minimise potential fouling of the RO membranes. Membrane compaction of both the UF and RO membranes contributed significantly to initial flux losses – as much as 18 % for the polyethersulfone (PESM) UF membranes and 20 % for the thin film composite (TFC) polyamide RO membrane. However, this is comfortably in line with typical compaction values quoted in the literature. Without pre-flocculation, the UF was able to operate at a specific flux between 45 and 55 litre/m 2 /h (LMH) and recoveries ranging between 60 and 75 %. Corresponding trans-membrane pressure (TMP) ranged between 0. 59 and 0. 76 bar. With ferric chloride pre-flocculation at a concentration of 3 mg/litre (as Fe 3 +) the UF could be operated at notably lower TMP values between 0. 11 and 0. 36 bar. These results indicate that provision should definitely be made for pre-flocculation when using UF as pre-treatment, despite the fact that the DOC concentrations and turbidity of the abalone farm effluent are quite low (DOC < 1 mg/litre, NTU < 1). It furthermore highlights the inability of DOC and turbidity alone to predict the membrane fouling potential of water. A better indicator of membrane fouling potential, albeit not perfect, is the modified fouling index (MFI 0. 45). This index follows a linear trend with foulant concentration and serves as a good indicator of the filterability of water. On-site measurements showed an increase in mean MFI 0. 45 values from 29 s/litre 2 for the influent to 48 s/litre 2 for the effluent from the abalone tanks, thereby confirming the need for pre-flocculation as part of UF pre-treatment. Chemically enhanced backwashing (CEB) of the UF membrane at least every 24 hours was found to be essential for its stable operation. Therefore, UF with pre-flocculation (3 mg/litre Fe 3 +) and regular CEB can be used effectively as pre-treatment method for the desalination of abalone farm effluent water. An RO ‘feed-and-bleed’ system was used to simulate the typical performance of the last membrane in a full-scale RO membrane bank. This RO membrane performed well with no signs of extreme fouling. The membrane produced a good quality permeate – for the last membrane in a membrane bank – reducing the TDS of the RO feed from 33 493 mg/litre to 969 mg/litre. These results compared well with simulated values by Reverse Osmosis System Analysis (ROSA; an RO simulator by DOW), indicating a TDS reduction from 33 271 mg/litre to 1 409 mg/litre at a feed pressure of 56 bar, and overall recovery of 44 %. A steady performance of the RO membrane during the pilot study indicated that it is possible to desalinate abalone effluent water without notable permanent membrane fouling. A stable normalised flux rate of 8 LMH was achieved and RO membrane integrity remained intact with a salt rejection that ranged from 98. 0 to 98. 5 %. No sudden reduction in permeate flux was observed as a result of fouling by unknown constituents present in the UF permeate. DBNPA (a non-oxidising disinfectant) was dosed once per week at a concentration of 10 – 30 mg/litre for 30 minutes. Scaling was controlled effectively by means of an antiscalant dosed at a concentration of 11 – 12 mg/litre in the feed stream. The CIP frequency was not optimised but a CIP frequency of once every 6 – 8 weeks appeared to be more than adequate to prevent permanent membrane fouling Advantages of integrating an SWRO desalination plant with a South African abalone farm include: - no lengthy and costly environmental impact assessment (EIA) is required to build a new intake system - shared capital and operational cost of intake system - dual incentive to keep constant good quality water flowing through the farm - early warnings regarding occurrences such as algal bloom and red bait - shared operational and management cost to keep pipelines clean - electricity saved (pumps for intake system) Disadvantages of integrating an SWRO desalination plant with a South African abalone farm include: - will require diverting of the abalone tank wash water from regular effluent - possible water ‘down-times’ due to maintenance operations on abalone farm Based on information from the literature the fixed capital cost depreciation rate (FCCDR) typically contributes approximately 40 % and the operation and maintenance (O&M) cost typically contributes 60 % to the unit production cost (UPC) of desalinated water. Furthermore, a SWRO desalination plant’s intake system can contribute between 5 % and 33 % to the FCCDR, depending on the nature and design of the plant. Consequently, the intake system can contribute between 2 % and 13 % of the UPC of desalinated sea water. This implies possible cost savings of between R 0. 15 /m 3 and R 2. 37 /m 3 for the production of fresh water (depending on site-specific design factors) when desalinating sea water effluent from on-shore abalone tanks. Integration of an SWRO desalination plant with a South African abalone farm is feasible and viable, provided that the necessary steps and precautions are taken to ensure a smooth and stable operation of the SWRO desalination plant. Cost savings on the part of all the stakeholders are possible if the correct contract can be negotiated. AFRIKAANSE OPSOMMING: Byna alle Suid Afrikaanse perlemoenplase funksioneer op ‘n seewater deurvloeistelsel. Groot volumes seewater word aan wal gepomp en vloei deur die <b>perlemoen</b> of kelp-oes tenks. Hierdie water vloei dan uiteindelik terug na die oseaan as gevolg van swaartekrag. Indien die afvalwater van die perlemoenplase ontsout kan word sonder permanente membraanbevuiling kan seewater tru-osmose (SWTO) -tegnologie effektief met gevestigde perlemoenplase geïntegreer word sonder om die plase se water inname-stelsels se kapasiteite te vergroot. Sonder die behoefte aan uitbreiding en instandhouding van ‘n water inname-stelsel by so ‘n plaas behoort die totale koste van ontsouting aansienlik minder te wees. Die doel van hierdie studie was dus om die uitvoerbaarheid en lewensvatbaarheid van ‘n integrasie van ‘n SWTO ontsoutingsaanleg met ‘n tipiese Suid Afrikaanse perlemoenplaas te ondersoek. Ten einde dit te doen, het die projek op vier areas van belang gefokus, naamlik: - karakterisering van tipiese Suid-Afrikaanse perlemoenplaas water - SWTO ontsoutingsaanleg loodsstudie en membraan bevuilingsgedrag - algemene bedryf van ‘n tipiese perlemoenplaas en die implikasies vir ontsouting - kosteberamings en koste-implikasies met betrekking tot die integrasie van ‘n SWTO ontsoutingsaanleg met ‘n perlemoenplaas Gedurende ‘n nege maande op-perseel ondersoek is seewater troebelheid verminder met tot 43 % van 'n gemiddelde waarde van 0. 82 NTU in die invloeistroom tot 0. 47 NTU in die gekombineerde afvalwaterstroom wat die tenks verlaat. Selfs met skerp wisseling in die invloeistroom troebelheid, bly afvalwaterstroom troebelheid deurgaans onder 1 NTU met die uitsondering van tenk spoelwater. Opgeloste organiese koolstof (OOK) in beide die invloeistroom en die gekombineerde afvalwaterstroom het deurgaans onder 1 mg/liter gebly. Ultrafiltrasie (UF) is gebruik as voorbehandeling vir die tru-osmose (TO) om sodoende potensiële bevuiling van TO membrane te minimaliseer. Membraan kompaksie van beide die UF en TO het merkbaar bygedra tot aanvanlike deurvloeiverliese – so veel as 18 % vir die poli-etersulfoon (PESM) UF membrane en 20 % vir die dun film saamgestelde (DFS) poli-amied TO membraan. Hierdie is egter gerieflik binne die tipiese kompaksiewaardes soos aangehaal in die literatuur. Sonder flokkulasie was die UF in staat tot temperatuur aangepaste deurvloeitempo van tussen 45 en 55 liter/m 2 /h (LMH) teen herwinningstempo’s tussen 60 en 75 %. Ooreenstemmende trans-membraandrukkings (TMD) het gewissel tussen 0. 59 en 0. 76 bar. Met ysterchloried voor-flokkulasie teen 'n konsentrasie van 3 mg/liter (as Fe 3 +) kon die UF teen merkbaar laer TMD waardes bedryf word – tussen 0. 11 en 0. 36 bar. Hierdie resultate dui daarop dat daar beslis voorsiening vir pre-flokkulasie gemaak moet word wanneer UF as voorbehandeling gebruik word, ten spyte van die feit dat die OOK konsentrasie en troebelheid van die afvalwater van die perlemoenplaas redelik laag is (OOK < 1 mg / liter, troebelheid < 1 NTU). Verder lig dit die onvermoë uit om OOK en troebelheid alleen te gebruik om membraanbevuilingspotensiaal van water te voorspel. ‘n Beter aanwyser van membraanbevuilingspotensiaal, alhoewel nie perfek nie, is die aangepaste bevuilingsindeks (MFI 0. 45). Hierdie bevuilingsindeks volg ‘n lineêre neiging met die konsentrasie van onsuiwerhede en dien as ‘n goeie aanwyser van die filtreerbaarheid van water. Op-perseel metings het getoon dat ‘n toename in gemiddelde MFI 0. 45 waardes van 29 s/litre 2 vir die invloeistroom tot 48 s/litre 2 vir die afvalstroom van die perlemoentenks die behoefte vir voor-flokkulasie as deel van UF voorbehandeling bevestig. Chemies versterkte terugspoeling (CVT) van die UF membrane ten minste elke 24 uur is noodsaaklik gevind ten einde bestendige werking te verseker. Dus kan UF met voor-flokkulasie (3 mg/liter Fe 3 +) en gereelde CVT effektief as voorbehandeling metode vir die ontsouting van perlemoenplaas afvalwater gebruik word. ‘n TO ‘voer-en-bloeistelsel’ is gebruik om die tipiese prestasie van die laaste membraan in ‘n volskaalse TO membraanbank te simuleer. Hierdie TO membraan het goed presteer sonder tekens van buitensporige membraanbevuiling. Vir die laaste membraan in ‘n membraanbank het die membraan goeie gehalte finale water gelewer – ‘n vermindering van die totaal opgeloste stowwe (TOS) van die TO voerwater van 33 493 mg/liter tot 969 mg/liter is behaal. Hierdie resultate het goed vergelyk met gesimuleerde waardes deur Reverse Osmosis Analysis System (ROSA, ‘n TO simulator deur DOW) wat ‘n TOS vermindering van 33 271 mg/liter tot 1 409 mg/liter by ‘n voerdruk van 56 bar en ‘n algehele herwinningstempo van 44 % aandui. ‘n Bestendige werking van die TO membraan tydens die loodsstudie het getoon dat dit moontlik is om perlemoenplaas afvalwater te ontsout sonder merkwaardige permanente membraanbevuiling. 'n Stabiele genormaliseerde deurvloeitempo van 8 LMH is bereik en TO membraan integriteit het ongeskonde gebly met 'n sout verwerping wat gewissel het van 98. 0 tot 98. 5 %. Geen skielike afname in finale water deurvloeitempo is waargeneem as gevolg van bevuiling deur onbekende onsuiwerhede in die UF finale water nie. DBNPA (‘n nie-oksiderende ontsmettingsmiddel) is een keer per week teen ‘n ‘n konsentrasie van 10 – 30 mg / liter vir 30 minute gedoseer. Mineraal skaalvorming is effektief beheer deur die dosering van ‘n anti-skaalmiddel teen 11 – 12 mg/liter in die TO voerstroom. Die skoonmaak-in-plek (SIP) frekwensie is nie ge-optimeer nie, maar ‘n SIP een keer elke 6 – 8 weke is meer as voldoende gevind om mikrobiese bevuiling te voorkom. Voordele van die integrasie van 'n SWTO ontsoutingsaanleg met 'n Suid-Afrikaanse perlemoenplaas sluit die volgende in: - geen lang en duur omgewings impak ontleding (OIO) is nodig vir die bou van ‘n nuwe inname-stelsel nie - gedeelde kapitaal en operasionele koste van inname-stelsel - tweeledige aansporing om konstant goeie gehalte watervloei deur die plaas te verseker - vroegtydige waarskuwings ten opsigte van gebeurtenisse soos rooigety - gedeelde bedryfs- en bestuurskoste om voerpype skoon te hou Nadele van die integrasie van 'n SWTO ontsoutingsaanleg met 'n Suid-Afrikaanse perlemoenplaas sluit die volgende in: - vereis herleiding van perlemoentenk spoelwater weg van gereelde afvalwater - moontlike watervloei-aftye weens instandhoudingsbedrywighede op die perlemoenplaas Gebaseer op inligting uit die literatuur dra die vaste kapitaal koste waardeverminderings-koers (VKKWK) gewoonlik ongeveer 40 % en die bedryfs- en instandhoudingskoste (B&I) ongeveer 60 % by tot die produksiekoste per eenheid (PKE) van ontsoute water. Verder kan ’n SWTO ontsoutingsaanleg se inname-stelsel tussen 5 % en 33 % tot die VKKWK bydra afhangende van die aard en ontwerp van die aanleg. Gevolglik kan die inname-stelsel tussen 2 % en 13 % tot die PKE van ontsoute seewater bydra. Dit impliseer ‘n moontlike kostebesparing van tussen R 0. 15 /m 3 en R 2. 37 /m 3 vir die produksie van vars water wanneer die afvalwater van perlemoentenks ontsout word. Integrasie van 'n SWTO ontsoutingsaanleg met 'n Suid-Afrikaanse perlemoenplaas is uitvoerbaar en lewensvatbaar indien die nodige stappe en voorsorgmaatreëls geneem is om ‘n vlot en bestendige werking van die SWTO ontsoutingsaanleg te verseker. Kostebesparings vir alle belanghebbendes (beleggers) is moontlik indien daar oor die korrekte kontrak onderhandel kan word...|$|E
