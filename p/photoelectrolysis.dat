This characteristic of semiconductor/liquid junctions is similar to a rectifying semiconductor/metal junction or Schottky junction.

This paper is to quantify variations in key properties relevant for the <b>photoelectrolysis</b> {{as a function of}} oxygen incorporation and to determine an optimum oxygen concentration. Thin films were prepared by direct current magnetron sputtering in an Ar/N 2 /O 2 gas mixture at two different N 2 and varying O 2 concentrations. The films were characterized by grazing-incidence x-ray diffraction (GI-XRD), total transmission and reflectance spectroscopy (TTRS) from which the band gap is deduced, photocurrent measurements on which the calculation of the efficiency-mobility-lifetime (ημτ) product is based and <b>photoelectrolysis</b> experiments. Finally, the stability of films was determined by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measured before and after the <b>photoelectrolysis.</b> We show that material properties degrade with oxygen incorporation during the film growth.

40|$|Solar {{power is}} a leading option for {{renewable}} energy. However, storing solar energy {{is one of the}} leading pitfalls in this field, and one viable option is to store solar energy in chemical bonds, for example in H 2 via water splitting. Hematite, α-Fe 2 O 3, is one of the possible semiconductors that has been researched to drive <b>photoelectrolysis</b> of water. Hematite alone is not a decent material for <b>photoelectrolysis</b> because of the large activation energy required to begin the reaction. To make hematite more useful for <b>photoelectrolysis</b> an electrocatalyst, such as nickel oxide, is needed. In this experiment, nickel (II) nitrate was dissolved into distilled water; then, the solution was applied to hematite nanowires and exposed to atmospheric oxygen plasma. This left a coating of nickel oxide particles on the surface of the nanowires. The hematite with a nickel oxide catalyst can be used in this form to drive the water splitting reaction. After plasma deposition, it can also be placed in an oven at 550 ºC for an hour to anneal the sample, which creates a biphasic surface layer of nickel oxide and iron oxide. After annealing, the nickel oxide/hematite samples can be used to catalyze water splitting. The use of the electrocatalyst on the substrate improved the electrolysis of water by decreasing the overpotential by approximately 300 mV. Annealing the nickel oxide and hematite decreases the overpotential by the same amount as the unannealed nickel oxide layer covering the Fe 2 O 3.

Water <b>photoelectrolysis,</b> using semiconductor photo-electrodes, is a sustainable and cleanapproach to produce hydrogen. Because of the right potential alignment to the redox potentials of water, GaN-based semiconductors have drawn much attention for the application of self-driven water <b>photoelectrolysis.</b> In this dissertation, the photoelectrochemical properties of n-GaN have been investigated. Under illumination, n-GaN absorbs supra-bandgap light and generates photocarriers. Photo-holes participate in the following activities at the n-GaN anode: (1) oxidation of reductants in the solution, (2) photo-corrosion of GaN, (3) surface recombination and (4) carrier recombination in the bulk. Only the first process is desirable in the application of <b>photoelectrolysis.</b> We use different surface roughening approaches to suppress the 3 rd and 4 th processes. Br-, as asacrificial reducing agent, was added in the solution during the measurements to suppress the 2 nd process. First, the GaN epilayer has been modified into a nanopillar array using dry etching. The enlarged space charge region facilitates charge separation. The plateau photocurrent is therefore increased by 84 % with respect to planar GaN photoanode. Plasma-induced surface damage has been characterized by cyclic voltammetryand impedance spectroscopy. Surface damage of the pillars has been minimized by process engineering and post-wet etching. The influence of porosity on the photoelectrochemical properties of n-GaN has been investigated. The n-GaN epilayer was porosified using electrochemical anodic etching. Anodic etching of n-GaN was discussed using cyclic voltammetry and chronoamperometry. In the porous GaN, space charge region is tremendously enlarged and charge neutral region is reduced. Carrier recombination at the surface and in the bulk is therefore suppressed. Theplateau photocurrents for the porous GaN, etched at 5. 5 - 15. 0 V, increase over 400 % with respect to pristine n-GaN.

40|$|The {{environmental}} effect of atmospheric CO 2 associated with other geopolitical {{and economic problems}} linked to fossil fuels have urged the research {{and the development of}} new and clean sources of energy. The <b>photoelectrolysis</b> of water is an interesting way to produce clean fuel by converting solar energy into hydrogen. Hematite is a particularly attractive material for the <b>photoelectrolysis</b> of water thanks to its abundance, high stability in water and absorption in the visible part of the solar spectrum. Furthermore, the position of its valence band affords the oxidation of water into O 2. Nevertheless, hematite has some drawbacks like a too low conduction band to reduce water, a bad conduction of electrons and a very short diffusion length of holes (2 - 10 nm). The application of a bias resolves the positioning of the conduction band, while the conduction of electrons is improved by adding a dopant (SiO 2 or TiO 2). The short diffusion length, for its part, is improved by reducing the distance electrode-electrolyte. For this purpose, we developed mesoporous hematite films doped by TiO 2 by spin coating, based on the EIMP principle (Evaporation Inducing Micelles Packing). For the sake of comparison, a non mesoporous film was prepared. The crystallinity, the mesostructure and the performance in water splitting of the films were then characterized. Due to the high temperature of crystallization of the hematite, we had to proceed to the fine tuning of the thermal treatment to obtain a crystallized film and to preserve its mesoporosity, which was confirmed by TEM. Based on XRD analysis, it comes out that the mesoporosity leads to smaller grains than without mesoporosity. The water splitting performances were evaluated by measuring the photocurrent density under illumination (AM 1. 5 G, 100 mW/cm²) and the mesoporous film showed promising efficiencies (1. 9 mA/cm²) ...|$|E
40|$|About 3 μm thick {{tungsten}} trioxide film electrodes consisting of partly sintered, 40 - 80 nm in diameter, particles deposited on conducting glass substrates exhibit high photon-to-current conversion efficiencies for the photooxidation of water, exceeding 70 % at 400 nm. This is facilitated by a ca. 40 % film porosity resulting in high contact {{area with the}} electrolyte. It is shown that {{the activity of the}} WO 3 electrodes towards photooxidation of water is enhanced by addition of even small amounts of halide (Cl-, Br-) ions to the acidic electrolyte. <b>Photoelectrolysis</b> experiments performed either in acidic electrolytes containing chloride or bromide anions or in a 0. 5 M NaCl solution, under simulated 1. 5 AM solar illumination, demonstrated long term stability of the photocurrents. Oxygen remains the main product of the photoanodic reaction even in...|$|E
40|$|Abstract From a {{conceptual}} standpoint, the water <b>photoelectrolysis</b> reaction is {{the simplest way}} to convert solar energy into fuel. It is widely believed that nanostruc-tured photocatalysts can improve the efficiency of the process and lower the costs. Indeed, nanostructured light absorbers have several advantages over traditional materials. This includes shorter charge transport pathways and larger redox active surface areas. It is also possible to adjust the energetics of small particles via the quantum size effect or with adsorbed ions. At the same time, nanostructured absorbers have significant disadvantages over conventional ones. The larger surface area promotes defect recombination and reduces the photovoltage that can be drawn from the absorber. The smaller size of the particles also makes electron–hole separation more difficult to achieve. This chapter discusses these issues usin...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Vertically oriented, highly ordered TiO 2 {{nanotube}} arrays were fabricated via electrochemical anodization of high purity Ti {{sheet and}} Ti foil, which is increasing importance {{due to their}} impressing properties {{in a variety of}} applications including dye-sensitized solar cells, hydrogen generation by water <b>photoelectrolysis,</b> potocatalysis, and gas sensor. The well aligned TiO 2 nanotube arrays by potentiostatic anodization of Ti foil (with 0. 3 mm thickness) were constructed. We have achieved the self-aligned high ordered nanotube arrays in aqueous electrolyte containing HF and ethylene glycol electrolyte containing NH 4 F. Depending on the fluoride ion mobile velocity, the resulting nanotubes arrays exhibit the different morphology. The elaborated electrolyte on the morphology of the self-organized nanotubes arrays was investigated. Thermal annealing on the anodized Ti induced crystalline formation, which is confirmed by Raman spectroscopy measurement...|$|E
