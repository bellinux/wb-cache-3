40|$|The base {{resistance}} of smooth model <b>pile</b> groups <b>in</b> sand under static loading is investigated experimentally <b>in</b> a <b>pile</b> soil test apparatus. The {{study investigated the}} design of the pile foundation to support heavy structures -especially bridges for highways and railways - in the Sahara, which contains many dunes of loose to medium sand in different levels, where the foundation is supposed to be <b>piles.</b> <b>In</b> this case, cased (cast in-situ) bored piles are more economical than uncased piles. Improvement was made to the sand around the <b>piles</b> <b>in</b> order to increase the shaft resistance of the <b>piles</b> <b>in</b> the groups, and also {{base resistance}} especially for the central <b>pile</b> <b>in</b> <b>pile</b> groups. The study shows the effectiveness of improving the sand around the <b>piles</b> <b>in</b> increasing the bearing capacity of the pile group and increasing the bearing capacity with increasing embedment length of <b>piles</b> <b>in</b> the group. The study outlines the behaviour of 9 -pile groups arranged in a doubly symmetric [square] layout with different embedment lengths and <b>pile</b> spacing <b>in</b> medium dense dry sand [normal] and dense dry sand [compacted] around the piles...|$|R

40|$|The {{behavior}} of <b>piles</b> <b>in</b> seismic areas is significantly affected if the soil liquefies.

The observed pile damage during earthquakes has provided an insight into the mechanism of soil-pile interaction in liquefying soils.

40|$|The {{response}} {{of an individual}} pile to externally applied lateral load {{is one of the}} most complex soil-structure interaction problems in the field of foundation engineering. Piles that are used under tall chimneys, television towers, high-rise high retaining walls, offshore structures etc. Several methods are available for predicting the ultimate lateral resistance to <b>piles</b> <b>in</b> cohesionless soils. However these methods often produce significantly differently ultimate resistance values. This makes it difficult for practicing engineers to efficiently select the method when designing laterally loaded <b>piles</b> <b>in</b> cohesionless soils. This paper gives a comparative study of the lateral load behaviour of <b>piles</b> <b>in</b> cohesionless soils based on Finite Difference Method and Matlock &Reese Method.

25|$|The Supreme {{was also}} {{manufactured}} as a semi-integral on a DAF chassis. Around 20 were built.

As a semi-integral the body was required to support the full weight as there were no chassis members to support the body. Opening the side lockers luggage could be <b>piled</b> <b>in</b> one side and extracted from the other as nothing was in the way so it was very cutting edge technology.

500|$|Physcia caesia is {{a species}} of foliose lichenized fungus. First {{described}} by Georg Franz Hoffmann in 1784, it is common across much of Europe, North America and New Zealand, and more patchily distributed in South America, Asia, Australia and Antarctica. There are 2 subspecies, P. c. caesia and P. c. ventosa, {{as well as a}} number of distinct forms and varieties. Molecular studies suggest that the species as currently defined may be polyphyletic. It is typically pale gray shading to darker gray in the center (though some forms are considerably darker), and grows in a small rosette, usually some [...] across at maturity. It only rarely has apothecia, instead reproducing most often vegetatively via soredia, which are <b>piled</b> <b>in</b> round blue-gray mounds across the thallus's upper surface. It grows most often on rock—principally calcareous, but also basaltic and siliceous—and also occurs on bone, bark and soil. It is nitrophilic and is particularly common on substrates where birds perch.|$|E

500|$|In {{the broad}} field of mathematics, Shen Kuo {{mastered}} many practical mathematical problems, including many complex formulas for geometry, circle packing, and chords and arcs problems employing trigonometry. Shen addressed problems of writing out very large numbers, {{as large as}} 1043. Shen's [...] "technique of small increments" [...] laid the foundation in Chinese mathematics for packing problems involving equal difference series. Sal Restivo writes that Shen used summation of higher series to ascertain the number of kegs which could be <b>piled</b> <b>in</b> layers in a space shaped like the frustum of a rectangular pyramid. In his formula [...] "technique of intersecting circles", he created an approximation of the {{arc of a circle}} s given the diameter d, sagitta v, and length of the chord c subtending the arc, the length of which he approximated as s = c + 2v2/d. Restivo writes that Shen's work in the lengths of arcs of circles provided the basis for spherical trigonometry developed in the 13th century by Guo Shoujing (1231–1316). He also simplified the counting rods technique by outlining short cuts in algorithm procedures used on the counting board, an idea expanded on by the mathematician Yang Hui (1238–1298). Victor J. Katz asserts that Shen's method of [...] "dividing by 9, increase by 1; dividing by 8, increase by 2," [...] was a direct forerunner to the rhyme scheme method of repeated addition [...] "9, 1, bottom add 1; 9, 2, bottom add 2".|$|E

2500|$|The {{harvested}} pods are opened, typically with a machete, {{to expose}} the beans. The pulp and cocoa seeds are removed and the rind is discarded.

Sweating {{is important for the}} quality of the beans, which originally have a strong, bitter taste. If sweating is interrupted, the resulting cocoa may be ruined; if underdone, the cocoa seed maintains a flavor similar to raw potatoes and becomes susceptible to mildew. Some cocoa-producing countries distill alcoholic spirits using the liquefied pulp.|$|E
