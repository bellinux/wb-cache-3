40|$|The optimal {{analysis}}/synthesis filters {{giving the}} maximum coding gain are derived in subband schemes. The optimal analysis filters consist of {{the emphasis of}} the <b>picture</b> <b>signal</b> and ideal band-splitting. The characteristic of the emphasis {{is determined by the}} spectrum of the <b>picture</b> <b>signal.</b> A large improvement of coding gain is achieved by the subband scheme with the optimal subband filters obtained here. Approximated emphasis characteristic determined from a spectrum model of <b>picture</b> <b>signals</b> can be used and the ideal hand-splitting filters can be replaced by conventional subband filters since the degradation of coding gain due to these approximations is small. Computer simulation of super HD image coding by the proposed scheme is performed. SN ratio of the reconstructed image is increased and edges are reconstructed very well compared to the conventional subband scheme. The proposed scheme is very suited to super HD image coding since the improvement of SN ratio is large for images with high correlation between the neighboring pixels. 1...|$|R

40|$|Conscious {{regulation}} of negative emotion {{has been shown}} to affect human eyeblink startle responses, but whether these results depend on modulation of arousal- or valence-based processes is unknown. The authors presented participants with negative, neutral, and <b>positive</b> <b>pictures</b> and directed them to enhance, maintain, and suppress emotional responses. On emotional picture trials, startle responses decreased as a function of cue in the following order: enhance � maintain � suppress. Analysis of negative and <b>positive</b> <b>picture</b> trials separately revealed similar patterns of startle modulation by emotion regulation. There were no effects of emotion regulation on neutral trials. Results indicate that arousal, not valence, may be critical to startle modulation via conscious emotion regulation...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{work has}} {{questioned}} whether the negativity bias is a distinct component of affective picture processing. The current {{study was designed to}} determine whether there are different neural correlates of processing <b>positive</b> and negative <b>pictures</b> using event-related brain potentials. The early posterior negativity and late positive potential were greatest in amplitude for erotic pictures. Partial Least Squares analysis revealed one latent variable that distinguished erotic pictures from neutral and <b>positive</b> <b>pictures</b> and another that differentiated negative pictures from neutral and <b>positive</b> <b>pictures.</b> The effects of orienting task on the neural correlates of processing negative and erotic pictures indicate that affective picture processing is sensitive to both stimulus-driven, and attentional or decision processes. The current data, together with other recent findings from our laboratory, lead to the suggestion that there are distinct neural correlates of processing negative and positive stimuli during affective picture processing...|$|R

40|$|AbstractAttention is {{captured}} more strongly by emotional pictures than by neutral pictures. This allocation {{of attention to}} emotional pictures is commonly indexed by the late positive potential (LPP). This event-related potential (ERP) is larger for negative and <b>positive</b> <b>pictures</b> than for neutral pictures. However, findings are mixed in regards to valence effects, that is, whether the LPP is larger for negative <b>pictures</b> than for <b>positive</b> <b>pictures</b> (negativity bias) or vice versa (positivity bias). Additionally, previous ERP studies have not explicitly considered a moderating effect of gender. In the present study, positive, negative, and neutral pictures were shown at fixation but were always task-irrelevant. Results showed that LPP amplitudes for {{the positive and negative}} distracters were moderated by gender. Men showed a positivity bias on the LPP (i. e., larger amplitudes for <b>positive</b> <b>pictures</b> than for negative pictures). Women did not show a clear valence bias on the LPP, but they showed a negativity bias on picture ratings. These gender differences for the LPP did not habituate, as they were obtained even for pictures that were repeated 20 times. Because previous studies with other measures suggest a positivity bias for men and a negativity bias for women, the present findings extend these studies suggesting that attention allocation for emotional pictures of different valence is similarly moderated by gender...|$|R
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} the modulating effects of emotional context on pain perception in 16 patients with fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) and 16 healthy control (HC) subjects. An infrared laser was used to apply individually adapted painful stimuli to the dorsum of the left hand. The emotional background of the painful stimuli was modulated by concurrent presentations of negative, neutral, and <b>positive</b> <b>picture</b> stimuli selected from the International Affective Picture System. As control conditions, painful stimuli and the pictures were also presented by themselves. During each of the 5 laser-picture trials, subjects received 10 painful stimuli {{and were asked to}} rate the average intensity and unpleasantness of the experienced pain. Functional magnetic resonance images were obtained, using a T 2 ∗ sensitive echo planar sequence. HC subjects showed a linear increase in pain intensity and unpleasantness ratings when painful stimuli were presented during positive, neutral, and negative pictures. In contrast, FMS patients showed a quadratic trend for pain intensity ratings indicating a lack of pain reduction by the <b>positive</b> <b>pictures.</b> In addition, the FMS patients showed less activation in secondary somatosensory cortex, insula, orbitofrontal cortex, and anterior cingulate cortex during the <b>positive</b> <b>picture</b> pain trials. Our results suggest that fibromyalgia patients are less efficient in modulating pain by positive affect and may benefit less from appetitive events than healthy control subjects...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{stimulus}} valence and arousal on facial electromyographic (EMG) asymmetry was investigated {{to inform the}} debate about two contrasting hypotheses of emotion: the right hemisphere dominance hypothesis and the valence hypothesis. EMG was recorded from {{the left and right}} corrugator and zygomaticus muscles while participants (N = 21) viewed blocks of negative and <b>positive</b> <b>pictures</b> that were high or low in arousal. Ratings of valence and arousal were taken before and after each of the four emotion blocks. Corrugator muscle activity yielded evidence for left hemi-face dominance during high and low arousal negative picture blocks whereas zygomaticus muscle activity yielded evidence for right hemi-face dominance during high arousal <b>positive</b> <b>picture</b> blocks, especially early during the picture sequence. This pattern of results is consistent with the valence hypothesis. (C) 2010 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Odor {{perception}} is influenced {{to an important}} extent by the expectations one has about the characteristics of that odor. Instead of focusing {{on the effect of}} cognitive processes on the final olfactory percept, the present experiment focused on the effect that cognitive processes –expectations- have on the early perceptual stage; the sniff. Visual stimuli, <b>positive</b> or negative <b>pictures</b> preceded the presentation of pleasant or unpleasant odors in mostly a congruent manner (positive – pleasant, negative – unpleasant) but sometimes in an incongruent manner (positive-unpleasant, negative – pleasant). Sniff vigor, total inhaled volume and sniff duration were expected to be mediated by expectation. The results showed that visual images have an influence on different sniff characteristics. The total inhaled volume of the odor increased when it was preceded by a <b>positive</b> <b>picture</b> compared to a negative picture, whatever odor was presented. Also, the sniff vigor slightly increased when the odor was preceded by a <b>positive</b> <b>picture.</b> People seem to use different ‘sniff patterns’ tailored to the odor they expect to perceive...|$|R
