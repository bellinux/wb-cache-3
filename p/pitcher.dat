(The others were Don Newcombe, the first Cy Young winner in 1956, and Don Drysdale in 1962.) Each of Koufax's three Cy Young Awards were by unanimous vote.

From the time he made his major league debut with the Astros in 1971 until 1975, Richard had a limited role as an Astros <b>pitcher,</b> throwing no more than 72 innings in a season.

50|$|There are {{a number}} of {{distinct}} throwing styles used by <b>pitchers.</b> The most common style is a three-quarters delivery in which the <b>pitcher's</b> arm snaps downward with the release of the ball. Some <b>pitchers</b> use a sidearm delivery in which the arm arcs laterally to the torso. Some <b>pitchers</b> use a submarine style in which the <b>pitcher's</b> body tilts sharply downward on delivery, creating an exaggerated sidearm motion in which the <b>pitcher's</b> knuckles come very close to the mound.|$|R
50|$|Adjusted ERA+, often simply {{abbreviated}} to ERA+ or ERA plus, is a pitching statistic in baseball.

5|$|From the {{day that}} Speaker arrived in Cleveland, manager Lee Fohl rarely made an {{important}} move without consulting him. George Uhle recalled an incident from 1919 during his rookie year with the Indians. Speaker often signaled to Fohl when he thought that a <b>pitcher</b> should be brought in from the bullpen. One day, Fohl misread Speaker's signal and brought in a different <b>pitcher</b> than Speaker had intended. To avoid the appearance of overruling his manager, Speaker let the change stand. <b>Pitcher</b> Fritz Coumbe lost the game, Fohl resigned that night and Speaker became manager.

5|$|In 1956 {{he started}} his third All-Star Game, but was charged with the loss despite {{allowing}} only one run in three innings. Buoyed {{by the arrival of}} rookie shortstop Luis Aparicio, who sparked the team in leading the league in stolen bases, the White Sox enjoyed a two-month offensive surge from June 4 to August 3 in which they averaged eight runs in Pierce's 13 starts; he won 11 of the games, losing only those immediately before and after the All-Star break, the latter being a 2–1 loss to Ford and the Yankees. He became the first White Sox <b>pitcher</b> since 1941 to win 20 games, was second in the AL with a career-high 192 strikeouts (a team record for left-handers until Gary Peters had 205 in 1964), and was named AL <b>Pitcher</b> of the Year by The Sporting News, outpolling Ford (who had edged him in a close 1955 vote) by a margin of 117 to 52; he also finished fifth in voting for the AL Most Valuable Player Award. In 1957 Pierce became the first White Sox <b>pitcher</b> since Red Faber (1920–1922) to earn 20 victories in consecutive seasons; he tied Jim Bunning for the league lead, and bested him in voting for AL <b>Pitcher</b> of the Year. He had six consecutive complete game victories from May 16 to June 8 in which his total ERA was 0.64, with two 1–0 victories in ten innings including his sixth career two-hitter on June 4 against the Red Sox; the White Sox scored just nine total runs over the last five games in that stretch. Despite the presence of such popular players as Miñoso, Aparicio and second baseman Nellie Fox, Pierce was chosen as the player most popular with White Sox fans in a 1957 spring training poll of sportswriters. A separate poll of managers, coaches, writers and broadcasters named him Chicago's best fielding <b>pitcher,</b> best <b>pitcher</b> at holding runners to first base, and best <b>pitcher</b> for crucial games, as well as the team's most nervous player on the field.|$|E

5|$|In July 2009, Phillies scouts {{evaluated}} <b>pitcher</b> Pedro Martínez in two simulated {{games against}} the Phillies DSL team, leading to a one-year, $1-million contract.

5|$|In recent decades, {{pitchers}} {{have rarely}} won the award.

5|$|In the 1968 season, Wilhelm {{was getting}} close to {{breaking}} the all-time games pitched record belonging to Cy Young (906 games).

Wilhelm later broke the record as a relief <b>pitcher.</b> He also set MLB records for consecutive errorless games by a <b>pitcher,</b> career victories in relief, games finished and innings pitched in relief. Despite Wilhelm's success, the White Sox, who had won at least 83 games per season in the 1960s, performed poorly. They finished 1968 with a 67–95 record.|$|E
5000|$|In baseball, a {{right-handed}} <b>pitcher's</b> curve {{ball will}} {{break away from}} a right-handed batter and towards a left-handed batter. Historical batting averages show that left-handed batters have a slight advantage over right-handed batters when facing right-handed <b>pitchers.</b> Because there are fewer left-handed <b>pitchers</b> than right-handed <b>pitchers,</b> left-handed batters have more opportunities to face right-handed <b>pitchers</b> than their right-handed counterparts have against left-handed <b>pitchers.</b> Fourteen of the top twenty career batting averages in Major League Baseball history have been posted by left-handed batters. Left-handed batters have a slightly shorter run from the batter's box to first base than right-handers. This gives left-handers a slight advantage in beating throws to first base on infield ground balls.|$|R
