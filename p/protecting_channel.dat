40|$|We {{consider}} {{the dynamics of}} an electron in an infinite disordered metallic wire. We derive exact expressions for the probability of diffusive {{return to the starting}} point in a given time. The result is valid for wires with or without time-reversal symmetry and allows for the possibility of topologically <b>protected</b> conducting <b>channels.</b> In the absence of <b>protected</b> <b>channels,</b> Anderson localization leads to a nonzero limiting value of the return probability at long times, which is approached as a negative power of time with an exponent depending on the symmetry class. When topologically <b>protected</b> <b>channels</b> are present (in a wire of either unitary or symplectic symmetry), the probability of return decays to zero at long time as a power law whose exponent depends on the number of <b>protected</b> <b>channels.</b> Technically, we describe the electron dynamics by the one-dimensional supersymmetric non-linear sigma model. We derive an exact identity that relates any local dynamical correlation function in a disordered wire of unitary, orthogonal, or symplectic symmetry to a certain expectation value in the random matrix ensemble of class AIII, CI, or DIII, respectively. The established exact mapping from one- to zero-dimensional sigma model is very general and can be used to compute any local observable in a disordered wire.

50|$|Unlike Category A {{services}}, Category B {{services are}} not protected as to format. They are licensed to broadcast within defined formats {{which are not}} provided by or overly close to an existing <b>protected</b> <b>channel,</b> but their formats are not protected themselves and need not protect other Category B services. Also unlike Category A services, a Category B service does not have guaranteed cable carriage rights, but must directly negotiate carriage with cable distributors. Category B services encompass both pay television and specialty channels.|$|R
50|$|The island {{fringe of}} Norway {{is such a}} group of glacially formed skerries (called a skjærgård); many of the cross fjords are so {{arranged}} that they parallel the coast and provide a <b>protected</b> <b>channel</b> behind an almost unbroken succession of mountainous islands and skerries. By this channel one can travel through a protected passage almost the entire 1,600 km route from Stavanger to North Cape, Norway. The Blindleia is a skerry-protected waterway that starts near Kristiansand in southern Norway, and continues past Lillesand.|$|R

50|$|In the Atlantic Ocean {{the word}} pink {{was used to}} {{describe}} any small ship with a narrow stern, having derived from the Dutch word pincke. They had a large cargo capacity, and were generally square rigged. Their flat bottoms (and resulting shallow draught) made them more useful in shallow waters than some similar classes of ship. They were most often used for short-range missions in <b>protected</b> <b>channels,</b> as both merchantmen and warships. A number saw service in the English Navy {{during the second half}} of the 17th Century. In the 1730s pinks were used in cross Atlantic voyages to bring Palatinate immigrants to America.|$|R
25|$|Another common {{criticism}} {{concerns the}} integration of {{a new form of}} digital rights management (DRM) into the operating system, specifically the Protected Video Path (PVP), which involves technologies such as High-bandwidth Digital Content Protection (HDCP) and the Image Constraint Token (ICT). These features were added to Vista due to licensing restrictions from the HD-DVD consortium and Blu-ray association. This will concern only the resolution of playback of protected content on HD DVD and Blu-ray discs, but it has not been enabled as of 2012. A lack of a <b>protected</b> <b>channel</b> does not stop playback. Audio plays back as normal but high-definition video downsamples on Blu-ray and HD DVD to slightly-better-than-DVD quality video.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we provide {{a recipe for}} state {{protection}} in a network of oscillators under collective damping and diffusion. Our strategy is to manipulate the network topology, i. e., the way the oscillators are coupled together, {{the strength of their}} couplings, and their natural frequencies, {{in order to create a}} relaxation-diffusion-free <b>channel.</b> This <b>protected</b> <b>channel</b> defines a decoherence-free subspace (DFS) for nonzero-temperature reservoirs. Our development also furnishes an alternative approach to build up DFSs that offers two advantages over the conventional method: it enables the derivation of all the network-protected states at once, and also reveals, through the network normal modes, the mechanism behind the emergence of these protected domains.

40|$|Topology plays {{a central}} role in {{ensuring}} the robustness {{of a wide variety of}} physical phenomena. Notable examples range from the current-carrying edge states associated with the quantum Hall and the quantum spin Hall effects to topologically protected quantum memory and quantum logic operations. Here we propose and analyse a topologically <b>protected</b> <b>channel</b> for the transfer of quantum states between remote quantum nodes. In our approach, state transfer is mediated by the edge mode of a chiral spin liquid. We demonstrate that the proposed method is intrinsically robust to realistic imperfections associated with disorder and decoherence. Possible experimental implementations and applications to the detection and characterization of spin liquid phases are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{introduction}} of potentially invasive species {{is a concern}} {{to the public and}} the aquaculture industry. Used to <b>protect</b> <b>channel</b> catfish from infectious trematode infestations, the non-indigenous black carp has been evaluated by the US Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) and deemed potentially 'injurious' {{under the terms of the}} Lacey Act. Consequently, the black carp may be restricted from interstate commerce and eventually removed from US waters. An alternative approach to evaluating the risks posed by invasive species is considered and compared to that used by the USFWS. Short of outright restriction, reasonable options for management of such invasive species probably exist, including better use of environmental assurance bonds and return-deposit models. ...|$|R

40|$|A trusted path is a <b>protected</b> <b>channel</b> that assures {{the secrecy}} and {{authenticity}} of data transfers between a user’s input/output (I/O) device and a program trusted by that user. We argue that, despite its incontestable necessity, current commodity systems do not support trusted path with any significant assurance. This paper presents a hypervisor-based design that enables a trusted path to bypass an untrusted operating-system, applications, and I/O devices, with a minimal Trusted Computing Base (TCB). We also suggest concrete I/O architectural changes that will simplify future trusted-path system design. Our system enables users to verify the states and configurations {{of one or more}} trusted-paths using a simple, secret-less, hand-held device. We implement a simple user-oriented trusted path as a case study. ...|$|R
50|$|Each winter 4,000 to 10,000 North Pacific {{humpback}} whales {{migrate from}} Alaska to Hawaii.

Whale watching is possible within as well as outside the Hawaiian Islands Humpback Whale National Marine Sanctuary. The best places to see whales in Hawaiʻi is in the <b>protected</b> <b>channels</b> between the Hawaiʻian islands. The best months to see the whales here are January and February when you can expect to see between 2 and 4 whales per 15 minute period, although fluctuations between 0 and 20 sightings are normal.|$|R
50|$|According to Ofcom, the {{watershed}} on free-to-air {{television in the}} UK is between 21:00 (09:00 p.m.) and 05:30 (05:30 a.m.), while premium or pay-per-view services are allowed to start {{the watershed}} at 20:00 (8:00 p.m.). Until 1 October 2011, the watershed ended at 05:30 for premium channels as it still does for the free-to-air channels. On 1 October 2011, the watershed rules for the premium channels were relaxed, now ending at 06:00. Programmes that are rated 15 cannot be shown outside this period. However, some 12-rated shows can be shown before 21:00, such as The Simpsons, Malcolm in the Middle, Doctor Who, Atlantis and Futurama. There is no watershed on PIN <b>protected</b> <b>channels</b> (such as Sky Movies). On this type of channel, trying to view adult material before 20:00 will require a PIN.|$|R
