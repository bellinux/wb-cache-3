5|$|The impasse {{is broken}} by the return of Miss Prism, whom Lady Bracknell {{recognises}} as the person who, twenty-eight years earlier, as a family nursemaid, had taken a baby boy {{for a walk in}} a <b>perambulator</b> (baby carriage) and never returned. Challenged, Miss Prism explains that she had absentmindedly put the manuscript of a novel she was writing in the <b>perambulator,</b> and the baby in a handbag, which she had left at Victoria Station. Jack produces the very same handbag, showing that he is the lost baby, the elder son of Lady Bracknell's late sister, and thus Algernon's elder brother. Having acquired such respectable relations, he is acceptable as a suitor for Gwendolen after all.|$|E
5|$|By 1801 the {{population}} of both Manchester and Salford was about 94,000. By 1861 this had risen to about 460,000, and so {{in the same year}} John Greenwood Jr. made an application to Salford Borough Council and to the Pendleton Turnpike Trust, to build a tramway from Pendleton to Albert Bridge in Salford. The system was innovative in that the rails were designed to be 'flush' with the road surface, with a third central rail to accommodate a <b>perambulator</b> wheel attached to the front axle of the omnibus. Approval was granted and work commenced immediately, with the horse-pulled tramway finished in September 1861. It remained in use for a further eleven years when the condition of the track had deteriorated such that the council ordered it removed. The Tramways Act 1870 allowed councils to construct their own tramways, and on 17 May 1877 the 'Manchester and Salford Tramways' opened for business. The network of lines was largely complete by September 1880, the company changed its name to the Manchester Carriage and Tramways Company, and the system reached its peak in the 1890s. A steam tramway was opened on 12 April 1883 from Bury to Higher Broughton. The vehicles provoked letters of complaints from residents about the associated noise, dirt, and grease, and by 1888 the route was eventually curtailed to Besses o' th' Barn.|$|E
500|$|Disney {{had wanted}} Fantasia {{to be an}} ongoing project, with a new edition being {{released}} every few years. His plan was to substitute {{one of the original}} segments with a new one as it was completed, so audiences would always see {{a new version of the}} film. From January to August 1941, story material was developed based on additional musical works, including Ride of the Valkyries by Richard Wagner, The Swan of Tuonela by Jean Sibelius, Invitation to the Dance by Carl Maria von Weber, the Polka and Fugue from Schwanda the Bagpiper by Jaromír Weinberger and Flight of the Bumblebee by Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov, which was later adapted into the Bumble Boogie segment in Melody Time (1948). The film's disappointing initial box office performance and the USA's entry into World War II brought an end to these plans. Deems Taylor prepared introductions for The Firebird by Stravinsky, La Mer by Claude Debussy, Adventures in a <b>Perambulator</b> by John Alden Carpenter, Don Quixote by Richard Strauss, and Pictures at an Exhibition by Mussorgsky [...] "to have them for the future in case we decided to make any one of them".|$|E
50|$|In 1909 the {{sidewalks}} of St. James Park {{were known as}} a place where nurses attending <b>perambulators</b> would air and care for babies of the mothers who lived nearby.|$|R
60|$|In their {{favourite}} firmaments {{the stars}} of crocuses and daffodils were shining. Almost every tree had its pigeon cooing, every bush its blackbird in full song. And on the paths were babies in <b>perambulators.</b> These were their happy hunting-grounds, and here they came each day to watch {{from a safe distance}} the little dirty girls sitting on the grass nursing little dirty boys, to listen to the ceaseless chatter of these common urchins, and learn to deal with the great problem of the lowest classes. And babies sat in their <b>perambulators,</b> thinking and sucking india-rubber tubes. Dogs went before them, and nursemaids followed after.|$|R
6000|$|... 'They are the {{children}} who fall out of their <b>perambulators</b> when the nurse is looking the other way. If they are not claimed in seven days they are sent far away to the Neverland to defray expenses. I'm captain.' ...|$|R
500|$|At the {{outbreak}} of World War I, the Royal Serbian Army had only three planes, {{one of which was}} piloted by Tomić. His plane was quite primitive even for 1914. Misha Glenny, a journalist who has written extensively on the Balkans, likens it to [...] "a box kite on <b>perambulator</b> wheels". At the beginning of the war, Tomić was attached to the 1st Danube Division. On the afternoon of 12 August 1914, he flew a reconnaissance mission over Šabac, and disclosed to the Serbian High Command that, contrary to initial reports, the Austro-Hungarians had not set up pontoon bridges on the Sava and were attempting to cross the river with boats. On 15 August, Tomić encountered an enemy plane while conducting a reconnaissance flight over Austria-Hungary. The Austro-Hungarian aviator initially waved at Tomić, who waved back. The enemy pilot then took a revolver and began shooting at Tomić's plane. Tomić produced a pistol of his own and fired back. He swerved away from the Austro-Hungarian plane and the two aircraft eventually parted ways. This incident is considered the first recorded dogfight of the war. Within weeks, all Serbian and Austro-Hungarian aircraft were armed. The Serbians equipped their planes with [...] Schwarzlose MG M.07/12 machine guns, six 100-round boxes of ammunition and several bombs. The first armed Serbian plane was given the name OЛУЈ (Oluj), or [...] "storm". It was mostly flown by Tomić.|$|E
6000|$|Another {{excellent}} {{piece of}} material for obtaining excitement in Germany is the simple domestic <b>perambulator.</b> What you may {{do with a}} [...] "kinder-wagen," [...] as it is called, and what you may not, covers pages of German law; after the reading of which, you conclude {{that the man who}} can push a <b>perambulator</b> through a German town without breaking the law was meant for a diplomatist. You must not loiter with a <b>perambulator,</b> and you must not go too fast. You must not get in anybody's way with a <b>perambulator,</b> and if anybody gets in your way you must get out of their way. If you want to stop with a <b>perambulator,</b> you must go to a place specially appointed where perambulators may stop; and when you get there you must stop. You must not cross the road with a perambulator; if you and the baby happen to live on the other side, that is your fault. You must not leave your <b>perambulator</b> anywhere, and only in certain places can you take it with you. I should say that in Germany you could go out with a <b>perambulator</b> and get into enough trouble in half an hour to last you for a month. Any young Englishman anxious for a row with the police could not do better than come over to Germany and bring his <b>perambulator</b> with him.|$|E
6000|$|... “He {{was in his}} goat-carriage, and met the Gaffins {{in their}} <b>perambulator,</b> and he drove the goat full tilt at them and sent the <b>perambulator</b> spinning. Little Jacky Gaffin was pinned down under the wreckage, and while the nurse had her hands full with the goat Hyacinth was laying into Jacky’s legs with his belt like a small fury.” ...|$|E
50|$|Though {{the primary}} purpose of the tramway was the {{carriage}} of passengers it also carried other items such as mail, newspapers, <b>perambulators,</b> bicycles, construction materials, and animals. The cartage of animals on the tramway was made illegal in December 1915.|$|R
60|$|Then {{she called}} {{up all the}} {{careless}} nurserymaids, and stuck pins into them all over, and wheeled them about in <b>perambulators</b> with tight straps across their stomachs and their heads and arms hanging over the side, till they were quite sick and stupid, and would have had sun-strokes: but, being under the water, they could only have water-strokes; which, I assure you, are nearly as bad, as you will find {{if you try to}} sit under a mill-wheel. And mind--when you hear a rumbling {{at the bottom of the}} sea, sailors will tell you that it is a ground-swell: but now you know better. It is the old lady wheeling the maids about in <b>perambulators.</b>|$|R
50|$|Larger {{and heavier}} prams, or <b>perambulators</b> {{had been used}} since their {{introduction}} in the Victorian era; prams were also used for infants, often sitting up. The term carrycot became {{more common in the}} UK after the introduction of lighter units with detachable baby carriers in the 1970s.|$|R
6000|$|Worksop Petty Sessions. Before Messrs. F. J. S. Foljambe, R. Eddison, [...] and S. Smith. John Priestley, {{charged with}} assaulting the Rev. Leslie [...] Graham. Defendant, who was drunk, was {{wheeling}} a <b>perambulator</b> and [...] pushed {{it in front}} of a lorry, with the result that the <b>perambulator</b> [...] was overturned and the baby in it thrown out. The lorry passed over [...] the <b>perambulator,</b> but the baby was uninjured. Defendant then attacked [...] the driver of the lorry, and afterwards assaulted the complainant, who [...] remonstrated with him upon his conduct. In consequence of the [...] injuries defendant inflicted, complainant had to consult a doctor. [...] Fined 40s. and costs.|$|E
60|$|The delighted dog rushed backwards, barking furiously, {{and tried}} to throw up paving stones with its hind legs. That frightened a nursemaid who was {{wheeling}} a <b>perambulator,</b> {{and then it was}} that I entered into the proceedings. Seated {{on the edge of the}} pavement, with a <b>perambulator</b> on one side of me and a howling baby on the other, I told that dog what I thought of him.|$|E
60|$|Solomon, having assured {{himself that}} the party in the <b>perambulator</b> was still breathing, crossed his legs and lit his pipe.|$|E
6000|$|... "But remember, both of you," [...] {{continued}} Lord Keith, [...] "that happen what may, {{this poor}} {{child is not}} to be in her charge. I've seen enough of her children left alone in <b>perambulators</b> in the sun. You will be in Edinburgh?" [...] he added, turning to Rachel.|$|R
50|$|Brownbills {{particular}} political passions were {{the welfare of}} women, children and the aged. In her maiden speech, she spoke of a mothers life of sacrifice, and urged the Railways Commissioners to allow <b>perambulators</b> on the railways. One of her many achievements was the establishment of Grace McKellar House, a nursing home for the elderly, which is still operating today.|$|R
6000|$|... "As {{a society}} {{we do not}} {{recognise}} these private cases. The public gain is so infinitesimal. We had one probationer who constructed a very ingenious water-butt for boys. Another had a scheme for clearing {{the streets of the}} people who get in the way. He got into trouble about some <b>perambulators.</b> Let me see your hands." ...|$|R
60|$|Ethelbertha {{attempted}} {{to take her}} out in the <b>perambulator</b> one morning, but the child would not hear of it for a moment.|$|E
60|$|The <b>perambulator</b> {{was going}} through the little gate in the railing. She kissed her hand; {{directed}} by the nurse, Jimmy waved his.|$|E
60|$|Teddy, who {{was back}} in his flannels, seized upon the <b>perambulator.</b> There was much careful baby stowing {{on the part of}} Cecily; she {{displayed}} an infinitely maternal solicitude. Letty was away changing; she reappeared jauntily taking leave, disregarding the baby absolutely, and Teddy departed bigamously, wheeling the <b>perambulator</b> between the two sisters into the hazes of the moonlight. There was much crying of good nights. Mr. Direck's curiosities narrowed down to a point of great intensity....|$|E
60|$|A child, brained {{within an}} inch by the old gentleman's umbrella, began to cry. The nurse told the old gentleman he was a fool--a remark which struck me as {{singularly}} apt The old gentleman gasped back that <b>perambulators</b> were illegal on the pavement; and, between his exercises, inquired after myself. A crowd began to collect; and a policeman strolled up.|$|R
40|$|Photograph of a {{group of}} nurse-maids and their charges in a park in Hong Kong, ca. 1900. A crowd of baby {{strollers}} (<b>perambulators)</b> are pictured on a park path at center, where the nurses are congregating. Some of the children are older, and toddle around the area, while to the left, a man in {{what appears to be a}} police uniform stands looking towards the viewer. Victorian-style buildings can be seen in the background...|$|R
60|$|I {{knew she}} was {{punishing}} me for her own reluctance; but I flew, in that sense of the term, and easily overhauled them in the tangle of people coming and going in the path, and the nursemaids pushing their <b>perambulators</b> in either direction. Hat in hand I delivered my message. I {{could see that it}} gave the women great pleasure and the man some doubt. His mouth fell open a little; their cheeks flushed and their eyes shone.|$|R
6000|$|... "Unfair!" [...] murmured {{the man who}} {{understood}} quick-firers. [...] "If I couldn't shape better than that I'd hire myself out to wheel a <b>perambulator.</b> He's cooked." ...|$|E
6000|$|... [They all {{prepare to}} go. MRS. RUTTLEDGE {{has gone to}} open gate and [...] {{children}} come in, one in a <b>perambulator.</b> All gather round them [...] admiringly.|$|E

5|$|Fifteen {{stations}} were {{built for the}} first stage, and five for the second stage. The stations and the visual profile of {{the system as a}} whole are designed by the Bergen-based design groups Cubus and Fuggi Baggi Design, and Copenhagen-based Kontrapunkt. The stations of the first two stages are at street level, with facilities for buying tickets and dynamic displays that show when the next tram will arrive. The platforms have step-free access to the trams, allowing unhindered accessibility by wheelchairs and <b>perambulators.</b>|$|R
50|$|Low-floor buses usually {{include an}} area without seating (or seating that folds up) next {{to at least}} one of the doors, where wheelchairs, walkers, <b>perambulators,</b> and where allowed even bicycles, can be parked. This is {{sometimes}} not the only purpose of this area, though, as many operators employ larger standee areas for high occupancy at peak times. Despite the space existing, operators may also insist that only one or two wheelchairs or pushchairs can be accommodated unfolded, due to space/safety concerns.|$|R
60|$|After {{returning}} from the station, Honora sat {{for a long time}} at her window, looking out on the park. The afternoon sunlight had the silvery tinge that comes to it in March; the red gravel of the centre driveway was very wet, and the grass of the lawns of the houses opposite already a vivid green; in the back-yards the white clothes snapped from the lines; and a group of children, followed by nurses with <b>perambulators,</b> tripped along the strip of sidewalk.|$|R
60|$|The ball {{missed the}} legs of the lady with the noble nose by a kind of miracle, hit and glanced off the wheel of the <b>perambulator,</b> and went {{spinning}} into a border of antirrhinums.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's all right, my dear," [...] he said; [...] "it's all right. You're only {{a little}} overwrought. It's that cheap <b>perambulator.</b> I've {{arranged}} for a bath-chair man to come round with something stouter to-morrow--" ...|$|E
60|$|MENDOZA. [springing to his feet] Funk! Young man: I come of {{a famous}} family of fighters; and as your sister well knows, you would have as much chance against me as a <b>perambulator</b> against your motor car.|$|E
60|$|He {{glared at}} every person he passed, {{and ran into}} <b>perambulators.</b> He rushed past his {{chambers}} like one who {{no longer had a}} home. He was in the park now, and did not even notice that the Row was empty, that mighty round a deserted circus; management, riders, clowns, all the performers gone on their provincial tour, or nearly all, for a lady on horseback sees him, remembers to some extent who he is, and gives chase. It is our dear Mrs. Jerry.|$|R
60|$|Just at dusk, a soft September rain {{began to}} fall on the hop-pickers. The mothers wheeled the {{bouncing}} <b>perambulators</b> out of the gardens; bins were put away, and tally-books made up. The young couples strolled home, two to each umbrella, and the single men walked behind them laughing. Dan and Una, who had been picking after their lessons, marched off to roast potatoes at the oast-house, where old Hobden, with Blue-eyed Bess, his lurcher dog, lived all the month through, drying the hops.|$|R
60|$|Returning up the Broad Walk {{we have on}} {{our right}} the Baby Walk, which is so full of <b>perambulators</b> that you could cross {{from side to side}} {{stepping}} on babies, but the nurses won't let you do it. From this walk a passage called Bunting's Thumb, because it is that length, leads into Picnic Street, where there are real kettles, and chestnut-blossom falls into your mug as you are drinking. Quite common children picnic here also, and the blossom falls into their mugs just the same.|$|R
