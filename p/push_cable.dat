40|$|Recent {{advances}} in drilling technology have enabled wells reaching up to 10 km and beyond. Conventional intervention technology has limitations when {{reaching into the}} high deviated and long horizontal sections of these extended reach wells. This thesis presents {{a new type of}} material and technique that has been introduced to intervention applications the latest years - the composite intervention cable. The composite cable is lighter than the conventional steel wireline and has a higher strength, stiffness and electrical current transfer capability. One of the main benefits of the composite intervention cable is the high stiffness of the composite material, allowing a surface injector head to <b>push</b> the <b>cable</b> into the well and thereby eliminate the necessity of a well tractor. However, <b>pushing</b> the composite <b>cable</b> into the high deviated and long horizontal wells will cause helical buckling and lock-up. Axial oscillations and vibration can effectively reduce the friction forces that arise between the locked cable and the inner wall of the production pipe. Analyzing and testing the use of a vibration tool together with the composite intervention cable are therefore one of the main objectives of the thesis. To investigate the forces and stress involved in <b>pushing</b> the composite <b>cable</b> into a well and to further test the concept of using a vibration tool, a practical test model has been built. The results were used to address the advantages and limitations of the cable and the vibration tool and to utilize comparison with the simulation results. The test results show that the reach of the composite cable is limited by the friction forces that arise between the compressed cable and the inner wall of the production tubing. Therefore, lock-up should be set as the dimensional maximum axial force that could be applied to the cable. Further it is proven that axial vibration reduces the friction force between a locked cable and the inner wall of the production pipe. This permits a higher axial force to be transmitted through the system before lock-up again is reached. However, {{it is unlikely that the}} vibration tool alone is suffiecient to implement the use of a injector head to <b>push</b> the <b>cable</b> and PLT into the challenging highly deviated and horizointal wells. An advance in vibration technology and further development of well-tractors and injector heads could implement the composite intervention cable to help increase the recovery rate and further follow up latest advance in extended reach drilling, even into complex ultra-long wells. </p...|$|R
50|$|Connections {{are made}} by <b>pushing</b> the <b>cable's</b> plug into the female jack on the device. The signal-carrying pin {{protrudes}} from the plug, and often comes {{into contact with the}} socket before the grounded rings meet, resulting in loud hum or buzz if the audio components do not share a common ground and are powered while making connections. Continuous noise can occur if the plug partially falls out of the jack, breaking the ground connection but not the signal. Some variants of the plug, especially cheaper versions, also give very poor grip and contact between the ground sheaths due to their lack of spring action.|$|R

50|$|Cable jetting is {{the process}} of blowing a cable through a duct while {{simultaneously}} <b>pushing</b> the <b>cable</b> into the duct. Compressed air is injected at the duct inlet and flows through the duct and along the cable at high speed. (Preferably, no suction pig is used at the cable head.) The high speed air propels the cable due to drag forces and pressure drop. The friction of the cable against the duct is reduced by the distributed airflow, and large forces that would generate high friction are avoided. Because of the expanding airflow, the air propelling forces are relatively small at the cable inlet and large at the air exhaust end of the duct. To compensate for this, an additional pushing force is applied to the cable by the jetting equipment. The pushing force, acting mainly near the cable inlet, combined with the airflow propelling forces, increases the maximum jetting distance considerably. Special lubricants have been developed for cable jetting to further reduce friction.|$|R

40|$|Energising a coil {{results in}} a {{transverse}} force on the strands <b>pushing</b> the <b>cable</b> towards {{one side of the}} jacket. This load causes a transverse compressive strain in strands and in particular in strand crossover points. Besides this, contact surfaces interfere by micro-sliding resulting in friction and anomalous contact resistance behaviour versus force. Two Central Solenoid Model Coil conductors have been tested previously in a cryogenic press and now the experimental results are presented for the Toroidal Field Model Coil (TFMC) conductor (DP 4). The press can transmit a variable (cyclic) force of at least 650 kN/m directly to a cable section of 400 mm at 4. 2 K. The magnetisation of the conductor and the interstrand resistance (Rc) between various strands inside the cable can be measured by varying pressure. The force on the cable and the displacement are monitored simultaneously {{in order to determine the}} effective cable Young's modulus and the mechanical heat generation due to friction and deformation. The mechanical heat generation, the coupling loss time constant n¿ and the Rc of the full-size ITER TFMC conductor have been studied under load up to 40 full loading cycles.

40|$|The {{magnetic}} field and current of a coil wound with a cable-in-conduit conductor causes a transverse force <b>pushing</b> the <b>cable</b> {{to one side}} of the conduit. This load causes elastic and plastic deformation with friction as well as heating due to friction. A special cryogenic press has been built to study the mechanical and electrical properties of full-size ITER conductors under transverse mechanical loading. The cryogenic press can transmit at 4. 2 K cyclic forces of 650 kN/m to conductor sections of 400 mm length representative of the peak load on a 50 kA conductor at 13 T. In order to transmit the force directly onto the cable, the conduit is opened partly to allow the cable deformation. The force acting on the cable as well as the displacement are monitored simultaneously in order to determine the mechanical heat generation due to friction. The mechanical loss under load is investigated for the Nb 3 Sn, 45 kA, 10 and 13 T, central solenoid model cell conductors (CSMC). The mechanical heat generation is determined from the hysteresis in the measured curves of displacement versus applied force. The first results of the effect of some 40 loading cycles are presented and the two conductors are compared.

40|$|The {{magnetic}} field in a coil {{results in a}} transverse force on the strands <b>pushing</b> the <b>cable</b> towards {{one side of the}} jacket. A special cryogenic press has been built to study in a unique way the mechanical and electrical properties of full-size ITER Cable-in-Conduit (CIC) samples under a transverse, mechanical load. The press can transmit a variable (cyclic) force of at least 650 kN/m to a cable section of 400 mm at 4. 2 K. The jacket around the cable is partly opened in order to transmit the transverse force directly onto the cable. A superconducting dipole coil provides the AC {{magnetic field}} required to perform magnetisation measurements with pick-up coils.

The plastic casing began to be ripped apart as well as the cables causing the ride to come to a complete stop just over halfway up the tower. Because the electrical cables had been damaged, Cedar Point employees had to manually bring down the gondola. Riders were stuck on the ride for over an hour and no one was injured. WindSeeker at Cedar Point remained closed until the cause of the accident was found and fixed. The ride reopened on June 5, 2012.|$|R

Twenty six subjects were assessed in a CWT, fourteen men and twelve women. The CWT program was performed at six different intensities, 40 %, 50 %, 60 %, 70 %, 80 % and 85 % of 15 RM. Seven exercises made up the circuit: sitting bench press, leg press, lat pull down, shoulder press, hamstring curl, biceps curl, and triceps <b>cable</b> <b>push</b> downs. A polar heart rate monitor and a portable metabolic system were used to measure heart rate (HR), intensity measured relative to the HR reserve, cardiorespiratory variables, EE and EE relative to muscle mass (EEMM). Differences between genders were observed at the following variables: HR, intensity measured relative to the HR reserve (in percentage), VO 2, VCO 2, VE, RER, aerobic EE and EEMM. The EE was significantly higher in men during the six intensities, but differences did not exist for EEMM from 70 % to 85 %. In addition HR, load and body weight were used to predict intensity and two gender specific equations were obtained for men and women [I (%) = 57. 265 + 0. 512 HR - 0. 696 HRmax + 1. 035 Loadavg + 0. 188 Body Weight (R 2 = 0. 92; SEE= 4. 9 %) for men; I (%) = 4. 036 + 0. 412 HR% + 1. 667 Loadavg (R 2 = 0. 79; SEE= 7. 7 %) for women].

It is possible to combine inflatable’s with pre-stressed membranes to make “free-formed ” surfaces that are sinclastic and anticlastic. To elaborate the possibilities, columns, cables, and beams can be added. Columnspushing the membrane will introduce high points, cables pulling the membrane will introduce low points. The introduction of stiff, bent beams will influence the form of the surface as well as the cable structure covering the membrane.

40|$|If the Netherlands {{wishes to}} achieve an 80 % CO 2 {{reduction}} by the year 2050, technologies such as heat pumps and electric vehicles {{will be required to}} replace their fossil fuel burning counterparts. These technologies however have large consequences for electricity networks; not only will the amount of electricity transported over the networks increase, but so will the peak loads, <b>pushing</b> transformers and <b>cables</b> to their operating limits. This is a challenge that network operators are currently facing, and new methods are required to help them prepare for the future. In this thesis the flexibility of future energy technologies with the goal of limiting network loads in the Dutch low voltage electricity grid is investigated. ‘Flexibility’ refers to different variations, control strategies, and combinations of technologies that exist. Focus is placed on eight electric vehicle charging strategies and five types of electric heat pumps. Solar photovoltaics, electric hot water boilers, micro CHPs, and electric heaters as well as the effect of household insulation and thermostat setting are also investigated. The impact on the electricity grid is quantified by creating a testing environment in which the load of transformers and cables can be easily determined for any combination of market penetrations of the above technologies. Three representative low voltage networks are considered: A city, a village, and a countryside neighborhood. Calculations are carried out for a typical summer and winter day with 15 minute intervals. The technologies are modeled as Strand-Axelsson loads to take into account simultaneousness and accurately be able to predict the peak load of any number of users. The testing environment is validated by comparing the results to those obtained by Gaia, a software package specifically designed for carrying out electricity network calculations. Power demand profiles for all technologies are created using different modeling strategies. The electric vehicles are modeled based on mobility data of 50. 000 Dutch citizens. Eight control strategies are modeled, examples are: uncontrolled charging, night time charging, and vehicle to grid. To model space heating technologies a Matlab model has been constructed that accurately predicts the heat demand of a household taking into account factors such as household type, insulation, thermostat setting, and outdoor temperature. With the model the power demand profiles of heat pumps and other heaters are created by modeling their control strategies. The electric vehicle and heat pump profiles are verified by comparing the results to measured data obtained from Alliander. The power demand profiles are entered into the testing environment and simulations are carried out. The impact of each technology on transformer and cable loads is quantified and the effects of flexibility are investigated. It is found that uncontrolled use of heat pumps and electric vehicles present problems for the electricity network: market penetrations as low as 20 % could cause transformer loads to reach values above 100 %. Flexibility options however do exist and can be used effectively to limit network loads. Electric vehicles offer the most flexibility since the charging times are the easiest to control. Heating technologies have limited flexibility but improving household insulation and using the right thermostat settings can reduce network loads. Micro CHPs combine very well with other technologies and can be very effective at limiting the loads caused by both electric vehicles and heat pumps.
