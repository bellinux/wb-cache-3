We found genome-wide prevalence of polycistronic transcription in these Agaricomycetes, involving up to 8 % of the transcribed genes. Unlike polycistronic mRNAs in prokaryotes, these co-transcribed genes are also independently transcribed. We show that polycistronic transcription may interfere with expression of the downstream tandem gene.

40|$|Cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) TAV protein (TransActivator/Viroplasmin) plays {{a pivotal}} role during the {{infection}} cycle since it activates translation reinitiation of viral <b>polycistronic</b> <b>RNAs</b> and suppresses RNA silencing. It is also the major component of cytoplasmic electron-dense inclusion bodies (EDIBs) called viroplasms that are particularly evident in cells infected by the virulent CaMV Cabb B-JI isolate. These EDIBs are considered as virion factories, vehicles for CaMV intracellular movement and reservoirs for CaMV transmission by aphids. In this study, focused on different TAV mutants in vivo, we demonstrate that three physically separated domains collectively participate {{to the formation of}} large EDIBs: the N-terminal EKI motif, a sequence of the MAV domain involved in translation reinitiation and a C-terminal region encompassing the zinc finger. Surprisingly, EKI mutant TAVm 3, corresponding to a substitution of the EKI motif at amino acids 11 - 13 by three alanines (AAA), which completely abolished the formation of large viroplasms, was not lethal for CaMV but highly reduced its virulence without affecting the rate of systemic infection. Expression of TAVm 3 in a viral context led to formation of small irregularly shaped inclusion bodies, mild symptoms and low levels of viral DNA and particles accumulation, despite the production of significant amounts of mature capsid proteins. Unexpectedly, for CaMV-TAVm 3 the formation of viral P 2 -containing electron-light inclusion body (ELIB), which is essential for CaMV aphid transmission, was also altered, thus suggesting an indirect role of the EKI tripeptide in CaMV plant-to-plant propagation.

Using transient expression of FMV-derived polycistronic reporter constructs in Nicotiana edwardsonii cell suspension protoplasts, we further analyzed the cis-acting elements involved in polycistronic expression. A cis-acting element located within the first 74 nucleotides of the 7, 954 -nucleotide pregenomic RNA appears to be essential for P 6 to transactivate expression of an internal cistron. Expression of this internal cistron, {{in the presence of}} P 6, is greatly enhanced by the combined presence of two cis-acting elements located at the 3 ' end of the <b>polycistronic</b> <b>RNA.</b> Surprisingly, deletion of the most upstream of these two 3 ' cis-acting elements exposed a negative-acting element located internally on the <b>polycistronic</b> <b>RNA,</b> at the 3 ' end of open reading frame I.

40|$|The {{cauliflower}} mosaic virus reinitiation factor TAV interacts with host translation initiation factor 3 (eIF 3) and the 60 S ribosomal subunit to accomplish translation of polycistronic mRNAs. Interaction between TAV and eIF 3 g {{is critical for}} the reinitiation process. Here, we show that eIF 4 B can preclude formation of the TAV/eIF 3 complex via competition with TAV for eIF 3 g binding; indeed, the eIF 4 B- and TAV-binding sites on eIF 3 g overlap. Our data indicate that eIF 4 B interferes with TAV/eIF 3 / 40 S ribosome complex formation during the first initiation event. Consequently, overexpression of TAV in plant protoplasts affects only second initiation events. Transient overexpression of eIF 4 B in plant protoplasts specifically inhibits TAV-mediated reinitiation of a second ORF.

The majority of these genes are transcribed as polycistronic operons. Using primer extension RNA sequencing, in vitro capping and S 1 nuclease protection, I have determined 6 transcription start sites for operons of protein coding genes. These are found upstream of chlI, psbD, psbA, rpl 20, psbI and rpoB. Sequence upstream of the chlI, rpl 20 and rpoB genes resembles the bacterial - 10 and - 35 promoter consensus (TATAAT and TTGACA, respectively). Sequence upstream of psbD and psbI is divergent from the bacterial consensus possessing a T-hexamer in the - 35 position. The psbA promoter also has a - 10 element and an AT-rich stretch of nucleotides between - 14 to - 42. Additional promoters are located upstream of psbK and each 16 S copy. These promoters may be sufficient to drive transcription of the Euglena chloroplast genome. Transcription from the 8 known Euglena chloroplast promoters produces large <b>polycistronic</b> <b>RNAs</b> which are processed in the intercistronic regions to smaller rRNAs, tRNAs and mRNAs.

Using RNA blot hybridization I also determined that intercistronic processing of the psaA operon or the products of intercistronic processing are developmentally regulated. An unusual intercistronic processing event was determined by genomic and cDNA sequencing of the rps 4 -rps 11 dicistronic operon. These genes are not processed to monocistronic mRNAs, however, an intron located in the intercistronic region of rps 4 and rps 11 is spliced.

Monocistronic, bicistronic, and <b>polycistronic</b> <b>RNAs</b> synthesized in vitro by using SP 6 polymerase were translated in rabbit reticulocyte lysates with or without canine pancreatic microsomal membranes. The HXLF 1 or the HXLF 1 and HXLF 2 translation products were detected when the above mRNAs were used. The HXLF 3, HXLF 4, and HXLF 5 gene products were not detected by in vitro translation of the SP 6 -derived polycistronic mRNA. Nonglycosylated or glycosylated HXLF 1 and HXLF 2 gene products were immunoprecipitated by monoclonal antibody 9 E 10, which is specific for a virion envelope glycoprotein complex designated gcII (gp 47 - 52 complex). In addition, the monoclonal antibody 9 E 10 immunoprecipitated a diffuse glycoprotein band, designated gp 47 - 52, from HCMV-infected cell lysates. The amino acid composition of gp 47 - 52 purified from viron envelopes has the highest similarity to the predicted amino acid composition of the HXLF 1 plus HXLF 2 open reading frames, but it is more similar to HXLF 2 than to HXLF 1. The Northern blot results imply that gp 47 - 52 is synthesized predominantly from the abundant 1. 62 -kb bicistronic mRNA encoded by the HXLF 1 and HXLF 2 genes.

Transient expression of eIF 3 g and L 24 in plant protoplasts strongly affects TAV-mediated reinitiation activity. We demonstrate that TAV/eIF 3 / 40 S and eIF 3 /TAV/ 60 S ternary complexes form in vitro, and propose that TAV mediates efficient recruitment of eIF 3 to polysomes, allowing translation of polycistronic mRNAs by reinitiation, overcoming the normal cell barriers to this process...|$|E

L- 1 -tosylamido- 2 -phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone, a potent inhibitor of polypeptide chain initiation, was shown to preferentially inhibit the synthesis of cytoplasmic proteins and of histones at concentrations that permit continued amino acid incorporation into nuclear non-histone proteins. Comparisons of the molecular weight distributions of newly synthesized proteins in the presence and absence of L- 1 -tosylamido- 2 -phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone have revealed striking differences between nuclear anc cytoplasmic protein fractions. Differential effects on the synthesis of cytoplasmic proteins, acid-soluble nuclear proteins, and residual nuclear proteins have also been obtained with the antibiotic, pactamycin, another inhibitor of polypeptide chain initiation. The incorporation of radioactive amino acids into nuclear non-histone proteins shows resistance to inhibition by pactamycin, but is strongly inhibited by agents such as puromycin and cycloheximide which block chain elongation. The possibility that proliferating cells have developed specialized mechanisms for the coordinate synthesis of chromosomal proteins, possibly involving <b>polycistronic</b> messenger <b>RNAs,</b> is tested and discussed...|$|R
