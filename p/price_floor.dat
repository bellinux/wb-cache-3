25|$|The basic {{supply and}} demand model implies that by mandating a <b>price</b> <b>floor</b> above the {{equilibrium}} wage, minimum wage laws should cause unemployment. This is because {{a greater number of}} people are willing to work at the higher wage while a smaller number of jobs will be available at the higher wage. Companies can be more selective in those whom they employ thus the least skilled and least experienced will typically be excluded. An imposition or increase of a minimum wage will generally only affect employment in the low-skill labor market, as the equilibrium wage is already at or below the minimum wage, whereas in higher skill labor markets the equilibrium wage is too high for a change in minimum wage to affect employment.|$|E

40|$|This article {{assesses the}} {{long-term}} economic and climatic effects of introducing price caps and <b>price</b> <b>floors</b> in {{hypothetical global climate}} change mitigation policy. Based on emission trends, abatement costs and equilibrium climate sensitivity from IPCC and IEA reports, this quantitative analysis confirms that price caps could significantly reduce economic uncertainty. This uncertainty stems primarily from unpredictable economic growth and energy prices, and ultimately unabated emission trends. In addition, the development of abatement technologies is uncertain. Furthermore, this analysis shows that rigid targets may entail greater economic risks {{with little or no}} comparative advantage for the climate. More ambitious emission objectives, combined with price caps and <b>price</b> <b>floors,</b> could still entail significantly lower expected costs while driving similar, or even slightly better, climatic outcomes in probabilistic terms...|$|R
25|$|A {{minimum wage}} {{is the lowest}} {{remuneration}} that employers can legally pay their workers. Equivalently, it is the <b>price</b> <b>floor</b> below which workers may not sell their labor. Although minimum wage laws are in effect in many jurisdictions, differences of opinion exist about the benefits and drawbacks of a minimum wage. Supporters of the minimum wage say it increases {{the standard of living}} of workers, reduces poverty, reduces inequality, and boosts morale. In contrast, opponents of the minimum wage say it increases poverty, increases unemployment (particularly among unskilled or inexperienced workers) and is damaging to businesses, because excessively high minimum wages require businesses to raise the prices of their product or service to accommodate the extra expense of paying a higher wage.|$|E
2500|$|A firm's cost is an {{increasing}} function of the wage rate, the higher the wage rate, the fewer hours an employer will demand of employees. This is because, as the wage rate rises, it becomes more expensive for firms to hire workers and so firms hire fewer workers (or hire them for fewer hours). The demand of labor curve is therefore shown as a line moving down and to the right. Since higher wages increase the quantity supplied, the supply of labor curve is upward sloping, and is shown as a line moving up and to the right. [...] If no minimum wage is in place, wages will adjust until quantity of labor demanded is equal to quantity supplied, reaching equilibrium, where the supply and demand curves intersect. Minimum wage behaves as a classical <b>price</b> <b>floor</b> on labor. Standard theory says that, if set above the equilibrium price, more labor {{will be willing to}} be provided by workers than will be demanded by employers, creating a surplus of labor, i.e. unemployment. The basic economic model of markets predicts the same of other commodities (like milk and wheat, for example): Artificially raising the price of the commodity tends to cause the supply of it to increase and the demand for it to lessen. The result is a surplus of the commodity. When there is a wheat surplus, the government buys it. Since the government does not hire surplus labor, the labor surplus takes the form of unemployment, which tends to be higher with minimum wage laws than without them.|$|E

We build a simple dynamic model of double auction markets with "zero-intelligence" (ZI) computer traders that accounts for many, though not all, of the discrepancies between the data and the Walrasian tatonnement predictions.

50|$|This {{criticism}} has face validity. In future phases, {{measures such as}} banking of allowances and <b>price</b> <b>floors</b> {{may be used to}} mitigate volatility.

5000|$|Previously, <b>price</b> <b>floors</b> in {{agriculture}} have been common around Europe.

40|$|Keywords There {{has been}} a wide {{discussion}} on the different properties between carbon taxes, cap-and-trade schemes and hybrid instruments such as cap-and-trade schemes with <b>price</b> <b>floors</b> and ceilings. There has been less discussion on the incentives to investment {{that each of these}} instruments may provide. We build a three-period model to investigate the incentives offered to a large firm with diversified abatement options from such instruments when facing a choice between investing in lowcarbon technologies with potential learning benefits. We parameterise our model for a system similar to the EUETS and for two sample technologies, biomass for electricity and coal with carbon capture and storage. For both technologies we find that cap-and-trade schemes generate greater mean returns to such an investment than taxes, but with a wider distribution. We find that introducing <b>price</b> <b>floors</b> increase such mean returns while reducing the distribution, while ceilings further reduce the distribution, but also the mean and thus the overall incentives they offer will depend on the risk preference of the firm and scale of investment in relation to overall compliance costs.

5000|$|Responsiveness to recessions: This {{point is}} closely related to {{responsiveness}} to cost changes, because recessions cause a drop in demand. Under cap and trade, the emissions cost automatically decreases, so a cap-and-trade scheme adds another automatic stabilizer to the economy - in effect, an automatic fiscal stimulus. However, a lower pollution price also results in reduced efforts to reduce pollution. If the government is able to stimulate the economy regardless of the cap-and-trade scheme, an excessively low price causes a missed opportunity to cut emissions faster than planned. Instead, it might be better to have a <b>price</b> <b>floor</b> (a tax). This is especially true when cutting pollution is urgent, as with greenhouse gas emissions. A <b>price</b> <b>floor</b> also provides certainty and stability for investment in emissions reductions: recent experience from the UK shows that nuclear power operators are reluctant to invest on [...] "un-subsidised" [...] terms unless there is a guaranteed <b>price</b> <b>floor</b> for carbon (which the EU emissions trading scheme does not presently provide).|$|E
