Its aim is {{to show how the}} <b>pre-trial</b> <b>procedures</b> of Saudi Arabia could be re-designed in order to conform to both the standards set by international human rights and the norms of Shari’ah law and argues that there is much common ground between the two. It addresses the human rights relevant to <b>pre-trial</b> <b>procedures</b> and explores in-depth how these are expressed in international human rights legislation and in the current legislation of England and Wales with particular reference to the Police and Criminal Evidence Act (1984). They are contrasted with the relevant articles of the Code of Criminal Procedure 2001 (CCP) of Saudi Arabia. Individual rights such as the right to liberty, the right silence, the right to privacy, the right to bail and the right to an effective remedy are examined in depth and relevant case law is cited throughout. The history of <b>pre-trial</b> <b>procedures</b> and regulations in England and Wales and Saudi Arabia is explored in order to understand how these have developed into what exists today. The former is traced from the Norman period to the present day and the latter from the pre-Islamic era of the Arabian Peninsula. The actual practice of these procedures is explored comparatively through a fieldwork project involving semi-structured interviews with police officers and lawyers in England and police officers, police officers, prosecutors and lawyers in Saudi Arabia. The thesis ends with a thorough examination of how <b>pre-trial</b> <b>procedures</b> in Saudi Arabia could be regulated and monitored so as to bring them in line with the standards required by international human rights legislation and international practice and with the demands of Islamic law...|$|R

40|$|The author {{analyses}} {{changes to}} Slovenian criminal procedure between 1994, {{when the first}} Slovenian code was adopted {{on the basis of}} the last consistent Yugoslavian model (enacted in 1967) to the present day. Thirteen amendments have already been made to the Code since 1994, and the author argues that it is the role of public prosecutor which has changed the most in this period: prosecutors are slowly but surely becoming the dominus litis of <b>pre-trial</b> <b>procedure,</b> thereby pushing the investigating judge ever further towards the role of a pre-trial judge and away from that of an inquisitorial investigator. This trend has been accompanied by a tendency to abolish the phase of judicial investigation completely and to introduce a unitary preliminary phase of criminal procedure led by the prosecutor. The basic principle of Slovenian procedure is still the so-called inquisitorial maxim, which therefore places it among other European inquisitorial systems, but gradually more adversarial solutions are being incorporated. Key examples of this trend are: the solution granting the suspect the right to be acquainted with his rights in the moment when the investigation becomes focused on him/her; in the introduction of selection mechanisms; in the adversarial model of a decision-making process of ordering investigating and coercive measures and consequently in the stronger activation of both parties at an earlier stage. The peak of this trend can be found in the introduction of plea negotiations. Increasingly, we see the adoption of legal solutions which put the defendant and the prosecutor in ever more active roles, making them more autonomous subjects with the power to resolve cases quicker than before, while the court becomes more passive, shrinking to the much more limited role of controlling their agreements. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a {{critical analysis of}} the current human rights protection for suspects {{in the criminal justice}} system of China, evaluating them from the view of international human rights law and practice, in particular, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights(ICCPR) and European Convention of Human Rights(ECHR). The theme that runs through the paper is whether the right to fair trial is practically and adequately available to the suspect in China according to the established international standards. The hypothesis is that by addressing the distance between the Chinese system and international standards on the issue of human rights protection for suspects in the pre-trail criminal procedure, and the causes for this distance, the direction of further reform for criminal justice system will become clearer and more practical. The ultimate purpose of this paper is to consider how to handle the relationship between crime control and human rights protection, when the crime rates in China have generally been rising along with the high-speed economic development in recent years. Before outlining the performance of China, this paper considers the current understanding and interpretation of the relevant standards in ICCPR and ECHR. Extensive consideration is then given to weigh criminal procedure law and its practice in China against those international standards in a new detailed part. Taking into account the highly influential effects of China’s traditional legal culture and special social situation, the paper is devoted to investigate four most pressing issues regarding the continuing Chinese criminal justice reform on the <b>pre-trial</b> <b>procedure</b> in different chapters: guiding ideologies and basic principles, the pre-trial compulsory measures system, prevention of the use of illegal evidence obtained through torture and the right to legal counsel before trial. This comprehensive examination shows the significant progress regarding fair trial rights for suspects China has made in meeting international standards set in ICCPR, in particular the Criminal Procedure Law of 1996. The barriers and challenges that impair the criminal procedural rights for suspects and impede the proper enforcement of the existing criminal justice system to come in line with international standards are also highlighted with possible suggestions of improvements. These problems root in current social, cultural and institutional conditions under which the criminal justice system operates, including difficulties in changing the traditional ideology, the deficiencies and failure with the law itself for certain issues, the incorrect and ineffective enforcement of the law, and a severe shortage of professionally qualified judges, prosecutors, police and lawyers. As a result, the practices in human rights violation against suspects that subsequent reforms have been trying to eradicate still remain in the Chinese criminal justice system. The thesis concludes with the allegation that the introduction of some key rights into Chinese criminal justice system to provide greater protection to its suspects for preventing possible stage power abuse is a step in the right direction, but further procedural safeguards are necessary to ensure an effective rebalance of China’s criminal justice system. Apart from improving its legal system to fully comply with international human rights standard, the reform must fit within the Chinese culture and way of life. Therefore, the government must consider further actions to address and develop the cultural and social conditions of the Chinese criminal justice system.

40|$|The unmet {{demand for}} legal aid {{generally}} and for criminal law matters in particular, {{has grown in}} tandem with the expansion of crime control and increased restrictions on funding for publicly funded welfare and support services. This article examines the connection between legal aid, legal representation and the right to a fair trial.

It then compares the Victorian courts&# 039; approach to a fair trial with the tenets of current European Court of Human Rights jurisprudence regarding the scope and timing of an accused person&# 039;s right to access a lawyer. The comparison underlines the narrow definition of fair trial under Victorian common law, relative to Europe, where a fair trial is interpreted more broadly to include the right to legal representation during police and pre-trial investigations.

40|$|LL. D. The Constitution of the Republic of South Africa 108 of 1996 {{provides}} in Section 34 {{that everyone}} {{has the right to}} have any dispute that can be resolved by the application of law decided in a fair public hearing before court, or where appropriate, another independent and impartial tribunal or forum. A fair civil trial that includes a fair judgment can only be achieved if the parties to the action receive fair treatment throughout all the stages of the proceedings. Obviously the concept "trial" cannot be given a narrow interpretation. There can hardly be mention of a "fair trial" if the processes that precede the trial since commencement of the litigation cannot also be construed as fair. In providing the procedures whereby a fair civil trial is facilitated, apart from providing effective mechanisms for the enforcement of substantive rights and obligations, the interrelated concepts of time, effectiveness and costs are pivotal. In an attempt to secure a fair civil trial, the preparation for trial stage plays a very important role. It is, however, a reality of the South African litigation milieu that hundreds of cases are postponed on a daily basis as a result of problems that are related to specific pretrial procedures. The indications that the pre-trial procedures per se need to be revised and where necessary, be reformed, are consequently rife. There is also no comprehensive procedural structure in place in South African law in terms of which the parties can co-operate in order to effectively facilitate pre-trial preparation. An aspect of the <b>pre-trial</b> <b>procedure</b> that often leads to delay and unnecessary escalation of costs is the excessive amount of party control (or lack thereof) during the preparation for trial stage. Pivotal to reform of the pre-trial procedures is thus the question whether it serves any purpose to leave this stage to the "mercy of the parties". It can hardly be argued that retaining the element of surprise as part of a strict adversary litigation character yields any real advantage. Legal reform is not a process that can be undertaken in vacuo and any attempts at reform in the preparation for trial stage must consequently bear the following considerations in mind: costs, delay, the degree of complexity of procedures, formulation, time limits and sanctions, the impact of the principle of fairness, the impact of party control and circumstances peculiar to a particular legal system. It is furthermore important that such reform should be undertaken in accordance with an expressly declared ethos. Where there is no clear congruence between the reform ethos and the needs of a specific legal system it will inevitably lead to reform which, although it may be new, might not necessarily address and improve existing problems. Legal reform, even if it is of limited scope, should always be a logical, purposive process. In this respect comparative study of Anglo- American systems are invaluable. It is of great importance that individual pre-rial procedures should be reformed in order to facilitate cost and time effective preparation for trial. Various problems exist in respect of discovery and attention should urgently be given to the lack of uniformity between the High Courts and the Magistrates Court, the non-compulsory nature of the procedure, the effectiveness of time limits and sanctions, the wording of the rule and the question whether the concept "document" should be elaborated upon. Provision should also be made in the South African Law of Civil Procedure for exchange of witness statements prior to trial. Exchange of expert evidence ought also to be reformed in order to address the problematic time aspect, the obligation to give notice, the contents of the summary, the discussion between experts and the lack of sanctions prior to the trial date. Reform of the pretrial conference should also be undertaken in order to emphasize its legitimate place as a stocktaking procedure prior to trial. It is furthermore necessary to address the problems regarding the pre-trial conference that relate to the lack of uniformity in the High Court and Magistrate's Court, the attitude of the legal profession, the stage at which the conference must be held, the question regarding who should preside at the conference and the lack of effective sanctions. Reform of the individual pre-trial procedures, whether piecemeal or as a comprehensive once-off reform, is, however, per se not sufficient to ensure a level of trial preparation that will eventually lead to a fair civil trial. The individual pre-trial procedures are separate though interrelated links that can only fulfill their purpose if the greater more holistic approach to civil procedure gives structured recognition to orderly, time and cost effective litigation. It is, therefore, essential that the individual pre-trial procedures should function within the framework of a case management system that can {{play a significant role in}} achieving the ideal of a constitutionally fair civil trial in that it establishes a coordinated and procedurally fair preparation for trial stage. The eventual success of such reform will, apart form the provision of effective individual pre-trial procedures and an effective case management model, also depend on the materialization of a sufficient budget to create an infrastructure of computers and trained personnel as well as a mentality shift on the part of lawyers in order to discard their old adversary cloak in exchange for more effective transparant litigation and eventually, a fair civil trial...|$|E

40|$|The {{exercise}} of police powers {{is subject to}} rules and guidelines, and the event of police powers has occasioned considerable controversy {{since the inception of}} the 'new police'. On the one hand, the police clearly need powers to stop people on the street if they are suspected of a crime, to enter people's houses if they suspect that they are hiding stolen goods or firearms and to arrest people they suspect of a crime. They {{need to be able to}} interview suspects in the police station and may have to hold suspects in cells. On the other hand, individual citizens need to be able to carry on with their everyday lives without risking being stopped on the streets, having their homes ransacked by the police and being arrested and taken to the police station. Suspects must be protected from torture, brutality and the extraction of false confessions. Special protection may be afforded to vulnerable groups such as the young and mentally ill. Legislation on police powers, therefore, must balance conflicting needs. Saudi Arabia the Stop, Arrest, Detention and Custody Regulation (SADC) was set up in 1983. The regulation provided powers relating to stop and search, arrest, detention. interviewing, and the investigation of crimes It seeks to protect suspects from the abuse of such powers by granting to suspects certain rights and protections. In practice, however, the balance between the use of the powers and suspects' rights is different. The police appear to exceed their powers as they provided and the safeguards are ignored. Therefore, the question is, how do the <b>pre-trial</b> <b>procedures</b> work in practice? No research has been done to examine the pre-trial process in practice in Saudi Arabia.

In both countries, the daily practice of the key players in both criminal justice systems continues to shift as the result of ever-increasing resource constraints and a varied array of organizational incentives. These shifts have created areas of both convergence and divergence. On the one-hand, in an era in both countries in which the number of cases resolved through a full-fledged public trial is decreasing, the course of pre-trial practice has become more outcome-determinative. Faced with a heavy caseload, a German prosecutor who receives a file in which the initial facts appear to be weak, may dismiss the case right out of the gate. On the other hand, carrying the mantle of a “party” rather than as an “organ of justice,” an American prosecutor who views the same investigation file {{may be more likely to}} seek some level of conviction through a plea agreement. Viewed solely through the goal of “finding the truth,” the shortened investigation process in both cases raises questions about whether the outcome fulfilled the retributive and rehabilitative objectives of the criminal law. On the other hand, in an era of tight resources, both outcomes appear to efficiently resolve the dispute at issue. In both cases, the shortened process also impacts, and perhaps undercuts, the traditional role of the fact-finder, be it a jury in the United States or a German judicial panel. Consequently, in many cases, bureaucrats in both countries are functioning as the arbiters of justice rather than simply as the head of the investigation process. This shift in institutional roles casts doubt on the degree to which the normative vision underlying each system’s path to “truth” informs prosecutors’ practice routines. By highlighting this development, this chapter will explore the widening disconnect between the law in action and these two normative visions of the truth-finding process. I then describe how some facets of pre-trial practice in both in both countries today undermine the objective to find the truth. After highlighting these problematic features, I suggest that the way to right the ship is, not to strengthen the law, but to more closely examine the organizational incentives that guide prosecutorial decision-making today...|$|R
5000|$|The third-year program {{consists}} {{primarily of}} the School's Practice Court Program. Practice Court traces its roots {{to the original}} School, and was returned in 1922 shortly after the School was reinstituted. Though Practice Court is designed primarily for students who will practice law before the courts; it is mandatory for all students. Practice Court consists of four classes. The first three classes (Professional Responsibility, Practice Court I: <b>Pre-Trial</b> Practice and <b>Procedure,</b> and Practice Court II: Trial Evidence, Procedure, and Practice) must {{be taken as a}} package within a quarter (and students cannot be enrolled in any other courses during that quarter); Practice Court III: Trial and Post-Trial Practice, Procedure, and Evidence must be taken immediately thereafter in the following quarter (and though students may take electives, any elective cannot be in a class scheduled after 2:15 pm). [...] The Practice Court program covers not only mock trials but all aspects of the law and <b>procedure</b> process from <b>pre-trial</b> preparation to post-verdict motions.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{analyses}} {{whether any}} {{changes to the}} current scope {{of the death penalty}} in either Australia or Singapore invite consideration or whether the respective regimes are grounded in sound principle. Both countries have been selected as they are at opposing ends of the death penalty spectrum, being abolitionist and retentionist respectively. One major issue reoccurring in various jurisdictions is an innocent accused being wrongfully convicted of a crime. Human institutions such as a country’s criminal justice system are fallible. Countries like Singapore that have a more ‘weighted’ approach towards Herbert Packer’s ‘crime control model’ must try to strike a balance with the ‘due process model’ to prevent the occurrences of wrongful convictions. Given the irreversible nature of capital punishment, this paper contends that an accused charged for a capital offence must be provided their fundamental rights, such as the right to access to counsel and the right to silence. The thesis also emphasizes the importance of <b>pre-trial</b> investigative <b>procedures,</b> such as the video-recording of suspect statements during police questioning or the preservation of DNA samples, to protect innocent individuals. Mandatory sentencing itself is subject to various problems. These issues may be amplified when the mandatory death sentence is concern. Therefore, the thesis contends that the mandatory death sentence does not deter (or only marginally deters) crimes as many retentionist States recognize. However, parliamentary sovereign nations, like Singapore, have the right to determine its criminal laws. The current state of international law does not totally prohibit the imposition of capital punishment. By considering the community’s perception of capital punishment in both jurisdictions, this paper finally discusses two issues; (1) whether {{the current state of the}} law in Australia allows it to reintroduce the death penalty if it desires to, and (2) whether the amendments in Singapore’s death penalty regime in 2012 signal the possible abolition of the punishment...|$|R

Chapter three is divided into three sections, each section contains various parts. Part one and two in the first section concentrate on examining those crimes of killing that are committed by a group of people, who either directly or indirectly participated in the crime. The effect of circumstances of insanity, infancy and intoxication, on annulling criminal responsibility has been comprehensively discussed in the second section. The last section of this chapter focuses on examining the effect of certain extenuating circumstances, such as self-defence and defence of honour, upon criminal liability. Chapter four deals with the contemporary Saudi pre-trial criminal proceedings relevant to crimes of killing. The first section of this chapter comprises six parts. The discussion in these parts focuses upon the legal procedure of examining suspects, searching of private premises, and the rights of suspect during this stage of police investigation. Section two deals with the <b>pre-trial</b> legal <b>procedure</b> following the detection of crimes of killing. It also covers the legal process of pre-trial detention, release proceedings, and the rights of the detained person. Chapter five embodies three sections which provide a comprehensive discussion to the trial proceeding and the consequent procedure after the trial. This includes: the Saudi courts system; the rule of evidence for proving criminal cases; the procedures of hearing cases of crimes of killing; the rights of the accused during this stage; and the ensuing legal process required to implement the judgement...|$|R
