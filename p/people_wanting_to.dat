5|$|By {{the early}} 1970s, there {{remained}} only 40 Mérens horses {{registered in the}} breed studbook. The breed was saved from extinction by utopian communities believing in an ecological apocalypse. As part of the hippie movement, <b>people</b> <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> live {{on the fringe of}} society settled in the small villages of Ariege. They boosted the local economy, including encouraging the resumption of the breeding of Mérens. At the same time, the story of the semi-feral horse Bonbon became a local phenomenon. This Mérens, orphaned following an accident, was raised on bottle-fed goat milk. He was then sold to a horse-dealer before later returning to his homeland and winning prizes as a stallion. He died at twenty, having returned to his herd high in the mountains.|$|E
5|$|The Brick Lane {{screening}} – on 8 December 1995 – {{had been}} previewed in NME, and was chaotically busy. It was originally planned {{for a car}} park, but freezing conditions and snow forced a rethink and the screening was moved indoors, to {{the basement of the}} nearby Seven Stars pub. Hundreds of people crammed in to watch the screening, which was eventually abandoned partway through due to the cramped conditions. The NME preview had claimed that after the screening the film would be cut up and individual frames sold off to the public. Gimpo, the owner of the film, had no intention of doing so, but after the screening was nearly overwhelmed by a mob of <b>people</b> <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> take home a piece of the film.|$|E

5|$|The first {{bridge on}} the site was a toll bridge built by Julian Tolmé in 1873, in the {{expectation}} that the western terminus of the Hammersmith and City Railway would shortly be built on the north bank, leading to {{a sharp increase in}} the number of <b>people</b> <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> cross the river at this point. The railway terminus was not built, and problems with drainage on the approach road made access to the bridge difficult for vehicles. Wandsworth Bridge was commercially unsuccessful, and in 1880 it was taken into public ownership and made toll-free. Tolmé's bridge was narrow and too weak to carry buses, and in 1926 a Royal Commission recommended its replacement.|$|E

Beginning around 1897, as Irving was in decline, Stoker had depended increasingly on his writing for money.

While Stoker is known today for Dracula, he wrote seventeen other novels as well as many short stories and pieces for periodicals.|$|E

25|$|The {{exterior}} {{shots of}} the Kelly house were filmed using a miniature model constructed by British artist and designer Mike Worrall. Recording of the exteriors took place in-studio {{over the course of}} a two-day period, undergoing a range of lighting situations to re-create various weather conditions and times of day. Producers often found themselves taking phone calls from <b>people</b> <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> know the address of the house, with the hope of purchasing it and moving in. After the series ended, the model was stored by the producers, as no museums were able to take it at the time. However, the model eventually disintegrated while in storage, and is no longer in existence.|$|E

25|$|The Buddhist {{movement}} chose {{a moderate}} ascetic lifestyle. This was {{in contrast to}} Jains, who continued the tradition of stronger austerity, such as fasting and giving away all property including clothes and thus going naked, emphasizing that complete dedication to spirituality includes turning away from material possessions and any cause for evil karma. The moderate ascetic precepts, states Collins, likely appealed to more people and widened the base of <b>people</b> <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> become Buddhists. Buddhism also developed a code for interaction of world-pursuing lay people and world-denying Buddhist monastic communities, which encouraged continued relationship between the two. Collins states, for example, that two rules of the vinaya (monastic code) were that a person could not join a monastic community without parent's permission, and {{that at least one}} son remained with each family to care for that family. Buddhism also combined the continuing interaction, such as giving alms to renunciants, in terms of merit gained for good rebirth and good karma by the lay people. This code played a historic role in its growth, and provided a means for reliable alms (food, clothing) and social support for Buddhism.|$|E

[...] Wen noted that [...] "The connection is there, but it’s also very tenuous at this point, because S.H.I.E.L.D. has become so isolated with what’s going on with the Avengers and them not knowing still that Coulson is alive." [...] On how the themes of Civil War allowed the series to make more of a philosophical tie-in than with previous films, Whedon stated that [...] "we do have people across the globe who have powers on our show and there would be varying reactions to that. A lot of fear, some excitement, some <b>people</b> <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> use it for good, some <b>people</b> <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> use it for evil.
