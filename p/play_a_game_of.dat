5|$|Bertie the Brain was {{an early}} {{computer}} game, {{and one of the}} first games developed in the early history of video games. It was built in Toronto by Josef Kates for the 1950 Canadian National Exhibition. The four meter tall computer allowed exhibition attendees to <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>game</b> <b>of</b> tic-tac-toe against an artificial intelligence. The player entered a move on a lit keypad in the form of a three-by-three grid, and the game played out on a grid of lights overhead. The machine had an adjustable difficulty level. After two weeks on display by Rogers Majestic, the machine was disassembled at the end of the exhibition and largely forgotten as a curiosity.|$|E
5|$|Chess {{strategy}} {{consists of}} setting and achieving long-term positioning advantages during the game– for example, {{where to place}} different pieces– while tactics concentrate on immediate maneuver. These {{two parts of the}} chess-playing process cannot be completely separated, because strategic goals are mostly achieved through tactics, while the tactical opportunities are based on the previous strategy of <b>play.</b> <b>A</b> <b>game</b> <b>of</b> chess is normally divided into three phases: opening, typically the first 10 moves, when players move their pieces to useful positions for the coming battle; then middlegame; and last the endgame, when most of the pieces are gone, kings typically take a more active part in the struggle, and pawn promotion is often decisive.|$|E
5|$|In the 1980s, Scott Armstrong {{attempted}} to convince Edward Bennett Williams, then {{the owner of}} the Baltimore Orioles, to <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>game</b> <b>of</b> Cuban All-Stars against his Orioles. Williams declined, as he had a position on an advisory board in the Reagan Administration, which opposed having any business with Cuba. Armstrong discussed the idea with MLB Commissioner Bart Giamatti and MLB Players Association (MLBPA) chair Donald Fehr. Though Giamatti was interested, he died before he could pursue the idea. Fehr visited Cuba during the 1994-95 MLB strike, but could not secure an antitrust exemption.|$|E

5|$|The Nimrod, {{built in}} the United Kingdom by Ferranti for the 1951 Festival of Britain, was an early {{computer}} custom-built to play a computer game, {{one of the first}} games developed in the early history of video games. The twelve-by-nine-by-five-foot (3.7-by-2.7-by-1.5-metre) computer, designed by John Makepeace Bennett and built by engineer Raymond Stuart-Williams, allowed exhibition attendees to <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>game</b> <b>of</b> Nim against an artificial intelligence. The player pressed buttons on a raised panel corresponding with lights on the machine to select their moves, and the Nimrod moved afterward, with its calculations represented by more lights. The speed of the Nimrod's calculations could be slowed down to allow the presenter to demonstrate exactly what the computer was doing, with more lights showing the state of the calculations. The Nimrod was intended to demonstrate Ferranti's computer design and programming skills rather than to entertain, though Festival attendees were more interested in playing the game than the logic behind it. After its initial exhibition in May, the Nimrod was shown for three weeks in October 1951 at the Berlin Industrial Show before being dismantled.|$|E

5|$|Once, Khandoba and Mhalsa <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>game</b> <b>of</b> saripat (translated as game of dice or chess). Khandoba loses {{everything}} to Mhalsa in the wager, except his dhoti, his flag, his staff (wand) and his bhandari, {{the bag of}} magical bhandara (turmeric powder). In a dream, he sees Banai and {{falls in love with}} her. He goes on a hunt in the forest, gets away from the army and stays with Banai for twelve years. He marries her in non-ritualistic marriage and brings her back to Jejuri. A variant describes how Khandoba arrives in Chandanpur on a hunting expedition and becomes thirsty. A Dhangar directs him to Banai's vada. Banai offers him water or sends a pot of water, in which Khandoba reads Banai's name. In another version, the pot with nine jewels is a sign for Khandoba to recognise Banai, the girl he saw in his dream. He falls for her and loses purposefully in saripat with Mhalsa and accepts a twelve-year exile. In this period, he disguises himself as an impoverished, old leper and becomes a man-servant of Banai's father. Some folk songs have erotic overtones, for example, some songs give erotic descriptions of Banai's beauty which maddens Khandoba.|$|E

Hua Tuo offers to anaesthetise Guan Yu, but he simply laughs and {{says that he is}} not afraid of pain. Hua Tuo uses a knife to cut the flesh from Guan Yu's arm and scrape the poison from the bone, and the sounds strike fear into all those who heard them. During this excruciating treatment, Guan Yu continues to <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>game</b> <b>of</b> weiqi with Ma Liang without flinching from pain. When Ma Liang asks him later, Guan Yu says that he feigned being unhurt to keep the morale of his troops high.

Although Hua Tuo historically died in 208, a decade before Guan Yu fought at the Battle of Fancheng, this story of him performing surgery on Guan Yu has become a popular artistic theme.|$|E
