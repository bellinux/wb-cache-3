40|$|ABSTRACT: There are 61 {{species in}} 14 {{families}} of fish-eating birds in Iran. The fish-eating birds {{of the north}} of Iran belong to 41 species in 10 families which include 67. 2 percent of total fish eating bird species and 71 % of fish-eating bird’s family of Iran. Resident birds constitute 13 % of the fish-eating birds of the Caspian Sea coasts and the rest are migratory in autumn and winter. There exist 3 globally threatened species of fish-eating birds of {{the world at the}} north of Iran, which are Oxyura leucocephala, Phalacrocorax pygmeus, and <b>Pelecanus</b> <b>crispus</b> wintering in the south coast wetlands of the region. Seventeen percent of the fish-eating birds of the north of Iran are aquatic, 5 % terrestrial and 78 % wadding. The Phalacrocorax carbo and Phalacrocorax pygmeus are wintering and breeding migratory in the wetlands of the region, which feed in the fish ponds and wetlands. The main habitats of fish-eating birds are Miankaleh and Amirkelayeh wildlife refuge, Anzaly marsh and Gomishan Ramsar Sites. Oxyura lecucephala, Phalacrocorax pygmeus and <b>Pelecanus</b> <b>crispus</b> are protected species in Iran and the rest are not allowed to be eaten by Islamic rule, for the same reason they are not being threatened by Muslim men...|$|R

30|$|During 1982 to 2012, the 28 most {{abundant}} waterbird species {{were included in}} the time series dataset and were grouped into two main categories: waterfowl and their allies (19 species, including ducks, coots, grebes, pelicans, cormorants, herons and egrets, spoonbills and flamingos) and waders (9 species, including Recurvirostridae, Charadriidae and Scolopacidae). All 28 species were present during the whole time series (since 1982; 31  years), with the exception of Dalmatian pelican <b>Pelecanus</b> <b>crispus</b> (since 1984; 29  years), greater flamingo Phoenicopterus roseus (since 1988; 25  years) and pied avocet Recurvirostra avosetta (since 1985; 28  years), with no missing values after the first occurrence. Species excluded from the analysis occurred in low numbers (less than 50 individuals in any year) and during a few years (less than 20 wintering seasons).

For 9 - 12 species, physical destruction of their habitat was involved and, for 3 - 5 species, pollution probably played a part. Five species have returned to the area; these are doing very well. Three species may return through expansion of populations elsewhere. Anadromous fish and demersal fish species that have disappeared because of bottom-trawling in the North Sea have little chance of returning under the present conditions.

5000|$|The {{trumpeter swan}} {{is the largest}} extant species of waterfowl. Adults usually measure 138 - 165 cm long, though large males can exceed 180 cm in total length. The weight of adult birds is {{typically}} 7 - 13.6 kg. Possibly due to seasonal variation based on food access and variability due to age, average weights in males {{have been reported to}} range from 10.9 to 12.7 kg and from 9.4 to 10.3 kg in females.

40|$|Realistic {{population}} size estimates for waterbirds are {{crucial for the}} application of wetland conservation strategies, since the identification of internationally important wetlands is based on local numbers relative to the {{population size}} of the respective species. Central Asia is a poorly surveyed region that is situated at the intersection of migration routes that lead waterbirds from Western Siberia to the south-west (South-West Asia, East Africa) and to the south-east (South Asia, India). We calculated waterbird population estimates for the Tengiz-Korgalzhyn region, a large wetland complex in the steppe zone of Central Kazakhstan, based on waterbird surveys conducted between 1999 and 2004. For 20 of 43 species analysed the region supported more than 5 % of the relevant flyway populations. Five species occurred with more than 40 % of the flyway totals, including the Endangered White-headed Duck Oxyura leucocephala and the Vulnerable Dalmatian Pelican <b>Pelecanus</b> <b>crispus.</b> Peak numbers were recorded in summer and autumn and for most species numbers were more than an order of magnitude lower on spring migration compared with autumn migration. We identified 72 individual sites that held more than 20, 000 waterbirds or more than 1 % of a particular flyway population at least once. These sites are likely to constitute priorities for conservation. The general conservation status of the region is favourable, since many of the important sites are located within a strict nature reserve.

40|$|We {{report a}} new fossil {{specimen}} of a pelican from the Tatrot Formation of the Siwalik Hills, India. It likely represents Pelecanus sivalensis Davies, 1880, the smaller {{of the two}} previously published species from the Siwalik Group stratigraphic sequence. This complete tarsometatarsus is the first fossil bone of a pelican collected in India for over 100 years. It is from the latest Pliocene (∼ 2. 6 Ma), and is the youngest pelican fossil from the region. The new specimen exhibits a derived distoplantar 'slant' to the plantar margin of the medial crest of the hypotarsus, and a combination of features related to the morphology of the hypotarsus, the distal foramen, trochleae, and overall size that allow further differentiation from known tarsometatarsi of fossil and extant pelicans, including the three species of extant pelicans that occur in India (<b>Pelecanus</b> <b>crispus,</b> P. onocrotalus, and P. philippensis). It is of appropriate size for Pelecanus sivalensis, which to date has been known only by fragments of other skeletal elements of the wing, leg, and shoulder girdle. Thus, the observation that this tarsometatarsus is morphologically distinct from those of known pelicans provides further support for the distinctiveness {{of at least one}} extinct species of pelican from the Siwalik Group sediments. While the morphology of the tarsometatarsus allows for separation from other taxa known from tarsometatarsi, we found no clear shared derived states to place this taxon with any confidence in a phylogenetic context relative to any other pelican species, or even determine if {{it is part of the}} crown group of Pelecanidae. However, published molecular data are consistent with an origin of the crown clade prior to the Pleistocene, suggesting (along with one morphological character) the possibility that this species belongs to the Old World clade of pelican species...|$|R

Morphological analysis and the differential diagnosis of genetically recognised male specimens of C. gibsoni and C. overstreeti with respect to C. multipapillatum (von Drasche, 1882) (sensu lato) from Egretta alba (L.) in northern Colombia and other morphologically related Contracaecum spp. enabled the detection of {{differences between the two}} species in a number of characters, including spicule length and the shape of its tip, and the arrangement of the proximal and distal papillae on the male tail. Accordingly, formal descriptions are presented for C. gibsoni n. sp. and C. overstreeti n. sp. from P. crispus. The genetic characterisation of the two taxa is based on 20 allozyme loci and sequence analyses (519 bp) of the mtDNA cox 2 gene. Reproductive isolation was demonstrated between these two taxa, which sympatrically infect the same definitive host, and fixed allele differences between the two species were found at some (Aat- 2, PepC- 1, PepC- 2 and Pgm- 1) of the 20 allozyme loci analysed. Their genetic divergence, estimated at the allozyme level, was D (Nei) = 0. 31. The genetic relationships of C. gibsoni and C. overstreeti with respect to C. multipapillatum (s. l.) collected from E. alba in Colombia, as well as with other congeners from fish-eating birds which had previously been genetically characterised using the same genetic markers, i. e. C. rudolphii A and C. rudolphii B of Bullini et al.

The MP, NJ and BI trees obtained were congruent in depicting C. gibsoni and C. overstreeti as closely related species but quite distinct from each other and forming a subclade with specimens of C. multipapilllatum (s. l.) from E. alba (L.) in Colombia.

5000|$|The male {{kori bustard}} is 120 to 150 cm, stands 71 - 120 cm tall {{and may have}} a {{wingspan}} about 230 to 275 cm. Male birds may typically weigh between 7 and 18 kg. The average weight of adult males of the nominate race in Namibia (20 specimens) was 11.3 kg, while A. k. struthiunculus males were found to average 10.9 kg. The larger excepted males can scale up to 16 to 19 kg and a few exceptional specimens may weigh up to at least 20 kg. Reports of outsized specimens weighing 23 kg, 34 kg and even [...] "almost" [...] 40 kg have been reported, {{but none of these}} giant sizes have been verified and some may be from unreliable sources. Among bustards, only male great bustards (Otis tarda) achieve similarly high weights, making the male kori and great not only the two largest bustards but also arguably the heaviest living flying animals. As a whole, other species, such as Dalmatian pelican (<b>Pelecanus</b> <b>crispus),</b> Andean condor (Vultur gryphus) and trumpeter swan (Cygnus buccinator), might weigh more on average between the sexes but are less sexually dimorphic in mass than the giant bustards. The female kori bustard weighs an average of 4.8 to 6.1 kg, with a full range of 3 to 7 kg. Females of the nominate race (35 specimens) in Namibia weighed a mean of 5.62 kg, while females from A. k. struthiunculus weighed a mean of 5.9 kg. Female length is from 80 to 120 cm and they usually stand 60 cm tall and have a wingspan of 177 to 220 cm.

40|$|The {{perennial}} weed species Rumex crispus L., or curled dock, {{is a major}} problem in agriculture in Sweden as well as in many other parts of the world. Its ability to establish quickly from seed, its persistent taproot system, high capacity of regrowth after cutting, and massive production of seed that remain viable in the seed bank for decades all contribute {{to the success of the}} weed. It is particularly problematic on dairy farms and in organic agriculture and difficult to control effectively, especially without the use of chemical herbicides. R. crispus and other weedy dock species have been well studied since the early 1900 's. However, the constant changes in agricultural practices and policies, affecting both the abundance and performance of the weed and the conditions for its control, call for a continuous renewal of the knowledge of the species. This thesis work was based upon a set of experimental studies dealing with several different processes in the life cycle of R. <b>crispus.</b> <b>I</b> have investigated time and pattern of seedling emergence, the effects of competition on the performance of juvenile plants, vegetative regeneration from underground parts, and population dynamics in an agricultural field. I found that R. crispus seedlings can emerge throughout the growing season and that seeds that remain on the parent plant over winter posses a certain level of dormancy, leading to later and more intermittent emergence compared to seeds dispersed in autumn. Tillage that leads to fragmentation of the root system can stimulate sprouting of new shoots from the regenerative tissue of the taproot. Severed top fragments of roots sprouted faster and produced more shoot biomass than intact rootstocks. Further, it was found that R. crispus seedlings are very sensitive to root competition in its early life stages, while it makes some morphological adaptations in response to shoot competition. To establish successfully in grassland, a large gap in the sward is required. Vegetation density during establishment of R. crispus plants will affect their performance also in the long term. Low frequency cuttings had no effect on population size, but can reduce the rate of seed bank accumulation...|$|R
