Much of her <b>pale</b> <b>shoulders</b> are bared by the neckline of her dark dress, which appears to have some type of linen frill at the bust. Her hair is dark and unstyled and hangs down to the crook of her neck. The background is also dark and paints no specific scene...|$|R

60|$|His muscles tensed {{to drive}} home the blade, but {{something}} held his hand. His face <b>paled.</b> His <b>shoulders</b> contracted with a little shudder, and he turned toward {{the door of the}} apartment, almost running across the floor in his anxiety to escape. The eye in the dark maintained its unblinking vigilance.|$|R
50|$|The Christmas emerald dove {{is a small}} {{brownish}} pigeon {{with green}} wings. It is some 23-26 cm long, with a 43-46 cm wingspan and a weight of 80-135 g. It is smaller than the mainland Australian subspecies of the dove and differs from them by the adult male having a contrasting light grey cap, with a prominent white forehead, white supercilium extending behind the eye, and a mainly rufous-brown shoulder patch with only a narrow white line along the edge. The adult female has a darker, red-brown head, neck and underparts, lacking the grey and white on the head {{as well as the}} <b>pale</b> <b>shoulder</b> patch.|$|E
50|$|Adults of {{both sexes}} are about 43 cm (17 in) in length, {{including}} the long, broad tail. The adult male has a red head, breast, and lower undersides, with a blue band {{on the back of}} the neck between the red above and green on the back, the wings are green and each has a pale green shoulder band, the tail is green, and the rump is blue. The male has a reddish-orange upper mandible with a black tip, a black lower mandible with an orange base, and yellow irises. The plumage of the female is very different from the male having a green head and breast, a grey beak, and the <b>pale</b> <b>shoulder</b> band is small or absent. Juveniles {{of both sexes}} have brown irises and a yellowish beak, and otherwise resemble the female.|$|E

5|$|The {{immature}} American goldfinch has a dull brown back, and {{the underside}} is <b>pale</b> yellow. The <b>shoulders</b> and tail are dull black with buff-colored, rather than white, markings on wings and rump. This coloration {{is the same}} in both genders.|$|R

50|$|In non-breeding plumage, {{the black}} plumage is {{replaced}} by heavily streaked buffy-brown, and the bill is <b>pale.</b> The yellow <b>shoulders</b> and rump remain, and are a distinction from the female which lacks the contrasting colour patches. The juveniles and females are notoriously difficult to identify in the field, appearing identical to the juveniles and females of several other bishops and widowbirds {{as well as some}} seadeaters.|$|R

5000|$|The size of {{an adult}} shell varies between 30 mm and 71 mm. The ground color of the shell is pale brown, with fine close lines of chestnut-brown, and oneor two <b>paler</b> bands. The <b>shoulder</b> ( [...] = the {{angulation}} of the shell whorls) is somewhat obtuse. The spire is concavely elevated, with an acute apex. The spire is uniform pale brown. [...] Tryon describes the variety furvus with this special characteristics. The revolving lines are broken up into minute dots The form is somewhat narrower. Some of the spire whorls are finely beaded.|$|R
5000|$|... (Original description) The small {{shell is}} brownish, with a {{tendency}} to banding, <b>paler</b> at the <b>shoulder</b> and on the base. It contains six whorls, including a small, smooth protoconch whorl. The suture is distinct, slightly appressed, with no fasciolar constriction. The spiral sculpture consists of fine flattish threads separated by narrow striae very minutely reticulated by the incremental lines and most conspicuous in the intervals between the ribs, practically covering the whole surface of the shell. The axial sculpture, beside almost microscopic lines of growth, consists of (on the body whorl 14) short roundedribs, slightly angulated at the shoulder and extending from the suture to the siphonal canal with subequal interspaces. The anal sulcus is shallow. The aperture is narrow and simple. The inner lip is erased. The siphonal canal is short, and straight.|$|R

60|$|The nurse led the way--tall, lithe, graceful--attired in {{her uniform}} dress of neat black stuff, with plain linen collar and cuffs, {{and with the}} scarlet cross of the Geneva Convention {{embroidered}} on her left <b>shoulder.</b> <b>Pale</b> and sad, her expression and manner both eloquently suggestive of suppressed suffering and sorrow, there was an innate nobility in the carriage of this woman's head, an innate grandeur in the gaze of her large gray eyes and in the lines of her finely proportioned face, which made her irresistibly striking and beautiful, seen under any circumstances and clad in any dress. Her companion, darker in complexion and smaller in stature, possessed attractions which were quite marked enough {{to account for the}} surgeon's polite anxiety to shelter her in the captain's room. The common consent of mankind would have declared her to be an unusually pretty woman. She wore the large gray cloak that covered her from head to foot with a grace that lent its own attractions to a plain and even a shabby article of dress. The languor in her movements, and the uncertainty of tone in her voice as she thanked the surgeon suggested that she was suffering from fatigue. Her dark eyes searched the dimly-lighted room timidly, and she held fast by the nurse's arm with the air of a woman whose nerves had been severely shaken by some recent alarm.|$|R
60|$|Margaret, {{the eldest}} of the four, was sixteen, and very pretty, being plump and fair, with large eyes, plenty of soft brown hair, a sweet mouth, and white hands, of which she was rather vain. Fifteen-year-old Jo was very tall, thin, and brown, and {{reminded}} one of a colt, for she never seemed {{to know what to}} do with her long limbs, which were very much in her way. She had a decided mouth, a comical nose, and sharp, gray eyes, which appeared to see everything, and were by turns fierce, funny, or thoughtful. Her long, thick hair was her one beauty, but it was usually bundled into a net, to be out of her way. Round shoulders had Jo, big hands and feet, a flyaway look to her clothes, and the uncomfortable appearance of a girl who was rapidly shooting up into a woman and didn't like it. Elizabeth, or Beth, as everyone called her, was a rosy, smooth-haired, bright-eyed girl of thirteen, with a shy manner, a timid voice, and a peaceful expression which was seldom disturbed. Her father called her 'Little Miss Tranquility', and the name suited her excellently, for she seemed to live in a happy world of her own, only venturing out to meet the few whom she trusted and loved. Amy, though the youngest, was a most important person, in her own opinion at least. A regular snow maiden, with blue eyes, and yellow hair curling on her <b>shoulders,</b> <b>pale</b> and slender, and always carrying herself like a young lady mindful of her manners. What the characters of the four sisters were we will leave to be found out.|$|R
