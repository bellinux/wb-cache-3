40|$|D. Com. (Transport Economics) Port {{charges in}} most of the ports in the world have evolved in a {{haphazard}} manner over many years. In recent years, competition between ports and the drive towards commercialisation and privatisation have necessitated the restructuring of the charges in many ports according to sound economic principles. The contention in this thesis is that the charges in South African ports can be restructured in accordance with such principles, provided the monopoly profits at present earned on wharfage are eventually foregone, but that revenue neutrality can be maintained during the <b>phasing-in</b> period. The existing tariffs for all South African ports are then restructured in accordance with the principles involved and examples of the port expenses of ship and cargo owners before and after the restructuring are given. While these examples prove the hypothesis, it is pointed out that conclusions cannot be simplistically derived from such comparisons, because the efficiency in the use of port land and the handling of cargo will increase as an outcome of the incentives to such efficiency, which the new charges will create...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the second}} half of the 20 th Century, pension reform has become central to the European social policy agenda, first in terms of {{construction}} and expansion and then increasingly in terms of consolidation and retrenchment. Expenditure growth projections started to be regarded as a serious risk for the sustainability of public finances and the competitiveness of national economies. In a context of demographic ageing and economic transnationalization pension “reform”, often meaning the reduction of benefits, acquired top priority. Most European countries have changed indexation rules, reduced early retirement options, increased retirement ages and encouraged the development of private pensions. Overall, they have reduced expenditure prospects significantly, thereby increasing again the risk of poverty. Several strategies have been used to pass these unpopular reforms, including “obfuscation” to make costs less visible, long <b>phasing-in</b> periods to reduce the opposition of workers close to retirement, dividing potential opponents by treating occupational groups differently, the use of incentives to work longer, and the use of discourse to frame reforms as “inevitable”. Pensions cannot be addressed in isolation; they are embedded in the broader political economy and in the broader set of public policies addressing all phases of the life course...|$|E
40|$|After {{presenting}} {{an extensive}} {{overview of the}} reforms undertaken in the EU between 1990 and 2006, The paper assess with a diff-in-diff technique the short-term effects of pension reforms on the participation rates of individuals aged between 50 and 64 years. The analysis suggests that in the short-term pension reforms have different effects on the participation rate of men and women. First, reforms tightening the access to early retirement {{have a positive effect}} on female participation, but reduce somewhat male participation rates. Second, the results for non-fundamental reforms are more uncertain. Third, reforms that change the way of financing pensions or the eligibility conditions (what we dubbed fundamental reforms), usually with long <b>phasing-in</b> periods, may have unintended short-run effects on the female participation rate. Thus, our findings point at the importance of designing pension reforms and strategies to reform social security that reduce the risks of undesired effects on the decision to remain in the labour market.
