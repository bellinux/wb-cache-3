5|$|Economists {{have found}} {{empirical}} evidence that covered interest rate <b>parity</b> generally holds, though not with precision {{due to the}} effects of various risks, costs, taxation, and ultimate differences in liquidity. When both covered and uncovered interest rate <b>parity</b> hold, they expose a relationship suggesting that the forward rate is an unbiased predictor of the future spot rate. This relationship can be employed to test whether uncovered interest rate <b>parity</b> holds, for which economists have found mixed results. When uncovered interest rate <b>parity</b> and purchasing power <b>parity</b> hold together, they illuminate a relationship named real interest rate <b>parity,</b> which suggests that expected real interest rates represent expected adjustments in the real exchange rate. This relationship generally holds strongly over longer terms and among emerging market countries.|$|E

5|$|Interest rate <b>parity</b> is a no-arbitrage {{condition}} representing an {{equilibrium state}} under which investors will be indifferent to interest rates available on bank deposits in two countries. The {{fact that this}} condition does not always hold allows for potential opportunities to earn riskless profits from covered interest arbitrage. Two assumptions central to interest rate <b>parity</b> are capital mobility and perfect substitutability of domestic and foreign assets. Given foreign exchange market equilibrium, the interest rate <b>parity</b> condition implies that the expected return on domestic assets will equal the exchange rate-adjusted expected return on foreign currency assets. Investors then cannot earn arbitrage profits by borrowing {{in a country with}} a lower interest rate, exchanging for foreign currency, and investing in a foreign country with a higher interest rate, due to gains or losses from exchanging back to their domestic currency at maturity. Interest rate <b>parity</b> takes on two distinctive forms: uncovered interest rate <b>parity</b> refers to the <b>parity</b> condition in which exposure to foreign exchange risk (unanticipated changes in exchange rates) is uninhibited, whereas covered interest rate <b>parity</b> refers to the condition in which a forward contract has been used to cover (eliminate exposure to) exchange rate risk. Each form of the <b>parity</b> condition demonstrates a unique relationship with implications for the forecasting of future exchange rates: the forward exchange rate and the future spot exchange rate.|$|E

40|$|We study three {{dimensional}} insulators with inversion symmetry, {{in which}} other point group symmetries, such as time reversal, are generically absent. Their band topology {{is found to}} be classified by the <b>parities</b> of occupied states at time reversal invariant momenta (TRIM <b>parities),</b> and by three Chern numbers. The TRIM <b>parities</b> of any insulator must satisfy a constraint: their product must be + 1. The TRIM <b>parities</b> also constrain the Chern numbers modulo two. When the Chern numbers vanish, a magneto-electric response parameterized by "theta" is defined and is quantized to theta= 0, 2 pi. Its value is entirely determined by the TRIM <b>parities.</b> These results may be useful in the search for magnetic topological insulators with large theta. A classification of inversion symmetric insulators is also given for general dimensions. An alternate geometrical derivation of our results is obtained by using the entanglement spectrum of the ground state wave-function. Comment: 12 pages main text; 12 pages appendices; 11 figures.

5|$|Risk <b>parity</b> advocates {{assert that}} the unlevered risk <b>parity</b> {{portfolio}} is quite close to the tangency portfolio, as close as can be measured given uncertainties and noise in the data. Theoretical and empirical arguments are made {{in support of this}} contention. One specific set of assumptions that puts the risk <b>parity</b> portfolio on the efficient frontier is that the individual asset classes are uncorrelated and have identical Sharpe ratios. Risk <b>parity</b> critics rarely contest the claim that the risk <b>parity</b> portfolio is near the tangency portfolio but they say that the leveraged investment line is less steep and that the levered risk <b>parity</b> portfolio has slight or no advantage over 60% stocks / 40% bonds, and carries the disadvantage of greater explicit leverage.|$|E

5|$|The {{principles}} of risk <b>parity</b> may be applied differently by different financial managers, {{as they have}} different methods for categorizing assets into classes, different definitions of risk, different ways of allocating risk within asset classes, different methods for forecasting future risk and different ways of implementing exposure to risk.

5|$|When both UIRP (particularly in its {{approximation}} form) and {{purchasing power}} <b>parity</b> (PPP) hold, the two <b>parity</b> conditions together reveal a relationship among expected real interest rates, wherein changes in expected real interest rates reflect expected {{changes in the}} real exchange rate.

This methodological approach allows low and high order <b>parities</b> to be determined by two different data generating mechanisms, and explicitly accounts for potential endogenous switching between regimes. Unobserved heterogeneity is properly controlled. Special attention is given to study how socio-economic characteristics such as religion and ethnic group affect the likelihood of transition from low to high order <b>parities.</b> Findings indicate that education and Catholicism are associated with reductions in the likelihood of transition from <b>parities</b> lower than four to high order <b>parities.</b> Being an indigenous language speaker, in contrast, increases the odds of a large family.

40|$|Claw {{disorders}} affect cow {{welfare and}} profitability of farms. Not only claw disorders {{but also the}} need for trimming, known as trimming status, {{has been shown to}} be heritable. Limited knowledge is available on whether claw health traits (claw disorders and trimming status) are genetically the same trait in different <b>parities,</b> lactation stages, or in herds with low or high frequency of claw disorders. The aim of the current study was to estimate frequencies, heritabilities, and genetic correlations of claw health traits measured in different <b>parities</b> (first vs. later <b>parities),</b> in different lactation stages (early vs. late lactation), and in herds with different frequencies of claw disorders (low vs. high frequency). Analyses revealed that heritabilities measured in different <b>parities,</b> lactation stages, or herds with different trait frequencies are similar for most claw health traits. Also, genetic correlations (rg) for most claw health traits were not found to be different from unity for traits in different <b>parities,</b> lactation stages, or herds with different trait frequencies. Sole hemorrhage and infectious lesions were genetically different traits in first or later <b>parities</b> (rg= 0. 29 ± 0. 31 and 0. 66 ± 0. 15, respectively). White line separation and infectious lesions were genetically different in early and late lactation (rg= 0. 53 ± 0. 20 and 0. 69 ± 0. 13, respectively), and sole ulcer was genetically different in herds with low or high frequency of sole ulcer (rg= 0. 75 ± 0. 14).

5|$|Risk <b>parity</b> is a {{conceptual}} approach to investing which attempts {{to provide a}} lower risk and lower fee alternative to the traditional portfolio allocation of 60% stocks and 40% bonds which carries 90% of its risk in the stock portion of the portfolio (see illustration). The risk <b>parity</b> approach attempts to equalize risk by allocating funds to {{a wider range of}} categories such as stocks, government bonds, credit-related securities and inflation hedges (including real assets, commodities, real estate and inflation-protected bonds), while maximizing gains through financial leveraging. According to Bob Prince, CIO at Bridgewater Associates, the defining parameters of a traditional risk <b>parity</b> portfolio are uncorrelated assets, low equity risk, and passive management.|$|E
