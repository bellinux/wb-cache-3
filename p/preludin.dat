500|$|On {{their first}} trip to Hamburg, the group soon {{realised}} that the stage suits they wore could not {{stand up to the}} hours of sweating and jumping about on stage every night, so they all bought leather jackets, jeans and cowboy boots, which were much tougher.

Stuart Sutcliffe, Lennon's friend from art school, later joined as bassist. Lennon, McCartney, Harrison and Sutcliffe became [...] "The Beatles" [...] in early 1960. In August that year, the Beatles engaged for a 48-night residency in Hamburg, Germany and were desperately {{in need of a}} drummer. They asked Pete Best to join them.

Powell waited until Lennon came back from Hamburg before she asked Smith—who had taken in lodgers before at 251 Menlove Avenue—if she would rent a room to her. Smith rented out the box-room above the front door (which had been Lennon's bedroom), but insisted she also do chores around the house.

40|$|The Amphetamine Years is {{a history}} of {{psychostimulant}} drugs and their clinical applications in post-World War II American medicine. Comprising such well-known substances as the amphetamines (Benzedrine, Dexedrine), methylphenidate (Ritalin), and phenmetrazine (<b>Preludin),</b> this class of pharmaceuticals has been among the most widely consumed in the past half-century. Their therapeutic uses for a variety of indications such as depression, obesity, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children, not to mention their relevance for a number of different medical specialties, reveals that psychostimulants have occupied an important, if underappreciated role in the practice of modern medicine. In this dissertation, I illuminate the various ways in which physicians, particularly psychiatrists, put these drugs to work in clinical practice. In short, I contend that physicians exploited the wide range of physiological and psychological effects of psychostimulants and made a place for them in different therapeutic settings, even ones characterized by competing views and theories about the workings of the human body and mind. My dissertation is distinguished by two prominent themes. First, I emphasize the clinician perspective as a vehicle for understanding the history of the psychostimulants, as well as related developments in psychiatry, pharmacotherapy, and the political economy of drugs, {{in the second half of}} the twentieth century. Scholars such Nicolas Rasmussen, David Courtwright, and Ilina Singh have elucidated the history of psychostimulants by emphasizing how pharmaceutical companies positioned their products in the medical marketplace. My dissertation takes a different, yet complimentary approach by studying clinicians, themselves, to further historical comprehension of the place of these pharmaceuticals within postwar medicine, society, and culture. Second, I advance the concept of "therapeutic versatility" to explain their historical trajectories. The complex set of psychological and physical effects these drugs produced made them ideal for a diverse range of therapeutic applications, which explains why they were embraced by many different medical specialties, why they were marketed by manufacturers for a variety of indications, and why they have enjoyed an enduring therapeutic lifespan, in spite of increasing efforts since the mid- 1960 s to regulate their availability and control their consumption. In addition to these two overarching themes, I advance five specific arguments in my dissertation. First, I contend that pharmaceutical markets were simultaneously created by the drug industry and clinicians. Pharmaceutical firms' efforts to develop markets for their products have been well documented by historians, but in my dissertation, I underscore the role also played by clinicians in discerning drugs' applications. Second, I argue that twentieth-century psychiatry's conception of illness and therapeutics may not be served best by strictly dividing its history along lines of institutional and outpatient treatment. Third, I demonstrate how the use of psychostimulants by analytically oriented psychiatrists during the 1950 s complicates historical notions of paradigm shift from a psychodynamic to biological orientation. Psychotherapy and psychopharmacology were not competing paradigms; in practice, doctors often employed both. Fourth, I assert that an appreciation of psychiatrists' empirical and eclectic approaches to the use of drugs is necessary to comprehend the rise of psychiatric pharmacotherapy in the postwar era. Finally, I contend that in order to understand the relationship between medical applications of psychostimulants and their extramedical consumption, it is necessary to conceive of a plurality of distinct "amphetamine cultures," each characterized by a unique set of relationships between physician-prescribers, patient-consumers, pharmaceutical firms, and political authorities.

Ispitivanja su izvršena na tri načina: (1) Ispitanici su u toku dana, uz stalnu pauzu među susjednim radovima, radili više puta (od 9 do 16 puta), i to uvijek do kraja izvodljivosti; (2) ispitanici su radili 10 submaksimalnih radova uz stalnu pauzu, a onda su tek na kraju čitavog pokusa radili jedan rad do kraja izdržljivosti; (S) ispitanici su najprije uz stalnu pauzu radili 4 submaksimalna rada, a zatim uz jednaku pauzu još 9 maksimalnih radova. Rezultati su pokazali da uzimanje farmakoloških preparata kad je čovjek svjež i dobro motiviran za rad veoma slabo ili nikako ne utječe na njegovu izdržljivost u tjelesnom radu. Isto su tako farmakološki stimulatori slabo uspješni kad je rad koji čovjek vrši, submaksimalan. Jedino onda kad se organizam nalazi u određenom stupnju umora, uzimanje nekih farmakoloških sredstava može povećati izdržljivost u radu. An ever {{increasing}} use of pharmaca for stimulation in work or for prevention of fatigue feeling arouses {{the question of how}} these pharmaca affect man 2 ̆ 7 s actual working capacity. In physical effort, the fundamental problem is in whether pharmacological stimulators increase work output by improving the inner condition of the organism, i. e. by making working effort more economical {{from the point of view}} of energy, or whether this increase of working capacity is only the result of a central effect (fatigue feeling inhibition accompanied by persistent uneconomical use of the energy reserves necessary for a fast and successful recovery in the periods of rest. The studies carried out so far have given no satisfactory answer to this question, mostly owing to inappropriate methods usually applied in such studies. The basic methodological defect was that the efficacy of pharmacological stimulators was usually tested by comparing the maximum work output of a single effort performed under the influence of a pharmacological stimulator up to exhaustion with a maximum work output of a single effort performed without the use of a stimulator. In life, however, one hardly ever works up to exhaustion, and one 2 ̆ 7 s work is usually done at intervals, i. e. the phases of action are periodically followed by the phases of rest. For working capacity in the course of a longer period, the rate and degree of recovery in the phases of rest are at least so important as the degree of mobilization of working synergies in the phases of action. In the course of the last five years the authors have studied the effect of various pharmaca on physical work by using the method of repetitive physical effort both of a static (hanging on one 2 ̆ 7 s arms) and dynamic (bicycleergometer driving and running on a treadmill) kind. In main experiments three kinds of procedures were used: a) With a regular pause between successive efforts, the subjects worked several times a day (9 - 16 times), each time up to exhaustion; b) The subjects made 10 submaximum efforts with a regular pause between them, and worked up to exhaustion only at the end of the whole experiment; this final maximum effort served as a test of fatigue produced by their previous submaximum efforts; c) With a regular pause between each effort, the subjects made 4 submaximum efforts first, and then 9 maximum efforts. The pharmaca used in these experiments were: phenamine (phenyl-izopropilamin sulfas), ritaline (phenyl-/-piperidyl) -acetico-methylic. hydrochloric), <b>preludin</b> (2 -phe-nyl- 3 -methyl-tetrahydro- 1, 4 -oxazin-hydrochlorid), and veronal (5, 5 diethylbarbituric acid). They were administered orally either in various phases of the experiment or prior to the experiment. The results may be summarized as follows: 1. The use of various pharmacological stimulators in. the state of physical freshness and good motivation for work has hardly any positive effect. In such cases the inner normal mobilization of working synergies is high enough for a successful adjustment of the organism to the increased work requirements. 2. Pharmacological stimulators do not seem to be much successful in submaximum efforts either, even if such efforts produce a certain degree of fatigue. A certain posoitive effect of pharmacological stimulators appears to exist only in the final phase of maximum physical efforts. 3. Pharmacological stimulators do not seem to slow down the process of restitution in the phases of rest between successive efforts. It also appears that within certain limits of physical effort the certain increase of work output due to pharmacological stimulators is not brought about at the expense of a greater exhaustion of the organism in a later stage. The energy reserves of the organism seem to be such that even if alarm signals of fatigue feeling are missing, they cannot be affected to such an extent as to cause a significant prolongation of restitution processes. 4. Under the effect of stimulators the subjects regularly feel less tired than in control experiments. The difference in the feeling of pain, localised in active muscles, is specially pronounced, this feeling being considerably milder in the experiments with the use of stimulators. This suggests that the effect of pharmacological stimulators is primarily central, their analgetic action raising the limen of the subjective tolerance of the subject in work. 5. Under the effect of phenamine the pulse frequency is increased before the effort is made, in the course of work, and in the rest intervals. While in successive maximum physical efforts in control experiments the subjects break the work at an ever lower pulse frequency, in the experiments with phenamine the pulse frequency remains on a more or less constant, comparatively high level. However, since there is no correlation between the degree of work output improvement and the difference in the pulse frequency at the end of each effort in the experiment with phenamine and the control experiments, the certain positive effect of phenamine on work output does not appear to be in direct connection with the increased pulse frequency...|$|E
