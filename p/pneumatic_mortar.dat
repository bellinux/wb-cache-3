50|$|The Holman Projector was an {{anti-aircraft}} weapon {{used by the}} Royal Navy during World War II, {{primarily between}} early 1940 and late 1941. The weapon was proposed and designed by Holmans, a machine tool manufacturer based at Camborne, Cornwall. A number of models were produced during the war years, but all worked {{on the principle of}} a <b>pneumatic</b> <b>mortar,</b> using compressed air or high pressure steam to fire an explosive projectile at enemy aircraft.|$|E
50|$|The 10.5 cm Luftminenwerfer M 15 (<b>Pneumatic</b> Trench <b>Mortar)</b> was {{a medium}} mortar used by Austria-Hungary in World War I. It was {{developed}} by the German firm of Ehrhardt & Sehmer. It was a rigid-recoil, muzzle-loading mortar on a fixed base that used compressed air to propel the mortar bomb to the target. Each cylinder of compressed air lasted for fifteen shots. A notable advantage was that the mortar had no firing signature, unlike conventional mortars with smoke and muzzle flash.|$|R
50|$|The 15 cm Luftminenwerfer M 15 M. E. (<b>Pneumatic</b> Trench <b>Mortar</b> Maschinenfabrik Esslingen) was {{a medium}} mortar used by Austria-Hungary in World War I. It was {{developed}} by the German firm Maschinenfabrik Esslingen in response to a German requirement. Its initial testing was observed by an Austro-Hungarian representative and his positive report convinced them to order a batch of five for comparative testing. It was evaluated on 21 September 1915 and it produced the right impression. Nonetheless four weapons were sent off for combat trials at the end of October 1915, which were presumably favorable.|$|R
50|$|The 8 cm Luftminenwerfer M 15 (<b>Pneumatic</b> trench <b>mortar)</b> {{was a light}} mortar used by Austria-Hungary in World War I. It was {{designed}} by the 58th Infantry Division and the first twenty {{were built in the}} division's workshops. Later production was contracted out to Vereinigte Elektrische Maschinen A. G. in Budapest. It used the breakable screw method to retain the bomb in place until the air pressure in the chamber was strong enough to break the screw. Grooves of different depths could be used to vary the range. It was sometimes referred to as the Roka-Halasz system.|$|R
5000|$|The 12 cm Luftminenwerfer M 16 (<b>Pneumatic</b> trench <b>mortar)</b> was {{a medium}} mortar used by Austria-Hungary in World War I. It was {{developed}} by Austria Metal Works in Brno from their earlier, rejected, 8 cm project. It was a rigid-recoil, smooth-bore, breech-loading design {{that had to be}} levered around to aim at new targets. It was very simple in that the shell closed the top of the chamber and was retained by a [...] "gripper" [...] until the air pressure was deemed sufficient and the gripper was manually released, which fired the weapon. An additional barrel could be fitted to extend the range. A cylinder of compressed air was good for eleven shots.|$|R
5000|$|The 20 cm Luftminenwerfer M 16 (<b>Pneumatic</b> trench <b>mortar)</b> {{was a heavy}} mortar used by Austria-Hungary in World War I. It was {{developed}} by Austria Metal Works in Brno from their earlier 12 cm Luftminenwerfer M 16. It was a rigid-recoil, smooth-bore, muzzle-loading design {{that had to be}} levered around to aim at new targets. It was very simple in that the shell closed the top of the chamber and was retained by a [...] "gripper" [...] until the air pressure was deemed sufficient and the gripper was manually released, which fired the weapon. The barrel was fixed at 45Â° elevation and range was adjusted by varying the air pressure, but an additional barrel could be fitted to extend the range. A single cylinder of compressed air was only good for four to six shots. It was loaded onto a two-wheel cart for transport.|$|R
40|$|The Low Density Supersonic Decelerator (LDSD) Project {{required}} {{the use of}} a pilot system due to the inability to mortar deploy its main supersonic parachute. A mortar deployed 4. 4 m diameter supersonic ram-air ballute was selected as the pilot system for its high drag coefficient and stability relative to candidate supersonic parachutes at the targeted operational Mach number of 3. The ballute underwent a significant development program that included {{the development of a new}} liquid methanol-based pre-inflation system to assist the ballute inflation process. Both <b>pneumatic</b> and pyrotechnic <b>mortar</b> tests were conducted to verify orderly rigging deployment, bag strip, inflation aid activation, and proper mortar performance. The ballute was iteratively analyzed between fluid and structural analysis codes to obtain aerodynamic and aerothermodynamic estimates as well as estimates of the ballute's structural integrity and shape. The ballute was successfully flown in June 2014 at a Mach number of 2. 73 as part of the first LDSD supersonic flight test and performed beyond expectations. Recovery of the ballute indicated that it did not exceed its structural or thermal capabilities. This flight set a historical precedent as it represented the largest ballute to have ever been successfully flown at this Mach number by a NASA entity...|$|R
