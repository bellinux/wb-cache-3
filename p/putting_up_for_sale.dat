5|$|To {{improve his}} wife's estate, Fownes Luttrell {{obtained}} a sanction from the Court of Chancery {{to sell the}} manors of Heathfield and Kilton, but found no buyers; he subsequently attempted to sell the manor of Minehead, and also offered {{at least one of}} the Parliamentary seats for the Borough of Minehead for £30,000, but there were no serious bidders, largely due to the high prices and the fact that Fownes Luttrell had in fact not inherited much control over the seats he was <b>putting</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>sale.</b> However, frugal spending helped to recover the estate and Fownes Luttrell invested in 1760 in the manor of Foremarsh, near Dunster, which he purchased from John Poyntz. He went on to buy the manor of Staunton Fry in 1777 and a number of tenements in Dunster. In leisure, he particularly enjoyed hunting, keeping hounds and horses, and cockfighting.|$|E

50|$|Papers was {{developed}} by Alexander Griekspoor and Tom Groothuis while studying towards their Ph.D.s at the Netherlands Cancer Institute. Faced with working with hundreds of digital publications in PDF format, the pair worked on Papers to provide an iTunes-like approach to document management. Papers was originally released as a public preview in February 2007, followed by the full 1.0 version a few months later. A {{new version of the}} software was released and put for sale {{in the third quarter of}} 2013, along with a new iPhone/iPad app. Both products went under a considerable amount of criticism from new and returning users, who experienced a number of issues, ranging from lost databases and annotations to incompatibility between mobile and desktop apps. Users criticised Mekentosj and Springer, respectively developer and owner of Papers, for <b>putting</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>sale</b> a beta version of the software and their slowness in addressing problems that effectively rendered the software unusable.|$|E
