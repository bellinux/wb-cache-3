The age estimate of the core units were decided by AMS 14 C dates and confirmed by the correlation of the geochemical properties and ice-rafted debris (IRD) pattern with the well-dated core (P 2) in the study area. The geochemical, isotopic, and mineralogical properties indicate different paleoceanographic conditions of three lithologic units in the Chukchi Rise: low primary production during the glacial period (Unit III), high terrigenous contribution during the deglacial period (Unit II), and increase in diatom productivity during the late Holocene (Unit I). In particular, most IRDs were specified as detrital carbonates (calcites and dolomites) by SEM-EDS examination. The sediment source from the northern North America and the transport pathway by the Beaufort Gyre were confirmed by the isotopic signature of bulk IRDs and high kaolinite content of fine-grained particles. 本研究では研究船「みらい」のMR 09 - 03 航海の際に、西部北極海のチュクチライズから採取したコア試料について古海洋学的研究を行った。コアは、 3 つの岩相ユニットから成る。ユニットIは完新世の褐色砂質泥からなる。ユニットIIは融氷期の漂流岩屑（IRD）層からなる。ユニットIIIはIRD層を挟在する氷期の灰色泥である。各ユニットの堆積年代の決定は、放射性炭素年代測定とともに年代既知の既存コアの地球化学的特徴とIRD層との対比によってなされた。岩相ユニットはそれぞれ異なる古海洋環境を示す。ユニットIII：氷期の低基礎生産、ユニットII：融氷期の高い陸源砕屑物の寄与、ユニットI：完新世後期の珪藻生産性の増大。IRD等の分析から、堆積物は北部北アメリカから供給され、ボーフォートジャイアによって輸送されたと推定した...|$|R

40|$|Compound {{specific}} isotope {{analysis of}} lake sediments {{is a powerful}} tool in deciphering evidence of changing climatic and paleoenvironmental conditions through time. Isotopic analysis of Lake El’gygytgyn pilot sediment cores, PG 1351 and LZ 1029, have contributed increased insight into paleoenvironmental interpretations regarding conditions of permanent ice cover and water column anoxia at the lake over the past 250 kyr. Bulk sediment δ 15 N was measured {{as a proxy for}} denitrification and a possible indicator for water column anoxia intensity. However, it appears that insufficient quantities of water column nitrate to fuel denitrification make its correlation with anoxia intensity ineffective. In <b>pilot</b> <b>core</b> LZ 1029, compound-specific δ 13 C of alkanes, fatty acids, and alcohols were analyzed to determine the changing sources of organic matter as well as the source of a strong negative isotopic shift in the bulk sediment δ 13 C (- 26 ‰ to - 33 ‰) over the past 50 kyr. Results indicate that the majority of alkanes, fatty acids, and alcohols are long chain compounds consistent with a terrestrial plant origin, with increased aquatic contribution during the local last glacial maximum (LLGM). Among the compound classes examined, only the mid chain fatty acids display a strong LLGM depletion (δ 13 C = - 43 ‰). Short chain fatty acids exhibit an LLGM depletion (δ 13 C = - 35 ‰) similar to bulk sediment δ 13 C, while the δ 13 C trend of long chain alkanes, fatty acids, and alcohols differ from the bulk sediment δ 13 C trend, suggesting an autochthonous source of bulk isotope depletion. Evidence of methane cycling exists only in the presence and isotopic value of diplopterol (LLGM δ 13 C = - 93. 4 ‰), a biomarker for aerobic oxidation of methane. Two compounds indicative of archaeal lipids were present at considerable concentrations during the LLGM (394 and 668 µg/g TOC), but without the extreme negative δ 13 C associated with methanogenesis and methanotrophy. These results suggest insufficient generation of methane in the lake to have derived from such a large anaerobic archaeal methanogen community suggesting that archaea are not acting entirely as methanogens. Furthermore, it appears unlikely that a significant anoxic layer existed in the water column of Lake El’gygytgyn during the past ~ 50 kyr. The results of this work will be applied to ongoing investigations on the newest cores from Lake El’gygytgyn, which represent the past 3. 5 Myr...|$|E

40|$|Lake El'gygytgyn is {{an impact}} crater lake that formed 3. 6 {{million years ago}} in Chukotka, northeastern Siberia. The lake has a mean {{diameter}} of 12 km and is bowl-shaped with a maximum water depth of approximately 170 m. At present, the lake is ice covered {{most of the year}} with an ice-free period of roughly 3 months. <b>Pilot</b> <b>cores</b> retrieved in 1998 and 2003 have shown that the lake sediments are highly susceptible to climate change; the lake has the unique potential to unravel 3. 6 million years of Arctic climate history. It has thus become one of the major sites for the International Continental Drilling Program (ICDP) during the past few years. In January 2009, thickening of the lake ice cover was carried out to allow to handle a drill rig from the ice. From February on, DOSECC started to build up a modified GLAD 800 rig to drill the lake sediments and further into the bedrock. By the end of April 2009, three holes were drilled at one site, reaching as far down as 517. 3 m below lake floor with a total recovery of 75 %. The cores penetrated 315 m of lacustrine sediments before they hit the suevite bedrock that was initially formed by the meteorite impact 3. 6 million years ago. While {{the upper part of the}} sediments were rather fine-grained intercalated with some smaller mass transport deposits as expected from the <b>pilot</b> <b>cores,</b> the lower part of the lacustrine sediments was much coarser. During the drilling campaign, magnetic susceptibility of the whole cores was measured in order to correlate the three cores of the drilled site and to get a first impression of the physical properties of the drilled material. Drilling was stopped 4 times to allow for carrying out a downhole logging survey. After the drilling campaign, all cores (permafrost as well as lacustrine/impact rock) were shipped from Siberia to Germany. Core opening and sampling of the lacustrine cores is presently carried out at the University of Cologne. The composite profile is defined while opening the cores, and samples are taken continuously every 2 cm with 9 subsamples. Here we present the field magnetic susceptibility of the cores, downhole logging data and first results from the ongoing core opening campaign along with the seismic record of the lake. Whole core magnetic susceptibility data show a high correlation between the cores of the different holes, and a perfect match with the downhole magnetic susceptibility data. Deep drilling confirmed the seismic boundary between lacustrine sediments and the suevite at approximately 315 to 330 m below lake floor, but moved the boundary between rather fine-grained, well-laminated sediments in the upper part and seismically more chaotic, coarser sediments in the lower part that was visible in the seismic reflection data up by 10 m to approximately 150 m below lake floor...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Sediment piston cores from Lake El’gygytgyn (67 N, 172 E), a 3. 6 million {{year old}} {{meteorite}} impact crater in northeastern Siberia, have been analyzed to extract a multi-proxy millennial- scale climate record extending to nearly 250 ka, with distinct fluctuations in sedimentological, physical, biochemical, and paleoecological parameters. Five major themes {{emerge from this}} research. First the <b>pilot</b> <b>cores</b> and seismic data show that El’gygytygn Crater Lake contains what {{is expected to be}} the longest, most continuous terrestrial record of past climate change in the entire Arctic back to the time of impact. Second, processes operating in the El’gygytygn basin lead to changes in the limnogeology and the biogeochemistry that reflect robust changes in the regional climate and paleoecology over a large part of the western Arctic. Third, the magnetic susceptibility and other proxies record numerous rapid change events. The recovered lake sediment contains both the best-resolved record of the last interglacial and the longest terrestrial record of millennial scale climate change in the Arctic, yielding a high fidelity multi-proxy record extending nearly 150, 000 years beyond what has been obtained from the Greenland Ice Sheet. Fourth, the potential for evaluating teleconnections under different mean climate states is high. Despite the heterogeneous nature of recent Arctic climate change, millennial scale climate events in the North Atlantic/Greenland region are recorded in the most distal regions of the Arctic under variable boundary conditions. Finally, deep drilling of the complete depositional record in Lake El’gygytgyn will offer new insights and, perhaps, surprises into the late Cenozoic evolution of Arctic climate...|$|R

40|$|The Chilean Lake District {{is located}} in Southern Chile, between 38 ° and 42 °S. Several long {{sediment}} cores were collected in these lakes. Their analysis aims at {{a better understanding of}} the climate mechanisms related to ENSO in this part of the world. The recognition of ENSO related periodicities and their stability is studied through the analysis of two cores collected in Lago Puyehue. Several methods of spectral analysis were applied to identify potential periodicities in the signal. Blackman-Tuckey, Maximum Entropy, Multi-Taper Methods (MTM) and singular spectrum analysis were applied on the whole record. In addition evolutive MTM and wavelet analyses allow identifying temporary influence of some periodicities. First, annual varve thickness was analysed for two <b>pilot</b> <b>cores.</b> The first core is rather short, i. e. 282 years. A period at ˜ 3. 0 year appears in a large part of the interval, mostly in the most recent part. Periods at ˜ 5. 2 year and ˜ 23 years also show up. The second one (longer than 550 years) displays the most robust periodicities at around 15, 9, 4. 4, 3. 2 and 2. 4 years. These periodicities are in good agreement with the sub-decadal periods identified by Dean and Kemp (2004) and linked to the Quasi-Biennal Osciallation, El Niño Southern Oscillation and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation. Moreover, the evolutive MTM analysis and the wavelet analysis suggest a striking break in the periodicities at around 1820 A. D. This could be coherent with the end of the Little Ice Age. In fact the sedimentation process is slightly different for the two cores. Varves in the first one can be related to the flood of the Rio Golgol and in all the drainage basin, while in the second core they are more directly related to local precipitation. This could explain the difference in the recorded periodicities in the two sites. Second, magnetic susceptibility of a longer core, covering the last 18 kyr, was also analysed. It suggests several periods, i. e. 950, 750, 380, 280, 220, 208, 180 years, although their significance is questionable...|$|R

The lake is bowl-shaped with a mean {{diameter}} of 12 km and a maximum water depth of approximately 170 m. At present, the lake is ice-free only during the short summer period of approximately 3 months. <b>Pilot</b> <b>cores</b> retrieved in 1998 and 2003 showed that the lake sediments are highly susceptible to climate change. A seismic pre-site survey revealed approximately 330 m of lacustrine sediments {{on top of the}} suevite that was initially formed by the meteorite impact 3. 6 million years ago. The lake sediments thus have the unique potential to unravel 3. 6 million years of terrestrial Arctic climate history. Seismic profiles revealed that the upper approximately 150 m of the sediments are well-layered, but intercalated with debris flows and turbidites in the more proximal parts of the lake. The lower part of the sediments appears more massive to acoustically transparent in the seismic profiles. The sediment succession at the lake center is mostly undisturbed by mass transport deposits and forms an ideal place for deep drilling. The lake was drilled down into the impact bedrock in winter/spring 2010 {{within the framework of the}} ICDP. Three holes were drilled at one site in the lake center, reaching as far down as 517. 3 m below lake floor with a total recovery of 75 %.

A new frontier in the field of rainfall-triggered landslides (RTLs) lies in the real-time modelling of the relationship between rainfall and slope stability; this requires an intensive monitoring of some key parameters that could be achieved through the use of modern and often low-cost technologies. This work describes an integrated information system for early warning of RTLs that has been deployed and tested, in a prototypal form, for an Italian <b>pilot</b> site. The <b>core</b> of the proposed system is a wireless sensor network collecting meteorological, hydrological and geotechnical data. Data provided by different sensors and transmitted to a Web-based platform are used by an opportunely designed artificial neural network performing a stability analysis in near real-time or in forecast modality. The system is able to predict whether and when landslides could occur, providing early warnings of potential slope failures. System infrastructure, designed on three interacting levels, encompasses a sensing level, integrating different Web-based sensors, a processing level, using Web standard interoperability services and specifically implemented algorithms, and, finally, a warning level, providing warning information through Web technologies...|$|R
40|$|It is {{well known}} that {{elevations}} in body temperature can impair both physical and cognitive performance. For helicopter pilots, the major heat source during flight originates from solar radiation. However, when nuclear, biological and chemical (NBC) protective clothing is worn, metabolic heat generated during the pre-flight period, and during the mission, is trapped, exacerbating thermal strain. In this project, the hypothesis that elevations in body heat content would degrade flight performance was tested. Helicopter pilots completed three, two-hour flight simulations under three levels of thermal strain, administered in a balanced order. Thermal strain was induced using a water-perfusion gannent, worn under flight and NBC clothing, and supplied with water that would elicit skin temperatures of 33 °C (control), 37 °C (moderate) and 39 °C (hot). Each sortie was programmed and controlled by the simulator flight officer (blind to treatment order), and was comprised of eight flight circuits, each involving takeoff and landing exercises. During each circuit, the pilots were required to identify and solve two operational problems, graded as 2 ̆ 2 easy 2 ̆ 2, 2 ̆ 2 moderate 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 hard 2 ̆ 2. In this report, we present preliminary data from four <b>pilots.</b> Terminal <b>core</b> temperatures for each trial were: 37. 5 °C (± 0. 17; control), 38. 6 °C (± 0. 14; moderate) and 38. 8 °C (± 0. 19; hot). This strain was also reflected within the terminal heart rates: 87. 8 b. min- 1 (± 9. 6; control), 127. 8 b. min- 1 (± 9. 1; moderate) and 150. 8 b. min- 1 (± 6. 1; hot). The simulator officer independently graded pilot performance, and while the moderate trial resulted in slightly reduced performance scores, relative to control (P 3 ̆e 0. 05), scores were significantly lower in the hot trials (P 3 ̆c 0. 05). Strong correlations existed between the thermal load and both the effort needed to sustain the appropriate flight performance, and the pilots 2 ̆ 7 own assessment of performance quality. From these data, it appears that mean body temperature has the most powerful impact upon perceived performance quality, whilst mean skin temperature appears to largely determine effort perception. In both instances, the explained variance currently exceeds 65...|$|R
40|$|The authors {{propose the}} {{introduction}} of a <b>pilot</b> project: "paediatric <b>core</b> file exchange in emergencies" (PCF-EXEM) which enables the exchange of medical data between the attending paediatrician (AP), holder of the medical record, and on-duty medical units (i. e. general practitioners, paediatricians, surgeons, emergency physicians, [...] .). This project is based on two pillars: a protected server (PCF-server) containing paediatric core files (PCF), with important clinical data that should be available for the physician in order to quickly get a clear insight into the relevant clinical medical history of the child, and secondly, the possibility to provide feedback to the attending physician about the findings recorded during the on-call duty. The permanent availability of health data on the PCF-server and the possibility to provide feedback represent together the PCF-EXEM-project. This project meets the demand of the care providers to have relevant medical information permanently available in order to guarantee high quality care in emergency situations. The frail balance between the right to informative privacy and professional confidentiality {{on the one hand and}} the right to quality health care on the other hand has been taken into account. The technical and practical feasibility of this project is described. The objectives and vision of the PCF-EXEM project are conform to Belgian legislation concerning the processing of medical data and are in line with the still under consideration European projects which are focusing on interoperability and the development of a common access control to databanks containing health data for care providers. PCF-EXEM could therefore be a model for other EU countries as well...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 184 - 200). To effectively {{support the}} {{primary health care}} transformation of the South African health system, human resource development is needed. Nurses, {{at the forefront of}} primary care service delivery, urgently need support and advancement to fulfill their role. This study aimed to investigate the impact of core competency training on primary care nurse competence. To begin this investigation, a framework or core competencies was generated through two reference group meetings. This work was followed by a Delphi study to further define core competence in primary care nursing and how best to measure such competence. Nine core competencies were defined which led to the development and <b>piloting</b> of a <b>core</b> competency evaluation tool including a self-lest and observation tool. This early work was followed by the implementation and evaluation of a novel core-competency training program. This program was implemented within district health systems with working clinic nurses. It involved tour distinct sites in three different provinces. A total of 162 nurses took part in the study, including an intervention and reference group. The goal was {{to assess the impact of}} training in a real world setting. Using the self-lest and observation tools, this study showed that competence does improve with this type of training. Additionally, competence is most reliably assessed through observation since test familiarity and possible contamination decrease the usefulness of repeated self-test measures. Further assessment or this novel training program and ref 1 nement of the measurement tool are recommended. This study can serve to inform health policies, particularly regarding human resource development within emerging district health systems. It provides a practical and effective training approach for increasing nurse performance of primary care core competencies...|$|R
