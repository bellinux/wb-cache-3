However, the mechanism that links the EGFR pathway and <b>photocarcinogenesis</b> is not totally understood. In this study, we report that the EGFR/Akt pathway mitigated G 2 /M arrest in human HaCaT keratinocytes and normal human keratinocytes treated with low doses of UVA irradiation. EGFR-mediated Akt activation resulted in increased level of checkpoint 1 kinase (Chk 1) inhibitory phosphorylation (Ser 280). In contrast, EGFR/Akt pathway inhibition resulted in the abrogation of Ser 280 Chk 1 phosphorylation, increased level of Chk 1 stimulatory phosphorylation (Ser 345), and restoration of G 2 /M arrest. Altogether, these results suggest that, after UVA exposure, the EGFR/Akt pathway subverts the G 2 /M checkpoint.

40|$|Excessive {{exposure}} of solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation, particularly its UVB component, to human skin {{is the major}} cause {{for more than a}} million new cases of cutaneous malignancies diagnosed annually in the United States. <b>Photocarcinogenesis,</b> like other cancers, is a multistep process that includes initiation and promotion. A proper understanding of the molecular events occurring during the tumor promotion phase of <b>photocarcinogenesis</b> could lead to the development of novel approaches for the management of skin cancer. Using a transgenic mouse model (K 5 /ODC mice), which overexpresses the enzyme ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) in hair follicle keratinocytes, we studied the role of this gene in <b>photocarcinogenesis.</b> A single UVB-{{exposure of}} 180 mJ/cm 2 to the transgenic mice resulted in a minimal increase in bifold skin thickness and ODC activity. However, in SKH- 1 hairless mice, the most common and highly sensitive model for <b>photocarcinogenesis,</b> and in littermate nontransgenic mice, increases in skin thickness and ODC activity were substantial. In long-term experiments, mice were exposed to 180 mJ/cm 2 of UVB radiation three times a week for 2 weeks (tumor-initiating dose). At 30 weeks after this treatment, in two independent experiments, 40 % of the K 5 /ODC transgenic mice exposed to UVB were found to develop epidermal tumors. The tumors were histologically verified as benign papillomas and squamous cell carcinomas. Interestingly, 100 % of the transgenic mice also developed > 20 pigmented cysts/mouse, which contained keratinocyte material with increased keratinocytic melanization. Under similar UVB-exposure protocol, the nontransgenic littermates or SKH- 1 hairless mice did not develop tumors or pigmented cysts for up to 50 weeks. Oral consumption of α-difluoromethylornithine, an irreversible specific inhibitor of ODC, in the drinking water (1 % w/v) to the transgenic mice resulted in complete prevention of UVB-mediated tumorigenesis and a substantial decrease in the formation of pigmented cysts (< 10 per mouse).

As UVB-induced inflammation is an important tumor-promoting event in the development of skin tumors, we determined the effects of IL- 12 -deficiency on UVB-induced inflammatory responses in mice. For this purpose, IL- 12 -knockout (IL- 12 KO) and their wild-type counterparts were subjected to a <b>photocarcinogenesis</b> protocol; skin and tumor samples were collected at the termination of the experiment, and analyzed for biomarkers of inflammation and their mediators. We found that the levels of infiltrating leukocytes, myeloperoxidase, proliferating cell-nuclear antigen (PCNA), COX- 2, PGE 2, and the proinflammatory cytokines IL- 1 β, TNF-α, and IL- 6 were higher in the UVB-exposed skin of IL- 12 KO than in that of wild-type mice. In a short-term experiment, pretreatment of IL- 12 KO mice with rIL- 12 (50 ng per mouse) before each exposure to UVB increased the repair rate of UVB-induced cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers, while inhibiting UVB-induced increases in myeloperoxidase, COX- 2, PGE 2, PCNA, TNF-α, and IL- 1 β in the skin as compared with non-rIL- 12 -treated IL- 12 KO mice. Similarly, tumors of IL- 12 KO mice expressed higher levels of inflammatory responses than those of wild-type mice.

40|$|Studies {{into the}} effects of topical retinoic acid on <b>photocarcinogenesis</b> have yielded {{ambiguous}} findings. This {{may be due to}} different Experimental protocols and ultraviolet spectra. Retinoic acid is commonly used for a range of dermatologic conditions, and therefore it is important to resolve whether it affects skin tumor formation. To address this issue we used a protocol to mimic as closely as possible human use of retinoic acid. Two mouse strains were used: Skh:HR- 1 (albino) and Skh:HR- 2 (lightly pigmented). The pigmented mice more closely resemble Caucasian skin as they develop a light tan in response to ultraviolet radiation. This tan is greatly augmented by retinoic acid. As these are congenic mice, any differences {{can be attributed to the}} development of a tan. Mice were exposed to solar-simulated ultraviolet radiation, followed by treatment with 0. 05 % retinoic acid. This modeled exposure to sunlight during the day followed by retinoic acid treatment and a night-time period in the absence of sunlight. As it is recommended that ultraviolet exposure is minimized when using topical retinoic acid, the mice were only exposed to one-third of minimal edemal dose of ultraviolet radiation per day. This retinoic acid protocol augmented <b>photocarcinogenesis.</b> Retinoic acid decreased the latency period, reduced the probability that a mouse would survive without a tumor, and increased the number of tumors per mouse. All tumors induced were squamous cell carcinomas, and the skin between the tumors on mice treated with retinoic acid was found to contain carcinoma in situ upon histologic diagnosis. The light tan of the solvent-treated pigmented mice did not provide any protection, whereas the dark tan, which developed in Skh:HR- 2 mice in response to retinoic acid, reduced <b>photocarcinogenesis</b> but did not overcome the augmenting effect of retinoic acid. Thus, using this experimental design, topical retinoic acid augmented <b>photocarcinogenesis,</b> and the ability to develop a dark but not light tan provided some, but limited, protection...|$|E

Using IL- 12 p 40 knockout (KO) mice and their wild-type counterparts and an established <b>photocarcinogenesis</b> protocol, we found that although administration of GTPs (0. 2 %, w/v) in drinking water significantly reduced UVB-induced tumor development in wild-type mice, this treatment had a nonsignificant effect in IL- 12 -KO mice. GTPs resulted in reduction in the levels of markers of inflammation (cyclooxygenase- 2, prostaglandin E 2, proliferating cell nuclear antigen, and cyclin D 1) and proinflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-α, IL- 6, and IL- 1 β) in chronically UVB-exposed skin and skin tumors of wild-type mice but less effective in IL- 12 p 40 -KO mice. UVB-induced DNA damage (cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers) was resolved rapidly in GTPs-treated wild-type mice than untreated wild-type mice and this resolution followed the same time course as the GTPs-induced reduction in the levels of inflammatory responses. This effect of GTPs was less pronounced in IL- 12 -KO mice. The above results were confirmed by treatment of IL- 12 -KO mice with murine recombinant IL- 12 and treatment of wild-type mice with neutralizing anti-IL- 12 antibody.

In previous studies, we demonstrated that UVB irradiation of cells results in the formation of oxidized glycerophosphocholines that exhibit PPARγ ligand activity. We therefore hypothesized that PPARγ would prove to be a chemopreventive target in <b>photocarcinogenesis.</b> We first showed that UVB irradiation of mouse skin causes generation of PPARγ agonist species in vivo. We then generated SKH- 1 hairless, albino mice deficient in epidermal Pparg (Pparg-/-(epi)) using a cytokeratin 14 driven Cre-LoxP strategy. Using a chronic model of UVB <b>photocarcinogenesis,</b> we next showed that Pparg-/-(epi) mice exhibit an earlier onset of tumor formation, increased tumor burden and tumor progression. Increased tumor burden in Pparg-/-(epi) mice was accompanied by a significant increase in epidermal hyperplasia and p 53 positive epidermal cells in surrounding skin lacking tumors. After acute UVB irradiation, Pparg-/-(epi) mice exhibited an augmentation of both UVB-induced Caspase 3 / 7 activity and inflammation. Increased apoptosis and inflammation was also observed after treatment with the PPARγ antagonist GW 9662. With chronic UVB irradiation, Pparg-/-(epi) mice exhibited a sustained increase in erythema and transepidermal water loss relative to wildtype littermates.

Repairing DNA damage, neutralizing {{the activity}} of cis-urocanic acid, and reversing oxidative stress abrogate UV-induced immune suppression and skin cancer induction, suggesting that DNA, UCA, and lipid photo-oxidation serve as UV photoreceptors. What is not clear is whether signaling through each of these different photoreceptors activates independent pathways to induce biological effects or {{whether there is a}} common checkpoint where these pathways converge. Here, we show that agents known to reverse <b>photocarcinogenesis</b> and photoimmune suppression, such as platelet-activating factor (PAF) and serotonin (5 -HT) receptor antagonists, regulate DNA repair. Pyrimidine dimer repair was accelerated in UV-irradiated mice injected with PAF and 5 -HT receptor antagonists.

Injecting PAF and 5 -HT receptor antagonists into UV-irradiated Xeroderma pigmentosum complementation group A–deficient mice, which lack the enzymes responsible for NER, did not accelerate photoproduct repair.

Both exert immunomodulatory activities but are also found to reduce UVR-induced DNA damage presumably via induction of DNA repair. As both cytokines are also produced in the skin, they may mitigate the risk to develop UVR-induced skin cancer. This {{appears to be the}} case as mice lacking p 40 were previously shown to be at higher risk for skin tumors upon chronic UVR exposure. As these mice express neither IL- 12 nor IL- 23, the individual effects of IL- 12 or IL- 23 could not be evaluated. Thus, mice lacking p 35 (IL- 12 p 35 -/-) or p 19 (IL- 23 p 19 -/-) were subjected to chronic UVR exposure.

The skin and tumor samples were collected after chronic exposure of the skin of SKH- 1 hairless mice to UVB radiation using a well-established <b>photocarcinogenesis</b> protocol. We found a distinct DNA hypermethylation pattern in the UVB-exposed epidermal skin and UVB-induced skin tumors that {{was associated with the}} elevated expression and activity of the DNA methyltransferases (Dnmt) 1, Dnmt 3 a and Dnmt 3 b. To explore the role of hypermethylation in skin <b>photocarcinogenesis,</b> we focused on the p 16 INK 4 a and RASSF 1 A tumor suppressor genes, which are transcriptionally silenced on methylation. We established that the silencing of these genes in UVB-exposed epidermis and UVB-induced skin tumors is associated with a network of epigenetic modifications, including hypoacetylation of histone H 3 and H 4 and increased histone deacetylation, as well as recruitment of methyl-binding proteins, including MeCP 2 and MBD 1, to the methylated CpGs. Higher levels of DNA methylation and DNMT activity in human squamous cell carcinoma specimens than in normal human skin suggest that the data are relevant clinically. Our data indicate {{for the first time that}} UVB-induced DNA hypermethylation, enhanced Dnmt activity and histone modifications occur in UVB-exposed skin and UVB-induced skin tumors and suggest that these events are involved in the silencing of tumor suppressor genes and in skin tumor development...|$|E
40|$|Photoaging and <b>photocarcinogenesis</b> are {{primarily}} due to solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation, which alters DNA, cellular antioxidant balance, signal transduction pathways, immunology, and the extracellular matrix (ECM). The DNA alterations include UV radiation induced thymine-thymine dimers and loss of tumor suppressor gene p 53. UV radiation reduces cellular antioxidant status by generating reactive oxygen species (ROS), and the resultant oxidative stress alters signal transduction pathways such as the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), the nuclear factor-kappa beta (NF-κB) /p 65, the janus kinase (JAK), signal transduction and activation of transcription (STAT) and the nuclear factor erythroid 2 -related factor 2 (Nrf 2). UV radiation induces pro-inflammatory genes and causes immunosuppression by depleting the number and activity of the epidermal Langerhans cells. Further, UV radiation remodels the ECM by increasing matrixmetalloproteinases (MMP) and reducing structural collagen and elastin. The photoprotective strategies to prevent/treat photoaging and <b>photocarcinogenesis</b> include oral or topical agents that act as sunscreens or counteract the effects of UV radiation on DNA, cellular antioxidant balance, signal transduction pathways, immunology and the ECM. Many of these agents are phytochemical derivatives and include polyphenols and non-polyphenols. The flavonoids are polyphenols and include catechins, isoflavones, proanthocyanidins, and anthocyanins, whereas the non-flavonoids comprise mono phenolic acids and stilbenes. The natural sources of polyphenols include tea, cocoa, grape/wine, soy, pomegranate, and Polypodium leucotomos. The non-phenolic phytochemicals include carotenoids, caffeine and sulphoraphance (SFN). In addition, there are other phytochemical derivatives or whole extracts such as baicalin, flavangenol, raspberry extract, and Photomorphe umbellata with photoprotective activity against UVB radiation, and thereby carcinogenesi...|$|E
40|$|Skin {{cancer is}} one of the most common health issues afflicting people in many countries, {{particularly}} in Australia. The major cause of skin cancer is ultraviolet radiation (UV), which is also needed for vitamin D synthesis. There is also evidence from the Mason group that the hormonally active form of vitamin D, 1 α, 25 -hydroxyvitamin D 3 (1, 25 (OH) 2 D 3), provides photoprotection. Studies on the effects of 20 (OH) D 3 on DNA damage and immunosuppression done in our laboratory by colleagues, revealed that 20 (OH) D 3 is as effective as 1, 25 (OH) 2 D 3 in reducing thymine dimer formation and UVR-induced immunosuppression in female hairless Skh:hr 1 mice (Tongkao-on et al., 2015). The aim of this project was to explore whether 20 -hydroxyvitamin D 3 (20 (OH) D 3), a product of vitamin D 3 hydroxylation, provides protection against UV-induced <b>photocarcinogenesis.</b> In order to investigate whether the protection against acute UV-induced damage translates into prevention of skin carcinogenesis, the major, in vivo component of this study involved a 40 week <b>photocarcinogenesis</b> study and contact hypersensitivity (CHS) response experiment, with 1, 25 (OH) 2 D 3 and 20 (OH) D 3 applied as topical treatments post UV irradiation. The results from the in vivo study showed that 1, 25 (OH) 2 D 3 was effective at inhibiting UV-induced tumour formation and progression, but 20 (OH) D 3 was not observed to be effective in reducing the following parameters: tumour incidence, tumour latency, tumour multiplicity and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) incidence...|$|E
40|$|AbstractInterleukin- 12 (IL- 12) -deficiency {{promotes}} <b>photocarcinogenesis</b> in mice; {{however, the}} molecular mechanisms underlying this effect {{have not been}} fully elucidated. Here, we report that long-term exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation resulted in enhancement of the levels of cell survival kinases, such as phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase (PI 3 K), Akt (Ser 473), p-ERK 1 / 2, and p-p 38 in the skin of IL- 12 p 40 knockout (IL- 12 KO) mice compared with the skin of wild-type mice. UV-induced activation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) /p 65 in the skin of IL- 12 KO mice was also more prominent. The levels of NF-κB-targeted proteins, such as proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), cyclooxygenase- 2, cyclin D 1, and inducible nitric oxide synthase, {{were higher in the}} UV-exposed skin of IL- 12 KO mice than the UV-exposed skin of wild types. In short-term UV irradiation experiments, subcutaneous treatment of IL- 12 KO mice with recombinant IL- 12 (rIL- 12) or topical treatment with oridonin, an inhibitor of NF-κB, resulted in the inhibition of UV-induced increases in the levels of PCNA, cyclin D 1, and NF-κB compared with non-rIL- 12 - or non-oridonin-treated IL- 12 KO mice. UV-induced skin tumors of IL- 12 KO mice had higher levels of PI 3 K, p-Akt (Ser 473), p-ERK 1 / 2, p-p 38, NF-κB, and PCNA and fewer apoptotic cells than skin tumors of wild types. Together, these data suggest that the loss of endogenous IL- 12 activates survival signals in UV-exposed skin and that may lead to the enhanced <b>photocarcinogenesis</b> in mice...|$|E
40|$|AbstractUltraviolet-B {{irradiation}} {{of human}} dermal fibroblasts has earlier {{been shown to}} induce matrix-degrading metalloproteinases, thus driving connective tissue degradation in photoaging and <b>photocarcinogenesis.</b> Herein, we report that Ultraviolet-B irradiation led to {{a dramatic increase in}} specific mRNA and protein levels of interstitial collagenase, stromelysin and interleukin- 6. By contrast, the major tissue inhibitor of matrix-degrading metalloproteinases, TIMP- 1, was unaffected. Monospecific neutralizing antibodies directed against human interleukin- 6 significantly reduced the interstitial collagenase and stromelysin- 1 protein levels. Taken together, our data provide the first evidence that Ultraviolet-B induction of interstitial collagenase and stromelysin- 1 occurs via the synthesis and release of interleukin- 6. Hence, this newly identified autocrine mechanism may contribute to dermal photodamage...|$|E
