50|$|The Brown Bobby machine resembled and {{operated}} {{similar to a}} waffle iron. Its surfaces were made of aluminium and were <b>prepared</b> for <b>baking</b> by coating with paraffin, though users today would most often use cooking spray. The machine had a high (600 watt/surfaces connected in parallel) and a low (300 watt/surfaces connected in series) setting. Cooking was done on the high setting, the low setting was for allowing the machine to remain idle. Machines were available as either a single (aka Brown Bobby Junior) for US$52 or as two machines riveted together into a single unit for US$100. Since these machines are no longer manufactured they are prized by their owners and often handed down to subsequent generations to continue a tradition of Brown Bobby making, especially during the holidays.|$|R

5000|$|Meat, {{including}} cured meats, such as ham {{can also}} be baked, but baking is usually reserved for meatloaf, smaller cuts of whole meats, or whole meats that contain stuffing or coating such as bread crumbs or buttermilk batter. Some foods are surrounded with moisture during baking by placing {{a small amount of}} liquid (such as water or broth) {{in the bottom of a}} closed pan, and letting it steam up around the food, a method commonly known as braising or slow <b>baking.</b> Larger cuts <b>prepared</b> without stuffing or coating are more often roasted, which is a similar process, using higher temperatures and shorter cooking times. Roasting, however, is only suitable for finer cuts of meat, so other methods have been developed to make tougher meat cuts palatable after baking. One of these is the method known as en croûte (French for [...] "in a crust"), which protects the food from direct heat and seals the natural juices inside. Meat, poultry, game, fish or vegetables can be <b>prepared</b> by <b>baking</b> en croûte. Well-known examples include Beef Wellington, where the beef is encased in pastry before baking; pâté en croûte, where the terrine is encased in pastry before baking; and the Vietnamese variant, a meat-filled pastry called pâté chaud. The en croûte method also allows meat to be baked by burying it in the embers of a fire - a favourite method of cooking venison. In this case, the protective casing (or crust) is made from a paste of flour and water and is discarded before eating. Salt {{can also be}} used to make a protective crust that is not eaten. Another method of protecting food from the heat while it is baking, is to cook it en papillote (French for [...] "in parchment"). In this method, the food is covered by baking paper (or aluminium foil) to protect it while it is being baked. The cooked parcel of food is sometimes served unopened, allowing diners to discover the contents for themselves which adds an element of surprise.|$|R

Meatloaf {{was found to}} be a critical foodstuff which may significantly exceed of the overall migration limit of 60 mg kg - 1 (10 mg sdm - 1) in the first {{as well as in the}} third experiment. The highest siloxane migration found in a meatloaf after preparation in a commercial mould was 177 mg kg - 1. In contrast, milk-based food showed only very low or non detectable migration (- 1) even if consisting of higher fat amounts. Similar results were achieved when using 50 % ethanol as the official simulant for milk-based products as defined in the Plastics Directive 2007 / 19 /EEC. After solvent extraction of the moulds simulating long term usage, no further migration into the food was detectable, indicating that there is no relevant formation of low molecular weight, potentially migrating siloxanes from the elastomer. During repeated usage the investigated moulds showed a high uptake of fat during the use of up to 8. 0 g fat per kg elastomer. The proper tempering of the moulds exhibited a major influence on the migration properties of siloxanes into different foodstuffs. Non-tempered moulds with a high level of volatile organic compounds of 1. 1 % were shown to give considerably higher migration than the equivalent tempered moulds...|$|R
40|$|Restricted until 01 Apr. 2011. Organic {{light-emitting}} diode (OLED) refers to any {{light-emitting diode}} (LED) using exclusively molecular and polymeric materials. Since the first demonstration in late 80 s, OLED {{has been the}} topic of intense interest to both scientific and industrial community. With the progresses made on improving performance, the most advanced OLEDs have demonstrated near unity quantum efficiencies and over {{tens of thousands of}} hour-long lifetime. They have been developed to the point that that they are commercially available in small, hand-held, full color displays and showed great promise in lighting applications as well. All the aforementioned achievements were driven by a series of new materials, device structures and fabrication techniques, which will continue to be the force moving OLED technology towards wider success. This dissertation follows the mainstream of the OLED research, trying to incorporate materials with attractive properties into both conventional and newly-designed device structures, in the mean time demonstrating the advantages in simplicity and performance.; Chapter 1 briefly introduces the basics of OLED and the breakthroughs in the history of OLED research, including the first heterojuction device, doping concept and the application of phosphorescence materials.; Chapter 2 focuses on understanding how the molecular structure affects a property of profound significance to OLED, triplet exciton diffusion length. The study uses a simple and effective device structure to probe the energy transfer and triplet exciton diffusion in this paper. The deliberate mismatch of the HOMO between hosts and dopants and the good hole mobility of host materials are key to the success. We are able to correlate the device performance to the triplet exciton diffusion length and explain the huge discrepancy, based on the data obtained from experiments and theoretical calculations.; The versatility of the device structure discussed in Chapter 2 is proven in Chapter 3, with both two-component and three-component White OLEDs (WOLED) being fabricated using this design. Thanks to the new broad-band yellow emitter, two-component WOLED demonstrated excellent quantum efficiency and superior electroluminescence stability. The study shows the promise of this simple structure in yielding comparable performance to its complicated conventional counterpart.; Chapter 4 unveils a new type of materials called “soft salts”. In this dissertation, “soft salt” are composed of an organometallic cation and an organometallic anion, both Ir-based. The attractive features include solution-processing ready, amipolar and flexible in property tuning. Energy transfer between the ions in solution is observed, and found to take place at diffusion controlled rates. OLEDs prepared using a simple structure yielded external quantum efficiencies close to theoretical maximum, if the front-orbital energies between two ions are aligned properly.; In the end, a thermally cross-linkable electron-transporting polymer is studied with the emphasis on the application in bottom-emitting inverted OLED in Chapter 5. The polymer layer can be easily <b>prepared</b> by <b>baking</b> the spin-casted monomer film under mild conditions. And it is shown that without the aid of interfacial electron injection layer, the polymer lowers the electron injection barrier, resulting in the encouraging device performance...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{cognitive}} deficiencies (CDs) are {{the spectrum}} of deficiencies related to {{the reduction of the}} brain cognitive capability. They mainly affects reasoning, planning and solving capabilities of daily performed activities with the consequence cognitively impaired people become dependent by family or Health Institutes. Some of them are Alzheimer's disease (AD), traumatic brain injuries (TBI), schizophrenia and autism. For cognitively impaired people, meal preparation is a privileged moment and a good opportunity to enhance autonomy, to combat the deficiency effects and a good mean to promote self-esteem as well as social interactions. These are the goals of the Virtual Community Kitchen (VCK) intended for the people affected by CD. The VCK will be an opportunity for a group of this people to connect and meet, for instance once a week, and to attend at distance to a cooking lesson given by a grand chef. Each person will be in his kitchen and will prepare the meal along with the chef. The chef will be remotely able to supervise and to help people. At the end of the activity everyone will eat the meal in her kitchen linked to each participant. VCK focuses on two aspects: autonomous cognitive assistance for meal preparation in a kitchen and cognitive assistance and social interactions in a networked community for cognitively impaired people. A pervasive cognitive assistant in the kitchen. A dynamic context-aware cognitive Virtual Kitchen Assistant (VKA) for meal preparation will be installed in each kitchen and it will share the control between the assistants and the user. Its user interfaces will be a mix of graphical (GUI) and tangible user interfaces (TUI) designed in way to best support augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) approach. AAC is an area of research, clinical and educational practice with the objective to compensate temporary or permanent impairments and activity limitation of individuals with speech and comprehension disorders thanks to any system or device which let them to represents meaningful messages. The meal preparation and related tasks will be defined according to the task analysis best practice. The step by step assistance will mix images, audio notes and video sequences and it will be initiated either by the VKA when it detects the step is over, either by the user when he evaluates a step completion. When VKA detects some actions have not been done or it detects an activity carried out in an inadequate way, it presents again the step highlighting the missing actions and proposes how addressing. Using the whole kitchen, the objects contained in it and the user actions as one user interface, VKA can also provides cues to help the person to find ingredients or utensils necessary for recipe preparation. Community services and group assistance for meal preparation. VCK includes community services to foster social interactions, self-esteem and breaking isolation. In particular, a grand chef will give periodically cooking lessons and people will have the opportunity for grouping and attending at distance to the remote recipe preparation. Each person will be in her kitchen and will prepare the meal with the chef. The chef will be supported by medical and technical staff and he will be remotely able to supervise and to help, directing acting on the remote kitchen. At the end of the activity everyone will eat the meal in his kitchen linked to other participants of the collaborative recipe by the mean of the VCK. Scenario. A cooking lesson will be done in three main phases. The first phase focuses on the activities related of one's participation to the course: registration to the course, management of agenda, recipe selection, buying ingredients, etc. The second phase targets meal preparation per se: gathering ingredients, <b>preparing,</b> cutting, slicing, <b>baking,</b> sharing comments, providing pieces of advice, synchronizing everyone actions and activities, etc. The last phase corresponds to eating together at distance, sharing impression, ambiance and seeing each other. Such a scenario is fully suitable on the needs of any person, cognitive impaired or not because they are solutions for ADLs in a human society there people has a great number of things to remember and often they forget actions (i. e. buy one ingredient for cooking the dinner, find one utensil in the kitchen) that sometime could be dangerous (i. e. forget the oven on). Conclusions. The features of VCK vision makes it an AAL long-term project involving numerous and heterogeneous research fields ranging from industrial design, ergonomics, psychology, human-computer interaction and sensor networks to AAC, remote monitoring, semantics and task analysis. At the moment, the studies have produced Archipel, a robust pervasive cognitive assistant tested with people affected by mental retardation. It will be the core of the VKA. Other several on-going works included in VCK are focused on identifying user interaction as intuitive as possible hiding the complexity of the supporting technologies, on modelling the mental cognition and perception and on integrate medical appliances on the home sensor network. VCK studies and works are driven by the awareness it can find concrete solutions to help the growing number of people affected by CD, it can reduce the social-economical impact and enhance their autonomous daily living. Just to give some numbers: on 2040 only the people affected by AD are estimated on 81 million while the economic costs to United States society associated to autism, AD, schizophrenia and mental retardation on 2006 has been quantified on $ 250 billio...|$|R
