60|$|Once {{across the}} swale {{he put his}} pony to a gallop and soon reached Uncle George's homestead. No one at home! The horse and wagon were gone. <b>Pan</b> <b>left</b> his package and turned back. As he trotted past the Blake gate Pan heard a faint call. It startled him. Reining in Curly he listened and looked. Blake's cabin stood back out of sight among the Cottonwoods. The barn, however, with its low open-sided shed, stood just inside the gate. The cows had been brought in for milking. A lusty calf was trying to steal milk from its mother. Chickens were going to roost. Pan {{did not believe that}} any of these had made the call. He was about to ride on by when {{suddenly}} he again caught a strange cry that appeared to come from the barn or shed. It excited rather than frightened him. Sliding off Curly he pushed open the big board gate and ran in.|$|E

50|$|Kozak's {{video is}} under {{constant}} criticism, with questions like why it never <b>pans</b> <b>left,</b> possibly {{because of a}} boat that may have carried the creature.

60|$|<b>Pan</b> <b>left</b> {{the cowboy}} {{there in the}} darkness, and {{returned}} to camp. His conscience questioned him, but he had only satisfaction, even gladness in reply. Blinky {{had been one of}} the wild cowboys, and had been going from bad to worse. If an overpowering love gripped him, a yielding to it in a right way might make a better man of him. Pan could not see anything else. He had known more than one good-for-nothing cowboy, drinking and gambling himself straight to hell, who had fooled his detractors and had taken the narrow trail for a woman others deemed worthless. There was something about this kind of fight that appealed to Pan. As for the girl, Louise Melliss, and her reaction to such a desperate climax, Pan had only his strange faith that it might create a revolution in her soul. At least he was absolutely sure she would never return to such a life, and she was young.|$|E
60|$|Pan {{had been}} deceived in his {{estimate}} {{of the size of}} the valley. They rode ten miles west before they began to get into rougher ground, scaly with broken rock, and gradually failing in vegetation. The notch of the west end loomed up, ragged and brushy, evidently a wild jumble of cliffs, ledges, timber and brush. The green patch at the foot meant water and willows. <b>Pan</b> <b>left</b> his father to watch from a high point while he rode on five miles farther. The ascent of the valley was like a bowl. The time came when he gazed back and down over the whole valley. Before him lines and dots of green, widely scattered, told of more places where water ran. Strings of horses moved to and fro, so far away that they were scarcely distinguishable. Beyond these points no horses could be seen. The wash wound like a black ribbon out of sight. The vast sloping lines of valley swept majestically down from the wooded bluff-like sides. It was an austere, gray hollow of the earth, with all depressions and ridges blending beautifully into the soft gray-green dotted surface.|$|E

5000|$|Of {{particular}} note is {{the elaborate}} [...] "Chattanooga Choo Choo" [...] sequence. The scene begins at a rehearsal with the Glenn Miller Orchestra practising [...] "Chattanooga Choo Choo" [...] and includes two choruses {{of the song}} whistled and sung by Tex Beneke in a musical exchange with The Modernaires. As the Miller band concludes their feature the camera <b>pans</b> <b>left</b> to reveal a railway station set.

50|$|The {{dough is}} at first quite heavy, stiff and dry, but with {{kneading}} and resting becomes very elastic and strong. It is rolled {{out into a}} large sheet, thick or thin depending on taste. One aesthetic principle is that the dough and filling layers should be of equal thickness. Another is that more layers are better. The filling is spread over the dough, which is then rolled into a long cylinder or log. Traditional recipes usually involve brushing the log with the egg white {{left over from the}} yolk used in the dough. Other recipes use different washes, or an icing added after baking. The unbaked log is gently transferred to a sheet <b>pan,</b> <b>left</b> to rise, then baked until golden brown.|$|E

5000|$|This {{video was}} {{produced}} by ARK of Sheffield, UK and released in May 2004. It depicts a populated civilised planet, probably a New Earth on which humans have settled. The camera's POV begins with a city, possibly London, firing missiles off-camera. As the camera <b>pans</b> <b>left,</b> the viewer can see massive walls of ice that suggest {{the leading edge of}} an encroaching glacier. This is the apparent target for the weapons. Muse is then shown to be on a very large, futuristic rocketship launching into space.

5000|$|Captain James Hook {{is played}} by Dustin Hoffman. Hook kidnaps the {{children}} of the adult Peter to lure his arch-enemy back to Neverland and gives the middle-aged man three days to rekindle his spirit. Hook has been somewhat depressed since Peter <b>Pan</b> <b>left</b> Neverland to become Peter Banning (Robin Williams), and Hook worries he has nothing left to accomplish; he has long since killed the crocodile and made it into a quiet clock tower. Despite killing the crocodile, he remains terrified of a clock's ticking. At Mr. Smee's suggestion, Hook attempts to persuade Peter's children that their father never loved them, in order to coerce them to stay in Neverland. He is successful with Jack, Peter's son, who soon sees Hook as the attentive father figure that Peter has never been. Peter's daughter, Maggie, mistrusts Hook immediately and refuses to be swayed. Hook decides to hold Maggie hostage until Peter's failure to rescue her ruins her faith in him. This backfires when Peter and the Lost Boys rescue her immediately. Jack sees Hook stab Rufio to death in duel, and realizes how much his father cares for the Lost Boys. Jack turns against Hook and embraces his real father. As Peter leaves the ship with his children and the Lost Boys, Hook orders him to come back. Maggie tells him off, stating Hook needs a mother to straighten his bad attitude. After Hook vows to kidnap future generations of children in Peter's family, Peter and Hook engage in a final duel amidst a circle of Lost Boys, wherein Hook is apparently [...] "eaten" [...] when the crocodile clock tower falls on him.|$|E
5000|$|When {{a single}} unit is selected, {{information}} about that unit {{appears in the}} [...] "Status Bar" [...] {{at the top of}} the HUD; the unit's name, a brief biography, how many kills he has, how many battles he has survived, and (if he is capable of carrying items) his inventory. When multiple units are selected, the names, types, and quantity of units will appear, but there will be no biography or information on their kills or previous battles. The HUD also features a transparent overhead mini-map, which displays information about the current battlefield; the player's field of vision is indicated by a yellow trapezoid, enemy units appear as red dots, friendly non-playable units as blue dots, and the player's army as green dots. The player can click anywhere on the mini-map to instantly jump to that location. However, the mini-map does not initially display the entire battlefield; the player must explore the area for it to become fully mapped. In Soulblighter, the player can also order troops to move to any location on the mapped area of the battlefield by right-clicking on that area in the mini-map. The player has full control over the camera throughout the game, and can move it backwards and forwards, left and right, orbit left and right (keeps the camera focused on a single spot while making a 360 degree circle around that spot), <b>pan</b> <b>left</b> and right (the camera remains in the same spot but the player's point of view moves from side to side), and zoom in and out.

As it moves, it is shown to be an extreme {{close-up}} of an eyelid; it fills the entire screen. The eye opens, slowly, closes, opens again, blinks and then fades into a different rippled image, still somewhat organic but changed, still. As the camera begins to pan right and up, it is discernable as a wall; we are outside a building (an old factory situated in Lower Manhattan). It is summer, though {{it is hard to}} tell. The camera’s movement is not smooth. It is as if it is looking for something. Eventually, it loses interest and <b>pans</b> <b>left</b> and down back to the wall.|$|R
5000|$|The {{style of}} the song has been {{referred}} to as [...] "acid-fueled blues".
