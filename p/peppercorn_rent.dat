5|$|By the 2010s the {{building}} was owned by Enterprise Inns, who own around 5,500 pubs in the UK. Despite advertising for a new lease of {{the building}} in circa 2013 whilst letting the property for a <b>peppercorn</b> <b>rent,</b> Enterprise Inns ultimately decided to sell the property as a freehold in March 2015. No offers to continue operating the building as a pub were received, although some offers were received from developers seeking to redevelop the property, perhaps due to the substantial refurbishment of the building that was required.|$|E
5|$|The {{ground was}} first {{constructed}} in 1905, soon before the club moved in. The club rented the ground until 1933, when newly appointed chairman Charles Jeyes organised {{the purchase of}} the stadium. The club retained ownership of the ground until February 1989, when the freehold was sold to Luton Borough Council for £3.25million. The club was granted a seven-year lease at <b>peppercorn</b> <b>rent</b> for its continued use. This arrangement has been extended several times, and as of 2015 is due to end in 2028.|$|E
5|$|The market {{halls and}} several other {{buildings}} in Covent Garden were bought by CapCo in partnership with GE Real Estate in August 2006 for £421 million, on a 150-year head lease. The buildings are let to the Covent Garden Area Trust, who pay an annual <b>peppercorn</b> <b>rent</b> of one red apple and a posy of flowers for each head lease, and the Trust protects the property from being redeveloped. In March 2007 CapCo also acquired the shops located under the Royal Opera House. The complete Covent Garden Estate owned by CapCo consists of , and has a market value of £650 million.|$|E
50|$|In 2002 then Wrexham F.C. {{chairman}} William Pryce Griffiths {{secured a}} 125-year lease on the Racecourse with Wolverhampton Dudley Breweries for £750,000, and a <b>peppercorn</b> annual <b>rent</b> of £1. The club hosted TNS vs Liverpool in a UEFA Champions League qualifier in 2005.|$|R
50|$|Dolans Bay {{was named}} after a land owner in the area called Dominick Dolan. In 1858 Mary and Andrew Webster paid 108 pounds and 15 shillings plus a yearly <b>peppercorn</b> quit <b>rent</b> for their land in this area. The Websters sold their land to Dominick Dolan in 1863.|$|R
50|$|In 1858 Mary and Andrew Webster paid 108 {{pounds and}} 15 shillings plus a yearly <b>peppercorn</b> quit <b>rent</b> for their land here. The Websters sold their land to Dominick Dolan in 1863. James Wilson {{purchased}} his block of 252 acre for 252 pounds in 1862. In 1866, {{he sold his}} land to Thomas Holt (1811-1888), who added it to his huge 12000 acre estate that stretched from Sutherland to Cronulla.|$|R
5|$|He was {{a friend}} of Queen guitarist and {{astrophysicist}} Brian May, who was an occasional guest on The Sky at Night. May bought Moore's Selsey home in 2008, leasing it back to him for a <b>peppercorn</b> <b>rent</b> the same day to provide financial security. May, Moore and Chris Lintott co-wrote a book Bang! The Complete History of the Universe. In February 2011, Moore completed (with Robin Rees and Iain Nicolson) his comprehensive Patrick Moore's Data Book of Astronomy for Cambridge University Press. In 1986 he was identified as the co-author of a book published in 1954 called Flying Saucer from Mars, attributed to Cedric Allingham, which was intended as a money-making venture and practical joke on UFO believers; Moore never admitted his involvement. He once joined the Flat Earth Society as an ironic joke.|$|E
25|$|In 2006 {{the cottage}} was {{donated to the}} Town of Vincent, who leased {{it back to the}} VVAA WA for a <b>peppercorn</b> <b>rent.</b> It is now used as the VVAA WA's {{headquarters}} and a museum, and is occasionally open to the public.|$|E

50|$|Thomas Holt (1811-88) owned most of {{the land}} that {{stretched}} from Sutherland to Cronulla, including land here. In 1840, parish maps also showed that 20 acre of land on this point were owned by Francis Mitchell.

50|$|In 1888 the Birmingham Society for the Preservation of Open Spaces {{purchased}} Rednal Hill {{and handed}} it to the city in trust. They also arranged for Pinfield Wood and Bilberry Hill to be leased on a <b>peppercorn</b> (nominal) <b>rent.</b> Birmingham City Council finally purchased Cofton Hill, Lickey Warren and Pinfield Wood outright in 1920. With the eventual purchase of the Rose Hill Estate from the Cadbury family in 1923, free public access was finally restored to the entire hills.|$|R
50|$|Rent is a {{requirement}} of leases in some common law jurisdictions, but not in civil law jurisdictions. In England and Wales it {{was held in the}} case of Ashburn Anstalt v Arnold that rent was not {{a requirement}} for there to be a lease, however the court will more often construe a licence where no rent is paid as it is seen as evidence for no intention to create legal relations. There is no requirement for the rent to be a commercial amount; a <b>peppercorn</b> or <b>rent</b> of some nominal amount is sufficient for this requirement.|$|R
25|$|In 1995, Darlington {{borough council}} offered the trust {{use of the}} Hopetown {{carriage}} works, at an appropriately named <b>Peppercorn</b> <b>rent.</b> The trust named the Hopetown site as the Darlington Locomotive Works.

25|$|Sainsbury's won {{a bidding}} process in March 2012 and agreed a £30m deal to buy Bristol Rovers F.C. 12,000-capacity Memorial Stadium in north Bristol, and lease {{it back for}} a <b>peppercorn</b> <b>rent</b> until the new ground was ready, and then redevelop the old stadium as a new store. The club hoped {{the money from the}} sale would largely finance a new UWE Stadium.|$|E
25|$|The {{closure of}} Waverley Park in 1999 was a setback as Hawthorn {{could no longer}} play home games in the {{south-east}} region where they have developed a large support base. Home games were moved to the Melbourne Cricket Ground. Their relationship with the south-east was rekindled in 2006, when the Hawks returned to Waverley as a training and administration centre. The oval and {{a section of the}} Sir Kenneth Luke stand have been retained by developer Mirvac as part of their redevelopment of the Waverley site as a housing estate, {{largely as a result of}} a Victorian government commitment to keep football there. Mirvac leases the facility to Hawthorn for a <b>peppercorn</b> <b>rent,</b> until the club takes ownership of the facility within the next 20 years. Hawthorn will maintain their association with Glenferrie, by housing several coteries and conducting social activities at the club's spiritual home.|$|E
50|$|The Sevenoaks Vine Cricket Club in Sevenoaks, England, rents the Vine Cricket Ground from Sevenoaks Town Council at {{a yearly}} <b>rent</b> of one <b>peppercorn.</b> It is many {{years since the}} club paid only one <b>peppercorn</b> for the <b>rent</b> of the pavilion.

50|$|The manor {{was sold}} by crown charter in 1682 to the Earl of Plymouth. The Earl lived at nearby Tardebigge and his {{descendants}} would own the lands at Longbridge, Rednal, Cofton Hackett and the Lickey Hills {{for the next}} 250 years.

25|$|In 1712 {{the church}} {{requested}} a royal charter; {{seven years later}} it was granted by King George I {{in exchange for a}} <b>peppercorn</b> in <b>rent</b> every year. Two years later, in 1721, it was expanded, early in the half-century tenure of Dominie Petrus Vas. A doop huys, a sort of chapel, was built to handle baptisms, meetings and other consistorial activities. Vas would, three decades later, oversee the construction of a second church building. Surviving prints show a gambrel-roofed meetinghouse two bays wide with a tower on the front. Its siding seems to have been limestone rubble, although the first print shows a material that could be either in a coursed ashlar pattern or parging to mimic coursed stone. Fenestration consisted of three round-arched windows along the sides. It was dedicated on November 29, 1752, by Georg Wilhelm Mancius, Vas's assistant.|$|R
500|$|Middleton Park, {{once the}} private estate of the lords of the manor of Middleton, {{is owned by}} Wade's Charity and leased to Leeds City Council for a <b>peppercorn</b> <b>rent.</b> It {{has been one of}} Leeds many public parks since 1919 {{covering}} an area of nearly a square mile, , of which [...] are of ancient woodland. There is a small lake, recreational areas and a golf course. The reclaimed site of Middleton Broom Pit was incorporated into the park. Two areas of the park, comprising ancient waggonways which are now surfaced footpaths, earthworks and remains of underground workings and shaft mounds, have been designated a scheduled ancient monument.|$|E
2500|$|... in Peppercorns were a much-prized trade good, often {{referred}} to as [...] "black gold" [...] and used as a form of commodity money. The legacy of this trade remains in some Western legal systems that recognize the term <b>peppercorn</b> <b>rent</b> as a token payment for something that is, essentially, being given.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the same}} year, Dorset {{presented}} the Vine Cricket Ground, at Knole, Sevenoaks, Kent, to the town, at a <b>peppercorn</b> <b>rent,</b> literally. It {{is one of}} the oldest cricket grounds in England. The first nationally reported cricket match had taken place here in the 1734 season when [...] "The Gentlemen of Kent" [...] beat [...] "The Gentlemen of Sussex". Sevenoaks Town Council still has the Vine Cricket Club, though the rent doubled to two peppercorns after the pavilion was built in the 19th century. They must also pay the Lord Sackville (if asked) one cricket ball on 21 July each year.|$|E

It was gutted, but the walls still stood. The congregation strongly supported the Patriot cause throughout the war. In 1782, George Washington, garrisoned near Newburgh to the south, visited the church. He enjoyed his visit enough that he wrote the congregation the letter of thanks currently displayed in its museum. By 1790 repairs to the church were complete. The tower was rebuilt with a cupola and clocks on all sides.|$|R
2500|$|Sevenoaks Vine Cricket Club pay Sevenoaks Town Council a rent of 1 peppercorn {{per year}} {{for the use of}} the ground, the archetypal <b>peppercorn</b> <b>rent,</b> but pay for all of the upkeep of The Vine even though it is common ground. [...] SVCC used to pay one peppercorn for the {{pavilion}} but that has now assumed a more commercial rent of about £3600 p.a. and is paid by the Sevenoaks Vine Club. In keeping with tradition SVCC pay Lord Sackville (if asked) one cricket ball on 21 July each year.

2500|$|The Scottish Maritime Museum {{had agreed}} a {{contract}} with the owner of the slipway on which City of Adelaide was stored, specifying a <b>peppercorn</b> <b>rent</b> of £1 a year. However the contract included a penalty clause requiring payment of £50,000 per year should the owner require the museum to vacate the slipway. [...] SMM were given notice to quit in April 1999, and rental began to accrue. Faced with these potential demands, and unable to find a buyer for the vessel, in May 2000 the trustees of the Scottish Maritime Museum applied to North Ayrshire Council for listed building consent to deconstruct City of Adelaide. The Council received over 100 objections, including representations from nine significant maritime heritage organisations around the world. Members of the UK and Scottish Parliaments objected, as well as the Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer and Australian ex-Senator and diplomat Robert Hill. The Council refused demolition in February 2001.|$|E

[...] The Vicar declared that he was altogether ignorant of what had been done between the agent for the Marquis and the trustees to whom had been committed the building of the chapel.
