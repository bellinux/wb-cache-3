A more advanced example might use edge detection to return both numerical information and a processed image representing outlines to a computer vision program controlling, say, a mobile robot. Because the GPU has fast and local hardware access to every pixel or other <b>picture</b> <b>element</b> in an image, it can analyze and average it (for the first example) or apply a Sobel edge filter or other convolution filter (for the second) with much greater speed than a CPU, which typically must access slower random-access memory copies of the graphic in question.|$|E

2500|$|About half of {{the region}} was beyond the {{terminator}} during the three Mariner 10 encounters and hence not visible. The entire mapped area was covered by near-vertical photography from the second encounter, and the eastern part, from longitude 15° to about 110°, was covered by oblique photography from the first encounter. No third-encounter images were acquired. The entire visible area may be viewed stereoscopically by combining images from {{the first and second}} encounters taken at different viewing angles or by combining second-encounter images of the same area taken at different viewing angles. These combinations provided excellent qualitative control of topographic relief and a good quantitative photogrammetric base. However, sun-elevation angles of the images are limited to less than 25°, and image resolutions are no higher than about 0.5km per <b>picture</b> <b>element.</b> Therefore, the south polar geologic map reflects mostly large-scale processes and topographic information, whereas other mercurian quadrangle maps benefit from greater albedo discrimination and, in some cases, higher resolution.|$|E

Partial objects of <b>picture</b> <b>elements</b> of one type are determined based on comparison {{with one of the}} thresholds, and <b>picture</b> <b>elements</b> of another type are determined based on comparison with the other threshold. Two of the partial objects are combined to an extended partial object by the <b>picture</b> <b>elements</b> of the latter type. The partial object to be detected is described by a sum of the partial objects and/or the sum of the acquired extended partial objects. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - INDEPENDENT CLAIMS are also included for the following: (1) a computer program comprising a set of instructions to perform a method of detecting an object on an image representable by <b>picture</b> <b>elements</b> (2) an apparatus for detecting an object on an image representable by <b>picture</b> <b>elements,</b> comprising a determiner. USE - Method for detecting an object i. e. scratch-type object, on an image representable by <b>picture</b> <b>elements</b> for an industrial application. Uses include {{but are not limited to}} industrial image processing, segmentation, formative or morphological processing, surface inspection and adaptive thresholding.

50|$|The {{frame is}} {{composed}} of <b>picture</b> <b>elements</b> just like a chess board. Each horizontal set of <b>picture</b> <b>elements</b> {{is known as a}} line. The <b>picture</b> <b>elements</b> in a line are transmitted as sine signals where a pair of dots, one dark and one light can be represented by a single sine. The product of the number of lines and the number of maximum sine signals per line is known as the total resolution of the frame. The higher the resolution the more faithful the displayed image is to the original image. But higher resolution introduces technical problems and extra cost. So a compromise should be reached in system designs both for satisfactory image quality and affordable price.|$|R

By contrast, in a modulated homogeneous field, the <b>picture</b> <b>elements</b> are identical in phase. Flicker frequency thresholds for {{these two types of}} fields were measured {{as a function of the}} modulation depth of the stimuli (De Lange curves). Similar results were obtained under both display conditions, the frequency thresholds for the modulated homogeneous field being somewhat higher. A further experiment showed that the subjective impression of flicker increases rapidly as frequency is reduced to below the critical fusion frequency at which flicker is reported 50 % of the time. On the basis of these results, it is argued that flicker thresholds for VDUs can be estimated safely by using modulated homogeneous fields with comparable parameters...|$|R
