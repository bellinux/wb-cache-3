40|$|The Criminal Justice Act 2003 {{introduces}} {{statutory provisions}} regulating {{the extent to}} which a defendant may adduce a co-defendant's confession in a joint trial. The relevant provisions are based upon the recommendations of the Law Commission. In this article it is argued that the Law Commission's analysis was overly narrow, and that as a consequence the emerging legislation is unsatisfactory in several significant respects, to the extent that it may even be incompatible with Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights. The potential for curing the highlighted deficiencies within the legislation is considered.

40|$|How well do hearsay rules {{function}} {{under the}} current Federal Rules of Evidence? One issue, dormant yet pulsating beneath the surface for decades, involves the admissibility of prior <b>inconsistent</b> <b>statements</b> by witnesses. The long-standing “orthodox” rule admitted the prior statement only to impeach the witness’s trial testimony; {{it could not be}} used as substantive evidence of the facts asserted. In 1972, the Advisory Committee on the Federal Rules of Evidence (“the Advisory Committee” or “the Committee”) proposed an innovative rule permitting all prior <b>inconsistent</b> <b>statements</b> to be used both for impeachment and as substantive evidence—a sea change in practice. Congress, however, torpedoed the proposal for reasons that rang hollow in the mid- 1970 s and which remain so today. Experience has proven the Committee’s wisdom...|$|R

40|$|The {{common law}} {{has come a}} long way since Sir Walter Raleigh was convicted of treason on the basis of accusations {{contained}} in unproduced letters and the hearsay declarations of unproduced witnesses. However, despite the painstaking development and innumerable formulations and reformulations of the hearsay rule over the past several centuries, there are areas of that body of law which are as yet unsettled and the subject of heated controversy. One such area is that of prior <b>inconsistent</b> <b>statements</b> of witnesses, the controversy over which has continued over the years and has surfaced once again with promulgation of the new Federal Rules of Evidence. Legal theories, like social and cultural philosophies, often follow marked trends and patterns. A few years ago exclusionary rules were on the ascendancy, especially in the area of criminal law, while today it is increased admissibility which is in vogue. Both had their advocates throughout common law history, and will probably always find support. It is a reflection of this current trend that the traditional rules governing substantive use of prior <b>inconsistent</b> <b>statements,</b> once unquestioningly accepted, have since been roundly criticized by authorities from Wigmore to the Supreme Court. The purpose of this article is to attempt to redress the balance just slightly, by setting out some of the counterarguments which lie behind the traditional substantive exclusion of prior <b>inconsistent</b> <b>statements.</b> An attempt will be made to emphasize practical, rather than merely theoretical, considerations...|$|R

40|$|Federal Rule of Evidence 801 (d) (1) (A) is a compromise.

The Court’s proposal was strongly favored by the Advisory Committee on the Federal Rules of Evidence (or “the Advisory Committee”) members who drafted the Rule.
