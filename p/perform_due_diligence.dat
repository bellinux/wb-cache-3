50|$|Because {{a public}} charity houses the fund, donors receive the maximum tax {{deduction}} available, while avoiding excise taxes and other restrictions imposed on private foundations.

50|$|In its {{submissions}} to the Tribunal, the SRFC {{emphasized the}} severity of the IUU fishing problem in West Africa and the need for a clear regime of flag state responsibilities with respect to vessels engaged in this trade. The SRFC argued that its member states had been unable to mount successful prosecutions against IUU fishers following boardings {{due to a lack of}} support and cooperation from flag states. A number of states and international organizations also made submissions adopting a range positions with respect to the four questions above. It was held by some states that the Tribunal lacked the advisory jurisdiction to respond to these questions. Both the government of Spain, a major contributor to the problem of IUU fishing, as well as the United Kingdom adopted such a view. A number of other states took the position that flag state responsibility for IUU fishing should take the form of a general responsibility to <b>perform</b> <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> with respect to vessels and their activities, rather than an obligation to assist in prosecutions or another other more substantive requirement. In its Advisory Opinion issued on April 2, 2015, the Tribunal adopted the “due diligence” approach. The Tribunal found that flag states are under only a general obligation to take the necessary measures to ensure that their nationals and vessels flying their flag are not engaged in IUU fishing activities. This obligation may be satisfied by adhering to generally accepted international norms of fishing vessel regulation and complying with international treaties that indicate best practices. At the same time, the Tribunal found that in coastal waters the coastal state bears primary responsibility for preventing IUU fishing and not the flag state.|$|E
5000|$|The New York Times {{reported}} on Monday, 5 December 2011 that Global Witness had {{withdrawn from the}} Kimberley Process coalition, saying that it felt the effort no longer effectively ensured that conflict diamonds did not make their way onto retail markets. The organization is the first advocacy group to leave the program. While the organization had expressed concerns over {{the operation of the}} Kimberley Process for some time, the final straw leading to its withdrawal was the decision to allow Zimbabwe to export diamonds from the Marange fields, where there have been reports of widespread human rights abuses by government security forces. “It’s the most egregious situation that we’ve seen since the Kimberley Process was launched, where diamonds have been fueling violence and human rights violations, and the Kimberley has really failed to deal with that effectively,” said Annie Dunnebacke, the senior campaigner for Global Witness. The diamond industry was “hiding behind the Kimberley Process,” Ms. Dunnebacke said, adding that many traders and dealers did not <b>perform</b> <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> in checking the actual source of the diamonds they were dealing. “They’ve just been saying, ‘We have the Kimberley Process for diamonds, so that’s that. We’ve solved the problem of blood diamonds.’” Farai Maguwu, the director of the Zimbabwe-based Centre for Research and Development, which {{is also a member of}} the Kimberley Process, said he believed Global Witness’s withdrawal was not enough to bring down the entire Kimberley Process. But, he said, “it’s a very big blow. The Kimberley Process will never be the same without the Global Witness,” Mr. Maguwu said. “A very influential member of the Kimberley Process has cast a vote of no confidence in the Kimberley Process, which will affect the way the whole world views the Kimberley Process going forward.” ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} how the all-or-nothing {{model can}} dis-incentivize crowd investors to <b>perform</b> <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> over the fraud or failure risks of crowdfunding campaign. Specifically, the major upside {{of this model}} is that a project cannot be funded without a critical mass investing. If enough individual in this critical mass of crowd investors perform its due diligence to check whether projects will become successful then the model function; instead, this paper argues that this model incentivizes the crowd to produce noisy information that cannot be relied. In the all-or-nothing model, sequential investments encourages rational investors not <b>perform</b> <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> because they relied on the self-interest of prior investors to <b>perform</b> <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> while non-fully rational investors may rely {{on the belief that}} prior investors have better information than they might gather.
