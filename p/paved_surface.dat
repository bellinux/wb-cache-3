5|$|The Soviet Union had 7,192 {{airports}}, {{of which}} 1,163 had <b>paved</b> <b>surface.</b> By the 1980s most airports were having capacity problems, an example being the Lviv airport {{which had to}} cope with an average of 840 passengers each day, while the airport was built to handle 200. Another daunting problem was the lack of modernisation, with the Sheremetyevo International Airport (Moscow's main airport) being the only airport in the USSR to have been fully computerised.|$|E
25|$|On November 28, 2004, {{the nose}} landing gear of KLM Flight 1673, a Boeing 737-400, struck a bird during takeoff at Amsterdam Airport Schiphol. The {{incident}} was reported to air traffic control, the landing gear was raised normally, and the flight continued normally to its destination. Upon touching down at Barcelona International Airport, the aircraft started deviating {{to the left of}} the runway centreline. The crew applied right rudder, braking, and the nose wheel steering tiller but could not keep the aircraft on the runway. After it veered off the <b>paved</b> <b>surface</b> of the runway at about 100 knots, the jet went through an area of soft sand. The {{nose landing gear}} leg collapsed and the left main landing gear leg detached from its fittings shortly before the aircraft came to a stop perched over the edge of a drainage canal. All 140 passengers and six crew evacuated safely, but the aircraft itself had to be written off. The cause was discovered to be a broken cable in the nose wheel steering system caused by the bird collision. Contributing to the snapped cable was the improper application of grease during routine maintenance which led to severe wear of the cable.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn {{recent years}} {{increased}} the research {{interest in the}} development of different approaches to support the mobility of the visually impaired. The automatic detection of tactile <b>paving</b> <b>surface</b> is one important topic of research, not only to help the mobility of visually impaired persons, but also for use in the displacement of autonomous robots, providing a safely route and warnings. In this paper we propose an approach for tactile <b>paving</b> <b>surface</b> detection in real-time with the purpose to assist visually impaired persons. It uses computer vision algorithms combined with decision tree to eliminate some possible false alarms. We assume the visually impaired persons holds a smartphone, which is used to obtain images, as well as to assist him by audio feedback to keep it on the tactile <b>paving</b> <b>surface.</b> This problem is very challenging, mainly due to illumination changes, occlusion, image noise and resolution, as well as different possible colors of the tactile <b>paving</b> <b>surfaces.</b> Experimental results indicate that the proposed approach works well in low resolution images, effectively detecting the tactile <b>paving</b> <b>surfaces</b> in real test scenarios...|$|R

500|$|North Carolina Highway 2A (NC 2A) was a {{state highway}} located in {{southern}} Moore County, in the U.S. state of North Carolina. The highway traveled from an intersection with U.S. Route 1 (US 1), now May Street, northward through portions of Manly and Southern Pines to an intersection with NC 22 (now US 1). The highway was first listed {{as part of the}} Moore County road system by at least 1930. The route was improved to a <b>paved</b> <b>surface</b> by 1936. NC 2A was numbered sometime between 1945 and 1949. By 1952, it was cancelled and Highway 2 was designated over the route. It has since been numbered Secondary Road 2029 (SR 2029).|$|E

Whilst the road ultimately connects Gloucestershire to South Yorkshire, locally, the road was important for connecting Metchley Fort in Edgbaston with Letocetum, now Wall, in Staffordshire. The road is most visible from near to the pedestrian gate on Thornhill Road (OS Grid Reference SP 08759 98830), where the [...] wide bank that formed the road surface is most prominent. Excavations at the road have showed that it was made from compacted gravel, never having a <b>paved</b> <b>surface.</b> Along each side are intermittent ditches, marked by Roman engineers, and beyond these are hollows where gravel was excavated to make the road surface. At least three Roman coins have been found along the course of Icknield Street through Sutton Park, {{as well as a}} Roman pottery kiln elsewhere in the town.|$|E
2500|$|In 1947 and 1948, {{the highway}} was paved from North Portal to its {{junction}} with Hwy 6 at Corinne. [...] However, the <b>paved</b> <b>surface</b> fell into disrepair {{within a few}} years; a Leader-Post reporter wrote in 1953 that [...] "practically the entire road, from North Portal through to Corinne is just a mass of large gaping potholes, ruts, and cracks, and in some places the hard surface is gone completely." [...] Saskatchewan Motor Transport association director A.R. Mang blamed the poor condition of the road on a failure to place a suitable [...] "base course", a layer of gravel and clay, between the pavement and the road's earthen base. [...] A 1955 map shows that a segment between Estevan and Lang had reverted to gravel and a 1956 highway map shows the entire segment between Weyburn and Estevan as a gravel highway. [...] These maps also show the segment between Corinne and the junction with the Trans Canada Highway as gravel. [...] Repairs were carried out at considerable expense, but the situation required temporary bans on heavy traffic and the rerouting of traffic along nearby roads.|$|E
2500|$|Primarily, the Miller Highway {{consisted}} of six lanes, supported above the street level on steel columns, which were located {{at regular intervals}} (~80 feet) at the outer edges and center of the roadway. [...] Longitudinal strength girders ran between the support columns along {{the direction of the}} roadway. [...] The longitudinal girders supported the industrial looking balustrades and the median. [...] Lateral strength girders ran between the support columns across the roadway, and was the location of the expansion joints. [...] Smaller longitudinal and transverse floorbeams formed a lattice structure between major girders to support the road deck. [...] The road deck {{consisted of}} reinforced concrete, on top of which the <b>paved</b> <b>surface</b> would sit. [...] Originally this was Belgian block, and was eventually substituted or paved over with asphalt as construction materials matured. [...] Drainage was provided at the expansion joints (on the older sections) or grated channels {{along the edge of the}} road (newest sections), with rainwater and snowmelt being plumbed to the street through scuppers and downspouts located at the main support columns. [...] It was not uncommon during the life of the highway that it would be supporting not only traffic, but 6 to 8 inches of standing water. [...] The high impermeable balustrades, the undersized scuppers, and the lack of drain cleaning / maintenance were all ingredients which contributed to the structure's demise.|$|E
50|$|Urban and {{suburban}} areas are a {{main sources of}} nonpoint source pollution due {{to the amount of}} runoff that is produced due to the large amount of <b>paved</b> <b>surfaces.</b> <b>Paved</b> <b>surfaces,</b> such as asphalt and concrete are impervious to water penetrating them.

50|$|Permeable <b>paving</b> <b>surfaces</b> {{have been}} {{demonstrated}} as effective in managing runoff from <b>paved</b> <b>surfaces.</b> Large volumes of urban runoff causes serious erosion and siltation in surface water bodies. Permeable pavers provide a solid ground surface, strong enough to take heavy loads, like large vehicles, {{while at the same}} time they allow water to filter through the surface and reach the underlying soils, mimicking natural ground absorption. They can reduce downstream flooding and stream bank erosion, and maintain base flows in rivers to keep ecosystems self-sustaining. Permeable pavers also combat erosion that occurs when grass is dry or dead, by replacing grassed areas in suburban and residential environments.|$|R

40|$|Urban fabric {{data are}} {{needed in order to}} {{estimate}} the impact of light-colored surfaces (roofs and pavements) and urban vegetation (trees, grass, shrubs) on the meteorology and air quality of a city, and to design effective implementation programs. In this report, we discuss the result of a semi-automatic Monte-Carlo statistical approach used to develop data on surface-type distribution and city-fabric makeup (percentage of various surface-types) using aerial color orthophotography. The digital aerial photographs for metropolitan Chicago covered a total of about 36 km 2 (14 mi 2). At 0. 3 m resolution, there were approximately 3. 9 x 108 pixels of data. Four major land-use types were examined: commercial, industrial, residential, and transportation/communication. On average, for the areas studied, at ground level vegetation covers about 29 percent of the area (ranging 4 80 percent); roofs cover about 25 percent (ranging 8 41 percent), and <b>paved</b> <b>surfaces</b> about 33 percent (ranging 12 59 percent). For the most part, trees shade streets, parking lots, grass, and side-walks. In commercial areas, <b>paved</b> <b>surfaces</b> cover 50 60 percent of the area. In residential areas, on average, <b>paved</b> <b>surfaces</b> cover about 27 percent of the area.
