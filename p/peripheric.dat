50|$|The {{thermal process}} in the vortex tube can be {{estimated}} in the following way: 1) The adiabatic expansion of the incoming gas, which cools the gas and turns its heat energy into the kinetic energy of rotation. The total enthalpy (which {{is the sum of}} the enthalpy and the kinetic energy), however, is being conserved. 2) The <b>peripheric</b> rotating gas flow moves towards the hot outlet. Here the heat recuperation effect takes place between the quickly rotating <b>peripheric</b> flow and the opposite slowly rotating axial flow. Here the heat transfers from axial flow to the <b>peripheric</b> one. 3) The kinetic energy of rotation turns into the heat energy by the means of the viscous dissipation. The temperature of the gas rises. As the total enthalpy has been increased during the heat recuperation process, this temperature is higher than the incoming gas. 4) Some of the hot gas leaves the hot outlet, carrying away the excess heat. 5) The rest of the gas turns towards the cold outlet. As it passes its way to the cold outlet, its heat energy is transferred to the <b>peripheric</b> flow. Although the temperature at the axis and at the periphery is about the same everywhere, the rotation is slower at the axis, so the total enthalpy is lower as well. 6) The low total enthalpy cooled gas from the axial flow leaves the cold outlet.|$|E

Aims: To determine and evaluate micronuclei (MN) frequencies of young smokers and nonsmokers in three different tissues (<b>peripheric</b> blood lymphoctes, buccal mucosa, and exfoliative urothelial cells) at the same time. Materials and Methods: MN assay was performed on buccal mucosa, urothelial cells, and <b>peripheric</b> blood lymphocyte samples obtained from 15 healthy male smokers (> 5 pack-years) and 15 healthy male nonsmoker controls who had not been exposed to any known genotoxic agent. Statistical Analysis Used: The statistical differences between smoker and nonsmoker groups were calculated by using student t test. The differences between smoker-group tissues were compared by ANOVA. Results: It was found that MN frequency (mean value ± standard deviation) in oral mucosa cells from smokers and controls were 1. 20 ± 0. 22 % and 0. 26 ± 0. 10 %; in urothelial exfoliative cells, 1. 29 ± 0. 28 % and 0. 12 ± 0. 08 %; in <b>peripheric</b> blood lymphocytes, 1. 53 ± 0. 23 % and 0. 38 ± 0. 12 %, respectively.
