40|$|WOS: 000232764400010 International audienceThe European quail is a <b>partial</b> <b>migrant</b> <b>bird</b> {{considered}} 'vulnerable' by the European community. The {{decline of}} this subspecies has spurred an annual release {{of large numbers}} of domestic Japanese quail. Prezygotic and postzygotic isolating mechanisms have not been established between these two subspecies, enhancing the risk of hybridization. In addition, anecdotal reports suggest that hybridization is commonly practiced in game farms of domestic quails. In this article, we present the results of behavioural characterization of the quails produced by two European game farms: one French and one Italian. First, we looked for evidences of hybridization in both game farms. Using actographic methods, we measured migratory tendency. Birds, hatched in summer, were submitted in autumn to an artificial increase of daylength (LD 14 : 10) for 60 days. In quails, the length of the cloacal vent which is a good indicator of sexual development, was monitored every 10 days. We noted the appearance of cloacal foam in males and egg-laying activity in females. In addition, mating calls produced by the males when sexually mature were recorded and analyzed using spectrographic methods. Seventeen males o...|$|E
40|$|A central {{hypothesis}} of ecological immunology is that immune defences are traded off against competing physiological and behavioural processes. During energetically demanding periods, birds are predicted {{to switch from}} expensive inflammatory responses to less costly immune responses. Acute phase responses (APRs) are a particularly costly form of immune defence, and, hence, seasonal modulations in APRs are expected. Yet, hypotheses about APR modulation remain untested in freeliving organisms throughout a complete annual cycle. We studied seasonal modulations in the APRs and in the energy budgets of skylarks Alauda arvensis, a <b>partial</b> <b>migrant</b> <b>bird</b> from temperate zones that experiences substantial ecological changes during its annual cycle. We characterized throughout the annual cycle changes in their energy budgets by measuring basal metabolic rate (BMR) and body mass. We quantified APRs by measuring {{the effects of a}} lipopolysaccharide injection on metabolic rate, body mass, body temperature, and concentrations of glucose and ketone. Body mass and BMR were lowest during breeding, highest during winter and intermediate during spring migration, moult and autumn migration. Despite this variation in energy budgets, the magnitude of the APR, as measured by all variables, was similar in all annual cycle stages. Thus, while we find evidence that some annual cycle stages are relatively more energetically constrained, we find no support for the hypothesis that during these annual cycle stages birds compromise an immune defence that is itself energetically costly. We suggest that the ability to mount an APR may be so essential to survival i...|$|E
40|$|Trade-offs between immune {{function}} and other physiological and behavioural processes are central in ecoimmunology, but one important problem {{is how to}} distinguish a reallocation of resources away from the immune system from a reallocation or redistribution within the immune system. While variation in baseline values of individual immune parameters is well established, studies in wild animals on multiple parameters during an immune response are lacking. It also remains to be tested whether and how immune responses correlate with baseline values that vary, for example, {{over the course of}} an annual cycle. We studied immunological responses to an endotoxin challenge in skylarks (Alauda arvensis), a <b>partial</b> <b>migrant</b> <b>bird</b> breeding in temperate zones. We compared birds injected with the endotoxin LPS with un-injected controls, characterizing immunological responses with leukocyte profiles, titres of lytic enzymes and natural antibodies, and concentrations of haptoglobin and heat shock proteins. We did this in five annual-cycle stages to test whether the response varied throughout the year. The endotoxin challenge affected six of 10 measured parameters. Lysis titres and proportions of heterophils increased; haptoglobin concentrations and proportions of lymphocytes, basophils and eosinophils decreased. The variable effects on different immune components demonstrate the complexity of an immune response. We found no evidence that the response differed between annual-cycle stages. The response was independent of baseline measures taken directly upon capture in the field, indicating that birds were facing no immunological ceiling when mounting an immune response. Values of five parameters collected under field conditions were significantly related to values taken under standardized laboratory conditions. We conclude that multiple parts of the immune system are modulated during an immunological response and that responses are not re-organized throughout the annual cycle. ...|$|E
50|$|It is a <b>partial</b> <b>migrant.</b> <b>Birds</b> {{leave the}} United States, except Florida, to winter south in Brazil. Some Mexican birds leave in winter for Peru. Furthermore, a small {{resident}} population is known from Brazil, it being named {{as a new}} subspecies, brasiliensis, in 2008. In 2012 it was established {{that this is a}} junior synonym, and the correct name for the subspecies is crassirostris. This also means that one of the subspecies of the greater sand plover had to be renamed.|$|R
5000|$|Over most of {{its range}} the species is , but there is {{evidence}} that the most northerly populations are <b>partial</b> <b>migrants.</b> <b>Birds</b> in Arizona, New Mexico, and Mexico apparently move away from their breeding grounds, although what exact movements are made is unclear. It has been suggested that they are either [...] "down slope migrants", moving to lower elevations, or dispersive, as some records show their presence in Texas. Birds attributed to the northern race P. t. arizonae have been recorded near Tepic, in Nayarit. Nevertheless, some birds remain in the northern areas of their range year round.|$|R
50|$|The eared nightjars {{are found}} from China through Southeast Asia to Australia.

50|$|The {{species is}} a <b>partial</b> <b>migrant,</b> with <b>birds</b> {{moving away from}} areas where rivers and major lakes freeze in the winter, but {{resident}} where waters remain open. Eastern North American birds move south in small groups to the United States wherever ice free conditions exist on lakes and rivers; on the milder Pacific coast, they are permanent residents. Scandinavian and Russian birds also migrate southwards, but western European birds, and a few in Japan, are largely resident. In some populations, the males also show distinct moult migration, leaving the breeding areas {{as soon as the}} young hatch to spend the summer (June to September) elsewhere. Notably, most of the western European male population migrates north to estuaries in Finnmark in northern Norway (principally Tanafjord) to moult, leaving the females to care for the ducklings. Much smaller numbers of males also use estuaries in eastern Scotland as a moulting area.|$|R
5|$|T. p. clarkei, {{described}} by German zoologist Ernst Hartert in 1909, and named for William Eagle Clarke, breeds {{in the rest}} of Great Britain and Ireland and on mainland Europe in France, Belgium, the Netherlands and possibly somewhat further east. It has brown upperparts which are warmer in tone than those of the nominate form, an olive-tinged rump and rich yellow background colour to the underparts. It is a <b>partial</b> <b>migrant</b> with some <b>birds</b> wintering in southern France and Iberia. This form intergrades with the nominate subspecies in central Europe, and with T. p. hebridensis in the Inner Hebrides and western Scotland, and in these areas birds show intermediate characteristics. Additional subspecies, such as T. p. nataliae of Siberia, proposed by the Russian Sergei Buturlin in 1929, are not widely accepted.|$|R
50|$|The {{brown thrasher}} is a strong, but <b>partial</b> <b>migrant,</b> as the <b>bird</b> {{is a year}} round {{resident}} in the southern portion of its range. The breeding range includes the United States and Canada east of the Rocky Mountains, but has been occasionally spotted West of the Rockies. The increase in trees throughout the Great Plains during the past century due to fire suppression and tree planting facilitated a westward range expansion of the brown thrasher as well as range expansions of many other species of birds. Studies indicate that thrashers that reside in the New England region of the United States during the breeding season fly toward the Carolinas and Georgia, birds located in {{the east of the}} Mississippi winter from Arkansas to Georgia, and birds located in the Dakotas and the central Canadian provinces head towards eastern Texas and Louisiana. When the species does migrate, it is typically for short distances and during the night. There are also records of the bird wintering in Mexico, as well as a British record of a transatlantic vagrant.|$|R
