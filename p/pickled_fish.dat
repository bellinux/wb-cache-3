6000|$|Early {{the next}} morning I walked into a fish-house near our hotel, where three or four men were engaged in trundling out the <b>pickled</b> <b>fish</b> on barrows, and {{spreading}} them to dry. They told me that a vessel had lately {{come in from the}} Banks with forty-four thousand codfish. Timothy Dwight says that, just before he arrived at Provincetown, [...] "a schooner come in from the Great Bank with fifty-six thousand fish, almost one thousand five hundred quintals, taken in a single voyage; the main deck being, on her return, eight inches under water in calm weather." [...] The cod in this fish-house, just out of the pickle, lay packed several feet deep, and three or four men stood on them in cowhide boots, pitching them on to the barrows with an instrument which had a single iron point. One young man, who chewed tobacco, spat on the fish repeatedly. Well, sir, thought I, when that older man sees you he will speak to you. But presently I saw the older man do the same thing. It reminded me of the figs of Smyrna. [...] "How long does it take to cure these fish? I asked.|$|E
60|$|To {{the theatre}} we went, {{through the mud}} and much rain. Internally it was nearly dark, for the deep blue of the audience's dress soaked up the scanty light of the {{kerosene}} lamps. There was no standing room anywhere except next to the Japanese policeman, who {{in the cause of}} morals and the Lord Chamberlain had a corner in the gallery and four chairs all to himself. He was quite four feet eight inches high, and Napoleon at St. Helena could not have folded his arms more dramatically. After some grunting--I fear we were upsetting the principles of the Constitution--he consented to give us one chair, receiving in return a Burma cheroot which I have every reason to believe blew his little head off. A pit containing fifty rows of fifty people and a bonding layer of babies, with a gallery which might have held twelve hundred, made up the house. The building was as delicate a piece of cabinet work as any of the houses; roof, floor, beams, props, verandahs, and partitions were of naked wood, and every other person in the house was smoking a tiny pipe and knocking out the ashes every two minutes. Then I wished to fly; death by the auto da fe not being anywhere paid for in the tour; but there was no escape by the one little door where <b>pickled</b> <b>fish</b> was being sold between the acts.|$|E
