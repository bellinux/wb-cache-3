500|$|After {{years of}} touring and {{struggling}} to make money, Cagney and Vernon moved to Hawthorne, California, in 1924, partly for Cagney to meet his new mother-in-law, who had just moved there from Chicago, and partly to investigate breaking into the movies. Their train fares were paid for by a friend, the press officer of <b>Pitter</b> Patter, who was also desperate to act. They were not successful at first; the dance studio Cagney set up had few clients and folded, and Vernon [...] and he toured the studios, but garnered no interest.

500|$|Cagney secured {{his first}} {{significant}} nondancing role in 1925. He played a young tough {{guy in the}} three-act play Outside Looking In by Maxwell Anderson, earning $200 a week. As with <b>Pitter</b> Patter, Cagney went to the audition with little confidence he would get the part. He had no experience with drama at this point. Cagney felt that he only got the role because his hair was redder than that of Alan Bunce, the only other red-headed performer in New York. Both the play and Cagney received good reviews; Life magazine wrote, [...] "Mr. Cagney, in a less spectacular role [...] makes a few minutes silence during his mock-trial scene something that many a more established actor might watch with profit." [...] Burns Mantle wrote that it [...] "...contained the most honest acting now {{to be seen in}} New York." ...|$|E

[...] In deference to his mother's worries, he got employment as a brokerage house runner. This did not stop him looking for more stage work, however, {{and he went on}} to successfully audition for a chorus part in the William B. Friedlander musical <b>Pitter</b> Patter, for which he earned $55 a week—he sent $40 to his mother each week. So strong was his habit of holding down more than one job at a time, he also worked as a dresser for one of the leads, portered the casts' luggage, and understudied for the lead.

50|$|In the 1990s, {{during the}} rule of Hassan II of Morocco, the Moroccan wine {{production}} started to improve due to foreign (primarily French) investment and know-how.

Several large Bordeaux-based wine companies, including Groupe Castel, William <b>Pitters</b> and Taillan, entered into such partnerships, which have been quite successful in reviving the Moroccan wine industry. As an example, the Castel brand Boulaouane was the best-selling foreign wine in France as of 2005, and the vineyard area had expanded to 50000 ha in the early 2000s.

40|$|Background: In South Africa, limited {{research}} has focused on the task demands and workers responses associated with forestry silviculture work, particularly pitting and planting. The methods currently in use are manual, but despite our lack of understanding of the existing demands, advances in forestry engineering have resulted in an introduction of semi-mechanised versions of these tasks. This project aimed to compare the task demands of silviculture tasks using the current manual techniques and the more modern, semi-mechanised techniques. Methods: A holistic investigation focused on the worker characteristics of a sample of black male <b>pitters</b> and black female planters from the Kwa-Zulu Natal forestry industry, as well as biomechanical (spinal kinematics and L 5 /S 1 forces), physiological (heart rate, oxygen consumption and energy expenditure) and psychophysical (ratings of perceived exertion and body discomfort) responses associated with manual and semi-mechanised pitting and planting. Results: The pitting task saw significant improvements in the spinal kinematic measures {{as a result of the}} increased mechanisation, with eight of the 16 recorded variables decreasing to a lower level of risk classification. Physiologically, the manual task was associated with a mean heart rate of 157 bt. min⁻¹ and absolute energy expenditure of 11. 27 kcal. min⁻¹, which were not found to be significantly different to the values of 143 bt. min⁻¹ and 9. 8 kcal. min⁻¹ recorded during the semi-mechanised technique. Psychophysical responses indicated that the workers perceived manual pitting to be more physically demanding than the semi-mechanised method. The manual and semi-mechanised planting tasks were, in general, found to be acceptable from a spinal kinematics perspective, with the majority of variables classified as low risk. However, the maximum sagittal angle was reduced by more than 20 degrees as a result of the new equipment. The physiological and psychophysical demands associated with manual planting were found to be within acceptable limits. Conclusion: In terms of pitting, it can tentatively be concluded that the semi-mechanised technique is better than the manual one, based on the biomechanical and psychophysical findings, however physiological demands require further investigation. When considering the planting techniques, the semi-mechanised method showed a slight improvement from the biomechanical perspective, but further physiological and psychophysical investigations are needed...|$|R

40|$|A case of osseous treponemal {{disease of}} the {{shoulder}} : anatomical and radiological aspects of a fragmentary french skeleton (XVI™-XVIII™ century ad) Summary. — The aetiological diagnosis of osseous infection disease on only some bones is usually restrictive However, we have been particularly astonished at seeing resemblance, at once topographic and macroscopic, of the lesions seen on the bones of a left shoulder (clavicula, scapula and humérus), sole evidence of a slender adult skeleton buried between the XVIth and XVIII" 1 century m the St. Jean Baptiste church of Vmz-Fa verges, in Haute-Savoie (France), and the lesions observed on a complete adult skeleton buried {{during the same period}} (XVIIth c.) in Nyárlónnc (Hungary), and carrier of typical treponemal disease. The volume of the clavicula is uniformly increased by a penostitic hyperostosis, with a smooth porotic surface, eroded in places by a osteolytic process (medial anterior face), and with a corrugated aspect on the inferior face (borderline with the posterior face, uninjured on its medial surface). Radiographs show a mixed texture in the hyperostosis, with a dominant rarefaction on the anterior face, and a lamellar aspect on the posterior apposition The scapula shows mixed lesions of a slight penostotic hyperostosis associated with important osteolytic lesions of the spine (microgeodic holes and destruction of the tuberculum trapezium, thinning of acromial extremity and medial angle); a thin periostotic hyperostosis "coating" the supraspinatus fossa (corrugated aspect), the step of the spine in the infraspinatus fossa, the medial margin and the crest of the subscapular/owa; the posterior edge of the glenoid/ossa is eroded by a lytic lesion, edged on its anterior limit with a mamillated hyperostosis of the articular surface. The proximal metaphysis of the humérus presents several milhmetric perforations of the lateral face, surrounded with fluted thin penostitic hyperostosis, making a limited blister of cortical bone (illustrated by increased opacity on radiographs); the distal metaphysis and epiphysis presents lytic predominant lesions with résorption of the posterolateral face and the lateral epicondyle, and <b>pittered</b> penostitic hyperostosis on medial and lateral supracondylar crests, medial and lateral condyles, without respect of coronoid and olecranon/ошге; the articular surfaces are normal. The association, on cortical and trabecular bone altering, of a macroscopic fluted penostitic hyperostosis, and a radiographie lamellar aspect, with radiotransparent areas, is highly suggestive of treponemal osteoperiostitis (clavicula notably); juxtaposed geods and perforations rounded with dense edging and cortical-periostitic thickening are very suggestive of gummatous osteitis (humérus). We conclude that these three bones were affected by treponemal disease (probably tertiary or late congenital syphilis), and that there exists a topographic uniformity of treponemal lesions on the shoulder, the comparison with the Hungarian and recent palaeopathologic case reports permitting to specify the macroscopic aspects of the injury. Résumé. — II est souvent difficile de faire le diagnostic précis d'atteinte osseuse d'origine infectieuse sur un squelette fragmentaire. Cependant, nous avons été particulièrement étonné de constater la similitude à la fois topographique et macroscopique des lésions observées sur une clavicule, un scapulum et un humérus gauches d'un individu adulte provenant de l'église St Jean- Baptiste de Viuz Faverges près d'Albertville (Haute-Savoie, France), inhumé entre les XVIe et XVIIIe siècles, et les lésions observées sur le squelette de l'épaule d'un adulte de la nécropole hongroise de Nyárlónnc, inhumé au XVIIe siècle et porteur d'une atteinte tréponémateuse caractéristique de syphilis tertiaire acquise, ou congénitale tardive. L'analogie morphologique des lésions de ces deux cas ainsi que les données de la littérature paléopathologique récente, ont permis de conclure à l'unité topographique des lésions syphilitiques de l'épaule osseuse, et de préciser certaines caractéristiques macroscopiques, notamment au niveau du scapulum.
