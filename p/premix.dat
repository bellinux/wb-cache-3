40|$|The {{aerodynamics}} {{caused by}} the PVC are highly complex and understanding the three dimensional phenomenon it is therefore of paramount importance. The information gained from the novel PIV system contributed substantially {{to the understanding of}} the complex flow pattern associated with the PVC. Secondary vortices have been identified reacting as closed loop feedback system to recycle and burn active combustion species. They also provides re-ignition for those combustion species and hence aids the overall flame stabilisation. The 100 kW model swirl burner/furnace system was used to carry out measurements under rich operation conditions due to safety consideration of the exhaust system of the full scale rig. The CO emissions under piloted <b>premixed</b> conditions in this case were substantially lower than under non <b>premixed</b> conditions. Under <b>premixed</b> conditions the CO emissions were extraordinary low when compared to non <b>premixed</b> conditions. The NOx emissions confirm the advantages of piloted <b>premixed</b> or <b>premixed</b> operation conditions. NOx were 30 % lower in case of piloted <b>premixed</b> and 60 % lower in case of <b>premixed</b> operation conditions. The higher exhaust gas temperatures under non <b>premixed</b> and piloted <b>premixed</b> operation conditions compared to the <b>premixed</b> case were reflected in the NOx emissions. Intense turbulence {{caused by the}} PVC reduced the formation of thermal NOx. Lower outlet temperatures and lower CO emissions at the same power indicate higher e ciency due to <b>premixed</b> combustion conditions and subsequently utilising the PVC and its associated phenomena. Investigations on the industrial scaled 2 MW swirl burner/furnace system were only carried out under lean operation conditions. Non <b>premixed</b> and piloted <b>premixed</b> fuel entry modes were compared. Under non <b>premixed</b> conditions a long flame extending down to the furnace exit occurred. Piloted <b>premixed</b> conditions required an axial pilot flame to ensure flame stability for fuel simulated calorific values less than 1. 5 MJ/m 3. All the results clearly show that operating swirl burner/furnace systems under piloted <b>premixed</b> or <b>premixed</b> (where possible due to flame stability limits) conditions has clear advantages over the axial fuel entry mode. The resulting short and intense flame provides more e cient combustion and wider flame stability limits (under very lean operation conditions) ...|$|R

40|$|The {{stabilization}} {{mechanism of}} lifted turbulent jet diffusion flames {{is a test}} problem for models of partially <b>premixed</b> turbulent combustion. In these flames, combustion processes occur in both the non-premixed and the <b>premixed</b> mode. For the flame stabilization process, however, flame propagation of the <b>premixed</b> branches seems to play a crucial role. In this paper, a flamelet model for partially <b>premixed</b> turbulent combustion is presented that combines flamelet models for non-premixed and <b>premixed</b> com-bustion. A new model for the turbulent burning velocity in partially <b>premixed</b> flows is proposed. It {{is based on a}} formulation for a conditional turbulent burning velocity which depends on mixture fraction. The effect of partially <b>premixing</b> is taken into account by using the presumed probability density function (pdf) approach in terms of the mixture fraction. Mean scalar quantities {{on both sides of the}} <b>premixed</b> flame front are calculated in the same way. From a computational point of view, the model has the advantage that the calculation of the chemical processes can be decoupled from the flow calculation, allowing for simulations of realistic configurations, yet retaining detailed chemistry. The model is used to simulate the stabilization process of turbulent methane/air and propane/air jet diffusion flames.

Therefore, only some of anthelminthics that are efficient in domestic ruminants have been tested in wild ruminants infected with F. magna. Several drugs, namely oxyclozanide, rafoxanide, albendazole, diamphenetide, closantel, clorsulon, and triclabendazole, {{have been used in}} control of F. magna infection in cervids. However, the results have differed between different authors. In the same way as for F. hepatica, triclabendazole seems to be the most effective against F. magna.

40|$|Turbulent {{partially}} <b>premixed</b> flames {{are found}} in common combustion applications, such as the lifted jet flames in diesel engines. There is less theory surrounding the structure and propagation of turbulent partially <b>premixed</b> flames than for classical <b>premixed</b> flames and diffusion flames, {{especially in regards to}} modelling. This thesis presents direct numerical simulations (DNS) and analysis of the structures and propagation of turbulent partially <b>premixed</b> flames. The aim is to collect detailed information on turbulent partially <b>premixed</b> flames and to provide insight for the development of models for turbulent partially <b>premixed</b> flames. The fuels considered are methane and hydrogen, with unity Lewis number and Lewis number less than one, respectively. A detailed chemical kinetic mechanism and mixture averaged transport properties were used in the DNS. The computations were carried out at room temperature and atmospheric pressure in a rectangular domain of size of 20 mm, 10 mm and 10 mm in the streamwise and cross flow directions respectively. Isotropic turbulence was imposed at the inflow boundary and the inflow velocity was selected such that the flame was stabilized in the domain during the time span of the simulation. The two simulated flames have similar turbulence conditions. The Karlovitz number of the methane/air flame is about 50 at the triple-point of the flame, and for the hydrogen/air it is about 5. The DNS was carried out using a high order finite difference code. Both the turbulent methane/air and hydrogen/air partially <b>premixed</b> flames consist of a main <b>premixed</b> flame front trailed by two thin lean <b>premixed</b> flames at the edges and a diffusion flame following the stoichiometry line. The lean <b>premixed</b> flames can be sustained at much lower equivalence ratio than the corresponding planar unstretched laminar <b>premixed</b> flames. The leading front has a w-shaped structure, with weak reactions distributed on the burned side of the <b>premixed</b> flame. Turbulent eddies wrinkle the flames in both cases and broaden the preheat zone. The hydrogen flame is wrinkled at smaller scales than the methane flame, despite having very similar turbulence. The lean trail and the diffusion flame both have a heat release rate roughly two orders of magnitude lower than that of the <b>premixed</b> front. The propagation of turbulent partially <b>premixed</b> flames are shown to be highly sensitive to local equivalence ratio, curvature and strain rate of the flame, and local turbulent motion. The triple flame enhances the displacement speed of stoichiometric mixture of hydrogen due to the interaction between the diffusion flame and <b>premixed</b> flames. The effect of turbulent eddies is shown to highly disturb the flame structures and local displacement speed, which poses a great challenge to the development of cost-effective CFD models for turbulent partially <b>premixed</b> flames under high Karlovitz numbers...|$|R

40|$|Formation of NOx in {{counterflow}} methane/air triple flames at {{atmospheric pressure}} was investigated by numerical simulation. Detailed chemistry and complex thermal and transport properties were employed. Results indicate {{that in a}} triple flame, {{the appearance of the}} diffusion flame branch and the interaction between the diffusion flame branch and the <b>premixed</b> flame branches can significantly affect the formation of NOx, compared to the corresponding <b>premixed</b> flames. A triple flame produces more NO and NO 2 than the corresponding <b>premixed</b> flames due to the appearance of the diffusion flame branch where NO is mainly produced by the thermal mechanism. The contribution of the N 2 O intermediate route to the total NO production in a triple flame is much smaller than those of the thermal and prompt routes. The variation in the equivalence ratio of the lean or rich <b>premixed</b> mixture affects the amount of NO formation in a triple flame. The interaction between the diffusion and the <b>premixed</b> flame branches causes the NO and NO 2 formation in a triple flame to be higher than in the corresponding <b>premixed</b> flames, not only in the diffusion flame branch region but also in the <b>premixed</b> flame branch regions.

The ame is computed using a detailed reaction mechanism consisting of 275 elementary reactions and 41 species. The mechanism is validated by comparing its predictions with measurements for both the <b>premixed</b> and nonpremixed ames. The partially <b>premixed</b> ame structure is characterized by two-stage burning or two spatially distinct, but synergistically coupled, reaction zones, namely, a rich <b>premixed</b> zone on the fuel side and a nonpremixed zone on the air side. Two major pathways characterize the n-heptane/air chemistry in these two reaction zones. The fuel is completely consumed in the <b>premixed</b> reaction zone, with ethy-lene and acetylene being the major intermediate species. Interactions between the two zones involve the transport of heat from the nonpremixed to the <b>premixed</b> reaction zone and the transport of CO, H 2, and C 2 H 2 from the <b>premixed</b> to the nonpremixed reaction zone. The ame response to variations in equivalence ratio and strain rate is characterized. Increasing the equivalence ratio and/or strain rate to a critical value leads to merging of the two reaction zones.
