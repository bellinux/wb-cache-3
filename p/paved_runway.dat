25|$|With the German {{invasion}} {{starting on}} 9 April 1940, the Luftwaffe had initially {{intended to use}} Værnes Air Station as its main stronghold for operating aircraft of the 10th Air Corps in Trøndelag.

25|$|The {{field was}} {{dramatically}} enlarged (and the shoreline of the Potomac River altered) in April 1928. Safety improvements were also made.
