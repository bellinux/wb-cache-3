50|$|In 1884 Montgomery {{received}} a <b>patent</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>process</b> to vulcanize and de-vulcanize India rubber. In 1895 {{and again in}} the period 1901 to 1904, Montgomery occasionally supplemented his aeronautical research with work in other branches of science, including electricity, communication, astronomy and mining. In 1895 he received four patents (American, German, British, and Canadian) for improvements in the efficiency of petroleum burning furnaces. In 1897 he took a teaching position at Santa Clara College and directed study of wireless telegraphy with Father Richard Bell. They were first to successfully transmit messages from Santa Clara College to San Francisco. Montgomery also patented two gold concentrator devices to assist miners in extracting gold from beach sands (see patent list).|$|E
50|$|In the Report of the British Association for 1835 he was {{the first}} to publish a series of {{experiments}} investigating the protective power of zinc employed in simple contact and in massive form. Shortly thereafter a French engineer, M. Sorel, secured a <b>patent</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>process</b> of coating an iron surface with fluid zinc to protect against rust, and the technique was adopted by manufacturers of galvanized iron. Davy claimed priority of discovery, but it was found that a patent had long before been issued, on 26 September 1791 to Madame Leroi de Jancourt for the protection of metals with a coating of an alloy of zinc, bismuth and tin (though without a knowledge of the chemical principles involved).|$|E

5000|$|The relief here sought is {{indistinguishable from}} that denied in the Motion Picture Case. There, {{it was held}} that to permit the patent owner to [...] "derive its profit not from the {{invention}} on which the law gives it a monopoly, but from the unpatented supplies with which it is used" [...] is [...] "wholly without {{the scope of the}} patent monopoly." [...] If a monopoly could be so expanded, the owner of a patent for a product might conceivably monopolize the commerce in a large part of unpatented materials used in its manufacture. The owner of a patent for a machine might thereby secure a partial monopoly on the unpatented supplies consumed in its operation. The owner of a <b>patent</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>process</b> might secure a partial monopoly on the unpatented material employed in it.|$|E
5000|$|Pangamic acid is {{the name}} given to the {{chemical}} compound with the empirical formula C10H19O8N and a molecular weight of 281 which {{appeared to be an}} ester derived from d-gluconic acid and dimethylglycine. In 1943, the Krebses applied for a <b>patent</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>process</b> for extracting this chemical compound which they reported had been previously isolated from apricot seeds, and received the patent in 1949. A 1951 paper by the Krebses reported the first isolation of this compound using this patented process, but did not include enough information to confirm that this compound was actually isolated. In 1955, the Krebses received a patent for another synthesizing process for [...] "N-substituted glycine esters of gluconic acid," [...] but the patent contained no supporting data to confirm the process was able to synthesize compounds described by the patent, including pangamic acid.|$|E
5000|$|With the {{introduction}} of iron ships, the negative effect of the metal hull on steering compasses was noted. It was also observed that lightning strikes {{had a significant effect}} on compass deviation, identified in some extreme cases as being caused by the reversal of the ship's magnetic signature. In 1866, Evan Hopkins of London registered a <b>patent</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>process</b> [...] "to depolarise iron vessels and leave them thenceforth free from any compass-disturbing influence whatever". The technique was described as follows: [...] "For this purpose he employed a number of Grove's batteries and electromagnets. The latter were to be passed along the plates till the desired end had been obtained... the process must not be overdone for fear of re-polarising in the opposite direction." [...] The invention was, however, reported to be [...] "incapable of being carried to a successful issue", and [...] "quickly died a natural death".|$|E

25|$|The key patents {{having to}} do with natural gas {{liquefaction}} were in 1915 and the mid-1930s. In 1915 Godfrey Cabot <b>patented</b> <b>a</b> method <b>for</b> storing liquid gases at very low temperatures. It consisted of a Thermos bottle type design which included a cold inner tank within an outer tank; the tanks being separated by insulation. In 1937 Lee Twomey received <b>patents</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>process</b> <b>for</b> large scale liquefaction of natural gas. The intention was to store natural gas as a liquid so it could be used for shaving peak energy loads during cold snaps. Because of large volumes it is not practical to store natural gas, as a gas, near atmospheric pressure. However, if it can be liquefied it can be stored in a volume 600 times smaller. This is a practical way to store it but the gas must be stored at −260°F (−162°C).|$|R

They divided the market in half: Perkin sold to the English market, and the scientists from Berlin to the United States and mainland Europe.|$|R
5000|$|The United States Patent and Trademark Office {{has granted}} patents {{that may be}} {{referred}} to as software patents since at least the early 1970s. In Gottschalk v. Benson (1972), the United States Supreme Court ruled that a <b>patent</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>process</b> should not be allowed if it would [...] "wholly pre-empt the mathematical formula and in practical effect would be a patent on the algorithm itself", adding that [...] "it is said that the decision precludes a patent for any program servicing a computer. We do not so hold." [...] In 1981, the Supreme Court stated that [...] "a claim drawn to subject matter otherwise statutory does not become nonstatutory simply because it uses a mathematical formula, computer program, or digital computer" [...] and a claim is patentable if it contains [...] "a mathematical formula and implements or applies the formula in a structure or process which, when considered as a whole, is performing a function which the patent laws were designed to protect".|$|E
50|$|Kshitish Ranjan Chakravorty (born 1916) was an Indian engineer, {{fertilizer}} {{scientist and}} the head of the Planning and Development Division of the Fertilizer Corporation of India (FCI). He was credited with the establishment of Planning and Development Division of FCI and with the development indigenous fertilizer plants in India. Born on 1 February 1916, Chakravorty was the author of two books, Science Based on Symmetry, Volume 1 and Energy Field of the Universe and Atom, Part 1 and he held the <b>patent</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>process</b> on an ionexchange material from the acid sludge. He sat in the Committee on Tachnical Consultancy Services of the Government of India and was an Indian member of the Indo-US Workshop on the Management of Organization of Industrial Research held in 1970.

5000|$|The oldest known living {{examples}} of woody plant shaping are the aeroponically cultured living root bridges {{built by the}} ancient War-Khasi people of the Cherrapunjee region in India. These are being maintained and further developed today {{by the people of}} that region. Aeroponic growing was first formally studied by W. Carter in 1942. Carter researched air culture growing and described [...] "a method of growing plants in water vapor to facilitate examination of roots". Later researchers, including L. J Klotz and G. G. Trowel, expanded on his work. In 1957, F. W. Went described [...] "the process of growing plants with air-suspended roots and applying a nutrient mist to the root section", and in it he coined the word 'aeroponics' to describe that process. In 2008, root researcher and craftsman Ezekiel Golan described and secured a <b>patent</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>process</b> which allows the roots of some aeroponically grown woody plants to lengthen and thicken while still remaining flexible. At lengths of perhaps 6 m or more, the soft roots can be formed into pre-determined shapes which will continue thickening after the shapes are formed and as they continue to grow.Newer techniques and applications, such as eco-architecture, may allow architects to design, grow, and form large permanent structures, such as homes, by shaping aeroponically grown plants and their roots.|$|E

50|$|Joseph Fry, a Quaker, {{was born}} in 1728. He started making {{chocolate}} around 1759. In 1761 Joseph Fry and John Vaughan purchased a small shop from an apothecary, Walter Churchman, {{and with it the}} <b>patent</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> chocolate refining <b>process.</b> The company was then named Fry, Vaughan & Co.. In 1777 their chocolate works moved from Newgate Street to Union Street, Bristol. Joseph Fry died in 1787 and the company was renamed Anna Fry & Son. In 1795 Joseph Storrs Fry assumed control of the company. He patented a method of grinding cocoa beans using a Watt steam engine. As a result, factory techniques were introduced into the cocoa business. In 1803 Anna Fry died and Joseph Storrs Fry partnered with a Dr. Hunt. The business was renamed Fry & Hunt. In 1822 Hunt retired and Joseph Storrs Fry took on his sons Joseph, Francis and Richard as partners: the firm was renamed J. S. Fry & Sons. The company became the largest commercial producer of chocolate in Britain. In 1835 Joseph Storrs Fry died and his sons took full control.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Much of {{the hype}} around {{nanotechnology}} {{relies on the}} notion that it is novel and revolutionary. A large part of that in turn relies on the purportedly revolu-tionary ability of the Scanning Tunneling Microscope to manipulate individual at-oms. However, novelty always involves a comparison of similarity and difference with what came before. Furthermore, the novelty of the STM was negotiated and re-negotiated from the very beginning – just as the nature of nanotechnology continues to be negotiated to this day. The history of the STM sheds light on the role of prom-ise and hype in science in general and directs our attention towards science in the public sphere. 1. The Etymology of Nano In our culture, the negotiation of novelty is commonplace. <b>Patenting,</b> <b>for</b> example, is <b>a</b> <b>process</b> to decide what counts as novel. Innovations are compared against predecessors and consequential decisions are {{made on the basis of}} similarity and difference. The same is true of the Nobel Prizes. One might even argue that all arguments can be recast as a negotiation of similarity and difference...|$|R
