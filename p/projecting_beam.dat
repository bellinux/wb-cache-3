A West African Adventure" [...] in Cassell's Saturday Journal, published in February 1891. In the article, a captain tells how he was dispatched to a remote camp in West Africa to stay in a tumbledown cabin that belonged to a Portuguese trader. [...] On the first night in the cabin, he is awoken by a creaking sound, and sees [...] "a dark queer-looking thing hanging down through the ventilator above it". It {{turns out to be the}} largest Boa constrictor he has seen (more likely a python because there are no boas in Africa). He is paralysed with fear as the serpent comes down into the room. Unable to cry out for help, the captain spots an old bell that hung from a <b>projecting</b> <b>beam</b> above one of the windows. The bell cord had rotted away, but by means of a stick he manages to ring it and raise the alarm.|$|E

He perceived at once that Sam had seen him; but the young man immediately averted his eyes and went on with his work. The parson did not speak at once, but stepped over the ruins around him till he came immediately under the beam in question. Then he called to the lad, and Sam was constrained to answer [...] "Yes, Mr. Fenwick, I am here;--hard at work, as you see." ...|$|E

40|$|The {{square of}} the {{horizontal}} <b>projected</b> (rms) <b>beam</b> emittance is expressed as the sum of four nonnegative contributions, each described using the slice moments of the beam and possessing a natural interpretation {{in terms of the}} geometrical properties of the beam in the six-dimensional phase space. The mathematical formalism describing the relationships between <b>projected</b> <b>beam</b> quantities and slice beam quantities is reviewed. The results may be used to reconstruct the moments and emittances of the beam from the moments of its subpopulations, as well as to isolate and better understand a variety of slice and interslice dynamical contributions to the <b>projected</b> <b>beam</b> emittance growth...|$|R
60|$|There was a mill, {{just where}} the stream {{that runs through}} our valley tumbles down to a level below that on which the farm lies, and empties itself into a small {{tributary}} of the Hudson. This mill was on our property, and {{was a source of}} great convenience and of some profit to my father. There he ground all the grain that was consumed for domestic purposes, for several miles around; and the tolls enabled him to fatten his porkers and beeves, in a way to give both a sort of established character. In a word, the mill was the concentrating point for all the products of the farm, there being a little landing on the margin of the creek that put up from the Hudson, whence a sloop sailed weekly for town. My father passed half his time about the mill and landing, superintending his workmen, and particularly giving directions about the fitting of the sloop, which was his property also, and about the gear of the mill. He was clever, certainly, and had made several useful suggestions to the millwright who occasionally came to examine and repair the works; but he was by no means so accurate a mechanic as he fancied himself to be. He had invented some new mode of arresting the movement, and of setting the machinery in motion when necessary; what it was, I never knew, for it was not named at Clawbonny after the fatal accident occurred. One day, however, in order to convince the millwright of the excellence of this improvement, my father caused the machinery to be stopped, and then placed his own weight upon the large wheel, in order to manifest the sense he felt in the security of his invention. He was in the very act of laughing exultingly at {{the manner in which the}} millwright shook his head at the risk he ran, when the arresting power lost its control of the machinery, the heavy head of water burst into the buckets, and the wheel whirled round carrying my unfortunate father with it. I was an eye-witness of the whole, and saw the face of my parent, as the wheel turned it from me, still expanded in mirth. There was but one revolution made, when the wright succeeded in stopping the works. This brought the great wheel back nearly to its original position, and I fairly shouted with hysterical delight when I saw my father standing in his tracks, as it might be, seemingly unhurt. Unhurt he would have been, though he must have passed a fearful keel-hauling, but for one circumstance. He had held on to the wheel with the tenacity of a seaman, since letting go his hold would have thrown him down a cliff of near a hundred feet in depth, and he actually passed between the wheel and the planking beneath it unharmed, although there was only an inch or two to spare; but in rising from this fearful strait, his head had been driven between a <b>projecting</b> <b>beam</b> and one of the buckets, in a way to crush one temple in upon the brain. So swift and sudden had been the whole thing, that, on turning the wheel, his lifeless body was still inclining on its periphery, retained erect, I believe, in consequence of some part of his coat getting attached, to the head of a nail. This was the first serious sorrow of my life. I had always regarded my father as one of the fixtures of the world; as a part of the great system of the universe; and had never contemplated his death as a possible thing. That another revolution might occur, and carry the country back under the dominion of the British crown, would have seemed to me far more possible than that my father could die. Bitter truth now convinced me of the fallacy of such notions.|$|E

50|$|The {{back of the}} {{building}} was demolished and a new façade, made of steel and glass, was installed. The addition of the rooftop was designed to support a number of terraces and appendages; a <b>projecting</b> <b>beam</b> originally was to cantilever nearly five feet over the sidewalk and Rudolph proposed a rooftop swimming pool, but the DOB and BSA rejected those ideas. The first orders of construction were to reconstruct standing brick walls that had been deemed unsafe. After that, Rudolph’s famous penthouse was constructed, beginning in 1977-78, out of very light steel and concrete block panels. Almost all of the interior work for the rentable apartments was finished by the end of 1978, and all the necessary materials for the penthouse were lifted to the fifth floor. A new certificate of occupancy was issued in January 1992.|$|E

40|$|The LHC project, {{with its}} demand for small {{emittance}} beams and their monitoring, constitutes {{a challenge for}} the instruments of the CERN PS complex used hitherto to measure emittances of generally larger beams with less precision. Among these instruments, one (Beamscope) measures the betatron amplitude distribution, while the other two (SEM-grids, fast wire scanner) are recording the <b>projected</b> <b>beam</b> density. Emittances are quoted as derived from one standard width of the <b>projected</b> <b>beam</b> density, and {{the goal is to}} provide figures which refer to this definition regardless of the measurement instrument and method.

40|$|The {{quantitative}} analysis of beam radiation received on a solar concentrator may {{be understood by}} evaluating the projected solar height angle or profile angle along the north-south vertical plane. This means that all the sunrays projected along the north-south vertical plane will be intercepted by a collector provided the projection angle lies within the acceptance angle. The Meteonorm method of calculating solar radiation on any arbitrary oriented surface uses the globally simulated meteorological databases. Meteonorm has become a valuable too for estimating solar radiation where measured solar radiation data is missing or irregular. In this paper we present the <b>projected</b> <b>beam</b> solar radiation at low latitudes based on the standard Meteonorm calculations. The conclusion {{is that there is}} potential in using solar concentrators at these latitudes since the <b>projected</b> <b>beam</b> radiation is more during winter periods than in summer months. This conclusion is in conformity with the design principle of solar collectors for worst case conditions. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

50|$|A {{simple way}} to {{describe}} the physically complex Computron is {{to begin with a}} cathode ray tube structure {{in the form of a}} right-circular cylinder with a central vertical cathode structure. The cylinder is composed of 14 discrete planes, each plane having 14 individual radial outward <b>projecting</b> <b>beams.</b> Each of the 196 individual beams is steered by multiple deflection plates toward its two targets. Some deflection plates are connected to circuitry external to the Computron and are the data inputs. The balance of the plates are connected to internal targets and are the partial sums and products from other stages within the tube. Some of the targets are connected to circuitry outside the tube and represent the result.|$|R
