40|$|Near field {{goniophotometry}} is {{a recent}} promising measurement technique to determine the <b>photometric</b> characteristics of <b>light</b> <b>sources.</b> At the <b>Light</b> & Lighting Laboratory the recently installed goniophotometers {{will be used to}} determine luminous intensity distributions of a wide variety <b>light</b> <b>sources</b> of various dimensions. In this work results obtained with the near field goniophotometer are compared with photometric data obtained with a far field goniophotometer. The near field goniophotometers allow to obtain information about both the luminous flux and the luminous intensity of <b>light</b> <b>sources.</b> In this paper these parameters were investigated for a calibrated incandescent source and for a remote phosphor LED source. The luminous flux and luminous intensities as obtained from both lamps are comparable for both near and far field goniophotometers.

40|$|It is {{well known}} in the {{photometric}} stereo literature that uncalibrated <b>photometric</b> stereo, where <b>light</b> <b>source</b> strength and direction are unknown, can recover the surface geometry of a Lambertian object up to a 3 -parameter linear transform known as the generalized bas relief (GBR) ambiguity. Many techniques have been proposed for resolving the GBR ambiguity, typically by exploiting prior knowledge of the <b>light</b> <b>sources,</b> the object geometry, or non-Lambertian effects such as specularities. A less celebrated consequence of the GBR transformation is that the albedo at each surface point is transformed along with the geometry. Thus, {{it should be possible to}} resolve the GBR ambiguity by exploiting priors on the albedo distribution. To the best of our knowledge, the only time the albedo distribution has been used to resolve the GBR is in the case of uniform albedo. We propose a new prior on the albedo distribution: that the entropy of the distribution should be low. This prior is justified by the fact that many objects in the real-world are composed of a small finite set of albedo values. 1...|$|R
40|$|During {{photometric}} measurements involving {{the use of}} photometric lamps {{it is necessary that}} the filament of lamp takes a strictly predetermined position with respect to the photodetector and the optical axis of the photometric setup. The errors in positioning of alignment filament with respect to the optical axis of the measuring system lead to increase the uncertainty of measurement of the photometric characteristics of the <b>light</b> <b>sources.</b> A typical method for alignment of filament of photometric lamps is based on the use a diopter tubes (telescopes). Using this method, the mounting of filament to the required position is carried out by successive approximations, which requires special concentration and a lot of time. The aim of this work is to develop an apparatus for alignment which allows simultaneous alignment of the filament of lamps in two mutually perpendicular planes. The method and apparatus for alignment of the photometric lamp filament during measurements of the <b>photometric</b> characteristics of <b>light</b> <b>sources</b> based on two digital video cameras is described in this paper. The apparatus allows to simultaneously displaying the image of lamps filament on the computer screen in two mutually perpendicular planes. The apparatus eliminates a large number of functional units requiring elementwise alignment and reduces the time required to carry out the alignment. The apparatus also provides the imaging of lamps filament with opaque coated on the bulb. The apparatus is used at the National standard of light intensity and illuminance units of the Republic of Belarus.  </p...|$|R

The BEER algorithm identifies the BEaming periodic modulation, with a combination of the well known Ellipsoidal and Reflection/heating periodic effects, induced by short-period companions.
