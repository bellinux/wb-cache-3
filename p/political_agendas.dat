5|$|In the {{historical}} {{writing of the}} time, the humble devotion of the Decembrist women was contrasted with the intrigues and hedonism of female aristocrats of the 18thcentury, like Catherine the Great, whose excesses were seen as the danger of too-sudden liberation for women. Although they did not explicitly espouse a feminist agenda, the Decembrist women were used as an example by later generations of Russian feminists, whose concern for gender equality was also tied to revolutionary <b>political</b> <b>agendas.</b>|$|E
5|$|However, much of {{the blame}} for the decay and ruinous state of {{preservation}} of so many palazzi must fall not just on owners unwilling to accept change, but the <b>political</b> <b>agendas</b> of successive socialist governments. Some of the finest Baroque villas and palazzi, including the Palermo palace of the Prince of Lampedusa, are still in ruins following the United States bombing raids of 1943. In many cases, no attempt has been made to restore or even secure them. Those that survived the raids in good repair are often sub-divided into offices or apartments, their Baroque interiors dismantled, divided, and sold.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, Heathen organisations {{emerged in the}} United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, Australia, and Iceland, largely {{independently}} from each other. This has been partly attributed to the wider growth of the modern Pagan movement during the 1960s and 1970s, {{as well as the}} development of the New Age milieu, both of which encouraged the establishment of new religious movements intent on reviving pre-Christian belief systems. Further Heathen groups then emerged in the 1990s and 2000s, many of which distanced themselves from overtly <b>political</b> <b>agendas</b> and placed a stronger emphasis on historical authenticity than their 1960s and 1970s forebears.|$|E
50|$|The <b>political</b> <b>agenda</b> is tied {{to state}} {{centralization}} because the more centralized a state is, the more political elites have control over the <b>political</b> <b>agenda.</b> However if a state is too centralized, the more the public may feel they need they need to advocate to change the <b>political</b> <b>agenda</b> as well. The <b>Political</b> <b>Agenda</b> can be further broken down into two concepts: the <b>political</b> <b>agenda</b> effect, and the escalation effect.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Political</b> <b>agenda</b> is also {{strongly}} tied {{to state}} centralization. The more centralized a state, the more citizens will likely try and affect the <b>political</b> <b>agenda.</b> For this reason, many political elites tend to prefer a non-centralized state where they can maintain {{more control over the}} <b>political</b> <b>agenda.</b>|$|R

5|$|Weir had two {{significant}} advantages in {{his return to}} a civilian career. Firstly, he was repatriated well before most servicemen and, secondly, South Australia had implemented a policy of preferment of returned servicemen for government employment. These circumstances helped him gain appointment as the first South Australian Public Service Commissioner in 1916. Weir was not suited to this role, being unable to navigate the competing personal and <b>political</b> <b>agendas</b> of senior public servants and politicians, and was soon sidelined. In 1925, legislative changes {{made it possible for}} the government to replace Weir, and this took place in 1930. In the last year-and-a-half before his retirement in 1931, Weir was the chairman of both the Central Board of Health and the Public Relief Board, excelling at the latter.|$|E

25|$|Even among Hui Salafis (Sailaifengye) and Uyghur Salafis, {{there is}} little {{coordination}} or cooperation and the two take totally different <b>political</b> <b>agendas,</b> with the Hui Salafists content {{to carry out their}} own teachings and remain politically neutral.|$|E
50|$|Private sector lobbyists {{affect the}} <b>political</b> <b>agenda</b> by {{influencing}} the decisions and ideas of political leaders. When large-scale private corporations {{have a vested}} influence in a policy area, they can use their money and power to try to either keep or eliminate an issue from the <b>political</b> <b>agenda.</b> For example, private food lobbyist spent $101 Million in 2015 to fight against GMO Labeling and its prevalence on the <b>political</b> <b>agenda.</b>|$|R

5000|$|The impact {{agenda is}} the {{increasing}} requirements for researchers to prove that there are real world impacts from their research.

[...] When it comes to building the <b>political</b> <b>agenda,</b> there are three main models which are commonly cited: the outside initiative model, mobilization model, and inside initiative model.|$|R

25|$|Whether Europeans {{committed}} genocide {{against the}} Native peoples {{has been a}} controversial topic.

25|$|A lack of {{accurate}} data {{makes it}} difficult to document numerically the extent of the human losses suffered by Polish citizens during World War II. Additionally, many assertions made in the past must be considered suspect due to flawed methodology and a desire to promote certain <b>political</b> <b>agendas.</b> The last available enumeration of ethnic Poles and the large ethnic minorities is the Polish census of 1931. Exact population figures for 1939 are therefore not known.|$|E

40|$|In recent years, {{political}} satire {{has risen in popularity}} and recognition {{as an effective}} means of transmitting political news to a younger generation of voters. This recent development brings forth new questions about the role of {{political satire}} in setting the public 2 ̆ 7 s <b>political</b> <b>agenda.</b> Using Agenda-Setting Theory as a framework, this study takes The Colbert Report, {{one of the most popular}} satire television shows of this generation, and analyzes it for a possible <b>political</b> <b>agenda.</b> In the end, what this study finds is that in the six weeks leading up to the 2008 U. S. presidential election The Colbert Report chose to significantly and primarily focus on the issue of economics, therefore setting a <b>political</b> <b>agenda</b> to its audiences. The effects of this <b>political</b> <b>agenda</b> are yet to be measured...|$|R
25|$|Many such {{concerns}} {{stem from the}} CI's relationship to Chinese Communist Party authorities, giving rise to criticisms about undermining academic freedom at host universities, engaging in industrial and military espionage, surveillance of Chinese students abroad, and attempts to advance the Chinese government's <b>political</b> <b>agendas</b> on controversial issues such as human rights, Taiwan and Tibet. Additional concerns have arisen over the institutes’ financial and academic viability, teaching quality, and relations with Chinese partner universities.|$|E
25|$|The {{controversial}} passages {{about the}} holy war, which most probably had {{been incorporated into}} the Kālacakra tradition {{during the time of}} massive advances of Islam into northern India when Buddhism had been on retreat, were later in modern time hijacked and used by several adventurous schemers both on the Left and on the Right to justify their <b>political</b> <b>agendas.</b> These questionable activities as well as the above-mentioned passages from old Kālacakra texts about the holy war and the ritual use of sexuality, prompted Victor and Victoria Trimondi, two German writers and philosophers, to launch a radical critique of the entire Kālacakra tradition.|$|E
25|$|Slum {{upgrading}} {{is largely}} a government controlled, funded and run process, rather than a competitive market driven process. Krueckeberg and Paulsen note conflicting politics, government corruption and street violence in slum regularization process {{is part of the}} reality. Slum upgrading and tenure regularization also upgrade and regularize the slum bosses and <b>political</b> <b>agendas,</b> while threatening the influence and power of municipal officials and ministries. Slum upgrading does not address poverty, low paying jobs from informal economy, and other characteristics of slums. It is unclear whether slum upgrading can lead to long term sustainable improvement to slums.|$|E

25|$|However, by 1980, the Australian Democrats had {{employed}} the postal-ballot method at both national at state levels {{to develop an}} extensive body of written policy covering not only the <b>political</b> <b>agendas</b> of the day but also innovative and far-sighted policies for environmental and economic sustainability, water and energy conservation, e.g., through development of alternative energy sources, expanded public transport, etc. To the community's growing concerns about human rights, the Australian Democrats added finely detailed policies on animal welfare and species preservation. The material is available in election manifestos and copies of the party's journals, obtainable in major public libraries.|$|E
25|$|Having {{previously}} boycotted {{playing at}} Bristol's Colston Hall {{due to its}} connection with the city's historic slave trade, in October 2012, Del Naja heavily criticised Bristol Mayor candidate George Ferguson because of his membership of a local organisation the Society of Merchant Venturers. The organisation {{dates back to the}} 16th century and had many connections with the Bristol slave trade, continuing to this day as an elitist private organisation, open to very few by invitation only. In November 2012 Del Naja then took a surprising stance to reverse his position and endorse the politically independent, wealthy, ex LibDem parliamentary candidate, George Ferguson. Del Naja was cited by local media as saying that the other candidates had only party <b>political</b> <b>agendas</b> at heart and a newly elected mayor needed more imagination to help implement creative projects for Bristol.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of the {{controversy}} concerning the capital, and public dissatisfaction of economic development, Uri party lost much of its popularity. When the Uri party was defeated in by-elections held on 30 April 2005, losing every one of the 23 electoral districts, Uri Party lost its majority in the National Assembly. Facing the outcome of his unpopularity, Roh took a rather strange measure to manage the government when he proposed a grand coalition with the opposition Grand National Party. Roh's rationale was that since it was impossible to continue his presidency with an approval rate of around 20 percent, a grand coalition comprising the Uri party and the Grand National Party was desirable, and that the difference between both parties in terms of <b>political</b> <b>agendas</b> was actually minute. Roh promised he would yield much of his power and might even resign from office if a grand coalition was successfully launched.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>political</b> <b>agenda</b> is {{essentially}} defined as what governmental officials find important to discuss. Those {{closest to the}} policy process have the biggest control on what issues reach the <b>political</b> <b>agenda.</b> They are {{the ones with the}} most power to decide which ideas or issues have the most importance, and which ideas or issues are unimportant. For example, the President of the United States, has the power to make treaties, appoint ambassadors, appoint judges of the supreme court etc. These types of powers ultimately shape what voices are present in parliament and subsequently what issues reach the <b>political</b> <b>agenda.</b>|$|R

25|$|Perhaps most insidiously, however, {{was how the}} {{transition}} to the Habyarimana regime illustrated the ease and means by which Rwandan national regimes could redraw and manipulate the racial/ethnic divisions of their own people in order to fit their own <b>political</b> <b>agendas.</b> Despite years of relative peace following the formation of the 2nd republic, Habyarimana’s goals of reconciliation ultimately failed. Hutu/Tutsi differences remained codified in law. When Habyarimana’s government began {{the transition}} to a democratic system in the late 1980s, it was perhaps inevitable that divisions would manifest once again along Hutu/Tutsi lines. As well, popular Hutu resentment at the disproportional representation of Tutsi in the quota system meant that friction between the groups never truly dissipated. Some political scientists credit these failures as a few of the reasons why Rwanda so quickly slipped back into political turmoil along ethnic lines in the years immediately preceding the 1993 genocide.|$|E
25|$|By the 1970s, {{following}} passage of {{federal civil rights}} legislation in the mid-1960s and enforcement of constitutional rights by the federal government, {{the influence of the}} Councils had waned considerably yet remained an institutional basis for the majority of white residents in Mississippi. The successor organization to the White Citizens' Councils is the St. Louis-based Council of Conservative Citizens, founded in 1985 to continue collaborations between Ku Klux Klan and white supremacist <b>political</b> <b>agendas</b> in the United States. Republican politician and past Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott of Mississippi was a member while North Carolina Senator Jesse Helms and Georgia Congressman Bob Barr were both strong supporters of the Council of Conservative Citizens; David Duke also spoke at a fund raising event, while Patrick Buchanan's campaign manager was linked to both Duke and the Council. In 1996, a Charleston, SC, drive-by shooting by Klan members of three African American males occurred after a Council rally; Dylann Roof, responsible for the 2015 murder of nine Emanuel AME church members in Charleston, espoused Council of Conservative Citizens rhetoric in a manifesto.|$|E
25|$|According to the Constitution of Denmark, Denmark {{is governed}} {{according}} {{to the principle of}} negative parliamentarism, meaning that while a government doesn't need the majority of seats in parliament, it must never have a majority of seats against it in a vote of no confidence. Before the ongoing elections, this was relevant since the government, consisting of the Conservative People's Party and the Liberals did not have a majority of seats, but depended on the support of the Danish People's Party. Early opinion polls showed that neither a right-wing or a left-wing government could gather enough seats to be in government without the support of the newly established New Alliance. This caused a lot of interest, since New Alliance had stated that they would first give the government the opportunity to propose a programme for government, but that they would not definitely support a right-wing government prior to seeing how many of their <b>political</b> <b>agendas</b> they could work together on. Many people were unsure how this would be possible, since New Alliance was originally formed to limit the influence of the Danish People's Party, without whom a right-wing government did not seem possible in opinion polls. After the elections, however, it was clear that New Alliance did not get enough seats in parliament to break the previous right-wing majority.|$|E
