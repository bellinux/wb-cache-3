50|$|In 1946, Pickels cofounded Spinco (Specialized Instruments Corp.) {{to market}} {{analytical}} and preparative ultracentrifuges {{based on his}} design. Pickels considered his design to be too complicated for commercial use and developed a more easily operated, “foolproof” version. But even with the enhanced design, sales of analytical centrifuges remained low, and Spinco almost went bankrupt. The company survived by concentrating on sales of <b>preparative</b> <b>ultracentrifuge</b> models, which were becoming popular as workhorses in biomedical laboratories. In 1949, Spinco introduced the Model L, the first <b>preparative</b> <b>ultracentrifuge</b> to reach a maximum speed of 40,000 rpm. In 1954, Beckman Instruments, now Beckman Coulter, purchased the company, forming {{the basis of its}} Spinco centrifuge division.|$|E

Similarly, the sedi-mentation profiles of estrogen-receptor species as de-termined by sucrose gradient centrifugation were identical.

50|$|<b>Preparative</b> <b>ultracentrifuges</b> are {{available}} {{with a wide variety}} of rotors suitable for a great range of experiments. Most rotors are designed to hold tubes that contain the samples. Swinging bucket rotors allow the tubes to hang on hinges so the tubes reorient to the horizontal as the rotor initially accelerates. Fixed angle rotors are made of a single block of material and hold the tubes in cavities bored at a predetermined angle. Zonal rotors are designed to contain a large volume of sample in a single central cavity rather than in tubes. Some zonal rotors are capable of dynamic loading and unloading of samples while the rotor is spinning at high speed.|$|R

40|$|DNA {{extracted}} from purified polyoma virus contains closed and open molecules which are separable by velocity sedimentation {{either in the}} analytical or in the <b>preparative</b> <b>ultracentrifuge.</b> The closed configuration of the DNA {{gives rise to the}} fast band (component I) and the open configuration to a slow band, which is in some cases double (components II and III). Components I and II are able to produce plaques on mouse embryo monolayers, i. e., they possess cytocidal activity but which of the components cause cell transformation could not be determined owing to the lack of an adequate quantitative assay for transformation. A determination of the role of these DNA components in transformation is important, since it may clarify the mechanism of transformation. Such a determination is now made possible by the development of a sensitive quantitative assay for transformation caused by polyoma virus. This method is based on the ability of the transformed cells to form colonies in agar where {{the vast majority of the}} untransformed cells are unable to form colonies. Preliminary experiments have demonstrated that this method is also suitable for the study of the transforming ability of polyoma DNA...|$|E
40|$|Escherichia coli strain 15 TAU, which {{requires}} thymine, arginine, and uracil {{for growth and}} harbors an apparently defective prophage, was induced by exposure to ultraviolet light (580 ergs/mm 2) or to mitomycin C (5 μg/ml). Phage particles (coliphage 15) were recovered from the resulting lysate by treatment with deoxyribonuclease, filtration, and several cycles of differential centrifugation. Analysis of the phage particles obtained by using cesium chloride density gradient centrifugation in a <b>preparative</b> <b>ultracentrifuge</b> resulted in the resolution of three components. The major component had a peak density of 1. 52 to 1. 53 g/cm 3 followed by components with densities of 1. 5 and 1. 49 g/cm 3. The guanine plus cytosine content of coliphage 15 deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) was determined by both analytical ultracentrifugation in cesium chloride and by thermal denaturation in standard saline citrate buffer. Respective values of 46. 4 ± 1 % and 46. 6 ± 1 % guanine plus cytosine content were obtained. Coliphage 15 DNA formed molecular hybrids with messenger ribonucleic acid (RNA) from both uninduced and ultraviolet-induced cultures of E. coli 15 TAU, but did not hybridize with E. coli ribosomal RNA.

40|$|The use of angular light {{scattering}} techniques {{has proved to}} be of the highest precision for the size distribution analysis of colloidal size spheres, but is inherently limited to quite narrow, monomodal size distributions of particles of a single chemical component. These limitations can be overcome to a limited degree by a technique that utilizes {{light scattering}} and a <b>preparative</b> <b>ultracentrifuge.</b> The latter fractionates the colloidal particles according to density (i. e., chemical com position) and/or size. Applying the zonal ultracentrifugation technique, both types of separation take place {{in the presence of a}} density gradient and ultimately fractionated samples are obtained which are then characterized by light scattering to provide size distribution parameters. The size parameters assigned to each fraction can then be used to reconstruct the original size distribution. A further use of the technique will be demonstrated using a %T vs. fraction number curve obtained from a recording spectrophotometer which is on line between the rotor and the fraction collector. By calibration of the rotor using the ultracentrifuge-light scattering technique above, the %T vs. fraction number curve can be converted to a plot of relative frequency vs. diameter. The above techniques will be applied to broad continuous distributions, monomodal distributions and to a mixture of polystyrene, polyvinylchloride, and polyvinylacetate latexes of different sizes...|$|E

Liver brei was found to contain a family of phosphatascs (phenol disodium phosphate substrate, sodium malonate buffers and Turgitol NPX, a non-ionic detergent). Activity maxima at pH 4. 1 and 5. 9 were observed in untreated brei prepared in 0. 25 i sucrose. "l~he addition of the non-ionic detergent Turgitol NPX selectively caused the release of considerable additional activity between these optima.

This quantity is necessary for the assign-ment of the Type II pattern (1 - 3), which is defined as an increase rn LDL concentration above some arbitrarily selected cut-off limit. An indirect method is presented here for estimat-ing the plasma LDL concentration in terms of the cholesterol contained in this lipoprotein (C LD L). The method requires measurement of the concen-trations of plasma total cholesterol, triglycerides, and CHDL. This information can be obtained with-out ultracentrifugation and requires only routine lipid analyses in addition to a rapid precipitation of all plasma lipoproteins other than HDL. Two observations are used in the calculation. One is that the ratio of the mass of triglyceride to that of of cholesterol in VLDL is apparently relativel...|$|E
40|$|Experimental {{evidence}} indicates that the artery wvall reacts very differently to different plasma lipid particles retained locally at sites of mural injury. 13 While both post-prandial chylomicrons and low density plasma / 3 lipoproteins accumulate massively at such sites, the former, {{over a period of}} weeks, disappear without altering the response of the vessel wall to the original injury, whereas the latter regularly lead to a xanthomatous transformation of the basic inflammatory reaction that closely simulates the foam-cellular lesion of early atherosclerosis. It has also been observed that if animals' postprandial lactescent plasma is cleared by the intravenous injection of heparin, lipid is only transiently deposited at the sites of experimental arterial injury, and in a diffuse, non-particulate form as viewed by light microscopy. ' The serum-injected, living animal cornea {{has been found to be}} a useful model system for study of blood lipid-connective tissue reactions in relation to atherogenesis. 4 ' Recently there has been opportunity to investigate the effect of lipoprotein-lipase clearing on the fate of chylomicron lipids injected into the cornea. The importance of knowledge concerning tissue transport of plasma-lipid particles for the understanding of the pathogenesis and possible prevention of atherosclerosis has prompted the following brief report. METHODS Chylomicronemia was produced in a 10 kg., fasting donor dog by a single feeding of 250 gm. of can-ned horse meat together with 100 gm. of olive oil. Four hours after feeding, blood was withdrawn and serum obtained by low-speed centrifugation. The serum was heavily lactescent and had the following composition: total cholesterol 120. 0 mg. /per ml., free cholesterol 30. 0 mg. /per 100 ml., fatty acids 24. 0 mEq. /L., phospholipids 14. 0 mg. /per 100 ml., total proteins 6. 8 gm. /per 100 ml.
