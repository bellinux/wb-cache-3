The as-deposited films on both substrates are magnetically soft with an FCC structure and exhibit a <b>perpendicular</b> <b>anisotropy.</b> After annealing at 500 °C, the sample on the Al 2 O 3 /Si substrate has become magnetically isotropic but the sample on the MgO substrate still has <b>perpendicular</b> <b>anisotropy</b> with FCT structure. This film deposited on the MgO substrate did not show a strong <b>perpendicular</b> <b>anisotropy</b> due to the diffusion of the Au and the (1 1 1) nucleation of initial Au layer. We can obtain a <b>perpendicular</b> <b>anisotropy</b> in the multilayer films without an initial Au layer on a (0 0 1) MgO substrate. After annealing at 400 °C, these films have L 10 phase with (0 0 1) texture and strong <b>perpendicular</b> <b>anisotropy...</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{deposition}} of a Co/Pt layer-stacked film {{that has a}} high <b>perpendicular</b> <b>anisotropy</b> and saturation magnetization was investigated using co-sputtering of Co and Pt at room temperature. A film with a high <b>perpendicular</b> <b>anisotropy</b> of 1 × 107 erg/cm 3 and a saturation magnetization of 600 emu/cm 3 was obtained when 0. 62 nm of Co and 0. 45 nm of Pt layers were stacked at a high Ar deposition pressure of 4. 8 Pa. Although {{the cause of the}} high anisotropy is not clear, the high <b>perpendicular</b> <b>anisotropy</b> and saturation magnetization that were obtained fulfill the magnetic property requirement of bit-patterned media for high-density recording...|$|E

It is observed that high temperature annealing modifies the magnetic properties of the Co layer, inducing an enhancement of the <b>perpendicular</b> magnetic <b>anisotropy.</b> The microscopic structural properties are analyzed via X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy, X-ray Magnetic Circular Dichroism and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy measurements.

Due {{to water}} {{molecules}} adsorption the reversible change of domains width and domain structure reconstruction in bismuth-doped ferrite-garnet thin films with <b>perpendicular</b> magnetic <b>anisotropy</b> was observed. The change of domains width was 15 % in saturated water vapor at room temperature.

The metastable vortex state {{does not exist in}} a single layer, and it is only found in the trilayer structure with the <b>perpendicular</b> magnetic <b>anisotropy</b> polarizer layer.

40|$|We {{report the}} results of {{magnetic}} and microstructural studies for T/Dy (T=Fe, Co, Ni) compositionally modulated films prepared in a multiple-gun sputtering system. The <b>perpendicular</b> <b>anisotropy</b> and magnetization were measured systematically for X-Å Fe/Y-Å Dy and X-Å Co/Y-Å Dy films. The layer-thickness dependence of the magnetization for Co/Dy and Fe/Dy was interpreted {{in terms of the}} antiparallel coupling between transition-metal and Dy magnetic moments. For Co/Dy films the ranges of X and Y required for <b>perpendicular</b> <b>anisotropy</b> were determined. A comparision of the structural and magnetic properties of Ni/Dy, Co/Dy, and Fe/Dy is given and the origin of the <b>perpendicular</b> <b>anisotropy</b> is discussed.

The different temperature dependence of two (Co/Pt) (3) stacks in pMTJs is mainly caused by the additional <b>perpendicular</b> <b>anisotropy</b> created at interface between the ferromagnetic electrode and the AlO(x) barrier...|$|E

The ferrite thin-films deposited on glass substrates had <b>perpendicular</b> magnetic <b>anisotropy,</b> high coercivity of about 3000 Oe and very smooth surface.

30|$|We {{fabricated}} FePt-based perpendicular patterned media using {{a selective}} combination of E-beam lithography and either Ar plasma etching (deposition-first process) or FePt lift-off (deposition-last process). A FePt film on a CrV seed layer grown at 400 °C showed a high <b>perpendicular</b> <b>anisotropy</b> indicating L 10 phase of FCT structure formed during deposition, whereas the anisotropy was collapsed in patterned media fabricated {{from the film}} stack. We employed the deposition-last process to avoid chemical and structural disordering by impinging Ar ions. For a patterned medium with 100 nm patterns made by this process, the out-of-plane coercivity {{was measured to be}} fivefold larger than its in-plane value and the out-of-plane M-H curve exhibited a perfect squareness, indicating a high <b>perpendicular</b> <b>anisotropy.</b> To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of a high <b>perpendicular</b> <b>anisotropy</b> in patterned media using a Cr-based compound seed layer. Furthermore, the deposition-last process may be a promising way to achieve ultra-high-density patterned media due to its maintainability of <b>perpendicular</b> <b>anisotropy</b> and controllability of pattern size and shape.|$|E

40|$|Magnetic vortex cores {{exhibit a}} gyrotropic motion, and may reach a {{critical}} velocity, {{at which point}} they invert their z-component of the magnetization. We performed micromagnetic simulations to describe this vortex core polarity reversal in magnetic nanodisks presenting a <b>perpendicular</b> <b>anisotropy.</b> We found that the critical velocity decreases with increasing <b>perpendicular</b> <b>anisotropy,</b> therefore departing from a universal criterion, that relates this velocity only to the exchange stiffness of the material. This leads to a critical velocity inversely proportional to the vortex core radius. We have also shown that {{in a pair of}} interacting disks, it is possible to switch the core vortex polarity through a non-local excitation; exciting one disk by applying a rotating magnetic field, one is able to switch the polarity of a neighbor disk, with a larger <b>perpendicular</b> <b>anisotropy...</b>|$|E
40|$|We have {{investigated}} the magnetic and magneto-optic properties of Co/Ni multilayers deposited on Ag and Au buffer layers. The samples with Au buffer layers show <b>perpendicular</b> magnetic <b>anisotropy,</b> but those with Ag buffer layers do not.

40|$|Investigation of the {{thickness}} {{dependence of the}} magnetic anisotropy in B 2 -type Co 2 TiSi films on GaAs(001), shows a pronounced <b>perpendicular</b> magnetic <b>anisotropy</b> at 10 K for thicknesses up to 13. 5 nm. We have evidenced that the interfacial anisotropy induced by interface clusters has a strong influence on the <b>perpendicular</b> magnetic <b>anisotropy</b> of this hybrid structure, especially at temperatures lower than the blocking temperature of the clusters (28 K). However, as this influence can be ruled out at higher temperatures, the <b>perpendicular</b> magnetic <b>anisotropy</b> which is found to persist up to room-temperature can be ascribed to the magnetic properties of the Co 2 TiSi films. For thicknesses larger than 15. 0 nm, we observe an alignment of the magnetic easy axis parallel to the sample surface, which is most likely due to the shape anisotropy and the film structure...|$|R
3000|$|Comparing the out-of-plane {{coercivity}} of this patterned medium {{with that}} of the as-grown film prepared by the deposition-first process, there exists a small difference of about 400 Oe. We believe that this magnitude of difference is reasonable since the surface migration of adatoms during film growth at elevated temperature (400 °C) is easier compared to solid-state diffusion of constituents during post-annealing at the same temperature. Qiu et al. also fabricated FePt patterned media with underlayers such as Ag and MgO, employing a similar deposition-last process [15]. In their media, however, the FCC-to-FCT phase transition was retarded to higher temperatures and no <b>perpendicular</b> <b>anisotropy</b> was observed.

40|$|We {{investigate}} in {{this paper}} the origin of <b>perpendicular</b> <b>anisotropy</b> in Co (1. 6 nm) /Pt (3. 0 nm) bilayers grown on alumina and annealed up to 650 ^∘C. Above 350 ^∘C, all layers exhibit <b>perpendicular</b> <b>anisotropy.</b> Then coercive fields increase linearly with annealing temperature following two different rates: 0. 05 T/ 100 ^∘C below 550 ^∘C and 0. 8 T/ 100 ^∘C above. By making careful structural characterizations using x-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy, we demonstrate the presence of short range correlation of L 1 _ 1 type below 550 ^∘C whereas above 550 ^∘C, L 1 _ 0 chemical ordering is observed. We conclude that <b>perpendicular</b> <b>anisotropy</b> observed in Co/Pt bilayers grown on alumina and annealed may not only be due to interface anisotropy as usually invoked but also to CoPt alloying and chemical ordering that take place during post-growth annealing.

This critical interfacial effect of electron orbital hybridization is very sensitive to the interfacial strain or stress [8], which could be brought in through the volume evolution of noble metal.
