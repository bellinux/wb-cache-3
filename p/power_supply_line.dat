50|$|During the 1970s, the {{increasing}} digitization of electronic circuits came with decreasing operating voltages, and increasing switching frequencies and ripple current loads.

5000|$|A {{motor-generator}} (an M-G set) is {{a device}} for converting electrical power to another form. Motor-generator sets {{are used to}} convert frequency, voltage, or phase of power. They may {{also be used to}} isolate electrical loads from the electrical <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> <b>line.</b> Large motor-generators were widely used to convert industrial amounts of power while smaller motor-generators (such as the one shown in the picture) were used to convert battery power to higher DC voltages.

50|$|Differential {{signaling}} {{is often}} used in computers to reduce electromagnetic interference, because complete screening is not possible with microstrips and chips in computers, due to geometric constraints {{and the fact that}} screening does not work at DC. If a DC <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> <b>line</b> and a low-voltage signal line share the same ground, the power current returning through the ground can induce a significant voltage in it. A low-resistance ground reduces this problem to some extent. A balanced pair of microstrip lines is a convenient solution, because it does not need an additional PCB layer, as a stripline does. Because each line causes a matching image current in the ground plane, which is required anyway for supplying power, the pair looks like four lines and therefore has a shorter crosstalk distance than a simple isolated pair. In fact, it behaves as well as a twisted pair. Low crosstalk is important when many lines are packed into a small space, as on a typical PCB.|$|E
50|$|To {{decouple}} other subcircuits {{from the}} effect of the sudden current demand, a decoupling capacitor can be placed between the supply voltage line and its reference (ground) next to the switched load. While the load is switched out, the capacitor charges up to full power supply voltage and otherwise does nothing. When the load is applied, the capacitor initially supplies demanded current. Ideally, by the time the capacitor runs out of charge, the <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> <b>line</b> inductance is saturated, and the load can draw full current at normal voltage from the power supply (and the capacitor can recharge too). Note that the voltage dip is reduced but not eliminated; i.e., the decoupling is not perfect and sometimes parallel combinations of caps are used to improve response. The best way to reduce switching noise is to design a PCB as a giant capacitor by sandwiching the power and ground planes across a dielectric material.|$|E

5000|$|Inadequate {{last mile}} {{connectivity}} {{is the main}} problem to supply electricity for all users. The country already has adequate generation and transmission capacity to meet the full demand temporally and spatially. However, {{due to lack of}} last-mile link-up with all electricity consumers and reliable power supply (to exceed 99%), many consumers depend on DG sets using costly diesel oil for meeting unavoidable power requirements. Also more than 10 million households are using battery storage UPS as back-up in case of load shedding. India imports nearly US$2 billion worth of battery storage UPS every year. The distribution companies should focus on providing uninterrupted power supply to all the consumers who are using costly DG set's power. This should be achieved by laying separate buried power cables (not to be effected by rain and winds) for emergency power supply in addition to the normal supply lines. Emergency supply power line shall supply power when the normal <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> <b>line</b> is not working. Emergency power supply would be charged at higher price without any subsidy but less than the generation cost from diesel oil.
