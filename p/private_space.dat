5|$|Walter de Lacy {{travelled}} to Ireland in 1201 and {{the following}} year his properties, including Ludlow Castle, were once again confiscated to ensure his loyalty and placed {{under the control of}} William de Braose, his father-in-law. Walter's lands were returned to him, subject to the payment of a fine of 400marks, but in 1207 his disagreements with royal officials in Ireland led to King John seizing the castle and putting it under the control of William again. Walter reconciled himself with John the following year, but meanwhile William himself had fallen out with the King; violence broke out and both Walter and William took refuge in Ireland, with John taking control of Ludlow yet again. It was not until 1215 that their relationship recovered and John agreed to give Ludlow back to Walter. At some point during the early 13th century, the innermost bailey was constructed in the castle, creating an additional <b>private</b> <b>space</b> within the inner bailey.|$|E

25|$|In {{the social}} sciences, a {{perceived}} clinical bias exists in agoraphobia research. Branches {{of the social}} sciences, especially geography, have increasingly become interested {{in what may be}} thought of as a spatial phenomenon. One such approach links the development of agoraphobia with modernity. Factors considered contributing to agoraphobia within modernity are the ubiquity of cars and urbanization. These have helped develop the expansion of public space, on one hand, and the contraction of <b>private</b> <b>space</b> on the other, thus creating in the minds of agoraphobic-prone people a tense, unbridgeable gulf between the two.|$|E

This assertion can be supported by much lower published launch costs for <b>private</b> <b>space</b> launch vehicles such as Falcon 9 developed with private financing.

25|$|The {{study of}} {{background}} music {{focuses on the}} impact of music with non-musical tasks, including changes in behavior in the presence of different types, settings, or styles of music. In laboratory settings, music can affect performance on cognitive tasks (memory, attention, and comprehension), both positively and negatively. Used extensively as an advertising aid, music may also affect marketing strategies, ad comprehension, and consumer choices. Background music can influence learning, working memory and recall, performance while working on tests, and attention in cognitive monitoring tasks. Background music can also be used as a way to relieve boredom, create positive moods, and maintain a <b>private</b> <b>space.</b> Background music has been shown to put a restless mind at ease by presenting the listener with various melodies and tones.|$|E

25|$|In {{the case}} of nudity in front {{of those who do}} not {{normally}} occupy the same <b>private</b> <b>space,</b> that will usually depend on whether the outsider is comfortable with the nudity and whether the nudity is reciprocated, as in {{the case of}} social nudism. Social nudism may take place in any private social context, such as at one's home with friends or with acquaintances at a nudist facility or event, such as a naturist club, community center, resort or other facility. To generate an atmosphere of fun at a social gathering and lighten the social atmosphere, or to heighten the sexual atmosphere and ease those present into some state of nudity, organisers of a social gathering may organise party games, which may involve some level of nudity, such as strip games, for example strip poker, which can be played by single-sex groups or by mixed groups.|$|E
25|$|Another {{factor is}} the level of privacy to which a person can be assured - for example, some parts of a home may be seen from the outside or there may be a {{possibility}} of others walking in. The expectation of privacy may be confined to the home and sometimes the backyard. Inside the home, it may be restricted to the bedroom or just the bathroom. If a person is not alone, their comfort in removing clothing in front of another person will generally depend on the nature of a relationship of those who jointly occupy the same <b>private</b> <b>space,</b> as well as the attitudes of others to nudity. Besides the nature of a relationship, attitudes and incidences of nudity will also depend on the level of inhibition that each person has, as well as the level of privacy to which that they can be assured. Sometimes a person may unintentionally intrude on a person who is in the nude, which may lead to embarrassment of {{one or both of the}} people. The nude person may seek to quickly cover their private parts, while the clothed person may turn away, but this also depends on cultural differences and the relationship of the people.|$|E
500|$|After {{the hiring}} of Johansson, other major casting {{decisions}} quickly followed, beginning {{with the addition of}} English actor Colin Firth as Vermeer. Firth and Webber, both of a similar age and background, spent significant time discussing Vermeer's personality and lifestyle in the period leading up to the beginning of filming. While researching the role, Firth realised that Vermeer was [...] "incredibly elusive as an artist." [...] As a result, unlike Webber and Johansson, Firth chose to read the book to gain a better grasp of a man of whom little information existed on his private life. Firth sought to [...] "invent" [...] the character and discover his motivations, and ultimately identified with the artist for having a <b>private</b> <b>space</b> {{in the midst of a}} bustling family. Firth also studied painting techniques and visited museums carrying Vermeer works.|$|E

[...] The same could not be said of the bus during the band's touring years, when breakdowns and maintenance issues were frequent, possibly because of the Montana altitude, irregular driving habits of band personnel, or simply the mileage the bus accumulated.|$|E
500|$|The {{interior}} courtyard measures approximately [...] on {{each side}} and was completely enclosed by the palace, creating a very <b>private</b> <b>space</b> within. The buildings on the north, west and south sides faced outwards away from the private courtyard, opening onto it only via a central doorway in each structure. The eastern structure was built at a later date, has two lateral doorways and was the only side to face directly onto the courtyard; it highly {{may have been the}} residence of the city's ruler. Entrance to the courtyard is from the exterior the acropolis via these central doorways on the north, south and west sides. Of these three entrances, the northern entrance appears to have been the main entrance to the acropolis complex. The south entrance was a more private entrance that opened from the acropolis onto the terraces leading down to the water source in that direction. The western entrance lead to the terrace [...] above the causeway, providing a balcony with an excellent view across the city.|$|E
500|$|In October and November 1997, Channel 4 {{presented}} the novel sequence in four television films, with a screenplay by Hugh Whitemore, produced by Peter Amsorge. Widmerpool was played by Simon Russell Beale; in a generally critical {{review of the}} first film of the series, Thomas Sutcliffe in The Independent refers to Beale's performance as particularly good, bearing in mind the [...] "thin ledges of characterisation" [...] the script provides to the cast. The journalist David Aaronovitch thought Beale's interpretation of the character definitive: [...] "...the Widmerpool who insinuated his podgy bulk into my <b>private</b> <b>space</b> was... Simon Russell Beale's Widmerpool, who has come to stay". Reviewing the reissue of the films in DVD in 2012, Stuart Jeffries in The Guardian describes Widmerpool as [...] "one of fiction's most intriguing monsters" [...] and likens Beale's portrayal to that of [...] "a kind of grown-up Billy Bunter with the charm sucked out". Christopher Hitchens, writing in the New York Review of Books, criticised the production (though not Beale's performance), for depicting Widmerpool as [...] "a hapless rather than a hateful figure".|$|E
