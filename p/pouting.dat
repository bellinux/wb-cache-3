25|$|Copepods {{and other}} {{zooplankton}} are plentiful in the North Sea. These tiny organisms are crucial {{elements of the}} food chain supporting many species of fish. Over 230 species of fish live in the North Sea. Cod, haddock, whiting, saithe, plaice, sole, mackerel, herring, <b>pouting,</b> sprat, and sandeel are all very common and are fished commercially. Due to the various depths of the North Sea trenches and differences in salinity, temperature, and water movement, some fish such as blue-mouth redfish and rabbitfish reside only in small areas of the North Sea.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Signal to {{interference}} plus {{noise ratio}} (SINR) -based call admission control schemes admit calls {{as long as}} SINR is higher than a threshold value (SINRth). Setting a relatively low SINRth results in more users admitted into the system, and this in turn yields an increased outage probability (<b>Pout).</b> Hence, determining the lower bound of SINRth (SINRth lb) is vital to keep <b>Pout</b> below a maximum value, <b>Pout</b> max. In this letter, we derive SINRth lb in the reverse link of CDMA systems with imperfect power control by finding the relationship between <b>Pout</b> (due to power control infeasibility and SINR fluctuation) and SINRth. Then, SINRth lb is determined as the lowest SINRth that keeps <b>Pout</b> below a certain <b>Pout</b> max...|$|R
40|$|The Norway <b>pout</b> (Trisopterus esmarkii) {{stock in}} the North Sea has {{experienced}} poor recruitment recently. Herring (Clupea harengus) has been suggested {{to be a major}} predator on fish larvae in the North Sea. We investigated possible interactions between herring and Norway <b>pout</b> using a simple statistical analysis and a modified stock - recruit relationship. There was a significant negative relationship (linear regression, r = 20. 44, p < 0. 05) between total herring biomass and recruitment of Norway <b>pout.</b> The spawning stock of Norway <b>pout</b> is typically dominated by 2 -year-olds, and there was a strong negative relationship (linear regression, r = 20. 79, p < 0. 01) between herring biomass and Norway <b>pout</b> spawning-stock biomass (SSB) 2 years later. A Beverton-Holt model fitted to stock recruit data of Norway <b>pout</b> produced a rather poor correlation (r(2) = 0. 04). However, when only the Norway <b>pout</b> SSB not overlapping with herring is considered, the fit between the model and the stock - recruit data improves (r(2) = 0. 31). The analyses indicate a negative impact by herring on recruitment of Norway <b>pout,</b> the most plausible cause for this being herring predation on Norway <b>pout</b> larvae, but field studies are needed to verify such predation...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} {{describes}} a new semen diluent (diluent C) which prolongs the sustained motility of ocean <b>pout</b> sperm, a distinguishing {{feature of the}} sperm of internally fertilizing teleosts. Sperm motilities were compared in the new diluent (C), based on the ionic composition of ocean <b>pout</b> seminal plasma, vs. four other semen diluents (A, B, D and E) ordinarily used for extending the semen of external fertilizers. While sperm retained motility after extension of ocean <b>pout</b> semen {{in all of these}} diluents, motility was significantly reduced following sperm resuspension in diluents B and D. Since sperm motility remained high in diluent C, formulated to closely mimic the composition of ocean <b>pout</b> seminal plasma, it was selected for additional experimentation. Negative effects were observed on sperm motility after dilution (> 1 : 10) of ocean <b>pout</b> semen with diluent C, but sperm motility could be restored by replacement of the seminal plasma. Of practical importance for storage of ocean <b>pout</b> sperm at 4 degrees C, it was shown that semen dilution 1 : 3 in diluent C preserved sperm motility beyond 5 days. Although ocean <b>pout</b> sperm tolerate a fairly wide range of K+ levels (0 - 30 mmol/l), the best motility was observed from 10 - 20 mmol/l [K+], similar to the ionic levels found in seminal plasma. Finally, since no change in fertility of ocean <b>pout</b> sperm occurred following 1 : 3 dilution of semen in diluent C, we conclude that diluent C is an effective medium for in vitro artificial egg insemination and prolonged motility of ocean <b>pout</b> sperm.

500|$|The {{cover sleeve}} and images were shot by Steven Meisel, {{who would become}} a regular {{collaborator}} with Madonna, in a suite at the St. Regis Hotel. Madonna wanted the album title to make provocative link between her own religious name—Madonna as the Roman Catholic title for Jesus' mother Mary—and the Christian concept of the virgin birth. With the title song alluding to this concept, Madonna wanted the album cover to have mixed messages as well. Author Graham Thompson described that [...] "reclining on a satin sheet, with a bouquet on her lap and wearing a wedding dress, a closer inspection reveals Madonna's image as highly fetishized and sexualized." [...] He added that the heavy make-up, <b>pouting</b> lips, and despoiled hair, along with the tight-fitting bustier and full-length gloves, turned Madonna's image into a figure not of virtue, but of desire. This point, according to Thompson, is further emphasized by the belt she is wearing, the wording on which is just visible as [...] "Boy Toy". He added: [...] "The image was ambiguous and was based upon the fact that Madonna's appeal at that point of her career was not presenting herself just {{as an object of}} desire, but also as a desiring female subject".|$|E

40|$|This study uses a 20 -year {{time series}} of {{standardized}} bottom trawl winter survey data (1994 - 2013) from the Barents Sea, {{to investigate the}} changes in abundance and distributional range of Norway <b>pout</b> (Trisopterus esmarkii) in response to changing sea temperatures. Due to the boreal Norway <b>pout’s</b> rather limited geographical distribution in the Barents Sea, and that Norway <b>pout</b> suffers no targeted fishing mortality in the Barents Sea, the species may be a well suited indicator species of climate and ecosystem change here. Annual Norway <b>pout</b> abundance indices were adjusted for diel changes in catchability, and an evident increase in Norway <b>pout</b> abundance was found during the study period, although a marked decrease {{the last two years}} was also evident. The distributional range was also found to increase, especially northwards from the distinct core area in the southwestern part of the Barents Sea. Although a rather weak correlation was found when comparing annual Norway <b>pout</b> abundance indices with annual corresponding sea temperatures (r = 0. 32), stronger correlations were found when abundance indices were compared to sea temperatures which were measured two (r = 0. 67) and three years (r = 0. 72) in advance. Reasons for these rather strong lagged (delayed) correlations are briefly being discussed in this thesis, and may be related to temperature effects on recruitment, maternal conditions (e. g. fecundity), changes in abundance/distribution of other species which affect Norway <b>pout</b> abundance (prey, predators or competitors), and/or a gradual expansion due to increased suitable habitat...|$|R
