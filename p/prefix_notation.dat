2500|$|When {{working with}} curried {{functions}} it is customary to use <b>prefix</b> <b>notation</b> with function application considered left-associative, since juxtaposition of multiple arguments—as in (f x y)—naturally maps to {{evaluation of a}} curried function.

2500|$|Some early {{programming}} languages, notably Lisp (1958) and COBOL (1959), {{addressed this}} problem by allowing a hyphen ("-") to be used between words of compound identifiers, as in [...] "END-OF-FILE": Lisp because it worked well with <b>prefix</b> <b>notation</b> (a Lisp parser would not treat a hyphen {{in the middle of}} a symbol as a subtraction operator) and COBOL because its operators were individual English words.

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{possibilities}} of doing mathematical problems involving algebra on a computer. A language is designed which allows names to occur as unknown quantities. This language has all the facilities of a general purpose language such as IMP, but {{is designed to be}} used inter-actively by a user at a console. The language also includes instructions which cause the usual algebraic operations to be applied to expressions. These operators include simplification, differentiation, but not integration. A brief survey is given of other languages in the field, with comments on their capabilities and restrictions. The second part of the thesis describes how the language is implemented. An interpreter is used. Statements of the language are analysed syntactically and then obeyed. Algebraic expressions are stored in byte arrays, using a type of <b>prefix</b> Polish <b>notation.</b> Finally the language is reviewed in the light of recent work done in the field, and suggestions are made for a further version...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Subtree {{matching}} is {{an important}} problem in Computer Science on which a number of tasks, such as mechanical theorem proving, term-rewriting, symbolic computation and nonprocedural programming languages are based on. A systematic approach {{to the construction of}} subtree pattern matchers by deterministic pushdown automata, which read subject trees in <b>prefix</b> and postfix <b>notation,</b> is presented. The method is analogous to the construction of string pattern matchers: for a given pattern, a nondeterministic pushdown automaton is created and is then determinised. In addition, it is shown that the size of the resulting deterministic pushdown automata directly corresponds {{to the size of the}} existing string pattern matchers based on finite automata...|$|R

Creating classification exemplars is conducted from text by using a word n-gram model. We evaluate our system based on the GE-NIA version 3. 02 corpus which contains 2, 000 paper abstracts. The system obtains an 0. 705 F-score on exact match term performance. Biological concept markers are also assigned to each located term indicating its meaning.

5000|$|Compared to {{normalized}} scientific notation, one {{disadvantage of}} using SI <b>prefixes</b> and engineering <b>notation</b> is that significant figures {{are not always}} readily apparent. For example, 500 µm and 500 × 10−6 m cannot express the uncertainty distinctions between 5 × 10−4 m, 5.0 × 10−4 m, and 5.00 × 10−4 m. This can be solved by changing {{the range of the}} coefficient in front of the power from the common 1-1000 to 0.001-1.0. In some cases this may be suitable; in others it may be impractical. In the previous example, 0.5 mm, 0.50 mm, or 0.500 mm would have been used to show uncertainty and significant figures. It is also common to state the precision explicitly, such as [...] "47 k&Omega; ±5%" ...|$|R
5000|$|To {{understand}} {{the way that}} AUG works, {{it is useful to}} think of wordsand phrases as atoms and expressions, respectively, in a typed language ofcombinators. For our simplified version of AUG, there are just two primitivetypes: T representing terms (for example, nouns such as [...] "friend" [...] and nounphrases such as [...] "my friend"), and S representing complete sentences (such as"my friend runs"). The only non-primitive type is of the form Oxy, denotingphrases that transform phrases of type x to modified phrases of type y; this isthe most important concept behind the AUG formalism.For example, the word [...] "my" [...] is treated as having type OTT since it is appliedto a term of type T to obtain a modified term, also of type T (every word ispre-assigned one or more types in this way). Thus the construction of the nounphrase [...] "my friend" [...] can be described by an inference:More generally, we can use the following rule to describe the application of onephrase, p of type Oxy, to another, q of type x:Clearly, types of the form Oxy correspond to function types, written as (x --> y)in more conventional notation, while the typing rule above is the standardmethod for typing the application of a function p to an argument value q.The O for function types is used in the descriptions of AUG cited above, andfor the most part we will continue to use the same notation here to avoid anyconfusion with type expressions in Haskell; in our program, the types of naturallanguage phrases are represented by data values, not by Haskell types. Anotheradvantage of the <b>prefix</b> O <b>notation</b> is that it avoids the need for parentheses andallows a more compact notation for types.The results of parsing a complete sentence can be described by a tree structure labelledwith the types of the words and phrases that are used in its construction. The following example is produced directly by the program described later from the input string [...] "my friend lives in Boston".The results of parsing a complete sentence can be described by a tree structurelabelled with the types of the words and phrases that are used in itsconstruction. The following example is produced directly by the program described later from the input string [...] "my friend lives in Boston".Notice that, to maintain the original word order, we have allowed both forwardand backward application of functions to arguments. The first of these wasdescribed by the rule above, while the second is just:For example, in the tree above, we have used this rule to apply the phrasein Boston to the intransitive verb lives; the function acts as a modifier,turning the action of [...] "living" [...] into the more specific action of [...] "living in Boston".It is sometimes useful to rearrange the trees produced by parsing a phraseso that functions are always written {{to the left of the}} arguments to which theyare applied. This reveals the applicative structure of a particular phrase andhelps us to concentrate on underlying grammatical structure without beingdistracted by concerns about word order -- which vary considerably from onelanguage to another. Rewriting the parse tree above in this way we obtain:In situations where the types of subphrases are not required, we can use aflattened, curried form of these trees, such as in Boston lives (my friend),to describe the result of parsing a phrase. The two different ways of arranginga parse tree shown here correspond to the concepts of phenotype and genotypegrammar, respectively, in AUG, but will not be discussed in any further detailhere.One of the most important tasks in an application of AUG is to assignsuitable types to each word in some given lexicon or dictionary. The type T is anobvious choice for simple nouns like [...] "friend" [...] and [...] "Boston" [...] in the example above.Possessive pronouns like [...] "my" [...] can be treated in the same way as adjectives usingthe type OTT. In a similar way, intransitive verbs, like [...] "lives", can be describedby the type OTS transforming a subject term of type T into a sentence phraseof type S. The word [...] "in", with type OTOOTSOTS, in the example above deservesspecial attention. Motivated by the diagram above, we can think of [...] "in" [...] asa function that combines a place of type T (where?), an action of type OTS(what?), and a subject of type T (who?) to obtain a sentence phrase of type S.|$|R
