5|$|In France, as in Italy, Spain and Portugal, organs were <b>primarily</b> <b>designed</b> to play alternatim verses {{rather than}} {{accompany}} congregational singing. The French Classical Organ, became remarkably consistent throughout France {{over the course}} of the Baroque era, more so than any other style of organ building in history, and standardized registrations developed. It was elaborately described by Dom Bédos de Celles in his treatise L'art du facteur d'orgues (The Art of Organ Building).|$|E
5|$|The Prophets, or San'Shyuum, (from {{the planet}} Janjur Qom) {{serve as the}} royal rulers of the Covenant, and were <b>primarily</b> <b>designed</b> by Shi Kai Wang and Eric Arroyo. Originally, the Prophets were built in a more unified way, with the gravity thrones they used for {{flotation}} and movement fused with the Prophet's organic structures. The characters were also designed to be feeble, yet sinister. The three Prophet Hierarchs were each individually designed.|$|E
5|$|The Westland WS-61 Sea King is a British licence-built {{version of}} the American Sikorsky S-61 {{helicopter}} of the same name, built by Westland Helicopters. The aircraft differs considerably from the American version, with Rolls-Royce Gnome engines (derived from the US General Electric T58), British-made anti-submarine warfare systems and a fully computerised flight control system. The Sea King was <b>primarily</b> <b>designed</b> for performing anti-submarine warfare (ASW) missions. A Sea King variant was adapted by Westland as troop transport known as the Commando.|$|E

5|$|Operation Winter '94 was {{the first}} in a series of {{successful}} advances made by the HV and the HVO in or near the Livanjsko field, an elongated flat-bottomed valley surrounded by hills. The region was formally controlled by the HVO, but the HV contributed a substantial force, including commanding officers. The attacks were <b>primarily</b> <b>designed</b> to draw the Army of Republika Srpska (VRS) away from the besieged city of Bihać. The secondary objective was threatening the single direct supply route between Drvar in the Bosnian Serb Republika Srpska and Knin, the capital of the Croatian Serb Republic of Serbian Krajina (RSK).|$|E
5|$|The GAL.48 was <b>primarily</b> <b>designed</b> by F.F. Crocombe (team leader) to the Air Ministry {{specification}} X.10/40, and was to {{be similar}} in design to the German DFS 230 assault glider which {{had been used in}} the Battle of the Netherlands. The first prototype of the glider, designated GAL.48 and which would receive the service name Hotspur Mk I, flew in November, only four months after General Aircraft Ltd had been given the requirement for the glider. An initial order of 400 Hotspurs was placed with General Aircraft Ltd in September by the Ministry of Aircraft Production, nearly two months before the prototype first flew.|$|E

5|$|The data {{processing}} yielded four monochrome images (at 300nm, 450nm, 606nm and 814nm), one at each wavelength. One image was designated as red (814nm), the second as green (606nm) {{and the third}} as blue (450nm), and the three images were combined to give a colour image. Because the wavelengths at which the images were taken do not correspond to the wavelengths of red, green and blue light, the colours in the final image only give an approximate representation of the actual colours of the galaxies in the image; the choice of filters for the HDF (and the majority of Hubble images) was <b>primarily</b> <b>designed</b> to maximize the scientific utility of the observations rather than to create colours corresponding to what the human eye would actually perceive.|$|E
5|$|The {{decision}} to use a straight or curved laryngoscope blade depends partly on the specific anatomical features of the airway, and partly on the personal experience and preference of the laryngoscopist. The Macintosh blade is {{the most widely used}} curved laryngoscope blade, while the Miller blade is the most popular style of straight blade. Both Miller and Macintosh laryngoscope blades are available in sizes 0 (infant) through 4 (large adult). There are many other styles of straight and curved blades, with accessories such as mirrors for enlarging the field of view and even ports for the administration of oxygen. These specialty blades are <b>primarily</b> <b>designed</b> for use by anesthetists and otolaryngologists, most commonly in the operating room.|$|E
5|$|In 1993, NSB test-ran an X2 {{train on}} the Randsfjord Line, and between 29 September and 21 December 1996, ran a unit in regular {{service on the}} Sørland Line. On 23 February 1995, NSB signed a {{contract}} to purchase 16 Class 71 trains for use on the Airport Express Train on the Gardermoen Line. The contract included two options, one for 16 trains for intercity traffic and one for 6 trains for regional traffic. The reason for using {{the same type of}} train as the Airport Express Train, was to reduce maintenance and operation costs through having a unified fleet. The options would only modify the trains slightly; they were <b>primarily</b> <b>designed</b> for the airport service and any optimization for intercity and tilting technology was secondary in the design process. The first option was taken out on 5 March 1997.|$|E

5|$|Lydford Castle {{does not}} seem to be <b>primarily</b> <b>designed</b> to have a {{military}} function, although in 1199 when King John succeeded to the throne he had the castle garrisoned and expensively equipped to prevent any potential unrest breaking out in the region. The castle lacked the usual military features of the time, such as external gatehouses, and its design seems to have been intended to evoke the authority of a traditional defensive fortification rather than to resist an actual attack. Instead, as well as helping to deal with the wider problems in 1195, the castle appears to have been built with the intention of enforcing the stannary and forest law in Devon. It is possible that the Crown originally intended that the castle took over the stannary law across the whole of Cornwall and Devon, although in practice its role extended only to governing the Devon stannaries.|$|E
