5|$|Trujillo and Sheppard {{in a paper}} {{announcing the}} {{discovery}} of several more distant objects noted a correlation between the longitude of <b>perihelion</b> and the argument of <b>perihelion</b> of these objects. Those with a longitude of <b>perihelion</b> of 0–120° have arguments of <b>perihelion</b> between 280–360°, and those with longitude of <b>perihelion</b> of 180–340° have argument of <b>perihelion</b> 0–40°. The statistical significance of this correlation was 99.99%. They suggest that the correlation {{is due to the}} orbits of these objects avoiding close approaches to Planet Nine by passing above or below its orbit. Trujillo and Sheppard also noted that the arguments of <b>perihelion</b> of ETNOs with <b>perihelion</b> less than 35 AU are opposite those with <b>perihelion</b> greater than 35 AU.|$|E
5|$|The secular {{effects of}} a distant massive planet alters this behavior, causing the longitudes of <b>perihelion</b> of anti-aligned objects to librate, or {{oscillate}} within a limited range of values, while their perihelia rise and fall. As the angle between an anti-aligned object's <b>perihelion</b> and Planet Nine's (delta longitude of <b>perihelion</b> on diagram) climbs beyond 180° Planet Nine exerts an increasingly positive torque on the object. This torque increases the object's angular momentum, causing the eccentricity of its orbit to decline (see blue curves on diagram) and its <b>perihelion</b> to rise away from Neptune's orbit. While the object's eccentricity is declining its precession rate is slowing. Once the object's precession rate becomes slower than that of Planet Nine delta longitude of <b>perihelion</b> begins to descend. After delta longitude of <b>perihelion</b> drops below 180° the object begins to feel an increasingly negative torque. This causes the object's angular momentum to decrease, and its eccentricity grows and <b>perihelion</b> falls. When the object's eccentricity is again large, its precession rate increases, causing delta longitude of <b>perihelion</b> to climb toward 180°, returning the object to its original orbit.|$|E
5|$|A sungrazing comet is a comet {{that passes}} {{extremely}} {{close to the}} Sun at <b>perihelion,</b> generally within a few million kilometres. Although small sungrazers can be completely evaporated during such a close approach to the Sun, larger sungrazers can survive many <b>perihelion</b> passages. However, the strong tidal forces they experience often lead to their fragmentation.|$|E
5|$|Over many orbits, the {{cumulative}} effect of gravitational perturbations on comets with high orbital inclinations and small <b>perihelion</b> distances is generally to reduce the <b>perihelion</b> distance to very small values. Hale–Bopp has about a 15%chance of eventually becoming a sungrazing comet through this process.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after <b>perihelion</b> {{was reached}} on 17 September, the comet transited the Sun.|$|E
5|$|The comet {{was rapidly}} {{approaching}} <b>perihelion</b> {{when it was}} first seen.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the extreme}} trans-Neptunian objects are two high <b>perihelion</b> objects: Sedna and 2012 VP113. Sedna and 2012 VP113 are distant {{detached}} objects with perihelia greater than 70 AU. Their high perihelia keep {{them at a}} sufficient distance to avoid significant gravitational perturbations from Neptune. Previous explanations for the high <b>perihelion</b> of Sedna include a close encounter with an unknown planet on a distant orbit and a distant encounter with a random star {{or a member of}} the Sun's birth cluster that passed near the Solar System.|$|E
5|$|As {{it passed}} <b>perihelion</b> on April 1, 1997 the comet {{developed}} into a spectacular sight. It shone brighter than any star in the sky except Sirius, and its dust tail stretched 40–45 degrees across the sky. The comet was visible well before the sky got fully dark each night, and while many great comets {{are very close to}} the Sun as they pass <b>perihelion,</b> comet Hale–Bopp was visible all night to northern hemisphere observers.|$|E
5|$|For {{many hours}} {{on either side}} of its <b>perihelion</b> passage, the comet was easily visible in the daytime sky next to the Sun.|$|E
5|$|Many {{hundreds}} of smaller {{members of the}} family, some only a few meters across, have been discovered since {{the launch of the}} SOHO satellite in 1995. None of these smaller comets have survived its <b>perihelion</b> passage. Larger sungrazers such as the Great Comet of 1843 and C/2011 W3 (Lovejoy) have survived their <b>perihelion</b> passage. Amateur astronomers have been successful at discovering Kreutz comets in the data available in real time via the Internet.|$|E
5|$|Some comets {{have been}} {{observed}} to break up during their <b>perihelion</b> passage, including great comets West and Ikeya–Seki. Biela's Comet was one significant example, when it broke into two pieces during its passage through the <b>perihelion</b> in 1846. These two comets were seen separately in 1852, but never again afterward. Instead, spectacular meteor showers were seen in 1872 and 1885 when the comet should have been visible. A minor meteor shower, the Andromedids, occurs annually in November, and it is caused when the Earth crosses the orbit of Biela's Comet.|$|E
5|$|Studies of {{the orbit}} of the comet showed that the Great Comet of 1882 was moving on an almost {{identical}} path to previous great comets seen in C/1843 D1 and C/1880 C1. These comets had also suddenly appeared in the morning sky and had passed extremely close to the Sun at <b>perihelion.</b> One suggestion was that all three were in fact the same comet, with an orbital period that was being drastically shortened at each <b>perihelion</b> passage. However, studies showed this to be untenable, as the orbital period of this comet is 772 ± 3 years {{and the others are}} 600–800 years.|$|E
5|$|The Halley Armada {{describes}} {{the collection of}} spacecraft missions that visited and/or made observations of Halley's Comet 1980s <b>perihelion.</b>|$|E
5|$|The axial tilt of Mars is 25.19 degrees {{relative}} to its orbital plane, {{which is similar}} to the axial tilt of Earth. As a result, Mars has seasons like Earth, though on Mars, they are nearly twice as long because its orbital period is that much longer. In the present day epoch, the orientation of the north pole of Mars is close to the star Deneb. Mars passed an aphelion in March 2010 and its <b>perihelion</b> in March 2011. The next aphelion came in February 2012 and the next <b>perihelion</b> came in January 2013.|$|E
5|$|The bending of the Laplace {{plane of}} the Solar System toward that of Planet Nine's orbit can produce the {{apparent}} clustering of the longitude of the ascending nodes and arguments of <b>perihelion</b> of the extreme TNOs. The Laplace plane defines the center about which the pole of an object's orbit precesses with time. At larger semi-major axes the angular momentum of Planet Nine causes the Laplace plane to bend toward that of its orbit. As a result, when the poles of the eTNO orbit precess about the Laplace plane, they tend to remain {{on one side of}} the ecliptic pole. For objects with small inclination relative to Planet Nine, which were found to be more stable in simulations, this off-center precession resembles a libration of the longitudes of ascending nodes with respect to the ecliptic making them appear clustered. In combination with the anti-alignment of the longitudes of <b>perihelion</b> this can also produce clustering of the arguments of <b>perihelion.</b>|$|E
5|$|The comet {{was bright}} enough to be visible next to the Sun in the daytime sky at its <b>perihelion.</b>|$|E
5|$|The group {{generally}} has an Inclination of roughly 140 degrees, a <b>perihelion</b> distance of around 0.01 AU, and a Longitude of ascending node of 340–10°.|$|E
5|$|Twain died on 21 April 1910, the day {{following}} the comet's subsequent <b>perihelion.</b> The 1985 fantasy film The Adventures of Mark Twain {{was inspired by}} the quotation.|$|E
5|$|In 2014, astronomers {{announced}} {{the discovery of}} , an object {{half the size of}} Sedna in a 4200-year orbit similar to Sedna's and a <b>perihelion</b> within Sedna's range of roughly 80AU, which led some to speculate that it offered evidence of a trans-Neptunian planet.|$|E
5|$|In modern times, Earth's <b>perihelion</b> occurs around 3 January, and its {{aphelion}} around 4 July. These dates {{change over}} time due to precession and other orbital factors, which follow cyclical patterns known as Milankovitch cycles. The changing Earth–Sun distance causes an increase of about 6.9% in solar energy reaching Earth at <b>perihelion</b> relative to aphelion. Because the Southern Hemisphere is tilted toward the Sun {{at about the same}} time that Earth reaches the closest approach to the Sun, the Southern Hemisphere receives slightly more energy from the Sun than does the northern over the course of a year. This effect is much less significant than the total energy change due to the axial tilt, and most of the excess energy is absorbed by the higher proportion of water in the Southern Hemisphere.|$|E
5|$|SDOs are {{typically}} characterized by orbits with medium and high eccentricities with a semi-major axis greater than 50AU, but their perihelia bring them within influence of Neptune. Having a <b>perihelion</b> of roughly 30AU {{is one of}} the defining characteristics of scattered objects, as it allows Neptune to exert its gravitational influence.|$|E
5|$|Since early 2016, {{seven more}} extreme trans-Neptunian objects have been {{discovered}} with orbits that have a <b>perihelion</b> greater than 30AU and a semi-major axis greater than250 AU. These are {{also included in the}} orbital diagrams and tables below.|$|E
5|$|Temperatures on {{the surface}} have been {{estimated}} to lie between about −20°C with the Sun overhead, dropping to about −190°C at the winter pole. Typical daytime and nighttime temperatures are −60°C and −130°C respectively. This estimate is for 6 May 1996, very close to <b>perihelion,</b> although details vary somewhat with the seasons.|$|E
5|$|The aphelion, or {{farthest}} {{point from}} the Sun, {{would be in}} the general direction of the constellation of Taurus, whereas the <b>perihelion,</b> the nearest point to the Sun, {{would be in the}} general direction of the southerly areas of Serpens (Caput), Ophiuchus, and Libra.|$|E
5|$|The {{apparent}} magnitude of Ariel is 14.8; {{similar to that}} of Pluto near <b>perihelion.</b> However, while Pluto can be seen through a telescope of 30cm aperture, Ariel, due to its proximity to Uranus's glare, is often not visible to telescopes of 40cm aperture.|$|E
5|$|Although Sedna {{is officially}} {{considered}} a scattered-disc object by the MPC, its discoverer Michael E. Brown {{has suggested that}} because its <b>perihelion</b> distance of 76 AU is too distant {{to be affected by}} the gravitational attraction of the outer planets it should be considered an inner-Oort-cloud object rather than a member of the scattered disc. This classification of Sedna as a detached object is accepted in recent publications.|$|E
5|$|Comet Hale–Bopp was {{observed}} intensively by astronomers during its <b>perihelion</b> passage, and several important advances in cometary science resulted from these observations. The dust production {{rate of the}} comet was very high (up to 2.0 kg/s), which may have made the inner coma optically thick. Based on {{the properties of the}} dust grains—high temperature, high albedo and strong 10μm silicate emission feature—the astronomers concluded the dust grains are smaller than observed in any other comet.|$|E
5|$|Comets {{are small}} Solar System bodies, {{typically}} {{only a few}} kilometres across, composed largely of volatile ices. They have highly eccentric orbits, generally a <b>perihelion</b> within the orbits of the inner planets and an aphelion far beyond Pluto. When a comet enters the inner Solar System, its proximity to the Sun causes its icy surface to sublimate and ionise, creating a coma: a long tail {{of gas and dust}} often visible to the naked eye.|$|E
5|$|Cory Shankman et al. {{examined}} {{the consequences of}} a distant massive perturber on the TNOs used to infer the planet's existence. They simulated clones (objects with similar orbits) of 15 objects with semi-major axis > 150 AU and <b>perihelion</b> > 30 AU under the influence of a 10 Earth-massed Planet Nine in Batygin and Brown's best fit orbit. While longitude of <b>perihelion</b> alignment of the objects with semi-major axis > 250 AU was observed in their simulations, the alignment of the arguments of <b>perihelion</b> was not. The simulations also revealed an increase in the inclinations of many objects, thereby predicting a larger reservoir of high-inclination TNOs. These objects should have been detected in existing surveys but are still unseen so far—suggesting there is a currently missing or unseen signature of Planet Nine. A previously published paper concluded that current observations are insufficient to identify this signature, however. The perihelia of many of the objects also rose and fell smoothly, inconsistent with the current absence of extreme TNOs with perihelia between 50 AU and 70 AU. Their perihelia also reached values where the objects would not be observed and, after declining, fell low enough for the objects to enter planet-crossing orbits leading to their ejection from the Solar System. These factors would require a population of Sednas significantly larger than current estimates, and inconsistent with current models of the early Solar System, to explain current observations. Based on these challenges Shankman et al. concluded that the existence of Planet Nine is unlikely and that the currently observed alignment of the existing TNOs is a temporary phenomenon that will disappear as more objects are detected.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the clustering of the perihelia and the orbital poles of distant objects, Planet Nine offers explanations for the high <b>perihelion</b> of Sedna and , for objects with orbits roughly perpendicular {{to those of the}} planets, for high inclination TNOs with semi-major axes less than 100 AU, and for the tilt of the Sun's rotation axis. The objects it dynamically controls would form a cloud centered on its semi-major axis {{with a wide range of}} inclinations.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} first {{millennium}} BC, Babylonian astronomers {{observed that the}} Sun's motion along the ecliptic is not uniform, though {{they did not know}} why; it is today known that {{this is due to the}} movement of Earth in an elliptic orbit around the Sun, with Earth moving faster when it is nearer to the Sun at <b>perihelion</b> and moving slower when it is farther away at aphelion.|$|E
5|$|It is not {{possible}} to estimate the chances of another very bright Kreutz comet arriving in the near future, but given that at least 10 have reached naked eye visibility over the last 200 years, another great comet from the Kreutz family seems almost certain to arrive at some point. Comet White–Ortiz–Bolelli in 1970 reached an apparent magnitude of 1. In December 2011, Kreutz sungrazer C/2011 W3 (Lovejoy) survived its <b>perihelion</b> passage and had an apparent magnitude of −3.|$|E
5|$|Its great {{distance}} and surprising activity indicated that comet Hale–Bopp might become very bright indeed when it reached <b>perihelion</b> in 1997. However, comet scientists were wary – comets {{can be extremely}} unpredictable, and many have large outbursts at {{great distance}} only to diminish in brightness later. Comet Kohoutek in 1973 had been touted as a 'comet of the century' and {{turned out to be}} unspectacular.|$|E
5|$|Its {{size and}} unusually bright surface make Vesta the {{brightest}} asteroid, {{and it is}} occasionally {{visible to the naked}} eye from dark skies (without light pollution). In May and June 2007, Vesta reached a peak magnitude of +5.4, the brightest since 1989. At that time, opposition and <b>perihelion</b> were only a few weeks apart. It will be brighter still at its 22 June 2018 opposition, reaching a magnitude of +5.3.|$|E
5|$|Juno rotates in a {{prograde}} direction with an axial tilt {{of approximately}} 50°. The maximum temperature on the surface, directly facing the Sun, was measured at about 293 K on October 2, 2001. Taking {{into account the}} heliocentric distance at the time, this gives an estimated maximum temperature of 301 K (+28°C) at <b>perihelion.</b>|$|E
5|$|Sedna's highly {{elliptical}} orbit means that the probability of its detection was roughly 1 in 80, which suggests that, unless its discovery was a fluke, another 40–120 Sedna-sized objects would exist within the same region. Another object, , has a similar but less extreme orbit: it has a <b>perihelion</b> of 44.3AU, an aphelion of 394 AU, and an orbital period of 3,240 years. It may {{have been affected by}} the same processes as Sedna.|$|E
