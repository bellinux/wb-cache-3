5000|$|Training {{accidents}} {{remained a}} serious problem: in 1972-73 {{the morale of}} the Khmer Air Force pilots was strained by a series of crashes involving the T-28 Trojan, the T-41 Mescalero, and the AU-24A Stallion. Confidence in the T-28 eroded after fourteen crashes were recorded during a twelve-month period, even though eight of the crashes were due to pilot error, three to enemy anti-aircraft ground fire and only three to mechanical failure. Four T-41 trainers were also lost in separate incidents during July 1972, all pilots being killed. [...] The AU-24A was beset with a long list of technical faults, which became painfully clear on August 10, 1973, after a Stallion crashed on a rocket <b>pass,</b> <b>killing</b> its crew and forced the KAF command to ground temporarily the entire mini-gunship fleet.|$|R
50|$|In {{the years}} after the {{annexation}} of the Punjab, Lumsden was largely concerned with affairs of the border tribes. In 1849, he assisted in an expedition against the Baizai, who had been refusing {{to pay tribute to}} the British. The next year, he replaced John Lawrence as the political agent in Peshawar whilst Lawrence recuperated from fever in Shimla. Later that year he was part of a force moving against Afridi tribesmen who had attacked engineers building a road through the Kohat <b>Pass</b> <b>killing</b> twelve and wounding eight. Lumsden had favoured friendly relations with the hill tribes, especially the Afridis, as he feared military occupation would be prohibitively costly in terms of lives and treasure and his views were cordially endorsed by the new military commander in Peshawar, Sir Colin Campbell. Their views however gave way to the orders of the Governor-General, Lord Dalhousie, who demanded an iron handed response.|$|R
50|$|SKS {{was founded}} in 1956 by the {{municipalities}} of Bodø, Bodin and Fauske to create a power grid from the power stations in Sulitjelma to Outer Salten where the largest population was located. The municipalities had cooperated in building the power plants, but needed a separate company to transport the electricity. In {{the end of the}} 50s SKS built the Deja station. The current structure of the company arose in 1975 with a merger of Salten Kraftlag. In the 1980s there was major work on creating a vertical integrated power company for all of Salten, and in the long term a county municipality owned company for all of Nordland. But local fluctuation and concern for every petty local job made a consolidation impossible. In 1991 the new energy law was <b>passed,</b> <b>killing</b> the process.
