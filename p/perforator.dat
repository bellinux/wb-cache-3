5|$|Flexing {{the toes}} and feet and {{extending}} on tiptoes, {{can all be}} very useful in detecting <b>perforator</b> vein incompetence. These movements unleash a muscle contraction which compresses deep veins. If a <b>perforator</b> valve is incompetent then a reflux from the deep to the superficial through the <b>perforator</b> vein will be registered.|$|E

5|$|Attention will {{be focused}} on the {{direction}} of the blood flow in both of the venous systems, and in the <b>perforator</b> veins, as well as being focused on shunt detection. A shunting of blood from the thigh veins back into the lower leg veins will give a reflux situation. The veins most often found to be incompetent are the saphenous veins and the perforators communicating with the deep veins of the thigh.|$|E

40|$|The {{internal}} capsule and basal nuclei are {{supplied by}} perforating {{branches of the}} anterior cerebral artery (ACA), Heubner's artery, middle cerebral artery (MCA), internal carotid artery (ICA) and anterior choroidal artery (AChA). Some of the mentioned <b>perforators</b> vascularize both the internal capsule and basal nuclei, while some of them also perfuse the adjacent brain structures. Dorsal part of the anterior limb, knee and posterior limb of the internal capsule are commonly supplied by lateral MCA <b>perforators.</b> The intermediate part of the anterior limb is perfused by medial MCA <b>perforators,</b> while its ventral part is nourished by ACA <b>perforators</b> and Heubner's artery. The intermediate part of the knee is supplied by medial MCA <b>perforators,</b> while its ventral partis mostly vascularized by ICA and proximal AChA <b>perforators.</b> The intermediate part of the posterior limb is perfused by medial MCA <b>perforators</b> anteriorly and the proximal AChA <b>perforators</b> posteriorly. The ventral part is supplied by AChA <b>perforators.</b> The retrolenticular and sublenticular portions of the internal capsule are mainly nourished by distal AChA <b>perforators.</b> The caudate nucleus is supplied by <b>perforators</b> of the ACA, MCA and AChA, {{as well as by}} branches of the lateral posterior choroidal artery. Most of the putamen is vascularized by MCA <b>perforators,</b> and smaller parts by ACA and AChA <b>perforators.</b> The lateral segment of the globus pallidus is perfused by MCA <b>perforators</b> and partially by Heubner's artery and ACA, while its medial segment is supplied by ICA and AChA <b>perforators.</b> The ACA <b>perforators,</b> that most often originate from the initial 5. 9 mm of the Al segment, range in number from 1 to 5 (mean, 2. 2) and in diameter between 80 urn and 710 urn (average, 295 urn). Heubner's artery, which most often arises close to the anterior communicating artery, can be singular (72. 5 %), double (23 %) or triple (4. 5 %). It varies in diameter from 190 urn to 1, 600 um (average, 750 urn) and in length between 11 mmand 36 mm (mean, 22. 4 mm). The MCA <b>perforators,</b> that most frequently originate from M 1 segment (90. 7 %) and leptomeningeal branches (62. 6 %), range in number between 2 and 13 (mean, 8. 1) and in diameter from 80 um to 1, 300 um (mean, 520 um). Many <b>perforators</b> arise as individual vessels, and some of them with common trunks (70. 8 %). Medial and lateral group of these <b>perforators</b> can be distinguished. The ICA <b>perforators,</b> which more often arise close to the AChA originating site (35. 4 %) than from the ICA bifurcation point (10. 4 %), vary in number from 1 to 5 (average, 3) and in diameter between 70 μm and 500 um (mean, 236 μm).

5|$|Normal {{blood flow}} is {{anterograde}} (going to the heart), and from superficial to deep veins via <b>perforator</b> veins. However, {{there are two}} exceptions: firstly, the great saphenous vein (GSV) collaterals, (the veins that run parallel), drain the abdominal wall and have a flow {{from top to bottom}} so that when an examiner tests the sapheno-femoral junction, a false positive diagnosis might be made; secondly, in the flow from the sole of the foot venous network around 10% drains to the dorsal venous arch of the foot, going therefore against the norm, from deep to superficial veins.|$|E
5|$|<b>Perforator</b> veins play a {{very special}} role in the venous system, {{carrying}} blood from superficial to deep veins. During the muscular systole their valves close and stop any blood flow coming from the deep to the superficial veins. When their valves become insufficient, {{they are responsible for}} a rapid deterioration in existing varicose disease and for the development of venous ulcers. Detection of insufficient perforators is important because they need to be ligatured. However, the detection of competent ones is as important because they may be used strategically in new techniques of conservative surgery, for example a minimally invasive CHIVA. The ultrasonography report will include insufficient and continent perforators, which will also be shown on venous mapping. To test these veins properly, the examiner will need to use some techniques like the Paraná maneuver, toe and foot flexion, and hyper-extension on tip toes.|$|E
5|$|The small {{saphenous vein}} (SSV), {{runs along the}} {{posterior}} aspect of the leg {{as far as the}} popliteal region, in the upper calf. Here it enters the popliteal space which is located between the two heads of the gastrocnemius muscle where it usually drains above the knee joint in the popliteal vein or a little less often in the great saphenous vein (GSV) or other deep muscular veins of the thigh. The use of ultrasonography has allowed a number of variations to be shown at this level; when no contact is made with the popliteal vein it might be seen to drain in the GSV, at a variable level; or, it may merge with the Giacomini vein and drain in the GSV at the superior 1/3 of the thigh. It can also but rarely, drain in the vein of the semimembranosus (thigh muscle) (shown below). Usually though, it connects with a <b>perforator</b> vein at its middle 1/3. To check for insufficiency, the Paraná maneuver is very useful.|$|E
40|$|Background: The DIEAP flap {{has gained}} {{popularity}} for breast reconstruction worldwide. Despite DIEAP flap arterial anatomy being well known, venous congestion {{is still an}} important complication and the literature on DIEAP flap venous anatomy is lacking. Venous drainage is less predictable and research on venous <b>perforators</b> is of increasing interest. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the anatomical distribution, diameters and relationships between arterial and venous <b>perforators</b> and their source vessels using Duplex ultrasonography, in order to evaluate the potential benefits of pre-operative evaluation of DIEAP flap venous <b>perforators.</b> Methods: Prospectively, 140 patients undergoing DIEAP flap breast reconstruction, were pre-operatively assessed using Duplex ultrasonography for location and diameter of arterial and venous <b>perforators,</b> DIEA, DIEV, and SIEV. <b>Perforators</b> were plotted laterally and inferiorly from the umbilicus.

40|$|AbstractIntroductionThe soleus {{muscle is}} a {{powerful}} plantar flexor of the ankle joint and receives its blood supply from several different sources. AimThis study was done to describe {{the distribution of the}} arterial supply of the soleus muscle. Materials and methodsThe study was carried out at the Faculty of Medicine, University of Alexandria. Forty limbs were dissected, which included specimens from both male and female cadavers. The pattern of arterial supply of the soleus muscle and the distribution of the <b>perforators</b> were studied. ResultsThe soleus muscle is supplied by <b>perforators</b> of the popliteal, posterior tibial and peroneal arteries, the posterior tibial artery gave 38. 80 % of total <b>perforators</b> while the peroneal artery gave 33. 30 % of total <b>perforators</b> and the popliteal artery gave 27. 80 % of total <b>perforators.</b> <b>Perforators</b> of popliteal artery were larger; 12. 9 ± 2. 07 cm in length and 2. 55 ± 0. 214 mm in diameter while those of the posterior tibial artery had a length of 5. 1 ± 0. 99 cm and a diameter of 1. 93 ± 0. 25 mm and <b>perforators</b> of the peroneal artery had a length of 3. 8 ± 0. 98 cm and a diameter of 1. 49 ± 1. 03 mm. ConclusionThe soleus muscle is richly supplied by many arterial pedicles and can be used safely as a free flap, hemisoleus flap or composite flap to cover defects in the lower limb...|$|R

The energy conversion and energy equivalent theories and the underwater explosion energy method {{are applied to}} investigate the perforation remnant energy. The theoretical analysis {{results indicate that the}} explosion remnant energy of the <b>perforators</b> is the main energy source causing damage of the tubing, packer and casing and the explosion process of the <b>perforators</b> with guns in the oil well can be simplified to the explosion of ordinary explosive charges in the perforation liquid. TNT equivalent and HMX equivalent of perforation remnant energy of three type <b>perforators</b> are obtained by experiments and Cole Formula.

40|$|Background: The {{lumbar region}} has been {{scarcely}} explored {{as a donor}} site for free tissue transfer or as a free flap recipient site. The lumbar integument provides a versatile prospective flap site, with a potentially well-concealed scar. Similarly, defects of this region can require recipient vessels that {{may be difficult to}} identify. Although lumbar artery <b>perforators</b> have been described, the reliability of <b>perforators</b> in this region remains questionable. Methods: An anatomical study was undertaken combining both cadaveric and in vivo analysis of the lumbar vessels. The cadaveric component comprised both dissection and angiographic studies in fresh and embalmed cadavers (36 lumbar regions in 18 cadavers), and the clinical study comprised a computed tomographic angiographic study (44 sides in 22 patients) and an operative case report. Results: <b>Perforators</b> were shown to arise from all eight lumbar arteries to enter the lumbar integument, with their size, location, and course described. Lower lumbar <b>perforators</b> were more often septocutaneous and of larger caliber. A case in which the fourth lumbar artery and concomitant vein were used as free flap recipient vessels is described, the first such reported case in the literature. Conclusions: Improving the incidence of identifying lumbar <b>perforators</b> of large caliber and with a septocutaneous course can be achieved by selecting lower lumbar vessels, or with the use of preoperative computed tomographic angiography. Computed tomographic angiography can successfully identify the location, size, and course of lumbar artery <b>perforators</b> and can aid flap design. Lumbar artery <b>perforators</b> are highly useful for both donor and recipient vessels in free flap surgery...|$|R

50|$|Artists {{working in}} the stamp art medium often employ {{fixed-line}} <b>perforators</b> {{as part of the}} creation process. Most functional and sought-after of these machines are cast-iron, pedal-operated devices manufactured beginning in the 1880s by bindery equipment makers like F.P Rosback Co. and Latham Machinery Co. Rosback also produced table-top <b>perforators,</b> but surviving models are exceedingly rare. Other methods for perforating paper to resemble stamp sheets have generally proven unsatisfactory. Such alternative methods used include using sewing machines, sewing pounces, leather punches, modified veterinary needles, and speciality scissors. Some owners of pedal-operated or motorized <b>perforators</b> sell pre-perforated paper and offer perforating services for a fee.|$|R

25|$|The LAP flap is a flap {{from the}} dorsal lumbar area {{extending}} to the lateral {{edge of the}} rectus abdominis muscle which consists of fat, skin and one paravertebral <b>perforator</b> from the lumbar vessels. The lumbar vessels travel through the erector spinae muscles or between the erector spinae muscle and quadratus lumborum muscle. Preoperatively, the perforators are located using a hand held doppler. The vessels are cut {{at the beginning of}} the vasa lumbales.|$|E
25|$|The veins are {{subdivided}} into three systems. The deep veins return approximately 85 {{percent of the}} blood and the superficial veins approximately 15 percent. A series of <b>perforator</b> veins interconnect the superficial and deep systems. In the standing posture, the veins of the leg have to handle an exceptional load as they act against gravity when they return the blood to the heart. The venous valves assist in maintaining the superficial to deep direction of the blood flow.|$|E
25|$|The SIEA flap {{design is}} more or less similar to the DIEAP flap design, however, it is perfused by {{different}} blood vessels. The superficial epigastric vessels branch off the common femoral vessels in the groin area and vascularise the ipsilateral lower hemi-abdomen. Unlike the DIEAP flap the SIEA flap is not a <b>perforator</b> flap, because the vessels do not perforate the abdominal wall musculature. Therefore, the flap can be raised without incising the anterior rectus sheath and dissecting within the rectus muscles and thus further reducing the chance of donor site morbidity.|$|E

40|$|N ipple-sparing mastectomy (NSM) with implant-based {{reconstruction}} (IBR) {{has gained}} in popularity. 1, 2 Greater than 15 % of nipple-areolar complex (NAC) loss {{is attributed to}} vascular compromise. 3 Moreover, in patients who subsequently undergo IBR, NAC necrosis can lead to chronic open wounds, infection, implant exposure, and need for explantation. 4 – 8 Blood supply of the breast stems from a deep and a superficial arterial system. The superficial system is composed of <b>perforators</b> from both lateral thoracic and internal mammary arteries. 9 According to Palm-er and Taylor, 10 the internal mammary artery (IMA) contributes significant blood supply to the NAC. IMA <b>perforators</b> are superficial and can be identi-fied using a handheld Doppler probe. 9 Previous investigations have used Doppler ultra-sound to identify major <b>perforators</b> to the NAC to increase nipple viability in reduction mammoplasty for gigantomastia. 11 However, the application of Doppler ultrasound has not been applied to NSM with IBR.
