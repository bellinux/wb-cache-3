40|$|The {{potential}} for agents, whether embodied or software, to learn by observing other agents performing procedures involving objects and actions is rich. Current research on automatic procedure learning heavily relies on action labels or video subtitles, {{even during the}} evaluation phase, which makes them infeasible in real-world scenarios. This leads to our question: can the human-consensus structure of a procedure be learned from a large set of long, unconstrained videos (e. g., instructional videos from YouTube) with only visual evidence? To answer this question, we introduce the problem of procedure segmentation [...] to <b>segment</b> a video <b>procedure</b> into category-independent <b>procedure</b> <b>segments.</b> Given that no large-scale dataset is available for this problem, we collect a large-scale procedure segmentation dataset with <b>procedure</b> <b>segments</b> temporally localized and described; we use cooking videos and name the dataset YouCook 2. We propose a segment-level recurrent network for generating <b>procedure</b> <b>segments</b> by modeling the dependencies across segments. The generated segments {{can be used as}} pre-processing for other tasks, such as dense video captioning and event parsing. We show in our experiments that the proposed model outperforms competitive baselines in procedure segmentation. Comment: AAAI 2018 Camera-ready version. See [URL] for YouCook 2 datase...|$|R

The screening of explants with stable and {{high level of}} the morphogenesis is an open problem. It is known, that free proline fluctuations correlate with processes of plant growth and development in vivo and in vitro. Sunflower mature seeds were germinated in vitro. The contents of free proline at somatic tissues with different regenerational abilities were measured.

Internal log scanning provides detailed information that can aid log processors in improving lumber recovery. However, scanner data (i. e. tomographic images) need to be analyzed prior to presentation to saw operators. Automatic labeling of computer tomography (CT) images is feasible, but no research has established labeling accuracy or demonstrated real time operation. An automated labeling scheme is {{presented in this paper}} that is both very accurate and very fast. The <b>procedure</b> <b>segments</b> and classifies each pixel in a CT image as either knot, split, bark, decay, or clear wood by using a small 3 D pixel neighborhood as input to an artificial neural network classifier.

40|$|The {{definition}} of the soma is fuzzy, {{as there is no}} clear line demarcating the soma of the labeled neurons and the origin of the dendrites and axon. Thus, the morphometric analysis of the neuronal soma is highly subjective. In this paper, we provide a mathematical definition and an automatic segmentation method to delimit the neuronal soma. We applied this method to the characterization of pyramidal cells, which are the most abundant neurons in the cerebral cortex. Since there are no benchmarks with which to compare the proposed procedure, we validated the goodness of this automatic segmentation method against manual segmentation by experts in neuroanatomy to set up a framework for comparison. We concluded that {{there were no significant differences}} between automatically and manually segmented somata, i. e., the proposed <b>procedure</b> <b>segments</b> the neurons more or less as an expert does.

Subsequently, a signalled-reinforcer procedure {{was introduced in the}} + 30 degree component, i. e., whenever the reinforcer was available for the next response, the key changed to blank white. Following this training, the original unsignalled-reinforcer condition was re-instated. Line orientation generalization tests were given at the end of signalled-reinforcer training and after the second unsignalled-reinforcer condition. The signalled-reinforcer procedure reduced response rate in the + 30 -degree component in all subjects but facilitated responding during the zero-degree component (behavioral contrast) for two of the naive subjects only. However, average generalization gradients following signalled-reinforcer training indicated peak shift in two subjects and area shift in all five subjects that completed the experiment. There was no apparent relation between contrast and peak shift or degree of area shift. The data were interpreted as supporting the notion that the signalled-reinforcer <b>procedure</b> <b>segments</b> a variable-interval schedule into extinction and fixed ratio 1 segments...|$|R
