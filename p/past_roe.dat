40|$|The recent {{development}} of Oistance Sampling techniques (OS) {{has provided a}} promising device to yield good population estimates with samples of small size (40 - 80 independent detections) with reasonable survey costs. On this subject, during the <b>past</b> <b>Roe</b> deer Meeting (Portugal) were presented interesting results suggesting that OS coupled with thermal imaging (IR) could be a suitable and costeffective monitoring methodology. We present {{the results of a}} 3 -year project devoted to compare density estimates from OS & IR with more conventional Mark Recapture (MR) estimates of an Appennines roe deer population. We worked in an open hunting estate, where a long-term study on roe deer ecology includes radio-monitoring and densities assessment since 1995. We tested the possibility to survey roe deer using a portable thermo-camera, equipped with a laser rangefinder and an electronic compass, which allows the operator to record ani mais presence (group size and number of groups) also in completely dark night and to measure their distance and angle with respect to the observer. We walked 35 transects (total effort 20. 5 km) in 3 nights, from 7 : 00 PM to 5 : 00 AM, to survey an area of 523 ha. We made 2 survey replicates each year (late winter/early spring) to compare the results with estimates of early spring survey calculated by MR methods. Night survey is thought to mitigate the problem of g(O) < 1 (which affect daylight ones when animals f 1 y away reacting to the presence of an observer) because the use of an IR camera is supposed to allow the detection of deer before being discovered. However, IR & OS survey design could be biased because observers are forced to use paths and so transect positioning may not be random with respect to ani mais distribution. We present an a posteriori evaluation of the survey design and we compare the 2 survey methods in order to assess the presence of biases in IR & OS...|$|E

50|$|The {{section of}} Milligan Street north of Roe Street {{and the small}} side-street between Murray and Wellington Streets were {{originally}} part of a separate (although intersecting) thoroughfare named Melbourne Street (after William Lamb, 2nd Viscount Melbourne). Early maps of Perth show Melbourne Street running north-east {{from the corner of}} Milligan and Murray Streets, <b>past</b> Wellington and <b>Roe</b> Streets. In 1838 Melbourne Street continued past James Street, but by 1845 Russell Square has been constructed and Melbourne Street terminated at James Street.|$|R
40|$|In {{tandem with}} To Become Two, Alex Martinis Roe's {{exhibition}} and commission at The Showroom in London, she was joined in conversation by Helena Reckitt. The discussion explored Martinis Roe's engagement with international feminist communities {{and their political}} practices through her research-based art practice. In exploring how Martinis Roe's longterm collaborative artworks aim to make virtual <b>pasts</b> actual, Martinis <b>Roe</b> and Reckitt considered the implications of being a “dutifully undutiful” feminist, who acknowledges earlier feminist efforts without being overly predetermined by them. Highlighting how Martinis Roe’s artistic medium can be considered that of human networks, the conversation explored how her art makes visible the relational conditions which engender art, theory and political movements. Martinis Roe discussed her 2016 film Our Future Network, {{which was part of}} The Showroom exhibition and which Reckitt herself took part in. Discussing the film's creation of an intergenerational feminist network, they talked about how Martinis Roe worked with collaborators from key sites (Barcelona, Berlin, London and Utrecht) to develop twenty propositions for feminist collective practices which were collectively explored during a three-day feminist gathering in Germany. Reflecting on Martinis Roe's wider body of work, the conversation touched on her use of the camera to document the discursive and haptic environments in which new feminisms emerge; her adaptation of participant observation techniques, archival research, and oral history interviews. Reflecting on Jo Freeman's comments on the problematic lack of structure in second wave feminist organising, Martinis Roe and Reckitt considered the importance of creating frameworks with which to generate new feminisms. They touched on Adriana Cavarero's account of vocal singularity to consider the role played by reciprocal narration in Martinis Roe's art. The conversation also considered how Martinis Roe's practice corresponded to - or diverged from - the feminist desire for safe space; Darwin, sexual difference and gender fluidity; genealogies of feminist new materialist thought; and tactics of alliance and solidarity-in-difference...|$|R
