40|$|<b>Pre-service</b> <b>teacher</b> {{education}} institutions {{are large and}} complex organisations that are notoriously difficult to change. One factor is that many change efforts focus largely on individual <b>pre-service</b> <b>teacher</b> educators altering their practice. We report here on our experience using a model for effecting change, which views <b>pre-service</b> <b>teacher</b> {{education institutions}} and educators {{as a part of}} a much broader system. We identified numerous possibilities for, and constraints on, embedding change, but focus only on two in this article: participants’ knowledge of change strategies and their leadership capacities. As a result of our study findings and researcher reflections, we argue that being a leader in an academic area within <b>pre-service</b> <b>teacher</b> education does not equate to leadership knowledge or skills to initiate and enact systems-wide change. Furthermore, such leadership capacities must be explicitly developed if education for sustainability is to become embedded in <b>pre-service</b> <b>teacher</b> education.

40|$|There {{is little}} {{conjecture}} that quality teaching {{is essential to}} student achievement and well-being. Whilst {{much has been written}} about the importance of quality teaching, including the link to <b>pre-service</b> <b>teacher</b> education, to date there has been little investigation into specific pedagogical practices that can enhance quality teaching dimensions within a <b>pre-service</b> <b>teacher</b> education programme. This paper reports on a small-scale qualitative research study, undertaken in an Australian university, which linked the fields of quality teaching, <b>pre-service</b> <b>teacher</b> education and values education. The study followed the journey of five <b>pre-service</b> <b>teacher</b> education students as they undertook their second field experience unit where the focus was centred on the values-based pedagogy of Philosophy in the Classroom. The research findings, collected via interviews, demonstrated that an explicit values-based pedagogy can have a positive impact on the development of quality teaching dimensions. This new knowledge has potential for further research into examining the ways quality teaching dimensions are gained and practised by <b>pre-service</b> <b>teacher</b> education students and these findings and recommendations are discussed in this paper...|$|R

40|$|<b>Pre-service</b> <b>teacher</b> {{education}} is a crucial component of the lifelong process of the professional development of teachers as it equips prospective teachers with the necessary and sufficient competencies to design meaningful and authentic learning environments that engage students in the learning process. If done well, it enhances the quality and improves upon the retention of teachers in the profession. This book {{is important because it}} attempts to deconstruct the nature and describe the practice of current pre-service courses and programs in the Asia-Pacific region, examine new paradigms of <b>pre-service</b> <b>teacher</b> education and their implications for practice, and explore emerging innovative practices.

Findings show a paucity of required standalone ethics subjects in the <b>pre-service</b> <b>teacher</b> training programs despite recent accreditation requirements by AITSL. When analysed by program type, the prevalence of an ethics related subject requirement in <b>pre-service</b> <b>teacher</b> programs revealed a concerning trend; post graduate programs, as a general rule, had a much lower prevalence of a mandatory ethics-related subject, including those subjects which are traditionally used as vehicles for embedding ethics, such as the Foundations of Education.

40|$|This paper uses Mead’s {{theory of}} {{emergence}} {{to examine the}} theory-practice gap in <b>pre-service</b> <b>teacher</b> education.

An interpretation of the data using Mead’s theory of emergence demonstrates that role taking and self-regulated behaviour inhibit the trainee teacher from exercising the power of agency to implement theory learned at university into practice in the classroom. Thus, Mead’s theory of emergence explains the obduracy of the gap between theory and practice in teacher education...|$|R
40|$|High {{quality of}} {{education}} is, in large part, the consequence of effective teachers. Teacher effectiveness is an important topic {{in the field of}} educational research. Several studies have indicated a large range of activities teachers can undertake to improve their students’ outcomes. Since education is a good start to learn about the job, a number of scholars state that teacher education programs have a major influence on teacher quality. Not only the skills of a beginning teacher, also his/ her professional development later in their career is influenced by the <b>pre-service</b> <b>teacher</b> education program. However, {{little is known about the}} contribution <b>pre-service</b> <b>teacher</b> education programs make to teacher effectiveness. The aim of this study is to provide insights into specific features of <b>pre-service</b> <b>teacher</b> education programs that significantly contribute to effective teaching once the students start their career as a teacher. Findings are reported from a study among 304 beginning teachers at secondary schools who completed their <b>pre-service</b> <b>teacher</b> education programs at 6 different universities in The Netherlands. A Monte Carlo based permutation test was performed to estimate the effects of differences between <b>pre-service</b> <b>teacher</b> education programs on several indicators of effective teaching.

The Decade of Education for Sustainable Development (2005 - 2014) reiterates the importance of reorienting teacher education toward sustainability. This study gauges whether, midway through the Decade- this objective is being met by Canadian <b>pre-service</b> <b>teacher</b> education programs. Building on the 1977 - 78 study by John Towler and a follow-up 1996 study conducted by Emily Lin on this topic, a questionnaire was distributed in 2009 to all <b>pre-service</b> <b>teacher</b> education institutions across Canada. The survey findings reveal that, for three decades, the number of Canadian <b>pre-service</b> <b>teacher</b> education institutions offering EE courses has remained low. The report outlines key obstacles to the integration of EE into <b>pre-service</b> <b>teacher</b> education programs in Canada and suggests policy solutions. It argues that reorienting teacher education toward sustainability should be a policy priority not only within teacher-education institutions, but at federal, provincial, and municipal levels of government and within school boards and individual schools...|$|R
