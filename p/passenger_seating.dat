5|$|The first 747-100s {{were built}} with six upper deck windows (three per side) to {{accommodate}} upstairs lounge areas. Later, as airlines {{began to use}} the upper deck for premium <b>passenger</b> <b>seating</b> instead of lounge space, Boeing offered a ten-window upper deck as an option. Some early -100s were retrofitted with the new configuration. The -100 was equipped with Pratt & Whitney JT9D-3A engines. No freighter version of this model was developed, but many 747-100s were converted into freighters. A total of 167 747-100s were built.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{the active}} {{suspension}} {{control of a}} vehicle model that has five degrees of freedom with a <b>passenger</b> <b>seat</b> using a fuzzy logic controller is studied. Three cases {{are taken into account}} as different control applications. In the first case, the vehicle model having passive suspensions with an active <b>passenger</b> <b>seat</b> is controlled. In the second case, active suspensions with passive <b>passenger</b> <b>seat</b> combination are controlled. In the third case, both the <b>passenger</b> <b>seat</b> and suspensions have active controllers. Vibrations of the <b>passenger</b> <b>seat</b> in the three cases due to road bump input are simulated. At the end of the study, the results are compared in order to select the combination that supplies the best ride comfort...|$|R
2500|$|The {{configuration}} of driver and <b>passenger</b> <b>seats</b> varies. Generally the driver {{sits in front}} of the passengers to pedal the rickshaw. There are some designs, though, where the cyclist driver sits behind the passengers. In many Asian countries, like India and China, the <b>passenger</b> <b>seat</b> is located behind the driver, while in Indonesia, Malaysia and Vietnam the driver sits behind the <b>passenger</b> <b>seat.</b> [...] In the Philippines, the <b>passenger</b> <b>seats</b> are usually located beside the driver in a side car. Similarly, in the trishaw in Singapore and the sai kaa in Burma the passengers sit alongside the driver.|$|R
25|$|As in the {{previous}} generation, six <b>passenger</b> <b>seating</b> with a front bench seat and column shifter was optional. Cloth seating was standard on base LX with leather seating optional. Leather was standard on upscale LXi and later Limited models.|$|E
25|$|In both {{arrangements}} carry-on baggage is stowed {{on a shelf}} {{above the}} <b>passenger</b> <b>seating</b> area. The opening into the cars is usually located {{at both ends of}} the carriage, often into a small hallway - which in railway parlance is termed a vestibule.|$|E
25|$|The {{standard}} units contained <b>passenger</b> <b>seating</b> only, {{and formed}} {{the backbone of}} the new fleet. 111 units were built in several batches, initially numbered in the range 7101-7211. Units 7101-7104 were the prototype units, and were followed by 'Phase 1' units (7105-7153) and subsequently 'Phase 2' units (7154-7211).|$|E
5000|$|DVD-based GPS {{navigation}} {{was also}} introduced, {{as well as}} an [...] "Ottoman" [...] foot rest for the rear <b>passenger</b> <b>seats.</b> This was achieved by enabling part of the seat cushion of the front <b>passenger</b> <b>seat</b> back to tilt rearward towards the rear <b>seat</b> <b>passengers.</b>|$|R

50|$|The {{number of}} flight attendants {{required}} on flights are mandated by international safety regulations. For planes {{with up to}} 19 <b>passenger</b> <b>seats,</b> no flight attendant is needed. For larger planes, one flight attendant per 50 <b>passenger</b> <b>seats</b> is needed.|$|R
25|$|The fare {{structure}} of the Chennai MRTS is integrated {{with that of the}} Chennai Suburban Railway, as both are operated by the Southern Railways. Unlike most rapid transit systems, and like the Chennai Suburban Railway, the Chennai MRTS maintains first-class <b>passenger</b> <b>seating</b> and does not have air-conditioned coaches. First class travel is only available aboard 9-car trains.|$|E
25|$|By 1909 it was {{determined}} that improvements needed to be made to the fleet. Since the design of the Composites was heavily influenced by both elevated equipment and railroad coaches of the time, the cars featured only two doors at the extreme ends of the subway car. It {{was determined}} that adding a center door for improved passenger flow would be a good idea. This required removing the transverse seats which faced each other {{in the center of the}} car. After the modification, <b>passenger</b> <b>seating</b> would be in the longitudinal direction (along the sides of the car) only. This created more room for standees. This modification was completed on the cars by 1912.|$|E
25|$|Terminal B, {{which was}} {{designed}} by John Carl Warnecke & Associates and Desmond & Lord, Inc., opened in 1974. Pier B was completed for US Airways in 1974 and Pier A for American Airlines in 1975. The terminal remained largely unchanged until US Airways expanded its operations at Logan Airport in 1979 and improvements designed by HNTB were constructed in 1980. From 1980 until 2000, numerous small projects including <b>passenger</b> <b>seating</b> area improvements, concessions expansions and passenger lounges were completed at both piers. American's facilities were renovated in 1995 and redesigned by Gresham, Smith & Partners, and US Airways' facilities were renovated in 1998 and 2000, and redesigned by URS Corporation with Turner Construction serving as the construction manager.|$|E

25|$|ART {{technology}} {{was selected for}} the AirTrain JFK project, which is widely considered a great success in spite of predictions to the contrary. After winning the SkyTrain Millennium Line contract in Vancouver, Bombardier further improved the design by introducing an articulating section between adjacent cars, replacing the coupling and doors of the older Mark I design. The articulation allows passengers to move freely between the cars, as well as adding more internal space for <b>passenger</b> <b>seating.</b> These versions of the Mark II design won several more contracts, and are currently operating on the Kelana Jaya Line in Kuala Lumpur, the Airport Express, Beijing Subway in China (in four-car trains), and the YongIn EverLine near Seoul in South Korea. When Bombardier started marketing ART {{as part of its}} Bombardier Innovia family of automated transit systems, the {{technology was}} rebranded as the Innovia ART 100 for the Mark I and Innovia ART 200 for the Mark II.|$|E
500|$|The Stadler KISS {{double-decker}} EMU that Caltrain ordered will be {{compliant with}} the FRA alternative Tier-I crash-worthiness standard. Under the alternative standard, {{it will have}} Crash Energy Management (CEM) features that allow parts of the EMU to collapse whilst keeping the <b>passenger</b> <b>seating</b> area intact {{in the event of}} collision, instead of relying on pure structural strength as in the traditional Tier-I standard. The implementation of the alternative Tier-I standard results in a lighter train that will save energy and track maintenance cost. Coupled with the positive train control system that is being installed on the Caltrain line, Caltrain KISS trains will be allowed to operate in mixed traffic with heavier trains, such as Amtrak passenger trains and Union Pacific freight trains, instead of the temporal separation required in the 2009 waiver.|$|E

2500|$|The {{main cabin}} of the Super Puma, which is {{accessed}} via two sliding plug doors, used a reconfigurable floor arrangement, various <b>passenger</b> <b>seating</b> or cargo configurations can be adopted, including specialised configurations for medical operators. According to Airbus Helicopters, {{in addition to}} the two pilots, the short-fuselage AS332 can accommodate up to 15 passengers while the stretched-fuselage AS332 increases this to 20 passengers in a comfortable configuration. Soundproof upholstery is installed, as is separately-adjustable heating and ventilation systems. Along with the doors, 12 windows around the main cabin area are [...] for emergency exits. The lower fuselage can also be fitted with floatation gear. A hatch in the floor to access the cargo sling pole is present in the cabin, as is individual stowage space for airborne equipment.|$|E

2500|$|The 1934 to 1936 Chrysler Imperial {{ushered in}} the 'Airflow' design, {{reflecting}} an interest in streamlining. The car was marketed with the slogan [...] "The car of tomorrow is here today." [...] It featured eight <b>passenger</b> <b>seating</b> and again an eight-cylinder engine. This was the first car to be designed in a wind tunnel. Initial tests indicated that the standard car of the 1920s worked best in the wind-tunnel when pointed backwards with the curved rear deck facing forward. This led to a rethinking of the fundamental design of Chrysler's line of cars. The Airflow was an exceptionally modern and advanced car, and an unparalleled engineering success. Both engine and passenger compartment were moved forward, giving better balance, ride and roadability. An early form of unibody construction was employed, making them extremely strong. This {{was one of the}} first vehicles with fender skirts.|$|E
2500|$|The larger-winged C-2 was {{delivered}} to the Fairfield depot, where it underwent further modifications, installing Hegenberger's instrument panels, other navigation and radio equipment, [...] and auxiliary fuel tanks to bring its fuel capacity to approximately 1,100 gallons (4,164 liters). Unnecessary equipment, including the <b>passenger</b> <b>seating,</b> was removed to save weight. A passageway to the cockpit was created {{over the top of}} the forward auxiliary fuel tank to allow Hegenberger to periodically relieve Maitland at the controls. A team of aviation experts was assembled to oversee the modifications that included Jones, Lester A. Hendricks (radio engineer and Assistant Chief of the Materials Laboratory, McCook Field), Fred Herman (aeronautical engineer), Victor E. Showalter (navigation engineer), radio engineers Ford Studebaker and Clayton C. Shangraw (who was also a Reserve officer), and James Rivers, an aircraft mechanic and foreman. Sometime during the modification process the C-2 also picked up a nickname: Bird of Paradise.|$|E
2500|$|In May 2011 Toyota {{introduced}} the Prius α (alpha) in Japan, {{which is available}} in a five-seat, two-row model and a seven-seat, three-row model, the latter's third row enabled by a space-saving lithium-ion drive battery in the center console.
