5|$|Football {{for women}} ranks between the 5th and 10th most popular {{sport in the}} country, though its <b>popularity</b> <b>is</b> increasing. Space to play sport is an issue facing all sports in the country. Between 2000 and 2006, there were no {{registered}} female football players in the country, {{and none of the}} 65 football clubs in the country were open to women.|$|E
5|$|Since his record-breaking win at the 1997 Masters, golf's {{increased}} <b>popularity</b> <b>is</b> commonly {{attributed to}} Woods' presence. He is credited by some sources for dramatically increasing prize money in golf, generating interest in new PGA tournament audiences, and for drawing the largest TV ratings in golf history.|$|E
5|$|According to {{statistics}} released by The Kennel Club, Cavaliers were the sixth most popular {{dog in the}} United Kingdom in 2007 with 11,422 registrations in a single year. Labrador Retrievers were the most popular with 45,079 registrations in that year. Their <b>popularity</b> <b>is</b> {{on the rise in}} America; in 1998 they were the 56th most popular breed but in both 2007 and 2008 they were the 25th most popular. They ranked higher in some individual US cities in the 2008 statistics, being eighth in both Nashville and Minneapolis-St.Paul, seventh in Boston, Atlanta and Washington D.C., and sixth in both New York City and San Francisco. The breed's popularity has continued to grow, ranking in 18th place in 2013.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examined}} 241 early adolescents' implicit and explicit associations with popularity. The peer status and gender {{of both the}} targets and the perceivers were considered. Explicit associations with <b>popularity</b> <b>were</b> assessed with sociometric methods. Implicit associations with <b>popularity</b> <b>were</b> assessed with an approach-avoidance task (AAT). Explicit evaluations of <b>popularity</b> <b>were</b> positive, but implicit associations were negative: Avoidance reactions to popular peers were faster than approach reactions. Interactions with {{the status of the}} perceiver indicated that unpopular participants had stronger negative implicit reactions to popular girls than did popular participants. This study demonstrated a negative reaction to <b>popularity</b> that cannot <b>be</b> revealed with explicit methods. The study of implicit processes with methods such as the AAT is a new and important direction for peer relations research...|$|R
5|$|Cagebirds such as canaries, budgerigars, cockatoos, lovebirds, quails, finches, and parrots {{are popular}} pets, whether for their song, their behaviour, their {{colourful}} plumage, or {{their ability to}} mimic speech. Among reasons for their <b>popularity</b> <b>is</b> {{that they can be}} kept in homes too small or otherwise unsuitable for dogs or cats. The cagebird trade {{in some parts of the}} world threatens certain species with extinction, when birds are illegally captured in the wild. For example, in Indonesia, at least 13 species are close to extinction including the Indonesian national bird, the Javan hawk-eagle, while five subspecies including the scarlet-breasted lorikeet may have become extinct in the wild.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, the team's six home matches had {{an average}} {{attendance}} of 22,753. In a survey of German football fans, 65percent of the male and 62percent of the female respondents said {{they were interested in}} women's football. However, this <b>popularity</b> <b>is</b> mostly limited to international matches. Although the number of spectators in the women's Bundesliga has more than doubled since 2003, the average attendance in the 2007–08 season (887) was still less than three percent of that of the men's Bundesliga (38,612).|$|E
5|$|Rodin {{restored}} {{an ancient}} role of sculpture– {{to capture the}} physical and intellectual force of the human subject– and he freed sculpture from the repetition of traditional patterns, providing the foundation for greater experimentation in the 20th century. His <b>popularity</b> <b>is</b> ascribed to his emotion-laden representations of ordinary men and women– to his ability to find the beauty and pathos in the human animal. His most popular works, such as The Kiss and The Thinker, are widely used outside the fine arts as symbols of human emotion and character. To honor Rodin's artistic legacy, the Google search engine homepage displayed a Google Doodle featuring The Thinker to celebrate his 172nd birthday on 12 November 2012.|$|E

5|$|The bronze {{is officially}} named Boy with a Turtle but {{is known to}} locals as Turtle Boy. Turtle Boy has become an {{unofficial}} mascot for Worcester, much {{in the same way}} the Manneken Pis is for Brussels. The Burnside Fountain's <b>popularity</b> <b>is</b> derived mostly from viewers' incorrect interpretation of the statue. Over its 100-year existence, it has been referenced in stories and songs, as well as having a music contest and a microbrew named after it.|$|E
5|$|Williams' <b>popularity</b> <b>is</b> {{said to be}} {{unmatched}} in Canadian political history; {{his high}} approval ratings lasted right up until his retirement. Although Williams' premiership was considered quite controversial in Canada at large, except for {{his first year in}} office, his own provincial approval ratings and those of his government have been consistently in the seventy to eighty percent range {{for the majority of the}} time he was in office. According to polling organisation Corporate Research Associates (CRA), Williams remains by far the most popular provincial or federal leader in the country.|$|E
5|$|After {{being thrown}} out of the theater by the manager, the gang shoplift from the Kwik-E-Mart, throw rocks at the Jebediah Springfield statue, and watch clouds. Bart remarks that one cloud resembles Jebediah Springfield, but without a head. His new friends remark that they wish someone would decapitate the statue, saying it would be funny to see the town so upset. When Bart disagrees, the bullies make fun of him. Bart is {{conflicted}} and asks Homer whether it is okay to compromise one's beliefs to be popular. Homer tells Bart that <b>popularity</b> <b>is</b> {{the most important thing in}} the world, as long as Bart is not talking about killing someone. That night, Bart sneaks out of the house and decapitates the statue.|$|E

5|$|Gulf Oil {{was most}} synonymous for its {{association}} with auto racing, as it famously sponsored the John Wyer Automotive team in the 1960s and early '70s. The signature light blue and orange color scheme associated with its Ford GT40 and Porsche 917 {{is one of the}} most famous corporate racing colors and has been replicated by other racing teams sponsored by Gulf. Much of its <b>popularity</b> <b>is</b> attributed to the fact that in the 1971 film Le Mans, Steve McQueen's character, Michael Delaney, drives for the Gulf team. As a result of McQueen's increasing popularity following his death and the increasing popularity of the Heuer Monaco which he wore in the film, TAG Heuer released a limited edition of the watch with the Gulf logo and trademark color scheme. In the same era, Gulf Oil also sponsored Team McLaren during the Bruce McLaren days, which used a papaya orange color scheme with Gulf blue for lettering.|$|E
5|$|If {{the player}} wishes {{to take over}} a {{territory}} through diplomatic means, they must initiate dialogue with the local leader. If the player has a high enough popularity, the local leader may invite them to a sporting event, such as elephant race or a game hunting session, which will give the player an opportunity to unite that territory under their faction. If the player's <b>popularity</b> <b>is</b> not high enough, they may hold a Durbar festival in an attempt to impress the local leaders. If diplomacy fails, the player has the option to invade any territory by force. Soldiers can be hired through payments of gold; however, if the player does not have a sufficient amount of gold {{at the end of the}} turn, a rebellion may start. Rebellions will sometimes initiate lethal encounters with assassins, in which the player-character must defend themselves through sword combat. Additionally, the player can bring assassins to their side by successfully launching an attack on their temple. The game will end once either all of the territories are united, or if the player-character is assassinated.|$|E
5|$|Monroe's {{enduring}} <b>popularity</b> <b>is</b> {{linked to}} her conflicted public image. On the one hand, she remains a sex symbol, beauty icon {{and one of}} the most famous stars of classical Hollywood cinema. On the other, she is also remembered for her troubled private life, unstable childhood, struggle for professional respect, and her death and the conspiracy theories surrounding it. She has been written about by scholars and journalists interested in gender and feminism, such as Gloria Steinem, Jacqueline Rose, Molly Haskell, Sarah Churchwell, and Lois Banner. Some, such as Steinem, have viewed her as a victim of the studio system. Others, such as Haskell, Rose, and Churchwell, have instead stressed Monroe's proactive role in her career and her participation in the creation of her public persona.|$|E

5|$|The Historian was {{the first}} debut novel to land at number one on The New York Times bestseller list in its first week on sale, and as of 2005 was the fastest-selling {{hardback}} debut novel in U.S. history. The book sold more copies on its first day in print than The Da Vinci Code– 70,000 copies were sold {{in the first week}} alone. As of the middle of August 2005, the novel had already sold 915,000 copies in the U.S. and had gone through six printings. (For comparison, according to Publishers Weekly, only ten fiction books sold more than 800,000 hardcover copies in the US in 2004.) Little, Brown and Company also released an edition of Dracula in September 2005 with an introduction by Kostova, thinking her readers would want to delve into the original novel after reading hers. Kostova {{is one of the few}} female bestselling authors, but her <b>popularity</b> <b>is</b> unusual because it is founded on a literary novel.|$|E
5|$|The {{national}} football association, the Fédération Togolaise de Football, {{was founded in}} 1960 and became affiliated with FIFA in 1964. The organisation has fifteen staff members focusing on women's football. Football is the fourth-most-popular women's sport in Togo, trailing basketball, handball and volleyball. Football's <b>popularity</b> <b>is</b> growing, however. The country had 380 registered players in 2006, up from 180 in 2000. Women's football was first organised {{in the country in}} 2000. By 2006, there were 105 football clubs in Togo, 11 of which were for women only. A national women's competition was created by 2006 and was still operating in 2009. While there are no school, university or regional competitions for women's football, there was an active under-17 women's league in 2009. In 2010, a women's football competition involving 50 women's teams was organised by the German embassy, which provided teams with football kits and footballs.|$|E
5|$|Turkish cuisine is {{regarded}} as one of the most prominent in the world, its <b>popularity</b> <b>is</b> largely owed to the cultural influences of the Ottoman Empire and partly because of its major tourism industry. It is largely the heritage of Ottoman cuisine, which can be described as a fusion and refinement of Central Asian, Caucasian, Middle Eastern, Mediterranean and Balkan cuisines. The country's position between the East and the Mediterranean Sea helped the Turks gain complete control of major trade routes, and an ideal environment allowed plants and animals to flourish. Turkish cuisine was well established by the mid-1400s, the beginning of the Ottoman Empire's six hundred-year reign. Yogurt salads, fish in olive oil, and stuffed and wrapped vegetables became Turkish staples. The empire, eventually spanning from Austria to northern Africa, used its land and water routes to import exotic ingredients from all over the world. By the end of the 16th century, the Ottoman court housed over 1,400 live-in cooks and passed laws regulating the freshness of food. Since the fall of the empire in World War I (1914–1918) and the establishment of the Turkish Republic in 1923, foreign food such as French hollandaise sauce and western fast food have made their way into the modern Turkish diet.|$|E
