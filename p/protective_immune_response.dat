25|$|A {{controversy}} has arisen, in part, over concern {{due to the}} role of human embryonic cell lines and vaccine development. Unlike bacteria or fungi, viruses cannot reproduce autonomously and require a living organism host in order to replicate. The ability of the virus to cause infection usually depends on the host with whom its cells have adapted to over generations of replication. In other words, a virus can lead to a more severe infection in certain organisms versus others. To create a vaccine that is safe for individuals while having the ability to induce a <b>protective</b> <b>immune</b> <b>response</b> necessitates choosing an appropriate cell line to grow a virus.|$|E
500|$|Not all virus infections {{produce a}} <b>protective</b> <b>immune</b> <b>response</b> in this way. HIV evades {{the immune system}} by {{constantly}} changing the amino acid sequence of the proteins {{on the surface of}} the virion. This is known as [...] "escape mutation" [...] as the viral epitopes escape recognition by the host immune response. These persistent viruses evade immune control by sequestration, blockade of antigen presentation, cytokine resistance, evasion of natural killer cell activities, escape from apoptosis, and antigenic shift. Other viruses, called neurotropic viruses, are disseminated by neural spread where the immune system may be unable to reach them.|$|E

40|$|AbstractPrevious vaccine {{efforts with}} Ebola virus Zaire (EBOV-Z) {{emphasized}} the potential <b>protective</b> efficacies of <b>immune</b> <b>responses</b> {{to the surface}} glycoprotein and the nucleoprotein. To determine whether the VP 24, VP 30, VP 35, and VP 40 proteins are also capable of eliciting <b>protective</b> <b>immune</b> <b>responses,</b> these genes were expressed from alphavirus replicons and used to vaccinate BALB/c and C 57 BL/ 6 mice. Although all of the VP proteins were capable of inducing <b>protective</b> <b>immune</b> <b>responses,</b> no single VP protein protected both strains of mice tested. VP 24, VP 30, and VP 40 induced <b>protective</b> <b>immune</b> <b>responses</b> in BALB/c mice, whereas C 57 BL/ 6 mice survived challenge only after vaccination with VP 35. Passive transfer of immune sera to the VP proteins did not protect unvaccinated mice from lethal disease.

Dectin- 3 (also known as MCL, Clecsf 8, or Clec 4 d) is a myeloid cell-specific CLR that recognizes mycobacterial trehalose 6, 6 '-dimycolate (TDM) as well as α-mannans present in the cell wall of fungal pathogens. To date, a potential role for Dectin- 3 in the mediation of <b>protective</b> <b>immune</b> <b>responses</b> against C. neoformans has yet to be determined. Consequently, we evaluated the impact of Dectin- 3 deficiency on the development of <b>protective</b> <b>immune</b> <b>responses</b> against C. neoformans using an experimental murine model of pulmonary cryptococcosis. Dectin- 3 deficiency did not lead to increased susceptibility of mice to experimental pulmonary C. neoformans infection. Also, no significant differences in pulmonary leukocyte recruitment and cytokine production were observed in Dectin- 3 deficient mice compared to wild type infected mice. In addition, we observed no differences in uptake and anti-cryptococcal activity of Dectin- 3 deficient dendritic cells and macrophages. Altogether, our studies show that Dectin- 3 is dispensable for mediating <b>protective</b> <b>immune</b> <b>responses</b> against pulmonary C. neoformans infection...|$|R

LDV infection showed higher expression levels of the interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) mRNA in lymph nodes compared with control mice before N. brasiliensis infection. In addition, the IgG 2 a production in LDV-infected mice was higher than that in control mice before and after N. brasiliensis infection.

5000|$|The {{fact that}} NS1 is {{involved}} in the pathogenicity of influenza A viruses makes it a good target to attenuate these viruses.
