5|$|For {{many years}} the dodo and the Rodrigues {{solitaire}} were <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> {{a family of}} their own, the Raphidae (formerly Dididae), because their exact relationships with other pigeons were unresolved. Each was also <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> a monotypic family (Raphidae and Pezophapidae, respectively), as {{it was thought that}} they had evolved their similarities independently. Osteological and DNA analysis has since led to the dissolution of the family Raphidae, and the dodo and solitaire are now <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> their own subfamily, Raphinae, within the family Columbidae.|$|E

5|$|The brolga was {{formerly}} <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> the genus Grus but a molecular phylogenetic {{study published in}} 2010 found that the genus, as then defined, was polyphyletic.

5|$|The {{classification}} of lemurs within the suborder Strepsirrhini is equally controversial, although {{most experts agree}} on the same phylogenetic tree. In one taxonomy, the infraorder Lemuriformes contains all living strepsirrhines in two superfamilies, Lemuroidea for all lemurs and Lorisoidea for the lorisoids (lorisids and galagos). Alternatively, the lorisoids are sometimes <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> their own infraorder, Lorisiformes, separate from the lemurs. In another taxonomy published by Colin Groves, the aye-aye was <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> its own infraorder, Chiromyiformes, {{while the rest of}} the lemurs were <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> Lemuriformes and the lorisoids in Lorisiformes.|$|E
