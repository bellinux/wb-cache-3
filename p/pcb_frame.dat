40|$|During the TASCA {{commissioning}} phase competitive {{tests of}} {{two types of}} focal plane detectors for TASCA – a Position Sensitive Silicon Stripe Detector (PSSSD) and a Double Sided Silicon Strip Detector (DSSSD) - have been performed. The DSSSD {{proved to be more}} reliable and more sensitive for the detection of decay chains due to the high granularity of the DSSSD; moreover the position resolution of the DSSSD is independent of implantation position and deposited energy [1, 2]. The new TASCA focal plane detector setup consists of a Multi Wire Proportional Counter (MWPC) and a Focal Plane Detector Box (FPDB). The implantation detector of the FPDB consists of two side-by-side mounted 300 µm-thick DSSSDs with an active size of 72 x 48 mm 2 each mounted on a <b>PCB</b> <b>frame.</b> Eight 500 µm-thick Single Sided Silicon Strip Detector...|$|E
40|$|Electronic units form a {{considerable}} {{part of the}} spacecraft bus mass budget, and a significant mass saving could be made by improving their mechanical design. Attention is focussed on the analysis of typical enclosures for electronics, and the anti vibration devices for the Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs) currently used within the enclosures. A crucial step to improve the equipment design is the accurate prediction of the vibration response of the electronics (i. e. populated PCBs), to the vibration environment experienced during launch. FE models of <b>PCBs</b> and Anti-Vibration <b>Frames</b> are presented and compared with the results obtained during random vibration test...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, the {{conventional}} design of an enclosure for electronic equipment for space application is reviewed and an alternative {{type of construction}} is proposed. The alternative design {{is based on the}} use of carbon fibre reinforced plastic (CFR P) sandwich panels for the construction of the enclosure, and the substitution of the printed circuit board (<b>PCB)</b> antivibration <b>frames</b> (AVFs) with antivibration rods (AVR s). To put this work into context, the requirements applicable to the structural design of this type of unit are briefly reviewed. Standard structural analyses have been performed on {{the conventional}} enclosure and then repeated for the proposed configuration, in order to demonstrate its compliance with the fundamental mechanical requirements. The issues concerning the radiation protection offered by the enclosure are discussed, and some solutions to this potential problem are briefly presented. The work demonstrates the possibility of achieving a saving of about 20 per cent on the overall mass of the unit. Finally, the cost of the proposed enclosure is assessed and compared with the conventional design for various missions...|$|R
40|$|The LION Navigator, as a {{standard}} product line of Airbus Defence and Space, has started a design for manufacturing initiative for switched mode power supplies in the year 2010. An analysis of the overall production effort of power supplies reveals that a high proportion is related to hand soldering of through-hole parts, integration of the <b>PCB</b> into the <b>frame</b> and conventional magnetics which are manufactured with low automatization. A concept study was originated to evaluate the technical prospects for an improved design for manufacturing strategy. The technical approach is related to substitution of remaining through-hole parts by SMD devices if it is economic, to cool Power-SMDs via PCB to structure and, last but not least, to replace conventional magnetics with planar ones, as {{main part of the}} study. The windings of planar magnetics are integrated into the PCB with a highly automated process. They provide advantages due to good cooling capability and a low component height but advanced calculation methods are necessary to succeed in the design. As a follow up to the study the development of the power converter for the LION Navigator was started in order to detail the hardware related to an improved design for manufacturing...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In an {{experiment}} at RIKEN, radioactive ions were {{implanted in the}} SIMBA silicon detector array and the β particles from the subsequent decay detected. However, as SIMBA is not capable of complete calorimetry, {{it is not possible}} to extract Qβ values directly from the data. Geant 4 simulations have been used to determine the response of SIMBA to a given β-emission spectrum. By simulating with different β spectra and calculating the detector response to each spectrum, it is possible to compare with experiment and deduce the Qβ values. The technique is validated using two nuclei, for which the expected β spectrum is known from the literature. 1 The experiment The N = Z nucleus 94 Ag was among those, in the 100 Sn region, studied via projectile fragmentation of a 345 MeV/nucleon 124 Xe beam on a 9 Be target using the EU-RICA array [1] at RIKEN. The nuclei of interest were separated by BigRIPS [2] and implanted in the Silicon IM-plantation detector and Beta Absorber (SIMBA) array [3] (see fig. 1). The coincident γ rays were detected by 12 Euroball clusters [4]. Several nuclei could be studied si-multaneously and then selected by software gates. More details about the experiment can be found in [5]. Figure 1. The SIMBA array. Left: with case, <b>PCBs</b> and support <b>frame.</b> Right: stack of Si detectors: XY detector (purple frame), implantation detector (red frames) and β stack (green frames). The beam enters from the left in both cases and is stopped in the middle implantation detector. The modified version of the SIMBA array (see fig. 1), which was used consisted of stacks of silicon detectors: • A thin position-sensitive (60 × 40) double-sided silicon-strip XY detector (shown with a purple frame) ae-mail...|$|R
