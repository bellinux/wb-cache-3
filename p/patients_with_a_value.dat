40|$|Background and Aims: Although {{a number}} of studies have been {{published}} on peritoneal protein clearance (PrCl) and its association with patient outcomes, the results have been inconsistent. Therefore, the intent of this study was to evaluate the impact of PrCl on cardiovascular disease (CVD) and mortality in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients. Methods: This prospective observational study included a total of 540 incident patients who started PD at NHIC Ilsan Hospital, Korea from January 2000 to December 2009. Two different types of analyses such as intention-to-treat and as-treated were used. Results: Correlation analyses revealed that PrCl was positively correlated with diabetes, pulse pressure, C–reactive protein (CRP) level, dialysate/plasma creatinine ratio (D/P cr) at 4 h, and peritoneal Kt/V urea. PrCl was inversely correlated with serum albumin and triglyceride levels. On multivariate analysis, serum albumin, pulse pressure, D/P cr at 4 h, and peritoneal Kt/V urea were found to be independent determinants of PrCl. A total of 129 (23. 9 %) patients in intention-to-treat analysis and 117 (21. 7 %) patients in as-treated analysis developed new cardiovascular events.

40|$|Background: Uric acid (UA) is an {{independent}} risk factor {{for the development of}} coronary heart disease. Serum UA levels have been correlated with all major forms of death from cardiovascular disease, including acute, subacute, and chronic forms of coronary artery disease (CAD), heart failure, and stroke. However, its value in acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) remains unclear. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the prognostic value of UA in patients with STEMI undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Methods: We prospectively enrolled 434 consecutive Turkish STEMI patients (mean age 55. 4 12. 4 years, 341 male, 93 female) undergoing primary PCI. The study population was divided into tertiles based on admission UA values. The high UA group (n = 143) was defined as a value in the third tertile (> 5. 7 mg/dl), and the low UA group (n = 291) included those <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>value</b> in the lower two tertiles (5. 7 mg/dl).

40|$|Since 1999 the Clinic of Urology of the Charite Mitte employs laparoscopic radical prostatectomies (LRP) as the {{standard}} surgical curative therapy for prostate carcinoma. In this dissertation I have evaluated the data of 1, 000 LRP’s - performed between May 1999 and October 2004 - and compared them to current studies. As the three central aspects of postoperative follow-up I have assessed: 1. the bio-chemical recurrence rate in correlation to parameters pT stage, resection status, nerve sparing, Gleason score and initial PSA value, 2. the incontinence rate in relation to surgery year, surgeon and nerve sparing, and 3. type and frequency of complications starting p. o. Day 7. At the time of surgery the age of patients ranged between 37 and 75 years, the average being 62 years. The average BMI was 26. 4, the mean initial PSA value 8. 78 ng/ml. 55. 2 % of the LRP’s were performed with a pelvic lymphadenectomy. The procedure was nerve sparing in 295 cases (29. 5 %). The pathohistological evaluation indicated an incidence of 70. 6 % pT 2, 29. 4 % pT 3 and 0. 4 % pT 4. 22. 3 % of patients had a positive resection margin (R 1). Based on the pT stage, the R 1 incidence for pT 2 patients was 13. 9 %, for pT 3 patients 55. 1 %. 41. 5 % of the collected histological specimens were within a Gleason score of 4 - 6, 58. 5 % within the 7 - 10 range. Of the 1, 000 patients {{we were able to}} collect the follow-up data on incontinence and complications in 952 cases (95. 2 %). The PSA progress rate included 938 patients. The average observation period was 32. 0 months, with a median of 28. 8 months. During the evaluation period, 90. 5 % of patients had no PSA failure with relapse-free rates between 97. 1 % (pT 2 c) and 94. 8 % (pT 2 a), respectively 80. 3 % (pT 3 a) and 72. 4 % (pT 3 b). Likewise, the calculated mean values for an expected PSA failure in the pT 2 group with 64 months p. o. illustrated a distinctly improved prognosis compared to patients with pT 3 a (53 months) and pT 3 b (49. 8 months). The resection status (R) influenced progress risk also significantly. The proportion of patients with PSA failure in all R 1 subgroups (except pT 2 c) was around 8 - 17 % above those in R 0. The same applied to the Gleason score. The initial PSA value as a preoperative parameter had significant influence on the PSA failure rate. For example, the PSA progress rate in pT 3 a <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>value</b> of > 7 ng/ml was 10. 5 % higher, in pT 3 b patients 11. 6 % higher as in the group < 7 ng/ml. Nerve sparing played also a significant factor in relapse probability. Within the individual pT groups the difference of expectancy values for PSA failure - distinguished between nerve sparing yes or no – amounted up to 21 months. The multivariate Cox regression for the pT stage, resection status and Gleason score parameters showed significant influence on progress risk. The PSA-free survival rates of the Charite patients were similar or lower than average compared to other LRP and ORP studies. This underlines the oncological safety of LRP. Long-term observations of 10 or more years, however, are not yet available. The incontinence rate, defined by the persistent need for 2 or more pads per day, was 24 %. It must also be emphasized that the number of men suffering from incontinence decreases with the increase in number of surgeries performed (post-op year), i. e. with an increase in the surgeon’s experience. The incontinence rate of this study is higher compared to other LRP publications. However, it must be stressed that the evaluated surgeries were the first surgical procedures for all 6 urologists (initial 50 to 200 surgeries for each surgeon). Moreover, differences in defining and classifying the groups who need pads cannot be neglected. Nerve sparing has significant influence on incontinence. Their rates drop distinctly with this type of operating method. The overall complication rate of 8. 1 % was comparable or lower than average when compared to relevant LRP and ORP publications. Also, in global comparison individual complications, such as fistulas/abscesses (1. 3 %) and thromboses/embolies (1. 1 %), are in the lower range at the Charite. LRP is rightly seen as an optimization of ORP. The oncological results are absolutely equivalent. In regard to morbidity the method is even considered slightly superior to the open procedure. Merely the incontinence rate of this study exceeded those of other LRP studies. However, for this parameter, as well, a rise of the learning curve became apparent with {{an increase in the number}} of surgeries performed. The reproducibility of this method proves that the LRP method can be passed on to subsequent surgeons without restrictions. The results of this study prove that the LRP method as performed at the Clinic of Urology of the Charite Mitte is a reliable curative therapy for prostate carcinoma...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Recent {{evidence}} suggests that the use of low tidal volume ventilation with the application of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) may benefit patients at risk of respiratory complications during general anaesthesia. However current Australian practice in this area is unknown. METHODS: To describe current practice of intraoperative ventilation with regard to tidal volume and application of PEEP, we performed a multicentre audit in patients undergoing general anaesthesia across eight teaching hospitals in Melbourne, Australia. RESULTS: We obtained information including demographic characteristics, type of surgery, tidal volume and the use of PEEP in a consecutive cohort of 272 patients. The median age was 56 (IQR 42 - 69) years; 150 (55 %) were male. Most common diagnostic groups were general surgery (31 %), orthopaedic surgery (20 %) and neurosurgery (9. 6 %). Mean FiO 2 was 0. 6 (IQR 0. 5 - 0. 7). Median tidal volume was 500 ml (IQR 450 - 550). PEEP was used in 54 % of <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> median <b>value</b> of 5. 0 cmH 2 O (IQR 4. 0 - 5. 0) and median tidal volume corrected for predicted body weight was 9. 5 ml/kg (IQR 8. 5 - 10. 4). Median peak inspiratory pressure was 18 cmH 2 O (IQR 15 - 22). In a cohort of patients considered at risk for respiratory complications, the median tidal volume was still 9. 8 ml/kg (IQR 8. 6 - 10. 7) and PEEP was applied in 66 % of <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> median <b>value</b> of 5 cmH 20 (IQR 4 - 5). On multivariate analyses positive predictors of tidal volume size included male sex (p[*]<[*] 0. 01), height (p[*]=[*] 0. 04) and weight (p[*]<[*] 0. 001). Positive predictors of the use of PEEP included surgery in a tertiary hospital (OR[*]=[*] 3. 11; 95 % CI: 1. 05 to 9. 23) and expected prolonged duration of surgery (OR[*]=[*] 2. 47; 95 % CI: 1. 04 to 5. 84). CONCLUSION: In mechanically ventilated patients under general anaesthesia, tidal volume was high and PEEP was applied to the majority of patients, but at modest levels. The findings of our study suggest that the control groups of previous randomized controlled trials do not closely reflect the practice of mechanical ventilation in Australia. Open Acces...|$|R
40|$|Evidence as to {{the value}} of {{preoperative}} carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) in guiding treatment for <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> colorectal cancer is conflicting. The aim of this prospective study was to investigate the value of preoperative CEA in predicting tumour factors of proven prognostic value and long-term survival in patients undergoing surgery for colorectal cancer. Preoperative serum CEA, tumour ploidy, stage and grade were ascertained in 277 patients undergoing colorectal cancer surgery. This cohort of patients were followed up for a minimum of 5 years, or until death, in a dedicated colorectal clinic. <b>Patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> elevated CEA had a 5 year survival of 39 %. This increased to 57 % if the CEA was normal (P= 0. 001). The proportion of <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> raised CEA increased <b>with</b> <b>a</b> more advanced tumour stage (P < 0. 000001) and a poorly differentiated tumour grade (P < 0. 005).

40|$|Risk {{stratification}} {{is important}} in the assessment of cardiac patients enrolled in physical training programmes but is often based on inadequate information. Measuring blood B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) level, a marker of left ventricular dysfunction, might improve risk assessment. In an observational study blood BNP levels were measured in 100 consecutive patients joining a cardiac rehabilitation programme following acute myocardial infarction. The results were compared with the clinical risk assessment – high, moderate or low. There was a significant correlation between risk category (high, moderate or low) and BNP level (r= 0. 41, p= 0. 001). A BNP level of 100 pg/L or more gave a sensitivity of 89 % (95 % confidence interval [CI] 0. 69, 0. 97) and a specificity of 61 % (95 % CI 0. 57, 0. 63) for predicting high-risk <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> positive predictive <b>value</b> of 33 % (95 % CI 0. 26, 0. 36) and <b>a</b> negative predictive <b>value</b> of 96 % (95 % CI 0. 89, 0. 99).
