25|$|During {{the six-day}} mission, January 12–18, Cenker {{performed}} {{a variety of}} <b>physiological</b> <b>tests,</b> operated a primary experiment – an infrared imaging camera – and assisted with the deployment of RCA Americom's Satcom Ku-1 satellite, the primary mission objective.

25|$|Physiologically, {{increased}} pressure in utero, rickets and increased traction on the sternum due to abnormalities of the diaphragm have been postulated as specific mechanisms. Because {{the heart is}} located behind the sternum, and because individuals with pectus excavatum {{have been shown to}} have visible deformities of the heart seen both on radiological imaging and after autopsies, it has been hypothesized that there is impairment of function of the cardiovascular system in individuals with pectus excavatum. While some studies have demonstrated decreased cardiovascular function, no consensus has been reached based on newer <b>physiological</b> <b>tests</b> such as echocardiography of the presence or degree of impairment in cardiovascular function. Similarly, there is no consensus on the degree of functional improvement after corrective surgery; A 2013 meta-analysis yielded conflicting results.|$|E
25|$|Mate {{guarding}} behaviour {{in males}} {{is much more}} likely to be elicited by the threat of sexual infidelity in a female partner, in comparison to emotional involvement outside the mateship. This is primarily due to the risk female infidelity poses for male paternity, or 'genetic cuckoldry'. In other words, as fertilisation takes place within females, males do not have paternal certainty in the way that females do (females can always be certain that the offspring is theirs, whilst a male cannot). There is supporting evidence for this cross-culturally in a varied range of countries such as China, Germany, Japan and Sweden. Moreover, in <b>physiological</b> <b>tests</b> such as skin conductance and heart rate, men show greater levels of distress when asked to imagine a partner having sexual intercourse with another person. It is also worth noting that mate guarding tactics are more likely to be used if the partner is of high reproductive value e.g. if the female displays signs of high fertility such as youth and physical attractiveness.|$|E

40|$|The Center for Cell Research (CCR) is a NASA Center for the Commercial Development of Space {{which has}} as its main goal {{encouraging}} industry-driven biomedical/biotechnology space projects. Space Station Freedom (SSF) will provide long duration, crew-tended microgravity environments which will enhance the opportunities for commercial biomedical/biotechnology projects in bioseparations and <b>physiological</b> <b>testing.</b> The CCR bioseparations program, known as USCEPS (for United States Commercial Electrophoresis Program in Space), is developing access for American industry to continuous-flow electrophoresis aboard SSF. In space, considerable scale-up of continuous free-flow electrophoresis is possible for cells, sub cellular particles, proteins, growth factors, and other biological products. The lack of sedemination and buoyancy-driven convection flow enhances purity of separations {{and the amount of}} material processed/time. Through the CCR's <b>physiological</b> <b>testing</b> program, commercial organizations will have access aboard SSF to physiological systems experiments (PSE's); the Penn State Biomodule; and telemicroscopy. Physiological systems experiments involve the use of live animals for pharmaceutical product testing and discovery research. The Penn State Biomodule is a computer-controlled mini lab useful for projects involving live cells or tissues and macro molecular assembly studies, including protein crystallization. Telemicroscopy will enable staff on Earth to manipulate and monitor microscopic specimens on SSF for product development and discovery research or for medical diagnosis of astronaut health problems. Space-based product processing, testing, development, and discovery research using USCEPS and CCR's <b>physiological</b> <b>testing</b> program offer new routes to improved health on Earth. Direct crew involvement-in biomedical/biotechnology projects aboard SSF will enable better experimental outcomes. The current data base shows that there is reason for considerable optimism regarding what the CCDS program and the biomedical/biotechnology industry can expect to gain from a permanent manned presence in space...|$|R
