50|$|Like other <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> monkeys, <b>Pennant's</b> <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> {{lives in}} troops which may consist of twelve to eighty {{individuals}} occupying a territory of 25 to 150 hectares. The troops have several males and a rather {{larger number of}} females and juveniles. They move through the canopy with agility, leaping {{from tree to tree}} and making use of the elasticity of the branches. The gestation period is probably about five months before a single infant is born.|$|R
50|$|<b>Pennant's</b> <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> {{is found}} in several {{locations}} in western Central Africa. The nominate subspecies, P. p. pennantii is endemic to Bioko, an island 32 km {{off the coast of}} Equatorial Guinea. The monkeys are largely restricted to the south-west part of the island and have a total range of less than 500 km2. The suggestion that this species has been found on Pico Basile, the highest mountain on the island, has been discounted. Fewer than five thousand animals in this sub-species are believed to exist, with number falling substantially between 1986 and 2006. The Bouvier's <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> occurs in the Republic of Congo in the tract of land on the right bank of the lower Congo River and along the lower reaches of the River Alima to the mouth of the River Likouala-aux-Herbes, both being tributaries of the Congo River. The Niger Delta <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> is found between the Forcados-Nikrogha Creek and the Sagbama-Osiama-Agboi Creek in the wet forests of the Niger Delta region of Nigeria. <b>Pennant's</b> <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> is an arboreal species and {{is found in}} both primary and secondary forest and also in marshy forest.|$|R

50|$|<b>Pennant's</b> <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> monkeys {{have been}} little studied but their diet {{is likely to}} be similar to that of other <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> monkeys and consist mainly of fresh leaves {{supplemented}} by flowers, fruit and seeds. They have specialist teeth that can macerate leaves and break up tough but pliant unripe fruit and the seeds embedded in the flesh. Their multi-chambered stomach permits fermentation to occur and they can alternate between a leaf-based and a seed-based diet. They tend to select foliage with a high protein to fibre ratio and a low tannin content. One of their favourite food trees is Fleroya ledermannii.|$|R
50|$|<b>Pennant's</b> <b>colobus</b> or <b>Pennant's</b> <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> (Procolobus pennantii) is {{a species}} of tree-dwelling primate in the family Cercopithecidae. It is endemic to {{tropical}} Central Africa. Three subspecies have traditionally been recognised but its distribution is peculiarly disjunct and has been considered a biogeographical puzzle. with one population {{on the island of}} Bioko (Equatorial Guinea), a second in the Niger River Delta in southern Nigeria, and a third in east-central Republic of Congo. It is found in rainforests and marshy forests. It is threatened by habitat loss and hunting for bushmeat. One subspecies, bouvieri, is rated as Critically Endangered; although it was last photographically documented in 2015, it may be on the brink of extinction.|$|R
50|$|<b>Pennant's</b> <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> is a moderate-sized {{species with}} a head and body length of 53 to 63 cm and a tail of 60 to 70 cm. It weighs about 7 to 10 kg. It has a small head and robust body with long limbs. The long fingers have a {{powerful}} grip for climbing about among the branches, but it has no thumbs. The colouration varies between subspecies, being black or some shade of brown with chestnut-brown or reddish face, {{arms and legs and}} pale underparts. The black face is crowned with long hair, usually parted in the middle. Red colobus monkeys have a long tail used only for balancing which is not prehensile.|$|R
40|$|A goal of {{conservation}} biology {{is to determine}} which types of species are most susceptible to habitat disturbance and which types of disturbed habitats can support particular species. We studied 20 forest fragments outside of Kibale National Park, Uganda, to address this question. At each patch, we determined the presence of primate species, tree species composition, patch size, and distance to nearest patch. We collected demographic, behavioral, and dietary data for Abyssinian black-and-white colobus (Colobus guereza). Black-and-white colobus and red-tailed guenons (Cercopithecus ascanius) were in almost all fragments; <b>Pennant’s</b> <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> (Procolobus pennantii) and chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) were in some fragments; and blue monkeys (Cercopithecus mitis) and gray-cheeked mangabeys (Lophocebus albigena) were absent from all fragments. No species characteristics—home range, body size, group size, or degree of frugivory—predicted the ability of species to live in patches. No characteristics of patches—area, distance to the nearest patch, distance to Kibale, or number of food trees present—predicted {{the presence of a}} particular species in a patch, but distance to Kibale may have influenced presence of <b>red</b> <b>colobus.</b> Black-and-white colobus group size was signifi-cantly smaller in the forest patches than in the continuous forest of Kibale.

50|$|The Ugandan <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> has {{two main}} predators: the common {{chimpanzee}} and the crowned eagle. There are many primate species in Kibale National Park but chimpanzees rarely hunt any species {{other than the}} Ugandan <b>red</b> <b>colobus.</b> Each year in Ngogo, part of Kibale National Park, up to 12% of the <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> population is killed by chimpanzees. Chimpanzees do not hunt Ugandan <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> all year round, instead they tend to go through bouts of heavy hunting. In response to attacks by a chimpanzee, all members of a Ugandan <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> group gather together and males assemble to aggressively try and deter the attacking chimpanzee.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. In this 3 -year {{investigation}} we documented {{patterns of}} density, diet, and activity of <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> monkeys (Procolobus tephrosceles) in six areas {{in or near}} Kibale National Park, Uganda and related these patterns to availability of food resources. There were large differences in the density and behavior of the <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> among the sites. For example, the <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> at one site with a diverse plant community of more than 61 tree species, had a diet that included at least 42 species. In contrast, at a second site <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> spent 92 % of their feeding time eating from one species that dominated the tree community. The density of important <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> food trees varied among sites from 32 trees/ha to 204 trees/ha, and <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> density ranged from 0. 70 groups/km 2 to 7. 41 groups/km 2. Among sites, <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> density {{was related to the}} cumulative DBH of important food trees, when one apparently anom-alous site was excluded, and populations with more plant species in their diets tended to be those that were found at higher densities. Activity budgets of the <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> populations varied markedly among sites. For example, feeding time ranged among sites from 29 to 55 %, and traveling varied from 5 to 20 %. When faced with increased foraging demands, <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> reduced the time spent resting, while the time spent socializing remained fairly constant. Comparative socioecological studies typically contrast species epa-rated by large geographical distances to ensure there is sufficient variation in the environment to detect behavioral responses. The marked ifferences in ecological conditions and <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> behavior we docu-mented over short geographical distances, uggests that small-scale contrasts are a useful tool to examine ecological determinants of behavior and community structure...|$|R
50|$|Miss Waldron's <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> (Piliocolobus badius waldronae) is a {{subspecies}} of {{the western}} <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> native to West Africa. It has not been officially sighted since 1978 and was considered extinct in 2000. However, new evidence suggests that {{a very small number}} of these monkeys may be living in the southeast corner of Côte d'Ivoire.

50|$|Pennant's colobus {{was first}} {{described}} in 1838 by George Robert Waterhouse, {{curator at the}} Zoological Society of London's museum, and was named in honour of the naturalist and traveller Thomas Pennant.Three subspecies of this <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> are traditionally recognized: The Bioko <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> (Procolobus pennantii pennantii), the Niger Delta <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> (Procolobus pennantii epieni) and Bouvier's <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> (Procolobus pennantii bouvieri). However, Groves (2007) raised P. p. epieni, and P. p. bouvieri to Piliocolobus epieni and Piliocolobus bouvieri, respectively (this nomenclature has been followed here). Ting agreed that preliminary genetic evidence supported elevating P. epieni at least.|$|R
5000|$|From {{the time}} it first became known to science (in 1993) until 2007 or 2008, it was {{considered}} a subspecies of the western <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> (Procolobus badius) and more recently Pennant's colobus (Procolobus pennantii), and its trinomial name was Procolobus badius epieni or Procolobus pennantii epieni. Colin Groves recognized the Niger Delta <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> as a full species in 2007, although Groves considered all the <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> monkeys, including the Niger Delta <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> {{to be in the}} genus Piliocolobus, rather than Procolobus (this nomenclature has been followed here).

50|$|It is {{not certain}} why the Ugandan <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> forms these {{associations}} with other species but protection from predators is the most accepted reason. The Ugandan <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> is less vigilant, looking out for predators less often, when associated with the red-tailed monkey.

40|$|Primate {{gastrointestinal}} microbial {{communities are}} becoming increasingly appreciated for their relevance to comparative medicine and conservation, but the factors that structure primate “microbiomes ” remain controversial. This study examined a community of primates in Kibale National Park, Uganda, to assess {{the relative importance of}} host species and location in structuring gastrointestinal microbiomes. Fecal samples were collected from primates in intact forest and from primates in highly disturbed forest fragments. People and livestock living nearby were also included, as was a geographically distant population of related <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> in Kenya. A culture‐free microbial community fingerprinting technique was used to analyze fecal microbiomes from 124 individual <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> (Procolobus rufomitratus), 100 individual black‐and‐white colobus (Colobus guereza), 111 individual red‐tailed guenons (Cercopithecus ascanius), 578 human volunteers, and 364 domestic animals, including cattle (Bos indicus and B. indicusB. taurus crosses), goats (Caprus hircus), sheep (Ovis aries), and pigs (Sus scrofa).

50|$|Another {{remarkable}} behavior {{occurs when}} <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> monkeys reach their restless and somewhat nomadic adolescence. This period {{is when the}} young monkeys leave their natal troops and look for another troop to join. This is not easy, as most troops are very suspicious and can get deadly when new monkeys try to join. The <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> monkeys have adapted their behavior by joining troops of green monkeys that are near the potential <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> troops that they wish to join, and living amongst {{them in order to}} spy on their potential new families. In one notable case, an adolescent male <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> spent two years with a green monkey troop in order to spy in safety on a prospective troop in this manner.|$|R
