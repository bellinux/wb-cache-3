50|$|Adinazolam was {{reported}} to have active metabolites in the August 1984 issue of The Journal of Pharmacy and Pharmacology. The main metabolite is N-desmethyladinazolam. NDMAD has an approximately 25-fold high affinity for benzodiazepine receptors as compared to its precursor, accounting for the benzodiazepine-like effects after oral administration. Multiple N-dealkylations lead to the removal dimethyl-aminoethyl side chain, leading to the difference in its potency. The other two metabolites are alpha-hydroxyalprazolam and estazolam.

40|$|AbstractTo {{determine}} {{the importance of}} electrostatic interactions for agonist binding to the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR), we examined the affinity of the fluorescent agonist dansyl-C 6 -choline for the AChR. Increasing ionic strength decreased the binding affinity in a noncompetitive manner and increased the Hill coefficient of binding. Small cations did not compete directly for dansyl-C 6 -choline binding. The sensitivity to ionic strength was reduced {{in the presence of}} <b>proadifen,</b> a noncompetitive antagonist that desensitizes the receptor. Moreover, at low ionic strength, the dansyl-C 6 -choline affinities were similar in the absence or presence of <b>proadifen,</b> a result consistent with the receptor being desensitized at low ionic strength. Similar ionic strength effects were observed for the binding of the noncompetitive antagonist [3 H]ethidium when examined in the presence and absence of agonist to desensitize the AChR. Therefore, ionic strength modulates binding affinity through at least two mechanisms: by influencing the conformation of the AChR and by electrostatic effects at the binding sites. The results show that charge-charge interactions regulate the desensitization of the receptor. Analysis of dansyl-C 6 -choline binding to the desensitized conformation using the Debye-Hückel equation was consistent with the presence of five to nine negative charges within 20 Å of the acetylcholine binding sites...|$|E

40|$|Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{determine}} if propoxyphene and norpropoxyphene are mechanism-based (irreversible) inhibitors of CYP 3 A, and to determine if propoxyphene and norpropoxyphene are reversible inhibitors of CYP 3 A. Mechanismbased inhibition is a type of irreversible inhibition that results from an inhibitor or its metabolite binding to an enzyme during drug metabolism, which renders the enzyme nonfunctional. Propoxyphene is an analgesic that is frequently prescribed in the United States and Europe. It is metabolized by CYP 3 A enzymes, and is an irreversible inhibitor of CYP 3 A 4. The major metabolite of propoxyphene is norpropoxyphene, which has not been extensively studied for enzyme inhibition. <b>Proadifen</b> (SKF- 525 a) is not a marketed drug, but it is a known CYP inhibitor that is structurally similar to propoxyphene and norpropoxyphene. Propoxyphene, norpropoxyphene, and <b>proadifen</b> were characterized in these studies with CYP 3 A 4 (+b 5), CYP 3 A 5 (+b 5) and pooled human liver microsomes. Time-dependent and concentration-dependent loss of activity of CYP 3 A was measured by formation of testosterone product. Propoxyphene and norpropoxyphene exhibited the greatest inhibition with CYP 3 A in human liver microsomes, followed by CYP 3 A 4 (+b 5), and CYP 3 A 5 (+b 5). Both compounds formed metabolic-inhibitor complexes with vi CYP 3 A 4 (+b 5) and CYP 3 A 5 (+b 5), but not with human liver microsomes. <b>Proadifen</b> was a more potent inhibitor of CYP 3 A 4 (+b 5) than of human liver microsomes and CYP 3 A 5 (+b 5). The KI values of propoxyphene and CYP 3 A 4 (+b 5) and human liver microsomes fall within the range of reported therapeutic blood levels of propoxyphene, with reversible inhibition constants (Ki values) above therapeutic blood concentrations for propoxyphene and norpropoxyphene. The KI values of norpropoxyphene and CYP 3 A 4 (+b 5) and human liver microsomes are higher than most reported blood levels, except for blood levels after repeated dosing of propoxyphene at high concentrations. The predicted change in the area under the plasma concentration versus time curve of an orally administered CYP 3 A substrate with propoxyphene (AUC'po/AUCpo) was calculated for common CYP 3 A substrates. The AUC'po/AUCpo ratios are four to twenty-five times higher with co-administration of propoxyphene based on in vitro kinetic parameters.

40|$|We have {{investigated}} whether the cytochrome P 450 system {{is involved in}} Ca 2 + signalling in rat pancreatic acinar cells. Intracellular free [Ca 2 +] ([Ca 2 +]i) was measured in collagenase-isolated cells using fura- 2 microspectrofluorimetry and imaging. The imidazole P 450 inhibitor ketoconazole (5 – 50 [*]μM) inhibited [Ca 2 +]i oscillations induced by cholecystokinin octapeptide (CCK). However, ketoconazole also raised baseline [Ca 2 +]i when applied {{in the absence of}} CCK. These effects were mimicked by 5 – 50 [*]μM SKF 96365, an imidazole widely used as an inhibitor of Ca 2 + entry. The non-imidazole P 450 inhibitor <b>proadifen</b> (SKF 525 A) inhibited CCK-induced [Ca 2 +]i oscillations at a concentration of 10 – 50 [*]μM. <b>Proadifen</b> alone caused intracellular Ca 2 + release at 25 or 50 [*]μM, but not at 10 [*]μM. Octadecynoic acid and 1 -aminobenzotriazole, structurally-unrelated non-imidazole P 450 inhibitors, did not alter baseline [Ca 2 +]i or CCK-evoked oscillations. We compared cumulative CCK dose-response relationship in control cells and in cells where P 450 had been induced by prior injection of animals with β-naphthoflavone. Only minor differences were apparent, with induced cells showing some decrease in responsiveness at moderate and higher concentration of CCK (30 [*]pM– 3 [*]nM). Direct assessment of depletion-activated Ca 2 + entry showed no clear differences between control and induced cells. In conclusion, we could find no compelling evidence for a role of P 450 in controlling Ca 2 + signalling generally, or Ca 2 + entry in particular, in pancreatic acinar cells. Induction of P 450 is therefore probably toxic to acinar cells via a Ca 2 +-independent mechanism...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: As {{metastasis}} is {{the prime}} cause of death from malignancies, there is vibrant interest to discover options {{for the management of}} the different mechanistic steps of tumour spreading. Some approved pharmaceuticals exhibit activities against diseases they have not been developed for. In order to discover such activities that might attenuate lymph node metastasis, we investigated 225 drugs, which are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. METHODS: A three-dimensional cell co-culture assay was utilised measuring tumour cell-induced disintegrations of the lymphendothelial wall through which tumour emboli can intravasate as a limiting step in lymph node metastasis of ductal breast cancer. The disintegrated areas in the lymphendothelial cell (LEC) monolayers were induced by 12 (S) -HETE, which is secreted by MCF- 7 tumour cell spheroids, and are called 'circular chemorepellent induced defects' (CCIDs). The putative mechanisms by which active drugs prevented the formation of entry gates were investigated by western blotting, NF-κB activity assay and by the determination of 12 (S) -HETE synthesis. RESULTS: Acetohexamide, nifedipin, isoxsuprine and <b>proadifen</b> dose dependently inhibited the formation of CCIDs in LEC monolayers and inhibited markers of epithelial-to-mesenchymal-transition and migration. The migration of LECs is a prerequisite of CCID formation, and these drugs either repressed paxillin levels or the activities of myosin light chain 2, or myosin-binding subunit of myosin phosphatase. Isoxsuprine inhibited all three migration markers, and isoxsuprine and acetohexamide suppressed the synthesis of 12 (S) -HETE, whereas <b>proadifen</b> and nifedipin inhibited NF-κB activation. Both the signalling pathways independently cause CCID formation. CONCLUSION: The targeting of different mechanisms was most likely the reason for synergistic effects of different drug combinations on the inhibition of CCID formation. Furthermore, the treatment with drug combinations allowed also a several-fold reduction in drug concentrations. These results encourage further screening of approved drugs and their in vivo testing...|$|E

40|$|Acetylcholine (ACh) elicits an endothelium-dependent {{relaxation}} and hyperpolarization {{in the absence}} of nitric oxide (NO) and prostaglandin synthesis in the guinea-pig coronary artery (GPCA). This response has been attributed to a factor termed endothelial-derived hyperpolarizing factor (EDHF). Recently {{it has been suggested that}} EDHF may be a cytochrome P 450 product of arachidonic acid (AA) i. e., an epoxyeicosatrienoic acid (EET). The present study investigated whether this pathway could account for the response to ACh observed in the GPCA in the presence of 100 [*]μM Nω-nitro-L-arginine and 10 [*]μM indomethacin. ACh, AA and 11, 12 -EET each produced concentration-dependent relaxations in arteries contracted with the H 1 -receptor agonist AEP (2, 2 -aminoethylpyridine). The AA-induced relaxation was significantly enhanced in the presence of the cyclo-oxygenase/lipoxygenase inhibitor, eicosatetranynoic acid (30 [*]μM). The cytochrome P 450 inhibitors <b>proadifen</b> (10 [*]μM) and clotrimazole (10 [*]μM) inhibited ACh, lemakalim (LEM) and AA-induced relaxation, whereas 17 -octadecynoic acid (100 [*]μM) and 7 -ethoxyresorufin (10 [*]μM) were without effect on all three vasodilators. <b>Proadifen</b> and clotrimazole also inhibited ACh (1 [*]μM) and LEM (1 [*]μM) -induced hyperpolarization. The ability of various potassium channel blockers to inhibit relaxation responses elicited with ACh, AA and 11, 12 -EET was also determined. Iberiotoxin (IBTX; 100 [*]nM) was without effect on responses to ACh but significantly reduced responses to both AA and 11, 12 -EET. In contrast, 4 -aminopyridine (4 -AP; 5 [*]mM) significantly reduced response to ACh but not responses to AA and 11, 12 -EET. Combined IBTX plus (4 -AP) inhibited the ACh-induced relaxation to a greater extent than 4 -AP alone. Apamin (1 [*]μM), glibenclamide (10 [*]μM) and BaCl 2 (50 [*]μM) had no significant effect on responses to ACh, AA and 11, 12 -EET. IBTX (100 [*]nM) significantly reduced both 11, 12 -EET (33 [*]μM) and AA (30 [*]μM) hyperpolarization without affecting the ACh (1 [*]μM) -induced hyperpolarization. In contrast, 4 -AP significantly reduced the ACh-induced hyperpolarization without affecting either AA or 11, 12 -EET-induced hyperpolarizations. In summary, our results suggest that the coronary endothelium releases a factor upon application of AA which hyperpolarizes the smooth muscle. The similarity of pharmacology between AA and 11, 12 -EET suggests that this factor is an EET. However, the disparity of pharmacology between responses to ACh versus responses to 11, 12 -EET do not support the hypothesis that EETs represent the predominant factor which ACh releases from the endothelium that leads to NO- and prostaglandin-independent hyperpolarization and relaxation in the GPCA...|$|E

The hepatocytes that were previously incubated with <b>proadifen,</b> a cytochrome P 450 inhibitor, are more sensitive to the compound as observed by a rapid decrease in the mitochondrial membrane potential accompanied by reductions in ATP concentration and cell viability and a disruption of intracellular Ca 2 + homeostasis followed by necrosis.

40|$|The {{mechanism}} {{responsible for}} the blocking action of mecamylamine on neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) was studied on rat isolated chromaffin cells recorded under whole-cell patch clamp. Mecamylamine strongly depressed (IC(50) = 0. 34 microM) inward currents elicited by short pulses of nicotine, an effect slowly reversible on wash. The mecamylamine block was voltage-dependent and promptly relieved by a protocol combining membrane depolarization with a nicotine pulse. Either depolarization or nicotine pulses were insufficient per se to elicit block relief. Block relief was transient; response depression returned in a use-dependent manner. Exposure to mecamylamine failed to block nAChRs {{if they were not}} activated by nicotine or if they were activated at positive membrane potentials. These data suggest that mecamylamine could not interact with receptors either at rest or at depolarized level. Other nicotinic antagonists like dihydro-beta-erythroidine or tubocurarine did not share this action of mecamylamine although <b>proadifen</b> partly mimicked it. Mecamylamine is suggested to penetrate and block open nAChRs that would subsequently close and trap this antagonist. Computer modeling indicated that the mechanism of mecamylamine blocking action could be described by assuming that 1) mecamylamine-blocked receptors possessed a much slower, voltage-dependent isomerization rate, 2) the rate constant for mecamylamine unbinding was large and poorly voltage dependent. Hence, channel reopening plus depolarization allowed mecamylamine escape and block relief. In the presence of mecamylamine, therefore, nAChRs acquire the new property of operating as coincidence detectors for concomitant changes in membrane potential and receptor occupancy...|$|E

They also caused an approximately 2 -fold decrease in the concentration of UDP-glucuronate but little if any change in the concentration of UDP-glucose. Depletion of UDP-glucuronate with resorcinol or d-galactosamine markedly decreased the formation of glucuronate both in the presence {{and in the absence of}} aminopyrine, confirming the precursor-product relationship between UDP-glucuronate and free glucuronate. Most of the agents did not induce the formation of detectable amounts of glucuronides, indicating that the formation of glucuronate is not due to a glucuronidation-deglucuronidation cycle. With the exception of barbital (which inhibits glucuronate reductase), all of the above mentioned agents also caused an increase in the concentration of ascorbic acid. They had little effect on glutathione concentration, and their effect on glucuronate and vitamin C formation was not mimicked by glutathione-depleting agents such as diamide and buthionine sulfoximine. It is concluded that the stimulation of vitamin C synthesis exerted by some xenobiotics is mediated through a rapid increase in the conversion of UDP-glucuronate to glucuronate, which does not apparently involve a glucuronidation-deglucuronidation cycle...|$|E
40|$|The {{toxicology}} of the cyanobacterial alkaloid cylindrospermopsin (CYN), {{a potent}} inhibitor of protein synthesis, appears complex {{and is not}} well understood. In exposed mice the liver is the main target for the toxic effects of CYN. In this study primary mouse hepatocyte cultures were used to investigate the mechanisms involved in CYN toxicity. The results show that 1 - 5 microM CYN caused significant concentration-dependent cytotoxicity (52 %- 82 % cell death) at 18 h. Protein synthesis inhibition was a sensitive, early indicator of cellular responses to CYN. Following removal of the toxin, the inhibition of protein synthesis could not be reversed, showing behavior {{similar to that of}} the irreversible inhibitor emetine. In contrast to the LDH leakage, protein synthesis was maximally inhibited by 0. 5 microM CYN. No protein synthesis occurred over 4 - 18 h at or above this concentration. Inhibition of cytochrome P 450 (CYP 450) activity with 50 microM <b>proadifen</b> or 50 microM ketoconazole diminished the toxicity of CYN but not the effects on protein synthesis. These findings imply a dissociation of the two events and implicate the involvement of CYP 450 -derived metabolites in the toxicity process, but not in the impairment of protein synthesis. Thus, the total abolition of protein synthesis may exaggerate the metabolite effects but cannot be considered a primary cause of cell death in hepatocytes over an acute time frame. In cell types deficient in CYP 450 enzymes, protein synthesis inhibition may play a more crucial role in the development of cytotoxicity...|$|E
40|$|Platelet {{activating}} factor inhibits Cl and K transport in the medullary thick ascending limb. Since {{the kidney}} medulla {{was reported to}} generate platelet activating factor (PAF), we investigated a possible effect of this agent on the reabsorptive function of in vitro microperfused medullary thick ascending limbs from mouse kidney (mTAL). PAF, 10 - 7 M in the bath, significantly decreased the net chloride flux (JCl) from 48. 8 ± 7. 1 to 27. 4 ± 5. 7 pmol/min. This effect was reversible, blocked by the antagonist BN 50730, and not reproduced by the inactive metabolite lyso-PAF. PAF inhibited the transepithelial potential difference with a threshold at 10 - 9 M. In the presence of isoproterenol, the PAF-induced decrease of JCl was {{not significantly different from}} that observed in basal conditions; moreover, PAF did not modify the adenylate cyclase activity in isolated mTALs, either in basal condition or under stimulation by isoproterenol. The effect of PAF on JCl was not prevented by mepacrine, NDGA associated with <b>proadifen,</b> or adenosine desami-nase. When the apical Na-K- 2 Cl cotransport was blocked by furosemide or bumetanide, a net K secretion occurred (- 1. 1 ± 0. 2 pmol/min), which was significantly decreased by PAF (- 0. 06 ± 0. 3 pmol/min). Moreover, it was verified on isolated mTALs that PAF did not modify the Na,K-ATPase activity. It is concluded that PAF inhibits the reabsorptive function of the mTAL, as indicated by the decrease of Cl reabsorption and K secretion. This effect could not be accounted for by adenosine or arachidonic acid metabolite action, and was not mediated by an inhibition of the adenylate cyclase activity...|$|E
40|$|Agonist-binding {{kinetics}} to the nicotinic {{acetylcholine receptor}} (AChR) from Torpedo californica were measured using sequential-mixing stopped-flow fluorescence methods to determine the contribution of each individual site to agonist-induced opening and desensitization. Timed dansyl-C 6 -choline (DC 6 C) binding followed by its dissociation upon mixing with high, competing agonist concentrations revealed four kinetic components: an initial, fast fluorescence decay, followed by a transient increase, and then two characteristic decays that reflect dissociation from the desensitized agonist sites. The transient increase resulted from DC 6 C binding to the open-channel based on its prevention by <b>proadifen,</b> a noncompetitive antagonist. Further characterization of DC 6 C channel binding by the inhibition of [3 H]phencyclidine binding and by equilibrium measurements of DC 6 C fluorescence yielded KD values of 2 - 4 microM for the desensitized AChR and approximately 600 microM for the closed state. At this site, DC 6 C displayed a strongly blue-shifted emission spectrum, higher intrinsic fluorescence, and weaker energy transfer from tryptophans than when bound to either agonist site. The initial, fast fluorescence decay was assigned to DC 6 C dissociation from the alphadelta site of the AChR in its closed conformation, {{on the basis of}} inhibition with the site-selective antagonists d-tubocurarine and alpha-conotoxin MI. Fast decay amplitude data indicated an apparent affinity of 0. 9 microM for the closed-state alphadelta site; the closed-state alphagamma-site affinity is inferred to be near 100 microM. These values and the known affinities for the desensitized conformation show that the alphagamma site drives AChR desensitization to a approximately 40 -fold greater extent than the alphadelta site, undergoes energetically larger conformational changes, and is the primary determinant of agonist potency.

40|$|Hydrogen sulfide (H(2) S), a novel gaseous transmitter, is {{considered}} a physiological regulator of vascular homeostasis. Recent evidence suggests H(2) S as an endothelium-hyperpolarizing factor (EDHF) candidate. To address this issue, we evaluated the vascular effect of sodium hydrogen sulfide (NaHS), an H(2) S donor, on the rat mesenteric arterial bed. NaHS concentration-response curve was performed on preconstricted mesenteric arterial bed. To assess the contribution of EDHF, we performed a pharmacologic dissection using indomethacin, N(G) -nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (l-NAME), or apamin and charybdotoxin as cyclooxygenase, nitric-oxide synthase, and calcium-dependent potassium channel inhibitors, respectively. In another set of experiments, we used 4 -(4 -octadecylphenyl) - 4 -oxobutenoic acid, baicalein, or <b>proadifen</b> as phospholipase A(2) (PLA(2)), lipoxygenase, and cytochrome P 450 inhibitors, respectively. Finally, an immunofluorescence study was performed to support the involvement of PLA(2) in mesenteric artery challenged by NaHS. NaHS promoted a dual vascular effect (i. e., vasoconstriction and vasodilation). l-NAME or baicalein administration affected neither NaHS-mediated vasodilation nor vasoconstriction, whereas apamin and charybdotoxin significantly inhibited NaHS-induced relaxation. Pretreatment with PLA(2) inhibitor abolished both the contracting and the relaxant effect, whereas P 450 cytochrome blocker significantly reduced NaHS-mediated relaxation. The immunofluorescence study showed that NaHS caused a migration of cytosolic PLA(2) close to the nucleus, which implicates activation of this enzyme. Our data indicate that H(2) S could activate PLA(2), which in turn releases arachidonic acid leading, initially, to vasoconstriction followed by vasodilation mediated by cytochrome P 450 -derived metabolites. Because EDHF has been presumed to be a cytochrome P 450 derivative of the arachidonic acid, our results suggest that H(2) S acts through EHDF releas...|$|E
40|$|In monkey lingual artery strips {{partially}} {{contracted with}} prostaglandin[*]F 2 α, acetylcholine-induced, concentration-related relaxations were abolished by {{removal of the}} endothelium. The response was not significantly influenced by indomethacin but attenuated by NG-nitro-L-arginine (L-NOARG); {{the effect of the}} nitric oxide (NO) synthase inhibitor was reversed by L-arginine. The response to acetylcholine resistant to L-NOARG was suppressed in the strips exposed to high K+ media. Charybdotoxin partially inhibited the relaxation, and the remaining relaxation was abolished by additional treatment with apamin, whereas glibenclamide, iberiotoxin or apamin alone was without effect. Relaxations induced by sodium nitroprusside were not influenced by charybdotoxin. The L-NOARG-resistant acetylcholine-induced relaxation was inhibited by metyrapone, <b>proadifen</b> and 17 -octadecynoic acid, non-selective cytochrome P 450 mono-oxygenase (CYP) inhibitors, and progesterone and ketoconazole, inhibitors selective to CYP 3 A. The inhibitors did not affect the nitroprusside-induced relaxation. Selective inhibitors of other CYP isoforms, such as debrisoquine and lauric acid, did not reduce the response to acetylcholine. Reaction mixture containing human liver microsome rich in CYPs, arachidonic acid and NADPH incubated at 37 °C and filtrated relaxed endothelium-denuded monkey lingual artery strips, used as bioassay tissues. This response was abolished in the strips exposed to high K+ media. The response was also suppressed by combined treatment of the assay tissue with charybdotoxin plus apamin, but was not affected by treatment with iberiotoxin. The reaction mixture co-incubated with ketoconazole failed to relax the strips. It is concluded that the monkey lingual arterial relaxation dependent on the endothelium is mediated by NO and also by a charybdotoxin plus apamin-sensitive but iberiotoxin-insensitive Ca 2 +-activated K+ channel opening substance(s) that may be a CYP 3 A-derived arachidonic acid metabolite(s) ...|$|E

Relatively {{little is known about the}} overall role of CYP 450 in the metabolism of xenobiotics or endogenous cellular compounds in the skin. The aim of this study was to analyse the expression and induction of several drugs metabolizing enzymes involved in either phase I or phase II reactions, in proliferanting human keratinocytes after exposure to UVB radiation and to three classical cytochrome inducers such as: β-naphthoflavone (BNF), 3 -methylcholanthrene (MC), phenobarbital (PB). We investigated 7 -ethoxyresorufìn O-deethylase (EROD) and 7 -pentoxyresorufìn O-depenthylase activities (PROD). Normal human keratinocytes were cultured with mitomycin-treated 3 T 3 cells in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium/Ham’s F 12. At confluency cells were incubated with inducers or irradiated with different doses of UVB. The microsomal fraction was studied by western-blot analysis. The MC-induced EROD activity was up to 4 fold higher when compared with BNF induced activity. UVB exposure resulted in a dose-dependent (25 - 75 mJ) and time dependent (6 - 24 h) induction of CYP 450 1 A 1. Immunoblotting assay showed expression for CYP 450 1 B 1 for both keratinocytes and melanocytes. <b>Proadifen,</b> an inhibitor of CYP 450 -monooxygenase, led to a significant decrease in EROD activity. The results of the present study clearly show that irradiation with UVB is capable of modifying the activity of CYP 450 isoenzymes in keratinocytes. The phase II enzyme gluthatione S transferase activity (GST) was induced by UVB and PB.

40|$|Recent {{reports have}} {{suggested}} {{the involvement of}} arachidonic acid (AA) and its metabolites in the control of body pattern, head and tentacle regeneration and bud formation in Hydra spp. Here we describe {{for the first time}} the biosynthesis of hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (HETEs) in vitro by hydroid cytosolic extracts. Incubation of both unlabelled and tritiated AA with homogenates of Hydra vulgaris led to the conversion of up to 11 % of the exogenous fatty acid into mainly two metabolites. These were characterized as 11 -hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid (11 -HPETE) and 11 -HETE by means of a combination of chromatographic, chemical, 1 H-n. m. r. and electron-impact m. s. techniques. Trace amounts of 9 -HETE and 12 -HETE were also found. Analysis of 11 -HETE by chiral-phase h. p. l. c. revealed that this metabolite was composed mainly of the R enantiomer. The production of 11 -HPETE and 11 -HETE was found to be: (1) associated with the cytosolic fraction of Hydra homogenates; (2) dependent on AA concentration, incubation time and protein amount in the homogenates; (3) unaffected by co-incubation with the 5 - and 12 -lipoxygenase inhibitors, 5, 8, 11 -eicosatriynoic acid and nordihydroguaiaretic acid, the cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor, indomethacin, or the cytochrome P- 450 inhibitors, <b>proadifen</b> and methoxalen. These results strongly suggest the presence of a very active (R) - 11 -lipoxygenase in H. vulgaris. The activity of both R and S enantiomers of synthetic 9 -, 11 - and 12 -HETE and of 'endogenous' 11 -HETE was studied on tentacle regeneration and bud formation in decapitated Hydra. Although almost all compounds tested inhibited budding, only endogenous 11 -HETE and synthetic (R) - 11 -HETE significantly enhanced the average number of tentacles, thus suggesting that this eicosanoid might be one of the cellular regulators of regeneration in H. vulgaris...|$|E
40|$|Bradykinin (BK) {{effect on}} the [Ca 2 +]i {{response}} to 1 [*]nM angiotensin II was examined in muscular juxtamedullary efferent arterioles (EA) of rat kidney. BK (10 [*]nM) applied during the angiotensin II-stimulated [Ca 2 +]i increase, induced a [Ca 2 +]i drop (73 ± 2 %). This drop was prevented by de-endothelialization and suppressed by HOE 140, a B 2 receptor antagonist. It was neither affected by L-NAME or indomethacin, nor mimicked by sodium nitroprusside, 8 -bromo-cyclic GMP or PGI 2. The BK effect did not occur when the [Ca 2 +]i increase was caused by 100 [*]mM KCl-induced membrane depolarization and was abolished by 0. 1 [*]μM charybdotoxin, a K+ channel blocker. Although <b>proadifen</b> prevented the BK-caused [Ca 2 +]i fall, more selective cytochrome P 450 inhibitors, 17 -octadecynoic acid (50 [*]μM) and 7 -ethoxyresorufin (10 [*]μM) were without effect. Increasing extracellular potassium from 5 to 15 [*]mM during angiotensin II stimulation caused a [Ca 2 +]i decrease (26 ± 4 %) smaller than BK which was charybdotoxin-insensitive. Inhibition of inward rectifying K+ channels by 30 [*]μM BaCl 2 and/or of Na+/K+ ATPase by 1 [*]mM ouabain abolished the [Ca 2 +]i decrease elicited by potassium but not by BK. A voltage-operated calcium channel blocker, nifedipine (1 [*]μM) did not prevent the BK effect but reduced the [Ca 2 +]i drop.

In these vessels, EDHF seems to be neither a cytochrome P 450 -derived arachidonic acid metabolite nor K+ itself. The closure of voltage-operated calcium channels is not the only cellular mechanism involved in this EDHF-mediated [Ca 2 +]i decrease...|$|E
40|$|Calcium {{responses}} {{induced by}} brief stimulation with acetylcholine (ACh) were assessed from the fluorescence changes in fura- 2 loaded submucosal arterioles of the guinea-pig small intestine. Initially, 1 – 1. 5 h after loading with fura- 2 (fresh tissues), ACh increased [Ca 2 +]i in a concentration-dependent manner. This response diminished with time, and finally disappeared in 2 – 3 h (old tissues). Ba 2 + elevated [Ca 2 +]i {{to a similar}} extent in both fresh and old tissues. ACh further increased the Ba 2 +-elevated [Ca 2 +]i in fresh tissues, but reduced it in old tissues. Responses were not affected by either indomethacin or nitroarginine. In fresh mesenteric arteries, mechanical removal of endothelial cells abolished the ACh-induced increase in [Ca 2 +]i, with no alteration of [Ca 2 +]i at rest and during elevation with Ba 2 +. In the presence of indomethacin and nitroarginine, high-K+ solution elevated [Ca 2 +]i in both fresh and old tissues. Subsequent addition of ACh further increased [Ca 2 +]i in fresh tissues without changing it in old tissues. <b>Proadifen,</b> an inhibitor of the enzyme cytochrome P 450 mono-oxygenase, inhibited the ACh-induced changes in [Ca 2 +]i in both fresh and Ba 2 +-stimulated old tissues. It also inhibited the ACh-induced hyperpolarization. In fresh tissues, the ACh-induced Ca 2 + response was not changed by apamin, charybdotoxin (CTX), 4 -aminopyridine (4 -AP) or glibenclamide. In old tissues in which [Ca 2 +]i had previously been elevated with Ba 2 +, the ACh-induced Ca 2 + response was inhibited by CTX but not by apamin, 4 -AP or glibenclamide. It is concluded that in submucosal arterioles, ACh elevates endothelial [Ca 2 +]i and reduces muscular [Ca 2 +]i, probably through the hyperpolarization of endothelial or smooth muscle membrane by activating CTX-sensitive K+ channels...|$|E
40|$|Etomidate, one of {{the most}} potent general anesthetics used clinically, acts at micromolar {{concentrations}} as an anesthetic and positive allosteric modulator of gamma-aminobutyric acid responses, whereas it inhibits muscle-type nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) at concentrations above 10 microm. We report here that TDBzl-etomidate, a photoreactive etomidate analog, acts as a positive allosteric nAChR modulator rather than an inhibitor, and we identify its binding sites by photoaffinity labeling. TDBzl-etomidate (> 10 microm) increased the submaximal response to acetylcholine (10 microm) with a 2. 5 -fold increase at 60 microm. At higher concentrations, it inhibited the binding of the noncompetitive antagonists [(3) H]tetracaine and [(3) H]phencyclidine to Torpedo nAChR-rich membranes (IC(50) values of 0. 8 mm). nAChR-rich membranes were photolabeled with [(3) H]TDBzl-etomidate, and labeled amino acids were identified by Edman degradation. For nAChRs photolabeled in the absence of agonist (resting state), there was tetracaine-inhibitable photolabeling of amino acids in the ion channel at positions M 2 - 9 (deltaLeu- 265) and M 2 - 13 (alphaVal- 255 and deltaVal- 269), whereas labeling of alphaM 2 - 10 (alphaSer- 252) was not inhibited by tetracaine but was enhanced 10 -fold by <b>proadifen</b> or phencyclidine. In addition, there was labeling in gammaM 3 (gammaMet- 299), a residue that contributes to the same pocket in the nAChR structure as alphaM 2 - 10. The pharmacological specificity of labeling of residues, together with their locations in the nAChR structure, indicate that TDBzl-etomidate binds at two distinct sites: one within the lumen of the ion channel (labeling of M 2 - 9 and - 13), an inhibitory site, and another at the interface between the alpha and gamma subunits (labeling of alphaM 2 - 10 and gammaMet- 299) likely to be a site for positive allosteric modulation.

40|$|The nicotinic {{acetylcholine}} receptor (nAChR) and the Na,K-ATPase functionally interact in skeletal muscle (Krivoi, I. I., Drabkina, T. M., Kravtsova, V. V., Vasiliev, A. N., Eaton, M. J., Skatchkov, S. N., and Mandel, F. (2006) Pflugers Arch. 452, 756 – 765; Krivoi, I., Vasiliev, A., Kravtsova, V., Dobretsov, M., and Mandel, F. (2003) Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 986, 639 – 641). In this interaction, the specific binding of nanomolar concentrations of nicotinic agonists to the nAChR stimulates electrogenic transport by the Na,K-ATPase α 2 isozyme, causing membrane hyperpolarization. This study examines the molecular nature and membrane localization of this interaction. Stimulation of Na,K-ATPase activity by the nAChR does not require ion flow through open nAChRs. It can be induced by nAChR desensitization alone, {{in the absence of}} nicotinic agonist, and saturates when the nAChR is fully desensitized. It is enhanced by noncompetitive blockers of the nAChR (<b>proadifen,</b> QX- 222), which promote non-conducting or desensitized states; and retarded by tetracaine, which stabilizes the resting nAChR conformation. The interaction operates at the neuromuscular junction as well as on extrajunctional sarcolemma. The Na,K-ATPase α 2 isozyme is enriched at the postsynaptic neuromuscular junction and co-localizes with nAChRs. The nAChR and Na,K-ATPase α subunits specifically coimmunoprecipitate with each other, phospholemman, and caveolin- 3. In a purified membrane preparation from Torpedo californica enriched in nAChRs and the Na,K-ATPase, a ouabain-induced conformational change of the Na,K-ATPase enhances a conformational transition of the nAChR to a desensitized state. These results suggest a mechanism by which the nAChR in a desensitized state with high apparent affinity for agonist interacts with the Na,K-ATPase to stimulate active transport. The interaction utilizes a membrane-delimited complex involving protein-protein interactions, either directly or through additional protein partners. This interaction is expected to enhance neuromuscular transmission and muscle excitation...|$|E
