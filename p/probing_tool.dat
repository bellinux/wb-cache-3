40|$|Abstract—Application-layer {{multicast}} (ALM) {{has grown}} tremendously in recent years, making {{the distribution of}} bulk data such as streaming video economically feasible for small companies and even individuals. The efficiency of an ALM network depends on its data distribution overlay, which is constructed based on metrics such as round-trip time (RTT) measurement between peers. However Internet measurement experiments revealed that RTT is far from an accurate estimator of bandwidth availability and as such, may lead to sub-optimal performance in the constructed ALM overlays. This paper tackles this problem by developing a new in-band bandwidth <b>probing</b> <b>tool</b> which can estimate the amount of achievable bandwidth available in the target network path so that excess data traffic can be diverted from the congested path without causing new congestion in the target path. Moreover, the <b>probing</b> <b>tool</b> does not incur any bandwidth overhead as it piggybacks on the existing data flow. Simulation results show that multioverlay ALM networks constructed based on achievable bandwidth consistently out-performs RTT-based and residual bandwidthbased approaches in terms of data delivery ratio and video playback continuity. Moreover, the proposed bandwidth <b>probing</b> <b>tool</b> can be implemented entirely within the application and thus can be readily incorporated into existing ALM protocols.

40|$|Being {{one of the}} {{primitives}} of Internet {{measurement and}} security scanning, active probing has numerous applications. While the majority of existing <b>probing</b> <b>tools</b> were designed for PCs/servers, the wide adoption of mobile devices and embedded systems bring new requirements and challenges to active probing, for example, the limited resources in those devices may affect active probing's accuracy and efficiency. However, few research studies examine such impact. In this paper, we fill the gap by investigating the effect of resource-limited devices on common packet sending/receiving techniques used by <b>probing</b> <b>tools</b> and proposing kTRxer, a toolkit that can be run in many devices to help <b>probing</b> <b>tools</b> achieve better accuracy and efficiency. kTRxer mitigates the negative effect from devices by keeping away from noise sources and achieves portability by avoiding modifying specific device drivers. We have implemented kTRxer with 5489 lines of C codes and conducted extensive evaluation on three platforms, including PC, broadband router, and smartphone. The experimental results show that kTRxer can achieve up to 10 times transmission rate and introduce much less delay noise than existing approaches.

40|$|Measurement and {{estimation}} of packet loss characteristics are challenging {{due to the}} relatively rare occurrence and typically short duration of packet loss episodes. While active <b>probe</b> <b>tools</b> are commonly used to measure packet loss on end-to-end paths, {{there has been little}} analysis of the accuracy of these tools or their impact on the network. The objective of our study is to understand how to measure packet loss episodes accurately with end-to-end probes. We begin by testing the capability of standard Poisson-modulated end-to-end measurements of loss in a controlled laboratory environment using IP routers and commodity end hosts. Our tests show that loss characteristics reported from such Poisson-modulated <b>probe</b> <b>tools</b> can be quite inaccurate over a range of traffic conditions. Motivated by these observations, we introduce a new algorithm for packet loss measurement that is designed to overcome the deficiencies in standard Poisson-based tools. Specifically, our method creates a probe process that (1) enables an explicit trade-off between accuracy and impact on the network, and (2) enables more accurate measurements than standard Poisson probing at the same rate. We evaluate the capabilities of our methodology experimentally by developing and implementing a prototype tool, called BADABING. The experiments demonstrate the trade-offs between impact on the network and measurement accuracy. We show that BADABING reports loss characteristics far more accurately than traditional loss measurement tools...|$|R

The {{need to share}} data across {{multiple}} enterprises, different hardware platforms, different data storage paradigms and systems, {{and a variety of}} network architectures is growing. The emerging Standard for The Exchange of Product Model Data (STEP), being developed in the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), addresses this need by providing information models, called application protocols, which clearly and unambiguously describe data. The validity of these information models is essential for success in sharing data in a highly automated engineering environment.

In BH and FAT stations, first fluid indication was obtained in 18 and 27  min respectively after pumping was initiated. The major advantages of 3 D radial probe results from Well- 1 in comparison with a DP module in a similar environment is less inflation time (1 / 5 th), quick fluid detection since no sump volume to be pumped out (1 / 10 th time), focused fluid flow regime due to 3 D radial probe configuration (79.44  in 2  ×  4  − probe surface area), quick and reliable multiple deployment of packer to get a sweet point for fluid extraction, no severe hole sticking issues despite of having several held-ups and over pull during the job.
