5|$|Troponin I, slow {{skeletal}} muscle is a protein that in humans is encoded by the TNNI1 gene. An isoform switch from ssTnI to cTnI occurs during <b>perinatal</b> heart development. ssTnI is not {{expressed in the}} embryonic hearts of Xenopus and zebrafish, while it is expressed in the somites and {{skeletal muscle}}s.|$|E
5|$|It is a big, strong cat, {{similar to}} the Maine Coon breed, with long legs, a bushy tail and a sturdy body. The breed {{is very good at}} climbing, since they have strong claws. The {{lifespan}} is usually 14 to 16 years, though kidney and heart diseases {{have been reported in the}} breed. Specifically in this breed, complex rearrangements of glycogen branching enzyme (GBE1) can cause a <b>perinatal</b> hypoglycaemic collapse and a late-juvenile-onset neuromuscular degeneration in glycogen storage disease type IV.|$|E
5|$|Academics have {{researched}} its use {{for treatment}} of female sexual arousal disorder and chronic anorgasmiaa sexual dysfunction {{in which a person}} cannot achieve orgasm. The Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology published a 1979 study which found self-administered treatment and use of the Magic Wand to be the best method to achieve orgasm. In 2008, The Scientific World Journal published research finding over 93% of a group of 500 chronic anorgasmic women could reach orgasm using the Magic Wand and the Betty Dodson Method. The device was used in studies in many applications, including articles published in Dermatology Online Journal, Journal of Applied Physiology, Experimental Brain Research, Neuroscience Letters, and Journal of <b>Perinatal</b> & Neonatal Nursing.|$|E
5|$|Authors Lisa R. Baba, Jacqueline M. McGrath, and Jiexin Liu {{examined}} use of vibration {{delivery to}} infants to mitigate pain while doing heel stick procedures in a 2010 {{article for the}} Journal of <b>Perinatal</b> & Neonatal Nursing. Their sample size included 20 babies of age 35 weeks or more, and they tracked their subjects' levels of pain on the Neonatal Infant Pain Scale while giving mechanical vibration to alleviate discomfort for a heel stick procedure. Vibration was delivered using the Magic Wand, which they bought through Vibratex. They set the Magic Wand to the highest setting {{and placed it on}} the heel of the infant for five seconds before administering the heel stick procedure. Their results found that oscillation sensations delivered to newborns who had previously had discomfort from neonatal heel pricks were able to deliver some relief. They wrote that additional research was indicated in the form of a randomized clinical trial with a greater sample size of newborns.|$|E
5|$|Kidney {{and heart}} {{diseases}} {{have been reported}} in the breed. In an experiment directed by John C. Fyfea, Rebeccah L. Kurzhals, and others, it was concluded that a complex rearrangement in the breed's Glycogen branching enzyme (GBE1) can cause both a <b>perinatal</b> hypoglycemic collapse and a late-juvenile-onset neuromuscular degeneration in glycogen storage disease type IV in the breed. This disorder, while rare, can prove fatal to cats that have it. There are DNA tests available for GSD IV, and it is highly recommended (some cat associations obligate their Norwegian Forest cat breeder members) to carry out the DNA test before using such animals for breeding. PawPeds provide a pedigree database which comes together with health programmes, through publishing each single cat's test result, to provide useful information for breeders to make a well-informed breeding decision. The breed has also been known to suffer from hip dysplasia, which is a rare, partially hereditary disease of the hip joint.|$|E
5|$|On 2 June, and in {{response}} to a question from Fianna Fáil's James Browne about government spending on mental health, McEntee told the Dáil the government was committed to an annual increase in funding; Browne had noted that in 2014, €20 million had been allocated to mental health services rather than the promised €35 million, but McEntee said that €35 million had been ringfenced for 2016 and 2017. Along with Minister for Health Simon Harris, McEntee argued for the restoration of €12 million originally ringfenced for mental health spending that had been diverted to other areas. On 8 June, and as part of a €480m bailout package for health, the government announced that the mental health funding would be restored. Welcoming the decision, McEntee said the money would be used for staff recruitment and to improve services for homeless people, as well as developing <b>perinatal</b> mental health services.|$|E
5|$|Women {{experience}} many unique {{health issues}} related to reproduction and sexuality and these are responsible for {{a third of all}} health problems experienced by women during their reproductive years (aged 15–44), of which unsafe sex is a major risk factor, especially in developing countries. Reproductive health includes {{a wide range of issues}} including the health and function of structures and systems involved in reproduction, pregnancy, childbirth and child rearing, including antenatal and <b>perinatal</b> care. Global women's health has a much larger focus on reproductive health than that of developed countries alone, but also infectious diseases such as malaria in pregnancy and non-communicable diseases (NCD). Many of the issues that face women and girls in resource poor regions are relatively unknown in developed countries, such as female genital cutting, and further lack access to the appropriate diagnostic and clinical resources.|$|E
25|$|Untreated sexually {{transmitted}} infections {{are associated with}} congenital and <b>perinatal</b> infections in neonates, particularly in the areas where rates of infection remain high. The overall <b>perinatal</b> mortality rate associated with untreated syphilis, for example, is 30%.|$|E
25|$|His early findings, {{which were}} based on {{observations}} from LSD research, uncovered four major types of experiences that, according to Grof, correspond to levels in the human unconscious: (1) Abstract and aesthetic experiences; (2) Psychodynamic experiences; (3) <b>Perinatal</b> experiences; (4) Transpersonal experiences. Grof returns to many of these findings in later books. Psychodynamic levels, which correspond {{to the theory of}} Sigmund Freud, is the area of biographical memories, emotional problems, unresolved conflicts and fantasies. <b>Perinatal</b> levels, which correspond to the theories of Otto Rank, is the area of physical pain and agony, dying and death, biological birth, aging, disease and decrepitude. Transpersonal levels, corresponding to the theories of C.G. Jung, is the area of a number of spiritual, paranormal and transcendental experiences, including ESP phenomena, ego transcendence and other states of expanded consciousness. In order to bring structure to the psychodynamic and <b>perinatal</b> levels Grof introduces two governing systems, or organizing principles: The COEX-system, which is the governing system for the psychodynamic level, and the Basic <b>Perinatal</b> Matrices, which represent the birthing stages and is the governing system for the <b>perinatal</b> level.|$|E
25|$|Infant deaths (neonatal {{deaths from}} birth to 28 days, or <b>perinatal</b> deaths if {{including}} fetal deaths at 28 weeks gestation and later) are around 1% in modernized countries.|$|E
25|$|While rare, {{abdominal}} pregnancies have {{a higher}} chance of maternal mortality, <b>perinatal</b> mortality and morbidity compared to normal and ectopic pregnancies; on occasion, however, a healthy viable infant can be delivered.|$|E
25|$|In mouse, NEDD4-2 {{deletion}} {{leads to}} increased cell surface expression and activity of ENaC in the lung, resulting in premature clearance of lung fluid, airway drying, lung inflammation and <b>perinatal</b> lethality.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Perinatal</b> Hospice {{was founded}} in 2007 {{to meet the needs}} of parents who {{discover}} early in pregnancy that their baby is nonviable outside the womb, and yet chose to carry their baby to term.|$|E
25|$|Some of Lincoln Medical and Mental Health Center's {{specialty}} services include: AIDS Center; Asthma Treatment; Diabetes Treatment; Level III <b>Perinatal</b> Center; Regional Trauma Center; Stroke Center; Women's Health Center; Child and Teen Health Services; SAFE (SART) Center.|$|E
25|$|On 9 June 2011, Malaysians protested in Kuala Lumpur against {{electoral fraud}} perpetrated {{by the ruling}} party Barisan Nasional. Barisan Nasional and its predecessor, <b>Perinatal</b> (the Alliance), has been Malaysia's federal ruling force since {{independence}} from the British in 1957.|$|E
25|$|Pre-eclampsia {{is one of}} {{the leading}} causes of {{maternal}} and <b>perinatal</b> morbidity and mortality worldwide. Nearly one-tenth of all maternal deaths in Africa and Asia and one-quarter in Latin America are associated with hypertensive diseases in pregnancy, a category that encompasses pre-eclampsia.|$|E
25|$|A {{strong family}} {{is the basis of}} a healthy society. The party {{supports}} affordable housing through state mortgages with a 3% annual percentage rate, social contracts with employers, financial aid for newborns (to be doubled in 2017), <b>perinatal</b> centers in each region and the upgrading of maternity homes.|$|E
25|$|Obstetric complications: {{prenatal}} and <b>perinatal</b> complications may factor {{into the}} development of anorexia nervosa, such as maternal anemia, diabetes mellitus, preeclampsia, placental infarction, and neonatal cardiac abnormalities. Neonatal complications may also have an influence on harm avoidance, one of the personality traits associated with {{the development of}} AN.|$|E
25|$|Pre-eclampsia is also {{associated}} with increased frequency of Caesarian section, preterm delivery, and placental abruption. Furthermore, an elevation in blood pressure can occur in some individuals {{in the first week}} postpartum attributable to volume expansion and fluid mobilization. Fetal complications include fetal growth restriction and potential fetal or <b>perinatal</b> death.|$|E
25|$|Restrictive dermopathy (RD), {{also called}} tight skin {{contracture}} syndrome, is a rare, lethal autosomal recessive <b>perinatal</b> genodermatosis. Two known causes of RD are mutations in the LMNA gene, {{which lead to}} the production of truncated prelamin A precursor, and insertions in the ZMPSTE24, which lead to a premature stop codon.|$|E
25|$|This is {{from mother}} to child (more rarely father to child), often in utero, during {{childbirth}} (also {{referred to as}} <b>perinatal</b> infection) or during postnatal physical contact between parents and offspring. In mammals, including humans, it occurs also via breast milk. Infectious diseases that can be transmitted in this way include: HIV, hepatitis B and syphilis. Many mutualistic organisms are transmitted vertically.|$|E
25|$|Exposure to {{fluoxetine}} {{has been}} demonstrated to increase serotonergic activity in fish, subsequently reducing aggressive behavior. <b>Perinatal</b> exposure to fluoxetine at relevant environmental concentrations {{has been shown to}} lead to significant modifications of memory processing in 1-month-old cuttlefish. This impairment may disadvantage cuttlefish and decrease their survival. Somewhat less than 10% of orally administered fluoxetine is excreted from humans unchanged or as glucuronide.|$|E
25|$|Rahat as a {{city has}} a number of public services, {{including}} medical services, schooling, labor, shopping, etc. There are branches of several health funds (medical clinics) in Rahat: Leumit, Clalit, Maccabi and several <b>perinatal</b> (baby care) centers Tipat Halav. In 2004 a new police station was opened, and has around 70 staff policemen. There is a community center in Rahat with a number of clubs for youth.|$|E
25|$|The {{effect of}} {{education}} has been seen in Madagascar's infant mortality rate. According to Maryanne Sharp and Ioana Kruse of the World Bank note that mothers who have finished their secondary education experience fewer than forty to {{fifty percent of the}} infant deaths experienced by women with less education. Younger women are also less likely to have babies who die while young. The average <b>perinatal</b> mortality rate has decreased since 2003.|$|E
25|$|Further {{variability}} {{is introduced}} by the degree of enzyme inefficiency produced by the specific alleles each patient has. Some alleles result in more severe degrees of enzyme inefficiency. In general, severe degrees of inefficiency produce changes in the fetus and problems in prenatal or <b>perinatal</b> life. Milder degrees of inefficiency are usually associated with excessive or deficient sex hormone effects in childhood or adolescence, while the mildest forms of CAH interfere with ovulation and fertility in adults.|$|E
25|$|It is {{generally}} recommended {{to perform a}} laparotomy when the diagnosis of an abdominal pregnancy is made. However, if the baby is alive and medical support systems are in place, careful watching could be considered to bring the baby to viability. Women with an abdominal pregnancy will not go into labor. Delivery {{in a case of}} an advanced abdominal pregnancy will have to be via laparotomy. The survival of the baby is reduced and high <b>perinatal</b> mortality rates between 40–95% have been reported.|$|E
25|$|In primates, the {{developmental}} influence of androgens is less clear, {{and the consequences}} are less understood. Within the brain, testosterone is aromatized to (estradiol), which is the principal active hormone for developmental influences. The human testis secretes high levels of testosterone from about week 8 of fetal life until 5–6 months after birth (a similar <b>perinatal</b> surge in testosterone is observed in many species), a process that appears to underlie the male phenotype. Estrogen from the maternal circulation is relatively ineffective, {{partly because of the}} high circulating levels of steroid-binding proteins in pregnancy.|$|E
25|$|The Bedouin {{benefited from}} the {{introduction}} of modern {{health care in the}} region. According to the World Zionist Organization, although in the 1980s, as compared with 90% of the Jewish population, only 50% of the Bedouin population was covered by Israel's General Sick Fund, the situation improved after the 1995 National Health Insurance Law incorporated another 30% of Negev Bedouin into the Sick Fund. There are branches of several health funds (medical clinics) operating in the seven Bedouin townships: Leumit, Clalit, Maccabi and <b>perinatal</b> (baby care) centers Tipat Halav.|$|E
25|$|Breastfeeding {{research}} {{focuses on}} diverse aspects such as prevalence, HIV transmission, pharmacology, costs, benefits, immunology, contraindications, and comparisons to synthetic breast milk substitutes. Factors related to {{the mental health of}} the nursing mother in the <b>perinatal</b> period have been studied. While cognitive behavior therapy may be the treatment of choice, medications are sometimes used. The use of therapy rather than medication reduces the infant's exposure to medication that may be transmitted through the milk. In coordination with institutional organisms, researchers are also studying the social impact of brestfeeding throughout history. Accordingly, strategies have been developed to foster the increase of the breastfeedingrates in the different countries.|$|E
25|$|Diagnostic efforts then {{shift to}} {{determining}} the type- elevated ammonia levels or abnormal organic acids can indicate specific, rare types. Intrauterine growth retardation and other <b>perinatal</b> problems raise {{the possibility of}} transience, while large birthweight suggests {{one of the more}} persistent conditions. Genetic screening is now available within a useful time frame for some of the specific conditions.It is worthwhile to identify the minority of severe cases with focal forms of hyperinsulinism because these can be completely cured by partial pancreatectomy. A variety of pre-operative diagnostic procedures have been investigated but none has been established as infallibly reliable. Positron emission tomography is becoming the most useful imaging technique.|$|E
25|$|Stanislav Grof, on {{the other}} hand, {{operates}} with a cartography consisting of three kinds of territories: {{the realm of the}} sensory barrier and the personal unconscious (described by psychoanalysis), the <b>perinatal</b> or birth-related realm (organizing principles for the psyche), and the transpersonal realm. According to this view proper engagement with the first two realms sets the stage for an ascent to the third, transpersonal, realm. His early therapy, and research, was carried out with the aid of psychedelic substances such as lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), psilocybin, mescaline, dipropyl-tryptamine (DPT), and methylene-dioxy-amphetamine (MDA). Later, when LSD was prohibited, Grof developed other methods of therapy, such as holotropic breathwork.|$|E
25|$|Hepatitis {{can also}} occur in {{neonates}} and {{is attributable to}} a variety of causes, some of which are not typically seen in adults. Congenital or <b>perinatal</b> infection with the hepatitis viruses, toxoplasma, rubella, cytomegalovirus, and syphilis can cause neonatal hepatitis. Structural abnormalities such as biliary atresia and choledochal cysts can lead to cholestatic liver injury leading to neonatal hepatitis. Metabolic diseases such as glycogen storage disorders and lysosomal storage disorders are also implicated. Neonatal hepatitis can be idiopathic, and in such cases, biopsy often shows large multinucleated cells in the liver tissue. This disease is termed giant cell hepatitis and may be associated with viral infection, autoimmune disorders, and drug toxicity.|$|E
25|$|As the Interim Deputy Director for Science and Public Health Program at the CDC from February 2009 to June 2009, Schuchat {{focused on}} {{ensuring}} strong science and programmatic approaches were effectively integrated into planning across the agency. She has emphasized prevention {{of infectious diseases}} in children. Her emphasis on <b>perinatal</b> group B streptococcal disease prevention {{has led to an}} 80 percent reduction in newborn infections and a 75 percent narrowing of racial disparities among sufferers of this infectious disease. She has been instrumental in pre- and post-licensure evaluations of conjugate vaccines for bacterial meningitis and pneumonia and in accelerating availability of these new vaccines in resource-poor countries through WHO and the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization.|$|E
25|$|In 2002, {{there were}} 0.58 new general {{practitioner}} (medical) consultations and 0.33 new specialist consultations per capita, and a hospital admission rate of 8.1%. Preventive {{health care is}} also successful. In 2002, 96% of Costa Rican women used some form of contraception, and antenatal care services were provided to 87% of all pregnant women. All children under one have access to well-baby clinics, and the immunization coverage rate in 2002 was above 91% for all antigens. Costa Rica has a very low malaria incidence of 48 per 100,000 in 2000 and no reported cases of measles in 2002. The <b>perinatal</b> mortality rate dropped from 12.0 per 1000 in 1972 to 5.4 per 1000 in 2001.|$|E
25|$|AZT {{is now a}} {{principal}} part of the clinical pathway for both pre-exposure prophylaxis and post-exposure treatment of mother-to-child transmission of HIV during pregnancy, labor, and delivery and has been proven to be integral to uninfected siblings' <b>perinatal</b> and neonatal development. Without AZT, as many as 10 to 15% of fetuses with HIV-infected mothers will themselves become infected. AZT {{has been shown to}} reduce this risk to as little as 8% when given in a three-part regimen post-conception, delivery, and six weeks post-delivery. Consistent and proactive precautionary measures, such as the rigorous use of antiretroviral medications, cesarean section, face masks, heavy-duty rubber gloves, clinically segregated disposable diapers, and avoidance of mouth contact will further reduce child-attendant transmission of HIV to as little as 1–2%.|$|E
25|$|According to Gillberg, {{clinically}} severe form DAMP (or ADHD+DCD) affects about 1.5% of {{the general}} population of school age children; another few per cent are affected by more moderate variants. Boys are overrepresented; girls are currently probably underdiagnosed. There are many overlapping conditions, including conduct disorder, depression/anxiety, and academic failure. There is a strong link with autism spectrum disorders in severe DAMP. Familial factors and pre- and <b>perinatal</b> risk factors account for much of the variance. Psychosocial risk factors appear to increase the risk of marked psychiatric abnormality in DAMP. Outcome in early adult age was psychosocially poor in one study in almost 60% of unmedicated cases. About half of all cases with ADHD have DCD, and conversely, ADHD occurs in about half of all cases of DCD.|$|E
