5|$|Due to the {{physical}} similarities which they share, the group 12 elements {{can be found in}} many common situations. Zinc and cadmium are commonly used as anti-corrosion (galvanization) agents as they will attract all local oxidation until they completely corrode. These <b>protective</b> <b>coatings</b> can be applied to other metals through by hot-dip galvanizing a substance into the molten form of the metal, or through the process of electroplating which may be passivated by the use of chromate salts. Group 12 elements are also used in electrochemistry as they may act {{as an alternative to the}} standard hydrogen electrode in addition to being a secondary reference electrode.|$|E
5|$|In mid-July, {{the female}} Polish {{cochineal}} lays approximately 600-700 eggs, encased {{with a white}} waxy ootheca, in the ground. When the larvae hatch in late August or early September, they do not leave the egg case but remain inside {{until the end of}} winter. In late March or early April, the larvae emerge from the ground to feed for a short time on the low-growing leaves of the host plant before returning underground to feed on the plant's roots. At this point, the larvae undergo ecdysis, shedding their exoskeletons together with their legs and antennae, and they encyst by forming outer <b>protective</b> <b>coatings</b> (cysts) within the root tissues.|$|E

25|$|The {{application}} of plasma polymers as coatings {{has also been}} studied. Plasma polymers formed from tetramethoxysilane have been studied as <b>protective</b> <b>coatings</b> and have shown to increase the hardness of polyethylene and polycarbonate. The use of plasma polymers to coat plastic lenses is increasing in popularity. Plasma depositions are able to easily coat curved materials with a good uniformity, {{such as those of}} bifocals. The different plasma polymers used can be not only scratch resistant, but also hydrophobic leading to anti-fogging effects.|$|E
25|$|Sulfates (SO4) in {{the soil}} or in groundwater, in {{sufficient}} concentration, can react with the Portland cement in concrete causing the formation of expansive products, e.g., ettringite or thaumasite, {{which can lead to}} early failure of the structure. The most typical attack of this type is on concrete slabs and foundation walls at grades where the sulfate ion, via alternate wetting and drying, can increase in concentration. As the concentration increases, the attack on the Portland cement can begin. For buried structures such as pipe, this type of attack is much rarer, especially in the eastern United States. The sulfate ion concentration increases much slower {{in the soil}} mass and is especially dependent upon the initial amount of sulfates in the native soil. A chemical analysis of soil borings to check for the presence of sulfates should be undertaken during the design phase of any project involving concrete in contact with the native soil. If the concentrations are found to be aggressive, various <b>protective</b> <b>coatings</b> can be applied. Also, in the US ASTM C150 Type 5 Portland cement can be used in the mix. This type of cement is designed to be particularly resistant to a sulfate attack.|$|E
500|$|The Inch {{pipelines}} {{are listed}} on the National Register of Historic Places. Along the western parts of the pipelines, around 90 percent of the pipes are the original installation, although in the east large parts have since been replaced, {{largely due to the}} absence of anti-corrosion <b>protective</b> <b>coatings</b> on the original piping. 62 of the original buildings from 1942 and 1943 remain, including pump-houses, offices, employee houses and garages.

2500|$|This species' {{reputation}} as a public nuisance is due not to any bite or sting (it is incapable of either), but to its slightly acidic body chemistry. Because airborne lovebugs can exist in enormous numbers near highways, they die in large numbers on automobile windshields, hoods, and radiator grills when the vehicles travel at high speeds. If left {{for more than an}} hour or two, the remains become extremely difficult to remove. Their body chemistry has a nearly neutral 6.5 pH but may become acidic at 4.25 pH if left on the car for a day. [...] In the past, the acidity of the dead adult body, especially the female's egg masses, often resulted in pits and etches in automotive paint and chrome if not quickly removed. [...] However, advances in automotive paints and <b>protective</b> <b>coatings</b> have reduced this threat significantly. Now the greatest concern is excessive clogging of vehicle radiator air passages with the bodies of the adults, with the reduction of the cooling effect on engines, and the obstruction of windshields when the remains of the adults and egg masses are smeared on the glass.|$|E
