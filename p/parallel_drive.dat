5000|$|Bourdieu's {{principle}} of habitus is interwoven {{with the concept}} of structuralism in literary theory. Peter Barry explains, [...] "in the structuralist approach to literature there is a constant movement away from interpretation of the individual literary work and a <b>parallel</b> <b>drive</b> towards understanding the larger structures which contain them" [...] (2009, p. 39). There is therefore a strong desire to understand the larger influencing factors which makes an individual literary work. As Bourdieu explains, habitus [...] "are structured structures, generative principles of distinct and distinctive practices - what the worker eats, and especially the way he eats it, the sport he practices and the way he practices it, his political opinions and the way he expresses them are systematically different from the industrial proprietor's corresponding activities / habitus are also structuring structures, different classifying schemes classification principles, different principles of vision and division, different tastes. Habitus make different differences; they implement distinctions between what is good and what is bad, what is right and what is wrong, between what is distinguished and what is vulgar, and so on, but they are not the same. Thus, for instance, the same behaviour or even the same good can appear distinguished to one person, pretentious to someone else, and cheap or showy to yet another" [...] (Bourdieu, 1996). As a result, habitus may be employed in literary theory in order to understand those larger, external structures which influence individual theories and works of literature.|$|E

40|$|With the {{increasing}} requirements on speed and accuracy in current day manipulators, flexibility effects have become important. In this paper, the flexural dynamics of a <b>parallel</b> <b>drive</b> five bar manipulator are studied. The <b>parallel</b> <b>drive</b> five bar configuration {{is a very}} attractive design due to its considerably simplified rigid body dynamics. Specifically, the equations of motion for an inertia invariant five bar manipulator are given {{by a pair of}} linear time invariant (LTI) differential equations. This permits application of existing single axis servo control techniques to the control of such a manipulator. Besides, strategies such as direct drive actuation, etc., are also easily implemented. These lead to increased accuracy, better control performance and less uncertainty. It is shown in this paper that the simplicity afforded to the rigid body dynamics of the <b>parallel</b> <b>drive</b> five bar configuration also extends to its flexural dynamics. The elastic vibrations of the manipulator are also modeled by a set of linear time invariant differential equations. Also, when (invariant) modal coordinates are used to model the elastic vibrations, it is seen that the number of equations representing the flexural dynamics of the manipulator equals the number of modes under consideration. For the five bar example presented in this paper, only three modes were found to be significant. Thus, the overall dynamics of the manipulator (rigid body and flexural) is represented by a set of five decoupled linear time invariant differential equations. Such a model does not involve any more approximation than that of ignoring higher modes. Thus, this permits real time control of the manipulator based on an accurate linear time invariant model.

It has two rotors and two sets of stator windings, and it can adopt a series drive mode or <b>parallel</b> <b>drive</b> mode. The fault-tolerance capability of the five-phase DRPMSM is researched. All open circuit fault types and corresponding fault tolerance techniques in different drive modes are analyzed. A fault-tolerance control strategy of injecting currents containing a certain third harmonic component is proposed for five-phase DRPMSM to ensure performance after faults in the motor or drive circuit. For adjacent double-phase faults in the motor, based on where the additional degrees of freedom are used, two different fault-tolerance current calculation schemes are adopted and the torque results are compared. Decoupling of the inner motor and outer motor is investigated under fault-tolerant conditions in <b>parallel</b> <b>drive</b> mode.
