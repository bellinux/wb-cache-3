30|$|Increased {{intracranial}} pressure {{was associated with}} a decrease in CPP and a drop of intracranial compliance.

In our model, clinical signs of brain death were evident after 1  h of negative CPP in all animals, including assessment of corneal reflex, coughing in response to tracheal suctioning and execution of an apnea test. Moreover, in a subset of animals, the absence of brain perfusion was confirmed by electroencephalography.|$|R

5000|$|Thomas Neil Thomas {{was born}} in Lawrence, Pennsylvania. He went to the Pittsburgh Playhouse School of Theatre from 1958 to 1960 before {{attending}} Carnegie Mellon University. In 1966 he {{became a member of}} the American Conservatory Theatre under the helm of William Ball. He received the Cameron Overseas Grant from CMU to study in Europe where he joined the Young Vic. Upon returning to America in 1967, he joined the faculty at Point Park College in Pittsburgh, where he led the theatre department from 1974 to 1977. He became artistic director at the Pittsburgh Playhouse and also was the artistic director for the Pittsburgh Civic Light Opera in 1972, where he directed the entire inaugural season at newly restored Heinz Hall. In 1974 he was honored as [...] "Man of the Year in Theatre" [...] by the Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania Jaycees. He began his career in theatre at Little Lake Theatre in Canonsburg, Pennsylvania, where he acted in or directed 30 plays from 1958 to 1964. In 1965 he was the co-producer and director at The Rabbit Run Theatre in Madison, Ohio and later at The Odd Chair Playhouse in Bethel Park, Pa. He has been the author of a number of screenplays, including episodes for Hotel, Hill Street Blues and A Year in the Life. He wrote and co-produced the pilot for the proposed series [...] "Private Sessions" [...] starring Mike Farrell and Maureen Stapleton. On July 2, 2014 he married Janis V. <b>Purins</b> (a.k.a.

40|$|Although {{the use of}} new {{immunosuppressive}} drugs, {{and their}} combination have drastically reduced the incidence of acute rejections, the graft survival is unchanged {{in the last ten}} years. The immunosuppressive drugs can be divided in four classes, according to their different site of molecular action: proliferative signal inhibitors, amplification signal inhibitors; STATs inhibitors, DNA synthesis inhibitors. Steroids act on immune system through several mechanisms. Azathioprine is an anti-metabolite that inhibits de-novo synthesis of <b>purins,</b> acting on S-phase of cellular cycle. Mycophenolate-Mofetil (MMF) is also an anti-metabolite, purine synthesis inhibitor that, differently from azathioprine, acts specifically on IMPDH (Inositolmonophosphate-dehydrogenasis) through a non-competitive mechanism. Calcineurin inhibitors (cyclosporin and tacrolimus) act on amplification of intracellular signal. The most important therapeutic side-effect of calcineurin inhibitors is the nephrotoxicity. Other inhibitor agents of the amplification signal are monoclonal antibodies anti-á chain of IL- 2 (CD 25). Another drug used in the last years, is sirolimus (SRL) or rapamycine, an immunosuppressive agent that act, through the inhibition of T lymphocyte activation...|$|R

We report crystal structures of the periplasmic domains of three PCPs that impart substantially different chain length distributions to surface polysaccharides. Despite very low sequence similarities, they have a common protomer structure with a long central -helix extending 100 Å into the periplasm. The protomers self-assemble into bell-shaped oligomers of variable sizes, with a large internal cavity.

Functional studies suggest that the top of the PCP oligomers is an important region for determining polysaccharide modal length.

The explanation will come in 2001 by the description from the relation between the vitamin deficiencies among treated patients and occurred from toxicities. The two randomized studies carried out in the malignant pleural mesothelioma and the non small cell lung cancer made it possible to establish its utility and to record the pemetrexed in these clinical situations. Others axes of development remain possible, but the results are stanby or to confirm as in squamous-cell cancer in the head and neck and breast, digestive or urinary tracts cancer.

The G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) are among the most successful and promising target proteins for drug discovery and therapeutic research. GPCR are frequently overexpressed in cancer cells, an interesting property for tumor imaging or for a targeted radiotherapy, using radiolabeled ligand derivatives. The tumor microenvironment contains a number of GPCR ligands (e. g., bioactive peptides, biogenic amines, <b>purins,</b> chemokines), known to regulate the proliferation, migration or survival of both tumoral and neural cells and that may be key actors of the neuro-neoplastic interactions. Here will be reviewed the potential utilization of substances that target a selected choice of GPCR, especially neuropeptide receptors, for a novel concept of therapy, concerning the numerous types of cancers where neurons infiltrate the tumoral mass or those where the malignant cells invade nerve branches (perineural invasion). Some molecular mechanisms linked to these GPCR (or linking GPCR to other types of membrane receptors or co-receptors), involved in these processes, will also be considered...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background The G-protein-coupled {{receptor}} (GPCR) family {{represents the}} largest and most important group of targets for chemotherapeutics. They are extremely versatile receptors that transduce signals as diverse as biogenic amines, <b>purins,</b> odorants, ions and pheromones from the extracellular compartment to the interior via biochemical processes involving GTP-binding proteins. Until recently, the cyclic AMP receptors (cARs) were the only known G protein coupled receptors in Dictyostelium discoideum. The completed genome sequence revealed the presence of several families of GPCRs in Dictyostelium, among them members of the family 3 of GPCRs, the GABA B /glutamate like receptor family, which in higher eukaryotes is involved in neuronal signaling. Results D. discoideum has seventeen Family 3 members of GPCRs, denoted GrlA through GrlR. Their transcripts are detected throughout development with increased levels during early and late development. We have examined here GrlJ. GFP-tagged GrlJ localises to the plasmamembrane and to internal membranes. Inactivation of the grlJ gene leads to precocious development, and the mutant completes development ~ 6 hours earlier. Alterations were also noted at the slug stage and in spore formation. grlJ - slugs were longer and broke apart several times on their way to culmination forming smaller but proportionate fruiting bodies. Spores from grlJ - fruiting bodies were malformed and less viable, although the spore differentiation factors were synthesized and sensed normally. Expression of a GFP-tagged full length GrlJ rescued the phenotype. Conclusion Our data suggest that GrlJ acts at several stages of Dictyostelium development and that it is a negative regulator in Dictyostelium development. </p...|$|R
40|$|Regulation of {{the length}} of the O-antigen (Oag) chain {{attached}} to LPS in Shigella flexneri is important for virulence and is dependent on the inner-membrane protein Wzz. A lack of high-resolution structural data for Wzz has hampered efforts so far to correlate mutations affecting function of Wzz with structure and describe a mechanism for chain length regulation. Here we have used secondary structure prediction to show that the periplasmic domain of the Wzz(pHS 2) protein has three regions of significant coiled-coil (CC) potential, two of which lie within an extended helical region. We describe here the first site-directed mutagenesis study to investigate the role of individual predicted CC regions (CCRs) in Wzz function and oligomerization. We found that CCRs 2 and 3 are necessary for wild-type Oag chain length regulation by Wzz(pHS 2). The in vivo cross-linking profile of mutants affected in the three CCRs was not altered, indicating that individually each CCR is not required for oligomerization. Interestingly, the CCR 3 mutation resulted in a temperature-sensitive phenotype and an inhibitory effect on Oag polymerization. Analysis of Wzz(pHS 2) and the mutant constructs in a S. flexneri degP mutant showed that DegP did not affect the function of wild-type Wzz(pHS 2) but its presence influenced the phenotype of the Wzz(pHS 2) CCR 3 mutant. Additionally, the phenotype of the Wzz(pHS 2) CCR 3 mutant was suppressed by a cis mutation near the putative cytoplasmic C-terminus of Wzz(pHS 2).
