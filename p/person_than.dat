25|$|The {{speaking}} dialect or accent of {{a person}} may differ greatly from the general singing accent that a person uses while singing. When people sing, they generally use the accent or neutral accent that {{is used in the}} style of music they are singing in, rather than a regional accent or dialect; the style of music and the popular center/region of the style has more influence on the singing accent of a <b>person</b> <b>than</b> where they come from. For example, in the English language, British singers of rock or popular music often sing in an American accent or neutral accent instead of an English accent.|$|E

25|$|And on an {{absolute}} basis, based on Table II.B.1 and IV.C.1 of the 2016 Medicare Trustees report, in 2015 the Medicare Trustees spent 4% less on Medicare Advantage and other Part C beneficiaries per <b>person</b> <b>than</b> they did per person on Medicare beneficiaries under FFS Medicare. In 2014 {{the difference in}} parity on {{an absolute}} basis was 2% less per person on Part C of Medicare based on the Medicare Trustees report in 2015.

500|$|Iginla is {{well known}} for his kind-hearted nature.

He excused himself from the conversation, and booked them accommodations at his own expense at the hotel his family was staying in.|$|E
500|$|In 1999, when Taylor became {{eligible}} for the Pro Football Hall of Fame, there were some concerns that his hard-partying lifestyle and drug abuse would hurt his candidacy. These concerns proved to be ill-founded, however, as he was voted in on the first ballot. His son Lawrence Taylor Jr. gave his introduction speech at the induction ceremony. Taylor's ex-wife, his three children, and his parents were in attendance and during his induction speech Taylor acknowledged them saying, [...] "hank you for putting up with me for all those years."

500|$|At {{the end of}} the {{previous}} episode, Olivia Dunham (Anna Torv) was able to cross over back to her universe long enough to warn Peter Bishop (Joshua Jackson) she is trapped in the parallel universe. After receiving the message, Peter tests the Olivia from the other dimension, [...] "Fauxlivia", by telling her the Greek phrase Na einai kalytero anthropo apo ton patera tou (roughly, [...] "May he be a better <b>person</b> <b>than</b> his father"), which Olivia told Peter in the [...] "New Day in the Old Town". When Fauxlivia fails to recognize the phrase, Peter confirms his suspicions. Realizing she has been exposed, Fauxlivia forces Peter to inject himself with a paralyzing agent. She then goes to a typewriter store in the Bronx to contact the parallel universe to request an extraction.|$|E

500|$|Estimated {{to contain}} over two million trees, Sheffield has more trees per <b>person</b> <b>than</b> {{any other city}} in Europe, and {{according}} to Sheffield City Council, it is England's greenest city, a claim that was reinforced when it won the 2005 Entente Florale competition.

Added to the [...] of national park and [...] of water this means that 61% {{of the city is}} greenspace.

Peter Ross of The Scotsman cites another interview, {{in which she was}} repeatedly questioned about her views on the UK Trident programme. But he describes her in person as [...] "articulate, reflective, self-deprecating and at times very funny. It would be unfair to condemn her for not being a sound-bite politician; she ought to be applauded for it, but the trouble is we live in a sound-bite age." [...] Mandy Rhodes of Holyrood magazine writes, [...] "despite a reputation as being a bit of a fierce one, [...] is actually, really rather entertaining, engaging and wonderfully self-deprecating."

500|$|In the [...] "Inside the Episode" [...] {{featurette}} {{published by}} HBO {{shortly after the}} airing of [...] "The Broken Man", series co-creators David Benioff and D. B.

David Benioff began by speaking about Sandor [...] "the Hound" [...] Clegane, saying [...] "I think suffering a near death experience probably changes anyone, and that certainly has changed Sandor Clegane. He's a more thoughtful <b>person</b> <b>than</b> he was when we last saw him, he's probably more aware of his vulnerabilities, he knows how close he came to dying, and he's really thinking about his past in a way that he never had before." [...] Weiss continued, [...] "The unfortunate, ugly reality of the kind of pacifism that Ray is preaching is often suicidal when you're {{in the middle of the}} kind of world that they're all in. Something sad about the fact that this person who tried desperately to walk away from what he was is being given no real choice but to go full throttle back in the direction of what he really is, which is a killer." ...|$|E
500|$|From 1380 until 1384, Paul {{remained}} at his see in Negroponte. A relative of his, George Tagaris—probably a different <b>person</b> <b>than</b> Manuel Tagaris' son—was {{called in to}} help with the administration of the patriarchal domains. His tenure was troubled, as the local Orthodox clergy appealed to the Venetian authorities for protection against his exactions, while the Latin Archbishop of Athens, Antonio Ballester, complained of the Patriarch's interference in his diocese. Furthermore, his lease of some of the Church lands in 1383 to a Venetian from Crete, Giacomo Grimani, proved a source of protracted legal trouble since Grimani, {{in the words of the}} French medievalist Raymond-Joseph Loenertz, [...] "revealed himself as much a scoundrel as the Patriarch". In 1384, Paul was once again denounced as an impostor to the Pope, possibly by Ballester, who was named vicar-general of the Patriarchate in the same year, and who had held the same office during the 1378–79 vacancy. Paul had apparently left his diocese before his denunciation, and resumed his wanderings. In 1385, he was in Cyprus, where he crowned James of Lusignan as King of Cyprus in exchange for 30,000 gold coins, and continued granting ecclesiastical appointments on the island as if he were still patriarch.|$|E

500|$|Broadly, {{the critics}} did not welcome Fleming's {{experiment}} with the Bond formula; academic Christoph Linder {{has pointed out that}} The Spy Who Loved Me received the worst reception of all the Bond books. The Daily Telegraph, for example, wrote [...] "Oh Dear Oh Dear Oh Dear! And to think of the books Mr Fleming once wrote!" [...] while The Glasgow Herald thought Fleming was finished: [...] "His ability to invent a plot has deserted him almost entirely and he has had to substitute for a fast-moving story the sorry misadventures of an upper-class tramp, told in dreary detail." [...] Writing in The Observer, Maurice Richardson described the tale as [...] "a new and regrettable if not altogether unreadable variation", going on to hope that [...] "this doesn't spell the total eclipse of Bond in a blaze of cornography". Richardson ended his piece by berating Fleming, asking [...] "why can't this cunning author write up a bit instead of down?" [...] The critic for The Times was not dismissive of Bond, whom they describe as [...] "less a <b>person</b> <b>than</b> a cult" [...] who is [...] "ruthlessly, fashionably efficient in both love and war". Rather, the critic dismisses the experiment, writing that [...] "the novel lacks Mr. Fleming's usual careful construction and must be written off as a disappointment". John Fletcher thought that it was [...] "as if Mickey Spillane had tried to gatecrash his way into the Romantic Novelists' Association".|$|E
500|$|The first {{reference}} to 3 John {{is in the}} middle of the third century; Eusebius says that Origen knew of both 2 and 3 John, however Origen is reported as saying [...] "all do not consider them genuine". Similarly, Pope Dionysius of Alexandria, Origen's pupil, was aware of a [...] "reputed Second or Third Epistle of John". Also around this time 3 John is thought to have been known in North Africa as it was referred to in the Sententiae Episcoporum produced by the Seventh Council of Carthage. There was doubt about the authority of 3 John, however, with Eusebius listing it and 2 John as [...] "disputed books" [...] despite describing them as [...] "well-known and acknowledged by most". Although Eusebius believed the Apostle wrote the Gospel and the epistles, it is likely that doubt about the fidelity of the author of 2 and 3 John was a factor in causing them to be disputed. By the end of the fourth century the Presbyter (author of 2 and 3 John) was thought to be a different <b>person</b> <b>than</b> the Apostle John. This opinion, although reported by Jerome, was not held by all, as Jerome himself attributed the epistles to John the Apostle. One factor which helps explain the late attestation of 3 John and the doubts about its authority is the very short nature of the letter; early writers may simply not have had occasion to quote from it.|$|E
500|$|In the {{parallel}} universe, Fauxlivia (Anna Torv) is returned home {{by her mother}} Marilyn (Amy Madigan) after undergoing a pre-natal test {{to see if she}} has viral propagated eclampsia, a virus that killed her sister and sister's baby during childbirth. She believes she is being followed, and contacts Lincoln Lee (Seth Gabel) at the Fringe division, who sends over a security detail. By the time they arrive, Fauxlivia has been kidnapped; though they try to follow a secret tracker each agent carries, her abductors have extracted it to throw Fringe off their tracks. Walternate (John Noble) and Lincoln believe the abduction to be an inside job due to this. Astrid Farnsworth (Jasika Nicole) identifies a vehicle that has passed by Fauxlivia's home at a high frequency, that being the taxi that belongs to Henry (Andre Royo). Lincoln and Charlie (Kirk Acevedo) track down Henry, who explains he has been keeping an eye on Fauxlivia, surprised to have seen her return and seeming like a different <b>person</b> <b>than</b> his previous encounters with her; Henry is unaware that he had actually helped the prime universe's Olivia to escape ("Olivia" [...] and [...] "The Abducted"). Lincoln, suspicious of these events, forces Walternate to admit that Fauxlivia was switched with Olivia, and that the child Fauxlivia carries is his grandchild. Meanwhile, Marilyn learns that Fauxlivia's test for the virus is positive and warns Charlie that Fauxlivia will die if she has the child.|$|E
