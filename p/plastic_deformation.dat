Pure (type IIa) diamond can be colored pink, red, or brown owing to structural anomalies arising through <b>plastic</b> <b>deformation</b> during crystal growth; these diamonds are rare (1.8% of gem diamonds), but constitute {{a large percentage of}} Australian diamonds. Type IIb diamonds, which account for ~0.1% of gem diamonds, are usually a steely blue or gray due to boron atoms scattered within the crystal matrix. These diamonds are also semiconductors, unlike other diamond types (see Electrical properties). Most blue-gray diamonds coming from the Argyle mine of Australia are not of type IIb, but of Ia type. Those diamonds contain large concentrations of defects and impurities (especially hydrogen and nitrogen) and the origin of their color is yet uncertain. Type II diamonds weakly absorb in a different region of the infrared (the absorption is due to the diamond lattice rather than impurities), and transmit in the ultraviolet below 225nm, unlike type I diamonds. They also have differing fluorescence characteristics, but no discernible visible absorption spectrum.|$|E

Such method here described is considered to be available for the analysis of traffic accidents, for instance, the <b>plastic</b> <b>deformations</b> of guard fence, etc. At any rate, the problems on the fractures and <b>plastic</b> <b>deformations</b> of various materials under impulsive loading are very important and interesting.

The problem is formulated according to a plastic shakedown criterion, so that incremental and instantaneous collapse are certainly prevented when the frame is subjected to very strongly amplified cyclic loads. The further condition that the structure must also behave elastically in serviceability conditions is imposed.

25|$|Friction {{extrusion}} {{was invented}} at The Welding Institute in the UK and patented in 1991. It was originally intended {{primarily as a}} method for production of homogenous microstructures and particle distributions in metal matrix composite materials. Friction extrusion differs from conventional extrusion in that the charge (billet or other precursor) rotates relative to the extrusion die. An extrusion force is applied so as to push the charge against the die. In practice either the die or the charge may rotate {{or they may be}} counter-rotating. The relative rotary motion between the charge and the die has several significant effects on the process. First, the relative motion in the plane of rotation leads to large shear stresses, hence, <b>plastic</b> <b>deformation</b> in the layer of charge in contact with and near the die. This <b>plastic</b> <b>deformation</b> is dissipated by recovery and recrystallization processes leading to substantial heating of the deforming charge. Because of the deformation heating, friction extrusion does not generally require preheating of the charge by auxiliary means potentially resulting in a more energy efficient process. Second, the substantial level of <b>plastic</b> <b>deformation</b> in the region of relative rotary motion can promote solid state welding of powders or other finely divided precursors, such as flakes and chips, effectively consolidating the charge (friction consolidation) prior to extrusion.|$|E

We have obtained experimental data for cross-shaped samples made of engineering material; the samples have been used to study the effect of biaxial loading on a crack growth rate. The crack growth has been examined comparing the results obtained under monoaxial tension and under biaxial compression-tension. The fracture in a fatigue crack tip is presented as a combination of brittle fracture on a crack tip and as a ductile fracture in a propagation zone of <b>plastic</b> <b>deformations.</b> The finite element method with linear hardening in a zone of <b>plastic</b> <b>deformations</b> have been used to explore a stress state in a crack zone.

May, 2013 Hojjat Gholizadeh The mechanical properties of steels are influenced by their <b>plastic</b> <b>deformations.</b> In austenitic steels, <b>plastic</b> <b>deformations</b> may occur through different mechanisms in-cluding dislocation gliding, twinning (twinning-induced plasticity, TWIP), and phase transformation (transformation-induced plasticity, TRIP).

In order to investigate the influence of interstitial carbon on the SFE in austenitic carbon steels, we calculate the γ-curve which contains the SFE.

25|$|Solids with purely {{metallic}} bonding are characteristically ductile and, {{in their}} pure forms, have low strength; melting points {{can be very}} low (e.g., Mercury melts at 234K (−39°C). These properties are consequences of the non-directional and non-polar nature of metallic bonding, which allows atoms (and planes of atoms in a crystal lattice) to move past one another without disrupting their bonding interactions. Metals can be strengthened by introducing crystal defects (for example, by alloying) that interfere with the motion of dislocations that mediate <b>plastic</b> <b>deformation.</b> Further, some transition metals exhibit directional bonding in addition to metallic bonding; this increases shear strength and reduces ductility, imparting some {{of the characteristics of}} a covalent solid (an intermediate case below).|$|E
25|$|The {{pressure}} {{at the bottom}} of the mantle is ~136 GPa (1.4 million atm). Pressure increases as depth increases, since the material beneath has to support the weight of all the material above it. The entire mantle, however, is thought to deform like a fluid on long timescales, with permanent <b>plastic</b> <b>deformation</b> accommodated by the movement of point, line, and/or planar defects through the solid crystals comprising the mantle. Estimates for the viscosity of the upper mantle range between 1019 and 1024 Pa·s, depending on depth, temperature, composition, state of stress, and numerous other factors. Thus, the upper mantle can only flow very slowly. However, when large forces are applied to the uppermost mantle it can become weaker, and this effect is thought to be important in allowing the formation of tectonic plate boundaries.|$|E
25|$|In {{a static}} sense, the {{fundamental}} difference between a liquid and a solid is that the solid has elastic resistance against a shearing stress while a liquid does not. Thus, a simple liquid will not typically support a transverse acoustic phonon, or shear wave. Gels have been described by Born as liquids in which an elastic resistance against shearing survives, yielding both viscous and elastic properties. It has been shown theoretically that in a certain low-frequency range, polymeric gels should propagate shear waves with relatively low damping. The distinction between a sol (solution) and a gel therefore appears to be understood in a manner analogous to the practical distinction between the elastic and <b>plastic</b> <b>deformation</b> ranges of a metal. The distinction lies {{in the ability to}} respond to an applied shear force via macroscopic viscous flow.|$|E
