Usually, optical polishing pitch {{is applied to}} polish optical workpieces, but the material removal rate (MRR) of pitch is quite low, and polyurethane foam is thus substituted for polishing pitch. With the polyurethane pad a much higher MRR was obtained. Surface roughness and subsurface damage of workpieces were also examined.

40|$|A {{thermomechanical}} {{model to}} describe the mechanisms of <b>polishing</b> <b>pad</b> scratching in chemical–mechanical planarization (CMP) has been formulated and investigated. CMP is a necessary process in integrated circuit (IC) fabrication to planarize wafers with nanoscale features after patterned layer deposition. <b>Polishing</b> <b>pad</b> asperities can produce microscale scratches on the wafer surface during CMP, reducing IC manufacturing yields. The constructed thermomechanical model accounts for stresses of the pad and wafer contact and also provides the means to track input energy dissipation during CMP. Tracking energy dissipation offers information about processes that may influence scratch production. This knowledge ultimately produces a greater physical understanding of CMP {{for the prevention of}} <b>pad</b> scratching. <b>Polishing</b> <b>pad</b> stress relaxation experiments demonstrate the importance of viscoelastic and plastic strain energy dissipation with its effects on the wafer stress field.

40|$|Abstract. In a {{chemical}} mechanical polishing (CMP) process, the removal rate {{is affected by}} the actual contact conditions between the wafer and the <b>polishing</b> <b>pad.</b> The <b>polishing</b> <b>pad</b> {{is one of the most}} important consumable materials: when the wafer is <b>polished,</b> the <b>pad</b> surface asperity changes. Further, the <b>polishing</b> <b>pad</b> surface asperity has a substantial influence on the actual contact conditions. Therefore, measurement and quantitative evaluation methods for the pad surface asperity have been proposed by various research institutes. We have developed a novel measurement and quantitative evaluation method for <b>polishing</b> <b>pad</b> surface asperity based on contact image analysis using an image rotation prism. We have proposed four effective evaluation parameters: the number of contact points, the contact ratio, the maximum value of the minimum spacing of the contact points, and the half-width of the peak of the spatial Fast Fourier transform (FFT) result of a contact image. This paper discusses the change in the <b>polishing</b> <b>pad</b> surface asperity measured by the proposed evaluation parameters in serial batch polishing tests. In particular, this research focused on the relationships between the proposed evaluation parameters and the removal rate, which change with an increase in the number of serial batch polishing tests.

40|$|Abstract. Polishing {{process is}} a primary {{technique}} for planarization of material surface in manufacture fabrication. The pad structure and its material properties are important to determine the polish rate and planarity {{that can be achieved}} by the polishing process. Besides, the pad conditioning is used to regenerate the surface of the polishing pad surface by breaking up the glazed areas. Because the polishing and pad conditioning mechanism is inadequately understood and because higher levels of <b>pad</b> <b>polishing</b> performance are desired, the investigation of experiment becomes more important. In this paper, a high precision polishing machine has established. With an improved design, a test rig can be easily used to simulate the polishing, pad conditioning process and acquire the signals of temperature. The temperature of test pads (i. e. Rodel IC 1000 A, Rodel IC 1000 B and Opetech SB 660) is measured during polishing and pad conditioning process. For the self-design test rig, its surface temperature is measured by T-type thermocouples screwed behind the polishing (or conditioning) interface of the carrier. The parameters of thermal measurement, including polishing time, down force, rotation speed and particle size, increase the understanding of the mechanism on polishing pads during polishing / conditioning processes...|$|E
40|$|The {{material}} removal and surface figure after ceria <b>pad</b> <b>polishing</b> of fused silica glass have been measured and analyzed {{as a function}} of kinematics, loading conditions, and polishing time. Also, the friction at the workpiece/lap interface, the slope of the workpiece relative to the lap plane, and lap viscoelastic properties have been measured and correlated to {{material removal}}. The results show that the relative velocity between the workpiece & lap (determined by the kinematics) and the pressure distribution determine the spatial and temporal material removal and hence the final surface figure of the workpiece. In the case where the applied loading and relative velocity distribution over the workpiece are spatially uniform, a significant non-uniform spatial material removal from the workpiece surface is observed. This is due to a non-uniform pressure distribution resulting from: (1) a moment caused by a pivot point and interface friction forces; (2) viscoelastic relaxation of the polyurethane lap; and (3) a physical workpiece/lap interface mismatch. Both the kinematics and these contributions to the pressure distribution are quantitatively described, and then combined to form a spatial and temporal Preston model & code for material removal (called Surface Figure or SurF{copyright}). The surface figure simulations are consistent with the experiment {{for a wide variety of}} polishing conditions. This study is an important step towards deterministic full-aperture polishing, which would allow optical glass fabrication to be performed in a more repeatable, less iterative, and hence more economical manner...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work {{is to develop a}} solid scientific understanding of the creation and characteristics of surface fractures formed during the grinding and polishing of brittle materials, specifically glass. In this study, we have experimentally characterized the morphology, number density, and depth distribution of various surface cracks as a function of various grinding and polishing processes (blanchard, fixed abrasive grinding, loose abrasive, pitch polishing and <b>pad</b> <b>polishing).</b> Also, the effects of load, abrasive particle (size, distribution, foreign particles, geometry, velocity), and lap material (pitch, pad) were examined. The resulting data were evaluated in terms of indentation fracture mechanics and tribological interactions (science of interacting surfaces) leading to several models to explain crack distribution behavior of ground surfaces and to explain the characteristics of scratches formed during polishing. This project has greatly advanced the scientific knowledge of microscopic mechanical damage occurring during grinding and polishing and has been of general interest. This knowledge-base has also enabled the design and optimization of surface finishing processes to create optical surfaces with far superior laser damage resistance. There are five major areas of scientific progress {{as a result of this}} LDRD. They are listed in Figure 1 and described briefly in this summary below. The details of this work are summarized through a number of published manuscripts which are included this LDRD Final Report. In the first area of grinding, we developed a technique to quantitatively and statistically measure the depth distribution of surface fractures (i. e., subsurface damage) in fused silica as function of various grinding processes using mixtures of various abrasive particles size distributions. The observed crack distributions were explained using a model that extended known, single brittle indentation models to an ensemble of loaded, sliding particles. The model illustrates the importance of the particle size distribution of the abrasive and its influence on the resulting crack distribution. The results of these studies are summarized in references 1 - 7. In the second area of polishing, we conducted a series of experiments showing the influence of rogue particles (i. e., particles in the polishing slurry that are larger than base particles) on the creation of scratches on polished surfaces. Scratches can be thought of a as a specific type of sub-surface damage. The characteristics (width, length, type of fractures, concentration) were explained in terms of the rogue particle size, the rogue particle material, and the viscoelastic properties of the lap. The results of these studies are summarized in references 6 - 7. In the third area of etching, we conducted experiments aimed at understanding the effect of HF:NH{sub 4 }F acid etching on surface fractures on fused silica. Etching can be used as a method: (a) to expose sub-surface mechanical damage, (b) to study the morphology of specific mechanical damage occurring by indentation, and (c) to convert a ground surface containing a high concentration of sub-surface mechanical damage into surface roughness. Supporting models have been developed to describe in detail the effect of etching on the morphology and evolution of surface cracks. The results of these studies are summarized in references 8 - 9. In the fourth area of scratch forensics or scratch fractography, a set of new scratch forensic rule-of-thumbs were developed in order to aid the optical fabricator and process engineer to interpret the cause of scratches and digs on surfaces. The details of how these rules were developed are described in each of the references included in this summary (1 - 9). Figure 2 provides as a summary of some of the more commonly used rules-of-thumbs that have been developed in this study.

40|$|Variable {{rotation}} polishing (VRP) {{method is}} proposed {{in order to}} improve polishing performance such as material removal rate (MRR). The VRP method is characterized as a combination of the additional backward rotation with the forward rotation only (i. e. the conventional polishing). The MRR increases as the angle of additional backward rotation becomes higher until 360 degrees. In that case, the MRR of the VRP method was 38 percent higher than that of the conventional polishing. Asperity of <b>polishing</b> <b>pad</b> surface is one of the dominant parameters affecting the MRRs and stabilities of the Chemical Mechanical Polishing (CMP) process. According to the investigation of a <b>polishing</b> <b>pad</b> surface topography suggests that the asperity of the <b>polishing</b> <b>pad</b> surface was kept standing upright by backward rotation of the <b>polishing</b> <b>pad.</b> Particularly, the peak area of the asperities on <b>polishing</b> <b>pad</b> surface, the roughness became higher in the VRP method than in the conventional method. This result predicts that there are more the number and the area of the <b>polishing</b> <b>pad</b> asperities, which would approach near to the wafer surface being polished, are kept standing upright in the VRP method. Therefore, these asperities was able to consequently sustain the MRRs. In other words, this behavior suggests that in the VRP method, the preservation of the asperity on <b>polishing</b> <b>pad</b> surface would sustain the MRR because of the backward rotation, which may contribute to the realization of a <b>polishing</b> <b>pad</b> conditioning treatment-free CMP process. This feature also indicates that this method could result in the longer <b>polishing</b> <b>pad</b> life, namely the cost reduction of <b>polishing</b> <b>pad.</b> Slurry flow distribution and slurry film thickness were also evaluated in the VRP method comparing to the conventional polishing method. The slurry flow distribution was analyzed through a transparent quartz substrate by a high-speed camera. The slurry flow distribution of the VRP method was not uniform as compared with the conventional method, although the MRR of the VRP method was higher than that of the conventional method. The slurry film thickness variation was measured using a surface scanning laser confocal displacement meter on the upper surface position of a quartz substrate with and without slurry. The position of a quartz substrate varied from 9 μm to 8 μm during the CMP process. This implies that the slurry film thickness in the VRP method was 1 μm thinner than that of the conventional polishing. These results suggest that these 2 parameters are not dominantly effective against the MRR of the CMP process. As above mentioned, the preservation of the asperity on <b>polishing</b> <b>pad</b> surface is one of the dominant parameters to sustain the MRR. 九州工業大学博士学位論文 学位記番号:情工博甲第 301 号 学位授与年月日:平成 27 年 3 月 25 日CHAPTER 1 Introduction|CHAPTER 2 The Chemical Mechanical Polishing Technology|CHAPTER 3 The Variable Rotation Polishing Method in theCMP Process|CHAPTER 4 The Polishing Performance of Variable Rotation Polishing Method|CHAPTER 5 Mechanisms Analysis of the Variable Rotation Polishing Method|CHAPTER 6 <b>Polishing</b> <b>Pad</b> Analysis by 3 D Topography Observation|CHAPTER 7 Conclusions九州工業大学平成 26 年...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. For {{manufacturing}} of Integrated Circuits (IC), Chemical Mechanical Polishing (CPM) is {{the most}} popular method to reach a global flatness in wafer fabrication. One of the most important factors to be concerned in CMP is the <b>polishing</b> <b>pad.</b> The <b>polishing</b> <b>pad</b> needs to be dressed to maintain the quality and the throughput of production. This is due to the wear of <b>polishing</b> <b>pad</b> and the influence of impurities. Particularly important targets in the pad dressing are to increase the material removal rate (MRR) and a low non-uniformity (N. u.). A higher material removal rate (MRR) is achieved by higher stresses acted on to the pad. Meanwhile, stiffness properties of pad are changeable because of depth elimination and deterioration in the non-uniformity (N. u.) of pad surface. Therefore, in order to conduct an improved planarization process with higher MRR and lower N. u., an investigation of pad deformation is necessary. The goal {{of this study is to}} develop pad deformation equations for pad dressing. Firstly, the uniform circular distribution pressure is used to simulate applied loading on <b>polishing</b> <b>pad</b> done by dresser during dressing process. Then, the three-dimensional pad deformation depth and stiffness of <b>polishing</b> <b>pad</b> are obtained by using Hertizian contact theorem and principle of elasticity. Finally, the superposition method is introduced to calculate the deformation resulted from total dressing force. The theoretical results reveal that the deformation in the center of dresser is significant. Similar deformed-shapes are obtained for different pad depth under the same loading. In conclusion, the deformed magnitude is strongly correlated to the indices such as MRR and Nu...|$|R

For some low applied creep charges, the creep phenomenon is not observed for the polyurethane polishers. While the deformation due to creep is proportional to the polishing time...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The primary {{consumables}} {{in chemical}} mechanical polishing (CMP) are the <b>polishing</b> <b>pad</b> and the slurry. The <b>polishing</b> <b>pad</b> significantly influences {{the stability of}} the polishing process and the cost of consumables (CoC). During the polishing process, a diamond dresser must be frequently employed to remove the debris to prevent accumulation, a process known as pad conditioning. In this paper, we investigated the physical properties of the CMP pad such as compressibility, thickness, and surface roughness. The difference between new and used pads has been studied. Conclusively, conditioning via a diamond dresser will extend pad life and reduce CoC...|$|R
40|$|Electrochemical {{mechanical}} planarization (ECMP) process makes {{copper ions}} dissolved electrochemically by applying an anodic potential energy on the copper surface {{in an aqueous}} electrolyte, and then copper complex layer removed by the mechanical action of <b>polishing</b> <b>pad.</b> The ECMP process allows lower pressure processing to soft Cu built on mechanically fragile low-k dielectrics, comparing to traditional Cu chemical mechanical polishing (CMP). The <b>polishing</b> <b>pad</b> used in ECMP is a conventional IC pad with holes, and has roles of supplying aqueous electrolyte to copper surface and removing copper complex layer. Material removal rate (MRR) and, uniformity are tested according to diameter and arrangement of holes opened on the <b>polishing</b> <b>pad,</b> and simulated by the change of the wafer overhang distance (WOD) from the platen and the electric contact area (ECA). In order to derive the design rule of the system, the experimental results are compared with the simulation. After ECMP process, it was verified that WIWNU was lower than 2 % using the relatively uniform ECA pad (C-type) under smaller WOD which was well matched with the simulated MRR profiles...|$|R
