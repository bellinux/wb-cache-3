50|$|The <b>pallid</b> <b>swift</b> {{was first}} {{described}} by English naturalist George Ernest Shelley in 1870.|$|E
50|$|It {{is entirely}} dark {{except for an}} indistinct pale throat patch. It is slimmer and more rakish than the <b>pallid</b> <b>swift,</b> and is darker than that species and lacks the obvious white throat.|$|E
50|$|The <b>pallid</b> <b>swift</b> (Apus pallidus) {{is a small}} bird, superficially {{similar to}} a barn swallow or house martin. It is, however, {{completely}} unrelated to those passerine species, since the swifts are in the order Apodiformes. The resemblances between the groups are due to convergent evolution reflecting similar life styles.|$|E
50|$|<b>Pallid</b> <b>swifts</b> breed on {{cliffs and}} eaves around the Mediterranean {{and on the}} Canary Islands and Madeira, laying two eggs. Like swallows, they are migratory, winter in {{southern}} Africa or southeast Asia.|$|R
50|$|This 14-15 cm long {{species is}} very similar to the closely related common and <b>pallid</b> <b>swifts,</b> which also occur in the archipelagos, and {{separation}} is only possible with good views. Like its relatives, it has a short forked tail and very long swept-back wings that resemble a crescent or a boomerang.|$|R
50|$|Crataerina acutipennis, is {{a species}} of biting fly in the family of louse flies Hippoboscidae. Its hosts are swift species {{including}} the little, white-rumped, Horus, <b>pallid</b> and plain <b>swifts.</b>|$|R
50|$|They {{are rare}} north of their {{breeding}} areas, {{although they are}} likely to be under-recorded due to identification problems. Because of its more southerly range, <b>pallid</b> <b>swift</b> arrives earlier and leaves later than the closely related common swift, so particularly early or late swifts north of the normal range should be carefully observed.|$|E
50|$|Since 1987 it {{has been}} a state park and a {{protected}} ecological area (Regional Park) with 18 trails and several archeological/historical sites. Wildlife include Eurasian badger, beech marten, least weasel, yellow-bellied toad, peregrine falcon, kingfisher and <b>pallid</b> <b>swift.</b> Apart the strawberry tree, vegetation include oak, holm oak, Aleppo pine, Cupressus sempervirens and many others.|$|E
40|$|First {{breeding}} record of <b>pallid</b> <b>swift</b> Apus pallidus {{in an urban}} centre on the Balearic Isles. From 25 th June 2010, a group of up to 9 individuals of <b>pallid</b> <b>swift</b> were seen entering and leaving at least 5 different locations on the same building in the centre of Inca (Mallorca) where some pairs of swift Apus apus were also breeding. They were seen carrying material to furnish nests in holes in the building. Young were seen flying {{in the area and}} movements of the species were noted until 27 th October...|$|E

50|$|Pallid {{sturgeon}} prefer {{moderate to}} swift river currents and most captured specimens {{have been recovered}} in rivers and streams in which the current averages between 0.33 and 2.9 ft/s. They also prefer turbid waterways and water depths between 3 and 25 ft. The species is more commonly found where sandy substrates are plentiful, but also lives in predominately rocky waterways. <b>Pallid</b> sturgeon prefer <b>swift</b> river currents more often than do shovelnose sturgeon.|$|R
40|$|In {{the course}} of a {{research}} program on the mites of the genus Dermanyssus, parasites were collected in 2007 and 2008 on live adults and young as well as on complete (after the young fledged) or partial (unsuccessful or old) unoccupied nests of Common Swift (Apus apus) in Gard (southern France) and <b>Pallid</b> <b>Swift</b> (A. pallidus) in Corsica. Two mite species were found: Dermanyssus gallinae (on Common Swift, but sampling could have been too small for <b>Pallid</b> <b>Swift)</b> and above all a new species Dermanyssus apodis (on both Common and Pallid Swifts) which has been described in 2009. The eventual effects of these parasites on their hosts are briefly discussed...|$|E
40|$|I {{discovered}} an aberrant swift {{in the series}} of Danish specimens that appeared identical to two specimens of the <b>Pallid</b> <b>Swift</b> subspecies illyricus from Croatia in the same collection. Subsequent measuring confirmed the identification. According to the label the specimen was from Kirke Helsinge, West Zealand 11 March 1993 and had been collected by Keld Bennike. The collection manager...|$|E
40|$|Young <b>Pallid</b> <b>Swift</b> Apus pallidus {{from the}} second clutch are known to fledge in {{the second week of}} October at the latest. Late {{breeding}} was observed in October 2005 in Split, where three active nests were found on 21 st October. Two of them were still active on 29 th of October, with presumable fledging between 30 th October and 2 nd November...|$|E
40|$|Habitat {{complexity}} {{has long}} been associated with greater species diversity and abundance (Urban and Smith 1989, Halaj et al. 2000, Burnett et al. 2007). Habitat structure influences the quality of microclimate, food abundance, and cover. It is an important consideration in how Sierra Nevada shrublands and forests are managed. Diversity of vegetative structure is created under an active fire regime, with insect and pathogen (mistletoe, fungi, root rot) activity (Spies et al. 2006), as well as fluctuations in climate, soil conditions, and position in the landscape (North et al. 2009). Natural disturbances such as fire, insects and disease also act to reduce stand density and create forest openings that support early-seral stage vegetation {{as well as the}} animals that depend on it (see Table 1). Climate change may increase the intensity of some of these disturbances; however, resilience to climate change is best arrived at by allowing fire to regulate structure and succession (Hurteau and North 2010). Early successional forested ecosystems provide high species diversity and unique food webs and species assemblages (Swanson et al. 2010). For example, almost a quarter of breeding birds in the Sierra Nevada nest in shrub habitat (USDA Forest Service 2007). Migratory mule deer herds also depend on early-seral landscapes dominated by shrubs and herbaceous plants to survive winter and spring. Sierran ecosystems have also evolved with and depend on natural disturbances to create habitat in dead and dying trees. The <b>pallid</b> bat, Vauxâ€™s <b>swift,</b> fisher and black bear rely on various-sized cavities in large snags and logs. The black-backed woodpecker is a fire specialist largely restricted to burned areas. They usually nest in dense patches of small burned conifers and depend on large snags for foraging (refer to species accounts appendix for black-backed woodpecker) (Dixon and Saab 2000; Hanson and North 2008; Bond et al. 2012; Siegel et al. 2012). Unfortunately, 120 years of fire suppression in the Sierra Nevada has produced a homogenized forest structure (Beaty and Taylor 2008), eliminated large snags, and has significantly reduced chaparral (Nagel and Taylor 2005, USD...|$|R
