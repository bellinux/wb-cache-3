MethodsPayroll, demographic, medical, pharmaceutical, sick leave, short- and long-term disability, and workers' compensation {{data were collected from}} multiple large employers with employees widely dispersed across the United States. Data were collected during the time period of 2001 to 2004 from approximately 300, 000 employees. Objective productivity output data were also available for a subset of employees (captured electronically in the form of units of work processed per person). T-tests and chi-square tests were used to compare demographic data. Two-stage multivariate regression models were used to compare annual work absence and at-work productivity between employees with and without gout, while controlling for group differences indemographics, salary, other work-related variables, and comorbidities (using the Charlson Comorbidity Index). ResultsThe annual prevalence of gout was 4. 7 per 1000 employees from 2001 to 2004. Employees with gout had 4. 56 more annual absence days for all categories of health-related work absence than those without gout. Objective <b>productivity</b> (<b>units</b> of work processed) results were only available for a small subsample of employees (86 with gout and 27, 472 without gout). Employees with gout processed 3. 51 % fewer units per hour worked and 2. 38 % fewer <b>units</b> per <b>year</b> than employees without gout (nonsignificant at P = 0. 49 and P = 0. 78, respectively).

The unit is designed and installed {{as a part of}} a partially funded European Commission (EC) project named "PV and thermally-driven small-scale, stand-alone desalination system with very low maintenance needs (SMADES) ". The basic innovative MD principle and module is highlighted. The Alexandria MD unit is described and the unit performance is presented for the 6 months of its operation period. The unit performance covers the transient changes in the <b>unit</b> <b>productivity,</b> <b>unit</b> feed water, brine and product water temperatures and conductivities, unit salt rejection, solar collector and MD process efficiencies.

The relatively high productivity, above that of the conventional solar still, is due to the partial recovery of the condensation energy.

40|$|Advantages of pre-cast {{technology}} {{in the construction of}} commercial, residential and institutional buildings are well documented in literature. However, the acceptance of this {{technology in}} Malaysia is relatively low with few projects being constructed with pre-cast components. The objectives of this paper are to measure labor productivity in construction, to examine productivity indicators between pre-cast and conventional Cast-In-Situ (CIS) methods, and to explore areas of improvements to promote adoption of pre-cast technology in Malaysia. Data on construction labor productivity are collected using questionnaires, interviews, and observations at the construction sites. Based on statistical analysis performed in this paper, it is concluded that pre-cast method is better than conventional CIS method in terms of construction labor productivity, time to complete a project, variability of construction activities, and loss of efficiency during the construction process. Baseline <b>productivity,</b> <b>unit</b> rates for pre-cast components and correlation of the productivity factors to construction labor productivity are presented as well. Indra Gunawa...|$|R

However, from a longer term historical perspective, there are still a number of areas in which Hong Kong's competitiveness has been eroded relative to her main competitors in East Asia, especially in export sector. On the aggregate level, although Hong Kong's total factor productivity (TFP) growth rate is amongst the best performers in East Asia in the recent years, it has been adversely affected by the continuing relocation of Hong Kong's manufacturing production to the Mainland China. On sectorial levels, Hong Kong's competitiveness deteriorated in several important categories of goods and service exports. Overall, our study shows that the Hong Kong economy still maintains its resilience to outside shocks, nevertheless it needs to explore new areas to fuel its future growth.
