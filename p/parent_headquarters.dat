40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{some aspects}} of the working experiences of the managing directors of Australian subsidiaries of European, UK and US multinational corporations in a sector of the healthcare industry. The study compares and contrasts the work experiences of two groups of subsidiary managers. One group reports into the multinational’s <b>parent</b> <b>headquarters,</b> while the other group reports into an Asia Pacific regional office. Evidence emerged from the study of {{a significant difference in the}} work experiences of the two groups of managers and suggests that a regional structure may not always be the optimal structure for the subsidiary. Key impediments to a successful regional structure seem to be attitudinal, because of cultural and language differences. This finding is in conflict with mainstream international human resource management research that maintains that a regional structure offers efficiency and contributes positively to globalisation through the process of value creation and enhancement. The paper goes on to address the need to provide an effective mechanism for improving the work experience and, in particular, the communication between inpatriate managers and their supervisors. 19 page(s...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{begins by}} {{describing}} {{an attempt to}} evaluate {{the contribution of the}} overseas affiliates of 20 European parent multinational enterprises (MNEs), based in four South-East Asian countries; Malaysia, Singapore, Brunei Darussalam and Thailand. This was done through semi-structured interviews carried out by the author in <b>parent</b> <b>headquarters,</b> regional offices and affiliated plant locations, together with state institutions in the host nations. The visits were repeated over a 2 -year period from 1997 to 1999. The resource-dependency model used to structure the research focused on two characteristics of the affiliates. The first was whether the contribution of the affiliate was to high-value-added locally designed products or to low-value, low-design products. A second dimension was provided by the place held by the plant on local/global supply chains. An initial hypothesis was that distinctively different modes of organizational learning would emerge from the conjunction of nationally differentiated parent MNEs and the institutional context of the host country and would, therefore, shape the manner in which dependencies were operationalized. In practice, two factors seemed more important in shaping the business strategy and style of the affiliate. The first was the nature of the operational technology, particularly the sunk costs of local investment, {{and the degree to which}} these ‘captured’ the MNE for the national economic development strategy of the host government. The second was the political economic context of both the parent and affiliate, and the manner in which these caused the dissipation or enhancement of managerial and technical capabilities. In essence, the focus of the study shifted from one in which the MNE and host state were treated as holistic actors interacting along a single common dimension, to one in which the political incorporation and social embeddedness of the former within the context of the latter was accomplished through multiple and socially segmented networks. The question of the extent to which the MNE can act autonomously to shape either its internal or external structure might, therefore, be taken as a matter for political and ethical judgement as much as for market forces...|$|E

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the {{determinants}} of home-region strategy of the multinational subsidiary and the impact of such a strategy on its performance. The author draws upon new internalization theory to develop a theory-driven model and empirically tests the simultaneous relationships between home-region strategy and performance of the subsidiary. Design/methodology/approach – The author tests the model using a simultaneous equation statistical technique on an original, new data set of publicly listed multinational subsidiaries operating in the ASEAN region, with <b>parent</b> firms’ <b>headquarters</b> across the broad triad. Findings – There are three significant findings. The first finding is that subsidiary-level downstream knowledge (marketing advantages), and the geographic location of the subsidiary in the same home region as of the parent firm are key antecedents of a subsidiary’s home-region strategy. The second finding is that a subsidiary’s profitability reduces home-region orientation; however, home-region strategy has an insignificant effect on performance. The third finding is that these subsidiaries generate on average 92 per cent of their total sales in the home region (the Asia Pacific). Originality/value – The author advances the existing literature on the regional nature of parent-level multinational enterprises by demonstrating that their quasi-autonomous subsidiaries also operate mainly on a home-region basis...|$|R

40|$|Purpose of the article: Diversity in the {{workplace}} {{is one of the}} biggest challenges in contemporary organisational studies. Understanding and effective management of diverse teams deserves greater concern in scientific literature as well as in managing teams in real organisations. The main goal of the paper is to provide an analysis of team diversity, performance and satisfaction in a series of interviews with managers. The first part of the article is dedicated to the concept of diversity and Diversity Management based on literature review. The second part is focused on linking diversity with performance and defining popular trends in research of diversity. The third part is presenting a report from ongoing pilot research focused on feedback from managers and suitability of methods (DPQ, 7 S McKinsey, and questionnaires base on Likert Scale) in 2 companies in the Czech Republic. Methodology/methods: Research methods are adjusted to article‘s aims. The following methods are used: DPQ (Diversity Perspective Questionnaire), 7 S McKinsey, and questionnaires based on Likert Scale) in 2 companies in the Czech Republic. Findings: The findings showed the similarity of research findings from abroad – organizations in the Czech Republic generally are not yet aware of the importance of Diversity Management as an overall strategy. Diversity perspectives and strategies of <b>parent</b> companies (<b>headquarters)</b> and their subsidiaries may not be consistent Monitoring of the workforce changes doesn’t take place in both companies. There is no strategic work with diverse teams. None of two companies is not using systematically findings from research on diversity to create more effective work groups and teams.

40|$|Through {{longitudinal}} {{case studies}} of headquarters-subsidiary knowledge transfer, I explore knowledge sender and receiver capabilities, and the underlying micro-mechanisms that have implications on knowledge transfer processes and outcomes over time. The knowledge transfer phenomenon between <b>parent</b> firm <b>headquarters</b> (HQ) and subsidiaries has received {{a substantial amount of}} research attention over the last decades. Even so, knowledge of firms’ disseminative and absorptive capacities and the mechanisms through which they interact and shape knowledge transfer is lacking. This doctoral thesis aims to contribute {{to our understanding of the}} strategic, relational and political nature of sender and receiver capabilities, and their implications on HQ-subsidiary knowledge transfer in multinational corporations (MNC). This thesis consists of four research papers and their findings point to evolutionary dynamics of HQ-subsidiary knowledge transfer where power and politics play an important role. Most studies have looked at MNC knowledge transfer processes at one point in time. Using a longitudinal case study design, I find that the amounts and the types of transferred knowledge change over time. Headquarters-subsidiary knowledge flows vary with strategic opportunities, but also with changing abilities and motivations to disseminate and absorb knowledge. Whereas most studies of MNC knowledge transfer focus on the recipient, I demonstrate that sender-receiver interactions matter, and explain how these interactions influence HQ-subsidiary knowledge transfer processes and outcomes over time. I studied the headquarters-subsidiary knowledge transfer processes in the context of post-acquisition integration where power and politics play an important role. My data shows that power imbalance between parent firms and their newly acquired targets influence the type, the timing and the amount of knowledge transfer through power balancing actions. Political strategies and influence tactics of the acquiring and target firms differ in conventional (acquirer to target) and reverse (target to acquirer) knowledge flows, and generate distinct knowledge outcomes. In this thesis, I develop a new conceptualization of headquarters’ disseminative capacity that refers to political capability of the parent firm to influence change in the behavior and attitudes of the subsidiary and, ultimately, gain and preserve power. This constitutes a novel way of looking at the headquarters’ role in intra-MNC knowledge flows through which a competitive advantage can be gained and sustained...|$|R
40|$|Competence {{building}} and management {{has been an}} issue frequently addressed in the literature, but it seldom {{has been referred to}} enterprises acting as part of production networks. The literature is still scarcer when the networks are international and include organisational units located in countries classifi ed as &ldquo;emerging economies&rdquo;. The main {{purpose of this study is}} to develop an analytical framework for the understanding of theconfi guration of organisational competences in the distinct participants of international production networks: multinationals and their subsidiaries organising local production networks. Different types of subsidiaries create local relationships whenever they act as part of a supply network to serve the local markets (interfi rm relationship). At the same time, every subsidiary keeps an internal relationship with its <b>parent</b> companyand respective <b>headquarters</b> (intrafi rm). This article focuses on the global networks of Telecommunications industry and more specifi cally in Brazil. The networks are essentiallyconstituted by Telecom Operators and Specialised Equipment Suppliers. The fi eld research was done in a sample of six subsidiaries operating in Brazil. In every fi rm we studied theway in which competences were built. An analytical framework was built to analyse the subsidiary-headquarters relationships, the role played by the subsidiary in the local supplynetworks and the specifi c features of the distinct types of subsidiaries. The outcomes show that, in the Brazilian context, where the lack of regulatory constraints allows that multinational corporations (MNCs) operate under a high level of autonomy, the structure of the local supply chain tends to refl ect the structure of the chain at global level. In that case, the way in which the global leader, the MNC that exerts the governance of the chain, considers competence formation at the headquarters and at the subsidiary level, as well as the competences that exist ingrained in fi rms and institutions at local level, are the main determinants of the overall confi guration of competence...|$|R
