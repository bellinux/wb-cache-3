40|$|Most {{applications}} of photodynamic therapy (PDT) in gastroenterology {{to date have}} used <b>porfimer</b> <b>sodium</b> as the photosensitizing agent. For destroying small lesions in {{the wall of the}} gastrointestinal tract in inoperable patients, it has proved to be most effective, but attempts to achieve circumferential mucosal ablation, as in the treatment of Barrett’s esophagus, have led to a high incidence of strictures, and all patients have cutaneous photosensitivity, which can last up to three months. Two new photosensitizers are of particular interest to gastroenterologists. PDT with metatetrahydroxyphenyl chlorin produces a similar biological effect as PDT with <b>porfimer</b> <b>sodium,</b> but the light doses required are much smaller, and cutaneous photosensitivity lasts only two to three weeks. Further, it can be used with percutaneous light delivery to destroy localized pancreatic cancers. The photosensitizing agent 5 -amino levulinic acid, converted in vivo into the photoactive derivative protoporphyrin IX, sensitizes the mucosa much more than the underlying layers. This makes it feasible to destroy areas of abnormal mucosa without damaging the underlying muscle and is, therefore, better for treating Barrett’s esophagus. Detailed clinical studies are required to establish the real role of PDT with the use of these and other new photosensitizers...|$|E

40|$|AbstractIntroductionWe {{report a}} phase I trial of {{photodynamic}} therapy (PDT) of {{carcinoma in situ}} (CIS) and microinvasive cancer (MIC) of the central airways with the photosensitizer (PS) 2 -[1 -hexyloxyethyl]- 2 -devinyl pyropheophorbide-a (HPPH). HPPH {{has the advantage of}} minimal general phototoxicity over the commonly used photosensitizer <b>porfimer</b> <b>sodium</b> (Photofrin; Pinnacle Biologics, Chicago, IL). MethodsThe objectives of this study were (1) to determine the maximally tolerated light dose at a fixed photosensitizer dose and (2) to gain initial insight into the effectiveness of this treatment approach. Seventeen patients with 21 CIS/MIC lesions were treated with HPPH with light dose escalation starting from 75 J/cm 2 and increasing to 85, 95, 125, and 150 J/cm, 2 respectively. Follow-up bronchoscopy for response assessment was performed at 1 and 6 months, respectively. ResultsThe rate of pathological complete response (CR) was 82. 4 % (14 of 17 evaluable lesions; 14 patients) at 1 month and 72. 7 % (8 / 11 evaluable lesions; 8 patients) at 6 months. Only four patients developed mild skin erythema. One of the three patients in the 150 J/cm 2 light dose group experienced a serious adverse event. This patient had respiratory distress caused by mucus plugging, which precipitated cardiac ischemia. Two additional patients treated subsequently at this light dose had no adverse events. The sixth patient in this dose group was not recruited and the study was terminated because of delays in HPPH supply. However, given the observed serious adverse event, it is recommended that the light dose does not exceed 125 J/cm 2. ConclusionsPDT with HPPH can be safely used for the treatment of CIS/MIC of the airways, with potential effectiveness comparable to that reported for <b>porfimer</b> <b>sodium</b> in earlier studies...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The role of {{photodynamic}} therapy (PDT) {{in the treatment}} of small cancers has been established in several clinical studies. Here, we report on the efficacy of PDT for early inoperable or recurrent non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Methods and Materials: From June 1989 to November 2004, 40 patients with 50 NSCLC were treated with PDT. Twelve cases were inoperable for medical reasons and were staged as T 1 N 0 M 0, and 28 had recurrent in situ carcinoma. Patients with residual disease after PDT received definitive radiotherapy and/or brachytherapy. Follow-up ranged from 6 to 167 months (median 43. 59).

40|$|Toenail onychomycosis is {{a common}} infection, {{affecting}} up to 14 % of the population. Moreover, poor penetration of topical drugs into the nail bed leads to frequent recurrences of the disease. The cure rate of toenail onychomycosis is estimated at 63 – 76 %. An alternative treatment for onychomycosis is photodynamic therapy. Following agents are used in this method: <b>porfimer</b> <b>sodium,</b> rose bengal, methylene blue, 5 -aminolevulinic acid and its derivative – methyl ester. The therapy is well tolerated Photodynamic therapy offers an opportunity to achieve a significant cure rate in patients who cannot receive oral therapy. Thanks to systematic improvements in photodynamic therapy, including better photosensitizer penetration into the nail bed and shorter exposure time, photodynamic therapy may be more efficient and cost-effective than other onychomycosis treatments. However, randomized clinical trials evaluating the efficacy of photodynamic therapy of onychomycosis are needed...|$|E
40|$|Photodynamic Therapy (PDT) {{is a new}} and {{minimally}} invasive cancer treatment modality based on the photo-activation of a light-sensitive drug ‘Photosensitiser’ (PS). PS can be administered in various forms (e. g. as injection or ointment) and accumulates selectively in the target tumour tissue. This activated drug in turn generates singlet oxygen (1 O 2) in the malignant tissue and induces tissue necrosis or apoptosis. In this thesis, we have implemented a simulation model utilising the primary processes that the photosensitiser undergoes {{in the presence of}} irradiating light and molecular oxygen (3 O 2). We have used spectroscopic data of the commercially available and clinically significant photosensitiser ‘Photofrin®’ (<b>porfimer</b> <b>sodium,</b> Axcan Pharma, Montreal, Canada, a heterogeneous mixture of porphyrins). This model encourages predictive statements to be made regarding the efficiency of photodynamic modalities at various initial conditions, including PS concentration and tissue oxygen concentration...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Recently, {{several new}} {{endoscopic}} treatments {{have been used}} to treat patients with Barrett's esophagus with high grade dysplasia. This systematic review aimed to determine the safety and effectiveness of these treatments compared with esophagectomy. Methods A comprehensive literature search was undertaken to identify studies of endoscopic treatments for Barrett's esophagus or early stage esophageal cancer. Information from the selected studies was extracted by two independent reviewers. Study quality was assessed and information was tabulated to identify trends or patterns. Results were pooled across studies for each outcome. Safety (occurrence of adverse events) and effectiveness (complete eradication of dysplasia) were compared across different treatments. Results The 101 studies that met the selection criteria included 8 endoscopic techniques and esophagectomy; only 12 were comparative studies. The quality of evidence was generally low. Methods and outcomes were inconsistently reported. Protocols, outcomes measured, follow-up times and numbers of treatment sessions varied, making it difficult to calculate pooled estimates. The surgical mortality rate was 1. 2 %, compared to 0. 04 % in 2831 patients treated endoscopically (1 death). Adverse events were more severe and frequent with esophagectomy, and included anastomotic leaks (9. 4 %), wound infections (4. 1 %) and pulmonary complications (4. 1 %). Four patients (0. 1 %) treated endoscopically experienced bleeding requiring transfusions. The stricture rate with esophagectomy (5. 3 %) was lower than with <b>porfimer</b> <b>sodium</b> photodynamic therapy (18. 5 %), but higher than aminolevulinic acid (ALA) 60 mg/kg PDT (1. 4 %). Dysphagia and odynophagia varied in frequency across modalities, with the highest rates reported for multipolar electrocoagulation (MPEC). Photosensitivity, an adverse event that occurs only with photodynamic therapy, was experienced by 26. 4 % of patients who received <b>porfimer</b> <b>sodium.</b> Some radiofrequency ablation (RFA) or argon plasma coagulation (APC) studies (used in multiple sessions) reported rates of almost 100 % for complete eradication of dysplasia. But the study methods and findings were not adequately described. The other studies of endoscopic treatments reported similarly high rates of complete eradication. Conclusions Endoscopic treatments offer safe and effective alternatives to esophagectomy for patients with Barrett's esophagus and high grade dysplasia. Unfortunately, shortcomings in the published studies make it impossible to determine the comparative effectiveness of each of the endoscopic treatments. </p...|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{object of}} the present study was to {{evaluate}} the feasibility of photody-namic therapy (PDT) for malignant melanomas through in vivo and in vitro processes. Methods: Photofrin ® (<b>porfimer</b> <b>sodium)</b> was evaluated through in vitro processes with human malignant melanoma cells (MMCs). The in vitro absorption and pho-tosensitizing activity of Photofrin ® was examined in an MMC culture system. The in vivo biological activity of Photofrin ® applied to subcutaneous implant-ed melanoma (SIM) in nude mice and exposed to different total light dosages at 630 nm was studied by determining the destruction of the tumors. Subcelluar localization and binding were observed under a fluorescent con-focal microscope. Results: MMCs incubated with Photofrin ® at a concentration of about 3. 5 µg/ml and exposed to laser light at 630 nm with a power density of 100 mW/cm 2, showed 50 % cell killing. An electron microscopic study demonstrated signif-icant destruction of the target after PDT. Conclusion: Detection of the photosensitizer Photofrin ® was localized and its distribution fully observed.

40|$|Photodynamic therapy (PDT), a {{treatment}} for cancer, uses a photosensitizer and laser irradiation to produce reactive oxygen in cells. In Japan, the United States, and many other countries, PDT is {{a treatment}} option for stage 0 (TisN 0 M 0) and stage I (T 1 N 0 M 0) centrally located early stage lung cancer. PDT can preserve lung function, can be repeated, and can be combined with other therapeutic modalities such as chemotherapy. Recently, mono-l-aspartyl chlorine e 6 (NPe 6, Laserphyrin), a second-generation photosensitizer with lower photosensitivity than Photofrin (<b>porfimer</b> <b>sodium),</b> {{was approved by the}} Japanese government and a phase II clinical study using NPe 6 with a new diode laser demonstrated an excellent antitumor effect and low skin photosensitivity. We expect PDT to be widely employed in many fields and the applications of PDT to be extended because of the decreasing cost of laser equipment and lower systemic photosensitivity induced by the photosensitizer. The purpose of this review is to introduce not only recent clinical trials of PDT for centrally located early lung cancer, but also new applications of PDT for cases of peripheral-type, early-stage lung cancers. We also discuss the applications of PDT for advanced lung cancer and combined therapy using PDT and other treatments for lung cancer...|$|E

Aim: In the present study, we assessed the pharmacokinetics {{as well as the}} safety profiles of porfimer after a first and a second dose administered 30 to 45 days apart in patients undergoing PDT. Methods: Nineteen patients (16 with cholangiocarcinoma) were enrolled. <b>Porfimer</b> <b>sodium</b> was administered by i. v. injection over 3 - 5 minutes. Blood samples were collected prior to starting i. v. drug injection and post-dose at different time points after the first and second administrations. Results: Porfimer exposure values after the second administration were statistically higher than those observed after the first administration, suggesting a slight accumulation of porfimer following repeated administration. The apparent mean elimination half-life of porfimer increased from 410 hr after the first administration to 725 hr after the second administration. The safety profiles of porfimer after a first and a second administration were similar and did not raise additional concern. Eight patients experienced 9 serious adverse events. Only photosensitivity was deemed study-drug related. Conclusion: Porfimer appears to display a safe and tolerable profile when used in patients requiring a second PDT within 45 days...|$|E

In this preclinical study, we investigated tissue damage of the canine normal esophagus caused by photoactivation with Laserphyrin. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Diode laser irradiation was performed at 60 min after administration. An area 5 cm oral to the esophagogastric junction was irradiated at 25 J/cm(2), 50 J/cm(2), and 100 J/cm(2) using a three-step escalation. The irradiated areas were evaluated endoscopically on postirradiation days 1 and 7, and were subjected to histological examination after autopsy.

40|$|Background: Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a {{minimally}} invasive treatment modality for early and superficial malignancy or premalignancy {{in the head and}} neck regions. However, few studies have examined the use of Photofrin-mediated PDT to manage early carcinoma and dysplasia in the oral cavity. Methods: Between January 2004 and November 2008, 25 T 1 to T 2 patients with N 0 oral squamous cell carcinoma and mucosal dysplasia in the oral cavity were treated by <b>Porfimer</b> <b>sodium</b> (Photofrin®) -mediated PDT at Nagasaki University Hospital. Clinical responses were evaluated according to the guidelines of the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). After the PDT and a 2 -year follow-up period, disease specific survival rates were then calculated. Results: A total of 30 regions in 25 patients (18 with squamous cell carcinoma and 7 with epithelial dysplasia with hyperkeratosis in the oral cavity) were treated by PDT. Complete response was achieved in 24 of the 25 patients (96 %), with a partial response found in the remaining patient. For the three patients who exhibited recurrence at 4, 5, and 15 months after PDT, salvage surgery or a second PDT was performed. Of these three patients, one died due to another disease, while one died due to local lymphatic metastasis that occurred during the follow-up period. Overall, the disease specific survival rate was 95. 8 %. Treatment-related edema and pain emerged within 24. h after irradiation. Pain control using non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs and opiates was required for 3 - 4 weeks in all patients. Complete healing was attained at 4 - 6 weeks after the treatment. No persistent problems related to functional or esthetic outcomes were noted...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS: Patients with cancers of {{the head}} and neck have a strong {{tendency}} to develop early synchronous and metachronous carcinomas of the esophagus. In many of these patients, whose general condition is poor as a result of alcohol and tobacco abuse, the second primary cancers require minimally invasive treatment. The aims of this study were to evaluate the efficacy of photodynamic therapy for the treatment of early esophageal carcinomas and to compare the results obtained with three different photosensitizers (hematoporphyrin derivative), <b>porfimer</b> <b>sodium</b> (Photofrin II), and meta-(tetrahydroxyphenyl) chlorin (m-THPC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-one early squamous cell carcinomas (Tis or T 1 a) of the esophagus were treated by photodynamic therapy in 24 patients. Nine tumors were treated with hematoporphyrin derivative, eight with Photofrin II and 14 with m-THPC. RESULTS: The early cancers were cured in 84 % of patients after a mean follow-up period of 2 years. Because the number of cases included in each group was small, the differences in recurrence rates for the different photosensitizers could not be evaluated statistically, but m-THPC was more phototoxic, induced a shorter period of photosensitization of the skin, and had better selectivity than either of the other photosensitizers. There were four major complications: two stenoses and two esophagotracheal fistulas. CONCLUSIONS: Photodynamic therapy eradicates early squamous cell carcinomas (Tis and T 1 a) of the esophagus efficiently. Transmural necroses leading to fistulas can be avoided by using a low-penetrating wavelength of laser light (green light at 514. 5 m instead of red light at 630 or 652 nm).

40|$|AIM: To {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} photodynamic therapy (PDT) on metal stent patency in patients with unresectable hilar cholangiocarcinoma (CC). METHODS: This was a retrospective analysis of patients with hilar CC referred to our institution from December, 1999 to January, 2011. Out of 232 patients, thirty-three patients with unresectable hilar CC were treated. Eighteen patients in the PDT group were treated with uncovered metal stents after one session of PDT. Fifteen patients {{in the control group}} were treated with metal stents alone. <b>Porfimer</b> <b>sodium</b> (2 mg/kg) was administered intravenously to PDT patients. Forty-eight hours later, PDT was administered using a diffusing fiber that was advanced across the tumor by either endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography or percutaneous cholangiography. After performance of PDT, uncovered metal stents were inserted to ensure adequate decompression and bile drainage. Patient survival rates and cumulative stent patency were calculated using Kaplan-Meier analysis with the log-rank test. RESULTS: The PDT and control patients were comparable with respect to age, gender, health status, pre-treatment bilirubin, and hilar CC stage. When compared to control, the PDT group was associated with significantly prolonged stent patency (median 244 1; 66 and 177 1; 45 d, respectively, P = 0. 002) and longer patient survival (median 356 1; 213 and 230 1; 73 d, respectively, P = 0. 006). Early complication rates were similar between the groups (PDT group 17 %, control group 13 %) and all patients were treated conservatively. Stent malfunctions occurred in 14 PDT patients (78 %) and 12 control patients (80 %). Of these 26 patients, twenty-two were treated endoscopically and four were treated with external drainage. CONCLUSION: Metal stenting after one session of PDT may be safe with acceptable complication rates.

40|$|Background and Objective: Photodynamic therapy (PDT) may be {{used for}} {{ablation}} of high grade dysplasia and/or early cancer (HGD/T 1) in Barrett's esophagus. A complication of PDT is esophageal stricture. The objective {{of this study was to}} find the lowest light dose to potentially reduce the incidence of strictures while effectively ablating HGDITI. Materials and Methods: Patients (n= 1 13) with HGD/T 1 received an intravenous injection of <b>porfimer</b> <b>sodium</b> (2 mg/kg). Three days later, laser light (630 nm) was delivered using a cylindrical diffuser inserted in a 20 mm-diameter PDT balloon. Patients were treated at light doses of 1 1 5 J/cm, I 05 J/cm, 95 J/cm and 85 Jlcm. The efficacy was determined by four quadrant biopsies of the treated area three months after PDT. The formation of stricture was determined by the incidence of dysphagia and the need for esophageal dilation. Strictures were considered mild if they required less that 6 dilations, and severe if 6 or more dilations were required. Efficacy and incidence of strictures were tabulated as a funôtion of light dose. Results: Using I 15 J/cm, there were 17 % of patients with residual HGD/T 1 after one treatment. However, when the light doses of I 05 J/cm, 95 J/cm and 85 J/cm were used, the residual HGD/T 1 after one PDT session was increased to 33 %, 30 % and 32 %, respectively. The overall incidence of strictures (mild and severe) was not correlated to the light dose. However, the incidence of severe strictures was directly proportional to the light dose. Using the light dose of I I 5 J/cm, I 5. 3 % of patients developed severe strictures compared to about 5 % in the groups of patients who received the lower light doses. Conclusions: Decreasing the light dose below I I 5 J/cm doubled the rate of residual HGD/T 1 after one treatment while reducing the incidence of severe strictures to one-third of cases from I I 5 JIcm. The results {{may be used}} to evaluate the risks and benefits of different light doses...|$|E
40|$|AIM: To compare effectiveness, safety, {{and cost}} of {{photodynamic}} therapy (PDT) and radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in treatment of Barrett&#x 2019;s dysplasia (BD). METHODS: Consecutive case series of patients undergoing either PDT or RFA treatment at single center by a single investigator were compared. Thirty-three patients with high-grade dysplasia (HGD) had treatment with <b>porfimer</b> <b>sodium</b> photosensitzer and 630 nm laser (130 J/cm), with maximum of 3 treatment sessions. Fifty-three patients with BD (47 with low-grade dysplasia -LGD, 6 with HGD) had step-wise circumferential and focal ablation using the HALO system with maximum of 4 treatment sessions. Both groups received proton pump inhibitors twice daily. Endoscopic biopsies were acquired at 2 and 12 mo after enrollment, with 4 -quadrant biopsies every 1 cm of the original BE extent. A complete histological resolution response of BD (CR-D) was defined as all biopsies at the last endoscopy session negative for BD. Fisher&#x 2019;s exact {{test was used to}} assess differences between the two study groups for primary outcomes. For all outcomes, a two-sided P value of less than 0. 05 was considered to indicate statistical significance. RESULTS: Thirty (91 %) PDT patients and 39 (74 %) RFA were men (P = 0. 05). The mean age was 70. 7 1; 12. 2 and 65. 4 1; 12. 7 (P = 0. 10) year and mean length of BE was 5. 4 1; 3. 2 cm and 5. 7 1; 3. 2 cm (P = 0. 53) for PDT and RFA patients, respectively. The CR-D was (18 / 33) 54. 5 % with PDT vs (47 / 53) 88. 7 % with RFA (P = 0. 001). One patient with PDT had an esophageal perforation and was managed with non-surgical measures and no perforation was seen with RFA. PDT was five times more costly than RFA at our institution. The two groups were not randomized and had different BD grading are the limitations of the study. CONCLUSION: In our experience, RFA had higher rate of CR-D without any serious adverse events and was less costly than PDT for endoscopic treatment of BD...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{clinically}} {{evaluate a}} new photosensitizer, m-tetra(hydroxyphenyl) chlorin (m-THPC), for the photodynamic therapy of early squamous cell carcinomas {{of the upper}} aerodigestive tract. DESIGN: Phase 1 included evaluation of the innocuousness of the compound after intravenous injection (control of vital parameters and blood analysis before and after injection) and evaluation of the duration of skin photosensitization. Phase 2 included assessment of optimal conditions for treatment (injected dose, drug-light interval, light dose, wavelength, etc), on 33 early squamous cell carcinomas of the mouth, esophagus, and bronchi, with a mean follow-up of 14 months; irradiation tests on healthy and neoplastic mucosae to determine the irradiation conditions that lead to tumor eradication with minimal damage to the surrounding normal mucosa and muscle layers; and localization of the dye in various tissue compartments and cells at different time intervals after the injection of the photosensitizer, by using a fluorescence microscope to analyze 46 biopsy specimens taken during the treatment sessions and 8 resected specimens of early cancers, excised with the carbon dioxide laser. SETTING: Endoscopic medical center of an {{otolaryngology-head and neck surgery}} department. PATIENTS: Twenty-five patients treated previously for a head and neck cancer with a synchronous or metachronous early second primary cancer. Patients with porphyria were excluded from the trial. RESULTS: The best results in the bronchi and mouth were obtained with an injected dose of 0. 15 mg of m-THPC per kilogram of body weight 4 days before irradiation. The fluence was 7 to 16 J/cm 2, and the fluence rate was between 100 and 150 mW/cm 2 using red light at 652 nm. In the esophagus, green light at 514 nm is preferred to the red light to avoid fistulas. Optimal irradiation conditions at this wavelength, which was also used in the trachea, were found at a fluence of 75 to 100 J/cm 2 and a fluence rate between 70 and 100 mW/cm 2. Of 33 lesions treated thus far by photodynamic therapy with m-THPC, 28 show no recurrence with a mean follow-up of 14 months. Photosensitivity to sunlight does not exceed 6 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: m-Tetra(hydroxyphenyl) chlorin is a second-generation photosensitizer that has several significant advantages as compared with the first-generation porphyrin mixtures hematoporphyrin derivative and <b>porfimer</b> <b>sodium</b> (Photofrin II). It is a pure compound that is 100 times more phototoxic at 652 nm and 10 times more photoxic at 514 nm, has better selectivity for early carcinomas, and a shorter duration of skin photosensitivity.

40|$|Introduction The {{incidence}} of oesophageal adenocarcinoma is increasing significantly with Scotland having {{the highest rates}} in Western Europe. Despite this oesophageal cancer {{continues to be a}} late presenting malignancy with treatment options limited to palliative therapy in up to 80 % of cases. The identification of patients with Barrett's High Grade Dysplasia (HGD) or early oesophageal cancer therefore remains a priority. Such patients with HGD in Barrett's oesophagus or early carcinoma often have medical co-morbidity precluding them from radical therapy in the form of surgical resection or chemoradiotherapy. The development of less invasive endoscopic therapy to treat such superficial disease is also therefore a priority. Endoscopic therapies {{have been shown to be}} safe with minimal morbidity and mortality and as an alternative potentially curative therapy in early malignant disease and satisfactory palliation in locally advanced disease of the oesophagus. The optimal endoscopic treatment for HGD and early cancer however is not yet fully established. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a new evolving treatment involving administration of a photosensitiser with subsequent endoscopic activation with laser light to treat pre-malignant and malignant disease of the oesophagus. Aim This thesis aims to explore the role of PDT in the treatment of neoplastic disease of the oesophagus. Patients Between 1999 and 2011, three patient populations have been assessed: 1) HGD Barrett's oesophagus, 2) early T 1 oesophageal cancer and 3) locally advanced inoperable oesophageal cancer. 1) Twenty one patients with HGD in Barrett's oesophagus, 16 male and median age 70 years who were unfit for oesophagectomy due to medical co-morbidity were treated with PDT. 2) Thirty eight patients, 21 male median age 72 years were treated with PDT with curative intent for early T 1 oesophageal carcinoma in this surgical unit. These patients were staged with a combination of endoscopy, CT and EUS and were unsuitable for radical treatment due to co-morbidity. 3) Twenty five patients with locally advanced oesophageal cancer with or without metastases, 16 male, median age 79 years were treated with PDT as a palliative therapy for dysphagia. A second group of 25 patients previously treated with self expanding metal stents (SEMS) between 1998 and 2000 were used as a comparative group. Methods All patients were discussed at the regional MDT and were given visual and written information regarding PDT. All patients were treated as inpatients and received <b>porfimer</b> <b>sodium</b> IV at 2 mg/kg bodyweight with laser light activation at 630 nm 48 hours later. The laser light dose for HGD patients was 100 - 200 J/cm and 300 J/cm for early cancer and palliation. Patients remained on long term high dose proton pump inhibitor post procedure. Patients returned at 6 to 12 weekly intervals for repeat endoscopy and biopsy in the HGD and early cancer cohorts. Data has been collated prospectively for patients with HGD and early cancer and both retrospectively and prospectively for the palliative patients. CRP levels pre and post- PDT in the early cancer cohort were evaluated to investigate the inflammatory response after PDT. Results Patients treated with PDT for HGD in Barrett's oesophagus had a median follow up of 62 months (2 - 114 months). Overall twenty of 21 patients were assessed (one died of a non procedure related cause 3 weeks post PDT). Patients had a median number of 1. 5 PDT sessions (range 1 - 2). Overall 17 / 20 (85 %) patients remained free of HGD at a median follow up of 5 years. Three patients developed adenocarcinoma at 47, 48 and 54 months giving a cancer progression rate of 15 %. During the treatment period 4 / 20 developed recurrence of HGD but are now dysplasia free after repeat PDT (three patients) and radiofrequency ablation (RFA) (one patient). There was a significant reduction in length of Barrett's segment pre and post- PDT from median 5 to 3 cm (range 0 - 12 cm) p= 0. 035 respectively. Patients with early oesophageal cancer had a median follow up of 40 months (1 to 123 months). All patients were staged as T 0 N 0 or T 1 N 0. Twenty six out of 38 (68 %) had a complete endoscopic and histological response to treatment 6 - 8 weeks post- PDT. Overall 50 % developed recurrent carcinoma at a median of 8 months. The remaining 50 % of patients with initial complete response remain disease free or were disease free until time of death. One third of patients died of non oesophageal cancer related causes. PDT induced a systemic inflammatory response with a median rise in CRP of 466 %. Patients with a baseline CRP 10 mgl- 1. As a palliative therapy PDT had no effect on quality of life despite significant improvement in dysphagia. Such patients however having PDT had improved survival compared to those having self expanding metal stents (SEMS) : 132. 5 vs 105 days respectively. In health economics terms the cost per day survival however was similar for PDT and SEMS. Conclusion Photodynamic therapy successfully ablates HGD in Barrett's oesophagus and may be used with curative intent in early cancer for those patients who have no alternative radical option. PDT improves survival in patients with locally advanced oesophageal cancer compared to SEMS with no alteration in quality of life and similar costs. The survival benefit may be secondary to immune modulation by PDT rather than through a systemic inflammatory response effect...|$|E
