Much of her <b>pale</b> <b>shoulders</b> are bared by the neckline of her dark dress, which appears to have some type of linen frill at the bust. Her hair is dark and unstyled and hangs down to the crook of her neck. The background is also dark and paints no specific scene...|$|R

50|$|The Christmas emerald dove {{is a small}} {{brownish}} pigeon {{with green}} wings. It is some 23-26 cm long, with a 43-46 cm wingspan and a weight of 80-135 g. It is smaller than the mainland Australian subspecies of the dove and differs from them by the adult male having a contrasting light grey cap, with a prominent white forehead, white supercilium extending behind the eye, and a mainly rufous-brown shoulder patch with only a narrow white line along the edge. The adult female has a darker, red-brown head, neck and underparts, lacking the grey and white on the head {{as well as the}} <b>pale</b> <b>shoulder</b> patch.|$|R

The eye in the dark maintained its unblinking vigilance.|$|R

50|$|In non-breeding plumage, {{the black}} plumage is {{replaced}} by heavily streaked buffy-brown, and the bill is <b>pale.</b> The yellow <b>shoulders</b> and rump remain, and are a distinction from the female which lacks the contrasting colour patches.

40|$|Data {{protection}} {{is in your}} hands, even your data lands {{in the lap of}} service providers. Cloud computing is a new and emerging concept in the field of IT. It means do everything over the internet and put burden on the <b>shoulders</b> of <b>cloud’s</b> service providers. Individuals or business organizations are hesitant to do their tasks over public networks like internet. They can’t leave their sensitive data in the hands of service providers. It is due to lack of confidence and trust on service providers. Protecting customer’s sensitive data on cloud is the major issue. Here authors purposed a strategy to protect customer’s sensitive data before sending it towards service providers. The strategy consists of a barrier (Encryption Queue) to protect customer’s data. With the use of this strategy, encryption procedure will {{be in the hands of}} customers themselves. This concept will help to built up customer’s trust and will prepare them to shift desktop based applications over the cloud...|$|R
60|$|Suddenly {{he heard}} a sharp report and {{something}} struck the water smartly within {{a few inches of}} his head, spattering his face with spray. He heard a second report, and saw one of the sentinels with his rifle at his <b>shoulder,</b> a light <b>cloud</b> of blue smoke rising from the muzzle. The man in the water saw the eye of the man on the bridge gazing into his own through the sights of the rifle. He observed that it was a gray eye and remembered having read that gray eyes were keenest, and that all famous markmen had them. Nevertheless, this one had missed.|$|R
5000|$|... (Original description) The small {{shell is}} brownish, with a {{tendency}} to banding, <b>paler</b> at the <b>shoulder</b> and on the base. It contains six whorls, including a small, smooth protoconch whorl. The suture is distinct, slightly appressed, with no fasciolar constriction. The spiral sculpture consists of fine flattish threads separated by narrow striae very minutely reticulated by the incremental lines and most conspicuous in the intervals between the ribs, practically covering the whole surface of the shell. The axial sculpture, beside almost microscopic lines of growth, consists of (on the body whorl 14) short roundedribs, slightly angulated at the shoulder and extending from the suture to the siphonal canal with subequal interspaces. The anal sulcus is shallow. The aperture is narrow and simple. The inner lip is erased. The siphonal canal is short, and straight.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Introduction Septic {{arthritis}} of the {{sternoclavicular joint}} is rare, comprising approximately 0. 5 % to 1 % of all joint infections. Predisposing causes include immunocompromising {{diseases such as}} diabetes, HIV infection, renal failure and intravenous drug abuse. Case presentation We report a rare case of bilateral sternoclavicular joint septic arthritis in an elderly patient secondary to an indwelling right subclavian vein catheter. The insidious nature of the presentation is highlighted. We also review the literature regarding the epidemiology, investigation and methods of treatment of the condition. Conclusion SCJ infections are rare, and require {{a high degree of}} clinical suspicion. Vague symptoms of neck and <b>shoulder</b> pain may <b>cloud</b> the initial diagnosis, {{as was the case in}} our patient. Surgical intervention is often required; however, our patient avoided major intervention and settled with parenteral antibiotics and washout of the joint. </p...|$|R
60|$|We {{left the}} great {{inverted}} arch {{of the valley}} behind us, looking back {{as long as we}} could at Blencathra, and Skiddaw over its <b>shoulder,</b> and the <b>clouds</b> were gathering over them at our last glimpse. Passing by Dummail Raise (which is a mound of stones over an old British king), we entered Westmoreland, and soon had the vale of Grasmere before us, with the church where Wordsworth lies, and Nab Scaur and Rydal Water farther on. At Ambleside we took another car for Newby Bridge, whither we drove along the eastern shore of Windermere. The superb scenery through which we had been passing made what we now saw look tame, although a week ago we should have thought it more than commonly interesting. Hawkshead is the only village on our road,--a small, whitewashed old town, with a whitewashed old Norman church, low, and with a low tower, on the same pattern with others that we have seen hereabouts. It was between seven and eight o'clock when we reached Newby Bridge, and heard U----'s voice greeting us, and saw her head, crowned with a wreath of flowers, looking down at us, out of the window of our parlor.|$|R
60|$|The nurse led the way--tall, lithe, graceful--attired in {{her uniform}} dress of neat black stuff, with plain linen collar and cuffs, {{and with the}} scarlet cross of the Geneva Convention {{embroidered}} on her left <b>shoulder.</b> <b>Pale</b> and sad, her expression and manner both eloquently suggestive of suppressed suffering and sorrow, there was an innate nobility in the carriage of this woman's head, an innate grandeur in the gaze of her large gray eyes and in the lines of her finely proportioned face, which made her irresistibly striking and beautiful, seen under any circumstances and clad in any dress. Her companion, darker in complexion and smaller in stature, possessed attractions which were quite marked enough {{to account for the}} surgeon's polite anxiety to shelter her in the captain's room. The common consent of mankind would have declared her to be an unusually pretty woman. She wore the large gray cloak that covered her from head to foot with a grace that lent its own attractions to a plain and even a shabby article of dress. The languor in her movements, and the uncertainty of tone in her voice as she thanked the surgeon suggested that she was suffering from fatigue. Her dark eyes searched the dimly-lighted room timidly, and she held fast by the nurse's arm with the air of a woman whose nerves had been severely shaken by some recent alarm.|$|R
5|$|Kadaj confronts Rufus Shinra, who reveals he {{possesses}} the box containing Jenova's remains. He attempts to destroy it, but Kadaj manages {{to save it}} and flees the city with his companions. Yazoo and Loz are apparently destroyed along the way by an explosive planted by Shinra's agents. Cloud chases Kadaj down and engages him in battle, ultimately subduing him. Outmatched, Kadaj opens Jenova's box and fuses with its contents, transforming into Sephiroth. He then tells Cloud {{that he will be}} able to use the life essences of Geostigma sufferers to achieve complete domination over the planet. He and Cloud then fight, and throughout the whole encounter, Sephiroth appears to have the upper hand, flinging Cloud repeatedly into walls and finally impaling him through the <b>shoulder.</b> He asks <b>Cloud</b> to tell him what he most cherishes so that he can have the pleasure of taking it away. To this, Cloud replies that he cherishes everything, then pulls out Sephiroth's sword and deals him a hail of devastating blows. Sephiroth's spirit departs, leaving behind the mortally wounded Kadaj. As he lies dying in Cloud's arms, a healing rain starts falling across the land, curing the people of their Geostigma. Yazoo and Loz appear and confront Cloud; he charges at them, and they set off a massive explosion engulfing the three.|$|R
60|$|Margaret, {{the eldest}} of the four, was sixteen, and very pretty, being plump and fair, with large eyes, plenty of soft brown hair, a sweet mouth, and white hands, of which she was rather vain. Fifteen-year-old Jo was very tall, thin, and brown, and {{reminded}} one of a colt, for she never seemed {{to know what to}} do with her long limbs, which were very much in her way. She had a decided mouth, a comical nose, and sharp, gray eyes, which appeared to see everything, and were by turns fierce, funny, or thoughtful. Her long, thick hair was her one beauty, but it was usually bundled into a net, to be out of her way. Round shoulders had Jo, big hands and feet, a flyaway look to her clothes, and the uncomfortable appearance of a girl who was rapidly shooting up into a woman and didn't like it. Elizabeth, or Beth, as everyone called her, was a rosy, smooth-haired, bright-eyed girl of thirteen, with a shy manner, a timid voice, and a peaceful expression which was seldom disturbed. Her father called her 'Little Miss Tranquility', and the name suited her excellently, for she seemed to live in a happy world of her own, only venturing out to meet the few whom she trusted and loved. Amy, though the youngest, was a most important person, in her own opinion at least. A regular snow maiden, with blue eyes, and yellow hair curling on her <b>shoulders,</b> <b>pale</b> and slender, and always carrying herself like a young lady mindful of her manners. What the characters of the four sisters were we will leave to be found out.|$|R
