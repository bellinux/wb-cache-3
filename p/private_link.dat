5000|$|The term {{landline}} is {{also used}} to describe a connection between two or more points that consists of a dedicated physical cable, as opposed to an always-available <b>private</b> <b>link</b> that is actually implemented as a circuit in a wired switched system (usually the public switched telephone network). So-called leased lines are invariably of the latter type; the implications of a land line in this context are security and survivability. For example, a military headquarters might be linked to front-line units [...] "by landline" [...] to ensure that communication remains possible even if the conventional telephone network is damaged or destroyed. Another example of this is in airports. All air traffic control towers have dedicated lines connected to the police, fire department, hospitals, army, etc. Deployed as a precaution in case of emergency, these can be used at any time.|$|E

However, Wreden had seen that many of the games are based on themes of prisons, isolation, and difficulty in communicating with others, and as Coda's games took a darker tone and took much longer to produce, focusing even more strongly on dialogue that implied that game development was no longer a positive activity for Coda. Wreden felt concerned that Coda was feeling depressed and weighed down by game development, and took it upon himself to show some of Coda's game concepts to others to get feedback to help encourage Coda to develop more. However, this in turn led to Coda to draw into seclusion. At some point in 2011, Wreden believed Coda had stopped making games, until he was sent an email with a <b>private</b> <b>link</b> to a final game by Coda.|$|E

30|$|The {{implementation}} of localization techniques assists {{in the identification}} of intruders by intrusion detection systems that mainly target the mitigation of more sophisticated and aggressive attacks addressing the communications protocol state machine. Most intruder identification and isolation schemes which are based on monitoring the network traffic and are lacking localization tools are only effective against a limited subset of attacks like denial of service. On the contrary, the detection of more aggressive attacks like the case of the black-hole intruder (which is trying to deceive the network operation by advertising that it has a fake shortest route to the destination node) or of a wormhole attack (where two malicious nodes create a tunnel to divert network traffic through a <b>private</b> <b>link)</b> requires the {{implementation of}} localization tools. In such cases, the possibility of getting information about the position of the network nodes allows a monitoring system to detect inconsistencies between the logical topology of the network and the physical situation of the nodes and then triggers the proper networking actions.|$|E

40|$|Currently, most of {{the online}} social {{networks}} (OSN) keep their data secret and in centralized manner. Researchers are allowed to crawl the underlying social graphs (and data) but with limited rates, leading to only partial views of the true social graphs. To overcome this constraint, we may start from user perspective, the contributors of the OSNs. More precisely, if users cautiously collaborate with one another, they can use the very infrastructure of the OSNs to exchange noisy friend lists with their neighbors in several rounds. In the end, they can build local subgraphs, also called local views of the true social graph. In this paper, we propose such protocols for the problem of <b>private</b> <b>link</b> exchange over social graphs. The problem is unique {{in the sense that}} the disseminated data over the links are the links themselves. However, there exist fundamental questions about the feasibility of this model. The first question is how to define simple and effective privacy concepts for the link exchange processes. The second question comes from the high volume of link lists in exchange which may increase exponentially round after round. While storage and computation complexity may be affordable for desktop PCs, communication costs are non-trivial. We address both questions by a simple (α,β) -exchange using Bloom filters...|$|E
40|$|Medium access {{mechanisms}} {{are one of}} the most important aspects of buses, which are shared mediums. Almost all standard buses use Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) as their medium access scheme. Such buses usually are multi-wire, very sensitive to time synchronization, and often managed by a master node. In this thesis, we develop new non-TDMA schemes for bus communications which are based on Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA), or Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA) that do not have the intrinsic limitations of traditional buses. The proposed schemes are based on a single wire bus setting. Since, in theory, any node can have a dedicated communication link to any other node on the bus, the nodes virtually form a fully-connected mesh, hence the name Mesh-Bus. In such schemes, no master node is required on the bus; therefore, we can have a distributed bus in which all the nodes have the same functionality. Also, no time synchronization is required. Every node, using its unique code/frequency, creates a virtual <b>private</b> <b>link</b> to the other nodes, and using such interference-resistant virtual private links, the nodes communicate data to each other. This dissertation explores the underlying principals of such non-TDMA schemes and through extensive software simulations investigates various scenarios in for CDMA scheme, and studies the performance for the system. Finally, a hardware implementation of the CDMA scheme is presented, and some experimental results are provided to validate the simulation results...|$|E
