5|$|Eliot {{began writing}} The Dry Salvages {{at the end}} of 1940 during air-raids on London, and managed to finish the poem quickly. The poem {{included}} many personal images connecting to Eliot's childhood, and emphasised the image of water and sailing as a metaphor for humanity. According to the poem, there is a connection to all of mankind within each man. If we just accept drifting upon the sea, then we will end up broken upon rocks. We are restrained by time, but the Annunciation gave mankind hope that {{it will be able to}} escape. This hope is not part of the present. What we must do is understand the patterns found within the <b>past</b> <b>in</b> order to see that there is meaning to be found. This meaning allows one to experience eternity through moments of revelation.|$|E
50|$|For group 2 verbs, {{the stem}} {{ends in a}} consonant, the infinitive ends in -a, and the present tense in -er. Group 2 verbs are further {{subdivided}} into group 2a and 2b.

For group 2b verbs, the <b>past</b> tense ends <b>in</b> -te and the <b>past</b> participle <b>in</b> -t, -t, and -ta. This is in turn decided by whether the stem ends in a voiced or a voiceless consonant. E.g. The stem of Heta (to be called) is het, and as t is a voiceless consonant the <b>past</b> tense ends <b>in</b> -te, making hette the past tense. If the stem ends in a voiced consonant however, as in Stör-a (to disturb), the <b>past</b> tense ends <b>in</b> -de making störde the past tense.|$|R
