The firm wishes to determine the production rate at each instant of that interval which will maximize profit, when adjustment of output incurs additional cost. In the paper we characterize the optimal solution and construct a forward algorithm which is shown to converge to the unique optimal solution.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} unlimitedThe maintenance of large military software systems is complex, involves users {{as well as}} software professionals, and requires appropriate management, {{which is one of}} the most important factors in efficient maintenance. Maintenance management requires information about the current state of the maintenance process that should be organized within a maintenance-oriented Enginering Database. This database should include all the necessary data about software changes, system configeration, maintenance task scheduling, etc., and it should be based on a realistic model of the maintenance process. This tesis proposes a mathematical Model of Software Maintenance that uses graphs to model the relationships between maintenance tasks and software components. The Model addresses the dynamic behavior of the maintenance process and supports priority and precedence of maintenance activities. The proposed Model of Software Maintenance provides a sound basis for implementation of a maintenance-oriented engineering database that supports automation of maintenance management, e. g., process control, task scheduling, job assignments, <b>planning</b> <b>and</b> <b>forecast,</b> gathering and interpretation of maintenance statistics and metrics, etc. Major, Israeli Air Forc...|$|E
30|$|Monitoring and {{understanding}} the distribution of tree species {{in the world is}} a major research agenda in plant ecology, especially under ongoing rapid global change (Enquist et al. 2016; Franklin et al. 2016). Estimating tree species distributions is ultimately needed in order to provide better understanding of tree diversity, a key driver of forest functioning (Paquette and Messier 2011; Pichancourt et al. 2014) and forest ecosystem service provisioning (Gamfeldt et al. 2013; Thompson et al. 2014). Species distributions constitute, in addition, basic information required in systemat;ic conservation <b>planning</b> <b>and</b> <b>forecast</b> range dynamics under future climate change (Franklin 2010; Serra-Diaz et al. 2012; Guisan et al. 2013; Zhang et al. 2017). The extent to which populations will respond to climate change is thought to depend upon variation in geographic distribution, phenotypic variation, response to CO 2 fertilization, strength of selection, fecundity, and degree of biotic interactions (Franklin et al. 2016). For example, certain geographic locations such as the Amazon basin, western United States, boreal forests, southern Europe, and Australia appear to be more susceptible to forest loss due to region specific heightened changes in temperature and precipitation (Allen et al. 2010; Choat et al. 2012). Further, widespread species with large populations and high fecundity are more likely to persist and adapt, but species with small populations, fragmented ranges, or low fecundity, may be more at risk for population collapse and may be candidates for facilitated migration. We currently lack a general assessment of global tree distributions, which limits our understanding of forest function, may dangerously over-simplify climate change projections, and hampers effective conservation planning under the ongoing planetary anthropogenic change.|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the economic and}} policy context for environmental investments in the candidate countries from Central and Eastern Europe. This context is created by macroeconomic constraints, the unfinished process of transition and the requirements of membership. The task of this paperback book is to identify these constraints and point to policy options for decision-makers {{on both sides of}} the enlargement process. Experts originally estimated the investment cost for the CEECs to achieve compliance with the environmental acquis at around 3 - 4 % of GDP over 20 years. The Commission now assumes they need to spend between 2 and 3 % of GDP “in the coming years”. But, as Wolfgang Hager explains in detail in the book, these are largely crude investment costs and do not include operational and financial follow-on costs which may be borne by the public budget. Commonly accepted prudential limits on public spending for the CEEC economies suggest a maximum expenditure on the environment – investment, financial charges and operational costs added together – of around 2. 5 % of GDP per annum. This translates into a mathematical necessity for transition periods expressed in decades rather than years. The study argues that there are policy options available to substantially reduce the gap between the desirable and the possible. The present impasse results in part from a <b>planning</b> <b>and</b> <b>forecast</b> exercise that is based on multiplying quantities, taken as given, with equipment and operating costs, taken as given. This study seeks to demonstrate that the main constraint is budgetary rather than macroeconomic and that the full scope for off-budget investments therefore needs to be exploited. The author also finds there is a large scope for policies directed at improving efficiency: achieving the greatest environmental benefit from a given amount of resources...|$|E

40|$|BackgroundSeasonal {{fluctuations}} in tuberculosis (TB) notifications {{have been identified}} and reported {{in a number of}} countries. Nigeria remains one of the 22 TB high-burden countries (HBCs) in the world, and the notification of TB cases in the country over the years has shown a definite pattern that suggests seasonal variation. Previous studies conducted in India, Japan, Mongolia, the Netherlands, Russia, Spain, the United Kingdom and the United States have evaluated the seasonality of TB notification. However, in Nigeria, there has been no systematic study to establish that this pattern is not just a myth. This study seeks to establish the seasonal variations suggested by the trend pattern of TB case notification (all forms of TB) in Nigeria over the past ten years. MethodThe yearly TB notification data in Nigeria from 2004 to 2013 was examined for seasonal fluctuations by plotting the quarterly notification figures for the years under review. A rapid trend analysis was done based on the amplitude of the fluctuating curves. Standardization was done by zones. ResultsThe trend analysis showed a spike {{in the first quarter of}} the year for the ten-year period studied (with the exception of 2005 and 2011). This quarter is generally characterized by the dusty, dry harmattan wind in most parts of the country, particularly the northern region. The curves generally plummeted in the third quarter and remained in that neighborhood for the rest of the year. The differences in case notification between the first and last quarter for the ten-year period ranged from 347 to 4230 cases notified. The result of this trend analysis when standardized by zones for the six zones of the country was similar to the overall result for the country. ConclusionAccording to the results of this study, there is evidence to suggest that there are seasonal variations in notification of TB cases across the four quarters of the year. This has significant implications for TB control strategies. Further investigation of the reasons for seasonal variations may help to identify risk factors. Also, <b>planning</b> <b>and</b> <b>forecast</b> of TB commodities to order cannot be based on experience from the preceding quarters, but must rather be based on reports from the same quarter in the previous year.
