25|$|A {{public meeting}} {{was held in}} December 2011 to discuss the future goals and designs of Union Station, with ideas being {{exchanged}} on how the station can accommodate the expected 40 percent growth in passengers by 2040. The results of this dialogue were incorporated into the May 2012 Chicago Union Station Master Plan Study. The study, led by the Chicago Department of Transportation (CDOT), in collaboration of Amtrak (station owner), Metra (station’s primary tenant), and other local and federal organizations, calls for increasing the station’s capacity and quality of service. According to the City of Chicago’s website on the study, short-term improvements call for improving station entrances and expanding waiting rooms, as well as enhancing bus lanes on Clinton and Canal Streets and creating a bus terminal on Jackson Boulevard between Canal and Clinton. For the medium-term (5- to 10-year horizon), ideas include widening commuter platforms, using unutilized mail platforms (including an extra-long through platform) for intercity passenger trains, adding more through tracks and platforms, reorganizing facilities for better capacity and flow, increasing height clearances of the tracks, and improving street access {{to and from the}} station. Long-term, proposals include increasing capacity and improving the ambiance of the station by significantly expanding or replacing station facilities in the 200 or 300 blocks of South Canal Street. Adding track and <b>platform</b> <b>capacity</b> along Clinton Street or Canal Street are also analyzed.|$|E

40|$|Part 2 : Large Scale and Complex Information Systems for DevelopmentInternational audienceWhile {{open source}} health {{information}} software platforms provide developing countries a low-cost, quick and less risky {{way to build}} health information systems as compared to in-house solutions, human resource capacity challenges can limit their ability to leverage such platforms. Drawing from a case study focusing on the deployment and operation phases of the DHIS 2 platform in Malawi, we observe open source software platforms require a range of human resource capacities that go beyond capacity to use the platform. To fully leverage open source health information software platforms entails the availability of <b>platform</b> usage <b>capacity,</b> <b>platform</b> deployment <b>capacity,</b> <b>platform</b> customisation <b>capacity</b> and <b>platform</b> module development <b>capacity.</b> Most capacity building initiatives for information systems in developing countries have been short-term efforts focused on initial end user capacity to use such systems.

40|$|Abstract. The {{scope of}} the {{presented}} research covers virtual agents providing intelligent assistance capabilities for accessing and processing information from the Internet, domain specific databases and knowledge repositories. They receive natural language inputs and communicate findings to their users via a set of task oriented interfaces. Cognitive agents are conceived to evolve in {{a response to the}} changes of interests, needs and preferences of the users and the alterations in their environment. We present a virtual embodied cognitive agents architecture, and a computational framework that allows their modular and flexible creation, based on a set of components. The framework supports the creation of an environment for multiple agents and provides communication mechanisms, used to share knowledge between the agents. The exemplary assembly of these building blocks to realize smart assistance applications further demonstrates the <b>platform’s</b> <b>capacity</b> to support development, instantiation and evaluation of collaborative cognitive agents. ...|$|R

40|$|A novel {{imaging and}} {{software}} platform {{was developed for}} the high-throughput phenotyping of three-dimensional root traits during seedling development. To demonstrate the <b>platform’s</b> <b>capacity,</b> plants of two rice (Oryza sativa) genotypes, Azucena and IR 64, were grown in a transparent gellan gum system and imaged daily for 10 d. Rotational image sequences consisting of 40 two-dimensional images were captured using an optically corrected digital imaging system. Three-dimensional root reconstructions were generated and analyzed using a custom-designed software, RootReader 3 D. Using the automated and interactive capabilities of RootReader 3 D, five rice root types were classified and 27 phenotypic root traits were measured to characterize these two genotypes. Where possible, measurements from the three-dimensional platform were validated and were highly correlated with conventional two-dimensional measurements. When comparing gellan gum-grown plants with those grown under hydroponic and sand culture, significant differences were detected in morphological root traits (P < 0. 05). This highly flexible <b>platform</b> provides the <b>capacity</b> to measure root traits {{with a high degree}} of spatial and temporal resolution and will facilitate novel investigations into the development of entire root systems or selected components of root systems.

50|$|In the 1980s, the Southern Railway {{required}} {{land for}} {{expansion of the}} terminus and {{was looking for the}} erstwhile Moore Market building located next to the terminus. In 1985, when the market building caught fire and was destroyed, the structure was transferred to the Railways by the government, and the Railways built a 13-storied complex to house the suburban terminus and railway reservation counter. The land {{in front of the building}} was made into a car park. Following the renaming of the city of Madras in 1996, the station became known as Chennai Central. Due to increasing passenger movement, the main building was extended in 1998 with the addition of a new building on the western side with a similar architecture to the original. After this duplication of the main building, the station had 12 <b>platforms.</b> <b>Capacity</b> at the station was further augmented when the multi-storeyed Moore Market Complex was made a dedicated terminus with three separate platforms for the Chennai Suburban Railway system.

40|$|Bus Rapid Transit (BRT), {{because of}} its {{operational}} flexibility and simplicity, is rapidly gaining popularity with urban designers and transit planners. Earlier BRTs were bus shared lane or bus only lane, which share the roadway with general {{and other forms of}} traffic. In recent time, more sophisticated designs of BRT have emerged, such as busway, which has separate carriageway for buses and provides very high physical separation of buses from general traffic. Line capacities of a busway are predominately dependent on bus capacity of its stations. Despite new developments in BRT designs, the methodology of capacity analysis is still based on traditional principles of kerbside bus stop on bus only lane operations. Consequently, the tradition methodology lacks accounting for various dimensions of busway station operation, such as passenger crowd, passenger walking and bus lost time along the long busway station platform. This research has developed a purpose made bus capacity analysis methodology for busway station analysis. Extensive observations of kerbside bus stops and busway stations in Brisbane, Australia were made and differences in their operation were studied. A large scale data collection was conducted using the video recording technique at the Mater Hill Busway Station on the South East Busway in Brisbane. This research identified new parameters concerning busway station operation, and through intricate analysis identified the elements and processes which influence the bus dwell time at a busway station platform. A new variable, Bus lost time, was defined and its quantitative descriptions were established. Based on these finding and analysis, a busway station <b>platform</b> bus <b>capacity</b> methodology was developed, comprising of new models for busway station lost time, busway station dwell time, busway station loading area bus capacity, and busway station <b>platform</b> bus <b>capacity.</b> The new methodology not only accounts for passenger boarding and alighting, but also covers platform crowd and bus lost time in station <b>platform</b> bus <b>capacity</b> estimation. The applicability of this methodology was shown through demonstrative examples. Additionally, these examples illustrated the significance of the bus lost time variable in determining station capacities...|$|R
