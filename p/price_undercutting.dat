50|$|The {{use of the}} {{assumption}} of perfect competition {{as the foundation of}} price theory for product markets is often criticized as representing all agents as passive, thus removing the active attempts to increase one's welfare or profits by <b>price</b> <b>undercutting,</b> product design, advertising, innovation, activities that - the critics argue - characterize most industries and markets. These criticisms point to the frequent lack of realism of {{the assumption}}s of product homogeneity and impossibility to differentiate it, but apart from this the accusation of passivity appears correct only for short-period or very-short-period analyses, in long-period analyses the inability of price to diverge from the natural or long-period price is due to active reactions of entry or exit.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{an explanation for}} noisy pricing based on the strategic interaction of two firms competing in prices. When a firm adds noise to its <b>prices,</b> <b>undercutting</b> it becomes harder. Therefore, noisy pricing allows a firm to either exclude a competitor while charging supracompetitive prices, or to soften competition and have both firms earn supracompetitive profits. Such behavior leads to prices lying between competitive and monopolistic levels, and harms consumers and social welfare. It occurs in equilibrium if firms set prices sequentially, and in some equilibria of a repeated game of simultaneous price-setting if one firm is patient. ...|$|R

We propose a theory in which advertising has a different effect on price competition according to the level of market maturity. In mature markets - where potential growth in low - only the price accommodation effect is present. In immature markets, both effects are present. Therefore, advertising is more procompetitive (less anti-competitive) in immature markets. Evidence from several Brazilian beer markets corroborates the theory. ...|$|E

Conversely, when input costs are expected to decline, firms adjust their prices only after a cost reduction materializes, and the firms' incentives for <b>price</b> <b>undercutting</b> lead to the standard Bertrand outcome...|$|E

We show that <b>price</b> <b>undercutting</b> or outbidding are the typical phenomena that, for the Classical authors, may be observed in a market characterized by free competition. We investigate some problematic aspects of the neoclassical notion of perfect competition and we reconstruct the Classical theory of free competition, as developed, in particular, by Adam Smith and Karl Marx, {{in the light of the}} modern notion of mixed strategies equilibria. ...|$|E
40|$|We {{explore the}} {{response}} of collusive prices to changing demand conditions when firms operate under capacity constraints {{in the presence of}} demand uncertainty. We find support for the conventional view that periods of low demand lead, through the emergence of excess capacity, to a breakdown of collusive pricing. We also find that the nature of price wars depends on the degree of excess capacity in the industry; while small amounts of excess capacity can lead firms to engage in "mild" price wars, characterized by uniform price reductions and market share stability, more "severe" price wars, characterized by <b>price</b> <b>undercutting</b> and market share instability, can emerge if excess capacity is sufficiently great. Finally, our results lend support to the view that market share instability is a symptom of ineffective collusion. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{conventional}} wisdom indicates that firms' optimal locations {{are sensitive to}} the modes of product-market competition, leading to a difficulty for firms to make concrete location decisions. This difficulty is especially crucial for the high entry-cost firms. The paper develops an uncovered-market model à la Economides (1984) to explore this sensitivity by taking into account a delegation game. It shows that firms' location configurations remain unchanged regardless of the modes of product-market competition as the owners offer the managers a contract with a relative-performance incentive scheme. Moreover, the paper shows that, by introducing a delegation game, the competition between managers under Bertrand competition is mitigated such that the managers have no incentive to choose <b>price</b> <b>undercutting</b> as they locate themselves far enough away from each other.
