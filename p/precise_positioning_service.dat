Several tracking scenarios are defined, various processing schemata are designed and carried out; and then, the estimates are compared and analyzed in detail.

Thus, near real time detection and forecasting of ionospheric storms might warn users to prevent misinterpretation of data in positioning and avoid hazardous misleading information (HMI) in SoL applications. In this talk we report the behaviour of ionospheric Total Electron Content (TEC) during the minor geomagnetic storm on 10 - 11 March 2011 observed via the Space Weather Application Center-Ionosphere (SWACI) of the German Aerospace Center and by using monitoring facilities of the Norwegian Mapping Authority. The relationships of ionospheric features with space weather factors such as solar irradiance, solar wind and geomagnetic activity are discussed. It has been found that storm pattern move from high to mid-latitudes during the storm. Preliminary attempts to forecast the TEC behaviour over Europe one hour ahead under perturbed conditions are discussed. The strength of ionospheric perturbation degree is estimated by using different methods. Thus, a preliminary version of a Disturbance Ionosphere indeX (DIX) generated by DLR and the I 95 index generated by NMA while operating the Norwegian national positioning network CPOS, are compared in relation to GNSS network disturbances seen in CPOS.

40|$|There is a {{widespread}} misconception within the spatial science community that the three geocentric datums widely used in Australia, GDA 94, ITRF and WGS 84 are identical “for all practical purposes”. This is a fair assumption for navigation and many mapping purposes, however users of wide area differential GPS and <b>precise</b> <b>positioning</b> <b>services</b> with a precision of less than a metre are beginning to notice discrepancies between the datums. This {{is due to the}} tectonic movement of the Australian plate. While all three are geocentric datums, WGS 84 and ITRF are dynamic in nature with site coordinates constantly changing to reflect tectonic movement on a global scale. Conversely, GDA 94 is a static datum with coordinates fixed at the beginning of 1994 to the ITRF realisation at that time. During the intervening 13 years, the Australian Plate has moved by up to a metre and as a consequence GDA 94 coordinates are now offset from WGS 84 and ITRF. This paper discusses the implications of use and misuse of positioning technology with regard to the integrity and longevity of survey coordination and spatial data. Practical methods of dealing with the divergence of GDA 94 and ITRF/WGS 84 are presented.

40|$|Continuously {{operating}} reference stations (CORS) {{are increasingly}} used to deliver real-time and nearreal-time <b>precise</b> <b>positioning</b> <b>services</b> on a regional basis. A CORS network-based {{data processing system}} depends on two types of measurements: (1) ambiguity-resolved double-differenced (DD) phase measurements, and (2) phase bias calibrated zero-differenced (ZD) phase measurements. This paper describes generalized, network-based geometry-free models for three carrier ambiguity resolution (TCAR) and phase bias estimation for DD and ZD code and phase measurements. Firstly, the geometry-free TCAR models are constructed with two Extra-Widelane (EWL) and/or Widelane (WL) virtual signals to allow for rapid ambiguity resolution (AR) for DD phase measurements without distance constraints. With an ambiguity-resolved WL phase measurement and the ionospheric estimate derived from the two EWL signals, an additional geometry-free equation is formed for the third virtual signal independent of the previous two. AR with the third geometry-free model requires a longer period for averaging than the first two, but is also distance-independent. A more general formulation of the geometry-free model for a baseline or network is also introduced, where all the DD ambiguities can be more rigorously resolved using the LAMBDA method. Secondly, the geometry-free models for calibration of three carrier phase biases of ZD phase measurements are similarly defined for selected virtual signals. A network adjustment procedure is then used to improve the ZD phase biases with known DD integer constraints. Numerical results from experiments with 24 -hour dual-frequency GPS data from three US CORS stations baseline lengths of 21 km, 56 km and 74 km confirm the theoretical predictions concerning AR reliability of the network-based geometry-free algorithms...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the preliminary results {{in establishing a}} strategy for predicting Zenith Tropospheric Delay (ZTD) and relative ZTD (rZTD) between Continuous Operating Reference Stations (CORS) in near real-time. It is anticipated that the predicted ZTD or rZTD can assist the network-based Real-Time Kinematic (RTK) performance over long inter-station distances, ultimately, enabling a cost effective method of delivering <b>precise</b> <b>positioning</b> <b>services</b> to sparsely populated regional areas, such as Queensland. This research firstly investigates two ZTD solutions: 1) the post-processed IGS ZTD solution and 2) the near Real-Time ZTD solution. The near Real-Time solution is obtained through the GNSS processing software package (Bernese) that has been deployed for this project. The predictability of the near Real-Time Bernese solution is analyzed and compared to the post-processed IGS solution where it acts as the benchmark solution. The predictability analyses were conducted with various prediction time of 15, 30, 45, and 60 minutes to determine the error with respect to timeliness. The predictability of ZTD and relative ZTD is determined (or characterized) by using the previously estimated ZTD as the predicted ZTD of current epoch. This {{research has shown that}} both the ZTD and relative ZTD predicted errors are random in nature; the STD grows from a few millimeters to sub-centimeters while the predicted delay interval ranges from 15 to 60 minutes. Additionally, the RZTD predictability shows very little dependency on the length of tested baselines of up to 1000 kilometers. Finally, the comparison of near Real-Time Bernese solution with IGS solution has shown a slight degradation in the prediction accuracy. The less accurate NRT solution has an STD error of 1 cm within the delay of 50 minutes. However, some larger errors of up to 10 cm are observed. ...|$|R

The superb positioning accuracy of GPS {{has tended to}} focus more attention on the system's capability to determine the spacecraft's location at a particular epoch than on accurate orbit determination, per se. The determination of orbit plane orientation and orbit shape to acceptable levels is less challenging than the determination of orbital period or semi-major axis.

While a Network-based RTK (N-RTK) system involves multiple continuously operating reference stations (CORS), the simplest form of a NRTK system is a single-base RTK. In Australia there are several NRTK services operating in different states and over 1000 single-base RTK systems to support <b>precise</b> <b>positioning</b> applications for surveying, mining, agriculture, and civil construction in regional areas. Additionally, future generation GNSS constellations, including modernised GPS, Galileo, GLONASS, and Compass, with multiple frequencies have been either developed or will become fully operational in the next decade. A trend of future development of RTK systems is to make use of various isolated operating network and single-base RTK systems and multiple GNSS constellations for extended service coverage and improved performance. Several computational challenges have been identified for future NRTK services including: •	Multiple GNSS constellations and multiple frequencies •	Large scale, wide area NRTK services with a network of networks •	Complex computation algorithms and processes •	Greater part of positioning processes shifting from user end to network centre with the ability to cope with hundreds of simultaneous users’ requests (reverse RTK) There are two major requirements for NRTK data processing based on the four challenges faced by future NRTK systems, expandable computing power and scalable data sharing/transferring capability. This research explores new approaches to address these future NRTK challenges and requirements using the Grid Computing facility, in particular for large data processing burdens and complex computation algorithms. A Grid Computing based NRTK framework is proposed in this research, which is a layered framework consisting of: 1) Client layer with the form of Grid portal; 2) Service layer; 3) Execution layer. The user’s request is passed through these layers, and scheduled to different Grid nodes in the network infrastructure. A proof-of-concept demonstration for the proposed framework is performed in a five-node Grid environment at QUT and also Grid Australia.

40|$|Described {{here are}} the concept, {{architecture}} and preliminary details of an experiment directed towards providing continuous Ultra High Precision (UHP) time transfer between Washington, DC; Salisbury, SA Australia; Orroral Valley, ACT Australia; and Lower Hutt, New Zealand. A proposed method of distributing UTC(USNO) {{at a high level}} of precision to passive users over a broad area of the South Pacific is described. The concept is based on active two-way satellite time transfer from the United States Naval Observatory (USNO) to the proposed USNO Master Clock West (MCW) in Wahiwa, HI at the 1 nanosecond level using active satellite two-way time transfer augmented by <b>Precise</b> <b>Positioning</b> <b>Service</b> (PPS) of the Global Positioning System (GPS). MCW would act as an intermediate transfer/reference station, again linked to Salisbury at the 1 nanosecond level using active satellite two-way time transfer augmented by PPS GPS. From this point, time would be distributed within the region by two methods. The first is an existing TV line sync system using an Australian communications satellite (AUSSAT K 1) which is useful to the 20 nanosecond level. The second approach is RF ranging and multilateration between Salisbury, Orroral Observatory, Lower Hutt and the AUSSAT B 1 and B 2 to be launched in 1992. Orroral Observatory will provide precise laser ranging to the AUSSAT B 1 /B 2 retro reflectors which will reduce ephemeris related time transfer errors to below 1 nanosecond. The corrected position will be transmitted by both the time transfer modem and the existing TV line sync dissemination process. Multilateration has the advantage of being an all weather approach and when used with the laser ranging technique will provide a precise measurement of the propagation path delays. This will result in time transfer performance levels on the order of 10 nanoseconds to passive users in both Australia and New Zealand...|$|E
40|$|The state survey {{offices in}} Germany have the task to provide {{homogeneous}} geodetic reference systems {{for all other}} public surveys. At the moment these reference systems are provided by a network of evenly spaced monumented control points to which further surveys are related. The High <b>Precise</b> Permanent <b>Positioning</b> <b>Service</b> (HPPS) offers a concept solving this task based on the Global Positioning System (GPS) completely new {{and at the same}} time a lot more economical. The idea is to replace the monumented control points by a network of GPS receivers permanently collecting data on reference stations. In combination with suitable communication methods a user with only one GPS receiver has the possibility to position himself very accurately (#+-# 1 cm) in a very short time (#<=# 30 min). This thesis deals with the different factors having influence on the functionality of a HPPS, appropriate results based on data from the state Lower Saxony are presented. One major topic is the practical use of the HPPS, covering the methodical aspects as well as the achievable accuracies. It can be stated, that the Global Positioning System has a high enough potential of accuracy for the planned system. However the combination with the conventional control network needs additional measures to fulfill the requirements. (orig.)

40|$|Nowadays, Global Positioning System (GPS) {{has been}} used {{effectively}} in several engineering applications for the survey purposes by multiple disciplines. Web-based online services developed by several organizations; which are user friendly, unlimited {{and most of them}} are free; have become a significant alternative against the high-cost scientific and commercial software on achievement of post processing and analyzing the GPS data. When centimeter (cm) or decimeter (dm) level accuracies are desired, that can be obtained easily regarding different quality engineering applications through these services. In this paper, a test study was conducted at ISKI-CORS network; Istanbul-Turkey in order to figure out the accuracy analysis of the most used web based online services around the world (namely OPUS, AUSPOS, SCOUT, CSRS-PPP, GAPS, APPS, magicGNSS). These services use relative and <b>precise</b> point <b>positioning</b> (PPP) solution approaches. In this test study, the coordinates of eight stations were estimated by using of both online services and Bernese 5. 0 scientific GPS processing software from 24 -hour GPS data set and then the coordinate differences between the online services and Bernese processing software were computed. From the evaluations, it was seen that the results for each individual differences were less than 10 mm regarding relative online service, and less than 20 mm regarding <b>precise</b> point <b>positioning</b> <b>service.</b> The accuracy analysis was gathered from these coordinate differences and standard deviations of the obtained coordinates from different techniques and then online services were compared to each other. The results show that the position accuracies obtained by associated online services provide high accurate solutions that may be used in many engineering applications and geodetic analysis...|$|R
40|$|In this study, {{a unified}} model for BeiDou Navigation Satellite System (BDS) wide area and local area {{augmentation}} positioning based on raw observations has been proposed. Applying this model, both the Real-Time Kinematic (RTK) and <b>Precise</b> Point <b>Positioning</b> (PPP) <b>service</b> {{can be realized}} by performing different corrections at the user end. This algorithm was assessed and validated with the BDS data collected at four regional stations from Day of Year (DOY) 080 to 083 of 2016. When the users are located within the local reference network, the fast and high precision RTK service can be achieved using the regional observation corrections, revealing a convergence time of about several seconds and a precision of about 2 – 3 cm. For the users out of the regional reference network, the global broadcast State-Space Represented (SSR) corrections can be utilized to realize the global PPP service which shows a convergence time of about 25 min for achieving an accuracy of 10 cm. With this unified model, it can not only integrate the Network RTK (NRTK) and PPP into a seamless <b>positioning</b> <b>service,</b> but also recover the ionosphere Vertical Total Electronic Content (VTEC) and Differential Code Bias (DCB) values that are useful for the ionosphere monitoring and modeling...|$|R
