30|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the effect of}} influencing factors {{on the distribution of}} incremental oil displaced by a polymer flood (extra-displaced oil) using numerical reservoir simulation. These factors include the location, area and permeability of a thin low-permeability interbed, and the perforation location relative to the interbed. Simulation results show the locations from where the incremental oil was displaced by the polymer solution. The interbed position from the oil formation top affects the location of extra-displaced oil. The interbed area has a slight influence on the whole shape of extra-displaced oil. Larger interbed area leads to higher partition extent of extra-displaced oil. Higher vertical permeability of interbeds contributes to worse partition extent of extra-displaced oil and the <b>partition</b> <b>effect</b> disappears if the ratio of vertical to horizontal permeability is more than 0.05. The perforation location relative to the interbed affects polymer displacement efficiency, and also has a significant effect on the distribution of extra-displaced oil in polymer flooding.|$|E

The native enzyme {{isolated from the}} wall exhibits classical Michaelis Menten kinetics. When buried into the cell wall, its natural environment, the enzyme mimics an apparent negative cooperativity. This deviation from hyperbolic dependence of the activity vs. the substrate concentration may result from an heterogeneous distribution of the enzyme molecules between the surface and {{the inside of the}} wall, where an electrostatic <b>partition</b> <b>effect</b> takes place. Cell wall fragments compacted on a Millipore-type membrane allow the study of the dual effects of diffusional hindrances and electrostatic interactions on the global kinetic behavior. By increasing the ionic strength, partition effects can be suppressed and therefore diffusional effects alone can be taken into account. On the one hand, diffusion and partition act individually and synergetically to decrease the apparent global affinity of phosphatase with respect to glucose 6 -phosphate. On the other hand, product inhibition by inorganic phosphate is subjected to dual effects from diffusion through accumulation and partition through repulsion. A simple diffusion—partition reaction model accounts qualitatively and quantitatively for the experimental observations...|$|E

We challenge and complement these performance models and tools, by modeling and analyzing a lesser known, but very severe performance pitfall, called Partition Camping, in NVIDIA GPUs. Partition Camping {{is caused by}} memory accesses that are skewed towards {{a subset of the}} available memory partitions, which may degrade the performance of GPU kernels by up to seven-fold. There is no existing tool that can detect the <b>partition</b> camping <b>effect</b> in GPU kernels. Unlike the traditional performance modeling approaches, we predict a performance range that bounds the <b>partition</b> camping <b>effect</b> in the GPU kernel. Our idea of predicting a performance range, instead of the exact performance, is more realistic due to the large performance variations induced by partition camping. We design and develop the prediction model by first characterizing the <b>effects</b> of <b>partition</b> camping with an indigenous suite of microbenchmarks. We then apply rigorous statistical regression techniques over the micro-benchmark data to predict the performance bounds of real GPU kernels, with and without the <b>partition</b> camping <b>effect.</b> We test the accuracy of our performance model by analyzing three real applications with known memory access patterns and <b>partition</b> camping <b>effects.</b> Our results show that the geometric mean of errors in our performance range prediction model is within 12 % of the actual execution times.

40|$|Nanocomposite WC/a-C {{coatings}} {{were successfully}} fabricated using a magnetron sputtering process, and post-deposition annealing {{was conducted in}} vacuum for 1 h at the annealing temperatures ranging from 100 to 500 degrees C. The changes in coating structure, internal stress, hardness, toughness, friction coefficient and wear have been investigated to assess the effects of annealing on microstructure, mechanical and tribological properties of the WC/a-C coatings. The {{results show that the}} nanocrystalline WC 1 -x partially decays to metastable W 2 C when annealing at 300 - 500 degrees C and no graphitization of amorphous carbon matrix starts up to 500 degrees C. This structural change results in a slightly increased hardness and an improved toughness as well as a gradually decreased internal stress. In addition, the time for the annealed coatings to achieve a low steady friction coefficient decreases with the increase of annealing temperature. An optimized tribological property with low friction coefficient of about 0. 06 and enhanced wear resistance of the WC/a-C coating is obtained by annealing at 400 degrees C. Friction reduction and wear resistance caused by annealing {{can be attributed to the}} friction-induced WO 3 -rich tribofilm which slides against a thin carbon-rich layer on the coating surface resulting in a low friction, and the <b>partition</b> <b>effect</b> of the stationary WO 3 -rich tribofilm combining with the improved mechanical properties generates a high wear resistance...|$|E

The microstructure, mechanical properties and tribological {{behaviors of the}} as-fabricated coatings were investigated and compared. The {{results showed that the}} "superlattice coating" feature of an alternating multilayer structure with a-C and WC 1 -x nanocrystallites layers on the nanoscale was formed. These multilayer superlattice structures led to diminished residual stress and improved the strength of the adhesion to the substrate. The WC/a-C coating with W 5. 43 at. % exhibited low friction coefficients of 0. 05 at 25 degrees C and 0. 28 at 200 degrees C. This significant improvement in the tribological performances of the WC/a-C coating was mainly attributed to the superior "superlattice" microstructure and the formation of a continuously compacted tribofilms, which was rich in graphitized carbon at 25 degrees C and dominated by the friction triggered WO 3 at 200 degrees C. Moreover, the WC/a-C coating with W 5. 43 at. % achieved optimal anti-wear properties at 25 degrees C due to the synergistic combination of the enhancement effects of the WC 1 -x, nanoparticles and the <b>partition</b> <b>effect</b> from the transfer film that restricted direct contact of the steel ball with the coating and thus prevented further intense wear. The accelerated wear of the WC/a-C coating with the increase of the WC phase content at 200 degrees C might be due to the combination of oxidation wear and abrasive wear that originated from the WC 1 -x phase.

40|$|Syndiotactic {{polystyrene}} (sPS) is a semicrystalline thermoplastic polymer {{with many}} advantageous properties such as excellent heat resistance {{with a high}} melting point of 270 - 272 oC, strong chemical resistance against acids, bases, oils and water, and low dielectric constant. The relatively fast crystallization rate makes sPS a promising material for {{a large number of}} applications in the automotive, electrical and packaging industries. In this study, the kinetics of syndiospecific polymerization of styrene is investigated through experimentation and theoretical modeling using homogeneous and heterogeneous Cp*Ti(OCH 3) 3 /MAO catalysts. During sPS slurry polymerization, the physical phase changes of reaction mixture occur. With an increase in total solid content, sPS slurry undergoes a series of physical changes from clear liquid to a wet cake or paste-like material. A detailed reaction kinetic model based on a two-site kinetic mechanism has been developed to predict the polymerization rate and polymer molecular weight distribution. The monomer <b>partition</b> <b>effect</b> is incorporated into kinetic models to account for the nonlinear dependence of polymerization rate on the bulk phase monomer concentration. Quite satisfactory agreement between the model simulation results and experimental data has been obtained. The morphological development of nascent sPS particles during the polymerization has also been investigated. Most notably, it was found that sPS particles grow with the nanofibrillar morphology with either homogeneous or silica-supported metallocene catalyst. The analysis of nascent morphology of sPS using X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and energy dispersive X-ray (EDS/EDX) analysis, revealed that there is a strong correlation between the formation of sPS nanofibrillar structure and sPS crystallization. A mechanism for the growth of sPS particles is also proposed based on the experimental observations and analysis. Ultrahigh molecular weight sPS has also been synthesized in silica nanotube reactors (SNTRs) and the morphological characteristics of sPS produced in the nanotube reactors have been analyzed. A new mechanism is proposed for the formation and growth of sPS nanofibrils extruding out from the nanotube reactors. Also, a kinetic analysis is presented to interpret the observed molecular weight enhancement effect that is believed to be caused by the constrained reaction environment inside the nanotubes...|$|E

The first essay examined consumers' responses to financially equivalent prix fixe menu prices with a built-in gratuity, a separately listed percentage gratuity or a separately listed dollar gratuity at surcharge levels different from the 15 % tipping benchmark. I demonstrated that surcharge level moderated the relationship between menu price presentation and consumers' deal perception and this moderating effect {{can be explained by the}} evaluability of the individual price components within a partitioned price. The second essay further explored surcharge framing by studying the differential effects of voluntary versus mandatory service gratuity on consumers' menu price perception and demand. Findings from three experiments indicated that a Sunday brunch price with 15 % customary tipping led to a lower perceived expensiveness and higher patronage intent than the same price with a 15 % mandatory service gratuity. More importantly, through process measure analyses and mediation tests, the studies provided converging evidence that participants' use of surcharge and perceived surcharge fairness acted in parallel and with similar strengths as mediators of the relationship between surcharge policy and menu price perception. I also found that participant's patronage intent was mediated by both surcharge fairness perception and price expensiveness perception, although the impact of the former mediator was significantly stronger. As an extension of my empirical work using a multi-process approach to studying price <b>partitioning</b> <b>effects,</b> the third dissertation essay described an integrative framework on the psychological mechanisms for processing partitioned prices.
