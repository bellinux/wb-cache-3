The walls of these fibers are semi-permeable and designed for different gases to move through them (or <b>permeate)</b> at different speeds. The resulting gas mixture is known as the <b>permeate.</b> As air flows through the hollow fibers, both oxygen and nitrogen <b>permeate</b> through the fiber walls. The oxygen <b>permeates</b> faster than the nitrogen, which produces <b>permeate</b> with an oxygen content greater than air. The gas that reaches the end of the hollow fibers without <b>permeating</b> is almost entirely nitrogen and is discharged.

40|$|The {{effects of}} three whey <b>permeates</b> were {{investigated}} as potential natural washing treatment for fresh-cut tomato and compared with chlorine (120 ppm). Whey <b>permeate</b> treated samples resulted in equivalent {{or better than}} chlorine for all these attributes. Whey <b>permeates</b> were equally effective as chlorine to control the micro-organisms of fresh-cut tomato during storage. The microbial counts at day 10 were significantly reduced (~ 1. 0 log CFU/g) in all the treated samples compared to the control (water treated) samples. Moreover whey <b>permeate</b> treated fresh-cut tomatoes showed lower water activity (2 %) and POD activities (21 %) than chlorinated samples after 10 days of storage. Whey <b>permeate</b> also inhibited the loss of firmness of treated tomato slices.

40|$|This paper investigates pervaporation, a {{membrane}} separation {{process for the}} removal of sulfur-containing components from jet fuel. To this end, one type of commercial membrane from PolyAn GmbH was applied. The influence of the crucial reaction parameters of the pervaporation process, such as feed temperature, <b>permeate</b> pressure, and <b>permeate</b> temperature, on the characteristic pervaporation measures such as <b>permeate</b> flux and enrichment factor was tested experimentally. Fuels with different sulfur mass fractions were applied and the long-term stability of the membranes used was studied. Different spectroscopic methods were applied to investigate correlations between membrane performance and material properties of the membrane. It was found that an increased feed temperature had a positive effect on the <b>permeate</b> flux while it had a negative effect on the enrichment factor. At 100 degrees C, the <b>permeate</b> flux amounted to 5. 44 kg/(h m(2)), while it was only 1. 16 kg/(h m(2)) at a feed temperature of 80 degrees C. At a feed temperature of 80 degrees C, the enrichment factor was 0. 47, while it amounted to 0. 64 at a feed temperature of 100 degrees C. In the case of the <b>permeate</b> pressure, the trends were also antagonistic. Low <b>permeate</b> pressure enhanced the <b>permeate</b> flux but deteriorated the enrichment factor. At a value of 20 mbar, the <b>permeate</b> flux amounted to 5. 44 kg/(h m(2)), while it was only 0. 16 kg/(h m(2)) at 100 mbar. The enrichment factor was 0. 64 at 20 mbar and decreased to 0. 35 at 100 mbar. Different <b>permeate</b> temperatures and sulfur mass proportions had only a minor effect on the <b>permeate</b> flux and the enrichment factor. Experiments on the long-term stability of the membranes used showed that fortunately the pervaporation process could be run for more than 500 h using membranes from PolyAn GmbH while still showing a measurable <b>permeate</b> flux and a remarkable reduction of the sulfur mass fraction in the <b>permeate.</b> However, a significant deactivation with time on stream was observed. The <b>permeate</b> flux continuously decreased from 3. 5 kg/(h m(2)) to 0. 5 kg/(h m(2)) after 532 h of time on stream. The enrichment factor increased from 0. 5 to 0. 6. Long-term experiments with pretreated membranes revealed that interaction between the hydrocarbon matrix in kerosene Jet A- 1 and the membrane material itself was not responsible for the observed degradation of performance. Spectroscopic investigations were used to show that the reduction of the <b>permeate</b> flux was probably caused by an irreversible inclusion of polar - mostly aromatic - molecules in the polymeric separation layer of the membrane. The probable influence of unknown additives on the <b>permeate</b> flux could not be proven but should be considered. No degradation of the membrane material itself was found. (C) 2011 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|Fouling {{behaviour}} and {{its impact}} on the rejection of trace organic contaminants (TrOCs) by forward osmosis (FO) were investigated. Membrane fouling was simulated using humic acid and colloidal particles asmodel foulants at different initial permeatewater fluxes. Water flux declinewas insignificant at an initial <b>permeate</b> flux of 9 L/m 2 h and the fouling layerwas loose and fluid-like. By contrast, thewater flux declinewas substantial at an initial <b>permeate</b> flux of 20 L/m 2 h, resulting in the formation of a compact fouling layer. Water flux recovery after physical cleaning for both humic acid and colloidal particle fouledmembraneswas consistently higher at an initial <b>permeate</b> flux of 9 L/m 2 h compared to 20 L/m 2 h. The results suggest that the fouling layer structure varied froma fluidlike loose layer at lowinitial <b>permeate</b> flux to amore cohesive and compact layer at high initial <b>permeate</b> flux. We surmise that the fluid-like loose layer formed at low initial <b>permeate</b> flux contributed to pore blockage and thus enhanced steric hindrance, thereby leading to an increase in TrOC rejection. By contrast, the cohesive and compact fouling layer formed at high initial <b>permeate</b> flux exacerbated cake-enhanced concentration polarisation, resulting in a decrease in TrOC rejection...|$|R

40|$|The {{reduction}} of effluent streams {{and the demand}} for freshwater intake in the dairy industry, may be accomplished by the segregation and reuse of streams that can be readily treated. This study assessed the biodegradability and suitability for reuse of reverse osmosis (R/O) <b>permeate</b> from Kiwi Dairies Ltd processing factory (Hawera), using aerobic treatment. Analysis of the <b>permeate</b> showed that there was a direct relationship between chemical oxygen and lactose concentration. The chemical oxygen demand of R/O <b>permeate</b> from two reverse osmosis membrane plants operating in parallel varied widely during the period of study. This wide variation in <b>permeate</b> chemical oxygen was directly related to the membrane efficiency. Elemental analysis of the R/O <b>permeate</b> showed that iron and phosphorous would need to be supplemented to ensure balanced microbial growth. The biodegradability was characterised by a series of batch tests to determine the biokinetic constants µm, Ks, qsm and Yt. These tests showed that the biodegradability of reverse osmosis <b>permeate</b> is comparable to general dairy wastes. Batch tests were also performed on <b>permeate</b> from R/O membranes of varying performance efficiency, with different lactose and mineral concentrations. There were no conclusive variations in biokinetic constants between <b>permeates</b> from R/O membranes of varying performance efficiency. Operation of a model activated sludge pilot plant showed that soluble COD removal efficiencies of over 90 % could be achieved at hydraulic retention times of 10 and 20 hours. The sludge settling characteristics were more favourable at a 10 hour hydraulic retention time. Sudden fluctuations in membrane efficiency caused shock loads resulting in a deterioration in treatment efficiency and sludge settling characteristics.

The highest <b>permeate</b> flux, 58. 75 l/m 2. min, and water recovery, 42. 47 %, were obtained in the highest pressure and the lowest feed concentration. On the other hand, the lowest <b>permeate</b> concentration, 0. 01 mg/l, and the highest salt rejection, 99. 8 %, were obtained in the highest pressure and the lowest feed concentration...|$|R
40|$|In this study, {{the effects}} of {{experimental}} conditions including the MBR equipped novel device and different operating modes on <b>permeate</b> flux were studied. The {{results show that the}} MBR equipped novel device can reduce the resistance and enhance the flux, decreasing the total resistance (Rt = 9. 649) to 5. 962 and increasing the <b>permeate</b> flux to 15 - 20 L/m 2 hr. The <b>permeate</b> flux of intermittent operating mode is more than that of continuous operation and the value of the <b>permeate</b> flux is between 15 l/m 2 hr and 20 l/m 2 hr. The MBR equipped novel device which adopting intermittent operating mode is most effective in this study and the value of <b>permeate</b> flux is between 20 l/m 2 hr and 25 l/m 2 hr...|$|R
