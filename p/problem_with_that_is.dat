Instead of the traditional phone call or face-to-face interaction between individuals, people are now starting to end relationships by simply changing their relationship status, knowing full well that their significant other will see it shortly. The <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> that you are left with no closure and the entire online world now knows you are no longer in a relationship. In a 2010 study conducted online, nearly one-quarter of the 1,000 individuals surveyed found out that their own relationship was over by seeing it on Facebook. New media websites have made our private lives much more public, {{especially when it comes to}} breaking up, since updates are able to be immediately viewed by everyone in our networks (which tend to be more people than we would normally tell personally); for example, having friends comment on your newly changed [...] "single" [...] relationship status, and having to explain what happened can be distressing.|$|E

50|$|Marshall {{also looks}} at the {{difference}} between the archaeological remains left behind by pastoralists and hunger-gatherer groups. Identifying pastoralist sites is not always easy: pastoralists tend to not leave well-defined sites behind after they move on, and what they do leave behind does not always preserve well. In East Africa, the thing that tends to differentiate the two is the type of lithics that they create. Ceramics in this area are associated with both hunter-gatherers and pastoralists, although interaction between pastoralists and hunter-gatherer groups blurs these lines a little and makes it much harder for archaeologists to distinguish the two from each other. One of the things that Marshall says that can be a key to distinguishing the pastoralist sites and the hunter-gatherer sites is the amount of dung that accumulates in corrals. The only <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> that dung is organic material which means that it will decompose over time. Marshall suggests that when archaeologists select a site that might have been a pastoralist site, that they choose a site that is away from the water sources because some things, like phosphate minerals, will be better preserved.|$|E

'In the beginning, {{he was the}} {{conscience}} of the groupthe thinker, the one who, before taking any action, thought of the different consequences of what they decided to do. Given their situation, every move they make is imperative to their survival and secret. So he was like the rockthe conscience, the one who tried to get everyone to do the right thing. I think he learned over the course of this year that he can't always take positions and always tell people what the right or wrong thing to do is. He has learned not to be as controlling as he was before, and allow people to make mistakes on their own and learn from them.

It's very hard for Max to get through to him and make Michael understand what he's doing could be dangerous for everyone involved. Yet everyone on the show has choices they have to make, but at what cost? So it's a real delicate thing where Max is still learning." [...] Jason Behr, The Behr Necessities ...|$|E
5000|$|Many {{different}} methods to control nematodes {{have been tried}} over the years. Some have proven more successful and others have not. Some of these methods include nematicides, cover crops, crop rotation, genetically modified plants and seed treatments. In soybeans, Essex is a tolerant cultivar whereas Forrest is sensitive. Essex has a higher yield in fields that are infested with the nematode. The plots in this study by Koenning were treated with aldicarb, carbofuran, and fenamiphos and had less nematodes 40 days post planting then the areas that were not treated. The plots that were planted with Forrest which is the sensitive cultivar and treated with carbofuran had a higher yield than untreated control plots. Damage threshold levels have not been well established but using fumigated plots has shown significant increases in yield. [...] In Brazil, many crops are planted under the no tillage planting system. This typically causes of buildup of polyphagous species of nematodes like P. brachyurus. [...] If a no till system is being used, planting cover crops that would decrease {{the density of the}} nematodes may be needed. The <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> there is contradictory information regarding P. brachyurus and which plants are poor or good hosts. Due to this very same reason, farmers would {{have to be very careful}} in choosing a crop rotation schedule as well. [...] In 1992 Vast demonstrated that arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi could enhanced the plant’s resistance to nematodes by being a physical barrier. [...] This would be something that could be used as a seed treatment to protect the newly emerging seedlings from being infested.|$|E

50|$|Tanzania, an African country, has {{a history}} of European colonization. There has been a long-standing debate in {{regarding}} the implicit dynamics of power when a colonized or oppressed culture adopting certain cultural forms (music styles, fashion, etc.) of the colonizers or the oppressors. Is hip-hop in Tanzania mimicry and imitation of American hip-hop, which would imply an American cultural hegemony? Or are artists borrowing some elements of American hip-hop that resonate with them, among a variety of other (for example Tanzanian, Congolese, Japanese, or Cuban) cultural influences and then creating something entirely new, entirely their own? Are these always mutually exclusive? Alex Perullo, writer and professor at Bryant College in Rhode Island, says this: say all this music that is coming from the West such as hip-hop is destroying local cultures and local ideas, and local musical trends. And to some extent, there {{is a little bit of}} truth in that, although I would hesitate to say that cultural imperialism is actually happening...There are a lot of artists in Tanzania who do dress exactly like the people that they see from the United States.

40|$|This paper gives {{a survey}} of {{insights}} into inter-firm alliances and networks for innovation, from a constructivist, interactionist perspective on knowledge, {{which leads to the}} notion of 'cognitive distance'. It looks at both the competence and the governance side of relationships. Given cognitive distance, organizations need to align cognition sufficiently to enable the fast and efficient utilization of opportunities from complementary capabilities. This, I propose, is done by means of a culturally mediated 'organizational cognitive focus'. The <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> that it yields a greater or lesser organizational myopia that, for the sake of innovation, needs to be complemented by means of outside relations with other firms, at larger cognitive distance. Hence the importance of networks for innovation. On the governance side, the paper gives a review of relational risks and instruments to manage them. Next to the effects of cognitive distance, the paper analyses the effects of density and strength of ties in innovation networks, concerning both competence and governance. ...|$|E

Cataloged from PDF version of thesis report. Includes bibliographical references (page 23). It is often considered a better exercise to have a complete idea of a particular service or a product before availing it. Now a days almost every online shopping sites or even the manufacturer of the product has a star based rating system and review/comment zone in their website. It is often not feasible {{to go through all}} the review before purchasing or availing that particular product. So people often tends to have an idea {{based on the number of}} stars on that product. Currently available systems use a star based rating where people rate the service or product on the scale of 5 or 10. The <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> when they give those rating stars they often tends to give it without giving much thought to it. User experience level and his mind set while rating varies very much. For example a person who loves particular brand of Soda, if he drink soda of another brand he might rate it lower than what it should be because he is used to a particular brand. But when he writes a review the chances are higher that he will write the major positive and negative aspects of that product. Thus the chances of getting a better feedback comes when it is review rather than stars. But as it has been mentioned earlier, going through all the reviews are not feasible. So we tried to improve the rating system by extracting information from the review text by using text mining technique upon that. Raduanul IslamSk. Wasif AhmedMd. Ahsanul KarimB.
