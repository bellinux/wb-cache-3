The gel was synthesized using the Fe(II) salt, non-ionic surfactant, and propylene oxide. Oxalate powder was sandwiched between two mesoporous Y 2 O 3 barrier layers on a metal foil, whereas the Fe-oxyhydroxide gel was coated directly on a foil to prepare the reactive substrates.

30|$|When {{comparing}} the reactants {{used for the}} synthesis of ibuprofen in this study to the Boots and BHC methods, several intriguing observations can be made concerning the safety hazards for all reactants involved. The BHC method uses several chemicals that are not environmentally friendly including hydrofluoric acid and Raney Nickel. Hydrofluoric acid is a highly corrosive liquid and a contact poison whose vapors can penetrate tissue [16]. Raney Nickel, though not as severe of a health hazard, is a <b>pyrophoric</b> <b>material</b> that must be handled under inert atmosphere [17]. One of the positive features of the BHC method {{is that there is}} practically no waste generation for this process and therefore, it has a very good atom economy. The Boots method of synthesizing ibuprofen also consists of several environmentally hazardous reagents. This synthetic pathway utilizes hydroxylamine, which must be handled with care since it can explode upon heating [18]. Furthermore, this reagent is an irritant that can absorb through the skin causing cellular mutations.Through the use of the synthetic pathway to ibuprofen proposed in this manuscript, we have reduced the use of toxic chemicals (along with the elimination of fossil fuel derived electricity use). Reagents that are commonly listed as irritants are still used in this pathway (aluminum chloride, acetyl chloride) [19, 20, 21]. The reagent that poses the most environmental/health concerns throughout this process is hydrazine. Hydrazine is a highly toxic, corrosive liquid that has several adverse health effects [22]. However, in our process, we were able to successfully exchange hydrazine for hydrazine hydrate. The hydrate form is still considered to be hazardous upon human contact, but health hazards are greatly reduced when compared to hydrazine [23].|$|E

These classes of materials continue to find applications in electronic countermeasures for all forces. In this paper some results are presented from a performed literature survey 1 for instant decoys for armored ground vehicles it describes the basic “state of the art” for this specific application. In this literature survey three principally different methods were found which should instantly offer a decoy for armored vehicles. The first method describes a projectile that is propelled from the armored vehicle, and while in flight, it expands from its collapsed state thereby ‘instantly’ emitting an infrared signature, using a combination of pyrophoric coating and pyrotechnic devices. The <b>pyrophoric</b> <b>material</b> causes immediate combustion reaction upon exposure to the atmosphere. Additionally radar reflection is offered by dipole prints on the fabric of the deployed material. The second method uses an inflatable balloon structure, which is covered with a layer (or which carries a layer within) designed to exothermally react and cause the desired infrared emission. The third method uses an inflatable structure, offering an infrared signature {{as a result of the}} released gasses used to expand the structure; this structure is to remain on top of the armored vehicle. Other methods will be briefly discussed as well, but these are not typically designed for “instant” use, or the methods are, for different reasons, not commonly known as a decoy.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this report {{is to provide a}} topical {{reference}} on the phenomena and prediction of uranium pyrophoricity for the Hanford Spent Nuclear Fuel (SNF) Project with specific applications to SNF Project processes and situations. Spent metallic uranium nuclear fuel is currently stored underwater at the K basins in the Hanford 100 area, and planned processing steps include: (1) At the basins, cleaning and placing fuel elements and scrap into stainless steel multi-canister overpacks (MCOs) holding about 6 MT of fuel apiece; (2) At nearby cold vacuum drying (CVD) stations, draining, vacuum drying, and mechanically sealing the MCOs; (3) Shipping the MCOs to the Canister Storage Building (CSB) on the 200 Area plateau; and (4) Welding shut and placing the MCOs for interim (40 year) dry storage in closed CSB storage tubes cooled by natural air circulation through the surrounding vault. Damaged fuel elements have exposed and corroded fuel surfaces, which can exothermically react with water vapor and oxygen during normal process steps and in off-normal situations, A key process safety concern is the rate of reaction of damaged fuel and the potential for self-sustaining or runaway reactions, also known as uranium fires or fuel ignition. Uranium metal and one of its corrosion products, uranium hydride, are potentially <b>pyrophoric</b> <b>materials.</b> Dangers of pyrophoricity of uranium and its hydride have long been known in the U. S. Department of Energy (Atomic Energy Commission/DOE) complex and will be discussed more below; it is sufficient here to note that there are numerous documented instances of uranium fires during normal operations. The motivation for this work is to place the safety of the present process in proper perspective given past operational experience. Steps in development of such a perspective are: (1) Description of underlying physical causes for runaway reactions, (2) Modeling physical processes to explain runaway reactions, (3) Validation of the method against experimental data, (4) Application of the method to plausibly explain operational experience, and (5) Application of the method to present process steps to demonstrate process safety and margin. Essentially, the logic above is used to demonstrate that runaway reactions cannot occur during normal SNF Project process steps, and to illustrate the depth of the technical basis for such a conclusion. Some off-normal conditions are identified here that could potentially lead to runaway reactions. However, this document is not intended to provide an exhaustive analysis of such cases.

40|$|Pyrophoric {{reagents}} {{represent an}} important class of reactants {{because they can}} participate in {{many different types of}} reactions. They are very useful in organic synthesis and in industrial applications. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) define Pyrophorics as substances that will self-ignite in air at temperatures of 130 F (54. 4 C) or less. However, the U. S. Department of Transportation (DOT) uses criteria different from the auto-ignition temperature criterion. The DOT defines a <b>pyrophoric</b> <b>material</b> as a liquid or solid that, even in small quantities and without an external ignition source, can ignite within five minutes after coming in contact with air when tested according to the United Nations Manual of Tests and Criteria. The Environmental Protection Agency has adopted the DOT definition. Regardless of which definition is used, oxidation of the pyrophoric reagents by oxygen or exothermic reactions with moisture in the air (resulting in the generation of a flammable gas such as hydrogen) is so rapid that ignition occurs spontaneously. Due to the inherent nature of pyrophoric substances to ignite spontaneously upon exposure to air, special precautions must be taken to ensure their safe handling and use. Pyrophoric gases (such as diborane, dichloroborane, phosphine, etc.) are typically the easiest class of pyrophoric substances to handle since the gas can be plumbed directly to the application and used remotely. Pyrophoric solids and liquids, however, require the user to physically manipulate them when transferring them from one container to another. Failure to follow proper safety precautions could result in serious injury or unintended consequences to laboratory personnel. Because of this danger, pyrophorics should be handled only by experienced personnel. Users with limited experience must be trained on how to handle pyrophoric reagents and consult with a knowledgeable staff member prior to performing the experimental task. The {{purpose of this article is}} three fold: (1) to provide guidelines and general safety precautions to avoid accidents, (2) describe proper techniques on how to successfully handle, store, and dispose of pyrophoric liquids and solids, and (3) illustrate best practices for working with this class of reactants in a laboratory environment...|$|E
40|$|School of Molecular Sciences(Chemical Engineering) Colloidal {{quantum dots}} (CQDs) are {{semiconductor}} nanoparticles which have unique {{size and shape}} dependent optical properties. Because of these unique properties, CQDs have received considerable attention for fundamental interest and application to optoelectronic devices. These unique properties come from ‘quantum confinement effect’ and they give possibility {{to be used for}} light emitting diode (LED), solar cell, photo-detector, and bio-imaging agents. Early research projects focused only on group II-VI CQDs which contain lead and cadmium. Although group II-VI CQDs give high quality of optical properties and stability, because of the Restriction of Hazardous Substances (RoHS) from European Union, it is hard to commercialize group II-VI CQDs. To avoid RoHS, CQDs research actively has been performed to develop non-toxic CQDs which do not contain lead and cadmium such as InP, InAs, ZnSe and CuInS 2. However most of the non-toxic CQDs research is focused on InP and CuInS 2. Recently, research is underway to try to find new type of non-toxic CQDs such as GaP. In this dissertation, there are two subjects about colloidal quantum dots and its application. First subject is ‘Synthesis of InP colloidal quantum dots with white phosphorus for new phosphine precursor’. Most of the InP colloidal quantum dots are synthesized with tris(trimethylsilyl) phosphine [(TMS) 3 P] which gives monodisperse and highly crystalline InP CQDs. Although (TMS) 3 P gives high quality of InP CQDs, it is expensive and a <b>pyrophoric</b> <b>material</b> which produces PH 3 and a highly toxic gas. In order to replace (TMS) 3 P, cheaper and safer phosphine precursors are studied such as aminophosphine, white phosphorus and so on. In this subject, InP CQDs are synthesized with white phosphorus via both hot-injection and heat-up method, which has great advantages to mass-scale production. Second subject is ‘Synthesis of In 1 -xGaxP alloy colloidal quantum dots and its optical properties. ’ Although In 1 -xGaxP CQDs are already reported, the effect of indium/gallium ratio to optical properties is not examined well. In this subject, In 1 -xGaxP/ZnS (0 ≤ x ≤ 1) core shell CQDs were synthesized with different In/Ga ratio. The resulting In 1 -xGaxP/ZnS alloy CQDs were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), UV-Vis absorbance spectroscopy, photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy, temperature dependent photoluminescence (TDPL) and so on. ope...|$|E
40|$|This study {{presents}} and investigates a novel hybrid fuel grain that reacts pyrophorically with gaseous oxidizer to achieve restart of a hybrid rocket motor propulsion system while reducing cost and handling concerns. This reactive fuel grain (RFG) {{relies on the}} pyrophoric nature of finely divided metal particles dispersed in a solid dicyclopentadiene (DCPD) binder, which {{has been shown to}} encapsulate air-sensitive additives until they are exposed to combustion gases. An RFG is thus effectively inert in open air {{in the absence of an}} ignition source, though the particles encapsulated within remain pyrophoric. In practice, this means that an RFG that is ignited in the vacuum of space and then extinguished will expose unoxidized pyrophoric particles, which can be used to generate sufficient heat to relight the propellant when oxidizer is flowed. ^ The experiments outlined in this work aim to develop a suitable <b>pyrophoric</b> <b>material</b> for use in an RFG, demonstrate pyrophoric relight, and characterize performance under conditions relevant to a hybrid rocket thruster. Magnesium, lithium, calcium, and an alloy of titanium, chromium, and manganese (TiCrMn) were investigated to determine suitability of pure metals as RFG additives. Additionally, aluminum hydride (AlH 3), lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH 4), lithium borohydride (LiBH 4), and magnesium hydride (MgH 2) were investigated to determine suitability of metals hydrides as RFG additives or as precursors for pure-metal RFG additives. Pyrophoric metals have been previously investigated as additives for increasing the regression rate of hybrid fuels, but to the author’s knowledge, these materials have not been specifically investigated for their ability to ignite a propellant pyrophorically. ^ Commercial research-grade metals were obtained as coarse powders, then ball-milled to attempt to reduce particle size below a critical diameter needed for pyrophoricity. Magnesium hydride was ball-milled and then cycled in a hydride cycling apparatus to attempt to fracture the particles through hydrogen sorption and thermal stresses. These powders were then tested for pyrophoricity with atmospheric and pure concentrations of oxygen. The TiCrMn powder was chosen as the material for evaluation of propellant performance, and was mixed with DCPD in various weight ratios to determine the required additive loading needed for pyrophoricity of the bulk propellant. Weight percentages of 10, 20, 30, and 50 wt. % TiCrMn were used to evaluate relight capability and propellant performance, and weight loadings of 50, 70, and 90 wt. % TiCrMn were used to evaluate approximate maximum loading possible without rendering the propellant structurally unsound. Propellant tests were conducted in an opposed flow burner apparatus for sub-scale regression rate and relight experiments, and an optically accessible cylindrical combustion chamber (OCC) that allows high speed cameras to record the regressing propellant surface during combustion. Gaseous oxygen (GOX) was used as an oxidizer for all tests due to its ready availability and common use as a hybrid rocket oxidizer. Opposed flow burner experiments are an inexpensive means of rapidly testing various propellant formulations at different conditions, whereas OCC tests are useful for obtaining realistic data on how an RFG would likely operate as part of a propulsion system. ^ Relight in the opposed flow burner was attempted by cycling oxygen and nitrogen flows with carefully timed solenoid valves to initiate and extinguish combustion, and to control the slow diffusion of oxygen to the surface of the propellant, which would render the TiCrMn non-pyrophoric. The opposed flow burner experiments did not conclusively demonstrate the pyrophoric relight capability of the RFG propellant due in part to the persistence of hot spots between oxygen and purge nitrogen cycles, as determined by high-speed imaging in the near infrared range. An opposed flow burner apparatus was then constructed within a vacuum chamber assembly thus preventing atmospheric oxygen from diffusing to the propellant surface, but these tests did not demonstrate pyrophoric relight. Future work is proposed to evaluate the effect of pyrophoric particle size in order to determine the role ignition delay of each particle has in the relight capability of RFGs. ^ OCC experiments were conducted at a low and high GOX mass flux of approximately 150 and 300 kg/s/m 2, respectively, at a nominal chamber pressure of 150 psia. Four strand compositions were used: pure DCPD, 30 wt. % pyrophoric TiCrMn powder with average particle diameters of approximately 1 - 10 microns, 30 wt. % oxidized TiCrMn powder with average particle diameters of approximately 1 - 10 microns, and 30 wt. % TiCrMn powder with average particle diameters of approximately 1 - 4 mm. Regression rate was measure by weight loss, average web thickness change at three axial locations on the strand, and through time-resolved tracking of the regressing propellant surface via high speed video. While visual observations suggest that the addition of TiCrMn significantly increases regression rate, initial data do not show a significant trend. Additionally, it is observed that the oxidized TiCrMn strands regress at the same rate as those loaded with pyrophoric TiCrMn, suggesting that erosive burning and heat addition of the added metal may be the cause of the observed increase in regression rate. The data are too sparse to make conclusions about the effect of particle size on regression rate, so further tests are recommended to develop a significant data set for the effect of pyrophoricity and particle size on regression rate. The test article was damaged at the end of the regression rate experimental campaign, which precluded the collection of relight data that was planned for strands loaded with 50 wt. % TiCrMn particles with an average diameter of approximately 1 - 4 mm. Though further tests are needed to demonstrate pyrophoric relight of an RFG, the current work establishes a baseline for RFG performance and suggests that pyrophoric relight is possible by tailoring the particle size of the pyrophoric metal additive to control heat release and ignition delay. ...|$|E
