He graduated to the B1 school in Ulm-Dornstadt on 4 October 1937.

He subsequently completed his B2 training in Karlsruhe on 31 May 1938.|$|E
5|$|O'Reilly did {{not enjoy}} his time at the overcrowded Sydney Teachers College (STC), decrying the lack of <b>practical</b> <b>training</b> and the {{predominance}} of pedagogical theory. Regarding it as a waste of time, he happily accepted an offer of work experience from Major Cook-Russell, the head of physical education at STC, to help at Naremburn College instead of attending lectures. This angered Professor Alexander Mackie, the head of STC, whom both Cook-Russell and O'Reilly regarded as incompetent.|$|E

The first part describes the importance of mentoring and mentor´s role in the process of <b>practical</b> pedagogical <b>training.</b> The role of the school counsellor in an educational institution is also described. Research results are presented {{in the second part of}} the article. Here, the school mentors (school counsellors) were interviewed about school counsellor competencies, about the development of different counsellor competencies during the <b>practical</b> pedagogical <b>training</b> of students of Pedagogy and with the help of their mentor and about the overall opinion about the entire course of <b>practical</b> pedagogical <b>training...</b>|$|R
40|$|<b>Practical</b> legal <b>training</b> has {{traditionally}} been the poor relation of the legal education family. Along with the similarly placed clinical legal education, it is a latecomer to formal legal education and its academic value is regarded with some reservation by those involved in more mainstream areas of academia. These reservations are not entirely unfounded. While few could deny the value of <b>practical</b> legal <b>training</b> in terms of teaching and contribution to the legal community, {{it is in the}} contribution to research and scholarship that <b>practical</b> legal <b>training</b> may be seen to be less successful. Few academics who teach in <b>practical</b> legal <b>training</b> go on to conduct research into it, external funding opportunities in this area are quite limited and such research as is conducted is not perceived to have a high academic value. This paper draws on a research project conducted by the writers to explore the climate influencing research in <b>practical</b> legal <b>training</b> and the standards by which its research successes are measured. The paper relies on interview data obtained from PLT academics to ascertain obstacles to research in PLT and to postulate how positive outcomes for valuing <b>practical</b> legal <b>training</b> research might be achieved...|$|R
5|$|The Students' Observatory was {{constructed}} in 1886 on the Berkeley campus, with the original funds provided by the California legislature {{in order for the}} observatory to provide <b>practical</b> <b>training</b> to civil engineers. Very quickly, the Students' Observatory became seen as a training ground for students studying astronomy, so that they would be better prepared to go on to use the facilities at Lick Observatory. This contributed to the separation of the departments of civil engineering and astronomy in the mid-1890s, with the Students' Observatory becoming the home of the Berkeley Astronomy Department.|$|E
5|$|Beginning January 17, 1848, {{the eight}} {{founders of the}} Misericorde Sisters, {{including}} Cadron-Jetté, commenced <b>practical</b> <b>training</b> in midwifery under Dr Eugène-Hercule Trudele, a young obstetrician. The objective of the training was to better prepare the sisters to meet the obligations of their fourth vow. The training lasted for 18 months and concluded with an examination before {{two members of the}} College of Physicians and Surgeons of Lower Canada, with the result that on July 12, 1849, the women received formal certificates of midwifery. It is most likely during this period or the years immediately following that Cadron-Jetté learned to read and write.|$|E
5|$|The first president, Joseph R. Williams, {{designed}} {{a curriculum that}} required more scientific study than practically any undergraduate institution of the era. It balanced science, liberal arts, and <b>practical</b> <b>training.</b> The curriculum excluded Latin and Greek studies since most applicants did not study any classical languages in their rural high schools. However, it did require three hours of daily manual labor, which kept costs down for both {{the students and the}} College. Despite Williams' innovations and his defense of education for the masses, the State Board of Education saw Williams' curriculum as elitist. They forced him to resign in 1859 and reduced the curriculum to a two-year vocational program.|$|E

5|$|Soon after {{founding}} the Scout movement, Robert Baden-Powell saw {{the need}} for leader training. Early Scoutmaster training camps were held in London and Yorkshire. Baden-Powell wanted <b>practical</b> <b>training</b> in the outdoors in campsites. World War I delayed the development of leader training, so the first formal Wood Badge course was not offered until 1919. Gilwell Park, just outside London, was purchased specifically to provide a venue for the course and the Opening Ceremonies were held on July 26, 1919. Francis Gidney, the first Camp Chief at Gilwell Park, conducted the first Wood Badge course there from September 8–19, 1919. It was produced by Percy Everett, the Commissioner of Training, and Baden-Powell himself gave lectures. The course was attended by 18 participants, and other lecturers. After this first course, Wood Badge training continued at Gilwell Park, and it became the home of leadership training in the Scout movement.|$|E
5|$|The Economic Development Board {{had been}} set up in 1961 to {{formulate}} and implement national economic strategies, focusing on promoting Singapore's manufacturing sector. Industrial estates were set up, especially in Jurong, and foreign investment was attracted to the country with tax incentives. The industrialization transformed the manufacturing sector to one that produced higher value-added goods and achieved greater revenue. The service industry also grew at this time, driven by demand for services by ships calling at the port and increasing commerce. This progress helped to alleviate the unemployment crisis. Singapore also attracted big oil companies like Shell and Esso to establish oil refineries in Singapore which, by the mid-1970s, became the third largest oil-refining centre in the world. The government invested heavily in an education system that adopted English as the language of instruction and emphasised <b>practical</b> <b>training</b> to develop a competent workforce well suited for the industry.|$|E
5|$|The recipes {{were often}} brief {{and did not}} give precise quantities. Cooking times and {{temperatures}} were seldom specified since accurate portable clocks were not available and since all cooking was done with fire. At best, cooking times could be specified as {{the time it took}} to say a certain number of prayers or how long it took to walk around a certain field. Professional cooks were taught their trade through apprenticeship and <b>practical</b> <b>training,</b> working their way up in the highly defined kitchen hierarchy. A medieval cook employed in a large household would most likely have been able to plan and produce a meal without the help of recipes or written instruction. Due to the generally good condition of surviving manuscripts it has been proposed by food historian Terence Scully that they were records of household practices intended for the wealthy and literate master of a household, such as the Ménagier de Paris from the late 14th century. Over 70 collections of medieval recipes survive today, written in several major European languages.|$|E
