50|$|Although {{the group}} is so diverse that it is {{difficult}} to characterize mineralogically, it has a well-established place in <b>petrographical</b> classifications because these peculiar composite arenaceous deposits are very frequent among Silurian and Cambrian rocks, and are less common in Mesozoic or Cenozoic strata.

By increasing metamorphism, greywackes frequently pass into mica-schists, chloritic schists and sedimentary gneisses.|$|E

50|$|For <b>petrographical</b> purposes, tuff is {{generally}} classified {{according to the}} nature of the volcanic rock of which it consists; this may be the same as the accompanying lavas if any were emitted during an eruption, and if there is a change in the kind of lava which is poured out, the tuffs also indicate this equally clearly. Rhyolite tuffs contain pumiceous, glassy fragments and small scoriae with quartz, alkali feldspar, biotite, etc. Iceland, Lipari, Hungary, the Basin and Range of the American southwest, and New Zealand are among the areas where such tuffs are prominent. The broken pumice is clear and isotropic, and very small particles commonly have crescentic, sickle-shaped, or biconcave outlines, showing that they are produced by the shattering of a vesicular glass, sometimes described as ash-structure. The tiny glass fragments derived from broken pumice are called shards; the glass shards readily deform and flow when the deposits are sufficiently hot, as shown in the accompanying image of welded tuff.|$|E
50|$|On {{account of}} the minuteness with which it has been {{described}} and the important controversies on points of theoretical geology which have arisen regarding it, the granulite district of Saxony (in the area of Rosswein and Penig) in Germany may be considered the typical region for rocks of this group. It should be remembered that though granulites are probably the commonest rocks of this country, they are mingled with granites, gneisses, gabbros, amphibolites, mica schists and many other <b>petrographical</b> types. All of these rocks show more-or-less metamorphism either of a thermal character or due to pressure and crushing. The granites pass into gneiss and granulite; the gabbros into flaser gabbro and amphibolite; the slates often contain andalusite or chiastolite, and show transitions to mica schists. At one time these rocks were regarded as Archean gneisses of a special type. Johannes Georg Lehmann propounded the hypothesis that their present state was due principally to crushingacting on them in a solid condition, grinding them down and breaking up their minerals, while the pressure {{to which they were}} subjected welded them together into coherent rock. It is now believed, however, that they are comparatively recent and include sedimentary rocks, partly of Palaeozoic age, and intrusive masses which may be nearly massive or may have gneissose, flaser or granulitic structures. These have been developed largely by the injection of semi-consolidated highly viscous intrusions, and the varieties of texture are original or were produced very shortly after the crystallization of the rocks. Meanwhile, however, Lehmanns advocacy of post-consolidation crushing as a factor in the development of granulites has been so successful that the terms granulitization and granulitic structures are widely employed to indicate the results of dynamometamorphism acting on rocks at a period long after their solidification.|$|E

40|$|The {{provenance}} of turbidites {{from the}} predominantly Arenig-aged Manx Group has been constrained using <b>petrographical</b> and geochemical techniques. <b>Petrographical</b> analysis of sandstones reveals that mono- and poly-crystalline quartz grains of cratonic origin are dominant.

There is little evidence of a juvenile volcanic input but a minor palaeovolcanic component of active continental margin affinity is present. There are indications of a more immature character in the oldest units but, on the whole, geochemical data from the Manx Group suggest an overall passive margin setting.

40|$|Microfocus {{computer}} tomography (mu CT) is a non-destructive technique for imaging internal features within an opaque object. Among {{the most important}} recent improvements of mu CT is its resolution of about 10 mum in three dimensions, which {{is much better than}} that obtainable with medical CT. The advantage of mu CT versus classical light microscopy is that three-dimensional <b>petrographical</b> information becomes available. The results from two complementary microfocus instruments are presented. The two instruments can accept different object sizes, ranging from a few millimetres to several centimetres in diameter. As a consequence, downscaling of <b>petrographical</b> features is possible both from medical CT to mu CT and within mu CT research. Apart from the possibilities of visualisation. attention is paid to the quantitative measurements that can be obtained from mu CT research which enables <b>petrographical</b> data to be linked to petrophysical data.

40|$|In this study, the geological, <b>petrographical</b> {{properties}} of rhyolitic tuffs exposed around Çan-Etili in the Biga Peninsula (NW Turkey) which are pyroclastic products of Late Oligocene-Early Miocene aged Çan Volcanism were investigated, also physical and mechanical characteristics of tuffs introduced {{and tried to}} determine the impact on engineering {{properties of}} <b>petrographical</b> features.

40|$|PosterWithin the {{framework}} of a Eu funded geological mapping program in Ghana, hand field magnetic susceptibility measurements have been performed to allow <b>petrographical</b> comparison between similar outcrop facies. This method allowed identifying varying lithologies of similar facies in north-western Ghana (Bole area). It completed geological observations, <b>petrographical</b> and geochemical analyses to facilitate geological mapping. Another experiment was tested on a more weathered area in the southwestern zone of Bogoso marked by a more tropical climate. Susceptibility measurements revealed only the level of weathering. We therefore replaced such method by applying hand field susceptibility measurements on collected soil samples for soil geochemistry. Around 3000 measurements were done on a 0. 5 ° square map. Magnetic susceptibility signal was therefore used as a proxy for mapping and showed more consistency with radiometric images rather than aeromagnetic images. This method revealed a good agreement with <b>petrographical,</b> even though on weathered rocks, field observations. Comparison of these results with soil geochemical analyses also revealed good consistency with the main mineral anomalies offering the possibility to use such tool as a proxy for mineral exploratio...|$|E
