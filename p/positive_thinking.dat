40|$|Objective: Although {{there is}} clear {{evidence}} that low levels of <b>positive</b> future <b>thinking</b> (anticipation of <b>positive</b> experiences in the future) and hopelessness are associated with suicide risk, {{the relationship between the}} content of <b>positive</b> future <b>thinking</b> and suicidal behavior has yet to be investigated. This is the first study to determine whether the positive future thinking–suicide attempt relationship varies {{as a function of the}} content of the thoughts and whether <b>positive</b> future <b>thinking</b> predicts suicide attempts over time. Method: A total of 388 patients hospitalized following a suicide attempt completed a range of clinical and psychological measures (depression, hopelessness, suicidal ideation, suicidal intent and <b>positive</b> future <b>thinking).</b> Fifteen months later, a nationally linked database was used to determine who had been hospitalized again after a suicide attempt. Results: During follow-up, 25. 6 % of linked participants were readmitted to hospital following a suicide attempt.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} students’ use of cohesive devices in online learning environment, i. e. threaded discussion {{and how it}} reflects the critical thinking. The study aims to: 1) determine the frequency of each type of cohesive devices, i. e. reference, substitution, ellipsis and conjunctions used by participants in threaded discussion, 2) determine the students’ critical thinking abilities by using the content analysis tool established by Newman et. at in 1995, and to 3) delve into the relationship, if any, {{the use of the}} cohesive devices in reflecting the critical thinking performance of participants. The lack of the studies which focused on the language use and how it might reflect the critical thinking of its user motivated the researcher to undertake this study. Participants of the threaded discussion were the postgraduate students of the Faculty of Languages and Linguistics of a public university located in Klang Valley. A mixed method data analysis method was adopted for this study. Data was collected from the postgraduate courses’ threaded discussion assignment mediated via a learning management system named Moodles. Overall, four threaded discussion transcripts were collected and used as the source of data of this study. Halliday and Hasan (1976) Taxonomy of Grammatical Cohesion and the Newman et. al (1995) content analysis scheme were adopted to analyse the data and these two models provided quantitative results. In order to investigate the link between the use of cohesive devices and critical thinking performance, an inductive qualitative data analysis approach was used to study the context where the pronoun 'I', substitution, ellipsis and conjunction appeared and how the use of them might reflect the critical thinking performance of the participants. Based on the Halliday and Hasan (1976) Taxonomy of Grammatical Cohesion, it was found that reference is the most frequently used cohesive device, followed by the conjunction, substitution and ellipsis. In addition, after coding the data using The Newman et. al (1995) content analysis scheme, {{it was found that the}} participants’ postings mainly reflected their critical thinking ability in terms of being able to include relevant(R+ <b>positive</b> critical <b>thinking</b> indicator), clear (AC+ <b>positive</b> critical <b>thinking</b> indicator), novel (N+ <b>positive</b> critical <b>thinking</b> indicator) and justified (JS+ <b>positive</b> critical <b>thinking</b> indicator) input into the threaded discussion. It was found that in the postings, the participants integrated a lot of their personal experience into the discussion and were able to link their ideas coherently. However, it was found that the participants generally lacked the ability to critically evaluate their peers’ or their own postings. Simultaneously, the findings revealed that in terms of the use of reference, personal pronoun ‘I’ scored the highest frequency of use and it was more for conveying a personal, substantiated agreement, disagreement or viewpoint, and they would be likely to be awarded <b>positive</b> critical <b>thinking</b> indicators such as R+, AC+, C+, and N+ indicators. While in instances where pronoun 'I' had been used to convey a personal but unsubstantiated agreement, disagreement or viewpoint, they would be likely to be awarded negative critical thinking indicators such as I-, L-, C-, N- and W- indicators. As far as the use of substitution and ellipsis is concerned, it seems that the correct use of these two cohesive devices helped make the instances clear and relevant to the overall context of discussion. However, the assignment of other codes or indicators, other than clear (AC+) and relevant (R+) indicators, seems not to be influenced by the correct use of substitution and ellipsis, rather it relied on the content tried to be conveyed by the instances where substitution and ellipsis had been found. With regard to how the use of the conjunction could reflect critical thinking, the use of the adversative conjunction ‘but’ and ‘however’ appeared were found to be more frequently assigned with the <b>positive</b> critical <b>thinking</b> indicator C+ (Critical assessment of others’ or own contributions) as compared to instances of the other conjunctions. The <b>positive</b> critical <b>thinking</b> indicator JS+ (Justification) was assigned most frequently to the instances where the causal conjunction ‘because’ was found. Apart from the <b>positive</b> critical <b>thinking</b> indicators C+ and JS+, it seems that the assignment of the rest of the <b>positive</b> critical <b>thinking</b> indicators and negative critical thinking indicators was not influenced by the use of different conjunction. Instead, the assignment of the other positive and negative critical thinking indicators was dependent on content of the sentences where conjunction items were found...|$|R

Parasuicidal and depressed participants showed decreased <b>positive</b> future <b>thinking,</b> but no increase in negative future thinking, in comparison with the community control group.

40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} UK Data Service {{and data}} collection copyright owner. The research project aimed to enhance understanding of suicidality by applying existing models of personality, motivation and emotion to the particular case of suicidal behaviour. In short, the research tested a model of suicidal behaviour which incorporated, for the first time, a number of recognised risk factors for psychological distress (including perfectionism, future thinking, goal adjustment and behavioural inhibition/activation sensitivity). Specifically, the research had five aims: {{to determine whether the}} sensitivity of the behavioural inhibition/behavioural activation systems (BIS/BAS) underpins suicidality; to determine whether the BIS/BAS sensitivity predicts future thinking; to investigate further the relationship between perfectionism, future thinking and suicidality; to determine whether perfectionism mediates the relations between BIS/BAS and suicidality; and to investigate whether goal adjustment moderates the relationship between social perfectionism and suicidality. To investigate these aims, 267 patients were recruited from a central Scotland general hospital, following an episode of self-harm, and asked to complete a range of psychological measures in the hospital (Time 1) and then again approximately two months later (Time 2). The results yielded evidence in support of each of the five aims noted above. Firstly, there was evidence that some of the BAS dimensions are associated with suicide risk and <b>positive</b> future <b>thinking.</b> In addition, it was found that <b>positive</b> future <b>thinking</b> moderated the relationship between social perfectionism and suicide risk, as predicted. However, {{there was no evidence that}} future thinking mediated the relationship between perfectionism and suicide risk. Although there was no evidence that perfectionism mediated the relationship between BIS/BAS and suicide risk, the results suggest that <b>positive</b> future <b>thinking</b> may act as a partial mediator in this relationship. Finally, goal adjustment may also moderate the relationship between perfectionism and suicide risk. Main Topics : Topics covered personality and suicidal behaviour, and associated measures. Respondents' demographic details were also gathered...|$|R
