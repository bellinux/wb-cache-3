40|$|Speaker {{verification}} is the biometric task of authenticating a claimed {{identity by}} means of analyzing a spoken sample of the claimant's voice. The present thesis deals with various topics related to automatic speaker verification (ASV) {{in the context of}} its commercial applications, characterized by co-operative users, user-friendly interfaces, and requirements for small amounts of enrollment and test data. A text-dependent system based on hidden Markov models (HMM) was developed and used to conduct experiments, including a comparison between visual and aural strategies for prompting claimants for randomized digit strings. It was found that aural prompts lead to more errors in spoken responses and that visually prompted utterances performed marginally better in ASV, given that enrollment data were visually prompted. High-resolution flooring techniques were proposed for variance estimation in the HMMs, but results showed no improvement over the standard method of using target-independent variances copied from a background model. These experiments were performed on Gandalf, a Swedish speaker verification telephone corpus with 86 client speakers. A complete on-site application (PER), a <b>physical</b> <b>access</b> <b>control</b> <b>system</b> securing a gate in a reverberant stairway, was implemented based on a combination of the HMM and a Gaussian mixture model based system. Users were authenticated by saying their proper name and a visually prompted, random sequence of digits after having enrolled by speaking ten utterances of the same type. An evaluation was conducted with 54 out of 56 clients who succeeded to enroll. Semi-dedicated impostor attempts were also collected. An equal error rate (EER) of 2. 4 % was found for this system based on a single attempt per session and after retraining the system on PER-specific development data. On parallel telephone data collected using a telephone version of PER, 3. 5 % EER was found with landline and around 5 % with mobile telephones. Impostor attempts in this case were same-handset attempts. Results also indicate that the distribution of false reject and false accept rates over target speakers are well described by beta distributions. A state-of-the-art commercial system was also tested on PER data with similar performance as the baseline research system. QC 2010091...|$|E

40|$|<b>Access</b> <b>control</b> <b>systems</b> {{are used}} to grant or deny the access to a person of a {{particular}} resource. There has been an enormous change in the trend of <b>access</b> <b>control</b> <b>systems</b> in recent times. Starting {{with the use of}} <b>physical</b> <b>access</b> <b>control</b> <b>systems</b> such as tokens, passwords etc., for the identification of a person, the trend has swayed towards designing and deploying of <b>access</b> <b>control</b> <b>systems</b> which use biometric identification of individual persons, for the grant or denial of access to resources. Biometric identification methods use various sources like retina, fingerprint, DNA etc., Biometric sources can be classified into two, namely physiological and behavioral. The former includes face, fingerprint, hand, iris, DNA and the latter includes keystroke, signature and voice. The <b>access</b> <b>control</b> <b>systems</b> using these biometric sources fundamentally identify and recognize a particular personal trait of person and compare it with the information available to grant or deny access to such person who seeks to interact with such system. As amongst such biometric sources to develop reliable <b>access</b> <b>control</b> <b>systems</b> researches have shown overt interest in using the face of a person (face recognition). Such inclination of the researchers is due to the various strategic advantages face recognition systems have like, its global application, wide and compatible collectability of data, cost effectiveness in implementation (for example existing surveillance cameras can be used to deploy such systems) when compared to other biometric methods and many more. The current project fundamentally aims at successfully designing and implementing a face recognition technology to develop an <b>access</b> <b>control</b> <b>system.</b> Out of the various available methods for developing a face recognition technology such as Fishersface, Hidden Markov model, dynamic link matching, three-dimensional face recognition, Eigenfaces etc., this project adopts Eigenfaces method of face recognition to achieve such aim. The project fundamentally detects and identifies human faces that work as a biometric source. This project aims to provide solution for the development of face recognition system by assuming that, problems involved in developing such systems are intrinsically a two dimensional rather than a three dimensional. It basically identifies the face of a person in a face image and then identifies the specific characteristics of such face image, then compares such characteristics with an existing database containing specific characteristics of several faces of different individuals, to decide if the former matches with any of the existing faces in the database. Eigenfaces method is utilised to achieve the above result where, face image is projected onto a feature space that spans the significant variations among known faces. The best variation among different images is calculated where during such calculation not exactly the facial features like eyes, nose, ears, etc., are classified. Instead it learns each face in an under constant observation as a whole...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} a {{challenging}} problem related {{to the analysis of}} <b>Access</b> <b>Control</b> <b>systems</b> which depend on time and location against undesirable scenarios such as inconsistency. In particular, this thesis first provides formal algebraic notations for the <b>Access</b> <b>Control</b> specifications {{in the context of a}} Spatio- Temporal Role Based <b>Access</b> <b>Control</b> (STRBAC) model. In order to analyse STRBAC specifications to detect inconsistencies and semi-consistencies, this thesis utilises Alloy and Timed Automata. A key challenge is how to automatically generate analysable formalisation such as Alloy and Timed Automata from the specifications. This thesis employs Model-Driven Architecture (MDA) technology to automate the transformation of the STRBAC model to Alloy as well as to Timed Automata and Timed Computation Tree Logic (TCTL). This is accomplished by defining one set of transformation rules for mapping STRBAC features to Alloy features and another set for mapping the features of the STRBAC model to Timed Automata and TCTL features. In addition, we present a comparative study between Alloy and Timed Automata from capability and performance points of view, following which we demonstrate that current <b>Access</b> <b>Control</b> models are not adequate for representing <b>Physical</b> <b>Access</b> <b>Control</b> (PAC) specifications and then discuss some of the limitations of the current models, which we highlight by conducting a case study involving the modelling of an <b>Access</b> <b>Control</b> mechanism used by British Telecom (BT).

Access {{from one to the other}} is impossible without passing a guard or a door lock, i. e., guards or distribution of keys/access-cards effectively enforce the <b>physical</b> <b>access</b> <b>control</b> policy. However, these mechanisms are generally coarse-grained, inflexible and expensive. In this paper, we propose a Sensor Enhanced <b>Access</b> <b>Control</b> (SEAC) model that extends existing logical <b>access</b> <b>control</b> models with context-awareness. This allows the model to incorporate information about the physical environment and to explicitly define and enforce <b>physical</b> <b>access</b> <b>control</b> policies for logical objects that have physical representations. A prototype implementation of the SEAC model has been developed for the Unix platform. The prototype protects file data when displayed on a computer screen by managing the visibility of windows in the X Window System. Context-awareness is provided by a simple motion detection system build using cheap web-cameras. However, the system is designed so that the sensor component easily can be replaced, making it possible to deploy advanced sensor technologies...|$|R

For this reason it is necessary to design and realize highly integrated, efficient and reliable <b>access</b> <b>control</b> <b>systems.</b> The authors illustrate the work made to design and realize the integrated <b>access</b> <b>control</b> <b>system</b> of the most important commercial and tourist ports of Italy...|$|R

In our prototype <b>system,</b> <b>physical</b> <b>access</b> <b>control</b> policies are specified using the eXtensible <b>Access</b> <b>Control</b> Markup Language. Based {{on the policy}} and the user’s presence information, our dialog system automatically produces {{a series of questions}} and answers that, if correctly answered, permit the requester to enter the secure facility or smart building. The novelty of this work is the system’s ability to generate questions appropriate to the physical location, time of day, and the requester’s attributes...|$|R

Recent work on risk-based <b>access</b> <b>control</b> <b>systems</b> has shown promise at resolving the inadequacies of traditional <b>access</b> <b>control</b> <b>systems,</b> and promise to increase information sharing and security. We consider some of the core open problems in risk-based <b>access</b> <b>control</b> <b>systems,</b> namely where and how much risk to take. We propose the use of market mechanisms to determine an organization’s risk tolerance and allocation. We show that with the correct incentives, an employee will make optimal choices for the organization. We also comment on how the market {{can be used to}} ensure employees behave honestly and detect those who are malicious. Through simulations, we empirically show the advantage of risk-based <b>access</b> <b>control</b> <b>systems</b> and market mechanisms at increasing information sharing and security...|$|R
