40|$|Abstract. We {{investigate}} {{a number of}} Presburger liveness problems for nondeterministic reversal-bounded multicounter machines with a free counter (NCMFs). We show the following: – The-Presburger-i. o. <b>problem</b> <b>and</b> the-Presburger-eventual <b>problem</b> are both decidable. So are their duals, the-Presburger-almost-always <b>problem</b> <b>and</b> the-Presburger-always <b>problem.</b> – The-Presburger-i. o. <b>problem</b> <b>and</b> the-Presburger-eventual <b>problem</b> are both undecidable. So are their duals, the-Presburger-almost-always <b>problem</b> <b>and</b> the-Presburger-always <b>problem.</b> These results {{can be used to}} formulate a weak form of Presburger linear temporal logic and develop its model-checking theories for NCMFs. NCMFs can be used to model reactive systems with counts on external events. ...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{present a}} {{meta-analysis}} of current {{research on the}} prevalence, identification, <b>and</b> treatment of <b>problem</b> <b>and</b> compulsive gamblers. QUALITY OF EVIDENCE: <b>Problem</b> <b>and</b> compulsive gambling was not a socio-scientific concern until the last two decades. Hence research on this topic is limited. The summary and analysis for this paper relied on computer searches of journal and news abstracts in addition to direct contact with organizations addressing the identification and treatment of compulsive gamblers. MAIN MESSAGE: An estimated 5 % of those who gamble run into problems. About 1 % of those who gamble are predicted to experience serious problems. Successful treatment of <b>problem</b> <b>and</b> compulsive gambling {{continues to be a}} challenge. Although cognitive therapy has been the favoured approach, a combination of several therapeutic approaches is advocated. CONCLUSIONS: <b>Problem</b> <b>and</b> compulsive gambling can present a real health threat. As with other addictions, treatment strategies continue to be a baffling social <b>problem.</b> Aware <b>and</b> informed physicians can have a pivotal role in the difficult process of identifying, acknowledging, <b>and</b> remediating <b>problem</b> <b>and</b> compulsive gambling...|$|R
