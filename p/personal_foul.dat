5|$|A {{technical}} foul {{requires that the}} defenceman who fouled a player on the opposing team {{be placed in the}} penalty box for 30 seconds. As with a <b>personal</b> <b>foul,</b> until the penalty time expires, no replacement for the player is allowed and the team must play one man short. The player (or a replacement) is allowed to reenter the game once the time in the penalty box is over and the team is thus once again at full strength.|$|E
5|$|Air Force {{finished}} {{the game with}} 227rushing yards and 318total yards on offense. The Falcons also committed four 15-yard <b>personal</b> <b>foul</b> penalties in addition to other, more minor, penalties accumulated during the game. Air Force's leading rusher was Anthony Butler, who carried the ball 17 times for 75 yards. Anthony Park was the Falcons' leading receiver, catching Harridge's second-play 47-yard throw for his only reception of the game.|$|E
5|$|Defense {{dominated}} in {{the first}} quarter of the game. Virginia Tech received the opening kickoff, but failed to capitalize on its opening drive thanks to a <b>personal</b> <b>foul</b> penalty that forced the Hokies to punt. On its first possession, Georgia moved into scoring position courtesy of a 26-yard run by Kregg Lumpkin. Failing to advance the ball further, Georgia sent in kicker Brandon Coutu who kicked a 39-yard field goal to give Georgia the early lead, 3–0.|$|E

5|$|After taking {{possession}} {{on his own}} 16-yard line, Georgia quarterback and true freshman Matthew Stafford caused the first turning point of the game as he threw an interception to Brenden Hill of Virginia Tech. Starting deep in Georgia territory, Virginia Tech was further aided by a <b>personal</b> <b>foul</b> on Georgia, which set up a first-and-goal situation for Virginia Tech on the Georgia 6-yard line. A two-yard run by Virginia Tech tailback Branden Ore brought the ball closer to the goal line and ended {{the first quarter of}} play.|$|E
5|$|Air Force {{returned}} the Virginia Tech kickoff to its 21-yard line and was {{aided by a}} 15-yard <b>personal</b> <b>foul</b> penalty against Virginia Tech after the return. The Falcons thus began their drive at their 36-yard line. They continued moving the ball forward on short rushes, but almost had a severe setback when Weiss fumbled during a carry. He recovered his own drop, however, and the Falcons retained possession. With the Falcons facing fourth down on their half of the field, time ran out in the quarter. At {{the end of the}} first quarter, Virginia Tech held a 73 lead.|$|E
5|$|Following Stanford's post-touchdown kickoff, Virginia Tech's offense {{took the}} field at its 25-yard line and {{embarked}} upon one of its longest drives {{of the game in}} terms of the number of plays. In the first seven plays of the drive, quarterback Taylor was the key component. He threw six passes, completing 3 for 39yards, and ran once, for no gain. On the eighth play of the drive, running back Ryan Williams gained one yard, then committed a 15-yard <b>personal</b> <b>foul</b> penalty. Tech's drive faltered after the penalty: Taylor threw an incomplete pass, then was sacked for a 16-yard loss, and the Hokies punted to the Stanford 28-yard line.|$|E

Two technical fouls results in a disqualification.|$|R
5|$|Following the missed field goal, Air Force's offense began {{operations}} at its 24-yard line. Running back Anthony Butler broke free for an 18-yard gain {{on the third}} play of the drive, giving Air Force a first down. Two plays later, however, Harridge threw a pass that was intercepted by Tech linebacker Vegas Robinson. At {{the end of the}} play, Air Force committed a 15-yard <b>personal</b> <b>foul</b> penalty, which allowed the Tech offense to take over at the Air Force 15-yard line. Tech needed just two plays to drive the 15 yards and earn a touchdown, its first of the game. With 2:26 remaining in the quarter, Air Force's lead had been cut to 10–7.|$|E
5|$|Having {{recovered}} the ball, and with Virginia Tech having no remaining timeouts {{and no way}} to stop the clock, Florida State was able to run out the remaining time in the game and secure a 2722 victory. Towards the end of the game, players on each team acted with hostility towards each other, and several received <b>personal</b> <b>foul</b> penalties. The penalties had no effect on the final outcome of the game, and Florida State won the ACC Championship Game and an automatic bid to the 2006 Orange Bowl.|$|E
5|$|Kansas {{took over}} {{at its own}} 12-yard line after the punt. On the first play of the drive, Reesing {{completed}} a 37-yard pass to Dexton Fields, putting the ball near midfield. Three straight incomplete passes later, Kansas faced a fourth-and-ten and a punt. Instead of punting the ball away, however, Kansas elected to try a risky fake punt-pass. Instead of snapping {{the ball to the}} punter, the ball was snapped to running back Brandon McAnderson, who threw the ball 22yards downfield to Micah Brown for a first down. On the very next play, Reesing, having returned to the field, connected on a 28-yard pass to Dexton Fields, who was pushed out of bounds just short of the goal line. With a first-and-goal from inside the one-yard line, a Kansas touchdown seemed inevitable. On the first play inside the red zone, however, Kansas fumbled the ball. Though the ball was recovered by a Kansas player, the play lost fouryards. On the next play, Kansas committed a 15-yard <b>personal</b> <b>foul</b> penalty. The <b>personal</b> <b>foul</b> was followed by a 10-yard holding penalty, and Kansas was pushed entirely outside the Virginia Tech red zone. In an effort to push back, Reesing threw a pass deep downfield. Instead of being completed, however, the ball was intercepted by Virginia Tech's D.J. Parker. With 39seconds left in the quarter, Virginia Tech had stopped Kansas from gaining a point despite the Jayhawks penetrating inside the Virginia Tech one-yard line.|$|E

50|$|Tech's {{discipline}} troubles {{came to a}} {{head when}} the Hokies were blown out in consecutive weeks by Georgia Tech and Boston College. Beamer responded by cracking down on trash-talking, <b>personal</b> <b>fouls,</b> and other negative behaviors. The team responded and committed no <b>personal</b> <b>fouls</b> and only two defensive penalties total in the three games following the BC loss.|$|R
500|$|For most fouls, the {{offending}} player {{is sent to}} the penalty box and his team has to play without him and with one fewer player for a short amount of time. Penalties are classified as either <b>personal</b> <b>fouls</b> or technical <b>fouls.</b> <b>Personal</b> <b>fouls</b> are of a more serious nature and are generally penalised with a 1-minute suspension. Technical fouls are violations of the rules that are not as serious as <b>personal</b> <b>fouls,</b> and are penalised for 30 seconds or a loss of possession. Occasionally a longer penalty may be assessed for more severe infractions. Players penalised for 6 <b>personal</b> <b>fouls</b> must leave the game. The penalised team is said to be playing man down defense while the other team is on the man up, or playing [...] "extra man offence." [...] During a typical game, each team will have three to five extra man offence opportunities.|$|R
5|$|Louisville's {{second drive}} {{of the game}} was much quicker than the Cardinals' first. After {{beginning}} at their own 20-yard line, it took the Cardinals just seven plays to travel 80yards and earn a touchdown. Louisville was helped throughout the drive by repeated Virginia Tech <b>personal</b> <b>foul</b> penalties. Tech players committed three separate 15-yard personal fouls during the drive, one of which came after Louisville's successful extra point kick when cornerback Jimmy Williams bumped a game official. Williams was ejected from the game for the contact and {{was removed from the}} field after watching the next series from the sidelines. The touchdown and extra point extended Louisville's first-quarter lead to 14–3.|$|E
5|$|On {{the opening}} kickoff, the Jets were penalized for a <b>personal</b> <b>foul</b> against the Raiders. The Jets took an early 6–0 lead on 44-yard and 18-yard field goals made by kicker Jim Turner.

The Raiders added to their lead when Lamonica threw a 48-yard pass to tight end Billy Cannon at the beginning of the second quarter.|$|E
5|$|The Eagles' post-touchdown kickoff was {{returned}} to the Tech 33-yard line, and on the first play after the kick, Boston College committed a <b>personal</b> <b>foul</b> penalty when Tyrod Taylor was hit out of bounds. Following the penalty, the ball was advanced to the Tech 42-yard line and the Hokies were given a first down. Tech completed two short passes, advancing to the 50-yard line, but the Hokies punted after not gaining another first down. The kick sailed out of bounds, and the Eagles returned to offense with 19 seconds remaining in the first half. Rather than try to score quickly, Boston College elected to run out the clock with Virginia Tech leading, 14–7.|$|E

On the first play within Hokie territory, Weiss fumbled the ball, but fell {{on it for a}} loss, and Air Force retained possession. Weiss made up for his fumble two plays later when he scrambled for a first down that kept the drive going. Despite that effort, Tech was able to force a stop and Air Force punted with 3:10 remaining in the quarter.|$|E
5|$|The {{fourth quarter}} began with Virginia Tech {{searching for a}} way to answer Georgia's {{previous}} two scores and quash the momentum Georgia had picked up. On the third play of the quarter, however, Virginia Tech quarterback Sean Glennon threw an interception to Georgia's Tony Taylor. Beginning on their own 35-yard line, Georgia capitalized on the mistake quickly, courtesy of a 15-yard <b>personal</b> <b>foul</b> penalty and a 41-yard completion from Stafford to Milner. Georgia, hoping to tie the time, attempted and completed a two-point conversion. The resulting scores tied the game at 21–21 with 12:39 remaining in the game.|$|E
5|$|Virginia Tech's first {{offensive}} {{drive of}} the second quarter began on an auspicious note as quarterback Sean Glennon completed a 16-yard pass to wide receiver Josh Morgan. Following the play, a Boston College player committed a <b>personal</b> <b>foul,</b> which added 15yards {{to the end of}} the pass. Another long pass by Glennon, coupled with yet another Boston College penalty, put Virginia Tech deep into the red zone, and the Hokies scored on a 5-yard touchdown pass to Morgan.

Needing to regain the lead, the Hokies returned Air Force's kickoff to near the 20-yard line but committed a 15-yard <b>personal</b> <b>foul</b> penalty that pushed Tech back to its 12-yard line and forced the Hokies to gain 22yards for a first down. Tech was unable to do this due to strong defense from Air Force and punted after going three and out. The kick was short, and Air Force began its drive at its 44-yard line. The Falcons likewise went three and out and punted back to Tech.|$|E
5|$|Following the post-touchdown kickoff {{and a short}} return, Nebraska's offense {{began work}} at its 21-yard line. Three rushes by as many {{different}} players—Joel Makovicka, Damon Benning, and Jay Sims—resulted in 11 yards and a first down. During Sims' run, Tech's Loren Johnson committed a 15-yard <b>personal</b> <b>foul</b> facemask penalty that pushed Nebraska to the Nebraska 47-yard line. From there, Frost threw an incomplete pass, then Sims ran twice for fifteen yards and a first down, crossing into the Virginia Tech half of {{the field in the}} process. Now at the Tech 38-yard line, Frost completed a 23-yard throw to Lance Brown, who picked up another first down at the Tech 15-yard line. With time running out in the quarter, the Cornhuskers executed a quick four-yard rush to the Tech 11-yard line. At {{the end of the first}} quarter, Virginia Tech led Nebraska, 70, but the Cornhuskers were in scoring position.|$|E
5|$|Thanks to the {{interception}} {{in the end}} zone, Alabama's offense {{returned to}} the field at its 20-yard line, the regulation starting point after a ball is downed in the end zone.

Zow then completed another first-down pass, this time to Freddy Milons at Alabama 45-yard line. Alexander rushed ahead for a one-yard gain, then Zow threw an interception to Tech defender Ryan Smith, who returned {{the ball to the}} Alabama 36-yard line. After the interception, Virginia Tech committed a 15-yard <b>personal</b> <b>foul</b> penalty, which pushed the Hokies back to their 49-yard line.|$|E
