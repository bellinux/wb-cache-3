5|$|Lace was {{released}} from Dartmoor in July 1987 and settled in nearby Brixham, Devon, returning to visit family in Portsmouth in 1988. He intimated that he was depressed about his past actions and in December 1988 gave away his possessions and resigned from his job. He was last seen by friends between 7–8 December and was found dead by his landlord on 9December. Postmortem examination revealed superficial wounds to his wrist, ingestion of analgesics and a plastic bag over his head. The {{cause of death was}} determined to be asphyxiation and his death was determined as suicide by the coroner. Lace was buried in Kingston Cemetery, Portsmouth on 20December 1988. After a cross check on the DNA database found that the DNA from the murder scene showed a <b>partial</b> <b>match</b> with that of a relative of Lace, detectives requested a sample from Andrina Foster, Lace's biological sister, which gave a familial match with the murderer's DNA. As a result of this development, Lace's body was exhumed on 12 August 2009 for DNA testing as part of Operation Iceberg.|$|E
5|$|Megan's lawyer ex-husband Todd (Jeffrey Nordling) {{arrives at}} Megan's work, needing {{forensic}} testing for evidence {{that his client}} Manny Santos (Carlos Apostle), is a juvenile. Kate Murphy (Jeri Ryan) greets him, and she asks Curtis Brumfield (Windell Middlebrooks) to help examine him. Curtis finds evidence which suggests Manny has received recent trauma to ribs and other body parts, suggesting that he’s being abused. Curtis explains to Todd that Manny is a juvenile, but {{he will not be}} able to be released back to his former home, as he is being abused there. Meanwhile, the evidence for the murderer fits a <b>partial</b> <b>match</b> to Mike, so Megan concludes that Ed is not Mike's father. She goes to visit Jen; however she slams the door in her face. Megan walks into her house and finds Mike's real father Tim (Timothy Devlin), holding Ed's and Jen's baby daughter hostage. Tim takes Jen into the garden when the police arrive, so Bud shoots him in the leg and arrests him and Jen is reunited with Sophie and Mike.|$|E
5|$|The suspect (later {{identified}} as David Lace) was discovered when {{the profile of}} the killer showed a <b>partial</b> <b>match</b> on the national database, which belonged to a sibling of a previous suspect. A further sample was taken from another sibling, who was not on the database, to help confirm the match via a process called familial searching. At first the police refused to release the identity of the new prime suspect, except to reveal that he had committed suicide in 1988, and had confessed to DeSimone's murder while in custody for an unrelated crime in 1983, 18 months after Hodgson's conviction. His body was exhumed at Kingston cemetery in Portsmouth on 12 August 2009 in order to compare his DNA to that found at the crime scene. Hampshire Constabulary said the breakthrough in the case was only possible because of advances in forensic science and tests on the body would take six weeks, after which a file on the dead suspect could then be submitted to the Crown Prosecution Service. Visitors to the cemetery in Portsmouth said the grave of the suspect had no headstone and was untended. Police revealed that the suspect's confession was one of seven which had been made since Hodgson's conviction.|$|E
3000|$|Step 3 (Assembly) Each site finds all local <b>partial</b> <b>matches</b> in the {{corresponding}} fragment. The {{next step is}} to assemble <b>partial</b> <b>matches</b> to compute crossing matches and compute the final results. We propose two assembly strategies: centralized and distributed (or parallel). In centralized, all local <b>partial</b> <b>matches</b> are sent to a single site for assembly. For example, in a client/server system, all local <b>partial</b> <b>matches</b> may be sent to the server. In distributed/parallel, local <b>partial</b> <b>matches</b> are combined at a number of sites in parallel.|$|R
30|$|We first {{define the}} {{conditions}} under which two <b>partial</b> <b>matches</b> are joinable. Obviously, crossing matches can only be formed by assembling <b>partial</b> <b>matches</b> from different fragments.|$|R
30|$|In the {{centralized}} assembly, all local <b>partial</b> <b>matches</b> {{are sent}} to a final assembly site. We propose an iterative join algorithm to find all crossing matches. In each iteration, a pair of local <b>partial</b> <b>matches</b> is joined. When the join is complete (i.e., a match has been found), the result is returned; otherwise, it is joined with other local <b>partial</b> <b>matches</b> in the next iteration. In {{order to reduce the}} join space of the iterative join algorithm, we divide all local <b>partial</b> <b>matches</b> into multiple partitions such that two local <b>partial</b> <b>matches</b> in the same set cannot be joinable; we only consider joining local <b>partial</b> <b>matches</b> from different partitions. In the distributed assembly, we adopt Bulk Synchronous Parallel (BSP) model [28] to design a synchronous algorithm for distributed assembly. A BSP computation proceeds in a series of global supersteps, each of which consists of three components: local computation, communication and barrier synchronization. In the local computation step, each site adopts the iterative join algorithm to assemble local <b>partial</b> <b>matches</b> within the site. If a join result is a complete match of query graph Q, it will be returned directly; otherwise, these join results (i.e., the intermediate results) will be sent to the other sites in the communication step. The details about the communication and system termination condition are discussed in [23].|$|R

25|$|Partial DNA matches are not {{searches}} themselves, but are {{the result}} of moderate stringency CODIS searches that produce a potential match that shares at least one allele at every locus. Partial matching does not involve the use of familial search software, such as those used in the UK and United States, or additional Y-STR analysis, and therefore often misses sibling relationships. Partial matching has been used to identify suspects in several cases in the UK and United States, and has also been used as a tool to exonerate the falsely accused. Darryl Hunt was wrongly convicted in connection with the rape and murder of a young woman in 1984 in North Carolina. Hunt was exonerated in 2004 when a DNA database search produced a remarkably close match between a convicted felon and the forensic profile from the case. The <b>partial</b> <b>match</b> led investigators to the felon’s brother, Willard E. Brown, who confessed to the crime when confronted by police. A judge then signed an order to dismiss the case against Hunt.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} an {{approach}} which can improve Inductive Logic Programming in multiclass problems.

The most suitable class should be the class whose important <b>partial</b> <b>matches</b> cover the example more than those from other classes. Hence, the <b>partial</b> <b>matches</b> of the rule, called partial rules, are first extracted from the original rules...|$|R

Furthermore, they share a common crossing edge 008, 003, where 008 and 003 match query vertices v_ 3 and v_ 5 in the two local <b>partial</b> <b>matches,</b> respectively. Hence, they are joinable. Figure  8 also shows the join result of PM_ 1 ^ 2 [...] _fPM_ 2 ^ 2.|$|R

2500|$|Familial DNA {{database}} searching {{was first}} used in an investigation leading to the conviction of Jeffrey Gafoor {{of the murder of}} Lynette White in the United Kingdom on 4 July 2003. DNA evidence was matched to Gafoor's nephew, who at 14 years old had not been born {{at the time of the}} murder in 1988. It was used again in 2004 to find a man who threw a brick from a motorway bridge and hit a lorry driver, killing him. DNA found on the brick matched that found at the scene of a car theft earlier in the day, but there were no good matches on the national DNA database. A wider search found a <b>partial</b> <b>match</b> to an individual; on being questioned, this man revealed he had a brother, Craig Harman, who lived very close to the original crime scene. Harman voluntarily submitted a DNA sample, and confessed when it matched the sample from the brick. Currently, familial DNA database searching is not conducted on a national level in the United States, where states determine how and when to conduct familial searches. The first familial DNA search with a subsequent conviction in the United States was conducted in Denver, Colorado, in 2008, using software developed under the leadership of Denver District Attorney Mitch Morrissey and Denver Police Department Crime Lab Director Gregg LaBerge. California was the first state to implement a policy for familial searching under then Attorney General, now Governor, Jerry Brown. In his role as consultant to the Familial Search Working Group of the California Department of Justice, former Alameda County Prosecutor Rock Harmon is widely considered to have been the catalyst in the adoption of familial search technology in California. The technique was used to catch the Los Angeles serial killer known as the [...] "Grim Sleeper" [...] in 2010. It wasn't a witness or informant that tipped off law enforcement to the identity of the [...] "Grim Sleeper" [...] serial killer, who had eluded police for more than two decades, but DNA from the suspect's own son. The suspect's son was arrested and convicted in a felony weapons charge and swabbed for DNA last year. When his DNA was entered into the database of convicted felons, detectives were alerted to a <b>partial</b> <b>match</b> to evidence found at the [...] "Grim Sleeper" [...] crime scenes. David Franklin Jr., also known as the Grim Sleeper, was charged with ten counts of murder and one count of attempted murder. More recently, familial DNA, led to the arrest of 21-year-old Elvis Garcia on charges of sexual assault and false imprisonment of a woman in Santa Cruz in 2008. In March 2011 Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell announced that Virginia would begin using familial DNA searches. Other states are expected to follow.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. A novel {{negative}} selection algorithm, namely r[]-NSA, is proposed in this paper, which uses an array to store multiple <b>partial</b> <b>matching</b> lengths for each detector. Every bit of one detector is assigned a <b>partial</b> <b>matching</b> length. As for a detector, the <b>partial</b> <b>matching</b> length of one bit means that one string is asserted to be {{matched by the}} detector, {{if and only if}} the number of the maximal continuous identical bits between them from the position of the bit to the end of strings is no less than the <b>partial</b> <b>matching</b> length, and the continuous identical bits should start from the position of the bit. The detector generation algorithm and detection algorithm of r[]-NSA are given.

40|$|Abstract. The CAD {{models of}} {{mechanical}} parts usually have many blends and chamfers, {{and the existence}} of these machining features can greatly change the geometric and topological patterns of the CAD models, but the existing <b>partial</b> <b>matching</b> algorithms cannot match the CAD models which contain machining features such as blends and chamfers. In this paper, a new approach to <b>partial</b> <b>matching</b> based on the constraints of transition features is proposed. Firstly, the transition features are identified by feature recognition, and then these machining features are removed to eliminate the impacts to the geometric and topological information of the CAD models, and the attribute adjacent graph is reconstructed, finally, the sub-graph isomorphism approach is used to achieve the <b>partial</b> <b>matching.</b> Experimental results show that this method can achieve <b>partial</b> <b>matching</b> of CAD models which contain machining features such as blends and chamfers, and the matching efficiency can satisfy the requirement of the engineering retrieval...|$|R
40|$|Large {{variations}} in image background may cause <b>partial</b> <b>matching</b> and normalization problems for histogram-based representations, i. e., the histograms {{of the same}} category may have bins which are significantly different, and normalization may produce large changes in the differences between corresponding bins. In this paper, we {{deal with this problem}} by using the ratios between bin values of histograms, rather than bin values' differences which are used in the traditional histogram distances. We propose a bin ratio-based histogram distance (BRD), which is an intra-cross-bin distance, in contrast with previous bin-to-bin distances and cross-bin distances. The BRD is robust to <b>partial</b> <b>matching</b> and histogram normalization, and captures correlations between bins with only a linear computational complexity. We combine the BRD with the ℓ 1 histogram distance and the χ 2 histogram distance to generate the ℓ 1 BRD and the χ 2 BRD, respectively. These combinations exploit and benefit from the robustness of the BRD under <b>partial</b> <b>matching</b> and the robustness of the ℓ 1 and χ 2 distances to small noise. We propose a method for assessing the robustness of histogram distances to <b>partial</b> <b>matching.</b> The BRDs and logistic regression-based histogram fusion are applied to image classification. The experimental results on synthetic data sets show the robustness of the BRDs to <b>partial</b> <b>matching,</b> and the experiments on seven benchmark data sets demonstrate promising results of the BRDs for image classification...|$|R
40|$|Intrinsic shape {{matching}} {{has become}} the standard ap-proach for pose invariant correspondence estimation among deformable shapes. Most existing approaches as-sume global consistency. While global isometric match-ing is well understood, only a few heuristic solutions are known for <b>partial</b> <b>matching.</b> <b>Partial</b> <b>matching</b> is particu-larly important for robustness to topological noise, which is a common problem in real-world scanner data.

We develop a new repre-sentation for partial isometric maps based on equivalence classes of correspondences between pairs of points and their tangent-spaces. We apply our approach to register partial point clouds and compare it to the state-of-the-art methods, where we obtain significant improvements over global methods for real-world data and stronger guaran-tees than previous <b>partial</b> <b>matching</b> algorithms. ...|$|R
