40|$|Organic {{materials}} have attracted remarkable {{interest in the}} field of electronics due to good mechanical stability and semiconducting and conducting properties. Organic semiconductors have the advantage of large area fabrication and low temperature deposition. Hence, low cost electronic devices can be easily fabricated over large scale by employing organic materials. The stated features assure organic materials as prominent candidates for the development of organic electromechanical sensors. The aim of this work was to study the applicability of organic materials for various electromechanical sensors. In this research work, thin films of various organic semiconducting materials and composites were employed for the development of organic field effect transistor (OFET) and sensors to investigate their electromechanical properties. In this dissertation, the organic materials investigated were copper phthalocyanine (CuPc), poly-N-epoxypropylcarbazole (PEPC), nickel phthalocyanine (NiPc) and carbon nanotubes (CNTs). Inorganic materials, vanadium oxide (VO 2) and cuprous oxide Cu 2 O were also investigated and used in making composites for altering the properties of devices. CuPc was employed in fabrication of OFET by vacuum evaporation method. The OFET was then characterized for pressure and displacement sensing properties. The variations in drain to source resistance were measured for applied pressure and change in displacement, respectively. PEPC microcomposite thin films were drop-casted on a variety of substrates to fabricate sandwich type sensors. The different substrates used were aluminium, steel, plastic and glass (with prefabricated electrodes). The substrates in this study served dual purpose, i. e., serving as an electrode and providing mechanical support to the device. The sensors were investigated for applied pressure and change in displacement. The measurements were made for different concentrations of composites and for different thicknesses of thin films. The variations in resistance and capacitance of the transducer were observed with the applied stimuli. In the first case, Cu 2 O-PEPC range of 30. 100 m. The AC resistance and capacitance at 120 Hz of the transducer decreased by 1 : 1 ï¿½ï¿½ 1 : 4 and increased by 1 : 2 ï¿½ï¿½ 1 : 8 times respectively as the pressure was increased up to 100 kNm. 2. Afterwards, V 2 O 4 -PEPC microcomposites were used to develop another pressure sensor. The thickness of the V 2 O 4 -PEPC films were in the range of 20. 40 m. The DC resistance of the sensor decreased on average by 24 times as the pressure was increased up to 11 : 7 kNm. 2. Finally, Cu 2 O-PEPC-NiPc microcomposites were used to develop pressure sensor. The film thickness of the composite was in the range of 20. 30 m. The decrease in resistance of the sensor was observed 10 times by increasing the external uniaxial pressure up to 11 : 7 kNm. 2. In case of displacement sensor, Cu 2 O-PEPC microcomposites were used to fabricate displacement transducer. The thicknesses of the films were in the range of 50. 60 mAs the displacement from 0. 0 : 6 mm, the decrease in sensors DC resistance was observed as 1 : 5 times to the initial resistance, and accordingly, the increase in AC capacitance (at 120 Hz) was measured 2 : 31 times to the initial capacitance by applying the displacement in the range of 0 to 1 : 3 mm. Furthermore, the CNTs based Al/CNT/Al sandwich type sensors were investigated. Sensors were fabricated by deposition of the CNTs on the adhesive elastic <b>polymer</b> <b>tape</b> and placing it in the elastic casing. The resistance-pressure and resistance-displacement relationships were determined to ensure the piezoresistive properties of CNTs. The diameter of multiwalled nanotubes (MWNTs) varied between 10. 30 nm. The nominal thicknesses of the CNTs layers in the sensors were ï¿½ï¿½ 300. 430 m. The interelectrode length (gap) and width of the sensors were in the range of 4. 6 mm and 3. 4 mm, respectively. In investigation of the pressure sensor, the decrease in DC resistance was noted as 3. 4 times as the pressure was increased up to 17 kN=m 2, whereas the DC resistance of the displacement sensors from different batches was decreased in average by 3 times as the displacement was increased up to 900 m. Finally, measurements were made on CNT-Cu 2 O composite as a strain sensor. The press-tablets of the composite were fabricated and glued on the flexible elastic beam. The electromechanical properties of the sensors were measured under compression and tension. The inter-electrode length (gap between the contacts) and width of the samples were in the range of 6 - 8 mm and 10 mm, respectively. The variation in DC resistance of the transducers were observed under compression and tension. It was noted that the resistance decreases 24 - 28 times under compression while increases 44 - 46 times under tension. The resistance-strain relationships were also simulated...|$|E
40|$|The use {{of carbon}} fibre-reinforced {{composites}} {{has been growing}} exponentially {{in the past few}} decades. They offer excellent mechanical properties in combination with a low density, making them an ideal solution for many lightweight applications. However, they often suffer from a lack of toughness. In contrast with carbon fibre composites, self-reinforced composites have an excellent toughness, but a relatively low stiffness and strength. They consist of a polymer fibre in a matrix made from the same polymer. This thesis aims to break through the typical stiffness-toughness dilemma by hybridising carbon fibres with self-reinforced polypropylene (SRPP) and to design a material that is both stiff and tough. The focus lies on optimising the tensile properties and impact resistance of these novel hybrid composites. Before hybridising SRPP, it is vital that the influence of the process parameters on the mechanical properties of SRPP is understood. Hot compaction uses oriented monocomponent <b>polymer</b> <b>tapes,</b> and melts their outer surface to create the matrix. This process has a narrow processing window and is therefore inherently sensitive to the process parameters. It was shown that increasing the temperature or dwell time increased the matrix fraction and molecular relaxation of the oriented <b>polymer</b> <b>tapes.</b> This leads to improved interlayer bonding, which has a small effect on the tensile properties, but a large effect on the impact resistance. The compaction pressure was even more important, as too low of a pressure can strongly reduce the penetration impact resistance. The impact resistance is a key advantage of SRPP, and therefore potential issues with traditional testing techniques were identified. Hybridisation of SRPP with carbon fibres resulted in a novel class of hybrid composites with a unique combination of stiffness, strength, ultimate failure strain and impact resistance. Inter- and intralayer hybrids were developed and optimised. For interlayer hybrids, it was revealed how the damage development in tension can be controlled by changing the carbon fibre volume fraction, the carbon fibre and SRPP orientation, and the relative layer thickness. An appropriate choice of these parameters leads to pseudo-ductility, where the carbon fibre layers are able to fracture multiple times. For intralayer hybrids, the importance of intralayer bonding was highlighted. This parameter is crucial as a strong intralayer bonding reduces the ultimate failure strain and impact resistance, but improves the flexural properties. Improving the adhesion between carbon fibre and polypropylene has a similar, but more pronounced effect. The experimental work was supported by extensive modelling studies. A novel and versatile strength model for unidirectional hybrid composites was developed. This model was first elaborated for non-hybrid composites, and its strengths and limitations were identified. An in-depth experimental validation was performed for carbon fibre composites by comparing fibre failure predictions with synchrotron computed tomography data. This led to vital recommendations for future model developments. This model was then extended to hybrid composites and an extensive parametric study was performed. This study focused on the hybrid effect, which is a synergistic effect that increases the failure strain of carbon fibres through hybridisation with a more ductile fibre. The hybrid effect was shown to increase by reducing the carbon fibre volume fraction and by improving the dispersion of both fibre types. The mechanical properties of the ductile fibre were not crucial for the hybrid effect, provided its failure strain is at least twice as high as the carbon fibre failure strain. Using very ductile polypropylene fibres instead of the traditional glass fibres hence does not lead to a larger hybrid effect in carbon fibre hybrid composites. The main advantage of polypropylene fibres is its potential of achieving a larger ultimate failure strain. The predictions of the hybrid effect were also compared to experimental measurements. This validation was {{the first of its kind}} to achieve a good agreement, which indicates that the model captures the main phenomena of the hybrid effect. Finally, a road map for optimising hybrid self-reinforced composites was set up by combining the experimental results with the modelling insights. This road map can also be used to optimise other hybrid self-reinforced composites. The presented results revealed the potential benefits of hybrid composites. They should provide a driving force for future work on hybrid composites and for improvements in processing technologies for manufacturing well-dispersed hybrid composites. status: publishe...|$|R

Purpose – There is a {{requirement}} to match selective laser melting (SLM) technologies to {{a wider range of}} polymeric materials, since the existing market for SLM powders is dominated by polyamide PA 12. Drivers include the tailoring of physical properties to individual applications, or cost reduction. Polypropylene (PP) currently has limited use in SLM, so the potential use of PP materials of varying molecular weight (Mw) is explored here. Design / methodology / approach – PP polymers of differing molecular weight were characterised using a range of analytical techniques, including DSC, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), rotational rheometry and real-time hot-stage (optical) microscopy. Findings – The techniques are sufficiently sensitive to distinguish molecular weight effects, notably in terms of material viscosity. The stable sintering region for SLM has been defined clearly. Some success was achieved in melting parts using some grades of PP, including higher molecular weight grades, which potentially offer improved mechanical performance.

The request for {{faster and more}} {{efficient}} chemical and biological analysis is the motivation behind {{the development of the}} LOC-concept. Microfluidic devices tend to become increasingly complex in order to include, e. g. sample delivery, manipulation, and detection, in one chip. The urge for smart and simple design of robust and low-cost microdevices is addressed and discussed. Design, fabrication and characterization of such microdevices have been demonstrated using low-cost polymer and glass microfabrication methods. The manufacturing is feasible, to a large extent, to perform outside the clean-room, and has subsequently been the chosen technique for most of the work.

40|$|A {{new concept}} is {{described}} that creates highly oriented multifunctional <b>polymer</b> nanocomposite <b>tapes</b> (or fibres) that combine high stiffness and strength with good electrical properties {{and a low}} percolation threshold of conductive nanofillers. The concept {{is based on a}} bicomponent construction consisting of a highly oriented polymer core together with conductive polymer composite skins based on a polymer with lower melting temperature than the core. This construction allows for a thermal annealing process that can be applied selectively to the skins to improve their conductivity through a kinetic re-aggregation process while retaining the mechanical properties of the core and hence those of the overall tape or fibre. In the current study this generic concept was applied to bicomponent tapes based on a polypropylene homopolymer core and a multi-wall carbon nanotube or carbon black filled polypropylene copolymer skin. The conductivity of the bicomponent tape containing 5. 3 wt. % of MWNTs in its outer skins increased from 1. 3 E- 6 to 1. 5 S/cm after annealing while the percolation threshold in the copolymer skins of highly drawn bicomponent tapes could be decreased from 5. 3 to 1. 1 wt. %. To the best of the authors’ knowledge this is the lowest percolation threshold reported in literature for highly drawn polymer nanocomposites fibres or tapes. In fact, the percolation threshold is as low as 0. 1 wt. % when considered on the overall tape as the conductive skins account for only 10 % of the total volume of these bicomponent tapes...|$|R
40|$|The {{review of}} {{selected}} methods of strengthening of steel structures with carbon fiber reinforced <b>polymer</b> (CFRP) <b>tapes</b> and {{the analysis of}} influence of composite materials on the steel thin-walled elements are performed in this paper. The study is also focused {{to the problem of}} applying fast and effective strengthening methods of the steel structures made of thin-walled profiles. It is worth noting that the issue of strengthening the thin-walled structures is a very complex, due to inability to perform welded joints in this type of elements and the limited ability to applying mechanical fasteners. Moreover, structures made of thin-walled cross-section demonstrate a high sensitivity to imperfections and tendency to interactive buckling, which may substantially contribute to the reduction of critical load capacity. Due to the lack of commonly used and recognized modern methods of strengthening of thin-walled steel structures, authors performed the experimental studies of thin-walled sigma profiles strengthened with CFRP tapes. The paper presents the experimental stand and the preliminary results of laboratory test concerning the analysis of the effectiveness of the strengthening steel beams made of thin-walled sigma profiles with CFRP tapes. The study includes six beams made of the cold-rolled sigma profiles with height of 140 mm, wall thickness of 2. 5 mm, and a length of 3 m, subjected to the uniformly distributed load. Four beams have been strengthened with carbon fiber tape Sika CarboDur S, while the other two were tested without strengthening to obtain reference results. Based on the obtained results, the evaluation of the accuracy of applied composite materials for strengthening of thin-walled structures was performed...|$|R
40|$|A {{new test}} method is {{presented}} {{for the purpose}} of investigating migration of a delamination between neighboring ply interfaces in fiber-reinforced, <b>polymer</b> matrix <b>tape</b> laminates. The test is a single cantilever beam configuration consisting of a cross-ply laminate with a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) insert implanted at the mid-plane and spanning part way {{along the length of the}} specimen. The insert is located between a 0 -degree ply (specimen length direction) and a stack of four 90 -degree plies (specimen width direction). The specimen is clamped at both ends onto a rigid baseplate and is loaded on its upper surface via a piano hinge. Tests were conducted with the load-application point located on the intact portion of the specimen in order to initiate delamination growth onset followed by migration of the delamination to a neighboring 90 / 0 ply interface by kinking through the 90 - degree ply stack. Varying this position was found to affect the distance relative to the load-application point at which migration initiated. In each specimen, migration initiated by a gradual transition of the delamination at the 0 / 90 interface into the 90 - degree ply stack. In contrast, transition of the kinked crack into the 90 / 0 interface was sudden. Fractography of the specimens indicated that delamination prior to migration was generally mixed mode-I/II. Inspection of the kink surface revealed mode-I fracture. In general, use of this test allows for the observation of the growth of a delamination followed by migration of the delamination to another ply interface, and should thus provide a means for validating analyses aimed at simulating migration...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the rheology and processing of solvent-free core shell ?polymer opals? that consist of a soft outer shell grafted to hard colloidal polymer core particles. Strong iridescent colours can be produced by shearing the material in a certain way that causes the initially disordered spheres to rearrange into ordered crystalline structures and produce colours by diffraction and interference of multiple light scattering, similar to gemstone opals. The basic linear viscoelastic rheology of a polymer opal sample was determined as a function of temperature and the material was found to be highly viscoelastic at all tested temperatures. A Cambridge Multipass Rheometer (MPR) was specifically modified in order to make controlled mechanical measurements of initially disordered <b>polymer</b> opal <b>tapes</b> that were sandwiched between protective PET sheets. Axial extension, simple shear and a novel ?edge shearing? geometry were all evaluated and multiple successive experiments of the edge shearing test were carried out at different temperatures. The optical development of colloidal ordering, measured as optical opalescence, was quantified by spectroscopy using visible backscattered light. The development of opalescence was found {{to be sensitive to the}} geometry of deformation and a number of process variables suggesting a complex interaction of parameters that caused the opalescence. In order to identify aspects of the deformation mechanism of the edge shearing experiment, a separate series of in situ optical experiments were carried out and this helped indicate the extent of simple shear generated with each edge shear deformation. The results show that strong ordering can be induced by successive edge shearing deformation. The results are relevant to polymer opal rheology, processing and mechanisms relating to ordering within complex viscoelastic fluids. authorsversionPeer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|The four {{trays of}} the M 0003 {{materials}} experiment on LDEF contained 1274 samples from 19 subexperiments. The complete sample complement represented {{a broad range}} of materials, including thin film optical coatings, paints, <b>polymer</b> sheets and <b>tapes,</b> adhesives, and composites, for use in various spacecraft applications including thermal control, structures, optics, and solar power. Since some subexperiments included duplicate samples exposed on the leading and trailing edge trays, for 9 week, 19 week, 40 week, and 68 month durations on both the leading and trailing edges, comparisons provided a valuable time history of degradation. During the deintegration of the subexperiments from the M 0003 trays, each sample was examined using bright field, dark field, and Normarski light microscopy techniques. Over 3, 000 color macrographs and photomicrographs were made of the condition of M 0003 trays and the individual samples. Records of the condition of the samples, photographic records, and all available references of publications on postflight analyses on each sample were collected in a database. The photographs provide a visual comparison of the response of materials common to various subexperiments in different LDEF environments. Aerospace Corporation is distributing the database records and photographs and written records on materials of interest from the database is given in this presentation...|$|R
40|$|The four trays (2 {{leading edge}} and 2 {{trailing}} edge) of the M 0003 materials experiment on the Long Duration Exposure Facility (LDEF) contained 1274 samples from 20 subexperiments. The complete sample complement represented {{a broad range}} of materials, including thin film optical coatings, paints, <b>polymer</b> sheets and <b>tapes,</b> adhesives, and composites, for use in various spacecraft applications, including thermal control, structures, optics, and solar power. Most subexperiments contained sets of samples exposed on both the leading and trailing edge trays of LDEF. Each individual sample was examined by high resolution optical microscope during the deintegration of the subexperiments from the M 0003 trays. Observations of the post-flight condition of the samples made during this examination were recorded in a computer data base. The deintegration observation data base is available to requesters on floppy disk in 4 th Dimension for the Macintosh format. Over 3, 000 color macrographs and photomicrographs were shot to complement the observation records and to document the condition of the individual samples and of the M 0003 trays. The photographs provide a visual comparison of the response of materials in leading and trailing edge LDEF environments. The Aerospace Corporate Archives is distributing photographs of the samples and hard copies of the database records to the general public upon request. Information on obtaining copies of the data base disks and for ordering photographs and records of specific samples or materials are given...|$|R
