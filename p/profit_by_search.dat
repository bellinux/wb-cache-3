40|$|In {{recent years}} we are {{witnessing}} a continuous growth {{in the amount of}} data that both public and private organizations collect and <b>profit</b> <b>by.</b> <b>Search</b> engines are the most common tools used to retrieve information, and more recently, clus-tering techniques showed to be an effective tool in helping users to skim query results. The majority of the systems proposed to manage information, provide textual interfaces to explore search results that are not specifically designed to provide an interactive experience to the users. Trying to find a solution to this problem, we focus on how to extract conveniently data from sources of interest, and how to enhance their analysis and consultation through visual-ization techniques. In this work we present a customizable framework able to acquire, search and interactively visualize data. This framework is built upon a modular architectural schema and its effectiveness will be illustrated by a proto-type implemented for a specific application domain...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the implications of}} local network externalities on market dynamics. The subjects of study are prices, welfare, segmentation of markets and firms' withdrawing from market. Additionally, the effect of varying levels of firm rationality to subject mentioned are studied. The methodology involved is that of agent-based computational economics. A computer model has been written to simulate the markets. In the model firms try to maximise their <b>profits</b> <b>by</b> <b>searching</b> for optimal pricing strategies. Since there are many firms involved, fictitious play had to be implemented to model interaction among firms. Consumers are located on toroidal lattice and consume goods according to probabilistic rules. This interplay between consumers and firms give rise to market dynamics which is then analysed. Markets are quite balanced, with no monopolisation taking place. In the long-run oligopolistic markets prevail. The prices are inversely correlated with number of firms on the market. Welfare depends on the preferences for network externality of consumers; if strong, markets with less number of firms are utility enhancing; if moderate, {{the increasing number of}} firms yields higher welfare. Exit of firms from the market is fast on the beginning, but slows afterwards. If consumers prefer for local network externality is strong, it results in less exits and more firms and goods at market. Profits are associated negatively with firm rationality. The less rational the firms, the faster they exit the market. It seems that model incorporating both profit maximising firms and consumers that are subject to local network externalities, has not been implemented before. The main finding of this thesis is that the markets that involve local network externalities are rather prosaic, and no monopolisation has been found. The stabilising factor seems to be the profit taking behaviour of firms, which in fact sustain the competitive market structure. References: E. Kutschinski, T. Uthmann and D.

60|$|The social theorists of Utopia, my double explained, did not {{base their}} schemes upon the {{classification}} of men into labour and capital, the landed interest, the liquor trade, and the like. They esteemed these as accidental categories, indefinitely amenable to statesmanship, and they looked for some practical and real classification upon which to base organisation. [Footnote: In {{that they seem to}} have <b>profited</b> <b>by</b> a more <b>searching</b> criticism of early social and political speculations than our earth has yet undertaken. The social speculations of the Greeks, for example, had just the same primary defect as the economic speculations of the eighteenth century--they began with the assumption that the general conditions of the prevalent state of affairs were permanent.] But, on the other hand, the assumption that men are unclassifiable, because practically homogeneous, which underlies modern democratic methods and all the fallacies of our equal justice, is even more alien to the Utopian mind. Throughout Utopia there is, of course, no other than provisional classifications, since every being is regarded as finally unique, but for political and social purposes things have long rested upon a classification of temperaments, which attends mainly to differences in the range and quality and character of the individual imagination.|$|R
40|$|Outsourcing of {{equipment}} repair and restoration is commonly practiced by firms in many industries. The operational performance {{of equipment}} {{is determined by}} joint decisions of the firm (client) and the service provider (vendor). Although some decisions are verifiable and thus directly contractible, many decisions are not. The result is a double-sided moral hazard environment in which each party has incentives to free ride on the other's effort. A performance-based contract allows the client to align the incentives of the vendor, but it also exposes the vendor to stochastic earnings and thereby creates disincentives to make first-best decisions. To capture these issues, we develop a novel principal-agent model by integrating elements of the machine repairman model and a stochastic financial distress model within the double-sided moral hazard framework. We apply our model to solve the client's problem of designing the optimal performance-based contract. We find that the client can attain the first-best <b>profit</b> <b>by</b> restricting the <b>search</b> space to only two classes of performance-based contract structures: linear and tiered. We show that the linear contract structure has limited ability in attaining the first-best outcome, contingent on the vendor's exogenous characteristics. In contrast, the tiered contract structure enables the client to attain the first-best outcome regardless of vendor characteristics. Our results provide normative insights {{on the role of}} contract structures in eliminating any loss due to double-sided moral hazard or to the vendor's financial concerns. These results also provide theoretical support for the extensive use of tiered contracts observed in practice...|$|R
