50|$|However, this drop in {{fertility}} rates is not immediate. The lag between produces a generational population bulge that surges through society. For {{a period of}} time this “bulge” is a burden on society and increases the dependency ratio. Eventually this group begins to enter the productive labor force. With {{fertility rates}} continuing to fall and older generations having shorter life expectancies, the dependency ratio declines dramatically. This demographic shift initiates the demographic dividend. With fewer younger dependents, due to declining fertility and child mortality rates, and fewer older dependents, due to the older generations having shorter life expectancies, and the largest segment of the population of productive working age, the dependency ratio declines dramatically leading to the demographic dividend. Combined with effective public policies this time period of the demographic dividend can help facilitate more rapid economic growth and puts less strain on families. This is also a time period when many women enter the labor force for the first time. In many countries this time period has led to increasingly smaller families, rising income, and rising life expectancy rates. However, dramatic social changes can also occur during this time, such as increasing divorce rates, <b>postponement</b> <b>of</b> <b>marriage,</b> and single-person households.|$|E

40|$|The {{notion of}} two {{distinct}} phases {{in the overall}} demographic transition in the West was originally suggested by Lesthaeghe and van de Kaa (1986) and by van de Kaa (1987), and these authors {{are responsible for the}} terminology of a first (FDT) and a second (SDT) demographic transition. The initial 1986 article on the SDT posited that new living arrangements, and cohabitation (pre-marital or post-marital) in particular, were not solely the outcomes of changing socio-economic conditions or rising female employment, but equally the expression of secular and anti-authoritarian sentiments of better educated cohorts, men and women alike, with an egalitarian world view, a greater emphasis on Maslow’s (1954) “higher order needs ” (i. e. self-actualization, individualistic and expressive orientations, need for recognition) and, to use Inglehart’s term (1970, 1990), with stronger “post-materialist ” political orientations. Furthermore, the SDT would also be characterized by substantial <b>postponement</b> <b>of</b> both <b>marriage</b> and parenthood, and by an increase in the share of births born to unmarried couples. If fertility control during the FDT was a matter of avoiding births of higher parities and occurring at older ages in order to safeguard the opportunities of the already born children, during the SDT {{it is a matter of}} postponing parenthood in function of more pressing competing goals such as prolonging education, achieving more stable income positions, increased consumerism associated with self-expressive orientations, finding a suitable companion and realizing a more fulfilled partnership, keeping an open future, etc. (see also Ph. Ariès, 1980). At the aggregate level <b>postponement</b> <b>of</b> fertility would not only lead to a temporary dip of fertility below replacement level, but to structural, long term sub-replacement cohort fertility as well. This in its turn creates a growing need for “replacement migration”, so that the SDT will be directly connected to the further development of western societies i...|$|R

40|$|A {{remarkable}} {{feature of}} English demographic {{history is the}} explosion in childbearing outside marriage during {{the last quarter of}} the twentieth century, after 400 years of relative stability. Over the period 1845 - 1960, the percentage <b>of</b> births outside <b>marriage</b> moved within a small range, averaging about 5 %. The paper finds that, up to the First World War, higher unemployment discouraged marriage and increased non-marital births, with a recovery in marriages in the subsequent year. This pattern is consistent with poorer labour market conditions discouraging marriages among pregnant would-be brides, thereby increasing bastardy. During the inter-war period, higher unemployment continued to produce <b>postponement</b> <b>of</b> <b>marriages,</b> but non-marital childbearing was no longer linked to unemployment, nor is there a clear link to unemployment in the post-war period. After 1960, when the contraceptive pill was introduced, childbearing outside marriage began to climb slowly, and it exploded after 1980, reaching 42 % in 2004. This was partly driven by a steep increase in the age-specific non-marital births rates of women aged 20 - 34 from the mid- 1970 s to the early 1990 s, after which they stabilised at a high level. At fixed average non-marital and marital agespecific birth rates, this increase in the proportion <b>of</b> births outside <b>marriage</b> can be mainly accounted for by a large fall in the proportion of women aged 20 - 34 who are married, which is in turn associated with a dramatic rise in cohabiting unions. These unions are short-lived before either dissolving or being converted into marriage. But this begs the question: why didn’t average non-marital fertility rates fall when more women cohabited? Women had the means (contraception and legal abortion) to avoid nonmarital childbearing if they wanted to do so, and so the substitution of cohabiting unions for marriages need not have raised non-marital fertility. A theory <b>of</b> <b>marriage</b> market search (courtship) in which out-of-wedlock childbearing is an option suggests why it may be a rational choice, even when fertility can be controlled. A woman’s welfare as a single mother is likely to be influenced by the prevalence of single mothers in the population, which may reflect social stigma against single mothers. When their prevalence is low, nonmarital childbearing is discouraged. A temporary change in the determinants of non-marital childbearing that raises it, like the large rise in unemployment in the late 1970 s/early 1980 s, can produce rapid erosion of the stigma and a self-reinforcing rise in childbearing outside marriage. This dynamic is likely to be concentrated among a segment of the population who already had stronger incentives to have a child before marriage. If this social influence model is valid, then it is likely to be the case that socio-economic differences in the chances of having a child before marriage widen as childbearing outside marriage becomes more common, and the paper provides evidence that this has happened. An alternative, or complementary, explanation stresses the role of the rise in cohabiting unions and delay in partnership. These generated an increase in non-marital births by increasing the unmarried opulation. This view also points to the operation of a social influence model in explaining the dramatic rise in cohabitation, and the paper provides evidence of a diffusion of cohabiting unions from the better educated to the less educated population. ...|$|R
