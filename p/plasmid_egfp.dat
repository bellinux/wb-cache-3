However, therapy with pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL- 12, {{is limited in}} practice due to adverse systemic effects. Spatially-restricted gene expression circumvents this problem by enabling localized amplification. Intracellular co-delivery of gold nanorods (AuNR) and a heat shock protein 70 (HSP 70) promoter-driven expression vector enables gene expression in response to near infrared (NIR) light. AuNRs absorb the light, convert it into heat and thereby stimulate photothermal expression of the cytokine.

We have developed a new device combining local pressure ejection with local electroporation through a double-barrelled glass micropipette to transfer impermeable macromolecules in brain slices or in cultured HEK 293 cells. The design achieves better targeting of the site of pressure ejection with that of electroporation. With this technique, {{we have been able to}} limit the delivery of propidium iodide or dextran amine within areas of 100 – 200 μm diameter. We confirm that local electroporation is transient and show that when combined with pressure ejection, it allows local transfection of <b>EGFP</b> <b>plasmids</b> within HEK 293 cells or within cerebellar and hippocampal slice cultures. We further show that local electroporation is less damaging when compared to global electroporation using two separate electrodes. Focal delivery of dextran amine dyes within trapezoid body fibres allowed tracing axonal tracts within brainstem slices, enabling the study of identified calyx of Held presynaptic terminals in living brain tissue.

40|$|Objectives Murine {{norovirus}} (MuNoV) {{belongs to}} the family Caliciviridae, genus Norovirus and is currently used as study model for human noroviruses, major aetiologic agents of gastroenteritis worldwide. Myxovirus (Mx) protein is an interferon-induced protein that host cell can oppose virus infection and was detected in several species including human being. In mice, two genes encoding Mx 1 and 2 proteins are present but it was evidenced that these genes were inactivated by deletions in several laboratory mouse strains. Mx antiviral activity was detected on several negative stranded RNA viruses but information are still lacking for most of positive stranded RNA viruses. In this study, the susceptibility of the MuNoV to specific and interspecific Mx proteins was investigated. Methods RAW 264. 7 cells (murine macrophages) were first tested for constitutive expression of Mx 1 proteins. Plasmids containing the murine Mx 1, bovine Mx 1 and human MxA genes under the CMV immediate early promotor were then used to transfect RAW 264. 7 cells for transient Mx expression. Negative control consisted in a <b>plasmid</b> expressing <b>eGFP.</b> Four hours after transfection, cells were infected at low MOI with the CW 1 MuNoV strain. Cells and supernatants were harvested 24 h post infection. RNA was extracted and viral genomic copies were measured by real time RT-PCR. Results An effect was confirmed on CW 1 replication for both specific and interspecific Mx proteins. The highest effect was obtained with the bovine Mx 1 protein. Conclusion In conclusion, we showed in these preliminary in vitro studies the MuNoV susceptibility to specific and interspecific Mx proteins. Bovine Mx 1 protein was already demonstrated to have important antiviral activity on negative stranded RNA viruses (influenza- and paramyxoviruses) and co-evolution with the host could explain a higher susceptibility to interspecific Mx proteins. Important implications of this adaptation could be expected on zoonotic concerns associated to NoV. Moreover, even if several control studies are still be conducted to validate these preliminary results, they could drive several pertaining questions on the MuNoV model used with laboratory mice. Perspectives of this work consist to validate the susceptibility in vivo and also to test the murine Mx 2 antiviral activity on MuNoV. Peer reviewe...|$|R

In contrast, nucleofection, an electroporation-based method that is assumed to target plasmid DNA directly to the cell nucleus, led to a significant transient transgene expression in hMADS cells (up to 76 % enhanced green fluorescent protein [EGFP]-positive cells were detected). Furthermore, after selection of hMADS cells that were nucleofected with a selectable <b>plasmid</b> coding for <b>EGFP,</b> stable EGFP expressing clones could be propagated in culture and efficiently induced to differentiate into EGFP-positive adipocytes and osteoblasts. Finally, we verified that nucleofected hMADS cells could produce a functional, transgene-encoded, secreted protein. To this aim, hMADS cells were nucleofected with a plasmid coding for leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). This protein was detected at high concentrations in supernatants from pCAG-LIF transfected hMADS cells. Moreover, supernatants were able to maintain mouse embryonic stem cells' undifferentiated phenotype, indicating that hMADS cells could secrete a functional LIF protein. Taken together, our data demonstrate that nucleofection allows both transient and stable gene expression in adipose tissue-derived stem cells, without impairing their differentiation potential...|$|R
40|$|The powdery mildews are obligate biotrophic {{pathogens}} {{that depend}} on living plant cells to complete its life cycle. These pathogens develop a specialized structure called haustorium that serves for nutrient uptake and exchange of factors with the plant. Thus, great interest {{has been focused on}} understanding how they are assembled and how they mediate fungus-plant communication. A bottleneck in these studies is the difficulty to manipulate genetically this group of fungi, and indeed transformation of powdery mildew fungi remains elusive to researchers. In this work, we show the genetic manipulation of the cucurbit powdery mildew pathogen Podosphaera fusca using Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. Using this method, we obtained stable transformants for a variety of constructs: i) a <b>plasmid</b> expressing the <b>egfp</b> gene under the control of a constitutive promoter from Aspergilus nidulans, ii) plasmids expressing the hygromycin resistance cassette or a β-tubulin allele that confers resistance to carbendazim, a MBC fungicide. Moreover, we performed fluorescence microscopy studies with a translational fusion of CSEP 5191, a candidate effector of P. fusca, fused to GFP, and found how this candidate effector is localized into large vesicles of the haustorium. These results support the feasibility of this transformation method to manipulate genetically P. fusca and open the possibility to be used with other powdery mildews.

40|$|In {{this study}} we {{describe}} a novel polymer, mPPS-FA, synthesized as a potential gene transfer vector. To complete mPPS-FA, folic acid was conjugated to a backbone (named mPPS) consisting of a copolymer of methyl PEG- 2000, PEI- 600, and sebacoyl chloride. 1 H NMR, FT-IR, and UV spectroscopy were used to characterize the structure of mPPS-FA. It was revealed that mPPS-FA holds the ability to bind plasmid DNA yielding positively charged particles (polyplexes). Dynamic light scattering (DLS) and TEM techniques were used to study the size and morphology of the formed mPPS-FA/DNA nanocomplexes. The mPPS-FA/DNA nanoparticles exhibited low cytotoxicity as transfection of B 16 -F 0, U 87 MG, CHO- 1, and Ho- 8910 cells produced > 80 % viability indicating low cytotoxicity of the polymer. The ability of mPPS-FA to deliver <b>EGFP</b> <b>plasmid</b> to melanoma B 16 -F 0, U 87, CHO- 1, Ho- 8910, and A 549 cells was investigated in vitro {{as compared to the}} lipid-based transfection agent Lipofectamine™ 2000 and Linear PEI 22 kDa (L-PEI 22 kDa). We found that mPPS-FA/DNA complexes yielded the highest GFP transfection efficiency in B 16 -F 0, U 87, CHO- 1, and Ho- 8910 cells, which all highly express folate receptors (FR), at an mPPS-FA/DNA ratio (w/w) of 15. Furthermore, the transfection of mPPS-FA/DNA complexes in CHO- 1 cells could be competitively blocked by free folic acid molecules. In contrast, in low FR expressing A 549 cells, mPPS-FA showed similar low transfection efficiency as mPPS. Taken together, mPPS-FA showed the highest efficiency in vitro and the potential to be developed as a nonviral gene carrier. © 2012 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|In the {{peripheral}} nervous system the myelin sheath is produced by the spiral wrappings of the Schwann cell (SC) membrane around the axon. This provides insulation and increases the velocity of impulse propagation. The structure of myelin is maintained {{by a group of}} myelin proteins. Peripheral myelin protein- 22 (PMP- 22) is a 22 KDa glycoprotein, originally identified following nerve crush injury, that is found within SCs and is identical to the growth arrest specific protein GAS- 3. The PMP- 22 gene is regulated by two alternative promoters immediately upstream of two alternative non-coding exons. In order to study temporal and spatial expression of the PMP- 22 gene and regulation of SC ensheathment and myelination, a transgenic mouse expressing the green fluorescent protein (GFP) driven by the myelin specific PMP- 22 promoter was produced. To achieve this the PI promoter isolated from genomic DNA was initially incorporated into a <b>plasmid</b> containing the <b>EGFP</b> gene. In vitro transfection studies demonstrated appropriate expression of EGFP fluorescence. Microinjection of the transgene into pre- implantation fertilised embryos gave rise to three transgenic lines as confirmed by Southern blot and PGR. One founder expressed the transgene in a tissue specific manner. Mosaicism of expression both within an individual and between individuals was noted. In vitro manipulations showed that the expression patterns observed were independent of axonal contact and myelination but could be influenced by the extracellular matrix. These GFP expressing transgenic mice potentially provide a means to determine the dynamics of SC-axon interactions during myelination and the behaviour of transplanted SCs into myelin deficient regions and the SCs response to injury.

40|$|Abstract Background Recombinant protein {{expression}} in mammalian cells is mostly achieved by stable integration of transgenes into the chromosomal DNA of established cell lines. The chromosomal surroundings have strong {{influences on the}} expression of transgenes. The exploitation of defined loci by targeting expression constructs with different regulatory elements is an approach to design high level expression systems. Further, this allows to evaluate the impact of chromosomal surroundings on distinct vector constructs. Results We explored antibody expression upon targeting diverse expression constructs into previously tagged loci in CHO-K 1 and HEK 293 cells that exhibit high reporter gene expression. These loci were selected by random transfer of reporter cassettes and subsequent screening. Both, retroviral infection and <b>plasmid</b> transfection with <b>eGFP</b> or antibody expression cassettes were employed for tagging. The tagged cell clones were screened for expression and single copy integration. Cell clones producing > 20 pg/cell in 24 hours could be identified. Selected integration sites that had been flanked with heterologous recombinase target sites (FRTs) were targeted by Flp recombinase mediated cassette exchange (RMCE). The results give proof of principle for consistent protein expression upon RMCE. Upon targeting antibody expression cassettes 90 - 100 % of all resulting cell clones showed correct integration. Antibody production {{was found to be}} highly consistent within the individual cell clones as expected from their isogenic nature. However, the nature and orientation of expression control elements revealed to be critical. The impact of different promoters was examined with the tag-and-targeting approach. For each of the chosen promoters high expression sites were identified. However, each site supported the chosen promoters to a different extent, indicating that the strength of a particular promoter is dominantly defined by its chromosomal context. Conclusion RMCE provides a powerful method to specifically design vectors for optimized gene expression with high accuracy. Upon considering the specific requirements of chromosomal sites this method provides a unique tool to exploit such sites for predictable expression of biotechnologically relevant proteins such as antibodies. </p...|$|R
40|$|Studies {{were carried}} out {{on the use of}} piggyBac transposable element as vector and the green {{fluorescent}} protein (EGFP) from the jellyfish, Aquorea victoria, as a genetic marker for the transformation of Drosophila willistoni. Preblastoderm embryos of D. willistoni white mutant were microinjected with a <b>plasmid</b> containing the <b>EGFP</b> marker and the piggyBac ITRs, together with a helper plasmid containing the piggyBac transposase placed {{under the control of the}} D. melanogaster hsp 70 promoter. G 0 adults transformants were recovered at a frequency of approximately 67 %. Expression of EGFP in larvae, pupae and adults was observed up to the third generation, suggesting that this transposon was not stable in D. willistoni. Transformed individuals displayed high levels of EGFP expression during larvae and adult stages in the eye, abdomen, thorax and legs, suggesting a wide expression pattern in this species than reported to other species of Drosophilidae. Descrevemos neste trabalho a transformação genética de Drosophila willistoni empregando o elemento transponível piggyBac como vetor e o gene EGFP (green fluorescent protein) retirado da água-viva Aquorea victoria, como marcador de transformação. Embriões de D. willistoni em estágio pré-blastoderme, mutantes para o gene white, foram microinjetados com plasmídio contendo o marcador EGFP e as regiões ITRs do transposon piggyBac concomitantemente com um plasmídio auxiliar possuindo o gene da transposase de piggyBac sobre o controle do promotor do gene hsp 70 de Drosophila melanogaster. Adultos transformantes Go foram gerados em uma taxa de 67 %. A expressão de GFP em larvas, pupas e adultos foi observada somente até a terceira geração, sugerindo que este transposon não é estável em D. willistoni. Os indivíduos transformados exigem um alto nível de expressão de EGFP durante os estágios de larva e, também em adultos o gene marcador é expresso nos olhos, abdome, tórax e patas, mostrando um padrão de expressão mais amplo nesta espécie do que o registrado para outros drosofilídeos...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Hepatitis B virus (HBV) {{infection}} {{is a major}} health concern with more than two billion individuals currently infected worldwide. Because of the limited effectiveness of existing vaccines and drugs, development of novel antiviral strategies is urgently needed. Heat stress cognate 70 (Hsc 70) is an ATP-binding protein of the heat stress protein 70 family. Hsc 70 {{has been found to}} be required for HBV DNA replication. Here we report, for the first time, that combined siRNAs targeting viral gene and siHsc 70 are highly effective in suppressing ongoing HBV expression and replication. Methods We constructed two plasmids (S 1 and S 2) expressing short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) targeting surface open reading frame of HBV(HBVS) and one plasmid expressing shRNA targeting Hsc 70 (siHsc 70), and we used the EGFP-specific siRNA plasmid (siEGFP) as we had previously described. First, we evaluated the gene-silencing efficacy of both shRNAs using an enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) reporter system and flow cytometry in HEK 293 and T 98 G cells. Then, the antiviral potencies of HBV-specific siRNA (siHBV) in combination with siHsc 70 in HepG 2. 2. 15 cells were investigated. Moreover, type I IFN and TNF-α induction were measured by quantitative real-time PCR and ELISA. Results Cotransfection of either S 1 or S 2 with an <b>EGFP</b> <b>plasmid</b> produced an 80 %– 90 % reduction in EGFP signal relative to the control. This combinational RNAi effectively and specifically inhibited HBV protein, mRNA and HBV DNA, resulting in up to a 3. 36 log 10 reduction in HBV load in the HepG 2. 2. 15 cell culture supernatants. The combined siRNAs were more potent than siHBV or siHsc 70 used separately, and this approach can enhance potency in suppressing ongoing viral gene expression and replication in HepG 2. 2. 15 cells while forestalling escape by mutant HBV. The antiviral synergy of siHBV used in combination with siHsc 70 produced no cytotoxicity and induced no production of IFN-α, IFN-β and TNF-α in transfected cells. Conclusions Our combinational RNAi was sequence-specific, effective against wild-type and mutant drug-resistant HBV strains, without triggering interferon response or producing any side effects. These findings indicate that combinational RNAi has tremendous promise for developing innovative therapy against viral infection. </p...|$|R
40|$|Cadmium (Cd) {{may induce}} renal {{toxicity}} by modifying {{the activity of}} oxidative stress sensitive transcription factors {{that are responsible for}} regulating apoptotic gene expression and the genes that modulate the cell cycle. The present study was designed to elucidate the involvement of two such transcription factors, NF-κB and p 53, in Cd-induced apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. ^ Cells from a normal rat kidney epithelial cell line, NRK- 52 E, were incubated with CdCl 2 for 5 h and maintained in Cd-free medium for an additional 12 h. The DNA binding activity of NF-κB was decreased by Cd in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. Pretreatment of the cells with antioxidants, U 8386 E or BHT, preserved NF-κB activity. Cd treatment also decreased the activity of TNF-α-induced IκB kinase α. Phosphorylation of IκBα and NF-κB p 65 were reduced by Cd as well. Furthermore, Cd exposure resulted in a decline in protein level of the NF-κB target gene products, cIAP- 1 and cIAP- 2. Consequently, caspase- 3, - 7 and - 9 were activated and the cells exhibited apoptotic DNA fragmentation. Overexpression of NF-κB-p 65 by transfection of NF-κB-p 65 <b>EGFP</b> <b>plasmid</b> protected the cells from Cd-induced apoptosis. Moreover, attenuation of NF-κB activity by pretreatment with SN 50, a NF-κB translocation inhibitor, potentiated the apoptosis. These results suggested that in the NRK 52 E cells NF-κB {{plays an important role in}} Cd-induced apoptosis. ^ NRK- 52 E cells were treated for up to 24 h with CdCl 2 in DMEM containing 10 % calf serum. Flowcytometric analysis revealed a significant time- and concentration-dependent increase in cells in G 2 /M cell cycle phase. Treatment with 20 μM Cd for 24 h doubled the number of cells in this phase. The cell cycle arrest was related to the decrease in cyclins A and B. Additionally, Cd treatment led to down-modulation of cyclin-dependent kinases, cdk 2 and Cdc 2. Cd also elevated the expression of cyclin-specific inhibitor KIP 1 /p 27 and WAF 1 /p 21. Moreover, wild type p 53 DNA binding activity was up-regulated upon Cd exposure. These observations suggest that Cd-induced cell cycle dysregulation is mediated via modulation of cyclin inhibitor, cyclin and Cdk machinery, and that this process appears to be p 53 -dependent. ...|$|R
40|$|Vaccines {{have been}} vital {{candidate}} against infectious diseases, {{and over the}} past one hundred years have saved millions of lives. The main types of vaccines available to date are subunit, live attenuated, inactivated, conjugate, toxoid and recombinant DNA based vaccines (Tiwle 2014). While effective, each has their own inherent limitations. For example, subunit vaccines cannot induce long term immunity, whereas live, attenuated and inactivated vaccines can have a limited target range (Abhishek et al., 2016). High production costs make recombinant vector based vaccines unavailable to poor economies (Nascimento et al., 2012). Toxoid vaccines need multiple doses with adjuvants and also cause strong local reactions (Baxter 2007). Even though DNA vaccines have the disadvantage of being limited to protein antigens, they offer long term immunity inducing all arms of the immune responses (Khan 2013). Most DNA vaccines are effective in eliciting immune responses without any side effects. The main criterion for a successful DNA vaccine is to have an efficient delivery system which can deliver it safely to the target cells. There are several successful delivery systems available for DNA vaccines; however no standard system is in place. For vaccine trials and effective DNA vaccination, targeting antigen presenting cells would be important. There is an increasing demand for novel DNA vaccine delivery systems, mainly for the non-viral type as they are considered relatively safe. Therefore, in this proof of concept study two novel delivery systems 1) Solid Lipid Nanoparticles (SLNs) and 2) yeast transposon virus like particles (Ty-VLPs) were chosen to study their potential to carry DNA vaccines in vitro to dendritic cells using <b>eGFP</b> <b>plasmid</b> as the reporter plasmid. Positively charged SLNs were synthesised by modified solvent-emulsification method and conjugated with plasmid DNA to form complexes (DNA-SLN complexes). The integrity of these complexes was confirmed by various agarose gel based assays. The SLN/DNA complexes were transfected into DC 2. 4 cells and analysed by flow cytometry for GFP expression. It was shown that there is a 10 -fold increase in the transfection rate using these complexes in DC 2. 4 cells over plasmid alone and is comparable to that mediated by lipofectamine. On the other hand, Ty-VLPs were purified from the recombinant yeast constructed and plasmid DNA conjugated with them. The transfection efficiency of these complexes were analysed in vitro and was shown to increase compared to plasmid alone. In comparison the SLN system was more efficient for plasmid DNA delivery than Ty-VLPs...|$|R
