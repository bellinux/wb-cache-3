6000|$|Yaqui <b>put</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> Gale's knee. It was a bronzed, scarred, {{powerful}} hand, always eloquent of meaning. The Indian was listening. His bent head, {{his strange}} dilating eyes, his rigid form, and that close-pressing hand, how these {{brought back to}} Gale the terrible lonely night hours on the lava! ...|$|R
60|$|Roy Beeman <b>put</b> <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> Dale's shoulder. He, perhaps, was the keenest of the {{brothers}} and the one to whom adventure and peril called most.
