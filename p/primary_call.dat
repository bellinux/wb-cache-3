5000|$|The {{system is}} a dynamic layered {{response}} system. An EMS response to an emergency begins with a telephone call to 9-1-1. Calls are transferred from a <b>primary</b> <b>call</b> taker to emergency medical call taker who gathers information from the caller, gives instructions to the caller, and determines what types of emergency personnel to send. For very serious and life-threatening emergencies firefighters trained in basic life support and paramedics trained in advanced life support respond simultaneously. Paramedics transport patients in critical condition. For less severe emergencies only firefighters will be dispatched. Basic life support personnel from either a fire department or private ambulance company transport non-critical patients.|$|E

50|$|In principle, event {{notifications}} may be sent {{to different}} Call Agents for each endpoint on the gateway (as programmed by the Call Agents, by setting the NotifiedEntity parameter). In practice, however, it is usually desirable that {{at any given moment}} all endpoints on a gateway should be controlled by the same Call Agent; other Call Agents are available only to provide redundancy in the event that the <b>primary</b> <b>Call</b> Agent fails, or loses contact with the media gateway. In the event of such a failure it is the backup Call Agent's responsibility to reprogram the MG so that the gateway comes {{under the control of the}} backup Call Agent. Care is needed in such cases; two Call Agents may know that they have lost contact with one another, but this does not guarantee that they are not both attempting to control the same gateway. The ability to audit the gateway to determine which Call Agent is currently controlling can be used to resolve such conflicts.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} a single server retrial queue with {{a finite number}} of {{heterogeneous}} sources of calls is investigated. It is assumed when a given source is idle it will generate a <b>primary</b> <b>call</b> after an exponentially distributed time. If the server is free {{at the time of the}} request’s arrival then the call starts to be served. The service time is also exponentially distributed. During the service time the source cannot generate a new <b>primary</b> <b>call.</b> After service the source moves into free state and can generate a new call again. If the server is busy at the time of the arrival of a <b>primary</b> <b>call,</b> then the source starts generating so called repeated calls with exponentially distributed times until it finds the server free. As before, after service the source becomes free and can generate a new <b>primary</b> <b>call</b> again. We assume that the primary calls, repeated attempts and service times are mutually independent. This queueing system and its variants could be used to model magnetic disk memory systems, local area networks with CSMA/CD protocols and collision avoidance local area networks and could contribute as a building block for larger heterogeneous networks. The novelty of this model is the heterogeneity of the calls, which means that each call is characterized by its own arrival, repeated and service rates. The aim of the paper is to give the usual steady-state performance measures of the system. To do so, an efficient software tool, MOSEL (Modeling, Specification and Evaluation Language) developed at the University of Erlangen, Germany, is used to formulate and solve the problem. Several sample numerical results illustrate the power of the tool showing the effect of different parameters on the system’s measures...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—We {{analyze the}} {{performance}} of a cognitive radio wireless network, where secondary users opportunistically share the radio spectrum with primary users through spectrum sensing and may cause service degradation to the primary users due to unreliable spectrum sensing. When a secondary user occupying a channel detects the presence of a <b>primary</b> <b>call</b> arriving to the channel, it switches from its current channel to another channel, if one is available, to continue its service; however, if the secondary user fails to detect the presence of the <b>primary</b> <b>call,</b> it remains on the channel and both calls will receive degraded service. Based on a queueing network model, we derive closed-form solutions for the equilibrium system state in terms of generating functions, and derive several performance metrics of interest. In particular, we introduce the system supportability metric to evaluate {{the extent to which the}} system can support secondary users and the interference factor to evaluate the degree of service degradation imposed on primary users by the secondary users. Numerical results are presented to show the impact of system parameters on the derived performance metrics. I...|$|E

40|$|To {{investigate}} the potential expression of territorial behavior of Burrowing Owls (Athene cunicularia) in southwestern Idaho, {{we used a}} playback protocol to determine if Burrowing Owls actively defended their nesting site from conspecifics, and if so, {{to determine the extent}} of their territorial boundaries. Eighty-eight percent of male Burrowing Owls responded to the broadcast of conspecific <b>primary</b> <b>calls.</b> All responsive males uttered <b>primary</b> <b>calls,</b> and many owls approached the broadcast speaker, exhibited white-and-tall stances, and bobbed. Females responded less frequently than males, but one female whose mate was presumably dead exhibited an intense response to the playback trial. There were no differences in number of <b>primary</b> <b>calls</b> uttered, number of white-and-tall stances performed, or number of bobs of focal males among three broadcast distances: (0 m, 50 m, and 100 m) from the active nest burrows. However, focal owls approached the broadcast speaker more closely at broadcast distances of 0 m and 50 m than at 100 m. These findings suggest that owls actively defended their nesting site from conspecifics and that they defended an area larger than that immediately surrounding the nest burrow. Although they continued to vocalize at distances of at least 100 m, they did not physically approach an intruder at this distance as frequently as at shorter distances. Therefore, Burrowing Owls appear to defend a territory that encompasses some, but not all, of the foraging area used during nesting...|$|R
