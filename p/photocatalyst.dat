5|$|Titanium was {{discovered}} in Cornwall, Great Britain, by William Gregor in 1791, and was named by Martin Heinrich Klaproth for the Titans of Greek mythology. The element occurs within a number of mineral deposits, principally rutile and ilmenite, which are widely distributed in the Earth's crust and lithosphere, and it is found in almost all living things, water bodies, rocks, and soils. The metal is extracted from its principal mineral ores by the Kroll and Hunter processes. The most common compound, titanium dioxide, is a popular <b>photocatalyst</b> and {{is used in the}} manufacture of white pigments. Other compounds include titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4), a component of smoke screens and catalysts; and titanium trichloride (TiCl3), which is used as a catalyst in the production of polypropylene.|$|E

The latter {{is one of the most}} popular inorganic <b>photocatalyst</b> for decomposition of phenol, various dyes and other waste water contaminants. The catalytic action of titanium oxide has to be activated by UV light, i.e. artificial illumination. However, modifying titanium oxide with neodymium(III) chloride allows catalysis under visible illumination, such as sun light. The modified catalyst is prepared by chemical coprecipitation–peptization method by ammonium hydroxide from mixture of TiCl4 and NdCl3 in aqueous solution). This process is used commercially on large scale on 1000 liter reactor for using in photocatalytic self-cleaning paints.|$|E

A heterogeneous <b>photocatalyst</b> is a material that uses absorbed light energy (usually UV) to drive desired reactions that would not otherwise proceed under ambient conditions. Commercial photocatalytic products, which include: architectural glass, tiles, concrete, paint and fabrics. are marketed on their ability to clean their own surfaces (i.e. are self-cleaning) and the ambient air.
