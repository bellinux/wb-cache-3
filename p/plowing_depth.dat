2500|$|The {{mouldboard}} is {{that part}} of the plough which receives the furrow slice from the share. The mouldboard is responsible for lifting and turning the furrow slice and sometimes for shattering it, {{depending on the type of}} moldboard, <b>plowing</b> <b>depth,</b> and soil conditions. The intensity of this action depends on the type of the moldboard. [...] To suit different soil conditions and crop requirements, mouldboards have been designed in different shapes, each producing its own furrow profile and surface finish, but they still basically conform to the original plough body classification. Traditionally, the various types of plough body have been classified as general purpose, digger, and semi-digger, as described below.|$|E

40|$|Problem statement: Tillage is {{a process}} of {{creating}} a desirable soil condition for seed germination and growth. The tillage of soil is considered {{to be one of the}} biggest farm operations as the tillage operation requires the most energy on the farm. Chisel plow is widely used by farmers as a primary tillage tool. Performance data for chisel plow operation is essential in order to reduce the cost of tillage operation. Approach: Field experiments were conducted using a fully instrumented MS 3090 tractor to measure the draft of a heavy duty chisel plow in a sandy soil over wide ranges of plowing depths and forward speeds. The data were measured and recorded using an instrumentation system and data logger. Results: The effects of <b>plowing</b> <b>depth</b> and forward speeds on draft, unit draft, vertical specific draft, horizontal specific draft and coefficient of pull were evaluated. The results indicated that increasing the <b>plowing</b> <b>depth</b> and/or the forward speed increased the draft, unit draft and vertical specific draft. Also, increasing the <b>plowing</b> <b>depth</b> increased the horizontal specific draft and the coefficient of pull, while increasing the forward speed decreased the horizontal specific draft and the coefficient of pull. Conclusion: About 16. 6 % of the draft force was directed towards cutting the soil and 83. 4 % was consumed in pulverization of soil particles. The values of the vertical specific draft were much higher than those of the horizontal specific draft for all plowing depths and forward speeds. The <b>plowing</b> <b>depth</b> had more pronounced effect on the draft, unit draft, specific draft and coefficient of pull than the forward speed. The optimum forward speed was 1. 75 m sec - 1.

The experimental design was a randomized complete block design with a 3 × 3 factorial. Except in soil inversion, the effect of soil moisture {{on all of the}} performance parameters mentioned, was highly significant. Mean values of draft, specific draft and drawbar power requirements and clod mean weight diameter were minimized at 13 - 15 % and 16 - 18 % soil moisture contents, respectively. The effect of <b>plowing</b> <b>depth</b> was highly significant only on draft and drawbar power requirement of disk plow, {{in such a way that}} the mean values of these two parameters were significantly increased with <b>plowing</b> <b>depth,</b> while specific draft showed only a mild decreasing trend. In order to provide a quantitative index to express the degree of soil pulverization by tillage implements, a tractor-pulled rotary sieve was designed and fabricated. With this apparatus, in-field determination of soil clod mean weight diameter (MWD) following plowing was possible. The results showed that the effect of soil moisture content on MWD was highly significant, such that, plowing at 10 - 12 % moisture content produced the largest clods, whereas the effect of <b>plowing</b> <b>depth</b> on MWD was not significant. The decreasing trend of MWD with soil moisture content persisted to the highest moisture level studied (16 - 18 %), in which the average clod MWD (33. 8 mm) was about 72 % smaller than those formed at 10 - 12 % moisture content.

Field experiments were {{conducted at the}} Experimental Station, College of Agriculture, Shiraz University, using a randomized complete block design with a 3 * 3 factorial. The soil was sandy clay loam with an average moisture content of 18 % b. d. from zero to 30 cm depth.

Plowing speed was kept constant at about 4 km/h throughout the experiment. The measured or calculated parameters included: tractor drawbar pull and rolling resistance, drive wheel slip and tractor tractive efficiency. Statistical analysis of the test {{results showed that the}} primary difference between the tractor types or conditions was in their wheel slip, such that the average wheel slip of U 650 was lowest (12. 6 %) while that of unballasted MF 285 was highest (27 %) and was reduced to 17. 7 % with liquid ballasting. Also, while growth of unballasted MF 285 wheel slip with increasing <b>plowing</b> <b>depth</b> was drastically high (11 % to 48 %), that of U 650 was quite moderate (9. 7 % to 16. 5 %).

The experimental design was a randomized complete block design with a 3 × 4 factorial. The effect of <b>plowing</b> <b>depth</b> {{on all of the}} parameters mentioned was highly significant. Implement draft and drawbar power requirement both increased with <b>plowing</b> <b>depth,</b> whereas a decreasing trend of specific draft with depth was observed. Soil moisture content had no significant effect on draft and specific draft of chisel plow in the range of moisture contents studied, though both parameters were minimized at 10 - 12 % m. c.

40|$|Tillage or plowing {{quality is}} usually {{evaluated}} by the soil bulk density and distribution of organic matter.

The amounts of soil density, soil organic carbon, soil water infiltration and crop yields were measured. The results showed that, deep tillage had the greatest effects on soil densities, soil organic carbon, infiltration rates and crop yields. Mean value of soil bulk density was 1. 65 g cm - 3 in shallow tillage which decreased by increasing the <b>plowing</b> <b>depth</b> to 1. 53 and 1. 151 g cm - 3 in semi-deep and deep tillage, respectively.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{investigate}} the effect of transition of mounted implements from operation to transport on longitudinal stability of a tractor that works on sloping land, a mathematical model was developed. In this model two operation modes for a mounted chisel plow were considered: penetration of the plow into the soil and depth reduction of it, {{and the effects of}} transferred forces and torques from the plow on longitudinal stability index of tractor were studied. Longitudinal stability index of tractor was defined as the ratio of the dynamic load of tractor front axle to the static load of it when tractor is on level ground. To test the model, different geometries and mass specifications of tractor MF 285 and chisel plow combination were used as the input parameters of the model. According to the results of this study, during plow penetration into the soil, internal forces of the connecting rods were zero and positive values were obtained for the internal force of the connecting rods during depth reduction of the plow; therefore, connecting rods acted only as pulling beams. Furthermore, when the <b>plow</b> <b>depth</b> was increased, the model predicted the increase of the force exerted on the center of gravity of tractor in X direction; however, the force exerted on the center of gravity of tractor in Z direction was almost not affected by the <b>plow</b> <b>depth</b> and height ratio variations. These results were expected and verified that the assumptions of the model have been rational. Moreover, longitudinal stability index of tractor during plow penetration was approximately constant. However at the moment of transition of the plow from operation to transport, this index was reduced abruptly. Therefore in situations that tractor works on steep slopes, plow transition from operation to transport should be avoided...|$|R

The semiarid regions of the world are considered the main areas where this parasitic weed is established causing heavy infestation as it is able to produce high numbers of seeds (up to 500, 000 per plant), which remain viable for extended period (more than 20 years). In this paper the results obtained from eleven treatments in order to control this parasitic weed including chemical, agronomic, biological and biotechnological methods compared with the untreated test under two <b>plowing</b> <b>depths</b> (30 and 50 cm) are reported. The split-plot design with 3 replicates was adopted. In 2014 a trial was performed in Foggia province (southern Italy) on processing tomato (cv Docet) grown in the field infested by Phelipanche ramosa. Tomato seedlings were transplant on May 5, on a clay-loam soil. During the growing cycle of the tomato crop, at 56 - 78 and 92 days after transplantation, the number of parasitic shoots emerged in each plot was detected. At tomato harvesting, on August 18, the major quantity-quality yield parameters were determined (marketable yield, mean weight, dry matter, pH, soluble solids and color of fruits). All data were subjected to analysis of variance (ANOVA) and the means were compared by Tukey's test. Each treatment studied did not provide complete control against Phelipanche ramosa.

In all treatments, the tractor engine speed was set at rated rpm (2000 and 2200 for MF 399 and JD 4230, respectively) and forward speed was kept constant at about 4. 5 ± 5 km/hr. The measured and calculated parameters included: drawbar pull, rolling resistance, wheel slip, tractive {{efficiency and}} fuel consumption. The results indicated that tractive efficiency of MF 399 in deep plowing increased from 36. 5 % to 53 % with ballasting the drive wheels, even though the improved traction was not {{comparable to that of}} JD 4230 (64 %) at the same <b>plowing</b> <b>depth.</b> However, at ballasted condition it is comparable to JD 4230 at shallow and medium depth plowing due to its lower fuel consumption.

The cone index (CI) decreased with increase of the tillage depth. It is attributable to soil disturbing and loosening of the deeper layers under conventional tillage compared to reduced tillage. This trend, however, was observed only in the first (after treatments’ application and before cropping) and second (the highest rate of vegetative growth) samplings. In the third sampling (after harvest), there were not significant differences between the CI values under two tillage systems in different soil depths. It might be due to soil re-compaction (approaching the pre-tillage state) as well as disappearance of the tillage effects seven month after commencement of the experiment. In fact, the soil mechanical resistance increased with the time indicating soil re-compaction over the growing season. Adding FYM to the surface layer (i. e. 0 - 10 cm) of ridge soil resulted in significant decrease of soil mechanical resistance compared to control treatment. The CI decreased significantly in the 30 ton ha- 1 treatment up to the stage of highest rate of vegetative grow, but the effect on CI was diminished after harvest. However, the decreasing effects of the 60 ton ha- 1 treatment on the CI continued to the harvesting time.

The fields had lower draft and reaction force in the soil with only stubble height, which was greater than that in the soil with dense straw for all water content levels. This was also observed in the second year for the whole depth. This study shows that the moldboard plow with a trash-board provided minimum draft and reaction forces with only straw and heavy straw. The results indicate that straw nearby shear significantly increased displacement for all treatments, with variance of straw nearby moldboard. Hence, the results verify that a trash-board continuously created large soil fragmentation with different water content. Straw labels create a position of straw which also allows for better results. It is important to install trash-boards with the moldboard plow for heavy straw incorporation...|$|E
40|$|A {{comparative}} study of organic and conventional arable farming systems was conducted in The Netherlands {{to determine the effect}} of management practices on chemical and biological soil properties and soil health. Soils from thirteen accredited organic farms and conventionally managed neighboring farms were analyzed using a polyphasic approach combining traditional soil analysis, culture-dependent and independent microbiological analyses, a nematode community analysis and an enquiry about different management practices among the farmers. Organic management, known primarily for the abstinence of artificial fertilizers and pesticides, resulted in significantly lower levels of both nitrate and total soluble nitrogen in the soil, higher numbers of bacteria of different trophic groups, as well as larger species richness in both bacteria and nematode communities and more resilience to a drying¿rewetting disturbance in the soil. The organic farmers plough their fields less deeply and tend to apply more organic carbon to their fields, but this did not result in a significantly higher organic carbon content in their soils. The levels of ammonium, organic nitrogen, phosphate and total phosphorus did not differ, significantly between the soils under different management. Fifty percent of the conventional Dutch farmers also used organic fertilizers and the numbers of farmers using a green crop fertilizer did not differ between the two management types. Soil type ¿ clayey or sandy soil ¿ in general had a much stronger effect on the soil characteristics than management type. The soil type influenced pH, nitrate, ammonium, phosphate and organic carbon levels as well as numbers of oligotrophic bacteria and of different groups of nematodes, and different diversity indices. With the collected data set certain soil characteristics could also be attributed to the use of different management practices like <b>plow</b> <b>depth,</b> crop or cover crop type or to the management history of the soil...|$|R
40|$|Damage to cotton by Rotylenchulus reniformis below <b>plow</b> <b>depth</b> was {{evaluated}} in a {{sandy clay loam}} soil at Weslaco, Texas. In December 1999, 14 holes on 51 -cm centers were dug 91 cm deep along the planting bed and adjacent furrow and 2 ml of 1, 3 -dichloropropene was placed 91, 61, and 30 cm deep as each hole was refilled and packed. This technique eliminated 96 %, 81 %, and 74 % of R. reniformis down to 107 cm at distances 0, 25, and 51 cm laterally {{from the point of}} application (P ≤ 0. 05), whereas chisel fumigation at 168 liters/ha 43 cm deep reduced nematode numbers only in the top 61 cm (P ≤ 0. 001). Manual placement of fumigant increased yield 92 %; chisel fumigation increased yield 88 % (P ≤ 0. 005). A second experiment in February 2001 placed fumigant 43 or 81 cm deep, or at both 43 and 81 cm. Holes alone had no significant effect on nematode density at planting, midseason or harvest, on root length density at midseason, or on cotton lint yield. Fumigant at 43 cm reduced nematode numbers above fumigant application depth at planting 94 % (P ≤ 0. 02), at midseason 37 % (P ≤ 0. 09), and at harvest 0 %, increasing yield 57 % (P ≤ 0. 002). Fumigant at 81 cm reduced nematode numbers above fumigant application depth at planting 86 % (P ≤ 0. 02), at midseason 74 % (P ≤ 0. 02), and at harvest 48 % (P ≤ 0. 01), increasing yield 53 % (P ≤ 0. 002). Fumigating at both 43 and 81 cm reduced nematode numbers above 90 cm 94 % at planting and 79 % at midseason, increased midseason root-length density 14 -fold below 76 cm, and doubled yield (P ≤ 0. 02 in all cases) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{study was}} carried out to {{increase}} the productivity of marginal soil by deep tillage method. The study was located in Mangunan, Giriredjo, Bantul, {{during the period of}} August to December 1995. Randomized Completely Block Design was employed with three replications and treatments. The treatments are : no plowing (A), soil <b>plowing</b> at the <b>depth</b> of 10 cm (B) and soil <b>plowing</b> at the <b>depth</b> of 50 cm (C). Result of the study revealed that the highest yield of Zea mays was found on the no plowed marginal soil. Those are 29, 67 kw/ha for the plowed soil at the depth of 50 cm and 7, 48 kw/ha for the no plowed marginal soil, respectively. Significant different of yield/ha was suspected due to more stable water supply from root zone (as indicated by higher water retention and total porosity), the lower soil penetration and soil bulk density of the plowed soil at the depth of 50 cm than at the no plowed soil. As a result a better growth yield of the plowed marginal soil at the depth of 50 cm than at no plowed marginal soil...|$|R
40|$|Agriculture {{must meet}} the twin {{challenge}} of feeding a growing population while simultaneously of minimizing its global environmental impacts. The organic farming, which is a system aimed at producing food with minimal harm to ecosystems, is often proposed as a possible solution. However, critics argue that organic agriculture may give lower yields and therefore more land is {{required in order to}} produce the same amount of food of the conventional farms, resulting in more widespread deforestation and biodiversity loss, thus undermining the environmental benefits of organic practices. The long-term experiment was established in 2001 in order to compare organic vs. conventional cropping systems and inversion vs. non-inversion soil tillage. A 3 -year crop rotation (chickpea, durum wheat and tomato) was established in both cropping systems. In the organically managed cropping system, the crop rotation was implemented with hairy vetch and oilseed rape cover crops which were green manured before tomato transplanting and chickpea sowing, respectively (Fig. 1). The soil tillage were: (i) inversion tillage consisting in moldboard <b>plowing</b> (<b>depth</b> of 30 cm) + disc harrowing; (ii) non-inversion tillage consisting in subsoiling (depth of 20 cm) + disc harrowing. In this poster are reported the results of 2013 / 2014 cropping season on the yield and weed biomass observed in durum wheat, chickpea and tomato crops...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{experimental}} activity was the analysis of wheat, corn and soya bean yields as affected by three techniques of soil tillage;in the meanwhile, crop residues management and grains contamination by fungi. The site test was located in Polesine, at Sasse-Rami farm (property of Veneto Agricoltura) in Ceregnano (Rovigo) on silt-clay textured fields. The trials were carried out according to three tillage techniques commolnly used by farmers: 1) conventional tillage system with <b>plowing</b> <b>depth</b> 35 cm, with total mixing of crop residues and subsequent secondary tillage to prepare the seedbed 2) minimum tillage, by decompaction of soil without layer inversion and with partial mixing of crop residues with the soil 3) direct seeding with deposition of seed without any tillage and with total conservation of crop residues on the soil surface. The evaluation of the three techniques was performed by monitoring soil conditions and their evolution over time, using the cone penetration test, which allows to estimate soil compaction from which root asphyxia or vernal pool may arise. It was also monitored the evolution of organic matter and its humus fractions, {{in order to identify}} possible variations, and to collect yield data related to the different crops over the years test. Crop residues management was monitored by collecting samples in the plots and taking photos to assess the surface covered by the residues, in order to find the correlation with the residues mass; samplings were performed on subplots treated with Pseudomonas putida based products to increase the degradation of crop residues; degradation process of crop residues was monitored by tensile testing and determination of organic carbon, and nitrogen. ...|$|E

This work aims to highlight the wear resistance of the harrows discs manufactured, consolidated and sharpened differently. The tests were conducted in the laboratory and the field of the Faculty of Exploitation and Repair of Agricultural Machinery of the State Technical University of Kirovograd (Ukraine) in 2015. The technical equipment consists of devices for consolidation by electric discharge and for measurement the linear wear of discs, a harrow, a sand test bed, a tractor and discs made of different materials and technologies. Some parameterized were collected during the laboratory test each 5 ha and up to 20 ha of operation and in the fields each 30 ha until the time limit of exploitation. The Laboratory tests have shown that after twenty (20) ha of operation, the wear resistance of the experimental discs made of steel 65 G and consolidated by electric discharge with simultaneous grinding (sharpening angle of 30 °) is 2. 95 times higher than the discs in series made of steel 28 MnB 5. The field experiment gave the following results: According to agro technical requirements, the <b>plowing</b> <b>depth</b> limit of serial discs made of steel 28 MnB 5 was reached after an operating duration of 120 ha while for experimental discs made of steel 65 G and consolidated by electric discharge with simultaneous grinding (sharpening angle of 30 degrees) this duration is of 156 ha. The diameter wear limit of experimental discs was reached after an operating duration of 179 ha against 154 ha for the serial ones.
