The “causes”, “advantages”, “problems” and “work environment” are included as exogenous (input) variables, while the “effectiveness” and “satisfaction” are endogenous (output) variables. The data are obtained through two independent surveys – a <b>postal</b> <b>inquiry</b> and an inquiry in Internet. The theoretical model is tested using the diagonal assessed method of the least squares, applied to the primary matrix with polichorical correlation coefficients. ...|$|E
40|$|Background: This {{prospective}} {{longitudinal study}} investigates whether suspected motor problems and low preference for active play in childhood {{are associated with}} physical inactivity and low cardiorespiratory fitness in adolescence.

40|$|Vocational {{training}} of general practitioners in Belgium consists [...] among others [...] of 34 seminars {{to be followed}} in small groups {{during a period of}} two years. The {{purpose of this study was}} to develop an instrument for continuing evaluation of this system, and to gather evaluative data. 58 % of 177 young general practitioners responded to our <b>postal</b> <b>inquiry,</b> in which ten open-ended questions were put, and 50 statements were to be rated on a six-point-scale. The inquiry revealed that the Belgian vocational training has a large influence on the evolution from inexperienced young doctor to self-confident general practitioner. Factor analysis on the scores of the 50 statements uncovered three dimensions: (1) working climate, (2) learning results, and (3) identification. The reliability of the scales, constructed for each of these factors, was between 0. 80 and. 86 (Cronbach's alpha). Mean scores on these scales were all high. The Belgian vocational training seems to be accepted and appreciated by the young GPs, but improvements might be suggested. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: To {{explore the}} impact of {{structural}} integration on homecare quality. Methods: A case study in an organisation comprising a before-after comparison with baseline and four follow-up measurements during 1994 - 2009, using interviews with clients (n= 66 - 84) and <b>postal</b> <b>inquiries</b> to relatives (n= 73 - 78) and staff (n= 68 - 136). Results : Despite the organisational reform involving extensive mergers of health and social care organisations and cuts in staff and service provision, homecare quality remained at almost the same level throughout the 15 -year follow-up. According to the clients, it even slightly improved in some homecare areas. Conclusions: The results show that despite the structural integration and cuts in staff and service provision, the quality of homecare remained at a good level. Assuming that the potential confounders did have inhibiting effects, {{the results suggest that}} structural integration had a positive impact on homecare quality. To obtain firmer evidence to support this tentative conclusion, further research with a randomised comparison design is needed.   </p...|$|R
40|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1985, the National Board of Health in Finland issued directives for the initiation of farmers' occupational health services in municipal health care centres. The directives {{were based on the}} evaluation study on farmers' occupational health services in Finland. The main aim {{of this study is to}} analyse the current problems of the farmers' occupational health care system and to analyse how effective the system is. The efficiency of the occupational health services has been surveyed with <b>postal</b> <b>inquiries</b> twice, first in 1982 and later in 1986. The farmers' knowledge of appropriate means for reducing hazardous exposures had improved significantly since the initiation of the occupational health services. The effect of the occupational health services was evident particularly in the more effective use of personal safety devices. The limited resources at the municipal health care centres form the main obstacle in the provision of occupational health services for all farmers who would like to have them. 25 - 35 % of the farmers in Finland (total 45, 000 farmers) are willing to participate in the occupational health care system.

He asked Cayce to describe Layne's own ailments and suggest cures, and reportedly found the results both accurate and effective. Layne regarded the ability as clairvoyance. Layne suggested that Cayce offer his trance healing to the public. Cayce was reluctant as {{he had no idea what}} he was prescribing while asleep, and whether the remedies were safe. He also told Layne he himself did not want to know anything about the patient as it was not relevant. He finally agreed, on the condition that readings would be free. He began, with Layne's help, to offer free treatments to the townspeople. Layne described Cayce's method as, [...] "...a self-imposed hypnotic trance which induces clairvoyance." [...] Reports of Cayce's work appeared in the newspapers, which inspired many <b>postal</b> <b>inquiries.</b> Cayce stated he could work just as effectively using a letter from the individual as with the person being present in the room. Given only the person's name and [...] location, Cayce said he could diagnose the physical and mental conditions of what he termed [...] "the entity," [...] and then provide a remedy. Cayce was still reticent and worried, as [...] "one dead patient was all he needed to become a murderer". His fiancée, Gertrude Evans, agreed with him. [...] Few people knew what he was up to. [...] There was a common belief at the time that subjects of hypnosis eventually went insane, or at least that their health suffered. Cayce soon became famous, and people from around the world sought his advice through correspondence.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to assess the serological association between previous Chlamydia trachomatis infection and subfertility in a general population sample. A nested case (n = 493) -control (n = 986) study in a population-based birth cohort consisting of 12, 058 live births from the year 1966 was conducted. The analysis was restricted to those 6007 cohort members who replied to a <b>postal</b> <b>inquiry</b> and participated in a health examination including blood samples at the age of 31 years. The presence of C. trachomatis-specific serum IgG antibodies was screened by a synthetic peptide-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. All the positive sera were further tested by the microimmunofluorescence method using immunotype pools and individual immunotypes of C. trachomatis as antigens. An association was found between the detection of immunotype-specific C. trachomatis antibodies and subfertility both in men and women. The results of the present study confirm the serological association between past C. trachomatis infections and subfertility in male or female partners of the couple in the population-based sample...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Successful {{careers in}} top-performance sports demand {{large amounts of}} time and {{personal}} resources and normally they take a course parallel to the period of educational and professional qualification. Regarding careers of former top-performance athletes, the question arises as to how far the engagement in top-performance sports {{has an influence on}} the professional career path. This article aims to categorize the professional careers of top-performance athletes and to connect them with the subjective ratings of the respondents. This will be carried out by means of objective life-course data of former Olympic athletes. The theoretical approach is based on recent conceptions of life-course research and of professional socialization research. In a <b>postal</b> <b>inquiry</b> of 616 successful German Olympic athletes (male and female) the sports and professional careers were recorded retrospectively. The results show that former top-performance athletes generally have higher educa-tional qualifications and professional positions than the German population. But as there are big differences with regard to the individual career patterns, a typology of professional careers seems to be practical. For that purpose, a classification typology of professional careers was developed using cluster analysis. The engagement in sports rather favours the professional career in its course.

40|$|This paper studies client {{trust in}} professionals, {{theoretically}} and empirically. The theoretical elaboration, founded on general sociological theories of trust, aims to distinguish different dimensions of trust – personal, impersonal, and process trust – and to explicate the stabilizing identities and control mechanisms {{on which they}} are based: persons, roles, programs and values. The empirical case study concerns what aspects of trust, and what expectations and controls, are most important for Swedish auditors {{when it comes to}} building and maintaining client trust. The analysis is based on data from a <b>postal</b> <b>inquiry</b> survey in 2003. It shows that practicing auditors experience the personal dimension of trust as primary, the processual as secondary, and the impersonal as tertiary. The study thus confirms the importance of personal trust between auditor and client, stabilized by the professionalś individual character and conduct, but points also {{to the fact that the}} institutionalization of distrust in professional roles, programs and values is central for building personal as well as impersonal trust. The institutionalized roles, programs and values of the profession ensure that a minimum of trust from the market and the client is present before personal trust is established.

40|$|This study {{focussed}} on {{features of}} work and lifestyle predicting coronary heart disease. In 1981 the 5353 subjects were active Finnish municipal employees, aged 44 - 58 years. They answered a <b>postal</b> <b>inquiry</b> in 1981 and 1985. The cumulative incidence of coronary heart disease was 3. 5 % (188). The predictors were selected by discriminant analytic methods and logistic models. The risk for women was explained best by physically too heavy work (RR 2. 5, 95 % CI 1. 3 - 4. 8), and residence in north-eastern Finland (RR 2. 0, 95 % CI 1. 1 - 3. 4). The risk for men was explained best by three factors: smoking (RR 2. 3, 95 % CI 1. 4 - 3. 9), frequent walking or moving about at work (RR 1. 7, 95 % CI 1. 2 - 2. 4), and a household with two or more unemployed members over 15 years of age (RR 1. 7, 95 % CI 1. 2 - 2. 5). These men often had a secondary job or had done much housework.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} the clinical factors before, and in association with, {{coronary artery bypass}} grafting (CABG) that {{increase the risk of}} readmission to hospital {{in the first two years}} after surgery. PATIENTS: All patients in western Sweden who had CABG without simultaneous valve surgery between 1 June 1988 and 1 June 1991. METHODS: All patients who were readmitted to hospital were evaluated by <b>postal</b> <b>inquiry</b> and hospital records. RESULTS: A total of 2121 patients were operated on, of whom 2037 were discharged from hospital. Information regarding readmission was missing in four patients, leaving 2033 patients; 44 % were readmitted to hospital. The most common reasons for readmission were angina pectoris and congestive heart failure. There were 12 independent significant predictors for readmission: clinical history (a previous history of either congestive heart failure or myocardial infarction, or CABG); acute operation; postoperative complications (time in intensive care unit greater than two days, neurological complications); clinical findings four to seven days after the operation (arrhythmia, systolic murmur equivalent to mitral regurgitation); medication four to seven days after the operation (antidiabetics, diuretics for heart failure, other antiarrhythmics (other than beta blockers, calcium antagonists, and digitalis), and lack of treatment with aspirin). CONCLUSION: 44 % of patients were readmitted to hospital two years after CABG. The most common reasons for readmission were angina pectoris and congestive heart failure. Four clinical markers predicted readmission: clinical history; acute operation status; postoperative complications; and clinical findings and medication four to seven days after operation...|$|E

The surveys {{have been conducted}} at intervals of approximately ten years. However, faster provision of data on changes {{in the use of}} time is needed, for example, for the calculations of the household satellite account. For this purpose, Statistics Finland has developed a light time diary, tested at its Survey Laboratory by means of the focus group interview procedure. The light diary comprises 35 pre-coded main activity categories as well as data on with whom time is spent. The diary served as a pilot survey conducted as a <b>postal</b> <b>inquiry</b> among a population of 1, 000 persons in March 2010 {{at the same time as}} the time use survey was carried out by means of the full-scale diary. The aim of the pilot survey was to study whether results comparable with those of the full-scale diary can be produced with the light diary. The control data were data from the diaries kept in the full-scale time use survey in March. The same 35 -category classification of activities as in the light diary data was formed for the control data.

40|$|This study characterizes {{possible}} confounders {{that might}} make cohorts vaccinated and unvaccinated against influenza and pneumococcal infection different at baseline, with {{the hypothesis that the}} two cohorts are comparable. The similarity between health and demographic data was analysed by a randomized, multivariant study addressed to 10, 000 persons aged 65 years and older in Stockholm County and was carried out {{in the form of a}} <b>postal</b> <b>inquiry</b> during the period December 2000 to May 2001. The study-population response rate was 78 %. Of these, 66 % (5, 120 persons) had been given at least one influenza vaccination during the 3 -year study period (1998 - 2000), 50 % (3, 780) had received one pneumococcal vaccination and 78 % had received both vaccines during the period. The vaccination rate was lower in the age group 65 - 69 years (60 %), compared with elderly cohorts aged over 70 years (67 - 72 %, P < 0. 001). Elderly persons living in nursing homes or institutions had higher vaccination rates than persons living in their own households (72 vs. 67 %). Persons with underlying chronic diseases had higher vaccination rates (71 %, P < 0. 001) than those without underlying chronic diseases. Vaccine recipients had fewer days in hospital, compared with non-recipients. Unvaccinated persons with myocardial disease had nine times more days in hospital than vaccinated persons with myocardial disease. Vaccination against pneumococcal infection had an additional effect with influenza vaccination in reducing hospitalization for chronic lung diseases; influenza vaccination alone did not have this effect. In conclusion, the influenza and pneumococcal-vaccine recipients were older and had significantly more chronic lung and heart conditions than the unvaccinated cohort...|$|E
40|$|Background - This {{prospective}} {{longitudinal study}} investigates whether suspected motor problems and low preference for active play in childhood {{are associated with}} physical inactivity and low cardiorespiratory fitness in adolescence.

Odds ratios (OR) and their 95 % confidence intervals (95 % CI) for the level of physical activity and fitness were obtained from multinomial logistic regression and adjusted for socio-economic position and body mass index. Low preference for active play in childhood was associated with physical inactivity (boys: OR 3. 31, 95 % CI 2. 42 – 4. 53; girls: OR 1. 79, 95 % CI 1. 36 – 2. 36) and low cardiorespiratory fitness (boys: OR 1. 87, 95 % CI 1. 27 – 2. 74; girls: OR 1. 52, 95 % CI 1. 09 – 2. 11) in adolescence. Suspected gross (OR 2. 16, 95 % CI 1. 33 – 3. 49) and fine (OR 1. 88, 95 % CI 1. 35 – 2. 60) motor problems were associated with physical inactivity among boys. Children with suspected motor problems and low preference for active play tended to have an even higher risk of physical inactivity in adolescence. Conclusions/Significance - Low preference for active play in childhood was associated with physical inactivity and low cardiorespiratory fitness in adolescence. Furthermore, children with suspected motor problems and low preference for active play tended to have an even higher risk of physical inactivity in adolescence. Identification of children who do not prefer active play and who have motor problems may allow targeted interventions to support their motor learning and participation in active play and thereby promote their physical activity and fitness in later life...|$|E
40|$|Questions of {{the small}} size of {{non-industrial}} private forest (NIPF) holdings in Finland are considered and factors affecting their partitioning are analyzed. This work arises out of Finnish forest policy statements in which the small average size of holdings has been seen to have a negative influence on the economics of forestry. A survey of the literature indicates that the size of holdings is an important factor determining the costs of logging and silvicultural operations, while its influence on the timber supply is slight. The empirical data are based on a sample of 314 holdings collected by interviewing forest owners in the years 1980 - 86. In 1990 - 91 the same holdings were resurveyed by means of a <b>postal</b> <b>inquiry</b> and partly by interviewing forest owners. The principal objective in compiling the data is to assist in quantifying ownership factors that influence partitioning among different kinds of NIPF holdings. Thus the mechanism of partitioning were described and a maximum likelihood logistic regression model was constructed using seven independent holding and ownership variables. One out of four holdings had undergone partitioning in conjunction with a change in ownership, one fifth among family owned holdings and nearly a half among jointly owned holdings. The results of the logistic regression model indicate, for instance, that the odds on partitioning is about three times greater for jointly owned holdings than for family owned ones. Also, the probabilities of partitioning were estimated and the impact of independent dichotomous variables on the probability of partitioning ranged between 0. 02 and 0. 10. The low value of the Hosmer-Lemeshow test statistic indicates a good fit of the model and the rate of correct classification was estimated to be 88 per cent with a cutoff point of 0. 5. The average size of holdings undergoing ownership changes decreased from 29. 9 ha to 28. 7 ha over the approximate interval 1983 - 90. In addition, the transition probability matrix showed that the trends towards smaller size categories mostly involved in the small size categories, less than 20 ha. The results of the study can be used in considering the effects {{of the small}} size of holdings for forestry and if the purpose is to influence partitioning through forest or rural policy...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: To {{determine}} {{the prevalence of}} HIV and risk behaviour in a national sample of homosexual men in the Netherlands. To adjust this prevalence estimate for selection factors connected with a blood test. Methods: Participants in the study including a blood test, (n= 308, also 147 particpants without a blood test) were recruited in 1991 / 1992 among 1134 male respondents of a non-HIV specific <b>postal</b> <b>inquiry</b> without a blood test in 1989 among readers of the "Gay Krant" a national magazine for homosexuals. There are no indications that readers of the Gay Krant have a different risk of HIV infection than other homosexual men. On base of self-reported serostatus in 1989 the measured seroprevalence in 1991 / 1992 is adjusted in a logistic model for selection through participation in the blood test. Results: The prevalence among the 308 participants in the blood test was 6. 5 % (95 % CI 4. 0 - 10. 0). Participation in the blood test was not significantly related to self-reported risk behaviour in 1989 or self-reported serostatus in 1989. The prevalence of HIV in 1991 / 1992 among the 826 other respondents of 1989 is estimated by the model to be 5. 2 %. The HIV prevalence in 1991 / 1992 among male readers of the Gay Krant resident in the Netherlands {{is estimated to be}} 5. 6 %. Using a statistical simulation technique the 95 % confidence interval of this prevalence is estimated to be 3. 4 - 7. 8 %. The estimated number of HIV infected homosexual men in the Netherlands in 1991 / 1992 lies between 6500 and 15000. Of the participants 40 % had anal sex with steady partners and 25 % with casual partners in the last 6 months. Of those 79 % (with steady partners) respectively 42 % (with casual partners) did not or not always use condoms. In all 38 % had unprotected anal sex in the last 6 months. Risk behavior with steady partners increased between 1990 and 1991 / 1992. Conclusions: The spread of HIV among homosexual men in the Netherlands is substantial, even outside of Amsterdam. The level of risk behavior is high and shows an increase. It is possible to carry out seroepidemiological research among homosexual men without participation being selective on HIV status. ...|$|E
