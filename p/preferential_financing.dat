40|$|Abstract: We provide {{empirical}} evidence that campaign contributions are {{strongly associated with}} market expectations of future firm-specific political favors, including preferential access to external finance. Using a novel dataset, we find that Brazilian firms providing more contributions in the 1998 campaign to (elected) federal deputies experienced higher stock returns following the election, even after controlling for industry-specific effects and firm-specific characteristics. This suggests that federal deputies were expected to shape policy and actions to benefit particular firms. Consistent with such political favors, we find that these firms substantially increased their financial leverage relative to a control group {{in the four years}} following election, especially from banks, suggesting that contributions gained firms <b>preferential</b> access to <b>finance...</b>|$|R
40|$|We {{examine the}} impact of {{politically}} connected directors on accounting quality using a quasi experiment in China. In October 2013, “Rule 18 ” was issued to prohibit government and party officials, who were concurrently holding public offices or had recently retired from such positions within the last three years, from serving as directors for publicly listed firms. The regulation is part of China’s anti-corruption campaign, and it has led to a large number of politically connected directors resigning from their roles as directors involuntarily. As such, Rule 18 has effectively weakened, if not fully discontinued, the political connections of the firms that previously hired government officials as directors. Our empirical analyses employ a difference-in-differences research design with firm fixed effects to examine the pre- and post- period accounting quality around the enactment of Rule 18. We find that, compared to propensity-score-matched control firms, the accounting quality of firms with politically connected directors increases after Rule 18, and that the effect is stronger for non-state-owned enterprises firms than for state-owned enterprises firms. We further examine the channels through which politically connected directors affect accounting quality. The evidence suggests that connected firms have better access to <b>preferential</b> <b>financing</b> and are under lax regulations, which reduce firms’ incentives to provide transparent information...|$|E
40|$|The popular folkloric axiom “Housing Matters ” acquires {{a poignant}} {{significance}} {{in the context of}} countries that are engaged in a wholesale revision of their political, economic and social paradigms. This paper examines the state of Polish housing as a legacy of the socialist period and the transition of the sector to a market economy. It describes housing conditions {{at the beginning of the}} transition; uses the housing policy framework conceptualized by World Bank consultant Shlomo Angel to trace progress throughout the ensuing decade; and concludes by identifying current strengths and challenges in the emergent Polish housing system. The Way Things Were When the Berlin Wall toppled in 1989 symbolizing the collapse of communism, housing in Polish cities reflected the common characteristics of centrally planned economies in the Soviet bloc countries. Dreary four- and five-story apartment blocks constructed from industrially produced prefabricated concrete panels ringed the cities, constituting the largest part of urban housing. Sixty-three percent of the population was urban. There were three basic types of housing: units owned directly by the state or by state-owned enterprises (SOEs); cooperatives, usually constructed by state-owned enterprises; and private housing, primarily single-family dwellings in rural areas. By 1990 cooperatives were the most common housing type, comprising 50 % of all new units. The development of cooperative housing was encouraged through policies that gave such projects <b>preferential</b> <b>financing,</b> land access, and allocations of labor and building materials...|$|E
40|$|Social {{rental housing}} {{is one of}} the {{possible}} instruments which are applied to ensure the satisfaction of housing needs. However, public funds which are transferred to entities that operate within this area should be usually classiﬁed as State aid. The analysis presented in this paper concerns the following question: is it possible to consider the operation of a social rental housing program as services of general economic interest. This question seems to be a topical issue because of a new legislative initiative aiming at establishing a governmental housing program that was implemented by the Act of 10 September 2015 which amended the Act on certain forms of supporting housing construction. The aforementioned program stipulates the legal frames for refundable and <b>preferential</b> <b>ﬁnancing</b> that may be granted to speciﬁc entities in order to realise investments in social rental housing. The governmental housing program complements earlier local housing policies in force. What is signiﬁcant is that the Polish legislator decided to qualify support granted as services of general economic interest, as referred to in Commission Decision 2012 / 21 /UE of 20 December 2011 on the Application of Article 106 (2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union to State aid in the form of public service compensation granted to certain undertakings entrusted with the operation of services of general economic interest. Applying Commission Decision 2012 / 21 /UE to this situation raises some doubts as to the lack of clarity of a term “social housing”. Due to a certain controversy over the abovementioned issue, the authors have attempted to examine whether the application of preferential provisions of Commission Decision 2012 / 21 /UE to the social housing program is in accordance with the relevant provisions of EU competition rules. 214931204 Studia Prawa Publiczneg...|$|E

Further, our results show that state-controlled enterprises continue to have <b>preferential</b> access to <b>finance</b> and that high-growth firms still rely principally on external debt rather than equity issuance.

Concerning the subjects of small business of the biopharmaceutical cluster the tax-budgetary policy should assume the realization of the following basic actions. It is necessary: 1) to continue the work on introduction the simplified taxation system {{on the basis of the}} patent in the territory of the Altai Republic; 2) to develop the systems of privileges on taxes for the subjects of small and medium businesses of the biopharmaceutical cluster, within the limits of the operating federal legislation; 3) to generate at the expense of the republican budget the system of <b>preferential</b> <b>financing</b> of the subjects of small and medium businesses of the biopharmaceutical cluster.

30|$|In China {{there is}} severe market {{competition}}, but competition mechanisms {{are not well}} developed. The market competition in China {{can be seen from}} two perspectives. First, there is a strong cross-regional competition originally driven by China’s transition to capitalism (Li et al. 2000), illustrated by the “local official promotion tournament” as mentioned early in Section “The logic of market competition {{and its impact on the}} Triple Helix development in China”. Second, there is unfair market competition between SOEs and private firms. This is because the SOEs have privileged access to business opportunities and key resources to exploit the opportunities. As documented in the report by the World Bank and Development Research Centre of the State Council of China (2013), SOEs have a close connection with the Chinese government by which the Chinese economy is controlled, occupy pillar industries where the entry threshold for private firms is extremely high in practice, and enjoy <b>preferential</b> access to <b>finance</b> and other important inputs. Hopefully such situations are going to change. In the Resolution concerning Some Major Issues in Comprehensively Deepening Reform issued by the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party (2013), a key message is to strengthen the role of market in allocating resources to intensify economic structural reform, e.g. by putting private firms on an equal basis to compete with SOEs in the marketplace.|$|R
40|$|This {{is a case}} study, {{based upon}} Australian and US archival records (some of the former newly declassified), of the {{acquisition}} of a new naval capability, examining its impact upon and legacy for the Royal Australian Navy (RAN), as well as Australia’s Government and its policy. It demonstrates how three United States Navy (USN) Charles F. Adams guided missile destroyers (DDGs) were important catalysts for the Royal Australian Navy’s greater self-reliance. The DDGs were acquired out of Australian interest in a closer security relationship with the US, facilitated through standardisation of RAN warships with the USN. Self-interest was mutual, and Australia was permitted to acquire, for the first time, advanced USN warships. Their purchase and affordability were aided by <b>preferential</b> US <b>financing</b> arrangements. The ships were in service from 1965 to 2001, during which time the RAN acquired six more warships of USN-origin and no more of Royal Navy (RN) origin. During this period a relatively equal professional relationship emerged between the RAN and USN, paralleling the RAN’s transition away from its roots in and traditional relationship with the RN. When the DDGs left service, the RAN was more independent and confident as a professional medium power navy. Introduction of the DDGs coincided with Australia’s involvement in the Cold War and with regional security concerns. Vietnam was a watershed in modern naval operations for the RAN; the DDGs served as vehicles of Government policy and built Australia’s credibility with its major ally. But in Australian political circles the level of real {{understanding of how the}} DDGs contributed to Australia’s security was variable. Although twice modernised with digital combat systems, they were in service too long and their replacement lacked a sense of urgency. Their operational and force structure legacy post- 2016 is the US Aegis system-equipped Hobart class DDGs. For just over 25 years, the Chiefs of the RAN were officers who had commanded a DDG. They, and other similarly experienced officers, constituted the RAN’s senior leadership group. Superimposition of their DDG experiences upon RN methods involved cultural change in the RAN which became more authentically Australian in character and name...|$|R
