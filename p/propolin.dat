40|$|The need to {{discover}} and develop alternative therapies to treat methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections is timely. This study was undertaken to purify and identify some anti-MRSA constituents from propolis, a natural product from the beehive traditionally used in folk medicine for its antimicrobial properties. A crude extract of propolis originating from the Solomon Islands ('Pacific propolis') was screened, using an agar dilution assay, in vitro against 15 MRSA clinical isolates. Results revealed activity worthy of further investigation, and subsequent purification work on this crude extract afforded 23 fractions. Further purification of active fractions led to the isolation of compounds 1 – 4, characterized upon analysis of their spectroscopic data (1 D- and 2 D-NMR, MS) and by comparison with the literature, as the prenylflavanones <b>propolin</b> H (1), <b>propolin</b> G (2), <b>propolin</b> D (3), and <b>propolin</b> C (4). This study {{is the first to}} report the anti-MRSA activity of 'Pacific propolis' and the presence of prenylflavanones in the propolis sample selected. The anti-MRSA activity of <b>propolin</b> D (3) (MIC 8 – 16 [*]mg/L) and <b>propolin</b> C (4) (MIC 8 – 32 [*]mg/L) is reported for the first time...|$|E
40|$|AbstractChemical {{investigation}} of the dichloromethane extracts of the propolis collected from bee (Tetragonula biroi Friese) hives in San Roque, Sorsogon, Philippines afforded <b>propolin</b> A (1), <b>propolin</b> E (2), <b>propolin</b> H (3), glyasperin A (4), squalene, a mixture of lupeol, α-amyrin and β-amyrin, and another mixture of urs- 12 -en- 3 -one, olean- 12 -en- 3 -one and lup- 12 -en- 3 -one. The structures of 2 – 4 were elucidated by extensive 1 D and 2 D (COSY, HSQC, and HMBC) NMR spectroscopy, while 1 was identified by comparison of its NMR data with 2...|$|E
40|$|This {{study focused}} on {{identifying}} possible new options derived from natural sources {{for the treatment of}} bacterial infections. Several natural products were investigated for their potential in modulating Shigella-host-cell interactions. The proliferation of Shigella sonnei was effectively inhibited inside HEp- 2 cells in the presence of 4 -methoxycinnamic acid and <b>propolin</b> D. <b>Propolin</b> D also significantly reduced the apoptosis of infected macrophage-like U 937 cells and moderately reduced the secretion of interleukin (IL) - 1 β and IL- 18, which probably resulted from the inhibition of invasion plasmid antigen B secretion by this compound. Further characterization showed that <b>propolin</b> D did not prevent escape of Shigella from phagocytic vacuoles, as evidenced by actin-based motility and by the fact that addition of chloroquine did not further reduce the number of intracellular c. f. u. The role of <b>propolin</b> D in modulating autophagy could not be established under the experimental conditions used. As these compounds had no direct anti-Shigella activity in vitro, it was concluded that these compounds modulated Shigella-host-cell interactions by targeting yet-to-be defined mechanisms that provide benefits to host cells...|$|E
40|$|Propolis is {{a sticky}} {{substance}} that is collected from plants by honeybees. We previously demonstrated that <b>propolins</b> A, B, C, D, E and F, isolated from Taiwanese propolis (TP), could effectively induce human melanoma cell apoptosis and were strong antioxidant agents. In this study, we evaluated TP for free radical scavenging activity by DPPH (1, 2 -diphenyl- 2 -picrylhydrazyl). The phenolic concentrations were quantified by the Folin–Ciocalteu method. The apoptosis trigger activity in {{human melanoma cells}} was evaluated. TP contained {{a higher level of}} phenolic compounds and showed strong capability to scavenge free radicals. Additionally, TP 1 g, TP 3, TP 4 and TP 7 exhibited a cytotoxic effect on human melanoma cells, with an IC 50 of ∼ 2. 3, 2. 0, 3. 3 and 3. 3 [*]μg/ml, respectively. Flow cytometric analysis for DNA fragmentation indicated that TP 1 g, TP 2, TP 3 and TP 7 could induce apoptosis in human melanoma cells and there is a marked loss of cells from the G 2 /M phase of the cell cycle. To address the mechanism of the apoptosis effect of TP, we evaluated its effects on induction of apoptosis-related proteins in human melanoma cells. The levels of procaspase- 3 and PARP [poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase] were markedly decreased. Furthermore, <b>propolins</b> A, B, C, D, E and F in TP were determined using HPLC. The results indicate that TP is a rich source of these compounds. The findings suggest that TP induces apoptosis in human melanoma cells due to its high level of <b>propolins...</b>|$|R

The induction of ATF- 3 expression was mediated by mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways in GS- 002 -treated cells. Furthermore, we found that GS- 002 induced more cell apoptosis in ATF- 3 -overexpressing cells. These results suggest that the induction of apoptosis by the propolis derivative, GS- 002, is partially mediated through ER stress and ATF- 3 -dependent pathways, and GS- 002 has the potential for development as an antitumor drug...|$|E
40|$|HDAC inhibitors (HDACis) {{have been}} {{developed}} as promising anticancer agents in recent years. In this study, we synthesized and characterized a novel HDACi, termed NBM-HD- 1. This agent {{was derived from the}} semisynthesis of <b>propolin</b> G, isolated from Taiwanese green propolis (TGP), and was shown to be a potent suppressor of tumor cell growth in human breast cancer cells (MCF- 7 and MDA-MB- 231) and rat glioma cells (C 6), with an IC 50 ranging from 8. 5 to 10. 3 [*]μM. Western blot demonstrated that levels of p 21 (Waf 1 /Cip 1), gelsolin, Ac-histone 4, and Ac-tubulin markedly increased after treatment of cancer cells with NBM-HD- 1. After NBM-HD- 1 treatment for 1 – 4 [*]h, p-PTEN and p-AKT levels were markedly decreased. Furthermore, we also found the anticancer activities of NBM-HD- 1 in regulating cell cycle regulators. Treatment with NBM-HD- 1, p 21 (Waf 1 /Cip 1) gene expression had markedly increased while cyclin B 1 and D 1 gene expressions had markedly decreased. On the other hand, we found that NBM-HD- 1 increased the expressions of tumor-suppressor gene p 53 in a dose-dependent manner. Finally, we showed that NBM-HD- 1 exhibited potent antitumor activity in a xenograft model. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that this compound, NBM-HD- 1, is a novel and potent HDACi with anticancer activity in vitro and in vivo...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION: A {{previous}} study showed the unique character of Nigerian red propolis from Rivers State, Nigeria (RSN), {{with regards to}} chemical composition and activity against Trypanosoma brucei in comparison with other African propolis. OBJECTIVE: To carry out fractionation and biological testing of Nigerian propolis in order to isolate compounds with anti-trypanosomal activity. To compare {{the composition of the}} RSN propolis with the composition of Brazilian red propolis. METHODOLOGY: Profiling was carried out using HPLC-UV-ELSD and HPLC-Orbitrap-FTMS on extracts of two samples collected from RSN with data extraction using MZmine software. Isolation was carried out by normal phase and reversed phase MPLC. Elucidation of the compounds with a purity[*]>[*] 95 % was performed by 1 D/ 2 D NMR HRMS and HRLC-MS(n). RESULTS: Ten phenolic compounds were isolated {{or in the case of}} liquiritigenin partially purified. Data for nine of these correlated with literature reports of known compounds i. e. one isoflavanone, calycosin (1); two flavanones, liquiritigenin (2) and pinocembrin (5); an isoflavan, vestitol (3); a pterocarpan, medicarpin (4); two prenylflavanones, 8 -prenylnaringenin (7) and 6 -prenylnaringenin (8); and two geranyl flavonoids, <b>propolin</b> D (9) and macarangin (10). The tenth was elucidated as a previously undescribed dihydrobenzofuran (6). The isolated compounds were tested against Trypanosoma brucei and displayed moderate to high activity. Some of the compounds tested had similar activity against wild type T. brucei and two strains displaying pentamidine resistance. CONCLUSION: Nigerian propolis from RSN has some similarities with Brazilian red propolis. The propolis displayed anti-trypanosomal activity at a potentially useful level...|$|E
40|$|Propolis is a {{material}} manufactured by bees and contains beeswax, bee salivary secretions and plant resins. Propolis preparations {{have been used}} for millennia by humans in food, cosmetics and medicines due to its antibacterial effects. Within the hive, propolis {{plays an important role in}} bees’ health, with much of its bioactivity largely dependent on the plant resins the bees select for its production. Few chemical studies are available on the chemistry of propolis produced by Australian honeybees (Apis mellifera, Apidae). This study aimed to determine the chemical composition as well as in vitro antimicrobial effects of propolis harvested from honeybees in subtropical eastern Australia. Honeybee propolis was produced using plastic frames and multiple beehives in two subtropical sites in eastern Australia. Methanolic extracts of propolis were analysed by liquid chromatography with ultraviolet detection and high-resolution mass spectrometry (ultra- high-pressure liquid chromatography (UHPLC) -UV-highresolution tandem mass spectrometry (HR-MS/MS)) and by gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The resulting chemical data were dereplicated for compound characterisation. The two crude extracts in abs. ethanol were tested in vitro by the agar diffusion and broth dilution methods, using a phenol standard solution as the positive control and abs. ethanol as the negative control. Chemical constituents were identified to be pentacyclic triterpenoids and Cprenylated flavonoids, including Abyssinoflavanone VII, <b>Propolin</b> C and Nymphaeol C. The two propolis crude extracts showed bactericidal effects at the minimal inhibitory concentrations of 0. 37 – 2. 04 mg mL− 1 against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923. However, the extracts were inactive against Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 13883 and Candida albicans ATCC 10231. The antistaphylococcal potential of propolis was discussed, also in relation to honeybees’ health, as it warrants further investigations on the social and individual immunities of Australian honeybees. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2015...|$|E
