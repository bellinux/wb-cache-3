5|$|The {{development}} of sawmills and flour mills at the falls spurred demand for railroad service to Minneapolis. In 1868, Minneapolis was only {{served by a}} spur from St. Paul, from the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. <b>Paul</b> <b>and</b> Pacific Railroad, and by the fledgling St. <b>Paul</b> <b>and</b> Pacific Railroad. Minneapolis millers found that railroads based in Milwaukee and Chicago were favoring their cities by diverting wheat from Minneapolis mills. In response, the owners of several Minneapolis mills chartered the Minneapolis and St. Louis Railway, which would connect the Lake Superior and Mississippi Railroad through Minneapolis to the Iowa border. Meanwhile, Jay Cooke {{took control of the}} St. <b>Paul</b> <b>and</b> Pacific Railroad in 1871 with the goal of aggregating it into the Northern Pacific Railway. Bad economic conditions caused the Panic of 1873, and the Northern Pacific had to relinquish control of the St. <b>Paul</b> <b>and</b> Pacific Railroad and the Lake Superior and Mississippi Railroad.|$|E
