50|$|A {{closely related}} but {{different}} design {{is the so-called}} <b>pin</b> <b>plug</b> and matching pin jack. The <b>pin</b> <b>plug</b> designs resemble banana plugs, but without the spring on the male pin. Instead, these designs rely on spring action in the female jack, or tightly machined tolerances, to ensure good contact. The <b>pin</b> <b>plug</b> design was used where maximum density of connectors was desired (such as in pin plugboards), or a very compact connector was needed.|$|E

5000|$|There are two {{different}} bias voltages for Stax earspeakers. The first earspeakers have a 230 volt bias, referred to as [...] "Normal" [...] bias. The later earspeakers have a 580 volt bias, referred to as [...] "Pro" [...] bias.The Normal bias earspeakers use a 6 <b>pin</b> <b>plug,</b> while the Pro bias ones use a 5 <b>pin</b> <b>plug,</b> which is like the 6 <b>pin</b> <b>plug</b> with one pin not present.Pro bias (5 pin) earspeakers can be plugged into a Normal bias (6 pin) socket, and will work with a limitation to maximum volume. Normal bias earspeaker can not be plugged into Pro bias sockets since the bias voltage is too high.All current Stax earspeakers are Pro bias, as the last Normal bias earspeaker went out of production around 1992.|$|E

30|$|The {{material}} being welded experiences {{very hot}} processing conditions as the tool pin rotates {{at very high}} speeds. Therefore, excessive heat generated, thermally softens the material near the boundary of the tool-shoulder and expels large volumes of material {{in the form of}} surface flash. Excessive tool-shoulder frictional heat softening of the material is the reason for the formation of the flash, and high tool-shoulder pressure leads to the ejection of an excessive amount of flash (Bo et al. 2011). Incorrect tool pin length relative to workpiece thickness and change in penetration depth due to variation in plate thickness along the weld line or due to a bowed plate can lead to a lack of penetration. When the <b>pin</b> <b>plug</b> depth is high, the plastic material near the pin is extruded, which results in weld flash. When the pin depth is very high, extruded flash can occur at the roots of the weld, near the pin. At larger tool tilt angles, insufficient plasticised material remains to fill the cavity left in the weld nugget and weld flash appears on the retreating side (Keivani et al. 2013).|$|E
5000|$|Invention of {{the plug}} is claimed by two entities. The Hirschmann company claims it {{was invented by}} Richard Hirschmann in 1924.

50|$|Before the {{legislation}} of the Electrical Products Regulation (a few {{years prior to}} the handover in 1997), British standard extension cables, plugs and adaptors were seldom found in the market. Electrical appliances were fitted with 2-pin plugs and quasi-UK three <b>pin</b> <b>plugs</b> (which meant they were compatible with BS 1363 or BS 546 sockets, but the plug itself did not comply with the British Standard).|$|R

In this way, cables with smaller 5 pin USB 2.0 Micro-B plugs can be plugged into devices with 10 contact USB 3.0 Micro-B receptacles and achieve backward compatibility.|$|R
2500|$|There {{are certain}} {{characteristics}} common to British mains {{plugs and sockets}} intended for domestic use. [...] The brass pins appear relatively solid and large compared to others. British Standards for plugs (with the exception of BS4573) have always specified side entry flex (entry in other types is usually parallel to the axes of the pins). [...] Since 1934, the contacts of a socket have been specified {{in terms of the}} <b>pins</b> of the <b>plug,</b> rather than by specifying the contact dimensions. [...] The pins of both round pin and rectangular <b>pin</b> <b>plugs</b> are arranged in a triangular fashion, the earth pin being the larger and longer pin at the apex. Earthed sockets are designed to be incompatible with two-pin plugs. [...] Both BS546 and BS1363 sockets, when viewed from the front with the earth uppermost, have the line aperture at the lower right.|$|R

25|$|There {{are four}} ratings of {{plug and socket}} in BS546, (2A, 5A, 15A and 30A). Each has the same general {{appearance}} but they are different physical sizes to prevent interchangeability, they use pin spacing which is also different from the two <b>pin</b> <b>plugs</b> specified in BS 372, so earthed plugs will not fit into unearthed sockets, and vice versa. Plugs fitted with BS646 fuses have been optional since the original BS546:1934 with maximum fuse ratings of 2A in the 2A plug, and 5A in the 5A, 15A and 30A plugs. In practice most BS546 plugs are unfused with fused versions being unusual and expensive.|$|R

2500|$|Sockets are {{required}} to mate correctly with BS1363 plugs (as opposed to {{the dimensions of the}} socket contacts being specified). [...] This is checked by means of the use of various gauges which are specified in the standard; these gauges ensure that the socket contacts are correctly positioned and make effective and secure contact with the <b>plug</b> <b>pins.</b> [...] There is no provision for establishing the interchangeability with any other device having <b>plug</b> <b>pins</b> incorporated, but which is not covered by BS1363 (for example a charger or socket cover) unless that device conforms precisely to the <b>plug</b> <b>pin</b> dimensions specified. [...] The insertion of non-compliant plugs may damage sockets.
