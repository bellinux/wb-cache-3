40|$|Migrant workers often {{enter the}} UK {{in the hope}} of finding a better life – the truth is often far from that. Migrant workers are denied social {{benefits}} and are offered very little protection in terms of employment rights while the destitution faced by unemployed migrants makes them more vulnerable to unscrupulous employers. According to our evidence, pay is withheld, holidays refused, unlawful deductions from pay are often demanded and no <b>pay</b> <b>slip</b> provided. Yet migrant workers have no redress because their contract is often deemed ‘unlawful’. Attempts by workers to organise into a union are often thwarted by employers calling in immigration authorities. The intense exploitation faced by migrant workers highlights fundamental weaknesses in British employment law. The best way to address this is to undermine the economic advantage to employers of employing migrant workers. This should be done, not by restricting the supply of such labour but by regulating employment status, practices and protections. By strengthening migrant workers’ rights, we help prevent unscrupulous employers undercutting wages and depressing sectors of the economy. This in turn will help remove some of the hostility shown to migrant workers in sections of society...|$|E
40|$|Background: Influenza causes {{significant}} mortality {{particularly among}} the elderly and high-risk groups. Healthcare workers (HCWs) {{are at risk of}} occupational exposure due to contact with patients. Aims {{of this study was to}} promote flu shot among HCWs through a multimedia campaign in a large North-Eastern Italian Hospital. Methods: The 2013 / 2014 flu vaccination multimedia campaign addressed to HCWs was developed by maintaining pre-existing tools (letters in <b>pay</b> <b>slip</b> and poster displayed in wards) and creating 4 on-line spots (30 ") delivered trough the hospital intranet. Campaign effectiveness was assessed in terms of changes in knowledge, attitude and practice comparing data of pre (10 items) and post test (20 items) survey on a randomized sample of HCWs. Results: Response rates were 92. 6 % (464 / 501) in pre-test and 83. 2 % (417 / 501) in post-test. 93. 8 % (391 / 417) of HCWs reported to awareness of the campaign to promote vaccination. Spots were seen by 59. 6 % (233 / 391) of HCWs. Some reasons for vaccine denial, “not believing in vaccine efficacy” (34. 7 % to 14. 9 %), “not considering flu as a serious problem” (from 24 % to 12. 6 %), “thinking not to get sick” (28. 7 % to 18. 2 %) or “being against the vaccine” (32. 7 % to 21 %), showed a statistically significant reduction after the exposure to the campaign. The “intention to get vaccinated in the next year” instead, raised effectively (13. 1 % to 36. 6 %). Vaccinated HCWs rate in 2013 - 2014 season was 7. 6 % (221 / 2910), and 5. 6 % (164 / 2910) in 2012 - 2013 (p< 0. 005). Conclusions: The multimedia campaign succeeded with regard to KAP outcomes, but the vaccination rate is still far from the goal of 90 %. Due to their impact, especially on younger age groups, web tools deserve to be better studied as effective approach to convey health information among HCW...|$|E

In {{order to maintain}} their records, which include their personal details, payroll details and attendance details, the burden on HRMS department is immense. The lack of consistency in record maintenance leads to both loss of property as well as employee confidence. Drawbacks in existing system are need of extra manual effort. It takes much time to find any employee but still the result is not very much accurate and there is danger of losing the files in some cases. To overcome the above said disadvantages we intended to develop human and enterprise resource administration tool. We need a little knowledge to operate the system. It doesn’t even require any extra hardware device and very easy to find the employees. The software helps the HR’s by reducing their work and all the data will be stored in the database and can be retrieved at any time. The system is able to maintain the attendance details based on the login information and also capable of generating <b>pay</b> <b>slips</b> automatically.

40|$|Abstract:- Payroll is a {{critical}} operation for every organization to pay employee accurately their salary and emoluments on time. For a big organization, {{the idea of taking}} control of employees pay calculations is quite daunting. This computer based payroll system aims to explain in simple terms what payroll involves and demystify the payroll processes. Moreover it is a powerful tool to streamline the time consuming and complex tasks of employee payroll scheduling and planning. This system provides multiple user data access. Each user walks through the entire payroll process as per rights allocated from adding new employee to generate <b>pay</b> <b>slips</b> with clear step by step instructions. Furthermore the system is flexible to implement changes in pay scales.
