5|$|Nicolas Roeg had {{employed}} the fractured editing style of Don't Look Now on his previous films, <b>Performance</b> <b>and</b> Walkabout, {{but it was}} originated by editor Antony Gibbs on Petulia. Roeg served as the cinematographer on Petulia, which incidentally also starred Julie Christie, and Gibbs went on to edit <b>Performance</b> <b>and</b> Walkabout for Roeg. Roeg's use of colour—especially red—can {{be traced back to}} earlier work: both <b>Performance</b> <b>and</b> Walkabout feature scenes where the whole screen turns red, similar in nature to the scene during Christine's drowning when the spilt water on the church slide causes a reaction that makes it—along with the whole screen—turn completely red. The mysterious red-coated figure and its association with death has a direct parallel with an earlier film Roeg worked on as cinematographer, The Masque of the Red Death, which depicted a red clad Grim Reaper character. The fleeting glimpses of the mysterious red-coated figure possibly draw on Proust: in Remembrance of Things Past, while in Venice, the narrator catches sight of a red gown in the distance which brings pack painful memories of his lost love.|$|E
