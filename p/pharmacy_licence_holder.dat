40|$|The project {{aimed to}} develop a better {{understanding}} of the patterns of riding and risk factors associated with older motorcyclists and to recommend measures that may reduce the crash involvement of these riders. The survey of motorcycle <b>licence</b> <b>holders</b> aged 30 and over found that only 53 % had ridden in the last year. The percentage fell with age, from 60 % of <b>licence</b> <b>holders</b> aged 30 to 39 to 41 % of <b>licence</b> <b>holders</b> aged 60 and over. Overall, 43 % of riders who responded were “continuing riders”, 27 % were “returned riders ” and 31 % were “new riders”. These groups were compared in terms of demographics, crash involvement and riding patterns and motorcycles owned now and in the past. The number and percentage of riders in crashes who were aged 30 and over doubled from 1991 - 2000. Notwithstanding this increase, the crash involvement rate of <b>licence</b> <b>holders</b> aged 30 and over is lower than that of younger <b>licence</b> <b>holders</b> and it decreases with age. Reductions in the amount of riding and more experience (on average) as rider age increases may underlie this decrease.

The largest <b>licence</b> <b>holders</b> are Cabcharge Australia Ltd, which also {{operates}} the 13CABS network, and the Gange Corporation, which operates the Silver Top Taxis network. More than 60% of licences are assigned (or leased or rented) to taxi operators, who pay the <b>licence</b> <b>holder</b> assignment fees. These can fluctuate, and typically {{are in the}} order of $24,000 per annum. The operator owns, maintains and operates the taxi vehicle as well as the taximeter. Taxi operators may drive their taxis or may employ drivers. In June 2016 there were 14,771 active taxi drivers. Taxi drivers are required to be registered, and their registration certificate must be displayed in the taxi. A taxi operator can sell the taxi, comprising the assigned licence, vehicle and meter, as a going concern. Besides receiving the assignment fees from the taxi operator, <b>licence</b> <b>holders</b> also commonly benefit from capital growth in licence values, or carry the risk of a decline in the market value of a licence.|$|R
