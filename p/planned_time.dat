This study investigated what occurs during common <b>planning</b> <b>time</b> for two middle school level teams of teachers. A middle school level team of teachers in this study consisted of four teachers that shared a common <b>planning</b> <b>time</b> together at least {{four days a week}} and taught the same set of students. Student outcomes for middle level schools that implement common <b>planning</b> <b>time</b> are higher overall self-concept (Warren & Muth, 1995) and greater academic efficacy (Mertens, Flowers, & Mulhall, 1998). Teachers implementing common <b>plan</b> <b>time</b> report higher levels of job satisfaction (Flowers, Mertens, & Mulhall, 1999), and more positive interactions with their colleagues (Flowers, Mertens, & Mulhall, 1999). Schools report higher levels of student achievement (Flowers, Mertens, & Mulhall, 1998, 1999, and Mertens & Flowers, 2003). The benefits for students and staff that practice the common <b>plan</b> <b>time</b> are plentiful. This study investigated what occurs during common <b>plan</b> <b>time</b> for middle school level team of teachers in an effort to better understand the connections between what occurs during common <b>plan</b> <b>time</b> and student achievement. The methodology used in the development of this study was a qualitative case study of two middle level teams of teachers. Multiple data sources in the study include observations of common <b>plan</b> <b>time,</b> individual interviews of the interdisciplinary team of teachers, and document analysis of lesson plans. Specifically, one sixth grade team and one seventh grade team participated in the study with a total sample of eight teachers.

40|$|Working memory, which {{accounts}} for the ability to process information {{in the face of}} interference, is critical to second language acquisition (SLA) and use. The interaction of working memory capacity (WMC) with specific pedagogical interventions is a logical place for empirical SLA research, both to examine the cognitive processes underpinning second language performance and to identify instructional treatments that may differentiate learners based on their WMC. A good candidate for such an examination is <b>planning</b> <b>time,</b> a pedagogical intervention that {{has been the subject of}} extensive empirical research, which has, thus far, been largely unrelated to WMC. The study undertaken here considers WMC along with two different types of pre-task <b>planning</b> <b>time</b> (guided and unguided) as predictors of the accuracy, fluency, and complexity of learners' discourse. 	Ninety-two intermediate ESL students from seven classes at a community college participated in this study by completing two different working memory span tasks as well as two different "there-and-then" oral story-telling tasks. The treatment condition of the story-telling tasks was manipulated so that learners' performance could be considered in terms of provision of pre-task planning (± planning), type of planning (guided vs. unguided), and order of planning (planning first or planning second). The results demonstrate that the relationship among type of <b>planning</b> <b>time,</b> order of <b>planning</b> <b>time,</b> and WMC is complex. Task order had a clear effect on learners' production, regardless of the provision of <b>planning</b> <b>time.</b> When learners began the series of story-telling tasks under the + planning condition, their output on the subsequent, unplanned task varied according to whether they had first received guided or unguided <b>planning</b> <b>time.</b> In addition, guided <b>planning</b> <b>time</b> and unguided <b>planning</b> <b>time</b> also have very different effects on learners' production, with guided <b>planning</b> <b>time</b> promoting a focus on accuracy at the expense of complexity and unguided <b>planning</b> <b>time</b> fostering fluency. Finally, this study indicates that task conditions can affect learners with high and low WMC in different ways. Learners with high WMC are more likely to comply with complex story-telling instructions, improving their focus on grammatical form at the expense of fluency, whereas learners with low WMC are more likely to improve their fluency as a result of task repetition, regardless of the task conditions...|$|R
2500|$|In early 1944, the Allied air {{war began}} to focus {{primarily}} upon {{the destruction of the}} Luftwaffe in preparation for the invasion of Normandy. Plans for the so-called [...] "Big Week", which was intended to permanently smash the German capacity to produce fighter aircraft through targeted airstrikes on final assembly factories, were already underway in 1943. Between February 20–25, 1944, approximately 10,000 American and British aircraft, including about 6,000 bombers, attacked strategic targets all over Germany. Following these attacks, which seriously damaged German aircraft production, the production quota fell drastically. In response the Jägerstab (Fighter Staff) was founded in March 1944 with the task of ensuring the preservation and growth of fighter aircraft production. It superseded the Ministry of Aviation in this jurisdiction. At the head of the Jägerstab was armaments minister Albert Speer, as Deputy the Secretary of State Erhard Milch, as Chief of Staff Karl Saur. Their plan to protect the aircraft industry, especially the manufacture of the jet-powered Messerschmitt Me 262, entailed the relocation of assembly plants into underground bunkers. This idea was not entirely new, as a similar (but never realized) proposal had already been considered in October 1943. The Jägerstab's plan included six locations in which partially underground bunkers were to be built, and at first called for the bunkers to be encompass a minimum area of 600,000 to 800,000 m2 apiece. However, {{by the time of the}} Jägerstab meeting of 17 March 1944, the projected size of the each building had sunk to 60,000 m2. By June 1944 the invasion of the allies had forced the Jägerstab to focus in the end on two locations in Upper Bavaria. Three bunkers were to be built at Kaufering in the Landsberg am Lech district under the codename [...] "Ringeltaube" [...] (common wood pigeon), while the codename [...] "Weingut I" [...] (Vineyard I) was chosen for the factory in the [...] According to the testimony of Franz Xaver Dorsch, who was responsible for the construction, the fighter factory would be completed in five to six months at best.

This {{dissertation}} {{describes a}} microethnographic {{study of the}} induction of preschool children into the practices of schooled literacy at an ex-Natal Education Department, Anglican-affiliated preschool. The sources of data are participant observation and audio-recordings of <b>planning</b> <b>time</b> interaction; interviews with key informants; and site documentation. The principal finding {{of the study is}} that <b>planning</b> <b>time,</b> a seemingly inconsequential preschool event, differentially inducts children into literacy practices that anticipate expository reporting. Such literacy practices carry high prestige in Western capitalist society, being the recognised convention for presenting and contesting information. <b>Planning</b> <b>time</b> was originally designed as an intervention program to facilitate nonmainstream literacy acquisition by making the conventions explicit, thus minimising cultural and linguistic discontinuities between home and school-based literacy practices. However at Church Preschool, an essentially closed environment with access controlled by mechanisms such as waiting lists, this event has been co-opted to further maximise mainstream advantage. The data reveals that, despite a rhetoric of openness in making the norms explicit, <b>planning</b> <b>time</b> only inducts nonrnainstream children into elementary literacy practices. Beyond that point, the conventions become increasingly implicit and depend on shared knowledge of mainstream norms. <b>Planning</b> <b>time</b> functions as a covert gatekeeping event that effectively maintains the status quo by guarding access to powerful literacy practices. The tension between the rhetoric of openness and the reality of who gains mastery of the literacy practices suggests that <b>planning</b> <b>time</b> restricts access not on the level of entry, but at the point of acquisition...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study is to {{investigate}} the impact of the provision of <b>planning</b> <b>time</b> on oral task performance of second language learners. Previous studies report that planning prior to task performance has a facilitative role in learner 2 ̆ 7 s interlanguage development and positive effects on oral performance (Crookes, 1989; Ellis, 1987; Foster 2 ̆ 6 Skehan, 1996; Ortega, 1999). To date, research findings have suggested that providing second language learners with <b>planning</b> <b>time</b> results in more complex and fluent oral production (Crookes, 1989; Foster 2 ̆ 6 Skehan, 1996). However, the results concerning the accuracy of planned production are conflictive, and the positive effects of planning on accuracy have not yet been confirmed. ^ The present study compared planned and unplanned oral production of 61 Korean learners of Japanese at a post-beginner level with quantitative and qualitative analyses. The results suggested overall positive effects of <b>planning</b> <b>time,</b> especially on fluency, confirming the previous findings. However, being inconsistent with the findings of the previous research, syntactic complexity did not improve with the provision of <b>planning</b> <b>time.</b> In addition to objective measurement, the subjects 2 ̆ 7 production was rated to assess task completion and fluency. The subjective ratings also rendered evidence of planning effects. Moreover, individual differences on planning effects were found concerning a preference for <b>planning</b> <b>time,</b> the relationship between subjective feelings and planning effects, and an area of output quality which <b>planning</b> <b>time</b> influenced.
