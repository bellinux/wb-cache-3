25|$|In {{the case}} of <b>pathological</b> <b>gambling,</b> along with fluvoxamine, {{clomipramine}} has been shown effective in the treatment, with reducing the problems of <b>pathological</b> <b>gambling</b> in a subject by up to 90%. Whereas in trichotillomania, the use of clomipramine has again {{been found to be}} effective, fluoxetine has not produced consistent positive results. Fluoxetine, however, has produced positive results in the treatment of pathological skin picking disorder, although {{more research is needed to}} conclude this information. Fluoxetine has also been evaluated in treating IED and demonstrated significant improvement in reducing frequency and severity of impulsive aggression and irritability in a sample of 100 subjects who were randomized into a 14-week, double-blind study. Despite a large decrease in impulsive aggression behavior from baseline, only 44% of fluoxetine responders and 29% of all fluoxetine subjects were considered to be in full remission at the end of the study. Paroxetine has shown to be somewhat effective although the results are inconsistent. Another medication, escitalopram, has shown to improve the condition of the subjects of <b>pathological</b> <b>gambling</b> with anxiety symptoms. The results suggest that although SSRIs have shown positive results in the treatment of <b>pathological</b> <b>gambling,</b> inconsistent results with the use of SSRIs have been obtained which might suggest a neurological heterogeneity in the impulse-control disorder spectrum.|$|E

25|$|The {{inclusion}} of behavioral addictions like <b>pathological</b> <b>gambling</b> must change {{our way of}} understanding and dealing with addictions. Pathological (disordered) gambling has commonalities in clinical expression, etiology, comorbidity, physiology and treatment with substance use disorders (DSM-5). A challenge is to understand the development of compulsivity at a neurochemical level not only for drugs.|$|E
25|$|In adults {{side effects}} with greater than 10% {{incidence}} include weight gain, headache, agitation or anxiety, insomnia, and gastro-intestinal effects like nausea and constipation, and lightheadedness. Side effects in children are similar, and include sleepiness, increased appetite, and stuffy nose. A {{strong desire to}} gamble, binge eat, shop, and have sex may also occur. Cases of <b>pathological</b> <b>gambling</b> have been reported.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Pathological</b> <b>gambling,</b> in contrast, {{seems to}} involve many diverse aspects of impulsivity and {{abnormal}} reward circuitry [...] (similar to substance use disorders) {{that has led}} to it being increasingly conceptualized as a non-substance or behavioral addiction. Evidence elucidating the role of impulsivity in <b>pathological</b> <b>gambling</b> is accumulating, with <b>pathological</b> <b>gambling</b> samples demonstrating greater response impulsivity, choice impulsivity, and reflection impulsivity than comparison control samples. Additionally, pathological gamblers tend to demonstrate greater response perseveration (compulsivity) and risky decision making in laboratory gambling tasks compared to controls, though there is no strong evidence suggesting that attention and working memory are impaired in pathological gamblers. These relations between impulsivity and <b>pathological</b> <b>gambling</b> are confirmed by brain function research: pathological gamblers demonstrate less activation in the frontal cortical regions (implicated in impulsivity) compared to controls during behavioral tasks tapping response impulsivity, compulsivity, and risk/reward. [...] Preliminary, though variable, findings also suggest that striatal activation is different between gamblers and controls, and that neurotransmitter differences (e.g. dopamine, serotonin, opioids, glutamate, norepinephrine) may exist as well.|$|E
30|$|The <b>pathological</b> gambler often <b>gambled</b> {{after work}} playing casino table games {{at least four}} times a week.

Eight gamblers found their gambling had remained the same. One reported giving up gambling outside work hours after the suicide of a patron.|$|R
30|$|DSM IV-TR {{diagnostic}} criteria for <b>pathological</b> and problem <b>gambling</b> {{are essential for}} clinical practice, especially in psychiatry. In an epidemiological study or questionnaire survey, the presence of <b>pathological</b> and/or problem <b>gambling</b> is usually difficult to ascertain, if not impossible, as psychiatric diagnosis is usually not available. Simple screening or assessment tools are therefore available for classifying the respondents into “non-gambler”, “probable pathological gamblers” and “probable problem gamblers”, such as South Oaks Gambling Screen (SOGS) (Stinchfield, 2002), Problem Gambling Severity Index (PGSI) (Loo et al., 2011), and Canadian Problem Gambling Index (CPGI) (Ferris & Wynne 2001). SOGS is a 20 -item questionnaire, with a 3 – 4 score classified as “probable problem gambler,” and 5 or more score classified as “probable pathological gambler” (Stinchfield, 2002). Short SOGS, a more concise version of SOGS, is a 5 -item questionnaire with yes/no answers available for more rapid screening, and a score of 2 or above indicates <b>pathological</b> or problem <b>gambling</b> (Room et al., 1999). PGSI is a 9 -item questionnaire, with a 1 – 2 score as “low level of problems with few or no identified negative consequences”, a 3 – 7 score as “moderate level of problems leading to some negative consequences” and a 8 score as “problem gambling with negative consequences and a possible loss of control” (Loo et al., 2011). However, in literature, {{it is observed that}} there are still some papers using the terms of “pathological gambling” and “probable pathological gambling”, and “problem gambling” and “probable problem gambling” interchangeably in an incorrect manner, especially for those studies not in the areas of clinical or medical sciences (Pearce et al. 2008).|$|R
40|$|The {{perception}} of increased <b>pathological</b> and problem <b>gambling</b> is currently driving interest and concern among policymakers, treatment professionals, industry officials, gambling researchers, and the public. Data describing {{the extent of}} <b>pathological</b> and problem <b>gambling</b> are useful for many purposes, including planning public health services and medical services. This chapter discusses the prevalence of pathological and problem gamblers among the general U. S. population and specific subpopulations. As limited by the available data, the discussion is often framed {{in terms of the}} proportion of pathological and problem gamblers reported in studies of U. S. residents. Of particular concern is determining prevalence among reportedly vulnerable demographic groups, such as men, adolescents, the poor, the elderly, and minorities (including American Indians). We also attempt to examine trends in relation to the increased availability of legal gambling opportunities in the last decade. This chapter also makes comparisons with the prevalence rates of alcohol and drug abusers, to help put the magnitude of excessive gambling and related problems into perspective.

2500|$|Complications of late Parkinson's {{disease may}} include {{a range of}} impulse-control disorders, {{including}} eating, buying, compulsive gambling and sexual behavior. One study found that 13.6% of Parkinson's patients exhibited at least one form of ICD. There is a significant co-occurrence of <b>pathological</b> <b>gambling</b> and personality disorder, and is suggested to be caused partly by their common [...] "genetic vulnerability". The degree of heritability to ICD is similar to other psychiatric disorders including substance abuse disorder. There has also been found a genetic factor {{to the development of}} ICD just as there is for substance abuse disorder. The risk for subclinical PG in a population is accounted for by the risk of alcohol dependence by about 12-20% genetic and 3-8% environmental factors. There is a high rate of comorbidity between ADHD and other impulse-control disorders.|$|E
30|$|Research {{suggests}} that in countries with mature gambling markets, between 2 % and 5 % {{of the adult population}} may be engaged in problem or <b>pathological</b> levels of <b>gambling</b> (Productivity Commission, 2010; Volberg, 2007). People with gambling problems can experience considerable financial debt, physical and mental health problems, relationship breakdown, and legal and work-related problems {{as a result of their}} gambling (Hodgins et al., 2007; Productivity Commission, 2010; Patford, 2008; Pulford et al., 2009).|$|R
40|$|Psychological therapies {{have been}} {{proposed}} {{for the treatment of}} <b>pathological</b> and problem <b>gambling,</b> and this review summarised current evidence for these therapies. It included best-quality randomised trials, where therapy was compared with conditions including 'no treatment’ controls or referral to Gamblers Anonymous. It considered categories of therapy including: (1) cognitive-behaviour therapy (CBT); (2) motivational interviewing therapy; (3) integrative therapy; and (4) other psychological therapy. The search identified 14 studies and we combined data from these. Data from nine studies indicated benefits of CBT in the period immediately following treatment. However, there were few studies across longer periods of time (e. g. 12 months) after treatment, and little is known about whether effects of CBT are lasting. Data from three studies of motivational interviewing therapy suggested some benefits in terms of reduced gambling behaviour, but not necessarily other symptoms of <b>pathological</b> and problem <b>gambling.</b> However, the data come from few studies and conclusions regarding motivational interviewing therapy require further research. There were also few studies that provided evidence on integrative therapies (two studies) and other psychological therapies (one study), and there is currently insufficient data to evaluate the efficacy of these therapie...|$|R

This phenomenon seems to parallel the “Hispanic paradox” (Scribner 1996) documented in health outcome studies, where Hispanics have better health outcomes despite the challenges of low socioeconomic status and barriers to accessing healthcare (Grant et al. 2004; Scribner 1996; Vega et al. 1998).|$|R
2500|$|Impulse control {{disorder}} (ICDs) are a {{class of}} DSM diagnoses that do not fall into the other diagnostic categories of the manual (e.g. substance use disorders), and that are characterized by extreme difficulty controlling impulses or urges despite negative consequences. [...] Individuals suffering from an impulse control disorder frequently experience five stages of symptoms: compelling urge or desire, failure to resist the urge, {{a heightened sense of}} arousal, succumbing to the urge (which usually yields relief from tension), and potential remorse or feelings of guilt after the behavior is completed. Specific disorders included within this category include intermittent explosive disorder, kleptomania, <b>pathological</b> <b>gambling,</b> pyromania, trichotillomania (hair pulling disorder), and impulse control disorders not otherwise specified (ICD NOS). ICD NOS includes other significant difficulties that seem to be related to impulsivity but do not meet the criteria for a specific DSM diagnosis.|$|E
2500|$|Psychopathology is {{the study}} of mental illness, {{particularly}} of severe disorders. [...] Informed heavily by both psychology and neurology, its purpose is to classify mental illness, elucidate its underlying causes, and guide clinical psychiatric treatment accordingly. [...] Although diagnosis and classification of mental norms and disorders is largely the purview of psychiatry—the results of which are guidelines such as the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, which attempt to classify mental disease mostly on behavioural evidence, though not without controversy—the field is also heavily, and increasingly, informed upon by neuroscience and other of the biological cognitive sciences. [...] Mental or social disorders or behaviours seen as generally unhealthy or excessive in a given individual, {{to the point where they}} cause harm or severe disruption to the sufferer's lifestyle, are often called [...] "pathological" [...] (e.g., <b>pathological</b> <b>gambling</b> or pathological liar).|$|E
2500|$|Craving has {{increasingly}} received attention {{as a critical}} phenomenon in addictive psychopathology. [...] Craving {{has been defined as}} [...] "the desire or the memory of a pleasant experience superimposed on a negative affective state". [...] Hence, conceptually, craving combines elements of desire/motivation and emotions. Pathologic gamblers with an addictive personality have been linked to high RD scores. <b>Pathological</b> <b>gambling</b> disorder (PGD) is defined as incessant and repetitive gambling behaviors that cause significant disruption in an individual's day-to-day life. The positive relation of gambling craving to depression and negative relation to reward dependence suggests that, individuals who have a lesser disposition to experience positive emotions are the ones who most miss gambling when abstaining. Meanwhile, pathologic gamblers seem to turn to gambling as a way to cope with depressive feelings and lack of positive experiences in life. Pathologic gamblers would potentially benefit from interventions targeting early relief of depression symptoms and replacement of the activity and joy once prompted by gambling.|$|E

The estimates of <b>pathological</b> and problem <b>gambling</b> among the university (college) students were 6.13 and 10.23 % respectively.

2500|$|Psychopharmacological {{intervention}} in disorders of impulsivity has shown evidence of positive effects; common pharmacological interventions {{include the use}} of stimulant medication, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and other antidepressants. ADHD has a well-established evidence base supporting the use of stimulant medication for the reduction of ADHD symptoms. <b>Pathological</b> <b>gambling</b> has also been studied in drug trials, and there is evidence that gambling is responsive to SSRIs and other antidepressants. [...] Evidence based pharmacological treatment for trichotillomania is not yet available, with mixed results of studies investigating the use of SSRIs, though Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) has shown positive effects. Intermittent Explosive Disorder is most often treated with mood stabilizers, SSRIs, beta blockers, alpha agonists, and anti-psychotics (all of which have shown positive effects). There is evidence that some pharmacological interventions are efficacious in treating substance use disorders, though their use can depend on the type substance that is abused.

30|$|Casino {{gambling}} {{is one of}} the popular forms of gambling among problem gamblers (Black and Moyer 1998; Fong and Ozorio 2005; Wong and So 2003), particularly for men (Blanco et al., 2006). It {{has been shown to be}} associated with a high risk of problem gambling (Welte, Wieczorek et al. 2004). High frequency of problem gambling among casino patrons is reported in Canada, United Kingdom and United States (Fisher, 2000; Fong et al., 2011; Ratelle et al., 2004). Among 89 pathological casino gamblers in South Korea, it is found that the subjects were characterized by emotional instability (anxiety, depression, rash spontaneous impulsivity, gambling symptom severity), and impaired reward sensitivity/drive (impulsiveness connecting a purposeful drive to obtain rewarding stimuli) (Lee et al., 2008). Co-morbidities in <b>pathological</b> casino <b>gambling</b> are common: alcohol addiction, tobacco addiction (Blanco et al., 2006; Pasternak and Fleming 1999), mood disorder, anxiety disorder and eating disorder (Lee et al., 2008).|$|R

30|$|The {{interview}} data uncovered several risk factors which {{might contribute to}} <b>pathological</b> and problem <b>gambling</b> among the casino employees. Individual factors were the male gender, having interest in gambling activities, being ambitious to get rich, having distorted cognitions about gambling skills and knowledge, being reliant on loans to solve financial problems, and denying problematic gambling. Workplace factors included shift work, lack of alternative entertainment to alleviate job stress, frequent exposure to gambling activities, easy access to gambling and loans, and influence of gambling promotions and gambling colleagues.
