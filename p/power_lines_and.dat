The storm has its greatest impact in Bermuda where high winds and near-record rainfall downed trees, <b>power</b> <b>lines</b> <b>and</b> caused flooding.

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{whether there}} is an interaction between distance from residence at birth to nearest <b>power</b> <b>line</b> <b>and</b> domestic radon and traffic-related air pollution, respectively, in relation to childhood leukemia risk. Further, we investigated whether adjusting for potential confounders alters the association between distance to nearest <b>power</b> <b>line</b> <b>and</b> childhood leukemia. We included 1024 cases aged < 15, diagnosed with leukemia during 1968 - 1991, from the Danish Cancer Registry and 2048 controls randomly selected from the Danish childhood population and individually matched by gender and year of birth. We used geographical information systems to determine the distance between residence at birth and the nearest 132 - 400 kV overhead <b>power</b> <b>line.</b> Concentrations of domestic radon and traffic-related air pollution (NOx at the front door) were estimated using validated models. We found a statistically significant interaction between distance to nearest <b>power</b> <b>line</b> <b>and</b> domestic radon regarding risk of childhood leukemia (p = 0. 01) when using the median radon level as cut-off point but not when using the 75 th percentile (p = 0. 90). We found no evidence of an interaction between distance to nearest <b>power</b> <b>line</b> <b>and</b> traffic-related air pollution (p = 0. 73). We found almost no change in the estimated association between distance to <b>power</b> <b>line</b> <b>and</b> risk of childhood leukemia when adjusting for socioeconomic status of the municipality, urbanization, maternal age, birth order, domestic radon and traffic-related air pollution. The statistically significant interaction between distance to nearest <b>power</b> <b>line</b> <b>and</b> domestic radon was based on few exposed cases and controls and sensitive to the choice of exposure categorization and might, therefore, be due to chanc...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} a new electrostatic discharge (ESD) protection scheme for IC with power-down-mode opera-tion. Adding a VDD ESD bus <b>line</b> <b>and</b> diodes into the proposed ESD protection scheme can block the leakage current from I/O pin to VDD <b>power</b> <b>line</b> <b>and</b> avoid malfunction during power-down operation. The whole-chip ESD protection design {{can be achieved}} by insertion of ESD clamp circuits between VSS <b>power</b> <b>line</b> <b>and</b> both the VDD <b>power</b> <b>line</b> <b>and</b> VDD ESD bus line. Experiment results show that the human-body model (HBM) ESD level of this new scheme can be greater than 7. 5 kV in a 0. 35 - m silicided CMOS process.

5|$|Xangsane {{made its}} second and final {{landfall}} in central Vietnam, causing severe flooding and strong winds that caused nearly 10 trillion Vietnamese đồng ($629million, 2006USD) in damage and killed 71people.

5|$|After its {{unexpected}} redevelopment over Oklahoma, widespread {{damage was}} also reported there. Several communities in central Oklahoma were flooded {{due to the}} heavy rainfall.

5|$|Between the hurricane's two landfalls, Dean {{affected}} {{an estimated}} 207,800people {{in the states}} of Quintana Roo, Campeche, Veracruz, Hildalgo, Puebla and Tabasco. The storm damaged 85miles (140km) of <b>power</b> <b>lines</b> <b>and</b> left more than 100,000people without electricity.

5000|$|The {{decoupling}} capacitor works as the device’s local energy storage. The capacitor is placed between <b>power</b> <b>line</b> <b>and</b> {{ground to the}} circuit that current is to be provided.
