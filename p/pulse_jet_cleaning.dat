We {{measured}} the filter cleaning performance using these rigs {{and the results were}} compared in order to characterize the two testing methods. The filter performance tests showed that the filter cleaning efficiency measured with VDI type- 1 rig is higher than that with JIS rig. During <b>pulse</b> <b>jet</b> <b>cleaning,</b> JIS rig gave a higher peak pressure and a shorter time period of pulse jet compared to VDI type- 1 rig. A new filtration model was applied to the filtration cycles with the two rigs and it was shown that the difference in filter cleaning performance measured by VDI type- 1 and JIS rigs can be expressed in terms of the surface cleaning fraction, which is the ratio of cleaned surface area to the total surface area of a filter, and the residual dust load on the un-cleaned surface after cleaning. © 2007...|$|E
40|$|Background & Objectives : Cutting {{leads to}} {{production}} of different hazardous agents such as fumes, particles, gases and vapors. In various studies, {{the effects of}} fumes, gases, and vapors on workers and environment have been proved. Meanwhile, cutting alloying plates with plasma cutting machine due to containing various alloy materials produces a lot of air pollution. Therefore, using the ventilation system to remove the mentioned pollution has always been noteworthy. Method: This study was performed on plasma cutting machine at Mobarakeh Steel Company. At first, according to ASTM the elements from alloy plates with optical emission spectrometry crm- 35000 -quantometery were detected, the air pollution from cutting the mentioned plates was sampled and measured using NIOSH 7300 method {{and according to the}} ACGIH:VS- 72 - 20, VS- 70 - 12, VS- 70 - 11 VS- 916 push-pull ventilation with bag filter collector was designed. Results: Results of sampling from pollution of cutting the alloy material, concentration of iron, lead and cadmium fumes were more than the standard limits. After calculation for push system, air flow volume of 195. 163 cfm, outgoing air velocity of 5937. 4 fpm and for pull system air flow volume of 12498 cfm, minimum duct velocity of 3000 fpm and velocity pressure of duct of 0. 717 inwg, for fan, total pressure of 6. 301 inwg, static pressure of 0. 587 inwg and power of 20. 65 Bhp and for collector with <b>pulse</b> <b>jet</b> <b>cleaning</b> system air to cloth ratio of 7 and dimensions of 6. 88 ft × 6. 56 ft × 9. 84 ft were obtained.

40|$|Abstract: The dynamic {{pressure}} characteristics of <b>pulse</b> <b>jet</b> pipe, <b>pulse</b> <b>jet</b> nozzles and ceramic filter {{can be measured}} by high-frequency {{dynamic pressure}} sensor. The research {{is focused on the}} influence of cleaning pressure, the diameter of nozzles, and the ratio of sectional area of nozzles to that of <b>pulse</b> <b>jet</b> pipe on <b>pulse</b> <b>cleaning</b> performance. The results show that the difference of <b>pulse</b> <b>jet</b> nozzles performance increases when cleaning pressure increases. The main reason leading to the difference of pulse cleaning is that the increasing rate of static pressure along cleaning direction is slow after the first large increase. The diameter of <b>pulse</b> <b>jet</b> nozzles has a significance affect on cleaning performance so that the uneven performance can be improved by decreasing the diameter of nozzle along the cleaning direction ladder likely. The ratio of sectional area of nozzles to that of the <b>pulse</b> <b>jet</b> pipe is a key factor in cleaning performance, and the best range of the ratio of sectional area of nozzles to that of the <b>pulse</b> <b>jet</b> pipe in the research is from 45 % to 55 %...|$|R

40|$|The in-pipe {{cleaning}} robot (IPCR) is a {{new equipment}} for pipelines cleaning. However, most existing in-pipe robots are used to inspection and simple maintenance, etc. They cannot effectively complete the pipelines cleaning works, especially large diameter pipelines.

The whole mechanisms of the proposed IPCR are designed and a novel preload mechanism is applied to guarantee the IPCR reach to the target operation distance.

40|$|Hot gas {{particulate}} filtration is a {{basic component}} in advanced power generation systems such as Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) and Pressurized Fluidized Bed Combustion (PFBC). These systems require effective particulate removal to protect the downstream gas turbine and also to meet environmental emission requirements. The ceramic barrier filter {{is one of the}} options for hot gas filtration. Hot gases flow through ceramic candle filters leaving ash deposited on the outer surface of the filter. A process known as surface regeneration removes the deposited ash periodically by using a high pressure back <b>pulse</b> <b>cleaning</b> <b>jet.</b> After this <b>cleaning</b> process has been done there may be some residual ash on the filter surface. This residual ash may grow and this may lead to mechanical failure of the filter. A High Temperature Test Facility (HTTF) was built to investigate the ash characteristics during surface regeneration at high temperatures. The system is capable of conducting surface regeneration tests of a single candle filter at temperatures up to 1500 F. Details of the HTTF apparatus as well as some preliminary test results are presented in this paper. In order to obtain sequential digital images of ash particle distribution during the surface regeneration process, a high resolution, high speed image acquisition system was integrated into the HTTF system. The regeneration pressure and the transient pressure difference between the inside of the candle filter and the chamber during regeneration were measured using a high speed PC data acquisition system. The control variables for the high temperature regeneration tests were (1) face velocity, (2) pressure of the back pulse, and (3) cyclic ash built-up time...|$|R
