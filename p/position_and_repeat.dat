50|$|In 1998, he {{competed in}} the Porsche Supercup (the most {{competitive}} mono-brand championship {{in the world to}} date) where apart from the extreme competitiveness and the excellent level of the drivers, he was still able to continue to roll in front of the F1 teams, since all races were disputed in the same events as the “Master” discipline.After a first time of adaptation, very common for almost all the pilots coming from the Formulas, he began to enter regularly in the top 10. In 1999 he maintained himself in the same championship and began the year with a Pole Position and a second place in the Australian event taken place at the Melbourne circuit. He even leads the championship but once again, a wide range of accidents removed the Portuguese driver from the leading position. Stays in the Porsche Supercup for two more seasons. In 2001 he embraced a new project, this time with Miguel Pais do Amaral in the GT Spanish Championship. In spite of the excellent results that were achieved in 2001, 2002 and 2003, it was in 2004 that everything began to run in a more consistent way, which allowed the duo to achieve the title of Vice-champions in the GT Iberic Cup and the third place in the GT Spanish Championship. In 2007, about to celebrate 25 years of his career, he decides along with Manuel Gião to compete in the GT Spanish Championship. The partnership could not have been better: several podiums, Iberian GT Champions and Vice-Champions of Spain. The following year, again with Gião, he decides to climb one more step and face the International GT Open, commonly named the European GT, and get the third place in the Championship in addition to the team title (PlayTeam Ferrari) along with M. Maceratesi and Andrea Montermini. In 2009 they remain in the same Championship but exchange the Ferrari for the team Porsche Official Italy (Autorlando). They finish the season in the fourth final <b>position</b> <b>and</b> <b>repeat</b> the title by teams, this time together with G.Roda and Richard Lietz. In the 2010’s season, Pedro Couceiro remains at the International GT Open but this time in the GT3 category and with the Kessel team. After a few mishaps he obtains the fifth place in the championship even though {{he had been in the}} title fight until very close to the end of the season.|$|E

The usual method was to infiltrate small units, from a platoon of fifty men to a company of 200, split into separate detachments. While one team cut off the escape route of the Americans, the others struck both the front and the flanks in concerted assaults.

The "sky" covers one-sixth of the vault, while the "sun" is fixed: therefore the model is rotated to reproduce the entire vault and rotated and tilted to reproduce the relative sun-Earth position. In the paper the different components of the structure are shortly described, the possible fields of application are presented and, {{as an example of}} daylighting assessments, the results of a case study are reported.

The PIV baseline configuration measurements show good agreement with mean flow field data as well as existing PIV data acquired at NASA Glenn.

5000|$|On the island, Jack plays a {{key role}} in the {{survival}} of his fellow survivors in the immediate aftermath of the crash, instructing others to help those with injuries and using his medical background to assist the wounded. The survivors look to Jack as their leader; however, he is reluctant to embrace the <b>position</b> <b>and</b> <b>repeats</b> his father's rationale that he does not [...] "have what it takes". Exhausted from tending the wounded, attempts to rescue drowning survivors and sleep-deprived, Jack begins chasing hallucinations of his father in the jungle. He drops his skepticism when he finds his father's coffin but it is empty. Struggling to cope with demands made by the castaways, he meets John Locke in the jungle, who provides some guidance for Jack's leadership. Jack returns to the beach camp and gives a speech on how they are going to live on the island and tells them about the caves; one part of his speech—"live together, die alone"—becomes a mantra amongst the survivors. Through his medical tending and visibility within the camp, Jack quickly develops many personal relationships with the castaways, most notably finding a romantic interest in Kate Austen, a right-hand man in Hurley Reyes (Jorge Garcia) and a mutual respect for former military torturer Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews).|$|R

30|$|The {{conductance}} of the Ag-molecule-Ag junctions {{was measured}} by repeatedly forming and breaking the molecular junctions on the modified Nanoscope IIIa STM (Veeco Instruments, Inc., Plainview, NY, USA), and the process was described in detail in our previously reports (Figure  1 b) [9, 28]. To achieve this process, Ag was continuously electrodeposited onto the STM tip. Then, the deposited tip was pulled {{far away from the}} substrate about several tens of nanometers with the STM feedback disabled. Next, the tip was driven towards the surface until a certain tip current was reached; the atoms of the deposited metal on the tip would transfer to the substrate upon the application of a pulse on the z-piezo of STM, and this is the so-called jump-to-contact process. Atomic-sized wire of the deposited metal could be obtained by pulling the tip out of the contact. Lastly, the molecular junctions with the deposited metal as electrode were formed after breaking of the atomic-sized metal wire. Conductance curves were recorded at the same time. Then, we moved the tip to other <b>positions</b> <b>and</b> <b>repeated</b> the whole process. Typically, large conductance traces were obtained, and hundreds from thousands traces with clear stepwise features were selected to get a statistical result. The selection rate is around 15 %, which is similar as that of pyridyl-Cu contact in an acidic solution in our previously report [28]. The low selection rate may be caused by the protonated pyridyl group [28]. All experiments were carried out at a fixed bias voltage of 50 mV.|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND—The {{mechanism}} {{of death in}} {{sudden infant death syndrome}} (SIDS) remains unclear. Progressive bradycardia is the pre-eminent terminal event, suggesting that circulatory failure might be a crucial factor. Vasomotor tone regulates the circulatory system by controlling blood volume distribution while maintaining venous return and blood pressure.  AIM—To examine whether prone sleeping, the most consistently identified risk factor for SIDS, has a measurable influence on vasomotor/circulatory control.  METHODS— 44 full term infants (mean age, 7. 9 weeks) were studied during an overnight sleep. Recordings were made while the infants were horizontal and asleep in the supine <b>and</b> prone <b>positions,</b> <b>and</b> <b>repeated</b> after a head up tilt to 60 °, maintained for 30 minutes, while in both sleep positions. Blood pressure, heart rate, anterior shin, and anterior abdominal wall skin temperatures were measured.  RESULTS—Systolic blood pressure was lower, but peripheral skin temperature and heart rate were higher during sleep, while horizontal, in the prone rather than the supine position. After tilting, there was a greater reduction in blood pressure and a greater increase in peripheral skin temperature and heart rate when in the prone position. Anterior abdominal wall skin temperature did not vary in either sleeping positions while horizontal or tilted.  CONCLUSION—Prone sleeping has a measurable effect on circulatory control, with a reduction in vasomotor tone resulting in peripheral vasodilatation, a higher peripheral skin temperature, a lower blood pressure, and a higher resting heart rate. Because vasomotor tone is crucially important in circulatory control this could be a factor in increasing the risk of SIDS. ...|$|R
