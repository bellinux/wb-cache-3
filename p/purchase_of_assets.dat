40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the share of}} investment in fixed capital and working capital financed by retained earnings using a harmonized dataset from the World Bank Enterprise Survey. The sample includes firms across countries in Latin America and the Caribbean. Descriptive statistics are presented for the share <b>of</b> <b>purchases</b> <b>of</b> fixed <b>assets</b> financed with internal funds or retained earnings, the share of working capital financed with internal funds, the ratio between internal funds used for purchasing fixed assets and sales, and annual <b>purchases</b> <b>of</b> fixed <b>assets</b> (as a proportion of annual sales). Also presented are stylized facts exploring how these variables differ by country, firm size, firm age, registration, sector of activity, and ownership. It is found that internal funds are extensively used to finance both <b>purchases</b> <b>of</b> fixed <b>assets</b> and working capital, particularly by smaller firms located in countries with less developed financial markets. Investment in fixed assets represents about 7. 5 percent of sales {{in the region and}} is significantly higher among larger and registered firms...|$|R

Thus, they reason, the model is highly vulnerable to the perhaps inevitable decreases in the real estate and financial markets.|$|E

Jim Crockett Promotions took over production of the TV show using the same set..

A long-distance telephone company based in Fairfield, Iowa with 350,000 customers around the world, Telegroup was in Chapter 11 bankruptcy before Primus purchased their assets for $72 million.

40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{a model of}} banking fragility driven by aggregate liquidity shortages. Inefficiencies arise because liquidity smoothing across banks breaks down when {{there is such a}} shortage, causing unnecessary and value-reducing transfer of assets between banks. We find that a Lender of Last Resort policy is ineffective in restoring efficiency as it leads to offsetting changes in the banks’ supply of liquidity. In contrast, subsidizing the <b>purchase</b> <b>of</b> <b>assets</b> from troubled banks increases welfare by improving the banks’ liquidity holdings. The first best, however, is achieved by redistributing liquidity from healthy to troubled banks in a crisis...|$|E
