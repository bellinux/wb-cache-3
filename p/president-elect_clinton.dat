It concerns a dear friend of mine who is no longer with us. His name is Ryan White. He was a hemophiliac who was diagnosed with the AIDS virus when he was eleven. He died shortly after turning eighteen, the very time most young people are beginning to explore life's wonderful possibilities. My friend Ryan was a very bright, very brave, and very normal young man who never wanted to be a symbol or a spokesperson for a deadly disease. Over the years, I've shared many silly, happy, and painful moments with Ryan and I was with him {{at the end of his}} brief but eventful journey. Ryan is gone and just as anyone who has lost a loved one to AIDS, I miss him deeply and constantly. He is gone, but I want his life to have meaning beyond his passing. It is my hope, <b>President-elect</b> <b>Clinton,</b> that you and your administration commit the resources needed to eliminate this awful disease that took my friend, and ended so many promising lives before their time. This song is for you Ryan". - Michael Jackson, January 1993.|$|E

Help them always to see the office to which they’ve been elected as a sacred trust from you. We pray that you will bless their wives who will share {{so much of the}} responsibility and burdens. Make <b>President-elect</b> <b>Clinton</b> know that he is never really alone but that the eternal God can be his refuge and he can turn to you in every circumstance. Give him the wisdom you’ve promised to those who ask and the strength that you alone can give. We thank you for his predecessor President Bush and the dedication he gave to this office. Bless him as he and Mrs. Bush continue their dedicated service to our country in other spheres. We commit this inaugural ceremony to you and ask that the memory of this event may always remind us to pray for our leaders. I pray this {{in the name of the}} one that’s called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, the Everlasting Father and the Prince of Peace. Amen.” ...|$|E

5000|$|The Treaty of Ruby Valley was {{a treaty}} {{signed with the}} Western Shoshone in 1863, giving certain rights to the United States in the Nevada Territory.

The agreement allows the U.S. president to designate reservations, but does not tie this to land cessions." [...] As late as December 1992, the Western Shoshone were still disputing the terms of this treaty {{with the federal government}} and <b>President-Elect</b> <b>Clinton.</b> As of 2006, most of the Western Shoshone tribal councils had refused to settle for a payment of $145 million to transfer 25 million acres (101,000 km²) of their traditional territory to the United States; this settlement was authorized by Congress in 2004. They feared that accepting payment would be considered to extinguish their land claims.|$|E

40|$|The {{investment}} tax credit (ITC) allows firms to reduce their tax liability by an amount related to their expenditures on equipment, and thus reduces the cost of acquiring capital. An {{investment tax}} credit can be introduced temporarily to stimulate investment {{as part of a}} countercyclical fiscal policy or permanently as part of a strategy to enhance capital formation, raise labor productivity, and so speed longer-term economic growth. The discussion in this paper will focus mainly on the permanent ITC, although it will include some comments on the temporary version. As this paper is being written, <b>President-elect</b> Bill <b>Clinton</b> is widely expected to propose an ITC (of some sort) to Congress soon after taking office. Since the federal deficit continues to constrain fiscal policy, attention has been focused on designing an ITC that delivers the greatest stimulus per dollar loss of revenue. ...|$|R

Three days later, Clinton's Treasury Secretary, Lloyd Bentsen, announced her appointment to the post in an acting capacity. To formally hold the post, Munnell needed to be confirmed by the U.S. Senate. Several Republican Senators reacted negatively to the nomination, citing her views on taxing pensions. The pension industry also criticized the nomination. Nonetheless, she had the support of some Republican Senators, including David Durenberger, the ranking member of the Finance Committee, and her confirmation hearing before that committee in May 1993 was uncontroversial. She was confirmed later that month by a voice vote following floor debate in which several Republicans reiterated objections to the pension tax proposal.|$|R

[...] Clinton later wrote that he had not known her, but that Chiles had recommended her highly and Gore had requested she be named. [...] The pick, along with several others of Gore protégés that Clinton made, helped solidify the vice president's position within the administration.
