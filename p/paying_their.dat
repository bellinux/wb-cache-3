5|$|A {{few days}} after Noether's death her friends and {{associates}} at Bryn Mawr held a small memorial service at College President Park's house. Hermann Weyl and Richard Brauer traveled from Princeton and spoke with Wheeler and Taussky about their departed colleague. In the months that followed, written tributes began to appear around the globe: Albert Einstein joined van der Waerden, Weyl, and Pavel Alexandrov in <b>paying</b> <b>their</b> respects. Her body was cremated and the ashes interred under the walkway around the cloisters of the M. Carey Thomas Library at Bryn Mawr.|$|E
5|$|After the {{suspicious}} {{death of his}} wife Drogo fled England, and the castle was reassigned by William the Conqueror to Odo, the Count of Aumale. In 1096 it passed to Arnulf de Montgomery, but returned to the Aumales in 1102, who held it until 1221. Trade initially flourished and as a result William le Gros founded the fortified town of Skipsea Brough along the ridgeway just south of the castle, probably around 1160. The town was intended to bring in valuable revenue to the earls, but would also have helped to defend the castle on its most vulnerable, overlooked side. The castle-guard system lapsed, with the surrounding estates <b>paying</b> <b>their</b> rents in cash instead.|$|E
5|$|In early 1869, Johnson {{identified}} {{the need for}} a school for the blind in the new state of West Virginia; with statehood, deaf and blind West Virginia children attended schools for the deaf and blind in neighboring states (with West Virginia <b>paying</b> <b>their</b> tuition). Johnson began corresponding with West Virginia Governor William E. Stevenson, canvassing across the state to arouse public sentiment in support of a school for the blind. Despite rebukes from prominent West Virginian politicians, Johnson became the leading advocate for a state institution for the blind. He and other educated blind people staged an exhibition in the legislative chamber of the West Virginia House of Delegates, which was praised by the legislators.|$|E

Mussolini was laid to rest in a large stone sarcophagus. The tomb is decorated with fascist symbols and contains a large marble head of Mussolini. In front of the tomb is a register for visitors <b>paying</b> <b>their</b> respects to sign. The tomb has become a neo-fascist place of pilgrimage. The numbers signing the tomb's register range from dozens to hundreds per day, with thousands signing on certain anniversaries; almost all the comments left are supportive of Mussolini.|$|E
5|$|A 2016 study led by Harvard University health {{economics}} professor Benjamin Sommers found that residents of Kentucky and Arkansas, which both accepted the Medicaid expansion, {{were more likely}} to receive health care services and less likely to incur emergency room costs or have trouble <b>paying</b> <b>their</b> medical bills than before the expansion. Residents of Texas, which did not accept the Medicaid expansion, did not see a similar improvement during the same period. Kentucky opted for increased managed care, while Arkansas subsidized private insurance. The new Arkansas and Kentucky governors have proposed reducing or modifying their programs. Between 2013 and 2015, the uninsured rate dropped from 42% to 14% in Arkansas and from 40% to 9% in Kentucky, compared with 39% to 32% in Texas. Specific improvements included additional primary and preventive care, fewer emergency departments visits, reported higher quality care, improved health, improved drug affordability, reduced out-of-pocket spending and increased outpatient visits, increased diabetes screening, glucose testing among diabetes patients and regular care for chronic conditions.|$|E
5|$|Although the British were victorious {{over the}} French in the war, King George III's {{government}} {{felt that the}} North American colonies were not <b>paying</b> <b>their</b> way, since little direct tax revenue from the colonies was received. The Sugar Act of 1764 had its greatest effect in New England and did not cause widespread objection. The Stamp Act the following year affected all 13 colonies, as it required revenue stamps to be used on papers required in trade and in the law. When word of passage of the Stamp Act reached Williamsburg, the House of Burgesses passed the Virginia Resolves, asserting that Virginians had {{the same rights as}} if they resided in Britain, and that they could only be taxed by themselves or their elected representatives. The Resolves were mostly written by a fiery-spoken new member for Louisa County, Patrick Henry.|$|E

5|$|Broad Channel is a {{small island}} with fewer than 3,000 residents, and as a result, it has {{historically}} {{been one of the}} least-used stations in the system. In 1985, the station had only 224 paying daily riders on a typical weekday not counting farebeaters (people not <b>paying</b> <b>their</b> fare) {{making it one of the}} least used stations in the system. The station has the second-lowest ridership in the subway system as of 2015, with 91,766 annual riders, or 310 riders per weekday. In terms of annual ridership, it was only trailed by Cortlandt Street, a station that is closed to be rebuilt as a result of damage from the September 11 attacks. Overall, Broad Channel is the least used of any fully operating subway station in the city, although on weekdays it has on average 5 more riders than the Beach 105th Street station. However, it is the only transfer point between the A train and the Rockaway Park Shuttle, and some 2,700 daily riders use it in this capacity. As a result, the platforms are sometimes packed.|$|E
5|$|By the 18th century, {{the prison}} had {{separate}} areas for its {{two classes of}} prisoner: the master's side, which housed about 50rooms for rent, and the common or poor side, consisting of nine small rooms, or wards, into which 300people were confined from dusk until dawn. Room rents on the master's side were ten shillings a week in 1728, with most prisoners forced to share. John Baptist Grano paid 2s 6d (two shillings and six pennies) for a room with two beds on the master's side, shared with three other prisoners: Daniel Blunt, a tailor who owed £9, Benjamin Sandford, a lighterman from Bermondsey who owed £55, and a Mr. Blundell, a jeweller. Women prisoners who could pay the fees were housed in the women's quarters, known as the oak. The wives, daughters and lovers of male prisoners were allowed to live with them, if someone was <b>paying</b> <b>their</b> way.|$|E
5|$|In 1883 Blackburn Olympic, a team {{composed}} {{mainly of}} factory workers, {{became the first}} Northern team to win the FA Cup, {{and the next year}} Preston North End won an FA Cup match against London-based Upton Park. Upton Park protested that Preston had broken FA rules by <b>paying</b> <b>their</b> players. In response, Preston withdrew from the competition and fellow Lancashire clubs Burnley and Great Lever followed suit. The protest gathered momentum to the point where more than 30 clubs, predominantly from the North, announced that they would set up a rival British Football Association if the FA did not permit professionalism. A schism was avoided in July 1885 when professionalism was formally legalised in English football. The Football League was founded in 1888, and marked its independence from the London-based Football Association by establishing headquarters in Preston – the League retained a Northern identity even after it accepted several Southern teams into its ranks. Intense local derbies between neighbouring teams mean that there is less of a North–South rivalry than in some other sports.|$|E

Corral shootout, this final incident may have been misunderstood by the McLaurys. While Wyatt and Virgil were still out of town for the Spence and Stilwell hearing, Frank McLaury confronted Morgan Earp, telling him that the McLaurys would kill the Earps if they tried to arrest Spence, Stilwell, or the McLaurys again.|$|E
