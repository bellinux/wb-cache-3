40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} if discrepancies existed in the views of principals, supervising teachers, and Chapter I <b>paraprofessionals</b> regarding the actual and ideal role behavior of Chapter I <b>paraprofessionals.</b> The study also sought to determine if there were discrepancies between <b>paraprofessionals</b> 2 ̆ 7 knowledge of role content and role behavior. In addition, the differences among certain biographical variables: age, sex, education, experience, certification and role knowledge of the <b>paraprofessionals</b> were examined. The study was conducted during the 1988 - 89 school year. A questionnaire based on the job description of Chapter I <b>paraprofessionals</b> was developed by the researcher and mailed to randomly selected principals, supervising teachers, and Chapter I <b>paraprofessionals</b> in the elementary schools of a large metropolitan school system. The sample included 27 principals, 46 supervising teachers, and 46 <b>paraprofessionals.</b> Given a list of role behavior tasks on the questionnaire, the respondents were asked to identify actual duties performed by Chapter I <b>paraprofessionals,</b> give frequencies of duties, and indicate ideal duties that should be performed by the <b>paraprofessionals.</b> The <b>paraprofessionals</b> were also asked to complete a role knowledge questionnaire and demographic checklist of biographical variables. There was an 82 percent return of completed questionnaires. FINDINGS Significant differences were found in the views of principals, supervising teachers, and the <b>paraprofessionals</b> themselves regarding ideal role behavior of <b>paraprofessionals.</b> Significant differences were found between the views of Chapter I <b>paraprofessionals</b> concerning their actual role behavior and their role knowledge. A significant difference was found among age groups of <b>paraprofessionals</b> regarding role knowledge. It was recommended that administrators, supervising teachers, and Chapter I <b>paraprofessionals</b> be more involved in the planning, implementation, and evaluation of the Chapter I program.

40|$|Improving {{educational}} outcomes involves many variables, including identifying effective interventions {{and ensuring that}} they are effectively implemented in schools. Within a 2 ̆ 2 response to intervention 2 ̆ 2 model, treatment integrity of academic interventions has become increasingly important. However, recent {{research has suggested that}} ensuring treatment integrity by instructional staff may require intensive coaching, including daily or weekly performance feedback. This system may be unsustainable in typical schools because of limited resources for supervision. Some studies have found that treatment integrity can be achieved with intense prior training that includes extensive practice followed by feedback in the training setting. Fluency-based instruction has the advantage of providing multiple practice opportunities in a relatively short amount of time. A fluency training package for <b>paraprofessionals</b> using the Corrective Reading: Decoding curriculum was evaluated in a multiple baseline design across individuals. The primary dependent variables included <b>paraprofessionals</b> 2 ̆ 7 presentation rate and praise rate. Additional dependent variables included <b>paraprofessionals</b> 2 ̆ 7 accuracy in presenting error correction procedures, ratio of positive to negative comments, students 2 ̆ 7 on-task behavior, and word reading accuracy. Participants included five <b>paraprofessionals</b> delivering supplemental reading instruction to students in small groups, and one student from each of the <b>paraprofessionals</b> 2 ̆ 7 groups. We provided five hours of fluency training to <b>paraprofessionals</b> over five days in a group setting. Following fluency training we observed <b>paraprofessionals</b> during a maintenance phase. <b>Paraprofessionals</b> generally increased their presentation rates, praise rates, and percentage of accurate error correction steps with fluency training. Three <b>paraprofessionals</b> with variable positive-to-negative comments ratios decreased this variability during fluency training. We subsequently provided performance feedback if a <b>paraprofessionals</b> 2 ̆ 7 presentation rate or praise rate did not maintain at criterion levels. Four of the five <b>paraprofessionals</b> required performance feedback on at least one skill. Performance feedback had mixed effects on <b>paraprofessionals</b> 2 ̆ 7 skills. Most students maintained adequate word reading accuracy throughout the study, with no clear effects when interventions for <b>paraprofessionals</b> were introduced and withdrawn.

Due to factors including technological advances, budget cuts, reorganizations, downsizing, outsourcing, expanded roles of professionals {{and changes in the}} information world, the workload among professionals and <b>paraprofessionals</b> has been redistributed in technical services in academic libraries.

Objectives To investigate the effectiveness of any kind of psychological treatment for anxiety and depressive disorders performed by <b>paraprofessionals</b> compared with professionals, waiting list or placebo condition. To examine whether the results apply to clinically significant anxiety and depressive disorders of referred patients with a psychiatric history and/or whose illness has lasted two years or more. Search strategy CCDANCTR-Studies using the following terms: (paraprofessional* or para-professional* or non-professional* or non-professional* or peer or volunt*); EMBASE (ExerptaMedica), MEDLINE and PsycINFO, all years published, key words: para-/paraprofessional, non-/nonprofessional, rand*, respectively psy*; citation lists of articles reviewing the subject and included studies; correspondence with authors of controlled studies and review reports on the subject. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials that used symptom measures, and compared the effects of psychological treatments given by <b>paraprofessionals</b> ({{mental health care}} workers, paid or voluntary, unqualified with respect to the psychological treatment) with psychological treatments given by professionals, and with waiting list or placebo condition. Data collection and analysis The standard mean difference was used to pool continuous data from each trial, and odds ratios were used to pool dichotomous data, using a random effects model. The generic inverse variance method was used for combining continuous and dichotomous data. The effect of low quality studies and the use of self-rated versus observer-rated measures were tested, and subgroup analyses were performed for differences between depression and anxiety diagnosis, <b>paraprofessionals</b> with/without professional background, group/individual intervention, length of follow-up and gender (post-hoc subgroup analysis). Main results Five studies, all using self-report measures, reported five comparisons of <b>paraprofessionals</b> versus professionals (n= 106) and five comparisons of <b>paraprofessionals</b> versus control condition (n= 220). No differences were found between <b>paraprofessionals</b> and professionals (SMD= 0. 09, 95 % CI - 0. 23 to 0. 40, p= 0. 58; no significant heterogeneity). Studies comparing <b>paraprofessionals</b> versus control reported mixed continuous and dichotomous data showed a significant pooled effect in favour of <b>paraprofessionals</b> (OR= 0. 34, 95 % CI 0. 13 to 0. 88, p= 0. 03), but heterogeneity was indicated (I- 2 = 60. 9 %, Chi(2) = 10. 24, df= 4, p= 0. 04). After correction for heterogeneity and removing one study of low quality, the pooling of data from three studies (n= 128; mixed gender and women only) indicated no significant difference in effect between <b>paraprofessionals</b> and professionals (SMD= 0. 13, 95 % CI - 0. 39 to 0. 64; p= 0. 63) and a strongly significant pooled effect for three studies (n= 188; women only) favouring <b>paraprofessionals</b> over the control condition (OR= 0. 30, 95 % CI 0. 18 to 0. 48, p Authors' conclusions The few studies included in the review did not allow conclusions about the effect of <b>paraprofessionals</b> compared to professionals. Pooling data from three studies, involving women only, indicated a significant effect for <b>paraprofessionals</b> (all volunteers) compared to no treatment.
