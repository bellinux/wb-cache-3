25|$|The Type 87 Chi-I had a Type 90 57mm cannon as {{its main}} armament, with one machine {{gun in the}} front hull glacis and another located in a small rear turret. The armour was riveted steel plates with a minimum {{thickness}} of 6mm and a maximum of 17mm. The engine compartment was located {{in the middle of}} the hull and the tank was powered by a V8 gasoline engine. The tank chassis had a complex <b>parallelogram</b> <b>suspension</b> system with two pairs of road bogie wheels per leaf spring arrangement. Hara later designed a bell crank scissors suspension which paired the bogie wheels and connected them to a coil spring mounted horizontally outside the hull. This suspension became standard on the majority of the subsequently designed Japanese tanks and can be seen on the Type 95 Ha-Go light tank and Type 97 Chi-Ha, as examples.|$|E

5000|$|Whereas a {{chain-driven}} bike would [...] "squat" [...] at {{the rear}} under acceleration, a shaft drive machine would do the opposite, causing the seat (and rider) to rise upwards, a phenomenon known as [...] "shaft-jacking". This anti-intuitive sensation can be disconcerting to riders, and <b>parallelogram</b> <b>suspensions</b> seek to neutralize such unwelcome torque reactions.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, a {{tangential}} drive (Tdrive) polysilicon, {{linear actuator}} is presented which produces large magnitude tangential motion by flexing a microstructure in an essentially straight line with moderate input voltage. These devices have been designed, fabricated, and successfully tested to have substantial displacements even for static positioning. The working {{principle of the}} T-drive is that the strong electrostatic forces of attraction between a fixed bar and a free bar are converted to large amplitude tangential motion by the <b>parallelogram</b> flexural <b>suspension</b> of the free bar. Operating devices are capable of tangential displacements as great as 32 pm. This displacement is stable and easily varied, since the tangential displacement can be controlled by adjusting the potential between the fixed electrode and the traversing bar. Static displacements are detectable for voltages as low as 15 VDC. Typical T-drives have free bars 200 m long, 12 pn wide, with flexural suspensions 450 pn long and 2 pm wide. All component thicknesses are 2 pn. Theoretical models for both the flexural suspension and electrostatic forces have been derived and they predict the relation between tangential displacement and excitation voltage...|$|R

40|$|A {{prototype}} {{test device}} is proposed by {{taking into account}} the structural and mechanism characteristics of the 2 -DOF panoramic camera platform. The device is composed of a compensating arm, parallelogram hanging apparatus, counterweights with wires, and force sensors. The device is designed to compensate the platform using a <b>parallelogram</b> <b>suspension</b> mechanism which realized the stability of the counterweight. In this paper, the mechanism of the <b>parallelogram</b> <b>suspension</b> system is analysed, and the influence of non-synchronous motion and the eccentric on the accuracy of gravity compensation and other index is deduced. At last, the device is verified by experiments...|$|E
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{program was}} initiated in the High Speed Water Tunnel to measure force coefficients for hydrofoils under cavitating conditions. This program necessitated either a new force balance or a major {{modification of the}} existing one. Various balance configurations and pressure seal designs which were considered are described. A balance modification design was selected which consists of an appendage bolted between the existing balance and the water tunnel working section. This appendage alters the basic geometry of the force balance so that the model is now mounted on a parallelogram linkage instead of on a simple pivoted lever. The addition of the <b>parallelogram</b> force table <b>suspension</b> to the old balance renders the modified balance unresponsive to moments which in the old balance, interacted with forces and resulted in errors in the force readings. This modification which is described in detail was accomplished and resulted in a successful force balance capable of accurate measurement of forces on cavitating and noncavitating hydrofoils; and, in fact, {{it is expected to}} replace the old force balance for all force measurement work in the High Speed Water Tunnel. The cost and construction time for the balance modification were considerably less than would have been required for an entirely new force balance of comparable accuracy and sensitivity...|$|R
