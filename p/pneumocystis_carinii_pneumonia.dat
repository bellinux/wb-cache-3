5|$|AIDS {{was first}} {{clinically}} observed in 1981 in the United States. The initial cases were {{a cluster of}} injection drug users and gay men with no known cause of impaired immunity who showed symptoms of <b>Pneumocystis</b> <b>carinii</b> <b>pneumonia</b> (PCP), a rare opportunistic infection that was known to occur in people with very compromised immune systems. Soon thereafter, additional gay men developed a previously rare skin cancer called Kaposi's sarcoma (KS). Many more cases of PCP and KS emerged, alerting U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and a CDC task force was formed to monitor the outbreak.

She flew back to Denmark, where tests at Copenhagen's Rigshospitalet discovered she had contracted a number of opportunistic infections, such as Staphylococcus aureus (staph infection), candidiasis (yeast infection), and Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PCP, a fungal infection of the lungs formerly known as <b>Pneumocystis</b> <b>carinii</b> <b>pneumonia).</b> Tests also showed that Rask had a nearly non-existent T-cell count, leading to a severely depressed immune system.

40|$|Host {{defenses}} are profoundly compromised in HIV-infected hosts due to progressive depletion of CD 4 + T lymphocytes.

Other microorganisms have been shown to infect AIDS patients simultaneously with Pc, but whether one opportunist is able to directly influence the pathogenicity of another has not been determined previously. We have deliberately coinfected scid mice (with extant Pc infection) with a variety of primarily pneumotropic viruses and bacteria and have identified pneumonia virus of mice as causing a dramatic increase in the density of Pc organisms and the morbidity due to PCP in immunodeficient scid mice. This finding has clinical significance in the management of PCP, in that the identification and treatment of coinfecting pneumotropic pathogens may be as important as treatment targeted at Pc.

40|$|In a {{total of}} 723 sera from 52 kidney graft {{recipients}} and 23 organ donors the serum concentrations of MRP 8 / 14 were retrospectively measured by an enzyme immunoassay in one run. The {{aim of this study}} was to find out quantitative changes of the MRP 8 / 14 serum levels in connection with characterized events after kidney transplantation (KTx). In the pre-KTx sera tested the mean MRP 8 / 14 level was 6. 7 ± 3. 5 µg/ml (reference value, 6. 08 ± 2. 22 µg/ml; upper normal level [x + 2 s], 10. 96 µg/ml). In 7 out of 52 recipients without intraoperative ATG prophylaxis the MRP 8 / 14 level rose within the reference range to 10. 2 ± 6. 2 at the first post-KTx day. In contrast, the intraoperative T cell depletion by means of antilymphocytic antibodies caused a significant increase of the MRP 8 / 14 level to 21. 2 ± 12. 5 µg/ml. In recipients with immediate (n= 14) or delayed (n= 11) graft function without any other complications all post-KTx values - except the post-KTx peak - were within the reference range. In 10 prednisolone-sensitive and 14 prednisolone-resistant rejection episodes no diagnostically usable changes of the MRP 8 / 14 levels could be found except in one antibody-mediated accelerated rejection. Also, in 6 recipients with cytomegalovirus infection, the detection of pp 65 positive peripheral blood cells was not associated with alterations of the MRP 8 / 14 serum level. In contrast, significant elevations of the MRP 8 / 14 levels were found in gram-positive bacteremia as well as in superinfected (CMV, soor) <b>pneumocystis</b> <b>carinii</b> <b>pneumonias.</b> In most cases the changes of MRP 8 / 14 levels were comparable with those described for the lipopolysaccharide-binding protein, but in simultaneous determinations no correlation (R 2 = 0. 067) could be found between the concentrations of both proteins at the same day.

In contrast, trimetrexate exhibited rapid uptake.
