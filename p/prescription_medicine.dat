He was allowed to return to full professional activity from September 11, 2006, and the money prizes acquired before the suspension were restored.

25|$|In the U.S, the National Report Card on Adherence rates Americans {{with chronic}} medical {{conditions}} with a grade C+ on adherence to their medication and this contributes {{to an estimated}} cost of $290 Billion annually. Increase in patient medication cost share {{was found to be}} associated with low adherence to medication. The United States is among the countries with the highest prices of prescription drugs which is one of factors leading to the high healthcare costs. This is mainly attributed to the government's lack of ability to negotiate lower prices with monopolies in the pharmaceutical industry especially with the brand name drugs. In order to manage the medication costs, many patients on long term therapies fail to fill their prescription or skip or reduce doses. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation survey in 2015, approximately three quarters (73%) of the public think the drug prices are unreasonable and blame pharmaceutical companies for setting prices so high. In the same report, half of the public reported that they are taking prescription drugs and “quarter (25%) of those currently taking <b>prescription</b> <b>medicine</b> report they or a family member have not filled a prescription in the past 12 months due to cost, and 18 percent report cutting pills in half or skipping doses”. In comparison to Canada, only 8% of adults reported to have skipped their doses or not filling their prescriptions due to the cost of their prescribed medications.|$|E
2500|$|Major {{barriers}} to compliance {{are thought to}} include the complexity of modern medication regimens, poor [...] "health literacy" [...] and lack of comprehension of treatment benefits, the occurrence of undiscussed side effects and poor treatment satisfaction, the cost of <b>prescription</b> <b>medicine,</b> and poor communication or lack of trust between the patient {{and his or her}} health-care provider. [...] Efforts to improve compliance have been aimed at simplifying medication packaging, providing effective medication reminders, improving patient education, and limiting the number of medications prescribed simultaneously. Current studies show a great variation in terms of characteristics and effects of interventions to improve medicine adherence. It is still unclear how adherence can consistently be improved in order to promote clinically important effects.|$|E

2500|$|Not {{only are}} tissues from maggots {{used to detect}} toxins, shed casings and insect feces have also been used to detect and {{identify}} toxins present in corpses upon death. [...] An instance of {{this finding was demonstrated}} by Edward McDonough, a medical examiner in Connecticut. [...] A mummified corpse of a middle-aged woman was found inside of her home. [...] <b>Prescription</b> <b>medicine</b> bottles were found with labels identifying the following drugs: ampicillin, Ceclor, doxycyline, erythromycin, Elavil, Lomotil, pentazocine, and Tylenol 3. [...] McDonough performed toxicological analyses on stomach contents and dried sections of brain and found lethal levels of amitriptyline and nortriptyline. [...] Insect feces, shed pupal cases of Megaselia scalaris (Diptera: Phoridae), and shed larval skins of Dermestes maculates (Coleoptera: Dermestidae) were gathered from the corpse at the scene. [...] McDonough sent these to an FBI lab which broke down the complex structures of the samples using strong acids and bases and freed the toxins for analysis. [...] The cast pupal cases and larval skins were also found to contain amitriptyline and nortriptyline. [...] Larger concentrations were discovered in the pupal cases because phorid flies prefer to feed on softer tissues. [...] The hide beetle larval skins revealed lower concentrations of the drugs because these beetles prefer to feed on dry, mummified bodies. [...] The use of pupal cases and larval skins allows for investigators to detect toxins in a body years after death.|$|E

40|$|In {{light of}} the {{economic}} reality, which is increasingly confirmed by relevant judicial authorities, we submit that hindering parallel trade in <b>prescription</b> <b>medicines</b> does not damage patients and national health budgets. It is therefore to be welcomed that both Community and national case law has confirmed that pharmaceutical companies are entitled to adopt measures responding to – but not prohibiting or eliminating – parallel trade, and such measures are not contrary to the EC competition rules. Parallel traders had previously been free-riding on case law which referred to sectors and cases that bore {{no relation to the}} special features of the European <b>prescription</b> <b>medicines</b> sector. To the extent there is an assumption that parallel trade in Europe safeguards intra-brand competition, the recent case law does not call this assumption into question: on the contrary, it confirms it, while noting that this assumption is inapplicable to the <b>prescription</b> <b>medicines</b> sector in Europe precisely because of that sector’s very specific features. It is therefore to be hoped that the long-running obsession of European competition law with parallel trade in <b>prescription</b> <b>medicines</b> may (at last) be coming to an end. ...|$|R
