5|$|Many of {{the later}} 20th-century composers, such as John Cage, John Corigliano, and Steve Reich, Miguel del Aguila, used modernist and minimalist techniques. Reich {{discovered}} a technique known as <b>phasing,</b> <b>in</b> which two musical activities begin simultaneously and are repeated, gradually drifting out of sync, creating a natural sense of development. Reich was also very interested in non-Western music, incorporating African rhythmic techniques in his compositions. Recent composers and performers are strongly influenced by the minimalist works of Philip Glass, a Baltimore native based out of New York, Meredith Monk, and others.|$|E

With this announcement, Burger King became the first American Fast food company to promise to purchase 100% of its eggs from companies that did not utilize wire battery cages and pork from suppliers that did not use gestational cages for sows. This is an increase of the percentage of cage free products from 9% of egg purchases and 20% of pork purchases the company made in 2008. The plan should be completed by 2017.|$|E

Braathens had 33 daily departures, SAS had 22 and Widerøe had 20. Of Braathens' services, 14 were to Oslo, 15 to cities on the West Coast (of which four were operated by Norwegian Air Shuttle) and four were to Bodø, Harstad/Narvik and Tromsø. SAS operated 15 daily flights to Oslo, while eight were operated to Bodø, Harstad/Narvik and Tromsø. One flight was to their main hub in Copenhagen.

Orange is used for bonus sections (section E or above), which are published occasionally such as for business travel trends and the Olympics; other bonus sections for sports (such as for the PGA Tour preview, NCAA Basketball Tournaments, Memorial Day auto races (Indianapolis 500 and Coca-Cola 600), NFL opening weekend and the Super Bowl) previously used the orange color, but now use the red designated for sports in their bonus sections.

2500|$|Phasing is {{a popular}} effect for {{electric}} guitar. The term was often {{used to refer to}} the original tape flanging effect heard on many psychedelic records of the late 1960s, notably [...] "Itchycoo Park" [...] (1967) by the Small Faces. In 1968, Shin-ei's Uni-Vibe effects pedal, designed by audio engineer Fumio Mieda, incorporated phase shift and chorus effects, soon becaming favorite effects of guitarists such as Jimi Hendrix and Robin Trower. By the early 1970s, phasing was available as a portable guitar effect, one of the most notable early examples being the MXR Phase 90. From 1974, Steve Hackett in the Selling England by the Pound (1973) studio album and tour used this one for his Les Pauls, and from The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway (1974) album and tour used the [...] "phase filter" [...] section in his EMS Synthi Hi-Fli. In the late 1970s, Brian May used large amounts of <b>phasing,</b> <b>in</b> such songs as [...] "Sheer Heart Attack". In the late 1970s and 1980s, Eddie Van Halen, for instance, often used the MXR Phase 90 as part of his signal chain, for example in the instrumental [...] "Eruption" [...] and on the song [...] "Atomic Punk". In the 1990s, Jonny Greenwood of Radiohead used an EHX Small Stone phaser extensively, particularly on tracks such as [...] "Paranoid Android" [...] and [...] "The Tourist" [...] from OK Computer (1997).|$|E
