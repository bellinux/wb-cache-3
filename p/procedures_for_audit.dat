40|$|Abstract Background In 2003, the National Institute of Mental Health {{funded the}} Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Trials Network (CAPTN) under the Advanced Center for Services and Intervention Research (ACSIR) mechanism. At the time, CAPTN was {{believed}} to be both a highly innovative undertaking and a highly speculative one. One reviewer even suggested that CAPTN was "unlikely to succeed, but would be a valuable learning experience for the field. " Objective To describe valuable lessons learned in building a clinical research network in pediatric psychiatry, including innovations intended to decrease barriers to research participation. Methods The CAPTN Team has completed construction of the CAPTN network infrastructure, conducted a large, multi-center psychometric study of a novel adverse event reporting tool, and initiated a large antidepressant safety registry and linked pharmacogenomic study focused on severe adverse events. Specific challenges overcome included establishing structures for network organization and governance; recruiting over 150 active CAPTN participants and 15 child psychiatry training programs; developing and implementing procedures for site contracts, regulatory compliance, indemnification and malpractice coverage, human subjects protection training and IRB approval; and constructing an innovative electronic casa report form (eCRF) running on a web-based electronic data capture system; and, finally, establishing <b>procedures</b> <b>for</b> <b>audit</b> trail oversight requirements put forward by, among others, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Conclusion Given stable funding for network construction and maintenance, our experience demonstrates that judicious use of web-based technologies for profiling investigators, investigator training, and capturing clinical trials data, when coupled to innovative approaches to network governance, data management and site management, can reduce the costs and burden and improve the feasibility of incorporating clinical research into routine clinical practice. Having successfully achieved its initial aim of constructing a network infrastructure, CAPTN is now a capable platform for large safety registries, pharmacogenetic studies, and randomized practical clinical trials in pediatric psychiatry. </p...|$|E

From the factors of this complex structure–education policy, corresponding ministry and services, higher education institutions, schools, and others–we have decided to choose the future teachers as a key link in educational process. Given the fact that education is an open process that continuously strives for modernization, we were interested in correlating the acquired knowledge and its application in class teaching. The initiative came from the previous data about the status of the subject music education in which is evident its low positioning in the entire educational system. The targets were the students (N 115) of the Pedagogical faculty in Skopje in the last phase of studies who had passed the methodologies of all subjects, as well as the pedagogical probationary period implemented compulsorily in the primary school. The results showed that teaching and study programs (textbooks, music equipment, etc.) directly influenced the shaping and organizing the class teaching. Also, the subjective treatment of the music education among the respondents proved to be decisive in practical application. However, research results have opened a general dilemma about the need to implement the compulsory <b>procedures</b> <b>for</b> <b>auditing</b> the overall acquired knowledge during the studies at the employment in educational institutions.

Based on halo theory from the performance evaluation literature, we hypothesized that auditors who (1) performed (did not perform) strategic assessment and (2) developed favorable (unfavorable) viability assessments during strategic assessment, would be less (more) likely to adjust account- level risk assessments for inconsistent fluctuations. Data from two laboratory experiments using experienced auditors supported both hypotheses. Findings suggest that the halo effect from strategic assessment influences judgment by altering auditor tolerance for inconsistent fluctuations. We found no evidence that strategic assessment diminished the level of effort or attention that auditors devoted to analyzing changes in accounts...|$|R

40|$|The {{ingredients}} for an effective automated audit {{of a building}} design include a BIM model containing the design information, an electronic regulatory knowledge model, and a practical method of processing these computerised representations. There have been numerous approaches to computer-aided compliance audit in the AEC/FM domain {{over the last four}} decades, but none has yet evolved into a practical solution. One reason is that they have all been isolated attempts that lack any form of standardisation.

40|$|We {{decided to}} examine the {{services}} provided by doctors in an inner London practice for domiciliary care. It was expected that the study would highlight the most relevant questions and variables related to access and uptake of this service; it would thus contribute {{to the design of}} an accurate <b>procedure</b> <b>for</b> <b>auditing</b> the pattern of delivery of home care to be conducted in the practice in the future. During the study period, 1976 - 81, there were 90 500 doctor-patient contacts. For patients up to the age of 10 years the proportion of home visits was 9. 2 %, falling to 2. 2 % in the age group 20 to 29; then there is a quasi plateau till the age of 60. After 60 the proportion of home visits doubles in each of the following 10 year age groups, reaching 54 % in the over 80 s. The proportion of home visits (standardised by age) rises from social class II (8. 0 %) to social class V (10. 0 %), but is higher in social class I (11. 7 %). The proportion of home visits according to distance from the practice rises from 8. 2 % near the health centre to 9. 6 % at a distance of 0. 25 to 0. 50 mile, and drops to 8. 8 % beyond 0. 75 mile. The distance effect is not consistent when the social class dimension is added: social classes I and II have higher proportions of home visits in certain age and distance groups. Single people have the lowest proportion of home visits (6. 8 %); there are large {{differences between men and women}} among widowed (14. 1 % and 8. 6 % respectively) and divorced or separated (7. 0 % and 10. 7 % respectively) patients. There are important variations in the proportions of home visits made by the doctors in the practice, the trainees carrying out proportionally many more home visits.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D. (Mechanical Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2004. A {{rapid growth}} in the {{national}} electricity demand is placing an ever-increasing demand on the national electricity supply utility, Eskom. Projections show that the load demand in South Africa may exceed the installed capacity by as early as 2007. This is mainly due {{to the increase in}} demand in the residential sector {{as a result of the}} electrification of rural and previously disadvantaged communities. However, the industrial and commercial sectors also have a role in this increase. In an attempt to reduce the demand for electricity Eskom has adopted its Demand Side Management (DSM) initiative. This initiative is aimed at lowering the electricity demand in peak times through energy efficiency (EE) or load shift, out of peak demand times. Eskom is implementing the DSM strategy by financing Energy Service Companies (ESCOs) to reduce the demand load of major electricity end-users during peak times. Buildings consume a large percentage of the total energy supply in the world. Most of the energy consumed in buildings is used by the heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems, as well as lighting. However, a large potential for energy savings exists in buildings. Studies have shown that up to 70 % of the electricity consumption of a building can be saved through retrofit studies. However, to capitalise on these opportunities, the ESCOs require tools and procedures that would enable them to accomplish energy savings studies quickly and efficiently. It should be a holistic approach to the typical ESCO building audit. A study of current available software programs showed the lack of holistic tools aimed specifically at retrofit audits, and therefore also the need for such a program. The building simulation program most suited to the retrofit study was chosen and it was used in a retrofit audit. By emulating a retrofit audit with this software, its performance in the field, both positive and negative, could be established. With the experience gained from the retrofit study, as well as input from ESCOs in the industry, a need for such a retrofit tool was established. The simulation program that was tested in the retrofit study is the tool Quickcontrol, as well as the newer version of the program, entitled QEC. The case study showed that even though these packages are well suited to ESCO work, they have certain drawbacks in view of the holistic project approach. The ESCOs require a simple, fast, and integrated <b>procedure</b> <b>for</b> energy <b>audits.</b> This <b>procedure</b> should be embodied in a software program. This study proposes a new integrated <b>procedure</b> <b>for</b> energy <b>audits</b> and the analyses of buildings, in the form of a software tool. This new tool is geared towards the ESCO building audit, in both South A 6 ica and internationally. It is designed to enable a diplomate engineer to accomplish a building energy and retrofit analysis in two weeks, leading the user through all the main project steps, from data acquisition to writing of the final project report. This is a significant improvement, since it normally takes 50 man-days for an experienced and trained engineering team to complete a full building audit. This tool was used in a case study to test its validity and accuracy. It was found that certain situations would arise in which the criteria that were set for the program would not be adequate. The results from the case study were favourable and satisfied the criteria that were set <b>for</b> the <b>procedure.</b> Doctora...|$|R
