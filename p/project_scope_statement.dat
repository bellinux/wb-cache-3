40|$|M. Tech. In the {{volatile}} telecommunication industry, innovation {{is the key}} to success. Mobile Telephone Network South Africa (MTN SA) needs to launch new products and services consistently to stay on the competitive edge. Consequently, effective project management becomes the key to gaining the competitive advantage by turning new product or service concepts into reality. According to Nokes and Kelly (2007 : 153 – 156), there is a high correlation between project success and effective <b>project</b> <b>scope</b> management. The effectiveness of <b>project</b> <b>scope</b> management can drastically affect the success of projects, as changes to the <b>project</b> <b>scope</b> may severely affect the project value creation, timeline, quality and cost. Accordingly, high <b>project</b> <b>scope</b> management maturity would contribute tremendously to the effectiveness of project management. The purpose of this present research is to define a roadmap to guide MTN’s Business Optimisation (BO) department to <b>project</b> <b>scope</b> management excellence. To meet this aim, the researcher utilises the concept of a Project Management Maturity Model (PMMM), as a guideline {{for the creation of a}} <b>project</b> <b>scope</b> management maturity model. The created <b>project</b> <b>scope</b> management maturity model is then utilised to provide an effective means to measure MTN SA’s <b>project</b> <b>scope</b> management maturity and identify the gaps prohibiting MTN SA from <b>project</b> <b>scope</b> excellence (Kerzner, 2004 : 193). Based on the literature review on the elements of <b>project</b> <b>scope</b> excellence, this paper suggests that there is a general misunderstanding regarding the definition of maturity. Many believe that process rigorousness indicates maturity, and have forgotten the criticality of the organisational culture that fosters an environment for <b>project</b> <b>scope</b> excellence and the effective use of the <b>project</b> <b>scope</b> process. iii This research offers a comparative study on the most popular and effective maturity models in the market, to identify the models that truly contribute to <b>project</b> <b>scope</b> management success and excellence. Finally, the research tailors the models to a <b>project</b> <b>scope</b> management focused maturity model, to assess MTN SA’s <b>project</b> <b>scope</b> management maturity from all aspects, and proposes a roadmap toward <b>project</b> <b>scope</b> management excellence...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a mixed methodological research approach for identifying practitioner {{perceptions of the}} most useful project management (PM) practices to improve project management performance. By identifying the perceived most useful tools and techniques, as having the most potential for increased contribution to project management performance, practitioners and organizations can select their priorities when improving PM practices. The research involved a programme of thirty interviews with Project Management professionals in Portugal, followed by a global survey. Completed questionnaires were received from 793 practitioners worldwide, covering 75 different countries. The {{results showed that the}} top twenty of the list of the most useful tools and techniques is composed of very well-known and widely used tools, such as: progress report; requirements analysis; progress meetings; risk identification; and <b>project</b> <b>scope</b> <b>statement.</b> PM practices in the top of list cover the overall PM life cycle from initiation to project closing, but particular relevance is given to tools and techniques from planning.

Due to the distinct nature and attributes associated with it, Software <b>project</b> <b>scope</b> creep {{has been identified as}} a major risk in software development through various surveys conducted. <b>Project</b> <b>scope</b> management is considered to be the first phase in terms of <b>project</b> management. The <b>scope</b> states what the objectives of the project are and what work will be done to accomplish the <b>project.</b> The <b>scope</b> describes the parameters of what is included in a project and what is excluded from a project. Failing to manage the <b>project</b> <b>scope</b> affects all the other subsequent stages. This survey-based study focuses on identifying the factors that affect software <b>project</b> <b>scope</b> creep in Sri Lankan software development companies. Factors affecting <b>project</b> <b>scope</b> creep were identified and were tested to ascertain their validity, importance and the causes in terms of the Sri Lankan context using an interview based questionnaire. Thirty two software development companies that belong to the software export association were chosen and forty two project managers from these organizations were selected for data collection. Using a statistical tool, the data gathered was analyzed to ascertain the significance to the research objectives. The factors in software <b>project</b> <b>scope</b> creep were identified and presented in the descending order according to the 'factor rank. The lack of change management user participation and management commitment from the customers' part are considered as most prominent reasons for the software <b>project</b> <b>scope</b> creep...|$|R

Change {{management}} {{is a crucial}} component in the daily activities inherent within the civil engineering industry, which if used effectively, can mitigate the impact of <b>project</b> <b>scope</b> changes and be beneficial to {{the life cycle of}} the a <b>project.</b> <b>Project</b> <b>scope</b> changes regularly occur during the construction phase of civil engineering projects, and normally result in severe disruptions. Although scope changes during the implementation phase are avoided where possible, their existence is a practical reality. These changes can be managed by a Change Management System (CMS) that can minimize the impact of these changes. This dissertation investigates different change management systems, which are used by major companies to mitigate the impact of <b>project</b> <b>scope</b> changes. Case studies on change management systems are provided, and {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} these systems are discussed. These change management systems were used as a reference axis for a newly proposed <b>project</b> <b>scope</b> change management system, namely the Proactive Change Management Database System (PACMDS). The PACMDS was developed by the author, to minimize the impact of scope changes in civil projects.

Moreover, software scope verification is crucial in the process of delivering exactly what the customer requested and minimizing <b>project</b> <b>scope</b> changes. Well defined software scope eases the process of scope verification and contributes to project success. Furthermore, a deliverable-oriented WBS provides a road map to a well defined software scope of work. It is on the basis of this that this paper extends the use of deliverable-oriented WBS to that of scope verification process. This paper argues that a deliverable-oriented WBS is a tool for software scope verification...|$|R
