40|$|PURPOSE: To compare hand-assisted laparoscopic donor {{nephrectomy}} and <b>pure</b> laparoscopic <b>live</b> donor nephrectomy {{techniques in}} live donor nephrectomy. METHODS: In this retrospective study, we included all patients submitted to hand-assisted laparoscopic donor nephrectomy and <b>pure</b> laparoscopic <b>live</b> donor nephrectomy between May 2002 and December 2007. The operative data and post-operative courses were reviewed. Information was {{collected on the}} operative time, warm ischemia time, estimated blood loss, intra-operative complications, time to first oral intake, length of hospital stay, and post-operative complications. The {{data were analyzed using}} Student's t -tests and Fisher exact tests as appropriate, with statistical significance defined as p < 0. 05. RESULTS: The means of the operative duration, warm ischemia time and intra-operative bleeding were 83 min, 3. 6 min and 130. 9 cc, respectively, for hand-assisted laparoscopic donor nephrectomy, and 78. 4 min, 2. 5 min and 98. 9 cc, respectively, for <b>pure</b> laparoscopic <b>live</b> donor nephrectomy (p= 0. 29, p< 0. 0001 and p= 0. 08, respectively). Intra-operative complications occurred in 6 % of patients submitted to hand-assisted laparoscopic donor nephrectomy and in 4. 5 % of those submitted to <b>pure</b> laparoscopic <b>live</b> donor nephrectomy (p= 0. 68). Only one patient from each group required conversion to open surgery; one person receiving hand-assisted laparoscopic donor nephrectomy had bleeding and one person receiving <b>pure</b> laparoscopic <b>live</b> donor nephrectomy had low carbon dioxide levels during the warm ischemia period. Compared with patients receiving hand-assisted laparoscopic donor nephrectomy, patients submitted to <b>pure</b> laparoscopic <b>live</b> donor nephrectomy were able to take their first meal earlier (12. 5 vs. 9. 2 hours, p= 0. 046), were discharged home sooner (2. 8 vs. 1. 4 days, p< 0. 0001) and had fewer post-operative complications (7. 5 % vs. 0. 6 %, p= 0. 04). CONCLUSIONS: <b>Pure</b> laparoscopic <b>live</b> donor nephrectomy had some advantages over hand-assisted laparoscopic donor nephrectomy in terms of the warm ischemia time, time to first oral intake, length of hospital stay, and post-operative donor complications...|$|R

40|$|Dormant {{bermudagrass}} (Cynodon dactlyon (L.) Pers. × C. transvaalensis Burtt-Davy) is overseeded with {{perennial ryegrass}} (Lolium perenne L.) to maintain green color through {{the fall and}} winter. Annual bluegrass (Poa annua L.) control is critical for overseeding success, as this weed can greatly decrease aesthetic quality and playability of turfgrass due to excessive seedhead production. Research was conducted to evaluate the infl uence of pre-seeding cultural practices (scalping, solid-tine aerifi cation, vertical mowing, and vertical mowing plus scalping) on overseeding establishment. The effect of increasing overseeding rates of perennial ryegrass (111, 222, 444, and 888 kg <b>pure</b> <b>live</b> seed·ha– 1; 100, 200, 400, and 800 lb·A– 1) and roughstalk bluegrass (Poa trivialis L.) (55, 111, and 222 kg <b>pure</b> <b>live</b> seed·ha– 1; 50, 100, and 200 lb·A– 1) on annual bluegrass populations was also investigated. Additionally, plant growth regulators (PGRs) were evaluated for annual bluegrass seedhead suppression and turf injury. Mefl uidide at 0. 056 kg ae·ha– 1 (0. 05 lb ae·A– 1), and paclobutrazol, fl urprimidol, trinexapac-ethyl, and trinexapac-ethyl plus ethephon at 0. 28, 0. 42, 0. 382, and 0. 095 plus 3. 82 kg ai·ha– 1 (0. 25, 0. 37, 0. 34, 0. 085 plus 3. 4 lb ai·A– 1), respectively, were applied twice, sequentially with a four-week interval. Contrary to previous research, pre-seeding cultural practices did not improve overseeding success. Annual bluegrass density decreased with increasing perennial ryegrass overseeding rates from 50 % in the non-overseeded to 14 to 17 % when overseeded with rates up to 222 kg <b>pure</b> <b>live</b> seed·ha– 1, and 4 to 8 % when overseeded with rates between 444 and 888 kg <b>pure</b> <b>live</b> seed·ha– 1.

Overseeding bermudagrass with roughstalk bluegrass or perennial ryegrass increased turfgrass green cover during winter, especially 100 days after seeding. Paclobutrazol, flurprimidol, and trinexapac-ethyl were successful at suppressing annual bluegrass seedheads and were not injurious to perennial ryegrass. Mefluidide resulted in efficient annual bluegrass seedhead suppression; however, unacceptable turfgrass injury occurred in 2012...|$|E

40|$|Annual grass {{invasion}} in the Great Basin has increased fire size, frequency and severity. Post-fire restoration to provide functional native plant communities {{is critical to}} improve resistance to weed invasion. Our ability to successfully re-establish mixtures of native grasses, forbs and shrubs, however, is limited. We {{examined the effects of}} the standard rangeland drill and a minimum-till drill, seeding strategies for small-seeded species, and Wyoming big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata Nutt. spp. wyomingensis Beetle 2 ̆ 6 Young) seeding rates on seeding success in burned shrub communities at four sites in the northern Great Basin. Seeded and recovering vegetation, as well as soil physical and chemical characteristics, were monitored for two growing seasons following treatment. In addition, provision was made for long-term evaluation of grazed and non-grazed seedings to assess community dynamics in relation to management practices. Results underscore the impact of precipitation and recovering residual species on seeded species emergence and establishment. Emergence of drill seeded species was generally enhanced when seeded through the rangeland drill compared to the minimum-till drill, but this effect was lost by the second year. Wyoming big sagebrush emergence was erratic, but tended to be greater when seeded through the minimum-till drill at moderate or high rates (approximately 250 and 500 <b>pure</b> <b>live</b> seed m- 2) compared to the low rate (50 <b>pure</b> <b>live</b> seed m- 2). Cheatgrass and other exotics were reduced and basal gap lengths decreased where native seedings established or residual natives recovered, but both increased where seedings failed due to low precipitation. Considerable soil erosion occurred in burned areas, as indicated by dust production, soil stability, and soil microrelief. Fire substantially increased dust flux rates due to decreased soil stability; however, neither drill affected these processes. Amounts of soil movement via dust flux rates and changes in soil microrelief varied throughout seasons but were not affected by drilling. While wildfire altered some soil micronutrients, drilling and seeding rates did not alter chemical responses to fire. Further work is needed to link plant and soil responses, which may help to explain plant establishment after fire and seeding treatments. Vegetation data from this research will be archived in the USGS Land Treatment Digital Library to inform future management and rehabilitation programs...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Integrated Pest Management is {{a system}} that {{combines}} cultural, biological and chemical technologies to reduce insect, fungal and weed populations to levels below those that result in economic damage.

Over the last three decades, improvements in chemical, cultural, and biological pest control practices have increased seed efficiency (defined as the number of plantable seedlings produced divided by the number of <b>pure</b> <b>live</b> seed sown) and reduced the percentage of production costs associated with pest control. As crop values increase, the economic thresholds for applying control measures decrease. However, since the statistical power of most trials in bareroot nurseries is low, the likelihood of experiments that detect ‘‘real’ ’ treatment dif-ference (e. g. those that consistently increase seed efficiency to the point where economic returns are affected) will be low.
