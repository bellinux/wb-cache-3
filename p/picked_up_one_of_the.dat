5|$|Following the Super Viernes on August 13, 2010, {{where he}} {{attacked}} La Máscara, Volador Jr. began being booked as rudo, although the on again, off again feud with Místico {{was put to}} the side in favor of Volador Jr. against La Sombra. The feud between the two led both wrestlers to be booked in the main event of the CMLL 77th Anniversary Show, a 14-man steel cage Lucha de Apuesta, mask vs. mask match. Volador Jr. was the 10th man to leave the steel cage, keeping his mask safe. The match came down to La Sombra pinning Olímpico to unmask him. On September 17, Volador Jr. <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> biggest wins in his CMLL career, defeating Místico in the finals of a tournament to win the Copa Bicentenario. On October 5, 2010, Volador Jr. lost the Mexican National Light Heavyweight Championship to La Máscara, ending his reign at 236 days. After losing the title, Volador Jr. spent several months not doing anything significant in CMLL until {{he took over the}} Los Invasores stable in July 2011, when its leader Héctor Garza turned tecnico. On September 18, Volador Jr. unsuccessfully challenged former partner La Sombra for the NWA World Historic Welterweight Championship, in a match that received rave reviews. Two days later, Volador Jr. led Olímpico and Psicosis II of Los Invasores to the Mexican National Trios Championship, when they defeated the trio of Ángel de Oro, Diamante and Rush. Volador Jr. continued his successful run on September 23 by defeating eleven other men in a torneo cibernetico to advance to the finals of the 2011 Leyenda de Plata. On October 7, Volador Jr. defeated Jushin Thunder Liger to win the tournament. Los Invasores lost the Mexican National Trios Championship to Atlantis, Delta and Guerrero Maya, Jr. on December 16, 2011. On February 14, 2012, Volador Jr. defeated La Máscara to win the NWA World Historic Middleweight Championship for the first time. On March 30, Volador Jr. lost the title to New Japan Pro Wrestling (NJPW) representative Prince Devitt.|$|E

60|$|As I {{pocketed}} {{his card}} I glanced at Madonna Serafina, wondering {{whether she had}} an eye for contrasts. She had <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> little couples and was tenderly dusting it with a feather broom.|$|E

60|$|The king hesitated, drawing back in disgust. Barney paused, half-way {{into the}} royal union suit, and leveled the {{revolver}} at Leopold. The king <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> garments gingerly between {{the tips of}} his thumb and finger.|$|E
60|$|An icy blast {{that set}} them {{shivering}} went roaring through the wood, {{but they were}} too intent to heed it, and Curtis <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> garments. He could see only {{that it was a}} jacket, for darkness was closing in suddenly.|$|E
60|$|As {{they crossed}} {{the spot where the}} recent fight with the Indians had taken place, Quashy <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> spears which lay on the ground, and Lawrence, to his great satisfaction, {{discovered}} his favourite cudgel lying where he had been knocked down.

60|$|I owe {{it all to}} {{the small}} priest Brown; he is an {{extraordinary}} man. The big librarian had left the table, perhaps ashamed of his long tongue, perhaps anxious about the storm in which his mysterious master had vanished: anyway, he betook himself heavily in the Duke's tracks through the trees. Father Brown had <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lemons and was eyeing it with an odd pleasure.|$|E
6000|$|... "'Bother my honor! I'm {{not going}} to do any harm,' muttered Mr. Bob-cat, and <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> eggs in his mouth.

60|$|Not {{a native}} was in sight. A terrific yell had broken from {{them at the}} explosion, which sounded to them {{like one of the}} cannons of their Spanish oppressors; and, smarting with the wounds {{simultaneously}} made by the hot brands, each, without a moment's thought, had taken to his heels.

The latter at once stooped and, with difficulty, <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> still blazing brands, and hurried towards the tree.|$|E
60|$|Cuthbert {{trusted to}} the stars as guides.

The sound jarred on Carroll's nerves, as the thud of the felled rampick had not done. Vane <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> chips.|$|E

6000|$|Obediently Paddy {{climbed out}} and {{returned}} to the fallen tree.

60|$|She had <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> roses from a vase {{close at}} hand, and was twirling it between her fingers. For some reason or other she seemed ill at ease.

She had {{received}} {{him in a}} very fascinating garment of blue silk, which was really only a dressing-gown. It seemed to {{him a long time}} since he had seen her in so intimate a fashion.|$|E
