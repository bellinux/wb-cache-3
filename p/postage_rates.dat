5|$|The great {{influx of}} bullion from the California Gold Rush and other finds caused {{the price of}} silver {{relative}} to gold to increase starting in 1848, and silver coins were hoarded or exported for melting. In 1851, a bill for a three-cent piece in 75% silver and 25% copper was introduced in Congress by New York Senator Daniel S. Dickinson, who wanted to lower <b>postage</b> <b>rates</b> from five to three cents. This percentage of silver was less than the normal 90% so that the coins would circulate {{at a time of}} hoarding. The copper large cent did not circulate in the Pacific Coast region or South due to prejudice against coins that did not contain precious metal, and some means of allowing the purchase of a postage stamp without the use of copper cents was necessary. Dickinson's bill passed on March 3, 1851, and in addition to authorizing the new three-cent silver, lowered rates for most domestic mails. By 1854, the imbalance had abated, and Congress increased the silver content of the three-cent piece to the standard 90% for silver coins, though its weight was reduced.|$|E

An {{important}} part of these reforms was {{the introduction of a}} uniform <b>postage</b> <b>rate</b> (i.e. 1d - which could be prepaid using the now famous [...] "Penny Black" [...] stamp), this concept was greatly influenced by the reduced <b>postage</b> <b>rate</b> concessions granted to the Army in 1795.|$|R

25|$|The MPS also {{supports}} mail delivery for U.S. diplomatic facilities overseas and to deployed personnel in combat zones worldwide. Most USPS extra services, such as Certified Mail, registered mail, delivery confirmation, insured mail, certificate of mailing, return receipt, restricted delivery and return receipt for merchandise {{are available to}} the MPS. Mail sent from one military post office (MPO) to another MPO can be sent for free as inner/intra-theater delivery service (IDS) {{as long as it}} does not transit the United States. Military <b>postage</b> <b>rates</b> are equivalent to U.S. domestic <b>postage</b> <b>rates</b> because the Services pay the second destination transportation (SDT) costs to, from, and between MPOs. The postage paid on mail to/from MPOs only covers the cost of transporting the mail within the U.S. All military mail between the U.S. and overseas locations is subject to customs inspection in the country of destination, and customs declarations must normally be attached to packages and larger mail pieces.|$|E

25|$|In December 1839 {{the first}} {{substantial}} reform started when <b>postage</b> <b>rates</b> were revised by the short-lived Uniform Fourpenny Post. Greater changes took place when the Uniform Penny Post was introduced on 10 January 1840 whereby a single rate for delivery anywhere in Great Britain and Ireland was pre-paid by the sender. A few months later, to certify that postage {{had been paid}} on a letter, the sender could affix the first adhesive postage stamp, the Penny Black that was available for use from 6 May the same year. Other innovations were the introduction of pre-paid William Mulready designed postal stationery letter sheets and envelopes.|$|E
25|$|The $1.30 Graf Zeppelin stamp {{was first}} issued in Washington DC on April 19, 1930. The stamp was printed in brown and depicts the Graf Zeppelin flying westward, {{superimposed}} over {{a map of}} the continents of Europe and South and North America with the names of various cities depicted in it. This issue paid the postcard and letter rates on the May 1930 Pan American flight that departed from Germany, flying to Brazil and then the United States. <b>Postage</b> <b>rates</b> depended on the distance between points along the route. The Scotts catalog number for this issue is C14. Out of 1,000,000 stamps printed, the total quantities sold for this issue were only 72,428.|$|E
25|$|The Cúcuta Chamber of Commerce {{was founded}} {{around the year}} 1890 as a {{non-profit}} entity {{of the government of}} Colombia, attached to the Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Tourism. The Chamber organized a mail service named Correo del Comercio (Business mail), a service which operated between 1890 and 1915. The mail service was intended to improve the communication between the Santander Provinces and Venezuela and to create faster access to the coast of Maracaibo. Mail was handled between Cúcuta and the golf of Maracaibo in Venezuela, which at the time had a permanent marine communication with Europe and North America. The chamber never issued stamps for this service, only a few registration labels. Stamps of the national postal system were used at the official <b>postage</b> <b>rates</b> cancelled by various types of ”CORREO DEL COMERCIO” handstamps.|$|E
5|$|During June–August 1906, the {{government}} proposed quadrupling the <b>postage</b> <b>rate</b> for second-class mail, which included newspapers, from one cent to four cents per pound. In response, Boyce proposed buying the Post Office Department for $300million (USD), {{claiming that he}} would reduce postal rates by half, eliminate chronic deficits by applying business methods to postal operations, establish a rural postal express, pay rent to the United States Department of the Treasury for postal buildings, and return profits over seven percent.

25|$|Direct {{flights from}} Malta became {{possible}} in 1931 {{which made the}} airmail service more popular. Zeppelin flights carried some mail from Malta from May 1933 to July 1935. In 1935, Malta issued the Silver Jubilee Crown Agents omnibus set, and {{this was followed by}} the 1937 Coronation omnibus set of 3. In 1938 a new set of pictorial definitives came out with a portrait of George VI inside a cartouche with local scenery around him. The farthing value was reissued like the 1901 version except with a modernised view of the harbour and the monogram GRI appearing on the stamp instead of a portrait. The set went up to 10/- and some of the top values reused scenes from the 1926 set, except larger and brighter. During World War II Malta was heavily bombed and the island was awarded the George Cross by the King, because it had resisted the Nazi and Italian bombardment. In 1942, Palazzo Parisio was hit by this aerial bombardment so the GPO moved to Ħamrun Primary School. In 1943 <b>postage</b> <b>rates</b> increased and 6 low values from the 1938 were reissued in new colours to show rate changes. Malta also took part in the 1946 omnibus issue commemorating the Allied victory in the war.|$|E
500|$|After {{a massive}} {{importation}} of gold bullion during the California Gold Rush, silver could be traded for {{increasing amounts of}} gold, so U.S. silver coins were exported and melted for their metal. This, and the reduction of <b>postage</b> <b>rates</b> to three cents, prompted Congress in 1851 to authorize a coin of that denomination made of [...]750 fine silver, rather than the conventional [...]900. The three-cent silver was the first American coin to contain metal valued significantly less than its face value, and the first silver coin not to be legal tender for an unlimited amount. The coin saw heavy use until Congress acted again in 1853, making other silver coins lighter, which kept them in circulation. [...] Congress also lightened the three-cent silver, and increased its fineness to 900 silver.|$|E
500|$|In the 1920s, {{the spread}} of the {{automobile}} and the improvement of roads in the United States made it easier for rural residents to do their shopping in larger towns farther from their homes. [...] This gave merchants an incentive to advertise in newspapers that reached such residents. [...] However, delivering the papers in a timely fashion became a problem for the publishers. [...] The U.S. Mail was expensive, since <b>postage</b> <b>rates</b> for newspapers had been raised drastically by the War Revenue Act of 1917; it also took several days for the papers to reach some customers. [...] In more developed parts of the country, publishers delivered papers by truck to local carriers in outlying towns. [...] However, the improvement of roads in the McCook area was slower than in more densely populated areas. [...] By 1929, U.S. Highway 38 (now U.S. Highway 6) had not yet been fully gravelled in southwestern Nebraska, and most roads off the main highways were impassable in bad weather.|$|E
50|$|The basic <b>postage</b> <b>rate</b> for a {{small letter}} has {{increased}} over the years due to inflation but influenced {{in recent years by}} a complex interplay between Australia Post's monopoly over small items, and need to provide service to all Australian addresses at the mandated basic rate.|$|R

500|$|Impetus for {{the passage}} of a three-cent coin came when Congress, in January 1851, {{considered}} reducing <b>postage</b> <b>rates</b> from five cents to three. [...] In 1849, House Committee on Ways and Means chairman, Samuel Vinton, had written to Mint director Robert M. Patterson that his committee was considering both reducing the postage rate and instituting a three-cent coin. [...] Although no legislative action was then taken, Patterson had the mint prepare experimental pattern coins. The House committee proposing the 1851 bill included Dickinson's three-cent piece, and provided that it be legal tender up to 30 cents. [...] When the bill was debated in the House on January 13, 1851, New York Congressman William Duer indicated that he felt both coin and stamp should be denominated at 2 cents, and his fellow New Yorker, Orsamus Matteson, offered an amendment to that effect. [...] The amendment failed, as did every other attempt to change the legislation, including Dickinson's plea, in the Senate, to restore the requirement that the new coin be used to retire some of the Spanish silver. [...] The bill passed both houses, and became the Act of March 3, 1851 when President Millard Fillmore signed it.|$|E

2500|$|The U.S. Parcel Post stamps of 191213 {{were the}} first such stamps issued by the U.S. Post Office Department and {{consisted}} of twelve denominations to pay the postage on parcels weighing 16 ounces and more, with each denomination printed in the same color of [...] "carmine-rose". Their border design was similar while each denomination of stamp bore its own distinctive image in the vignette. Unlike regular postage items, whose rates were determined by weight in ounces, Parcel Post rates were determined and measured by increments in pounds. The new stamps were soon widely used by industry, farmers and others who lived in rural areas.
