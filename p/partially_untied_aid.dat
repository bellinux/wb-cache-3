40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the impact of}} foreign aid on the growth and macroeconomic performance of a small recipient economy. Both tied and <b>untied</b> <b>aid</b> are considered, as well as permanent and temporary programs. The long-run impact of tied aid and its transitional dynamics depend crucially upon the elasticity of substitution in production, being more effective when this is low. Co-financing arrangements are also emphasized. This contrasts sharply {{with the effects of}} <b>untied</b> <b>aid</b> which, with fixed labor supply, has no growth or dynamic consequences but is always welfare improving. These differences also apply to temporary aid flows.

50|$|One of {{the main}} {{arguments}} in favour of <b>untied</b> <b>aid</b> is that tied aid can create important distortions in the market by {{limiting the number of}} countries where the recipient can make purchases. These limitations impede the recipient country’s ability to find the most cost-effective way to spend the aid they receive. It is estimated that goods and services purchased with tied aid cost 15-30% more than comparable goods and services acquired with <b>untied</b> <b>aid.</b> Furthermore, tied aid often favours capital-intensive goods and advising primarily in the donor country’s area of expertise. That may lead recipient countries to make purchases which are inappropriate for realising their development goals.|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} comprises two essays {{that attempt}} to determine, empirically, the fiscal response of governments’ to international assistance. The first essay examines whether an increasingly popular recommendation in international aid policy to switch from tied foreign assistance to untied foreign assistance affects investment in critical development expenditure sectors by developing countries. In the past, most international aid {{has been in the}} form of tied assistance as donors believed that tying aid will improve its effectiveness. It has been argued, that if tied aid is well designed and effectively managed then its overall effectiveness can be improved. On the contrary, it is also believed that tied aid acts as an impediment to donor cooperation and the building of partnership with developing countries. In addition, it is also argued that it removes the ‘feeling’ of ownership and responsibility of projects from partner countries in aid supported development. Two other more popular arguments used to challenge the effectiveness of foreign aid is that it is compromised when tied to the goods and services of the donor countries because almost 30 percent of its value is eliminated and also because it does not allow recipient countries to act on their priorities for public spending. These problems bring into question whether tied aid is truly {{the most effective way to}} help poor countries. A recommendation by the international community is that a switch to <b>untied</b> <b>aid</b> would be necessary. With <b>untied</b> <b>aid,</b> the recipient country is not obligated to buy the goods of the donor country neither is it compelled to pursue the public expenditure priorities of donors. Instead with <b>untied</b> <b>aid</b> they will have greater flexibility over spending decisions and can more easily pursue the priorities of their countries as they see fit. Hence, one could expect that a one dollar increase in <b>untied</b> <b>aid</b> will increase spending in the critical priority sectors by more than a one dollar increase in tied assistance. The question therefore is whether national domestic priorities coincide or not with what the international community has traditionally deemed should be priority. Empirically, we test this prediction using country-by-country data for 57 countries for the period 1973 to 2006. The results suggest that on average <b>untied</b> <b>aid</b> has a greater impact on pro-poor spending than do tied aid. In addition, the results also suggest that fungibility is still an issue even after accounting for the effects of <b>untied</b> <b>aid.</b> However, one could argue that fungibility may not be as bad as it appears since the switch to <b>untied</b> <b>aid</b> improves spending in the sectors that are essential for growth and development. The second essay explores the hypothesis that the expectations of debt forgiveness can discourage developing countries from attaining fiscal independence through an improvement of their tax effort. On the one hand, the international financial community typically advises poor countries to improve revenue mobilization but, on the other hand, the same international community routinely continues to bail-out poor countries that fail to meet their loan repayment obligations. The act of bailing-out these countries creates an expectation on the part of developing country governments that they will receive debt forgiveness time and again in the future. Therefore, the expectation of future bail outs creates a moral hazard that leads to endemic lower tax efforts. The key prediction of our simple theoretical model is that in the presence of debt forgiveness, tax ratios will decline and this decline will be stronger the higher the frequency and intensity of the bailouts. Empirically, we test this prediction using country-level data for 66 countries for the period 1989 to 2006. The results strongly suggest that debt forgiveness plays a significant role in the low tax effort observed in developing countries. Our empirical model allows for the endogeneity of tax effort and debt forgiveness. Interestingly we find that more debt forgiveness is actually provided to countries with lower tax effort. The results are robust to various specifications...|$|R

The focus is on the European Union (EU), which has been widely perceived as one of the most fervent supporters of promoting the <b>aid</b> <b>untying</b> agenda. In all these debates, the EU's leadership aspirations have remained largely unfulfilled. Thus, the EU has failed to adopt a EU-wide vision on aid untying; persuade non-EU donors to <b>untie</b> their <b>aid,</b> even when it has played the reciprocity card; and promote a pro-poor use of foreign aid, by supporting local ownership and facilitating greater access of developing country firms to aid contracts...|$|R

The results show that leftist governments increased the growth of bilateral grant aid, and more specifically grant aid to least developed and lower middle 8 ̆ 1]income countries.

While <b>untied</b> <b>aid</b> causes short-run real exchange appreciation, this response is very temporary and negligibly small. Tied aid, by influencing sectoral productivity, does generate permanent relative price effects.

40|$|This paper investigates {{by means}} of {{advanced}} panel data techniques whether bilateral aid {{has been successful in}} promoting bilateral exports to recipient countries during the period 1988 – 2007 and to what extent changes in aid policies have influenced this relationship. The main novelty of this research is the distinction between tied and <b>untied</b> <b>aid</b> in a multi-donor gravity model of trade and the comparison between trade and aid policies in this setting. We find an average positive effect of bilateral aid on exports, which varies over time and across donors and which appears to depend {{on the extent to which}} donors tied aid to exports. The effect does appear to have decreased substantially over the period studied and it is even not statistically significant in the 2000 s, which could suggest that the recommendations given by the OECD Development Assistance Committee (DAC) concerning the <b>untying</b> of <b>aid</b> and aid allocation have been followed by the donors and led to declining impacts on their exports. Interestingly, these decreasing aid-elasticities are accompanied by increasing coefficients of the regional trade agreement variable, which is positive and statistically significant after 1994. Finally, we find that the strength of the relationship between exports and bilateral aid is correlated with the extent to which aid is tied and partially related to the sectoral allocation of aid...|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} foreign aid on the welfare levels of both the {{recipient}} and the donor country has been a much analysed topic for research in both the theory {{of international trade and}} development economics. In the development economics literature, concerns have been raised since the 1960 s on the possible adverse effect {{of foreign aid}} on domestic savings and growth. 1 The trade theory literature in this respect is much older and dates back to the 1920 s when Professors Keynes and Ohlin debated on the effect of foreign aid on international terms of trade. 2 Ever since, the terms of trade effect has been the cornerstone in the analysis of the welfare effect of foreign aid in the trade theory literature. 3 After some early confusion, it is now well established that in a Walrasian stable world economy with two countries, a necessary condition for foreign aid to have perverse effects is that there is some distortion in either of the two countries. 4 It is also known that, under normality and substitutability of goods, <b>untied</b> <b>aid</b> cannot be strictly Pareto-improving in a tariff distorted world. ...|$|R

This article argues, however, that European Union budget support is still very much tied to premature trade opening and economic liberalisation in Africa. Examining the cases of Tunisia, Ghana and Uganda, it points to the strategic utilisation of budget aid as a means of donor leverage for free market reform detrimental to the needs of poorer citizens.
