40|$|Abstract: The new date {{provided}} by Bennett and Fuller (2002) for the mid-Holocene hemlock (Tsuga canadensis) decline in eastern North America is questioned {{in the light}} of recent advances in the <b>palaeo-ecology</b> of the decline. It is concluded that the 'new ' date gives a false impression of the dating accuracy of a complex ecological event of relatively long duration...|$|E
40|$|A {{large amount}} of micropalaeontological and sedimentological {{research}} has been accomplished over die past two decades {{in an attempt to}} re-construct the <b>palaeo-ecologies</b> represented by the Palaeogene deposits of the Hampshire Basin. Despite this, there has never been any overall synthesis of environments represented by these sediments integrating both fields of research. Two areas of research are pursued in this study. The first utilizes graphic analysis techniques to derive a tentative micro-biostratigraphy for the Early Eocene sediments of the southern Hampshire Basin. The second area of research attempts the reconstruction of the <b>palaeo-ecologies</b> represented by these sediments through the integration of both micropalaeontological and sedimentological data gained from the first area of research. Finally, using previously published magnetostratigraphic data, both the tentative micro-biostratigraphy and the palaeo-ecological sequence recorded from this research are chronologically defined in terms of absolute age and duration...|$|R
40|$|Holocene {{relative}} sea-level reconstructions {{provide information}} on differential land movements, palaeo-landscapes, occupational history, <b>palaeo-ecology</b> of coastal areas and are important for climate change studies. For The Netherlands most coastal regions have a well-established sea level curve. However, {{this is not the}} case for the Wadden area. Up until recently, there were not enough reliable index points to establish a separate curve for the Northern Netherlands. Van de Plassche (1982) assumed on the basis of the little basal peat data available (two index points) that the curve for the Western Netherlands was also applicable to the North of the country. Using a modelling approach, Kiden (2002) suggested a lower curve based on postglacial isostatic subsidence. The data to support such hypothesis was expanded recently to 15 index points as presented by Kiden & Vos (in prep). We now present data on a sea level curve valid for the Dutch Wadden area, based on published and previously unpublished data to a dataset of 49 basal peat 14 C samples. First results suggest that in the early Holocene, the relative sea level curve is below the curve for the Western Netherland, but after around 7000 cal BP, the sea level rises comparably with the Western Netherlands curve...|$|E
40|$|A recent {{switch in}} the study of the {{beginning}} of agriculture is to demonstrate the increasingly closer interaction between people and the landscape and how this would have played a crucial role in the transition to agriculture. Understanding the <b>palaeo-ecology</b> of the local environments at key sites and its relationship with subsistence strategies is critical to an improved appreciation of such interactions. This article examines macro- and micro-plant remains discovered at two important sites in North China, both dated to around 10, 000 cal. yr BP. These two sites, Zhuannian and Nanzhuangtou, are located on the terrace of the Bai River in the Yan Mountains and next to Baiyangdian Lake on the piedmont of the Taihang Mountains, respectively. The floral remains at these two sites provide a great opportunity to examine (1) post-Pleistocene subsistence strategies, (2) the increasing consumption of millets and grassy plants and its significance and (3) the intra-regional diversity in food exploitation and its relationships with local environments. While the macro-plant remains at Nanzhuangtou indicate the importance of aquatic plants in the palaeo-diet, those at Zhuannian suggest a tendency of exploiting tree plants. This significance of these diversified plant food exploitation strategies by the last hunter-gatherers should be paid more attention in future research. Our data also once again confirm the importance of millet consumption to these hunter-gatherers on the eve of millet domestication...|$|E
40|$|The current natural {{distribution}} of Taxus baccata L. in Belgium {{is limited to}} a few localities {{in the southern part of}} the country. In these localities, Taxus is predominantly growing on steep, calcareous slopes, which is believed to be its natural habitat in this part of the world. In Flanders, the northern part of Belgium, Taxus is considered not to be native and Taxus stands are interpreted there as being planted by humans or as garden escapes. The Holocene pollen and macrofossil data for Taxus, however, show a very different picture regarding abundance and geographical distribution, as well as habitat. It appears that during the Sub-boreal, Taxus grew in the coastal plain and the lower Scheldt valley, where it was part of the carr vegetation on peat. Before the end of the Sub-boreal, Taxus seems to have disappeared from this region, most probably because of the transition from the carr vegetation to (raised) bogs. Belgium is not the only case where such observations have been made. In other areas of northwestern Europe, Taxus also seems to have had a completely different distribution and ecology in the past, especially during the Sub-boreal. An overview of the palaeobotanical finds of Taxus baccata from Belgium is here given, supplemented with finds from neighbouring regions. The Holocene distribution and <b>palaeo-ecology</b> of Taxus baccata are discussed in a broader northwest European context...|$|E
40|$|This paper reveals methodologies for the {{dissemination}} of new knowledge specific to the scientific discourse of <b>palaeo-ecology</b> {{and the evolution of}} early life. Through the research, faunae previously unknown and undiscovered are given visual identities and shown for the first time. I collaborated with the palaeology team from Leicester University to document Keubosia susanae discovered in the the Ordovician Soom Shale, South Africa and Stendodyctia, an early flying insect from the Carboniferous Period., The two case studies are disparate in context and use; one is produced by primary scientific research for original and advanced debate and it can be considered generically ‘didactic. ’ The focus of this study is efficient knowledge transfer regarding newly-discovered ‘raw’ facts. The second study is for children’s educational and diversionary interest purposes. This study works to captivate and engage with an emphasis on ‘seduction’ and ‘charm’: both studies adhere to the prescribed criteria for quality, the academic value accorded {{the dissemination}} of scientific information., The publication interrogates major modern determinants of {{the dissemination of}} scientific information, the cultural dictate related to evolutionary science & education and, subsequently, the role of religious beliefs in the rejection of much proven scientific fact or theory. This paper proceeds from a position aware that contemporary illustrators will have to be increasingly mindful of global ethical concerns. This paper examines a ‘third way’ for the presentation of prehistoric natural science themes: to be visually ‘romantic’ & deliberately convey falsehoods and distortions of the truth; it is the ‘dilemma of fact or fantasy. ’ This publication weighs the potential for work of academic value to be produced through the mediation of these cultural poles...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} detects changes in dinosaur assemblages from the Upper Creataceous of South Alberta, Canada, by {{analyzing}} isolated dinosaur teeth from vertebrate microfossil sites. The studied formations, namely the coastal Milk River, Oldman, Dinosaur Park, Horseshoe Canyon and the inland Scollard Formations represent a time span of approximately twenty million years. In the Latest Maastrichtian, the inland Scollard Formation and the coastal Lance and Frenchman Formations are examined {{in order to}} obtain a certain geographical range and a comparison of inland versus coastal environments. Two distinct assemblages, which differ in the relative abundance of taxa, are present during the time span of this study: assemblage A is present in the Early Campanian Milk River Formation, assemblage B takes over in the Campanian Oldman, Dinosaur Park and Horseshoe Canyon Formations and is replaced by assemblage A again in the Latest Maastrichtian Scollard, Lance and Frenchman Formations. Thus, assemblage A might have migrated to areas with more appropriate ecological conditions during the Campanian. The time for which assemblage A persisted is therefore estimated to about twenty (or more) million years. The relative dating of biostratigraphic zones is put into question by these results, since palaeo-assemblages persist for very long time spans and rather hint to environmental controls than to the time in which they lived. The diversity of dinosaur taxa does not decline in the stratigraphically uppermost locality which is situated 13 m below the K/T-boundary. This hints towards stability of the ecosystem up to this time. By putting together taxa to ecological guilds, it is attempted to identify ecological controls that are responsible for the observed change of assemblages. As a result, neither 'proximity to coast' nor 'humidity' are primary factors for this change. Although more studies of this kind would be necessary on larger geographical and stratigraphical ranges, data of this study hint to the following vegetational structure of the palaeo-environment: the Milk River Formation was covered with dense vegetation and the Oldman Formation was relatively open in vegetational structure and these conditions persisted during the following Dinosaur Park Group. The Horseshoe Canyon Formation seems to be covered with dense vegetation again and the environment opens in the inland Scollard Formation. A rough investigation of the carnivore/herbivore ratio within the Dinosauria shows that the predators from the Latest Maastrichtian fed on relatively more non-dinosaurs than in earlier times. Finally, the use of neo-ecological concepts in <b>palaeo-ecology</b> is discussed. (orig.)
