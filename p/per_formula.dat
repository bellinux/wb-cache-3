25|$|Although YBa2Cu3O7 is a {{well-defined}} chemical compound {{with a specific}} structure and stoichiometry, materials with fewer than seven oxygen atoms <b>per</b> <b>formula</b> unit are non-stoichiometric compounds. The structure of these materials depends on the oxygen content. This non-stoichiometry is denoted by the x in the chemical formula YBa2Cu3O7−x. When x = 1, the O(1) sites in the Cu(1) layer are vacant and the structure is tetragonal. The tetragonal form of YBCO is insulating and does not superconduct. Increasing the oxygen content slightly causes more of the O(1) sites to become occupied. For x < 0.65, Cu-O chains along the b axis of the crystal are formed. Elongation of the b axis changes the structure to orthorhombic, with lattice parameters of a = 3.82, b = 3.89, and c = 11.68 Å. Optimum superconducting properties occur when x ~ 0.07, i.e., {{almost all of the}} O(1) sites are occupied, with few vacancies.|$|E

40|$|The adiudicatio of the communi dividundo iudicium and {{the holders}} of limited real rights - Abstract The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to strengthen the study of the adiudicatio of the communi dividundo iudicium from a particular perspective, that of the holders of limited real rights. The starting point is the analysis of the adiudicatio function in the trial <b>per</b> <b>formulas</b> and particularly in the communi dividundo iudicium. We then proceed identifying the subjects legitimated to exercise the actio communi dividundo, attempting to reconstruct the classes of people which was first granted the right to exercise the actio in the classical Roman age, distinguishing them from those who could use it utiliter. Once identified the guiding principle that was the basis of the original legitimation and subsequent expansion, we highlight the limits of this expansion, pointing out the texts supposed to be corrupted by the hand of Justinian compilers. We then further change the observation point and consider the holders of limited real rights not as potential parts of a communi dividundo iudicium, but as subjects {{of the effects of the}} adiudicatio of the communi dividundo iudicium held between co-owners of the res communis on which such holders exercised their rights. It turns out that the adiudicatio of the trial <b>per</b> <b>formulas</b> did not affect the limited real rights of those who were unrelated to the trial, keeping these rights to weigh on a pro indiviso quota also after the division of the res communis, and concluding that for the whole classical age the prudentes granted them maximum protection, preserving their interests although the constitutive effects of the communi dividundo iudicium judgment. ...|$|R
40|$|Layered double {{hydroxides}} {{with a high}} layer charge (+ 0. 33 <b>per</b> empirical <b>formula</b> unit) intercalate nitrate ions {{with the}} molecular plane of the NO 3 - ion inclined at ca. 70 Â° to the metal hydroxide layer, which results in a basal spacing of 8. 8 Ã. Three different N-O bond lengths are observed and yield Cs coordination symmetry. At lower charge (0. 165 â¤ x â¤ 0. 2), a basal spacing of 8. 0 Ã is observed, which indicates that the nitrate ion is intercalated with its molecular plane parallel to the metal hydroxide layer (coordination symmetry D 3 h) in a manner isostructural with carbonate-intercalated layered double hydroxides. Consequently, crystal chemical considerations predict the layer charge corresponding to the idealized composition of the nitrate-intercalated phase to be + 0. 165 <b>per</b> empirical <b>formula</b> unit. The Mg-Al-NO 30. 165 phase is highly ordered with robust crystal growth along 001 and is stable to hydrothermal treatment, {{in contrast to the}} carbonate analogue of the same layer charge.
