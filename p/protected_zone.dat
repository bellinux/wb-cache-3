5|$|Erosion-resistant basalt {{underlies}} much of the watershed, {{and streams}} passing over it are relatively free of sediments. However, turbidity increases when unstable soils sandwiched between layers of basalt and other volcanic rocks are disturbed and wash into the river during rainstorms. Despite legal protections, about 22percent of the <b>protected</b> <b>zone</b> was logged {{during the second half}} of the 20thcentury, and erosion increased. For a time in 1996, Portland had to shut down the Bull Run supply because of turbidity and switch to water from wells. A law passed later that year prohibited most logging in or near the watershed, and since then the Portland Water Bureau and the United States Forest Service have closed many of the logging roads and removed culverts and other infrastructure contributing to erosion.|$|E

40|$|Leukocytes form {{zones of}} close {{apposition}} when they adhere to ligand- coated surfaces. Because plasma proteins {{are excluded from}} these contact zones, we have termed them <b>protected</b> <b>zones</b> of adhesion. To determine whether platelets form similar <b>protected</b> <b>zones</b> of adhesion, gel-filtered platelets stimulated with thrombin or ADP were allowed to adhere to fibrinogen- or fibronectin-coated surfaces. The protein- coated surfaces with platelets attached were stained with either fluorochrome-conjugated goat anti-human fibrinogen or anti-human fibronectin antibodies, or with rhodamine-conjugated polyethylene glycol polymers. Fluorescence microscopy revealed that F(ab') 2 anti- fibrinogen (100 kD) did not penetrate into the contact zones between stimulated platelets and the underlying fibrinogen-coated surface, while Fab antifibrinogen (50 kD) and 10 kD polyethylene glycol readily penetrated and stained the substrate beneath the platelets. Thrombin- or ADP-stimulated platelets also formed <b>protected</b> <b>zones</b> of adhesion on fibronectin-coated surfaces. F(ab') 2 anti-fibronectin and 10 kD polyethylene glycol were excluded from these adhesion zones, indicating that they are much less permeable than those formed by platelets on fibrinogen-coated surfaces. The permeability properties of <b>protected</b> <b>zones</b> of adhesion formed by stimulated platelets on surfaces coated with both fibrinogen and fibronectin were similar to the zones of adhesion formed on fibronectin alone. mAb 7 E 3, directed against the alpha IIb beta 3 integrin blocked the formation of <b>protected</b> adhesion <b>zones</b> between thrombin-stimulated platelets and fibrinogen or fibronectin coated surfaces. mAb C 13 is directed against the alpha 5 beta 1 integrin on platelets. Stimulated platelets treated with this mAb formed <b>protected</b> <b>zones</b> of adhesion on surfaces coated with fibronectin. These <b>protected</b> <b>zones</b> were impermeable to F(ab') 2 antifibronectin but were permeable to 10 kD polyethylene glycol. These results show that activated platelets form <b>protected</b> <b>zones</b> of adhesion and {{that the size of}} molecules excluded from these zones depends upon the composition of the matrix proteins to which the platelets adhere. They also show that formation of <b>protected</b> <b>zones</b> of adhesion by platelets requires alpha IIb beta 3 integrins while the permeability properties of these zones of adhesion are regulated by both alpha IIb beta 3 and alpha 5 beta 1 integrins...|$|R

2500|$|The {{destruction}} {{of the last of}} these canals began in the 1950s. At that time, groundwater pumping under the city center was causing severe subsidence. These wells were closed and new ones dug in Xochimilco and other southern boroughs. High rates of extraction have had the same effect on water tables and canals began to dry. [...] Since then reclaimed wastewater has been recycled to flow into the Xochimilco canals to supplement water from natural sources. However, this water is not potable, containing bacteria and heavy metals and the canals still receive untreated wastewater and other pollution [...] Another major problem, especially {{in the past two decades}} has been the population explosion of Mexico City, pushing urban sprawl further south into formerly rural areas of the Federal District. This prompted authorities to seek World Heritage Site status for the canals and the pre-Hispanic chinampa fields to provide them more environmental protection. This was granted in 1987, but these same major environmental problems still exist. A 2006 study by UNESCO and Universidad Autónoma Metropolitana has shown that there are still very high levels of pollution (both garbage and fecal matter) in the canals and there still a rapid rate of deterioration 2,000 hectares of protected area. UNESCO has placed the most blame for the problems on the proliferation of illegal human settlements in the <b>protected</b> <b>zone.</b> Each year the borough loses six hectares of former lakebed to illegal settlements. According to the borough, about 90,000 people in Xochimilco live in illegal settlements, such as those in ecological zones and 33,804 families live illegally on the chinampas. The most problematic are those closest to the canals, which cause the most pollution. The area is also sinking [...] per year due to over pumping of groundwater, and canals are being filled in illegally. The deterioration is happening so fast, that UNESCO has threatened to pull Xochimilco World Heritage Site status.|$|E
2500|$|The {{second case}} {{concerns}} a former UN interpreter, Hasan Nuhanović, {{and the family}} of Rizo Mustafić, an electrician {{who worked for the}} UN Battalion at Srebrenica. Nuhanović filed a suit against the State of the Netherlands in front of the District Court in The Hague claiming that Dutch troops within the UN peacekeeping contingent that were responsible for security in the then Srebrenica <b>protected</b> <b>zone,</b> allowed VRS troops to kill his family (brother, father and mother), while the family of Mustafić filed the suite because he was killed in similar circumstances. The liability {{of the state of the}} Netherlands was based on the opinion that the Dutch Government (Minister of Defense) had the de facto operational command of the battalion, as established by the Dutch Constitution (Article 97(2)), which grants the government superior command ("oppergezag") over Dutch military forces. On 10 September 2008, the Hague District Court ruled against the plaintiffs, noting that the state of the Netherlands cannot be held responsible for the acts or omissions of Dutchbat, since that contingent of troops was made available to the UN and, as a matter or principle, any of its acts are to be attributed strictly to the UN. At the same time it found that the acts of Dutchbat cannot be concurrently attributed to the Netherlands since, in the view of the Court, no evidence was presented that the Dutch government [...] "cut across the United Nations command structure" [...] by ordering the contingent to ignore or disobey UNPROFOR orders. On 5 July 2011, upon the appeal of the plaintiffs, the Dutch Appellate court held that the Netherlands was responsible for the three deaths indicated in the claim, and that it owns damages to the plaintiffs. On 3 May 2013, the Procurator General of the Supreme Court of the Netherlands concluded in his so-called [...] "advisory opinion" [...] that the appeal against the Judgment of the Court of Appeal of the Hague should be rejected. On 6 September 2009 the Supreme Court of the Netherlands upheld the Appeals Court decision holding the Netherlands liable for the three deaths in this case. The Netherlands decided to award the families of the victims with 20.000 EUR each of non-material damages, while the material damages will be determined at a later date.|$|E
