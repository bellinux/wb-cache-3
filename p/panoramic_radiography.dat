40|$|Introduction: X-rays are potent {{mutagenic}} agents {{capable of}} inducing both gene mutations and chromosomal aberrations. They act {{directly on the}} DNA molecule or indirectly through the formation of reactive compounds that interact with this molecule. In spite of their mutagenic potential, this kind of radiation is an important tool for diagnosis. Aim: The {{aim of this study}} is to analyze the genotoxic effects on oral mucosa during conventional and digital <b>panoramic</b> <b>radiography.</b> Objectives: 1. To assess the nuclear abnormalities, mainly micronuclei in exfoliated buccal mucosal cells, before X-ray exposure and 10 days after exposure using conventional and digital <b>panoramic</b> <b>radiography.</b> 2. Comparison of micronuclei count obtained during conventional and digital <b>panoramic</b> <b>radiography.</b> Materials and Methods: One hundred healthy individuals were chosen who were free of all deleterious habits. Epithelial buccal cells were obtained with an exfoliative cytobrush immediately before exposure and 10 days after exposure. The smears were stained using Giemsa stain and analyzed under low-power and high-power microscope. Results: There was a significant difference in the mean values obtained pre- and post-exposure to conventional <b>panoramic</b> <b>radiography,</b> as the mean value of micronuclei before exposure was 0. 025 ± 0. 01 which increased to 0. 064 ± 0. 02 post-exposure. Similarly, there was a significant difference in the mean values obtained pre- and post-exposure to digital <b>panoramic</b> <b>radiography,</b> as the mean value of micronuclei before exposure was 0. 022 ± 0. 01 which increased to 0. 041 ± 0. 01 post-exposure. In the present study, there was a highly significant increase in the number of micronuclei post-exposure in conventional <b>panoramic</b> <b>radiography</b> when compared to digital <b>panoramic</b> <b>radiography.</b> Conclusion: This results show that <b>panoramic</b> <b>radiography</b> does induce genotoxic effects in buccal epithelial cells and should be used only when indicated, and that digital <b>panoramic</b> <b>radiography</b> is safer as compared to conventional radiography...|$|E

Methods: 40 healthy individuals who underwent this procedure for diagnostic purposes on request from their dentists agreed to participate in this study. All of them answered a questionnaire before the examination. Epithelial gingival cells were obtained from the keratinized mucosa of the upper dental arcade by gentle scraping with a cervical brush immediately before exposure and 10 days later. Cytological preparations were stained according to the Feulgen-Rossenbeck reaction, counterstained with fast green 1 % for 1 min and analysed under a light microscope. Micronuclei, nuclear projections (broken eggs) and degenerative nuclear alterations (pyknosis, karyolysis, karyorrhexis and condensed chromatin) were scored.

40|$|AbstractObjectivesThe {{aim of this}} {{cross-sectional}} {{study was to investigate}} an association between the prevalence of root-filled teeth (RFT) or apical periodontitis (AP) and some systemic conditions or smoking habits in an adult Portuguese population. MethodsMedical histories, including age, gender, presence of cardiovascular disease (CVD), diabetes mellitus (DM), allergies, smoking status, and endodontic treatment data of 421 patients (10, 540 teeth) were recorded. The prevalence of root filled teeth and the periapical status were assessed through <b>panoramic</b> <b>radiographies.</b> Periapical status was classified according to the Periapical index and AP was defined as PAI-score ≥ 3. Statistic analysis was performed with PASW Statistics 20. 0 using qui-square tests, odds-ratio and confidence intervals (95 %). ResultsThe overall prevalence of AP and RFT was 2. 2 % and 4. 2 %, respectively. RFT increased the possibility of having AP (p< 0. 0001). Men's group showed a higher percentage of teeth with AP (p< 0. 0001), less RFT (p= 0. 05) and more residual roots (2. 3 %). Smoking increased the probability of having AP (p= 0. 002) and RFT (p= 0. 045). A positive correlation was observed between RFT and DM (p= 0. 040). No statistically significant difference was found between AP and CVD, DM or allergies neither between RTF and CVD or allergies. ConclusionsThe higher prevalence of AP and/or RFT in smoker subjects and in diabetic patients can suggest a relationship between oral and systemic health. More epidemiological studies are required before definitive conclusions can be made...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Tooth {{impaction}} is {{a common}} anomaly. Several local and systemic factors may result in tooth impaction. Among the permanent dentition third molar, maxillary canine, maxillary and mandibular premolar and maxillary central incisors have the most probability of impaction. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the prevalence of impacted teeth in the patients referred to Yazd Dental School in 1392 to 1394. Methods: In this retrospective study, 600 digital <b>panoramic</b> <b>radiographies</b> of the patients over 15 years old were examined. The patients with dent of axial abnormalities, other syndromes or particular pathology, edentulous and traumatized patients were extracted from the study. Data were statistically analyzed using SPSS software (version 22. 0 for Windows, Chicago, IL, USA), Chi-square and Fisher's exact tests. Results: Out of total 600 patients were examined, 99 patients (16. 5 %) presented with at least one impacted tooth. Mandibular third molars were the most prevalent (52. 26 %) impacted teeth, followed by impacted maxillary third molar (27. 7 %), maxillary canine (13. 8 %) and mandibular canine (4. 86 %). The highest prevalence of tooth impaction was seen in 22 - 30 years age group. There was no statistically significant difference between tooth impaction and gender (p-value= 0. 91). Conclusion: Tooth impaction has a relatively high prevalence in Yazd  (16. 5 %). The highest prevalence of tooth impaction is seen in third molars followed by canine teeth of both jaws. So, in case of delayed eruption of canine teeth, radiographic examination is suggested to evaluation their impaction and applying proper managements...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the association between the presence of mandibular third molars and the occurrence of carious lesions in the distal aspect of the mandibular second molar. Material and Methods: A retrospective cohort study comprising 327 lower third molars extracted in the Oral Surgery and Implantology Master's Degree program of the School of Dentistry of the University of Barcelona (Barcelona, Spain) was carried out. A descriptive and bivariate analysis was made. The diagnosis of caries in the second molar and the position of the mandibular third molar were evaluated through <b>panoramic</b> <b>radiographies.</b> Results: The sample included 203 patients, 94 males (46. 3 %) and 109 females (53. 7 %), with a mean age of 26, 8 years and 327 lower third molars. The prevalence of second molar distal caries was 25. 4 % (95 % CI= 20. 6 % to 30. 2 %). This pathology was significantly more frequent when the third molar was in a horizontal position (27. 7 %), when the contact point was at (45, 8 %) or below (47. 0 %) the cementoenamel junction (CEJ), and when the distal CEJ of the mandibular second molar and the mesial CEJ of the third molar was 7 to 12 mm apart. Conclusions: Horizontal lower third molars with contact points at or below the CEJ are more likely to produce distal caries in the mandibular second molars. Due to the high prevalence of this pathology (20. 6 % to 30. 2 %), a prophylactic removal of lower third molars with the above-mentioned features might be advisable...|$|R
