50|$|The Pre-K/Kindergarten group {{starts with}} ages 2.5 to 6 years old. Nature has an {{important}} role in the day-to-day activities - e.g. during walks or while working in the garden. Outdoor play in rope swings, see-saw or hammocks, baking, puppetry, story-telling, finger knitting, sewing, watercolor <b>painting,</b> <b>wool</b> felting, songs and poems are part of the daily curriculum. Students assist with all tasks at school, developing self-confidence, a sense of responsibility and teamwork.|$|R
50|$|In 1999, Ploeg's {{painting}} of actress Deborah Mailman <b>painted</b> on <b>wool</b> bales was {{hung in the}} Archibald Prize, and won the People's Choice Award. In 2000, his {{painting of}} athlete Louise Sauvage was hung in the Archibald Prize.|$|R

5000|$|In 1999, Bryant {{purchased}} Christopher <b>Wool's</b> <b>painting</b> Apocalypse Now, but sold it {{two years}} later to Christie's chairman François Pinault, allegedly because his wife could not live with a work that said [...] "SELL THE HOUSE SELL THE CAR SELL THE KIDS".|$|R
50|$|Cloudbase was {{realised}} as a scale filming model over 6 ft in length, {{designed by}} special effects director Derek Meddings. It was the simplest Captain Scarlet vehicle to design, and typically {{appeared in a}} stock long shot filmed against a sky backdrop (comprising a background <b>painting,</b> cotton <b>wool</b> clouds in the foreground, and dry ice). Too heavy to be supported by thin wires, the model was sometimes fixed to a metal pole, which was concealed from the camera's view by the filming angle. Larger sections of the flight deck were built for scenes showing aircraft taking off and landing.|$|R
25|$|The {{machinery}} differs if the windmill is {{used for}} other applications than milling grain. A drainage mill uses another set of gear wheels on the bottom end of the upright shaft to drive a scoop wheel or Archimedes' screw. Sawmills use a crankshaft to provide a reciprocating motion to the saws. Windmills {{have been used to}} power many other industrial processes, including papermills, threshing mills, and to process oil seeds, <b>wool,</b> <b>paints</b> and stone products.|$|R
50|$|Baker uses {{a variety}} of textures in her works. “When I can, I like to use textures from the actual {{materials}} portrayed, such as bark, feathers, cracked <b>paint,</b> earth, knitted <b>wool</b> and rusty tin… so that their natural textures {{become an integral part}} of the work.” Baker’s collages illustrate her picture books, but also stand individually as works of art. They are part of many public art collections and have been exhibited in galleries in London, New York and throughout Australia.|$|R
5000|$|The sale of Apocalypse Now {{broke the}} {{previous}} Christopher Wool auction record of £4,913,250 ($7,758,022) set in February 2012 by Untitled ('Fool'). The record was in turn eclipsed in May 2015 when Untitled ('Riot'), a work <b>Wool</b> <b>painted</b> in 1990, sold for $29,930,000 at Sotheby's. An unnamed European curator told The Art Newspaper that Wool's {{reputation as a}} blue-chip [...] "must-have artist" [...] was established by a 2008 limited edition monograph issued by Taschen, but that his market inventory, in relatively short supply, was {{at risk of being}} controlled (like that of Jean-Michel Basquiat) by a small, powerful clique of collectors.|$|R
40|$|Two {{methods of}} skin {{autograft}} donor site management were evaluated in 40 {{patients in a}} prospective randomised double-blind clinical trial. Donor sites were dressed using either a standard dressing of Jelonet, gauze, wool and a crêpe bandage or Jelonet, Whitehead's varnish (compound iodoform <b>paint</b> BPC), gauze, <b>wool</b> and a crêpe bandage. Donor site pain was assessed daily using a linear analogue scale, and the healing time of the donor area was recorded. Whitehead's varnish significantly reduced donor site pain compared to the standard dressing (P = 0. 0006). Although overall healing time was not statistically different in the two groups, larger donor sites treated with Jelonet and Whitehead's varnish healed more quickly than those treated with the standard dressing alone...|$|R
40|$|The fellmongery process {{involves}} {{the removal of}} wool from sheep and lamb skins prior to tanning. The pelts also must be free from epidermic, sweat and fat glands, muscle tissue, blood vessels, fat cells and collagen fibrous tissue. The process consists of the following operations:- (1) Washing of pelts. (2) Lime/Na 2 S <b>paint</b> application. (3) <b>Wool</b> removal; manual pulling. (4) Lining; removal of residual wool, pelt conditioning, carried out in a "dolly" or drum. (5) Deliming and bating; removal of lime liquor and extraneous pelt matter, "dolly" or drum processing. (6) Pickling; preservation; "dolly" or drum processing. Thirty-nine fellmongeries, which were operating in New Zealand {{at the end of}} 1972 (42), were all departments of meat processing works.

25|$|The hull {{had been}} {{sheathed}} in three layers of lead sheeting {{to protect the}} timbers from shipworms; as there are none in fresh water lakes, this design feature was not only costly but useless. It {{is evidence that the}} ships hulls were constructed following standardized Roman shipbuilding techniques rather than being purpose-built. The topside timbers were protected by <b>paint</b> and tarred <b>wool</b> with many surfaces decorated with marble, mosaics and gilded copper roof tiles. There was a lack of coordination between the structure of the hull and that of the superstructures, which suggests that naval architects designed the hulls, while civil architects then designed the superstructure to use the space available after the hulls were completed. After their recovery, the ships hulls were found to be completely empty and unadorned.|$|R
5000|$|Wool {{has been}} {{considered}} one of Trockel’s signature materials since she first utilized the medium to create a series of machine-knit wool works in the 1980s. Trockel's [...] "knitting pictures", produced in 1985, consist of lengths of machine-knitted, woolen material stretched onto frames. The material is patterned with computer-generated geometrical motifs, or with recognizable logos, such as the hammer and sickle motif of the Soviet Union superimposed on a background of red and white stripes reminiscent of the US flag. I See Darkness (2011) {{is one of the}} wool series for which Trockel is best known. Black yarn is stretched across a square of white perspex in vertical lines which, from far away, create the illusion of a monochrome <b>painting.</b> More recent <b>wool</b> paintings feature bold horizontal and vertical stripes of color as well as monochromatic compositions, with clear references to the formal compositions of twentieth century abstract painting.|$|R
40|$|Aim: The {{aim of this}} {{workshop}} is {{to introduce}} and explore the occupation of mixed media art both {{as a means to}} experience creativity and as a way to reflect on occupational therapy research, education and practice. Background: Dickie (2004) asks how occupational scientists and therapists can support others’ efforts to be creative if we don’t have personal experience of what this means. Trying new media, such as mixed media artwork, can give rise to creativity and new insights (Myers 1999). During my doctoral research, I developed the skills of mixed media art to reflect on my development as a researcher. Reflection is a part of continuing professional development (COT 2015) and the workshop will enable participants to explore creativity and reflection on all aspects of practice. Session plan: Participants will be introduced to a number of techniques such as collage, stencilling and embossing, using a variety of materials including <b>paints,</b> pastels, <b>wool,</b> fabric, paper and found objects. Examples and instructions will be available. Participants will be asked to think about an aspect of practice, education or research on which they would like to reflect. They will be asked to consider this first as a metaphor and then to create an artwork based on this metaphor. Finally participants will be invited to reflect on and share their art and experience of creativity. No previous art experience is required. Resources: A large room with tables and a sink.

After their recovery, the ships hulls were found to be completely empty and unadorned. They were steered using 11.3 m long quarter oars, with the seconda nave equipped with four, two off each quarter and two from the shoulders while the prima nave was equipped with two. Similar pairs of steering leeboards appear frequently in early 2nd century depictions of ships.|$|R
50|$|Gears {{inside a}} {{windmill}} convey {{power from the}} rotary motion of the sails to a mechanical device. The sails are carried on the horizontal windshaft. Windshafts can be wholly made of wood, or wood with a cast iron poll end (where the sails are mounted) or entirely of cast iron. The brake wheel is fitted onto the windshaft between {{the front and rear}} bearing. It has the brake around the outside of the rim and teeth {{in the side of the}} rim which drive the horizontal gearwheel called wallower on the top end of the vertical upright shaft. In grist mills, the great spur wheel, lower down the upright shaft, drives one or more stone nuts on the shafts driving each millstone. Post mills sometimes have a head and/or tail wheel driving the stone nuts directly, instead of the spur gear arrangement. Additional gear wheels drive a sack hoist or other machinery.The machinery differs if the windmill is used for other applications than milling grain. A drainage mill uses another set of gear wheels on the bottom end of the upright shaft to drive a scoop wheel or Archimedes' screw. Sawmills use a crankshaft to provide a reciprocating motion to the saws. Windmills have been used to power many other industrial processes, including papermills, threshing mills, and to process oil seeds, <b>wool,</b> <b>paints</b> and stone products.|$|R
40|$|Native American {{populations in}} the Four Corners area have largely lost their {{connection}} to agriculture and face serious health challenges due to poor diet and limited availability of nutritious fruits and vegetables. With the need to address pressing nutritional concerns for Native American’s in the Southwest, this study looks into assessing the germination response of Navajo Spinach, Cleome serrulata, to temperature, scarification requirements, and evaluating approved seed treatments to enhance germination to warrant local production in the Southwest. Historical practices for cultivating and preserving C. serrulata have been documented and outreach products relevant for targeted audiences at Chapter Houses, high school agriculture programs, and Extension are being created. Uses of C. serrulata include dye for <b>wool,</b> <b>paint</b> for pottery, to support bee populations, and provide high nutrition (Vitamin A) food products for Native American communities and livestock. Wild collected C. serrulata seed was collected from various locations in the Navajo and Zuni Reservations were compared to C. serrulata seed from Great Basin Seed Company. Seed viability was tested using Triphenyl tetrazolium chloride. Seed germination trials consisted of chilling at 4 C, 7 C, 10 C, or 20 C for four weeks after being pre-treated with or without hydrogen peroxide and GA 3. Seed presoaked in GA 3 and hydrogen peroxide germinated faster and at higher rates at 4 C compared to other treatments for all locations tested. Understanding the appropriate seed germination conditions from different regions will be important in re-establishing this species as a native crop...|$|R
