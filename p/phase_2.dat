5|$|In March 2016, the MTA began {{advertising}} Requests for Proposals (RFP) {{for three}} new contracts {{for the second}} phase, which were planned to be awarded in summer 2016. In April 2016, the MTA and the State of New York reached a deal to restore funding to <b>Phase</b> <b>2,</b> {{with a total of}} $1.035 billion allocated. On May 24, 2017, the MTA Board increased funding for <b>Phase</b> <b>2</b> by $700 million. The new budget of $1.735 billion would allow for a near-term 30 percent match per Full Funding Grant Agreement process. By August 2017, preliminary work on the line was underway, and the engineering firm AKRF was updating the environmental impact study for <b>Phase</b> <b>2.</b> AKRF had previously prepared the Manhattan East Side Alternatives and the original EIS for the Second Avenue Subway. The design of the project is being done by <b>Phase</b> <b>2</b> Partnership, a joint venture of Parsons-Brinckerhoff and STV. The EIS and design will be finished in 2018.|$|E
5|$|<b>Phase</b> <b>2,</b> {{which does}} not have a set {{timetable}} for construction, is planned to extend service from 96th Street to 125th Street. During <b>Phase</b> <b>2,</b> both East Harlem segments, between 99th Street and 105th Street, and between 110th Street and 120th Street will be connected, modified, and used for normal train service. In 2007, the MTA reported that the segments were in pristine condition. Under the approved plan, the MTA estimates to complete <b>Phase</b> <b>2</b> between 2027 and 2029, by which the Q and rush-hour N trains will be extended to 125th Street.|$|E

40|$|This study {{estimates}} the plume migration of mobile supercritical phase (flowing), aqueous phase (dissolved), and ionic <b>phase</b> CO <b>2</b> (bicarbonate), and evaluates the {{spatial distribution of}} immobile supercritical phase (residual) and mineral <b>phase</b> CO <b>2</b> (carbonates) when CO 2 was sequestered. This utilized a simulation, in an anticline structure of a deep saline aquifer in the Tiechenshan (TCS) field, Taiwan. All of the trapping mechanisms and different CO <b>2</b> <b>phases</b> were studied using the fully coupled geochemical equation-of-state GEM compositional simulator. The mobile supercritical <b>phase</b> CO <b>2</b> moved upward and then accumulated in the up-dip of the structure because of buoyancy. A large amount of immobile supercritical <b>phase</b> CO <b>2</b> was formed {{at the rear of}} the moving plume where the imbibition process prevailed. Both the aqueous and ionic <b>phase</b> CO <b>2</b> finally accumulated in the down-dip of the structure because of convection. The plume volume of aqueous <b>phase</b> CO <b>2</b> was larger than that of the supercritical <b>phase</b> CO <b>2,</b> because the convection process increased vertical sweep efficiency. The up-dip of the structure was not the major location for mineralization, which is different from mobile supercritical <b>phase</b> CO <b>2</b> accumulation...|$|R

40|$|Cyclin A/cdk 2 {{is active}} during S and G <b>2</b> <b>phases</b> {{of the cell}} cycle, but its {{regulation}} and function during G <b>2</b> <b>phase</b> is poorly understood. In this study we have examined the regulation of cyclin A/cdk 2 activity during normal G <b>2</b> <b>phase</b> progression and in genotoxin-induced G 2 arrest. We show that cyclin A/cdk 2 is activated in early G <b>2</b> <b>phase</b> by a cdc 25 activity. In the G <b>2</b> <b>phase</b> checkpoint arrest initiated in response to various forms of DNA damage, the cdc 25 -dependent activation of both cyclin A/cdk 2 and cyclin B 1 /cdc 2 is blocked. Ectopic expression of cdc 25 B, but not cdc 25 C, in G <b>2</b> <b>phase</b> arrested cells efficiently activated both cyclin A/cdk 2 and cyclin B 1 /cdc 2. Finally, we demonstrate that the block in cyclin A/cdk 2 activation in the G 2 checkpoint arrest is independent of ATM/ATR. We speculate that the ATM/ ATR-independent block in G <b>2</b> <b>phase</b> cyclin A/cdk <b>2</b> activation may act as a further layer of checkpoint control, and that blocking G <b>2</b> <b>phase</b> cyclin A/cdk <b>2</b> activation contributes to the G <b>2</b> <b>phase</b> checkpoint arrest...|$|R

5|$|The <b>Phase</b> <b>2</b> {{budget was}} {{originally}} $1.5 billion, {{which would be}} used to start construction of the tunnels; the MTA reduced the amount of money allocated in the budget, projecting that the agency {{would not be able to}} start construction by the end of the 5-year cycle in 2019. Although the MTA previously expressed concerns about funding the Capital Program, a spokesman stated that the reduction in funding was a result of uncertain timing and not money problems. The delay had upset politicians and residents of East Harlem, who objected to the 3-to-4-year delay.|$|E

The massive proportions of the Coronation Class resulted in their prohibition from operating under those wires. Camden's allocation was now run down (the remaining locomotives being transferred to nearby Willesden (1A)), whilst Polmadie's was dispensed with entirely.

5|$|In December 2016, {{after it}} was {{announced}} that <b>Phase</b> <b>2</b> might cost $6 billion, transit experts expressed concern that the Second Avenue Subway might be so excessively costly as to preclude construction of Phases 3 and 4, as well as future expansions. One expert stated that the Phase 1 project was the most expensive subway project in the world, and that compared to other subway systems around the world, the cost of building new subways in New York City was much higher. The Second Avenue Subway's per-mile construction cost is higher than that of other projects in similar cities like London's Crossrail and Paris's Grand Paris Express, which themselves are among the most expensive underground-railway projects in the world. MTA officials stated that the Second Avenue Subway cost as much as it did only because of the complex underground infrastructure in Manhattan, as well as the fact that the New York City Subway runs all the time.|$|E
