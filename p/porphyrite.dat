Gravity {{measurements}} show that granite underlies most of north east Tasmania at depth. Its western edge is a shelf running from Noland Bay in the north to Great Oyster Bay on the east coast. Granite also underlies the east coast with outcrops on Freycinet Peninsula, Maria Island, and Tasman Peninsula and the Hyppolite Rocks. The eastern Bass Strait Islands also show large exposures of granite, including Flinders, Cape Barren, and Clarke Island. Even the Tasmanian islands in the far north of Bass Strait are composed of granite, including Rodondo Island, Moncoeur Island, Kent Group including Deal Island, and Judgement Rocks.

50|$|Many {{years later}} Daubrée, Delesse and others carried on similar experiments, {{but the first}} notable advance was made in 1878, when Fouqué and Lévy began their researches. They succeeded in {{producing}} such rocks as <b>porphyrite,</b> leucite-tephrite, basalt and dolerite, and obtained also various structural modifications well known in igneous rocks, e.g. the porphyritic and the ophitic. Incidentally they showed that while many basic rocks (basalts, etc.) could be perfectly imitated in the laboratory, the acid rocks could not, and advanced the explanation that for the crystallization of the latter the gases never absent in natural rock magmas were indispensable mineralizing agents. It has subsequently been proved that steam, or such volatile substances as certain borates, molybdates, chlorides, fluorides, assist {{in the formation of}} orthoclase, quartz and mica (the minerals of granite). Sir James Hall also made the first contribution to the experimental study of metamorphic rocks by converting chalk into marble by heating it in a closed gun-barrel, which prevented the escape of the carbonic acid at high temperatures. In 1901 Adams and Nicholson carried this a stage further by subjecting marble to great pressures in hydraulic presses and have shown how the foliated structures, frequent in natural marble may be produced artificially.|$|E
50|$|The site {{consists}} of three large stone circles located on an artificially flattened plateau {{on the west bank}} of the Yoneshiro River. The largest circle is between 42 and 45 meters in diameter, and completely encloses a fourth stone circle. The stones, including <b>porphyrite,</b> rhyolite and tuff, were brought from rivers up to five kilometers away, and the site has a moat on its eastern side with a length of more than 100 meters. More than 100 pits have been found, both inside and outside the stone circles, containing terracotta plates and jars, and small clay objects along with hunting and fishing implements and everyday tools. No bones have been found, but soil discoloration indicates that the site was a necropolis and the objects found were ritual or grave-goods. Some 200 clay dogu have also been found on the site, many of which appear to have been intentionally broken. One of the stone circles contains a standing stone which appears to have served as a sun dial.Next to the stone circles, post holes indicate that as many as 37 pit-houses with a width of 3-5 meters and length of 6-7 meters were built on the site, although there is no indication that this was a permanently inhabited settlement.|$|E
50|$|Troullos is the easternmost {{site of the}} Archanes settlement. Tourkoyeitonia, {{in central}} Archanes, {{is the site of}} its palace, likely built in the Middle Minoan period. Excavations began here in 1964 by J. Sakellarakis. It {{contains}} features such as ashlar blocks, poros-stone plaques and blocks, plaster, wood, stucco floor tiles, gypsum, kouskoura slabs, mud bricks, ironstone blocks, schist plaques, blue marble flooring, incurved concave altars, wooden columns and pillars, frescoes and Polytheron doorways. A variety of <b>Porphyrite</b> stone lamps, vases, amphorae, cooking pots, cups, lamps, tools and every-day domestic items such as tweezers have been unearthed at the site. Southwest of Tourkoyeitonia, more of the palace is found. While little remains of the architecture, the walls that are preserved are Middle Minoan III - Late Minoan IA. Linear A tablets and the model of a house were excavated at The Archive along with MMIII-LMIA pottery and several unworked pieces of rock crystal, obsidian and steatite.The man-made enclosure of a spring, partially excavated in 1921 by Sir Arthur Evans, was completed by J. Sakellarakis in 1964. The floor is laid with pebbles, and the walls are poros-stone. Evidence indicates that it was built between Middle Minoan IB and Middle Minoan IIIA, destroyed during Late Minoan IA, and then restored and in various use afterward. The reservoir is within the palace grounds.|$|E
5000|$|This {{particular}} Imperial {{grade of}} porphyry {{came from a}} single quarry in the Eastern Desert of Egypt, from 600 million-year-old andesite of the Arabian-Nubian Shield.

40|$|Studied samples {{represent}} bedrock occurrences {{rather than}} products of transportation by floating ice. Two regions were distinguished: the East Antarctic margin (submarine Maud Ridge) characterized by intensive destruction and oceanization {{of the continental}} crust, and the northwestern part of the Weddell Sea (Powell Basin), where spreading processes are superimposed on the weakly destructed continental crust. Volcanic rocks of the Maud Ridge derive from an enriched mantle source. The following geologic section was observed: young fresh porous basaltic <b>porphyrites</b> underlain by older massive basaltic <b>porphyrites</b> metamorphosed under greenschist-facies conditions. Presence of granulite-facies rocks suggests continental origin for these rocks. Mineralogical and geochemical features of magmatic rocks collected from various areas of the Weddell Sea floor may indicate contribution of deep fluids. We believe that the magmatic replacement of the Precambrian granite-metamorphic complex of the continental basement by basic-ultrabasic mantle material played the main role in transformation of the continental crust into the secondary oceanic crust. This process occurred under significant contribution of fluid flows and uneven activity of geologic processes, in contrast to formation of the primary oceanic crust because of seafloor spreading. Our {{results suggest that the}} basement of the Weddell Sea is of continental origin and has experienced extensive destruction...|$|R

40|$|The Criffell-Dalbeattie pluton from SW Scotland {{is one of}} a {{suite of}} late Caledonian granitoids which are {{associated}} with extensive, contemporaneous and compositionally diverse suits of minor intrusions. The minor intrusive suite associated with the Criffell-Dalbeattie pluton is dominantly composed of a series of porphyritic microdiorites, microgranodiorites and microgranites known collectively as the porphyrite-porphyry series. This series can be divided into two groups, the <b>porphyrites</b> and the quartz porphyries, on the basis of petrography and geochemistry although there is some compositional overlap between the two. Compositionally, the <b>porphyrites</b> and quartz porphyries appear to correspond to the granodiorites and granites, respectively, which comprise the Criffell-Dalbeattie pluton, suggesting that the porphyrite-porphyry series of dykes represent magmas which were tapped from the evolving granitic magma chamber. The most mafic component of the minor intrusive suite is represented by calc-alkaline hornblende- and mica bearing lamprophyres. Geochemical studies, including fractional crystallisation, combine assimilation-fractional crystallisation (AFC) show that these are mafic, LILE and LREE enriched melts derived by low degrees of partial melting of a subduction-modified mantle source. It is suggested that the source of the lamprophyres is "Lake District" lithosphere, metasomatised by Lower Palaeozoic subduction, and thrust under {{the southern part of the}} Southern Uplands. AFC modelling using chemical and isotopic data further suggest that there is a close genetic link between the lamprophyres and the Criffell-Dalbeattie granitoids and that lamprophyres represent the mantle derived precursors of the Criffell-Dalbeattie granitoids...|$|R

40|$|In {{the western}} Baikal area, the {{structural}} position, composition, {{and age of}} volcanic rocks in {{the section of the}} Riphean margin of the Siberian craton were studied. The age of these rocks, earlier assigned to the Khotskaya Formation, is estimated at 274 ± 3 Ma (concordia constructed over 11 zircon grains, SHRIMP-II). The geochemical and isotope compositions of volcanics evidence that they resulted from the melting of mantle source of EM-I type contaminated by crustal material. The intrusion of volcanics into the upper crustal horizons might have been caused by the evolution of the Permian active margin of the Siberian continent, which took place on the background of the closure of the Mongolo-Okhotsk ocean. Based on the results of studies, a new subvolcanic complex of Early Permian age has been recognized in the region, which includes the above-mentioned volcanics and earlier described <b>porphyrite</b> dikes of close age in the Sharyzhalgai uplift. The data obtained disprove the concept that the studied volcanics are of Riphean age; therefore, the available stratigraphic charts of the Siberian Precambrian must be revised. ...|$|E
