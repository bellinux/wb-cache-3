Other surveys on this topic show comparable results. Independent of age, coming-out can potentially result in a difficult life crisis, sometimes leading to thoughts or acts of suicide. While homosexuals have created support networks in the last decades, sadomasochistic support networks are just starting to develop in most countries. In German speaking countries they are only moderately more developed. The Internet is the prime contact point for support groups today, allowing for local and international networking. In the US Kink Aware Professionals (KAP) a privately funded, non-profit service provides the community with referrals to psychotherapeutic, medical, and legal professionals who are knowledgeable about and sensitive to the BDSM, fetish, and leather community. In the US and the UK, the Woodhull Freedom Foundation & Federation, National Coalition for Sexual Freedom (NCSF) and Sexual Freedom Coalition (SFC) have emerged to represent the interests of sadomasochists. The German Bundesvereinigung Sadomasochismus e.V. is committed to the same aim of providing information and driving press relations.

Samples were collected before and after chlorination from an activated sludge wastewater treatment plant and from <b>the</b> effluent <b>of</b> a high-rate enhanced flocculation system, followed by UV light disinfection. Cell monolayers were observed for cytopathic effect (CPE) after two passages of 14 days each. Monolayers exhibiting viral CPE were tested for <b>the</b> presence <b>of</b> adenoviruses and enteroviruses by PCR or reverse transcription-PCR. Eight <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>samples</b> exhibited CPE on BGM cells, and 57 % showed CPE on PLC/PRF/ 5 cells. Only enteroviruses were detected on the BGM cells, while 30 % and 52 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>samples</b> were positive for enteroviruses and adenoviruses, respectively, on the PLC/PRF/ 5 cells. Thirty <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>samples</b> were positive for both adenoviruses and enteroviruses in chlorinated activated sludge effluent. Thirty <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>samples</b> were positive for adenoviruses in the UV treatment effluent, but no enteroviruses were detected. In conclusion, the PLC/PRF/ 5 cells were more susceptible than BGM cells to viruses found in treated sewage. <b>The</b> use <b>of</b> BGM cells for TCVA may underestimate viral concentration in sewage effluent <b>samples.</b> <b>The</b> PLC/PRF/ 5 cells were more susceptible to adenoviruses, which is important in <b>the</b> evaluation <b>of</b> UV disinfection systems because adenoviruses are highly resistant to UV inactivation...|$|R
