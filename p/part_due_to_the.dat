The Spanish also retained many quality horses, in <b>part</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> historic reputation of {{the region as a}} horse-breeding land, and partially due to the cultural influences related to the Islamic conquest of the Iberian peninsula between the 8th and 15th centuries.|$|E

5|$|The {{counterculture}} of the 1960s had rapidly {{declined by}} {{the start of}} the 1970s, in large <b>part</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> collapse of the commune movement, but it would be many former members of the counter-culture and hippie subculture who subsequently became early adherents of the New Age movement.|$|E

5|$|Traditional Victorian dancing fairies and elves {{appear in}} much of Tolkien's early poetry, and have {{influence}} upon his later works in <b>part</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> influence of a production of J.

5|$|Worker {{death is}} an {{important}} factor in colony failure, and is the cause of 13–76% of colony failures. This may be in <b>part</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> small colony size. Because the colonies are small, worker longevity is crucial for the survival of the nest.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with most}} of the Riverina region, the {{majority}} of Wagga Wagga residents supported the federation of the Australian colonies, in large <b>part</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> prospect of free trade across colonial borders. In 1898, a group of residents promoted Wagga Wagga for consideration as the site of the future national capital due to its location equidistant from Sydney and Melbourne and its ample water supply. Despite the bid's lack of success, in the 1899 referendum Wagga Wagga residents voted strongly in favour of federation.|$|E

Over the next few years, Comedy Central's viewership spiked largely due to South Park, adding 3 million new subscribers {{in the first half of}} 1998 alone and allowed the network to sign international deals with networks in several countries.|$|E
5|$|Before the Treaty of Lisbon {{came into}} force, the {{executive}} {{power of the}} EU was held by the Council: it conferred on the Commission such powers for it to exercise. However, the Council was allowed to withdraw these powers, exercise them directly, or impose conditions on their use. This aspect has been changed by the Treaty of Lisbon, after which the Commission exercises its powers just {{by virtue of the}} treaties. Powers are more restricted than most national executives, in <b>part</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Commission's lack of power over areas like foreign policy– that power is held by the European Council, which some analysts have described as another executive.|$|E

Despite {{regularly}} playing street football, Costa did not believe as a child that he would turn professional, in <b>part</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> remote location of his hometown.

5|$|Dayton's {{population}} declined {{significantly from}} a peak of 262,332 residents in 1960 to only 141,527 in 2010. This was in <b>part</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> slowdown of the region's manufacturing and the growth of Dayton's affluent suburbs including Oakwood, Englewood, Beavercreek, Springboro, Miamisburg, Kettering, and Centerville. The city's most populous ethnic group, white, declined from 78.1% in 1960 to 51.7% by 2010. However, recent census estimates show a 1.3% population increase since 2010, the first increase in five decades.|$|E
5|$|During the war, {{two state}} {{elections}} were held, in 1941 and 1944. In the 1941 election, {{there was a}} significant decrease in the independent vote, and both the Labor Party and the LCL made gains, with Playford forming the LCL's first majority government. This was in large <b>part</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> LCL's shift to the right on social issues to usurp the independents' appeal. In 1942, compulsory voting (but not enrolment) was introduced, and first took effect at the 1944 election, with an increase in voter turnout from 51% to 89%. Again Playford won with a one-seat LCL majority, hanging on {{with the help of the}} malapportioned electoral system.|$|E

The institute measured the performance of all premiers for their time in office, which was the 2011-2012 fiscal year for Dunderdale, and looked at their performance on three core components of fiscal policy: government spending, taxes, and debt and deficits. Dunderdale received a score of 71.4 {{out of a possible}} 100.0, though the report did mention that her strong performance with regards to government spending was in <b>part</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> province’s significant economic growth and not her ability to restrain growth in spending.|$|E
