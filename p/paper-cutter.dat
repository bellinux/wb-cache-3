60|$|Mr. Tolman {{looked at}} the knives when the old lady showed them to him, and after {{a good deal of}} {{consideration}} he selected one which he thought would be a good knife to give to a boy. Then he looked over some things in the way of <b>paper-cutters,</b> whist-markers, and such small matters, which were in a glass case on the counter.

60|$|As sailors, the {{men were}} {{somewhat}} better able to support the dull hopelessness of their lives than others would have been. Most of them were handy {{in some way or}} other, and as they were permitted by the authorities to make anything they could, they passed much of their time in working at something or other. Some cut out and rigged model ships, others knitted, some made quilts from patches purchased for a trifle by the warders for them in the town, some made fancy boxes of straw, others carved walking-sticks, <b>paper-cutters,</b> and other trifles.|$|R

6000|$|MY DEAR MISS BOODLE,--Nobody {{writes a}} better letter than my Gamekeeper: so gay, so pleasant, so engagingly particular, {{answering}} (by some delicate instinct) {{all the questions}} she suggests. It is a shame you should get such a poor return as I can make, from a mind essentially and originally incapable of the art epistolary. I would let the <b>paper-cutter</b> take my place; but I am sorry to say the little wooden seaman did after the manner of seamen, and deserted in the Societies. The place {{he seems to have}} stayed at--seems, for his absence was not observed till we were near the Equator--was Tautira, and, I assure you, he displayed good taste, Tautira being as [...] "nigh hand heaven" [...] as a <b>paper-cutter</b> or anybody has a right to expect.|$|E
6000|$|The lady to {{whom the}} {{following}} (and much correspondence yet to come) [...] is addressed had been an attached friend of the Skerryvore household [...] and a pupil of Stevenson's {{in the art of}} writing. She had given R. L. [...] S. a <b>paper-cutter</b> by way of farewell token at his starting.|$|E
6000|$|The next morning, in such {{intervals}} as {{her studies}} permitted, Janet continued her attentions to Cynthia. That same morning {{she had brought}} a note from her father to Miss Sadler, {{of the contents of}} which Janet knew nothing. Miss Sadler retired into her study to read it, and two newspaper clippings fell out of it under the <b>paper-cutter.</b> This was the note:-- ...|$|E
6000|$|At {{last the}} banker rang, sharply, the bell on his desk. A {{secretary}} entered, {{to whom he}} dictated a telegram which contained these words: [...] "Langmaid has discovered a way out." [...] It was {{to be sent to}} an address in Texas. Then he turned in his chair and crossed his knees, his hand fondling an ivory <b>paper-cutter.</b> He smiled a little.|$|E
60|$|Morley had not a cent in his pockets; but {{he smiled}} pityingly at a hundred grimy, unfortunate {{ones who had}} no more, and who would have no more when the sun's first rays yellowed the tall <b>paper-cutter</b> {{building}} {{on the west side}} of the square. But Morley would have enough by then. Sundown had seen his pockets empty before; but sunrise had always seen them lined.|$|E
60|$|She {{sank into}} a chair by his side. A slight smile parted her lips as she glanced around. On a table by his side, a table drawn back into {{the shade of the}} cedar tree, were several vellum-bound volumes, a tall glass, and a crystal jug half full of some {{delicate}} amber beverage, mixed with fruit and ice, a box of cigarettes, an ivory <b>paper-cutter,</b> and a fan.|$|E
60|$|Have {{you ever}} had a man try to explain to you what {{happened}} in a book as far as he has read? It is a most instructive thing. Sinclair, the man who shares my rooms with me, made such an attempt the other night. I had come in cold and tired from a walk and found him full of excitement, with a bulky magazine {{in one hand and a}} <b>paper-cutter</b> gripped in the other.|$|E
6000|$|But Mamma's oppinions {{and ideas}} upon {{the subject of}} {{bringing}} up [...] children has always been more or less of a joke in our family, [...] perticularly since Papa's article in the [...] "Christian Union," [...] and I [...] am sure Clara and I have related {{the history of our}} old family [...] <b>paper-cutter,</b> our punishments and privations with rather more pride [...] and triumph than any other sentiment, because of Mamma's way of [...] rearing us.|$|E
60|$|Breakfast over, she {{accompanied}} {{the young man}} to the platform, bought him the Graphic, the Athenæum, and a <b>paper-cutter,</b> {{and stood on the}} step conversing till the whistle sounded. Then she put her head into the carriage. ‘Black face and shining eye!’ she whispered, and instantly leaped down upon the platform, with a thrill of gay and musical laughter. As the train steamed out of the great arch of glass, the sound of that laughter still rang in the young man’s ears.|$|E
60|$|We {{reached the}} {{restaurant}} on the height called the Chapeau {{at four in the}} afternoon. It was a memento-factory, and the stock was large, cheap, and varied. I bought the usual <b>paper-cutter</b> to remember the place by, and had Mont Blanc, the Mauvais Pas, {{and the rest of the}} region branded on my alpenstock; then we descended to the valley and walked home without being tied together. This was not dangerous, for the valley was five miles wide, and quite level.|$|E

60|$|Indeed, Lady Northmoor, who {{was very}} much afraid of spoiling him, was often distressed when such scenes as this took place. 'Mite! Mite, dear, no!' when his fat little hands had grasped an ivory <b>paper-cutter,</b> and its blade {{was on the way}} to the button mouth. 'No!' as he paused and looked at her. 'Here's Mite's ball! poor little dear, do let him have it'--and Mite, reading sympathy in his aunt's face, laughed in a {{fascinating}} triumphant manner, and took a bite with his small teeth.|$|E
6000|$|... "That's {{what the}} novelists teach, and we bachelors {{get most of}} our {{doctrine}} about women from them." [...] He closed his novel on the <b>paper-cutter,</b> and, laying the book upon the table, clasped his hands together {{at the back of}} his head. [...] "We don't go to nature for our impressions; but neither do the novelists, for that matter. Now and then, however, in the way of business, I get a glimpse of realities that make me doubt my prophets. Who had this experience?" ...|$|E
6000|$|We lounged into an {{apartment}} {{where there was a}} great crowd, {{to see what was going}} on. It was a memento-magazine. The tourists were eagerly buying all sorts and styles of paper-cutters, marked [...] "Souvenir of the Rigi," [...] with handles made of the little curved horn of the ostensible chamois; there were all manner of wooden goblets and such things, similarly marked. I was going to buy a <b>paper-cutter,</b> but I believed I could remember the cold comfort of the Rigi-Kulm without it, so I smothered the impulse.|$|E
6000|$|There was a choke in the captain's {{voice as}} he leaned over to put the <b>paper-cutter</b> {{in his pocket and}} to pick up his pipe, which he had laid on the bench beside him. Mr. Easterfield was touched and surprised. He would not have {{supposed}} the captain to be a man of such tender sentiment. And he took him at once to his heart. [...] "It is a shame," [...] his thoughts ran, [...] "for this man to be separated from the niece he so loves. She is a cold-hearted girl, or she does not understand him. It must not be." ...|$|E
6000|$|Tea {{was brought}} in. A sense of at-homeness stole over me,--I was {{more at home}} here in this room with Nancy, {{than in any other}} place in the world; here, where {{everything}} was at once soothing yet stimulating, expressive of her, even the smaller objects that caught my eye,--the crystal inkstand tipped with gold, the racks for the table books, her <b>paper-cutter.</b> Nancy's was a discriminating luxury. And her talk! The lightness with which she touched life, the unexplored depths of her, guessed at but never fathomed! Did she feel a little the need of me as I felt the need of her? ...|$|E
60|$|Most of the letters, {{as he had}} anticipated, were painful reading. And {{the silver}} <b>paper-cutter</b> with which he opened the first had been a Christmas present from Mrs. Burlingame, who had penned it, a lady of signal devotion to the church, who for many years had made it her task to supply and arrange the flowers on the altar. He had amazed and wounded her--she declared--inexpressibly, and {{she could no longer}} remain at St. John's--for the present, at least. A {{significant}} addition. He dropped the letter, and sat staring out of the window... presently arousing himself, setting himself resolutely to the task of reading the rest.|$|E
6000|$|His {{assurance}} was needed, for Charlotte {{went down}} thinking {{she had never}} seen master look so stern. He had spoken from a sense that the truth was due to the generous girl, but each word had been intense pain. He wrote on, often interrupted by little riots among the children, and finally by a sharp contention, the twins having possessed themselves of a paper-knife, which Kitty, with precocious notions of discipline, considered as forbidden; and little Mercy was rapped over the fingers in the struggle. The roar brought down interference, and Kitty fell into disgrace; but when, after long persuasion, she was induced to yield the <b>paper-cutter,</b> kiss and make friends, Mercy, instead of embracing, locked her fingers into her dark curls, and tugged at them in a way so opposite to her name, that all Kitty's offence was forgotten in her merit for stopping her scream half-way {{at the sight of her}} father's uplifted finger, and his whisper of 'Poor mamma!' ...|$|E
60|$|By this {{it may be}} {{perceived}} that Kate and Ernest had become tolerably intimate friends. They had informed each other of what games were their favourites; Kate had told him the Wardour names and ages; and required from him in return those of his brothers and sisters. She had been greatly delighted by learning that Adelaide was no end of a hand at climbing trees; and that whenever she should come and stay at their house, Ernest would teach her to ride. And then they began to consider what play was possible under the present circumstances-- beginning they hardly knew how, by dodging one another round and round the table, making snatches at one another, gradually assuming the characters of hunter and Red Indian. Only when the hunter had snatched up Aunt Jane's tortoise-shell <b>paper-cutter</b> to stab with, complaining direfully {{that it was a}} stupid place, with nothing for a gun, and the Red Indian's crinoline had knocked down two chairs, she recollected the consequences in time to strangle her own war-whoop, and suggested that they should be safer on the stairs; to which Ernest readily responded, adding that there was a great gallery at home all full of pillars and statues, the jolliest place in the world for making a row.|$|E

60|$|The {{moment that}} the young Duke was settled at Richmond, all the intrigues of the Fitz-pompey family were {{directed}} to that quarter; and as Mr. Dacre was by nature unsuspicious, and was even desirous that his ward should cultivate the friendship of his only relatives, the St. Maurice family had the gratification, as they thought, of completely deceiving him. Lady Fitz-pompey called twice a week at Crest House with a supply of pine-apples or bonbons, and the Rev. Dr. Coronet bowed in adoration. Lady Isabella St. Maurice gave a china cup to Mrs. Coronet, and Lady Augusta a <b>paper-cutter</b> to Miss. The family was secured. All discipline was immediately set at defiance, and the young Duke passed {{the greater part of}} the half-year with his affectionate relations. His Grace, charmed with the bonbons of his aunt and the kisses of his cousins, which were even sweeter than the sugar-plums; delighted with the pony of St. Maurice, which immediately became his own; and inebriated by the attentions of his uncle,--who, at eight years of age, treated him, as his Lordship styled it, 'like a man'--contrasted this life of early excitement with what now appeared the gloom and the restraint of Castle Dacre, and he soon entered into the conspiracy, which had long been hatching, with genuine enthusiasm. He wrote to his guardian, and obtained permission to spend his vacation with his uncle. Thus, through the united indulgence of Dr. Coronet and Mr. Dacre, the Duke of St. James {{became a member of the}} family of St. Maurice.|$|E
60|$|He {{had spent}} part of his student life in Europe, and he looked back to his travel there with a fondness that the Old World inspires less and less in Americans. This, with his {{derivation}} {{from one of the}} unliterary Boston suburbs, and his unambitious residence in a place like Hatboro', gave her a sense of provinciality in him. On his part, he apparently found it droll that a woman of her acquaintance with a larger life should be willing to live in Hatboro' at all, and he seemed incredulous about her staying after summer was over. She felt that she mystified him, and sometimes she felt the pursuit of a curiosity which was a little too like a psychical diagnosis. He had a way of sitting beside her table and playing with her <b>paper-cutter,</b> while he submitted with a quizzical smile to her endeavours to turn him to account. She did not mind his laughing at her eagerness (a woman is willing enough to join a man in making fun of her femininity if she believes that he respects her), and she tried to make him talk about Hatboro', and tell her how she could be of use among the working people. She would have liked very much to know whether he gave his medical service gratis among them, and whether he found it a pleasure and a privilege to do so. There was one moment when she would have liked to ask him to let her be at the charges of his more indigent patients, but with the words behind her lips she perceived that it would not do. At the best, it would be taking his opportunity from him and making it hers. She began to see that one ought to have a conscience about doing good.|$|E

60|$|There is {{no greater}} mistake than to suppose that fairies, champions, distressed damsels, and by {{consequence}} ogres, have ceased to exist. It may not be OGREABLE to them (pardon the horrible pleasantry, but as I am writing in the solitude of my chamber, I am grinding my teeth--yelling, roaring, and cursing--brandishing my scissors and <b>paper-cutter,</b> and as it were, have become an ogre). I say there {{is no greater}} mistake than to suppose that ogres have ceased to exist. We all KNOW ogres. Their caverns are round us, and about us. There are the castles of several ogres within a mile of the spot where I write. I think some of them suspect I am an ogre myself. I am not: but I know they are. I visit them. I don't mean to say that they take a cold roast prince out of the cupboard, and have a cannibal feast before ME. But I see the bones lying about the roads to their houses, and in the areas and gardens. Politeness, of course, prevents me from making any remarks; but I know them well enough. One of the ways to know 'em is to watch the scared looks of the ogres' wives and children. They lead an awful life. They are present at dreadful cruelties. In their excesses those ogres will stab about, and kill not only strangers who happen to call in and ask a night's lodging, but they will outrage, murder, and chop up their own kin. We all know ogres, I say, and have been in their dens often. It is not necessary that ogres who ask you to dine should offer their guests the PECULIAR DISH which they like. They cannot always get a Tom Thumb family. They eat mutton and beef too; and I dare say even go out to tea, and invite you to drink it. But I tell you there are numbers of them going about in the world. And now you have my word for it, and this little hint, it is quite curious what an interest society may be made to have for you, by your determining to find out the ogres you meet there.|$|E
60|$|We {{got under}} way and passed Punta Gorda, {{where there is a}} colony of tame Indians from the {{province}} of Missiones. We sailed rapidly down the current, but before sunset, from a silly fear of bad weather, we brought-to in a narrow arm of the river. I took the boat and rowed some distance up this creek. It was very narrow, winding, and deep; on each side a wall thirty or forty feet high, formed by trees intwined with creepers, gave to the canal a singularly gloomy appearance. I here saw a very extraordinary bird, called the Scissor-beak (Rhynchops nigra). It has short legs, web feet, extremely long-pointed wings, and is of {{about the size of a}} tern. The beak is flattened laterally, that is, in a plane at right angles to that of a spoonbill or duck. It is as flat and elastic as an ivory <b>paper-cutter,</b> and the lower mandible, differently from every other bird, is an inch and a half longer than the upper. In a lake near Maldonado, from which the water had been nearly drained, and which, in consequence, swarmed with small fry, I saw several of these birds, generally in small flocks, flying rapidly backwards and forwards close to the surface of the lake. They kept their bills wide open, and the lower mandible half buried in the water. Thus skimming the surface, they ploughed it in their course: the water was quite smooth, and it formed a most curious spectacle to behold a flock, each bird leaving its narrow wake on the mirror-like surface. In their flight they frequently twist about with extreme quickness, and dexterously manage with their projecting lower mandible to plough up small fish, which are secured by the upper and shorter half of their scissor-like bills. This fact I repeatedly saw, as, like swallows, they continued to fly backwards and forwards close before me. Occasionally when leaving the surface of the water their flight was wild, irregular, and rapid; they then uttered loud harsh cries. When these birds are fishing, the advantage of the long primary feathers of their wings, in keeping them dry, is very evident. When thus employed, their forms resemble the symbol by which many artists represent marine birds. Their tails are much used in steering their irregular course.|$|E

It was all very well as long as things seemed to be going right, but I believe in people who stand by you when things seem to be going wrong, and who keep on standing by you until they know how they are going, and that is exactly what she did not do. Now, there was Dick Lancaster; he came to me and asked me squarely about that affair. To be sure, I cut him off short, for it angered me to think that he, or anybody else, should have such an idea of me, and, besides, it was none of his business. But it should have been her business; she ought to have made it her business; and, even if the thing had stood differently, I would have told her exactly how it did stand; and then she could have said to me what she thought about it, and {{what she was going to}} do. But instead of that, she just made up her mind about me, and away went everything. Yes, sir, everything. I can't tell you the plans I had made for her and for myself, and, I may say, for Dick Lancaster. If it suited her, I wanted her to marry him, and if it suited her I wanted to go and live with them in his college town, or any other place they might want to go. Again and again, after I knew Dick, have I gone over this thing and planned it out this way, and that way, but always with us three in the middle of everything. Do you see that?" [...] continued the captain after a slight pause, as he drew from his pocket a dainty little pearl <b>paper-cutter.</b> [...] "That belongs to her. She used to sit out here, and cut the leaves of books as she read them. I can see her little hand now as it went sliding along the edges of the pages. When she went away she left it on the bench, and I took it. And I've kept it in my pocket to take out when I sit here, and cut books with it when I have 'em. I haven't many books that ain't cut, but I've sat here and cut 'em till there wasn't any left. And then I cut a lot of old volumes of Coast Survey Reports. It is a foolish thing for an old man to do, but then--but then--well, you see, I did it." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{had to take}} a {{great deal}} of this on faith; in fact, none of it was {{susceptible}} of proof; but I have not been able since to experience all the skepticism which usually replaces the impression left by sympathy with such supposed occurrences. The thing was not quite what we call uncanny; the people were so honest, both of them, that the morbid character of like situations was wanting. The events, if they could be called so, were not invited, I was quite sure, and they were varied by such diversions as we had in reach. I went blueberrying with Mrs. Alderling in the morning after she had got her breakfast dishes put away, in order that we might have something for dessert at our midday dinner; and I went fishing off the old stone crib with Alderling in the afternoon, so that we might have cunners for supper. The farmerfolks and fisherfolks seemed to know them and to be on tolerant terms with them, though it was plain that they still considered them probational in their fellow-citizenship. I do not think they were liked the less because they did not assume to be of the local sort, but let their difference stand, if it would. There was nothing countrified in her dress, which was frankly conventional; the short walking-skirt had as sharp a slant in front as her dinner-gown would have had, and he wore his knickerbockers--it was then the now-faded hour of knickerbockers--with an air of going out golfing in the suburbs. They stood on ceremony in addressing the natives, who might have been Jim or Liza to each other, but were always Mr. Donald or Mrs. Moody, with the Alderlings. They said they would not like being called by their first names themselves, and they did not see why they should take that freedom with others. Neither by nature nor by nurture were they out of the ordinary in their ideals, and it was by a sort of accident that they were so different in their realities. She had stayed on with him through the first winter in the place they had taken for the summer, because she wished to be with him, rather than because she wished to be there, and he had stayed because he had not just found the moment to break away, though afterwards he pretended a reason for staying. They had no more voluntarily cultivated the natural than the supernatural; he kindled the fire for her, and she made the coffee for him, not because they preferred, but because they must; and they had arrived at their common ground in the occult by virtue of being alone together, and not by seeking the solitude for the experiment which the solitude promoted. Mrs. Alderling did not talk less, nor he more, when either was alone with me, than when we were all together; perhaps he was more silent, and she not quite so much; she was making up for him in his absence as he was for her in her presence. But they were always hospitable and attentive hosts, and though under the peculiar circumstances of Mrs. Alderling's having to do the house-work I necessarily had to do a good many things for myself, there were certain little graces which were never wanting, from her hands: my curtains were always carefully drawn, and my coverlet triangularly opened, so that I did not have to pull it down myself. There was a freshly trimmed lamp on the stand at my bed-head, and a book and <b>paper-cutter</b> put there, with a decanter of whiskey and a glass of water. I note these things to you, because they are touches which help remove the sense of anything intentional in the occultism of the Alderlings.|$|E
