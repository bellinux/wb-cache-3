The relevant parameter is then the treewidth of the primal constraint graph.|$|E
5|$|After a final {{check of}} the weather reports for Germany and the North Sea, Hess took off at 17:45 on 10 May 1941 from the {{airfield}} at Augsburg-Haunstetten in his specially prepared aircraft. It was the last of several attempts to depart on his mission; previous efforts had to be called off due to mechanical <b>problems</b> <b>or</b> poor weather. Wearing a leather flying suit bearing the rank of captain, he brought along a supply of money and toiletries, a torch, a camera, maps and charts, and a collection of 28 different medicines, as well as dextrose tablets to help ward off fatigue and an assortment of homeopathic remedies.|$|E

5|$|All {{vanadium}} compounds {{should be}} considered toxic. Tetravalent VOSO4 {{has been reported to}} be at least 5 times more toxic than trivalent V2O3. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has set an exposure limit of 0.05 mg/m3 for vanadium pentoxide dust and 0.1 mg/m3 for vanadium pentoxide fumes in workplace air for an 8-hour workday, 40-hour work week. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has recommended that 35 mg/m3 of vanadium be considered immediately dangerous to life and health, that is, likely to cause permanent health <b>problems</b> <b>or</b> death.|$|E
5|$|Amnesic {{shellfish}} poisoning (ASP) {{was first}} reported in eastern Canada in 1987. It {{is caused by}} the substance domoic acid found in certain diatoms of the genus Pseudo-nitzschia. Bivalves can become toxic when they filter these microalgae out of the water. Domoic acid is a low-molecular weight amino acid that is able to destroy brain cells causing memory loss, gastroenteritis, long-term neurological <b>problems</b> <b>or</b> death. In an outbreak in the western United States in 1993, finfish were also implicated as vectors, and seabirds and mammals suffered neurological symptoms. In the United States and Canada, a regulatory limit of 20µg/g of domoic acid in shellfish meat is set.|$|E
5|$|Dementia {{caregivers}} {{are subject}} to high rates of physical and mental disorders. Factors associated with greater psychosocial problems of the primary caregivers include having an affected person at home, the carer being a spouse, demanding behaviours of the cared person such as depression, behavioural disturbances, hallucinations, sleep <b>problems</b> <b>or</b> walking disruptions and social isolation. Regarding economic problems, family caregivers often give up time from work to spend 47 hours per week on average with the person with AD, while the costs of caring for them are high. Direct and indirect costs of caring for an Alzheimer's patient average between $18,000 and $77,500 {{per year in the}} United States, depending on the study.|$|E

5|$|Dyslexia is {{believed}} to be caused by both genetic and environmental factors. Some cases run in families. It often occurs in people with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and is associated with similar difficulties with numbers. It may begin in adulthood {{as the result of a}} traumatic brain injury, stroke, or dementia. The underlying mechanisms of dyslexia are problems within the brain's language processing. Dyslexia is diagnosed through a series of tests of memory, spelling, vision, and reading skills. Dyslexia is separate from reading difficulties caused by hearing or vision <b>problems</b> <b>or</b> by insufficient teaching.|$|E
5|$|Hepatic {{encephalopathy}} {{can occur}} in those with acute or chronic liver disease. Episodes can be triggered by infections, GI bleeding, constipation, electrolyte <b>problems,</b> <b>or</b> certain medications. The underlying mechanism is believed to involve the build up of ammonia in the blood, a substance that is normally removed by the liver. The diagnosis is typically made after ruling out other potential causes. It may be supported by blood ammonia levels, an electroencephalogram, or a CT scan of the brain.|$|E
5|$|In captivity, only Campbell's dwarf hamsters and Djungarian hamsters {{are able}} to interbreed and produce live {{offspring}} or hybrids. Although hybrids make suitable pets, the breeding of hybrids and cloning can cause health problems, due to inherited diseases. Because genetic information can be very similar, genetic health <b>problems</b> <b>or</b> vulnerabilities can easily be inherited by the offspring. The widespread breeding and distribution of hybrids could threaten the existence of both pure species and subspecies of the ecosystem. This could ultimately lead to the extinction of the subspecies. Each litter becomes smaller as more generations are produced and the young commonly begin to inherit many congenital problems.|$|E

5|$|Management of {{low back}} pain depends on which of the three general {{categories}} is the cause: mechanical problems, non-mechanical <b>problems,</b> <b>or</b> referred pain. For acute pain that is causing only mild to moderate problems, the goals are to restore normal function, return the individual to work, and minimize pain. The condition is normally not serious, resolves without much being done, and recovery is helped by attempting to return to normal activities {{as soon as possible}} within the limits of pain. Providing individuals with coping skills through reassurance of these facts is useful in speeding recovery. For those with sub-chronic or chronic {{low back pain}}, multidisciplinary treatment programs may help. Initial management with non–medication based treatments is recommended, with NSAIDs used if these are not sufficiently effective.|$|E
5|$|No {{treatments}} stop {{or reverse}} its progression, though some may temporarily improve symptoms. Affected people increasingly rely on others for assistance, often placing {{a burden on}} the caregiver; the pressures can include social, psychological, physical, and economic elements. Exercise programmes may be beneficial with respect to {{activities of daily living}} and can potentially improve outcomes. Treatment of behavioural <b>problems</b> <b>or</b> psychosis due to dementia with antipsychotics is common, but not usually recommended, as there is little benefit with an increased risk of early death.|$|E
5|$|The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) {{warned in}} 2014 that {{over-the-counter}} acne products containing benzoyl peroxide and/or salicylic acid, including Proactiv, can cause severe irritation, {{as well as}} rare but life-threatening allergic reactions. Consumers were advised to stop using the products if they experience hives or itching, and to seek emergency medical attention if they feel faint, or experience throat tightness, breathing <b>problems,</b> <b>or</b> swelling of the eyes, face, lips or tongue. The FDA noted that it remains unclear whether the reactions are caused by the active ingredients, inactive ingredients or a combination.|$|E

This list is not exhaustive: many more applications exist, for example in optimization. The minimax theorem of game theory stating the existence of a unique payoff when all players play optimally can be formulated and proven using vector spaces methods. Representation theory fruitfully transfers the good understanding of linear algebra and vector spaces to other mathematical domains such as group theory.|$|E
5|$|Henry VI {{proved to}} be a weak king and {{vulnerable}} to the over-mighty subjects who developed private armies of retainers. Rivalries often spilled over from the courtroom into armed confrontations, such as the Percy–Neville feud. Without the common purpose of the war in France, Henry's cousin Richard of York, 3rd Duke of York, and Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick, used their networks to defy the crown. Henry became the focus of discontent as the population, agricultural production, prices, the wool trade and credit declined in the Great Slump. This led to radical demands from the lower classes. In 1450, Jack Cade raised a rebellion to force Henry to address the economic <b>problems</b> <b>or</b> abdicate his throne. The uprising was suppressed but conflict remained between villagers, gentry and aristocracy. Society remained deeply unsettled and radical demands continued to be suppressed such as those from the yeoman brothers John and William Merfold.|$|E
5|$|Many {{mushroom}} {{species are}} poisonous to humans, with toxicities ranging from slight digestive <b>problems</b> <b>or</b> allergic reactions {{as well as}} hallucinations to severe organ failures and death. Genera with mushrooms containing deadly toxins include Conocybe, Galerina, Lepiota, and, the most infamous, Amanita. The latter genus includes the destroying angel (A.virosa) and the death cap (A.phalloides), {{the most common cause}} of deadly mushroom poisoning. The false morel (Gyromitra esculenta) is occasionally considered a delicacy when cooked, yet can be highly toxic when eaten raw. Tricholoma equestre was considered edible until it was implicated in serious poisonings causing rhabdomyolysis. Fly agaric mushrooms (Amanita muscaria) also cause occasional non-fatal poisonings, mostly as a result of ingestion for its hallucinogenic properties. Historically, fly agaric was used by different peoples in Europe and Asia and its present usage for religious or shamanic purposes is reported from some ethnic groups such as the Koryak people of north-eastern Siberia.|$|E
