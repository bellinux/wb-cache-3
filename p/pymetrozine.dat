40|$|Abstract. BACKGROUND: Insecticide {{resistance}} in Trialeurodes vaporariorum W. is {{unknown in the}} species’ northern distribution range where it inhabits mainly commercial greenhouses. Resistance development in whiteflies feeding on year-round crops in greenhouses is possible due to use of chemical treatments to back up biocontrol. We tested the response levels to spiromesifen, <b>pymetrozine</b> and imidacloprid in whiteflies collected from seven greenhouses within a 35 km radius in Western Finland. RESULTS: All except one (PR) population had LC 50 values below the recommended concentrations for the tested compounds. However, some populations showed reduced susceptibility to <b>pymetrozine</b> in comparison to reference susceptible population. Resistance ratios to <b>pymetrozine</b> were highly variable (RR 0. 5 - 39. 7) even among closely-located greenhouses and higher than those for imidacloprid (RR 1. 05 - 10. 5) and spiromesifen (RR 0. 8 - 11. 5). LC 50 values and application frequencies of <b>pymetrozine</b> correlated positively among the sampled populations. CONCLUSION: High variation in resistance levels to <b>pymetrozine</b> among populations within natural whitefly dispersal limits reflects variation in the usage of this compound among individual greenhouse crop producers. Thus, resistance management is recommended on individual greenhouse crop producer level, even in a dense production cluster...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Although {{cross-resistance}} between {{compounds in}} the same insecticide group is a frequently observed phenomenon, cross-resistance between groups that differ in structural and functional characteristics can be extremely unpredictable. In the case of controlling the whitefly, Bemisia tabaci Gennadius, neonicotinoids and the pyridine azomethine antifeedant <b>pymetrozine</b> represent independent lines of discovery that should be suited for alternation to avoid prolonged selection for the same resistance mechanism. Reports of an association between responses to neonicotinoids and <b>pymetrozine</b> were investigated by resistance profiling of seven B. tabaci strains and complementary reciprocal selection experiments. RESULTS: All strains demonstrated a consistent correlation between responses to three neonicotinoid compounds: thiamethoxam, imidacloprid and acetamiprid. Responses to neonicotinoids for six field strains clearly correlated with responses to <b>pymetrozine.</b> Reciprocal selection experiments confirmed an unexpected case of intergroup cross-resistance. A seventh strain exhibited a so far unique phenotype of strong resistance to <b>pymetrozine</b> but full susceptibility to neonicotinoids. Selection experiments confirmed that in this strain the mechanism of <b>pymetrozine</b> resistance is specific and has no implications for neonicotinoids. CONCLUSION: Cross-resistance between neonicotinoids and <b>pymetrozine</b> in B. tabaci probably reflects the overexpression of a cytochrome-P 450 -dependent monooxygenase capable of metabolising both types of compound {{in spite of their}} apparent structural dissimilarity. Given the predominance of this mechanism in B. tabaci, both can contribute to resistance management but should be placed with{{in the same}} treatment 'window'.

Despite relatively frequent use of insecticides to control this pest, data on BPH resistance to insecticides commonly used by farmers in Indonesia is scarce. This study was conducted to assess the susceptibility of BPH from six locations in Java to three insecticides, i. e.

40|$|Copyright © Springer-Verlag 2011. Coccinella undecimpunctata L. is a {{euryphagous}} predator {{established in}} Azores that offers interesting {{potential as a}} control agent {{in the context of}} integrated pest management (IPM). However, to further develop IPM against aphids, it is important to evaluate the effects that insecticides might have on voracity. Thus, we proposed to evaluate the effects of pirimicarb and <b>pymetrozine</b> on the voracity of 4 th instar larvae and adults of C. undecimpunctata, under distinct scenarios of exposure to chemicals within a prey/plant system. Voracity of C. undecimpunctata was not significantly affected by pirimicarb or <b>pymetrozine</b> when treatments were directly sprayed on the predator; however, when insecticides were sprayed on the prey/plant system, the predator’s voracity was significantly increased. Results suggest that C. undecimpunctata does not detect the insecticide on the aphids and indicate that the increase in voracity may be due to a decrease in the mobility of insecticide-treated aphids, since their capture should be easier than highly mobile non-treated prey. The consequences of such increase in the voracity for IPM programs are discussed...|$|E

40|$|The {{whitefly}} Trialeurodes vaporariorum Westwood (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae) is {{a serious}} pest of protected vegetable and ornamental crops in most temperate regions of the world. Neonicotinoids, <b>pymetrozine</b> (a feeding blocker), spiromesifen (a tetronic acid derivative), bifenthrin (a pyrethroid), and pyriproxyfen (a juvenile hormone mimic) {{are among the most}} important insecticides used to control this species. Bioassays were used to quantify responses of recently-collected strains of T. vaporariorum to three neonicotinoids (imidacloprid, thiamethoxam, and acetamiprid), <b>pymetrozine,</b> spiromesifen, bifenthrin, and pyriproxyfen. 454 pyrosequencing was exploited to generate the first transcriptome for this species. PCR-sequencing was used to identify mutations in the target proteins of spiromesifen and bifenthrin potentially associated with resistance to these compounds. Microarray sequencing technology was employed to investigate differences in gene expression associated with pyriproxyfen resistance. Resistance to neonicotinoids was age-specific in expression and consistently associated with resistance to <b>pymetrozine,</b> supporting a hypothesis of metabolic resistance analogous to that in the tobacco whitefly, Bemisia tabaci. Bioassays also showed moderate to high level resistance to spiromesifen, bifenthrin and pyriproxyfen in some strains. Analysis of the transcriptome identified genes encoding enzymes involved in the detoxification of xenobiotics (cytochrome P 450 s, carboxyl/cholinesterases, and glutathione-s transferases) and ones encoding insecticide targets: acetyl-coA carboxylase (ACCase), the target of spiromesifen and the voltage-gated sodium channel protein targeted by pyrethroids. PCR-sequencing revealed a single nucleotide polymorphism in the ACCase gene, which was consistently associated with spiromesifen resistance. Three amino-acid substitutions in the sodium channel of pyrethroid-resistant T. vaporariorum were found in positions previously implicated in pyrethroid resistance in B. tabaci. Microarray sequencing disclosed that a cytochrome P 450 gene (CYP 4 G 61) was overexpressed in a strain selected for increased pyriproxyfen resistance. The implications of these results and opportunities for further work are discussed. BBSRCBayer CropScienc...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{toxicity}} and biochemical {{changes in}} honey bees (Apis mellifera) treated with four insecticides—acetamiprid, dinotefuran, <b>pymetrozine,</b> and pyridalyl—were evaluated under controlled laboratory conditions. Foraging bees {{were exposed to}} different dosages of tested insecticides by oral feeding at different dosages recommended by the manufacturers for agricultural crops in Egypt (0. 01 -, 0. 02 -, 0. 04 -, 0. 1 -, and onefold). Moreover, the acute toxicity of these insecticides was evaluated by topical application on the thorax of foragers to calculate the LD 50 values. The specific activities of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), carboxylesterase, glutathione S-transferase (GST), and polyphenol oxidase (PPO) were measured in different tissues of surviving foragers after 24  h of treatment to explore the possible mode of action of insecticides and honey bees' strategies for detoxification and tolerance. The results indicated that regardless of how the bees were exposed to insecticides, dinotefuran was extremely toxic to adult A. mellifera (topical LD 50 = 0. 0006  μg/bee and oral feeding LC 50 = 1. 29  mg/L). Pyridalyl showed moderate toxicity compared to dinotefuran at the recommended application rate; however, acetamiprid and <b>pymetrozine</b> were relatively less toxic to bees (< 25  % mortality at the recommended application rates). Data showed that tested insecticides varied in their influence on AChE, carboxylesterase, GST, and PPO activities that were highly correlated to their toxicity against A. mellifera. The biochemical analysis of carboxylesterase and GST showed that these enzymes detoxified the low doses of acetamiprid, <b>pymetrozine,</b> and pyridalyl, but not dinotefuran. Overall, our results are valuable not only in evaluating the toxicity of common insecticides onto honey bees, but also in highlighting the validity of enzymes activities as proper indicators for exposure to agrochemicals...|$|E

Parasitoid emergence was not affected by <b>pymetrozine</b> and ranged from 59. 9 % to 75. 0 %, but decreased {{with the increase of}} thiamethoxam concentrations ranging from 30. 2 % to 69. 6 %. Cotton leaves infested by whitefly and treated with recommended rates of both insecticides were collected three hours, three days and six days after spraying and colonized with larvae and adults of D. pusillus. Predators released on thiamethoxam-treated leaves experienced mortality from 70 % to 100 %, while those released on pymetrozine-treated leaves showed mortality from 0 % to 20 %. Topical toxicity from both insecticides was studied on larvae, pupae and adults of D. pusillus. The survival of predator after six days of exposure to 400, 600 and 800 mg/L of <b>pymetrozine</b> a. i. was higher than 69. 6 %, and to 25, 100 and 200 mg/L of thiamethoxam a. i. was lower than 8. 7 %.

40|$|Abstract: Fertilization {{levels for}} {{ornamental}} crops may influence pest population dynamics, crop quality, and pest management strategy. We examined {{the effect of}} fertilization on population growth and within-plant distribution of melon or cotton aphid, Aphis gossypiiGlover, on potted chrysanthemum, Dendranthema grandiflora (Tzvelev). In terms of pest management implications, we also investigated the effect of fertilization {{on the number of}} insecticide applications needed to control A. gossypii on potted chrysanthemum. Population growth rate of A. gossypii increased with fertilization levels from 0 to 38 ppm N and reached a plateau from 38 to 488 ppm N. Increased fertilization beyond 38 ppm N, 10 % of the commercial standard, did not result in higher aphid number. Aphids responded to nutrient availability of plants by distributing themselves in areas with higher level of nitrogen. More aphids were found in the apical and middle strata of the plants than the basal stratum, which had the lowest nitrogen content. Leaf nitrogen content increased with increased fertilization level and was consistently higher in the apical and middle strata than the basal stratum. Increased fertilization from 0 to 375 ppm N did not result in higher number of insecticide applications. All three insecticides (bifenthrin, kinoprene or <b>pymetrozine)</b> were effective in keeping the aphid infestation below a pre-determined level, five aphids per plant, but <b>pymetrozine</b> required the least number of applications. For chrysanthemum, a fast-growing crop and heavy utilizer of nitrogen, increased fertilization shortened the time to flowering, which would allow growers to harvest their crop sooner and reduce the time for aphid population growth...|$|E

40|$|When {{injected}} into adult or nymphal Locusta {{that have been}} deprived of food for 2 h, immunogens such as laminarin and bacterial LPS can induce an almost immediate dose-dependent state of anorexia for at least 1 h. Such anorexia is a component of a medley of physiological and behavioural changes called collectively 'sickness behaviour' that occurs {{in a wide range}} of animals in response to infection or immune challenge. Sub-optimal amounts of injected laminarin allow some locusts to feed, but with a longer latency than in controls, although the length of the first meal is unaffected. The feeding behaviour of fifth instar nymphs is more sensitive to laminarin than that of adults, but both stages respond to amounts of immunogen that are lower than those required to activate the phenoloxidase cascade. Injection of adipokinetic hormone (AKH) before the period of food deprivation prevents the anorexigenic action of the laminarin in adults but not in nymphs. It is argued that the effect of the AKH may be indirect, through its lipid-mobilising action. The insecticide <b>pymetrozine</b> increases the latency to feed but also reduces the length of the first meal, and its anorexigenic activity is not affected by injection of AKH. The present data support the concept that laminarin-induced anorexia involves a central lack of motivation to eat, rather than a 'stop eating' signal. Others have shown that the mechanism of action of <b>pymetrozine</b> involves the serotonergic system and can be blocked by mianserin, so it is intriguing that in the present study injection of mianserin prior to that of laminarin modulates the anorexigenic effect of the immunogen. This suggests that biogenic amines are involved in the control of appetitive behaviour in locusts, as they are in vertebrates. The possible usefulness of the locust model in studying sickness-induced anorexia is discussed briefly...|$|E
