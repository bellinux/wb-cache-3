Thoseconceptions are analyzed specially with respect to the way the subjects refer to what politicalcommitment and political identities were like in the past, concluding there is a doublephenomenon. On one hand, there is an adaptation, in their own and every-day political activitiesand practices, to an environment defined by uncertainty and volatility. On the other hand, theyexpress nostalgic definitions and references to a past in which political identities were allegedlystable, and parties (or their own party, at least) had an intense organic life and a permanent bondwith voters...|$|E
40|$|The {{theoretical}} {{debate over}} the ability of parties and leaders in the House of Representatives to influence legislative decision-making {{is at the center}} of much of the literature on Congress. On the one hand, the Procedural Cartel perspective argues that while the tools used by the majority party leadership to assure the triumph of its preferences may vary depending on the institutional context, the basic ability of the leadership to impact legislative outcomes remains consistent. In contrast, Conditional Party Government (CPG) theory posits that any power the majority party and its leadership possesses over legislative decision-making is directly conditioned upon the amount of agreement within the majority party caucus as to collective goals, as well as the amount of ideological polarization that exists between the majority and minority parties. This thesis provides an original test of these two theoretical perspectives by evaluating their comparative ability to account for the proposal and passage of limitation riders on the House floor during the annual appropriations process since the 1980 s. Limitation riders provide a good vehicle to test theories of congressional voting as they often have important policy implications in areas of significant controversy. In addition, the extent to which the individual members or legislative parties are able to successfully utilize limitation riders as a means of making substantive policy is indicative of larger patterns of committee or party domination of the floor process. After reviewing the relevant literature on congressional decision-making, this analysis proceeds to outline the theoretical predictions that the Procedural Cartel and CPG perspectives make regarding limitation riders. An original dataset comprised of over 800 limitation riders from the 97 th through the 110 th Congresses is analyzed both with respect to overall proposal and passage rates as well their <b>party</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin.</b> This study finds that while the CPG perspective is best able to account for what occurs during periods of low polarization and cohesion, Procedural Cartel provides the most accurate prediction of what occurs when polarization and cohesion are high. These findings suggest that, although these theories both have some ability to account for congressional decision-making on the House floor, both of these frameworks need to be revisited so that they can accurately account for what occurs during floor phase of the legislative process...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{the challenges and}} dilemmas that progressive <b>parties</b> <b>of</b> mass-based <b>origin</b> confront when they exercise state power, {{by looking at the}} governing experience of the Brazilian Workers’ Party (PT), with an emphasis on the administration of Luiz Inázio Lula da Silva (2003 - 2010). It draws on 140 interviews with party and social leaders at all levels, as well as on secondary sources and archival research. Drawing on the notion of governability, the study offers a systematic understanding of the constraints that the party faced in national executive public office, how such constraints were perceived by some of the most influential party leaders, and how these leaders acted upon them. This work contributes to the party literature by paying more attention {{to the way in which}} progressive parties create conditions to govern, which has so far been neglected, and by introducing into the party literature the notion of governability, present in Latin American political debates. The study distinguishes between two different types of governability strategies used by progressive parties: the elitecentred and the social counter-hegemonic. The former accepts the current distribution of power; the latter seeks to alter the balance of forces within state institutions by relying on civil society, mobilisation and participation. I argue that one of the most important transformations in the PT has been the switch from a social counter-hegemonic strategy, very influential in some cities, to an elite-centred one. As a secondary aim, this study provides a new interpretation of the changes that occur in party-civil society relations when progressive <b>parties</b> <b>of</b> mass-based <b>origin</b> gain executive power. This thesis challenges the current accepted wisdom in party and social movement literature that parties tend to move away from their social allies when they enter government; the PT example offers evidence that this is not always the case...|$|R

One aspect <b>of</b> <b>party</b> adaptation is focused upon, namely the adaptation <b>of</b> <b>party</b> goals. The main argument advanced is that the difficulties that Plaid Cymru has faced since 1999 - such as a declining electoral performance, internal divisions over programmatic priorities and party strategy, and leadership struggles - are not unique. Rather, they are difficulties that many political <b>parties,</b> regardless <b>of</b> their <b>origin</b> or ideological orientation, face when they attempt to adapt their goals to major changes in their operating environments.

40|$|This study {{examines}} political party contestation over Europe, {{its relationship to}} the left/right cleavage, and the nature and emergence of Euroscepticism. The analysis is based on a large original sample of parties’ claims systematically drawn from political discourses in the mass media in seven countries: Britain, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Italy, Spain, and Switzerland. It addresses questions concerning parties’ mobilized criticisms of European integration and the European Union (EU), specifically: their degree and form; their location among party families and within party systems; cross-national and diachronic trends; their substantive issue contents; whether their ‘Euro-criticism’ is more tactical or ideological; whether claims construct a cleavage; and their potential for transforming party politics. Findings show that a <b>party’s</b> country <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> has little explanatory power, once differences between compositions <b>of</b> <b>party</b> systems are accounted for. Also governing parties are significantly more likely to be pro-European, regardless <b>of</b> party-type. Regional <b>party</b> representatives, by contrast, are significantly more likely to be ‘Euro-critical’. Overall, we find a lop-sided ‘inverted U’ on the right of the political spectrum, but this is generated entirely by the significant, committed Euroscepticism of the British Conservatives and Schweizerische Volkspartei. There is relatively little evidence for Euroscepticism elsewhere at the core, where pro-Europeanism persists. Finally, parties’ Euro-criticism from the periphery mostly constructs substantive political and economic critiques of European integration and the EU, and is not reducible to strategic anti-systemic challenges...|$|R
