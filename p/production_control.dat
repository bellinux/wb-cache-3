5|$|In early September Nichols {{appointed}} a <b>production</b> <b>control</b> committee, headed by Major A.V. (Pete) Peterson. Peterson's staff tried various combinations, using mechanical calculating machines, {{and decided that}} the S-50 production should be fed to K-25 rather than Y-12, which was done in April 1945. The charts also showed that the proposed top stages for K-25 should be abandoned, as should Lawrence's recommendation to add more alpha stages to the Y-12 plant. Groves accepted their proposal to add more base units to the K-27 gaseous-diffusion plant and one more Beta stage track for Y-12. These additions were estimated to cost $100 million, with completion in February 1946. Soon after Japan surrendered in August 1945, Peterson recommended that S-50 be shut down. The Manhattan District ordered this on 4 September. The last uranium hexafluoride was sent to K-25, and the plant had ceased operation by 9 September. S-50 was completely demolished in 1946.|$|E
5|$|In 1985, Bedell {{put forward}} an {{agricultural}} plan {{that he thought}} would increase <b>production</b> <b>controls</b> for farmers, thus raising prices for crops. This plan, backed by labor unions and certain Democrats, passed the Agriculture Committee as an amendment to farm legislation. It mandated a referendum that would then {{be used to determine}} what types of <b>production</b> <b>controls</b> to enact. The purpose of this plan was twofold: <b>production</b> <b>controls</b> would decrease the aggregate supply of crops, thus making individual crops cost more (which would benefit farmers, who {{were in the middle of}} an acute debt crisis.) Second, by styling it as a referendum, the farmers would get to decide the severity of the controls.|$|R

25|$|Farming {{at first}} {{took place on}} colonial encomiendas. The crown granted {{a small number of}} conquistadors the right to the labor and produce of Indians living on the encomienda, and by the 1650s there were some eighty-two encomiendas in Upper Peru. Encomenderos tended to monopolize {{agricultural}} <b>production,</b> <b>control</b> the cheap Indian labor, and collect the tribute that the Indians had to pay to the crown. Because encomenderos were difficult to control and abused their laborers, the crown tried repeatedly to bring Indians under its direct jurisdiction and control.|$|E
25|$|As the {{industry}} strives to reduce {{maintenance and repair}} costs, non-destructive testing of structures becomes increasingly valued both in <b>production</b> <b>control</b> and {{as a means to}} measure the utilization and condition of key infrastructure. There are several measurement techniques to measure stress in a material. However, techniques using optical measurements, magnetic measurements, X-ray diffraction, and neutron diffraction are all limited to measuring surface or near surface stress or strains. Acoustic waves propagate with ease through materials and provide thus a means to probe the interior of structures, where the stress and strain level is important for the overall structural integrity.|$|E
25|$|The {{two forms}} of colonial-era produce {{marketing}} boards had different aims. Some, as in the Rhodesias, supported white commercial farmers; others as in Nyasaland and Tanganyika controlled African smallholders and restricted competition {{between them and the}} settlers. The declared objectives of Nyasaland’s colonial legislation on the <b>production,</b> <b>control</b> and marketing of economic crops were to increase the quantity and improve the quality of the crops, and to stabilise the income of farmers through periods of price fluctuation. Restrictions were imposed on the number of growers and their output to improve produce quality and to match production to demand. This was done by registering growers, fixing producer prices, licensing buyers and exporters and establishing commodity boards, which often had exclusive responsibility for crop production and marketing. For most of the colonial period, statutory interference in the production and marketing of the crops grown on European-owned estate was kept to a minimum. Controls for their tea and tobacco were introduced at the request, or with the consent, of the settler associations responsible for these crops. The use of marketing controls allowed the Nyasaland government to increase its revenues. By offering smallholders prices that were lower than the world market prices, the colonial state indirectly taxed the smallholders, extracting a significant part of their profits. Market regulations were extended to food crops after the Second World War and, by the mid-1950s, marketing boards controlled the trade of most African smallholder produce.|$|E
