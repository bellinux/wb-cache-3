40|$|Although {{the current}} level of organic {{production}} in industrialised countries amounts to little more than 1 - 2 percent, it is recognised that one of the major issues shaping agricultural output over the next several decades will be the demand for organic produce (Dixon et al. 2001). In Australia, the issues of healthy food and environmental concern contribute to increasing demand and market volumes for organic produce. However, in Indonesia, using more economical inputs for organic production is a supply-side factor driving organic production. For individual growers and <b>processors,</b> <b>conversion</b> from conventional to organic agriculture is often a challenging step, entailing a thorough revision of established practices and heightened market insecurity. This paper examines the potential for a systems approach to the analysis of the conversion process, to yield insights for household and community decisions. A framework for applying farming systems research to investigate the benefits of organic production in both Australia and Indonesia is discussed. The framework incorporates scope for farmer participation, crucial to the understanding of farming systems; analysis of production; and relationships to resources, technologies, markets, services, policies and institutions in their local cultural context. A systems approach offers the potential to internalise the external effects that may be constraining decisions to convert to organic production, and for the design of decision-making tools to assist households and the community. Systems models can guide policy design and serve as a mechanism for predicting the impact of changes to the policy and market environments. The increasing emphasis of farming systems research on community and environment in recent years is in keeping with the proposed application to organic production, processing and marketing issues. The approach will also facilitate the analysis of critical aspects of the Australian production, marketing and policy environment, and the investigation of these same features in an Indonesian context...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Detection {{of complex}} objects in {{streaming}} video poses two fundamental challenges: training from sparse data with proper generalization across {{variations in the}} object class and the environment; and the computational power required of the trained classifier running real-time. The Kerneltron supports the generalization performance of a support vector machine (SVM) and offers the bandwidth and efficiency of a massively parallel architecture. The mixed-signal very large-scale integration (VLSI) processor {{is dedicated to the}} most intensive of SVM operations: evaluating a kernel over large numbers of vectors in high dimensions. At the core of the Kerneltron is an internally analog, fine-grain computational array performing externally digital inner-products between an incoming vector and each of the stored support vectors. The three-transistor unit cell in the array combines single-bit dynamic storage, binary multiplication, and zero-latency analog accumulation. Precise digital outputs are obtained through oversampled quantization of the analog array outputs combined with bit-serial unary encoding of the digital inputs.

40|$|With the {{continuing}} emergence of high-bandwidth and on-demand applications, next-generation optical network will require {{significant improvements in}} terms of capacity, reconfigurability, and energy efficiency. These challenges call for developing optical networks capable of flexibly handling a higher capacity while consuming even less power than present. In searching for solutions of providing very high capacity and reconfigurability and energy efficiency, optical signal processing appear {{to be one of}} the enabling technologies due to its possibility for high-bandwidth applications and better scalability than electronics. This thesis concentrates on realizing multiwavelength signal processing architectures, providing key functionalities in wavelength division multiplexed (WDM) and optical time division multiplexed (OTDM) systems and networks. To implement desired optical functions for multiple channels, various optical nonlinearities in fibers and/or semiconductor optical amplifier (SOA) such as self-phase modulation (SPM), cross-phase modulation (XPM), cross-gain modulation (XGM), four wave mixing (FWM), and stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) are utilized selectively. Since the nonlinear e ects often occur at the same time, while a nonlinear e ect is in action, techniques to suppress the others are applied. Work of this thesis can be divided into three parts, addressing important issues for realization of reconfigurable WDM/OTDM networks. In the first part, a multiwavelength optical signal <b>processor</b> performing wavelength-waveform <b>conversions,</b> pulsewidth tunability, and signal regeneration is realized simultaneously through AND logic gate based on fiber-based parametric processing. The provided functions are desirable at WDM network nodes. It is necessary to implement optical switching of a group of wavelengths, at the same time, requires to mitigate the e ect of changes in transmission parameters of links before and after switching since the lightpaths are changed from time to time. Therefore, it is particularly desirable to integrate more functionalities into a single processing scheme, the socalled multi-channel multi-function optical signal processor (MCMF-OPS). It will be indicated that while switching multiple wavelengths to di erent wavelengths, the proposed MCMF-OPS presents large regenerations against timing jitter and signal distortions due to fiber dispersion and narrow filtering e ect for the incoming signals. Meanwhile, the pulsewidth tunability significantly improves the transmission performance for the outgoing signals via pulsewidth mani agement. The second part, on the other hand, focuses on inline multiwavelength processing with possibility of providing good channel quality even under the dynamic environment of optical paths while maintaining path wavelengths. The processing systems demonstrated in this part are based on a semiconductor optical amplifier (SOA) due to its distinctive properties compared to other photonic materials. Using SOA for multiwavelength systems faces some challenges due to the overwhelming influence of nonlinear crosstalks, especially as the number of channels increase. To overcome the problem, we introduce a technique of holding beam to suppress the e ect of interactions amongWDMchannels, leading to an enhanced input power dynamic range (IPDR) for SOA-based multiwavelength systems including optical amplification and optical signal processing based on XGM, and XPM. A more important aspect of optical signal processing is parallel multiwavelength processing which is capable of providing controllability into individual WDM channels. Parallel multiwavelength processing opens way for inline path processing at network nodes through which there may exist di erent lightpaths with di erent modulation format originating from and departing to di erent nodes without the need of wavelength conversion. To realize such a signal processor, we propose a multiple switching-window optical gate (MWOG), which is a compatible version of the conventional Sagnac interferometric switch. MW-OG o ers independent tunability of switching windows in wide range from 20 % to 80 % duty ratio at di erent wavelengths. The use of MW-OG for inline signal processing in a mixed NRZ and RZ data format transmission network shows significant improvement in transmission performance of optical paths due to regeneration and inline pulsewidth management by the proposed MW-OG. Finally, the third part is devoted to realization of a photonic gateway between a WDM network and an ultrafast OTDM LAN. It is still a technical challenge, yet immense importance, to construct an OTDM LAN o ering ultrahigh speed connections among users without any opticalelectronic-optical (O/E/O) devices that coexisted with conventional LANs. A emphasis is placed on providing a flexible transmultiplexing between OTDM and WDM networks. We will see that key to the success of such a gateway are a reconfigurable multiwavelength pulse compressor performing as a central synchronization controlling system responsible for the operation of the whole gateway. Nonlinear pulse compression techniques based on Raman amplifier or/and SPM are used to compress multiwavelenth clock and data pulses down to picosecond and subpicosecond ranges, o ering a compression factor up to 40 fold. Then, the compressed pulse source plays an active role for demonstrations of OTDM-to-WDM and WDM-to-OTDM conversions using multiwavelength sampling in fiber. The proposed converters provide an increased degree of flexible for channel arrangement into WDM/OTDM grids which in other others, represent for functions of routing and wavelength assignment in optical networks. 電気通信大学 201...|$|R
