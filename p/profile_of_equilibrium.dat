50|$|Fluorescence {{spectroscopy}} {{can be used}} {{to characterize}} the equilibrium unfolding of proteins by measuring the variation in the intensity of fluorescence emission or in the wavelength of maximal emission as functions of a denaturant value. The denaturant can be a chemical molecule (urea, guanidinium hydrochloride), temperature, pH, pressure, etc. The equilibrium between the different but discrete protein states, i.e. native state, intermediate states, unfolded state, depends on the denaturant value; therefore, the global fluorescence signal of their equilibrium mixture also depends on this value. One thus obtains a profile relating the global protein signal to the denaturant value. The <b>profile</b> <b>of</b> <b>equilibrium</b> unfolding may enable one to detect and identify intermediates of unfolding. General equations have been developed by Hugues Bedouelle to obtain the thermodynamic parameters that characterize the unfolding equilibria for homomeric or heteromeric proteins, up to trimers and potentially tetramers, from such profiles. Fluorescence spectroscopy can be combined with fast-mixing devices such as stopped flow, to measure protein folding kinetics, generate a chevron plot and derive a Phi value analysis.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: A thin marine {{limestone}} and {{calcareous mudstone}} unit (Portland Point Member) in the Hamilton Group grades laterally into sandstones off the Cooksburg Member when traced eastwards toward a palaeoshoreline. Sedimentological nalysis of the Cooksburg Member shows it {{to consist of}} a complex of shallow marine deposits together with sediments of tidal flat and beach environments. These sediments formed during a brief transgressive period during regional Devonian regression. This transgression comprised two phases of sea level rise, an initial slow rise of about 7 m followed by a more rapid rise of about 11 m. Calcareous andstones with fossil debris, and bioclastic limestone and calcareous hale of the Portland Point Member were deposited offshore on a continental-shelf-like ar a. Towards the south, in relatively deeper water, calcareous fossiliferous iltstones were deposited. The whole area was subject to complex water movements of tidal and wave origin. This sedimentary assemblage can be causally related to a rise of seat level having two principal side effects. First, the rate of alluvial deposition on the floodplain lying to the east was increased, and second, the nearshore marine <b>profile</b> <b>of</b> <b>equilibrium</b> was disturbed. The result was rapid deposition of sands nearshore to form the Cooksburg Member, whereas the reduced supply of terrigenous detritus to the shelf allowed concentration of bioclastic debris to form the Portland Point Limestone...|$|E

Broward County profiles north and south of the Pompano Beach restoration project were found to be inconsistent with previous studies as well as southern Palm Beach County profiles. This results from the presence in Broward County of a natural shore-parallel coquina ridge formation within the nearshore zone.

The pseudo-phase-space density (PPSD) <b>profiles</b> <b>of</b> CDM halos also show remarkable regularity, and are well approximated by simple power laws, Q(r) =ρ /σ ^ 3 r^-χ.

Atmospheric circulation models are being developed to study these new regimes but model validations and intercomparisons are needed to establish their consistency and accuracy.

40|$|An {{upscaling}} {{approach was}} developed for simulating soil water flow in horizontal heterogeneous unsaturated zone at field scale under flood irrigation. Based on the assumption of stream tube model and the van Genuchten-Mualem soil hydraulic function with five parameters Ks, [alpha], n, [theta]r and [theta]s, the Richards equation {{was transformed into a}} dimensionless form by using the dimensionless forms of temporal and spatial variables, and pressure head. Although a strong dependency of parameters Ks and [alpha] on scale does not exist in the transformed Richards equation, the parameter n, which is slightly dependent on scale, still exists in the transformed equation, and the parameter [alpha] is introduced in the transformed initial and boundary conditions. Therefore, a power law averaging technique was also included in our upscaling approach. Compared with traditional numerical methods, the distribution of pressure head of each soil column, and the mean and variance of soil water dynamics in all the soil columns can be obtained by numerically solving the transformed Richards equation only one time and by returning to the dimensionless variable expressions, while the traditional Richards equation must be solved once for every soil column. The new approach was calibrated by two numerical experiments, and the soil water content as a function of time and depth was reasonably well simulated for the two experiments which involved different soil textures. Different combinations of [alpha] and n were applied for comparing the accuracy of numerical simulations: n had little effect on the simulated results whereas [alpha] had some significant effect on the simulated results. To further verify the numerical efficiency of the new approach, we adopted the effective [alpha] values corresponding to the exponent p of the power law averaging technique [Eq. (16) ] when p approaches 0, pÂ =Â Â±Â  1 and Â±Â  0. 5 to conduct more numerical experiments. It showed that with an initial pressure head <b>profile</b> <b>of</b> <b>equilibrium</b> for Example 1, and with an initial pressure head profile of constant for Example 2, the simulated results of the wetting front at the specific depths were in agreement with that of traditional numerical method, and the errors in simulated pressure heads were small.

40|$|In {{order to}} throw more {{light on the}} {{formation}} of submarine bars and offshore bars or barrier beaches and the minor shore forms beach cusps and ripple marks a series of experiments {{was made in the}} new laboratory for experimental geology of the Geological Institution of the University at Leiden. The experiments were carried out in a tank, measuring six by four meters and half a meter in depth in which waves could be produced artificially varying in height from two to about twelf centimeters. The effects of waves on sandy beaches running parallel to or approaching the beach at an angle of fifteen degrees were traced, the beach itself having a slope of two, four or six degrees. Finally especially to detect possible rules for the formation of beach cusps in relation to the slope of the beach and the height and period of the waves some experiments were carried out with valves and valvegrit, for the principal part derived from Macta subtruncata Dac., and with fine pumice-stone-gravel the so-called „bims” Lapilli (original from the vulcanic Laacher-See country in Germany) ranging in diameter from 0. 2 to 2 centimeters in which the beach also had a varying slope. Neither of those last two series of experiments gave the results hoped for with regard to the problem mentioned. Many {{of the results of the}} effect of waves during the experiments may be found in the numerous photographs and figures in chapter III. The development and the pushing backwards of the offshore bar by the waves are clearly visible in the figures 39, 40, and 41. In all cases the offshore bar was formed by a gradual lateral growing of a number of subaquatic accumulations of sand which were at the same time slowly pushed higher up the slope of the beach. The subaquatic bar and the channel at the back of it, the latter formed by the excavation through the breaking waves, both had a practically stationary position. An almost horizontal terrace was formed between the channel and the foot of the front slope of the offshore bar, the latter being then pushed backwards to its final position and this taking the slope of a beach ridge. When the waves were running parallel to the beach this terrace was covered with somewhat irregular symmetric oscillation-marks and in case of experiments with waves obligue to the beach with slightly asymmetric combined current- and oscillation-ripples. A number of profils through the beach were taken at the end of most experiments. A careful examination of these profiles gave the following results. 1 °. The height of the submarine bar increases until the depth above it measured from the mean water-level is equal to half the height of the waves measured from trough to crest (diagram 1, fig. 85). 2 °. Only in the experiments with the beach sloping four and six degrees the submarine bar grows beyond the original profile. 3 °. The maximal depth of the channel at the back of the submarine bar is approximately equal to the height of the waves (diagram 3, fig. 87). 4 °. The height of the offshore bar, driven back to its ultimate position, above the mean water-level is proportional to one third of the height of the waves (diagram 4, fig. 88). 5 °. The actual height of the offshore bar, i. e. the height above the original slope of the beach, proved to be almost independent of the height of the waves (diagram 5, fig. 89). It thus turned out that the offshore bar is pushed back more or less according to the height of the waves without any real increase in height and volume. The number of profiles was not great enough to determine the influence of the slope of the beach though it may be established that indications tend to show a relatively small effect. The transportation of sand from the offshore zone to the beach and in the reverse direction and the transport along the beach by oblique wave attack were discussed at much length. In order to separate the zones in which the waves eroded the sea bottom from those in which sedimentation took place two neutral lines were introduced. The first, seaward one already introduced by Cornaglia where the land- and seaward components of the ground waves are supposed to be exactly balanced, inside of which the motion of debris is landward and out-side of which it is seaward. The second, nearer to the beach, where the eroding force of the waves is changed into a constructive agency. The position of this last line giving at the same time the depth at which the waves will break. The diagram 7 in fig. 91 proves this depth below mean water-level to be equal to three quarters of the height of the waves. The neutral line of Cornaglia was located at a maximal depth of two and a half times the height of the waves, a figure very well in accordance with those given by Cornaglia, Heiser and von Boschitsch for the Mediterranean, the Baltic and the Black Sea. It is generally supposed that the material in the offshore zone, deposited on the abrasion platform, cannot be considered as definitely lost for the formation of shore forms though the transport of sand up the sea-bottom slope is still a quite uncontrolable factor in the development of shores. This supposition however is not directly based on the experimental research but for the greater part on a study of the literature and reports of facts, observed in nature. It needs further experiments with coloured sand to prove the exactness of this opinion which are impossible to be carried out in nature on account of the big amounts of sand required. As to the transportation of sand along the beach it was stated that while in nature the litoral drift is divided into beach drifting- and offshore drifting sand, the former due to the oblique advance of the waves, the latter due to wind-generated and tidal currents, in the experiments the beach drifting only is of prime importance. The principal part of the longshore transportation consequently took place in the zone landward from the surfline. The deflection of the outlets, intersecting the full, by the gradual growing of the windward ridge could be seen in the experiments (exp. XIV). The experiments proved that all waves in the very first place tend to form a <b>profile</b> <b>of</b> <b>equilibrium</b> on the one hand by throwing much material on the beach and pushing this back on the other hand by pulling it down to greater depth. Whilst this is happening the transversal transportation of sand predominates strongly the alongshore transportation, the latter getting more importance when the <b>profile</b> <b>of</b> <b>equilibrium</b> approaches its completion. Much attention was paid to the formation of the low and ball of a sandy shore. The conditions during the experiments resemble closely those of a shore line of emergency along which the formation of submarine- and offshore bars is typical. The coast, the sea-bottom offshore over a varying distance from the coastline and the neighbouring coasts must be considered the sources of the material required for their upbuilding. The results of the experiments and a study of the facts brought forth by other investigators lead the author to the conclusion that the submarine bars, parallel to the shore, are formed by the loss of transporting power of the waves at the surfline. The undertow being only a factor in the regulation of the position of this line and not a determinative factor in the formation of the bars. The socalled „Zuwachsriff” of Braun (lit. 3), a transitional form between the submarine bars and the offshore bar, must be formed by the uprush of the waves after the final breaking. The channel at the back of the submarine bar is in the experiments merely due to the excavating action of the surf but in reality tidal- and wind-generated currents will also have some influence on its formation. The changes in form and position of the three or four, sometimes even more parallel bars are believed to be greatest in the zones nearest to and farthest from the beach. The latter, exposed to the effect of all changes in the height of waves, protects the inner zones to a large extent against a stronger attack by an increasing height of the waves. The former being exposed to the relatively greatest changes in depth and receiving much material eroded from the higher beach and the coast. Any submarine bar, build up to its maximum height by one series of waves will suffer erosion from a higher series and probably be driven landwards more or less. The complex of bars in general is a stabile phenomenon with regard to the external form as to the material it is a dynamic and by no means a static equilibrium. The submarine bars being considered fore runners of the offshore bars only a few remarks need be made about the formation of the latter. I wholly accept de Beaumont’s theory according to which the longshore transportation of debris is a factor completely superfluous for the formation of the offshore bars. Even without the slightest litoral drift bars will be build up consisting of material eroded from sea-bottom farther offshore, the slope of the offshore itself and during periods of rough weather from the coast also. The formation of offshore bars as the „Flugelriffe” after von Cholnoky’s theory is strongly rejected. „Flügelriffe” could be called „delta wing-bars”, a name expressing the connection with delta’s to which the bars are attaced and of which they derive their material after the theory mentioned above. The fifth chapter deals with the formation of beach cusps. Observations in the laboratory and along the Dutch shore show that conditions for their formation only are favourable when regular waves advance and retreat strikingly parallel to the beach. It is thought that the backwash plays an important part in the formation of this minor shore form. Starting its course without any momentum it is more apt to be captured and divided into a number of small streams, running down the slope, by small irregularities and depressions in the surface of the beach. The uprush or swash, which swirls over the slope, will try to erase those irregularities as often could be observed in the experiments. Beach cusps are only formed when the eroding power of the backwash slightly exceeds the constructive power of the uprush. In this case an equilibrium will be attained after a small partial erosion of the slope of the beach concentrated in the bays intervening the beach cusps. Whenever the difference between the two agencies becomes greater the whole slope will be eroded. Along the Dutch shore the beach cusps are buid up out of sand, valves and valve grit of Mactra subtruncata Dac. and the little tubes of Pectinaria belgica Pall. and Terebella conchilega Pall. Those consisting of sand are only found in connection with beach ridges, the seaward slope of which is a subject to erosion in the manner described above. The formation of ripple marks during the experiments did not have the authors special interest. It may only be stated that oscillationripples as well as current-ripples were formed. During the experiments with waves parallel to the beach, all oscillation-ripples formed were parallel to the beach. In the experiments with waves running oblique to the beach, the oscillation-ripples in the deeper zones trended parallel to the waves, in the higher zones parallel to the beach while on the terrace at the back of the channel combined current- and oscillation-ripples were formed at a considerable angle with the beach. True current-ripples appeared in the outlets where they were parallel to the beach and with a general trend at right angles to the beach at the back of the offshore bar. The latter are quietly buried by the transgression of the offshore bar in a manner strictly comparable to the fosilization of ripple marks in delta deposits and by the wandering of banks. The author hopes to have found a new ripple-mark, the „backwash sand-wave” which being always parallel to the beach in a fossil state will give fairly good evidence of the position of the ancient beach. And if these sand-waves are found over some distance in a direction at right angles to their trend they clearly show changes in the water-level, which may be due to the pushing of water against a coast, but in sediments with a marine facies is the result of the tides. These ripples, formed by the back wash, show a slightly arched form measuring some fourty to fifty centimeters in length and not more then one or two centimeters in height. They may cover the whole width of the beach after a period of stormy weather and high tide but under normal circumstances, they are formed on the seaward slope of the ridges lying at the front of the beach near to the low-tide line...|$|E

40|$|The {{possible}} occurrence <b>of</b> <b>equilibrium</b> off-equatorial tori in {{the gravitational}} and electromagnetic fields of astrophysical compact objects has been recently proved based on non-ideal MHD theory. These stationary structures can represent plausible {{candidates for the}} modelling of coronal plasmas expected to arise in association with accretion discs. However, accretion disc coronae are formed by a highly diluted environment, and so the fluid description may be inappropriate. The question is posed of whether similar off-equatorial solutions can be determined also {{in the case of}} collisionless plasmas for which treatment based on kinetic theory, rather than fluid one, is demanded. In this paper the issue is addressed in the framework of the Vlasov-Maxwell description for non-relativistic multi-species axisymmetric plasmas subject to an external dominant spherical gravitational and dipolar magnetic field. Equilibrium configurations are investigated and explicit solutions for the species kinetic distribution function are constructed, which are expressed in terms of generalized Maxwellian functions characterized by isotropic temperature and non-uniform fluid fields. The conditions for the existence of off-equatorial tori are investigated. It is proved that these levitating systems are admitted under general conditions when both gravitational and magnetic fields contribute to shaping the spatial <b>profiles</b> <b>of</b> <b>equilibrium</b> plasma fluid fields. Then, specifically-kinetic effects carried by the equilibrium solution are explicitly provided and identified here with diamagnetic, energy-correction and electrostatic contributions.

Cylindric plasmas bounded in the radial direction and bounded or unbounded in the axial direction are also investigated in the presence <b>of</b> <b>equilibrium</b> density gradients in both the radial and axial directions. Exact analytical solutions are found in terms of the Kummer confluent hypergeometric functions, describing standing oscillatory patterns in the radial and axial directions, associated with the drift mode propagating in the poloidal direction.

Building on Thomson (2005 Games and Economic Behavior), a new simple mechanism is presented here with the following properties: a) the mechanism fully implements the desired divisions, i. e. for each preference <b>profile</b> the set <b>of</b> <b>equilibrium</b> outcomes coincides with the set of fair divisions; b) the set of equilibria is a global attractor for the best-reply dynamics. Thus, players myopically adapting their strategies settle down in an fair division. The result holds even if mixed strategies are used.

The population occupies a finite habitat of arbitrary dimensionality and shape (i. e., a bounded, open domain in Rd). The selection coefficients depend on position and may depend on the gene frequencies; the drift and diffusion coefficients may depend on position. Sufficient conditions are given for the global loss of an allele and for its protection from loss. A sufficient condition for the existence of at least one internal equilibrium is also offered, and the <b>profile</b> <b>of</b> any internal <b>equilibrium</b> in the zero-migration limit is obtained...|$|R
40|$|The error-field {{penetration}} {{process of}} the dynamic ergodic divertor (DED) on the TEXTOR tokamak has been investigated analytically {{in terms of a}} single fluid MHD model with a finite plasma resistivity and viscosity in a cylindrical geometry. The linear model produces a localization of the induced current at the resonance surface and predicts a vortex structure of the velocity field near the resonance layer. Moreover, effects of the Alfven resonance for the error-field penetration are identified by two peaks in the radial <b>profiles</b> <b>of</b> the perturbed toroidal current and the perturbed magnetic flux when the relative rotation velocity between the DED and the rotating tokamak plasma is set to large. Fine structures of the vorticity induced by the DED {{in the vicinity of the}} rational surface disappear by introducing a finite plasma perpendicular viscosity. In addition, it is shown that the two peaks of the perturbed toroidal current overlap by an anomalous plasma perpendicular viscosity. Likewise, a bifurcation of the penetration process from the suppressed to the excited state is obtained by a quasi-linear approach taking into account modifications <b>of</b> the radial <b>profiles</b> <b>of</b> the <b>equilibrium</b> current and the plasma rotation due to the DED. A comparison with real experimental results of the DED on the TEXTOR tokamak is shown...|$|R

40|$|Fast magnetoacoustic waves guided {{along the}} {{magnetic}} field by plasma non-uniformities, in particular coronal loops, fibrils and plumes, {{are known to be}} highly dispersive, which leads to the formation of quasi-periodic wave trains excited by a broadband impulsive driver, e. g. a solar flare. We investigated effects of cylindrical geometry on the fast sausage wave train formation. We performed magnetohydrodynamic numerical simulations of fast magnetoacoustic perturbations of a sausage symmetry, propagating from a localised impulsive source along a field-aligned plasma cylinder with a smooth radial <b>profile</b> <b>of</b> the fast speed. The wave trains are found to have pronounced period modulation, with the longer instant period seen {{in the beginning of the}} wave train. The wave trains have also a pronounced amplitude modulation. Wavelet spectra of the wave trains have characteristic tadpole features, with the broadband large-amplitude heads preceding low-amplitude quasi-monochromatic tails. The mean period of the wave train is about the transverse fast magnetoacoustic transit time across the cylinder. The mean parallel wavelength is about the diameter of the waveguiding plasma cylinder. Instant periods are longer than the sausage wave cutoff period. The wave train characteristics depend on the fast magnetoacoustic speed in both the internal and external media, and the smoothness <b>of</b> the transverse <b>profile</b> <b>of</b> the <b>equilibrium</b> quantities, and also the spatial size of the initial perturbation. If the initial perturbation is localised at the axis of the cylinder, the wave trains contain higher radial harmonics that have shorter periods. Comment: 9 pages, 3 figure...|$|R

Velocity and turbulence <b>profiles</b> <b>of</b> disturbed and <b>equilibrium</b> flows upstream and downstream of the obstacles are presented. It is concluded that the integrated momentum flow of a boundary layer behind an obstacle can be greater than the upstream momentum flow, if the exponent of the upstream velocity profile is sufficiently high and the boundary layer has been disturbed by upstream obstacles. The rise of the turbulence level behind the obstacle is also dependent on the profile exponent in a disturbed layer...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with two frequency-dependent SIS epidemic reaction-diffusion models in heterogeneous environment, with a cross-diffusion term modeling the effect that susceptible individuals tend {{to move away from}} higher concentration of infected individuals. It is first shown that the corresponding Neumann initial-boundary value problem in an n-dimensional bounded smooth domain possesses a unique global classical solution which is uniformly-in-time bounded regardless of the strength of the cross-diffusion and the spatial dimension n. It is further shown that, even in the presence of cross-diffusion, the models still admit the threshold-type dynamics in terms of the basic reproduction number R_ 0; that is, the unique disease free equilibrium is globally stable if R_ 0 1, the disease is uniformly persistent and there is an endemic equilibrium which is globally stable in some special cases. Our results on the asymptotic <b>profiles</b> <b>of</b> endemic <b>equilibrium</b> illustrate that restricting the motility of susceptible population may eliminate the infectious disease entirely for the first model with constant total population but fails for the second model with varying total population. In particular, this implies that such cross-diffusion does not contribute to the elimination of the infectious disease modelled by the second one. Comment: 28 pages, submitte...|$|R
40|$|Owing to {{the great}} local and {{temporal}} sC'ltter of ice salinity, the shape <b>of</b> its steady-state <b>profile</b> in ice <b>of</b> <b>equilibrium</b> thickness is only approximately known. Hence the purpose of theoriz-ing {{on the way in}} which it establishes itself is to suggest pertinent experiments rather than to explain physical causes. Four mechanisms of salt migration are discussed: 1) "Brine pocket diffusion", as explained by Whitman. It is too slow to be of significance here. 2) "Gravity drainage", as observed in the laboratory by Kingery and Goodnow. It is unlikely to occur in natural, thick floating ice. However, their basic concept may be applicable in a modified form as 3) "Flushing " or washing-out. A quantitative calculation which assumes the replacement of brine by meltwater from the surface to be a function of ice salinity and maximum temperature leads to a steady-state salinity profile similar to that suggested by observations. 4) "Brine expulsion " as a result of temperature changes and the separation of liquid and gaseous inclusions during the cooling cycle (Nakaya, Bennington) is also treated numerically and results, as does 3), in a steady-state salinity <b>profile</b> resemblant <b>of</b> observations.

This research aims to determine the dominant patterns of variation of Bangkalan’s shoreline change, expressed by Eigen-function in empirical orthogonal function (EOF) models. That was started with data collection such as oceanographic data (wave and tidal), bathymetry and topographic map and sediment data. All data was used for forecasting two-monthly shoreline. Coordinate of two-monthly shoreline was used as input of EOF model. The first Eigen mode is a <b>profile</b> <b>of</b> shoreline <b>equilibrium.</b> The second Eigen mode shows pivot point that separates the different behaviors, which indicates a positive balance of shoreline from the direction of the dominant force. The models execution based on 1986 ’s shoreline show the shoreline change significantly at some cells e. g. around Suramadu bridge (cell 1 - 40), Batuporon (cell 70 - 100), Jungdima (cell 142 - 170) and at Kamal port (cell 230 - 250). The model of shoreline change using EOF was validated with the One-line model and data of 1995 ’s map’s shoreline. The E. O.

40|$|The {{charge of}} cosmic grains could play an {{important}} role in many astrophysical phenomena. It probably has an influence on the coagulation of grains and more generally on grain-grain collisions, and on interaction between charged particles and grains which could lead to the formation of large grains or large molecules. The electrostatic charge of grains depends mainly on the nature of constitutive material of the grain and on the physical properties of its environment: it results from a delicate balance between the plasma particle collection and the photoelectron emission, both of them depending on each other. The charge of the grain is obtained in two steps: (1) using the numerical model the characteristics of the environment of the grain are computed; (2) the charge of a grain which is embedded in this environment is determined. The <b>profile</b> <b>of</b> the <b>equilibrium</b> charge <b>of</b> some typical grains through different types of interstellar clouds is obtained as a function of the depth of the cloud. It is shown that the grain charge can reach high values not only in hot diffuse clouds, but also in clouds with higher densities. The results are very sensitive to the mean UV interstellar radiation field. Three parameters appear to be essential but with different levels of sensitivity of the charge: the gas density, the temperature, and the total thickness of the cloud...|$|R
