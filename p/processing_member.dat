40|$|AbstractMyostatin, {{a potent}} {{negative}} regulator of myogenesis, is proteolytically processed by furin proteases into active mature myostatin before secretion from myoblasts. Here, {{we show that}} mature myostatin auto-regulates its processing during myogenesis. In a cell culture model of myogenesis, Northern blot analysis revealed no appreciable change in myostatin mRNA levels between proliferating myoblasts and differentiated myotubes. However, Western blot analysis confirmed a relative reduction in myostatin processing and secretion by differentiated myotubes as compared to proliferating myoblasts. Furthermore, in vivo results demonstrate {{a lower level of}} myostatin processing during fetal muscle development when compared to postnatal adult muscle. Consequently, high levels of circulatory mature myostatin were detected in postnatal serum, while fetal circulatory myostatin levels were undetectable. Since Furin proteases are important for proteolytically <b>processing</b> <b>members</b> of the TGF-β superfamily, we therefore investigated the ability of myostatin to control the transcription of furin and auto-regulate the extent of its processing. Transfection experiments indicate that mature myostatin indeed regulates furin protease promoter activity. Based on these results, we propose a mechanism whereby myostatin negatively regulates its proteolytic processing during fetal development, ultimately facilitating the differentiation of myoblasts by controlling both furin protease gene expression and subsequent active concentrations of mature myostatin peptide...|$|R

The {{primary mission}} is to characterize atmospheric background clutter by collecting images in the midwave infrared (MWIR) and the shortwave infrared (SWIR). This data will improve current predictive infrared radiance models and the current understanding of atmospheric background clutter {{as a function of}} solar geometry, spectral bandpass, season, geographic region, and orthography. This knowledge is critical to evaluating and improving space surveillance systems into the next century. MSTI- 3 is operated out of the MSTI Payload Operations Center (MPOC) in Alexandria, Virginia. The operations architecture incorporates mission planners, command generation <b>members,</b> image <b>processing</b> <b>members,</b> data managers, and spacecraft analysts all in one location. This proximity creates a flexible and efficient working environment invaluable in diagnosing and correcting on orbit anomalies and in providing quick turnaround of special event experiments.

40|$|Parvoviral {{terminal}} hairpins {{are essential}} for viral DNA amplification but are also implicated in multiple additional steps in the viral life cycle. The palindromes at the two ends of the minute virus of mice (MVM) genome are dissimilar and are processed by different resolutionmechanisms that selectively direct encapsidation of predominantly negative-sense progeny genomes and conserve a single Flip sequence orientation at the 3 = (left) end of such progeny. The sequence and predicted structure of these 3 = hairpins are highly conserved within the genus Parvovirus, exemplified by the 121 -nucleotide left-end sequence of MVM, which folds into a Y-shaped hairpin containing small internal palindromes that form the “ears ” of the Y. To explore the potential role(s) of this hairpin in the viral life cycle, we constructed infectious clones with the ear sequences either inverted, to give the antiparallel Flop orientation, or with multiple transversions, conserving their base composition but changing their sequence. These were compared with a “bubble ” mutant, designed to activate the normally silent origin in the inboard arm of the hairpin, thus potentially rendering symmetric the otherwise asymmetric junction resolutionmechanism that drives maintenance of Flip. This mutant exhibited a major defect in viral duplex and single-strand DNA replication, characterized by the accumulation of covalently closed turnaround forms of the left end, and was rapidly supplanted by revertants that restored asymmetry. In con-trast, both sequence and orientation changes in the hairpin ears were tolerated, suggesting that maintaining the Flip orientation of these structures is a consequence of, but not the reason for, asymmetric left-end <b>processing.</b> <b>Members</b> of the family Parvoviridae have a linear single-stranded DNA genome of about 5 kb terminating in smal...|$|R
40|$|Purpose - This paper {{seeks to}} explore the {{question}} of how to investigate the contribution of the operational network (comprising sales service, logistics, planning, production, etc.) to operational performance. In doing so, the paper aims to link concepts from organisational and social psychology to production planning and control. Design/methodology/approach - The paper introduces the concept "operational network", e. g. the network of people involved in customer and production order <b>processing.</b> <b>Members</b> of the operational network need some autonomy, but this autonomy may also lead to dysfunctional behaviour, due to conflicts of interest, ambiguities and individual preferences. The contribution of the operational network seems difficult to investigate. This is illustrated by an empirical study of the role of operational people in a semi-process industry. This study shows that concepts of organisational psychology are very applicable here. However, most results relate perceived behaviour to perceived performance; it appeared to be difficult to relate actual organisation characteristics to actual performance. This paper discusses the research approach that is necessary to be able to fill the gap between "perceived" and "actual". Findings - To fill the gap between "perceived" and "actual" behaviour, it is necessary to formalize the behaviour of the members of the operational network by adopting an adequate planning and control framework. In most situations such a planning and control framework is not available. Therefore, a study of the role of the operational network needs to be accompanied by a participative design of the planning and control framework. Originality/value - This paper conducts a convincing investigation into the contribution of the operational network to operational performance, a subject which hitherto has been only marginally addressed...|$|R

40|$|A {{morphological}} {{family in}} Chinese is {{the set of}} compound words embedding a common morpheme, and Self-organizing maps (SOM) of these Chinese morphological families can be built. Computation of the unified-distance matrices for the SOMs allows us to perform semantic clustering {{of the members of}} the morphological families. Such semantic clustering sheds light on the interplay between morphology and semantics in Chinese. We studied how the word lists used in a lexical decision task (LDT) (Chen, Galmar, & Su, 2009) are mapped onto the clusters of the SOMs. We showed that this mapping is helpful to predict whether repetitive <b>processing</b> of <b>members</b> of a morphological family would elicit a satiation in an LDT- habituation- of both morphological and semantic units of the shared morpheme.

Conclusions drawn from our computational experiments and calculations are in accordance with the behavioral experimental results in Chen et al. (2009).

40|$|The Tweety {{proteins}} are {{a family}} of recently identified putative Cl- channels predicted to be modified by N-glycosylation and, controversially, to contain five or six membrane-spanning domains, leading to the contentious proposal that members of this family do not share the same topology at the plasma membrane. In humans, three family members have been identified, designated TTYH 1 (Tweety homologue 1), TTYH 2 and TTYH 3. To gain greater insight into the arrangement of membrane-spanning domains and cellular processing of Tweety proteins, {{in the present study}} we have examined the sequence homology, hydrophobicity and N-glycan content of members of this family and performed N-glycosylation site-mutagenesis studies on TTYH 2 and TTYH 3. Based on these observations we propose a structure for Tweety family proteins which incorporates five membrane-spanning domains with a topology at the cell surface in which the N-terminus is located extracellularly and the C-terminus cytoplasmically. Our results also suggest that N-glycosylation is important, but not essential, in the <b>processing</b> of <b>members</b> of the Tweety family with results indicating that, although incomplete N-glycosylation mediates reduced expression and increased ubiquitination of TTYH 2, N-glycosylation is not the determining factor for TTYH 2 trafficking to the plasma membrane.

40|$|The R 7 {{subfamily}} of RGS proteins critically regulates neuronal G protein-signaling pathways {{that are}} essential for vision, nociception, motor coordination, and reward <b>processing.</b> A <b>member</b> of the R 7 RGS family, RGS 11, is a GTPase-accelerating protein specifically expressed in retinal ON-bipolar cells where it forms complexes with the atypical G protein β subunit, Gβ 5, and transmembrane protein R 9 AP. Association with R 9 AP {{has been shown to}} be critical for the proteolytic stability of the complex in the retina. In this study we report that R 9 AP can in addition stimulate the GTPase-accelerating protein activity of the RGS 11 ·Gβ 5 complex at Gαo. Single turnover GTPase assays reveal that R 9 AP co-localizes RGS 11 ·Gβ 5 and Gαo on the membrane and allosterically potentiates the GTPase-accelerating function of RGS 11 ·Gβ 5. Reconstitution of mGluR 6 -Gαo signaling in Xenopus oocytes indicates that RGS 11 ·Gβ 5 -mediated GTPase acceleration in this system requires co-expression of R 9 AP. The results provide new insight into the regulation of mGluR 6 -Gαo signaling by the RGS 11 ·Gβ 5 ·R 9 AP complex and establish R 9 AP as a general GTPase-accelerating protein activity regulator of R 7 RGS complexes...|$|R
