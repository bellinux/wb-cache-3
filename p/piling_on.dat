5|$|During a {{game against}} the Canucks on March 8, 2004, Canucks player Todd Bertuzzi punched Colorado's Steve Moore from behind, leaving Moore unconscious. It was said to be {{retaliation}} for a hit Moore had delivered to Canucks captain Markus Naslund the month before. Because of the punch and the consequent fall on the ice with Bertuzzi on top of him, and numerous other players from both teams <b>piling</b> <b>on</b> top, Moore sustained three fractured neck vertebrae, among other injuries, that ended his career. Bertuzzi was away from professional hockey for 17 months as a result of suspensions. In Denver, ever since the Moore hit, it has become tradition for the home fans to boo Todd Bertuzzi every time he gains possession of the puck, whenever his team faces the Avalanche at Pepsi Center.|$|E
5|$|Some {{scholars}} postulate that onion domes were borrowed by Russians from Muslim countries - {{probably from}} the Khanate of Kazan, whose conquest Ivan the Terrible commemorated by erecting St. Basil's Cathedral. Eight {{of the nine}} domes featured on St. Basil's Cathedral represent each attack on Kazan. The ninth dome was constructed 36 years after the siege of Kazan as a tomb for Basil. The ornate finishes of these domes are bright in color and bold in shape as they are adorned with pyramids and stripes, and many other patterns seen on other cathedrals than Basil's. Some believe that onion domes first appeared in Russian wooden architecture above tent-like churches. According to this theory, onion domes were strictly utilitarian, as they prevented snow from <b>piling</b> <b>on</b> the roof.|$|E

Two bridges over the Northern City railway line connecting the stadium to Drayton Park were also built; these were completed in August 2004. The stadium topped out in August 2005 and external glazing, power and water tank installation was completed by December 2005. The first seat in the new stadium was ceremonially installed on 13 March 2006 by Arsenal midfielder Abou Diaby. DD GrassMaster {{was selected as the}} pitch installer and Hewitt Sportsturf was contracted to design and construct the playing field. Floodlights were successfully tested {{for the first time on}} 25 June 2006, and a day later, the goalposts were erected.|$|E

25|$|A {{number of}} {{commentators}} have criticized GERB for <b>piling</b> <b>on</b> {{the pressure on}} the government by behaving in a fashion that was contrary to the underlying tenets of Parliamentarism due to on occasions refusing to register or participate in Parliamentary sessions and thus impeding the work of the National Assembly. GERB brought forward a no-confidence motion against the government on 25 September 2013, but it could not be debated in the National Parliament, as its party representatives excused themselves from the proceedings.|$|E
25|$|Miralles, {{like many}} other postmodern architects, has a {{preference}} for <b>piling</b> <b>on</b> the motifs and ideas: upturned boats, keel shapes, deep window reveals like a castle, crow-steps, prow shapes, diagonal gutters, 'bamboo bundles' and above all the dark granite gun-shape that repeats as an ornamental motif at a huge scale. Everywhere broken silhouettes compete for attention, just like the alleyways next door. That's fine, and contextual, but it's quite a meal. As {{a result of the}} complexity, the parliament is really a kind of small city, with much too much to digest in one short three-hour sitting. The Scottish parliament will take time to judge: maybe not 50 years but three or four visits, long enough to absorb all the richness and get used to those jumpy black granite guns, the most arbitrary of several questionable ornaments.|$|E

500|$|The {{series has}} {{received}} mixed critical reception; About.com's Nancy Basile gave the series {{four out of}} five stars, opining that the series is [...] "what Adult Swim should be ... experimental, but in a cheap, simple, not-trying-to-be-cool way." [...] She found the crude animation [...] "refreshing" [...] but joked that the series [...] "can kill" [...] viewers not used to the slow pace.

[...] Conversely, Matthew Cole of Slant Magazine finds West's [...] "knack for dramatic, melodically sophisticated tracks [...] channeled away from the Olympian scale" [...] of his previous album [...] "and toward the more commercial vein of Jay-Z's recent work," [...] which he attributes to West splitting production work with several other producers.

2500|$|At {{the end of}} the 2008 season, O'Brien {{was named}} Northamptonshire's player of the year and was rewarded for his {{consistent}} performances with a three-year contract with the club. A representative of Northamptonshire CCC said [...] "Niall, who has just returned from international duty, was in sensational form last season with the bat, scoring over 850 championship runs and <b>piling</b> <b>on</b> the runs in one-day competitions in a new pinch-hitter role".
