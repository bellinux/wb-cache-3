The analysis tool is a unique, semianalytical finite element formulation that admits precise representation of the tooth geometry and contact forces that are crucial in gear dynamics. Importantly, no a priori specification of static transmission error excitation or mesh frequency variation is required; the dynamic contact forces are evaluated internally at each time step. The calculated response shows classical resonances when a harmonic of mesh frequency coincides with a natural frequency. However, peculiar behavior occurs where resonances expected to be excited at a given speed are absent. This absence of particular modes is explained by analytical relationships that depend on the <b>planetary</b> <b>configuration</b> and mesh frequency harmonic.

In this work we study the conditions and the dynamics of such resonant trapping.

The family of circular periodic orbits exhibits a gap at the 2 : 1 resonance and an instability and bifurcation at the 3 : 1 resonance. These properties explain the high probability of 2 : 1 and 3 : 1 resonant capture at low eccentricities. Furthermore, we study the resonant capture of three-planet systems. We show that such a resonant capture is possible and can occur under particular conditions.

In the late stage of planetary formation, scattering or colliding among planetesimals and planetary embryos can frequently occur. Hence, in our model, we consider a <b>planetary</b> <b>configuration</b> of two giants together with few terrestrial planets. We find that both colliding or scattering events at very early stage of dynamical evolution can influence the configurations trapped into resonance. A planet-planet scattering of a moderate terrestrial planet, or multiple scattering of smaller planets in a crowded planetary system can change the resonant configuration. In addition, collision or merging can alter the masses and location of the giant planets, which also {{play an important role in}} shaping the resonant configuration during the dynamical evolution.

In 2008, {{it was one of}} two stars around which exoplanets were directly imaged for the first time. The presence of three Jupiter-mass planets around HR 8799 provoked much interest in modelling the dynamical stability of the system. Initial simulations indicated that the observed planetary architecture was unstable on timescales much shorter than the lifetime of the star (y 105 yr). Subsequent models suggested that the system could be stable if the planets were locked in a 1 : 2 : 4 mutual mean motion resonance (MMR). In this work, we have examined the influence of varying orbital eccentricity and the semi-major axis on the stability of the three-planet system, through dynamical simulations using the MERCURY n-body integrator. We find that, in agreement with previous work on this system, the 1 : 2 : 4 MMR is the most stable <b>planetary</b> <b>configuration,</b> and that the system stability is dominated by the interaction between the inner pair of planets.
