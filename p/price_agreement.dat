40|$|The {{purpose of}} this comment is to review the role and {{function}} of the advance <b>pricing</b> <b>agreement</b> process, to examine the merits of both sides 2 ̆ 7 arguments in the BNA suit, and to discuss the policy implications should BNA prevail. While advance <b>pricing</b> <b>agreements</b> are not the ultimate solution to transfer pricing disputes and tax jurisdiction issues, they are a dispute resolution tool worth maintaining, at least until Congress or Treasury provides greater guidance in this area. Sufficient legal basis exists for the courts to find against BNA and rule that advance <b>pricing</b> <b>agreements</b> are exempt from publication under IRC § 6103. However, if the courts do not, Congress should step in and make advance <b>pricing</b> <b>agreements</b> exempt for policy reasons...|$|R

50|$|The Net Book Agreement (NBA) was a British fixed book <b>price</b> <b>agreement</b> between {{publishers}} and booksellers which set the prices at which books {{were to be}} sold to the public.

5000|$|A fixed book <b>price</b> <b>agreement</b> (FBPA) {{is a form}} of {{resale price}} {{maintenance}} applied to books. It commonly takes the form of an agreement between publishers and booksellers which set the prices at which books were to be sold to the public. An example of an FBPA was the former Net Book Agreement in the United Kingdom.|$|E
50|$|However, market {{concentration}} and a demise of independent bookshops have also {{taken place in}} economies such as Germany and France where a fixed book <b>price</b> <b>agreement</b> is still in place.

Also, the volume of books sold in the UK has increased by about 30% between 1995 and 2006.|$|E

50|$|In Leegin Creative Leather Prods., Inc. v. PSKS, Inc., 127 S. Ct. 2705 (2007), the Supreme Court {{considered}} whether federal {{antitrust law}} established a per se ban on minimum resale <b>price</b> <b>agreements</b> and, instead, allow resale <b>price</b> maintenance <b>agreements</b> {{to be judged}} by the rule of reason, the usual standard applied to determine if there is a violation of section 1 of the Sherman Act.

5000|$|A career backbencher, Spriggs {{was rarely}} {{in the public}} eye, and [...] "often said it did not {{necessarily}} follow that those MPs who were rarely in the headlines were not representing their constituency properly." [...] He believed that [...] "behind the scenes" [...] activity often produced the best results. One example of this was the <b>price</b> <b>agreement</b> he secured with foreign glassmakers that saved [...] "countless" [...] jobs in his constituency. He supported proposals for a float glass plant at Pilkington's St Helens facility, which he claimed lost him votes in the October 1974 general election. Despite this claim, he only received one less vote {{than in the previous}} election.|$|E
5000|$|But the Supreme Court {{has held}} that [...] " [...] a <b>price</b> <b>agreement</b> {{pure and simple}} is always illegal," [...] and that [...] "is {{conclusive}} here." [...] So, to answer the first question, whether the agreements would have violated the Sherman Act [...] "had the dredger patents had no part in them," [...] the agreements fixed prices and that violates the Sherman Act. [...] " [...] In such case they cannot {{be taken out of}} the category of the unlawful by general reasoning as to their expediency or nonexpediency or the wisdom or want of wisdom of the statute which prohibited their being made.|$|E
50|$|Sometimes a <b>price</b> <b>agreement</b> will {{be reached}} between buyer and seller, {{but for some}} reason both agree to reduce that price at a later date. A strict reading of the Internal Revenue Code says that the amount reduced is COD income, it does not fall under one of the four exclusions, and is thus gross income. To remedy this situation, Congress passed 26 U.S.C. § 108(e)(5), also known as the {{purchase}} price adjustment. If a reduction in price occurs after the parties have already reached an agreement, the Code treats the new agreed-upon price {{as if it were the}} original price, which means there will not be COD income to the buyer.|$|E

5000|$|This {{situation}} had caused {{a very high}} unemployment and triggered a recession, which was turning into a depression. In order to address this urgent matter, the Junta created an economic and financial task force, preside by Alfonso López Pumarejo and Mariano Ospina Pérez.

5000|$|Hepburn took an {{aggressive}} position {{with respect to}} timber licenses in Northern Ontario that were being held by companies that would not (or could not) cut wood on them. In that regard, in 1936 the Forest Resources Regulation Act was passed that granted the government broad powers for mandating minimum production quotas, maximum limits in line with good forestry practice, reducing licensed acreages where they were in excess of requirements, and increasing stumpage fees on companies [...] "operating or carrying on business in a manner detrimental to the public interest."

40|$|Using archival and {{interview}} data, this paper uses institutional theory (INT) {{to analyze the}} role that accounting played {{in the operation of}} voluntary <b>price</b> <b>agreements</b> in the Dundee jute industry (DJI) during the sector's decline from 1945 to 1960. At its peak in the late 19 th century, the industry employed almost 50 % of the Dundee labour force and its output was critical to the UK's war effort. Hence, once decline set in, serious efforts were made to protect it from foreign competition. The DJI was highly fragmented, with some firms happy to comply and others in a state of defiance. The role of accounting helped to provide legitimacy and attract compliance, while the isomorphic forces (normative, coercive and mimicry) played key roles individually and together in binding together a set of voluntary <b>price</b> <b>agreements.</b> Key influencers in the DJI exerted agency to reinforce these efforts. These agreements proved more successful than other ‘shelter' strategy schemes in other UK sectors in decline, e. g., cotton, in buying time for firms to diversify...|$|R
