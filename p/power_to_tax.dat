5|$|An {{amendment}} to the Articles had been proposed by Thomas Burke, in February 1781, to give Congress the power to collect a 5% impost, or duty on all imports, but this required ratification by all states; securing its passage as law proved impossible after it was rejected by Rhode Island in November 1782. Madison joined Hamilton in persuading Congress to send a delegation to persuade Rhode Island to change its mind. Their report recommending the delegation argued the federal government needed not just some level of financial autonomy, but also {{the ability to make}} laws that superseded those of the individual states. Hamilton transmitted a letter arguing that Congress already had the <b>power</b> <b>to</b> <b>tax,</b> since it had the power to fix the sums due from the several states; but Virginia's rescission of its own ratification ended the Rhode Island negotiations.|$|E
5|$|Between 2006 and 2007, Texas spent $7,275 {{per pupil}} ranking it below the {{national}} average of $9,389. The pupil/teacher ratio was 14.9, {{below the national}} average of 15.3. Texas paid instructors $41,744, {{below the national average}} of $46,593. The Texas Education Agency (TEA) administers the state's public school systems. Texas has over 1,000 school districts- all districts except the Stafford Municipal School District are independent from municipal government and many cross city boundaries. School districts have the <b>power</b> <b>to</b> <b>tax</b> their residents and to assert eminent domain over privately owned property. Due to court-mandated equitable school financing for school districts, the state has a controversial tax redistribution system called the"Robin Hood plan". This plan transfers property tax revenue from wealthy school districts to poor ones. The TEA has no authority over private or home school activities.|$|E

In this paper we explain this phenomenon using a model of Yardstick Competition. Using data on federal corruption-related convictions in U.

5|$|While Hamilton was in Congress, discontented {{soldiers}} {{began to}} pose {{a danger to the}} young United States. Most of the army was then posted at Newburgh, New York. Those in the army were paying for much of their own supplies, and they had not been paid in eight months. Furthermore, the Continental officers had been promised, in May 1778, after Valley Forge, a pension of half their pay when they were discharged. By the early 1780s, due to the structure of the government under the Articles of Confederation, it had no <b>power</b> <b>to</b> <b>tax</b> to either raise revenue or pay its soldiers. In 1782 after several months without pay, a group of officers organized to send a delegation to lobby Congress, led by Capt. Alexander McDougall. The officers had three demands: the Army's pay, their own pensions, and commutation of those pensions into a lump-sum payment if Congress were unable to afford the half-salary pensions for life. Congress rejected the proposal.|$|E

50|$|Expressway {{planning}} is {{performed by the}} Ministry of Transportation of the People's Republic of China. Unlike the road networks in most nations, most Chinese expressways are not directly owned by the state, but rather are owned by for-profit corporations (which have varying amounts {{of public and private}} ownership) which borrow money from banks or securities markets based on revenue from projected tollways. One {{reason for this is that}} Chinese provinces, which are responsible for road building, have extremely limited <b>powers</b> <b>to</b> <b>tax</b> and even fewer <b>powers</b> <b>to</b> borrow.|$|R
50|$|Negative Commerce Clause {{jurisprudence}} {{had long}} forbidden state tariffs because they discriminated against interstate commerce by burdening out-of-state competitors {{to the benefit}} of in-state businesses. The Court explained that a state could not use its legitimate <b>powers</b> <b>to</b> <b>tax</b> and <b>to</b> subsidize state businesses to effect the illegitimate aim of imposing what was in effect a tariff. The Court held that a nondiscriminatory tax had been coupled with a legitimate subsidy to create an effect that nonetheless violated the Commerce Clause.|$|R

25|$|Hamilton had {{apparently}} grown impatient with Adams and wanted {{a new president}} who was more receptive to his goals. During Washington's presidency, Hamilton {{had been able to}} influence the federal response to the Whiskey Rebellion (which threatened the government's <b>power</b> <b>to</b> <b>tax</b> citizens). When Washington announced that he would not seek a third term, Adams was widely recognized by the Federalists as next-in-line.|$|E
25|$|Associate Justice Roberts again {{delivered}} {{the opinion of}} a divided court, agreeing with those challenging the tax. Regarding agriculture as an essentially local activity, the court invalidated the AAA {{as a violation of}} the powers reserved to the states under the Tenth Amendment. The court also used the occasion to settle a dispute over the General Welfare Clause stemming back to the administration of George Washington, holding Congress possessed a <b>power</b> <b>to</b> <b>tax</b> and spend for the general welfare.|$|E
50|$|The Committee also {{rejected}} a second argument, namely that the taxation {{powers of the}} province were restricted <b>to</b> general <b>powers</b> <b>to</b> <b>tax</b> throughout the province {{and could not be}} used <b>to</b> authorise <b>taxes</b> for a local municipal purpose. The Province's taxation powers under s. 92(2) of the Constitution Act, 1867 are not so limited. Alternatively, even if the tax did not fall within s. 92(2), it would clearly be a law of a local or private nature within the meaning of s. 92(16) of the Constitution Act, 1867, and therefore within provincial authority on that basis.|$|R

25|$|Texas {{has over}} 1,000 public school districtsall {{but one of}} the school districts in Texas are independent, {{separate}} from any form of municipal government. School districts may (and often do) cross city and county boundaries. Independent school districts have the <b>power</b> <b>to</b> <b>tax</b> their residents and to assert eminent domain over privately owned property. The Texas Education Agency (TEA) oversees these districts, providing supplemental funding, but its jurisdiction is limited mostly to intervening in poorly performing districts.|$|E
25|$|The Supreme Court in Brushaber v. Union Pacific Railroad, , {{indicated}} that the amendment did not expand the federal government's existing <b>power</b> <b>to</b> <b>tax</b> income (meaning profit or gain from any source) but rather removed the possibility of classifying an income tax as a direct tax {{on the basis of}} the source of the income. The Amendment removed the need for the income tax to be apportioned among the states on the basis of population. Income taxes are required, however, to abide by the law of geographical uniformity.|$|E
25|$|The Social Security Administration's {{authority}} to make benefit payments as granted by Congress extends only to its current revenues and existing Trust Fund balance, i.e., redemption of its holdings of Treasury securities. Therefore, Social Security's ability to make full payments once annual benefits exceed revenues depends {{in part on the}} federal government's ability to make good on the bonds that it has issued to the Social Security trust funds. As with any other federal obligation, the federal government's ability to repay Social Security is based on its <b>power</b> <b>to</b> <b>tax</b> and borrow and the commitment of Congress to meet its obligations.|$|E
50|$|According to his BIEN profile, Widerquist’s {{criticism}} of right-libertarianism began in 2009 when he published both an encyclopedia entry on libertarianism and an article criticizing libertarianism. The article {{argues that the}} central principles that are meant to determine the just distribution of property in a right-libertarian economy can justify government ownership of the <b>powers</b> <b>to</b> <b>tax,</b> regulate, and redistribute property {{just as well as}} they can justify private ownership of property. It argues that no historical or principled reasons exist to believe that private owners holdings of their powers are any better justified than government holdings of their powers.|$|R

By June 1940, the British Empire stood alone against Germany.

50|$|The Supreme Court {{has also}} found that, in {{addition}} <b>to</b> the <b>power</b> <b>to</b> use <b>taxes</b> <b>to</b> punish disfavored conduct, Congress {{can also use}} its <b>power</b> <b>to</b> spend to encourage favored conduct. In South Dakota v. Dole, the Court upheld a federal law which withheld highway funds from states that did not raise their legal drinking age to 21.|$|R
25|$|For decades, {{the school}} was {{supported}} by tuition payments. But gradually the State began to assume {{a share of the}} financial responsibility. In 1820, a law authorized townships to levy a tax to pay the tuition of poor students. By 1828, townships had the <b>power</b> <b>to</b> <b>tax</b> for general school purposes. The State itself began to contribute money in 1830, and in 1846 every township was required to raise as much money each year for schools as the State itself contributed. The last tuition assessment for residents occurred in 1861, and thereafter the Columbia School was entirely supported by public taxation.|$|E
25|$|The Land Ordinance of 1785 {{marks the}} {{beginning}} of the Public Land Survey System. The Confederation Congress was deeply in debt following the Declaration of Independence. With little <b>power</b> <b>to</b> <b>tax,</b> the federal government decided to use the sale of the Western Territories to pay off American Revolutionary War debt. The Public Land Survey System has been expanded and slightly modified by Letters of Instruction and Manuals of Instruction, issued by the General Land Office and the Bureau of Land Management and continues in use in most of the states west of Pennsylvania, south to Florida, Alabama, and Mississippi, west to the Pacific Ocean, and north into the Arctic in Alaska.|$|E
25|$|Leopold's successor, King Charles III (1711–40), began {{building}} a workable relationship with Hungary after the Treaty of Szatmár. Charles asked the Budapest Diet's {{approval for the}} Pragmatic Sanction, under which the Habsburg monarch was to rule Hungary not as Emperor, but as a King subject to the restraints of Hungary's constitution and laws. He hoped that the Pragmatic Sanction would keep the Habsburg Empire intact if his daughter, Maria Theresa, succeeded him. The Diet approved the Pragmatic Sanction in 1723, and Hungary thus agreed to become a hereditary monarchy under the Habsburgs {{for as long as}} their dynasty existed. In practice, however, Charles and his successors governed almost autocratically, controlling Hungary's foreign affairs, defense, and finance but lacking the <b>power</b> <b>to</b> <b>tax</b> the nobles without their approval.|$|E

25|$|The {{holding in}} Springer was {{modified}} {{in part by}} the Court in the 1895 case of Pollock v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co., where the Court ruled that a tax on income from property in the form of interest, dividends or rent should be treated as a tax on the property itself, and therefore as a direct tax required to be apportioned. The Sixteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution later overruled the Pollock decision and made clear that there was no requirement for apportionment of income taxes. Later still, in Bowers v. Kerbaugh-Empire Co., the Supreme Court reviewed Pollock, the Corporation Excise Tax Act of 1909 and the Sixteenth Amendment, and concluded that Congress had always had the unfettered <b>power</b> <b>to</b> <b>tax</b> income, as set forth in Springer.|$|E
25|$|The Articles of Confederation {{established}} the United States as {{an association of}} sovereign states with a weak central government. This arrangement was met with disapproval, and was mostly unsuccessful after the war. Congress had no <b>power</b> <b>to</b> <b>tax,</b> {{and was unable to}} pay debts from the Revolution, which concerned Madison and other nationalists, such as Washington and Alexander Hamilton, who feared national bankruptcy and disunion. The historian Gordon S. Wood has noted that many leaders, including Madison and Washington, feared more that the revolution had not fixed the social problems that had triggered it and that the excesses ascribed to the King were being seen in the state legislatures. Shays' Rebellion is often cited as the event that forced the issue; Wood argues that many at the time saw it as only the most extreme example of democratic excess.|$|E
