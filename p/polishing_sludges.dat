These polishing by-products are essentially a mix of fine residues of the specific ceramic body and a coarse residue of the abrasive used for polishing {{the surface of the}} tiles. In the present work, it was studied the use of porcelain tile <b>polishing</b> <b>sludges,</b> as a raw material in manufacturing of aluminosilicate fireclay bricks to be used in fireplaces. In order to establish the feasibility of the process and to develop the addition conditions, a set of appropriate ceramic compositions of white and red fireclays was studied. Results showed that up to 10 % in weight of the basic raw materials could be preplaced by tile polishing dry sludges, without significant changes in the ceramic process and the resulting materials properties...|$|E
40|$|In the Italian {{reality the}} unfired and fired {{by-products}} are totally recycled {{in the manufacturing}} cycle, and only those residues coming from depuration processes (glaze sludges and exhausted lime) cause technological problems, being less useful for recycling. Statistical data of the produced quantities, treated and recycled, divided by categories, are shown. Furthermore, we analyze a new category of ceramic residue, <b>polishing</b> <b>sludges,</b> that owing to their chemical characteristics, are not recycled in the ceramic bodies. We propose to reuse them as secondary raw materials to obtain porous materials with insulating properties by controlled thermal treatments...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} provides possible {{opportunities in}} the reuse of waste and particularly muds, coming from both ornamental stone (granite sludges from sawing and polishing operations) and ceramic production (porcelain stoneware tile polishing sludge), for the manufacture of lightweight aggregates. Lab simulation of the manufacturing cycle was performed by pelletizing and firing the waste mixes in a rotative furnace up to 1300 °C, and determining composition and physicomechanical properties of lightweight aggregates. The best formulation was used to produce and test lightweight structural concretes according to standard procedures. Both granite and porcelain stoneware <b>polishing</b> <b>sludges</b> exhibit a suitable firing behavior due to the occurrence of SiC (an abrasive component) which, by decomposing at high temperature with gas release, acts as a bloating promoter, resulting in aggregates with particle density 20 MPa, bulk density 1. 4 - 2. 0 Mg/m 3) ...|$|E

The different microstructure has been explained by considering the selective heating phenomenon generated by microwave irradiation: the SiC particles could heat much faster that the aluminosilicate matrix so that to melt the surroundings {{with a sort of}} encapsulation process. Conventional heating lead to SiC reaction with oxygen promoting its conversion in CO 2 thus creating large pores...|$|R
40|$|Nowadays, {{ceramic tile}} are {{manufactured}} at zero emissions permitting to recycle all by-products {{and part of}} residues derived from depuration treatments (exhausted lime, glazing <b>sludge</b> and <b>polishing</b> <b>sludge).</b> In addition to this environmentally friendly tendency, {{in the last years}} an increasing number of scientific studies demonstrated the feasibility to use alternative raw materials in substitution of different component of the ternary clay-feldspar-quartz system. In {{the first part of the}} paper is reported the state of the art of industrial waste recycling in the ceramic sector, with the focus on review studies related to both ceramic tiles and bricks [...] In the second part of the work are reported two case studies conducted by the authors with the aim to formulate ceramic bodies using alternative raw materials. New tailored compositions were obtained replacing clays, flux and/or inert compounds (higher than 60. wt%) by scraps from packaging waste glass in tiles, and cathode ray tube glasses and packaging waste glass up to 20. wt% in the brick compositions...|$|R
40|$|As lamas de beneficiamento de rochas ornamentais (LBRO) são resíduos que apresentam composição química variada em função da composição das rochas, do processo de beneficiamento, dos processos de reaproveitamento de águas e lamas, das propriedades dos insumos, entre outros fatores. A caracterização e classificação das LBRO são de grande importância, principalmente para o Estado do Espírito Santo, por possuir um expressivo número de empresas do setor. Neste trabalho, são apresentados os resultados de caracterização e classificação de lamas de desdobramento e polimento de mármores e granitos, segundo a NBR 10004 / 2004. Todas as amostras de lamas de tear convencional e de politriz analisadas foram classificadas como Classe IIA. Percebeu-se que a identificação dos resíduos por fonte geradora permite a proposição de tecnologias limpas, como o uso de teares a fio diamantado que utilizam o mínimo de insumos e de pastilhas diamantadas metálicas isentas de elementos tóxicos, contribuindo para a melhoria das características químicas das LBRO. The sludges {{produced}} in the cutting and polishing of ornamental stones are residues with diverse chemical composition that depend on {{the composition of the}} stones, the cutting and polishing process, the processes involved in the recycling of water and sludges, among others. The characterization and classification of these resulting sludges have great importance, especially for the State of Espírito Santo, Brazil, which is an important producer of ornamental stones. In this work, the results of characterization and classification of developmental and <b>polishing</b> <b>sludges</b> were presented, according to the Brazilian standard NBR 10004 / 2004. All the sludge samples from the cutting and polishing equipment were classified as Class IIA. We observed that the identification of the residues according to the generation source allows the proposition of clean technologies usage, such as cutting equipment with diamond coated wires, that use a minimum of raw materials, and metal diamond coated pads, free of toxic material, thus contributing to improve the chemical characteristics of these sludges...|$|E
40|$|An {{important}} {{application of}} Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) in the waste sector is {{the comparison of}} different scenarios of products end-of-life.

40|$|Industrial {{activities}} produce certain {{amounts of}} substances {{that are not}} consistent with the purposes of production processes. For many years waste materials have been disposed as soil or landfilled. Currently by global awareness of the negative impact of waste materials in environment, there is continuing interest in establishing suitable processes in efficiently waste recycle and reuse. By glance to the current effort, artists and designer are also trying to contribute by introducing artwork or design work base on reusing and recycling concept. Ceramic production is one of the distinguished artistic fields that can be a potential target for waste material reuse base on its complex matrix. Thus the objectives of the study are to suggest the modified stoneware body as an Eco-Green material for ceramic artworks production and to determine the effect of sludge concentration in the ceramic stoneware body in term of its strength, water absorption ability and shrinkage. This study employs two types of wastes which are palm oil and canon lens <b>polishing</b> <b>sludge</b> to be inserted in the stoneware ceramic body. In first step both waste materials have been treated and calsined at 400 °C, to remove moisture and other substance. Raw materials have been mixed in different ratios from oto 20 wt. ...|$|R
40|$|There is {{a growing}} concern on {{lightweight}} aggregates (LWA) for recycling of waste materials: this manufacturing technology is considered a flexible tool to make it possible the conversion of large amounts of residues into building products. The main challenge for this purpose is the control on the technological behavior during firing of waste-bearing batches. The target is engineering the sintering and expansion of LWA in order to tailor bulk density, mechanical strength and water absorption on various possible applications (e. g., structural and non-structural lightweight concretes, lightweight mortars, filtration substrates, floriculture). The prediction of the aggregate expansion – and hence the batch design – is usually carried out utilizing the Riley’s and/or Cougny’s schemes, which are based on the bulk chemical composition of clay bodies. However, collecting the literature data on waste-based LWA and plotting them in the Riley’s and Cougny’s diagrams, no reliable discrimination turns out between expanding and non-expanding batches. In the same way, the attempt to modify the Riley’s and Cougny’s parameters, including elements present in wastes but not in natural raw materials, was unsuccessful. From this standpoint, a new approach to assess the batch expandability was developed through a deeper comprehension of mechanisms acting on sintering and expansion of LWA. A specific characterization protocol was set up, entailing hot-stage microscopy and determination of phase composition and microstructure. This implies a paradigm shift from batch (chemical composition) to vitreous phase (amount, chemical composition, and viscosity at high temperature). The vitreous phase plays a key-role for bloating, microstructure and physical properties of LWA. A working example is presented about new LWA based on waste glasses, ceramic tile <b>polishing</b> <b>sludge</b> and clay raw materials...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{changes to}} the sewage sludge {{management}} {{can be attributed to}} the restrictive deadlines of implementing EU regulations concerning wastewater treatment and sewage sludge utilization. Drying and thermal treatment of sewage sludge is becoming increasingly popular. From nearly zero share of thermal treatment methods in the sewage sludge management currently the share exceeds 35 %. Implementation of numerous investments is facilitated by respective structure programs in the scope of environmental protection supported with EU funds. The analysis of chosen aspects of new operational experience constitutes the main part of the present paper. Analysed were domestic opera-tional practices concerning the applied technologies of sewage sludge drying, their effectiveness and reliability. The aspect of effectiveness of flue gas cleaning with the use of sodium bicarbonate, method characteristic for many <b>Polish</b> sewage <b>sludge</b> incineration facilities, is discussed in detail. The analysis is based on the current operational data and own research. 1...|$|R
40|$|Sewage sludge {{originated}} from {{wastewater treatment plants}} (WWTP) serving rural areas are suggested for agricultural or natural usage. Before, however, sewage sludge is subjected to the several pre-treatments, which involve stabilization, hygienisation and pre-composting. These methods decrease mainly the amount of organic substances and presence of microorganisms, but hardly affects concentrations of heavy metals. The advantages of using sludges as fertilizer for improving and sustaining soil fertility and crop production are many. The addition of sewage sludge to soils could affect potential availability of heavy metals. Trace elements are distributed in the soil in various forms: solid phases, free ions in soil solution, soluble organic-mineral complexes, or adsorbed on colloidal particles. In the study the concentrations of trace elements (Pb, Cd, Cr, Hg, Ni, Zn, Al, As, Se, B, Ba, Br, Ca, Cu, Fe, Mn, Na, Ga, Li, Mo, Sr, Mg, K, Ru, Tl, V, U) was tested in sewage sludge obtained from (WWTP) serving rural areas (PE< 9 000). In each case, the tested sewage sludge was meeting the criteria of stabilization and was used for agriculture and land reclamation purpose. All the samples were collected in 2016 and were subjected to microwave mineralization in a closed system in aqua regia. The total amound of macro and microelements were determined with a ICP-OES. It {{was found that the}} total concentrations of trace metals in all of sewage sludge are the same than Polish regulation limit of pollutants for sludge to be used in agriculture. The trace elements (cadmium: 1, 16 mg·kg- 1 /d. m. in <b>polish</b> sewage <b>sludge,</b> respectively, much higher than those in the other countries. As a most prevalent copper and zinc were observed (111, 28 mg·kg- 1 /d. m. and 282, 94 mg·kg- 1 /d. m.). The concentrations of copper in <b>polish</b> sewage <b>sludge</b> are much lower (49 - 130 mg·kg- 1 /d. m.) than european sewage sludge (522 - 562 mg·kg- 1 /d. m.). The two out of tested heavy metals (beryllium, bismuth) were under detection limit, while gallium, molybdenum, thallium, vanadium and silver were detected in concentrations lower than 0, 005 mg·kg- 1 /d. m. According to the obtained results, in all tested samples (the total amount of trace elements) did not exceed the limit values in sewage sludge for their use in agriculture and land reclamation...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} project consisted of studying {{the feasibility of}} a combined UASB-activated sludge process configuration for treating a dilute synthetic substrate, simulating a dairy wastewater, at a laboratory temperature averaging 23. 5 +/- 0. 8 °C. The bench-scale experimental work was carried-out in two parallel biotreatment systems fed in series. They consisted of relatively small-scale Upflow Anaerobic Sludge Blanket (UASB) reactors of 3. 85 and 3. 75 L, respectively, followed by 2 L-activated <b>sludge</b> <b>polishing</b> processes. The feed concentration applied {{to one of the}} systems consisted of the minimum influent strength recommended for successful anaerobic treatment (∼ 1 000 mg CODt/L) while the second system was of the domestic sewage-strength range (∼ 500 mg CODt/L), achieved by dilution. The mainly soluble complex feedstock used consisted of tap water and Iron Fortified Enfalac(TM) Infant Formula. It was supplemented chemically to ensure that proper (N and P) nutrient requirements were met as well as to increase its buffering capacity and to adjust pH. Three experimental runs were carried out by applying increasing UASB influent flow rates of 2, 4 and 8 L/d, in both systems. (Abstract shortened by UMI. ...|$|R
40|$|During {{the past}} decade, estrogenic {{contaminants}} and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) received {{more and more}} attention due to their adverse effects as endocrine disruptors. There {{is a need to}} examine fate of these contaminants during wastewater treatment and effluent polishing process, as well as during the land application of biosolids as soil amendments, within the context of potable water reuse and sludge application, which have all been widely practiced. Two major research goals guided this research. The first goal was to develop experimental protocols measuring estrogenic activity (including nonylphenol) and PBDEs in environmental samples, especially in organic rich solid samples such as sludges, sediments and soils which are impacted by wastewater and/or application of biosolids. The second objective was to evaluate fate of estrogenic activity and PBDEs during conventional wastewater treatment, effluent <b>polishing,</b> and <b>sludge</b> handling processes including digestion, dewatering, composting, and land application of biosolids by using the protocols developed. The protocol developed to measure estrogenic activity or PBDEs in the solids includes extraction, cleanup, and determination steps. Each step is critical for the successful determination; however cleanup step was the most difficult. In this study, a C 18 resin was used as the media to remove the bulk organic interferences in the measurement of estrogenic activity and nonylphenol. In comparison, Florisil was used in the cleanup step for PBDE analysis. In the development of each protocol, mobile phase was carefully selected and optimum cleanup strategy was determined, recovery of analytes during cleanup operation was measured. During the development of method measuring the estrogenic activity, effects of extraction variables such as solvent, pressure, and time were investigated. The performance of each protocol was examined by spike and recovery experiments. Experiments indicated that estrogenic activity and nonylphenol were largely removed during traditional wastewater treatment, soil aquifer treatment, and surface transport along a wastewater dependent stream. Examination of estrogenic activity and nonylphenol in sludge, sediments in contact with wastewater and mass balance analysis of these estrogenic contaminants in traditional wastewater treatment plants and infiltration basins indicated that both adsorption and biodegradation play important roles. In comparison, estrogenic activity and nonylphenol were persistent during anaerobic sludge digestion. More experiments are warranted to understand fate of PBDEs during sludge digestion process, although limited data show possible degradation...|$|R
