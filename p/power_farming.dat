40|$|The {{guide to}} the “Cornhusker State” is full of many {{interesting}} photographs {{of the people and}} places of Nebraska. They portray a largely agrarian state of hard-working farmers. There is an interesting essay on the unicameral legislature of Nebraska. The guide sticks pretty close to the series format. Eight cities are given detailed descriptions. There are 13 detailed tours of the state. SOME of us in Nebraska {{know what it is to}} have made the first wagon track across an unbroken sea of grass into a new land, with no guide but the sun, the distant hilltops, and our own resolution. I remember more than one such road. We had to find our way, discover our own fords, devise our own gully crossings, and leave a trail which others could follow and improve. This book is another road starter. It is the first attempt to put into one compact handy volume the story of Nebraska 2 ̆ 7 s land and its people and a guide to every part of the State. It is the first Nebraska Baedeker. Its preparation has called into the Federal service more than one hundred writers, researchers, draftsmen, and photographers, for a period exceeding two years. In the course of their work they have handled thousands of books, newspapers, and manuscripts, and have traveled Nebraska from the black prairie soil along the Missouri to the pine tree ridges beyond the sandhills. The Superintendent and staff of the Nebraska State Historical Society have had the privilege of assisting in an advisory and critical capacity. Contents FOREWORD, By Addison E.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{increase}} the level of knowledge in the field of Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) for wind power. The study includes six wind <b>power</b> <b>farms</b> in the County of Västerbotten in northern Sweden. The main questions were: What are the real dimensions of roadways and land claims for both roads and wind power turbines? How do those dimensions correlate with the dimensions stated in the EIA? Are there any differences in values of the dimensions between the wind <b>power</b> <b>farms</b> that are included in this study? The width of the roadways and the land claims for both roads and wind turbines in wind <b>power</b> <b>farms</b> were examined on site. The results from the examinations were compared with the dimensions available in the EIA for each wind <b>power</b> <b>farm.</b> When comparison was possible the outcome was that the measurements for roadways matched with the dimensions but measurements for land claims for roads and wind turbines exceeded the dimensions. The values of the measured dimensions vary within and in certain cases between the wind <b>power</b> <b>farms.</b> From the findings of this study it can be concluded that it is difficult to in advance estimate how much land roads and wind turbines in wind farms will claim. In addition the study shows that it is of great importance to specify the dimensions of roadways and land claims for roads and wind turbines in the EIA for wind <b>power</b> <b>farms...</b>|$|R

40|$|Significant {{progress}} has been made in the development of wave energy converters (WECs) during recent years, with prototypes and farms of WECs being installed in different parts of the world. With increasing sizes of individual WECs and farms, it becomes necessary to consider the impacts of connecting these to the electricity network and to investigate means by which these impacts may be mitigated. The time-varying and the unpredictable nature of the power generated from wave <b>power</b> <b>farms</b> supplemented by the weak networks to which most of these farms will be connected to, makes the question of integrating a large quantity of wave power to the network more challenging. The work reported here focuses on the fluctuations in the rms-voltage introduced by the connection of wave <b>power</b> <b>farms.</b> Two means to reduce these rms-voltage fluctuations are proposed. In the first method, the physical placement of the WECs within a farm is selected prior to the development of the farm to reduce the fluctuations in the net real power generated. It is shown that spacing the WECs or the line of WECs within a farm at a distance greater than half the peak wavelength and orienting the farm at 90 ◦ to the dominant wave direction produces a much smoother power output. The appropriateness of the following conclusions has been tested and proven for a wave <b>power</b> <b>farm</b> developed off the Outer Hebrides, using real wave field and network data. The second method uses intelligent reactive power control algorithms, which have already been tested with wind and hydro power systems, to reduce voltage fluctuations. The application of these intelligent control methods to a 6 MW wave <b>power</b> <b>farm</b> connected to a realistic UK distribution network verified that these approaches improve the voltage profile of the distribution network and help the connection of larger farms to the network, without any need for network management or upgrades. Using these control methods ensured the connection of the wave <b>power</b> <b>farm</b> to the network for longer than when the conventional control methods are used, which is economically beneficial for the wave <b>power</b> <b>farm</b> developer. The use of such intelligent voltage - reactive power (volt/VAr) control methods with the wave <b>power</b> <b>farm</b> significantly affects the operation of other onshore voltage control devices found prior to the connection of the farm. Thus, it is essential that the control of the farm and the onshore control devices are coordinated. A voltage estimation method, which uses a one-step-ahead demand predictor, is used to sense the voltage downstream of the substation at the bus where the farm is connected. The estimator uses only measurements made at the substation and historical demand data. The estimation method is applied to identify the operating mode of a wave <b>power</b> <b>farm</b> connected to a generic 11 kV distribution network in the UK from the upstream substation. The developed method introduced an additional level of control and can be used at rural substations to optimise the operation of the network, without any new addition of measuring devices or communication means...|$|R

Also the use of renewable energy sources, like solar, hydro and wind power, have to increase. Wind power has great potential as a future energy supply. It is cost efficient, quickly developed and the resource is abundant and available worldwide. Examinations made in Sweden, indicates that there are difficulties establishing wind power at the same pace as the environmental goals, set by the Swedish government, requires. Mainly because people living nearby potential areas for wind <b>power</b> <b>farms,</b> appeal against the decision. This study aims to investigate differences between how people in Sweden and Brazil look at wind power as a future energy source and at the establishing process. It is divided in two parts, a Swedish literature study and a Brazilian study based on interviews with both local and governmental authorities and with people living nearby the wind <b>power</b> <b>farm</b> Osório. The Swedish study shows that the majority of people living nearby wind <b>power</b> <b>farms</b> are positive to wind power as a future energy source. The challenges lies in the establishing process because of fear of the consequences to the surrounding areas. The main concerns are:  Changes in landscape  Noise  Visual effects Results from the Brazilian study indicate that 96 percent of the people living close to Osório were positive to wind power as a future energy source. 52 percent thought that the possibilities {{to be involved in the}} establishing process had been insufficient and that they were given to little opportunity to express their opinion.
