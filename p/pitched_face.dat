6000|$|They {{burst into}} loud {{laughter}} at Dutchy's nonsense. The sound had scarcely died {{away when the}} door opened and Dennin came in. All turned to look at him. He was carrying a shot-gun. Even as they looked, he lifted it to his shoulder and fired twice. At the first shot Dutchy sank upon the table, overturning his mug of coffee, his yellow mop of hair dabbling in his plate of mush. His forehead, which pressed upon the near edge of the plate, tilted the plate up against his hair at an angle of forty-five degrees. Harkey was in the air, in his spring to his feet, at the second shot, and he <b>pitched</b> <b>face</b> down upon the floor, his [...] "My God!" [...] gurgling and dying in his throat.|$|E

The German architect Paul Bonatz (1877-1956) also acted as an adviser during his brief stay in Turkey.

Shane Victorino then hit a single up the middle, scoring Francisco; however, Ruiz was thrown out at home plate by Giants center fielder Aaron Rowand. Chase Utley singled to right and Santiago Casilla {{was brought in to}} face Plácido Polanco. Polanco doubled in both runners, giving the Phillies a 3-2 lead.

Casilla finally ended the inning by striking out Rollins.|$|R

40|$|Mediterranean {{countries}} offer {{very favorable}} climatic conditions for growing plants in a protected environment: {{as a matter}} of fact, the high solar radiation allows the use of greenhouses with simple structures, covered with plastic film and without fixed installations for winter heating. They are called “Mediterranean greenhouses” and are totally different from those in Central and Northern Europe. In the photovoltaic greenhouses, the cover on the <b>pitch</b> <b>facing</b> south is usually replaced by very opaque panels. However, this solution compromises the possibility to grow plants in covered and protected environments since solar radiation availability is limited and strongly nonuniform. In order to overcome this problem, semitransparent photovoltaic materials can be used to let the solar energy, necessary for plant growth, pass into the green house. The aim of this research is to analyze the radiometric properties of innovative semitransparent flexible photovoltaic materials in order to evaluate their performances in comparison with materials commonly used in the coverage of the greenhouses. Particular attention is paid to the transmittance of these materials in the visible range and in the long wave infrared for the achievement of greenhouse effect...|$|R

5000|$|Another {{advantage}} of the helical twist is that the blades generate torque well from upward-slanting airflow. This is negligible in open country, but tall buildings and cliff faces generate a bow wave which directs airflow up and over them. Turbines mounted on high building rooftops or clifftops are exposed to significantly slanting flow, and the Turby can extract more useful energy from it than a propeller-type turbine can [...] because horizontal axis (HAWT) types cannot change their <b>pitch</b> to <b>face</b> the wind directly.|$|R
