5|$|Original {{estimates}} {{predicted a}} daily ridership of 180,000 after launch, growing to 400,000 by 2036. In {{view of a}} 50% drop in airline <b>passengers</b> {{in the wake of}} the 1997 Asian financial crisis, forecasts were revised downwards. The final initial ridership estimate was 140,000 <b>passengers</b> per day. Actual initial ridership did not match these projections. In September 2007, six months after opening, THSRC carried 1.5million <b>passengers</b> monthly, translating to about 50,000 <b>passengers</b> daily.

40|$|AbstractBased on {{simulations}} of the transports of a typically formed Chinese intercity <b>passenger</b> train hauled respectively by major types of the locomotives {{on a certain}} railway line in China, this research analyzes the changes of the traction energy cost intensity and <b>passenger</b> transport efficiency of the train with varying its <b>passenger</b> capacity utilization rate and target speed. It is found that if the <b>passenger</b> capacity utilization rate of such a train is higher than 60. 00 %, the effect of its <b>passenger</b> capacity utilization rate and target speed on its traction energy cost intensity and <b>passenger</b> transport efficiency is relatively very small. In contrast, if the <b>passenger</b> capacity utilization rate of the train is reduced from 40. 00 %, the efficiencies of its traction energy cost and <b>passenger</b> transport both decrease obviously and such decreases are evidently affected by its target speed. Therefore, strictly preventing the <b>passenger</b> capacity utilization rate of a conventional intercity <b>passenger</b> train from decreasing from 40. 00 % in particular and meanwhile striving to make its <b>passenger</b> capacity utilization rate higher than 60. 00 % as new evaluation benchmarking are able to effectively improve the railway <b>passenger</b> transport operation management in China...|$|R
5|$|Prior to impact, <b>passengers</b> did {{not assume}} the brace position.

Some <b>passengers</b> tried to move from their seats while their seatbelts were still buckled, and other <b>passengers</b> had difficulty locating and releasing their seatbelt buckles because of disorientation. Following the accident, <b>passengers</b> reported fires in the forward left and aft portions of the airplane, including many small fires on the water. <b>Passengers</b> stated that they escaped through large holes in the cabin. The lead flight attendant and first officer escaped {{through a hole in}} the cabin floor near the flight attendant’s position. Several <b>passengers</b> reported assisting others out of the cabin and into the knee-deep water.

40|$|This study’s goal is {{to reduce}} the number of flights and {{alleviate}} congestion in hub airports. It proposes a flight time and frequency-optimization method for multiairport systems. A flight time and frequency-optimization model for multiairport system operation is created to minimize loss of <b>passenger</b> trip time. A k-means clustering algorithm is designed to solve the model and calculate indexes such as flight time and frequency, <b>passenger</b> trip-time loss, and distribution of airplane models and quantity. The calculation results of an example in China are as follows. Under multiairport system operation mode, <b>passenger</b> demands are divided into 7 categories; 11 flights satisfy all <b>passenger</b> demands; <b>passenger</b> trip-time loss is 129, 573 [*]min; and the average <b>passenger</b> load factor is 90. 1 %. Under an independent operation mode, <b>passenger</b> demands are divided into 8 categories; 13 flights satisfy all <b>passenger</b> demands; <b>passenger</b> trip-time loss is 173, 705 [*]min; and the average <b>passenger</b> load factor is 87. 4 %. The multiairport system operation mode not only improves <b>passenger</b> trip efficiency but also benefits airlines by improving the <b>passenger</b> load factor and reducing flights. Moreover, comparative analysis of a genetic algorithm versus a clustering algorithm further proves the accuracy of the clustering algorithm...|$|R
40|$|Aircraft {{operators}} {{must ensure}} that aircraft weight and balance are within certificated limits. It is common practice for operators to determine the <b>passenger</b> load from an average <b>passenger</b> weight. This average <b>passenger</b> weight, {{also known as a}} standard <b>passenger</b> weight, is used if any deviation from the actual <b>passenger</b> weight is minimal and acceptable. This standard <b>passenger</b> weight is typically derived from surveys and must be reviewed and updated periodically to accurately reflect the flying public population. National Aviation Authorities (NAA) offer advice on standard <b>passenger</b> weights relevant to the population within the NAAs jurisdiction. The same aircraft operating under different NAAs may not be operating with the same weight estimate for the same <b>passenger.</b> Variation in the national average weights, attitudes towards exercise, consumption and national wealth are all factors that can create variations in NAA standard <b>passenger</b> weights. This paper is an exploration into the methods and statistics recommended by NAAs for estimating a standard <b>passenger</b> weight. A perspective on future of standard <b>passenger</b> weight legislation is discussed from an Australian and global perspective with potential solutions presented and discussed...|$|R
