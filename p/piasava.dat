Never displaying one solid color, even the darkest of Pati rings will reveal hints of reds and light browns. The Dende coconut, {{closely related to the}} Licuri palm nut, exhibits a much deeper brown complemented by light beige streaks. The <b>Piasava</b> coconut, with its hazel-brown shell, is the largest coconut {{that can be used for}} jewelry. This allows production of larger hoops. According to some makers of jewelry, after being worn for few weeks, the colors on the <b>Piasava</b> rings and earrings will slowly begin to change into a slightly darker, richer caramel brown. Dende coconuts are also found in white, when they are young.|$|E

The three types of coconut used in the {{production}} of the rings and earrings are known as palm nuts. The Pati (pah-chee), the Dende (den-day), and the <b>Piasava</b> (pee-ah-sava) palm nuts are related to the Tagua nut of Africa, also known as vegetable ivory. When tumbled and polished these types of coconuts reveal the beautiful colors that lay hidden beneath their raw outer surface.|$|E
