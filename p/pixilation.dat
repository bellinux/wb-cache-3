25|$|On November 30, 1910, Cohl left Gaumont for Pathé, {{probably}} for more money. He made only two animated films before being forced into exclusively live-action {{work as a}} director of burlesques starring Jobard (Lucien Cazalis), {{one of the first}} generation of great screen comics. Cohl made ten Jobard films between March and May 1911 before leaving for a vacation. Apparently, one of these films was the origin of <b>pixilation,</b> the technique of applying stop-motion to human beings.|$|E
500|$|Justin Heckert of Atlanta {{magazine}} {{opined that}} [...] "the animation and art {{look like they}} were done by daycare students", while Lucy Maher of Common Sense Media rated it one star, criticizing Fitz's [...] "anarchist" [...] qualities and ultimately stated that [...] "parents with teens {{who are interested in}} watching should preview an episode or two before letting them tune in on their own." [...] Felix Staica of Impulse Gamer gave the DVD release 8.3 out of 10, stating he was [...] "left confounded" [...] after watching and noted the video transfer as [...] "decidedly and deliberately rough, with weird unfocused <b>pixilation</b> [...] cropping up frequently." ...|$|E
5000|$|<b>Pixilation</b> {{involves}} the use of live humans as stop motion characters. This allows for a number of surreal effects, including disappearances and reappearances, allowing people to appear to slide across the ground, and other effects. Examples of <b>pixilation</b> include The Secret Adventures of Tom Thumb and Angry Kid shorts.|$|E
50|$|Due to {{generally}} poor {{sales in}} the entire comics industry {{at the time of}} the Marvel Comics bankruptcy, the series was dropped after only a few issues. Thereafter the artist contributed short pieces to other comics as time and inclination permitted. Taral also created many back covers for Gremlin Trouble, a comic published by AB <b>Pixilations.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The Caractacus Potts inventions in {{the film}} were created by Rowland Emett; by 1976, Time magazine, {{describing}} Emett's work, said no term other than [...] "Fantasticator...could remotely convey the diverse genius of the perky, pink-cheeked Englishman whose <b>pixilations,</b> in cartoon, watercolor and clanking 3-D reality, range from the celebrated Far Tottering and Oyster Creek Railway to the demented thingamabobs that made the 1968 movie Chitty Chitty Bang Bang a minuscule classic." ...|$|R
5000|$|The Super-8 {{films that}} Beckman created and {{exhibited}} prior to 1978, such as White Man Has Clean Hands (1977) and Hit and Run (1977), used basic prop-constructions and do-it-yourself special effects. After reading Swiss child psychologist Jean Piaget's Genetic Epistemology, Beckman began her [...] "Super-8 Trilogy." [...] This trio of experimental films created between 1978 and 1980 included We Imitate; We Break Up (1978), [...] The Broken Rule (1979), and Out of Hand (1980), and featured split screens superimpositions and ingenious <b>pixilations.</b> In these films Beckman used herself and a rotating cast, including James Casebere, Mike Kelley, Matt Mullican, James Welling, Kirby Dick, and Paul McMahon, as performers. [...] The films combined childhood dream recollections with Piaget's {{ideas on the}} cognitive development of children. Beckman's [...] "Super-8 Trilogy" [...] demonstrated her ability to express her ideas using technical wizardry and poetic narrative. Out of Hand {{was one of the}} reasons the Whitney Biennial began to include Super-8 films.|$|R

50|$|McLaren's Oscar-winning Neighbours popularized {{the form}} of {{character}} movement referred to as <b>pixilation,</b> a variant of stop motion. The term <b>pixilation</b> itself was created by NFB animator Grant Munro in an experimental film of the same name. In 2015, the NFB's animation studios were credited as helping to lead a revival in stop-motion animation in Canada, building on the tradition of NFB animators such as McLaren and Co Hoedeman.|$|E
50|$|In {{the main}} {{area of the}} festival there are several mini-workshops that teach the public how to animate in several styles. There are <b>pixilation,</b> stop motion, hand drawn.|$|E

50|$|An effect {{similar to}} <b>pixilation</b> can be {{achieved}} by dropping occasional frames from a conventionally recorded movie. While obviously easier than the stop-frame technique, this does not achieve the same quality.|$|E
50|$|Dom (Polish for House) is a 1958 Polish {{short film}} {{directed}} by Walerian Borowczyk and Jan Lenica. The short combines live action with various animation techniques, such as stop motion, cut-out animation and <b>pixilation.</b>|$|E

50|$|The studio's {{films are}} often dark and surrealistic, {{described}} by Borthwick as presenting “a reality that's just slightly sideways”. Their films often employ experimental or uncommon animation {{techniques such as}} <b>pixilation</b> (posing and shooting live actors frame-by-frame).|$|E

5000|$|In 1949, Lambart and McLaren co-directed Begone Dull Care, {{which was}} {{designated}} as a [...] "masterwork" [...] by the Audio-Visual Preservation Trust of Canada. She also did animation for McLaren and Claude Jutra's <b>pixilation</b> film A Chairy Tale.|$|E
50|$|Langan's films {{typically}} involve technical experimentation, {{particularly the}} manipulation of time. Surreal sequences appear frequently in his films. He {{is known for his}} use of the experimental animation technique, <b>pixilation,</b> and his adaptation of the historical photographic technique, chronophotography.|$|E
50|$|Unlike most Aardman productions, Angry Kid was {{not created}} using clay {{animation}} but {{a combination of}} <b>pixilation</b> (using masks for facial expressions) and stop motion puppetry. Series 3 onwards uses CGI for Angry Kid's head, along with live action.|$|E
50|$|The <b>pixilation</b> {{technique}} {{was also used}} {{for the opening of}} Claymation, Will Vinton's 1978, 17-minute documentary about his animation studio's production techniques, the first time the famous trademarked Claymation term was used, now a term synonymous with all clay animation.|$|E
5000|$|During the mid 1960s, Menville and Janson co-produced {{a series}} of short live-action films, among them the Academy Award-nominated Stop Look and Listen, an {{innovative}} stop-motion <b>pixilation</b> experiment in which the main characters [...] "drive" [...] down city streets in invisible cars.|$|E
50|$|Disney {{and other}} Hollywood studios saw little {{use for the}} {{technique}}, and so the <b>pixilation</b> technique became largely forgotten after McLaren moved on to using other animation techniques for later films. But Menville and Janson revived the all-but-forgotten technique, introducing it to a new generation.|$|E
50|$|The {{music video}} {{for the song}} is {{directed}} by Lynne Harty and uses a <b>pixilation</b> animation effect. The action of the video is displayed in a center partition and consists of various women, along with Brad Roberts, posing and dancing {{in front of the}} camera.|$|E
50|$|The film {{displays}} one of {{the earliest}} uses of stop motion animation in history, though it is not de Chomón's first try at this technique. His 1906 film, Le théâtre de Bob, uses animated puppets. However, El Hotel eléctrico is also an early use of <b>pixilation.</b>|$|E
50|$|The lower {{production}} costs of short films often mean that short films can cover alternative subject matter {{as compared to}} higher budget feature films. Similarly unconventional filmmaking techniques such as <b>Pixilation</b> or narratives that are told without dialogue, are more often seen in short films than features.|$|E
50|$|While much of {{his work}} is for advertisements, he has made several works of {{independent}} animation, including Pulsar (1990), Form of Stress (1992), Robot Apartments (:ja:ロボットパルタ) (1994 anime series), and Kiadoryoku REAL (1998). Many of his films feature a gear motif, and utilize <b>pixilation</b> and replacement-series animation.|$|E
