60|$|In {{the front}} room Bob West and the detective were having a busy time. At the first rush they each fired a shot {{over the heads of}} the mob, merely to let them know the place was guarded. In the {{darkness}} it was impossible for the strikers to tell how many armed men confronted them, so they fell back a little, but formed a cordon around the entire building. From the printing office to the old mill was a distance of only a few hundred feet, and every able-bodied inhabitant of Millville except Peggy McNutt and Sara Cotting--who had discreetly disappeared at the first sign of danger--was assisting Joe Wegg to <b>protect</b> the <b>electric</b> <b>cable</b> he was trying to connect. The men from Royal were scattered all along the line, peering through the dim light to discover a vulnerable point of attack but deterred from interfering by the determination of the stalwart defenders. Mobs are invariably cowardly, and this one, composed of the lowest strata of mixed American and foreign laborers, was no exception to the general rule. However, when word was finally passed along from the mill that the dynamo was running and supplying power to the printing press, a howl of rage went up and a sudden rush was made for the line, the attack concentrating at one point.|$|R

The hardware circuit of this system is composed of collector, host control machine and PC. Through the real-time temperature inspecting of the <b>electric</b> <b>cable</b> interface, a series of the display value, figures and tables online can be got. Through {{the analysis of the}} temperature curve, we can predict the aging and the overheating of the <b>electric</b> <b>cable</b> interface and the possibility of all kinds of accident, and it helps for eliminating the hazards of the <b>electric</b> <b>cable</b> interface and provides the effective guarantee for the safety operation of the <b>electric</b> <b>cable</b> interface...|$|R
