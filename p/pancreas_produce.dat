5000|$|Diabetes type 1 {{is caused}} by the {{destruction}} of enough beta cells to produce symptoms; these cells, which are found in the Islets of Langerhans in the <b>pancreas,</b> <b>produce</b> and secrete insulin, the single hormone responsible for allowing glucose to enter from the blood into cells (in addition to the hormone amylin, another hormone required for glucose homeostasis).

Although preproinsulin of various organism has been isolated and cloned, but there is no report from buffalo (Bubalus bubalis) that is our major livestock. The genomic DNA of buffalo was isolated using Laura-Lee-Boodram method. The part of preproinsulin gene (596 bp and 520 bp) using BPPI-UPS and bpiful_F as forward and BC 1 -C as reverse primer was amplified. Cloning of amplified fragments of gene were performed in pCR 2. 1 vector. Positive clones were screened on the basis of blue white selection.

In looking for the source of dopamine in the small intestine, we found that the duodenal juice contains high levels of dopamine and that the pancreas itself has a high dopamine [and dihydroxyphenylalanine (dopa) ] content that does not change significantly after chemical sympathectomy. Furthermore, we were able to demonstrate tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) activity in control pancreas as well as in pancreas from rats after chemical sympathectomy. Immunostaining and in situ hybridization histochemistry confirmed both the presence of TH, dopamine, and the dopamine transporter, and the mRNAs encoding TH and dopamine transporter, and the presence of both types of vesicular monoamine transporters in the exocrine cells of the pancreas. Since there are no catecholaminergic enteric ganglia in the pancreas, the above results indicate that pancreatic cells have all the characteristics of dopamine-producing cells.

40|$|Aims/hypothesis: Although cells expressing insulin are {{detected}} {{early in}} human fetal development, islets isolated from fetal pancreases show poor insulin secretory responses to glucose, {{which may be}} the result of deficient glucose sensing. We have used dual and triple immunolabelling of human fetal and adult pancreas sections to investigate the presence of proteins that participate in glucose sensing in the pancreatic beta cell, namely glucose transporter 1 (GLUT 1, also known as SLC 2 A 1), glucose transporter 2 (GLUT 2, also known as SLC 2 A 2), glucokinase (GCK) and inwardly rectifying K+ channel (KIR 6. 2, also known as KCNJ 11) and sulphonylurea receptor 1 (SUR 1, also known as ABCC 8) subunits of ATP-sensitive K+ channels (K+ ATP channels). Materials and methods: Pancreases obtained with ethical approval from human fetuses from 11 to 36 weeks of gestation, from infants and from adults were formalin-fixed and embedded in paraffin. Sections were labelled with antibodies to proteins of interest. Co-production of antigens was examined by dual and triple immunolabelling. Results: GLUT 2 and K+ ATP channel labelling was detected in the 11 -week pancreas, but largely within the pancreatic epithelium, whereas no labelling for GLUT 1 was observed. From 15 weeks, GLUT 1, GCK and K+ ATP channel labelling was detected in an increasing proportion of insulin-positive cells and epithelial labelling with K+ ATP channel antibodies diminished. GLUT 2 was seen in the majority of beta cells only after 7 months of age. Conclusions/ interpretation: The results demonstrate that only a subpopulation of beta cells in the human fetal <b>pancreas</b> <b>produce</b> all key elements of the glucose-sensing apparatus, which may contribute to poor secretory responses in early life. © 2007 Springer-Verlag...|$|E

50|$|Diabetes is a {{metabolic}} disorder {{where the body}} is unable to regulate levels of glucose in the blood either {{because of a lack}} of insulin in the body or the failure, by cells in the body, to respond properly to insulin. Both of these situations can be caused by persistently high elevations of blood glucose levels, through pancreatic burnout and insulin resistance. The pancreas is the organ responsible for the secretion of insulin. Insulin is a hormone that regulates glucose levels, allowing the body's cells to absorb and use glucose. Without it, glucose cannot enter the cell and therefore cannot be used as fuel for the body's functions. If the pancreas is exposed to persistently high elevations of blood glucose levels, the insulin-producing cells in the pancreas could be damaged, causing a lack of insulin in the body. Insulin resistance occurs when the <b>pancreas</b> tries to <b>produce</b> more and more insulin in response to persistently elevated blood glucose levels. Eventually, the rest of the body becomes resistant to the insulin that the <b>pancreas</b> is <b>producing,</b> thereby requiring more insulin to achieve the same blood glucose-lowering effect, and forcing the <b>pancreas</b> to <b>produce</b> even more insulin to compete with the resistance. This negative spiral contributes to pancreatic burnout, and the disease progression of diabetes.|$|R

This type normally occurs in older people and is more common in people who are overweight and physically inactive.|$|R

50|$|The {{pancreas}} {{is a major}} organ {{functioning as}} an accessory digestive gland in the digestive system. It is both an endocrine gland and an exocrine gland. The endocrine part secretes insulin when the blood sugar becomes high; insulin moves glucose from the blood into the muscles and other tissues for use as energy. The endocrine part releases glucagon when the blood sugar is low; glucagon allows stored sugar to {{be broken down into}} glucose by the liver in order to re-balance the sugar levels. The <b>pancreas</b> <b>produces</b> and releases important digestive enzymes in the pancreatic juice that it delivers to the duodenum. The pancreas lies below and {{at the back of the}} stomach. It connects to the duodenum via the pancreatic duct which it joins near to the bile duct's connection where both the bile and pancreatic juice can act on the chyme that is released from the stomach into the duodenum.

In general, diabetes mellitus -derived from the greek diabainein (to fall through) and mellos (as sweet as honey) - reflects a range of chronic metabolic disorders in which we distinguish two main forms: first, juvenile-onset diabetes or insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and second, the maturity-onset form or non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM:), also named type I diabetes, is diagnosed almost exclusively {{before the age of}} thirty years.

Non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), or type II diabetes, is a less severe form, which develops usually after middle age. The pancreas of most NIDDM patients produces sometimes excess insulin and the lack of insulin-effect can be compensated with a dietary regimen or oral medication.

Pancreatic secretory cells further interact via the extracellular matrix of the pancreas (inputs mediated by integrins) and directly with neighboring cells, by mechanisms {{that do not require}} extracellular mediators (inputs mediated by gap and tight junction channels).

40|$|Abstract Background Pancreatic {{cancer is}} a biologically {{aggressive}} disease with less than 20 % of patients suitable for a "curative" surgical resection. This, combined with the poor 5 -year survival indicates that effective palliative methods for symptom relief are required. Currently there are no ablative techniques to treat pancreatic cancer in clinical use. Tissue electrolysis is the delivery of a direct current between an anode and cathode to induce localised necrosis. Electrolysis {{has been shown to}} be safe and reliable in producing hepatic tissue and tumour ablation in animal models and in a limited number of patients. This study investigates the feasibility of using electrolysis to produce localised pancreatic necrosis in a healthy rat model. Method Ten rats were studied in total. Eight rats were treated with variable "doses" of coulombs, and the systemic and local effects were assessed; 2 rats were used as controls. Results Seven rats tolerated the procedure well without morbidity or mortality, and one died immediately post procedure. One control rat died on induction of anaesthesia. Serum amylase and glucose were not significantly affected. Conclusion Electrolysis in the rat <b>pancreas</b> <b>produced</b> localised necrosis and appears both safe, and reproducible. This novel technique could offer significant advantages for patients with unresectable pancreatic tumours.
