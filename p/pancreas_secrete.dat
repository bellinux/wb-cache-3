40|$|Isolated interlobular ducts {{from the}} {{guinea-pig}} <b>pancreas</b> <b>secrete</b> a HCO 3 −-rich fluid {{in response to}} secretin. To determine the role of Cl− transporters in this process, intracellular Cl− concentration ([Cl−]i) was measured in ducts loaded with the Cl−-sensitive fluoroprobe, 6 -methoxy-N-ethylquinolinium chloride (MEQ). [Cl−]i decreased when the luminal Cl− concentration was reduced. This effect was stimulated by forskolin, was not dependent on HCO 3 − and was not inhibited by application of the anion channel/transporter inhibitor H 2 DIDS to the luminal membrane. It is therefore attributed to a cAMP-stimulated Cl− conductance, probably the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) Cl− channel. [Cl−]i also decreased when the basolateral Cl− concentration was reduced. This effect was not stimulated by forskolin, was largely dependent on HCO 3 − and was inhibited by basolateral H 2 DIDS. It is therefore mediated mainly by Cl−/HCO 3 − exchange. With high Cl− and low HCO 3 − concentrations in the lumen, steady-state [Cl−]i was 25 - 35 mm in unstimulated cells. Stimulation with forskolin caused [Cl−]i to increase by approximately 4 mm due to activation of the luminal anion exchanger. With low Cl− and high HCO 3 − concentrations in the lumen to simulate physiological conditions, steady-state [Cl−]i was 10 – 15 mm in unstimulated cells. Upon stimulation with forskolin, [Cl−]i fell to approximately 7 mm due to increased Cl− efflux via the luminal conductance. We conclude that, during stimulation under physiological conditions, [Cl−]i decreases to very low levels in guinea-pig pancreatic duct cells, {{largely as a result}} of the limited capacity of the basolateral transporters for Cl− uptake. The resulting lack of competition from intracellular Cl− may therefore favour HCO 3 − secretion via anion conductances in the luminal membrane, possibly CFTR...|$|E
40|$|The interlobular duct {{cells of}} the {{guinea-pig}} <b>pancreas</b> <b>secrete</b> HCO 3 − across their luminal membrane into a HCO 3 −-rich (125 mM) luminal fluid against a sixfold concentration gradient. Since HCO 3 − transport cannot be achieved by luminal Cl−/HCO 3 − exchange under these conditions, we have investigated {{the possibility that it}} is mediated by an anion conductance. To determine whether the electrochemical potential gradient across the luminal membrane would favor HCO 3 − efflux, we have measured the intracellular potential (Vm) in microperfused, interlobular duct segments under various physiological conditions. When the lumen was perfused with a 124 mM Cl−- 25 mM HCO 3 − solution, a condition similar to the basal state, the resting potential was approximately − 60 mV. Stimulation with dbcAMP or secretin caused a transient hyperpolarization (∼ 5 mV) due to activation of electrogenic Na+-HCO 3 − cotransport at the basolateral membrane. This was followed by depolarization to a steady-state value of approximately − 50 mV as a result of anion efflux across the luminal membrane. Raising the luminal HCO 3 − concentration to 125 mM caused a hyperpolarization (∼ 10 mV) in both stimulated and unstimulated ducts. These results can be explained by a model in which the depolarizing effect of Cl− efflux across the luminal membrane is minimized by the depletion of intracellular Cl− and offset by the hyperpolarizing effects of Na+-HCO 3 − cotransport at the basolateral membrane. The net effect is a luminally directed electrochemical potential gradient for HCO 3 − that is sustained during maximal stimulation. Our calculations indicate that the electrodiffusive efflux of HCO 3 − to the lumen via CFTR, driven by this gradient, would be sufficient to fully account for the observed secretory flux of HCO 3 −...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Non Obese Diabetic mice lacking B cells (NOD. Igμ null mice) do {{not develop}} {{diabetes}} despite their susceptible background. Upon reconstitution of B cells using a chimera approach, animals start developing diabetes at 20 weeks of age. Methods We {{have used the}} spectratyping technique to follow the T cell receptor (TCR) V beta repertoire of NOD. Igμ null mice following B cell reconstitution. This technique provides an unbiased approach to understand the kinetics of TCR expansion. We have also analyzed the TCR repertoire of reconstituted animals receiving cyclophosphamide treatment and following tissue transplants to identify common aggressive clonotypes. Results We found that B cell reconstitution of NOD. Igμ null mice induces a polyclonal TCR repertoire in the pancreas 10 weeks later, gradually diversifying to encompass most BV families. Interestingly, these clonotypic BV expansions are mainly confined to the pancreas and are absent from pancreatic lymph nodes or spleens. Cyclophosphamide-induced diabetes at 10 weeks post-B cell reconstitution reorganized the predominant TCR repertoires by removing potential regulatory clonotypes (BV 1, BV 8 and BV 11) and increasing the frequency of others (BV 4, BV 5 S 2, BV 9, BV 16 - 20). These same clonotypes are more frequently present in neonatal pancreatic transplants under the kidney capsule of B-cell reconstituted diabetic NOD. Igμ null mice, suggesting their higher invasiveness. Phenotypic analysis of the pancreas-infiltrating lymphocytes during diabetes onset in B cell reconstituted animals show a predominance of CD 19 + B cells with a B:T lymphocyte ratio of 4 : 1. In contrast, in other lymphoid organs (pancreatic lymph nodes and spleens) analyzed by FACS, the B:T ratio was 1 : 1. Lymphocytes infiltrating the <b>pancreas</b> <b>secrete</b> large amounts of IL- 6 and are of Th 1 phenotype after CD 3 -CD 28 stimulation in vitro. Conclusions Diabetes in NOD.

5000|$|Secretin was {{the first}} hormone to be identified. In 1902, William Bayliss and Ernest Starling were {{studying}} how the nervous system controls the process of digestion.

They discovered (by cutting all the nerves to the pancreas in their experimental animals) that this process was not, in fact, governed by the nervous system. They determined that a substance secreted by the intestinal lining stimulates the pancreas after being transported via the bloodstream. They named this intestinal secretion secretin.

5000|$|While insulin is <b>secreted</b> by the <b>pancreas</b> {{to lower}} blood glucose levels, {{glucagon}} is secreted to raise blood glucose levels.

[...] When blood glucose levels are low, the <b>pancreas</b> <b>secretes</b> glucagon, which in turn causes the liver to convert stored glycogen polymers into glucose monomers, which is then released into the blood. This process is called glycogenolysis. Liver cells, or hepatocytes, have glucagon receptors which allow for glucagon to attach to them and thus stimulate glycogenolysis. [...] Contrary to insulin, which is produced by pancreatic β-cells, glucagon is produced by pancreatic α-cells. It is also known that an increase in insulin suppresses glucagon secretion, and a decrease in insulin, along with low glucose levels, stimulates the secretion of glucagon.|$|R

The aim {{of the present study was}} to determine whether H+/K+-ATPases are expressed and functional in human pancreatic ducts and whether proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) have effect on those. Here we show that the gastric HKα 1 and HKβ subunits (ATP 4 A; ATP 4 B) and non-gastric HKα 2 subunits (ATP 12 A) of H+/K+-ATPases are expressed in human pancreatic cells. Pumps have similar localizations in duct cell monolayers (Capan- 1) and human pancreas, and notably the gastric pumps are localized on the luminal membranes. In Capan- 1 cells, PPIs inhibited recovery of intracellular pH from acidosis. Furthermore, in rats treated with PPIs, pancreatic secretion was inhibited but concentrations of major ions in secretion follow similar excretory curves in control and PPI treated animals. In addition to HCO 3 -, <b>pancreas</b> also <b>secretes</b> K+. In conclusion, this study calls for a revision of the basic model for HCO 3 - secretion. We propose that proton transport is driving secretion, and that in addition it may provide a protective pH buffer zone and K+ recirculation.

50|$|The Hay System {{promoted}} eating {{three meals}} per day with meal one being what the diet {{considers to be}} alkaline foods only, meal two composed of what the diet considers to be protein foods with salads, vegetables and fruit, and meal three composed of what the diet considers to be starchy foods with salads, vegetables and sweet fruit; with an interval of 4.0 to 4.5 hours between each meal. The Hay diet was popular in the 1930s and many restaurants offered 'Hay-friendly' menus; followers of his dietary advice, included Henry Ford and Man Ray. In this period Hay was criticized in the Journal of the American Medical Society (JAMA) as a food-faddist and separately for advocating that a patient with type 1 diabetes on the Hay diet should stop taking insulin.

50|$|Pulsatile {{intravenous}} insulin therapy, {{sometimes called}} metabolic activation therapy, or cellular activation therapy describes in a literal sense the intravenous injection of insulin in pulses versus continuous infusions. Injection of insulin in pulses mimics the physiological secretions of insulin by the pancreas into the portal vein which then drains into the liver. In healthy, non-diabetic individuals, pancreatic secretions of insulin {{correspond to the}} intake of food. The <b>pancreas</b> will <b>secrete</b> variable amounts of insulin based upon {{the amount of food}} consumed (basically speaking, the more food that is consumed, the more insulin the <b>pancreas</b> will <b>secrete)</b> among other factors. Continuous exposure to insulin and glucagon is known to decrease the hormones’ metabolic effectiveness on glucose production in humans due to the body developing an increased tolerance to the hormones. Down-regulation at the cellular level may partially explain the decreased action of steady-state levels of insulin, while pulsatile hormone secretion may allow recovery of receptor affinity and numbers for insulin. Intermittent intravenous insulin administration with peaks of insulin concentrations may enhance suppression of gluconeogenesis and reduce hepatic glucose production.|$|R

40|$|<b>Pancreas</b> <b>secretes</b> fluid rich in {{digestive}} enzymes and bicarbonate. The alkaline secretion {{is important in}} buffering of acid chyme entering duodenum and for activation of enzymes. This secretion is formed in pancreatic ducts, and studies to date show that plasma membranes of duct epithelium express H+/HCO 3 − transporters, which depend on gradients created by the Na+/K+-ATPase. However, the model cannot fully account for high-bicarbonate concentrations, and other active transporters, i. e. pumps, have not been explored. Here we show that pancreatic ducts express functional gastric and non-gastric H+-K+-ATPases. We measured intracellular pH and secretion in small ducts isolated from rat pancreas and showed their sensitivity to H+-K+ pump inhibitors and ion substitutions. Gastric and non-gastric H+-K+ pumps were demonstrated on RNA and protein levels, and pumps were localized to the plasma membranes of pancreatic ducts. Quantitative analysis of H+/HCO 3 − and fluid transport shows that the H+-K+ pumps can contribute to pancreatic secretion in several species. Our results call for revision of the bicarbonate transport physiology in pancreas, and most likely other epithelia.

40|$|Pancreatic tumours are scirrhous, {{avascular}} tumours, {{suggesting that}} they may produce angiogenesis inhibitors that suppress {{the growth of the}} vasculature to the tumour and metastases. We have sought evidence for the angiogenesis inhibitor, endostatin, in normal and cancerous pancreatic tissue. Using Western blotting, we found mature 20 [*]kDa endostatin in cancer tissue but not in normal tissue. Several endostatin-related peptides of higher mol wt were present in both tissues. Extracts from normal tissue were able to degrade exogenous endostatin, whereas extracts from cancer were without effect. Although the exocrine <b>pancreas</b> <b>secretes</b> inactive proenzymes of trypsin, chymotrypsin and elastase, their possible role in this degradation was examined. The trypsin/chymotrypsin inhibitor, Glycine max, did not prevent the degradation of endostatin by normal pancreatic extracts but elastatinal, a specific inhibitor of elastase, reduced the rate of degradation. Extracts of pancreatic tumours did not express any detectable elastase activity, but an elastase (Km 1. 1 [*]mM) was expressed by extracts of normal pancreas. We conclude that endostatin is present and stable in pancreatic cancer tissues, which may explain their avascular nature, but that normal pancreatic tissue expresses enzymes, including elastase, which rapidly degrade endostatin.

Of three classes of steroid agonists applied (androgen - Testosterone propionate (TP), estrogen - Diethystilbesterol (DES) and glucocorticoid - Dexamethasone (DEX)), only androgens (TP) caused altered pancreatic development. Beta cell numbers were significantly elevated in prenatally androgenised female fetuses (P= 0. 03) (to approximately the higher numbers found in male fetuses), whereas alpha cell counts were unaffected, precipitating decreased alpha:beta cell ratios {{in the developing}} fetal pancreas (P= 0. 001), sustained into adolescence (P= 0. 0004).

40|$|ABSTRACT Micropuncture {{techniques}} {{have been used}} to examine electrolyte secretion by the in vitro rabbit pancreas. The concentration profiles of the major secreted ions and digestive protein and the electrical potential profile within the pancreatic ductal system have been determined during spontaneous and secretin-stimulated secretion. The active transport of both Na and HCO 3 are the rate-controlling steps in primary secretion. Spontaneous secretion is produced primarily within the intralobular ducts. The anion composition of this primary secretion depends on the secretion rate with HCO 3 ranging from about 70 meq/liter at low rates to about 110 meq/liter at high rates. With secretin stimulation the smaller extralobular ducts also secrete and this extralobular secretion has a higher HCO? content than that of the intralobular secretion. In the main collecting duct the anion composition of the juice is modified further by Cl-HC 03 exchange which appears to be a passive process depending on the average residence time of the juice in the main duct. Little is known definitively about the mechanisms responsible for pancreatic electrolyte secretion either at the whole tissue or the cellular level. The <b>pancreas</b> <b>secretes</b> a fluid rich in HCO 3 into a highly branched ductal system through which it is transported to the duodenum to aid in the neutralization of gastric secretion. Due to the complex geometry of the ductal system, electrolyte secretion has been studied primarily by collecting and analyzing the juice leaving the gland. The characteristic feature of the externally collected juice is a hyperbolic dependence of the juice HCO 3 concentration on the secretion rate (1). Over the years three major whole tissue mechanisms, admixture (2, 3), Cl-HCO 3 exchange (4), and unicellular (5 - 7) have been proposed to explain this dependency.
