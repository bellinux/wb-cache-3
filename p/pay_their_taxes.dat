5|$|The Dibbles' {{house was}} foreclosed around 1897 {{after they were}} unable to <b>pay</b> <b>their</b> <b>taxes,</b> and they moved to Portland, Oregon by 1900. It {{exchanged}} hands several times until 1917, when Gideon and Mary Hart Jones purchased it. The Jones family owned the house until 1933 (and notably added a kitchen which created the west wing of the house); thus, it was the Jones family who allowed Grant Wood to use their home as a backdrop for American Gothic.|$|E

50|$|Note: The income {{generated}} by {{the capital city of}} the erstwhile Andhra Pradesh is a complex issue with income being generated from all regions. This has caused a lot of confusion in region-wise income distribution. Also, after the bifurcation, companies will <b>pay</b> <b>their</b> portion of <b>taxes</b> to Telangana or present day Andhra Pradesh depending on where they operate(Before bifurcation, lot of companies were <b>paying</b> <b>their</b> <b>taxes</b> in capital city Hyderabad even for their operations in Seemandhra).|$|R
5|$|In 1640, {{masses of}} Chinese peasants who were starving, unable to <b>pay</b> <b>their</b> <b>taxes,</b> {{and no longer}} in fear of the {{frequently}} defeated Chinese army, began to form into huge bands of rebels. The Chinese military, caught between fruitless efforts to defeat the Manchu raiders {{from the north and}} huge peasant revolts in the provinces, essentially fell apart. Unpaid and unfed, the army was defeated by Li Zicheng – now self-styled as the Prince of Shun – and deserted the capital without much of a fight. On 26 May 1644, Beijing fell to a rebel army led by Li Zicheng when the city gates were opened by rebel allies from within. During the turmoil, the last Ming emperor hanged himself on a tree in the imperial garden outside the Forbidden City.|$|E
5|$|By the 16th century, {{however, the}} {{expansion}} of European trade – albeit restricted to islands near Guangzhou like Macau – spread the Columbian Exchange of crops, plants, and animals into China, introducing chili peppers to Sichuan cuisine and highly productive corn and potatoes, which diminished famines and spurred population growth. The growth of Portuguese, Spanish, and Dutch trade created new demand for Chinese products and produced a massive influx of Japanese and American silver. This abundance of specie remonetized the Ming economy, whose paper money had suffered repeated hyperinflation and was no longer trusted. While traditional Confucians opposed such a prominent role for commerce and the newly rich it created, the heterodoxy introduced by Wang Yangming permitted a more accommodating attitude. Zhang Juzheng's initially successful reforms proved devastating when a slowdown in agriculture produced by the Little Ice Age joined changes in Japanese and Spanish policy that quickly cut off the supply of silver now necessary for farmers {{to be able to}} <b>pay</b> <b>their</b> <b>taxes.</b> Combined with crop failure, floods, and epidemic, the dynasty collapsed before the rebel leader Li Zicheng, who was defeated by the Manchu-led Eight Banner armies who founded the Qing dynasty.|$|E

25|$|Although tin {{mining and}} coffee {{cultivation}} {{began in the}} 1920s, the country's isolation and difficult terrain meant that Laos largely remained economically unviable to the French.

25|$|The young republic, {{like the}} rest of the world, found itself in a deep {{economic}} crisis during the Great Depression. Mustafa Kemal reacted to conditions of this period by moving toward integrated economic polices, and establishing a central bank to control exchange rates. However, Turkey could not finance essential imports; its currency was shunned and zealous revenue officials seized the meagre possessions of peasants who could not <b>pay</b> <b>their</b> <b>taxes.</b>|$|E
25|$|After the war, new {{problems}} arose {{especially for the}} citizens of the island of Basilan. The people there found it difficult to appear in courts, <b>pay</b> <b>their</b> <b>taxes,</b> seek help from the mayor and other officials. Going from Basilan to the mainland required three or more hours of travel. To fix the problem, Representative Juan Alano filed a bill in Congress to separate Basilan from Zamboanga City. So the island of Basilan was proclaimed a separate city through Republic Act No. 288 on July 16, 1948.|$|E
25|$|Mellon {{believed}} that the income tax should remain progressive but with lower rates than those enacted during World War I. He thought that the top income earners would willingly <b>pay</b> <b>their</b> <b>taxes</b> only if rates were 25% or lower. Mellon proposed tax rate cuts, which Congress enacted in the Revenue Acts of 1921, 1924, and 1926. The top marginal tax rate was cut from 73% to 58% in 1922, 50% in 1923, 46% in 1924, 25% in 1925, and 24% in 1929. Rates in lower brackets were also cut substantially, relieving burdens on the middle-class, working-class, and poor households.|$|E

25|$|Same-sex {{marriage}} {{can provide}} those in same-sex relationships who <b>pay</b> <b>their</b> <b>taxes</b> with government services and make financial demands on them {{comparable to those}} afforded to and required of those in opposite-sex marriages. Same-sex marriage also gives them legal protections such as inheritance and hospital visitation rights. Various faith communities around the world support allowing those {{of the same sex}} to marry, while many major religions oppose same-sex marriage. Opponents of same-sex marriages have argued that recognition of same-sex marriages would erode religious freedoms, undermine a right of children to be raised by their biological mother and father or erode the institution of marriage itself.|$|E
25|$|A freedman {{could apply}} to the General Assembly or the county court for {{permission}} to remain in Virginia. The life of a freedman was often perilous, {{with the prospect of}} re-enslavement a constant hazard. A freedman could be enslaved for infractions of the law, debt or vagrancy. In Monroe County in 1829 the sheriff was ordered to sell into slavery eight freedmen for failure to <b>pay</b> <b>their</b> <b>taxes.</b> Freedmen were also required to carry their papers as proof of their status and failure to do so could result in a fine or imprisonment. Any slave who was away from his owner's property was required to carry a written pass as slave patrols were on the lookout for runaways or unsupervised slaves.|$|E

25|$|As {{with much}} of Europe, Wales {{remained}} predominantly rural {{at the turn of}} the 13th century, but Llywelyn encouraged the growth of quasi-urban settlements within the Welsh principality which served as centres of trade and commerce.

25|$|After {{thirteen}} {{years of high}} annual growth, the sales flattened in 1987. On 16 October, the company announced that its sales targets for the year would not be met, and a planned placement of new shares was canceled. On the morning of 19 October 1987, the share price fell from NOK240 to 180. By the end of trading on NASDAQ, the share price was down to NOK120. The price continued to fall and hit NOK80 some days later, in part because many employees had to sell shares to <b>pay</b> <b>their</b> <b>taxes.</b> The economy of Norway was hit hard and employees in ND were especially stricken because of their bonuses having been paid in shares. From 1988, ND stopped recruiting new employees. A reorganization took place in which all group leaders were laid off and told to apply for new jobs as project leaders. The issue resulted in severe bad media coverage.|$|E
25|$|The Acting Governor {{soon found}} {{himself with a}} major problem. Under {{territorial}} law at the time, the legislature was empowered to apportion itself. In practice the apportionment had been delegated to the governor. In January 1869, Judge Henry T. Backus issued a ruling that this arrangement was unconstitutional. As a result, {{the legality of the}} territorial government was thrown into question, and some residents refused to <b>pay</b> <b>their</b> <b>taxes.</b> Carter called for the United States Congress, in its supervisory capacity, to pass legislation correcting the issue. While the needed legislation was passed, it did not come until after Carter left office. In the meantime, the Acting Governor failed to call for a meeting of the territorial legislature in 1869. This oversight may have been partially due to Carter experiencing another bout of health problems. He did commute the death sentence of Delore Moore who had been convicted of killing her husband.|$|E
25|$|In 1917, {{the year}} before Willingdon's {{resignation}} of the governorship, a severe famine {{broke out in the}} Kheda region of the Bombay Presidency, which had far reaching effects on the economy and left farmers in no position to <b>pay</b> <b>their</b> <b>taxes.</b> Still, the government insisted that tax not only be paid but also implemented a 23% increase to the levies to take effect that year. Kheda thus became the setting for Gandhi's first satyagraha in India, and, with support from Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, Narhari Parikh, Mohanlal Pandya, and Ravi Shankar Vyas, organised a Gujarat sabha. The people under Gandhi's influence then rallied together and sent a petition to Willingdon, asking that he cancel the taxes for that year. However, the Cabinet refused and advised the Governor to begin confiscating property by force, leading Gandhi to thereafter employ non-violent resistance to the government, which eventually succeeded and made Gandhi famous throughout India after Willingdon's departure from the colony. For his actions there, in relation to governance and the war effort, Willingdon was on 3 June 1918 appointed by the King as a Knight Grand Commander of the Order of the Star of India.|$|E
