The empirical analysis, {{covering the}} period 1997 to 2002, evaluates the impact upon VC <b>pay</b> awards of university performance measures, an internal <b>pay</b> comparison measure and two external <b>pay</b> comparisons, i. e., the <b>pay</b> of other VCs and the <b>pay</b> of CEOs leading comparable-sized UK firms. We find {{no evidence that}} VC <b>pay</b> awards are related {{to any of the}} performance measures, though the positive relationship found between changes in the proportion of other highly-paid employees and VC <b>pay</b> awards suggests that internal <b>pay</b> comparisons {{play an important role in}} remuneration committee decision making. Of the two external <b>pay</b> benchmarks, the <b>pay</b> received by other VCs has the largest positive impact upon VC <b>pay</b> awards. Nevertheless, the (much smaller) partial adjustment of VC <b>pay</b> explained by the difference between the two external <b>pay</b> benchmarks was also statistically significant. Thus, whilst average VC <b>pay</b> increased by some 40 % over the period, this was significantly less than the increase in the <b>pay</b> of comparable UK CEOs.

40|$|According to {{motivation}} theories, remuneration {{managers have}} to understand which <b>pay</b> referents their firm’s employees are comparing their <b>pay</b> with {{in order to keep}} the employees satisfied with their <b>pay</b> level. This study argues that despite the importance of information on <b>pay</b> referent selection in design-ing the <b>pay</b> structure, two of the most common methods used to identify the relative importance of <b>pay</b> referents are methodologically or practically defi-cient. The direct approach asks employees to identify their <b>pay</b> referents and it is difficult to draw conclusions regarding the relative importance of these <b>pay</b> referents. The inferential approach asks employees to evaluate their <b>pay</b> satisfaction when compared to various <b>pay</b> referents, and remuneration man-agers then face the risk that employees will become critical about their present <b>pay</b> situation.

In addition, it examines the role of two <b>pay</b> strategy variables (<b>pay</b> leadership position and external versus internal orientation) in job <b>pay</b> decisions, controlling for differences in organizational demographic characteristics (e. g., size, industry). Results suggest that <b>pay</b> strategies affect assigned <b>pay</b> levels, with higher <b>pay</b> being assigned by managers from fmns with market-leading strategies and internal <b>pay</b> orientations. In addition, <b>pay</b> strategies appear to influence the relative weights attached to market survey versus job evaluation infonnation in pay-setting for jobs.

The following determinants, job based <b>pay,</b> performance based <b>pay,</b> skills based <b>pay,</b> education and training, and tenure based <b>pay</b> were constructed from literature to formulate the conceptual model for the <b>pay</b> of operators in the manufacturing sector of Port Elizabeth. There are a number of factors that are at play in the determination and design of <b>pay</b> systems, which need to be considered.
