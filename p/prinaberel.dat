50|$|<b>Prinaberel</b> (INN, USAN) (developmental code names ERB-041, WAY-202041) is a synthetic, nonsteroidal, {{and highly}} {{selective}} agonist of the ERβ subtype of the estrogen receptor. It {{is used in}} scientific research to elucidate {{the role of the}} ERβ receptor. Studies have indicated that selective ERβ agonists like <b>prinaberel</b> could be useful in the clinical treatment of a variety of medical conditions including inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis, endometriosis, and sepsis. Accordingly, <b>prinaberel</b> either was or still is under investigation by Wyeth for the treatment of some of these conditions.|$|E
5000|$|Selective ERα or ERβ agonists: diarylpropionitrile, ERB-196, erteberel, FERb 033, GTx-758, <b>prinaberel,</b> propylpyrazoletriol, WAY-166818, WAY-214156 ...|$|E
5000|$|Estrogens: benzestrol, bifluranol, estrobin (DBE), {{diethylstilbestrol}} (stilbestrol), dienestrol, erteberel, fosfestrol, hexestrol (dihydroxystilbestrol), methallenestril, methestrol, methestrol dipropionate, paroxypropione, <b>prinaberel,</b> and triphenylethylene, {{as well as}} many xenoestrogens ...|$|E
50|$|ERA-63, {{also known}} as ORG-37663, as well as 3-methylene-7α-methyl-17α-ethynylestra-5(10)-en-17β-ol, is a synthetic, steroidal {{estrogen}} and a selective agonist of the ERα that was under development {{for the treatment of}} rheumatoid arthritis but was never marketed. The drug produced estrogenic effects but failed to show effectiveness for rheumatoid arthritis in a phase IIa clinical study. A large clinical trial also found that <b>prinaberel</b> (ERB-041), a selective ERβ agonist, was ineffective in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis in spite of activity in preclinical models.|$|E
50|$|WAY-214156 is a synthetic, nonsteroidal {{estrogen}} {{that acts}} as a highly selective agonist of the ERβ. It is 100-fold selective for the ERβ over the ERα with an IC50 of 4.2 nM (compare to estradiol with IC50 values of ~3-4 nM for both the ERα and ERβ). The drug is less selective for the ERβ than is <b>prinaberel</b> (ERB-041, WAY-202041), another selective ERβ agonist, but is more potent in comparison. WAY-214156 may produce anti-inflammatory effects via the ERβ and has been proposed as a potential treatment for inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis.|$|E
50|$|Diarylpropionitrile (DPN), {{also known}} as 2,3-bis(p-hydroxyphenyl)propionitrile (2,3-BHPPN), is a synthetic, nonsteroidal, and highly {{selective}} agonist of ERβ (IC50 = 15 nM)http://www.sigmaaldrich.com/catalog/product/sigma/h5915?lang=en&region=US that is used widely in scientific research to study the function of this receptor. It is 70-fold more selective for ERβ over ERα, and has 100-fold lower affinity for GPER (GPR30) relative to estradiol. DPN produces antidepressant- and anxiolytic-like effects in animals via activation of the endogenous oxytocin system. First reported in 2001, DPN was the first selective ERβ agonist to be discovered, and was followed by <b>prinaberel</b> (ERB-041, WAY-202041), WAY-200070, and 8β-VE2 in 2004, ERB-196 (WAY-202196) in 2005, and certain phytoestrogens like liquiritigenin and nyasol (cis-hinokiresinol) since 2007.|$|E
