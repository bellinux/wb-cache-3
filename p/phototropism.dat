25|$|Response to stimuli: a {{response}} {{can take many}} forms, from the contraction of a unicellular organism to external chemicals, to complex reactions involving all the senses of multicellular organisms. A response is often expressed by motion; for example, the leaves of a plant turning toward the sun (<b>phototropism),</b> and chemotaxis.|$|E
25|$|Auxin {{participates in}} <b>phototropism,</b> geotropism, hydrotropism and other {{developmental}} changes. The uneven distribution of auxin, due to environmental cues, such as unidirectional light or gravity force, results in uneven plant tissue growth, and generally, auxin governs {{the form and}} shape of plant body, direction and strength of growth of all organs, and their mutual interaction.|$|E
25|$|In higher plants, {{chloroplast}} {{movement is}} run by phototropins, blue light photoreceptors also responsible for plant <b>phototropism.</b> In some algae, mosses, ferns, and flowering plants, chloroplast movement is influenced by red light in addition to blue light, though very long red wavelengths inhibit movement rather than speeding it up. Blue light generally causes chloroplasts to seek shelter, while red light draws them out to maximize light absorption.|$|E
25|$|Light {{responses}} were even found in roots, previously {{thought to be}} largely insensitive to light. While the gravitropic response of A. thaliana root organs is their predominant tropic response, specimens treated with mutagens and selected {{for the absence of}} gravitropic action showed negative phototropic response to blue or white light, and positive response to red light, indicating that the roots also show positive <b>phototropism.</b>|$|E
25|$|Growth {{of cells}} {{contributes}} to the plant's size, unevenly localized growth produces bending, turning and directionalization of organs- for example, stems turning toward light sources (<b>phototropism),</b> roots growing in response to gravity (gravitropism), and other tropisms originated because cells on one side grow faster than the cells {{on the other side}} of the organ. So, precise control of auxin distribution between different cells has paramount importance to the resulting form of plant growth and organization.|$|E
25|$|A. thaliana {{was used}} {{extensively}} {{in the study of}} the genetic basis of <b>phototropism,</b> chloroplast alignment, and stomatal aperture and other blue light-influenced processes. These traits respond to blue light, which is perceived by the phototropin light receptors. Arabidopsis has also been important in understanding the functions of another blue light receptor, cryptochrome, which is especially important for light entrainment to control the plants' circadian rhythms. When the onset of darkness is unusually early, A. thaliana reduces its metabolism of starch by an amount that effectively requires division.|$|E
25|$|All adaptations help organisms {{survive in}} their {{ecological}} niches. The adaptive traits may be structural, behavioral or physiological. Structural adaptations are physical features of an organism (shape, body covering, armament, internal organization). Behavioral adaptations are inherited behavior chains {{and the ability}} to learn. Behaviors may be inherited in detail (instincts), or a capacity for learning may be inherited (see neuropsychology). Examples: searching for food, mating, vocalizations. Physiological adaptations can permit the organism to perform special functions (for instance, making venom, secreting slime, <b>phototropism),</b> but may also involve more general functions such as growth and development, temperature regulation, ionic balance and other aspects of homeostasis. Adaptation affects all aspects of the life of an organism.|$|E
2500|$|Tropisms {{in plants}} {{are the result}} of {{differential}} cell growth, in which the cells {{on one side of the}} plant elongates more than those on the other side, causing the part to bend toward the side with less growth. [...] Among the common tropisms seen in plants is <b>phototropism,</b> the bending of the plant toward a source of light. [...] <b>Phototropism</b> allows the plant to maximize light exposure in plants which require additional light for photosynthesis, or to minimize it in plants subjected to intense light and heat. Geotropism allows the roots of a plant to determine the direction of gravity and grow downwards. [...] Tropisms generally result from an interaction between the environment and production of one or more plant hormones.|$|E
2500|$|An {{example of}} {{interaction}} (as {{distinct from the}} sum of the components) involves familiarity from childhood. [...] In a number of species, individuals prefer to associate with familiar individuals but prefer to mate with unfamiliar ones (Alcock 2001:85–89, Incest taboo, Incest). [...] By inference, genes affecting living together interact with the environment differently from genes affecting mating behaviour. [...] A homely example of interaction involves plants: Some plants grow toward the light (<b>phototropism)</b> and some away from gravity (gravitropism).|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to growth by cell division, a plant may grow through cell elongation. This occurs when individual cells {{or groups of}} cells grow longer. Not all plant cells will grow to the same length. [...] When cells {{on one side of}} a stem grow longer and faster than cells on the other side, the stem will bend {{to the side of the}} slower growing cells as a result. This directional growth can occur via a plant's response to a particular stimulus, such as light (<b>phototropism),</b> gravity (gravitropism), water, (hydrotropism), and physical contact (thigmotropism).|$|E
2500|$|Plant ABCB {{transporters}} {{have shown}} {{to transport the}} phytohormone indole-3-acetic acid ( [...] IAA), also known as auxin, the essential regulator for plant growth and development. The directional polar transport of auxin mediates plant environmental responses through processes such as <b>phototropism</b> and gravitropism. Two of the best studied auxin transporters, ABCB1 and ABCB19, have been characterized to be primary auxin exporters Other ABCB transporters such as ABCB4 participate in both the export and import of auxin At low intracellular auxin concentrations ABCB4 imports auxin until it reaches a certain threshold which then reverses function to only export auxin.|$|E
50|$|<b>Phototropism</b> is {{the growth}} of an {{organism}} which responds to a light stimulus. It is most often observed in plants, but can also occur in other organisms such as fungi. The cells on the plant that are farthest from the light have a chemical called auxin that reacts when <b>phototropism</b> occurs. This causes the plant to have elongated cells on the farthest side from the light. <b>Phototropism</b> {{is one of the}} many plant tropisms or movements which respond to external stimuli. Growth towards a light source is called positive <b>phototropism,</b> while growth away from light is called negative <b>phototropism</b> (skototropism). Most plant shoots exhibit positive <b>phototropism,</b> and rearrange their chloroplasts in the leaves to maximize photosynthetic energy and promote growth. Roots usually exhibit negative <b>phototropism,</b> although gravitropism may play a larger role in root behavior and growth. Some vine shoot tips exhibit negative <b>phototropism,</b> which allows them to grow towards dark, solid objects and climb them. The combination of <b>phototropism</b> and gravitropism allow plants to grow in the correct direction.|$|E

50|$|There {{are blue}} light {{photoreceptor}}s {{that are not}} a part of photomorphogenesis. For example, phototropin is the blue light photoreceptor that controls <b>phototropism.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Phototropism</b> {{in plants}} such as Arabidopsis thaliana is {{directed}} by blue light receptors called phototropins. Other photosensitive receptors in plants include phytochromes that sense red light and cryptochromes that sense blue light. Different organs of the plant may exhibit different phototropic reactions to different wavelengths of light. Stem tips exhibit positive phototropic reactions to blue light, while root tips exhibit negative phototropic reactions to blue light. Both root tips and most stem tips exhibit positive <b>phototropism</b> to red light.Cryptochromes are photoreceptors that absorb blue/ UV-A light, and they help control the circadian rhythm in plants and timing of flowering. Phytochromes are photoreceptors that sense red/far-red light, but they also absorb blue light. The combination of responses from phytochromes and cryptochromes allow the plant to respond to various kinds of light. Together phytochromes and cryptochromes inhibit gravitropism in hypocotyls and contribute to <b>phototropism.</b>|$|E

50|$|Arabidopsis thaliana seeds, (thale cress, {{the genome}} {{of which has}} been DNA sequenced as a {{reference}} organism for the study of plant biology and genetics), were germinated and grown under various lighting and gravity conditions, using centrifugal gravity-simulation and LEDs of various wavelengths (colors) and intensities to model lighting conditions. The specific aim of this project was to investigate <b>phototropism</b> in plants grown in microgravity conditions without the complications of a 1-g environment. Experiments performed were used to explore the mechanisms of both blue-light- and red-light-induced <b>phototropism</b> in plants.|$|E
50|$|In plants, cryptochromes mediate <b>phototropism,</b> or {{directional}} growth toward a light source, {{in response to}} blue light. This response is now known {{to have its own}} set of photoreceptors, the phototropins.|$|E
50|$|Phycomyces is a genus of fungus in the Zygomycota phylum. They {{are known}} for their strong <b>phototropism</b> {{response}} and helical growth of the sporangium. The best studied species is Phycomyces blakesleeanus.|$|E
50|$|Similar {{mechanisms}} {{are working in}} other tropic responses, such as <b>phototropism.</b> The mechanisms were first described by the Cholodny-Went model, proposed in the 1920s by N. Cholodny and Frits Warmolt Went.|$|E
50|$|Early {{experiments}} on <b>phototropism</b> using coleoptiles suggested that plants grow towards light because plant cells on {{the darker side}} elongate more than those on the lighter side. In 1880 Charles Darwin and his son, Francis found that coleoptiles only bend towards the light when their tips are exposed. Therefore, the tips must contain the photoreceptor cells although the bending takes place lower down on the shoot. A chemical messenger or hormone called auxin moves down {{the dark side of}} the shoot and stimulates growth on that side. The natural plant hormone responsible for <b>phototropism</b> is now known to be indoleacetic acid (IAA).|$|E
50|$|These crustaceans, {{which have}} for {{distinctive}} feature swimming on their backs, come under zooplankton. They move thanks to swinging moves of the appendixes of the rib cage. Their swimming position seems {{to derive from}} a positive <b>phototropism.</b>|$|E

50|$|<b>Phototropism</b> is {{the effect}} of light on plant growth that causes the plant to grow toward or away from the light. Photoperiodism is a plant’s {{response}} or capacity to respond to photoperiod, a recurring cycle of light and dark periods of constant length.|$|E
