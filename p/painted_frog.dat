25|$|The {{critically}} endangered Hula <b>painted</b> <b>frog</b> (Latonia nigriventer) {{is found}} in the Hula Valley and was endemic to the lake that used to fill the valley. The lake was drained in the 1950s to combat malaria and create more farmland, but the draining of the lake led to the destruction of its unique ecosystem. The frog was declared extinct by the IUCN in 1996. In the 1990s, {{the southern part of the}} valley was flooded again, and in 2011 the Hula <b>painted</b> <b>frog</b> was rediscovered. The frog has since been reclassified as critically endangered.|$|E
25|$|The {{number of}} {{amphibians}} in Israel has decreased dramatically {{since the last}} century mainly due to the drying of various swamps and wetlands by early settlers. The Hula <b>painted</b> <b>frog</b> {{was thought to be}} extinct until a female specimen was found in November 2011. Environmental improvements in the Hula reserve have been cited as a possible reason for the frog's re-emergence.|$|E

40|$|Latonia nigriventerMediterranean <b>painted</b> <b>frogs</b> (genus Discoglossus Otth, 1837) are {{distributed}} across western Europe, North Africa and some Mediterranean islands. Previous {{studies have focused}} on their phylogenetic relationships, but the taxonomic position of the Iberian taxa (D. galganoi and D. jeanneae) is still under debate. By using microsatellites, patterns and rates of admixture can be quantified. We report the characterisation of eighteen novel polymorphic microsatellite loci in Iberian <b>painted</b> <b>frogs.</b> These loci were also tested in all other species of Discoglossus and in the recently rediscovered and highly endangered relative Latonia nigriventer. Two to eleven loci amplified in these species, and the number of polymorphic loci ranged from zero (in Latonia) to eight (in D. scovazzi). The new markers will be useful in addressing questions related to the evolutionary history, population structure, and conservation of Iberian Discoglossus. They also have potential for use in the North African species D. scovazzi and D. pictus, the latter of which is an invasive species rapidly expanding its range in southeast France and northeast Spain.
