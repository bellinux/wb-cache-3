5|$|In {{reviews of}} the Amstrad release, Amtix noted the colour {{additions}} over the monochromatic original and wrote that Knight Lore was among the Amstrad's best adventures.

Kameo core gameplay concept brought his anticipation to <b>par</b> <b>with</b> that customary for The Legend of Zelda titles, and he thought the game would reap the benefits of its long development through refined audiovisuals. Xbox executive Peter Moore announced Kameo as his favorite launch title in anticipation of the Xbox 360's launch.|$|E
5|$|Arkham Origins was {{considered}} an incremental installment for the series, rather than a transformative one. GameSpot said that Arkham City expanded on Arkham Asylum by applying the game mechanics to a larger open-world setting, but criticized Arkham Origins for replicating Arkham City without moving the series forward. Other critics agreed, saying that the game's well-received elements from the previous game were not significantly developed or augmented and it was routine rather than inspired. However, other reviewers rated it on a <b>par</b> <b>with</b> Arkham City.|$|E
