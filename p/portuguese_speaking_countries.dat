25|$|All {{nations in}} North and South America have populations of {{indigenous}} peoples within their borders. In some countries (particularly Latin American), indigenous peoples form a sizable component of the overall national population—in Bolivia they account for an estimated 56–70% of the total nation, and {{at least half of}} the population in Guatemala and the Andean and Amazonian nations of Peru. In English, indigenous peoples are collectively referred to by different names that vary by region and include such ethnonyms as Native Americans, Amerindians, and American Indians. In Spanish or <b>Portuguese</b> <b>speaking</b> <b>countries</b> one finds the use of terms such as pueblos , amerindios, povos nativos, povos indígenas, and in Peru, Comunidades Nativas (Native Communities), particularly among Amazonian societies like the Urarina and Matsés.

The incidence rates of malaria, estimated for the period 1993 - 2002, respectively for Portugal and its Northern Region, were 0, 74 and 0, 45 per 100, 000 persons-year. Incidence was stable across the studied period. Most cases were males aged 15 to 64. Most cases with laboratory confirmation were due to Plasmodium falciparum.

Each particular meaning may be considered complementary to another for a closer understanding of what the English term means, for there is no single Brazilian Portuguese word which would translate the complexity of the word design in a precise and succinct way. This is perhaps the main reason why the English word design is largely adopted in Brazil...|$|R

The companies operating in the sector are pressured by demanding clients and an increasing flow of goods. It is not only difficult {{to keep up with}} the whole scenario of a changing industry but it gets harder when a SME has to internationalize to a strategic and complex country. Pinto Basto (PB) is one example operating in that industry and struggling with all the difficulties that SME have. Moreover, the company decided at some point to expand to Angola, a <b>Portuguese</b> <b>speaking</b> <b>country.</b> This internationalization could seem easy and clean as the cultures are not that different, but along the way, the company dealt with serious difficulties in the market. After all, Angola is an under developed country and there is still a lack of stability for SME´s to prosper. Mr. Carvalho-Neto is called into the company with the objective of turnaround the increasing losses that the Angolan subsidiary was having. The complexities of the market lead the new executive director to make a strategic decision of the way that the company should heading. Integrated logistic services were the answer to some of the problems. He came up with two solutions to enter that new business that they needed to implement in order to integrate the services. The board would surely agree with the most traditional and risk averse, a local partnership. However, Mr. Carvalho- Neto was pushing to a more bolt and risky idea, the creation of a new company. Pinto Basto was depending on the decision and, due to the particularities of African markets, either one could lead to a fatal destiny for the company.
