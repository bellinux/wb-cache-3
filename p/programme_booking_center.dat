40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of three different essays, {{all of which have}} arisen from a practical problem. In the first essay, “Technical efficiency and ownership: The case of <b>booking</b> <b>centers</b> in the Swedish Taxi Market” the purpose is to examine the question of competition on an equal basis between privately and publicly owned <b>booking</b> <b>centers</b> in the Swedish taxi market. One way to answer this question is to study technical efficiency, and decomposing technical efficiency into managerial and organizational efficiency. In the empirical investigation, no evidence was found of a relation between amount of technical efficiency and ownership type. The result of the Mann-Whitney test indicates that there is no statistically significant difference in technical efficiency between the privately owned and the publicly owned <b>booking</b> <b>centers.</b> In the second essay, “Identification of References: An Explorative Approach” the focus is on implementing the result from a efficiency study in the investigated industry, by providing inefficient units with information on relevant reference units. The aim of the study is to provide guidelines on which properties one can expect of a reference unit, and on methods for detecting reference units for an inefficient unit. Relevant reference units make it possible for inefficient units to, on site, study production that is more efficient than its own. This makes it possible to adopt more efficient ways to organize production. In the study, we argue that to be a relevant reference unit the unit has to be the existing and efficient unit that are most similar, indicated by the Euclidian distance, to the inefficient unit. To identify reference units, three methods are explored: Dominance, non-zero Intensity variables and the Sphere. Strengths and weaknesses of each method are explored in the study. In the third essay, “The Effect of Omitted Variables on Optimal Scale: An Application on Swedish Employment Offices”, we investigate the effects of omitting/adding variables on both the source of scale inefficiency and on the input-output size of scale efficient units. Both a non-parametric and a parametric distance function approach are used to compute measures of scale efficiency and scale elasticity respectively. This information is used to classify units in one of the following groups; scale efficient, scale inefficiency due to increasing returns to scale and, finally, scale inefficiency due to decreasing returns to scale. We then investigate if, as an effect of omitting/adding variables, changes exist between these groups and changes within the group of scale efficient units, with respect to input and output size. Changes between the groups imply that policy recommendations, concerning means to reducing inefficiency, change. Changes within the scale efficient group, with respect to input and output size, imply a change in the optimal scale of production. In the empirical application, we show that omission of variables will influence the source of scale inefficiency. In general, when the two quality indicators are omitted, scale inefficiency is to a larger extent explained by increasing returns to scale. Further, we show that optimal scale is larger, if the quality indicators are omitted...|$|R

2500|$|Concerns {{about the}} {{viability}} of the convention center headquarters hotel occurred again in 2007. Convention hotel room bookings in Washington, D.C., fell 13 percent in 2006 and were estimated to fall another 24 percent in 2007 and 29 percent in 2008, bringing into question the need for a headquarters hotel. In Baltimore, Maryland, a convention center headquarters hotel approved in 2006 failed to boost convention bookings. Furthermore, Gaylord Entertainment Company was constructing a 2,000-room hotel and meeting complex at its Gaylord National Resort & Convention Center in Prince George's County, Maryland, just across the city line. The Gaylord complex, the Washington Post said, was likely to draw business away from the proposed D.C. convention headquarters hotel.

40|$|On May 28, 2013, Torrey Johnson 5 {{struggles to}} raise both his hands, handcuffed and seated shoulder-to-shoulder between two other {{defendants}} {{in the first}} row of the closed circuit television (“CCTV” or “videoconference”) bail review hearing room within the Baltimore Central <b>Booking</b> and Intake <b>Center</b> (“Centeral Booking”). There are two more rows of defendants behind Mr. Johnson, all in yellow jumpsuits, being watched by correctional officers. Separated by a three-foot wall, Mr. Johnson’s public defender sits out of sight from the video camera’s field of view, about ten feet away from her client. The judge quickly reads through Mr. Johnson’s rights. A representative from the Pretrial Release Services Program (“Pretrial Release”) makes a recommendation that is broadcasted meekly from the courtroom. As the judge looks down at his desk to take notes, Mr. Johnson looks down and shakes his head. He disagrees with something the Pretrial Services representative said, and starts to speak. No one seems to hear Mr. Johnson 2 ̆ 7 s voice in his own bail review hearing. Mr. Johnson’s experience demonstrates the constitutional violations that many indigent defendants in Baltimore City disproportionately face as Maryland conducts bail review hearings on a television screen, not in person. Speed and convenience are the driving factors behind the state’s decision to hold bail hearings through videoconference systems. Mr. Johnson’s case {{is an example of the}} procedural problems raised when CCTV is used in bail review hearings, both in district and circuit courts. ...|$|R

40|$|Environmental impacts {{are caused}} the by {{consumption}} {{of material and}} energy or the release of emissions. They can be reduced by optimizing corporate material and energy flows based {{on the principles of}} eco-efficiency management. The basis for this is a higher transparency on corporate material flows. It can be reached by setting up an environmental controlling. The most practicable instrument within environmental controlling is the application of Environmental Performance Indicators (EPI). They can be used to efficiently monitor and control material and energy efficiently on a continuous basis. In the presented dissertation, a procedure model is described for the introduction of an integrative environmental controlling and the development of the required information supply using an Enterprise Resource Planning System (ERP System). The development of the EPI system’s information supply uses the ERP System as an information source and as a basis to implement the IT support of the EPI system. The material master data in the ERP System is enhanced by an EPI key. <b>Booking</b> locations (cost <b>center</b> groups, cost centers or storage locations) are attributed to EPIs. Existing material bookings are classified according to their movement type and are attributed to the respective EPIs with booking rules. The material bookings goods receipt/good issue, confirmed production order, overhead order, capital spending order, and inventory difference adjustment are used. Information not available in the ERP System is identified in other information systems and imported into the ERP System. Additional data required is acquired separately. Finally, an IT support for the EPI system is implemented using functionalities in the ERP System to administrate corporate performance indicators. The practical implementation of the procedure model is described based on its application with two industrial companies. In both cases, the ERP System SAP R/ 3 by SAP AG was used. It was shown that the developed EPI System supplies structured information on corporate material flows and increases the transparency on material and enegry flows in the company. Thus, a basis for the systematic reduction of material and energy consumption and the emission of pollutants was created. The achieved solution also serves to give account to stakeholders customers, shareholders, employees and public authorities. Internal reports (to inform cost center responsibles or employees) as well as external reports (e. g. on CO 2 or VOC emissions or on the consumption of substances containing heavy metals) can be generated more easily...|$|R
40|$|In late 1971, several entirely forgettable {{messages}} were sent between two machines (today {{we would call}} them computers, but the word machines more accurately reflects their size at that time) located {{only a few feet}} from each other. 1 Like the first telephones and televisions, e-mail would soon grow in popularity, astonishing even the most optimistic proponents of the new technology. The rudimentary origins of a new medium often belie the substantial shift in perspective and practice afforded to subsequent researchers and users. Educators who have experimented with using technologies in classrooms will likely recall the domino of possibility effect of providing a web page with reading materials. Access creates possibilities, which in turn shape students expectations. The course web page developed into learning management systems, which have since morphed into increasingly decentralized, distributed, and modular teaching tools. The plethora of tools blogs, wikis, podcasts, social bookmarking, Skype, Twitter, Facebookâ€”can be intimidating. But for many educators, these tools form the basis of new approaches to, and means of, interacting with students, each other, and information. Having gained prominence in geek culture, e-mail and social tools have moved into classrooms, corporate training programs, and more recently, spaces of academic dialogue including journals, books, and our focus hereâ€”conferences. 2 Conferences are designed to meet the ongoing educational and training needs of professionals. A secondary and, some would argue, primary function is to facilitate networking, informal learning, and socialization among professionals. Conferences are short-term (time-bounded), in contrast to ongoing work programs or distributed mailing lists. They are often paid for by the employers of professionals, with the expectation that both the formal and the informal sessions will enhance the professionals performance in the workplace. Conferences are accessible (usually for a fee) to all members of the profession and often to the general public as well. Conferences are also expensive. Attending face-to-face conferences is costly {{not only because of the}} high and increasing price of hotels, transportation, conference <b>center</b> <b>bookings,</b> and meals but also because of the disruption and opportunity costs when professionals are not performing their normal work. The high ecological footprint of air travel can also be added to the expenses associated with face-to-face conferences. Finally, the personal cost of time away from family and community must be included to calculate the true costs of attending and also organizing this form of professional development. These high and increasing conference costs are intersecting with the enhanced interaction, the shift in perspective, and the greater opportunities offered by the new social technologies. Anyone can now create and distribute content/information with free online tools. In field after field, the barriers of participation in global conversations have fallen: radio is giving way to podcasts, newspapers to online journalism, and geographical relationships to online social networking. So too are conferences being remade, with the decline in barriers and the addition of technology influencing not only how attendees participate but also how organizers host conferences today...|$|R
