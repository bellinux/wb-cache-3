When stimulated by acetylcholine, this causes constriction of the smooth muscle lining the bronchus and bronchioles, {{and increases the}} secretions from glands. The lungs also have a sympathetic tone from norepinephrine acting on the beta 2 receptors in the respiratory tract, which causes bronchodilation.|$|E
5|$|There are two {{approaches}} to treating Chagas disease: antiparasitic treatment, {{to kill the}} parasite; and symptomatic treatment, to manage the symptoms and signs of the infection. Management uniquely involves addressing selective incremental failure of the <b>parasympathetic</b> <b>nervous</b> <b>system.</b> Autonomic disease imparted by Chagas may eventually result in megaesophagus, megacolon and accelerated dilated cardiomyopathy. The mechanisms that explain why Chagas targets the parasympathetic autonomic nervous system and spares the sympathetic autonomic nervous system remain poorly understood.|$|E
5|$|The heart {{receives}} nerve {{signals from}} the vagus nerve and from nerves arising from the sympathetic trunk. These nerves act to influence, but not control, the heart rate. Sympathetic nerves also influence the force of heart contraction. Signals that travel along these nerves arise from two paired cardiovascular centres in the medulla oblongata. The vagus nerve of the <b>parasympathetic</b> <b>nervous</b> <b>system</b> acts to decrease the heart rate, and nerves from the sympathetic trunk act to increase the heart rate. These nerves form a network of nerves that lies over the heart called the cardiac plexus.|$|E

5|$|The {{composition}} {{and rate of}} CSF generation are influenced by hormones and the content and pressure of blood and CSF. For example, when CSF pressure is higher, there {{is less of a}} pressure difference between the capillary blood in choroid plexuses and the CSF, decreasing the rate at which fluids move into the choroid plexus and CSF generation. The autonomic nervous system influences choroid plexus CSF secretion, with activation of the sympathetic nervous system increasing secretion and the <b>parasympathetic</b> <b>nervous</b> <b>system</b> decreasing it. Changes in the pH of the blood can affect the activity of carbonic anhydrase, and some drugs (such as frusemide, acting on the Na-K-Cl cotransporter) have the potential to impact membrane channels.|$|E
5|$|The {{peripheral}} nerves of the <b>parasympathetic</b> <b>nervous</b> <b>system</b> {{that carry}} {{messages to the}} brain (afferent nerve fibers) may explain why people with complete SCI feel sexual and climactic sensations. One proposed explanation for orgasm in women despite complete SCI is that the vagus nerve bypasses the spinal cord and carries sensory information from the genitals directly to the brain. Women with complete injuries can achieve sexual arousal and orgasm through stimulation of the clitoris, cervix, or vagina, which are each innervated by different nerve pathways, which suggests that even if SCI interferes with one area, function might be preserved in others. In both injured and uninjured people, the brain {{is responsible for the}} way sensations of climax are perceived: the qualitative experiences associated with climax are modulated by the brain, rather than a specific area of the body.|$|E

25|$|Counterintuitively, penile erections {{during sleep}} are not more {{frequent}} during sexual dreams than during other dreams. The <b>parasympathetic</b> <b>nervous</b> <b>system</b> experiences increased activity during REM sleep which may cause erection of the penis or clitoris. In males, 80% to 95% of REM sleep is normally accompanied by partial to full penile erection, while only about 12% of men's dreams contain sexual content.|$|E
25|$|When Q {{increases}} {{in a healthy}} but untrained individual, most of the increase {{can be attributed to}} an increase in heart rate (HR). Change of posture, increased sympathetic nervous system activity, and decreased <b>parasympathetic</b> <b>nervous</b> <b>system</b> activity can also increase cardiac output. HR can vary by a factor of approximately 3—between 60 and 180 beats per minute—while stroke volume (SV) can vary between , a factor of only 1.7.|$|E

50|$|Metabolic typing was {{introduced}} by William Donald Kelley, a dentist, in the 1960s. Kelley advocated basing dietary choices on the activity of one's sympathetic and <b>parasympathetic</b> <b>nervous</b> <b>systems.</b> In 1970, Kelley was convicted of practicing medicine without a license, as he had diagnosed a patient with lung cancer based on a fingerstick blood test and prescribed nutritional therapy. He continued to promote a metabolic typing diet through the 1980s. The practice has been further developed by others including Dr.Harold J. Kristal and William Wolcott.|$|R
50|$|The first {{published}} case of paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity was Wilder Penfield's case {{report of a}} 41-year-old woman, JH, published in 1929. She had a third ventricle cholesteatoma. She displayed increased respiration, increased heart rate, diaphoresis, and increased blood pressure. She also displayed minor symptoms: pupillary dilation, hiccups, and lacrimation. At the time, her episodes were termed 'diencephalic autonomic epilepsy'. It was believed that both her sympathetic and <b>parasympathetic</b> <b>nervous</b> <b>systems</b> were showing overactivity. The future may hold non-pharmacologic solutions such as renal sympathetic denervation.|$|R

25|$|The {{kidney and}} nervous system {{communicate}} via the renal plexus, whose fibers course along the renal arteries to reach each kidney.

The kidney also receives input from the <b>parasympathetic</b> <b>nervous</b> <b>system,</b> {{by way of the}} renal branches of the vagus nerve; the function of this is yet unclear. Sensory input from the kidney travels to the T10-11 levels of the spinal cord and is sensed in the corresponding dermatome. Thus, pain in the flank region may be referred from corresponding kidney.|$|E
25|$|Cardiac arrhythmias are {{a common}} {{characteristic}} of the human diving response. As part of the diving reflex, increased activity of the cardiac <b>parasympathetic</b> <b>nervous</b> <b>system</b> not only regulates the bradycardia, but also is associated with ectopic beats which are characteristic of human heart function during breath-hold dives. Arrhythmias may be accentuated by neural responses to face immersion in cold water, distension of the heart due to central blood shift, and the increasing resistance to left ventricular ejection (afterload) by rising blood pressure. Arrhythmias commonly measured in the electrocardiogram during human breath-hold dives include ST depression, heightened T wave, and a positive U wave following the QRS complex, measurements associated with reduced left ventricular contractility and overall depressed cardiac function during a dive.|$|E
50|$|The female {{spotted hyena}} {{has a unique}} urinary-genital system, closely {{resembling}} the penis of the male, called a pseudo-penis. The family structure is matriarchal and dominance relationships with strong sexual elements are routinely observed between related females. They are notable for using visible sexual arousal {{as a sign of}} submission but not dominance in males as well as females (females have a sizable erectile clitoris). It is speculated that to facilitate this, their sympathetic and <b>parasympathetic</b> <b>nervous</b> <b>systems</b> may be partially reversed in respect to their reproductive organs.|$|R

[...] Chronic stress has been widely studied on its effects of the body resulting in an elevated heart rate (HR), reduced HR variability, elevated sympathetic tone, and intensified cardiovascular activity. [...] Consequently, stress promotes an autonomic imbalance {{in favor of the}} sympathetic <b>nervous</b> <b>system.</b> [...] The activation of the sympathetic <b>nervous</b> <b>system</b> contributes to endothelial dysfunction, hypertension, atherosclerosis, insulin resistance, and increased incidence of arrhythmias.

25|$|The {{detrusor}} {{muscle is}} {{a layer of}} the urinary bladder wall made of smooth muscle fibers arranged in spiral, longitudinal, and circular bundles. Stretch receptors in the bladder signal the <b>parasympathetic</b> <b>nervous</b> <b>system</b> to stimulate the muscarinic receptors in the detrusor to contract the muscle when the bladder is extended. This encourages the bladder to expel urine through the urethra. The main receptor activated is the M3 receptor, although M2 receptors are also involved and whilst outnumbering the M3 receptors they are not so responsive. The main relaxant pathway is via the adenylyl cyclase cAMP pathway, activated by β2 adrenergic receptors. The detrusor muscle is unusually able to change its length. It can also contract {{for a long time}} whilst voiding, and it stays relaxed whilst the bladder is filling.|$|E
500|$|Everyone has {{a natural}} set point {{for their ability}} to {{experience}} stress. For some people, this is a very high threshold, whereas other people can become overwhelmed very quickly. [...] Emotional pain activates the same regions of the brain as physical pain, so this can be a significantly intolerable state for some people. Some of this is environmental and some of this is due to physiological differences in responding. The autonomic nervous system is composed of two components: the sympathetic nervous system controls arousal and physical activation (e.g., the fight-or-flight response) and the <b>parasympathetic</b> <b>nervous</b> <b>system</b> controls physical processes that are automatic (e.g., saliva production). The sympathetic nervous system innervates (e.g., is physically connected to and regulates) many parts of the body involved in stress responses. Studies of adolescents have shown that adolescents who self-injure have greater physiological reactivity (e.g., skin conductance) to stress than adolescents who do not self-injure. This stress response persists over time, staying constant or even increasing in self-injuring adolescents, but gradually decreases in adolescents who do not self-injure.|$|E
500|$|The reflexogenic pathway {{activates}} the <b>parasympathetic</b> <b>nervous</b> <b>system</b> {{in response}} to the sensation of touch. It is mediated by a reflex arc that goes to the spinal cord (not to the brain) and is served by the sacral segments of the spinal cord at S2–S4. A woman with a spinal cord lesion above T11 {{may not be able to}} experience psychogenic vaginal lubrication, but may still have reflex lubrication if her sacral segments are uninjured. Likewise, although a man's ability to get a psychogenic erection when mentally aroused may be impaired after a higher-level SCI, he may still be able to get a reflex or [...] "spontaneous" [...] erection. These erections may result in the absence of psychological arousal when the penis is touched or brushed, e.g. by clothing, but they do not last long and are generally lost when the stimulus is removed. Reflex erections may increase in frequency after SCI, due to the loss of inhibitory input from the brain that would suppress the response in an uninjured man. Conversely, an injury below the S1 level impairs reflex erections but not psychogenic erections. People who have some preservation of sensation in the dermatomes at the S4 and S5 levels and display a bulbocavernosus reflex (contraction of the pelvic floor {{in response to}} pressure on the clitoris or glans penis) are usually able to experience reflex erections or lubrication. Like other reflexes, reflexive sexual responses may be lost immediately after injury but return over time as the individual recovers from spinal shock.|$|E
40|$|Digitalis {{produces}} many of {{its effects}} in intact animals and human beings by modifying {{the properties of the}} autonomic <b>nervous</b> <b>system.</b> The <b>parasympathetic</b> limb of the autonomic <b>nervous</b> <b>system</b> is most sensitive to these effects of digitalis, and its properties are significantly altered with therapeutic concentrations of the drug.

5|$|Blood {{pressure}} {{and heart rate}} {{are influenced by the}} vasomotor centre of the medulla, which causes arteries and veins to be somewhat constricted at rest. It does this by influencing the sympathetic and <b>parasympathetic</b> <b>nervous</b> <b>systems</b> via the vagus nerve. Information about blood pressure is generated by baroreceptors in aortic bodies in the aortic arch, and passed to the brain along the afferent fibres of the vagus nerve. Information about the pressure changes in the carotid sinus comes from carotid bodies located near the carotid artery and this is passed via a nerve joining with the glossopharyngeal nerve. This information travels up to the solitary nucleus in the medulla. Signals from here influence the vasomotor centre to adjust vein and artery constriction accordingly.|$|R
