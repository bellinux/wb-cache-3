5|$|The heart {{functions}} as a pump in the circulatory system to provide a continuous flow of blood throughout the body. This circulation consists of the systemic circulation {{to and from the}} body and the <b>pulmonary</b> <b>circulation</b> to and from the lungs. Blood in the <b>pulmonary</b> <b>circulation</b> exchanges carbon dioxide for oxygen in the lungs through the process of respiration. The systemic circulation then transports oxygen to the body and returns carbon dioxide and relatively deoxygenated blood to the heart for transfer to the lungs.|$|E
5|$|The {{effects of}} {{methoxyflurane}} on the circulatory system {{resemble those of}} diethyl ether. In dogs, methoxyflurane anesthesia causes a moderate decrease in blood pressure with minimal changes in heart rate, and no significant effect on blood sugar, epinephrine, or norepinephrine. Bleeding and increased arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) both induce further decreases in blood pressure, as well as increases in blood glucose, epinephrine and norepinephrine. In humans, methoxyflurane produces some decrease in blood pressure, but cardiac output, stroke volume, and total peripheral resistance are only minimally depressed. Its effect on the <b>pulmonary</b> <b>circulation</b> is negligible, {{and it does not}} predispose the heart to cardiac dysrhythmias.|$|E
5|$|The heart pumps blood with {{a rhythm}} {{determined}} {{by a group of}} pacemaking cells in the sinoatrial node. These generate a current that causes contraction of the heart, traveling through the atrioventricular node and along the conduction system of the heart. The heart receives blood low in oxygen from the systemic circulation, which enters the right atrium from the superior and inferior venae cavae and passes to the right ventricle. From here it is pumped into the <b>pulmonary</b> <b>circulation,</b> through the lungs where it receives oxygen and gives off carbon dioxide. Oxygenated blood then returns to the left atrium, passes through the left ventricle and is pumped out through the aorta to the systemic circulation−where the oxygen is used and metabolized to carbon dioxide. The heart beats at a resting rate close to 72 beats per minute. Exercise temporarily increases the rate, but lowers resting heart rate in the long term, and is good for heart health.|$|E

40|$|AbstractObjectiveThe optimal pH {{strategy}} during hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass remains controversial. Systemic <b>pulmonary</b> collateral <b>circulation</b> {{may develop}} {{in patients with}} cyanotic anomalies. The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate the effect of pH strategies on cerebral oxygenation and systemic <b>pulmonary</b> collateral <b>circulation</b> during hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass in cyanotic patients with heart disease. MethodsForty cyanotic patients (age > 1 year) with heart disease were prospectively randomized into 2 groups. Group 1 (n = 19, 14. 3 ± 1. 5 kg) underwent hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass with alpha-stat strategy and group 2 (n = 21, 12. 5 ± 0. 9 kg) with pH-stat. Cardiopulmonary bypass was established with pump-assisted drainage. Cerebral oxygenation was assessed by near-infrared spectroscopy and the systemic <b>pulmonary</b> collateral <b>circulation</b> was calculated by pump flows [% systemic <b>pulmonary</b> collateral <b>circulation</b> = perfusion flow − drainage flow) /perfusion flow × 100]. Lactate was measured as an index of systemic anaerobic metabolism. ResultsThere were no significant differences in preoperative hematocrit, oxygen saturation, Qp/Qs, cardiopulmonary bypass duration, minimum temperatures, perfusion flow and pressure, urine output, and depth of anesthesia between the groups. Oxyhemoglobin signal and tissue oxygenation index of near-infrared spectroscopy monitoring were significantly lower in group 1 compared with group 2 (P =. 008 and P <. 0001, respectively), suggesting inadequate cerebral oxygenation with alpha-stat. Deoxygenated hemoglobin signal was significantly higher in group 1 relative to group 2 (P <. 0001). The % systemic <b>pulmonary</b> collateral <b>circulation</b> was significantly lower in group 2 compared with group 1, suggesting a reduced <b>pulmonary</b> collateral <b>circulation</b> with pH-stat (P <. 0001, average; group 1, 20. 1 % ± 1. 2 %; group 2; 7. 7 % ± 0. 7 %). Serum lactate was significantly lower in group 2 (P <. 0001). ConclusionsThe pH-stat strategy results in an improved environment, including sufficient cerebral oxygenation, decreased systemic <b>pulmonary</b> collateral <b>circulation,</b> and lower lactate level during hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass in cyanotic patients with heart disease. Future studies should investigate the long-term neurological outcome...|$|R
25|$|Bradykinin {{is rapidly}} inactivated in the {{circulating}} blood, and it disappears completely {{in a single}} pass through the <b>pulmonary</b> <b>circulation.</b> Angiotensin I also disappears in the <b>pulmonary</b> <b>circulation</b> because of its conversion to angiotensin II.

The inactivation of bradykinin and the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II in the lungs was thought to be caused by the same enzyme.

25|$|There is {{some debate}} {{about whether or not}} Ibn al-Nafis participated in {{dissection}} to come to his conclusions about <b>pulmonary</b> <b>circulation.</b> Although he states in his writings that he was prevented from practicing dissection because of his beliefs, other scholars have noted that al-Nafis must have either practiced dissection or seen a human heart in order to come to his conclusions. According to one view, his knowledge about the human heart could have been derived from surgical operations rather than dissection. Other comments found in al-Nafis’s writings such as dismissing earlier observations with a reference to dissection as proof, however, support the view that he practiced dissection in order to come to his conclusions about the human heart and <b>pulmonary</b> <b>circulation.</b> Ibn al-Nafis’s comments to the contrary and the alternate explanations, however, keep his possible practice of dissection in question.|$|E

25|$|Bubbles {{which are}} carried {{back to the}} heart in the veins will pass into {{the right side of}} the heart, and from there they will {{normally}} enter the <b>pulmonary</b> <b>circulation</b> and pass through or be trapped in the capillaries of the lungs, which are around the alveoli and very near to the respiratory gas, where the gas will diffuse from the bubbles though the capillary and alveolar walls into the gas in the lung. If the number of lung capillaries blocked by these bubbles is relatively small, the diver will not display symptoms, and no tissue will be damaged (lung tissues are adequately oxygenated by diffusion). The bubbles which are small enough to pass through the lung capillaries may be small enough to be dissolved due to a combination of surface tension and diffusion to a lowered concentration in the surrounding blood, though the Varying Permeability Model nucleation theory implies that most bubbles passing through the <b>pulmonary</b> <b>circulation</b> will lose enough gas to pass through the capillaries and return to the systemic circulation as recycled but stable nuclei.

In the Fontan circulation, maintaining an adequate transpulmonary gradient is essential for preserving both pulmonary blood flow and cardiac output [3]. However, an adequate preload and low pulmonary vascular resistance that are required to maintain the transpulmonary gradient can be jeopardized under general anesthesia because of anesthetics and positive pressure ventilation.|$|R

25|$|Servetus was {{the first}} European to {{describe}} the function of <b>pulmonary</b> <b>circulation,</b> although his achievement was not widely recognized at the time, for a few reasons. One was that the description appeared in a theological treatise, Christianismi Restitutio, not in a book on medicine. However, the sections in which he refers to anatomy and medicines demonstrate an amazing understanding {{of the body and}} treatments. Most copies of the book were burned shortly after its publication in 1553 because of persecution of Servetus by religious authorities. Three copies survived, but these remained hidden for decades. In passage V, Servetus recounts his discovery that the blood of the <b>pulmonary</b> <b>circulation</b> flows from the heart to the lungs (rather than air in the lungs flowing to the heart as had been thought). His discovery was based on the colour of the blood, the size and location of the different ventricles, {{and the fact that the}} pulmonary vein was extremely large, which suggested that it performed intensive and transcendent exchange. However, Servetus does not only deal with cardiology. In the same passage, from page 169 to 178, he also refers to the brain, the cerebellum, the meninges, the nerves, the eye, the tympanum, the rete mirabile, etc., demonstrating a great knowledge of anatomy. In some other sections of this work he also talks of medical products.|$|E

A strong emphasis on experimentation and empiricism led to new results and new observations, which were contrasted and combined with those of Galen by writers such as Rhazes, Ali ibn Abbas al-Majusi (Haly Abbas), Abu al-Qasim al-Zahrawi (Abulasis), Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Ibn Zuhr and Ibn al-Nafis.

25|$|The {{first step}} in the {{development}} of ACE inhibitors was the discovery of ACE in plasma by Leonard T. Skeggs and his colleagues in 1956. Brazilian scientist Sérgio Henrique Ferreira reported a bradykinin-potentiating factor (BPF) present in the venom of Bothrops jararaca, a South American pit viper, in 1965. Ferreira then went to John Vane's laboratory as a postdoctoral fellow with his already-isolated BPF. The conversion of the inactive angiotensin I to the potent angiotensin II was thought to take place in the plasma. However, in 1967, Kevin K. F. Ng and John R. Vane showed plasma ACE is too slow to account for the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II in vivo. Subsequent investigation showed rapid conversion occurs during its passage through the <b>pulmonary</b> <b>circulation.</b>|$|E
25|$|The lungs {{activate}} one hormone. The physiologically inactive decapeptide angiotensin I {{is converted}} to the aldosterone-releasing octapeptide, angiotensin II, in the <b>pulmonary</b> <b>circulation.</b> The reaction occurs in other tissues as well, but it is particularly prominent in the lungs. Angiotensin II also has a direct effect on arteriolar walls, causing arteriolar vasoconstriction, and consequently a rise in arterial blood pressure. Large amounts of the angiotensin-converting enzyme responsible for this activation are located on the surfaces of the endothelial cells of the alveolar capillaries. The converting enzyme also inactivates bradykinin. Circulation time through the alveolar capillaries is less than one second, yet 70% of the angiotensin I reaching the lungs {{is converted to}} angiotensin II in a single trip through the capillaries.

The distribution of {{blood flow to}} the systemic and <b>pulmonary</b> <b>circulations,</b> which in this patient population are in parallel rather than series, depends primarily on the relative resistances of the respective vascular beds. The entire cardiac output is managed by the single ventricle and must somehow divide itself between the systemic and pulmonary circuits. As pulmonary vascular resistance decreases after birth, many of these children will suffer from overcirculation into the pulmonary circuit. In patients with ductal-dependent systemic circulation, such as hypoplastic left heart syndrome, this can result in a paucity of systemic circu-lation with concomitant acidosis (Fig. 1 A).
