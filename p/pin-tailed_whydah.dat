50|$|The <b>pin-tailed</b> <b>whydah</b> {{was first}} {{described}} by the German naturalist Peter Simon Pallas in 1764 and given the binomial name Fringilla macroura.|$|E
50|$|The <b>pin-tailed</b> <b>whydah</b> (Vidua macroura) {{is a small}} {{songbird}} with {{a conspicuous}} pennant-like tail in breeding males. It is a resident breeding bird in most of Africa south of the Sahara Desert.|$|E
50|$|The female <b>pin-tailed</b> <b>whydah</b> {{could be}} mistaken for the red-billed quelea in non-breeding plumage, since both are sparrow-like birds with conical red-coloured bills, but the whydah has a whitish brow between a black stripe through the eye and a black stripe above.|$|E
50|$|The <b>pin-tailed</b> <b>whydah</b> {{occurs in}} much of sub-Saharan Africa, favouring grassland, scrubs and savannah, also coming into parks and gardens. In Portugal it is {{established}} in the region around Aveiro, with observations occurring {{north and south of}} it. It has also been introduced to southern California, Puerto Rico, and Singapore.|$|E
50|$|The red-cheeked {{cordon-bleu}} is a granivore, feeding principally on grass seeds, {{but also on}} millet and other small seeds. It is also known to feed sporadically on beeswax. Larger granivores, such as the <b>pin-tailed</b> <b>whydah</b> will chase cordon-bleus from food sources, limiting the feeding opportunities of the smaller birds and affecting their foraging success.|$|E
50|$|The male <b>pin-tailed</b> <b>whydah</b> is territorial, and {{one male}} often has several females {{in his small}} group. He has an {{elaborate}} courtship flight display, which includes hovering over the female to display his tail. The song is given from a high perch, and consists of rapid squeaking and churring. The diet of this species consists of seeds and grain.|$|E
50|$|The <b>pin-tailed</b> <b>whydah</b> is 12-13 cm in length, {{although}} the breeding male's tail adds another 20 cm to this. The adult male has a black back and crown, {{and a very}} long black tail. The wings are dark brown with white patches, and the underparts and the head, apart from the crown, are white. The bill is bright red. The female and non-breeding male have streaked brown upperparts, whitish underparts with buff flanks, and a buff and black face pattern. They lack the long tail extension, but retain the red bill. Immature birds are like the female but plainer and with a greyish bill.|$|E
5000|$|The nest {{is a large}} ball of criss-crossed grass stems with a long downward-pointing {{entrance}} tube on one side. It {{is built}} in a cavity, usually low down amongst dense vegetation. A rudimentary second nest ("cock's nest") may be built on top where the male sleeps. Four to seven white eggs are laid. They are incubated for 11 to 13 days and the young birds fledge 17 to 21 days after hatching. Both parents take part in incubating the eggs and feeding the chicks. The timing of the breeding season varies {{in different parts of}} the world. Nests may be parasitized by the <b>pin-tailed</b> <b>whydah</b> which lays its eggs in the nests of estrildid finches. In captivity they will breed in an aviary and can raise four broods in a year.|$|E
40|$|The first zoo {{was opened}} in London in 1828 and was {{intended}} for scientific study, but was eventually {{opened to the public}} in 1847. Since then, public dogma has dictated the development, role, and standards concerning the use of animals across the zoological community. Too often there is disconnect between research programs, captive propagation, and public education. In the fight against human driven extinction of earth's flora and fauna, it is vital that these areas be aligned. Thus in an effort to unite research and education in a zoological setting, East Carolina University (ECU) and Sylvan Heights Bird Park (SHBP) have partnered for a collaborative project involving the study of evolution in the African brood parasitic finches (Viduidae), specifically he <b>Pin-tailed</b> <b>Whydah</b> (Vidua macroura). I attempt to quantify the educational impact of Avian Pirates and SHBP, and assess basic demographic factors that will allow insights into what areas of exhibit design pertain to education. It is important to understand what aspects of zoos facilitate visitor learning in areas of conservation and biodiversity. This is vital as Zoos are under new pressure to substantiate claims of education during visits...|$|E
