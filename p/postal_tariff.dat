50|$|On November 3, 1796, Miguel de Ateaga, then Postmaster of Guatemala, {{adopted a}} new general tariff for postal rates. The tariffs {{were raised in}} 1807 {{to cover the costs}} of {{establishing}} a second trip to Oaxaca. These raises were of ½ real for single letters, 1 real for double and triple letters, and ½ real for each additional Onza for letters destined to territories outside the Captaincy General. The next <b>postal</b> <b>tariff,</b> adopted on October 1, 1814 and promulgated in Guatemala City the following year by Postmaster Miguel de Ateaga, charged for a simple letter of less than one-half Onza, 3 reales within Central America, Yucatán, the north of Mexico, Tabasco, California, the Caribbean Islands, and New Orleans; 2 reales for various cities in the center of Mexico; and 4 reales for Peru, the remainder of South America, the Philippines, and Spain.|$|E

5000|$|Six new {{denominations}} {{were issued}} 1 March 2005 because {{of changes in}} <b>postal</b> <b>tariffs.</b> The newness {{was the creation of}} a European tariff. Before March 2005, a letter for France or the Western Europa cost the same price since March 2005, a letter for a country of the European Union cost 2 cents more (0.55 €).|$|R
5000|$|On 1 November 1861, five {{definitive}} stamps with {{values of}} ½, 1, 1½, 3, and 4 Schillings were issued in Bergedorf. These five values could satisfy the <b>postal</b> <b>tariffs</b> for all distance and weight {{needs of the}} time. At that time, only about 12,000 people lived in the whole postal region. The imperforated definitive stamps were printed when required and were valid until 31 December 1867. The stamps are square in shape. Besides the value, the country's name and the term [...] "Postmarke", the centre of each stamp depicted {{one half of the}} coat of arms of each of Hamburg and Lübeck.|$|R
50|$|On 1 July 1722 Charles III nationalized {{the postal}} system, and {{declared}} {{the delivery of}} messages {{and the establishment of}} post offices to be a state monopoly. He placed the imperial coat of arms on every postal building, regulated <b>postal</b> <b>tariffs,</b> and developed the existing postal routes, subordinating every post office to the main post office at the imperial court in Vienna. The language of administration was German, and most of the employees were Austrian. In 1784 Maria Theresa's Postal Patent further modernized the system, separating normal and mail-coach delivery. The mail-coach service started one year later throughout the empire, establishing a permanent route between Vienna and Buda in 1752.|$|R
5000|$|First stamps {{only valid}} in the Saar Area were issued as of 10 January 1947. A {{first set of}} definitives came out in mid-1947, and {{included}} 17 stamps using six designs, including worker of various occupations, Mettlach Abbey, and Marshal Ney. Three of these values were also printed on paper watermarked with a pattern of curving lines. These first stamps were denominated in German currency, but just as before, were replaced in November by French currency denominations. The <b>postal</b> <b>tariffs</b> were adapted to the French postages, mail to France was to be franked at the domestic postage, mail to Allied-occupied Germany at the foreign <b>tariff.</b> The <b>postal</b> service of the Bizone subsumed mail to the Saar Protectorate under the foreign postage only as of 1 October 1948.|$|R
50|$|In many countries, {{telecommunications}} (including broadband accesses), <b>postal</b> services, electricity <b>tariffs,</b> {{and collective}} traffic among others are cross subsidized. In some cases, {{there is a}} universal price ceiling for the services, leading to cross subsidies benefiting the areas for which the costs of provision are high.|$|R
40|$|The {{authors of}} the {{articles}} under reply, Messrs. McDougal and Lans, have, like McClure, essayed {{to show that the}} treaty and the executive agreement are interchangeable, and, since executive agreements are simpler to conclude, they advocate disregarding as obsolete the treaty-making power, requiring, as it does, the consent of two thirds of the Senate, and substituting for it the use of the executive agreement. In that demand they differ radically from the constitutional conclusions which the writer, as well as many other students of the subject, have reached. To give their proposal a more “democratic” tinge, the authors propose what they call the Congressional – Executive agreement, which, as a Congressional approval of executive agreements already made, has no roots in history, but is deemed by the authors to stand on an equally good footing with the executive agreement concluded pursuant to an act of Congress, of which there are illustrations in the <b>postal</b> and <b>tariff</b> agreements concluded ever since early days in the case of postal agreements and since 1890 in the case of tariffs...|$|R
40|$|Under an entry-exit gas tariff system, {{reservation}} {{of capacity}} is split into entry capacity, to transport {{gas from the}} injection points to a virtual balancing point, and exit capacity, to transport gas from the balancing point to the exit points in the system. Entry-exit tariff for gas transport systems have been recommended by the 3 rd EU Energy Package, since they are cost reflective, facilitate gas trade and can provide signals for the location of gas injections or off-takes. The advisability of applying an entry-exit tariff system is discussed in this paper. Apart from this, authors propose an entry-exit tariff model {{and apply it to}} compute charges for the Spanish gas transport system in 2009. Results produced by the model are presented as coefficients which should multiply the current <b>postal</b> transport <b>tariff.</b> The paper concludes that entry-exit tariffs would be useful location signals which would result in a better use of the gas transport system in Spain. In those cases where demand exceeds available capacity, as it occurs at the congested connection with France, entry-exit tariffs could be supplemented by capacity charges at entry points resulting from auctions.
