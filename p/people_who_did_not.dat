5|$|Across coastal areas, {{the storm}} surge {{flooding}} caused minor damage to dozens of homes and closed several roads. Near Homosassa, two <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> evacuate required water rescue. At Egmont Key State Park, a woman fell off of a boat when a band of showers and surging currents made navigation difficult; her husband and a friend drowned after jumping in to save her without life jackets, though the woman returned safely to the boat. The rainfall caused some temporary road flooding, though precipitation was mostly beneficial in alleviating drought conditions. Moderate wind gusts caused scattered power outages and downed some trees across the northeast portion of the state. Overall, property damage in the state rose to about $390,000 (2006USD) in total.|$|E
5|$|All Bismarck's {{resources}} were deployed; he even asked Empress Victoria {{to use her}} influence with her son on his behalf. But the wizard had lost his magic; his spells were powerless because they were exerted on <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> respect them, and he who had so signally disregarded Kant's command to use people as ends in themselves had too small a stock of loyalty to draw on. As Lord Salisbury told Queen Victoria: 'The very qualities which Bismarck fostered in the Emperor in order to strengthen himself when the Emperor Frederick should come to the throne have been the qualities by {{which he has been}} overthrown.' The Empress, with what must have been a mixture of pity and triumph, told him that her influence with her son could not save him for he himself had destroyed it.|$|E
5|$|It {{is not yet}} {{known what}} {{specific}} agent in the body brings about the allergic reaction to the radiation. When patients with SU were injected with an irradiated autologous serum, many developed urticaria within the area of injection. When <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> have SU were injected, they did not demonstrate similar symptoms. This indicates that the reaction is only a characteristic of the patients with solar urticaria {{and that it is}} not phototoxic. It is possible that this photoallergen is located on the binding sites of IgE that are found on the surface of mast cells. The photoallergen is believed to begin its configuration through the absorption of radiation by a chromophore. The molecule, because of the radiation, is transformed resulting in the formation of a new photoallergen.|$|E

25|$|The Ogaden {{region was}} conquered by the Ethiopian Empire {{in the middle}} of the 19th century, making it a buffer zone between the state and {{expanding}} European interests in the region. Unlike the rest of Ethiopia it is populated by the Ogadeni people, a subgroup of Somalis. For most of its history under Ethiopian administration Ogaden was regarded as an inhospitable land, inhabited by uncivilized <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> adhere to Christianity. Isolated military garrisons were erected through the land, exacting taxes from the local herders.|$|E

A second rapid test (called latex agglutination test) gave correct, positive results in 64% of {{the people with the}} disease and it gave correct, negative results in 93% of the people without the disease. Other types of tests have not been studied thoroughly enough to ascertain their efficacy.|$|E
25|$|In the 1640s, the Virginia Colony built Fort Henry {{and traded}} with the eastern Siouan of proto-historic West Virginia. A fort built of {{particular}} protohistoric interest was the James River Fort of William Byrd I established in 1676. It was still closer to Tutelo groups, elemental Swanton's Toteras of interest, and its nearby Monacan east of Roanoke area and Kanawhan Monetons following Wood's 1674 contact. Monecaga were a westerly subset of Monacan. According to John Lederer, The Monacan {{had been driven}} by enemies from the northwest into James River and Blue Ridge Mountains region of Virginia around 1250. There they found a hunter-gatherer <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> grow corn. Along with Shattera, these were among the Occane-Uchi Virginia trade through {{the south of the}} state.|$|E

Elgass had stated that he did not 'advance' for <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> want to be members of the party. When questioned about the woman, he said that it could happen that they 'advanced' for the wrong person. The police had also found Elgsaas' mother's name on two of the giros. Elgsaas explained that he experienced pressure from the leader of AUF, Trond Giske, and the general secretary, Rita Ottervik, to continue with the 'advancements'.|$|E
25|$|A {{deterioration}} {{of relations between}} hellenized Jews and orthodox Jews led the Seleucid king Antiochus IV Epiphanes to impose decrees banning certain Jewish religious rites and traditions. Consequently, the orthodox Jews revolted {{under the leadership of}} the Hasmonean family (also known as the Maccabees). This revolt eventually {{led to the formation of}} an independent Jewish kingdom, known as the Hasmonaean Dynasty, which lasted from 165 BCE to 63 BCE. The Hasmonean Dynasty eventually disintegrated as a result of civil war between the sons of Salome Alexandra, Hyrcanus II and Aristobulus II. The <b>people,</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> want to be governed by a king but by theocratic clergy, made appeals in this spirit to the Roman authorities. A Roman campaign of conquest and annexation, led by Pompey, soon followed.|$|E
25|$|Paul {{says that}} when he entered medical {{practice}} in the early 1960s, before the Medicare and Medicaid programs were established, the poor and the elderly were hospitalized at about the same rates as they have been under Medicare and Medicaid in the 2000s, and that they received good care. He says further that in those days, doctors and hospitals provided cut-rate or free care to <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> have health insurance – “every physician understood that he or she had a responsibility toward the less fortunate, and free medical care for the poor was the norm” – and that this was possible because healthcare costs were much lower. At a church charity hospital where he worked in his early years of practice, “nobody was turned away” for lack of ability to pay.|$|E

25|$|Bart Ehrman, Robert Eisenman {{and others}} {{critical}} of traditional Christian views, {{in assessing the}} problems involved in conducting historical Jesus research, say the Gospels are full of discrepancies, were written decades after Jesus' death, by authors who had not witnessed any events in Jesus' life. They go on to say the Gospels were authored not by eyewitnesses who were contemporary with the events that they narrate but rather by <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> know Jesus, see anything he did, or hear anything he taught, and that the authors did not even share a language with Jesus. The accounts they produced are not disinterested; they are narratives produced by Christians who actually believed in Jesus, and were not immune from slanting the stories {{in light of their}} biases. Ehrman points out that the texts are widely inconsistent, full of discrepancies and contradictions in both details and larger portraits of who Jesus was.|$|E
25|$|To this end, {{throughout}} {{the autumn of}} 1933, the government decreed a dramatic series of reforms. The Platt Amendment was unilaterally abrogated, and all the political parties of the Machadato were dissolved. The Provisional Government granted autonomy to the University of Havana, women obtained the right to vote, the eight-hour day was decreed, a minimum wage was established for cane-cutters, and compulsory arbitration was promoted. The government created a Ministry of Labour, and a law was passed establishing that 50 per cent of all workers in agriculture, commerce and industry had to be Cuban citizens. The Grau regime set agrarian reform as a priority, promising peasants legal title to their lands. For {{the first time in}} Cuban history the country was governed by <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> negotiate the terms of political power with Spain (before 1898), or with the United States (after 1898). The Provisional Government survived until January 1934, when it was overthrown by an equally loose anti-government coalition of right-wing civilian and military elements. Led by a young mulatto sergeant, Fulgencio Batista y Zaldivar, this movement was supported by the United States.|$|E
25|$|Bulgarian Muslims do not {{represent}} a homogenous community and have a multitude of ethnic and religious identities. A clear majority of them (127,350 {{according to the latest}} census in 2001) declare themselves to be ethnic Bulgarians of Islamic faith. However, a significant percentage, in particular in the Central and Eastern Rhodopes (the Smolyan and Kardzhali Province), are not religious or choose to disassociate themselves from Islam. Thus, the Smolyan Province, which is largely populated by Bulgarian Muslims (approximately 117,000 or 71% of the population according to the Ministry of Interior in 1989), has the highest number of <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> declare any religion in the 2001 Census - 39,003 or 27.8% {{of the population of the}} province - compared to a national average of only 3.6%. Considering the insignificant change in the number of Bulgarian Christians (from approximately 47,000 in 1989 to 41,792 in 2001), the total number of ethnic Bulgarians in the province (122,806 or 87.7%) and that only 58,758 people or 41.9% of the population of the province declared to profess Islam in 2001, the vast majority of the undeclared must be of Bulgarian Muslim extraction.|$|E
