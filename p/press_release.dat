40|$|Background: <b>Press</b> <b>releases</b> are {{a popular}} vehicle to {{disseminate}} health {{information to the}} lay media. While the quality of <b>press</b> <b>releases</b> issued by scientific conferences and medical journals has been questioned, no efforts to assess pharmaceutical industry <b>press</b> <b>releases</b> have been made. Therefore, we sought to systematically examine pharmaceutical company <b>press</b> <b>releases</b> about original research for measures of quality. Methodolgy/Principal Findings: <b>Press</b> <b>releases</b> issued by the ten top selling, international pharmaceutical companies in the year 2005 were selected for evaluation. A total of 1028 electronic <b>press</b> <b>releases</b> were issued and 235 were based on original research. More than half (59 %) reported results presented at a scientific meeting. Twenty-one percent of releases were not explicit about the source of original data. While harms or adverse events were commonly cited (76 %), study limitations were rarely noted (6 %). Almost one-third (29 %) of releases did not quantify study results. Studies presented in abstract form were subsequently published within at least 20 months in 53 % of cases. Conclusions: Pharmaceutical company <b>press</b> <b>releases</b> frequently report basic study details. However, readers should be cautioned by the preliminary nature of the data and lack of identified limitations. Methods to improve the reporting and interpretation of drug company <b>press</b> <b>releases</b> are desirable to prevent misleading media coverage...|$|R

40|$|Despite {{acknowledging}} {{the importance of}} different types of <b>press</b> <b>releases</b> in the accounting literature, researchers have conducted little systematic empirical research on this topic. To address this issue the present study examines the antecedents of a firm's decision to issue an Annual Results <b>Press</b> <b>Releases</b> (ARPRs) in a cross-national context, using Spain and the UK. The study investigates {{for the first time the}} relationship among ARPRs, earnings performance, the existence of an investor relations department (IRD), company size, and ownership concentration. Using a sample of 246 publicly traded Spanish and UK companies, this article shows that the two countries have significant differences in the disclosure of <b>press</b> <b>releases.</b> Moreover, size and the existence of an IRD were found to have a significant and direct effect on the disclosure of <b>press</b> <b>releases.</b> Finally, the results also indicate that ownership structure and company size play an important role as moderators to explain the effect on disclosure of <b>press</b> <b>releases.</b> Implications of these findings along with limitations and directions for further research are discussed.

40|$|The aim {{with this}} study is to {{investigate}} how Swedish public service local radio uses information subsides in the form of <b>press</b> <b>releases.</b> In terms of which entrants gain entrance to the news feed, in which forms and in which subjects. Also we wanted to study how the journalist uses the content in the <b>press</b> <b>releases.</b> To do this we cooperated with the public service radio channel Sveriges radio P 4 Kalmar. For 28 days, four weeks, we collected all incoming <b>press</b> <b>releases</b> to the newsroom of P 4 Kalmar. All in all we got 1046 <b>press</b> <b>releases</b> sorted in four weekly periods. Out of each one of those periods we randomly selected 75 <b>press</b> <b>releases</b> to get our sample of units.

The use of <b>press</b> <b>releases</b> is then discussed in relation to the distinction presented by Lees-Marshement between product oriented, sales oriented and market oriented parties. The conclusion is that Dansk Folkeparti use the <b>press</b> <b>releases</b> as a part of their political marketing, but that the party due to its moral politics has to be classified as a sales oriented party.

40|$|Objective To {{identify}} the source (<b>press</b> <b>releases</b> or news) of distortions, exaggerations, or {{changes to the}} main conclusions drawn from research that could potentially influence a readerâs health related behaviour. Design Retrospective quantitative content analysis. Setting Journal articles, <b>press</b> <b>releases,</b> and related news, with accompanying simulations. Sample <b>Press</b> <b>releases</b> (n= 462) on biomedical and health related science issued by 20 leading UK universities in 2011, alongside their associated peer reviewed research papers and news stories (n= 668). Main outcome measures Advice to readers to change behaviour, causal statements drawn from correlational research, and inference to humans from animal research that went beyond those in the associated peer reviewed papers. Results 40 % (95 % confidence interval 33 % to 46 %) of the <b>press</b> <b>releases</b> contained exaggerated advice, 33 % (26 % to 40 %) contained exaggerated causal claims, and 36 % (28 % to 46 %) contained exaggerated inference to humans from animal research. When <b>press</b> <b>releases</b> contained such exaggeration, 58 % (95 % confidence interval 48 % to 68 %), 81 % (70 % to 93 %), and 86 % (77 % to 95 %) of news stories, respectively, contained similar exaggeration, compared with exaggeration rates of 17 % (10 % to 24 %), 18 % (9 % to 27 %), and 10 % (0 % to 19 %) in news when the <b>press</b> <b>releases</b> were not exaggerated. Odds ratios for each category of analysis were 6. 5 (95 % confidence interval 3. 5 to 12), 20 (7. 6 to 51), and 56 (15 to 211). At the same time, there was little evidence that exaggeration in <b>press</b> <b>releases</b> increased the uptake of news. Conclusions Exaggeration in news is strongly associated with exaggeration in <b>press</b> <b>releases.</b> Improving the accuracy of academic <b>press</b> <b>releases</b> could represent a key opportunity for reducing misleading health related news...|$|R
40|$|Background Exaggerated or simplistic news {{is often}} blamed for {{adversely}} influencing public health. However, recent findings suggested many exaggerations were already present in university <b>press</b> <b>releases,</b> which scientists approve. Surprisingly, these exaggerations were {{not associated with}} more news coverage. Here we test whether these two controversial results also arise in <b>press</b> <b>releases</b> from prominent science and medical journals. We then investigate the influence of mitigating caveats in <b>press</b> <b>releases,</b> to test assumptions that caveats harm news interest or are ignored. Methods and Findings Using quantitative content analysis, we analyzed <b>press</b> <b>releases</b> (N = 534) on biomedical and health-related science issued by leading peer-reviewed journals. We similarly analysed the associated peer-reviewed papers (N = 534) and news stories (N = 582). Main outcome measures were advice to readers and causal statements drawn from correlational research. Exaggerations in <b>press</b> <b>releases</b> predicted exaggerations in news (odds ratios 2. 4 and 10. 9, 95...|$|R
40|$|In this thesis, I {{have studied}} how {{a major event}} such as a crisis changes the way a company {{promotes}} transparency in their corporate communication. To gain knowledge about this aspect of their communication I did a multicase study of two cases; BP and the Deepwater Horizon accident and Tesco and the horsemeat scandal. Methodically I did a categorization of <b>press</b> <b>releases</b> from three selected periods. One year before the accident, during the accident and {{one year after the}} accident. This categorization was followed by email interviews as well as a rhetorical analysis of selected <b>press</b> <b>releases</b> from the two companies.

40|$|In this paper, we {{describe}} NewsCATS (news categorization and trading system), a system implemented to predict stock price trends {{for the time}} immediately {{after the publication of}} <b>press</b> <b>releases.</b> NewsCATS consists mainly of three components. The first component retrieves relevant information from <b>press</b> <b>releases</b> through the application of text preprocessing techniques. The second component sorts the <b>press</b> <b>releases</b> into predefined categories. Finally, appropriate trading strategies are derived by the third component by means of the earlier categorization. The findings indicate that a categorization of <b>press</b> <b>releases</b> is able to provide additional information {{that can be used to}} forecast stock price trends, but that an adequate trading strategy is essential for the results of the categorization to be fully exploited...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} {{empirical}} research into how <b>press</b> <b>releases</b> are being constructed. It starts from previous corpus-based work which has {{pointed to the}} âpreformulatedâ nature of press releases: in particular, {{it has been shown}} that through a number of metapragmatic features <b>press</b> <b>releases</b> can easily be copied by journalists in their own news reporting. In this paper we set out to subject one of these features, viz. pseudo-quotations, to a further, empirical study, in which we scrutinize the process of constructing the <b>press</b> <b>releases.</b> We propose a detailed analysis of this process by combining ethnographic fieldwork with some of the methodology of cognitive psychology, including think-aloud protocols and on-line registration of the total writing process. Our preliminary results indicate that this combination provides a sound starting point for both quantitative and qualitative analysis, allowing for a detailed analysis and interpretation of how <b>press</b> <b>releases</b> are being constructed. <b>Press</b> <b>releases,</b> Ethnography, Writing process analysis, Preformulation, Psuedo-quotations...|$|R

5|$|In October 2008, new {{insights}} into the effect of Internet usage on cognition were gleaned from the results, reported in a <b>press</b> <b>release,</b> of a study conducted by UCLA's Memory and Aging Research Center that had tested two groups of people between the ages of 55 and 76 years old; only one group of which were experienced web users. While they had read books or performed assigned search tasks their brain activity had been monitored with functional MRI scans, which revealed that both reading and web search utilize the same language, reading, memory, and visual regions of the brain; however, it was discovered that those searching the web stimulated additional decision-making and complex reasoning regions of the brain, with a two-fold increase in these regions in experienced web users compared with inexperienced web users. Gary Small, the director of the UCLA center and lead investigator of the UCLA study, concurrently released the book iBrain: Surviving the Technological Alteration of the Modern Mind, co-authored with Gigi Vorgan, with the <b>press</b> <b>release.</b>|$|E
