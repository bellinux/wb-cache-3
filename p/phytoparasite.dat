40|$|Nematode {{communities}} are valuable bioindicators of soil disturbance induced by agricultural practices. We report {{the results of}} a short term experiment set on a field previously cultivated with shell beans, where different agricultural practices were applied, namely disinfection with chemicals or organic alternatives (neem, basil, marigold and clove oils). We provide {{a detailed description of the}} soil nematode community before and after the application of agricultural practices, in terms of trophic structure, nematode functional indices and diversity. We also employ network analysis techniques to analyze the structure of nematode assemblages on the basis of co-occurrence of genera in samples. Chemical disinfection had a direct lethal effect on all nematode genera reducing or even eliminating their populations, while organic amendments favored only the free living nematodes without affecting plant feeders. These differences were poorly reflected on changes of diversity and even less on those of nematode indices. Network analysis offered significant insights into the structural changes in the web of interactions among nematode genera. The network after chemical disinfection was smaller, poorly connected and almost entirely dependent on the dominant <b>phytoparasite</b> Paratylenchus.

In the three reading times, the higuerilla fruits, roots and leaves ketone extracts in the 100 %, concentration had a nematicidal effect between 73 and 89 % without significant statistic differences with the chemical control which had values between 82 and 98 %. These treatments presented differences statistically significant with the water control which showed lower values between 0. 7 and 12 %.

40|$|International audienceThe necrotrophic fungus Botrytis cinerea is {{reported}} to infect more than 220 host plants worldwide. In phylogenetical-taxonomical terms, the pathogen is considered a complex of two cryptic species, group I and group II. We sampled populations of B. cinerea on sympatric strawberry and raspberry cultivars in the North-East of Hungary for three years during flowering and the harvest period. Four hundred and ninety group II B. cinerea isolates were analyzed for the current study. Three different data sets were generated: (i) PCR-RFLP patterns of the ADP-ATP translocase and nitrate reductase genes, (ii) MSB 1 minisatellite sequence data, and (iii) the fragment sizes of five microsatellite loci. The structures of the different populations were similar as indicated by Nei's gene diversity and haplotype diversity. The F statistics (Fst, Gst), and the gene flow indicated ongoing differentiation within sympatric populations. The population genetic parameters were influenced by polymorphisms within the three data sets as assessed using Bayesian algorithms. Data Mining analysis pointed towards the five microsatellite loci as the most defining markers to study differentiation in the 490 isolates.

40|$|A molecular-based assay was {{employed}} to analyse and accurately identify various root-knot nematodes (Meloidogyne spp.) parasitizing potatoes (Solanum tuberosum) in South Africa. Using the intergenic region (IGS) and the 28 S D 2 –D 3 expansion segments within the ribosomal DNA (rDNA), together with the region between the cytochrome oxidase subunit II (COII) and the 16 S rRNA gene of the mtDNA, 78 composite potato tubers collected from seven major potato growing provinces were analysed and all Meloidogyne species present were identified. During this study, M. incognita, M. arenaria, M. javanica, M. hapla, M. chitwoodi and M. enterolobii were identified. The three tropical species M. javanica, M. incognita and M. arenaria were identified as the most prevalent species, occurring in almost every region sampled. Meloidogyne hapla and M. enterolobii occurred in Mpumalanga and KwaZulu-Natal, respectively, while M. chitwoodi was isolated from two growers located within the Free State.

40|$|Soil {{nematodes}} {{constitute a}} good tool {{for assessing the}} quality of agricultural soils due to their biological and ecological characteristics. Nematode community changes may provide information on disturbances of agro-ecosystems. In this thesis, the effects of changing soil conditions, induced by conventional and organic farming practices, on the soil nematode community, were investigated. In the 1 st chapter, the effect of chemical disinfection, {{one of the strongest}} pressures on cultivated soils, on the nematode community was described and compared to the effect of an alternative type of disinfection, i. e. with a mixture of organic plant-based disinfectants. For this purpose, an experiment was conducted in a field cultivated conventionally with shell beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) for many years. Different plots within the field were disinfected either with metham sodium or with a mixture of organic disinfectants, while control plots that were just tilled but received no disinfectant were also included in the study. One month after treatments, the quantitative parameters of nematode communities (abundance of trophic and functional groups, nematode indices, diversity), as well as the changes in the network of interactions among nematode genera, were studied. Chemical disinfection reduced the abundance of all trophic groups. The only group that recovered one month after treatment was the one of cp 1 bacterivores. The reduction of the dominant genus, namely the <b>phytoparasite</b> Paratylenchus, led to a change of the dominance pattern and increased diversity. Regarding the network of interactions between nematode genera, chemical disinfection led to smaller, less complex networks, with increased importance of the dominant Paratylenchus. Organic disinfection, {{and to a lesser extent}} tillage, increased the abundance of nematodes that feed on decomposers, mainly the one of cp 1 bacterivores. In both cases, diversity increased due to increased number of genera and increased abundance of non dominant genera. Thus, the interaction networks became larger, more complex, with reduced importance of the dominant Paratylenchus. In the 2 nd chapter, the changes of nematode community pattern within the first year of transition from conventional to organic cultivation system and within the first year of fallow were studied. The study focused on the quantitative parameters of nematode communities (abundance of trophic and functional groups, nematode indices, diversity), as well as on the changes in the network of interactions among nematode genera. The conversion of bean cultivations from conventional to organic resulted in the increase of bacterivorous nematodes, especially the cp 1 ones, and consequently in the reduction of Maturity Index and Channel Index and in the increase of Enrichment Index. In conventional plots, the <b>phytoparasite</b> Paratylenchus was always the dominant genus of the community, while in organic plots it became dominant only in the end of the cultivation period, when its abundance increased on the expense of the cp 1 bacterivores Diploscapter and Rhabditis. The opposite temporal trends of abundance of the cp 1 bacterivores and of the <b>phytoparasite</b> Paratylenchus determined the changes in dominance patters and consequently the changes in diversity. Regarding the networks of interactions among genera, no significant differences between conventional and organic plots were recorded. For both cultivation regimes, the networks were large, relatively simple, with increased importance of the dominant genus, and many peripheral genera being related only with the central genus. Fallow resulted in the reduction of all the trophic groups that are favored either by seasonal agricultural practices (microbivores) or by the presence of the host plant (phytoparasites). Moreover, fallow led to decreased number of genera. However, nematode indices failed to distinguish the cultivated plots from those under fallow, possibly because one cultivation period was not enough time. The interaction networks, though, were quite different from those in cultivated plots. They became smaller but quite complex, with increased relations between genera and reduced importance of the dominant genus. In the last chapter, the effect of the management regime (organic-conventional farming) on the community recovery after disturbance was studied. For a whole cultivation period, we studied the gradual recovery of the nematode community in experimental plots that received the disinfection treatments described in the 1 st chapter and were subsequently cultivated with beans either conventionally or organically. The application of manure in organic plots seemed to alter the negative effect of chemical disinfection on fungivores and non-parasitic plant feeders, whereas in conventional plots these trophic groups did not ever recovered [...] . ...|$|E
40|$|Four {{isolates}} of the root-hot nematode Meloidogyne incognita {{were analyzed}} for their virulence against the dominant Mi gene which controls resistance in commercially grown tomatoes. One isolate {{was found to}} be virulent under natural conditions and served as a standard for comparison of virulence. Two others were selected from an avirulent population by propagating them for 12 and 21 generations on the resistant tomato cv. Piersol. For comparison, populations derived from a single juvenile were maintened on susceptible cv. St Pierre. Comparisons of penetration of juveniles into the roots, the numbers of egg-masses produced from a standardized inoculum, the number of eggs per egg-mass produced in each generation on the susceptible and the resistant cultivars, showed a progressive increase in the proportion of virulent nematodes in spite of the reproduction being by obligatory mitotic parthenogenesis. Selection for virulence was accompanied by a general increase in fecundity {{and in the case of}} the acquired virulence generation after each generation. On the other hand, virulence remained stable after nine generations of propagation on susceptible tomato in the naturally virulent and the old acquired virulent isolates, while virulence seemed to continue to increase in the recently virulent one.

40|$|Striga hermonthica {{is a major}} {{biological}} constraint to {{cereal production}} in Africa. The intricate association between this <b>phytoparasite</b> and the cereal host makes management difficult. Damage to the host begins before Striga {{comes out of the}} soil. Also, infestation correlates negatively with soil fertility. Arbuscular mycorrrhizal (AM) fungi have a variety of ecological functions ranging from improved uptake of immobile nutrients, protection of host from pathogens, to soil aggregation. The question whether these beneficial micro-organisms could play a role within the Striga -cereal (patho) system was addressed. Inoculating Striga -infested sorghum with AM fungi in pots or in the field resulted in a significant reduction in the performance of Striga in terms of numbers attached to the roots, relative time of emergence, numbers emerged and dry weight of Striga shoots at sorghum harvest. AM effects on Striga were more pronounced with the Striga -tolerant S- 35 sorghum cultivar compared to effects with the Striga -sensitive CK 60 B. Inoculation with AM fungi compensated for damage by Striga in the S- 35 cultivar. This compensation was independent of AM inoculum density and was not affected by P application. Germination of preconditioned Striga seeds after exposure to root exudates from sorghum colonized by AM fungi was significantly reduced, with effects more prominent with exudates from S- 35 plants. AM fungi have the potential to affect Striga during germination, attachment, emergence, and possibly subsequent growth and development. It is important to understand the kind of management practices that farmers can apply to enhance mycorrhizal performance in an integrated management system...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. The aim of {{this study}} was (a) to explore {{long-term}} responses of soil nematodes to the conversion from conventional to organic cultivation and (b) to differentiate them from the short-term responses to seasonal agricultural practices. Nematode com-munities were studied in terms of trophic and generic structure, life strategy and diversity, in asparagus cultivations along a gradi-ent from conventional to organic under conversion (1 and 2 years), and certified organic (4 and 5 years). Samplings throughout the year were conducted with respect to seasonal agricultural practices. Changing management regime from conventional to organic cultivation seemed to initiate successional long-term changes in nema-tode communities, such as the gradual decline of <b>phytoparasites</b> in favour of bacterivores and fungivores, the gradual decrease of PPI, the increase of diversity. Alterations in the generic structure of the community were also revealed, driven mostly by the opposite trends of changes in abundance of Helicotylenchus vs. Heterocephalobus. Seasonal agricultural practices appeared to induce short-term responses of functional guilds of low colonizer-persister values (c-p 1 and 2) mostly, and were reflected in nematode indices, such as Maturity Index, Plant Parasitic Index, Enrichment Index, Channel Index but not Structure Index. Nematode responses at the generic level to seasonal agricultural practices seemed less intense than the ones imposed by changing management regime, {{and in the case of}} conventional cultivation they were almost entirely masked...|$|R

Twelve plant-parasitic nematode species were found. The predominant ectoparasites were Scutellonema brachyurum, Paratrichodorus minor and Rotylenchus unisexus. The predominant endoparasites were Pratylenchus zeae and larvae of Meloidogyne spp. (a mixture of M. incognita plus M. javanica). Helicotylenchus dihystera, Paratrophurus anomalus, Trophurus sp., Pratylenchus crenatus, Pratylenchus penetrans and Rotylenchulus paruus were also found. In the soil, total populations of plant-parasitic nematodes increased between planting d physiological maturity in eight fields while those in six fields decreased. In the roots, total populations of plant-parasitic nematodes increased between three w ks after planting and physiological maturity in eleven fields while those in two fields decreased. P. rninor populatjons usually increased during the growing season. Up to 900 Meloidogyne larvael 5 g roots were counted but very few adult females were found and gall formation was never observed. The sunflower cultivars studied thus allowed penetration of the roots by the larvae but inhibited the development of mature females. RESUME Les nématodes parasites des cultures en Afnque du Sud. 3.

The bioactive potential of essential oils (EOs) has been recognized, albeit empirically, for centuries. In the present work, the nematicidal potential of EOs extracted from 16 Eucalyptus spp., six Thymus spp. and four Mentha spp., from the Portuguese flora, were assessed. EOs were extracted by hydrodistillation and identified by GC and GC-MS. EO/methanol stock-solutions were added to 50 - 100 mixed-stage B. xylophilus suspensions to attain 2 and 1 μl EO/ml of suspension final concentration. After 24 h in darkness, dead and live nematodes were counted. Assays were repeated, at least, 10 times in 2 series. Of all Eucalyptus spp. EOs, only the citronellal-rich (36 %) E. citriodora EO showed 97 % mortality, at 2 μl/ml. Thymus zygis, T. vulgaris and one chemotype of T. caespititius EOs revealed 100 % mortality at 2 and 1 μl/ml. T. zygis and T. vulgaris EOs were thymol-rich (≈ 50 %) and T. caespititius EO was carvacrol-rich (58 %). Mentha arvensis EO, dominated by piperitone oxide (56 %), also revealed {{to be an effective}} nematicide, showing 100 % mortality in both concentrations.

40|$|Abstract Main {{conclusion}} Co-cultures of Pinus pinaster with Bursaphelenchus xylophilus {{were established}} as a biotechnological tool to evaluate the effect of nematotoxics addition in a host/parasite culture system. The pinewood nematode (PWN), Bursaphelenchus xylophilus, the causal agent of pine wilt disease (PWD), was detected {{for the first time}} in Europe in 1999 spreading throughout the pine forests in Portugal and recently in Spain. Plant in vitro cultures may be a useful experimental system to investigate the plant/nematode relationships in loco, thus avoiding the difficulties of field assays. In this study, Pinus pinaster in vitro cultures were established and compared to in vivo 1 year-old plantlets by analyzing shoot structure and volatiles production. In vitro co-cultures were established with the PWN and the effect of the <b>phytoparasite</b> on in vitro shoot structure, water content and volatiles production was evaluated. In vitro shoots showed similar structure and volatiles production to in vivo maritime pine plantlets. The first macroscopic symptoms of PWD were observed about 4 weeks after in vitro co-culture establishment. Nematode population in the culture medium increased and PWNs were detected in gaps of the callus tissue and in cavities developed from the degradation of cambial cells. In terms of volatiles main components, plantlets, P. pinaster cultures, and P. pinaster with B. xylophilus co-cultures were all b- and a-pinene rich. Cocultures may be an easy-to-handle biotechnological approach to study this pathology, envisioning the understanding of and finding ways to restrain this highly devastating nematode.

40|$|Striga hermonthica (Del.) Benth is an obligate root hemi-parasite {{of several}} cereals. Its effect on cereal crops {{is the main}} {{constraint}} for food production in sub-Saharan Africa. Various control methods have been already proposed, but the infestation by these parasitic plants persists. An appropriated method for Striga management adapted for the African farmer is very much needed. In this study, amendment of soil infested by this <b>phytoparasite</b> with Cubitermes mound powder is proposed as chemical amendment and natural microbial inoculum, to promote plant growth and reduce damage by S. hermonthica on sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L.). The influence of Cubitermes mound powder {{on the development of}} several microbial groups (arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, actinomycetes, saprophytic fungi) was investigated in a pot experiment with sorghum cultured in a sandy soil infested by S. hermonthica. In the amended soil, sorghum growth and mycorrhizal colonization of sorghum plants were significantly greater than in the control treatment. Mycorrhizal colonization was negatively correlated with the number of emerged Striga plants per pot and positively correlated with sorghum growth. The relationship with substrate-induced respiration (SIR) responses showed that amended soil was characterized by its response to hydroxybutyric acid (catabolic marker of mycorrhizal colonization) and non-amended soil by its response to phenylalanine. We noted that the number of emerged Striga plants in amended pots was significantly decreased. Since Cubitermes mound suspensions did not affect Striga seed germination under axenic conditions, it suggests that the amendment with Cubitermes powder reduces S. hermonthica infestation indirectly, i. e. via its effect on the indigenous soil microflora. Overall, it appears that management of Cubitermes mounds is a promising strategy to consider for effective protection of sorghum from Striga infestation...|$|E

40|$|Trypanosomatid parasites {{represent}} a major health issue affecting hundreds of million people worldwide, with clinical treatments that are partially effective and/or very toxic. They {{are responsible for}} serious human and plant diseases including Trypanosoma cruzi (Chagas disease), Trypanosoma brucei (Sleeping sickness), Leishmania spp. (Leishmaniasis), and Phytomonas spp. (<b>phytoparasites).</b> Both, animals and trypanosomatids lack the biosynthetic riboflavin (vitamin B 2) pathway, the vital precursor of flavin mononucleotide (FMN) and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) cofactors. While metazoans obtain riboflavin from the diet through RFVT/SLC 52 transporters, the riboflavin transport mechanisms in trypanosomatids still remain unknown. Here, we show that riboflavin is imported with high affinity in Trypanosoma cruzi, Trypanosoma brucei, Leishmania (Leishmania) mexicana, Crithidia fasciculata and Phytomonas Jma using radiolabeled riboflavin transport assays. The vitamin is incorporated through a saturable carrier-mediated process. Effective competitive uptake occurs with riboflavin analogs roseoflavin, lumiflavin and lumichrome, and co-factor derivatives FMN and FAD. Moreover, important biological processes evaluated in T. cruzi (i. e. proliferation, metacyclogenesis and amastigote replication) are dependent on riboflavin availability. In addition, the riboflavin competitive analogs were found to interfere with parasite physiology on riboflavin-dependent processes. By means of bioinformatics analyses we identified a novel family of riboflavin transporters (RibJ) in trypanosomatids. Two RibJ members, TcRibJ and TbRibJ from T. cruzi and T. brucei respectively, were functionally characterized using homologous and/or heterologous expression systems. The RibJ family represents the first riboflavin transporters found in protists and the third eukaryotic family known to date. The essentiality of riboflavin for trypanosomatids, and the structural/biochemical differences that RFVT/SLC 52 and RibJ present, make the riboflavin transporter -and its downstream metabolism- a potential trypanocidal drug target...|$|R
40|$|The African {{oil palm}} (Elaeis guineensis Jacq.) is grown on a total area of 16 million ha; but data on soil quality in mature oil palm {{plantations}} are fragmentary and data concerning biota are almost nonexistent. Consequently, no well-tested sampling method {{is available for}} soil diagnoses. We studied the spatial heterogeneity of the soil around the palm by measuring comprehensive soil quality in a 24 -year-old oil palm plantation. Soil quality and litter were assessed in five zones with different plant cover, and different applications of herbicide or fertilizer. Physical-chemical characteristics, macrofauna, and nematofauna were analysed. A sampling method was developed and adapted {{to the way the}} cultivation practices are implemented: sampling by zone and weighting the plot mean by the respective area of each zone. The total density of macrofauna in the litter and in the 0 - 15 cm soil layer followed a gradient from the harvest pathway (29 ind m(- 2)) to the windrow (1003 ind m(- 2)). Ants (13 - 237 ind m(- 2)), earthworms (11 - 120 ind m(- 2)), Dermaptera (0 - 35 ind m(- 2)), Coleoptera (3 - 24 ind m(- 2)) and Chilopoda (0 - 43 ind m(- 2)) were the main taxa. The termite population was very poor (3 - 4 ind m(- 2)). The density of nematofauna was also heterogeneous (268 - 805 ind 100 g(- 1) of soil). Heterogeneity between zones was also reflected in the density of the functional groups, mainly soil engineers, detritivores and predators for macrofauna and bacterial feeders, and <b>phytoparasites</b> for nematofauna. The weeded circular zone around the palm had the highest soil nutrient content (P, K, Ca, Mg, C-org CEC, base saturation). Its biodiversity was average but it contained the highest density of earthworms and nematofauna. Possible relationships between chemicals and biological groups in the food web are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{pinewood}} nematode (PWN) Bursaphelenchus xylophilus {{is a highly}} pathogenic plant parasite that greatly affects pine forests. In Portugal, the most affected species is Pinus pinaster Aiton. Despite great efforts, since its fist detection in 1999, the PWN has spread through the country, including Madeira Island, having been recently detected in Spain [1, 2]. Containing this pest is {{of the utmost importance}} for European pine forest safeguard. Since most synthetic chemicals used to control <b>phytoparasites</b> are toxic to humans and animals, and can accumulate in the soil and in food plants [3], in the present work, the nematoxic potential of over 80 essential oils (EOs), isolated from the Portuguese flora, were assessed against the PWN. EOs were isolated by hydrodistillation and analysed by GC and GC-MS [3]. EOs hydrocarbon and oxygen-containing fractions were obtained as in [4]. Direct-contact assays, adapted from [3], were performed by adding EOs/methanol stock-solutions to 50 - 100 mixed-stage PWN suspensions. After 24 h in darkness, dead and live nematodes were counted under an inverted microscope. Assays were repeated at least 10 times in two series. Mortalities ≥ 96 % were obtained with 2 μL/mL of the EOs isolated from Cymbopogon citratus, Eucalyptus citriodora, Mentha arvensis, Origanum virens, Origanum vulgare, Ruta graveolens, Satureja montana, Syzygium aromaticum, Thymbra capitata, Thymus caespititius (carvacrol and/or thymol-rich), Thymus vulgaris and Thymus zygis. These EOs were further tested at 1, 0. 5 and 0. 25 μL/mL. Minimum lethal concentrations (LC 100) < 0. 4 μL/mL, were obtained for the 2 -undecanone-rich R. graveolens EO and the carvacrol and γ-terpinene-rich S. montana and T. capitata EOs. Assays with EO fractions revealed that the monoterpene-rich nematoxic EOs control PWN through their combined hydrocarbon and oxygen-containing fractions through additive and/or synergic relations. As complex mixtures of active components, EOs may prove to be effective nematoxic age nts...|$|R

With juveniles of M. jauanica a significant repulsion was observed with the four salts at concentrations of 5 x and 1. 25 x M/ 1. With juveniles of H. oryzae only NaCl was repellent. With S. cauenessi, the four salts failed to exhibit a repulsion. I t would appear logical {{to assume that the}} capacity to migrate toward the egion having the lower Salt concentra-tion, in a concentration gradient of salt is common within M. javanica and M. incognita populations; however, i t appears that this capacity is not common within al 1 plant parasitic nematodes.

40|$|Synthetic {{pesticides}} {{have played}} a major role in crop protection related to the intensification of agricultural systems. In the recent years, environmental side effects and health concerns raised by an indiscriminate use have led the EU to the ban of many synthetic pesticides. As a result of this drastic revision, currently there is a strong need for new and alternative pest control methods. An interesting source of biorational pesticides may be represented by the biocidal compounds naturally occurring in plants as products of the secondary metabolism. Groups of plant secondary metabolites most promising for the development of pesticidal formulations are glucosinolates, saponins, and more generally terpenoid phytoconstituents, such as essential oil and their constituents. Glucosinolates are thioglucosidic secondary metabolites occurring mainly in the Brassicaceae and, at a less extent, in Capparidaceae families. The incorporation of glucosinolate- containing plant material into the soil results in degradation products highly toxic to soilborne pest, pathogens and weeds. This practice, known as biofumigation, may be considered as an ecological alternative to soil toxic fumigants. Plant-derived saponins are triterpene glycosides present in top and root tissues of plant species of the families Leguminosae, Alliaceae, Asteraceae, Polygalaceae and Agavaceae. Saponins and saponin-rich plant materials have been also reported for a biocidal activity on <b>phytoparasites</b> and soilborne plant pathogens. Essential oils are volatile, natural, heterogeneous mixtures of single substances, mainly terpenes and phenolics, formed as secondary metabolites by aromatic plants belonging to several botanical families. Among terpenes, limonoid triterpenes have been demonstrated to possess interesting insecticidal, nematicidal and antifungal properties. Occurrence of these compounds is mainly limited to Meliaceae and Rutaceae. Alkaloids, phenolics, cyanogenic glucosides, polyacetylenes and polythienyls are further groups of secondary metabolites also known for their biocidal activity and susceptible for the production of natural pesticides. Alkaloids are derived from various botanical families, amongst which the Solacaneae, and include a number of molecules, such as nicotine, veratrine, cevatrine and ryanodine, used as insecticides. Phenolics were found also toxic to insects, fungi, bacteria, nematodes and weeds. Cyanogenic glucosides are amino acidderived secondary metabolites releasing, upon tissue disruption, hydrogen cyanide that suppress insects, fungus, nematodes and weeds. Finally, polyacetylenes and polythienyls, substances mainly present in Tagetes species, are also well known for their insecticidal and nematicidal properties...|$|R
40|$|The study {{objects of}} the present PhD Thesis are organic and {{conventional}} agro-ecosystems, where soil biodiversity is investigated by studying nematode and coleopteran biocommunities (in general also macro-arthropod communities). As agro-ecosystems, crop production systems (cultivated fields) as well as formations of natural vegetation (hedgerows) are taken into consideration. The following general points in question are investigated in the present PhD Thesis: > Which are the differences between conventional and organic management systems? > Do the organic cultivation systems differ from the more ‘natural’ agroecosystems of hedgerows? > Is the management history of biological and chemical disturbances and the duration of organic management reflected in the soil of the cultivated systems? > Are the impacts of long term disturbances due to the management regime, different from the short term ones due to seasonal agricultural practices? > Do cultivation systems with a different management history (different history in biological and chemical disturbances) respond differently to a similar disturbance mainly of mechanical nature? The investigation of the points in question is accomplished in four chapters, whose content is summarized in the following paragraphs. It is noted that the agroecosystems under investigation (cultivated fields and hedgerows) are from the region Krya Brysi, Giannitsa and were under similar microclimatic conditions and of similar soil properties. The cultivated systems, organic (under conversion and certified) and conventional, where of the same perennial crop, namely Asparagus officinalis, and differed regarding fertilization and weed control. ## In the first chapter biocommunities of nematodes are studied in terms of trophic and generic structure, life strategy and diversity, in soils under asparagus cultivation managed conventionally and organically. Natural hedgerows bordering both types of cultivations are also studied as reference systems. The decomposer feeding group (bacterivores and fungivores), accounts for 80 % of the total nematode abundance under organic cultivation, while under conventional for 45 %. The dominant trophic group under the latter is that of <b>phytoparasites,</b> {{which is responsible for}} the higher Plant Parasitic Index (PPI). The low generic diversity and the strong dominance pattern under conventional cultivation indicate a stressed soil environment. In the organically managed system, diversity is almost as high as in natural hedgerows, with nematode numbers evenly distributed among genera. However, in hedgerows intermediate abundances of bacterial, fungal and plant feeders are recorded, and the Maturity Index (MI) and Plant Parasitic Index (PPI) are higher than those of the organically managed system, indicating that organic farming results to a more vigorous, pre-mature and probably more productive soil rather than to a more ‘natural’ one. ...|$|R
