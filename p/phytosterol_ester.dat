40|$|Fatty acyl esters of {{phytosterols}} {{are a major}} form of sterol conjugates {{distributed in}} many parts of plants. In this study we report an Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) gene, AtSAT 1 (At 3 g 51970), which encodes for a novel sterol O-acyltransferase. When expressed in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), AtSAT 1 mediated production of sterol esters enriched with lanosterol. Enzyme property assessment using cell-free lysate of yeast expressing AtSAT 1 suggested the enzyme preferred cycloartenol as acyl acceptor and saturated fatty acyl-Coenyzme A as acyl donor. Taking a transgenic approach, we showed that Arabidopsis seeds overexpressing AtSAT 1 accumulated fatty acyl esters of cycloartenol, accompanied by substantial decreases in ester content of campesterol and β-sitosterol. Furthermore, fatty acid components of sterol esters from the transgenic lines were enriched with saturated and long-chain fatty acids. The enhanced AtSAT 1 expression resulted in decreased level of free sterols, but the total sterol content in the transgenic seeds increased by up to 60 % compared to that in wild type. We conclude that AtSAT 1 mediates <b>phytosterol</b> <b>ester</b> biosynthesis, alternative to the route previously described for phospholipid:sterol acyltransferase, and provides the molecular basis for modification of <b>phytosterol</b> <b>ester</b> level in seeds...|$|E
40|$|Phytosterols {{and their}} fatty acyl esters {{have been known}} for decades to lower LDL cholesterol, making them {{powerful}} nutraceuticals in lowering cardiovascular disease risk. The mechanisms by which phytosterols lower cholesterol, though, have been incompletely characterized. Three studies were executed to examine three aspects of cholesterol and phytosterol interactions in the intestinal lumen. In the first study, the ability of pancreatic cholesterol esterase to hydrolyze phytosterol esters was examined. Pancreatic cholesterol esterase hydrolyzed phytosterol esters, but the rate of hydrolysis proved sensitive to the structures of both the sterol and ester components. In the second study, cholesterol micellarization was challenged with phytosterols, phytosterol esters, and simulated hydrolysis products of phytosterol esters. Phytosterols inhibited cholesterol incorporation into micelles, {{but there was little}} difference in effects among the phytosterols. Investigation of the influence of fatty acids, simulating the effects of <b>phytosterol</b> <b>ester</b> hydrolysis, demonstrated a moderate increase in cholesterol micellarization in the presence of unsaturated, but not saturated, fatty acids. Intact esters, however, did not alter cholesterol micellarization, nor did the esters themselves incorporate into micelles. In the third study, phytosterol esters and ethers possessing differential stability towards hydrolysis were incorporated into diets administered to hamsters. The lipids in the intestinal lumen of the hamsters did not show a hydrolysis-dependent partitioning of cholesterol between aqueous and oily phases, as was hypothesized. The extent of hydrolysis of phytosterol esters, however, was strongly and negatively correlated with cholesterol absorption efficiency. Treatment-associated changes to lipid profiles of the intestinal contents were also observed. These studies thus demonstrated that pancreatic cholesterol esterase is likely responsible for <b>phytosterol</b> <b>ester</b> hydrolysis in the intestine; competition for micellarization by free phytosterols explains some of their efficacy, while the exclusion of phytosterol esters from micelles implies hydrolysis must first take place for esters to affect this mechanism; and the extent of hydrolysis of phytosterol esters is a strong determinant of <b>phytosterol</b> <b>ester</b> efficacy. These conclusions may be useful in guiding phytosterol formulations for maximizing cholesterol-lowering efficacy. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate in depth the non-isothermal crystallization and melting behavior of binary blends of palm oil (PO) with a commercial, multi-component <b>phytosterol</b> <b>ester</b> (PE) mixture. DSC and time-resolved synchrotron X-ray diffraction (XRD) experiments were conducted on blends with a PE concentration from 0 to 100 % at intervals of 10 % for DSC and 20 % for XRD. Based on XRD, two different ordered structures were identified in pure the PEs. The structure designated as PEx was truly crystalline and needed a very high degree of supercooling for its nucleation from the melt. The structure designated PEy formed without supercooling and showed long-range order with multiple reflections at small angles but only one broad reflection at high angle, typical of liquid crystalline samples. Furthermore, PEy had a high tolerance for molecules of different chemical nature. In the PE-PO blends no other ordered structures were formed other than the ones observed in the pure PEs and PO. The peaks in the DSC runs of the PE-PO blends were linked to transitions of the different polymorphic forms. All structural information of the binary blends as a function of concentration and temperature was collected in morphology maps.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: As {{opposed to}} {{traditional}} food based delivery {{we examined the}} efficacy of ingesting encapsulated phytosterol esters on indices of lipid health in hypercholesterolemic adults. METHODS: We performed a randomized, double-blinded, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, clinical intervention examining 54 men and women (20 - 70 y of age) with a low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) level > /= 3. 33 mmol/L. Participants were not taking cholesterol-lowering medications. Treatment consisted of ingesting 2. 6 g of encapsulated phytosterol esters (n = 25) or a matching placebo (n = 29) for 12 wk. RESULTS: Total cholesterol (TC) levels at baseline (mean +/- SD) were 6. 29 +/- 0. 7 mmol/L in the phytosterol group and 6. 00 +/- 0. 7 mmol/L in the placebo group. Baseline LDL-C levels were 4. 27 +/- 0. 7 mmol/L in the treatment group and 4. 00 +/- 0. 8 mmol/L in the placebo group. Analysis of variance and Tukey's least significant difference post hoc analyses revealed a significant within-group reduction in TC (- 0. 23 +/- 0. 4 mmol/L, P < 0. 05) and LDL-C (- 0. 22 +/- 0. 5 mmol/L, P < 0. 05) for the phytosterol treatment group. Mean reductions in TC and LDL-C were greater than placebo (P < 0. 05). Percentages of change from baseline for TC were - 3. 52 % (95 % confidence interval - 6. 44 to - 0. 40) for phytosterol treatment and 2. 64 % (95 % confidence interval 0. 30 - 5. 60) for placebo.

40|$|Dietary {{phytosterols}} inhibit intestinal cholesterol absorption {{and regulate}} whole body cholesterol excretion and balance. However, they are biochemically heterogeneous and a portion is glycosylated in some foods with unknown effects on biological activity. We tested {{the hypothesis that}} phytosterol glycosides reduce cholesterol absorption in humans. Phytosterol glycosides were extracted and purified from soy lecithin in a novel two-step process. Cholesterol absorption was measured {{in a series of}} three single-meal tests given at intervals of 2 wk to each of 11 healthy subjects. In a randomized crossover design, participants received ∼ 300 mg of added phytosterols in the form of phytosterol glycosides or <b>phytosterol</b> <b>esters,</b> or placebo in a test breakfast also containing 30 mg cholesterol-d 7.

40|$|The dietary {{impact of}} {{specific}} phytosterols incorporated into <b>phytosterol</b> fatty acid <b>esters</b> {{has not been}} elucidated. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that <b>phytosterol</b> <b>esters</b> containing different sterol moieties (sitosterol, sitostanol, or stigmasterol) but the same fatty acid moiety (stearic acid) produce different effects on cholesterol metabolism. Male Syrian hamsters were fed sitosterol, sitostanol, and stigmasterol stearate esters (25 g/kg diet) in an atherogenic diet containing cholesterol (1. 2 g/kg) and coconut oil (80 g/kg). The phytosterol stearates produced no decrease in cholesterol absorption or plasma non–high-density lipoprotein cholesterol despite a reduction in liver free cholesterol in hamsters fed both sitosterol and sitostanol stearate diets. In addition, sitosterol stearate significantly increased fecal esterified and total neutral sterol excretion. Stigmasterol stearate {{did not differ from}} control in neutral sterol excretion, plasma lipids, or hepatic lipid concentration. Sitosterol stearate demonstrated the highest level of net intestinal hydrolysis, whereas sitostanol and stigmasterol stearate equivalently demonstrated the lowest. The cholesterol-lowering effect in liver—but not plasma—and the limited presence of fecal free sterols indicate that intact (unhydrolyzed) phytosterol stearates may impact cholesterol metabolism by mechanisms unrelated to the role of free phytosterols. The consumption of <b>phytosterol</b> <b>esters</b> at 2. 5 % of the diet elicited only modest impacts on cholesterol metabolism, although sitosterol stearate had a slightly greater therapeutic impact by lowering liver free cholesterol and increasing esterified and total neutral sterol fecal excretion, possibly due to a greater level of intestinal hydrolysis...|$|R

The incorporation of unsaturated fatty acids from SO and PE by milkfat triacylglycerols after chemical reaction caused linearization of consistency curves.

The mechanisms by which phytosterols impart their effects, however, are incompletely characterized. The objective {{of the present study}} is to determine if pancreatic cholesterol esterase (PCE; EC 3. 1. 1. 13), the enzyme primarily responsible for cholesterol ester hydrolysis in the digestive tract, is capable of hydrolyzing various <b>phytosterol</b> <b>esters</b> and to compare the rates of sterol ester hydrolysis in vitro. We found that PCE hydrolyzes palmitate, oleate and stearate esters of cholesterol, stigmasterol, stigmastanol and sitosterol.

The addition of free phytosterols to the system did not change hydrolytic activity of PCE, while addition of palmitate, oleate or stearate increased activity.

Rats were fed diets containing PE at levels of 0, 1. 6, 3. 2 and 8. 1 % (w/w) PE over two successive generations, and a wide range of reproductive and developmental parameters, including sexual maturation parameters and oestrous cycle length, were determined. Macroscopic and microscopic examinations were conducted including a histological examination of selected organs from F 1 - and F 2 -weanlings and from F 0 - and F 1 -parental animals. Daily clinical observations did not reveal any unusual findings. In both generations, no effects of PE were observed on pup mortality (calculated on litter basis), precoital time, mating index, male and female fertility index, female fecundity index, gestation index, duration of gestation, number of females with stillborn pups, post-implantation loss and pup development. Furthermore, PE had no effect on sexual maturation parameters (preputial separation and vaginal opening) and oestrous cycle length. In addition, there were no dose-related effects on selected organs following histological examination. In conclusion, dietary administration of up to 8. 1 % PE (equivalent to a dose of 2. 5 to 9. 1 g PE/kg body weight/day, dependent on the period of the study) during two generations had no effect on reproduction of parental F 0 - and F 1 -generation Wistar rats, nor {{on the development of the}} F 1 - and F 2 -pups, nor on the sexual maturation of the F 1 -weanlings. Therefore, a nominal dietary PE concentration of 8. 1 % (equivalent to a dose of 2. 5 - 9. 1 g PE/kg body weight/day or 1. 54 - 5. 62 g phytosterol/kg body weight/day dependent on the period of the study) was considered to be the no-observed-adverse-effect level following daily oral administration of PE for two successive generations.

40|$|AbstractA dark {{chocolate}} containing <b>phytosterols</b> (PS) <b>esters</b> {{was developed to}} reduce cholesterol in individuals. However, oxidative instability during chocolate processing and storage could reduce the PS bioactivity. Chocolate bars were prepared containing palm oil (CONT) or 2. 2  g of PS (PHYT). All samples were stored at 20  °C and 30  °C during 5 months. A peak of hydroperoxides formation was observed after 60 days at 20  °C and after 30 days at 30  °C. PS-enriched samples presented higher values of hydroperoxides than control samples, which {{could be attributed to}} the higher level of alpha-linolenic acid present in the PHYT samples. All chocolate bars became lighter and softer after 90 days of storage. However, these physical changes did not reduce their sensory acceptability. In addition, PS bioactivity was kept during the storage, since no significant alterations in the PS esters were observed up to 5 months. However, some PS oxidation occurred in the PHYT bars, being sitostanetriol, 6 -ketositosterol, 6 β-hydroxycampesterol and 7 -ketocampesterol the major phytosterol oxidation products (POPs). The POPs/PS ratio was low (0. 001). Therefore, the {{dark chocolate}} bars developed in this study kept their potential functionality after 5 months of storage at room temperature, representing an option as a functional food...|$|R
40|$|Edible {{vegetable}} oils are a valuable {{component of a}} fully mature seed due to their relatively high caloric value, and are mainly the mixtures of triacylglycerols (TG), with different concentration levels. 1, 2 The remaining nonglyceridic fraction consists of different compound classes such as hydro-carbons, tocopherols, <b>phytosterols</b> and sterol <b>esters.</b> 3 - 10 The separation of TG in edible {{vegetable oils}} has been studied by {{a wide range of}} techniques such as gas chromato-graphy (GC), 11 - 13 liquid chromatography (LC), 14, 15 super-and sub-critical fluid chromatography (SFC and SubFC), 16, 17 and capillary electrochromatography (CEC). 18 The most common approach to the analysis of TG is to release free fatty acid (FA) and perform GC or GC-mass spectrometry (MS) after derivatization, for example, methylation.

40|$|Two {{plant species}} of the genus Anthriscus (A. sylvestris and A. cerefolium) and Laserpitium latifolium L. are {{described}} as {{a good source of}} new aroma constituents and phytosterols. These plants are the herbs widely distributed in Serbia and possess significant medicinal value. They are widely applied in traditional medicine, but they are not used as functional food or in food technology. Two well-known domestic aromatic plant species: Mentha piperita L. and Thymus vulgaris L. and the lesser known Alliaria officinalis Andrz. are described as a good sources of highly prized essential oils in several wild-growing herbs. They are traditionally used in cooking. Quinoa seeds considered as multipurpose agro-industrial crop and the seeds may be utilized for human food and in flour products and in animal feed stocks because of its high nutritive value. Furthermore, watermelon meal possesses good nutritional quality, which may be commercially used as a new feed in the human or in the cattle nutrition. Seed oils, from Rubus ideaus, Ribes nigrum and walnut are also presented. The chemical composition on the sterols and essential fatty acids content, of these seed oils are shown that some of them can be successfully used in human nutrition, under specific conditions. Finally, developing new cholesterol-reducing products, such as <b>phytosterols</b> and their <b>esters,</b> which are marked as cholesterol-reducing food ingredient as well as the information on its incorporation into foods, are also included...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{measure the}} {{relative}} effects {{of each of}} four phytosterol ester-enriched low-fat foods (bread, breakfast cereal, milk and yoghurt) on serum lipids, plasma phytosterols and carotenoids. DESIGN:: Three research centres undertook a randomised, incomplete crossover, single-blind study consisting of four treatment periods of 3 weeks each, {{one of which was}} a control period. Each sterol-enriched test food provided 1. 6 g/day of <b>phytosterols</b> as sterol <b>esters.</b> SETTING: General Community. SUBJECTS: In all 58, free-living men and women with mean age (s. d.) 54 (8) y, moderately elevated plasma total cholesterol 6. 2 (0. 7) mmol/l and body mass index 26. 2 (3. 0) kg/m(2). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Serum lipids, plasma phytosterols and carotenoids. RESULTS: Serum total and LDL cholesterol levels were significantly lowered by consumption of phytosterol-enriched foods: milk (8. 7 and 15. 9 %) and yoghurt (5. 6 and 8. 6 %). Serum LDL cholesterol levels fell significantly by 6. 5 % with bread and 5. 4 % with cereal. They were both significantly less efficacious than sterol-enriched milk (P< 0. 001). Plasma sitosterol increased by 17 - 23 % and campesterol by 48 - 52 % with phytosterol-enriched milk and bread. Lipid-adjusted beta-carotene was lowered by 5 - 10 % by sterols in bread and milk, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to demonstrate that cholesterol-lowering effects of plant sterol esters may differ according to the food matrix. Plant sterols in low-fat milk was almost three times more effective than in bread and cereal. Despite phytosterol-enriched cereal products resulting in lower serum cholesterol reductions compared to sterol-enriched milk, the detection of similar changes in plasma phytosterols demonstrated that such products still delivered and released phytosterols to the gut...|$|R
40|$|Cholesterol {{absorption}} {{is frequently}} determined using the plasma dual stable-isotope ratio method (PDSIRM). However, this method involves intravenous injection of stableisotope-labeled cholesterol with simultaneous oral administration of differently labeled cholesterol, {{which results in}} high study costs and involves additional ethical considerations. The objective {{of the present study}} was to validate a simpler singleisotope method for determining cholesterol absorption against PDSIRM by using data from two previous studies. Enrichments of carbon- 13 (93 C) and deuterium in red blood cells were analyzed by using differential isotope ratio MS. The area under the curve of 93 C-enrichment in the plasma free-cholesterol pool was found to be significantly correlated with cholesterol absorption measured by using PDSIRM for study 1 (r = 0. 85, P < 0. 0001) and study 2 (r = 0. 81, P < 0. 0001). Average 93 C-enrichment correlated with the area under the curve of 93 C-enrichment in the plasma free cholesterol for both study 1 (r = 0. 98, P < 0. 0001) and study 2 (r = 1. 00, P < 0. 0001). Study 1 examined the efficacy and mechanisms of unesterified plant sterols and stanols on lipid profiles in hypercholesterolemic men and women, while study 2 investigated the effects of <b>phytosterol</b> vs. phytostanol <b>esters</b> on plasma lipid levels and cholesterol kinetics in hyperlipidemic men. Experimental approaches to determine cholesterol absorption were identical between the two studies. Consequently, in both studies, correlations (r = 0. 88, P < 0. 0001 for study 1, and r = 0. 82, P < 0. 0001 for study 2) were found between the average 93 C-enrichment of plasma free cholesterol and cholesterol absorption measured by PDSIRM. These results suggest that a single-isotope-labeled cholesterol tracer approach can be used as a reliable noninvasive method to replace PDSIRM for examining changes in cholesterol absorption.
