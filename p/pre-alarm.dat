50|$|For added {{security}} centralized {{storage is}} frequently used to record alarm video for easy alarm verification and long-term secure storage. <b>Pre-alarm</b> recording {{is offered by}} introducing a buffer in the encoder so that the seconds or minutes of video before and after an alarm can be automatically transmitted to the centralized storage. Because of the huge edge storage capacities of some encoders, ranging from 256 MB to 800 GB, you can continuously record video at high frame rates and high resolutions, and still take advantage of <b>pre-alarm</b> recording. For instance, if you continuously transmit a 1 Mbit/s stream (30 IPS at 4 CIF) to a central recorder in the anticipation that an alarm event will occur, you will consume 1 Mbit/s of network bandwidth, or send about 11 Gigabytes of video data. If, however, you use recording at the edge, and use <b>pre-alarm</b> recording configured to 5 seconds pre- and 10 seconds post-alarm, then assuming 20 alarms per day you will transmit a much lower total of around 40 Megabytes of video. The same 11 GB will still be recorded locally but only 40 MB, or 0.4% of it, will touch the network.|$|E
50|$|School {{life changed}} tremendously during World War II. Young {{teachers}} were conscripted in 1939 and 1940 so that older teachers taught two {{classes at the}} same time. Additionally, students from the Diesterweg School had been incorporated. Parts of the basement had been converted {{to be used as}} a dugout and were located where the fitness room is nowadays. After the raid on Poland and a growing fear of a chemical warfare, the decontamination squad was deployed in the basement of the school building as well.In January and February 1940, the school had to close because of the freezing temperatures in the classrooms and the absence of heating fuel. Students were required to keep a diary with their experiences about the war and to collect donations. The school garden was used to cultivate vegetables to feed the people.In the school year of 1942 and 1943, sirens were installed on the roof to warn students and people living near the school. If possible, students were sent home after hearing the <b>pre-alarm.</b> At the beginning of 1945, the first refugees came and two classrooms of the boys school were furnished for the homeless. Parts of the girls school served as a sickbay. For 37 classes with up to 40 students each, there were only 20 rooms available anymore. Lessons were shortened or sometimes even shut down because of missing heating fuel.With the beginning of air raids, the school was completely shut down. The bombings destroyed the protectory right next to school and killed 39 children. The windows, the whole tower and parts of the roof were destroyed. Several class rooms caught fire. The upcoming months, only teachers were allowed to enter the school building to start clearing work. 22 students who visited the school, died during the war.|$|E
40|$|Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) {{have been}} {{utilized}} for node fault diagnosis {{in the fire}} detection field since the 1990 s. However, the traditional methods have some problems, including complicated system structures, intensive computation needs, unsteady data detection and local minimum values. In this paper, a new diagnosis mechanism for WSN nodes is proposed, {{which is based on}} fuzzy theory and an Adaptive Fuzzy Discrete Hopfield Neural Network (AF-DHNN). First, the original status of each sensor over time is obtained with two features. One is the root mean square of the filtered signal (FRMS), the other is the normalized summation of the positive amplitudes of the difference spectrum between the measured signal and the healthy one (NSDS). Secondly, distributed fuzzy inference is introduced. The evident abnormal nodes’ status is <b>pre-alarmed</b> to save time. Thirdly, according to the dimensions of the diagnostic data, an adaptive diagnostic status system is established with a Fuzzy C-Means Algorithm (FCMA) and Sorting and Classification Algorithm to reducing the complexity of the fault determination. Fourthly, a Discrete Hopfield Neural Network (DHNN) with iterations is improved with the optimization of the sensors’ detected status information and standard diagnostic levels, with which the associative memory is achieved, and the search efficiency is improved. The experimental results show that the AF-DHNN method can diagnose abnormal WSN node faults promptly and effectively, which improves the WSN reliability...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Gas turbine (GT) fault {{detection}} plays {{a vital role}} in the minimization of power plant operation costs associated with power plant overhaul time intervals. In other words, it is helpful in generating <b>pre-alarms</b> and paves the way for corrective actions in due time before incurring major equipment failures. Hence, nding an ecient {{fault detection}} technique that is applicable in the online operation of power plants involved with minor computations is an urgent need in the power generation industry. Such a method is studied in this paper for the V 94. 2 class of GTs. As the most leading stage for developing a feature-based fault detection system and moving from a xed time-scheduled maintenance to a condition-based one, principal component analysis is used for dimension reduction in the sensor data space and dimensionless key features are employed instead. One healthy condition and 6 faulty conditions are used to provide a realistic data set that is used for feature extraction, training, and testing articial neural networks. In the proposed method, multilayer perceptron (MLP) and learning vector quantization (LVQ) networks are used for the fault classi cation. The good performance of the LVQ networks is presented by properly selecting the network architecture and respective initial weight vectors. When comparing the results of the MLP and LVQ networks for the fault classication, the LVQ network shows better classication results...|$|R
40|$|Estimating and {{predicting}} degradation {{processes of}} engineering assets {{is crucial for}} reducing the cost and insuring the productivity of enterprises. Assisted by modern condition monitoring (CM) technologies, most asset degradation processes can be revealed by various degradation indicators extracted from CM data. Maintenance strategies developed using these degradation indicators (i. e. condition-based maintenance) are more cost-effective, because unnecessary maintenance activities are avoided when an asset is still in a decent health state. A practical difficulty in condition-based maintenance (CBM) is that degradation indicators extracted from CM data can only partially reveal asset health states in most situations. Underestimating this uncertainty in relationships between degradation indicators and health states can cause excessive false alarms or failures without <b>pre-alarms.</b> The state space model provides an efficient approach to describe a degradation process using these indicators that can only partially reveal health states. However, existing state space models that describe asset degradation processes largely depend on assumptions such as, discrete time, discrete state, linearity, and Gaussianity. The discrete time assumption requires that failures and inspections only happen at fixed intervals. The discrete state assumption entails discretising continuous degradation indicators, which requires expert knowledge and often introduces additional errors. The linear and Gaussian assumptions are not consistent with nonlinear and irreversible degradation processes in most engineering assets. This research proposes a Gamma-based state space model {{that does not have}} discrete time, discrete state, linear and Gaussian assumptions to model partially observable degradation processes. Monte Carlo-based algorithms are developed to estimate model parameters and asset remaining useful lives. In addition, this research also develops a continuous state partially observable semi-Markov decision process (POSMDP) to model a degradation process that follows the Gamma-based state space model and is under various maintenance strategies. Optimal maintenance strategies are obtained by solving the POSMDP. Simulation studies through the MATLAB are performed; case studies using the data from an accelerated life test of a gearbox and a liquefied natural gas industry are also conducted. The results show that the proposed Monte Carlo-based EM algorithm can estimate model parameters accurately. The results also show that the proposed Gamma-based state space model have better fitness result than linear and Gaussian state space models when used to process monotonically increasing degradation data in the accelerated life test of a gear box. Furthermore, both simulation studies and case studies show that the prediction algorithm based on the Gamma-based state space model can identify the mean value and confidence interval of asset remaining useful lives accurately. In addition, the simulation study shows that the proposed maintenance strategy optimisation method based on the POSMDP is more flexible than that assumes a predetermined strategy structure and uses the renewal theory. Moreover, the simulation study also shows that the proposed maintenance optimisation method can obtain more cost-effective strategies than a recently published maintenance strategy optimisation method by optimising the next maintenance activity and the waiting time till the next maintenance activity simultaneously...|$|R

40|$|Spectrum sensing is {{critical}} for cognitive systems to locate spectrum holes. In the IEEE 802. 22 proposal, short quiet periods are arranged inside frames to perform a coarse intra-frame sensing as a <b>pre-alarm</b> for fine inter-frame sensing. However, the limited sample size of the quiet periods may not guarantee a satisfying performance and an additional burden of quiet-period synchronization is required. To improve the sensing performance, we first propose a quiet-active sensing scheme in which inactive customer-provided equipments (CPEs) will sense the channels in both the quiet and active periods. To avoid quiet-period synchronization, we further propose to utilize (optimized) active sensing, in which the quiet periods are replaced by 'quiet samples' in other domains, such as quiet sub-carriers in OFDMA systems. By doing so, we not only save the need for synchronization, but also achieve selection diversity by choosing quiet sub-carriers based on channel conditions. The proposed active sensing scheme is also promising for spectrum sharing applications where both the cognitive and primary systems can be active simultaneously. © 2010 IEEE...|$|E
30|$|While some {{commanding}} officers {{reported that}} they would begin to call in off-duty staff at the ochre warning level, others would only begin at a red or purple level. This type of <b>pre-alarm</b> is both a physical stand-by and a mental preparation and usually takes less than 1 h. The so-called “cold situation” (commanding firefighter, control and dispatch center) involves non-personnel preparatory measures concerning vehicles and equipment (for example, submersible pumps or chainsaws) and personnel preparatory measures like calling in additional dispatchers to the command center, reallocating staff within the jurisdiction, or activating special units like wild fire units. Some fire brigades report that they make use of “scouts” (Erkunder), usually one person (with emergency management qualification) in a small vehicle. That person takes {{a closer look at}} the reported disruption and decides whether (and with what priority) or not any actions should be taken if the information provided by the emergency call remains uncertain. Not all fire brigades take such stand-by measures, and they are more common in cities than in rural areas. During an event it might be necessary to issue a second alarm, which means extending personnel’s length of service, reallocating personnel, or calling in off-duty units and volunteer firefighters.|$|E
40|$|In this article, {{the staff}} pre-warning delay concept is developed: {{the time between}} staff {{becoming}} aware of an incident by receiving a <b>pre-alarm,</b> or {{as a result of}} other cues, and the raising of a general alarm. This represents the potential delay in staff response as they interpret the cues received and engage in various response behaviors before warning the population and raising a general alarm; a delay that may be procedural and/or cognitive. The theoretical basis for this concept is discussed, examples of incidents involving this delay described and data from experiments and incidents examined to help demonstrate and estimate the impact and the effects upon the available safe escape time/required safe escape time calculation. Hypothetical examples of how pre-warning delay can influence required safe escape time are presented, along with a discussion of the aspects of emergency procedures that are particularly susceptible to this type of delay. A framework for understanding these susceptibilities is suggested, together with proposals for dealing with this aspect in engineering designs so as to evaluate and minimize its impact on escape time. This concept is considered important as the exclusion of a (potentially sizable) delay from the engineering design may lead to artificially optimistic results being produced...|$|E
40|$|A {{study on}} the {{application}} of surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) in detecting biological threats is here reported. Simulants of deadly Bacillus anthracis endospores were used. This study proposes an automated device where SERS {{is used as a}} fast, <b>pre-alarm</b> technique of a two-stage sensor equipped with a real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). In order to check the potentialities of SERS in terms of sensitivity and specificity for on-site, real-time, automatic detection and identification of biological agents, two strains of genetically and harmless closely B. anthracis-related spores, Bacillus thuringiensis and Bacillus atrophaeus, were used as simulants. In order to assure the selectivity of the SERS substrate against B. thuringiensis spores, the substrate was functionalized by specific peptides. The obtained SERS measurements are classified as positive or negative hits by applying a special data evaluation based on the Euclidian distance between each spectrum and a reference spectrum of blank measurement. Principal component analysis (PCA) was applied for discriminating between different strains representing dangerous and harmless spores. The results show that the SERS sensor is capable of detecting a few tenths of spores in a few minutes, and is particularly sensitive and fast for this purpose. Post-process analysis of the spectra allowed for discrimination between the contaminated and uncontaminated SERS sensors and even between different strains of spores, although not as clearly. For this purpose, the use of a non-functionalized SERS substrate is suggested...|$|E
30|$|Future {{research}} {{will have to}} clarify {{the relationship of the}} factors identified in the present review. Specifically, three future research steps are necessary: (1) Development of a self-report questionnaire of RP for fire evacuation that meets common quality criteria of psychometric testing. The variety in which perceived risk was measured in the studies reviewed in the present article indicates that a common standard to study RP during fire evacuation is necessary. An objective, reliable, and valid questionnaire is necessary to understand RP during fire evacuation. (2) Identification of specific effects of perceived risk during the <b>pre-alarm</b> and the protective action phase of a fire emergency. Controlled laboratory studies which systematically manipulate RP could shed light on how perceived risk influences RSET. One possibility could be to manipulate the expectation and emotion component of perceived risk through conditioning (e.g., by presenting aversive stimuli combined with a scenario (context information)) or priming (e.g., by presenting information about fire emergencies) and then confront participants with a hypothetical emergency scenario. Another possibility would be to compare the reaction to fire cues of participants who differ systematically in trait RP (e.g., by comparing reactions of highly fearful and non-fearful participants). (3) Development of a holistic predictive model on the interaction of the factors potentially modulating RP. Although the present review identified a set of factors that most likely influence perceived risk during fire evacuation, it is unclear how strong the effects of individual factors are and how these factors interact with each other.|$|E
40|$|Background Tube-feeding or {{nutritional}} {{support is}} a therapy {{for people who}} can’t get enough nutrition by eating or drinking. You may need it if you have difficulty swallowing, loss of appetite, are severely malnourished or have inability to absorb nutrients through your digestive system. There are several diagnoses associated with tube-feeding, depending on the persons diagnose and users state the user can be tied to the tube-feeding equipment from 3 to 18 hours a day. In Sweden there are around 1500 - 3000 adults in need of tube-feeding outside the hospitals.   Method This report is made by Cindy Sjöblom and is an individual student’s work. The project is her dissertation and final project at the two year Masters program Advanced Product Design at Umeå Institute of Design. The project has been executed during 20 weeks the spring 2015. The project {{is based on the}} design process which includes the following phases; Research & Analysing, Ideation & Concept’s and Detailing & Visualization. The Research & Analysis phase has included; Product analysis, user interviews & observations, market outlook, anatomical knowledge, problem listing and opportunity findings. The Ideation & Concept’s phase has included; Inspiration, persona creation, creative workshop, sketching, concepts creation, mock-up building, user testing & feedback. The Detailing & Visualization phase has included; 3 D modelling, moodboard creation, sketching, final model building, photo shooting, video recording, documentation, presentation and a poster and exhibition stand at Umeå Institute of Design and at Semcon, Gothenburg. Result Tubie is an ambulatory tube-feeding system to facilitate an active everyday life for people in need of enteral nutrition. Tubie consists out of six parts; A nutrition pump and a wireless charging station, a nutrition bag and an external tubing, a wearable waist band and an application for a smart device to be able to control the pump. Unlike traditional enteral nutritions systems, Tubie is designed with a focus on the users in a home environment and their need for a more active lifestyle and discreet usage in social environments. Tubie is simply discreet due to its wearable features that allows the user to wear it underneath the clothing as well as control the pump via a smart device with an adaptable <b>pre-alarm</b> that sounds like any other text message or ring tone...|$|E
30|$|As shown, {{apart from}} the {{coordination}} and deployment of missions {{as a response to}} an event, most measures taken prior to or during emergencies aim to achieve and maintain an organization’s ability to act. While long- and medium-term warnings and weather watches enable emergency organizations to prepare for responding to a potential event, short-term warnings, nowcasting, and regularly updated observational data of the ongoing event enables an organization to act accordingly during an event. Providing information on meteorological uncertainty, such as the probability of rain or the probability of exceeding a certain threshold such as a warning level, makes it possible to deviate from the temporal restrictions of official warnings and to provide information on possible events already in the temporal domain of a weather watch. This allows forecasters “to derive products tailored to specific customers” (Stuart et al. 2006, p. 2). The desired benefit is that this enables end-users of forecast information to start sooner with preparatory protective action based on the end-user’s own risk assessment and decision threshold. However, those developments in meteorology and weather forecasting do not necessarily fit the current practices of the emergency services, that is, rescue and firefighting, as the presented results show. These practices are still mostly carried out based on alarms and ground truth in a superficial reactive manner, rather than through anticipation based on prognosis or forecasts. This is mainly because the specific characteristics of the basic tasks of rescue and firefighting are not predictable per se. Or as Apelt (2014) pointed out, it is unpredictable at what intervals a fire must be extinguished and people must be saved. Demeritt et al. (2013, p. 154) raised more institutional concerns when they linked “legalistic traditions of expert management” with the “tendency to wait for confirmation before acting on medium-term alerts from EPS.” Nonetheless, in the data there are several examples of anticipatory action, including preparatory measures of personnel planning and deployment of equipment. Other measures show signs of a both proactive and reactive character that is preparedness and response. Actions like <b>pre-alarm</b> and adjustments to operational procedures are preparatory—they enable the preparedness to respond. At the same time these actions are reactive, because they are only taken as a response to a manifested event, when a level of tolerance is exceeded (that is, the number of emergency calls, deployments, or missions), or as a response to first indications for an event, more exactly a particular probability of occurrence or a warning level.|$|E
