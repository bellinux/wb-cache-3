40|$|Problem statement: There is {{evidence}} that the addition of 3 % STA-LITE® <b>polydextrose</b> to a dry food reduces the clinical signs of osteoarthritis in dogs. For the application of <b>polydextrose</b> as functional ingredient of dog foods, information as to its impact on the acceptance of food, feces consistency, fecal odor and digestibility of macronutrients and minerals is required. Approach: A feeding experiment with 4 × 4 Latin square design was carried out with 12 adult, healthy Golden Retrievers. The experimental diets consisted of a commercial dry food to which either 0, 2, 4 or 8 % <b>polydextrose</b> was added. During the last 5 days of each two-week feeding period, feces of individual dogs were collected quantitatively. Feces consistency and fecal odor were scored. Fecal pH, fecal Lactobacilli and the apparent digestibility of macronutrients and minerals were determined. Results: The various inclusion levels of <b>polydextrose</b> did not affect food acceptance and intake and did not induce changes in body weight. <b>Polydextrose</b> intake did not influence fecal odor and the amount of feces production. Feces consistency was significantly affected by polydextrose; feces became softer with increasing dose. The apparent digestibilities of dietary dry matter, crude protein, crude fat and ash were not significantly affected by <b>polydextrose</b> intake. The apparent digestibilities of crude fiber and nitrogen-free extract were increased by the addition of <b>polydextrose</b> to the diet. Apparent digestibility of <b>polydextrose</b> was calculated to be 92 % of intake. The high apparent digestibility of <b>polydextrose</b> points at fermentation of this functional ingredient in the hindgut of dogs, but it was not associated with a further lowering of fecal pH and increase in fecal Lactobacilli. Apparent calcium and phosphorus absorption were not significantly affected by <b>polydextrose</b> intake. Conclusion: In the clinical trial on canine osteoarthritis, a <b>polydextrose</b> dose of 3 % in a dry dog food was used. The outcome of this study with healthy dogs indicates that 3 % <b>polydextrose</b> may not have negative effects on the variables that were measured...|$|E

Chicken surimi was produced following a modified procedure of Dawson et al. (1988.) from broiler (Sasso, 12 weeks, 1. 73 kg live wt.). Water content in chicken surimi was 84. 05 % before mixing with added substances. Relations between decrease of the initial freezing point (Ti) as function of mass fractions (w) of the <b>polydextrose</b> were determined by linear regression.

The analysis of these effects included the studying the changes in gel strength, gel whiteness, juiciness, folding, water-holding capacity, protein solubility and the pH level of the surimi. The cryoprotective effectiveness generally increased with the increase in <b>polydextrose</b> content. The highest gel strength, water-holding capacity and protein solubility were maintained by 12 % of <b>polydextrose</b> at 83, 94 and 83 %, respectively; moreover, 32 % of the moisture in juiciness was lost and an average gel whiteness of 76. 33 was maintained over 16 weeks of storage. These values are measured against those of 0 % <b>polydextrose</b> and surimi with 0. 3 % sodium trypolyphosphate. The addition of 6 % <b>polydextrose</b> can maintain the gel strength, water-holding capacity and protein solubility at 82, 97 and 78 %, respectively, lose 28 % of moisture in juiciness and produce an average gel whiteness of 78. 15.

40|$|AbstractIntroduction: Dietary fibers help {{to control}} energy intake {{and reduce the}} risk of {{developing}} obesity. Recent studies show that the consumption of <b>polydextrose</b> reduces energy intake at a subsequent meal. In this systematic review and meta-analysis we examine the subsequent effects of <b>polydextrose</b> on different levels of energy intake (EI). Method: The review followed the PRISMA methodology. Meta-analyses were expressed as Standardized Mean Difference (SMD). A linear regression approach was used to model the relationship between the <b>polydextrose</b> dose and the different levels of EI expressed as a relative change (%). Results: All the studies included in this review administered <b>polydextrose</b> as part of a mid-morning snack. Six studies were included in the analysis of EI at an ad libitum lunch; and three were included in the analysis of EI {{during the rest of the}} day, as well as total daily EI. The meta-analysis showed that the consumption of <b>polydextrose</b> is associated with a reduction in EI at lunch time (SMD[*]=[*] 0. 35; P[*]<[*] 0. 01; I 2 [*]=[*] 0). The dose of <b>polydextrose</b> consumed correlated significantly with this reduction in EI, EILunch (%) [*]=[*]− 0. 67 <b>Polydextrose</b> (g/day) (R 2 [*]=[*] 0. 80; P[*]<[*] 0. 01). The meta-analysis of EI during the rest of the day and daily EI did not show any difference. Nevertheless, the regression equation indicates that there is a dose-dependent effect on the reduction of daily EI, EIDaily (%) [*]=[*]− 0. 35 [*]×[*]Polydextrose (g/day) (R 2 [*]=[*] 0. 68; P[*]<[*] 0. 05). Sex-specific results are consistent with results for the whole group. Conclusion: The studies included in this meta-analysis support the notion that the consumption of <b>polydextrose</b> reduces voluntary energy intake at a subsequent meal.

40|$|Problem statement: Osteoarthritis is an {{inflammatory}} joint disease associated with loss of cartilage matrix. There is suggestive {{evidence that the}} intake of <b>polydextrose</b> fiber has anti-inflammatory activity. It was reasoned that <b>polydextrose</b> may have {{a positive influence on}} canine osteoarthritis. Approach: A double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with privately owned dogs was carried out to assess the efficacy of STA-LITE® <b>polydextrose</b> in the treatment of osteoarthritis. With the use of a questionnaire, five clinical signs were evaluated by the owners. For a period of 8 weeks, the dogs received a complete dry food without or with 3 % <b>polydextrose.</b> There were 16 control and 19 test dogs. Results: The baseline values of the clinical scores for swelling of joints, stiffness and lameness indicated that the severity of osteoarthritis was much less in the test dogs than in the controls. The initial scores for activity and pain were similar in the two groups. Comparing the changes in clinical scores over time between control and test dogs would be biased by the difference in baseline severity of osteoarthritis. On strict terms, a maximum number of pairs of matched control and test dogs was formed for each clinical sign. It was found that all five clinical signs showed more group-mean improvement in the dogs fed the diet containing <b>polydextrose</b> than in those given the control diet. The difference between the pooled group-mean changes of the control and test dogs was statistically significant. As an overall index of the improvement of osteoarthritis, the sum of the changes for the five clinical variables was calculated. <b>Polydextrose</b> was found to induce a marked improvement of osteoarthritis: The polydextrose-mediated increase in the osteoarthritis improvement index was 57 %. Conclusion: <b>Polydextrose</b> can be considered safe and it is suggested that a dose of 3 % in a dry food would be beneficial for dogs with osteoarthritis...|$|E
40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Food ScienceJ. Scott SmithThe {{prevalence}} of diabetes {{along with the}} perceived impact of sugar on health in general has increased the demand for reduced-sugar and sugar-free baked products. Cakes typically contain large quantities of sucrose which affects not only flavor but also color, volume, and texture. This study evaluated the effect of replacing sucrose in white layer cakes with <b>polydextrose</b> and two artificial sweeteners: sucralose and stevia extract. White layer cakes were made using AACCI Method 10 - 90. 01. Batter properties were evaluated by measuring specific gravity. Volume index was measured using a cake template (AACCI Method 10 - 91. 01). Slice area, number of cells, number of holes, and wall thickness of the crumb were calculated and recorded using C-Cell Cake Imaging system. Control batter made with 135 % water had a specific gravity of 0. 90 g/cc and a cake volume index of 112. The cakes had a nicely golden brown, shiny surface. The crumb grain was fine with an even cell distribution. Optimum water level and baking time were obtained for each cake variation. Although replacing sucrose with <b>polydextrose</b> had no significant effect on specific gravity (p> 0. 05), a 25 % replacement resulted in a cake with a volume index of 110, 50 % with an index of 105, 75 % with an index of 103, and 100 % with an index of 97. The crumb grain {{was similar to the}} control cake. Adding sucralose and stevia yielded similar results, where lower volumes were recorded as <b>polydextrose</b> and sucralose/stevia were increased in the cake formula. Complete replacement of sucrose with <b>polydextrose</b> and sucralose or <b>polydextrose</b> and stevia produced an acceptable volume of cake. The number of holes and wall thickness of the crumb was not significantly different in any cake variation.

40|$|High-solid {{biomaterials}} increasingly {{include a}} number of non-starchy polysaccharides, i. e dietary fibre to deliver a range of properties such as structure, storage stability, processability, etc. The first type of high-solid biomaterials analysed this Thesis consists of agarose and co-solute (<b>polydextrose),</b> with the investigation dealing with changes in network morphology of agarose when mixed with <b>polydextrose</b> from low to high-solid preparations. There was a central observation of decline in the mechanical strength of aqueous agarose preparation upon addition of high levels of <b>polydextrose,</b> which {{was accompanied by a}} reduced enthalpic content of the coil-to-helix transition in the polysaccharide network. Glass transition phenomena were observed at subzero temperatures in condensed preparations, hence further arguing for the formation of a lightly cross-linked agarose network with changing solvent quality. The second system consists of high methoxy pectin and co-solute in the form of <b>polydextrose</b> or glucose syrup, with a view to examining the potential of replacing sugar with <b>polydextrose</b> in commercial formulations. Structural properties of pectin preparations were recorded in relation to the molecular weight and concentration of added co-solute in an acidic environment (pH ~ 3. 0). High levels of co-solute induce formation of weak pectin gels at elevated temperatures (even at 95 °C), which upon subsequent cooling exhibit increasing strength and convert to a clear glass at subzero temperatures. Glucose syrup is an efficient plasticiser leading to a reduction in the glass transition temperature of the pectin network, whereas <b>polydextrose</b> assists in the formation of stronger pectin gels in the rubbery state and accelerated vitrification properties. The investigation on the third system, gelatin and <b>polydextrose</b> as the co-solute, focused on the understanding of structural behaviour {{in the presence of the}} non-sugar co-solute and in comparison with polysaccharides. A progression in the mechanical strength and thermal stability of the gelatin network was observed with the addition of <b>polydextrose</b> to the system, which was distinct from that of polysaccharide/co-systems. Combined thermomechanical and microscopy evidence argues for the development of phase separation phenomenon between protein and co-solute in high-solid preparations, where gelatin maintains helical conformation to provide network integrity as well as glassy consistency at subzero temperature. Again, that was distinct from the state of a single-phase system and “molecular dissolution” of polysaccharides in a high-content co-solute environment. At the high solids regime, glassy consistency was treated with theoretical frameworks from the synthetic polymer research to pinpoint the glass transition temperature of the gelatin/co-solute preparation. The fourth system consisting of agarose, gelatin, and co-solute (<b>polydextrose)</b> was investigated from low to high levels of total solids, with a view to examining the phase behaviour of binary biopolymer mixtures that may lead to compositional adjustments in preparations. Agarose and gelatin form non-interactive bicontinuous phases in the aqueous environment. Systematic increase in the concentration of <b>polydextrose</b> prevents the formation of a stable agarose network, with the polysaccharide chains dispersing in the high-solid environment. Gelatin, on the contrary, retains its conformational stability even at a saturating co-solute environment through enhanced protein structuring...|$|E

Each condition varied according to the yoghurt formulation administered: a control yoghurt (C, yoghurt+ 25 g sucrose) and three experimental yoghurts (X, yoghurt+ 25 g xylitol; P, yoghurt+ 25 g polydextrose; and XP, yoghurt+ 12. 5 g xylitol and 12. 5 g <b>polydextrose).</b> Each condition lasted for 10 d during which volunteers consumed 200 g yoghurt on each day. On days 1 and 10, the short- and medium-term effects of yoghurt consumption were assessed by measuring ad libitum lunch intake and subjective motivation to eat. The three experimental yoghurts (X, P and XP) induced a slight suppression of energy intake compared with the control (C) yoghurt, but the differences were not statistically significant. However, when the energy content of the yoghurt pre-loads were accounted for, {{there was a significant}} suppression of energy intake for P compared with C (P= 0. 002). The XP yoghurt induced a significantly stronger satiating effect (increase in subjective fullness) compared with C, both with (P= 0. 003) and without (P< 0. 001) the differential in energy content of the yoghurt pre-loads accounted for. The study demonstrated that pre-loads of xylitol and <b>polydextrose</b> caused a mild increase in satiety and suppression of energy intake, and that the effects persist after repeated daily administration. The effects exerted by the formulations containing xylitol and <b>polydextrose</b> did not arise from the differences in energy content of the yoghurt per se. Therefore, the usefulness of xylitol and <b>polydextrose</b> as ingredients in functional foods for appetite control are {{as a result of their}} lower energy content and suppression of appetite...|$|E
40|$|This study {{deals with}} {{development}} of a "dulce de leche" (DL) with coffee, with low caloric content and functional properties. Through rotational central composite design, eleven DLs were formulated with different <b>polydextrose</b> and sucralose levels. The results were analyzed by means of response surface and ANOVA. The addition of <b>polydextrose</b> led {{to the increase in}} moisture and water activity and reduction in the ash and soluble solids contents. In the formulations with greater levels of sucralose and <b>polydextrose,</b> there was an increase in the ash, acid and fiber content. Greater yield was achieved with greater concentrations of <b>polydextrose</b> and less substitution of sucrose by sucralose, allowing {{development of a}} new functional product with low caloric content. Esta pesquisa trata do desenvolvimento de um doce de leite com café, de baixo valor calórico e funcional. Por meio do delineamento composto central rotacional, foram formulados onze doces de leite com diferentes níveis de polidextrose e sucralose. Os resultados foram analisados por meio de superfície de resposta e ANOVA. A adição da polidextrose influenciou no aumento da umidade e atividade de água e redução nos teores de cinza e sólidos solúveis. Nas formulações com maiores níveis de sucralose e polidextrose, houve incremento no teor de cinza, acidez e fibras. Maiores rendimentos foram alcançados com maiores concentrações de polidextrose e menor substituição de sacarose por sucralose, possibilitando o desenvolvimento de um novo produto de baixo valor calórico e funcional...|$|E
40|$|The cryoprotective {{effects of}} lactitol, maltodextrin, palatinit, <b>polydextrose,</b> {{trehalose}} on the protein denaturation of threadfin bream surimi during {{six months of}} frozen storage were investigated. The characteristics analyzed were Ca 2 þ-ATPase activity, protein solubility, sulfhydryl (SH) content, electrophoresis, surface morphology, and thermal stability. The effectiveness of all cryoprotectants generally decreased as the storage time increased. <b>Polydextrose</b> was able to maintain Ca 2 þ-ATPase activity, protein solubility, and SH content of 33. 5 %, 71. 3 %, 71. 8 %, respectively. Sucrose was able to maintain Ca 2 þ-ATPase activity, protein solubility, and SH content of 32. 4 %, 68. 1 %, 75. 6 %, respectively. Electrophoresis showed that the myosin heavy chain (MHC) and actin band intensity almost disappeared {{by the end of}} storage. Analysis by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) demonstrated that the number of pores formed increased after storage. Thermal stability analysis showed a decrease in myosin but no significant change in actin content. This study suggests that <b>polydextrose</b> as a cryoprotectant is able to maintain protein from denaturation as the same as sucrose...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{degradation}} {{rules of}} glycan in reed ethanol/water cooking process were studied. The degradation rules of <b>polydextrose</b> and polyxylose were {{obtained in the}} cooking process by means of ion chromatography determination of glucose and xylose in the reed ethanol pulp content under different holding time. Results showed that cellulose (<b>polydextrose)</b> removal rate obviously was divided into two stages, rapid removal stage at the holding time of 0 - 90 min and slow removal stage at the holding time of 90 - 210 min; hemicellulose (xylan) removal rate was also divided into two stages, slow removal stage at the holding time of 0 - 60 min and rapid removal stage at the holding time from 60 min until the end; meanwhile the change rules of lignin and ash content were achieved...|$|E
40|$|The {{simultaneous}} {{effects of}} different binary co-cultures of Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus bulgaricus, Lactobacillus rhamnosus and Bifidobacterium lactis with Streptococcus thermophilus and of different prebiotics {{on the production}} of fermented milk were investigated in this paper. In particular, we determined and compared the kinetics of acidification of milk either as such or supplemented with 4 % (w/w) maltodextrin, oligofructose and <b>polydextrose,</b> {{as well as the}} probiotic survival, chemical composition (pH, lactose, lactic acid and protein contents), fatty acids profile and conjugate linoleic acid (CIA) content of fermented milk after storage at 4 degrees C for 24 h. Fermented milk quality was strongly influenced both by the co-culture composition and the selected prebiotic. Depending on the co-culture, prebiotic addition to milk influenced to different extent kinetic acidification parameters. All probiotic counts were stimulated by oligofructose and <b>polydextrose,</b> and among these B. lactis always exhibited the highest counts in all supplemented milk samples. <b>Polydextrose</b> addition led to the highest post-acidification. Although the contents of the main fatty acids were only barely influenced. the highest amounts of conjugated linoleic acid (38 % higher than in the control) were found in milk fermented by S. thermophilus-L. acidophilus co-culture and supplemented with maltodextrin.

40|$|This {{investigation}} {{focuses on}} understanding the phase behaviour of gelatin when mixed with <b>polydextrose</b> (co-solute) primarily at high solid concentrations. The experimental work {{was carried out}} using small deformation dynamic oscillation in shear, modulated differential scanning calorimetry, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, wide angle X-ray diffraction and environmental scanning electron microscopy. A progression in the mechanical strength and thermal stability of the gelatin network was observed {{with the addition of}} <b>polydextrose</b> to the system. Combined thermomechanical and microscopy evidence argues for the development of phase separation phenomenon between protein and co-solute in high-solid preparations, where gelatin maintains helical conformation to provide network integrity as well as glassy consistency at subzero temperature. At the high solids regime, glassy consistency was treated with theoretical frameworks from the synthetic polymer research to pinpoint the glass transition temperature of the syste...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Subjective {{feelings}} of appetite are measured using visual analogue scales (VAS) in controlled trials. However, {{the methods used}} to analyze VAS during the Satiation (pre- to post-meal) and Satiety (post-meal to subsequent meal) periods vary broadly, {{making it difficult to}} compare results amongst independent studies testing the same product. This review proposes a methodology to analyze VAS during both the Satiation and Satiety periods, allowing us to compare results in a meta-analysis. Methods: A methodology to express VAS results as incremental areas under the curve (iAUC) for both the Satiation and Satiety periods is proposed using <b>polydextrose</b> as a case study. Further, a systematic review and meta-analysis on subjective {{feelings of}} appetite was conducted following the PRISMA methodology. Meta-analyses were expressed as Standardized Mean Difference (SMD). Results: Seven studies were included in the meta-analysis. There were important differences in the methods used to analyze appetite ratings amongst these studies. The separate subjective feelings of appetite reported were Hunger, Satisfaction, Fullness, Prospective Food Consumption, and the Desire to Eat. The method proposed here allowed the results of the different studies to be homogenized. The meta-analysis showed that Desire to Eat during the Satiation period favors <b>polydextrose</b> for the reduction of this subjective feeling of appetite (SMD = 0. 24, I 2 < 0. 01, p = 0. 018); this effect was also significant in the sub-analysis by sex for the male population (SMD = 0. 35, I 2 < 0. 01, p = 0. 015). There were no other significant results. Conclusion: It is possible to compare VAS results from separate studies. The assessment of iAUC for both the Satiation and Satiety periods generates results of homogeneous magnitudes. This case study demonstrates, for the first time, that <b>polydextrose</b> reduces the Desire to Eat during the Satiation period. This may explain, at least in part, the observed effects of <b>polydextrose</b> on the reduction of levels of energy intake at subsequent meals...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{concept of}} {{prebiotic}} edible films as effective vehicles for encapsulating probiotic living cells is presented. Four soluble fibres (inulin, <b>polydextrose,</b> glucose-oligosaccharides and wheat dextrin) were selected as prebiotic co-components of gelatine based matrices plasticised with glycerol {{and used for}} the immobilisation of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG. The addition of prebiotics {{was associated with a}} more compact and uniform film structure, with no detectable interspaces or micropores; probiotic inclusion did not significantly change the structure of the films. Glucose-oligosaccharides and <b>polydextrose</b> significantly enhanced L. rhamnosus GG viability during air drying (by 300 % and 75 %, respectively), whilst a 33 % and 80 % reduction in viable counts was observed for inulin and wheat dextrin. Contrarily, inulin was the most effective at controlling the sub-lethal effects on L. rhamnosus GG during storage. However, in all cases the supplementation of edible films with prebiotics ameliorated the storage stability of L. rhamnosus GG...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Pogaca is a {{traditional}} high-fat bakery product in Turkey. This {{study was conducted to}} evaluate the effect of fat replacement in pogaca formulation by various amounts (5, 10 and 15 g on 100 g wheat flour basis) of inulin, <b>polydextrose</b> and maltodextrin on the properties of dough and quality of pogaca. Dough stickiness values were increased by increasing the amount of fat replacer at the all fat reduction levels (20, 30 and 40 %) studied. Extensibility and resistance to extension values of dough were also significantly changed due to the fat replacement. Sensory analysis of pogaca showed that the formulations prepared by maltodextrin and <b>polydextrose</b> generally received higher scores than the formulation prepared by inulin. Overall, it was observed that up to 30 % of the fat can be replaced in pogaca formulation without any decrease in the physical, textural and sensory quality of pogaca...|$|E
