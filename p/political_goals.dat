5|$|One of Sikorski's <b>political</b> <b>goals</b> was the {{creation}} of a Central and Eastern European federation, starting with the Polish-Czechoslovakian confederation. He saw such an organization as necessary if smaller states were to stand up to traditional German and Russian imperialism. That concept, although ultimately futile, gained some traction around that time, as Sikorski and Edvard Beneš from the Czechoslovak government-in-exile, signed an agreement declaring the intent to pursue closer cooperation on 10 November that year. On 24 December 1940 Sikorski was promoted to generał broni. In March 1941 he visited the United States; he would visit USA again in March and December 1942.|$|E

San Martín married María de los Remedios de Escalada, a 14-year-old girl from one of the local wealthy families.|$|E

5|$|Together {{with the}} other broad-minded Finns, the new {{partnership}} constructed a Finnish compromise which eventually delivered stable and broad parliamentary democracy. The compromise was based both on {{the defeat of the}} Reds in the 1918 war and {{the fact that most of}} the Whites' <b>political</b> <b>goals</b> had not been achieved. After the foreign forces left Finland, the militant factions of the Red and White lost their backup, while the pre-1918 cultural and national integrity, and the legacy of Fennomania, stood out among the Finns.|$|E
5|$|When the Council did review cases, {{the reviews}} were {{commonly}} {{dominated by the}} countries whose ethnic groups were affected and that tried not only to resolve the problem of mistreatment of their minorities but also score other <b>political</b> <b>goals</b> on the international scene, sometimes even sacrificing the very minority in question (German and Hungarian governments are recognized as having abused the system the most). Also, of course, the League, lacking its own army, could not coerce any state to adhere to its recommendations.|$|E
5|$|Boyer {{observes the}} {{distinction}} between how nonhuman animals can receive political protection {{as individuals and as}} species. He argues that the latter form of protection is motivated by a desire to preserve human experience of the species rather than the experiences of the nonhuman animals themselves. Politically motivated species advocacy, Boyer argues, is highly anthropocentric, as advocates present these animals as sharing in particular revered virtues; as a result, the likes of habitat and genetic health are the focus of advocates, rather than the nonhuman animals themselves. Using the example of polar bear preservation, Boyer illustrates how species advocacy becomes tied up with broader <b>political</b> <b>goals</b> concerning humans and competing visions of the value of animals. He concludes that the advancement of species advocacy can limit the achievement of animal welfare/rights goals.|$|E

5|$|During {{his early}} career, Caesar had seen how chaotic and {{dysfunctional}} the Roman Republic had become. The republican machinery {{had broken down}} {{under the weight of}} imperialism, the central government had become powerless, the provinces had been transformed into independent principalities under the absolute control of their governors, and the army had replaced the constitution as the means of accomplishing <b>political</b> <b>goals.</b> Between his crossing of the Rubicon river in 49 BC, and his assassination in 44 BC, Caesar established a new constitution, which was intended to accomplish three separate goals. First, he wanted to suppress all armed resistance out in the provinces, and thus bring order back to the empire. Second, he wanted to create a strong central government in Rome. And finally, he wanted to knit together the entire empire into a single cohesive unit.|$|E
5|$|During the 15th {{century in}} Japan, peasant revolts, known as ikki, {{became much more}} commonplace. During the turmoil of the Ōnin War (1467–1477) and {{subsequent}} years, these rebellions increased in both frequency and success. Many of these rebels became known as Ikkō-ikki, a collection of peasant farmers, Buddhist monks, Shinto priests, and jizamurai (lesser nobles) who all espoused belief in the Jōdo Shinshū sect of Buddhism. Rennyo, the Hongan-ji abbot who led the Jōdo Shinshū movement, attracted a large following in Kaga and Echizen Province, but distanced himself from the <b>political</b> <b>goals</b> of the ikki, advocating violence only for self-defense or defense of one's religion.|$|E
5|$|The 1960s saw several {{important}} changes in popular music, especially rock. Many {{of these changes}} took place through the British Invasion where bands such as The Beatles, The Who, The Rolling Stones, became immensely popular and {{had a profound effect}} on American culture and music.These changes included the move from professionally composed songs to the singer-songwriter, and the understanding of popular music as an art, rather than a form of commerce or pure entertainment. These changes led to the rise of musical movements connected to <b>political</b> <b>goals,</b> such as the American Civil Rights Movement and the opposition to the Vietnam War. Rock was at the forefront of this change.|$|E

5|$|The first LARPs {{were run}} in the late 1970s, {{inspired}} by tabletop role-playing games and genre fiction. The activity spread internationally during the 1980s and has diversified into {{a wide variety of}} styles. Play may be very game-like or may be more concerned with dramatic or artistic expression. Events can also be designed to achieve educational or <b>political</b> <b>goals.</b> The fictional genres used vary greatly, from realistic modern or historical settings to fantastic or futuristic eras. Production values are sometimes minimal, but can involve elaborate venues and costumes. LARPs range in size from small private events lasting a few hours to large public events with thousands of players lasting for days.|$|E
5|$|Ford often opposed {{governor}} Mark Sanford's <b>political</b> <b>goals,</b> arguing {{his proposed}} reforms were unwanted by the public, and he mostly opposed Sanford's fiscal policy and worked to override budget vetoes by the governor, claiming he {{was removed from}} the interests of citizens. An exception were security measures for the State House complex which Ford agreed were too costly. He also opposed Sanford's goal {{to increase the number of}} roll calls in the State Senate and voted against a 2008 immigration reform bill favored by Sanford, stating it would be an ineffective deterrent and would lead to less driving safety. The reform would have required all employers to use state driver's licenses or a database from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to check the legal status of workers. Ford co-sponsored a bill with Glenn McConnell that would limit the governor's authority to appoint and remove board members overseeing the Charleston port and increase required qualifications for board members. Ford opposed a bill giving Sanford authority over the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control.|$|E
5|$|The Greenbackers {{nominated}} Weaver {{for president}} in 1880, but he received only 3.3 {{percent of the popular}} vote. After several more attempts at elected office, he was again elected to the House in 1884 and 1886. In Congress, he worked for expansion of the money supply and for the opening of Indian Territory to white settlement. As the Greenback Party fell apart, a new anti-big business third party, the People's Party ("Populists"), arose. Weaver helped to organize the party and was their nominee {{for president in}} 1892. This time he was more successful and gained 8.5 {{percent of the popular vote}} and won five states, but still fell far short of victory. The Populists merged with the Democrats by the end of the 19th century, and Weaver went with them, promoting the candidacy of William Jennings Bryan for president in 1896, 1900, and 1908. After serving as mayor of his home town, Colfax, Iowa, Weaver retired from his pursuit of elective office. He died in Iowa in 1912. Most of Weaver's <b>political</b> <b>goals</b> remained unfulfilled at his death, but many came to pass in the following decades.|$|E

5|$|In 1905–06, the Armenian-Tatar massacres {{broke out}} {{during which the}} ARF became {{involved}} in armed activities. Some sources claim that the Russian government incited the massacres in order to reinforce its authority during the revolutionary turmoil of 1905. The first outbreak of violence occurred in Baku, in February 1905. The ARF held the Russian authorities responsible for inaction and instigation of massacres {{that were part of}} a larger anti-Armenian policy. On May 11, 1905, Dashnak revolutionary Drastamat Kanayan assassinated Russian governor general Nakashidze, who was considered by the Armenian population as the main instigator of hate and confrontation between the Armenians and the Tatars. Unreliable protection from government is attributed to the Armenian bourgeoisie to turned to the ARF for protection. The Dashnak leaders argued that, given employment discrimination against Armenian workers in non-Armenian concerns, the defence provided to the Armenian bourgeoisie was essential to the safekeeping of employment opportunities for Armenian laborers. The Russian Tsar's envoy in the Caucasus, Vorontsov-Dashkov, reported that the ARF bore a major portion of responsibilities for perpetrating the massacres. The ARF, however, argued that it helped to organize the defence of the Armenian population against Muslim attacks. The blows suffered {{at the hands of the}} Dashnakist fighting squads proved a catalyst for the consolidation of the Muslim community of the Caucasus. During that period, the ARF regarded armed activity, including terror, as necessary for the achievement of <b>political</b> <b>goals.</b>|$|E
