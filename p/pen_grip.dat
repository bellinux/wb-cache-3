40|$|Writer’s Cramp (WC) is a focal, action-related dystonia, which induces {{hypertonic}} co-contractions {{and severely}} impairs handwriting. One behavioral treatment {{approach is the}} handwriting training developed by Mai and Marquardt (1999), [Mai, N., & Marquardt, C. (1999). Schreibtraining in der neurologischen Rehabilitation. In EKN-Materialien für die Rehabilitation. Dortmund: Borgmann] which includes among various motor exercises {{the use of a}} modified <b>pen</b> <b>grip</b> (stabilized between index and middle finger). This <b>pen</b> <b>grip</b> has proven particularly successful in clinical practice. The current study aims at elucidating the immediate effects of the modified <b>pen</b> <b>grip</b> on writing in 23 WC patients and 11 healthy controls. All participants wrote a sentence with their usual and also with the modified <b>pen</b> <b>grip.</b> Movement and pressure were recorded with a digitizing tablet. Pressure, movement time for the whole sentence, script size and writing fluency were analyzed. When writing with their usual <b>pen</b> <b>grip,</b> pressure in the WC patients was elevated, and writing speed was decreased compared to healthy controls. Changing over to the modified <b>pen</b> <b>grip</b> reduced the pressure significantly in WC patients and controls, but left other aspects of their writing unaffected. This shows that the use of the modified <b>pen</b> <b>grip</b> is an effective way to normalize pen pressure in WC patients, thereby providing the best conditions for the training of speed and fluency. ...|$|E

40|$|AbstractAnterior {{interosseous}} nerve syndrome (AINS) is a proximal median nerve neuropathy {{affecting the}} forearm. Trigger {{points in the}} anterior compartment of the forearm may cause compression of the anterior interosseous nerve (AIN) which, in turn, may result in muscle weakness. Here we present {{the case of a}} 37 -year-old female who complained of an abnormal <b>pen</b> <b>grip</b> while writing. Clinical examination (observation, palpation, pincer grip strength) showed weak pincer grip strength, an active trigger point {{in the middle of the}} anterior forearm and a positive circle sign. Her treatment course included cryomassage, neural mobilization, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) and the strain-counter strain (SCS) technique four times a week for two weeks. On follow-up, the patient reported an inactive trigger point on palpation, improvement in her handwriting and improved pincer (fingertip pinch) grip strength in pounds (lbs) as recorded by the Baseline Hydraulic Pinch Gauge. This case report explored the effectiveness of SCS as an important adjunct to other conservative treatments for entrapment neuropathies. SCS has also shown its potential to improve muscle strength...|$|E

40|$|We {{present results}} from an {{experiment}} examining the area occluded {{by the hand}} when using a tablet-sized direct pen input device. Our {{results show that the}} pen, hand, and forearm can occlude up to 47 % of a 12 inch display. The shape of the occluded area varies between participants due to differences in <b>pen</b> <b>grip</b> rather than simply anatomical differences. For the most part, individuals adopt a consistent posture for long and short selection tasks. Overall, many occluded pixels are located higher relative to the pen than previously thought. From the experimental data, a five-parameter scalable circle and pivoting rectangle geometric model is presented which captures the general shape of the occluded area relative to the pen position. This model fits the experimental data much better than the simple bounding box model often used implicitly by designers. The space of fitted parameters also serves to quantify the shape of occlusion. Finally, an initial design for a predictive version of the model is discussed. Author Keywords: Hand occlusion, pen input, Tablet PC. ACM Classification: H 5. 2.

40|$|Master of Applied Science (Occupational Therapy) Background: Handwriting is an {{important}} activity which is commonly affected after a stroke. Handwriting research has predominantly involved children. In adults, the focus of handwriting research has been identifying forgery, doctors’ handwriting legibility and the kinematics of writing strokes. There are no known studies which provide information on unimpaired adult handwriting in real situations to guide stroke rehabilitation therapists. Aim: This study aims to describe the handwriting practices of 30 unimpaired adults aged 65 years and over to inform adult handwriting rehabilitation. Methods: This study used a cross-sectional observational design. Three data collection methods were used: self-report questionnaire, handwriting samples collected using a digital pen and a handwriting log. Following ethical approval, 30 older adults were recruited using snowball sampling. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics. Results: The median age of participants was 72 years. Three-quarters of participants scored less than 4 for legibility on a 4 -point scale. A tripod <b>pen</b> <b>grip</b> was used by 97 % of the sample. Variations in handwriting were evident in letter size, slant and spacing. Participants wrote very little, {{an average of three}} times per day (SD = 1. 5) and a median of 18 words per occasion. Most handwriting (85 %) involved self-generated, not copied or transcribed text. Participants stood whilst writing for 17 % of handwriting occasions. The most common reasons for handwriting were taking notes (23 %) and completing puzzles (22 %). Discussion: Legibility in older adults may not depend exclusively on the handwriting script that a beginning writer was taught at school, but may be due to other factors, as a person ages. A comprehensive adult handwriting assessment and retraining program should consist of relevant handwriting activities, involve self-generated text and few words. Conclusion: Findings will contribute to the ongoing development of an ecologically valid adult handwriting assessment and help inform stroke rehabilitation practice...|$|E
40|$|Aims: The {{purpose of}} this thesis was to {{investigate}} the effects of Virtual Reality technology and haptics for stroke rehabilitation. Aims were to assess motor training in the so called chronic phase after stroke and to evaluate whether any improvement detected in the VR environment is reflected in daily life. We wanted to establish normative kinematic reference values and to test a method for assessing visuospatial neglect. Methods: One hundred and six subjects participated in four different studies. Twenty-nine had a stroke and 77 were healthy individuals. In paper I, a single-subject experimental design (AB) provided intervention effects on five hemiparetic stroke subjects. The intervention consisted of playing a three-dimensional computer game. Paper II was explorative and was intended to acquire normative data. Fifty-eight healthy subjects performed three-dimensional hand movements in a virtual environment using two types of handgrip postures, i. e. <b>pen</b> <b>grip</b> and cylinder grip. Paper III used a pre/post-test design with comparison with a control population. The rationale was to place a VR system in a non hospital environment to see whether playing three-dimensional computer games would improve upper extremity motor function. The intervention involved 11 stroke subjects who received extra computer training in addition to their current activities. The control group was comprised of 11 stroke subjects who continued their usual rehabilitation (no extra computer training) during this period. An additional group of 11 right-handed aged matched individuals served as reference subjects. Paper IV was explorative with comparisons with traditional neglect tests. Eight subjects with right hemisphere brain damage and eight healthy controls were included. Four stroke subjects had visuospatial neglect and four had recovered clinically from initial symptoms of visuospatial neglect. The performance of the stroke subjects was compared with that of a reference group consisting of eight subjects with no history of neurological deficits. Results: All studies demonstrate that this VR application can provide a quantitative analysis of hand movements. In paper I, improvements in time (extension), velocity and hand trajectory (hand path ratio) for all subjects was noted. One subject improved in occupational performance, i. e. improvement reflected in activities of daily living. In paper II, we established normative kinematic values. The test-retest for the two different handgrips between two test occasions showed a high reliability for the healthy subject for the kinematic variables. There was a training effect between the first test occasion and the third test occasion. Paper III is consistent with Paper I, but the results have extended these findings, showing that virtual rehabilitation can be beneficial not only to younger participants but also to elderly people in terms of enhancing their motor performance. In Paper IV we showed that the visuospatial neglect test gave additional information compared to traditional tests. Both the subjects with neglect and the subjects clinically recovered from neglect showed aberrant search performance in the cancellation task in the virtual environment, such as mixed search pattern, repeated target pressures and deviating hand movements. Conclusion: The VR upper extremity tests take less than a minute to complete and produce objective kinematic data. The general experience using the VR application approach suggests that this intervention concept is promising in stroke rehabilitation, {{with a wide range of}} applicability...|$|E
40|$|Handwritten {{signatures}} {{are one of}} {{the most}} socially accepted biometric traits. Signatures are commonly used in financial and legal agreements since more than a century. In education, signatures are used for attendance control, either to lectures or exams, but not for (automatic) authentication. With the rapid deployment of dynamic signature recognition, this technology is ready to be used for student authentication. Also, the use of this technology can be extended to different administrative services within the education system, in order to add a higher security level to the traditional procedures of authentication (e. g., visually checking the face and/or signature on the person identity card). Nowadays, signatures can be easily captured by means of electronic devices (e. g. <b>pen</b> tablets, PDAs, <b>grip</b> <b>pens,</b> smartphones, etc.). For this reason, the popularity of this biometric trait is rapidly increasing in the last few years. Even more, signatures can be made using the finger as the writing tool on smartphones. In this paper, we analyse two scenarios for student authentication using their signatures: i) an office scenario with a high quality pen tablet specifically designed to acquire signatures (i. e., Wacom device), and ii) a mobile scenario where users sign on their smartphones with the finger improving this way the usability. For this experimental study we make use of e-BioSign database, which was captured using various modern pen tablet devices and smartphones. The database contains signatures from 70 users including students and educators, captured in two sessions in different days. The experiments on automatic authentication using dynamic signatures are conducted considering two different types of forgeries, namely: i) random forgeries (the case where an impostor uses his own signature claiming to be another person), and ii) skilled forgeries (where impostors imitate the signature of other persons) ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{interaction}} possibilities enabled when {{the barrel of}} a digital pen is augmented with a multitouch sensor. We present a novel multi-touch pen (MTPen) prototype and discuss its alternate uses beyond those of a standard stylus, such as allowing new touch gestures to be performed using the index finger or thumb and detecting how users grip the device as a mechanism for mode switching. We also discuss the hardware and software implementation challenges in realizing our prototype, and showcase how one can combine different grips (tripod, relaxed tripod, sketch, wrap) and gestures (swipe and double tap) to enable new interaction techniques with the MTPen in a prototype drawing application. One specific aim is the elimination of some of the comfort problems associated with existing auxiliary controls on digital pens. Mechanical controls such as barrel buttons and barrel scroll wheels work best in only a few specific hand <b>grips</b> and <b>pen</b> rotations. Comparatively, our gestures can be successfully and comfortably performed regardless of the rotation of the pen or how the user grips it, offering greater flexibility in use. We describe a formal evaluation comparing MTPen gestures against the use of a barrel button for mode switching. This study shows that both swipe and double tap gestures are comparable in performance to commonly employed barrel buttons without its disadvantages.

40|$|Abstract: The {{phenomenon}} of writing reflects developed fine motor skills of a person. Specially, {{the dynamics of}} writing {{can be used for}} the characterization of the individual writer or written object. Person authentication based on the dynamics of handwriting on pad and in air using biometric Smart Pen (BiSP) device are presented in this paper. We regard hand movement with pen in space as handwriting (or hand gesturing) in air. The acquisition device BiSP is a ballpoint pen equipped with a diversity of sensors, measuring the acceleration and tilt angle of the <b>pen,</b> the <b>grip</b> forces of fingers holding the pen, and the forces and vibrations in the refill during writing, drawing and hand gesturing in air or on any solid pad. For classification, queries and references of multi-dimensional time-series provided by BiSP are matched by fast dynamic time warping DTW. To judge the biometric authentication of a writer, the recognition score rates of PIN words and single characters are computed. It was found that the score rates of performance are better 99. 99 % and the response time is below 2 seconds for a population of 40 enrolled persons. The proposed handwriting in air is a promising authentication method because performance of writing on paper pad and in air differ marginally. It can create a new dimension of freedom in unconstrained data input, and access control and can compete with the emerging hand gesture recognition methods. ...|$|R

30|$|For each {{digital image}} of the tissue sections, the {{relative}} area of CF, depth of UF, and ligament entheseal attachment angle were measured. CF relative area was quantified by outlining the CF tissue with a digital pen display (Cintiq 24 HD w/ <b>grip</b> <b>pen,</b> Wacom, Kazo, Saitama, Japan) and dividing its area by {{the length of the}} enthesis. This enthesis length was defined as the length of the profile of the tidemark. Using the same tools, UF depth was measured at 500 -μm intervals across the entire enthesis. Average depth, and not relative area, was selected as the method of choice for UF quantification for two reasons: first, the interface between this tissue and the adjacent distal tissue—dense fibrous connective tissue—is more ambiguous than between the CF and bone; and second, sampling UF depth at a constant interval is an established method (Beaulieu et al. 2015 a; Evans et al. 1990). Lastly, the ligament entheseal attachment angle was quantified as the angle between a line parallel to the fibers of the ligament and a line of best fit (first order polynomial) to the profile of the digitized interface between the entheseal calcified and uncalcified tissue, also known as the “tidemark”. All measurements were made in ImageJ (Schneider et al. 2012). The average CF relative area and UF depth were calculated for four regions of interest of the femoral enthesis (Fig.  1): (1) antero-superior; (2) antero-inferior; (3) postero-superior; and (4) postero-inferior. Anatomically, regions 1 – 2 correspond to the origin of the anteromedial (AM) fibers, while regions 3 – 4 correspond to the origin of the PL fibers. These four regions were selected to allow for comparisons between the AM and PL fibers of the ACL, as well as between the superior and inferior margins. Lastly, the entheseal attachment angle was averaged over the two most anterior sections (Fig.  1, A–B), as well as over the two most posterior sections (Fig.  1, C–D), of each enthesis.|$|R
