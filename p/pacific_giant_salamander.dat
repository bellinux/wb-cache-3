40|$|Abstract: I {{examined}} {{the relationships between}} timber harvest, creek habitat, and vertebrate populations in the North and South forks of Caspar Creek. Habitat inventories suggested pool availability increased after the onset of timber harvest activities. Increased large woody debris in the channel was associated {{with an increase in}} the frequency of blowdown in the riparian buffer zone. This increase in large woody debris volume increased the availability of pools. No dramatic changes in the abundance of young-of-the-year steelhead, yearling steelhead, coho, or <b>Pacific</b> <b>giant</b> <b>salamanders</b> were directly related to logging. High interannual variation in the abundance of aquatic vertebrates made it difficult to contrast changes in abundance between pre-logging and post-logging periods. Changes in channel morphology associated with increased volume of large woody debris in the channel suggest that yearling steelhead, coho, and <b>Pacific</b> <b>giant</b> <b>salamanders</b> may benefit from logging in the short-term because of increased living space. However, over a longer time scale these conditions will probably not persist (Lisle and Napolitano, these proceedings) ...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2002 To {{effectively}} manage for biodiversity at broad, ecosystem scales, {{the influences}} of habitat structure at multiple spatial scales on vertebrate species must be understood. There are few studies on the broad-scale habitat requirements of stream amphibians despite their importance in streams in forest ecosystems in the Pacific Northwest (PNW) as predators and prey, and potentially as indicators of ecosystem health. In particular, studies {{on the influence of}} forest structure at landscape scales on stream amphibians are lacking. I examined stream amphibian-habitat relationships for <b>Pacific</b> <b>giant</b> <b>salamanders</b> (Dicamptodon tenebrosus), larval and metamorphosed tailed frogs (Ascaphus truei), and torrent salamanders (Rhyacotriton spp.) at four spatial scales (2 -m sample unit, intermediate, sub-drainage, and drainage). Over two field seasons (1998 and 1999), I captured 1, 568 amphibians in 702 sample units in 16 randomly chosen drainages in the Oregon Coast Range. I used an information theoretic approach of analysis to rank sets of a priori candidate models that described habitat relationships at each spatial scale. At the 2 -m sample unit scale, all species of interest were negatively associated with fine sediments and were positively associated with either stream width or elevation. At the intermediate spatial scale, <b>Pacific</b> <b>giant</b> <b>salamanders,</b> metamorphosed tailed frogs, and torrent salamanders were positively associated with the presence of a 150 -ft. forested band {{on each side of the}} stream, and larval tailed frogs were positively associated with the presence of forest > 105 years old on at least one side of the stream. At the sub-drainage and drainage scales, all species were positively associated with the proportion of stream length in a sub-drainage or drainage with a 150 -ft. forested band on each side of the stream. Heat load index (aspect) was also important for <b>Pacific</b> <b>giant</b> <b>salamanders</b> and larval tailed frogs at the intermediate and sub-drainage scales. Results at all spatial scales suggest that <b>Pacific</b> <b>giant</b> <b>salamanders</b> and larval tailed frogs occur lower in the drainage network, and metamorphosed tailed frogs and torrent salamanders occur higher in the drainage network. This study demonstrates the importance of examining headwater stream amphibian habitat at multiple spatial scales, provides insights on linkages between amphibian responses across spatial scales, and shows that broad-scale variables (e. g., the presence of forested bands or the percentage of stream length with forested bands) can be used to assess management approaches for stream amphibian communities. Geophysical characteristics such as stream aspect may also help identify areas that should not be harvested if protection of amphibian habitat is an objective...|$|R

Although logging is a potential threat to the species, no studies have examined how clear-cutting affects its terrestrial stage. We used radio-telemetry to compare the movements of 35 terrestrial <b>Pacific</b> <b>giant</b> <b>salamanders</b> at sites with three different logging histories: forested, clearcut to the stream margin, and clearcut with riparian buffer strips. The results demonstrate that logging affected movements of the salamanders. Salamanders in clearcuts remained significantly closer to the stream, spent more time in subterranean refuges, and had smaller home ranges than those at forested sites. During a dry year, salamanders in clearcuts were significantly more dependent on precipitation for their movement than salamanders in forested habitats. Salamander movement behavior in riparian buffer strips was {{not significantly different from}} that at forested sites but was significantly different from that at clearcut sites. Riparian buffer strips appear to mitigate some of the negative effects of clearcuts on salamander movement.

50|$|Three {{different}} types of egg deposition occur. Ambystoma and Taricha spp. spawn large numbers of small eggs in quiet ponds where many large predators are unlikely. Most dusky <b>salamanders</b> (Desmognathus) and <b>Pacific</b> <b>giant</b> <b>salamanders</b> (Dicamptodon) lay smaller batches of medium-sized eggs in a concealed site in flowing water, and these are usually guarded by an adult, normally the female. Many of the tropical climbing salamanders (Bolitoglossa) and lungless salamanders (Plethodontinae) lay {{a small number of}} large eggs on land in a well-hidden spot, where they are also guarded by the mother. Some species such as the fire salamanders (Salamandra) are ovoviviparous, with the female retaining the eggs inside her body until they hatch, either into larvae to be deposited in a water body, or into fully formed juveniles.|$|R

50|$|The {{southern}} torrent salamander (Rhyacotriton variegatus) is {{a member}} of the Rhyacotritonidae family of salamanders. This species of torrent salamander is found the farthest south in the region. It is a small salamander endemic to the Pacific Northwest from Northern California to Northern Oregon. It is one of four species of Rhyacotriton, along with R. cascadae, R. kezeri and R. olympicus. All species of Rhyacotriton are small, with their body lengths being less than 5 inches. The species reproduces annually, with an extended courtship and egg-laying period. The time it takes from oviposition to reach sexual maturity ranges from five to eight years, making the generation interval rather long. The larval stage, from hatching to metamorphosis, lasts 2.0-2.5 yr, with females requiring another 1.5-2.0 yr until they can first breed. They reach sexual maturity 1.0-1.5 yr after metamorphosis which occurs between 4.5 and 5.0 yr. This species feeds on small insects and spiders. Although it is found over a large area, it is not a migratory creature. It is preyed on by <b>Pacific</b> <b>giant</b> <b>salamanders</b> and garter snakes.|$|R
40|$|Extensive {{timber harvest}} has {{occurred}} over the last 100 years in the Pacific Northwest (PNW), resulting in {{a high proportion of}} early-successional forest and forest edge. Prior studies indicate that several PNW amphibian species are associated with habitat conditions found primarily in old-growth stands. However, it is unknown whether increasing amounts of forest edges in the PNW might further reduce the abundance and distribution of those amphibian species. In a recent study, USGS scientist Bruce Bury and collaborators at the University of Montana investigated the abundance of terrestrial and stream-dwelling amphibians on the interface of recent clearcuts and mature forest in the Siskiyou Mountains, southern Oregon. They assessed relative abundance of terrestrial amphibians on four clearcut-forest transects. The most frequent terrestrial species were ensatina and Del Norte salamanders. There were no statistically significant differences in abundance associated with distance to forest edge for either species. Large amounts of downed wood in the clearcuts may have ameliorated harvest effects.

40|$|Timber {{harvest in}} the Pacific Northwest has {{resulted}} in a highly fragmented landscape, but there is no information on responses of amphibians to forest edges for this region. We investigated abundance of terrestrial and stream-dwelling amphibians on the interface of recent clearcuts and mature forest in the Siskiyou Mountains, Oregon, in summer and fall of 1998. We assessed relative abundance of terrestrial amphibians on four clearcut-forest transects with a combination of pitfall trapping and manual searches. Ensatinas and Del Norte salamanders, the most frequently recorded species, were found on all four sites. While we commonly captured ensatinas using both techniques, we caught most Del Norte salamanders during manual searches. For both species we found no differences in abundance associated with distance to forest edge. Lack of differences in salamander abundance among clearcut and adjacent forests may be related to large amounts of small woody debris that remained in the clearcuts. The abundance of larvae of tailed frogs and <b>Pacific</b> <b>giant</b> <b>salamanders</b> in five headwater streams was markedly lower in clearcuts than in downstream mature forest stands. No obvious differences existed for stream habitat variables across transects, but abundance of metamorphosed individuals and recruitment may be reduced in clearcut areas due to hotter and drier conditions during the summer.

40|$|Our {{goal was}} to {{describe}} and evaluate patterns of association between stream size and abundances of amphibians and small mammals in a watershed in northwestern California, USA. We sampled populations at 42 stream sites and eight upland sites within a 100 -km 2 watershed in 1995 and 1996. Stream reaches sampled ranged from poorly defined channels that rarely flowed to 10 -m-wide channels with perennial flow. The majority of reaches flowed only intermittently. Aquatic vertebrates were sampled by conducting area-constrained surveys, and terrestrial vertebrates were sampled along three 45 -m-long transects using cover boards, drift fence/pitfall trap arrays, and two types of live trap. Vegetation characteristics (including basal area of live trees by species, ground cover, shrub cover and numbers of logs) were strongly associated with measures of stream size, especially channel width. Compared to upland sites, mean numbers of plant species in the herbaceous layer were significantly greater along streams with active channel widths as small as 0. 9 - 1. 3 m. Larval <b>Pacific</b> <b>giant</b> <b>salamanders</b> (Dicamptodon tenebrosus) were found only in stream reaches with continuous flow or in channels >= 2. 4 -m wide, and larval tailed frogs (Ascaphus truei) were found only at sites with continuous or nearly continuous flow.

40|$|Graduation date: 2003 The {{coexistence}} of multiple predators may have important {{consequences for the}} structure and function of communities. Interactions between predators may strongly affect their combined direct and indirect effects on prey populations and lower trophic levels. Predators often have size-structured populations, which may result in intraguild predation characterized by complex trophic and behavioral interactions. Coexistence of multiple predators may strongly depend on antipredator defenses of small size classes that reduce their vulnerability to predation. In Pacific Northwest forested ecosystems, <b>Pacific</b> <b>giant</b> <b>salamanders</b> (Dicamptodon tenebrosus) and coastal cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarki clarki) are the top predators in many perennial headwater streams. Dicamptodon and cutthroat have size-structured populations with roughly corresponding size classes, and interactions between these species appear consistent with intraguild predation. My research objective {{was to determine the}} mechanisms contributing to the {{coexistence of}} Dicamptodon larvae with cutthroat trout in headwater streams, and the effects of this coexistence on factors related to Dicamptodon fitness. First, I tested for two general types of antipredator defenses of young-of-year Dicamptodon larvae against trout. Larvae were palatable to trout during initial and repeated offerings, which suggests that they may survive few encounters with trout. However, larvae increased refuge use in response to non-visual, chemical cues from trout, which likely reduces the probability of encounters with trout and contributes to their coexistence. Second, I measured the effects of cutthroat trout on Dicamptodon fitness parameters in a field experiment. Dicamptodon survival, growth, and behavior (activity level) did not differ between trout-present and trout-absent pools, although these results were compromised by unexplained gains or losses of larvae from most pools. Antipredator behaviors may promote coexistence of Dicamptodon and cutthroat trout, and may contribute to a complex series of behavioral and trophic interactions affecting lower trophic levels within headwater stream communities...|$|R
