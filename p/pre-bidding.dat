50|$|Example 2. Multiple {{identical}} {{objects are}} auctioned, and the agents have budget constraints.

40|$|Providing new {{evidence}} {{derived from a}} large sample simulation using US exchange-listed firms from 1990 to 2012, this paper contributes to the discussion about 1) the magnitude of target <b>pre-bid</b> abnormal returns (conventionally called the “run-ups”) and 2) the substitution and mark-up pricing relation between <b>pre-bid</b> run-ups and post-bid mark-ups of M&A targets. As random simulation represents the normal scenario (i. e. probability of M&A announcement is unpredictable), we should consider empirically derived critical values of simulation run-ups as the new benchmarks when testing {{the significance of the}} target’s <b>pre-bid</b> abnormal return. The fact that only 13 % of M&A run-ups could be recognized as abnormal when compared to new benchmarks raises doubts about the traditional approach. In the examination of the relationship between run-ups and mark-ups, a 0. 4674 coefficient in the regression of mark-up on run-up using pure random sample makes significant contribution to the debate upon substitution and mark-up pricing hypotheses. If we take 0. 4674 as a baseline, the coefficient of the regression is supposed to be smaller if substitution hypothesis outweighs mark-up pricing hypothesis, otherwise this coefficient will be larger than 0. 4674. Although the conclusion is still open, findings in this paper and in Schwert (1996) actually tend to support the substitution hypothesis instead of mark-up pricing hypothesis, suggesting <b>pre-bid</b> run-ups do not necessarily cause a higher bidding price for the bidders...|$|R

40|$|Public private {{partnerships}} (PPPs) {{are cutting}} edge contractual agreements nowadays. The long-term prospect entails considerable risks and practitioners underline the inefficiencies in the contracting phase. This {{research focuses on}} the competitive bidding procedure in the tendering stage. A private contractor will decide upon its pre-tendering research strategy and the involved investment {{in order to determine}} the costs implied in the project. Secondly, it will consider a bidding strategy while taking into account the number of other competitors and their respective characteristics. A game theoretical analysis of the influence of the strategies of competitors, a company’s experience and the government’s compensation schemes is performed in an initial, analytical way and by using simulations. This shows that pre-tender research incentives can be created but the dynamics of the game require careful consideration. Consequently, a rational approach for investigating the <b>pre-bidding</b> research strategy and the final offer is proposed.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{premiums}} paid in successful tender offers and mergers involving NYSE and Amex-listed target firms from 1975 - 91 {{in relation to}} pre-announcement stock price runups. It has been conventional to measure corporate control premiums including the price runups that occur before the initial formal bid. There has been little evidence on {{the relation between the}} <b>pre-bid</b> runup and the post-announcement premium (the premium paid to target stockholders measured from the date of the first bid). Under what circumstances are runups associated with larger total premiums? The evidence in this paper shows that in most cases, the <b>pre-bid</b> runup and the post- announcement premium are uncorrelated (i. e. little or no substitution between the runup and the post-announcement premium), so the runup is an added cost to the bidder. This has important implications for assessing the costs of illegal insider trading based on private information about a potential bid. ...|$|R

The authors review empirical studies of illegal insider trading and trading ahead of unscheduled announcements to generate predictions for abnormal returns and abnormal volume ahead of the takeover announcement. They observe serially correlated volume and a pattern of return reversals in their sample. <b>Pre-bid</b> run-ups occur shortly before the actual announcement, accompanied by significantly positive abnormal returns and share volume. The stock prices of the target firm react significantly to the actual announcement, with both positive and negative reactions. These price–volume dynamics are more consistent with the predictions of the market anticipation hypothesis than the hypothesis of illegal insider trading. Financial markets...|$|R
40|$|RESEARCH PROBLEM: Researchers {{have found}} mixed {{evidence}} of how the level of competition affects bids in auctions. According to conventional economic theory, an increase in competition should make bids more competitive. However, the winner's curse phenomenon calls for less aggressive bids in common-value auctions. Bidders may become less aggressive also due to the entry effect, since {{an increase in the}} number of potential bidders decreases the likelihood of winning the contract, yet participation costs remain constant. Rational bidders should take this into account by bidding less aggressively. Which of the effect dominates differs between different types of auctions. DATA AND METHODOLOGY: In this thesis, was empirically studied using Finnish data, how the level of competition affects bids in auctions for public construction projects. Moreover, the relation between bid prices and budget overruns was also studied. The data for studying the effect of competition on bid prices contained information of 496 auctions of various kinds of projects, whereas the data for studying budget overruns contained information of 183 auctions. The data was analyzed using statistical methods such as multivariate regression analysis. The competitiveness of bids was measured as the relation between the <b>pre-bid</b> cost estimation and the lowest bid. Budget overruns were measured as the difference between the final cost of the contract and the lowest bid relative to the lowest bid. If the final cost of the project was not available, the relative amount of change orders and extra works was used as a proxy for budget overruns. FINDINGS: Per each additional bid received, the lowest bid decreases significantly when compared with the <b>pre-bid</b> cost estimation. However, the winner's curse and the entry effect significantly impact bids upward. Two solutions were provided: the release of information about the <b>pre-bid</b> cost estimation and the use of the second-price sealed-bid auction method. An economic downturn was found to be associated with the higher number of bids, lower bid volatility and more competitive bids. The timing of procurement is therefore important. Larger contracts were found to be associated with more accurate <b>pre-bid</b> cost estimations. The costs of small contracts are estimated roughly, but conservatively to avoid budget overruns. Bids were moreover found to be negatively correlated with budget overruns...|$|R
