50|$|In 1944, the Japanese Imperial Army {{invaded the}} town {{and turned it into}} a garrison, with the shrine being used as an arsenal. To save the image, the church's head sacristan, Procopio Ángeles, wrapped it in a thick, woollen blanket and placed it in an empty <b>petrol</b> <b>drum,</b> which he then buried in a nearby kitchen.|$|E
50|$|Most of the {{building}} materials and tools used for construction are recycled. This includes everyday objects and excess construction materials donated by construction companies and a nearby brick factory. For instance, the columns have been moulded with old <b>petrol</b> <b>drums.</b> The building work {{has been carried out}} without any crane.|$|R
5000|$|The Green family, {{who were}} living at Coorabulka, {{had to be}} rescued from the {{property}} in 1949 when it was severely flooded. The family were menaced by floodwaters in the homestead for 36 hours before being reached by two rescue parties, one on horseback and the second on an improvised raft built from a water trough and <b>petrol</b> <b>drums.</b> The rescue was prompted when the Greens made a fading telephone call saying [...] "they were up to their armpits in water and {{trying to reach the}} roof".|$|R
25|$|The Japanese stood {{firm and}} the last {{defenders}} had to be blown out from the cellars by rolling down <b>petrol</b> <b>drums</b> and igniting them with tracer bullets. It {{was not until the}} 11th of March that the hill fell into British hands. Aerial bombardment was resorted to when shelling from the hill failed to breach the city wall and destroy the enemy, and Mandalay Palace, a national heritage of great importance, burnt down during the siege. Whether it was the shelling and bombing or the enemy that destroyed the splendid teak palace was never determined with any certainty.|$|R
500|$|On {{the fifth}} day of fieldwork, Ryszard Gradziński, the {{geologist}} of the expedition, found a concretion of well-preserved bones which promised {{to belong to a}} fairly complete skeleton. Excavation started on the next day, revealing a nearly complete skeleton lacking only the head and neck. Until today, this specimen remains by far the most complete find of this dinosaur. The transport of the specimen out of rough terrain caused major technical problems. Stone blocks containing the fossils had to be moved some 580 m on improvised metal sledges made out of <b>petrol</b> <b>drums</b> before they could be loaded onto trucks. Because the skeleton was embedded in very hard sandstone layers, several blocks weighed over a ton. On the 9th of July, the packing of the skeleton into 35 crates started for transportation to Dalanzadgad; together, the crates weighed about 12 tons.|$|R
50|$|Hawkins was {{tasked with}} {{securing}} the island ramp {{on one of}} the two long piers extending into the lagoon. He and his recon-scout platoon raced ahead of the first wave in two Higgins Boats and landed on the pier where they were placed under heavy machine gun fire. Since there were <b>petrol</b> <b>drums</b> {{at the end of the}} pier in the line of enemy fire, Hawkins sent most of his Marines back down the ramp then proceeded with only five men, four scouts and one combat engineer with a flamethrower. Once they burned and had blown up every hiding place left on the pier, they withdrew to the boat. Hawkins then commandeered three LVTs and transferred his men from both LCVPs to these for the trip to shore where they joined their regiment for the rest of the battle. Hawkins was later killed during this action and was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor.|$|R
50|$|Repetition, were a post-punk (also dubbed as Belgian post-punk) {{band from}} London, which formed in August 1979. The band's initial line up was ex SpizzOil guitarist Pete <b>Petrol,</b> Ex Xtraverts <b>drummer</b> Tim Transe, {{keyboard}} player A.S.D.H. (Andy Hooper), bassist AWOL (Nicholas), and vocalist Sarah Osbourne.|$|R
500|$|The first troops {{arrived at}} Milne Bay from Port Moresby in the Dutch KPM ships [...] and , escorted by the sloop [...] and the {{corvette}} [...] on 25 June. Karsik docked at a pontoon wharf made from <b>petrol</b> <b>drums</b> hastily constructed by Papuan workers recruited by ANGAU, who assisted in unloading the ships. The troops included {{two and a}} half companies and a machine gun platoon from the 55th Infantry Battalion of the 14th Infantry Brigade, the 9th Light Anti-Aircraft Battery with eight Bofors 40 mm guns, a platoon of the US 101st Coast Artillery Battalion (Anti-Aircraft) with eight [...]50 calibre machine guns, and two 3.7 inch anti-aircraft guns of the 23rd Heavy Anti-Aircraft Battery. Company E of the 46th Engineers of the US Army Corps of Engineers arrived on Bontekoe with airbase construction equipment. Some 29 KPM ships had escaped to Australia {{after the fall of the}} Dutch East Indies. They were manned by Dutch and Javanese crews, and were the lifeline of the garrison at Milne Bay, making roughly two out of every three voyages there during the campaign, the remainder being by Australian, British and US ships. Five KPM ships would be lost during the fighting in Papua.|$|R
5000|$|In March 1945 the British Fourteenth Army's Indian 19th Infantry Division {{under the}} command of Major-General Thomas Wynford 'Pete' Rees, dubbed the 'Pocket Napoleon' by his men on account of his size and {{successful}} military career, was closing in on the Japanese in Mandalay where resistance was based mainly at Mandalay Hill with its pagodas and temples honeycombed for machine-guns, well supplied and heavily garrisoned. Fort Dufferin or the walled city with the royal palace was another pocket of resistance by the remaining Japanese troops. A Gurkha battalion stormed up the hill engaging in fierce hand-to-hand fighting all day and night on the 9th of March, and they were joined the next day by two companies of a British battalion. [...] The Japanese stood firm and the last defenders had to be blown out from the cellars by rolling down <b>petrol</b> <b>drums</b> and igniting them with tracer bullets. It was not until the 11th of March that the hill fell into British hands. Aerial bombardment was resorted to when shelling from the hill failed to breach the city wall and destroy the enemy, and Mandalay Palace, a national heritage of great importance, burnt down during the siege.

50|$|The type {{specimen}} (ZPAL MgD-Ij48) was discovered between the 10th and 23 June 1965, during a joint Polish-Mongolian paleontological expedition led by Polish paleontologist Zofia Kielan-Jaworowska. The largest {{of a series}} of expeditions carried out in 1963-1971, this expedition involved 21 members, which at times were supported by additional hired Mongolian workers. The site of discovery is located in Ömnögovi Province in southern Mongolia in the Altan Uul area, which exposes some 100 km² of badlands. The sediments exposed at Altan Uul belong to the Nemegt Formation, the youngest of the three geological formations of the Nemegt Basin. Opisthocoelicaudia was the first of several important dinosaur discoveries made by the 1965 expedition. The other finds, made at different localities, include several skeletons of the tyrannosaurid Tarbosaurus as well as the {{type specimen}}s of the giant ornithomimosaur Deinocheirus, the sauropod Nemegtosaurus, and the pachycephalosaur Homalocephale.On the fifth day of fieldwork, Ryszard Gradzinski, the geologist of the expedition, found a concretion of well-preserved bones which promised to belong to a fairly complete skeleton.

5000|$|After John O'Neill left, a re-shuffle {{took place}} in That <b>Petrol</b> Emotion. <b>Drummer</b> Ciaran McLaughlin and guitarist Raymond Gorman picked up major songwriting duties; blossoming as writers in the process, whilst new bassist John Marchini joined to allow Damian O'Neill {{to take up the}} guitar {{alongside}} Gorman. This new dynamic of musicians and songsmiths led to the 1990 album Chemicrazy, again for Virgin records, and produced by Scott Litt (who had recently finished producing R.E.M.'s breakthrough Green album). Working with Litt, [...] "Chemicrazy" [...] developed a more alt rock style than before; hinted at on the final track of the previous album [...] "Under the Sky". However whilst being more intense than before, [...] "Chemicrazy" [...] also maintained a pure pop heart, exemplified by singles [...] "Sensitize", [...] "Tingle" [...] and [...] "Hey Venus", the former track sounding particularly R.E.M-esque. Frustratingly for the band however the massive predicted sales for [...] "Chemicrazy" [...] never came and the album stalled at UK #62.|$|R
