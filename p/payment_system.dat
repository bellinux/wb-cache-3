40|$|Most <b>payment</b> <b>systems</b> {{that are}} used on the Internet today are {{analogous}} to <b>payment</b> <b>systems</b> from the physical world, where payment with cash is the most widespread payment method. For Swedish Internet commerce the dominating electronic way to pay is by credit card. An alternative method is payment upon delivery through traditional systems. However, the traditional <b>payment</b> <b>systems</b> are neither suited for micro payments, nor for the purchasing of digital services. The purpose of this thesis {{is to find out}} why there are no well-functioning cash <b>payment</b> <b>systems</b> available for the Internet today. In our study we focus mainly on the technology and the use of electronic <b>payment</b> <b>systems.</b> The study started with a review of previous, existing and forthcoming electronic <b>payment</b> <b>systems.</b> Surveys were used to find out the attitude of consumers and online merchants towards online cash payments. The survey results were then verified with interviews. Our results show several reasons for why there are no well-functioning cash <b>payment</b> <b>systems</b> for the Internet. One of our results indicates that the absence of cash <b>payment</b> <b>systems</b> could be explained by difficulties in establishing a profitable payment structure. Neither consumers nor online merchants demand such a system. At the same time the <b>payment</b> <b>systems</b> of today are improving and becoming more widely accepted among consumers...|$|R

Once {{the game is}} bought, a software license is permanently attached to the user's Steam account, allowing {{him or her to}} download the software on any compatible device. Game licenses can be given to other accounts under certain conditions. Content is delivered from an international network of servers using a proprietary file transfer protocol. Steam sells its products in US and Canadian dollars, euros, pounds sterling, Brazilian reais, Russian rubles, Indonesian rupiah and Indian rupees depending on the user's location. From December 2010, the client supports the Webmoney <b>payment</b> <b>system,</b> which is popular in many European, Middle Eastern, and Asian countries. Starting in April 2016, Steam began accepting payments in Bitcoin, valued based on the user's geolocation, with transactions handled by BitPay. The Steam storefront validates the user's region; the purchase of titles may be restricted to specific regions because of release dates, game classification, or agreements with publishers. Since 2010, the Steam Translation Server project offers Steam users to assist with the translation of the Steam client, storefront, and a selected library of Steam games for twenty-seven languages. Steam also allows users to purchase downloadable content for games, and for some specific game titles such as Team Fortress 2, the ability to purchase in-game inventory items.
