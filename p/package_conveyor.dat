40|$|Approved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} unlimitedA simulation model {{is presented in}} this research which models the operating characteristics of the upgraded cargo handling systems supporting underway replenishment for the MARS Class ship conversion program. The replacement of installed <b>package</b> <b>conveyors</b> with elevators will substantially improve the ship's vertical lift capability and consequently should improve cargo handling efforts. In this thesis we develop a simulation model {{to assess the impact}} of this improvement while demonstrating the benefit of using simulation methods as a decision support tool. We present two scenarios; the first provides a preliminary estimate of the vertical lift capability of the newly installed 12, 000 lb capacity elevators. Secondly, the model is expanded to assess one of the main deck cargo handling functions involving forklift operations moving material delivered by one or two of the new 12, 000 lb elevators. The results of the simulation show that forklift cargo delivery functions along the ship's main deck can be expected to be the controlling factor in determining the time required to complete cargo handling operations. Although the model presented is specifically designed for the USS SAN JOSE it is adaptable for use on other ships of the class. U. S. Navy (USN) autho...|$|R

Some require an air-amplifier to blow small products off the belt, but heavier applications require a linear or radial actuator. Some fragile products are rejected by [...] "dropping" [...] the bed so that the product can slide gently into a bin or other conveyor.|$|R
40|$|The PLC based {{motor control}} {{system is the}} key area of {{concerned}} to relate PLC to the real industrial environment. However, there is no PLC based industrial motor control trainer available in the Automation lab of Politeknik Kota Kinabalu for the practical purposes. This has initiated {{the need to develop}} a research and product on the title of “Programmable Logic Controller Based Variable Speed Drives For Educational Trainer”. This research focused on VSD controlled by PLC conventional programming and Fuzzy Logic based PLC programming. A prototype “Two <b>Conveyors</b> <b>Packaging</b> System” has been constructed. This application is to synchronize two conveyors so that parts and packaging boxes are positioned correctly, regardless of the part and package box positions and the speed of conveyor. Several PLC programs were developed individually for sectionals of the prototype application; the input devices photoelectric part sensors (P 004 A), motor encoders E 1 and E 2 (P 004 B) and output device is VSD for box conveyor M 2 (P 004 E). All these programs can work independently; subsequently to be combined to control the whole prototype application with additional PLC program on conventional basis, and fuzzy logic basis (P 004 C and P 004 D). These step by step programming methods contributed to the 10 experiments procedures to achieve the objective to construct the educational trainer procedures. As a conclusion, this research has achieved the objectives to construct the educational trainer procedures to implement PLC conventional and fuzzy logic based programming to control a motor driven by VSD, based on the concept of Prototype Two <b>Conveyor</b> <b>Packaging</b> System...|$|R
40|$|Lixi, Inc. {{has built}} a {{thriving}} business on NASA-developed x-ray technology. The Low Intensity X-ray Imaging scope (LIXI) was designed to use {{less than one percent}} of radiation required by conventional x-ray devices. It is portable and can be used for a variety of industrial inspection systems as well as medical devices. A food processing plant uses the new LIXI Conveyor system to identify small bone fragments in chicken. The chicken <b>packages</b> on a <b>conveyor</b> belt enter an x-ray chamber and the image is displayed on a monitor. Defects measuring less than a millimeter can be detected. An important advantage of the system is its ability to inspect 100 percent of the product right on the production line...|$|R
50|$|The small package sort {{is located}} at CACH, and {{operates}} by unloading incoming packages and distributing them into other bags. Small packages are bagged at the east/west boundary {{and a series of}} conveyor belts, called bullfrogs on the mezzanine. All small packages are sent to a series of sorting machines. The small package sort contains 14 sorting machines, including primary and secondary levels of sorting machines. Small packages are organized and sent to inductors to place small <b>packages</b> on a <b>conveyor</b> of machines. The small packages are read in a tunnel and diverted into their appropriate bags. Once bags are filled, they are placed on a conveyor belt to be sent to the outbound area to be loaded and the full bag is replaced by an empty bag.|$|R

By the time this took place, {{four months after the}} disaster, investigators believed that the explosion started in a basement area beneath the silos, from which sugar was fed up to the <b>packaging</b> building on <b>conveyor</b> belts. The factory's outdated construction materials and methods are believed to have contributed to the severity of the blaze. The ceiling was of wooden tongue and groove design. The creosote used throughout was known as “fat lighter,” because of the fire risk it posed. Interviews of Imperial Sugar employees conducted by OSHA uncovered a lack of training, as 40 of the workers reported never receiving training on how to exit the building in an emergency. Only five employees recalled having a fire drill.|$|R
50|$|Incoming {{trailers}} dock at {{the primary}} section of CACH, located {{in the center of}} the facility. There are 174 trailers in this section, separated into sections of three, called p-modules. Here, packages and bags of small packages are taken out of trailers and put on movable conveyor belts. Individual small packages are put in boxes and sent to the small sort section of the building. The packages are then read in a tunnel by 16 scanners and a camera, which signals a series of paddles to divert the <b>packages</b> onto other <b>conveyor</b> belts. When a box is scanned, the box is diverted to the small sort on the mezzanine, or second level of the building. Items that are not diverted go onto conveyor belts or the DA (Data Acquisition), which relabels packages. Open packages are unloaded from the primary section and put on one of two conveyor belts to be sorted.|$|R

40|$|Today {{much higher}} speed of {{operation}} and highly accurate weighing of packages during crossing a conveyor belt has been {{getting more and more}} important in the food and distribution industries etc. Continuous weighing means that masses of discrete <b>packages</b> on a <b>conveyor</b> belt are automatically determined in sequence. Making the best use of new weighing scale called a multi-stage conveyor belt scale which can be created so as to adjust the conveyor belt length to the product length, we propose a simplified and effective mass estimation algorithm under practical vibration modes. Conveyor belt scales usually have maximum capacities of less than 80 kg and 140 cm, and achieve measuring rates of 150 packages per minute and more. The output signals from the conveyor belt scales are always contaminated with noises due to vibrations of the conveyor belt and the product in motion. In this paper an employed digital filter is of Finite-duration Impulse Response (FIR) type designed under the consideration on the dynamics of conveyor belt scales. The experimental results on conveyor belt scales suggest that the filtering algorithm proposed here is effective enough to practical applications. 1...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} in closed access until 10 th. March 2018. Conveyor belts play an {{important}} role in the production process. Their efficiency and lifespan are strongly influenced by the use of appropriate lubrication systems, cleaning procedures and operator handling. Overuse of chemicals and detergents can result in belt degradation and corrosion. Excessive friction between the packages and the load bearing surface of the conveyors (e. g. belts or chains) can wear the packaging, delay start-ups and increase product waste. A suitably lubricated conveyor system increases longevity and promotes operational reliability. However this has traditionally been achieved by using large amounts of water and harsh detergents. The solution proposed in this study comprises the formulation of a nanodiamond particle-loaded food-grade lubricating oil, a nanolubricant, for use on <b>packaging</b> transport and <b>conveyor</b> systems. Deployed in a ‘dry’ regime, the nanolubricant is hydrophobic, its viscosity is suitable to be sprayed and a long shelf-life ensures stable dispersions. Tribological performance on HDPE conveyor belts transporting aseptic carton packs was studied. When using the nanolubricant, wearing on the packages was reduced 60 % compared to no-lubricating conditions and 17 % lower than current commercial solutions used for benchmarking purposes. The preparation of the nanolubricant using sonication technology presents efficiencies and carbon footprint reductions derived from lower energy consumption in the production process. This nanolubricant is an environmentally friendly solution for the maintenance of machinery for packaging and transporting and a novel mechanism to curb product returns due to aesthetic and structural damages on the packaging...|$|R
