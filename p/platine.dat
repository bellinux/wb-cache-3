5|$|The <b>Platine</b> War {{ended in}} 1852 with the Allied {{victory at the}} Battle of Caseros, for some time {{establishing}} Brazilian hegemony over much of South America. The war ushered a period {{of economic and political}} stability in the Empire of Brazil. With Rosas gone, Argentina began a political process which would result in a more unified state. However, the end of the <b>Platine</b> war did not completely resolve issues within the <b>Platine</b> region. Turmoil continued in subsequent years, with internal disputes among political factions in Uruguay, a long civil war in Argentina, and an emergent Paraguay asserting its claims. Two more major international wars (see:Paraguayan War) followed during the next two decades, sparked by territorial ambitions and conflicts over influence.|$|E
5|$|Barely a {{month later}} on 18 August 1851, Juan Manuel de Rosas, {{dictator}} of the Argentine Confederation, declared war on Brazil, beginning the <b>Platine</b> War. Marques de Sousa had been warned by Caxias as early as 27 July 1844 {{of the possibility of}} an armed conflict between Brazil and its <b>Platine</b> neighbor. The government in Rio de Janeiro had prepared against the threat and formed an anti-Rosas alliance consisting of Brazil, Uruguay and dissident Argentine provinces. Caxias, who had been appointed commander-in-chief of Brazilian land forces, placed Marques de Sousa {{at the head of the}} 2nd Brigade, part of the 2nd Division. The Brazilian army crossed into Uruguay in September 1851. On 17 November, while the army was camped in the village of Santa Lucía near the Uruguayan capital, Marques de Sousa was promoted to a higher command, the 1st division. The choice was controversial, as there were two more senior and experienced officers next in line who were bypassed owing to their foreign birth.|$|E
5|$|The {{end of the}} <b>Platine</b> War did {{not bring}} a halt to {{conflict}} in the region. Peace remained out of reach in Uruguay, which remained unstable and {{in a state of}} constant crisis due to continuing internecine strife between the Blancos and Colorados. Border disputes, power struggles among diverse regional factions, and attempts to establish regional and internal influence would eventually spark the Uruguayan War as well as the later Paraguayan War.|$|E
5|$|A {{few years}} later, in 1835 his native {{province}} of Rio Grande do Sul was engulfed in a secessionist rebellion, the Ragamuffin War. The conflict lasted for almost ten years, and the Count was leading military engagements {{for most of}} that time. He played a decisive role in saving the provincial capital from the Ragamuffin rebels, allowing forces loyal to the legitimate government to secure a key foothold. In 1852, he led a Brazilian division during the <b>Platine</b> War in an invasion of the Argentine Confederation that overthrew its dictator. He was awarded a noble title, eventually raised from baron to viscount and finally to count.|$|E
5|$|After the British invasions {{had been}} repelled, Rosas {{and his family}} moved from Buenos Aires to their estancia (ranch). His work there further shaped his {{character}} and outlook {{as part of the}} <b>Platine</b> region's social establishment. In the Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata, owners of large landholdings (including the Rosas family) provided food, equipment and protection for families living in areas under their control. Their private defense forces consisted primarily of laborers who were drafted as soldiers. Most of these peons, as such workers were called, were gauchos.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Brazil, now {{ascendant}} under Emperor Dom PedroII, provided {{support to}} the Uruguayan government that still held out in Montevideo, {{as well as to}} the ambitious Justo José de Urquiza, a caudillo in Entre Ríos who rebelled against Rosas. Once one of Rosas' most trusted lieutenants, Urquiza now claimed to fight for a constitutional government, although his ambition to become head of state was barely disguised. In retaliation, Rosas declared war on Brazil on 18 August 1851, beginning the <b>Platine</b> War. The army under Oribe in Uruguay surrendered to Urquiza in October. With arms and financial aid given by Brazil, Urquiza then marched through Argentine territory heading to Buenos Aires.|$|E
5|$|On 26 May 1850, Joaquim Inácio was {{appointed}} inspector {{of the naval}} shipyard at Rio de Janeiro. He played {{no role in the}} <b>Platine</b> War that pitted the Empire against the Argentine Confederation (the successor state of the United Provinces of the River Plate), which lasted from late 1851 until early 1852. He spent that period in the capital overseeing the construction and repair of several sailing vessels and steamships for the Brazilian armada. He was promoted to chief of division (modern-day rear admiral) on 3 March 1852.|$|E
5|$|Paranhos {{began to}} write {{articles}} in support of Brazil's proactive foreign policy, which brought him close to the ruling Conservative party. The Minister of Foreign Affairs, Paulino Soares de Sousa (later the Viscount of Uruguai), appointed the Conservative Party's main leader, Honório Hermeto Carneiro Leão (later the Marquis of Paraná), as a special plenipotentiary diplomat for the <b>Platine</b> region. Unexpectedly, Carneiro Leão decided to take Paranhos as his secretary, passing over the more experienced members of Brazil's diplomatic corps. On 23 October 1851, both departed for Montevideo, the Uruguayan capital.|$|E
5|$|The {{moderate}} Conservatives were Conservatives in name only, and did {{not support}} the saquarema ideology and leadership. During the years following 1857, successive cabinets quickly collapsed, unable to muster a majority in the Chamber of Deputies, as the two Conservative wings undercut each other in a fight for dominance. The Emperor asked Caxias to head a new cabinet on 2 March 1861. Among his ministers were José Maria da Silva Paranhos (later Viscount of Rio Branco), whom Caxias had met and befriended during the <b>Platine</b> War while serving as secretary to Paraná.|$|E
5|$|During PedroII's {{minority}} {{the governing}} regency faced countless rebellions throughout the country. Again breaking {{with his father}} and other relatives sympathetic to the rebels, from 1839 to 1845 Caxias commanded loyalist forces suppressing such uprisings as the Balaiada, the Liberal rebellions of 1842 and the Ragamuffin War. In 1851, under his command, the Brazilian army prevailed against the Argentine Confederation in the <b>Platine</b> War; a decade later Caxias, as army marshal (the army's highest rank), led Brazilian forces to victory in the Paraguayan War. As a reward he was raised to the titled nobility, becoming successively a baron, count, and marquis, finally becoming the only person created duke during PedroII's 58-year reign.|$|E
5|$|For the Brazilian Empire, expansionist {{plans on}} the part of powerful, republican Argentina {{represented}} an existential threat. It also signified a threat to Brazilian hegemony across its southern borders. A successful Argentine bid to incorporate Paraguay and Uruguay into a reconstituted Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata (and control of the <b>Platine</b> river network consequently passing into entirely hostile hands) would have threatened to cut communication between the Brazilian province of Mato Grosso and Rio de Janeiro. With river transportation denied, the alternative land routes would require months of travel instead of days. Nor was Brazil keen to share a direct border with Argentina, fearing an increased vulnerability to an invasion by Rosas.|$|E
5|$|The Brazilian Armed Forces {{were created}} in the {{aftermath}} of Independence. They were originally composed of Brazilian- and Portuguese-born officers and troops who had remained loyal to the government in Rio de Janeiro during the war of secession from Portugal. The Armed Forces were crucial to the successful outcomes of international conflicts faced by the Empire, starting with Independence (1822–1824), followed by the Cisplatine War (1825–1828), then the <b>Platine</b> War (1851–1852), the Uruguayan War (1864–1865) and, finally, the Paraguayan War (1864–1870). They also played a part in quelling rebellions, beginning with the Confederation of the Equator (1824) under PedroI, followed by the uprisings during PedroII's early reign, such as the Ragamuffin War (1835–1845), Cabanagem (1835–1840), Balaiada (1838–1841), among others.|$|E
5|$|The ultraconservatives {{who opposed}} the Conciliation policy were led by the Viscount of Itaboraí, Eusébio de Queirós and the Viscount of Uruguai. These elder statesmen were of the same {{generation}} as the late Carneiro Leão and had taken {{the leadership of the}} Conservative Party after his death. Although conservative in name, they had repeatedly proven more progressive in many areas than their rivals, the Liberals. The Viscount of Uruguai had been Paranhos's protector since the 1851 diplomatic mission and greatly influenced his protégé, who stood by the ultraconservatives. Paranhos managed to persuade Luis Alves de Lima e Silva (who had been commander-in-chief during the <b>Platine</b> War, his colleague as War Minister in the Conciliation Cabinet, and later the Duke of Caxias) to stay {{on the side of the}} Conservative Party's old guard.|$|E
5|$|When the Empire of Brazil began aiding Uruguay in its {{struggle}} against Argentina, Rosas declared war in August 1851, starting the <b>Platine</b> War. This short conflict ended with Rosas being defeated and absconding to Britain. His last years were spent in exile {{living as a}} tenant farmer {{until his death in}} 1877. Rosas garnered an enduring public perception among Argentines as a brutal tyrant. Since the 1930s, an authoritarian, anti-Semitic, and racist political movement in Argentina called Revisionism has tried to improve Rosas's reputation and establish a new dictatorship in the model of his regime. In 1989, his remains were repatriated by the government in an attempt to promote national unity, seeking forgiveness for him and especially for the 1970s military dictatorship. Rosas remains a controversial figure in Argentina in the 21st century.|$|E
5|$|With {{the opening}} of the <b>Platine</b> rivers, Paraguay now found it {{possible}} to contract with European technicians and Brazilian specialists to aid in its development. Unhindered access to the outside world also enabled it to import more advanced military technology. During the greater part of the 1850s, the dictator Carlos López harassed Brazilian vessels attempting to freely navigate the Paraguay River. López feared that the province of Mato Grosso might become a base from which an invasion from Brazil could be launched. This dispute was also leverage with the Imperial government for acceptance of his territorial demands in the region. The nation also experienced difficulties in delimiting its borders with Argentina which wanted the whole Gran Chaco region: a demand which Paraguay could not accept, as this would entail surrendering more than half of its national territory.|$|E
5|$|Inheriting an Empire on {{the verge}} of disintegration, PedroII turned Portuguese-speaking Brazil into an {{emerging}} power in the international arena. The nation grew to be distinguished from its Hispanic neighbors on account of its political stability, zealously guarded freedom of speech, respect for civil rights, vibrant economic growth and especially for its form of government: a functional, representative parliamentary monarchy. Brazil was also victorious in three international conflicts (the <b>Platine</b> War, the Uruguayan War and the Paraguayan War) under his rule, as well as prevailing in several other international disputes and domestic tensions. PedroII steadfastly pushed through the abolition of slavery despite opposition from powerful political and economic interests. A savant in his own right, the Emperor established a reputation as a vigorous sponsor of learning, culture and the sciences. He won the respect and admiration of scholars such as Charles Darwin, Victor Hugo and Friedrich Nietzsche, and was a friend to Richard Wagner, Louis Pasteur and Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, among others.|$|E
5|$|The cabinet settled upon a risky {{alternative}} {{to resolve the}} complicated situation in the <b>Platine</b> region. Instead of undertaking a period of conscription {{to build up the}} Brazilian Army, which would have been costly, the Council decided to rely on the standing army. It sent a contingent south to secure the region. Brazil held an advantage in possessing a powerful and modern navy, along with an experienced professional army hardened by years of internal and external warfare. Up until this point, no other nation in South America possessed true navies or regular armies. Rosas' and Oribe's forces were largely made up of irregular troops on loan from those caudillos who supported them. Even a decade later, Argentina could only field an army of 6,000 men. Brazil also decided to adopt Rosas' own tactics by financing his opponents to weaken him both internally and externally.|$|E
5|$|The third {{crisis was}} a {{conflict}} with the Argentine Confederation over ascendancy in territories adjacent to the Río de la Plata and free navigation of that waterway. Since the 1830s, Argentine dictator Juan Manuel de Rosas had supported rebellions within Uruguay and Brazil. The Empire was unable to address {{the threat posed by}} Rosas until 1850, when an alliance was forged between Brazil, Uruguay and disaffected Argentines, leading to the <b>Platine</b> War and the subsequent overthrow of the Argentine ruler in February 1852. The Empire's successful navigation of these crises considerably enhanced the nation's stability and prestige, and Brazil emerged as a hemispheric power. Internationally, Europeans came to see the country as embodying familiar liberal ideals, such as freedom of the press and constitutional respect for civil liberties. Its representative parliamentary monarchy also stood {{in stark contrast to the}} mix of dictatorships and instability endemic in the other nations of South America during this period.|$|E
5|$|The {{triumph in}} Caseros was a pivotal {{military}} victory for Brazil. The independence of Paraguay and Uruguay was secured, and the planned Argentine invasion of Rio Grande do Sul was blocked. In {{a period of}} three years, the Empire of Brazil had destroyed any possibility of reconstituting a state encompassing the territories of old Viceroyalty of the Rio de la Plata, a goal cherished by many in Argentina since independence. Brazil's army and fleet had accomplished what Great Britain and France, the great powers of that time, had not achieved through interventions by their powerful navies. This represented a watershed for the history of the region as it not only ushered in Imperial hegemony over the <b>Platine</b> region, but, according to Brazilian historian J. F. Maya Pedrosa, also in the rest of South America. The War of the Triple Alliance eighteen years later would only be a confirmation of Brazilian dominance.|$|E
5|$|PedroI's {{successor}} in Brazil was his five-year-old son, PedroII. As {{the latter}} was still a minor, a weak regency was created. The power vacuum resulting from {{the absence of a}} ruling monarch as the ultimate arbiter in political disputes led to regional civil wars between local factions. Having inherited an empire on the verge of disintegration, PedroII, once he was declared of age, managed to bring peace and stability to the country, which eventually became an emerging international power. Brazil was victorious in three international conflicts (the <b>Platine</b> War, the Uruguayan War and the Paraguayan War) under PedroII's rule, and the Empire prevailed in several other international disputes and outbreaks of domestic strife. With prosperity and economic development came an influx of European immigration, including Protestants and Jews, although Brazil remained mostly Catholic. Slavery, which had initially been widespread, was restricted by successive legislation until its final abolition in 1888. Brazilian visual arts, literature and theater developed during this time of progress. Although heavily influenced by European styles that ranged from Neoclassicism to Romanticism, each concept was adapted to create a culture that was uniquely Brazilian.|$|E
25|$|Conflict in {{the region}} {{intensified}} after {{the independence of the}} former Spanish and Portuguese colonies {{in the first quarter of}} the 19th century. Interests in the territories and the navigation rights over the <b>Platine</b> region played a major role in many armed conflicts throughout the century, including the Argentine civil wars, the Cisplatine and <b>Platine</b> wars, and the Paraguayan War. The river was blockaded by extra-regional powers 18381840 and 18451850.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} {{theories}} regarding {{the origins of}} the war. The traditional view emphasizes the policies of Paraguayan president Francisco Solano López, who used the Uruguayan War as a pretext to gain control of the <b>Platine</b> basin. This caused a response from the regional hegemons Brazil and Argentina, who exercised influence over the much smaller republics of Uruguay and Paraguay.|$|E
25|$|The {{foreign affairs}} in the monarchy were {{basically}} related issues with {{the countries of the}} Southern Cone with which Brazil has borders. Long after the Cisplatine War that resulted in independence for Uruguay, Brazil won three international wars during the 58-year reign of PedroII. These were the <b>Platine</b> War, the Uruguayan War and the devastating Paraguayan War, the largest war effort in Brazilian history.|$|E
25|$|The {{city was}} {{established}} in 1724 by a Spanish soldier, Bruno Mauricio de Zabala, as a strategic move amidst the Spanish-Portuguese dispute over the <b>platine</b> region. It was also under brief British rule in 1807. Montevideo hosted all the matches during the first FIFA World Cup. Montevideo is {{the seat of the}} administrative headquarters of Mercosur and ALADI, Latin America’s leading trade blocs, position that entailed comparisons to the role of Brussels in Europe.|$|E
25|$|The war {{has also}} been {{attributed}} to the after-effects of colonialism in South America, with border conflicts between the new states, the struggle for power among neighboring nations over the strategic Río de la Plata region, Brazilian and Argentine meddling in internal Uruguayan politics (which had already caused the <b>Platine</b> War), and Solano López's efforts to help his allies in Uruguay (previously defeated by the Brazilians), {{as well as his}} presumed expansionist ambitions.|$|E
25|$|José Luís held several {{positions}} {{during the}} years {{following the end of}} the Ragamuffin threat in 1845. His most important posting was command over the cavalry unit that served as Emperor Dom PedroII's personal guard in the national capital, Rio de Janeiro. He also fought against the Argentine Confederation in the brief <b>Platine</b> War, which lasted from 1851 until 1852. In 1864, he led one of the two divisions which comprised the Brazilian army in the Uruguayan War. During that conflict, he led the initial invasion of Uruguay and fought in two crucial engagements that resulted in the capture of two Uruguayan towns.|$|E
25|$|The {{conflicts}} in the <b>Platine</b> region did not cease after the war of 1825. The anarchy caused by the despotic Rosas and his desire to subdue Bolívia, Uruguay and Paraguay forced Brazil to intercede. The Brazilian Government sent a naval force of 17 warships (a ship of the line, 10 corvettes and six steamships) commanded by the veteran John Pascoe Grenfell. The Brazilian fleet succeeded in passing through the Argentine line of defence in The Tonelero Pass under heavy attack and transported the troops to the theater of operations. The Brazilian Armada had a total of 59 vessels of various types in 1851: 36 armed sailing ships, 10 armed steamships, seven unarmed sailing ships and six sailing transports.|$|E
25|$|In {{the years}} that followed, José Luís {{remained}} in the 3rd brigade. He was given a leave from 8 January 1848 until 8 May. He was next appointed to a bureaucratic position charged with administrative duties for the 4th Regiment of Light Cavalry on 23 May. José Luís received a promotion to brevet major on 30 August 1849. In January 1850, he marched to Bagé, and later to Quaraim, to maintain order {{after a series of}} disturbances broke out in those regions. Juan Manuel de Rosas, dictator of the Argentine Confederation, declared war on Brazil on 18 August 1851, beginning the <b>Platine</b> War. The government in Rio de Janeiro had prepared against the threat and formed an anti-Rosas alliance consisting of Brazil, Uruguay (former Cisplatina) and dissident Argentine provinces. A Brazilian army crossed into Uruguay in September 1851. The 4th Regiment was of Light Cavalry part of this expedition, serving under the 1st Division. The Brazilians were victorious, and José Luís was rewarded with confirmation in the rank of major on 19 June 1852.|$|E
25|$|It {{was during}} this time that the Cisplatine War, the first armed {{conflict}} between both countries, started. From 1825 to 1828 {{the forces of the}} United Provinces of the Río de la Plata outfought those of the Brazilian Empire, until the signing of the Treaty of Montevideo that gave independence to Uruguay from both countries. Given the high cost of the war for both sides and the burdens it imposed on trade between the United Provinces and the United Kingdom, the latter pressed the two belligerent parties to engage in peace negotiations in Rio de Janeiro. Under British and French mediation, the United Provinces of River Plate and the Empire of Brazil signed the 1828 Treaty of Montevideo, which acknowledged the independence of the Cisplatine Province under the name Eastern Republic of Uruguay. Troops of both countries would face each other once again later, during the <b>Platine</b> War, when a coalition of Brazil, Uruguay and Argentine rebels managed to defeat Rosas (helped in turn by Uruguayan rebels led by Manuel Oribe). Another war almost happened during the 1870s when Brazil refused to accept Argentina's desire to take all the Chaco region for itself {{after the end of the}} Paraguayan War (also known as the War of the Triple Alliance) when both countries were allies against Paraguay.|$|E
500|$|The <b>Platine</b> War (18 August 1851– 3 February 1852) {{was fought}} between the Argentine Confederation and an {{alliance}} {{consisting of the}} Empire of Brazil, Uruguay and the Argentine provinces of Entre Ríos and Corrientes. The war {{was part of a}} long-running interest disputes between Argentina and Brazil for influence over Uruguay and Paraguay, and hegemony over the <b>Platine</b> region (areas bordering the Río de la Plata). The conflict took place in Uruguay, on the Río de la Plata, and northeastern Argentina. Uruguay's internal troubles, including the long-running Uruguayan Civil War, [...] "La Guerra Grande" [...] (The Great War), were heavily influential factors leading to the <b>Platine</b> War.|$|E
500|$|The loss {{of trade}} was {{unacceptable}} to Britain and France. On 17 September 1845 both nations established the Anglo-French blockade of the Río de la Plata and enforced the free navigation in the Río de la Plata Basin (or <b>Platine</b> region). Argentina resisted {{the pressure and}} fought back to a standstill. This undeclared war caused more economic harm to France and Britain than to Argentina. The British faced increasing pressure at home once they realised that the access gained to the other ports within the <b>Platine</b> region did not compensate {{for the loss of}} trade with Buenos Aires. Britain ended all hostilities and lifted the blockade on 15 July 1847, followed by France on 12 June 1848. Rosas had successfully resisted the two most powerful nations on Earth; his standing, and Argentina's, increased among Hispanic American nations. The Venezuelan humanist Andrés Bello, summarizing the prevailing opinion, considered Rosas among [...] "the leading ranks of the great men of America".|$|E
500|$|The third crisis entailed a {{conflict}} with the Argentine Confederation regarding ascendancy over territories adjacent to the Río de la Plata and free navigation of that waterway. Since the 1830s, Argentine dictator Juan Manuel de Rosas had supported rebellions within Uruguay and Brazil. It was only in 1850 that Brazil was able to address {{the threat posed by}} Rosas. An alliance was forged between Brazil, Uruguay and disaffected Argentines, leading to the <b>Platine</b> War and the subsequent overthrow of the Argentine ruler in February 1852. Barman said that a [...] "considerable portion of the credit must be... assigned to the Emperor, whose cool head, tenacity of purpose, and sense of what was feasible proved indispensable." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1850, the <b>Platine</b> {{region was}} {{politically}} unstable. Although the Governor of Buenos Aires Juan Manuel de Rosas had used his political influence [...] to gain dictatorial control over other Argentine provinces, his rule {{was plagued by}} a series of regional rebellions. Meanwhile, Uruguay struggled with its own civil war which started after gaining independence from the Brazilian Empire in 1828 (no longer the Cisplatine Province) after conclusion of Cisplatine War. Rosas backed the Uruguayan Blanco party in this conflict, and further desired to extend Argentine borders to areas formerly occupied by the Spanish Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata. This meant asserting control over Uruguay, Paraguay, and Bolivia. This threatened Brazilian interests and sovereignty since the old Spanish Viceroyalty had also included territories which had long been incorporated into Brazilian province of Rio Grande do Sul.|$|E
500|$|The {{diplomatic}} mission arrived in Asunción on 20 February 1869. Asunción {{was then a}} small town of unpaved streets and many buildings constructed of little more than straw. With Paraguayan dictator Francisco Solano López on the run, the country lacked a government. Paranhos had to create a provisional government which could sign a peace accord and recognize the border claimed by Brazil between the two nations. Even with Paraguay devastated, the power vacuum resulting from López's overthrow was quickly filled by emerging domestic factions which Paranhos had to accommodate. According to historian Francisco Doratioto, Paranhos, [...] "the then-greatest Brazilian specialist on <b>Platine</b> affairs", had a [...] "decisive" [...] role in creating a democratic Paraguayan government. Paraguay thus survived as an independent nation. Later, on 20 June 1870, preliminary peace protocols were signed. The final peace treaty accepting Brazilian claims was signed in January 1872.|$|E
500|$|On 3 March 1852, Marques de Sousa {{was raised}} {{to the rank of}} field marshal, and Emperor Dom PedroII conferred on him the noble title of Barão de Porto Alegre (Baron of Porto Alegre). It was a reward for his victory at Caseros, but also a nod to his role in saving the capital of Rio Grande do Sul during 1836. His {{exploits}} achieved great renown in Brazil, where he was referred to as the [...] "Vanquisher of the <b>Platine</b> Tiger [...] ". He replaced Caxias as head of the army that had fought in the war on 26 June, after its return to Brazil. Soon after, on 24 September, the Baron of Porto Alegre was removed from that post and made comandante das armas (military commander) of Rio Grande do Sul, a position he held until he requested to be relieved on 5 March 1853.|$|E
500|$|The {{members of}} the Brazilian Cabinet could not reach {{agreement}} {{as to how to}} address the danger posed by Rosas. Some ministers advocated seeking a peaceful resolution at any cost. These feared Brazil was unprepared for war and that a defeat would lead to a situation similar to the chaos following the loss of Cisplatine in the 1820s, which ended in abdication by Dom Pedro I, the Emperor's father. Other ministers took the position that only a military response would eliminate the threat. In 1849, however, Paulino José Soares de Sousa, a member of the pro-war faction and later Viscount of Uruguai, was chosen as the new minister of Foreign Affairs. Soares made clear his intent to deal with Argentina without foreign assistance, announcing that the [...] "Imperial Government does not desire or judge convenient an alliance with France or any other European nation related to the matters in the <b>Platine</b> region. It understands that they must be resolved by the nations which [...] are closely connected with... It will not admit European influence over America." [...] The Empire of Brazil was determined to extend its zone of influence over South America.|$|E
