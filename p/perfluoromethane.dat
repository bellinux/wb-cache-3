40|$|We have {{performed}} kinetic Monte Carlo simulations for diusion of methane, <b>perfluoromethane</b> and 2 -methylhexane in silicalite {{to study the}} inter-relations between self-, jump- and transport-diusivities. Both the self- and jump-diu-sivities were found to decrease with occupancy, or loading, within the zeolite matrix. Correlation eects cause the self-diusivity to be lower in value than the jump-diusivity. Using the Maxwell–Stefan theory for diusion we derive a simple formula to relate the self- and jump-diusivities. Ó 2001 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved. 1...|$|E
40|$|International audienceWe {{have used}} the hetero-SAFT-VR {{approach}} to investigate the phase equilibria {{of a number of}} binary and ternary mixtures of n -alkanes, perﬂuoro-n -alkanes, and perﬂuoroalkylalkane diblock surfactants. We focussed our work on the understanding of the microscopic conditions that control the phase behaviour of these mixtures, with a particular emphasis of the eﬀect on the liquid-liquid separation and the stabilisation of n -alkane + perﬂuoro-n -alkane mixtures when a diblock surfactant is added. We selected the n -heptane + <b>perﬂuoromethane</b> binary mixture, and studied the changes on the phase behaviour when a symmetric (same number of alkyl and perﬂuoroalkyl chemical groups) or an asymmetric (diﬀerent number of alkyl and perﬂuoroalkyl chemical groups) diblock surfactants is added to the binary mixture. We have obtained the phase diagrams {{of a wide range of}} binary and ternary mixtures at diﬀerent thermodynamic conditions. We have found a variety of interesting behaviours as we modify the alkyl or/and the perﬂuoroalkyl chain-length of the diblock surfactants: the usual changes in the vapour-liquid phase separation, changes in the type of phase diagrams (typically from type I to type V phase behaviour according to the Scott and Konynenburg classiﬁcation), azeotropy, and Bancroft points. We noted that the main eﬀect of adding a symmetric or an asymmetric surfactant to the n -heptane + <b>perﬂuoromethane</b> mixture is to stabilise the system, i. e., to decrease the two-phase (liquid-liquid) immiscibility region of the ternary diagram as the surfactant concentration is increased...|$|E
40|$|The phase {{behavior}} of perfluoro-(n) -alkane + (n) -alkane binary mixtures {{is of particular}} interest given their unexpected large positive deviations from Raoult’s law. Binary mixtures of <b>perfluoromethane</b> + (n) -alkanes from methane to heptane are studied here, illustrating the continuous change in phase behavior from type II to type III that these systems exhibit. Some symmetrical systems that display heteroazeotropy are also examined. Using the statistical associating fluid theory for potentials of variable attractive range (SAFT-VR),we predict the high-pressure phase diagram for each binary mixture studied. The perfluoro-n-alkane and n-alkane molecules are treated as attractive spherical segments tangentially bonded together to form chains. We use simple empirical relationships between the number of carbon atoms and the number of segments in each chain. The attractive interactions are included as a square-well potential of depth and range ì. The pure component parameters are obtained by fitting to experimental vapor pressure and saturated liquid density data from the triple to the critical point. These optimized parameters are rescaled by the respective experimenta...|$|E
40|$|A {{recently}} developed statistical mechanical Quasi-Chemical Theory (QCT) {{has led to}} significant insights into solvation phenomena for both hydrophilic and hydrophobic solutes. The QCT exactly partitions solvation free energies into three components: 1) inner-shell chemical, 2) outer-shell packing, and 3) outer-shell long-ranged contributions. In this paper, we discuss efficient methods for computing {{each of the three}} parts of the free energy. A Bayesian estimation approach is developed to compute the inner-shell chemical and outer-shell packing contributions. We derive upper and lower bounds on the outer-shell long-ranged portion of the free energy by expressing this component in two equivalent ways. Local, high energy contacts between solute and solvent are eliminated by spatial conditioning in this free energy piece, leading to near-Gaussian distributions of solute-solvent interactions energies. Thus, the average of the two mean-field bounds yields an accurate and efficient free energy estimate. Aqueous solvation free energy results are presented for several solutes, including methane, <b>perfluoromethane,</b> water, and the sodium and chloride ions. The results demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the methods. The approach should prove useful in computing solvation free energies in inhomogeneous, restricted environments.

40|$|Sulfur hexafluoride (SF 6), <b>perfluoromethane</b> (CF 4) and {{perfluoroethane}} (C 2 F 6) {{are strong}} greenhouse gases with long (> 1000 year) atmospheric residence times. We derive emission factors {{for the major}} anthropogenic sources and project future emissions for 5 regions and the world. Although firms in many industrialized countries are already limiting emissions, without further policy intervention global emissions will rise 150 % (CF 4 and C 2 F 6) and 210 % (SF 6) between 1990 and 2050; radiative forcing will increase 0. 026 W m- 2. Full application of available low-cost and costless policies in industrialized nations would cut that radiative forcing by one-quarter. Increased forcing due to these gases is small (< 2 %) relative to other gases but permanent on the timescale of human civilization. We also quantify plausible manipulations to governmental data {{that will be used}} to determine compliance with the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, which includes commitments for industrialized countries to regulate these and other greenhouse gases. More complete and transparent data are urgently needed. West European nations, for example, can ‘cut’ their emissions of these gases by half by 2010 simply by manipulating emission factors within the current bounds of uncertainty...|$|E
40|$|Sulfur hexafluoride (SF 6), <b>perfluoromethane</b> (CF 4) and {{perfluoroethane}} (C 2 F 6) {{are strong}} greenhouse gases with long atmospheric residence times. Under the Kyoto Protocol to the Framework Convention on Climate Change adopted in December 1997, industrialized nations agreed to regulate their emissions of these gases. Here {{we present a}} simple spreadsheet model that is useful for projecting future emissions and analyzing compliance with regulatory commitments. We use atmospheric measurements of these gases and engineering studies to derive emission factors and scenarios {{for each of the}} major anthropogenic sources (leakage from electrical equipment, magnesium casting, aluminum smelting and semiconductor fabrication). Our model is useful for policy analysis because it divides the world into regions of nations that correspond with the political coalitions that dominate the international negotiations through which regulatory commitments are adopted. We show that although firms in many industrialized countries are already limiting emissions, without further policy intervention global emissions will rise 150 % (CF 4 and C 2 F 6) and 210 % (SF 6) between 1990 to 2050; radiative forcing will increase 0. 026 W m- 2. Full application of available low- and negative-cost policies in industrialized nations would cut that radiative forcing by one-quarter. We also quantify plausible future manipulations to governmental data and show their possible effect on compliance with the targets of the Kyoto Protocol. West European nations can "cut" their emissions of these gases by half by 2010 simply by manipulating emission factors within the current bounds of uncertainty. The need for more complete and transparent data on these gases is urgent. ...|$|E
