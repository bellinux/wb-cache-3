5|$|Some species, {{notably the}} Australian <b>paralysis</b> <b>tick,</b> are also {{intrinsically}} venomous {{and can cause}} tick paralysis. Eggs can become infected with pathogens inside a female tick's ovaries, {{in which case the}} larval ticks are infectious immediately at hatching, before feeding on their first host. Tropical bont ticks transmit the rickettsial disease heartwater which can be particularly devastating in cattle. The ticks carried by migratory birds may act as reservoirs and vectors of infectious diseases. Over twenty strains of pathogenic virus were found in the autumn in the Egyptian migratory bird study.|$|E
25|$|The use {{of common}} names {{has led to}} many colloquial {{expressions}} for Ixodes holocyclus. The most generally accepted name used within Australia is Australian <b>paralysis</b> <b>tick</b> or simply <b>paralysis</b> <b>tick.</b> The following table gives {{some of the other}} names used to describe various stages of Ixodes holocyclus.|$|E
25|$|Whilst {{pioneering}} settlers {{knew that}} ticks posed {{a threat to}} their dogs and perhaps to themselves, the <b>paralysis</b> <b>tick</b> was not scientifically identified until 1899 (by Neumann). It was further studied by Nuttal and Warburton (1911).|$|E
25|$|The {{distribution}} map gives only an {{approximation of}} the <b>Paralysis</b> <b>Tick's</b> distribution {{as the situation}} is not static. There are reports of <b>paralysis</b> <b>ticks</b> from inland Victoria, including north-eastern suburbs of Melbourne. This may reflect general movement of insects and ticks from equatorial to polar latitudes which in turn {{may be related to}} global warming.|$|R
25|$|The {{need for}} humid {{conditions}} largely determines the botanical niche of Australian <b>paralysis</b> <b>ticks.</b> Low, leafy vegetation provides higher humidity levels {{by reducing the}} desiccating effects of wind and direct sunlight. This environment also suits the tick's major host, the bandicoot, as it seeks out grubs and worms in the leaf litter. Certain vegetation may be conducive to <b>paralysis</b> <b>ticks.</b>|$|R
25|$|<b>Paralysis</b> <b>ticks</b> {{can and do}} climb trees. In fact nymphs {{and adults}} climb many meters to the very tops, but descend in windy or dry weather. Larvae appear to remain closer to ground. They {{reportedly}} will fall near and onto people sitting underneath.|$|R
25|$|Paralysis ticks {{are found}} in many types of habitat {{particularly}} areas of high rainfall such as wet sclerophyll forest and temperate rainforest. The natural hosts for the <b>paralysis</b> <b>tick</b> include koalas, bandicoots, possums and kangaroos.|$|E
25|$|It is {{important}} to note that when the Australian <b>paralysis</b> <b>tick</b> is removed, the signs usually continue to worsen for up to 48 hours, though worsening is usually most pronounced in the first 12–24 hours after removal.|$|E
25|$|Humid {{conditions}} {{are essential for}} survival of the <b>paralysis</b> <b>tick.</b> Dry conditions, relatively high temperatures (32°C) and low temperatures (7°C) are lethal for all stages after a few days. An ambient temperature of 27°C and high relative humidity {{is thought to be}} optimal for rapid development. Very dry or very wet {{conditions are}} not ideal.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Tick</b> <b>paralysis</b> is {{believed}} to be due to toxins found in the tick's saliva that enter the bloodstream while the tick is feeding. The two ticks most commonly associated with North American <b>tick</b> <b>paralysis</b> are the Rocky Mountain wood tick (Dermacentor andersoni) and the American dog tick (Dermacentor variabilis); however, 43 tick species have been implicated in human disease around the world. Most North American cases of <b>tick</b> <b>paralysis</b> occur from April to June, when adult Dermacentor ticks emerge from hibernation and actively seek hosts. [...] In Australia, <b>tick</b> <b>paralysis</b> is caused by the tick Ixodes holocyclus. Prior to 1989, 20 fatal cases were reported in Australia.|$|R
50|$|The inlet {{covers a}} {{surface area of}} 38 ha and is fed by the Wingan River and {{provides}} outflow to the Tasman Sea. It features a ranger-managed camping ground, about an hour's drive from the nearest town, Cann River, along a rough stretch of dirt road. The inlet and its surrounds are home to many species of marine life, including crabs, Sydney rock oysters and other shellfish, as well as birds and small mammals. <b>Paralysis</b> <b>ticks,</b> Lace Monitors and snakes are common.|$|R
2500|$|The {{number of}} <b>paralysis</b> <b>ticks</b> {{required}} to paralyse a horse is unknown {{but in one}} study [...] there were cases of large horses with only one to two ticks being paralysed and unable to stand. Horses of any age and size can be affected by <b>tick</b> <b>paralysis.</b> In the same study, 26% of the horses died and of the surviving horses, 35% developed one or more complications including pressure sores, corneal ulcers, pneumonia and sepsis. The relatively high mortality rates in horses in this study {{could be due to}} a range of factors including horses being badly affected before vets are called, difficulties associated with nursing a recumbent horse, difficulties with owners needing to deliver the bulk of nursing care and lack of information to veterinarians managing the disease in horses.|$|R
25|$|In {{the first}} half of the 20th century at least 20 human deaths had been {{attributed}} to the <b>paralysis</b> <b>tick.</b> Eighty percent of the victims reported in NSW between 1904 and 1945 were children aged under four years. Many cases of 'infantile paralysis' (later known as poliomyelitis) may well have been misdiagnosed and actually been cases of tick paralysis.|$|E
25|$|Ixodes holocyclus, {{commonly}} known as the Australian <b>paralysis</b> <b>tick,</b> is one of about 75 species of Australian tick fauna and is considered the most medically important. It can cause paralysis by injecting neurotoxins into its host. It is usually found in a 20-kilometre wide band following the eastern coastline of Australia. Within this range Ixodes holocyclus is the tick most frequently encountered by humans and their pets. As this area also contains the majority of Australia's most densely populated regions, incidents of bites on people, pets and livestock are relatively common.|$|E
25|$|There is a {{concentration}} of saliva and presumably toxin in the granulomatous reaction around the tick mouth parts. It is thought by some experimenters that the residual toxin located in this granuloma is at least partially responsible for the increasing paralysis which occurs after the tick is removed. By comparison, the North American <b>paralysis</b> <b>tick</b> Dermacentor andersoni (found in the Rocky Mtns) does not produce a granuloma {{at the site of}} attachment, and in this case the paralysis rapidly regresses after the tick is removed. Unlike Dermacentor andersoni, Ixodes holocyclus is a deep feeder with a long hypostome (which may penetrate as deep as 1689um).|$|E
40|$|Background: <b>Tick</b> <b>paralysis,</b> {{resultant}} from envenomation by the scrub-tick Ixodes holocyclus, is {{a serious}} threat for small companion animals in the eastern coast of Australia. We hypothesise that surveillance systems that are built on Internet search queries may provide a more timely indication of high-risk periods more effectively than current approaches. Methods: Monthly <b>tick</b> <b>paralysis</b> notifications in dogs and cats across Australia and the states of Queensland (QLD) and New South Wales (NSW) were retrieved from Disease WatchDog surveillance system for the period 2011 - 2013. Internet search terms related to <b>tick</b> <b>paralysis</b> in small companion animals were identified using Google Correlate, and corresponding search frequency metrics were downloaded from Google Trends. Spearman 2 ̆ 7 s rank correlations and time series cross correlations were performed to assess which Google search terms lead or are synchronous with <b>tick</b> <b>paralysis</b> notifications. Results: Metrics data were available for 24 relevant search terms at national level, 16 for QLD and 18 for NSW, {{and they were all}} significantly correlated with <b>tick</b> <b>paralysis</b> notifications (P < 0. 05).

40|$|<b>Tick</b> <b>paralysis</b> is {{a disease}} that occurs worldwide. It is a {{relatively}} rare but potentially fatal condition. The only way to establish the diagnosis is to carefully search for the <b>tick</b> <b>paralysis.</b> It {{is caused by a}} neurotoxin secreted by engorged female <b>ticks.</b> <b>Tick</b> <b>paralysis</b> generally begins in the lower extremities and ascends symmetrically to involve the trunk, upper extremities and head within a few hours. Although early‐onset prominent bulbar palsy and isolated facial weakness without generalised paralysis are rare, there is no report in the English literature concerning isolated, reversible involvement of the upper trunk of brachial plexus caused by tick bite. We report a case of isolated, reversible involvement of the upper trunk of brachial plexus as a variant of <b>tick</b> <b>paralysis.</b> Diagnosis was confirmed with needle electromyography and nerve conduction examination. Within 2 weeks, the patient was fully recovered. The purpose of presenting this case is to remind clinicians that <b>tick</b> <b>paralysis</b> should be considered even in cases with atypical neurological findings admitted to the emergency department...|$|R
25|$|Spring is {{the peak}} season for <b>tick</b> <b>paralysis</b> {{because this is}} when the ticks molt and develop into the final adult stage of their life cycle (it is the adult stage that also {{produces}} the most toxins during feeding). Sporadic cases of <b>tick</b> <b>paralysis,</b> however, can occur all year, even in mid-winter.|$|R
25|$|Most mammals such as calves, sheep, goats, foals, pigs, cats, cavies, rats, {{mice and}} humans can be infested by the Australian <b>Paralysis</b> <b>Tick.</b> Fatalities {{resulting}} from a single engorged adult female tick are mostly reported in the young animals of the larger species and all ages and sizes of the pet species (dogs and cats). Larvae and nymphs can also produce toxic reactions in the host. Fifty larvae or five nymphs can kill a 40g rat, larger numbers of either can induce paralysis in dogs and cats. They can be quite easy to find on short-haired animals, but very difficult to find on long-haired animals like Persian cats. If {{you live in a}} tick-prone area, and your pets are allowed outdoors, it is suggested that you physically check your pets daily for ticks. Unfortunately they are often not discovered until the tick is large enough to be felt. By this time the tick has subjected the animal to a large amount of toxins. One adult female can kill four susceptible rats during engorgement. Although it is not typical, an engorging adult female apparently can re-attach several times to different dogs.|$|E
