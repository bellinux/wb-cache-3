40|$|Title: Supplier Relationship Manager By: Andy Mols Promoters: Professor Joaquim Filipe			Corporate {{promoter}} Vitor Pedrosa					Corporate promoter Servaas Tilkin					School promoter The {{application is}} designed to improve the relations between INSTICC and their supplier. Until now nothing in this process was done automatically so this had to change. The application is mainly focussed on managing orders and payments. The {{first part of the}} program is the orders. Here the order manager can see an overview of all the orders and their state. The user can add new orders or edit them here as well. There are two different types of orders. There are singular orders and contracts. Singular orders are simple orders that do not recur. Contracts are a bit more complex. It is possible to have a contract with the water company, for example. In this example It is known they have to be paid every month but not the exact amount. The user can select a default amount, the length of the contract and the time between payments. The program will then automatically make all the payment commitments for the time of the contract (in this example every month {{until the end of the}} contract). The contract can also be with a hotel. In this case the user has to enter all the payment commitments himself because this cannot be done automatically. The second part is the payments. Here you get an overview of all the payment commitments and when they have to be paid. Here you can add or edit a payment of a commitment. A notification system is implemented in the project as well. When an order or a payment commitment is made, the <b>payment</b> <b>manager</b> gets an email informing him/her there is something that has to be paid. It is also possible to add custom notifications. The program has to be able to store four types of documents on a server, namely an invoice, a proof of payment from the bank, a receipt from the supplier and a general proof from the entire order (if necessary). These files are transferred to the server with a WCF service. The program also has to check the privileges of the user to see what rights he has within the program. It is possible that a user is allowed to edit but not delete an order. Every action is logged and can be viewed by an admin. The admin can also change a user 2 ̆ 7 s privileges, view all documents and change the settings for the notifications...|$|E

50|$|Equity swaps {{have many}} applications. For example, a {{portfolio}} manager with XYZ Fund can swap the fund's returns for the returns of the S&P 500 (capital gains, dividends and income distributions.) They most often occur when a {{manager of a}} fixed income portfolio wants the portfolio to have exposure to the equity markets either as a hedge or a position. The portfolio manager would enter into a swap {{in which he would}} receive the return of the S&P 500 and pay the counterparty a fixed rate generated from his portfolio. The <b>payment</b> the <b>manager</b> receives will be equal to the amount he is receiving in fixed-income <b>payments,</b> so the <b>manager's</b> net exposure is solely to the S&P 500. These types of swaps are usually inexpensive and require little in terms of administration.|$|R

40|$|In {{the real}} world, where market {{imperfections}} such as taxes, agency costs, and information heterogeneity exist, the possibility arises that dividends {{may affect the}} value of the firm. As a result, dividend policy is an important topic faced by corporate financial managers and an important factor for investors to consider when forming their investment portfolios. This paper analyzes the factors underlying the dividend policies of lodging firms. In addition, it tests whether the market perceives changes in dividends as information about {{the value of the}} firm. In a world that is characterized by informational asymmetries between managers and investors, cash dividend payments may be used to convey information from corporate insiders to the company 2 ̆ 7 s shareholders. For example, dividend initiations and increases may convey management 2 ̆ 7 s confidence that the firm is profitable enough to fund its investment projects and to support the new dividend payment level. An alternative explanation is that dividend initiations and increases may reduce agency costs between managers and shareholders, resulting in an increase {{in the value of the}} firm. For example, as a result of cash dividend <b>payments,</b> <b>managers</b> will not invest in negative NPV projects. Therefore, the announcement of a dividend initiation or increase should be associated with a stock price increase...|$|R

40|$|Typically, {{shareholders}} are {{not sure}} whether boards act in their interest, or have been captured by management. They are also less well informed than boards about firm investment opportunities and operating conditions. We develop a model, consistent with these observations, in which discretionary compensation <b>payments</b> to <b>managers</b> might increase firm value or might simply enrich managers {{at the expense of}} shareholders. After observing the board’s compensation and investment policies, shareholders update the probability that the board is captured using Bayes rule. Shareholders are “outraged” if this updated probability is sufficiently large. Outrage is costly for the board. Shareholder democracy, by enabling outrage to constrain board actions, typically lowers firm value relative either to governance regimes that insulate boards from shareholder outrage, or regimes that ban discretionary compensation altogether...|$|R

In Australia this rise in professional sport has seen a number of taxation cases involving sportspersons reach the High Court. The outcome of these cases is that the revenue attained by Olympic athletes in the form of grant money, prizemoney and sponsorships is now considered to be taxable income, while <b>payments</b> to <b>managers</b> to obtain playing contracts and other income are deductible expenses.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} how influence {{activities in}} the form of signal jamming affect the capital budgeting process of corporate organizations in Australia. First, the relationship between investment in the smallest division and its past performances is tested. The relationship is defined as investment sensitivity. Second, how the investment sensitivity varies as influence problems become more severe is examined. Finally, the relationship between compensation incentives for the large division manager and the investment sensitivity is reviewed. The findings suggest that investment sensitivity is positive for Australian firms. Mixed evidence is obtained between investment sensitivity and increase in the severity of influence problems when measures such as, relatedness and number of divisions are used. With increase in number of divisions, influence activity becomes more severe and headquarters relies more on public signal. However, with the increase in relatedness across divisions, influence problem increases and headquarters relies more on private information from manager of the large division. Evidence suggest that Australian firms provide high short term incentive <b>payments</b> to <b>managers</b> of large divisions to mitigate the influence activity problems and thus rely more on managerial recommendations for investing in smallest division as compared to noisy accounting measures.

In the second part, I examine a dynamic investment model where firms invest in a risky asset but cannot hedge the risk of their investment because they lack the ability to commit to future repayments of debt. Once firms have access to exogenous supplies of risk free assets, they may on an aggregate level invest more in the risky asset, because risk free technology allows them to increase in wealth in equilibrium. This result helps to explain the asset price booms in emerging countries when they experience substantial capital outflow. i...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose is}} to develop a greater {{understanding}} of what is requested by customers with regards to e-commerce and mobile <b>payments</b> and how <b>managers</b> attitude can affect the technological adaption process. Furthermore, a suggested framework will be presented on how SMEs can adapt to these changes. Problem – The move towards the cashless society has changed the business environment and increased the demand for mobile payments and e-commerce. The transition to implement new technologies requires resources in terms of time, money and knowledge. Therefore, this process can be challenging for SMEs. Design-Methodology-Approach – Primary data is collected through case studies and secondary data from previous research conducted. Two SMEs within the retail business in Jönköping is investigated using semi-structured interviews. The combined data is analyzed together with previous literature within the field.

A positive correlation between managers’ attitude towards new technology and the implementation process is found. To adapt to these technological changes, it is important for SME managers to invest equally in knowledge and technology...|$|R
40|$|This paper investigates whether {{managers}} {{that have}} a propensity for personal tax aggressiveness are associated with tax avoidance at the firm level. Motivated by Dhaliwal, Erickson, and Heitzman (2009) and Hanlon and Heitzman (2009), I construct a measure of personally tax aggressive ("aggressive") managers and determine whether corporate tax avoidance activities increase in their presence. The results of my study indicate that aggressive managers are associated with firm-level tax avoidance. The neoclassical view would suggest that aggressive managers' tax expertise could benefit shareholders through lower tax <b>payments.</b> Since aggressive <b>managers</b> extract their personal tax savings from shareholders, non-tax agency costs potentially increase in their presence. This has implications for the association between aggressive managers and firm value. Using the framework established through the agency view of tax avoidance (Desai and Dharmapala, 2008) I find that on average the presence of aggressive managers is associated with increased firm value. However, consistent with recent research, governance is an important moderating factor whereby firm value {{in the presence of}} aggressive managers tends to increase only for relatively better-governed firms...|$|R
