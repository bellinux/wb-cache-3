5|$|Attendance was {{in decline}} across the league as the Great Depression took hold. The Habs posted a losing record in 1932–33, leading to still smaller crowds. Averaging only 2,000 fans per game, the team sold Morenz to the Chicago Black Hawks in 1934 as <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> cut costs.

5|$|Before departing Singapore, the Japanese ships, {{which were}} {{designated}} the Completion Force, were loaded with supplies {{of oil and}} other important raw materials. This formed <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> run increased quantities of supplies through the Allied blockade of Japan before the country was cut off from its empire. The Allies had learned of the Completion Force's composition and goals through intelligence gained from decrypting Japanese radio signals, and plans were developed for coordinated attacks on it by submarines and United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) aircraft. As part of these preparations, 26 submarines were eventually positioned along the ships' expected route.|$|E

5|$|Fishers, {{medium-sized}} weasels, were reintroduced to Pine Creek Gorge as <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> {{establish a}} healthy population of fishers in Pennsylvania. Prior to the lumber era, fishers were numerous throughout {{the forests of}} Pennsylvania. They are generalized predators and will hunt any smaller creatures in their territory, including porcupines. Elk have been reintroduced west of the gorge in Clinton County and occasionally wander near the west rim of the canyon. Coyotes have come back on their own. Invasive insect species in the gorge include gypsy moth larvae, which eat all the leaves off trees, especially oaks, and hemlock woolly adelgids, which weaken and kill hemlocks. Invasive plant species include purple loosestrife and Japanese knotweed.|$|E
5|$|Offensive {{additions}} included halfback Ara Parseghian {{and quarterback}} George Terlep, {{but the most}} significant signing {{of the year was}} Dub Jones. Brown got Jones – who had a long and successful career in Cleveland – in a trade with the Brooklyn Dodgers for the rights to draft Bob Chappuis. Author Andy Piasick describes this trade {{as one of the most}} astute in Browns history. The Browns also signed quarterback Y. A. Tittle from Louisiana State University, but were forced to send him to the Baltimore Colts as <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> balance talent among the AAFC's teams during the league's third year of play.|$|E

5|$|The {{entry of}} a new {{ownership}} group of the Brooklyn Dodgers in the offseason that included Branch Rickey affected the Browns' schedule in 1948. Rickey, an executive for baseball's Brooklyn Dodgers, convinced Brown to schedule a late-season road trip during which Cleveland would play three teams in eight days: the New York Yankees, the Los Angeles Dons and the San Francisco 49ers. The plan was <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> bring {{more attention to the}} AAFC and help attendance by sending its most successful team on a cross-country road trip, a strategy that had worked in baseball.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the {{influence}} of Islam in the region, Tajik was written in the Persian alphabet up to the 1920s. Until this time, the language was not thought of as separate and simply considered a dialect of the Persian language. The Soviets began by simplifying the Persian alphabet in 1923, before moving to a Latin-based system in 1927. The Latin script was introduced by the Soviet Union as <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> increase literacy and distance the, at that time, largely illiterate population, from the Islamic Central Asia. There were also practical considerations. The regular Persian alphabet, being an abjad, does not provide sufficient letters for representing the vowel system of Tajik. In addition, the abjad is more difficult to learn, each letter having different forms depending on the position in the word.|$|E
5|$|Following {{months of}} Euromaidan street protests that began {{because of his}} refusal to sign an Association Agreement with the European Union in favor of deals from Russia, President Yanukovych fled Kiev in February 2014, {{ultimately}} to Russia, and parliament voted to remove him from his post. This brought another change in direction of Ukraine's association with Europe and by extension NATO. In 2014, pro-Russian unrest occurred in eastern Ukraine and Crimea was annexed by the Russian Federation in March. As <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> assuage concerned groups, newly installed Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk addressed the topic in a Russian language speech on 18 March 2014, emphasizing that Ukraine was not seeking NATO membership. US President Barack Obama echoed this position the following week, while calling for greater NATO presence in Eastern Europe.|$|E

Crews was succeeded by Chris Harrison, host of The Bachelor and its spin-offs, when season 14 premiered on September 14, 2015.|$|E
5|$|The fleet {{remained}} in captivity during the negotiations that ultimately produced the Treaty of Versailles. Reuter {{believed that the}} British intended to seize the German ships on 21 June 1919, which was the deadline for Germany to have signed the peace treaty. Unaware that the deadline had been extended to the 23rd, Reuter ordered the ships to be sunk at the next opportunity. On the morning of 21 June, the British fleet left Scapa Flow to conduct training maneuvers, and at 11:20 Reuter transmitted the order to his ships. Brummer sank at 13:05; she was never raised for scrapping and remains {{on the bottom of}} Scapa Flow. In 2017, marine archaeologists from the Orkney Research Center for Archaeology conducted extensive surveys of Brummer and nine other wrecks in the area, including six other German and three British warships. The archaeologists mapped the wrecks with sonar and examined them with remotely operated underwater vehicles as <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> determine how the wrecks are deteriorating.|$|E
