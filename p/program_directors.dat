500|$|Originally {{intended}} for an October 1989 release date, Fear of a Black Planet {{was released on}} April 10, 1990 by Def Jam Recordings and Columbia Records. Although It Takes a Nation garnered Public Enemy more exposure with black audiences and music journalists, urban radio outlets had mostly rejected Def Jam's requests to include the group's singles in their regular rotation. This incited Def Jam co-founder Russell Simmons to attempt grassroots promotional tactics from his earlier years of promoting hip hop shows. In promoting Fear of a Black Planet, he recruited young street crews to put up posters, billboards, and stickers on public surfaces, while Simmons himself met with nightclub DJs and college radio <b>program</b> <b>directors</b> to persuade them to add albums tracks such as [...] "Fight the Power", [...] "911 is a Joke", and [...] "Welcome to the Terrordome" [...] to their playlists.|$|E

500|$|The group {{sent out}} demo tapes to record {{companies}} but received few responses until executives at GRT Records signed the band to a one-record contract, issuing their debut single, [...] "I Want to Be with You Tonight", in 1977. GRT {{was more interested}} in the band as songwriters, and convinced the group to change their name to the Alabama Band, later shortened to Alabama. The song only reached number 78 on the Billboard Hot Country Songs charts, and GRT declared bankruptcy the following year. Due to a hidden clause in their contract, Alabama was forbidden from recording with another label. For the next two years, the band raised money to buy out their contract and they began recording again in 1979. Following self-recorded efforts Wildcountry (1976) and Deuces Wild (1977), Alabama Band No. 3 became the band's third album, and the band performed over 300 shows on the road that year. The group hired independent radio promoters to receive radio play for the single [...] "I Wanna Come Over", and they sent hand-written letters to <b>program</b> <b>directors</b> and DJs nationwide. It received the attention of Dallas-based MDJ Records, who signed the band. Scott left the group at this time, and was replaced by Mark Herndon, a rock drummer later credited with bringing the band their signature sound.

500|$|Controversy {{was first}} {{reported}} by Australian music site Undercover.com.au on December 5, 2008, {{after the release}} of the album.

When I asked them what it was, they told me it was Britney Spears. I was horrified. I got them the Circus album but there was no warning on it... It is extremely offensive. I feel deceived." [...] Rolling Stone writer Daniel Kreps defended Spears, arguing that parents should have been aware of the singer's musical themes. After the song was announced as the third single from the album, American radio stations were unsure about playing the track due to its double entendre in the chorus. <b>Program</b> <b>directors</b> of Z100 and KIIS-FM compared the issues to be faced by their radio stations to the release of the 2005 The Black Eyed Peas single, [...] "Don't Phunk with My Heart", saying that [...] "listeners thought it was the other word, and so we had to change it to 'mess'". Program director Patti Marshall of Q102 said [...] "It's ok to put in on an album, have fun with it, but we're publicly owned, you know? [...] It's not about us. It's about the mom in the minivan with her 8-year-old." [...] WFLZ's Tommy Chuck said his station produced their own edit of the song that replaced [...] "seek" [...] with [...] "see", with the station's disc jockeys referring to it as [...] "If U See Amy".|$|E

[...] Rolling Stone music reviewer Barry Walters commented the following about the song, [...] "Rather than try to forget about singer Natalie Maines' anti-Bush remarks of 2003 -- which landed them in hot water {{with a lot of}} station <b>program</b> <b>directors</b> -- the threesome declares it's still 'Not Ready to Make Nice'." [...] USA Today music reviewer Brian Mansfield commented the following about the song, [...] "They're 'Not Ready to Make Nice' with the yahoos who threatened their lives over an offhanded comment. So give the Chicks credit for sticking to their guns, and give them more for getting on with life.
