For example, individuals will often spontaneously physically rotate when faced with rotated objects, such as an array of words, putatively to offload the costs associated with stimulus rotation. We examined this idea further by independently manipulating the costs associated with both word rotation and array frame rotation. Surprisingly, we found that individuals’ patterns of spontaneous <b>physical</b> <b>rotations</b> did not follow patterns of rotation costs or benefits associated with being physically rotated, findings difficult to reconcile with existing theories of strategy selection involving external resources.

40|$|Abstract. <b>Physical</b> <b>rotations</b> and {{translations}} are {{the basic}} constituents of navi-gation behavior, yet there is mixed evidence about their relative importance for complex navigation in virtual reality (VR). In the present experiment, 24 par-ticipants wore head-mounted displays and performed navigational search tasks with rotations/translations controlled by physical motion or joystick. As expected, physical walking showed performance benefits over joystick navigation. Control-ling translations via joystick and <b>rotations</b> via <b>physical</b> <b>rotations</b> led to better per-formance than joystick navigation, and yielded almost comparable performance to actual walking in terms of search efficiency and time. Walking resulted, how-ever, in increased viewpoint changes and shorter navigation paths, suggesting a rotation/translation tradeoff and different navigation strategies. While previ-ous studies have {{emphasized the importance of}} full physical motion via walking (Ruddle & Lessels, 2006, 2009), our data suggests that considerable navigation improvements can already be gained by allowing for full-body rotations, with-out the considerable cost, space, tracking, and safety requirements of free-space walking setups. ...|$|R

We evaluate the anyons by always fusing the control group (the bottom anyons) together first, so exchanging which anyons these are will rotate the system.

40|$|Abstract Robust and {{effortless}} {{spatial orientation}} critically relies on ‘‘automatic and obligatory spatial updating’’, a largely automatized and reflex-like process that transforms our mental egocentric repre-sentation {{of the immediate}} surroundings during ego-motions. A rapid pointing paradigm {{was used to assess}} automatic/obligatory spatial updating after visually displayed upright rotations with or without concomitant <b>physical</b> <b>rotations</b> using a motion plat-form. Visual stimuli displaying a natural, subject-known scene proved sufficient for enabling automatic and obligatory spatial updating, irrespective of con-current physical motions. This challenges the prevail-ing notion that visual cues alone are insufficient for enabling such spatial updating of rotations, and that vestibular/proprioceptive cues are both required and sufficient. Displaying optic flow devoid of landmarks during the motion and pointing phase was insufficient for enabling automatic spatial updating, but could not be entirely ignored either. Interestingly, additional physical motion cues hardly improved performance, and were insufficient for affording automatic spatial updating. The results are discussed {{in the context of the}} mental transformation hypothesis and the sensorimo-tor interference hypothesis, which associates difficul-ties in imagined perspective switches to interference between the sensorimotor and cognitive (to-be-imag-ined) perspective...|$|R

(This complication {{is one of the}} most difficult aspects of Listing's law to understand, but it follows directly from the non-commutative laws of <b>physical</b> <b>rotation,</b> which specify that one rotation followed by a second rotation does not yield the same result as these same rotations performed in the inverse order.) ...|$|E

Many of them do not sense the position of the Sun.

Sometimes, a digital representation of this rotation is generated, rather than <b>physical</b> <b>rotation</b> of a component. The equation of time is then added to this constant rotation, producing a rotation of the tracker that keeps pace with the apparent motion of the Sun.

50|$|In {{hyperthermia}} application, the nanoparticles form a ferrofluid in the blood. They {{move and}} rotate randomly in the fluid, exhibiting Brownian motion. When {{a magnetic field}} is applied to them, magnetic nanoparticles rotate and align with the magnetic field. The magnetization of nanoparticles can spontaneously change their orientation {{under the influence of}} thermal energy, a phenomenon called superparamagnetism. The magnetization of the nanoparticle is also reversed when an applied magnetic field is large enough to suppress the energy barrier between the two equilibrium positions, a phenomenon which is known as the Stoner-Wohlfarth model of magnetization reversal. In the most general case, the reversal of the magnetization is due to a combination of the three mechanisms described above. For instance, for a single domain nanoparticle that is inside a fluid at room temperature and a sweeping magnetic field is suddenly applied in a direction opposite to the one of the nanoparticle magnetization. At the same time, i) the nanoparticle will rotate in the fluid, ii) the barrier between the two equilibrium positions of the magnetization will decrease, iii) when the energy barrier becomes of the order of the thermal energy, the magnetization will switch (if the nanoparticle is not already aligned with the magnetic field due to its <b>physical</b> <b>rotation).</b>|$|E

Accordingly, the vividness of imagined rotations was reduced on incongruent relative to congruent trials. Notably, we found that similar effects of imagery were found at the earliest stages of vestibular processing, namely, the onset of the vestibular–ocular reflex was modulated by the congruency between physical and imagined rotations. Together, the results demonstrate that mental imagery influences self-motion perception by exerting top-down influences over the earliest vestibular response and subsequent perceptual decision-making...|$|E
30|$|Certain {{management}} practices help to maintain {{both economic and}} environmental sustainability in planted forests used for timber production. The rotation period is especially important in silvicultural management, as it determines logging intervals, and can dramatically affect stand conditions (Bettinger et al. 2009). For example, changes in the rotation period can alter the age distribution in a stand, potentially skewing it towards a population of younger trees. Previous studies have defined rotation periods in various terms, such as physical, technical and financial parameters, depending on the forest management objective (Bettinger et al. 2009; Hiley 1967). Numerous studies have also shown that the <b>physical</b> <b>rotation</b> age, {{which is based on}} the life span of a tree, varies greatly between species.

30|$|There are, in general, two “rotation” {{aspects to}} cluster rotation.

The second aspect of rotation is the periodic rotation through a set of cluster patterns, in a round-robin fashion. This latter aspect is more general to any arbitrary cell layout.

In particular, for typical galactic parameters all rotation curves of the Weyl-Dirac model present Keplerian fall-off. As a consequence, we conclude that a more thorough analysis of the problem requires the determination of the gauge function β on galactic scales, as well as restrictions on the test-particle behavior under the action of the additional fields introduced by this theory.
