25|$|In Europe and elsewhere, railway {{networks}} are {{considered part of}} the national transport infrastructure, just like roads, highways and waterways, so are often financed by the state. Operators of the rolling stock <b>pay</b> <b>fees</b> according to rail use. This makes possible the large investments required for the technically and, in the long-term, also economically advantageous electrification. Because railroad infrastructure is privately owned in the U.S., railroads are unwilling to make the necessary investments for electrification.|$|E

25|$|Abstraction fees. ONEE and the Régies have to <b>pay</b> <b>fees</b> (redevances) {{for water}} {{abstraction}} and wastewater discharge to the basin agencies. These fees were introduced {{on the basis}} of the Water Law of 1995. Their level is low, not allowing the basin agencies to cover its own administrative costs, not to speak of contributing to the financing of investments by service providers as foreseen by the law. Since their introduction the level of the fees has not been adjusted, so that in inflation-adjusted terms the value of the already low fee has been further eroded.|$|E
25|$|Academies were {{initially}} supplementary but eventually superseded the old grammar schools, {{as had occurred}} in Montrose. The foundation of Montrose Academy came 55 years after that {{of the very first}} academy in Perth in 1760. The pupils were required to <b>pay</b> <b>fees,</b> which funded teachers' salaries. Sometimes, {{as in the case of}} James Mill, poor boys were sponsored by local ministers or benevolent landowners. In the mid-nineteenth century, a bequest left by John Erskine of Saint James Parish, Jamaica to the sum of £3000, provided education for eight orphaned boys.|$|E
25|$|McNabb died in 1802 but it {{took another}} sixteen years before the school opened it doors after much debate about {{how to use the}} bequest. It was in 1815 that the Rev.

Full fees would be charged to ‘non-residenters’, while parish pupils would <b>pay</b> <b>fees</b> on a sliding scale, with some receiving free education.

25|$|Taipei City is also {{famous for}} its effort in garbage recycling, which {{has become such a}} good {{international}} precedent that other countries have sent teams to study the recycling system. After the Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) established a program in 1998 combining the efforts of communities, a financial resource named the Recycling Fund was made available to recycling companies and waste collectors. Manufacturers, vendors and importers of recyclable waste <b>pay</b> <b>fees</b> to the Fund, which uses the money to set firm prices for recyclables and subsidize local recycling efforts. Between 1998 and 2008, the recycling rate increased from 6 percent to 32 percent. This improvement enabled the government of Taipei to demonstrate its recycling system to the world at the Shanghai World Expo 2010.|$|E
25|$|Public {{education}} in St. Louis began in 1838, {{when the city}} Board of Aldermen voted to levy a common lands income tax to support two elementary schools, known as North and South schools. A third school opened in 1841, called Benton School, offering instruction in basic writing, reading, and mathematics. Initially the schools required students to <b>pay</b> <b>fees,</b> but by 1847 tax levies allowed for free public education and expansion of the system. By 1854, the system had 27 schools and served nearly 4,000 students, in 1855 a high school was opened with considerable fanfare, and by 1860, nearly 12,000 students had enrolled in the St. Louis Public Schools. The district also opened a normal school in 1857, which later became Harris-Stowe State University.|$|E
25|$|Little {{is known}} about the pattern of land {{ownership}} before the Roman conquest, but {{there is no doubt that}} it radically changed after the Roman conquest. In particular, many free peasants who had farmed the same plots for generations (i.e. were owners under tribal customary law) would have found themselves reduced to tenants, obliged to pay rent to absentee Roman landlords or to the agents of the procurator, the chief financial officer of the province, if their land was now part of an imperial estate. Even where their new landlord was a local tribal aristocrat, the free peasant may have been worse off, obliged to pay rent for land which he might previously have farmed for free, or <b>pay</b> <b>fees</b> to graze his herds on pastures which might previously have been communal.|$|E

25|$|The band {{maintained}} a 120-piece block into the 1970s, when director Paul Droste expanded the band first to 160, {{and then to}} 192 members by adding another row of Sousaphones, creating a full row of snare drums, and adding tenor duo-toms to the row of bass drums and cymbals. Women were admitted into the band starting in 1973, {{after the passage of}} the 1972 Title IX legislation. Today, approximately 20–25% of the band's members are women each year. By the mid-1970s, a limitation on the maximum number of years one could be in the Marching Band was imposed. Prior to this, there were people who had spent nearly a decade playing and marching with the band. Some of these band members were gainfully employed graduates of the university, who would continue to <b>pay</b> <b>fees</b> to try out for band. A decision was reached to limit the band to 5 years, 6 under extenuating circumstances and director approval. This allowed for more new students to try out and make the band, and also allowed for a better spirit of competition for the 225 total spots in the band.|$|E
25|$|A {{court and}} the judges may not impose a fine and place a {{defendant}} on probation if the offense is punishable by fine or imprisonment. However, probation as to one count can be conditioned on payment of fine imposed under another count. If a defendant is unable to <b>pay</b> <b>fees,</b> revocation of probation for nonpayment is considered unconstitutional. But an income tax evasion defendant ordered {{to cooperate with the}} Collector of Internal Revenue in determining the amount of tax due and pay that amount could be subjected to revocation of probation if he failed to, in good faith, pay what he could on taxes, but instead concealed and fraudulently transferred assets. In a case in which a defendant was ordered to pay $1,500 in back taxes within 24 hours of sentencing, the appellate court ruled that this was acceptable since the defendant had plenty of time between conviction and sentencing in which {{to take care of his}} tax debt. In the United States, it has been ruled that probationers have no First Amendment right to avoid federal income taxes on religious grounds. Probationers are required to obey the law; tax resistance is illegal; therefore, by syllogism, probationers cannot engage in tax resistance.|$|E
25|$|Hobbs {{was educated}} at a primary school {{affiliated}} with his local Anglican church, St Matthew's. In 1891, {{he moved to}} York Street Boys' School, where in contrast to his previous school, his family had to <b>pay</b> <b>fees</b> for him to attend. He later wrote {{that he was a}} poor scholar but was more successful at sports. Both he and his mother later recounted that he was rarely in trouble at home or school, except when carrying out practical jokes. He was also heavily involved in St Matthew's Church, and {{was a member of the}} church choir. Although his first appearance in a cricket match was as a last minute substitute playing for Jesus College choir, he played regularly for the St Matthew's choir team, which he went on to captain, and the York Street school team. He was also a founder member of a team called the Ivy Club which played on Parker's Piece. During holidays, he helped his father at work on the Jesus College ground. In his final year at York Street, in order to supplement the family budget, he took a job working before school hours in the domestic service of a private house where his duties mainly involved cleaning. When he left school in 1895, Hobbs initially worked as an errand boy before his father's connections at the university helped him to get a summer job as a college servant, chiefly assisting the cricket team. Then, aged 16, he began a potentially more permanent career working as an apprentice gas fitter.|$|E
