5|$|Other strong quakes {{occurred}} on January 26, 1700 (estimated at 9magnitude), December 14, 1872 (7.3 or 7.4), April 13, 1949 (7.1), and April 29, 1965 (6.5). The 1965 quake caused three deaths in Seattle directly {{and one more}} by heart failure. Although the Seattle Fault passes {{just south of the}} city center, neither it nor the Cascadia subduction zone has caused an earthquake since the city's founding. The Cascadia subduction zone <b>poses</b> <b>the</b> threat of an earthquake of magnitude 9.0 or greater, capable of seriously damaging the city and collapsing many buildings, especially in zones built on fill.|$|E

If the correlation coefficient was 0.93 or below and the match rate was 0.640616 or below, <b>the</b> <b>pose</b> was estimated after searching the child nodes {{on the left}} side. In contrast, the right child nodes were searched when the match rate was greater than 0.640616.|$|R
5|$|Predation in {{the wild}} appears to be very rare for ruffed lemurs, {{probably}} because living in the high canopy makes them challenging to catch. Evidence of predation by raptors, such as the Henst's goshawk (Accipiter henstii) suggests it occurs at a low rate. The fossa (Cryptoprocta ferox) could present a potential risk if it found an individual lower in the forest canopy, but no confirmation has been presented to indicate that they prey upon ruffed lemurs. Instead, only re-introduced, captive-bred ruffed lemurs {{have been killed by}} fossa, likely due to their inexperience with predators. Nesting behavior <b>poses</b> <b>the</b> biggest risk of predation, making them susceptible to carnivorous mammals, such as the ring-tailed mongoose (Galidia elegans) and brown-tailed mongoose (Salanoia concolor).|$|E
5|$|Ulysses appears {{larger than}} his fellow sailors, while the Sirens hold out their arms in {{traditional}} dramatic <b>poses.</b> <b>The</b> three Sirens {{are very similar}} in appearance, and Etty's biographer Leonard Robinson believes it likely that Etty painted the same model in three different poses. Robinson considers their classical poses {{to be the result}} of Etty's lifelong attendance at the Academy's Life Classes, where models were always in traditional poses, while former curator of York Art Gallery Richard Green considers their pose a tribute to the Nereids in Rubens's The Disembarkation at Marseilles, a work Etty is known to have admired and of which he made a copy in 1823.|$|E

25|$|By the 1970s, {{feminine}} traces in some {{versions of}} the name and more often in the epithets led to various theories. Among them, that Nefertiti was masquerading as Smenkhkare before changing her name again to Neferneferuaten. When considered with various stela depicting Akhenaten with another king in familiar, if not intimate <b>poses,</b> <b>the</b> theory that Akhenaten and Smenkhkare were homosexual arose.|$|E
25|$|The neutron {{radiation}} serves to transmute the surrounding matter, often rendering it radioactive. When {{added to the}} dust of radioactive material released by the bomb itself, {{a large amount of}} radioactive material is released into the environment. This form of radioactive contamination is known as nuclear fallout and <b>poses</b> <b>the</b> primary risk of exposure to ionizing radiation for a large nuclear weapon.|$|E

25|$|According to one {{influential}} school, {{the human}} vocal apparatus is intrinsically digital {{on the model}} of a keyboard or digital computer. If so, this is remarkable: nothing about a chimpanzee's vocal apparatus suggests a digital keyboard, notwithstanding the anatomical and physiological similarities. This <b>poses</b> <b>the</b> question as to when and how, during and the course of human evolution, the transition from analog to digital structure and function occurred.|$|E
25|$|An {{object in}} motion that {{moves out of}} its natural arc for no {{apparent}} reason will appear erratic rather than fluid. For example, when animating a pointing finger, the animator should be certain that in all drawings in between the two extreme <b>poses,</b> <b>the</b> fingertip follows a logical arc from one extreme to the next. Traditional animators tend to draw the arc in lightly on the paper for reference, to be erased later.|$|E
25|$|Huntington's {{disease is}} a hyperkinetic {{movement}} basal ganglia disease caused by lack of normal inhibitory inputs from medium spiny neurons of the basal ganglia. This <b>poses</b> <b>the</b> opposite effects of those associated with Parkinson's disease, including inappropriate activation of upper motor neurons. As with the GABAergic mechanisms observed in relation to Parkinson's disease, a GABA agonist injected into the substantia nigra pars reticulata decreases inhibition of upper motor neurons, resulting in ballistic involuntary motor movements, similar to symptoms of Huntington's disease.|$|E

25|$|Self-XSS {{is a form}} of XSS {{vulnerability}} which {{relies on}} Social Engineering in order to trick the victim into executing malicious JavaScript code into their browser. Although it is technically not a true XSS vulnerability due to the fact it relies on socially engineering a user into executing code rather than a flaw in the affected website allowing an attacker to do so, it still <b>poses</b> <b>the</b> same risks as a regular XSS vulnerability if properly executed.|$|E
25|$|The {{breeding}} {{history of}} Pit Bulls {{makes it impossible}} to rule out a violent propensity for any one dog as gameness and aggressiveness can be hidden for years. Given the Pit Bull's genetical physical strengths and abilities, a Pit Bull always <b>poses</b> <b>the</b> possibility of danger; given the Pit Bull's breeding history as a fighting dog and the latency of its aggressiveness and gameness, the Pit Bull poses a danger distinct from other breeds of dogs which do not so uniformly share those traits.|$|E
25|$|When not {{properly}} implemented, continuous auditing {{can result in}} hundreds—even thousands—of false positives and wasted effort. Many companies that have experienced success with continuous auditing recommend that you start small. Select which area of the company <b>poses</b> <b>the</b> greatest risk and where its transactions and control systems are most important to the company for your initial foray into continuous auditing. Automate {{a small number of}} key initial tests, such as comparing your accounts payable vendor master file with the employee address file, to uncover potential policy violations or fraud. Moving forward, increase the tests and gradually expand into other business processes in stages.|$|E

25|$|A {{primary concern}} of the bite of a spider {{is the effect of}} its venom. A spider {{envenomation}} occurs whenever a spider injects venom into the skin. Not all spider bites involve injection of venom, and the amount of venom injected can vary based on the type of spider and the circumstances of the encounter. The mechanical injury from a spider bite is not a serious concern for humans. However, it is generally the toxicity of spider venom that <b>poses</b> <b>the</b> most risk to human beings; several spiders are known to have venom that can cause injury to humans in the amounts that a spider could inject when biting.|$|E
25|$|The {{topic of}} animal {{consciousness}} is beset {{with a number}} of difficulties. It <b>poses</b> <b>the</b> problem of other minds in an especially severe form because animals, lacking the ability to use human language, cannot tell us about their experiences. Also, it is difficult to reason objectively about the question, because a denial that an animal is conscious is often taken to imply that it does not feel, its life has no value, and that harming it is not morally wrong. The 17th-century French philosopher René Descartes, for example, has sometimes been blamed for mistreatment of animals because he argued that only humans are conscious.|$|E
25|$|If Not Now, When ? is {{an album}} that expresses sincere love, peace, and happiness. Each song taps {{into its own}} theme that speaks on love and “hailing halleluiah every day.” The songs speak on life and the process and journey to {{discovering}} happiness. Although much of the album takes on a very peaceful tone, Incubus also incorporates a political perspective in their song Thieves. The song thieves speak on “the paragon of civilization.” In this song, he <b>poses</b> <b>the</b> question “why should the thieves have all the fun, selling water by the river?” He references to “god fearing white Americans” and insinuates that in America, that privilege is the ticket to happiness.|$|E
