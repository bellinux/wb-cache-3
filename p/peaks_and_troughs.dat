5|$|The {{explanation}} of this instability {{begins with the}} existence of tiny perturbations in the stream. These are always present, no matter how smooth the stream is. If the perturbations are resolved into sinusoidal components, we find that some components grow with time while others decay with time. Among those that grow with time, some grow at faster rates than others. Whether a component decays or grows, and how fast it grows is entirely a function of its wave number (a measure of how many <b>peaks</b> <b>and</b> <b>troughs</b> per centimeter) and the radii of the original cylindrical stream.|$|E
5|$|An early {{application}} of these new theoretical tools was in phonographic sound reproduction. A recurring problem with early phonograph designs was that mechanical resonances in the pickup and sound transmission mechanism caused excessively large <b>peaks</b> <b>and</b> <b>troughs</b> in the frequency response, resulting in poor sound quality. In 1923, Harrison of the Western Electric Company filed a patent for a phonograph in which the mechanical design was entirely represented as an electrical circuit. The horn of the phonograph is represented as a transmission line, and is a resistive load {{for the rest of}} the circuit, while all the mechanical and acoustic parts—from the pickup needle through to the horn—are translated into lumped components according to the impedance analogy. The circuit arrived at is a ladder topology of series resonant circuits coupled by shunt capacitors. This can be viewed as a bandpass filter circuit. Harrison designed the component values of this filter to have a specific passband corresponding to the desired audio passband (in this case 100Hz to 6kHz) and a flat response. Translating these electrical element values back into mechanical quantities provided specifications for the mechanical components in terms of mass and stiffness, which in turn could be translated into physical dimensions for their manufacture. The resulting phonograph has a flat frequency response in its passband and is free of the resonances previously experienced. Shortly after this, Harrison filed another patent using the same methodology on telephone transmit and receive transducers.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Vitamin K antagonists (VKA) are {{historically}} used {{to treat}} thrombosis but newer direct acting oral anticoagulants (DOAC) have been released. DOACs influence laboratory methods that monitor haemostasis, leading to false positives and prolonged clotting results. Trough DOAC concentrations may have less influence at than at peak, but this is unknown. There is speculation that obesity also affects DOAC efficiency. This study sought to validate the effects of two common DOACs, rivaroxaban and apixaban, on 12 laboratory assays at <b>peak</b> <b>and</b> <b>trough</b> concentrations, {{as well as the}} influence of obesity on the drugs and assays. Methods: Rivaroxaban (n= 20) and apixaban (n= 21) patients had samples collected immediately before their next dose, and 3 hours after to provide <b>peak</b> <b>and</b> <b>trough.</b> Healthy controls (n= 20) provided a sample at one-time point. Relevant medical histories and demographics, including BMI, were collected after obtaining informed consent. Samples underwent coagulation and thrombophilia panels as well as thrombin antithrombin complex, prothrombin fragments 1 + 2, and thrombin generation assays (TGA). Statistical analysis was performed between <b>peak</b> <b>and</b> controls, <b>peak</b> <b>and</b> <b>trough,</b> <b>and</b> all BMI groups. Results: Significant prolongations were found with the prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), TGA, and false positives for the dilute Russell viper venom time (DRVVT) by both rivaroxaban and apixaban. Apixaban was less potent than rivaroxaban with significant differences only between <b>peak</b> <b>and</b> <b>trough</b> for PT, <b>and</b> APTT. Only two results were influenced by weight; the APTT with rivaroxaban and free protein S for the controls. Conclusion: Rivaroxaban and apixaban are similar drugs but impact the assays differently due to dosage, half-life, and rate activity. Both influence assays more at peak than trough, but trough is still notably influenced compared to the controls.

METHODS: The ex vivo human placental model used C 14 antipyrine to determine the transport fraction and clearance index of these compounds at both the <b>peak</b> <b>and</b> <b>trough</b> serum concentrations. The clearance index accumulation and tissue concentrations were determined for each drug by high pressure liquid chromatography. RESULTS: The clearance index of abacavir was 0. 47 +/- 0. 19 and 0. 50 +/- 0. 07 at <b>peak</b> <b>and</b> <b>trough</b> concentrations, respectively.
