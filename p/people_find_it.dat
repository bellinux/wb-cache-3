5|$|Many {{contests}} between {{animals are}} now regarded as sports for example, horse racing {{is regarded as}} both a sport and {{an important source of}} entertainment. Its economic impact means that it is also considered a global industry, one in which horses are carefully transported around the world to compete in races. In Australia, the horse race run on Melbourne Cup Day is a public holiday and the public regards the race as an important annual event. Like horse racing, camel racing requires human riders, while greyhound racing does not. <b>People</b> <b>find</b> <b>it</b> entertaining to watch animals race competitively, whether they are trained, like horses, camels or dogs, or untrained, like cockroaches.|$|E

RoboMary is an intelligent robot who, instead of the ordinary color camera-eyes, has a software lock such that she is only able to perceive black and white and shades in-between.|$|E

500|$|Several critics {{found the}} lack of an {{anthropomorphic}} point of view hurt the book's relevance. Robert Braile in The Boston Globe wrote that it has [...] "no real context ... no rationale for probing this fantasy other than [...] unsubstantiated premise that <b>people</b> <b>find</b> <b>it</b> fascinating". Michael Grunwald in The Washington Post also questioned the premise: [...] "Imagining the human footprint on a post-human planet might be fun for dormitory potheads who have already settled the questions of God's existence and Fergie's hotness, but it's not clear why the rest of us need this level of documentary evidence". On the other hand, Alanna Mitchell in the Globe and Mail review found relevance in the context of society's passiveness to resource depletion combined with an anthropomorphic vanity. She writes the [...] "book [...] designed to help us find the how of survival by shaking us out of our passive dance with death".|$|E
500|$|Surfer Rosas cover artwork {{features}} {{a photograph of}} a topless [...] "friend of a friend" [...] of the band, posing as a flamenco dancer, pitched against a wall which displays a crucifix and a torn poster. Simon Larbalestier, who contributed pictures to all Pixies album sleeves, decided to build the set because [...] "we couldn't find the atmosphere we wanted naturally." [...] According to Larbalestier, Black Francis {{came up with the idea}} for the cover as he wrote songs in his father's [...] "topless Spanish bar"; Larbalestier added the crucifix and torn poster, and they [...] "sort of loaded that with all the Catholicism." [...] Commenting on the cover in 2005, Francis said, [...] "I just hope <b>people</b> <b>find</b> <b>it</b> tasteful." [...] The cover booklet expands on the theme, and features photographs of the flamenco dancer in several other poses; there are no song lyrics or written content, apart from album credits, in the booklet.|$|E
500|$|The novel {{carried the}} unusual credit of [...] "Sebastian Faulks writing as Ian Fleming" [...] and Faulks {{described}} how—using Fleming's article—he had employed the same style as Fleming {{did in his}} novels: [...] "it's standard journalistic: no semicolons, few adverbs, few adjectives, short sentences, a lot of verbs, a lot of concrete nouns. These are the tools, and that's literally the style." [...] Faulks also commented that [...] "some <b>people</b> <b>find</b> <b>it</b> perplexing but I think {{the way that the}} book has been presented... is a clever way of showing that it is not my book, although, of course, it is my book." [...] A large part of Devil May Care is set in Persia (now Iran); it was an area Fleming had not previously dealt with in his Bond novels, describing it as [...] "full of thieves and crooks". Faulks said of his choice of location that Fleming [...] "didn't set any of his books there, which is surprising in some ways because Lebanon in the 60s would have made a great setting for a Bond story. But his loss is my gain.".|$|E
25|$|Inhibitory control, often {{conceptualized}} {{as an executive}} function, {{is the ability to}} inhibit or hold back a prepotent response. It is theorized that impulsive behavior reflects a deficit in this ability to inhibit a response; impulsive <b>people</b> may <b>find</b> <b>it</b> more difficult to inhibit action whereas non-impulsive <b>people</b> may <b>find</b> <b>it</b> easier to do so. There is evidence that, in normal adults, commonly used behavioral measures of inhibitory control correlate with standard self-report measures of impulsivity.|$|R

500|$|Fox was in {{negotiations}} to star as Jennifer Check since {{the film was}} announced in 2007, and was officially cast in October 2007. Fox said the reason she agreed to the role was her love for the script. [...] "I think what I loved about the movie is it's so unapologetic and how completely inappropriate it is at all times," [...] she said. [...] "That was my favorite part about the script and about the character. It's fun {{to be able to}} say the shit that she got to say and get away with it and how <b>people</b> <b>find</b> <b>it</b> charming." [...] Asked how acting in a film like this is different from acting in Transformers, Fox said [...] "there's [...] distractions, like there's no robots to distract you from whatever performance I do give. So, if it's terrible, you're gonna fucking know that it's really terrible". She said despite this aspect of the business being intimidating, she enjoyed portraying the character. [...] "I wasn't really sure what I was doing," [...] said Fox. [...] "I was just trying to have fun with it and I felt like I was able to make fun of my own image as to how some people might perceive Megan Fox to be. I was just sort of flying freely and I hope some of it works." [...] To prepare for her role as a living-dead teenager, Fox dropped to a near-frail 97 pounds and stayed out of the sun to keep her skin pale. In balancing out the film's horror with humor, she said she relied heavily on Diablo Cody's script and Karyn Kusama's direction to pull it off, stating, [...] "I have a very specific sense of humor, things that I think are funny aren't going to fly with middle America. It's going to eliminate some of the audience, so you need someone there to tell you you can't do that." ...|$|E

2500|$|In general, {{the horse}} is on the [...] "correct" [...] lead when it matches the {{direction}} it is going. So a horse turning to the right {{is on the right}} lead, a horse turning to the left is on the left lead. However, just as <b>people</b> <b>find</b> <b>it</b> easier to write with one hand or the other, most horses have a [...] "better side", on which they find it easier to lead at a canter. [...] In limited circumstances, mostly in dressage training, a horse may be deliberately asked to take the lead opposite of the direction it is traveling. [...] In such cases, this type of canter is called a counter-canter.|$|E

5000|$|All-purpose flour is {{the most}} common flour used in baking. Its protein content lies between bread and cake flours and pastry flours. All-purpose is used in many recipes for the reason that <b>people</b> <b>find</b> <b>it’s</b> {{acceptable}} for most household baking needs. It can generally be substituted for recipes that call for either bread or cake flour, however, the final texture of the product may vary slightly. High-protein bread flour absorbs more liquid, so substituting all-purpose flour may result in a slightly stickier dough; while low-protein flour absorbs less liquid, so substituting with all-purpose flour may result in a slightly dry batter.2 ...|$|R
