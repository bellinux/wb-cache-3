Design Systematic review: Participants Eligible studies were randomised controlled trials comparing <b>prevocational</b> <b>training</b> or supported employment (for people with severe mental illness) with each other or with standard community care. Outcome measures The primary outcome was number of subjects in competitive employment outcomes, clinical outcomes, and costs. Results Eleven trials met the inclusion criteria. Five (1204 subjects) compared <b>prevocational</b> <b>training</b> with standard community care, one (256 subjects) compared supported employment with standard community care, and five (484 subjects) compared supported employment wit <b>prevocational</b> <b>training.</b> Subjects in supported employment {{were more likely to be}} in competitive employment than those who received <b>prevocational</b> <b>training</b> at 4, 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18 months (for example, 34 % v 12 % at 12 months; number needed to treat 4. 45, 95 % confidence interval 3. 37 to 6. 59). This effect was still present, although at a reduced level, after a sensitivity analysis that retained only the highest quality trials (31 % v 12 %; 5. 3, 3. 6 to 10. 4).

40|$|Portfolio {{careers in}} {{medicine}} {{can be defined}} as significant involvement in one or more portfolios of activity beyond a practitioner 2 ̆ 7 s primary clinical role, either concurrently or in sequence. Portfolio occupations may include medical education, research, administration, legal medicine, the arts, engineering, business and consulting, leadership, politics and entrepreneurship.

The present paper seeks to explore this issue. More formal systems for portfolio careers in Australia have the potential to increase job satisfaction, flexibility and retention, as well as diversify trainee skill sets.

40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} whether the processes of task performance {{as measured by the}} Assessment of Motor and Process Skills (AMPS) would discriminate between the employment levels of adults with schizophrenia. Participants: Twenty adults with schizophrenia who were engaged either in competitive employment, supported employment, <b>prevocational</b> <b>training,</b> or nonvocational activities, participated in this exploratory study. Methods: Each participant completed the AMPS, the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), the Addiction Severity Index (ASI), and theWorker Role Interview (WRI) to gather data about their occupational performance, symptoms, drug / alcohol use, and psychosocial / environmental factors that might influence their work related outcomes. Results: Analysis revealed a moderate correlation between the level of employment and the global scores of the process skills scale in the AMPS. Conclusions: This should be seen as preliminary evidence that beyond the basic cognitive functions, processes of task performance may also be a predictor of work related outcomes for this population. The results also highlighted the importance of considering personal causation and worker roles when assessing the work capacities of these clients.

40|$|Abstract Background Despite Hong Kong government's {{official}} {{commitment to}} the development of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) over the last ten years, there appears to have been limited progress in public sector initiated career development and postgraduate training (PGT) for public university trained TCM practitioners. Instead, the private TCM sector is expected {{to play a major role}} in nurturing the next generation of TCM practitioners. In the present study we evaluated TCM graduates' perspectives on their career prospects and their views regarding PGT. Method Three focus group discussions with 19 local TCM graduates who had worked full time in a clinical setting for fewer than 5 years. Results Graduates were generally uncertain about how to develop their career pathways in Hong Kong with few postgraduate development opportunities; because of this some were planning to leave the profession altogether. Despite their expressed needs, they were dissatisfied with the current quality of local PGT and suggested various ways for improvement including supervised practice-based learning, competency-based training, and accreditation of training with trainee involvement in design and evaluation. In addition they identified educational needs beyond TCM, in particular a better understanding of western medicine and team working so that primary care provision might be more integrated in the future. Conclusion TCM graduates in Hong Kong feel let down by the lack of public PGT opportunities which is hindering career development. To develop a new generation of TCM practitioners with the capacity to provide quality and comprehensive care, a stronger role for the government, including sufficient public funding, in promoting TCM graduates' careers and training development is suggested. Recent British and Australian experiences in <b>prevocational</b> western medicine <b>training</b> reform may serve as a source of references when relevant program for TCM graduates is planned in the future. </p...|$|R

Thank you. <b>Prevocational</b> and vocational <b>training</b> are interventions that are widely recognized as personally satisfying forms of occupation that can increase self-determination and employability while improving a person's health and well-being. In recent years a related intervention, structured peer mentoring, has been associated with increased community integration, greater residential independence and improved life satisfaction for social services consumers with a range of physical and psychiatric disabilities. Based on these favorable outcomes, peer mentoring is a potentially effective prevocational approach that is worth investigating for the benefit of consumers with a range of disabilities. In 2011, a prevocational Mentoring Volunteer Program was designed by an occupational therapist {{at the request of the}} agency Yad HaChazakah - The Jewish Disability Empowerment Center (JDEC) in New York City. The proposed program utilizes structured peer mentoring as its core intervention. It aims to serve the agency's religious Jewish consumers with physical and/or psychiatric disabilities who are interested in pursuing suitable competitive employment as a long-term goal. The Mentoring Volunteer Program is designed to 1) prepare peer mentoring participants using culturally-sensitive training based on principles of Bandura's Social Learning Theory; 2) offer ongoing supervision of weekly peer mentoring for one nine-month cycle each year; 3) offer mentees optional volunteer assignments in the Jewish community while being mentored; 4) utilize mentor, mentee and coordinator feedback at various points in the cycle to implement program improvements; and 5) provide a model for replication with a variety of populations; these would include traumatic brain injury survivors working towards community re-entry, and also special education high school students planning their transition to community living as adults...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background In Australia, {{training}} for general practice (GP) occurs within private practices and {{their involvement in}} teaching can have significant financial costs. At {{the same time there}} are growing demands for clinical places for all disciplines and for GP there is concern that there are insufficient teaching practices to meet the demand at the medical student, <b>prevocational</b> and vocational <b>training</b> levels. One option to address this may be to change how teaching occurs in the practice. A question that arises in posing such an option is whether different models of teaching change the costs for a teaching practice. The aim {{of this study is to}} determine the net financial outcome of teaching models in private GP. Methods Modelling the financial implications for a range of teaching options using a costing framework developed from a survey of teaching practices in South Australia. Each option was compared with the traditional model of teaching where one GP supervisor is singularly responsible for one learner. The main outcome measure was net financial outcome per week. Decisions on the model cost parameters were made by the study's Steering Group which comprised of experienced GP supervisors. Four teaching models are presented. Model 1 investigates the gains from teaching multiple same level learners, Models 2 and 3, the benefits of vertically integrated teaching using different permutations, and Model 4 the concept of a GP teacher who undertakes all the teaching. Results There was a significant increase in net benefits of Aus$ 547 per week (95 % confidence intervals $ 459, $ 668) to the practice when a GP taught two same level learners (Model 1) and when a senior registrar participated in teaching a prevocational doctor (Model 3, Aus$ 263, 95 % confidence intervals $ 80, $ 570). For Model 2, a practice could significantly reduce the loss if a registrar was involved in vertically integrated teaching which included the training of a medical student (Aus$ 551, 95 % confidence intervals $ 419, $ 718). The GP teacher model resulted in a net remuneration of Aus$ 207, 335 per year, sourced predominantly from the GP teacher activities, with no loss to the practice. Conclusions Our study costed teaching options that can maximise the financial outcomes from teaching. The inclusion of GP registrars in the teaching model or the supervisor teaching more than one same level learner results in a greater financial benefit. This gain was achieved through a reduction in supervisor teaching time and the sharing of administrative and teaching activities with GP registrars. We also show that a GP teacher who carries a minimal patient load can be a sustainable option for a practice. Further, the costing framework used for the teaching models presented in this study has the ability to be applied to any number of teaching model permutations. </p...|$|R

Thus {{the aim of the}} present study was to compare the 2 -year employment outcome of three groups of chronic psychiatric outpatients, having attended similar prevocational rehabilitation programmes in different periods of time. Methods The first group (1984 to 1986) comprised 67 rehabilitees, the second (1988 to 1989) 53 rehabilitees and the third (2000 to 2001) 56 rehabilitees. The three groups were compared with regard to employment follow-up achievements and hospitalisation rates assessed at the end of the 2 -year follow-up period by a constructed overall index, encompassing employment qualitative and quantitative characteristics. Results The third group compared to the first and second ones presented a worse employment outcome. No differences were found among the three groups with regard to hospitalisation rates. Conclusions There has been a decline in the employment outcome of <b>prevocational</b> <b>training</b> during the current decade. This decline can be attributed to contextual adverse factors such as unemployment, a more demanding labour market and disability allowances offered by the state (the 'benefit trap').

40|$|Medical {{education}} and training in Australia comprises four phases: basic education, <b>prevocational</b> <b>training,</b> vocational training and continuing professional development. Between the 1860 s and 1960 s, eight medical schools were established in Australia, admitting school leavers to courses comprised of preclinical, paraclinical and clinical phases. Between the 1970 s and the 1990 s, two innovative new schools were established and all schools made major reforms to student selection, curricula and teaching, learning and assessment methods. Since 2000, student numbers expanded rapidly, both in existing medical schools and in eight new schools established to meet workforce demands, particularly in the rural sector. <b>Prevocational</b> <b>training,</b> first introduced as a compulsory internship year in the 1930 s, has undergone reform and extension to subsequent years of junior doctor training {{through the agency of}} health departments and postgraduate medical education councils.

In Phase I, the procedure consisted of randomly pairing each task with all other tasks in a two-choice situation that required the subjects to select one task from each pair combination to work for a seven-minute period. The selection procedure consisted of presenting two representative task objects on a tray and requesting the subject to pick up one object and place it on the work table. The object selected represented the task worked for that period. The 15 possible pair combinations were presented randomly every two days for a period of 34 days to determine the preferences. During the validation phase (Phase II), each subject's least- and most-preferred tasks were paired separately with moderately-preferred tasks.

Design: Cost–benefit analysis of teaching in private general practice across three levels of training — undergraduate medical training, <b>prevocational</b> <b>training</b> and general practice vocational training — using data from a 2007 survey of general practitioners in South Australia. Setting and participants: GPs and practices teaching {{in association with the}} Adelaide to Outback GP Training Program or the Discipline of General Practice at the University of Adelaide. Main outcome measure: Net financial outcome per week. Results: The net financial outcome of teaching varied across the training levels. Practices incurred a net financial cost from teaching medical students that was statistically significantly different from zero. With respect to vocational training and teaching junior doctors, there were small net financial benefits to practices, although the mean estimates were not statistically significantly different from zero. Conclusions: This study shows a net financial cost for practices teaching medical students, while at the prevocational and vocational training levels, adequate levels of subsidies and income generated by the trainees help offset the costs of teaching.

Method: Fifty-three individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia from an outpatient treatment facility were included in an 18 -month follow-up study. After enrollment, they participated in a <b>prevocational</b> <b>training</b> group. At the end of training (baseline) and 18 months later, sociodemographic, clinical data and occupational history were collected. Positive and negative symptoms (Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale – PANSS), depression (Calgary Depression Scale), disease severity (Clinical Global Impression – CGI), functionality (Global Assessment of Functioning – GAF), personal and social performance (Personal and Social Performance – PSP) and cognitive functions (Measurement and Treatment Research to Improve Cognition in Schizophrenia – MATRICS battery) were applied at baseline and at the end of the study. Results: Those with some previous work experience (n= 19) presented lower scores on the PANSS, Calgary, GAF, CGI and PSP scales (p < 0. 05) than those who did not work. Among those who worked, there was a slight worsening in positive symptoms (positive PANSS). Conclusions: Individuals with less severe symptoms were more able to find employment. Positive symptom changes do not seem to affect participation at work; however, this calls for discussion about the importance of employment support...|$|E
40|$|David A Kandiah School of Psychiatry and Clinical Neurosciences, Faculty of Medicine, Dentistry and Health Sciences, University of Western Australia, Perth, WA, Australia Aim: Clinical {{teaching}} in Australian medical schools has changed {{to meet the}} needs of substantially increased medical student cohorts. As such, formal feedback from these student cohorts is needed about the value they place on the educational input from each clinical rotation. This study aims to determine which aspects of clinical placements are most educationally useful to medical students. Methods: In this study, final year medical students from the University of Western Australia (UWA) were surveyed via an anonymous online questionnaire, identifying which clinical placements were found to be the most and the least useful to their learning and the positive aspects of these placements. Two focus groups were conducted prior to the design of the questionnaire to determine the key areas of focus important to medical students. Ethics approval for this study was obtained from the UWA Human Research Ethics Committee. Results: Our focus groups were consistent in finding that students enjoyed placements where they were included as a part of the medical team and played a role in patient care. This was consistent with the concept that inclusiveness and participation in the clinical setting are important in developing competence in tasks and skills. The ratio of students to doctors was crucial, with a low ratio given a higher rating as seen in the rural clinical school. Conclusion: The results of this project could benefit both the local and national medical curricula in identifying the most effective clinical attachments for learning and preparation for <b>prevocational</b> <b>training.</b> This is relevant especially due to the limited number of clinical placements and growing cohort of medical students. The results of this study can also be extrapolated to international medical education. Keywords: educational value, clinical rotations, medical students, satisfactio...|$|E
40|$|Three {{sequential}} studies {{investigate the}} professional {{practice of the}} rehabilitation worker in delivering Orientation and Mobility (O&M) training to older visually impaired people. The first study explored through in-depth, face-to-face interviews (n= 17) professionals’ views of the relevance of O&M training to visually impaired people. Analysis of the findings suggested that the <b>prevocational</b> <b>training</b> of the rehabilitation worker equipped them with techniques that {{in the majority of}} cases required substantial adaptation {{to meet the needs of}} their predominant client group (older people). Emerging evidence of a gap between rehabilitation worker training and their practice prompted a second study to establish expert views of what constituted good practice in O&M with older people. Utilising a Delphi method, an expert panel (n= 5) produced detailed descriptions of the elements of good practice (family; mobility aids; public transport; assessment; orientation; sighted guide; the individual; road crossing; the public; the senses) that they considered to be essential for effective O&M intervention with older people. This framework provided the structure for the third study which explored – through telephone interviews (n= 29) with practising rehabilitation workers – how their experience of practice aligns with the expert view of ‘good practice’. A grounded analysis of the data uncovered how the rehabilitation worker adopts a common sense, pragmatic approach to the application of their practice. Whilst this enables them to draw directly from the expertise of their client, there is a lack of the underpinning knowledge they require to be confident that this practice is effective. Appreciating that the practising rehabilitation worker develops skills and abilities in order to deliver O&M that meets the needs of older visually impaired people, recommendations are made for the development of their pre- and post-vocational training...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the past}} several decades, {{research}} {{from a variety of}} fields has presented powerful evidence of the importance of employment to people with psychiatric disabilities. Many of these people want to work and can successfully participate in the labor market in a variety of competitive jobs. Researchers have also shown how employment can alleviate poverty, reduce hospitalization, and improve quality of life. Society also benefits through taxes paid by workers, goods and services they purchase, and reductions in entitlements and the overall cost of care. However, the 1997 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) reports employment rates for people {{with a wide range of}} mental disorders to be 37. 1 percent (Harris et al., 2005; New Freedom Commission on Mental Health, 2003). Employment rates for people with schizophrenia and related disorders are 22 percent (Jans, et al., 2004). Recently, funding agencies and practitioners have begun to move towards evidence-based practice in serving people with psychiatric disabilities. A number of reviews and meta-analyses of single-site, randomized controlled trials of supported employment for this group have found it to be more effective at establishing competitive employment outcomes than <b>prevocational</b> <b>training</b> or non-vocational community care (Crowther et al., 2001; Twamley et al., 2003; Wewiorski 2 ̆ 6 Fabian, 2004). Still in question at the time of this study 2 ̆ 7 s funding, however, was the effectiveness of different models of supported employment, operating in a variety of organizational settings, for consumers with diverse demographic characteristics, in different regions of the country. Therefore, the Employment Intervention Demonstration Program (EIDP) was designed as a multi-site randomized controlled trial of the effectiveness of supported employment (SE) for people with psychiatric disabilities in eight locations across the U. S. SE programs use a rapid job search approach to help clients obtain jobs directly (rather than providing lengthy assessment, training, and counseling), and provide them with ongoing support to maintain and improve their earnings after they start work. This policy brief describes the EIDP, presents study findings, and suggests some policy and research implications...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Queensland Health's Rural Generalist Pathway is a {{supported}} career pathway {{for junior}} doctors to train in rural and remote medicine. The pathway joins evidence with policy to achieve professional recognition, credentialing, and industrial recognition. Methods: This {{article describes the}} principles underpinning the notion of rural generalism, the background {{to the establishment of}} the Rural Generalist Pathway in Queensland, Australia, how the pathway has been developed {{to meet the needs of}} Queensland's rural and remote communities, the implementation of the pathway, and the implications for other jurisdictions. Results: In 2007, 30 trainees commenced on the pathway, with total enrolment now of 182 in 2012. Trainees commence at the start of internship, completing their <b>prevocational</b> <b>training</b> component in postgraduate years 1 to 2. After prevocational certification they undertake advanced specialised training in a range of specialties, and then complete vocational training in a rural location, usually in their 4 th to 5 th postgraduate years. Trainees complete their general practice training through a Regional Training Provider, and achieve vocational registration by completion of appropriate fellowship assessment requirements. The pathway is managed by a geographically dispersed team of educators, clinicians and managers. The Rural Generalist team provide training and career advice, advocate for trainees and assist with negotiating posts. They map progress of trainees through the Vocational Indicative Planning process and arrange other educational activities including Rural Generalist workshops. Applications are often oversubscribed, with the intake growing to 41 in 2012, located at 10 intern training hospitals. In total 90 trainees have completed advanced specialised training as at the end of 2012. Conclusion: The Rural Generalist Pathway includes a challenging prevocational start to the career, the opportunity to specialise in a procedural skill or skills of interest and obtain general practice vocational training in a rural setting and appears to be proving an attractive choice for medical graduates seeking a challenging and varied career. Early evidence suggests that by recognizing and rewarding the worth of rural and remote practice, this strategy is creating its own supply line. From its initial roll-out in Queensland, rural generalist training continues to generate increased interest and enthusiasm across all Australian states and territories wishing to join this new wave of generalist practice. This new generation of health professionals for a new generation of services has the potential to provide the rural medical workforce the bush needs...|$|E
