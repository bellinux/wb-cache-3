50|$|Some <b>psychoanalysts</b> {{have been}} labeled culturalist, {{because of the}} {{prominence}} they attributed culture in the genesis of behavior. Among others, Erich Fromm, Karen Horney, Harry Stack Sullivan, have been called culturalist <b>psychoanalysts.</b> They were famously in conflict with orthodox <b>psychoanalysts.</b>|$|R
50|$|Typically, this {{psychoanalysis}} must {{be conducted}} by a Supervising and Training Analyst. Most institutes (but not all) within the American Psychoanalytic Association, require that Supervising and Training Analysts become certified by the American Board of <b>Psychoanalysts.</b> Certification entails a blind review in which the <b>psychoanalysts</b> work is vetted by <b>psychoanalysts</b> outside of their local community. After earning certification, these <b>psychoanalysts</b> undergo another hurdle {{in which they are}} specially vetted by senior members of their own institute. Supervising and Training analysts are held to the highest clinical and ethical standards. Moreover, they are required to have extensive experience conducting psychoanalyses.|$|R

5|$|French <b>psychoanalyst</b> Jacques Lacan linked {{psychoanalysis}} with Kantian {{ethics in}} his works The Ethics of Psychoanalysis and Kant avec Sade and compared Kant with the Marquis de Sade. Lacan argued that Sade's maxim of jouissance—the pursuit of sexual pleasure or enjoyment—is morally acceptable by Kant's criteria {{because it can}} be universalised. He proposed that, while Kant presented human freedom as critical to the moral law, Sade further argued that human freedom is only fully realised through the maxim of jouissance.|$|E
5|$|He began {{experiencing}} traumatic dreams {{dominated by}} the colour white, and seeking to explain them he visited Franz Ricklin, a <b>psychoanalyst</b> who was a student of Carl Jung in Zurich in May 1959. In February 1960 he returned to Switzerland, and upon its arrival back in Brussels he began renting an apartment in Uccle, away from Germaine. His relationship with Germaine had ended, although due to restrictions under Belgian law {{he was unable to}} obtain a divorce until seventeen years later.|$|E
40|$|We {{assessed}} the attributional style of <b>psychoanalysts,</b> behavior therapists, and nontherapists {{by using a}} mail survey. Respondents listed causal explanations for three hypothetical problems experienced by either themselves, their friends, or their clients. Results indicated that (a) <b>psychoanalysts</b> gave more dispositional explanations than situational explanations, whereas the reverse was true for behavior therapists and nontherapists; (b) <b>psychoanalysts</b> gave psychological explanations for problems hypothetically experienced by their friends or clients, but physical explanations for the same problems hypothetically experienced by themselves; and (c) <b>psychoanalysts</b> holding medical degrees gave fewer psychological attributions and more physical attributions than behavior therapists or <b>psychoanalysts</b> with doctorate degrees. Therapeutic treatment recommendations depend on whether a client's problems are attributed primarily to situational constraints or to the disposition of the client, an evaluation that in turn depends {{on a number of}} factors. For example, chronic clients elicit more dispositional attributions than clients seen for the first time (Snyder, Shenkel, & Schmidt, 1976). The facto...|$|R

5|$|In his 1931 {{treatise}} On the Nightmare, Welsh <b>psychoanalyst</b> Ernest Jones {{asserted that}} vampires are symbolic of several unconscious drives and defence mechanisms. Emotions such as love, guilt, and hate fuel {{the idea of}} the return of the dead to the grave. Desiring a reunion with loved ones, mourners may project the idea that the recently dead must in return yearn the same. From this arises the belief that folkloric vampires and revenants visit relatives, particularly their spouses, first.|$|E
5|$|The <b>psychoanalyst</b> Richard Sterba {{wrote in}} 1982 that Reich {{had been a}} {{brilliant}} clinician and teacher in the 1920s; even the older analysts had wanted to attend his technical seminars in Vienna. But according to Sharaf, they came to consider Reich as paranoid and belligerent. Psychologist Luis Cordon wrote that Reich's slide from respectability concluded with the consensus {{inside and outside the}} psychoanalytic community that he was at best a crackpot and perhaps seriously ill.|$|E
5|$|According to Sharaf, 1934–1937 was {{the happiest}} period of Reich's {{personal}} life, despite the professional problems. His relationship with Elsa Lindenberg {{was good and}} he considered marrying her. When she became pregnant in 1935, they were initially overjoyed, buying clothes and furniture for the child, but doubts developed for Reich, who saw the future as too unsettled. To Lindenberg's great distress, Sharaf writes, Reich insisted on an abortion, at that time illegal. They went to Berlin, where the <b>psychoanalyst</b> Edith Jacobson helped to arrange it.|$|E

In 1926, American writer Max Eastman paid a {{visit to}} Sigmund Freud and claimed to have seen a print of The Nightmare displayed next to Rembrandt's The Anatomy Lesson in Freud's Vienna apartment. <b>Psychoanalyst</b> and Freud biographer Ernest Jones chose another version of Fuseli's painting as the frontispiece of his book On the Nightmare (1931); however, neither Freud nor Jones mentioned these paintings in their writings about dreams. Carl Jung included The Nightmare and other Fuseli works in his Man and His Symbols (1964).|$|E
5|$|Harry Elmer Barnes {{called the}} book {{one of the}} most {{exciting}} and challenging in the field of education since Émile. (This said, Hartup of Contemporary Psychology said Summerhill was closer to Freud's Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality than to Émile and criticized Neill's psychoanalytic overemphases.) The <b>psychoanalyst</b> Benjamin Wolstein put Neill's work alongside that of John Dewey, and Sir Herbert Read likened Neill to Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi and Henry Caldwell Cook. David Carr characterized the book as centered on moral education, despite Neill's recurrent insistence on the danger of moral teachings. Scholar Richard Bailey agreed with Carr's characterization.|$|E
5|$|Shakespeare {{influenced}} novelists such as Thomas Hardy, William Faulkner, and Charles Dickens. The American novelist Herman Melville's soliloquies owe much to Shakespeare; his Captain Ahab in Moby-Dick is {{a classic}} tragic hero, inspired by King Lear. Scholars have identified 20,000 pieces of music linked to Shakespeare's works. These include two operas by Giuseppe Verdi, Otello and Falstaff, whose critical standing compares {{with that of the}} source plays. Shakespeare has also inspired many painters, including the Romantics and the Pre-Raphaelites. The Swiss Romantic artist Henry Fuseli, a friend of William Blake, even translated Macbeth into German. The <b>psychoanalyst</b> Sigmund Freud drew on Shakespearean psychology, in particular, that of Hamlet, for his theories of human nature.|$|E

It is known for introducing his ideas to the American public. It was published in America on November 7, 1960, by the Hart Publishing Company and later revised as Summerhill School: A New View of Childhood in 1993. Its contents are a repackaged collection from four of Neill's previous works. The foreword was written by <b>psychoanalyst</b> Erich Fromm, who distinguished between authoritarian coercion and Summerhill.|$|E
5|$|The {{practice}} of allowing parents frequent visiting to hospitalised children became the norm {{and there was}} a move towards placing homeless children with foster carers, rather than in institutions, and a move towards the professionalisation of alternative carers. In hospitals, the change was given added impetus by the work of social worker and <b>psychoanalyst</b> James Robertson who filmed the distressing effects of separation on children in hospital and collaborated with Bowlby in making the 1952 documentary film A Two-Year Old Goes to the Hospital.|$|E
5|$|The {{search for}} the cause of this {{condition}} was enhanced considerably in 1968, when the Hereditary Disease Foundation (HDF) was created by Milton Wexler, a <b>psychoanalyst</b> based in Los Angeles, California, whose wife Leonore Sabin had been diagnosed earlier that year with Huntington's disease. The three brothers of Wexler's wife also suffered from this disease. The foundation was involved in the recruitment of over 100 scientists in the Huntington's Disease Collaborative Research Project who over a 10-year period worked to locate the responsible gene.|$|E

Insisting that divisive theoretical debates should be relegated to the past, these <b>psychoanalysts</b> promoted a medicalized, Americanized and popularized version of psychoanalysis that deliberately blurred the distinction between psychiatry and psychoanalysis.

5|$|After the war, H.D. and Bryher {{no longer}} lived together, but {{remained}} in contact. H.D. moved to Switzerland where, {{in the spring}} of 1946, she suffered a severe mental breakdown, which resulted in her staying in a clinic until the autumn of that year. Apart from a number of trips to the States, H.D. spent {{the rest of her life}} in Switzerland. In the late 1950s, she underwent more treatment, this time with the <b>psychoanalyst</b> Erich Heydt. At Heydt's prompting, she wrote End to Torment, a memoir of her relationship with Pound, who allowed the poems of Hilda's Book to be included when the book was published. Doolittle was one of the leading figures in the bohemian culture of London in the early decades of the century. Her later poetry explores traditional epic themes, such as violence and war, from a feminist perspective. H.D. was the first woman to be granted the American Academy of Arts and Letters medal.|$|E
5|$|American philosopher Louis Pojman has cited Pietism, {{political}} philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau, {{the modern}} debate between rationalism and empiricism, {{and the influence}} of natural law as influences on the development of Kant's ethics. Other philosophers have argued that Kant's parents and his teacher, Martin Knutzen, influenced his ethics. Those influenced by Kantian ethics include philosopher Jürgen Habermas, political philosopher John Rawls, and <b>psychoanalyst</b> Jacques Lacan. German philosopher G. W. F. Hegel criticised Kant for not providing specific enough detail in his moral theory to affect decision-making and for denying human nature. German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer argued that ethics should attempt to describe how people behave and criticised Kant for being prescriptive. Michael Stocker has argued that acting out of duty can diminish other moral motivations such as friendship, while Marcia Baron has defended the theory by arguing that duty does not diminish other motivations. The Catholic Church has criticised Kant's ethics as contradictory and regards Christian ethics as more compatible with virtue ethics.|$|E
5|$|In 1933, H.D. {{traveled}} to Vienna to undergo analysis with Sigmund Freud. She {{had an interest}} in Freud's theories as far back as 1909, when she read some of his works in the original German. H.D. was referred by Bryher's <b>psychoanalyst</b> due to her apparent paranoia about the rise of Adolf Hitler which indicated another world war, an idea that H.D. found intolerable. The Great War (World War I) had left her feeling shattered. She had lost her brother in action, while her husband suffered effects of combat experiences, and she believed that the onslaught of the war indirectly caused the death of her child with Aldington: she believed it was her shock at hearing the news about the RMS Lusitania that directly caused her child to be stillborn. Writing on the Wall, her memoir about this psychoanalysis, was written concurrently with Trilogy and published in 1944; in 1956 it was republished with Advent, a journal of the analysis, under the title Tribute to Freud.|$|E
