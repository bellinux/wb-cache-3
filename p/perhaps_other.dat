5|$|The Greek {{campaign}} {{ended with}} a complete German and Italian victory. The British {{did not have the}} military resources to carry out big simultaneous operations in North Africa and the Balkans. Moreover, even had they been able to block the Axis advance, they would have been unable to exploit the situation by a counter-thrust across the Balkans. The British came very near to holding Crete and <b>perhaps</b> <b>other</b> islands that would have provided air support for naval operations throughout the eastern Mediterranean.|$|E
5|$|The finless sleeper ray is {{susceptible}} to bottom trawls and <b>perhaps</b> <b>other</b> demersal fishing gear. It is a potential bycatch of fisheries operating throughout its range, which are particularly intense in the Andaman Sea. Most individuals caught are probably discarded, though post-capture survival rates {{are believed to be}} extremely low. Additionally, catches of this species by Burmese fishers are often sold in Phuket in Thailand. Due to heavy fishing pressure within its range and its low reproductive rate, the finless sleeper ray has been assessed as Vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Specific population data are lacking, but at least off Thailand electric ray populations overall appear to have declined since 1975.|$|E
5|$|After his {{translation}} to Canterbury, Stigand released Elmham to {{his brother}} Æthelmær, but retained the bishopric of Winchester. Canterbury and Winchester were the two richest sees in England, and while precedent allowed the holding of a rich see along with a poor one, there was no precedent for holding two rich sees concurrently. He may have retained Winchester out of avarice, or his hold on Canterbury {{may not have been}} secure. Besides these, he held the abbey of Gloucester and the abbey of Ely and <b>perhaps</b> <b>other</b> abbeys also. Whatever his reasons, the retention of Winchester made Stigand a pluralist: the holder of more than one benefice at the same time. This was a practice that was targeted for elimination by the growing reform movement in the church. Five successive popes (Leo IX, Victor II, Stephen IX, Nicholas II and Alexander II) excommunicated Stigand for holding both Winchester and Canterbury at the same time. It has been suggested by the historian Emma Mason that Edward refused to remove Stigand because this would have undermined the royal prerogative to appoint bishops and archbishops without papal input. Further hurting Stigand's position, Pope Nicholas II in 1061 declared pluralism to be uncanonical unless approved by the pope.|$|E

5|$|Majungasaurus was {{the largest}} {{predator}} in its environment, while the only known large herbivores {{at the time were}} sauropods like Rapetosaurus. Scientists have suggested that Majungasaurus, and <b>perhaps</b> <b>other</b> abelisaurids, specialized on hunting sauropods. Adaptations to strengthen the head and neck for a bite-and-hold type of attack might have been very useful against sauropods, which would have been tremendously powerful animals. This hypothesis may also be supported by the hindlegs of Majungasaurus, which were short and stocky, as opposed to the longer and more slender legs of most other theropods. While Majungasaurus would not have moved as fast as other similar-sized theropods, it would have had no trouble keeping up with slow-moving sauropods. The robust hindlimb bones suggest very powerful legs, and their shorter length would have lowered the animal's center of gravity. Thus Majungasaurus may have sacrificed speed for power. Majungasaurus tooth marks on Rapetosaurus bones confirm that it at least fed on these sauropods, whether or not it actually killed them.|$|E
5|$|With Henry VIII’s {{closure of}} the monasteries 1536–41, the advowson and tithes of Llanbadarn Fawr became the {{property}} of the lay owners. Under the later Stuarts the lordship of Llanbadarn had passed to the Earl of Danby, and the rectory to Sir Robert Holmes. By 1660 the tithes belonged to Roger Palmer (1634–1705), who became earl of Castlemaine by virtue (if that is the word) of his wife Barbara (née Villiers) being the mistress of Charles II. Since Castlemaine did not acknowledge Barbara’s five children by Charles (and <b>perhaps</b> <b>other</b> lovers) the tithes of Llanbadarn passed to his nephew James. His daughter Catherine married Giles Chichester of Arlington Court, Devon. They were both Catholics, which forced them to pay heavy taxes. Not all subsequent members of the Chichester family were absentees, however; Sir John Chichester, 1st Baronet, of Arlington Court, was High Sheriff of Cardiganshire in 1831, when he was living in Llanbadarn Fawr. But the income was lost to the church. The tithes were not especially valuable; in the eighteenth century the vicarage was worth only £27 annually; in the fourteenth century they were comparatively small compared with the income from the lands then owned by the church – which passed with the manor or lordship, on the Dissolution of the Monasteries, to the lay owners.|$|E
5|$|The nesting {{specimen}} MPC-D 107/15 {{has provided}} much {{information about the}} taphonomic processes (changes during fossilisation) in the Baruungoyot Formation. The specimen is preserved in facies that {{are thought to have}} been deposited through a sandstorm or dune-shift. It {{does not seem to have}} been transported after death, but the body appears to have shifted slightly to the right, indicating the sediment in which it was deposited came towards it from its left side. The neck is curved to the left, the left hand is folded backwards, and the legs are folded into a crouching position. The vertebral column, neck, and hips deteriorated during burial, and much of the damage to the skeleton is thought to have been caused by the activity of invertebrates. Borings in the bones, burrows, and reworked sediments (perhaps caused by the construction of pupal chambers) in the specimen indicate it was scavenged upon by colonies of skin beetles (Dermestidae) and <b>perhaps</b> <b>other</b> scavenging insects. There are many feeding traces in the joints of the skeleton, and almost all the surfaces where the bones articulated have been obliterated. There are also tunnels in the nest under the neck and skull, and no egg remains have been found in parts with such traces. Modern skin beetles mainly feed on muscle tissue but not on moist materials, and their activity is prevented by rapid burial. It is therefore thought that specimen MPC-D107/15 was only partially buried at first, with the upper part being exposed enough for a colony of skin beetles to develop. Some damage to the skeleton (especially in the vertebral column) may also have been caused by the scavenging of small mammals.|$|E

25|$|The {{opinion that}} the Agathyrsi were almost {{certainly}} Thracians results also from the writings preserved by Stephen of Byzantium, who explains that the Greeks called the Trausi the Agathyrsi, {{and we know that}} the Trausi lived in the Rhodope Mountains. Certain details from their way of life, such as tattooing, also suggest that the Agathyrsi were Thracians. Their place was later taken by the Dacians. That the Dacians were of Thracian stock is not in doubt, and it is safe to assume that this new name also encompassed the Agathyrsi, and <b>perhaps</b> <b>other</b> neighboring Thracian people as well, as a result of some political upheaval.|$|E
25|$|A {{possible}} {{method for}} mind uploading is serial sectioning, {{in which the}} brain tissue and <b>perhaps</b> <b>other</b> parts {{of the nervous system}} are frozen and then scanned and analyzed layer by layer, which for frozen samples at nano-scale requires a cryo-ultramicrotome, thus capturing the structure of the neurons and their interconnections. The exposed surface of frozen nerve tissue would be scanned and recorded, and then the surface layer of tissue removed. While this would be a very slow and labor-intensive process, research is currently underway to automate the collection and microscopy of serial sections. The scans would then be analyzed, and a model of the neural net recreated in the system that the mind was being uploaded into.|$|E

25|$|Greek temples {{were often}} {{enhanced}} with figural decorations. especially the frieze areas offered space for reliefs and relief slabs; the pedimental triangles often contained scenes of free-standing sculpture. In Archaic times, even the architrave could be relief-decorated on Ionic temples, {{as demonstrated by}} the earlier temple of Apollo at Didyma. Here, the architrave corners bore gorgons, surrounded by lions and <b>perhaps</b> <b>other</b> animals. On the other hand, the Ionic temples of Asia Minor did not possess a separate frieze to allow space for relief decoration. The most common area for relief decoration remained the frieze, either as a typical Doric triglyph frieze, with sculpted metopes, or as a continuous frieze on Cycladic and later on Eastern Ionic temples.|$|E
25|$|The {{next two}} hundred years {{followed}} a similar process of continual discussion throughout the entire Church, and localized refinements of acceptance. This process was not yet complete {{at the time of}} the First Council of Nicaea in 325, though substantial progress had been made by then. Though a list was clearly necessary to fulfill Constantine's commission in 331 of fifty copies of the Bible for the Church at Constantinople, no concrete evidence exists to indicate that it was considered to be a formal canon. In the absence of a canonical list, the resolution of questions would normally have been directed through the see of Constantinople, in consultation with Bishop Eusebius of Caesarea (who was given the commission), and <b>perhaps</b> <b>other</b> bishops who were available locally.|$|E
25|$|In the Flodden {{campaign}} {{the fleet}} consisted of 16 large and 10 smaller craft. After {{a raid on}} Carrickfergus in Ireland, it joined up with the French and had little impact on the war. After the disaster at Flodden the Great Michael, and <b>perhaps</b> <b>other</b> ships, were sold to the French and the king's ships disappeared from royal records after 1516. Scottish naval efforts would again rely on privateering captains and hired merchantmen during the minority of James V. In the Habsburg-Valois war of 1521–26, in which England and Scotland became involved on respective sides, the Scots had six men-of-war active attacking English and Imperial shipping and they blockaded the Humber in 1523. Although prizes were taken by Robert Barton and other captains, the naval campaign was sporadic and indecisive.|$|E
