5|$|Although <b>polyadenylation</b> is seen {{in almost}} all organisms, it is not universal. However, the wide {{distribution}} of this modification {{and the fact that}} it is present in organisms from all three domains of life implies that the last universal common ancestor of all living organisms, it is presumed, had some form of <b>polyadenylation</b> system. A few organisms do not polyadenylate mRNA, which implies that they have lost their <b>polyadenylation</b> machineries during evolution. Although no examples of eukaryotes that lack <b>polyadenylation</b> are known, mRNAs from the bacterium Mycoplasma gallisepticum and the salt-tolerant archaean Haloferax volcanii lack this modification.|$|E
5|$|In as {{different}} groups as animals and trypanosomes, the mitochondria contain both stabilising and destabilising poly(A) tails. Destabilising <b>polyadenylation</b> targets both mRNA and noncoding RNAs. The poly(A) tails are 43 nucleotides long on average. The stabilising ones {{start at the}} stop codon, and without them the stop codon (UAA) is not complete as the genome only encodes the U or UA part. Plant mitochondria have only destabilising <b>polyadenylation,</b> and yeast mitochondria have no <b>polyadenylation</b> at all.|$|E
5|$|Many protein-coding genes {{have more}} than one <b>polyadenylation</b> site, so a gene can code for several mRNAs that differ in their 3' end. Since {{alternative}} <b>polyadenylation</b> changes the length of the 3' untranslated region, it can change which binding sites for microRNAs the 3' untranslated region contains. MicroRNAs tend to repress translation and promote degradation of the mRNAs they bind to, although there are examples of microRNAs that stabilise transcripts. Alternative <b>polyadenylation</b> can also shorten the coding region, thus making the mRNA code for a different protein, but this is much less common than just shortening the 3' untranslated region.|$|E
5|$|<b>Polyadenylation</b> is the {{addition}} of a poly(A) tail to a messenger RNA. The poly(A) tail consists of multiple adenosine monophosphates; in other words, it is a stretch of RNA that has only adenine bases. In eukaryotes, <b>polyadenylation</b> is part of the process that produces mature messenger RNA (mRNA) for translation. It, therefore, forms part of the larger process of gene expression.|$|E
5|$|The {{process of}} <b>polyadenylation</b> begins as the {{transcription}} {{of a gene}} terminates. The 3'-most segment of the newly made pre-mRNA is first cleaved off {{by a set of}} proteins; these proteins then synthesize the poly(A) tail at the RNA's 3' end. In some genes these proteins add a poly(A) tail at one of several possible sites. Therefore, <b>polyadenylation</b> can produce more than one transcript from a single gene (alternative <b>polyadenylation),</b> similar to alternative splicing.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} mouse embryo, cytoplasmic <b>polyadenylation</b> of {{maternal}} RNAs from the egg cell allows the cell {{to survive and}} grow even though transcription does not start {{until the middle of}} the 2-cell stage (4-cell stage in human). In the brain, cytoplasmic <b>polyadenylation</b> is active during learning and could play a role in long-term potentiation, which is the strengthening of the signal transmission from a nerve cell to another in response to nerve impulses and is important for learning and memory formation.|$|E
5|$|The {{choice of}} poly(A) site can be {{influenced}} by extracellular stimuli and depends on {{the expression of the}} proteins that take part in <b>polyadenylation.</b> For example, the expression of CstF-64, a subunit of cleavage stimulatory factor (CstF), increases in macrophages in response to lipopolysaccharides (a group of bacterial compounds that trigger an immune response). This results in the selection of weak poly(A) sites and thus shorter transcripts. This removes regulatory elements in the 3' untranslated regions of mRNAs for defense-related products like lysozyme and TNF-α. These mRNAs then have longer half-lives and produce more of these proteins. RNA-binding proteins other than those in the <b>polyadenylation</b> machinery can also affect whether a polyadenyation site is used, as can DNA methylation near the <b>polyadenylation</b> signal.|$|E
5|$|The processive <b>polyadenylation</b> {{complex in}} the nucleus of eukaryotes works on {{products}} of RNA polymerase II, such as precursor mRNA. Here, a multi-protein complex (see components on the right) cleaves the 3'-most part of a newly produced RNA and polyadenylates the end produced by this cleavage. The cleavage is catalysed by the enzyme CPSF and occurs 10–30 nucleotides downstream of its binding site. This site often has the <b>polyadenylation</b> signal sequence AAUAAA on the RNA, but variants of it that bind more weakly to CPSF exist. Two other proteins add specificity to the binding to an RNA: CstF and CFI. CstF binds to a GU-rich region further downstream of CPSF's site. CFI recognises a third site on the RNA (a set of UGUAA sequences in mammals) and can recruit CPSF even if the AAUAAA sequence is missing. The <b>polyadenylation</b> signal– the sequence motif recognised by the RNA cleavage complex– varies between groups of eukaryotes. Most human <b>polyadenylation</b> sites contain the AAUAAA sequence, but this sequence is less common in plants and fungi.|$|E
5|$|While many {{bacteria}} and mitochondria have polyadenylate polymerases, {{they also have}} another type of <b>polyadenylation,</b> performed by polynucleotide phosphorylase itself. This enzyme is found in bacteria, mitochondria, plastids and as a constituent of the archaeal exosome (in those archaea that have an exosome). It can synthesise a 3' extension where {{the vast majority of}} the bases are adenines. Like in bacteria, <b>polyadenylation</b> by polynucleotide phosphorylase promotes degradation of the RNA in plastids and likely also archaea.|$|E
5|$|Cytoplasmic <b>polyadenylation</b> {{requires}} the RNA-binding proteins CPSF and CPEB, and can involve other RNA-binding proteins like Pumilio. Depending {{on the cell}} type, the polymerase can be {{the same type of}} polyadenylate polymerase (PAP) that is used in the nuclear process, or the cytoplasmic polymerase GLD-2.|$|E
5|$|Poly(A)polymerase {{was first}} {{identified}} in 1960 as an enzymatic activity in extracts made from cell nuclei that could polymerise ATP, but not ADP, into polyadenine. Although identified in {{many types of}} cells, this activity had no known function until 1971, when poly(A) sequences were found in mRNAs. The only function of these sequences was thought at first to be protection of the 3' end of the RNA from nucleases, but later the specific roles of <b>polyadenylation</b> in nuclear export and translation were identified. The polymerases responsible for <b>polyadenylation</b> were first purified and characterized in the 1960s and 1970s, but {{the large number of}} accessory proteins that control this process were discovered only in the early 1990s.|$|E
5|$|The APOA5 gene resides on {{chromosome}} 11 at {{the band}} 11q23 and contains 4 exons and 3 introns. This gene uses alternate <b>polyadenylation</b> sites and is located proximal to the apolipoprotein gene cluster on chromosome 11q23.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to single proteins, other protein complexes {{interact with the}} exosome. One of those is the cytoplasmic Ski complex, which includes an RNA helicase (Ski2) and is involved in mRNA degradation. In the nucleus, the processing of rRNA and snoRNA by the exosome is mediated by the TRAMP complex, which contains both RNA helicase (Mtr4) and <b>polyadenylation</b> (Trf4) activity.|$|E
5|$|The RNA is {{typically}} cleaved before transcription termination, as CstF also binds to RNA polymerase II. Through a poorly understood mechanism (as of 2002), it signals for RNA polymerase II to slip {{off of the}} transcript. Cleavage also involves the protein CFII, though it is unknown how. The cleavage site associated with a <b>polyadenylation</b> signal can vary up to some 50 nucleotides.|$|E
5|$|The poly(A) tail is {{important}} for the nuclear export, translation, and stability of mRNA. The tail is shortened over time, and, when it is short enough, the mRNA is enzymatically degraded. However, in a few cell types, mRNAs with short poly(A) tails are stored for later activation by re-polyadenylation in the cytosol. In contrast, when <b>polyadenylation</b> occurs in bacteria, it promotes RNA degradation. This is also sometimes the case for eukaryotic non-coding RNAs.|$|E
5|$|There is <b>polyadenylation</b> in the cytosol of some {{animal cell}} types, namely in the germ line, during early {{embryogenesis}} and in post-synaptic sites of nerve cells. This lengthens the poly(A) tail of an mRNA with a shortened poly(A) tail, {{so that the}} mRNA will be translated. These shortened poly(A) tails are often less than 20 nucleotides, and are lengthened to around 80–150 nucleotides.|$|E
5|$|In {{eukaryotic}} somatic cells, the poly(A) tail of most mRNAs in the cytoplasm gradually get shorter, and mRNAs with shorter poly(A) tail are translated {{less and}} degraded sooner. However, {{it can take}} many hours before an mRNA is degraded. This deadenylation and degradation process can be accelerated by microRNAs complementary to the 3' untranslated region of an mRNA. In immature egg cells, mRNAs with shortened poly(A) tails are not degraded, but are instead stored without being translated. They are then activated by cytoplasmic <b>polyadenylation</b> after fertilisation, during egg activation.|$|E
5|$|In many bacteria, both mRNAs and non-coding RNAs can be polyadenylated. This poly(A) tail {{promotes}} degradation by the degradosome, {{which contains}} two RNA-degrading enzymes: polynucleotide phosphorylase and RNase E. Polynucleotide phosphorylase binds to the 3' end of RNAs and the 3' extension {{provided by the}} poly(A) tail allows it to bind to the RNAs whose secondary structure would otherwise block the 3' end. Successive rounds of <b>polyadenylation</b> and degradation of the 3' end by polynucleotide phosphorylase allows the degradosome to overcome these secondary structures. The poly(A) tail can also recruit RNases that cut the RNA in two. These bacterial poly(A) tails are about 30 nucleotides long.|$|E
5|$|In nuclear <b>polyadenylation,</b> a poly(A) tail {{is added}} to an RNA {{at the end of}} transcription. On mRNAs, the poly(A) tail protects the mRNA {{molecule}} from enzymatic degradation in the cytoplasm and aids in transcription termination, export of the mRNA from the nucleus, and translation. Almost all eukaryotic mRNAs are polyadenylated, with the exception of animal replication-dependent histone mRNAs. These are the only mRNAs in eukaryotes that lack a poly(A) tail, ending instead in a stem-loop structure followed by a purine-rich sequence, termed histone downstream element, that directs where the RNA is cut so that the 3' end of the histone mRNA is formed.|$|E
5|$|Newly {{synthesized}} mRNA molecules {{are known}} as primary transcripts or pre-mRNA. They must undergo post-transcriptional modification in the nucleus before being exported to the cytoplasm; mRNA that appears in the cytoplasm without these modifications is degraded rather than used for protein translation. The three main modifications are 5' capping, 3' <b>polyadenylation,</b> and RNA splicing. While in the nucleus, pre-mRNA {{is associated with a}} variety of proteins in complexes known as heterogeneous ribonucleoprotein particles (hnRNPs). Addition of the 5' cap occurs co-transcriptionally and {{is the first step in}} post-transcriptional modification. The 3' poly-adenine tail is only added after transcription is complete.|$|E
5|$|RNA splicing, {{carried out}} by a complex called the spliceosome, is {{the process by which}} introns, or regions of DNA that do not code for protein, are removed from the pre-mRNA and the {{remaining}} exons connected to re-form a single continuous molecule. This process normally occurs after 5' capping and 3' <b>polyadenylation</b> but can begin before synthesis is complete in transcripts with many exons. Many pre-mRNAs, including those encoding antibodies, can be spliced in multiple ways to produce different mature mRNAs that encode different protein sequences. This process is known as alternative splicing, and allows production of a large variety of proteins from a limited amount of DNA.|$|E
25|$|<b>Polyadenylation</b> tail: Creates a <b>polyadenylation</b> tail {{at the end}} of the {{transcribed}} pre-mRNA {{that protects}} the mRNA from exonucleases and ensures transcriptional and translational termination: stabilizes mRNA production.|$|E
25|$|CXorf66 {{has only}} {{been found to have}} only one <b>polyadenylation</b> site.|$|E
25|$|Another {{modification}} is 3' cleavage and <b>polyadenylation.</b> They {{occur if}} <b>polyadenylation</b> signal sequence (5'- AAUAAA-3') {{is present in}} pre-mRNA, which is usually between protein-coding sequence and terminator. The pre-mRNA is first cleaved and then a series of ~200 adenines (A) are added to form poly(A) tail, which protects the RNA from degradation. Poly(A) tail is bound by multiple poly(A)-binding proteins (PABP) necessary for mRNA export and translation re-initiation.|$|E
25|$|If {{the cell}} has a nucleus, the RNA may be further processed. This may include <b>polyadenylation,</b> capping, and splicing.|$|E
25|$|As Pol II {{reaches the}} end of a gene, two protein {{complexes}} carried by the CTD, CPSF (cleavage and <b>polyadenylation</b> specificity factor) and CSTF (cleavage stimulation factor), recognize the poly-A signal in the transcribed RNA. Poly-A-bound CPSF and CSTF recruit other proteins to carry out RNA cleavage and then <b>polyadenylation.</b> Poly-A polymerase adds approximately 200 adenines to the cleaved 3’ end of the RNA without a template. The long poly-A tail is unique to transcripts made by Pol II.|$|E
25|$|Transcription {{termination}} in eukaryotes is {{less well}} understood than in bacteria, but involves cleavage {{of the new}} transcript followed by template-independent addition of adenines at its new 3' end, in a process called <b>polyadenylation.</b>|$|E
25|$|Termination is {{the process}} of {{breaking}} up the polymerase complex and ending the RNA strand. In eukaryotes using RNA Pol II, this termination is very variable (up to 2000 bases), relying on post transcriptional modification. See: Messenger RNA and <b>Polyadenylation.</b>|$|E
25|$|Astroviruses have a genome {{composed}} of a single strand of positive sense RNA. The strand has a poly A tail at the 3' end, but no 5' cap. With the exclusion of <b>polyadenylation</b> at the 3' end, the genome is between 6.87.9 kb long.|$|E
25|$|Is {{involved}} in differentiating {{between self and}} non-self mRNA. Without 2′-O-methylation activity the immune system triggers higher levels of type 1 interferon activity. It is also seen that the 2′-O-methylation occurs in plants and animals to help protect the 3' end of miRNA(microRNA) from <b>polyadenylation.</b>|$|E
25|$|Pre-mRNAs {{from the}} D. melanogaster gene dsx contain 6 exons. In males, exons 1,2,3,5,and 6 are joined {{to form the}} mRNA, which encodes a {{transcriptional}} regulatory protein required for male development. In females, exons 1,2,3, and 4 are joined, and a <b>polyadenylation</b> signal in exon 4 causes cleavage of the mRNA at that point. The resulting mRNA is a transcriptional regulatory protein required for female development.|$|E
25|$|DNA {{vaccines}} elicit {{the best}} immune response when highly active expression vectors are used. These are plasmids that usually {{consist of a}} strong viral promoter to drive the in vivo transcription and translation of the gene (or complementary DNA) of interest. Intron A may sometimes be included to improve mRNA stability and hence increase protein expression. Plasmids also include a strong polyadenylation/transcriptional termination signal, such as bovine growth hormone or rabbit beta-globulin <b>polyadenylation</b> sequences. Multicistronic vectors are sometimes constructed to express more than one immunogen, or to express an immunogen and an immunostimulatory protein.|$|E
25|$|In 1981, {{the first}} example of {{alternative}} splicing in a transcript from a normal, endogenous gene was characterized. The gene encoding the thyroid hormone calcitonin {{was found to be}} alternatively spliced in mammalian cells. The primary transcript from this gene contains 6 exons; the calcitonin mRNA contains exons 1–4, and terminates after a <b>polyadenylation</b> site in exon 4. Another mRNA is produced from this pre-mRNA by skipping exon 4, and includes exons 1–3, 5, and 6. It encodes a protein known as CGRP (calcitonin gene related peptide). Examples of alternative splicing in immunoglobin gene transcripts in mammals were also observed in the early 1980s.|$|E
25|$|Another {{consideration}} {{is the choice}} of promoter. The SV40 promoter was conventionally used until research showed that vectors driven by the Rous Sarcoma Virus (RSV) promoter had much higher expression rates. More recently, expression rates have been further increased {{by the use of}} the cytomegalovirus (CMV) immediate early promoter. Inclusion of the Mason-Pfizer monkey virus (MPV)-CTE with/without rev increased envelope expression. Furthermore, the CTE+rev construct was significantly more immunogenic than CTE-alone vector. Additional modifications to improve expression rates include the insertion of enhancer sequences, synthetic introns, adenovirus tripartite leader (TPL) sequences and modifications to the <b>polyadenylation</b> and transcriptional termination sequences. An example of DNA vaccine plasmid is pVAC, which uses SV40 promoter.|$|E
25|$|There are 17 {{different}} mRNAS {{produced from}} the CCDC130 gene. 13 of these mRNAs come from alternative splicing, {{and the other}} four are unspliced. There have been four alternative promoters, five alternative <b>polyadenylation</b> sites, and four alternative last exons described. Two instances of intron retention have been described. 14 different proteins have been identified from the CCDC130 gene, all of which contain the DUF572 domain but only five seem to show the coiled-coil stretch. The other three mRNAs were very low quality and were not translated. It was also noted that this gene {{has the potential to}} encode several non-overlapping proteins. 45 SNPs have been documented for CCDC130 on NCBI: 29 missense mutations and 16 synonymous mutations that don't change the amino acid.|$|E
500|$|For many non-coding RNAs, {{including}} tRNA, rRNA, snRNA, and snoRNA, <b>polyadenylation</b> {{is a way}} of {{marking the}} RNA for degradation, at least in yeast. This <b>polyadenylation</b> is done in the nucleus by the TRAMP complex, [...] which maintains a tail that is around 4 nucleotides long to the 3' end. The RNA is then degraded by the exosome. Poly(A) tails have also been found on human rRNA fragments, both the form of homopolymeric (A only) and heterpolymeric (mostly A) tails.|$|E
