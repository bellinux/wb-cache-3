5|$|Both {{principal}} façades, East and West, {{are dominated}} by massive clockfaces. The Zytglogge's first clockface was likely located on the <b>plinth,</b> but was moved up {{to the center of}} the shaft during the tower's 15th-century reconfiguration.|$|E

5000|$|The main facade (which is {{oriented}} to the west) {{is decorated with}} a gable, cut and ornamented in spiral decoration, surmounted by cornices and Latin cross over double <b>plinths.</b> The main portal in a polylobial arch, includes several frames, flanked by two orders of pilasters and two columns built into the wall, surmounted by friezes over rectangular <b>plinths.</b> These <b>plinths</b> include inferior <b>plinths</b> supporting fragments of the portico and superior <b>plinths</b> with angular cornices, that extend until the corners, and pinnacles similar to balustrades. Between the portal and corners, are small backrests with the Portuguese shield. Over the cornices are quadrangular oculae, with circular frames of spiral and shell motifs with frieses, containing interlaced motifs and inscription, surmounted by volumous cartazes and shell with the monogram [...] "AM" [...] (MATER DEI, Latin for Mother of God).|$|R

5|$|Its {{main body}} is solid {{sterling}} silver and silver gilt, while its <b>plinth</b> {{is made of}} malachite, a semi-precious stone. The <b>plinth</b> has a silver band around its circumference, upon which {{the names of the}} title-winning clubs are listed. Malachite's green colour is also representative of the green field of play. The design of the trophy is based on the heraldry of Three Lions that is associated with English football. Two of the lions are found above the handles {{on either side of the}} trophy – the third is symbolised by the captain of the title-winning team as he raises the trophy, and its gold crown, above his head at the end of the season. The ribbons that drape the handles are presented in the team colours of the league champions that year.|$|E
5|$|The Xerxes {{exists in}} four {{distinct}} versions. The original two-plinth Xerxes (1985) was discontinued after about eight years' production, after the Touraj Moghaddam Signature (TMS) was launched. On the 10th {{anniversary of the}} company (1995), Roksan reprised the entry-level Xerxes turntable with a 3-plinth design named Xerxes.X. Its top <b>plinth</b> houses the tonearm and the main bearing, and is isolated from the base by five Blobs, which also allow the <b>plinth</b> to be adjusted in two planes – parallel and perpendicular to the motor and main bearing. The motor is driven by XPS V Reference motor drive, which receives power from DS1.5 Reference Power Supply.|$|E
5|$|A large table tomb at {{the west}} end of the churchyard is listed {{separately}} by English Heritage as a GradeII-listed structure. Dating from about 1800, it contains the remains of George and Mary Hutchinson. The structure is of pale (but heavily weathered) stone, including a two-step <b>plinth,</b> with various inscriptions on the sides, topped with a carved urn decorated with putti. The Grade II listing was given on 23February 1983.|$|E

5|$|Navenby lost {{many men}} {{during the two}} World Wars. The village war memorial, a rough hewn stone Celtic Cross mounted on a <b>plinth</b> with a three-stepped base, is in the churchyard of St Peter's. It was {{manufactured}} by Messrs G Maile & Son Ltd {{at a cost of}} £200, and unveiled in April 1921.

The base of the tower rests directly on the rock, levelled up with masonry to form a <b>plinth.</b> The tower was probably originally surrounded by service buildings, possibly within a walled enclosure, part of which may survive in the stone wall running from the castle to the north-east.|$|E
5|$|The Old Man of Hoy {{is a red}} {{sandstone}} stack and {{perched on}} a <b>plinth</b> of basalt rock. It is separated from the mainland by a 60-metre (200ft) chasm strewn with debris, and has nearly vertical sides with a top just a few metres wide. The rock is composed of layers of soft, sandy and pebbly sandstone and harder flagstones of Old Red Sandstone, giving the sides a notched and slab-like profile.|$|E

There is a choice of three levels: 120km, most of the cobbled sectors; 190km all the cobbles; or the full 261km. All finishers receive a small cobblestone on a wooden <b>plinth.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Rega Planar 3, {{together}} with its successors, the P3 and RP3, {{is a well-known}} budget audiophile turntable by British hi-fi manufacturer, Rega Research available since 1977. It was a belt-drive deck that broke from convention, by employing a solid <b>plinth</b> {{in lieu of the}} compliantly-suspended chassis or sub-chassis used in many quality turntables since the early 1960s.|$|E
5|$|The Roksan Xerxes {{transcription}} turntable (often shortened to Xerxes) is {{a record}} player named after the Persian king Xerxes I and produced by London-based Roksan Audio. Designed by Roksan co-founder, Touraj Moghaddam, the Xerxes is a belt-driven turntable that has a solid <b>plinth.</b> Launched in 1985, the sound quality of the product positioned it as a strong competitor against the established industry leader, the Linn Sondek LP12. Many reviewers use the Xerxes as a reference turntable.|$|E

5|$|According to the manufacturer, the Xerxes.20plus {{incorporates}} key design {{elements from}} the TMS3, including the tungsten carbide bearing ball, {{inner and outer}} aluminium platter, mat and decoupler blobs. The isolation between the <b>plinth</b> layers of the 20 has been improved for the Plus. The bearing is of a higher quality; the platter and sub-platter have been redesigned. A mat with distinctive cut-outs {{is placed on the}} platter assembly to support the disc. While the top board sits on decoupling blobs, the lower half has bright polished-metal feet. The bearing ball, Blobs and mat are available to existing owners for retrofitting their legacy Xerxes.10 and Xerxes.20 turntables.|$|E
5|$|After Hull's death, {{the people}} of Shangani {{organised}} {{the construction of a}} memorial in his honour—a granite <b>plinth</b> to which a brass plaque was affixed commemorating the pilot's service and bravery. This monument was completed {{before the end of the}} war and erected alongside the main road between Bulawayo and Gwelo, near the bridge over the Shangani River. A memorial to the actions of Hull, Falkson and Lydekker at Bodø was built at the town's airport three decades later, and inaugurated on 17 June 1977 with the Norwegian Minister of Defence, Rolf Arthur Hansen, in attendance.|$|E

5|$|Boston honored Russell by {{erecting}} {{a statue}} of him on City Hall Plaza in 2013: he is depicted in-game, surrounded by 11 plinths representing the 11 championships he helped the Celtics win. Each <b>plinth</b> features a key word and related quote to illustrate Russell's multiple accomplishments. The Bill Russell Legacy Foundation, established by the Boston Celtics Shamrock Foundation, funded the project. The art is by Ann Hirsch of Somerville, Massachusetts, in collaboration with Pressley Associates Landscape Architects of Boston. The statue was unveiled on November 1, 2013, with Russell in attendance.|$|E
5|$|First on the {{schedule}} were the scenes on the Madagascar building site, shot in the Bahamas {{on the site of}} a derelict hotel which Michael G. Wilson had become acquainted with in 1977 during the filming of The Spy Who Loved Me. In the scene, Bond drives a digger toward the building, slamming into the concrete <b>plinth</b> on which Mollaka is running. The stunt team built a model and put forward several ways in which the digger could conceivably take out the concrete, including taking out the pillar underneath. A section of the concrete wall was removed to fit the digger and reinforced with steel.|$|E
5|$|In December 2005, the two ton Reclining Figure (1969–70) – insured for £3 million – {{was lifted}} by crane from {{the grounds of}} the Henry Moore Foundation on to a lorry and has not been recovered. Two men were jailed for a year in 2012 for {{stealing}} a sculpture called Sundial (1965) and the bronze <b>plinth</b> of another work, also from the foundation's estate. In October 2013 Standing Figure (1950), one of four Moore pieces in Glenkiln Sculpture Park, estimated to be worth £3 million, was stolen.|$|E

50|$|When Colquhoun Square was {{redesigned}} in 2015 {{an integral}} part of its new look was the Outdoor Museum. Around 120 <b>plinths</b> have been erected in the Square, largely as a means of directing the little traffic which is allowed there. The long-term aim is that these <b>plinths</b> will gradually be filled over the years with items or replicas of items connected with Helensburgh's history and character.|$|R
