40|$|Most birds <b>preen</b> their {{feathers}} with an oily excrete {{from the}} uropygial (<b>preen)</b> gland.

Black-legged kittiwakes (Rissa tridactyla) were studied during two periods of high energy demand: incubation and chick-rearing. A rather high concentration of POPs in <b>preen</b> gland tissue indicates that the <b>preen</b> gland secrete is an excretory pathway for POPs in kittiwakes.

40|$|It has {{recently}} been shown that sandpipers (Scolopacidae) abruptly switch the chemical composition of their <b>preen</b> gland secretions from mono- to diester waxes just before the period of courtship. The timing and context of the shift suggested that diesters could provide a visible quality signal during mate choice. We used captive red knots Calidris canutus to test whether mono- and diester <b>preen</b> waxes affect the light reflectance ("colour") to the plumage. We also determined light absorbance spectra of the two wax types. The reflectance of breast feathers of the breeding plumage was measured with spectrophotometry when birds secreted monoesters and six weeks later when they secreted diester <b>preen</b> waxes. Light reflectance was also measured after removing the mono- and diester waxes from the plumage with a solvent. The results show that: (1) diester <b>preen</b> waxes absorb more light, especially ultraviolet (UV), than monoester <b>preen</b> waxes, but that (2) the compositional shift in the <b>preen</b> waxes did not change plumage reflectance and, (3) the removal of <b>preen</b> waxes did not change the reflectance of the plumage within the light spectrum assumed visible to birds (320 - 700 nm).

5|$|The California condor has a {{long life}} span, {{reaching}} up to 60 years. If it survives to adulthood, the condor has few natural threats other than humans.

Condors also perform urohidrosis, or defecate on their legs, to reduce their body temperature. There is a well-developed social structure within large groups of condors, with competition to determine a pecking order decided by body language, competitive play behavior, {{and a variety of}} hisses and grunts. This social hierarchy is displayed especially when the birds feed, with the dominant birds eating before the younger ones.|$|E

40|$|During incubation, ground-breeding {{sandpipers}} such as Red Knots (Calidris canutus) {{create a}} warm, humid microclimate in the nest, conditions that favor {{the growth of}} feather-degrading bacteria present in their plumage.

Males, known as drakes, are often larger than females (simply known as ducks) and are differently coloured in some breeds. Domestic ducks are omnivores, eating a variety of animal and plant materials such as aquatic insects, molluscs, worms, small amphibians, waterweeds, and grasses. They feed in shallow water by dabbling, with their heads underwater and their tails upended. Most domestic ducks are too heavy to fly, and they are social birds, preferring to live and move around together in groups.

40|$|Birds {{possess a}} <b>preen</b> (or uropygial) gland on their rump that secretes {{substances}} which are <b>preened</b> into the plumage, {{and which are}} probably essential for plumage maintenance. Secretions of the uropygial gland consist predominantly of wax-esters: fatty acids esterified to alcohols. These wax components vary in chain length and in degree and location of branching of the carbon skeletons, resulting in complex mixtures of many different wax esters in <b>preen</b> gland secretions. We have found that shorebirds show pronounced seasonal changes {{in the composition of}} their <b>preen</b> waxes. Between arrival on and departure from breeding grounds, their usual monoester wax at winter quarters changes dramatically to a more complex diester-based wax, which is maintained throughout the breeding season. The diesters have higher molecular weights and probably different physical properties than monoesters, and the secretion and use of diesters rather than monoesters may entail specific costs and benefits. We discuss how natural and sexual selection could explain the evolution of compositional shifts in <b>preen</b> waxes and outline possible approaches for future research. ...|$|R

5|$|Having {{the largest}} wing-area-to-body-weight ratio of any bird, {{frigatebirds}} are essentially aerial. This {{allows them to}} soar continuously and only rarely flap their wings.

Like swifts {{they are able to}} spend the night on the wing, but they will also return to an island to roost on trees or cliffs. Field observations in the Mozambique Channel found that great frigatebirds could remain on the wing for up to 12 days while foraging. Highly adept, they use their forked tails for steering during flight and make strong deep wing-beats, though not suited to flying by sustained flapping. Frigatebirds bathe and clean themselves in flight by flying low and splashing at the water surface before <b>preening</b> and scratching afterwards. Conversely, frigatebirds do not swim and with their short legs cannot walk well or take off from the sea easily.|$|E
5|$|Healthy {{pelicans}} {{can usually}} {{cope with their}} lice, but sick birds may carry hundreds of individuals, which hastens their demise. The pouch louse Piagetiella peralis, which occurs in the pouch and therefore cannot be removed by <b>preening,</b> is usually not a serious problem, even when present in such numbers that it covers the whole interior of the pouch, but sometimes inflammation and bleeding may harm the host. The brown pelican has a similarly extensive range of parasites. The nematodes Contracaecum multipapillatum and C. mexicanum and the trematode Ribeiroia ondatrae have caused illness and mortality in the Puerto Rican population, possibly endangering the pelican on this island.

40|$|It is only {{recently}} that studies have explored {{the use of}} olfaction in birds. Birds are now known to use odour cues for navigation, and locating food. Odours produced by the birds themselves can also function in nest recognition and even mate choice. The odours of most birds stem from the <b>preen</b> wax produced by the uropygial or <b>preen</b> gland. The wax is comprised of a complex mixture of esters and volatiles, and is known to vary in some species with age, sex, season, or environmental conditions. Its function {{has been associated with}} feather maintenance, but it may also play a role in sexual selection and chemical communication. In this thesis, I used the <b>preen</b> gland and its <b>preen</b> wax to perform comparative studies on the evolution of odours between island birds and their continental relatives. I used the birds of the Oceania region as a model system, where most passerines originated from continental Australia but have colonised numerous surrounding islands such as New Zealand and New Caledonia. As islands generally lack mammalian predators, and have less parasites and less interspecific competition than continents, these differences in environmental conditions likely shaped functional differences in the <b>preen</b> gland and its products. I measured the size of the <b>preen</b> gland and collected <b>preen</b> wax from a variety of forest passerines in Australia, New Zealand and New Caledonia. I found that island birds have larger <b>preen</b> glands and therefore likely produce more <b>preen</b> wax than their continental relatives. I also found that the <b>preen</b> wax composition differed among species, with a shift to birds on islands producing disproportionately lighter and more volatile compounds. I suggest that selection favoured the gain of more volatile molecules in island birds as they were released from the constraint to camouflage their odours that is imposed by mammalian predators on continental areas. It is possible that this also allowed greater communication through olfactory channels in island birds, and such communication is enhanced through the use of more volatile compounds. To support this hypothesis I showed that the South Island robin (Petroica australis) was able to detect and react to the odour of a conspecific (odours produced by <b>preen</b> wax) {{in the absence of any}} visual cues. From a conservation perspective, increased volatility of the <b>preen</b> waxes of island birds might place them at increased risk from introduced mammalian predators that use olfaction to locate their prey. However, in both laboratory tests using Norway rats (Rattus norvegicus), a common exotic predator, and in field trials using rodent tracking tunnels, I found only limited evidence to suggest the odour of island birds places them at greater risk, and more experiments are needed to test this hypothesis. Finally, my findings of more conspicuous odours in island birds suggest new avenues of research for their conservation, including whether island species that seem especially prone to predation have <b>preen</b> waxes (and thus odours) that are also especially attractive to exotic mammalian predators. Conservation programmes to protect endangered island birds may even benefit from considering whether olfactory cues can be minimised as a method of reducing predation risk...|$|R
