40|$|Microwave-assisted <b>polymerizations</b> is {{a growing}} field of {{interest}} because the use of microwave irradiation instead of thermal heating was demonstrated to result in faster, cleaner, and higher yielding reactions. To overcome the one-at-a-time nature of preparing <b>polymerizations</b> in single microwave vials and the possible scale-up method for microwave-assisted <b>polymerizations,</b> the use of continuous-flow reactions under microwave irradiation seems to be ideal. In this contribution, we report {{for the first time}} the use of different continuous-flow microwave reactors for <b>polymerizations,</b> using the cationic ring-opening <b>polymerizations</b> of 2 -ethyl- 2 -oxazoline as a model system.

40|$|The {{model of}} the {{molecular}} weight distribution (MWD) of polypropylene produced in a loop reactor is established. The simulated MWD data of the polymers produced in steady-state <b>polymerizations</b> agree with the actual data collected from certain plant. The simulated weight-average molecular weight data also agree with the plant data in start-up processes. Furthermore, the model {{can be used to}} simulate the influence of the operation parameters on the MWD of the polymers produced in the steady-state <b>polymerizations</b> as well as the dynamic <b>polymerizations.</b> The simulated results of the steady state <b>polymerizations</b> show the MWD width of polypropylene decreases with the increase of both the propylene flow and the hydrogen flow, but increases with the increase of the catalyst flow. We also find the weight fraction of the polymers with short chains increases with the increase of both the propylene flow and the hydrogen flow, meanwhile, a small shift of the MWD curve to long chains can also be found as the catalyst flow increases. In the dynamic <b>polymerizations,</b> simulations indicate the MWD width and the weight fraction of the polymers with long chains all decrease in both of the start-up process and the end-up process of the <b>polymerizations...</b>|$|R

5|$|Many actin-related {{molecules}} {{create a}} free barbed end for <b>polymerization</b> by uncapping or severing pre-existing filaments and using these as actin nucleation cores. However, the Arp2/3 complex stimulates actin <b>polymerization</b> {{by creating a}} new nucleation core. Actin nucleation is an initial step {{in the formation of}} an actin filament. The nucleation core activity of Arp2/3 is activated by members of the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome family protein (WASP, N-WASP, WAVE, and WASH proteins). The V domain of a WASP protein interacts with actin monomers while the CA region associates with the Arp2/3 complex to create a nucleation core. However, de novo nucleation followed by <b>polymerization</b> is not sufficient to form integrated actin networks, since these newly synthesized polymers would not be associated with pre-existing filaments. Thus, the Arp2/3 complex binds to pre-existing filaments so that the new filaments can grow on the old ones and form a functional actin cytoskeleton. Capping proteins limit actin <b>polymerization</b> to the region activated by the Arp2/3 complex, and the elongated filament ends are recapped to prevent depolymerization and thus conserve the actin filament.|$|E
