There were a number of organizations in Germany that were particularly opposed to mass-produced identical headstones and by consequence the cemetery contains a number of differently styled headstones. The German headstones were carved from locally quarried stone, principally bluestone and Belgian <b>Petit</b> <b>Granit.</b> German officers were offered larger headstones to illustrate their higher military rank. The cemetery contains a number of German regimental memorials within the cemetery which were paid and provided by the city or town where the regiment was based.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Petit</b> <b>Granit</b> (also {{known by}} a variety of names including: Nero Belga, Granit de Flandre, Pierre Blue, Blue Stone, Belgian Granite, Belgian Blue Limestone, Arduin) is, despite its name, a grey-bluish limestone, rather than being a true Granite. It is mined {{exclusively}} in Belgium, where use of the name <b>Petit</b> <b>Granit</b> is subject to an Appellation dâ€™Origine Locale (Local Appellation of Origin) designation. [...] The stone becomes shiny black on polishing and is considered to be an easily worked and versatile dimension stone. It has also been used widely in sculpture and architecture, especially in Brussels and other Belgian cities.|$|E

5000|$|The {{entrance}} building contains toilets {{for visitors}} and a visiting {{room where the}} Cemetery Register is available on request. A plan of the plots within the cemetery is also on display. From here a small courtyard with a covered passage forms the connection to the Hall of Honour, which has at its centre, resting on a large block of stone, a bronze sculpture of a fallen warrior, by the eminent German sculptor, Professor Hans Wimmer. [...] Open passageways give {{a clear view of}} two terraces. On the west-facing terrace there is a granite monument to the crews of the four airships (SL 11, L32, L31, L48) shot down in World War I and who lie buried here in a tomb in separate sarcophagi.The other terrace forms a link between the Hall of Honour and the cemetery. The graves of the dead of the First and Second World War are generally separated and lie {{on either side of the}} gentle slopes of the cemetery with a valley between them. The burials are marked by headstones from Belgian <b>Petit</b> <b>Granit</b> and are usually inscribed for two individuals on the front and on the back.|$|E
