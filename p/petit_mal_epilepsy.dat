50|$|May {{was born}} the second of three {{children}} of Robert W. May and Katherine A. Armstrong on May 27, 1928 in St. Louis, Missouri. His father was a Presbyterian (who later converted to Catholicism), but May was raised a Catholic by his mother. He felt {{a call to the}} priesthood while in the fourth grade, and especially wanted to become a missionary to China. When old enough, he entered the seminary and was sent to study philosophy followed by theology at The Catholic University of America. He was tonsured and received the minor orders of porter and acolyte. However, in 1952, because of a serious medical condition (diagnosed as <b>petit</b> <b>mal</b> <b>epilepsy),</b> he took some time off from seminary studies to teach in DeAndreis High School in north St. Louis. After teaching for a year, he took his supposed epileptic condition as a sign from God that he should pursue another vocation. (Although he had been told that he had <b>petit</b> <b>mal</b> <b>epilepsy,</b> and took medication and suffered seizures at times, he discovered in the late 1970s that the problem was not epilepsy, but was psychological in nature, and he experienced no seizures after 1977). He married Patricia Ann Keck on October 4, 1958. Together they raised seven children and now have many grandchildren. Because of his educational foundation, he found work as a book editor with various publishers from 1954 to 1970, until his teaching career began in 1971.|$|E

Ethosuximide reduced LTCC without altering the voltage dependence of steady-state inactivation or the time course of recovery from inactivation.

40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} the phytochemical properties and the anticonvulsant {{potential of the}} ethyl acetate soluble fraction of ethanol leaf extract of Globimetula braunii, a plant used in ethnomedicine {{for the treatment of}} epilepsy. Methods: The phytochemical screening was carried out using standard protocol while the anticonvulsant activity was studied using maximal electroshock test in chicks, pentylenetetrazole and 4 -aminopyridine-induced seizures in mice. Results: The preliminary phytochemical screening carried out on the crude ethanol extract revealed the presence of saponins, carbohydrates, flavonoids, tannins, anthraquinones and steroids. Similarly, tannins, flavonoids and steroids/terpenes were found to be present in the ethyl acetate fraction. In the pharmacological screening, 150 mg/kg of the fraction protected 83. 33 % of animals against pentylenetetrazole-induced seizure in mice whereas sodium valproate a standard anti-epileptic drug offered 100 % protection. In the 4 -aminopyridine-induced seizure model, the fraction produced a significant (P< 0. 05) increase in the mean onset of seizure in unprotected animals. The fraction did not exhibit a significant activity against maximal electroshock convulsion. The median lethal dose of the fraction was found to be 1261. 91 mg/kg.

40|$|In {{the general}} {{introductory}} {{part of this}} thesis (Chapters and 2) a review of some pertinent literature related to sleep-waking states and opioid peptides is offered. A global view of the neurochemical mechanisms and theories of functions of sleep, {{as well as the}} physiological and possible clinical consequences of total or selective REM sleep deprivation is given in Chapter 1. In Chapter 2, which is concerned with the role of endogenous opioid peptides, particular attention is paid to the possible modulatory role of endogenously released opioid peptides in the regulation of some behavioural states in physiological and pathological conditions. It is generally known that exogenously administered opiates and opioid peptides can alter sleep pattern and decrease REM sleep. A possible interaction between sleep-waking states and endogenous opioid system is suggested by the report that the episodic release of plasma humoral endorphins during sleep is associated with the REM sleep phase (Chapter 1, section 1. 1. 7). In addition, the concentrations of opioid peptides in some brain nuclei of the rat which are known to be important in sleep-waking regulation, are highest in the dark (active) phase, during which wakefulness is high and lowest in the light (rest) phase, when the propensity to sleep is at its highest (Chapter section 1. 3. 2). Thus in order to clarify the effect of endogenously released opioid peptides in the regulation of sleep-waking pattern, we studied the effects of phosphoramidon, an inhibitor of enkephalinase A on sleep-waking states (Chapter 3). Several clinical studies suggest that the sleep-waking cycle may modulate the occurence of some types of epileptic phenomena in human subjects (Chapter 1, section 1. 5. 2, iii). In addition, some studies indicate a similarity between enkephalin induced epileptic Therefore, phenomena and we studied <b>petit</b> the <b>mal</b> <b>epilepsy</b> effects of (Chapter 4 discussion). different sleep stages on enkephalin-induced epileptic phenomena using electrophysiological parameters (Chapter 4). These initial studies (Chapters 3 and 4) suggested an interaction between sleep-waking states and endogenous opioid system. The observation that REM sleep deprivation (REMSD) reduced the pain threshold to noxious electrical stimulation (Chapter 1 section 1. 5. 2 d i) was an indication of the importance of REM sleep in the regulation of nociception. Therefore in Chapters 5 and 6, the experiments were designed to explore a direct effect of REMSD on the analgesic effects of morphine, an enkephalinase inhibitor phosphoramdion and cold-water-swim. The profound antagonistic effect of REMSD on opiate/opioid peptide induced analgesia stimulated further interest to investigate the relationship between REMSD and other opiate/opioid peptide modulated behavioural phenomena. Therefore the following opioid modulated behaviours were investigated: akinetic-cataleptic syndrome, spontaneous vertical motor activity, convulsions, (Chapters 7 - 9). (Chapter 10) grooming, wet-dog-shakes and morphine withdrawal symptoms Additional experiments with nitrous oxide were performed since it is known that this anaesthetic agent can stimulate the release of endogenous enkephalins and induce opiate-like withdrawal symptoms (Chapter 2, section 2. 5. 2, iv). Finally, the possible clinical consequences of our findings are described in the relevant chapters...|$|R
