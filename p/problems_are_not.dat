25|$|Some neuroethics <b>problems</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> {{fundamentally}} different from those encountered in bioethics. Others are unique to neuroethics because the brain, as the organ of the mind, has implications for broader philosophical problems, such as the nature of free will, moral responsibility, self-deception, and personal identity. Examples of neuroethics topics are given later in this article ("Key issues in neuroethics").|$|E

25|$|Many {{transgender}} and transsexual activists, {{and many}} caregivers, {{note that these}} <b>problems</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> usually related to the gender identity issues themselves, but {{the social and cultural}} responses to gender-variant individuals. Some transsexual people reject the counseling that is recommended by the Standards of Care because they do not consider their gender identity to be a cause of psychological problems.|$|E
25|$|However, {{these public}} {{reactions}} {{have been criticized}} for embodying white feminism because they do not take into account intersectionality and the increased obstacles that women of color face.

25|$|The {{military}} cannot {{continue to}} be an organization with unmatched institutional reach and political influence, while limiting state capacity, because in doing {{so it will be}} evermore challenging for civilian supremacy to take a stance, thus establishing effective civil-military relations. If these <b>problems</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> addressed properly, as long as civil-military relations of countries continue to interact within undefined boundaries, without clear subordination and authority and with the constrictions of limited budgets, it is unlikely that countries that still struggle with the concept will achieve a stable and efficient civil-military relationship, something that will continue to damage state capacity and stability.|$|E

25|$|While still {{considered}} one of the most polluted places on the planet, the valley's air pollution <b>problems</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> as bad as they were several decades ago. One major problem that was brought under control was the lead contamination in the air with the introduction of unleaded gasoline. Two other contaminants that have been brought under control are carbon monoxide and sulfur dioxide. The contamination problems that remain are primarily with ozone and fine particles (soot) (between 2.5micrometers and 10micrometers). Thirty to fifty percent of the time, Mexico City's levels of fine particles of ten micrometers, the most dangerous, exceed levels recommended by the World Health Organization.|$|E
25|$|Roquentin's {{difficulties}} as {{arising from}} man's inherent existential condition. His seemingly special circumstances (returning from travel, reclusiveness), which {{goes beyond the}} mere indication of his very real depression, are supposed to induce in him (and in the reader) a state that makes one more receptive to noticing an existential situation that everyone has, but may not be sensitive enough to let become noticeable. Roquentin undergoes a strange metaphysical experience that estranges him from the world. His <b>problems</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> merely a result of personal insanity, without larger significance. Rather, like {{the characters in the}} Dostoevsky and Rilke novels, they are victims of larger ideological, social, and existential forces that have brought them to the brink of insanity. Sartre's point in Nausea is to comment on our universal reaction to these common external problems.|$|E
25|$|The city {{suffers from}} traffic {{problems}} {{largely due to}} this radial street pattern, {{making it difficult for}} Romans to move easily from the vicinity of one of the radial roads to another without going into the historic centre or using the ring-road. These <b>problems</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> helped by the limited size of Rome's metro system when compared to other cities of similar size. In addition, Rome has only 21 taxis for every 10,000 inhabitants, far below other major European cities. Chronic congestion caused by cars during the 1970s and 1980s led to restrictions being placed on vehicle access to the inner city-centre during the hours of daylight. Areas where these restriction apply are known as Limited Traffic Zones (Zona a Traffico Limitato (ZTL) in Italian). More recently, heavy night-time traffic in Trastevere, Testaccio and San Lorenzo has {{led to the creation of}} night-time ZTLs in those districts.|$|E

25|$|In late October 1967, Scorpion started {{refresher}} training and weapons system acceptance tests, {{and was given}} a new commanding officer, Francis Slattery. Following type training out of Norfolk, Virginia, she got underway on 15 February 1968 for a Mediterranean Sea deployment. She operated with the 6th Fleet into May and then headed west for home. Scorpion suffered several mechanical malfunctions, including a chronic problem with Freon leakage from refrigeration systems. An electrical fire occurred in an escape trunk when a water leak shorted out a shore power connection. (However, major steam and leakage <b>problems</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> uncommon on U.S. Navy or Royal Navy submarine deployments, even in the 21st Century.) There {{is no evidence that}} the Scorpions speed was restricted in May 1968, although it was conservatively observing a depth limitation of 500 feet, due to the incomplete implementation of planned post-Thresher safety checks and modifications.|$|E
500|$|Gameplanet {{criticized the}} game's poor support for online multiplayer, {{saying it was}} [...] "unstable and quite frustrating." [...] FiringSquad felt {{that the lack of}} {{communication}} between players in combat during online games was problematic, but that Local Area Network play would be more satisfying. PC Zone said that multiplayer was as unimpressive as {{it had been in the}} first game in the series and said the game needed multiplayer maps. IGN, however, felt that multiplayer play was solidly implemented and fun. Criticism was also directed at bugs in the game, such as frequent crashes when trying to access certain locations. According to GameSpy, Baldur's Gate II is [...] "not 100% stable." [...] GameSpot noted that the game's loading times were somewhat long and that the game crashed on occasion, but said that these <b>problems</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> significant. IGN, though noting that the game slowed down during combat when a lot of animations were happening simultaneously due to spells or [...] "dazzling backgrounds", said that there were almost no other technical problems. GameSpot also felt that the small number of character portraits to choose from was a disappointment and was displeased that the game reused special effects, audio, and graphics from the first game.|$|E
500|$|As {{the first}} fully 3D {{platforming}} game starring Sega's mascot, Sonic the Hedgehog, Sonic Team's Sonic Adventure was considered [...] "the {{centerpiece of the}} [...] launch". Adventure garnered criticism for technical problems including erratic camera angles and glitches, but was praised for its [...] "luscious" [...] visuals, [...] "vast, twisting environments" [...] and iconic set pieces —including a segment in which Sonic runs {{down the side of}} a skyscraper —and has been described as the Sonic series' creative apex. However, it failed [...] "to catch on with players in nearly the way that [...] Mario 64 had done", perhaps due to a perceived lack of gameplay depth. Distinguished by its innovative use of multiple storylines with varied forms of play,s levels, these are forgiveable–but somehow the smaller <b>problems</b> <b>are</b> <b>not...</b> The camera's occasional visits behind walls do little to aid the case for forgiveness, either, although it never frustrates to the extent that Banjo-Kazooie does... a wonderfully absorbing game experience.}} Adventure sold 2.5 million copies, making it the Dreamcast's best-selling title. Sonic Team also developed the Dreamcast's first online game—ChuChu Rocket!—which was widely complimented for its addictive puzzle gameplay and [...] "frantic" [...] multiplayer matches, and the critically successful music game Samba de Amigo, which was noted for its expensive maracas peripheral and colorful aesthetic. Perhaps the most influential of Sonic Team's Dreamcast releases was Phantasy Star Online, the first online console RPG. Developed after Okawa requested an online game from Sonic Team, PSO was heavily influenced by the PC action RPG Diablo, but refined and simplified its style of gameplay to appeal to console audiences.|$|E

According to Lukoff and Lu, co-authors of the category, religious or spiritual <b>problems</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> classified as mental disorders. Foulks also notes that the new diagnosis is included in the DSM-IV-TR nonillness category (Other Conditions That May Be a Focus of Clinical Attention).|$|E
