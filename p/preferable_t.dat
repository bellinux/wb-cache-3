40|$|Using machine {{learning}} has proven effective at {{choosing the right}} set of optimizations for a particular program. For {{machine learning}} techniques to be most effective, compiler writers have to develop expressive means of characterizing the program being optimized. The current state-of-the-art techniques for characterizing programs include using a fixed-length feature vector of either source code features extracted during compile time or performance counters collected when running the program. For the problem of identifying optimizations to apply, models constructed using performance counter characterizations of a program {{have been shown to}} outperform models constructed using source code features. However, collecting performance counters requires running the program multiple times, and this “dynamic ” method of characterizing programs can be specific to inputs of the program.

40|$|The {{link between}} {{regulation}} and efficient price structures has been recognised in general, {{though it has}} been little analysed {{in the context of}} busy airports. When demand for an airport’s services exceeds its capacity, an allocation problem develops. This may be resolved inefficiently, through congestion, or more efficiently through slot allocation mechanisms or auctions. Slot allocation issues are discussed extensively- while they are very important, the equally important issue of price structures has been relatively ignored. Many countries are privatising their airports, and subjecting them to regulation. However, the issue of how regulation will affect the allocation of capacity is rarely explored. Price regulation constrains the overall levels of prices an airport may charge. Thus, it may not be feasible to rely entirely on prices to ration capacity efficiently. However, the structure of prices will impact on capacity allocation; for example, structures which include higher prices at peaks may perform more efficiently than others. Likewise, when runway capacity is at a premium, uniform prices for all flights at a point of time will be <b>preferable</b> <b>t...</b>|$|E
40|$|Using 281 pb− 1 of data {{collected}} at the ψ(3770) resonance at the CLEO-c de-tector, we measure the purely leptonic decay of the D+ meson using the channel D+ → µ+νµ. We use a method which {{takes advantage of the}} intrinsic hermetic-ity of the CLEO-c detector in order to reconstruct the missing momentum and energy, which is then interpreted as the signal neutrino. The resolution of the missing energy is improved by fully reconstructing the hadronically decaying D meson as a combination of pi±,K±, KS → pi+pi−, pi 0 → γγ and η → γγ. Low en-ergy showers which cannot be associated with pi 0 → γγ or η → γγ are rejected. By replacing the signal leptonic decay channel with a well measured D+ hadronic decay such as D+ → K−pi+pi+ and requiring the missing energy to be small, we can use the same generic reconstruction technique to measure systematic errors that may affect the overall efficiency of the leptonic analysis. In order to reduce our systematic errors, we scale our leptonic yields by the D+ → K−pi+pi+ yield and find the branching fraction in terms of the D+ → K−pi+pi+ branching fraction. We find B(D+ → µ+νµ) = (3. 90 ± 0. 55 stat ± 0. 13 syst) × 10 − 4 for the branching fraction of the process, from which we extract fD+ = (209. 7 ± 14. 6 stat ± 3. 5 syst) MeV. BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH Daniel Hertz was born in Evanston, IL in 1978 and moved to Denmark in August of 1980, where {{he spent most of his}} youth. He attended primary and secondary education at Danish schools and is thus both fluent in the Danish language and knowledgeable about important historical events such as the collectivization move-ment of Danish agriculture in the 19 th century. During his secondary school years he delivered newspapers every morning before school, preparing him for later cur-mudgeonhood by giving him excellent source material for stories beginning with the phrase “when I was your age [...] . ” He decided that going to an English-speaking university would be <b>preferable</b> <b>t...</b>|$|E
40|$|Fumaric {{acid esters}} (FAE) {{have been used}} for the {{systemic}} treatment of psoriasis in Germany for almost 50 years. Recently, {{it has been shown that}} dimethylfumarate (DMF) as the main ingredient of the marketed FAE mixture is a potent inhibitor of the nuclear transcription factor NF-κB. DMF was also shown to induce apoptosis in various cells. Because T cells play a crucial role in psoriasis pathogenesis, we asked whether DMF and its main metabolite methylhydrogenfumarate (MHF) were able to induce apoptosis in these cells. Purified human T cells were treated with DMF and MHF (1 – 20 μg/mL) and stimulated with interleukin 2, anti-CD 3 antibodies or both for 48 h, and apoptosis was subsequently determined by the expression of Apo 2. 7 as well as by terminal deoxynucleotide transferase nick end labeling. The expression of antiapoptotic protein Bcl- 2 was simultaneously determined. The results showed a dose-and-time dependent up-regulation of Apo 2. 7 expression and DNA fragmentation by DMF <b>preferable</b> in stimulated <b>T</b> cells. MHF and the solvent dimethyl sulfoxide were without effect. DMF, but not MHF, led to a concentration-dependent decrease of Bcl- 2 expression in interleukin- 2 -stimulated T cells. The data provide evidence that the effect of FAE treatment of psoriasis may at least in part be due to induction of apoptosis in activated T cells...|$|R
40|$|Background Women {{who have}} had gestational {{diabetes}} mellitus (GDM) {{are at increased risk}} of type 2 diabetes (T 2 DM), and are recommended to have T 2 DM screening in the postpartum period, although this screening is often not undertaken. This thesis examines how postpartum care for women with GDM may be improved. Methods Two systematic reviews of qualitative/survey studies examine: (1) Clinicians’ views and knowledge relating to provision of healthcare in the postpartum period for GDM. (2) Women’s views and knowledge relating to healthcare seeking after GDM. A randomised controlled trial and two nested studies assess: (1) Postpartum SMS reminders to women who have experienced GDM to test for T 2 DM: The DIAMIND Trial (2) Predictors of postpartum diabetes screening in the DIAMIND Trial (3) Barriers and facilitators to postpartum diabetes testing. Results The systematic review on clinician’s views included 13 studies (4435 clinicians). Key themes included adequacy of knowledge of risk of T 2 DM, and differing perceptions of the value of postpartum screening. Women faced obstacles to accessing healthcare, and a need for improved GDM education. Studies reported shortfalls in systems to ensure communication of the GDM diagnosis and postpartum screening. The systematic review on women’s views included 42 studies (7949 women). Non-judgemental, well-coordinated care was <b>preferable.</b> Perception of <b>T</b> 2 DM risk increased with time from their GDM diagnosis, family history of T 2 DM and other risk factors for GDM. Children’s needs took priority over their own healthcare. A need for a more pro-active approach to postpartum care was identified. The DIAMIND Trial found that SMS reminders did not increase attendance for an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) within six months postpartum, with 104 (77. 6 % of 134) women attending in the six week group and 103 (76. 8 % of 134) women attending in the control group (RR 1. 01, 95 % CI 0. 89 - 1. 15). Women were more likely to complete OGTTs if they were of Asian ethnicity (P = 0. 007), had a bachelor’s degree (P = 0. 036), and if they did not smoke prior to pregnancy (P = 0. 045). Women were less likely to attend if they had gained excessive weight during their pregnancy (P = 0. 004) or were Caucasian (P = 0. 001). 208 women (75 %) returned their questionnaires. Preferred reminder types were SMS (67 %), email (17 %), postal (12 %) and voice call (1 %). Common barriers to postpartum glucose testing included: not having enough time (73 %), inadequate or non-availability of childcare (30 %), and a need to focus on the health of the baby (30 %). The most common facilitator for postpartum testing was having a shorter test (33 %). Conclusions Postpartum care for women with GDM could be improved through systematic communication of the diagnosis, clear responsibilities for postpartum care, better GDM education and minimisation of healthcare cost barriers. Non-judgemental, holistic and pro-active care is preferable. An OGTT postpartum attendance “ceiling effect” may explain the non-increase in attendance in the six week SMS reminder group. Lack of time and caring responsibilities were barriers to OGTT completion. Further research is needed on reasons for postpartum non-attendance to facilitate diabetes detection and prevention.
