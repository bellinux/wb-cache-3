50|$|Asco {{offers a}} range of {{extremely}} rich and varied landscapes of bare rocky mountains in the Gorges of Asco, almost impenetrable scrub above the gorges, and dry and arid with a forest of <b>prickly</b> <b>juniper</b> {{in the vicinity of}} the village with thick forests of black pine above the village. Below the ridge lines thick and aromatic Alder bushes grow called u bassu in Corsican: an endemic shrub without a trunk. The remarkable Asco communal forest that covers the upper valley includes the Forest of Vecchietto and the Forest of Carrozzica, which are larger and higher, but both on the Asco slopes. These landscapes are similar to high alpine valleys. The presence of a ski resort (now closed) only reinforces the illusion.|$|E
50|$|The {{climate is}} mediterranean, having hot summers and {{generally}} warm to cool, dry winters. The park {{falls within the}} Illyrian deciduous forests terrestrial ecoregion of the Palearctic Temperate broadleaf and mixed forest up to 600 m above the sea level. The flora of the park is diverse and is characterized with high endemism due to the combination of southern geographic latitude and high altitude variation. The forests are host to several plants such as Bosnian pine, Black pine, Bulgarian fir, Silver fir, ash trees, kermes oak, tree heather, <b>prickly</b> <b>juniper,</b> common box, spurge laurel, spindle, european yew and so on.The vertebrate fauna of the national park consists of large number of species. Among the species of highest conservation value are Griffon vulture, Golden eagle, Rock partridge, Fallow deer, Roe deer, European wildcat, Chamois, Red squirrel, Eurasian otter, European otter, Stone marten, Wolf and the Red fox.|$|E
50|$|The Turian-Chay State Reserve was {{established}} for the protection and restoration of arid-arch light forest and other natural resources; and for the localization of centers of erosion at the foothills. The reserve is situated on the spurs of the Buz-Dag Ridge, in the southern foothills of the Major Caucasus, on the right bank of the River Turian-Chay in the Agdash area of the Republic. Its territory lies at a height of 400-650 m above sea level and extends for 35 km {{from east to west}} and for 5 km from north to south. The reserve is situated in an area of semi-desert and arid light forests, which mainly consist of pistachio, juniper, oak, having an important soil protecting, water protecting and climatic significance. In the relief of the reserve lowland mountains dominate with the peaks: Pirsei-Dag (609 m), Nulbon-Dag (437 m), Archan-Dag (476 m), Olmes-Dag (544 m) and others. As a rule they have steep, in some places denudated eroded slopes, and are separated by deep narrow valleys. The northern slopes are more gentle and covered with forests; the southern slopes are steep and strongly eroded. The general process of wind erosion has developed on the territory of the reserve. On the territory of the reserve 60 species of trees and bushes grow. The main types of sparsely growing trees are: Pistacia, fudian juniper (Juniper polucarpus), <b>prickly</b> <b>juniper</b> (Juniperus oxicedrus), Quercus Iberica, ash-tree, Celtis caucasicus and pomedranate. Moreover, Quercus Iberica, Populus, willow, alder, Elaeagnus and other trees also grow in this area. Two dendraflora species of the reserve - Juniperus and pomegranate are included in the Red Book. There are 24 species of mammals and 112 species of birds, 20 species of reptiles and 3 species of amphibians in the reserve. Among the birds there are partridge (Alectoris kakelik), Columbi formes, Cercheneis tinnunculus, griffon (Gyps fulvus), black vulture (Aegypius monachus) and others. Among mammals there are wild boar, brown bear, badger, stone marten, lynx, jackal, European wild cat, hare and others. Among reptiles there are: Coluber jugularis and Vipera lebetina. Along the former river- beds and channels the Caspian turtle can be found, and on the slopes of the mountain the Mediterranean turtle can be observed, which, as well as the Coluber caucasicus, is included in the Red Book. The main protected objects are the model natural complexes of the Boz-Dag Ridge with the developed pistachio-arch light forests, area of semi-desert, arid and tugay vegetation. The state of arid light forest on the Boz-Dag are of great concern primary primarily because in spite of the productivity of the majority of tree species, including juniper, the regeneration of these forests in general is very slow. The establishment of the Turian-Chay reserve brought -an improvement in the situation with the regeneration of these forests. During the 40 years of the reserve’s existence the pistachio-juniper light forest has extended its area and the general quality of trees has increased. The replacement of juniper by pistachio has almost stopped. Shrubbery and herbage lave also developed well, considerably reducing the process of soil erosion.|$|E
40|$|Premise of the study: Pollination drops are a {{formative}} {{component in}} gymnosperm pollen-ovule interactions. Proteomics offers a direct method for {{the discovery of}} proteins associated with this early stage of sexual reproduction. Methods: Pollination drops were sampled from eight gymnosperm species: Chamaecyparis lawsoniana (Port Orford cedar), Ephedra monosperma, Ginkgo biloba, Juniperus oxycedrus (<b>prickly</b> <b>juniper),</b> Larix × marschlinsii, Pseudotsuga menziesii (Douglas-fir), Taxus × media, and Welwitschia mirabilis. Drops were collected by micropipette using techniques focused on preventing sample contamination. Drop proteins were separated using both gel and gel-free methods. Tandem mass spectrometric methods were used including a triple quadrupole and an Orbitrap. Results: Proteins are present in all pollination drops. Consistency in the protein complement over time was shown in L. × marschlinsii. Representative mass spectra from W. mirabilis chitinase peptide and E. monosperma serine carboxypeptidase peptide demonstrated high quality results. We provide a summary of gymnosperm pollination drop proteins that have been discovered to date via proteomics. Discussion: Using proteomic methods, a dozen classes of proteins have been identified to date. Proteomics presents a way forward in deepening {{our understanding of the}} biological function of pollination drops...|$|E
40|$|The {{pollination}} droplet is {{a highly}} conservative pollination mechanism that is observed in all major gymnosperm taxa. Proteomics analysis of the pollination drops was carried out on four gymnosperm species: Juniperus communis (common juniper), Juniperus oxycedrus (<b>prickly</b> <b>juniper),</b> Chamaecyparis lawsoniana (Port Orford cedar), and Welwitschia mirabilis. Pollination drop proteins were purified by SDS-PAGE, and the most abundant proteins were analyzed by mass spectrometry and sequenced. Based on BLAST searching of combined amino acid sequences, the following proteins were identified in the following species: an 83 -kDa subtilisin-like proteinase, a 62 -kDa glycosyl hydrolase, a 47. 5 -kDa glucan 1, 3 -b-glucosidase precursor, a 30 -kDa chitinase, and a 25 -kDa thaumatin-like protein were identified in J. communis; a 30 -kDa chitinase, a 25 -kDa thaumatin-like protein, and a 32. 5 -kDa glucanase-like protein were identified in J. oxycedrus; an 83 -kDa subtilisin-like proteinase, a 62 -kDa b-D-glucan exohydrolase, a 47. 5 -kDa glucan 1, 3 -b-glucosidase, and two 25 -kDa thaumatin-like proteins were identified in C. lawsoniana, and a 25 -kDa chitinase was identified in W. mirabilis. Based on protein identifications, there is strong evidence that the pollination drop functions in both pathogen defense and pollen development. The discovery of similarities in terms of peptide sequence and protein identifications indicates that ovular secretions are functionally conservative, {{and that they are}} essential to reproductive success...|$|E
40|$|The {{current study}} {{highlights}} the distribution pattern of juniper dwarf mistletoe (Arceuthobium oxycedri), a semi-parasite of the Eastern <b>prickly</b> <b>juniper</b> (Juniperus deltoides), in Crimea. A. oxycedri has considerably narrower range in Crimea {{as compared to}} its principal host and its ubiquitous distribution is rather sporadic. Nature observations characterize A. oxycedri as a thermophilic and mezo-хerophytic species confined to the low-mountain terrains with mild sub-Mediterranean climate. Significant sites of permanent infection have been discovered at the Crimean coast and in the warmest southwestern part of the Crimean Mountains to the south from the Belbek River valley. Greek juniper (J. excelsa) is a codominant species growing {{side by side with}} J. deltoids in the majority of localities examined that have the high infection rate. Generally, J. excelsa is an insusceptible species in relation to the parasite; nevertheless, it is affected by A. oxycedri at several sites. Birds feeding habit to consume J. excelsa and J. deltoides fleshy berry-like cones helps to maintain the high infection rate and to disseminate mistletoe seeds at the distance of approximately 4 km. Modeling ecological niche and creating maps of potential range of the parasite and its principal host using MaxEnt 3. 3. 3 k software have demonstrated that A. oxycedri distribution in Crimea at present may be wider than it has been currently observed. It is noteworthy that while modeling such bioclimatic indicators as the minimum winter temperatures and the elevation above sea level were irrelevant for establishing the distribution range of the parasite. Presumably the limited distribution of A. oxycedri {{can be attributed to the}} history of forming J. deltoides range in the late Pleistocene – Holocene, alongside with a low speed of the parasite dissemination from Quaternary refugia in the southernmost part of the Crimean Peninsula...|$|E
