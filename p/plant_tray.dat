40|$|Abstract Background Improvements in {{high-throughput}} phenotyping {{technologies are}} rapidly expanding {{the scope and}} capacity of plant biology studies to measure growth traits. Nevertheless, the costs of commercial phenotyping equipment and infrastructure remain prohibitively expensive for wide-scale uptake, while academic solutions can require significant local expertise. Here we present a low-cost methodology for plant biologists {{to build their own}} phenotyping system for quantifying growth rates and phenotypic characteristics of Arabidopsis thaliana rosettes throughout the diel cycle. Results We constructed an image capture system consisting of a near infra-red (NIR, 940  nm) LED panel with a mounted Raspberry Pi NoIR camera and developed a MatLab-based software module (iDIEL Plant) to characterise rosette expansion. Our software was able to accurately segment and characterise multiple rosettes within an image, regardless of plant arrangement or genotype, and batch process image sets. To further validate our system, wild-type Arabidopsis plants (Col- 0) and two mutant lines with reduced Rubisco contents, pale leaves and slow growth phenotypes (1 a 3 b and 1 a 2 b) were grown on a single <b>plant</b> <b>tray.</b> Plants were imaged from 9 to 24  days after germination every 20  min throughout the 24  h light–dark growth cycle (i. e. the diel cycle). The resulting dataset provided a dynamic and uninterrupted characterisation of differences in rosette growth and expansion rates over time for the three lines tested. Conclusion Our methodology offers a straightforward solution for setting up automated, scalable and low-cost phenotyping facilities {{in a wide range of}} lab environments that could greatly increase the processing power and scalability of Arabidopsis soil growth experiments...|$|E
40|$|Due to the {{potential}} impact of conventional chemical pesticides on human health and on the environment, governments worldwide are developing policies to reduce the use of these pesticides. Instruments like the EU directive 91 / 414 /EEC, have resulted in the withdrawal of many active ingredients from the market. Furthermore, the new EU directive 2009 / 128 /EC on the sustainable use of pesticides states that non-chemical methods should be given priority wherever possible. To improve the sustainability of agriculture and to avoid resistance development against the receding number of active ingredients remaining on the market, biological alternatives for conventional chemical pesticides are much sought after and even urgently needed. Entomopathogenic nematodes (EPN) are one of those alternatives. They are used for the biological control of an increasing number of insect pests. These bio-insecticides are exceptionally safe for farmers, farm workers, for consumers and for the environment. However, they may have lower efficacy than conventional chemical pesticides. Nonetheless, EPN are equivalent to or even better than conventional chemical insecticides in controlling a number of commercially important pests (e. g., against black vine weevil, citrus root weevil, cranberry girdler, hunting billbug and western corn rootworm). Poor efficacy against other pests can be the result of inappropriate application methods, the use of poor quality products or suboptimal application conditions. This work focused on optimizing the application of EPN in field vegetables. The general aim of this work was to test and, where possible, to improve the control potential of EPN against three difficult to reach pests, described in detail in chapter 1, viz. : the leaf-bound cabbage moth (Mamestra brassicae) in cauliflower, the soil-bound cabbage root fly (Delia radicum) in cauliflower and the cryptic onion thrips (Thrips tabaci) in leek. Depending on the target pest, the experiments described in chapters 2 to 5 examined the effect of (1) adding adjuvants to the spray suspension, (2) altering the application rate of the EPN and (3) adapting the application technique and/or (4) the timing of the application(s). Chapter 2 focused on improving the formulation and application of EPN on leaves using laboratory tests with special attention to one specific pest: the cabbage moth. Suitable adjuvants for EPN spray applications were selected based on the absence of toxic or immobilizing effects on two EPN species: Steinernema feltiae and S. carpocapsae. The selected humectants and dispersants were further screened for their effects on the sedimentation of these EPN species in a tank suspension. Next, the effect of three suitable surfactants and a humectant and the effect of nozzle size on the deposition of S. carpocapsae on hydrophobic cauliflower leaves was investigated. Subsequently, a laboratory experiment verified whether brewer’s yeast extract can be used as an attractant for the cabbage moth larvae, and whether it improves the mortality caused by EPN to cabbage moth larvae. Finally, the effect of the most suitable surfactant and humectant, selected from the deposition test, on the longevity and on the infectivity of S. carpocapsae, is presented. These experiments have shown that all selected alcohol ethoxylates (Synperonic 91 / 5, Synperonic 91 / 6, Synperonic 10 / 6 and Atplus 245) and the selected alkylpolysaccharide (AL- 2575) immobilized both S. carpocapsae and S. feltiae when mixed in the spray suspension. Xanthan gum remains the best sedimentation-retarding agent. An ISO 02 standard flat fan nozzle can clog when spraying S. carpocapsae. An ISO 04 standard flat fan nozzle provides a higher relative deposition of different S. carpocapsae-adjuvant suspensions on cauliflower leaves than the bigger ISO 08 standard flat fan nozzle. Three spreading agents (Silwet L- 77, SB Plant Invigorator and Addit) roughly doubled the relative EPN deposition with both the ISO 04 and the ISO 08 nozzle when added to the EPN suspension. Addition of xanthan gum did not significantly increase deposition any further. Addition of yeast extract to a foliar spray containing S. carpocapsae significantly increased mortality of the cabbage moth and decreased the amount of leaf damage caused by these caterpillars. And finally, it was shown that adding Addit and xanthan gum to a spray suspension containing S. carpocapsae prolongs the survival of EPN on leaves, and that these adjuvants can cause mortality in larvae of Galleria mellonella. It was however deemed unlikely, and proven in a field test (chapter 3), that Addit and xanthan gum at the used concentrations, would {{have a significant effect on}} insect plagues in field conditions. The field experiments described in chapter 3 implemented the results of chapter 2 and aimed to optimize the control of cabbage moth with S. carpocapsae. A spray application tools test, was performed to select a spray application technique that leads to a maximum of spray coverage on specific parts of the cauliflower plant. The targeted spraying areas were: (1) the central part of the plant, where the cabbage moth larvae can cause direct economic damage to the cauliflower head, and (2) the underside of the leaves, where the young larvae hide during the day and feed during the night. The test showed that two spray boom configurations with vertical extensions in the crop covered the lower side of the outer leaves very well, while also securing statistically equal coverage of the underside of the centre leaves, when compared to all other configurations. Therefore, one of these configurations, a spray boom configuration with TeeJet TP 80 04 EVS nozzles mounted on the horizontal spray boom and TeeJet UB 85 04 nozzles mounted 38 cm long vertical extensions, was selected for the field trial with S. carpocapsae. An adjuvant trial, determined whether S. carpocapsae, applied in the field with this technique, could effectively reduce the cabbage moth numbers in a cauliflower crop and/or the damage to this crop. It also tested if these parameters could be further reduced by adding yeast extract and/or Addit and xanthan gum to the tank suspension. An application rate trial and an application technique trial, were set up (1) to test the effect of different application rates of EPN on cabbage moth control and (2) to confirm if the application technique selected in the spray application tools test was indeed better suited than a standard broadcast spray application, for controlling the cabbage moth. In the adjuvant trial, the numbers of damaged cabbage heads clearly demonstrate a protective effect of spraying with a suspension of S. carpocapsae, when combined with Addit and xanthan gum. It was noticeable that Bt applications outperformed all other treatments, although the difference was not always significant. Based on these results, EPN might provide an extra control option against the cabbage moth, if the efficacy of EPN treatments can be further enhanced. Similar to the adjuvant trial, the numbers of cabbage moth larvae were highly variable between individual plants in both the application rate trial and the application technique trial, making it difficult to distinguish statistical differences between the mean number of caterpillars per plant. However, leaf damage measurements and the number of infected plants proved to be much less variable and thus much more reliable than counting numbers of caterpillars for assessing control by S. carpocapsae and Bt treatments in both trials. Only the Bt applications with the adapted spray boom effectively stopped damage development caused by the cabbage moth. Furthermore, the plots that received Bt with the adapted spray boom were the only plots that contained significantly less infected plants than the control plots. The protection against sunlight on the underside of leaves, together with better placement of the Bt spray may explain the better control of the Bt applications with the adapted spray boom compared with the regular spray boom. This chapter shows that there is much room for improvement in the foliar application of EPN against cabbage moth. Control results were probably largely dependent on the temperature. More cold-tolerant species, strains or breeding products of EPN should be searched for, so that they can be used against the cabbage moth, before any conclusions can be drawn on the optimal application rate of the EPN. The deposition measurements in all trials suffered from high variability. This was most probably caused by the plant architecture of cauliflower: due to the overlap of leaves, some areas of the plant are difficult to spray. This variability is a major concern for biocontrol agents like Bt and EPN, since areas that are not sprayed, are not protected against the targeted pest. When a low temperature active EPN species/strain/breeding product, efficacious against the cabbage moth, becomes available, then EPN applications might be fitted into biological control schemes to prevent development of resistance of cabbage moth against Bt. This is of major importance, since cabbage moth already seems to possess some innate resistance against Bt products. Chapter 4 presents three field tests with applications of IJ of S. feltiae against cabbage root fly in cauliflower. These tests focused on finding an optimal application rate (200, 000 IJ/plant vs. 50, 000 IJ/plant), a suitable application technique (<b>plant</b> <b>tray</b> spraying vs. drench application) and a good timing of the application (application at planting vs. application one week after planting vs. application two weeks after planting, with or without one or two follow-up treatment(s)). The results demonstrated that a <b>plant</b> <b>tray</b> spray with S. feltiae is superior to a drench application in controlling cabbage root fly in cauliflower. <b>Plant</b> <b>tray</b> sprayings with S. feltiae can reduce the percentage of dead plants compared with the non-treated control. The lack of an application rate-effect relationship suggests that it might be possible to further reduce the applied rate of S. feltiae without causing a significant reduction in control. Numbers of cabbage maggots around the plant roots can be temporarily reduced by <b>plant</b> <b>tray</b> sprays with a rate of 200, 000 IJ S. feltiae per cauliflower plant. Mortality results of bait tests with wax moth larvae on soil samples taken from around the cauliflower plants, showed that IJ of S. feltiae, applied as a <b>plant</b> <b>tray</b> spray, take one to two weeks to spread into the soil around the roots of cauliflower. These bait tests also showed that the most effective period of IJ of S. feltiae in the soil is limited up to five weeks, which warrants a follow-up treatment. Further research should examine whether the application rate of IJ of S. feltiae in a <b>plant</b> <b>tray</b> spray can be lowered, while maintaining a good control, and whether a follow-up application of S. feltiae, applied three to five weeks after planting with a better suited technique (e. g., injection), would further improve control of cabbage root fly. Chapter 5 presents two field trials in leek set up to determine and, if possible, to improve the effect of spray applications with S. feltiae against onion thrips in leek. The first trial was carried out on an organic farm and focused on selecting a suitable spray application technique and on testing the effect of an attractant on thrips control. The second trial focused on incorporating spray applications of EPN in a conventional insecticide scheme, and on the effect of mixing the surfactant Addit in the spray suspension on the control of onion thrips. The results show that the selected commercial strain of S. feltiae was not effective against the foliar inhabiting life stages of onion thrips in leek. Mixing a thrips attractant in the spray suspension and spraying with adapted spray equipment (band application and row application) did not improve the efficacy. Compared with the traditional spray boom technique, the row application technique ensured a more even EPN deposition on both the upper side and underside of both old and new leek leaves. This technique offers good potential for improving the applications of fungicides and of contact insecticides in leek. The general discussion in chapter 6 links the obtained results, and suggests directions for future research. The described experimental work with EPN against the cabbage moth, cabbage root fly and onion thrips showed that significant control of the first two pests is certainly possible in outdoor vegetables, but it also showed that there’s still a long way to go before EPN will be applied commercially against these pests in outdoor vegetables. Efficient control of insect pests with EPN requires a perfect match between several factors: the EPN species/strain/breeding product, the pest, the crop, the application (in terms of technique, formulation and application rate) and the environmental conditions. Matching these factors requires the screening and breeding of much more EPN species/strains for different properties (e. g., pathogenicity, temperature tolerance, mobility, drought resistance). In the short term, research on EPN applications against greenhouse pests seems to be the most promising area of research in temperate climates. Only when the prices for EPN drop due to more widespread adoption and when new EPN species/strains/breeding products and application techniques become available, will outdoor applications of EPN become commercially viable. Because pest control with EPN is obviously not a one-size fits-all solution, farmers will need appropriate knowledge to obtain successful pest control with EPN. Moreover, the upcoming EU obligation for farmers to use Integrated Pest Management (IPM) methods to protect their crops will further increase the demand for knowledge on IPM methods. Governmental, NGO and corporate advisory networks will need to be strengthened in order to fulfil this demand and to keep European crops healthy...|$|E

Both the irrigation water and <b>planting</b> <b>tray</b> inserts served as sources of inoculum that introduced the pathogen into the nursery. The irrigation water was amended with hydrogen peroxide at an ORP level of 400 mV for an exposure time of 6 h because it was observed that such a treatment effectively killed all F. circinatum spores and was not phytotoxic to pine seedlings under laboratory conditions.

A one-layer NN based controller is designed to estimate the unknown dynamics of the mobile base plus robot arm system after the incorporation of non-holonomic constraints.

The case of maintaining a desired course and speed or tracking a desired Cartesian trajectory as the on-board arm moves to its desired orientation with an unknown endeffector load is considered. An outer loop is designed to avoid both stationary and moving obstacles. Finally, an additional outer tracking loop is constructed so as to navigate the mobile base with the onboard arm along the path. The net result is a base plus arm motion controller that is capable of achieving a coordinated motion of the base plus arm in the presence of uncertain dynamics, load and the environment. 1...|$|R

40|$|Good {{germination}} is a {{basic requirement}} for successful sugarcane production. To predict crop emergence and manage early crop development {{it is necessary to}} understand the factors that affect germination and early growth. The minimum temperature for bud germination used in the CANEGRO and APSIM crop models is 10 ºC, based on leaf emergence studies. As the base temperature for emergence for South African cultivars has not been documented previously, a study was initiated to examine the effect of temperature, soil moisture, soil fertility and seed lot on the emergence of cultivars NCo 376, N 16, N 27 and non-fertilised N 27. Carefully selected setts were <b>planted</b> in <b>trays</b> filled with soil of 0, 7 and 21 % clay content, in glasshouse cubicles which were set at 30 ºC, 25 ºC, 20 ºC and 15 ºC respectively. A set of <b>planted</b> <b>trays</b> was kept dry while the rest was irrigated according to evaporative demand. Bud emergence from a 60 mm planting depth peaked at 14, 22 and 56 days in the 30, 25 and 20 ºC cubicles, respectively. Germination in the 15 ºC environment was very poor and could not be used to determine base temperatures. Using linear extrapolation of the response to temperature, the results indicated that emergence did not take place below 18. 1 ºC for NCo 376, 17. 8 ºC for N 16 and 16. 8 ºC for N 27. Seedcane of unfertilised origin germinated significantly more poorly than that of fertilised origin and sets planted in fertilised soil demonstrated significantly higher emergence counts (p= 0. 05) compared to unfertilised soil. Setts planted in sun-dried soil did not grow roots or show signs of bud swelling and differentiation. Results from this study may help explain the poor emergence under cool winter conditions or poor ratoonability experienced under trash. Results also indicated differences in cultivar sensitivity, and the methodology could be used to screen for better adaptation to the cooler Midlands or southern production areas...|$|R

Biochar, a carbon-net-negative soil amendment, has been promoted for its ability to retain nutrients in soils and increase soil fertility. This study evaluated the effect on water quality of greenroof runoff after adding biochar to a typical extensive greenroof soil. Prototype greenroof trays with and without 7 % biochar (by weight) were planted with sedum or ryegrass, with barren soil trays for controls. The greenroof trays were subjected to two sequential 2. 9 in/hr rainfall events using a rainfall simulator. Runoff from the rainfall events was collected and evaluated for total nitrogen, total phosphorus, nitrate, phosphate, total organic carbon, and inorganic carbon. Greenroof trays containing biochar showed lower quantities of nutrients in the stormwater runoff compared to trays without biochar. Biochar-amended soil with and without plants showed a 3 - to 25 -fold decrease in release of nitrate and total nitrogen concentrations, as well as a decrease in phosphate and total phosphorus concentrations release into the rainfall runoff. Phosphorus results from <b>trays</b> <b>planted</b> with sedum indicate that sedum interacted with both soils to cause a decrease of phosphorus in the greenroof runoff. In correlation with a visual effect in turbidity, biochar-amended soil showed a reduction of total organic carbon in the runoff by a factor of 3 to 4 for all soil and <b>plant</b> <b>trays.</b> Inorganic carbon was similar for all tests showing that inorganic carbon neither reacted with, nor was retained by, biochar in the soil.

40|$|In {{preparation}} for future human exploration missions to space, human habitat designs and concepts {{need to be}} tested to assess integration issues, power requirements, crew operations, and technology I subsystem performance. One potential subsystem for early habitats is supplemental food production. Fresh foods, such as vegetables and small fruits, could be harvested on a continuous basis to improve the diet and quality of life. The system would need to fit conveniently into the habitat and not interfere with other components or operations. To test this concept, a plant growing "atrium" was designed to surround the lift between the lower and upper modules of the Deep Space Habitat and deployed at NASA DRA TS test site in 2011 and at NASA's JSC in 20 I 2. With this approach, un-utilized volume provided an area for vegetable growth. For the 20 II test, mizuna, lettuce, basil, radish and sweetpotato plants were grown in trays using commercially available red I blue LED light fixtures. Seedlings were transplanted into the atrium and cared for by the crew. Plants were then harvested two weeks later following completion of the test. In 20 I 2, mizuna, lettuce, and radish plants were grown similarly but under flat panel banks of white LEDs. In 20 I 2, the crew went through plant harvesting, including sanitizing the leafy greens and radishes, which were then consumed.

40|$|Mestrado em Engenharia Agronómica - Instituto Superior de AgronomiaHydrangeas {{have been}} a very {{important}} greenhouse crop well known for their large colorful inflorescences. Once such plant, ‘Avantgarde’ hydrangea, is a hybrid between some Hydrangea macrophylla cultivars that don’t need cold to bloom. Therefore it is possible to make the entire production in 22 to 26 weeks by using the appropriate photoperiod and light. For the present study three trials were design to adapt ‘Avantgarde’ culture conditions to the usual production of better known hydrangeas. Regarding density, best results were obtained by using density 3, which means half of the density conventionally used. Cold was responsible for the delay of flower developmental stages of <b>plants</b> in <b>trays.</b> Some interaction effects were detected between different times of cold storage, different concentrations and frequency of growth regulator applied showing a trend of associating long cold storages to delayed flower stages.

40|$|AbstractThe {{effects of}} aerosol smoke (AS), smoke-water (SW), {{potassium}} nitrate (KNO 3), {{naphthalene acetic acid}} (NAA) and indole- 3 -butyric acid (IBA) on germination and seedling growth of Jatropha curcas were investigated. Seed coat removal accelerated water imbibition and germination occurred within 48 h. Seeds subjected to AS failed to germinate over a 90 day period. There {{were no significant differences}} in germination percentage between the treatments and untreated control (intact- and shelled-seed). However, shelled-seeds had the shortest mean germination time (MGT). Seedlings developed from treated seeds were <b>planted</b> in <b>trays</b> under shade house conditions and growth traits measured after 3 months. Soaking intact-seeds in SW, KNO 3 and NAA (24 h) produced significantly heavier and longer seedlings, which resulted in higher vigour indices (VI) compared to the control treatments. These results provide empirical evidence of the stimulatory effect of SW, KNO 3 and NAA on J. curcas seedling growth and vigour and the continuation of the effect over time. The approach of treating intact-seeds of J. curcas with plant growth substances prior to planting will help in producing healthy seedlings and possibly improve crop productivity...|$|R

The RP seeds were sown in 4 rows, 5  cm apart, with 25 plants in each row, in plastic trays (60 x 30 x 30  cm) that were filled with puddle nutrient enriched soil. After 15  days, <b>plants</b> in some <b>trays</b> were exposed to GMB 1 females (n[*]=[*] 25) and males (n[*]=[*] 10) and <b>plants</b> in other <b>trays</b> were left un-exposed but all trays were treated alike.

40|$|Warm season turfgrass species (like bermudagrass) {{seem to be}} very {{suitable}} to Mediterranean climate conditions. They also give an excellent wear resistance to the sport pitches. Transplanting of pre-cultivated warm season turgrass plants (similar to horticultural nursery) is a promising technique which can be efficiently used for turf conversion. It is based on the quick ground cover capacity of these species by means of stolons and rhizomes. Transplanting can be performed both in tilled and untilled soil. A working yard for the conversion of a professional football pitch was assessed in order to evaluate the performaces. The transplant was performed with a 4 -row mechanical transplanter which had been adjusted to work in the untilled mowed football pitch. The mechanical transplanter accommodates 4 back-seated operators and 4 walking operators who can manually transplant the plants in case of failure. The working speed of the tractor was less than 1 km h- 1, theoretical working time was about 15 h ha- 1, actual working time was 28 h ha- 1, thus the work efficiency was about 0. 52. Fuel consumption was about 28 kg ha- 1. Such a low efficiency was due to the difficulty of the operators to remove the <b>plants</b> from the <b>trays</b> and supply the transplanter’s delivery system. In this concern, an automatic transplanter was modified in order to work in untilled soil within a second specific trial. This machine had an automatic system for removing the <b>plants</b> from the <b>trays,</b> like the most advanced robotic transplanters for vegetable crops. Moreover, a specific system for plant deposition in untilled soil was developed by mounting a double disc in front of the furrowers. Plant deposition was tested and a maximum variation of 6 cm in the row was assessed with respect to the expected value. This gap is completely in accordance with this kind of crop...|$|R

40|$|Summary Container-grown {{black spruce}} (Picea mariana (Mill.) B. S. P.) {{seedlings}} were <b>planted</b> in <b>trays</b> containing a sand and peat mixture, {{and placed in}} a climate-controlled green-house. One group of seedlings was kept well-watered, and another group was subjected to three cycles of drought. Gas exchange analysis showed that mesophyll photosynthetic func-tion was largely unimpaired by drought. In contrast, stomatal conductance was sensitive to drought, although it became less sensitive with each drought cycle. Both stomatal and meso-phyll conductances increased with time in control and drought-stressed seedlings, but mesophyll conductance increased with time more rapidly than did stomatal conductance. Limitation of photosynthetic rate was dominated by the mesophyll. In control seedlings, relative stomatal limitation increased from 6 to 16 % {{by the end of the}} experiment. In drought-stressed seedlings, relative stomatal limitation of photosynthesis reached 40 % during the first drought, but decreased to near control values immediately after rewatering. Because the third, most severe drought had only a minor effect on stomatal conductance, relative stomatal limitation of photosynthesis was similar to that in control seedlings by the end of the experiment. Inhibition of ontogenetic change during drought stress may be responsible for the apparent acclimation of mesophyll photosynthetic processes. We conclude that it would be more effective to select for high photosynthetic capacity than for reduced stomatal sensitivity when breeding for in-creased drought resistance in black spruce seedlings...|$|R

40|$|AbstractSeed {{dispersal}} {{plays an}} important role in the persistence, regeneration and maintenance of plant communities. It is therefore not surprising that much attention has been paid to the germination potential of seeds ingested by frugivorous animals. Consequently the aim of this study was to determine what effect ingestion of seeds by Knysna Turacos (Tauraco corythaix) has on the germination rate and germination percentage of indigenous South African tree species. Fruits from twelve tree species were fed to the Turacos in separate trials and seed retention times were determined as it has been suggested that a longer seed retention time may increase germination rates. At the end of each trial, seeds were extracted from excreta of individual birds and <b>planted</b> in <b>trays</b> containing potting soil. Germination was recorded daily until 14 days of no germination. Knysna Turacos seed retention times were in the range of those obtained by other studies, with Ficus sur seeds having the fastest retention times (12. 4 ± 0. 8 min) and Celtis africana the slowest (34. 6 ± 5. 6 min). Seed ingestion by Knysna Turacos did not influence the rate at which seeds germinated in 83 % of the tree species, but ingested Ficus lutea and Ficus natalensis seeds germinated significantly sooner than whole fruit seeds. Future studies relating the composition of indigenous forest fruits to food preferences of Knysna Turacos may give insight into their role as potential seed dispersers of indigenous fruiting tree species...|$|R
40|$|Fast-growing {{seedlings}} have larger immediate nutrient demands {{as compared}} with adult <b>plants.</b> A <b>tray</b> experiment was conducted to evaluate the fertilization of sweet pepper transplants growing on different substrates [Control (60 % Sphagnum peat + 40 % perlite), Mix I (45 % Sphagnum peat + 30 % perlite + 25 % farmyard compost), Mix II (30 % Sphagnum peat + 20 % perlite + 50 % farmyard compost), and Commercial (40 % compost + Sphagnum peat + perlite + vermiculite) l with weekly applications of nitrogen N at rates of 150 and 300 mg. L- 1, compared to a control without fertilization. Seedlings were transplanted in a randomized, complete block design with four replications. Leaf area and fresh and dry weights of leaves, stems and roots were measured for the transplants; the leaf weight ratio. specific leaf area, absolute and relative growth rates, leaf expansion rates, leaf area duration, and net assimilation rate were calculated. Precocity, early yield, and total yield were measured for the field crop. The application of nitrogen had positive effects on most growth parameters of seedlings growing on substrates with compost, promoting increased precocity and yield in the transplanted crop.

40|$|A {{robot system}} {{for use in}} an {{enclosed}} environment was designed and tested. The conceptual design {{will be used to}} assist in research performed by the Controlled Ecological Life Support System (CELSS) project. Design specifications include maximum load capacity, operation at specified environmental conditions, low maintenance, and safety. The robot system must not be hazardous to the sealed environment, and be capable of stowing and deploying within a minimum area of the CELSS chamber facility. This design consists of a telescoping robot arm that slides vertically on a shaft positioned {{in the center of the}} CELSS chamber. The telescoping robot arm consists of a series of links which can be fully extended to a length equal to the radius of the working envelope of the CELSS chamber. The vertical motion of the robot arm is achieved through the use of a combination ball screw/ball spline actuator system. The robot arm rotates cylindrically about the vertical axis through use of a turntable bearing attached to a central mounting structure fitted to the actuator shaft. The shaft is installed in an overhead rail system allowing the entire structure to be stowed and deployed within the CELSS chamber. The overhead rail system is located above the chamber's upper lamps and extends to the center of the CELSS chamber. The mounting interface of the actuator shaft and rail system allows the entire actuator shaft to be detached and removed from the CELSS chamber. When the actuator shaft is deployed, it is held fixed at the bottom of the chamber by placing a square knob on the bottom of the shaft into a recessed square fitting in the bottom of the chamber floor. A support boot ensures the rigidity of the shaft. Three student teams combined into one group designed a model of the CELSS chamber robot that they could build. They investigated materials, availability, and strength in their design. After the model arm and stand were built, the class performed pre-tests on the entire system. A stability pre-test was used to determine whether the model robot arm would tip over on the stand when it was fully extended. Results showed the stand tipped when 50 Newtons were applied horizontally to the top of the vertical shaft while the arm was fully extended. This proved that it was stable. Another pre-test was the actuator slip test used to determine if there is an adequate coefficient of friction between the actuator drive wheels and drive cable to enable the actuator to fully extend and retract the arm. This pre-test revealed that the coefficient of friction was not large enough to prevent slippage. Sandpaper was glued to the drive wheel and this eliminated the slippage problem. The class preformed a fit test in the CELSS chamber to ensure that the completed robot arm is capable of reaching the entire working envelope. The robot was centered in the chamber and the arm was fully extended to the sides of the chamber. The arm was also able to retract to clear the drain pipes separating the upper and lower <b>plant</b> <b>trays...</b>|$|R

Roots and leaves weigh less than 0.25  g per plant at this stage; thus, roots and leaves of several <b>plants</b> per <b>tray</b> were pooled to achive this mass. Therefore, they were transferred into a sterile petri dish. The leaves of one tray per treatment were disinfected with gentamicin for 10  min as described above, while {{the leaves of the}} second tray remained untreated. The disinfected leaves were rinsed twice with 40 -mL demineralized sterile water. All plant samples were transferred into sterile mortars, and 2.25 -mL sterile physiological sodium chloride solution was added to each sample. The plant tissue was ground, and the resulting solution was diluted decimally in physiological sodium chloride solution. Appropriate dilutions were spread-plated in duplicate on sorbitol Mac Conkey agar (SMAC, Merck KGaA), and the plates were incubated at 37  °C for 24  h. Sorbitol-fermenting bacteria, such as the investigated strain 431 / 97, metabolize this carbohydrate into acid, which in turn is used in combination with the indicator neutral red to turn the colonies red. Sorbitol-negative bacteria on the other hand, such as taxonomically closely related Shigella and Salmonella, show colorless colonies. The viable counts were determined and the colonies were assessed for their morphology. Selected colonies displaying different morphologies were sub-cultured on sorbitol Mac Conkey agar for purification, and assigned consecutive numbers.|$|R
