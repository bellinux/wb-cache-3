25|$|Most {{sources of}} {{electromagnetic}} radiation contain {{a large number}} of atoms or molecules that emit light. The orientation of the electric fields produced by these emitters may not be correlated, in which case the light is said to be unpolarised. If there is partial correlation between the emitters, the light is partially polarised. If the polarization is consistent across the spectrum of the source, partially polarised light can be described as a superposition of a completely unpolarised component, and a completely polarised one. One may then describe the light in terms of the degree of polarization, and the parameters of the <b>polarization</b> <b>ellipse.</b>|$|E
25|$|Unpolarized {{light can}} be {{described}} as a mixture of two independent oppositely polarized streams, each with half the intensity. Light is said to be partially polarized when there is more power in one of these streams than the other. At any particular wavelength, partially polarized light can be statistically described as the superposition of a completely unpolarized component and a completely polarized one. One may then describe the light in terms of the degree of polarization and the parameters of the polarized component. That polarized component {{can be described}} in terms of a Jones vector or <b>polarization</b> <b>ellipse,</b> as is detailed above. However, in order to also describe the degree of polarization, one normally employs Stokes parameters (see below) to specify a state of partial polarization.|$|E

The choice of such a coordinate system and viewing the <b>polarization</b> <b>ellipse</b> in terms of the [...] x and y polarization components, corresponds to the definition of the Jones vector (below) in terms of those basis polarizations. One would typically choose axes to suit a particular problem such as x being in the plane of incidence. Since there are separate reflection coefficients for the linear polarizations in and orthogonal to the plane of incidence (p and s polarizations, see below), that choice greatly simplifies the calculation of a wave's reflection from a surface.|$|E

40|$|Photopolarimetry is {{the spatial}} {{characterization}} of light polarization. Unlike intensity or wavelength, we are largely insensitive to polarization and therefore {{find it hard}} to explore the multidimensional data that photopolarimetry produces (two spatial dimensions plus four polarization dimensions). Many different ways for presenting and exploring this modality of light have been suggested. Most of these ignore circular polarization, include multiple image panes that make correlating structure with polarization difficult, and obscure the main trends with overly detailed information and often misleading colour maps. Here, we suggest a novel way for presenting the main results from photopolarimetric analyses. By superimposing a grid of <b>polarization</b> <b>ellipses</b> onto the RGB image, the full polarization state of each cell is intuitively conveyed to the reader. This method presents linear and circular polarization as well as ellipticity in a graphical manner, does not require multiple panes, facilitates the correlation between structure and polarization, and requires the addition of only three novel colours.

40|$|Riemann-Silberstein (RS) {{vortices}} {{have been}} defined as surfaces in spacetime where the complex form of a free electromagnetic field given by F=E+iB is null (F. F= 0), and they can indeed be interpreted as the collective history swept out by moving vortex lines of the field. Formally, the nullity condition {{is similar to the}} definition of "C-lines" associated with a monochromatic electric or magnetic field, which are curves in space where the <b>polarization</b> <b>ellipses</b> degenerate to circles. However, it was noted that RS vortices of monochromatic fields generally oscillate at optical frequencies and are therefore unobservable while electric and magnetic C-lines are steady. Here I show that under the additional assumption of having definite helicity, RS vortices are not only steady but they coincide with both sets of C-lines, electric and magnetic. The two concepts therefore become one for waves of definite frequency and helicity. Since the definition of RS vortices is relativistically invariant while that of C-lines is not, it may be useful to regard the vortices as a wideband generalization of C-lines for waves of definite helicity.

40|$|A brief {{review and}} {{discussion}} is given {{of an investigation}} of the characteristics of the naturally-occurring ULF plasma waves in the magnetosphere near L= 4. The investigation was carried out using similarly-instrumented magnetometer stations at Siple, Antarctica and in the conjugate region at Lac Rebours, Quebec. The waves were predominantly in the Pc- 3 frequency range. No magnetospheric waves that satisfied an imposed strict selection criterion were observed after ∿ 1700 LT. Approximately half of the 94 accepted events were left-hand elliptically polarized, with no significant change in polarization characteristics observed as a function of local time. However, a distinct preferential orientation direction as a function of local time was observed for the major axes of the <b>polarization</b> <b>ellipses.</b> Approximately 16 % of the events had opposite polarizations in the two hemispheres; this may be a manifestation of occasional station non-conjugacy combined with a narrow (in latitude) extent of wave localization. All but two of the events were symmetrical about the meridian plane, implying an odd-mode standing oscillation of the geomagnetic field lines. A significant local time dependence observed in the relative orientations of the plane of the Pc- 3 waves is interpreted as a possible effect of the ionosphere on the transmission of the ULF waves...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe grass shrimp (Palaemonetes vulgaris) orients {{itself by}} means of the {{polarization}} pattern of the sky visible through Snell's window of the water surface. The celestial polarization pattern viewed from water is distorted and modified because of refraction and repolarization of skylight at the air-water interface. This work provides a quantitative account of the repolarization of skylight transmitted through a flat water surface. The degree and direction of linear polarization, the transmissivity and the shape of the refraction-polarization oval are calculated at the air-water interface as functions of the polarization characteristics and the incident angle of partially linearly polarized incoming light. Two-dimensional patterns of linear <b>polarization</b> <b>ellipses</b> and of the degree and direction of polarization of skylight are presented for different zenith distances of the sun. The corresponding underwater refraction-polarization patterns are computed. Transmissivity patterns of a flat water surface are calculated for unpolarized light of an overcast sky and for partially polarized light of clear skies {{as a function of the}} zenith distance of the sun. The role of these refraction-polarization patterns in orientation and polarization vision of the grass shrimp (P. vulgaris) and rainbow trout (Oncorhyncus mykiss) is reviewed. The effects of cloud cover, surface waves and water turbidity on the refraction-polarization patterns are briefly discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{horizontal}} {{spatial structure}} of Pc 3 pulsations observed at low geomagnetic latitude (22 – 46 °) around dawn is studied statistically using data {{acquired by the}} Circum-pan Pacific Magnetometer Network (CPMN). It is found that while the phase of the H component of low-latitude Pc 3 pulsations remains largely unchanged {{with the passing of}} dawn, the D component undergoes a phase shift of ca. 180 °. This phase variation across dawn is related to the abrupt change in the major axis orientation of <b>polarization</b> <b>ellipses</b> observed in previous studies. Both the H and D components have higher amplitude after dawn than before dawn. This horizontal amplitude and phase structure is well explained by the response of a nonuniform ionosphere around dawn to incident Alfvén waves, where the secondary electric field caused by charge accumulation at the dawn terminator {{plays an important role in}} deformation of the current system. Enhancement of the D/H ratio is also observed just after dawn at very low latitudes (22 °). As Alfvén waves are not excited efficiently at very low geomagnetic latitudes, including the magnetic equator, the observed horizontal structure in such regions may be due to a large-scale current system originating at higher latitudes...|$|R
40|$|Propagation of {{high-frequency}} radiation in an {{anisotropic medium}} {{can be described}} in terms of two normal modes with different polarizations and different absorption coefficients. We investigate the properties of the normal modes in a strongly magnetized hydrogen gas for conditions expected in atmospheres of isolated neutron stars. We use the Kramers-Kronig relations to obtain the polarizability tensor for the strongly magnetized hydrogen. We derive and compute the polarizations and absorption coefficients of the normal modes from the polarizability tensor using both analytical approximations and numerical calculations. We find that the spectral features and anisotropy associated with the bound-bound and bound-free transitions in the magnetized hydrogen are manifested in the polarization characteristics, which affects substantially the spectral and angular dependences of the absorption coefficients of the normal modes and the transfer of radiation in neutron star atmospheres. There exist at least two critical frequencies where, for any direction of propagation, either the normal mode polarizations are exactly linear or orientations of two <b>polarization</b> <b>ellipses</b> coincide with each other. For each of these frequencies, there exist a direction of propagation for which the two normal modes are linearly polarized, and their polarizations and absorption coefficients fully coincide. The unusual properties of the normal modes should manifest themselves in the spectra, angular distribution, and polarization of the thermal-like radiation emitted from surface layers of neutron stars. ...|$|R

40|$|A new {{approach}} is developed to find the source azimuth of the ultra low frequency (ULF) electromagnetic (EM) signals believed to be emanating from well defined seismic zone. The method is test applied on magnetic data procured from the seismoactive region of Koyna-Warna, known for prolonged reservoir triggered seismicity. Extremely low-noise, high-sensitivity LEMI- 30 search coil magnetometers were used to measure simultaneously the vector magnetic field in the frequency range 0. 001 – 32 Hz at two stations, the one located within and another ~ 100 km away from the seismic active zone. During the observation campaign extending from 15 March to 30 June 2006 two earthquakes (EQs) of magnitude (ML&gt; 4) occurred, which are searched {{for the presence of}} precursory EM signals. Comparison of <b>polarization</b> <b>ellipses</b> (PE) parameters formed by the magnetic field components at the measurement stations, in select frequency bands, allows discrimination of seismo-EM signals from the natural background ULF signals of magnetospheric/ionospheric origin. The magnetic field components corresponding to spectral bands dominated by seismo-EM fields define the PE plane which at any instant contains the source of the EM fields. Intersection lines of such defined PE planes for distant observation stations clutter in to the source region. Approximating the magnetic-dipole configuration for the source, the magnetic field components along the intersection lines suggest that azimuth of the EM source align in the NNW-SSE direction. This direction well coincides with the orientation of nodal plane of normal fault plane mechanism for the two largest EQs recorded during the campaign. More significantly the correspondence of this direction with the tectonic controlled trend in local seismicity, it has been surmised that high pressure fluid flow along the fault that facilitate EQs in the region may also be the source mechanism for EM fields by electrokinetic effect...|$|R

In linear polarization the electric field of the radio wave oscillates back and forth along one direction; this can be affected by the mounting of the antenna but usually the desired direction is either horizontal or vertical polarization. In circular polarization, the electric field (and magnetic field) of the radio wave rotates at the radio frequency circularly around the axis of propagation.
