These age onset degenerative diseases {{are associated with}} the aggregation of misfolded proteins into insoluble, extracellular aggregates and/or intracellular inclusions including cross-beta sheet amyloid fibrils. It is not completely clear whether the aggregates are the cause or merely a reflection of the loss of protein homeostasis, the balance between synthesis, folding, aggregation and protein turnover. Recently the European Medicines Agency approved the use of Tafamidis or Vyndaqel (a kinetic stabilizer of tetrameric transthyretin) for the treatment of transthyretin amyloid diseases. This suggests that the process of amyloid fibril formation (and not the fibrils themselves) causes the degeneration of post-mitotic tissue in human amyloid diseases. Misfolding and excessive degradation instead of folding and function leads to a number of proteopathy diseases such as antitrypsin-associated emphysema, cystic fibrosis and the lysosomal storage diseases, where loss of function is the origin of the disorder.

The most common pathology associated with AAT deficiency occurs in the lung, where the loss of function due to impaired secretion of mutant AAT prevents the inhibition of neutrophil elastase and leads to loss of elastin content from the alveolar interstitium.

SP-B immunohistochemistry demonstrated significant increases in ATII cell numbers at all rhKGF doses compared with control animals and peaked 2 days following administration of 10 mg/kg rhKGF.

40|$|Alpha- 1 antitrypsin Deficiency (AATD) {{has been}} an {{attractive}} target {{for the development of}} gene therapy because it is a common single gene disorder, for which there would appear to be significant benefit to be gained for lung disease patients by augmentation of plasma levels of wild-type (M) alpha- 1 antitrypsin (AAT). While a significant proportion of patients also have liver disease, which is unlikely to be benefitted by augmentation, the potential to treat or prevent lung disease by replacement of plasma levels to at least 11 microMolar (571 mcg/ml) is the basis upon which several <b>protein</b> <b>replacement</b> <b>therapies</b> have been licensed for human use.

Based on these considerations, attempts have been made to develop AAT therapies using nonviral gene transfer, gammaretrovirus, recombinant adenovirus (rAd), and recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) vectors. These have resulted in three phase I clinical trials (one of cationic liposome, one of rAAV 2, and one of rAAV 1) and one phase II clinical trial (with rAAV 1).

The first vector expressed R 338 A-FIX, an FIX variant with the arginine at position 338 changed to an alanine, which resulted in a 2. 9 -fold higher specific activity (IU/mg) compared with the wild-type FIX.

These proteins and their mRNA are released into the culture medium as very low-density microvesicles (~ 1. 05 g/ml), which do not label for lysobisphosphatidic acid. The presence of the human transgene proteins in the vesicles was confirmed by western blotting and confirmed and quantified by mass spectrometry.

However, the intracellular delivery of mRNA is challenging and necessitates a safe and effective delivery vector. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have shown considerable promise for the delivery of small interfering RNAs (siRNA) to the liver but their utility as agents for mRNA delivery have only been recently investigated. New delivery materials for mRNA delivery are also being developed which {{have the potential}} to transfect nonliver targets, but the screening of these vectors in vivo is low-throughput {{and it is difficult to}} determine transfected cell types. There is a need both for efficacious, well-characterized mRNA delivery materials and for methods to facilitate in vivo screening of novel materials. We first developed a generalized strategy to optimize LNP formulations for mRNA delivery to the liver using Design of Experiment methodologies. By simultaneously varying lipid ratios and structures, we developed an optimized formulation which increased the potency of eryrthopoietin-mRNA-loaded LNPs in vivo 7 -fold relative to formulations previously used for siRNA delivery. Next, we explored the immune response and activity of base-modified LNPformulated mRNA administered systemically in vivo. We observed indications of a previously uncharacterized transient, extracellular innate immune response to mRNA-LNPs, including neutrophilia, myeloid cell activation, and up-regulation of four serum cytokines. Although we have developed a more efficacious liver-targeting LNP, many mRNA therapies will require delivery to non-liver tissues. Using trial-and-error approaches, we discover novel formulations capable of inducing mRNA expression in vivo in the spleen, lung, and fat. To increase the throughput of in vivo screening, we report a new barcoding-based approach capable of evaluating the biodistribution and pharmacokinetics of many LNP formulations in a single mouse. Then, we develop a method that can identify mRNA expression delivered from LNPs in both bulk tissues and with single cell resolution. Together, the work reported here contributes to the development of mRNA therapeutics by increasing mRNA-LNP potency and characterizing their immunogenicity in vivo. Furthermore, we hope the multiple in vivo screening methods described in this Thesis will accelerate the discovery of new delivery vectors capable of transfecting desired tissues and cell types. by Kevin John Kauffman.

Several preclinical and clinical studies have explored the use of onco-retroviral and, more recently, lentiviral vectors for gene therapy of hemophilia A or B. Both ex vivo and in vivo gene therapy approaches have been evaluated, resulting in therapeutic FVIII or FIX levels in preclinical animal models. Whereas in vivo gene therapy using onco-retroviral or lentiviral vectors often led to long-term FVIII or FIX expression from transduced hepatocytes, ex vivo approaches were generally hampered by either low or transient expression of FVIII or FIX levels in vivo and/or inefficient engraftment. Furthermore, immune responses against the transgene product remain a major issue that must be resolved before the full potential of these vectors eventually can be exploited clinically. Nevertheless, the continued progress in vector design combined with a better understanding of vector biology may ultimately yield more effective gene therapy approaches using these integrating vectors. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Hemophilia A, a {{deficiency}} of functional coagulation factor VIII (FVIII), is treated via <b>protein</b> <b>replacement</b> <b>therapy.</b> Restor-ing 1 % to 5 % of normal blood FVIII activity prevents spontaneous bleeding, making the disease an attractive gene therapy target. Previously, we have demonstrated short-term activity of a liver-specific AAV 2 vector expressing canine B-domain– deleted FVIII (cFVIII) in a hemophilia ca-nine model. Here, we report the long-term efficacy {{and safety of}} AAV-cFVIII vectors of serotypes 2, 5, 6, and 8 in both hemo-philia A mice and dogs. AAV 6 -cFVIII and AAV 8 -cFVIII restored physiologic levels of plasma FVIII activity in hemophilia A mice. The improved efficacy is attributed to more efficient gene transfer in liver compared with AAV 2 and AAV 5. However, supraphysiologic cFVIII levels correlated {{with the formation of}} cFVIII-neutralizing antibodies in these mice. Of importance, hemophilia A dogs that received AAV 2 -cFVIII, AAV 6 -cFVIII, and AAV 8 -cFVIII have persistently expressed therapeutic levels of FVIII, without antibody formation or other toxicities, for more than 3 years. However, liver transduction efficiencies are similar between AAV 2, AAV 6, and AAV 8 serotypes in hemophilia A dogs, in contrast to mice. In summary, this is the first report demonstrating multiyear thera-peutic efficacy and safety of multiple AAV-cFVIII vectors in hemophilia A dogs and provides the basis for human clinical studies.

40|$|Gene therapy {{provides}} an attractive alternative for <b>protein</b> <b>replacement</b> <b>therapy</b> in hemophilia A patients. Recent {{studies have shown}} the potential benefit of directing factor (F) VIII gene delivery to cells that also express its natural carrier protein von Willebrand factor (VWF). In this study, we explored the feasibility of blood outgrowth endothelial cells as a cellular FVIII delivery device with particular reference to long-term production levels, intracellular storage in Weibel-Palade bodies and agonist-induced regulated secretion. Human blood outgrowth endothelial cells were isolated from peripheral blood collected from healthy donors, transduced at passage 5 using a lentiviral vector encoding human B-domain deleted FVIII-GFP and characterized by flow cytometry and confocal microscopy. Blood outgrowth endothelial cells displayed typical endothelial morphology and expressed the endothelial-specific marker VWF. Following transduction with a lentivirus encoding FVIII-GFP, 80 % of transduced blood outgrowth endothelial cells expressed FVIII-GFP. Levels of FVIII-GFP positive cells declined slowly upon prolonged culturing. Transduced blood outgrowth endothelial cells expressed 1. 6 +/- 1. 0 pmol/ 1 x 10 (6) cells/ 24 h FVIII. Morphological analysis demonstrated that FVIII-GFP was stored in Weibel-Palade bodies together with VWF and P-selectin. FVIII levels were only slightly increased following agonist-induced stimulation, whereas a 6 - to 8 -fold increase of VWF levels was observed. Subcellular fractionation revealed that 15 - 22 % of FVIII antigen was present within the dense fraction containing Weibel-Palade bodies. We conclude that blood outgrowth endothelial cells, {{by virtue of their}} ability to store a significant portion of synthesized FVIII-GFP in Weibel-Palade bodies, provide an attractive cellular on-demand delivery device for gene therapy of hemophilia...|$|E
40|$|Recently {{there has}} {{developed}} an increasing realization {{of the value of}} intavenous <b>protein</b> as a <b>replacement</b> <b>therapy</b> in the acute plasma loss (M. R. C. 1940) of haemorrhage, (Strumia, Wagner and Monoghan 1940), burns, (Wakeley 1941, Black 1940, Elkington, Wolff and Lee 1940) and crushing injuries, (Trueta 1940), and in the more chronic deficiencies accompanying sepsis and nutritive disturbances. As a result, the demand for human plasma has become greater than the supply. The great value of protein feeding in the overcoming of infection, the protection it affords against liver damage, (Radvin 1940) and the relation of plasma protein level to the healing of wounds have all recently been emphasized by Whipple and his associates, (1940 and 1941). They point out that homologous protein introduced intravenously can supply such deficiencies where it is available in sufficient amounts, (Daft Robscheit, Robbins and Whipple 1938). The problem is how to tap the unlimited reservoir of heterologous plasma obtainable from the larger domestic animals. [ [...] . ...|$|R
40|$|Inherited {{epidermolysis bullosa}} (EB) {{is a family}} of rare genetic skin {{disorders}} characterized by structural and mechanical fragility of skin and mucosal membranes. The main feature of EB {{is the presence of}} recurrent skin blistering or erosions, which have a profound impact in {{the quality of life of}} EB patients and, in the most severe forms, cause early lethality. During the past two decades, it became possible to identify mutations in genes responsible for different types of EB and characterize the abnormalities of the related proteins. Nowadays, there is no cure for EB; all the treatments are palliative and focused on the relief of the devastating EB clinical picture. Recent advancements in molecular biology, stem cell biology and regenerative medicine have fostered new therapeutic approaches for EB. This review is focused on recent developments in gene <b>therapy,</b> <b>protein</b> <b>replacement</b> and cell-based <b>therapy</b> for EB, all aimed at finding a cure for this devastating disease...|$|R
40|$|Formation of {{inhibitory}} antibodies is {{a serious}} complication of <b>protein</b> or gene <b>replacement</b> <b>therapy</b> for hemophilias, congenital X-linked bleeding disorders. In hemophilia B (coagulation factor IX [F. IX] deficiency), lack of endogenous F. IX antigen expression and other genetic factors may {{increase the risk of}} antibody formation to functional F. IX. Here, we developed a protocol for reducing inhibitor formation in gene therapy by prior mucosal (intranasal) administration of a peptide representing a human F. IX-specific CD 4 + T-cell epitope in hemophilia B mice. C 3 H/HeJ mice with a F. IX gene deletion produced inhibitory IgG to human F. IX after hepatic gene transfer with an adeno-associated viral vector. These animals subsequently lost systemic F. IX expression. In contrast, repeated intranasal administration of the specific peptide resulted in reduced inhibitor formation, sustained circulating F. IX levels, and sustained partial correction of coagulation following hepatic gene transfer. This was achieved through immune deviation to a T-helper–cell response with increased IL- 10 and TGF-β production and activation of regulatory CD 4 +CD 25 + T cells...|$|R
