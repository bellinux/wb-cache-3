The acquisition allowed Airedale to extend its product portfolio to include a range of air handling Units (AHUs) which offer data centres, offices and industrial facilities a cooling system which uses indirect fresh air as the <b>primary</b> <b>cooling</b> <b>medium.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Power {{and cooling}} of IT {{equipment}} are of major concern for modern data centers. Since 1996 the worldwide costs {{for power and}} cooling of IT infrastructure have {{increased by more than}} a factor of five. [...] Conventionally, data centers use air as the <b>primary</b> <b>cooling</b> <b>medium</b> for the IT equipment. While air cooling is simple and flexible it also has some disadvantages, e.g., limited packaging density and limited options for energy reuse.Liquid cooling based on water as the coolant is another option. Since water has a very high heat capacity large amounts of heat can be removed from a system at moderate flow rates, thus allowing for a higher packaging density which in turn results in less floor space. Liquid cooling has recently resurfaced in the sector of high-performance computing. Since 2009 the Green500 list of the most energy-efficient supercomputers is dominated by liquid-cooled designs.|$|E
40|$|In recent years, {{about 40}} % {{of the total}} energy {{is devoted to the}} cooling {{infrastructures}} in data centers. One way to save energy is free air cooling (FAC), which utilizes the outside air as the <b>primary</b> <b>cooling</b> <b>medium,</b> instead of air conditioning, to reduce the energy consumption to cool the data centers. Despite the energy saving, the implementation of free air cooling will change the operating environment, which may adversely affect the performance and reliability of telecom equipment. This thesis reviews the challenges and risks posed by free air cooling. The increased temperature, uncontrolled humidity, and possible contamination may cause some failure mechanisms, e. g., Conductive anodic filament (CAF) and corrosion, to be more active. If the local temperatures of some hot spots go beyond their recommended operating conditions (RoC), the performances of the equipment may be affected. In this thesis, a methodology is proposed to identify the impact of free air cooling on telecom equipment performance. It uses the performance variations under traditional air condition (A/C) to create a baseline, and compares the performance variation under variable temperature and humidity representing FAC with the baseline. This method can help data centers determine an appropriate operating environment based on the service requirements, when FAC is implemented. In addition, a statics-based approach is also developed to identify the appropriate metric for the performance variations comparison. It is the first study focusing on the impact of FAC on the telecom equipment performance. This thesis also proposes a multi-stage (design, test, and operation) approach to mitigate the reliability risks of telecom equipment under free air cooling conditions. Specifically, a prognostics-based approach is proposed to mitigate the reliability risks at operation stage, and a case study is presented to show the implementation process. This approach needn't interrupt data center services and doesn't consume additional useful life of telecom equipment. It allows the implementation of FAC in data centers which were not originally designed for this cooling method...|$|E

40|$|Dragon {{fruit is}} one of the most nutritious and exotic fruit that is {{available}} in Malaysia. In this research,dragon fruit juice was concentrated by using freeze concentration process. Concentrated fruit juice can be preserved longer than non concentrated fruit juice. Besides,due to its small capacity storage,concentrated fruit juice also can minimize the transportation cost to import or export it. Freeze concentration process was used because it eliminates water from the juice at temperature below the water’s freezing point,thus preserving the aromatic compound that originally contained in the fruit juice. In addition to research objective,two process parameters and its effect on the fruit juice final concentration were studied. The process parameters were stirring rate and <b>cooling</b> <b>medium</b> temperature. The apparatus used to done the freeze concentration process was crystallizer unit. Dragon fruit juice that was blended and standardized its initial concentration was put into the crystallization unit. The fruit juice spent 12 hours in the crystallizer unit. During the time spent in the crystallizer unit,stirring rate and <b>cooling</b> <b>medium</b> temperature were varied in the range of (600, 800, 1000, 1200 and 1400) rpm and (- 6, - 8, - 10, - 12 and - 14) °C. To determine the best stirring rate,the temperature of the <b>cooling</b> <b>medium</b> in the crystallizer unit was constant at - 10 °C while the stirring rate of the fruit juice was varied. Then,the best stirring rate was used to determine the best <b>cooling</b> <b>medium</b> temperature. The dragon fruit juice initial concentration was standardized at 7 °Brix. After 12 hour spent in the crystallization unit,the concentration of the fruit juice increased.
