5|$|Boys in the Sand is a {{landmark}} American gay pornographic film released {{at the very}} beginnings of the Golden Age of <b>Porn.</b> The 1971 film was directed by Wakefield Poole and stars Casey Donovan. Boys in the Sand was the first gay <b>porn</b> film to include credits, to achieve crossover success, to be reviewed by Variety, {{and one of the}} earliest <b>porn</b> films, after 1969's Blue Movie by Andy Warhol, to gain mainstream credibility, preceding 1972's Deep Throat by nearly a year.|$|E
5|$|The IWF {{continues}} {{to assert that}} the image is indeed child <b>porn,</b> and asserts that the image would be blocked if it were on a British server.|$|E
5|$|Graham Cluley, a {{security}} expert for Sophos, argued that Anonymous' actions against child <b>porn</b> websites hosted on a darknet could be counterproductive, commenting that while their intentions may be good, {{the removal of}} illegal websites and sharing networks should be performed by the authorities, rather than Internet vigilantes.|$|E
5|$|In November 2014 former <b>porn</b> star Asia Carrera {{obtained}} {{an identity}} photo {{with the traditional}} Pastafarian headgear from a Department of Motor Vehicles office in Hurricane, Utah. The director of Utah's Driver License Division says that about a dozen Pastafarians have had their state driver's license photos taken with a similar pasta strainer over the years.|$|E
5|$|Alarmed by the FBI's presence, Zero visits Oswald at {{his home}} that night; a drunk and rowdy Oswald dismisses Zero's worries and summons {{lightning}} to strike down nearby cattle. The lightning strikes him instead, but he appears unharmed. The next day, the agents visit the scene and find a melted shoe print in the ground, linking it to Oswald. Meanwhile, Oswald uses his abilities to manipulate local traffic lights, causing a car accident. The agents visit Oswald's home and find a cut-out picture of Sharon Kiveat, Oswald's former high school teacher, inside a <b>porn</b> magazine.|$|E
5|$|Culver first {{appeared}} as Casey Donovan in Boys in the Sand, directed by Wakefield Poole, in 1971. The film {{was an instant}} success and {{is considered one of}} the great classics of male erotic cinema. With the success and celebrity he garnered from the film, Donovan believed that he would be able to cross over into mainstream film. While there were meetings with directors like John Schlesinger and Raymond St. Jacques and talk of casting him in mainstream projects including adaptations of novels by Mary Renault and Patricia Nell Warren, the only film opportunities opened for him were as the star of more erotic films. These included the bisexual <b>porn</b> film Score, The Back Row with George Payne, L. A. Tool & Die with Bob Blount and Richard Locke, The Other Side of Aspen with Al Parker and Dick Fisk, Boys in the Sand II and Inevitable Love, with Jon King and Jamie Wingo. Shortly before his death he starred, heavily intoxicated, in the fisting movie Fucked Up, for Christopher Rage. He also appeared in a number of heterosexual <b>porn</b> films, most notably The Opening of Misty Beethoven where he had a scene with Constance Money.|$|E
5|$|Jonathan has {{recently}} begun {{a relationship with}} an old acquaintance, Nicola (Katherine Parkinson), who is opposed to his investigative career, believing it to be too dangerous an occupation. Jonathan {{is still in the}} employment of the magician Adam Klaus, whose television series is receiving heavy criticism from viewers. To Jonathan's bemusement, Klaus invests in the 3D pornography industry and begins dating the <b>porn</b> actress Candy Mountains (Jemma Walker).|$|E
5|$|Khalifa {{has also}} said that her parents have stopped {{speaking}} to her because of her career choice. In a statement, her parents disassociated themselves from her actions, saying that her decision to enter the <b>porn</b> industry was born of her residence {{in a foreign country}} which had a different culture than theirs, and that her actions did not reflect her upbringing. They {{also said that}} they hoped that she would leave pornography, saying that her image did not honor her family or her home country.|$|E
5|$|Media exposés {{and popular}} outrage led Congress {{to pass by}} {{unanimous}} vote the Sexual Exploitation of Children Act of 1977, which criminalized the production and sale of child <b>porn.</b> This act {{was signed into law}} by President Jimmy Carter on February 6, 1978. The legislation was supported by a unanimous decision of the Supreme Court in New York v. Ferber, , that images of children need not meet legal definitions of obscenity to be prohibited by the government, since the state's interest in protecting children from harm trumped First Amendment rights in this instance.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{ends with}} the boys {{mourning}} at Kenny's grave and deciding {{to go home to}} eat candy as well as look at photos of Liane Cartman, who is on the cover of a <b>porn</b> magazine, much to the fury of Cartman claiming she was young and needed the money; Stan says the photos were taken a month ago, infuriating Cartman even more. Kenny returns as a zombie again, but a statue lands on him, followed by an airplane.|$|E
5|$|The {{show was}} controversial, with the police, Channel 4 {{and the media}} {{regulator}} Ofcom receiving hundreds of complaints. There were Twitter death threats made against {{the residents of the}} street. Channel 4 was accused of making poverty <b>porn.</b> Many of those taking part claimed that they were misled by the documentary makers. Ofcom launched an investigation into whether the programme had breached the broadcasting regulations, but ultimately concluded its rules had not been broken.|$|E
5|$|Among the {{supporting}} roles, {{one of the}} highest-profile pieces of casting was Malcolm McDowell as Soho <b>porn</b> baron Benny Barrett. Barrett appears in scenes across various episodes from 1966 through to 1979, but the production could only afford him for three weeks. This was because McDowell was then a resident in the United States. All of McDowell's scenes were therefore shot by Stuart Urban {{as part of the}} first block of filming, as opposed {{to the rest of the}} production which was filmed roughly chronologically. This was considered more than worthwhile, however, for the prestige of being able to use an actor such as McDowell, predominantly a film actor who rarely did television work.|$|E
5|$|At the game, {{bisexual}} drama teacher Andrew LeGustambos {{attempts to}} grab the attention of both Larry and Miracle, but the whole school stands in shock as Stuart arrives with two full and augmented breasts; the pills he had taken were actually librarian Helen Klench's female hormone replacements. Nonetheless, the school loses the game. Sue finally reveals she was not planning on actually firing any teacher on her watch. Helen arrives to inform them {{that they did not}} need to win the game after all; she had found a rare time capsule with treasures. Upon opening the time capsule, it is revealed that it is full of Willard's <b>porn</b> magazines that Ennis hid. Sue pitifully looks at Willard and tells him he is fired.|$|E
5|$|During the 1960s, James Bond movies, bomba (soft <b>porn)</b> {{pictures}} and {{an era of}} musical films, produced mostly by Sampaguita Pictures, dominated the cinema. The second golden age occurred from 1970s to early 1980s. It was during this era that filmmakers ceased to produce pictures in black and white. A rise in Hollywood films dominated theater sales during the late 1980s until the 2000s. The dawn of this era saw a dramatic decline of the mainstream Philippine movie industry. In the year 2009, however, presence of box-office films in the Philippine Box Office has surged. The mid 2010s also saw broader commercial success of films produced by independent studios.|$|E
5|$|Even so, {{there is}} no {{shortage}} of criticism against Beyonce's particular brand of feminism. Many critics argue that Beyonce is part of the hyper sexualization of women in the pop industry since the 90's, something that occurred largely in sync with the explosion of the <b>porn</b> industry. Beyond this, some feminist critics argue that Beyonce fuels a culture of post-feminism. With songs like Girls (Who Run the World), Beyonce creates a mindset - particularly among teenage girls - that women are already outdoing men in every aspect of life. When the reality is, these critics say, there are still vast gender inequalities that keep them from doing so. The danger of post-feminism is that while they still exist, young people lack the language to label these inequalities as sexism.|$|E
5|$|Poole and Donovan {{had long}} {{wanted to make}} a sequel to Boys in the Sand. In 1984, they finally shot Boys in the Sand II. Also filmed on Fire Island, the film {{featured}} Donovan, the only cast member from the original to return. The original opening sequence, Bayside, was recreated for the sequel, with Pat Allen performing the run from the water. Litigation tied up the release of Boys in the Sand II until 1986 and {{with the advent of the}} home video market, there was a glut of gay <b>porn</b> titles available. Boys in the Sand II did not distinguish itself from the competition and was not particularly successful.|$|E
5|$|Some bathhouses have areas {{designed}} to facilitate impersonal sex. These areasrooms or hallwaysare illuminated {{only by a}} (dim) red exit sign. It is possible to have sex, but not to see with whom. Other bathhouses, such as the Continental Baths in New York or the Club Baths in Washington, D.C., have two or more bunkbeds in close proximity, in a public area. This provides a place to have sex for those who could afford only a locker, and facilitated exhibitionism and voyeurism for those so inclined. Baths often have a (<b>porn)</b> TV room or snack bar where patrons can recuperate between orgasms.|$|E
5|$|The group {{recorded}} with Finn {{over a period}} of three months at numerous locations in their hometown of San Diego and in Los Angeles. Finn was key in producing the fast-paced, melodic mixes, creating pop punk with a more radio-friendly, accessible polish. Lyrically, the album is inspired by adolescent frustration and relationships. Guitarist Tom DeLonge and bassist Mark Hoppus primarily culled stories from friends and autobiographical situations to craft summery tracks revolving around breakups, suburban parties and maturity, as well as more offbeat subject matter such as UFO conspiracy theories. The cover artwork for Enema of the State features <b>porn</b> star Janine Lindemulder famously clad in a nurse uniform, and the title is a pun on the term enemy of the state.|$|E
5|$|As {{the family}} gathers around the {{television}} {{to watch the}} local news, Lois states her fondness of the new co-anchor, Joyce Kinney. Later that day, the family attends church, and while there, Lois learns of a local bake sale, and decides to bring her own baked goods. Going to the store to buy ingredients, Lois notices Joyce shopping there as well, and approaches her. The two quickly become close friends, and they decide {{to spend the day}} together at the news studio. That night, Lois and Joyce decide to get a drink together, and share stories. Reluctant at first to tell Joyce her darkest secret, she soon reveals that she was in a <b>porn</b> film when she was in college in the early 1980s, before she met Peter. Expecting Joyce will keep it a secret, as she promised, she is shocked when the local news reveals her participation in the making of the pornography, and Lois is made a social outcast.|$|E
5|$|With massive {{radio and}} video play, Blink-182 played to larger crowds {{when they began}} touring in support of Enema of the State. The Loserkids Tour {{commenced}} {{in the autumn of}} 1999 and was the band's first arena tour. The band was forced to postpone remaining dates of a spring European tour in 2000 when both DeLonge and Barker came down with strep throat. The band played to sold-out audiences and performed worldwide during the summer of 2000 on The Mark, Tom and Travis Show Tour. The tour was staged as a drive-in movie, with a giant retro billboard suspended from the ceiling, and films were projected on the screen behind the band– including vintage gay <b>porn</b> as a joke. The tour {{was one of the most}} anticipated rock tours of the season and the band headed out on the road with Bad Religion and Fenix TX. Barker broke one of his fingers during an altercation with two men who kept flirting with his girlfriend in Ohio, and Damon Delapaz, guitarist of Fenix TX, stepped in on drums for Barker. Hoppus recalled an overwhelming emotional feeling when the band sold out the Great Western Forum in Los Angeles.|$|E
5|$|Divine {{considered}} {{himself to be}} male, and was not transgender or transsexual. He was gay, and during the 1980s had an extended relationship with a married man named Lee, who accompanied him almost everywhere that he went. They later separated, and Divine went on to have a brief affair with gay <b>porn</b> star Leo Ford, which was widely reported upon by the gay press. According to his manager Bernard Jay, Divine regularly engaged in sexual activities with young men that he would meet while on tour, sometimes becoming infatuated with them; in one case, he met {{a young man in}} Israel whom he wanted to bring back to the United States, but was prevented from doing so by Jay. This image of promiscuity was disputed by his friend Anne Cersosimo, who claimed that Divine never exhibited such behavior when on tour. Divine initially avoided informing the media about his sexuality, even when questioned by interviewers, and would sometimes hint that he was bisexual, but {{in the latter part of}} the 1980s changed this attitude and began being open about his homosexuality. Nonetheless, he avoided discussing gay rights, partially at the advice of his manager, realizing that it would have had a negative effect on his career.|$|E

25|$|Many boys {{learn to}} assume that the things women do in pornhow they dress and act around menis also how women are {{supposed}} to act in real life. These same boys are learning to expect girls their own age to act like the women in <b>porn</b> videos, too...Social media and Internet <b>porn</b> are influencing junior-high and high-school girls' understanding of sexiness. Girls are learning to use <b>porn</b> and <b>porn</b> archetypes to impress boys as early as middle school.|$|E
25|$|The website endrevengeporn.org, {{founded by}} Holly Jacobs, a revenge <b>porn</b> victim, campaigns for the criminalization of revenge <b>porn</b> and {{considers}} {{it to be}} a form of sexual abuse. Jacobs is also the founder of the Cyber Civil Rights Initiative (CCRI), a nonprofit organization that seeks to challenge cyber harassment. Danielle Citron, known for her discourse on cyber harassment as a civil rights issue, is an advisor for the CCRI. Mary Anne Franks, CCRI's Vice-President and Legislative & Tech Policy Director, has been heavily involved with legislative and policy efforts to combat revenge <b>porn.</b> Dr. Laura Hilly and Kira Allmann of the Oxford Human Rights Hub have characterized revenge <b>porn</b> as a kind of gendered hate speech designed to silence women. An article of theirs argues that this stifling of free expression is often ignored in debates over revenge <b>porn.</b>|$|E
25|$|Some {{scholars}} have published analyses of torture <b>porn</b> films. For example, a book chronicling the torture <b>porn</b> phenomenon {{and the surrounding}} controversy – Steve Jones' Torture Porn: Popular Horror after Saw – was published in 2013.|$|E
25|$|Some {{state that}} gay male <b>porn</b> {{generally}} pays men {{much more than}} heterosexual <b>porn.</b> Men who identify themselves as heterosexual but perform in gay pornography are said to do gay-for-pay. This means they perform in gay movies only for the paycheck.|$|E
25|$|Grey {{has been}} an {{advocate}} for the adult industry and defended her choice to be a <b>porn</b> actress. In a March 2014 interview, she spoke {{in defense of the}} industry and on behalf of outed Duke University student turned <b>porn</b> star, Belle Knox.|$|E

25|$|Some {{free speech}} advocates object to revenge <b>porn</b> laws on First Amendment grounds, citing {{the fact that}} US laws restricting {{expression}} {{have a history of}} being overturned.

25|$|States without {{specific}} laws about revenge <b>porn</b> {{have seen}} lawsuits alleging invasion of privacy, public disclosure of private fact and intentional infliction of emotional distress against {{the individuals who}} uploaded the images.
