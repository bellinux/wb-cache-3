40|$|Abstract. To {{investigate}} the seismic behavior of {{autoclaved aerated concrete}} (AAC) <b>roof</b> <b>panels,</b> the bending experiment of 4 AAC slabs for estimating the deflection and moment capacity was made. All specimens were placed under a test frame using monotonically increasing load till failure. The experimental {{results indicated that the}} stiffness and load-carrying capacity of AAC panels can meet the requirements of the <b>roof</b> <b>panel.</b> Reinforced AAC <b>roof</b> <b>panels,</b> which serve as a substitute for normal one can be used efficiently to provide a structure‟s horizontal diaphragm system while supporting the necessary gravity loads. The study in this paper can provide a reliable experimental basis for further analysis and engineering application of AAC <b>roof</b> <b>panels</b> in the future...|$|R

5000|$|In 2001, a {{permanent}} venue was finally constructed {{on the site}} of the old Anhalter Bahnhof, which had been demolished in 1960. While a small section of the old station façade was retained (and is still standing), the entire train shed was removed, leaving a large open area. The new Tempodrom was erected in the center of this area, with a playing field lying between it and the façade remnant, and a wooded area extending in the other direction towards the Landwehr Canal. The firm of Von Garkan, Marg und Partner (GMP) was retained to design the new building. The basic floor plan is square, accommodating three performance spaces as well as a bistro and various offices and restrooms, underneath a wooden-floored terrace which hosts a beer garden in season. The two arenas are both circular, with the larger, centrally located space covered by a 37 m steel and concrete <b>panel</b> <b>roof</b> intended to echo the form of the tents of the original site. This space can accommodate 3,800 patrons; the smaller arena seats 400. The third space is the [...] "Liquidrom", a Thermal Bath / Spa establishment featuring a 43 ft diameter salt water bath fitted with underwater speakers to provide a multi-sensory spa experience, 3 saunas ranging from 55, 80 and 90 Celsius temperatures, a steam bath room along with various massage services. The 135000 sqfoot m2 building was completed in 2002 at a cost of $34,000,000, over twice the original budget. Scandal over the overruns led to the resignation of State Senator [...] who was in charge of the Urban Development department.|$|E

40|$|A {{series of}} studies have been {{undertaken}} to quantify potential steelwork and embodied carbon savings in single-storey industrial buildings with long span sandwich <b>panel</b> <b>roof</b> cladding. It was found that trussed-roof frames with north lights offer the greatest potential steelwork saving (38 %- 60 %) against traditional portal frame construction when used with long span panels. However, {{in order to achieve}} the necessary span between adjacent frames, the structural performance of the sandwich panels needed to be improved. A subsequent study was undertaken to develop revised specifications for long span roof sandwich panels to increase their spanning capability, while minimizing the increase in embodied carbon. The mechanical resistance of the panels was evaluated using a combination of theoretical analysis and structural testing and a Pareto-optimal set of solutions was found. Finally, the optimized structure-envelope assembly was reviewed holistically in terms of its embodied carbon. The results showed that savings of up to 7. 3 % may be achieved for the frame when compared against traditional portal frame construction...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the last}} few years, {{reverberation}} times and sound pressure levels have been measured in many sports halls. Most of these halls, for instance those made from stony materials, perform as predicted. However, sports halls constructed with profiled perforated steel roof panels have an unexpected very low reverberation time in the 125 and 250 Hz octave bands. The {{aim of this study}} was to provide an explanation for this low-frequency anomaly. A 1 : 20 scale model of a sports hall was constructed and placed in a small anechoic chamber. The roof could be equipped with differing ceiling types: a flat non-absorbing ceiling, a flat absorbing ceiling, two different profiled non-absorbing ceilings and a profiled absorbing ceiling. With a spark sound source and a small microphone, the impulse-response of the scale model could be registered and analysed. Moreover, a Matlab model was constructed to simulate the acoustic behaviour of the sports hall. This model included the ‘ground effect’ of the roof surface, an effect typically not included in commercial ray-tracing programs. The measurements and the simulations showed that the high sound absorption values of a perforated <b>panel</b> <b>roof</b> structure at 125 and 250 Hz can be (partly) explained by its shape. The diffusing properties of the corrugated roof have an effect similar to sound absorption. Because the roof is the largest absorbing surface in a sports hall, this effect can have a significant effect on the low-frequency reverberation time. Accepted Author ManuscriptBuilding Physic...|$|E
40|$|AbstractLightweight insulations, as a Thermal Reflective Multi-layer System (TRMS), are a {{fast and}} useful answer for {{temporary}} shelter. Developed from a space suit {{and with a}} conductivity of 0, 038 W/mK, this system can ensure high thermal performance in combination with an easy transport, assembly and modular design. The present paper highlight {{the potential of the}} use of this material in different experimental shelter, as building component: the case of the Scaffold House and Cardboard Shelters. The combination of TRMS building elements is a technological skin, which is constitute from modular panels made by TRM, polyester and vulcanized rubber, called Air Shelter House (ASH). The Scaffold House is made by scaffold, traditional TRMS and sandwich panels. It is a modular system easy to assembly thanks to the simple technology used, which can help the self-construction and maintenance by the users. To improve the processes of housing installation, ensuring thermal performance, the envelope is changing with a new composition of ASH system and sandwich panels. In this way, it is possible to increase the construction processes and deconstruction, in agreement with internal comfort, modularity of units, transport and possible reuse of the shelter in different contest. The plurality of plants functions (as a private house or as a public use), already studied for the internal disposition of the different modules, are still guaranteed from the small thickness of 65 mm of the ASH technology.
