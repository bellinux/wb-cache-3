From 1952, the higher powered EW class locomotives were the preferred locomotive for use on <b>passenger</b> <b>trains</b> and for use on this line because of the gradients and curves. ED locomotives {{were found to be}} hard on the track and not suitable for <b>passenger</b> <b>trains</b> but were however still seen hauling some goods trains and shunting services, and occasionally <b>passenger</b> <b>trains.</b>|$|R
