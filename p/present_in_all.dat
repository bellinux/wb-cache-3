5|$|Adequate {{potassium}} intake {{is achieved}} by eating a variety of foods. Potassium is <b>present</b> <b>in</b> <b>all</b> fruits, vegetables, meat and fish. Foods with high potassium concentrations include yam, parsley, dried apricots, milk, chocolate, all nuts (especially almonds and pistachios), potatoes, bamboo shoots, bananas, avocados, coconut water, soybeans, and bran. Dried apricots have the highest concentration of potassium by weight of any food. Many processed foods contain no potassium.|$|E

However, this surge causes the plasma potassium to rise only 10% at most {{as a result of}} prompt and efficient clearance by both renal and extra-renal mechanisms.|$|E
5|$|D mode is <b>present</b> <b>in</b> <b>all</b> graphite-like carbons and {{originates}} from structural defects. Therefore, {{the ratio}} of the G/D modes is conventionally used to quantify the structural quality of carbon nanotubes. High-quality nanotubes have this ratio significantly higher than 100. At a lower functionalisation of the nanotube, the G/D ratio remains almost unchanged. This ratio gives an idea of the functionalisation of a nanotube.|$|E

5|$|A {{striking}} {{feature of}} metabolism is {{the similarity of}} the basic metabolic pathways and components between even vastly different species.

These striking similarities in metabolic pathways are likely due to their early appearance in evolutionary history, and their retention because of their efficacy.|$|E

5|$|As {{early as}} the 1920s Antoine Lacassagne, using {{polonium}} provided by his colleague Marie Curie, showed that the element has a specific pattern of uptake in rabbit tissues, with high concentrations, particularly in liver, kidney, and testes. More recent evidence suggests that this behavior results from polonium substituting for its congener sulfur, also in group 16 of the periodic table, in sulfur-containing amino-acids or related molecules and that similar patterns of distribution occur in human tissues. Polonium is indeed an element naturally <b>present</b> <b>in</b> <b>all</b> humans, contributing appreciably to natural background dose, with wide geographical and cultural variations, and particularly high levels in arctic residents, for example.|$|E
5|$|Because of its {{extremely}} bird-like {{anatomy and}} close relationship to other dromaeosaurids, paleontologists hypothesize that Deinonychus was probably covered in feathers. Clear fossil evidence of modern avian-style feathers exists for several related dromaeosaurids, including Velociraptor and Microraptor, though no direct evidence is yet known for Deinonychus itself. When conducting studies of {{such areas as}} the range of motion in the forelimbs, paleontologists like Phil Senter have taken the likely presence of wing feathers (as <b>present</b> <b>in</b> <b>all</b> known dromaeosaurs with skin impressions) into consideration.|$|E
5|$|Connective tissues are fibrous {{and made}} up of cells {{scattered}} among inorganic material called the extracellular matrix. Connective tissue gives shape to organs and holds them in place. The main types are loose connective tissue, adipose tissue, fibrous connective tissue, cartilage and bone. The extracellular matrix contains proteins, the chief and most abundant of which is collagen. Collagen plays a major part in organizing and maintaining tissues. The matrix can be modified to form a skeleton to support or protect the body. An exoskeleton is a thickened, rigid cuticle which is stiffened by mineralization, as in crustaceans or by the cross-linking of its proteins as in insects. An endoskeleton is internal and <b>present</b> <b>in</b> <b>all</b> developed animals, {{as well as in}} many of those less developed.|$|E

A custom night DLC is also available for Sister Location. The third game does not feature any night after the sixth, while the fourth game includes a seventh and eighth night, neither of which are customizable. The fifth game is currently the only game with only five nights, if the custom night DLC is not included.|$|E
5|$|Historically, {{the spotted}} hyena was {{widespread}} throughout Sub-Saharan Africa. It is <b>present</b> <b>in</b> <b>all</b> habitats {{save for the}} most extreme desert conditions, tropical rainforests {{and the top of}} alpine mountains. Its current distribution is patchy in many places, especially in West Africa. Populations are concentrated in protected areas and surrounding land. There is a continuous distribution over large areas of Ethiopia, Kenya, Tanzania, Botswana, Namibia and the Transvaal Lowveld areas of South Africa. During the 1770s and 1780s the species was still widespread in southern and western South Africa, being recorded i.a. on the Cape Peninsula and Cape Flats, and near present-day Somerset West, Riviersonderend, Mossel Bay, George, Joubertina, Gamtoos River, Jansenville, Cannon Rocks, Alice, Onseepkans and Augrabies Falls.|$|E

Multiplayer games can be played with only one DS game card: each player can pass the game to the next player when it is their turn. It is also possible to set all sides to CPU, which is useful for studying the AI.|$|E

The rostral bone and flared jugals are already <b>present</b> <b>in</b> <b>all</b> of these forms, indicating that even earlier ceratopsians remain to be discovered.|$|E
5|$|In {{different}} eras, various gods {{were said}} to hold the highest position in divine society, including the solar deity Ra, the mysterious god Amun, and the mother goddess Isis. The highest deity was usually credited {{with the creation of}} the world and often connected with the life-giving power of the sun. Some scholars have argued, based in part on Egyptian writings, that the Egyptians came to recognize a single divine power that lay behind all things and was <b>present</b> <b>in</b> <b>all</b> the other deities. Yet they never abandoned their original polytheistic view of the world, except possibly during the era of Atenism in the 14th century BC, when official religion focused exclusively on the impersonal sun god Aten.|$|E

Some jumpscares, including those of Golden Freddy, Nightmare, and Nightmarionne, consist of a single screen supplemented with shrill, distorted audio. These jumpscares usually crash or restart the game. The player can utilise the tools listed above to prevent attacks, thus preventing any jumpscares from occurring.|$|E

5|$|Reports {{of severe}} and even fatal {{hepatotoxicity}} {{related to the}} use of methoxyflurane began to appear in 1966. These reports prompted anesthesiologists to subject this agent to intense and systematic scrutiny. A study published in 1973 by Cousins and Mazze demonstrated that compared with halothane, methoxyflurane produces dose-dependent and deleterious abnormalities in renal function. The authors showed that subclinical nephrotoxicity occurred following methoxyflurane at minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) for 2.5 to 3hours (2.5 to 3MAC hours), while overt toxicity was <b>present</b> <b>in</b> <b>all</b> patients at dosages greater than five MAC hours. This landmark study provided a model that would be used for the assessment of the nephrotoxicity of volatile anesthetics for the next two decades.|$|E
5|$|TCDD and dioxin-like {{compounds}} act via {{a specific}} receptor <b>present</b> <b>in</b> <b>all</b> cells: the aryl hydrocarbon (AH) receptor. This receptor is a transcription factor which {{is involved in}} expression of genes; in fact {{it has been shown}} that high doses of TCDD either increase or decrease the expression of several hundred genes in rats. Genes of enzymes activating the breakdown of foreign and often toxic compounds are classic examples of such genes. TCDD increases the enzymes breaking down, e.g., carcinogenic polycyclic hydrocarbons such as benzo(a)pyrene.|$|E

The active site of thioredoxin {{consists of two}} neighboring cysteines, {{as part of a}} highly conserved CXXC motif, that can cycle between an active dithiol form (reduced) and an oxidized disulfide form. In its active state, thioredoxin acts as an efficient reducing agent, scavenging reactive oxygen species and maintaining other proteins in their reduced state. After being oxidized, the active thioredoxin is regenerated by the action of thioredoxin reductase, using NADPH as an electron donor.|$|E
