5|$|Transfer-messenger RNA (tmRNA) {{is found}} in many {{bacteria}} and plastids. It tags proteins encoded by mRNAs that lack stop codons for degradation and <b>prevents</b> <b>the</b> ribosome from stalling.|$|E
5|$|While the Self-Incrimination Clause {{primarily}} implicates the law {{of criminal}} investigations, the Clause also protects against self-incrimination that may occur at trial. Plainly, the Clause <b>prevents</b> <b>the</b> government from compelling the defendant to testify against himself or herself at trial. Further, if the defendant chooses to testify, the Clause <b>prevents</b> <b>the</b> state from requiring her to testify first. But, if the defendant testifies, she cannot claim the privilege against self-incrimination with respect to cross-examination {{within the scope of}} the direct examination.|$|E

5|$|An alloy of {{aluminium}} and gallium in pellet form added to {{water can be}} used to generate hydrogen. The process also produces alumina, but the expensive gallium, which <b>prevents</b> <b>the</b> formation of an oxide skin on the pellets, can be re-used. This has important potential implications for a hydrogen economy, as hydrogen can be produced on-site and {{does not need to be}} transported.|$|E
5|$|Aphthous-like {{ulceration}} also {{occurs in}} conditions involving systemic immuno-dysregulation, e.g. cyclic neutropenia and {{human immunodeficiency virus}} infection. In cyclic neutropenia, more severe oral ulceration occurs during periods of severe immuno-dysregulation, and resolution of the underlying neutropenia <b>prevents</b> <b>the</b> cycle of ulceration. The relative increase in percentage of CD8+ T cells, caused by a reduction in numbers of CD4+ T cells may be implicated in RAS-type ulceration in HIV infection.|$|E
5|$|Disulfiram (Antabuse) <b>prevents</b> <b>the</b> {{elimination}} of acetaldehyde, a chemical the body produces when breaking down ethanol. Acetaldehyde {{itself is the}} cause of many hangover symptoms from alcohol use. The overall effect is severe discomfort when alcohol is ingested: an extremely fast-acting and long-lasting uncomfortable hangover. This discourages an alcoholic from drinking in significant amounts while they take the medicine.|$|E
50|$|Generally, {{marriage}} bars can {{be classified}} as <b>the</b> “hire bar” <b>preventing</b> <b>the</b> hiring of married women, and <b>the</b> “retain bar” <b>preventing</b> <b>the</b> retention of married workers.|$|R

5|$|Indoor netball is a {{variation}} of netball, played exclusively indoors, in which the playing court is surrounded on each side and overhead by a net. The net <b>prevents</b> <b>the</b> ball from leaving the court, permitting faster play by reducing playing stoppages.|$|E
5|$|The {{presence}} (as at 2010) of two breeding {{pairs of}} wild peregrine falcons (nesting {{one in each}} of the telescope's two support towers) <b>prevents</b> <b>the</b> nuisance of pigeon infestation (by droppings fouling, and their body heat affecting sensitive instrument readings) that some other radio telescopes suffer from.|$|E
5|$|What the {{transfer}} really did was {{ensure that the}} files would {{be placed in the}} CIA's operational records, a records system that—due to the 1986 CIA Operational Files exemption—is not subject to the FOIA and is a black hole for anyone trying to access the files within. The move <b>prevents</b> <b>the</b> public from accessing the official record about the raid, and bypasses several important federal records keeping procedures in the process.|$|E

5|$|When {{specimens}} are to {{be placed}} in any size of container for long-term storage or display, the consistent use of only archival-quality materials <b>prevents</b> <b>the</b> development of Byne's disease. Thus, materials such as metal cabinets and display cases, archival quality paper labels and card trays are used in museum collections of specimens that might be vulnerable to this reaction.|$|E
5|$|A common {{subdivision}} system of E. coli, but {{not based on}} evolutionary relatedness, is by serotype, {{which is based on}} major surface antigens (O antigen: part of lipopolysaccharide layer; H: flagellin; K antigen: capsule), e.g. O157:H7). It is, however, common to cite only the serogroup, i.e. the O-antigen. At present, about 190 serogroups are known. The common laboratory strain has a mutation that <b>prevents</b> <b>the</b> formation of an O-antigen and is thus not typeable.|$|E
5|$|Baris stubbornly holds Kirk {{responsible}} for this apparent fiasco, and Koloth additionally demands an apology from Kirk after some of the Enterprise crew are provoked into a brawl with the Klingons in the station's bar. However, the tribbles reveal {{the identity of a}} Klingon agent masquerading as a human: Arne Darvin (Charlie Brill), Baris' own assistant. He had infected the grain with a virus that becomes an inert material in an organism's bloodstream which eventually <b>prevents</b> <b>the</b> organism from taking in enough nourishment to survive.|$|E
5000|$|Vundo may {{attempt to}} <b>prevent</b> <b>the</b> user from {{removing}} it or otherwise impede its operation, such as by disabling the task manager, registry editor, and msconfig, thereby <b>preventing</b> <b>the</b> system from booting into safe mode.|$|R
60|$|If {{a war to}} <b>prevent</b> Louis <b>the</b> Fourteenth from {{imposing}} {{his religion}} was just, a war to <b>prevent</b> <b>the</b> murderers of Louis the Sixteenth from imposing their irreligion upon us is just: a war to <b>prevent</b> <b>the</b> operation of a system which makes life without dignity and death without hope is a just war.|$|R
50|$|MSCs {{can promote}} neuroprotection in the CNS of {{patients}} with MS which may <b>prevent</b> <b>the</b> progression of the disease to chronic disability. MSCs contribute to neuroprotection through several different mechanisms. These mechanisms include inhibiting apoptosis which will <b>prevent</b> <b>the</b> death of healthy cells and prevent gliosis which will <b>prevent</b> <b>the</b> formation of a glial scar. They can also stimulate local progenitor cells to produce replacement cells that can assist in rebuilding the myelin sheath.|$|R
5|$|Believing {{that their}} next target is a water-filtration plant near Navy Pier, Fisher infiltrates the Engineers and <b>prevents</b> <b>the</b> {{release of a}} {{biological}} toxin into the water supply. Kobin then tells him that mercenary supplier Reza Nouri may be allied with the Engineers. Sam assaults Nouri's mansion, capturing him for questioning. When he learns about an Engineer sleeper cell in London, Fisher infiltrates an abandoned mill and discovers chemical bombs in a shipping bay. Opening a bomb to plant a tracking device, he is exposed to nerve gas. Incapacitated and apparently dying, Fisher is captured by Sadiq and rescued by Briggs; in the ensuing confrontation, Sadiq escapes while Briggs provides first aid to Sam.|$|E
5|$|Bran Stark, Meera Reed, and Benjen Stark arrive {{near the}} Wall. Benjen takes his leave, {{stating that the}} Wall's magical {{protection}} <b>prevents</b> <b>the</b> dead (and therefore, him) {{from being able to}} pass. Meera assists Bran to a weirwood tree and he re-enters the vision of Eddard Stark at the Tower of Joy. Ned finds his sister Lyanna Stark covered in blood from childbirth. With her dying breath, Lyanna pleads with Ned {{to take care of her}} son, who is revealed to be Jon Snow.|$|E
5|$|Butterfly {{eggs are}} {{protected}} by a hard-ridged outer layer of shell, called the chorion. This is lined with a thin coating of wax which <b>prevents</b> <b>the</b> egg from drying out before the larva has had time to fully develop. Each egg contains a number of tiny funnel-shaped openings at one end, called micropyles; {{the purpose of these}} holes is to allow sperm to enter and fertilize the egg. Butterfly eggs vary greatly in size and shape between species, but are usually upright and finely sculptured. Some species lay eggs singly, others in batches. Many females produce between one hundred and two hundred eggs.|$|E
50|$|McEvoy {{played a}} key role in the {{unsuccessful}} effort to <b>prevent</b> <b>the</b> closure of Saint Mary's Hospital in New Westminster in 2004. He wrote a book about the history of the hospital and the public campaign to <b>prevent</b> <b>the</b> closure, The Life and Destruction of Saint Mary's Hospital (Harbour Publishing, 2008).|$|R

5000|$|During {{periods of}} war and bubonic plague, villages were often burned down, so to <b>prevent</b> <b>the</b> {{collapse}} of the upper floors, ground floors were built of stone and upper floors built in half-timberings to <b>prevent</b> <b>the</b> spread of fire.|$|R
5|$|Chromium metal left {{standing}} in air is passivated by oxidation, forming a thin, protective, surface layer. This layer is a spinel structure {{only a few}} molecules thick. It is very dense, and <b>prevents</b> <b>the</b> diffusion of oxygen into the underlying metal. This {{is different from the}} oxide that forms on iron and carbon steel, through which elemental oxygen continues to migrate, reaching the underlying material to cause incessant rusting. Passivation can be enhanced by short contact with oxidizing acids like nitric acid. Passivated chromium is stable against acids. Passivation can be removed with a strong reducing agent that destroys the protective oxide layer on the metal. Chromium metal treated in this way readily dissolves in weak acids.|$|E
5|$|Counter-illumination means {{producing}} {{light to}} match a background that is brighter than an animal's body or military vehicle; it {{is a form}} of active camouflage. It is notably used by some species of squid, such as the firefly squid and the midwater squid. The latter has light-producing organs (photophores) scattered all over its underside; these create a sparkling glow that <b>prevents</b> <b>the</b> animal from appearing as a dark shape when seen from below. Counterillumination camouflage is the likely function of the bioluminescence of many marine organisms, though light is also produced to attract or to detect prey and for signalling.|$|E
5|$|Few Myxogastria {{species are}} found in the tropics and subtropics, mainly because of the high {{humidity}} which <b>prevents</b> <b>the</b> necessary dehydration of the fruit bodies to permit spore dispersal and promotes infestation by moulds. Other factors are low light levels under the forest canopy which reduces phototaxis, light winds, poor soils, natural enemies and heavy rainfall which can wash away or destroy cells. Species living in soil or deadwood decrease as humidity increases. In a study from Costa Rica, 73% of the total findings were in the relatively dry Tropical Moist Forest, while 18% were in the very moist Tropical Premontane Wet Forests and only 9% in Lower Premontane Rain Forest.|$|E

50|$|In addition, {{because the}} colloid is {{relatively}} impervious to water, a slurry wall can <b>prevent</b> <b>the</b> seepage of groundwater, which {{is useful in}} <b>preventing</b> <b>the</b> further spread of groundwater that has been contaminated by toxic material such as industrial waste.|$|R
