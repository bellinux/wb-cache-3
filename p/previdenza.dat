25|$|A {{wide range}} of social reforms were carried out during Moro's periods as prime minister. The 1967 Ponte Law (Legge Ponte) {{introduced}} urgent housing provisions {{as part of an}} envisioned reform of the entire sector, such as the introduction of minimum standards for housing and environment. A law promulgated on 14 December 1963 introduced an annual allowance for university students with income below a given level. Another law, promulgated on 10 March 1968, introduced voluntary public pre-elementary education for children aged three to five years. A law promulgated on 21 July 1965 introduced new pension provisions under the general scheme. The legal minima was raised, all current pensions were revalued, seniority pensions (pensioni d’anzianità) were introduced (after 35 years of contributions workers could retire even before attaining pensionable age), and within the national social security institution (Istituto nazionale della <b>previdenza</b> sociale), a Social Fund (Fondo Sociale) was established, ensuring to all members pensioners a basic uniform pension largely financed by state, known as the social pension (not related to the later social pension introduced in 1968). A law of 22 July 1966 extended pension insurance to small traders. A law of 22 July 1966 extended health insurance to retired traders, and a law of 29 May 1967 extended compulsory health insurance to retired farmers, tenant farmers, and sharecroppers, and extended health insurance to the unemployed in receipt of unemployment benefits. A law of 18 March 1968 introduced the principle of earnings-related pensions within the general scheme, with the pension formula to equal 1.626% of average earnings in the last 3 years of work multiplied by the number of contribution years (maximum pension: 65% of previous earnings) up to 40. A law of 5 November 1968 extended family allowances to the unemployed in receipt of unemployment benefits.|$|E

40|$|In October and November 2014, a green facade {{was built}} on an office {{building}} owned by the National Institute of Social Insurance (Istituto Nazionale di <b>Previdenza</b> Sociale) in Genoa’s Sestri Ponente district, an area characterized by relatively high population density (13, 000 inhabitants/km 2). As in many Italian cities, Sestri Ponente has high rates of air pollution, and the Department of Sciences for Architecture at the University of Genoa (Italy) is conducting monitoring activities in collaboration with RSE SpA (Research on Energy System) {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} of the facade in summer cooling, winter heating, air quality improvement, and economic and environmental sustainability. A sociological survey of local residents and employees who work in the building on their perceptions of the green facade is also under development. This monitoring includes surveys before and after the installation of the facade to evaluate if the introduction of foreign elements has destabilizing effects in the context of the domestic environment. This article discusses the results of the survey done before the implementation of the green facade. Other surveys will be carried out in subsequent months in order to understand if the experience of prolonged contact with this new “presence” has changed citizens’ perception...|$|E
40|$|The {{sampling}} procedure {{presented in this}} paper was used to collect panel data and {{it is based on the}} following rotation design. The panel life of the sample elements corresponds to their natural life. At different points of time, the deaths and outmigrants leave the panel; new elements are added, selecting them from the births and immigrants. Therefore, the rotation depends on “random” natural events, such as births and deaths, immigration and outmigration. The resulting panel should incorporate the target population dynamics and increase its representativeness. The unmatched and matched portions of successive samples provide estimates of the births, y(bt), and the continuing population, y(mt). In the matched portion, the doublesampling regression estimate is generally used, y’(mt). The best combined estimate of Y(t) is found by weighting y’(bt) and y’(mt) inversely as their variances (Cochran, 1977; Patterson, 1950). If y(bt) is systematically lower than y’(mt), then the doublesampling regression estimate does not work well. Alternative weights are the proportions of the births and the total units of population at time t. The matched portion may be estimated by a simple autoreressive model. This sampling design was applied to the administrative data of the National Institute of Social Security (INPS: Istituto Nazionale della <b>Previdenza</b> Sociale) for the years from 1982 to 1988, relative to the Province of Modena. The estimates of the population mean, total, and unit seemed to be satisfactory, as did their variances...|$|E
30|$|In {{order to}} compute the Kaitz index, i.e. {{the level of the}} minimum wage {{compared}} to the median wage, the sectoral minimum wage data are then matched by NACE two-digit codes to individual wage data from the Italian Labour Force Survey (LFS) between 2008 and 2015. The LFS collects net wage data, and therefore in order to make individual wage data comparable with ISTAT minimum wage data, LFS net wages are converted to gross wages using income tax rate and social security contributions (as a % of net wages) for different levels of the average wage (from 1 to 200 %) {{in the case of a}} single person without children from the OECD TaxBen model. We assume that this is the effective tax rate for all workers each month before tax adjustments and transfers done at the end of the year to take into account family composition and household total income. Individual wage data are further inflated to add the 13 th and 14 th months in sectors that also have to include a 13 th (all sectors) and a 14 th month (around 40 % of the agreements in the sample). Finally, only employees are considered (apprentices and domestic workers are excluded but also co.co.pro, casual work, and the like because of missing wage data in the LFS). Since LFS data may suffer from measurement error (more on this in the next section on the estimation of non-compliance), we also match the wage floors data to an employers’ survey and the Structure of Earnings Survey and to administrative data from the Italian National Social Security Institute (Istituto Nazionale della <b>Previdenza</b> Sociale—henceforth INPS). The pros and cons of these datasets and their specific features are discussed in the next section.|$|E
40|$|In {{striking}} {{contrast with}} the majority of other European economies, the UK pension system does not pose problems of financial sustainability to public finances. Public expenditure for pensions is foreseen to remain relatively stable for the next 50 years, around 5 percent of GDP, thanks to the considerable stock of privately-funded, actuarially-fair pension provision accumulated by the country, thus making the system (in governmentÂ’s words) Â“a fair deal between generationsÂ”. Nonetheless, an intense debate is under way on the alleged crisis of the pension system, resulting not only from the private cost but also from the level of the benefits. The debate encompasses both the demand and the supply side of the pension system. On the one hand, the discussion focuses on the allegedly inadequate level of national savings, particularly by the population on lowest income, which would not produce in the future a level of pension high enough to guarantee an appropriate standard of living in retirement. On the other hand, the fall in equities in the period 2000 - 02 highlighted the fact that one of the main characteristics of the system, the prevalence of defined-benefit occupational pension funds, would act as a transmission channel of equity market shocks to the corporate sector of the economy. Moreover, {{in the light of the}} major role played by life assurances in the supply of pension products and growing interlinkages between the banking and insurance sectors, the financial soundness of life assurances takes on a particular relevance for the stability of the financial system as a whole. The present work illustrates the structural characteristics and significant peculiarities of the UK pension system, with particular emphasis on the evolution of pension savings in the private sector. Furthermore, it surveys the main aspects of the current debate and the different measures put forward as possible solutions. With reference to Italy, the UK experience may constitute a source of meaningful reflections for the current debate on the evolution of private pensions. fondi pensione, <b>previdenza</b> privata, means-testing...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} is to {{estimate}} the pension costs incurred for patients with musculoskeletal disorders (MDs) and specifi cally with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and ankylosing spondylitis (AS) in Italy between 2009 and 2012. We analyzed the database of the Italian National Social Security Institute (Istituto Nazionale <b>Previdenza</b> Sociale i. e. INPS) to estimate the total costs of three types of social security benefi ts granted to patients with MDs, RA and AS: disability benefi ts (for people with reduced working ability), disability pensions (for people who cannot qualify as workers) and incapacity pensions (for people without working ability). We developed a probabilistic model with a Monte Carlo simulation to estimate the total costs for each type of benefi t associated with MDs, RA and AS. We also estimated the productivity loss resulting from RA in 2013. From 2009 to 2012 about 393 thousand treatments were paid for a total of approximately € 2. 7 billion. The annual number of treatments was on average 98 thousand and cost in total € 674 million per year. In particular, the total pension burden was about € 99 million for RA and € 26 million for AS. The productivity loss for AR in 2013 was equal to € 707, 425, 191 due to 9, 174, 221 working days lost. Our study is the fi rst to estimate the burden of social security pensions for MDs based on data of both approved claims and benefi ts paid by the national security system. From 2009 to 2012, in Italy, the highest indirect costs were associated with disability pensions (54 % of the total indirect cost), followed by disability benefi ts (44. 1 % of cost) and incapacity pensions (1. 8 % of cost). In conclusion, MDs are chronic and highly debilitating diseases with a strong female predominance and very signifi cant economic and social costs that are set to increase due to the aging of the population...|$|E
