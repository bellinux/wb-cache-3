40|$|In {{this paper}} are {{analyzed}} the genocide, the {{crimes against humanity}} and war crimes {{from the perspective of}} humanitarian law, in order to highlight the relevant aspects regarding the <b>non-applicability</b> <b>of</b> statutory limitations to these crimes. To obtain some efficient legal instruments of protecting human rights and fundamental freedoms, and preventing genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes, United Nations has established in the international law the "principle <b>of</b> <b>non-applicability</b> <b>of</b> statutory limitations to war crimes and crimes against humanity". A brief analysis is made on legislative acts adopted at European level which regulate the institution of the imprescriptibility of the aforementioned crimes, such as The Convention on the <b>Non-applicability</b> <b>of</b> Statutory Limitations to War Crimes and Crimes against Humanity, which was ratified by Romania by Decree no. 547 / 1969 (B. Of. No. 83 of 30 July 1969). The Convention contains references regarding the statute of limitations for criminal liability and enforcement of sentences. The analysis of the Convention is intended to highlight the importance of this European legislative act, since it was the first legal instrument of the international community, through which it was possible to ensure the protection of rights and fundamental freedoms beyond the sovereignty of states, thus representing a success and an innovation in international law...|$|R

The stay does not stop an eviction proceeding if the landlord has already obtained a judgment of possession prior to the bankruptcy case being filed, § 362(b)(22). The stay also would not apply in a situation where the eviction is based on “endangerment” of the rented property or “illegal use of controlled substances” on the property, § 362(b)(23). In either situation the landlord must file with the court and serve on the debtor a certificate <b>of</b> <b>non-applicability</b> <b>of</b> the stay spelling out the facts giving rise to one of the exceptions. There is a process for the debtor to contest the assertions in the landlord’s certificate or if state law gives the debtor an additional right to cure the default even after an order for possession is entered, § 362(l) & (m).|$|R

The class of solutions as obtained by Mazur and Mottola of a neutral gravastar Mazur 2001,Mazur 2004 have been observed as an alternative to D-dimensional versions of the Schwarzschild-Tangherlini black hole. To tackle the spherical system in a convenient way we have configured that the gravastar consists of three distinct regions with different equations of state as follows: [I] Interior region 0 ≤ r < r_ 1,ρ = -p, [II] Thin shell region r_ 1 ≤ r < r_ 2,ρ = p, and [III] Exterior region r_ 2 < r,ρ = p = 0.

40|$|Objectives: To {{assess the}} {{efficacy}} of a product containing isoflavones and other plant extracts (1310) on whole menopausal symptomatology and plasma lipids profile. Methods: Multicente, randomized, double blind, placebo controlled clinical investigation on 125 menopausal women randomly assigned to two groups treated for 6 months with placebo or one tablet daily of an herbal product containing 72 mg/dose of isoflavones of different plants origin and other plant extracts (1310). Primary end-point: Kupperman Menopause Index (KI) variations; secondary end-point: activity on plasma lipids profile and clinical global impression (CGI) on efficacy and tolerability by investigators and patients. The usual parametric test (paired Student t test) was performed to evaluate the significance. In case <b>of</b> <b>non-applicability</b> <b>of</b> parametric tests, the non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test was used. The differences where considered significant at p < 0. 05 level. Results: At the end of treatment in both groups KI showed a significant decrease (p < 0. 001). However, in the BIO group the KI reduction was significantly higher (p= 0. 0265) than {{in the placebo group}} after 4 and 6 months of treatment. In the BIO treated patients the LDL cholesterol showed a borderline but not significant reduction compared to placebo (p = 0. 0608) and triglyceride (TG) a significant (p = 0. 0151) decrease compared to placebo. The investigator's and patient's CGI on BIO group where superior as compared to placebo. Clinical tolerability was good in booth groups. Conclusion: On the basis of positive effects on HI and lipids profile as well as of good clinical tolerability, BIO can be considered one of the possible alternative therapy for conventional HRT.

40|$|The {{issue of}} sources of {{law has been}} a matter of {{considerable}} attention not only in legal theory and philosophy but also in positive law disciplines. Sources of law are commonly divided into substantive, formal and value-based sources. Depending on classifications suggested by different authors, general <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> law may fall into all three categories of sources <b>of</b> law. General <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> domestic law are rules covering a vast number of specific situations which are subsequently used as grounds for generating numerous norms regulating these situations in more detail. In international law, there are general <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> international law as well as legal principles recognized by civilized nations. General <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> the European Union law {{are an integral part of}} the positive EU legislation, which clearly differentiates them from similar sets of general goals, objectives, values, agenda postulates, and the like. The general <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> EU law are have their origins in the Founding Treaties, the legal systems of the Member States and the case law of the EU Court of Justice. Considering their content and legal nature, the general <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> EU law are divided into: compulsory or axiomatic principles, regulatory or structural principles (which all national laws of the Member States have in common), and the general principles inherent to the EU legal order. Some of the most important general <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> EU law are: the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> supremacy of EU law over the national law, the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> direct effect of EU law, the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> autonomy of EU law, the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> full effect of EU law, the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> State liability for damage, the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> legality, the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> legal certainty, the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> good faith and fair dealing, the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> fair hearing, the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> subsidiarity, the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> proportionality, the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> loyalty, the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> non-discrimination, etc...|$|R
