40|$|Abstract: In this paper, {{design and}} {{analysis}} of 8 Mb SRAM is described focusing on optimization of power and delay. The used technology is 90 nm. The access path of SRAM {{is divided into two}} parts: first is from address input to the word line rise (the row decoder) and second is from word line rise to data output. The key parameter for low power operation in SRAM data path is to reduce the signal swings on the high capacitance nodes i. e. bit lines and word line. Circuit partitioning, gate oxide thickness variations and low <b>power</b> <b>layout</b> techniques are used to minimize the power dissipation while designing SRAM. In this paper, 8 Mb SRAM is built up of two memory cuts, each of 4 Mb along with the control logic and the decoding sections. The main aim of this project is to minimize the power consumption. To reduce the power dissipation in active mode decoder is implemented as a tree structure while a multi Vth technique is used to reduce power in standby mode...|$|E

The advent of {{computers}} particularly mainframes and mini computers helped bring layout to the digital world of computers.

Layout editor's have moved mostly to the served world through the likes of Cadence Virtuoso and Mentor though some is still done through PC tools through tools such as L-Edit but sadly there is little choose from in the PC market though there are a few exceptions such as Magic and Klayout but these are mostly utilized for utility such as to view GDS files not fully <b>powered</b> <b>layout</b> editors as there once was in the 90's.|$|R

40|$|Abstract-This paper {{explores the}} {{tradeoffs}} {{that are involved}} in the design of SRAM. The major components of an SRAM such as the row decoders, the memory cells and the sense amplifiers have been studied in detail. The circuit techniques used to reduce the power dissipation and delay of these components has been explored and the tradeoffs have been explained. The key to low power operation in the SRAM data path is to reduce the signal swings on the high capacitance nodes like the bitlines and the data lines. Clocked voltage sense amplifiers are essential for obtaining low sensing power, and accurate generation of their sense clock is required for high speed operation. The tracking circuits essentially use a replica memory cell and a replica bitline to track the delay of the memory cell over a wide range of process and operating conditions. We present experimental results from two different prototypes. Finally an 8 Kb prototype SRAM has been designed and verified. This design incorporates some of the circuit techniques used to reduce power dissipation and delay. Experimental data has been provided which shows the effectiveness of using the resetting scheme for the row decoders. While designing the SRAM, techniques such as circuit partitioning, gate oxide thickness variations and low <b>power</b> <b>layout</b> techniques are made use of to minimize the power dissipation. The mask design of the constituent memory blocks is done using virtuoso tool, the DRC & LVS verified through Hercules/Calibre. The design was simulated at a clock speed of 500 MHz. The read access time was found to be 0. 85 ns while the write access time was found to be 0. 42 ns at pre-layout simulations. The total power dissipation was 10. 232 mW at pre-layout simulations. The read access time was found to be 1. 23 ns while the write access time was found to be 0. 85 ns at post-layout simulations. The total power dissipation was 20. 521 mW at post-layout simulations...|$|E

30|$|Depending {{on the sun}} {{position}} and the distances to its neighbors, a dish might get shaded, leading to a significant reduction of effective reflective area. Figure  3 c, d show this effective area (light blue region) varies with changes in dish distance δ x, δ y and time. With the increase of shade area, extreme temperature unbalance on the heat-receiver plane of the engine builds up, and eventually leads to a significant reduction of plant efficiency.

The method with which we quantify stability delivers a single number, called basin stability, for each node in a grid. A node with a poor basin stability is a weak point, as a rather small perturbation to this node would suffice to destroy the synchrony of the whole system and make it collapse. Using tools from the theory of complex networks, we statistically evaluate an ensemble of grids to identify topological classes of nodes whose members typically have the same (poor or large) value of basin stability.
