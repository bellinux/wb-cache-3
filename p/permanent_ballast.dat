2500|$|The Oceaan VII {{was built}} in the Netherlands in 1939 and had spent most of its life {{operating}} out of the Belgian port of Antwerp. During World War II it had been commandeered by the German occupation authorities. It was approximately 118 feet long and 160 tonnes in displacement. The vessel was refitted in the east coast port of Grimsby before being brought to Scarborough where it was renamed Oceaan 7. The refit involved the addition of 20 tonnes of <b>permanent</b> <b>ballast</b> in the hull in order to give extra stability. The vessel was fitted with a 150 feet high radio mast and a 10kW RCA BTA 10J1 transmitter. The vessel's main engine was a four-cylinder 240hp diesel. [...] Two newly installed 50 kva Dale Marine generators supplied all electricity needed for operational purposes.|$|E

50|$|Kentledge (fr. ballast), or {{kentledge}} weights, are slabs or {{blocks of}} concrete or iron (commonly scrap iron or pig iron). They are used within ships as <b>permanent,</b> high-density <b>ballast.</b> They {{may also be}} used as counterweights in cranes such as tower cranes or swing bridges as is found in the Victoria Swing Bridge. On construction sites, prior to the erection of a building, static load testing may use a large number of kentledge stacked onto a platform. This platform is used to drive piles into the ground beneath to test the integrity of the foundation.|$|R

50|$|MacGregor {{was known}} for using {{innovative}} features to provide stability while maintaining light weight and easy trailerability. The swing keel {{was one of the}} innovations used on MacGregor's smaller boats, and water ballast was another. The model 26M weighs only 2550 lb dry, 300 lb of which is <b>permanent</b> <b>ballast.</b> When in the water it can take on an additional 1150 lb of water ballast, stored in tanks below the waterline. This allows the 26M to be self-righting; if rolled 90 degrees, the weight of the ballast will quickly flip the boat back upright.|$|E
50|$|The wreck is {{remarkable}} {{due to the}} incredibly complete nature of the ship which lies {{at a depth of}} 32 to 40 feet below sea level. The wreck appears to have been fully laden with goods and appears to be very much intact not having been plundered or disturbed by natural elements. The cargo discovered on the ship includes around 100 wooden boxes containing metal swords, nails, bolts of cloth, horseshoes and scissors and a sizable quantity of ceramic pottery. The ship was also found to have a coating of granel for use as a <b>permanent</b> <b>ballast</b> instead of the ballast stones that have been found in other wrecks of Spanish ships.|$|E

40|$|Grading {{has long}} been {{recognised}} to critically influence the mechanical behaviour of ballast. To identify the ballast grading for heavy-haul rail track, monotonic and cyclic triaxial tests are conducted to assess the performances of different gradings. Permanent deformations, aggregates degradation, resilience, shear resistance, maximum and minimum densities are recorded and analysed. The grading is found to affect the behaviour of ballast in that coarser gradings exhibit relatively better strength, resilience and therefore less <b>permanent</b> deformation. However, <b>ballast</b> degradation increases with the overall aggregate size. Therefore, to identify the grading for ballast with different performance objectives, a grey relational theory is used to convert the multi-objective into single-objective, i. e. grey relational grade. A relatively optimal grading that provides the highest grey relational grade is thus suggested for the improved ballast performance...|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} {{large-scale}} cyclic triaxial {{tests were conducted}} on latite basalt aggregates (ballast) to investigate how the frequency f affects the permanent deformation and degradation of railway ballast. During testing the frequency was varied from 5 Hz to 60 Hz to simulate a range of train speeds from about 40 km/h to 400 km/h. Three categories of permanent deformation mechanisms were observed {{in response to the}} applied cyclic loads, namely, the inception of plastic shakedown (f ≤ 20 Hz), then plastic shakedown and ratcheting (30 Hz ≤ f ≤ 50 Hz), followed by plastic collapse at higher frequencies (f ≥ 60 Hz). The <b>permanent</b> strain of <b>ballast</b> and particle breakage increased with the frequency and number of load cycles. A cyclic strain ratio was introduced to capture the effect of frequency on the permanent axial and volumetric strains, respectively. An empirical equation was formulated to represent this relationship for latite basalt, and a critical train speed was identified. A good correlation was obtained between particle breakage and volumetric strain under cyclic loading...|$|R
40|$|Increasing {{the speed}} and {{frequency}} of trains with the same static axle weight imparts higher dynamic axle loads more frequently. When this occurs on existing track {{which has not been}} designed for such loading there can be increased rates of ballast degradation, characterised by unacceptable deformation and lateral spread, leading to more frequent requirements for track maintenance. Recent studies carried out at the University of Wollongong highlighted that confining pressure and frequency have a significant influence on the permanent deformation and degradation of ballast. However, confinement required to keep the deformation and degradation of the ballasted track to an acceptable limit will depend on the train speed (frequency). In this context, a series of cyclic triaxial tests was conducted on latite basalt samples having an initial confining pressure of 120 kPa. After every 25 000 cycles, the confining pressure was decreased in steps to simulate the drop of confining pressure during heavy traffic. This test procedure was adopted to replicate the influence of train speed on the stability of ballast. Test results indicated that both the frequency and confining pressure have a significant influence on the <b>permanent</b> deformation of <b>ballast.</b> Resilient modulus is found to increase with an increase in confining pressure and number of cycles, but to decrease with increasing frequency. The results also showed that the ballast layer requires a minimum level of confinement for preventing an excessive amount of track deformation. An empirical equation is formulated to determine the required confining pressure and resilient modulus of the ballast layer for an allowable limit of track deformation at a given train speed...|$|R
50|$|Clearly the Hunts posed a major design challenge. They {{would be}} too short and narrow and of {{insufficient}} range for open ocean work, being restricted to the North Sea and Mediterranean Sea. This sacrifice was accepted to give any chance of meeting the requirements. The demanding specifications in an overworked Admiralty design department resulted in a major design miscalculation. When the detailed calculations were done the centre of gravity was lower than expected and the beam was increased. As the first ships were being completed {{it was found that}} the design was as much as 70 tons overweight, top heavy, leaving them dangerously deficient in stability. The first twenty ships were so far advanced in construction that it was necessary to remove the 'X' 4-inch gun mount and add 50 tons of <b>permanent</b> <b>ballast.</b> These ships became the Type I group, and had the multiple 2-pounder gun relocated from behind the funnel to the more advantageous 'X' position.|$|E
50|$|A {{detailed}} stability {{review was}} performed by FaAA {{as part of its}} investigation. It opined that the ship was designed, built, and operated in accordance with American Bureau of Shipping (ABS) Standards. In 1988, the ship was modified to include a top drive unit. The stability effect of this modification was analyzed by FaAA, and it found that stability improved due to conversion of the No. 3 center tank to <b>permanent</b> <b>ballast</b> as part of the top drive modification. (FaAA never found the alleged ABS calculations and certification of the ship's stability with the top drive.) At the time of the capsize, FaAA opined the ship was operating within accepted stability standards. However, its investigation revealed errors in the wind overturning moment calculations performed by the shipbuilder and approved by ABS. Erroneous instructions in the operator's manual would allow the ship to be operated with the height of the vertical center of gravity above accepted limits, resulting in reduced stability margin. FaAA opined that while this could have been a serious issue in this situation, it was not, since the ship was operating at less than the maximum allowable vertical position of the center of gravity prior to the event.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to perform a concept evaluation of novel station keeping concept for offshore vertical axis wind turbines based on the well-known tension leg platform (TLP) principle. The main characteristic of this concept is the two-stage approach of installing the turbine offshore. In general terms the concept consists of four major components: the turbine, cylindrical floater, submerged docking station {{and an array of}} vertical top tensioned tethers. The idea behind this concept is that the docking station is towed out to the field and attached to the tethers prior to the float out operation of the turbine. The turbine is towed out on separate cylindrical floater, which is mated to the docking station, situated at a certain depth below sea level. The top-tensioning of the tendons is achieved in two stages, first by de-ballasting the docking station to maintain a level of pre-tension prior to the mating procedure with the turbine floater. The turbine floater, which also maintains a certain mass of temporary ballast to achieve operating draft, is later used to achieve the desired pre-tension for the operating condition after installation. This concept was applied for patenting in Norway by Prof. A. Nergaard on 31 st June 2009 and granted 20 th September 2010 (Patent no. 329254). In this thesis the aim was to determine a set of promising floaters and docking stations by assessing relevant parameters based on spreadsheet calculations. The key considerations here were sufficient pre-tension capacity and stability in float out for a vertical axis wind turbine with a rated power of 2. 3 MW. Adjustments were made to the principal dimensions such as the diameters, drafts, pontoon radii and ratios of <b>permanent</b> <b>ballast</b> to temporary ballast to achieve stable floaters and docking stations that satisfied a set of design criteria. Due to limited available research on this particular concept, the design criteria were set based on existing information on horizontal axis wind turbine TLPs, along with several engineering assumptions. In general terms the work presented in this thesis cover three principal stages: spreadsheet analysis of parameters, hydrodynamic modelling and dynamic simulation in one operational and extreme sea state. The parameter study resulted in the selection of three cases with combined displacements ranging between 6047 and 9811 m 3, with associated pre-tension capacities per tendon between 5. 3 and 10 MN. Following the selection of cases, work was done to determine the frequency dependent added mass and potential damping properties of each case along with the specification of load and displacement RAOs. These properties were used to create a new set of vessels in OrcaFlex to assess the motion characteristics and tendon tension for the two aforementioned environmental conditions. The analysis conducted in this thesis was limited to linear effects only, i. e. second order effects were neglected. The {{objective of}} the thesis was to evaluate this concept based on the results obtained from the dynamic simulation in terms of loads at the floater-docking station connection, the tension in the tendons under both environmental conditions and assess the motion characteristics of each case. The results obtained for the selected cases resulted in slack tendons in the severe sea state corresponding to a 50 - year storm, which indicated that the selected cases did not satisfy the requirement for this type of station keeping concept. Despite the fact that none of the cases were sufficient to survive the storm, some trends were uncovered for possible further work on this concept to reach a suitable combination of parameters. The main problems that were found for this concept was the bending moment at the connection between the floater and docking station, and the occurrence of slack. In the 50 -year storm, maximum bending moments between 270 and 320 MNm were found, exceeding the capacity of standard collet connectors, which was the envisioned connection method in this thesis. In regards to slack tendons, it was found here that an increased pontoon radius (> 35 m) would yield significantly improved results in terms of avoiding slack, which coincided with the studied literature. A reduction in draft of the floater component, which in this thesis ranged between 50 and 60 m, would also result in improvements for both the connection load and the loss of tension in the downwind tendon. Higher pre-tension was also found to give lower variation in tendon load, coinciding with the studied literatur...|$|E
