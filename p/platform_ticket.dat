500|$|On {{arrival at}} Cardiff Central railway station, Friday {{was arrested by}} the British Transport Police for having {{travelled}} from Reading with only a <b>platform</b> <b>ticket.</b> Andrews bailed his new player out of police custody {{and took him to}} Ninian Park to sign the contract. Despite the manner of Friday's arrival, and although he knew there [...] "had to be something wrong with him", the Cardiff manager was still happy with his purchase, describing the £28,000 transfer as [...] "an absolute steal". After a long night of drinking the night before his Cardiff debut, Friday lined up against Fulham on 1 January 1977. The Fulham defence included former England captain Bobby Moore, but Friday marked his first match for the Welsh club with two goals; he also squeezed Moore's testicles during the game as Cardiff won 3–0. Andrews was so happy with Friday's performance that he phoned Hurley two days later, on Monday morning. [...] "Oh, Charlie", Andrews gushed, [...] "he was magnificent. He tore them inside out. ... Moore was chasing him all over the place". The Cardiff manager continued to heap praise on his new acquisition until Hurley finally stopped him. [...] "Jimmy, you've only had him four days", he warned, sombrely: [...] "Give it a few months"...|$|E

[...] At age eleven, Lisberg attended Salford Grammar School, graduating in July 1962 as a Bachelor of Arts in Commerce from the University of Manchester.|$|E
