5|$|During {{this period}} {{her mother had}} died, and Bryher had {{divorced}} her husband, only to marry H.D.'s new male lover, Kenneth Macpherson. H.D., Bryher, and Macpherson lived together and traveled through Europe as what the poet and critic Barbara Guest termed in her biography of H.D. as a 'menagerie of three.' Bryher and Macpherson adopted H.D.'s daughter, Perdita. In 1928, H.D. became pregnant but chose to abort the pregnancy in November. Bryher and Macpherson set up the magazine Close Up (to which H.D. regularly contributed) as a medium for intellectual discussion of cinema. In 1927, the small independent film cinema group <b>POOL</b> <b>or</b> Pool Group was established (largely funded with Bryher's inheritance) and was managed by all three. Only one POOL film survives in its entirety, Borderline (1930), which featured H.D. and Paul Robeson in the lead roles. In common with the Borderline novellas, the film explores extreme psychic states {{and their relationship to}} surface reality. As well as acting in this film, H.D. wrote an explanatory pamphlet to accompany it, a piece later published in Close Up.|$|E

5|$|The town's name {{derives from}} a {{corruption}} of the Celtic word bol and the Old English word pool meaning a place near a <b>pool</b> <b>or</b> creek. Variants include Pool, Pole, Poles, Poll, Polle, Polman, and Poolman. The area around modern Poole has been inhabited for the past 2,500years. During the 3rd century BC, Celts known as the Durotriges moved from hilltop settlements at Maiden Castle and Badbury Rings to heathland around the River Frome and Poole Harbour. The Romans landed at Poole during their conquest of Britain in the 1st century and took over an Iron Age settlement at Hamworthy, an area {{just west of the}} modern town centre. In Anglo-Saxon times, Poole was included in the Kingdom of Wessex. The settlement was used as a base for fishing and the harbour a place for ships to anchor {{on their way to the}} River Frome and the important Anglo-Saxon town of Wareham. Poole experienced two large-scale Viking invasions during this era: in 876, Guthrum sailed his fleet through the harbour to attack Wareham, and in 1015, Canute began his conquest of England in Poole Harbour, using it as a base to raid and pillage Wessex.|$|E

40|$|SummaryOsteoarthritis (OA) is {{a leading}} cause of pain and {{disability}} and leads to a reduced quality of life. The aim was to determine the current evidence on risk factors for onset of knee pain/OA in those aged 50 and over. A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted of cohort studies for risk factors for the onset of knee pain. Two authors screened abstracts and papers and completed data extraction. Where possible, <b>pooled</b> odds ratios (<b>OR)</b> were calculated via random effects meta-analysis and population attributable fractions (PAFs) derived. 6554 papers were identified and after screening 46 studies were included. The main factors associated with onset of knee pain were being overweight (<b>pooled</b> <b>OR</b> 1. 98, 95 % confidence intervals (CI) 1. 57 – 2. 20), obesity (<b>pooled</b> <b>OR</b> 2. 66 95 % CI 2. 15 – 3. 28), female gender (<b>pooled</b> <b>OR</b> 1. 68, 95 % CI 1. 37 – 2. 07), previous knee injury (<b>pooled</b> <b>OR</b> 2. 83, 95 % CI 1. 91 – 4. 19). Hand OA (<b>pooled</b> <b>OR</b> 1. 30, 95 % CI 0. 90 – 1. 87) was found to be non-significant. Smoking was found not to be a statistically significant risk <b>or</b> protective factor (<b>pooled</b> <b>OR</b> 0. 92, 95 % CI 0. 83 – 1. 01). PAFs indicated that in patients with new onset of knee pain 5. 1 % of cases were due to previous knee injury and 24. 6 % related to being overweight or obese. Clinicians can use the identified risk factors to identify and manage patients at risk of developing or increasing knee pain. Obesity in particular needs to be a major target for prevention of development of knee pain. More research is needed into a number of potential risk factors...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Use {{systematic}} review methods {{to quantify the}} association between prostatitis and prostate cancer, under both fixed and random effects model. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: Case control studies of prostate cancer with information on prostatitis history. All studies published between 1990 - 2012, were collected to calculate a pooled odds ratio. SELECTION CRITERIA: the selection criteria are as follows: human case control studies; published from May 1990 to July 2012; containing number of prostatitis, and prostate cancer cases. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: In total, 20 case control studies were included. A significant association between prostatitis and prostate cancer was found, under both fixed effect model (pooled OR= 1. 50, 95 %CI: 1. 39 - 1. 62), and random effects model (OR= 1. 64, 95 %CI: 1. 36 - 1. 98). Personal interview based case control studies showed {{a high level of}} association (fixed effect model: pooled OR= 1. 59, 95 %CI: 1. 47 - 1. 73, random effects model: pooled OR= 1. 87, 95 %CI: 1. 52 - 2. 29), compared with clinical based studies (fixed effect model: pooled OR= 1. 05, 95 %CI: 0. 86 - 1. 28, random effects model: pooled OR= 0. 98, 95 %CI: 0. 67 - 1. 45). Additionally, <b>pooled</b> <b>ORs,</b> were calculated for each decade. In a fixed effect model: 1990 's: OR= 1. 58, 95 % CI: 1. 35 - 1. 84; 2000 's: OR= 1. 59, 95 % CI: 1. 40 - 1. 79; 2010 's: OR= 1. 37, 95 % CI: 1. 22 - 1. 56. In a random effects model: 1990 's: OR= 1. 98, 95 % CI: 1. 08 - 3. 62; 2000 's: OR= 1. 64, 95 % CI: 1. 23 - 2. 19; 2010 's: OR= 1. 34, 95 % CI: 1. 03 - 1. 73. Finally a meta-analysis stratified by each country was conducted. In fixed effect models, U. S: <b>pooled</b> <b>OR</b> = 1. 45, 95 %CI: 1. 34 - 1. 57; China: <b>pooled</b> <b>OR</b> = 4. 67, 95 %CI: 3. 08 - 7. 07; Cuba: <b>pooled</b> <b>OR</b> = 1. 43, 95 %CI: 1. 00 - 2. 04; Italy: <b>pooled</b> <b>OR</b> = 0. 61, 95 %CI: 0. 13 - 2. 90.

40|$|Fulltext embargoed for: 12 months post date of publicationBACKGROUND: Some, but not all, {{observational}} {{studies have}} suggested that taller stature is associated with a significant increased risk of glioma. In a pooled analysis of observational studies, we investigated the strength and consistency of this association, overall and for major sub-types, and investigated effect modification by genetic susceptibility to the disease. METHODS: We standardized and combined individual-level data on 1354 cases and 4734 control subjects from 13 prospective and 2 case-control studies. <b>Pooled</b> odds ratios (<b>ORs)</b> and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) for glioma and glioma sub-types were estimated using logistic regression models stratified by sex and adjusted for birth cohort and study. <b>Pooled</b> <b>ORs</b> were additionally estimated after stratifying the models according to seven recently identified glioma-related genetic variants. RESULTS: Among men, we found a positive association between height and glioma risk (≥ 190 vs 170 - 174 cm, <b>pooled</b> <b>OR</b> = 1. 70, 95 % CI: 1. 11 - 2. 61; P-trend = 0. 01), which was slightly stronger after restricting to cases with glioblastoma (<b>pooled</b> <b>OR</b> = 1. 99, 95 % CI: 1. 17 - 3. 38; P-trend = 0. 02). Among women, these associations were less clear (≥ 175 vs 160 - 164 cm, <b>pooled</b> <b>OR</b> for glioma = 1. 06, 95 % CI: 0. 70 - 1. 62; P-trend = 0. 22; <b>pooled</b> <b>OR</b> for glioblastoma = 1. 36, 95 % CI: 0. 77 - 2. 39; P-trend = 0. 04). In general, we did not observe evidence of effect modification by glioma-related genotypes on the association between height and glioma risk. CONCLUSION: An association of taller adult stature with glioma, particularly for men and stronger for glioblastoma, should be investigated further to clarify the role of environmental and genetic determinants of height in the etiology of this disease.
