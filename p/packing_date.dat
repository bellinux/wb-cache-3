40|$|Rényi's parking problem (or 1 D {{sequential}} interval <b>packing</b> problem) <b>dates</b> back to 1958, when Rényi {{studied the}} following random process: Consider an interval I of length x, and sequentially and randomly pack disjoint unit intervals in I until the remaining space prevents placing any new segment.

Furthermore, we were able to obtain useful recursion formulas for the expected number of r-gaps (0 < r< k) between neighboring blocks. We also provided very fast converging series and extensive computer simulations for these expected numbers, so that the limiting filling density of the long line segment (as n→∞) is Rényi's famous parking constant, 0. 7475979203 [...] Comment: Final version; to appear in Proceedeings of "Probability and Dynamics at IM-UFRJ", 13 pages, 6 figure...|$|R

40|$|We {{focus on}} the parallelization of {{two-dimensional}} square packing problem. In square packing problem, a list of square items need to be packed into a minimum number of unit square bins. All square items have side length smaller {{than or equal to}} 1 which is also the side length of each unit square bin. The total area of items that has been packed into one bin cannot exceed 1. Using the idea of harmonic, some squares can be put into the same bin without exceeding the bin limitation of side length 1 We try to concurrently pack all the corresponding squares into one bin by a parallel systerm of computation processing. A 9 = 4 -worst case asymptotic error bound algorithm with time complexity (n) is showed.

40|$|The National Weather Service (NWS) has a {{long history}} in {{forecasting}} seasonal run off volumes in the western United States where snow melt is the dominant component. The NWS (known as the Weather Bureau at the time) first opened the Water Supply Unit in Salt Lake City in 1947 to issue ten seasonal supply forecasts. Today, official forecasts are generated by six River Forecast Centers (RFCs) and coordinated with other agencies. NWS forecasts rely on two fundamental tools: Statistical Water Supply (SWS) and Ensemble Streamflow Prediction (ESP). SWS employs multivariate regression equations based primarily on the observed snow <b>pack</b> to <b>date</b> as well as other predictors such as climate indices and antecedent conditions to predict the seasonal run off volumes. ESP, by contrast, uses the continuous hydrologic model at the RFCs together with some prediction of future weather and climate to generate a forecast seasonal streamflow volume. NWS hydrologic forecasters contribute their expertise to produce forecasts at least monthly between January and June across the western United States. Recent and ongoing advances in forecast technology include improvements to ESP that increasingly account for meteorological and climate forecasts and include measures of uncertainty. Comparisons are shown between the various ESP methods accounting for climate and weather forecasts. Ongoing development is taking place in product delivery as well. A new web presence is being developed to present a consolidated picture of all NWS water supply forecasts as well as allow forecast users access to information from each forecast tool.

There was a remarkable variance in the fungal count and diversity between the studied samples. Eleven species belonging to five genera were isolated on 20 % sucrose-Czapek’s agar medium at 28 °C. Samples of date paste (Agwa) and flesh supplemented with sesame or peanut were highly polluted (650 - 3030 colonies/gs).

Practice was evaluated before and after its introduction in cardiac surgery. RESULTS:  The baseline audits revealed poor practice.

40|$|The {{two-dimensional}} non-oriented bin packing {{problem with}} due <b>dates</b> <b>packs</b> {{a set of}} rectangular items, which may be rotated by 90 degrees, into identical rectangular bins. The bins have equal processing times. An item's lateness {{is the difference between}} its due date and the completion time of its bin. The problem packs all items without overlap as to minimize maximum lateness Lmax. The paper proposes a tight lower bound that enhances an existing bound on Lmax for 24. 07 % of the benchmark instances and matches it in 30. 87 % cases. In addition, it models the problem using mixed integer programming (MIP), and solves small-sized instances exactly using CPLEX. It approximately solves larger-sized instances using a two-stage heuristic. The first stage constructs an initial solution via a first-fit heuristic that applies an iterative constraint programming (CP) -based neighborhood search. The second stage, which is iterative too, approximately solves a series of assignment low-level MIPs that are guided by feasibility constraints. It then enhances the solution via a high-level random local search. The approximate approach improves existing upper bounds by 27. 45 % on average, and obtains the optimum for 33. 93 % of the instances. Overall, the exact and approximate approaches identify the optimum for 39. 07 % cases. The proposed approach is applicable to complex problems. It applies CP and MIP sequentially, while exploring their advantages, and hybridizes heuristic search with MIP. It embeds a new lookahead strategy that guards against infeasible search directions and constrains the search to improving directions only; thus, differs from traditional lookahead beam searches...|$|R
40|$|With {{fewer than}} 500 {{individuals}} remaining, the Ethiopian wolf is {{an endangered species}} threatened by regular outbreaks of rabies which have occurred in 1992 - 1993, 2003 - 2004, and 2008 - 2009. An important step towards effective control planning is to quantify the spread of infection. However, epidemic processes are often only partially observed, making parameter inference hard. Here we explore the use of Approximate Bayesian Computation to assess rabies transmission in Ethiopian wolves during the 2008 - 2009 outbreak. We developed a spatially explicit stochastic SEIR model for infection spread within a metapopulation ofseven packs. Two parameters were inferred: the within (βw) and between pack (βb) transmission rates. The data comprised pre and post-outbreak <b>pack</b> compositions, and <b>date</b> and place of vaccination events and carcass recoveries. We used the model to simulate datasets using values for βw and βb sampled from priordistributions. These simulated data were reduced to summary statistics (number of carcasses per group of packs, total time of outbreak, and time between the first carcass and the first carcass in a neighbouring pack). Those parameters leading to the smallest distances between simulated and observed summary statistics were accepted, using an algorithm based on local linear regression. The basic reproduction number (R 0) was then computed. The median value of βw was approximately eight times higher than βb, consistentwith behavioral studies. The mean R 0 was 2. 6, in agreement with previous estimates for the 2003 rabies outbreak. Besides biological insights following the estimation of transmission parameters, these outputs {{will be used to}} calibrate a simulation model to assess theeffectiveness of different vaccination strategies in populations of Ethiopian wolves...|$|R
