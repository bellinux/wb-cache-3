5|$|Medium in {{size for}} its genus, {{it was first}} {{described}} as a separate species, but later lumped into other, widespread species until it was reinstated as separate in 2009. It is distinctive in fur color—grayish brown on the forequarters and reddish brown on the hindquarters—and in some dimensions of its skull, with a high braincase, robust zygomatic arches (cheekbones), and long incisive foramina (<b>perforations</b> of the palate between the incisors and the molars).|$|E

5|$|Deborah Jean Lodge and colleagues, in a {{reorganization}} of the family Hygrophoraceae based on molecular phylogenetics, proposed that H.appalachianensis should be the type species of the new section Pseudofirmae in genus Hygrocybe. Species in this section, which include Hygrocybe chloochlora, H.rosea, and H.trinitensis, have sticky or glutinous caps that often have <b>perforations</b> in the center. Their spores and basidia are dimorphic (of two sizes), {{and the development of}} the microbasidia and macrobasidia is often staggered. The macrobasidia are club shaped and appear as if they have a stalk.|$|E
30|$|Many {{reports have}} {{described}} upper TEE-associated gastrointestinal <b>perforation</b> [8 – 11]. Here, {{we report on}} TEE-related <b>perforation</b> of the stomach. Gastric <b>perforation</b> is a clinical condition different from esophageal <b>perforation.</b> Several cases involving esophageal <b>perforation</b> by TEE were reported, including a few cases with successful conservative management of the <b>perforation</b> [8, 9]. On the other hand, gastric <b>perforation</b> is a very rare complication in TEE, with only three such cases being reported, all treated via surgical intervention [10, 11]. Therefore, {{to the best of}} our knowledge, the present case report is the first to describe the successful conservative management of iatrogenic gastric <b>perforation</b> by TEE. In previously reported cases, open or laparoscopic surgery was performed for iatrogenic gastric or esophageal <b>perforation</b> by TEE [10, 11], in an effort to prevent severe infection-related complications such as mediastinitis, peritonitis, and septic shock, which may occur when treatment for upper gastrointestinal <b>perforation</b> by TEE is delayed.|$|R

5|$|Most of the {{residential}} areas at Chakokot possess {{one or more}} bottle-shaped underground storage chambers, known as chultunob, with 14 having been found as of 2001. Because of the thick vegetation at the site, investigators consider that there are probably more to be found. These chultunob were closed with disc-shaped stone lids, {{many of which were}} found either still in place or close to the aperture of the chultun to which it belonged. The stone lids were without <b>perforations</b> so it is supposed that the chambers were used to store dry goods rather than water.|$|E
5|$|No hand-colored {{prints of}} A Trip to the Moon {{were known to}} survive until 1993, when one {{was given to the}} Filmoteca de Catalunya by an {{anonymous}} donor as part of a collection of two hundred silent films. It is unknown whether this version, a hand-colored print struck from a second-generation negative, was colored by Elisabeth Thuillier's lab, but the <b>perforations</b> used imply that the copy was made before 1906. The flag waved during the launching scene in this copy is colored to resemble the flag of Spain, indicating that the hand-colored copy was made for a Spanish exhibitor.|$|E
5|$|Compared to E.nitidus and E.macconnelli, {{the skull}} is {{relatively}} small and slender. It has broad and short incisive foramina (<b>perforations</b> of the palate between the incisors and the molars) and lacks sphenopalatine vacuities which perforate the mesopterygoid fossa, the gap behind {{the end of the}} palate. The animal is similar to other members of the genus in the pattern of the arteries of the head. The alisphenoid strut, an extension of the alisphenoid bone which separates two foramina (openings) in the skull (the masticatory-buccinator foramen and the foramen ovale accessorium) is rarely present; its presence is more frequent in E.nitidus. The capsular process, a raising of the bone of the mandible (lower jaw) behind the third molar, houses the back end of the lower incisor in most Euryoryzomys, but is absent in E.emmonsae and E.macconnelli. Traits of the teeth {{are similar to those of}} E.nitidus and other Euryoryzomys.|$|E

5|$|Compared {{to that of}} Nectomys, {{the skull}} is lightly built and has narrow nasals and a broad, round braincase without {{conspicuous}} ridges on it. The zygomatic plate is broad. The incisive foramina (<b>perforations</b> of the front part of the palate) extend between the first molars and are broadest in their back halves. The broad mesopterygoid fossa, the gap behind {{the end of the}} palate, is perforated by sphenopalatine vacuities. The molar crowns are not as simplified as in Nectomys species, but the front cusps of the upper (anterocone) and lower first molar (anteroconid) are not divided in two. In addition to the main roots, the upper and lower first molars have smaller additional roots.|$|E
5|$|In {{the spring}} of the {{following}} year, steps began to make coin operation, via a nickel slot, part of {{the mechanics of the}} viewing system. By autumn 1892, the design of the Kinetoscope was essentially complete. The filmstrip, based on stock manufactured first by Eastman, and then, from April 1893 onward, by New York's Blair Camera Co., was 35 mm (1 3/8inches) wide; each vertically sequenced frame bore a rectangular image and four <b>perforations</b> on each side. Within a few years, this basic format would be adopted globally as the standard for motion picture film, which it remains to this day. The publication in the October 1892 Phonogram of cinematographic sequences shot in the format demonstrates that the Kinetograph had already been reconfigured to produce movies with the new film.|$|E
5|$|Oryzomys albiventer is a {{large and}} long-tailed Oryzomys. The upperparts are brightly ochraceous, {{becoming}} grayer toward the front. The hairs on the underparts are pale gray near the bases and white in the outer half, so that the underparts appear pale grayish according to Carleton and Arroyo-Cabrales (not white as claimed by Merriman). The tail is dark above and light below. The skull and molars are relatively robust. O.albiventer has broad zygomatic arches (cheekbones), long incisive foramina (<b>perforations</b> of the palate between the incisors and the molars), and long nasal bones that extend behind the premaxillary bones. Compared to its lowland relative O.couesi mexicanus, O.albiventer is larger and more brightly colored and has larger molars but narrower incisive foramina.|$|E
40|$|Colonic <b>perforation</b> {{may occur}} as a {{complication}} of diagnostic and therapeutic colonoscopy. The risk factors for <b>perforation</b> after colorectal endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) include an inexperienced endoscopist, a large tumor size, and submucosal fibrosis. The mechanisms of <b>perforation</b> include unintended endoscopic resection/dissection and severe thermal injury. Here, we report a case of colon <b>perforation</b> that occurred after ESD with snaring of a laterally spreading tumor.

40|$|<b>Perforation</b> is an {{uncommon}} but serious complication during {{endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography}} (ERCP). The incidence of <b>perforation</b> though small but {{is the one that}} requires immediate management. Delay in identifying this complication can lead to severe morbidity and even mortality in selected cases. If one can identify a <b>perforation</b> during the procedure (ERCP), then the minimally invasive technique such as clipping of the <b>perforation</b> in expert hands can save a lot of additional operative procedures and additional hospital stay costs. We present one such case of large <b>perforation</b> during precut sphincterotomy in a case of difficult cannulation. The <b>perforation</b> was identified and successfully treated by clipping the <b>perforation</b> during the procedure which leads to quick recovery and short hospital stay...|$|R

5|$|The incisive foramina, which {{perforate}} {{the palate}} between the incisors and the molars, {{are long and}} narrow, extending between the first molars. The back margins of the zygomatic plates, the flattened front portions of the zygomatic arches (cheekbones), are located before the first molars. Like its close relatives Lundomys and Holochilus, Pseudoryzomys has spinous processes on its zygomatic plates. These genera also share relatively simple posterolateral palatal pits, <b>perforations</b> of the palate near the third molar. Unlike Holochilus and Lundomys, however, Pseudoryzomys has a flat palate, lacking a ridge on the middle that extends {{along the length of}} the palate. The parapterygoid fossae, which are located behind the third molars, are excavated beyond the level of the palate, but not as deeply as in Holochilus and Lundomys. The mastoid skull bone contains a conspicuous opening, as in most oryzomyines.|$|E
5|$|Frequent nosebleeds can be {{prevented}} in part by keeping the nostrils moist, and by applying saline solution, estrogen-containing creams or tranexamic acid; these have few side effects and may have a small degree of benefit. A number of additional modalities {{has been used to}} prevent recurrent bleeding if simple measures are unsuccessful. Medical therapies include oral tranexamic acid and estrogen; the evidence for these is relatively limited, and estrogen is poorly tolerated by men and possibly carries risks of cancer and heart disease in women past the menopause. Nasal coagulation and cauterization may reduce the bleeding from telangiectasias, and is recommended before surgery is considered. However, it is highly recommended to use the least heat and time to prevent septal <b>perforations</b> and excessive trauma to the nasal mucosa that are already susceptible to bleeding. Sclerotherapy is another option to manage the bleeding. This process involves injecting a small amount of an aerated irritant (detergent such as sodium tetradecyl sulfate) directly into the telangiectasias. The detergent causes the vessel to collapse and harden, resulting in scar tissue residue. This is the same procedure used to treat varicose veins and similar disorders.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, Marcelo Weksler {{published}} a large-scale cladistic analysis of Oryzomyini ("rice rats"), the tribe to which O.polius belongs. He used both morphological data and molecular characters from the IRBP gene. In {{all of his}} analyses, O.polius {{was found to be}} part of clade D, one of four large groups within Oryzomyini, as the sister group to a clade containing all the other species of clade D. Clade D was supported by two shared derived (synapomorphic) molecular characters and by seven morphological synapomorphies—the tail has a different color above and below; the parietal bone extends {{to the side of the}} skull; the incisive foramina (openings in the palate) extend back between the first molars; the posterolateral palatal pits (<b>perforations</b> of the palate near the third molars) are complex; the sphenopalatine vacuities (openings in the mesopterygoid fossa, the gap behind the end of the palate) are large; the pattern of the arterial circulation in the head is derived; and the posteroloph (a crest at the back) is present on the third upper molar. Two other molecular synapomorphies supported the clade of all members of clade D except O.polius, coupled with three morphological traits—in these species, but not in O.polius, the first upper molar has an additional small root at the outer (labial) side; the first lower molar has additional small roots; and the second upper molar has the mesoflexus (one of the valleys between the cusps and crests) divided in two.|$|E
50|$|In more brittle films, cold <b>perforation</b> {{can cause}} {{slitting}} rather than creating a round hole, which can jeopardize the material's integrity under pressure.

25|$|There are {{no known}} records of actual {{quantities}} issued for private perforation types, however relative rarity {{of the various}} types is known from years of stamp sales and auction results. The Farwell type 3A2 is the most rare variety of the private <b>perforations.</b> Counterfeits <b>perforations</b> applied to the imperforate variety are somewhat common among several of the types, usually among items having a far lower value than the coil with privately applied <b>perforations.</b> Coil-stamp pairs with a center line mark in between the stamps are also targets for counterfeiters as the item itself is scare or rare and {{with the addition of}} fake <b>perforations,</b> the rarity of the item is compounded allowing its value to go up exponentially if not detected. With two exceptions, each vending machine company that applied private <b>perforations</b> produced several different distinct types: i.e. the Schermack vending machine company produced five different perforation types, Mail-o-meter produced six different types, Brinkerhoff produced four different types. Other companies include The John V. Farwell Company which produced eleven different types of <b>perforations</b> and the U.S. Automatic Vending Company which issued four types.
