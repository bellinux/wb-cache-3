5|$|According to Kuhn, {{science is}} an {{inherently}} communal activity {{which can only}} be done as <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>community.</b> For him, the fundamental difference between science and other disciplines {{is the way in which}} the communities function. Others, especially Feyerabend and some post-modernist thinkers, have argued that there is insufficient difference between social practices in science and other disciplines to maintain this distinction. For them, social factors play an important and direct role in scientific method, but they do not serve to differentiate science from other disciplines. On this account, science is socially constructed, though this does not necessarily imply the more radical notion that reality itself is a social construct.|$|E

These {{included}} William Hamilton of Gilbertfield (c. 1665–1751), Robert Crawford (1695–1733), Alexander Ross (1699–1784), the Jacobite William Hamilton of Bangour (1704–54), socialite Alison Rutherford Cockburn (1712–94), and poet and playwright James Thompson's (1700–48), most {{famous for the}} nature poetry of his Seasons. Tobias Smollett (1721–71) was a poet, essayist, satirist and playwright, but {{is best known for}} his picaresque novels, such as The Adventures of Roderick Random (1748) and The Adventures of Peregrine Pickle (1751) for which he is often seen as Scotland's first novelist. His work would be a major influence on later novelists such as Thackeray and Dickens.|$|E
5|$|For some, being a <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>community</b> is an {{important}} resource because they often report having felt ostracized. Although online communities exist, affiliation with online communities vary. Some question the concept of online community, while others depend on the online asexual community heavily for support. Elizabeth Abbott posits that {{there has always been}} an asexual element in the population, but that asexual people kept a low profile. While the failure to consummate marriage was seen as an insult to the sacrament of marriage in medieval Europe, and has sometimes been used as grounds for divorce or to rule a marriage void, asexuality, unlike homosexuality, has never been illegal, and it has usually gone unnoticed. However, in the 21st century, the anonymity of online communication and general popularity of social networking online has facilitated the formation of a community built around a common asexual identity.|$|E

25|$|Being {{a daytime}} shelter model, it is a {{critical}} part of caring for the poor and homeless, since most nighttime shelters for sleeping typically put their guests out during the day, early in the morning after wake-up call.

25|$|Kierkegaardian {{scholars}} have made several interpretations of how Kierkegaard proceeds with parodying Hegel's dialectic. One {{of the more}} popular interpretations argues the aesthetic-ethical-religious stages are the triadic process Kierkegaard was talking about. See section Spheres of existence for more information. Another interpretation argues for the world-individual-will triadic process. The dialectic here is either to assert an individual's own desire to be independent and the desire to be <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>community.</b> Instead of reconciliation {{of the world and the}} individual where problems between the individual and society are neatly resolved in the Hegelian system, Kierkegaard argues that there's a delicate bond holding the interaction between them together, which needs to be constantly reaffirmed. Jean-Paul Sartre takes this latter view and says the individual is in a constant state of reaffirming his or her own identity, else one falls into bad faith.|$|E

25|$|At {{this time}} both Danubian Principalities {{came under the}} {{suzerainty}} of the Ottoman Empire, {{and a number of}} Sephardim living in Istanbul migrated to Wallachia, while Jews from Poland and the Holy Roman Empire settled in Moldavia. Although they took an important part in Ottoman government and formed a large <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>community</b> of foreign creditors and traders, Jews were harassed by the hospodars of the two Principalities. Moldavia's Prince Ștefăniță (1522) deprived the Jewish merchants of almost all the rights given to them by his two predecessors; Petru Rareș confiscated Jewish wealth in 1541, after alleging that Jews in the cattle trade had engaged in tax evasion. Alexandru Lăpușneanu (first rule: 1552-61) persecuted the community alongside other social categories, until he was dethroned by Jacob Heraclides, a Greek Lutheran, who was lenient to his Jewish subjects; Lăpușneanu did not renew his persecutions after his return on the throne in 1564. The role of Ottoman and local Jews in financing various princes increased as Ottoman economic demands were mounting after 1550 (in the 1570s, the influential Jewish Duke of the Archipelago, Joseph Nasi, backed both Heraclides and Lăpușneanu to the throne); several violent incidents throughout the period were instigated by princes unable to repay their debts.|$|E

500|$|Thomas Paine, {{one of the}} Founding Fathers of the United States, {{said that}} the right to vote is {{critical}} in the protection of individual freedoms.

Paine's view was that there is no justification for one <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>community</b> to deny another its right to vote on any basis, whether class, race, religion or political creed. His view survives in various international instruments such as Article 21(1) of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.|$|E

Fruit bodies of S.coccinea may grow either solitarily, scattered or grouped together on sticks, twigs, and fragments of dead wood, usually somewhat decomposed and partially buried in the top [...] of soil and forest litter. It prefers soil that is moist and shaded and has a high content of humus. Like all Sarcoscypha species, it prefers the wood of angiosperms, such as oak, maple, and basswood; one field guide notes a preference for shagbark hickory. In the United States, it fruits from late spring to early autumn, which contrasts it with S.coccinea, found usually in the spring.|$|E
500|$|After the Union in 1707, {{the use of}} Scots was {{discouraged}} by many in authority and education. Allan Ramsay led a [...] "vernacular revival" [...] that laid the foundations of a reawakening of interest in older Scottish literature. He also led the trend for pastoral poetry and his pastoral opera The Gentle Shepherd {{was one of the}} most influential works of the era. Ramsay was <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>community</b> of poets working in Scots and English. Tobias Smollett was a poet, essayist, satirist and playwright, but is best known for his picaresque novels, for which he is often seen as Scotland's first novelist. The early eighteenth century was also a period of innovation in Gaelic vernacular poetry that mixed traditional forms with influences from the Lowlands. Drama was pursued by Scottish playwrights in London. In Scotland drama was supplied by visiting English players and actors, but there were clashes with the Kirk. Ramsay was instrumental in establishing a small theatre in Edinburgh, but it closed soon after the passing of the 1737 Licensing Act. A new theatre was opened at Cannongate in 1747 and operated without a licence into the 1760s.|$|E

2500|$|After the Union in 1707 Scottish {{literature}} {{developed a}} distinct {{national identity and}} began to enjoy an international reputation.
