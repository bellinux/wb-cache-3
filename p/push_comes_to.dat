5|$|Copeland {{auditioned for}} several dance {{programs}} in 1999, and each made her {{an offer to}} enroll in its summer program. She performed with ABT {{as part of its}} 1999 and 2000 Summer Intensive programs. By {{the end of the first}} summer, she was asked to join the ABT Studio Company. Her mother insisted that she finish high school, and so Copeland returned to California for her senior year, even though ABT arranged to pay for her performances, housing accommodations and academic arrangements. She studied at the Summer Intensive Program on full scholarship for both summers and was declared ABT's National Coca-Cola Scholar in 2000. In the 2000 Summer Intensive Program, she danced the role of Kitri in Don Quixote. Copeland's strongest memory from the summer is working with Tharp on <b>Push</b> <b>Comes</b> <b>to</b> Shove". Of the 150 dancers in the 2000 Summer Intensive Program, she was one of six selected to join the junior dance troupe.|$|E
25|$|One dancer {{who trained}} with Balanchine and absorbed {{much of this}} neo-classical style was Mikhail Baryshnikov. Following Baryshnikov's {{appointment}} as artistic director of American Ballet Theatre in 1980, he worked with various modern choreographers, most notably Twyla Tharp. Tharp choreographed <b>Push</b> <b>Comes</b> <b>To</b> Shove for ABT and Baryshnikov in 1976; in 1986 she created In The Upper Room for her own company. Both these pieces were considered innovative for their use of distinctly modern movements melded {{with the use of}} pointe shoes and classically trained dancers—for their use of contemporary ballet.|$|E
25|$|The early 20th century saw the {{emergence}} of modern dance in New York, a new, distinctively American art form. Perhaps the best known figure in modern dance, Martha Graham, was a pupil of pioneer Ruth St. Denis. Many of Graham's most popular works were produced in collaboration with New York's leading composers – Appalachian Spring with Aaron Copland, for example. Merce Cunningham, a former ballet student and performer with Martha Graham, presented his first New York solo concert with John Cage in 1944. Influenced by Cage and embracing modernist ideology using postmodern processes, Cunningham introduced chance procedures and pure movement to choreography and Cunningham technique to the cannon of 20th century dance techniques. Cunningham set the seeds for postmodern dance with his non-linear, non-climactic, non-psychological abstract work. In these works each element is {{in and of itself}} expressive, and the observer determines what it communicates. George Balanchine, one of the 20th century's foremost choreographers and the first pioneer of contemporary ballet, formed a bridge between classical and modern ballet. Balanchine used flexed hands (and occasionally feet), turned-in legs, off-centered positions and non-classical costumes to distance himself from the classical and romantic ballet traditions. Balanchine also brought modern dancers in to dance with his company, the New York City Ballet; one such dancer was Paul Taylor, who in 1959 performed in Balanchine's piece Episodes. Another significant modern choreographer, Twyla Tharp, choreographed <b>Push</b> <b>Comes</b> <b>To</b> Shove for the American Ballet Theatre under Mikhail Baryshnikov's artistic directorship in 1976; in 1986 she created In The Upper Room for her own company. Both these pieces were considered innovative for their use of distinctly modern movements melded with the characteristics of contemporary ballet {{such as the use of}} pointe shoes and classically trained dancers.|$|E

500|$|Srijit Mukherji's period drama Begum Jaan (2017) saw Vidya {{play the}} role of the titular procurer. A Hindi {{language}} remake of the Bengali film Rajkahini (2015), Begum Jaan tells the story of how the lives of prostitutes living in brothel are affected by the partition of India in 1947. In preparation, Vidya worked with Mukherji to provide a backstory to her character, and she researched on the era by reading Urvashi Butalia’s novel The Other Side of Silence. Filming in the barren landscape of rural Jharkhand proved to be a challenge for Vidya, and she said that the experience taught her that [...] "if <b>push</b> <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> shove, I can brave scorpions, snakes and whatever else". Anna M.M.

In the same newspaper, on the following day, Keith Watson commented that the episode [...] "was like watching Carry On Up the Asteroids", but nevertheless stated that [...] "as dramatic cocktails go, [...] was out of this world", and gave the episode four stars out of five. The Times commented that the episode was [...] "good, salacious, knockabout fun", the best thing about Torchwood that [...] "everyday Cardiff hums alongside psychotic blowfish and time loops", and asked [...] "when extraterrestrial <b>push</b> <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> intergalactic shove, how could anyone object to a series that begins with a blowfish driving a sports car?". The Guardian stated that parts were [...] "very, very, funny" [...] and the episode was largely [...] "a hoot".

500|$|A {{defining}} {{characteristic of}} Barbara Gordon is her sense of morality, which {{differs from that of}} Batman and her primary field agent Black Canary. She has demonstrated a willingness to use lethal force, such as in Chuck Dixon's Birds of Prey issue #10, [...] "State of War", which contradicts the methodology used by her closest allies and most DC Comics characters. Dixon stated an interview that [...] "he's less morally conflicted than other characters. She's very 'means to an end' oriented. She sees that sometimes you have to kill to save lives. She's not comfortable with that but accepts it. She would do anything to avoid using deadly force but, when <b>push</b> <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> shove, she'll drop the hammer." [...] She demonstrates a similar moral ambiguity in Gail Simone's Birds of Prey: Of Like Minds when she argues with Black Canary over using illegally obtained information, which denies criminals the right of due process. Although the Huntress has never been opposed to using lethal force, she also comes into conflict with Oracle over the fact that she will use the psychological impact of a mission to subconsciously manipulate her field agents into conforming to her ideology.|$|E
50|$|Levels {{of demand}} in the Post War economy of Japan were low and the focus of mass {{production}} on lowest cost per item via economies of scale therefore had little application. Having visited and seen supermarkets in the USA, Taiichi Ohno recognised the scheduling of work should not be driven by sales or production targets but by actual sales. Given the financial situation during this period, over-production had to be avoided and thus the notion of Pull (build to order rather than target driven <b>Push)</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> underpin production scheduling.|$|R
