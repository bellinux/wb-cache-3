50|$|On May 27, 1941, Kleiss {{earned his}} {{nickname}} {{when he made}} an unauthorized landing at Marine Corps Air Station Ewa, located on the south shores of Oahu. After serving as the tow-sleeve aircraft during a gunnery exercise, Kleiss landed his SBD {{in front of the}} tower, hoping to find a safe field to haul in the tow-sleeve. Unexpectedly, his plane’s <b>prop</b> <b>blast</b> churned up a giant cloud of red dust, preventing two squadrons of Marine Corps fighter planes from landing on the runway. The tower control operator called over the radio, “Unknown dust cloud, who the hell are you?” Without responding, Kleiss took off for Naval Air Station Ford Island, hoping that no one had identified his plane. After landing, one of his squadron mates, Ensign Cleo Dobson, told Kleiss that he had seen the whole thing. Dobson joked, “Welcome aboard, Dusty!” For the remainder of his career in the Navy, Kleiss went by that nickname.|$|E
5000|$|Following the war, Lt. Haviland was {{assigned}} to the USS Texas (BB-35) near Guantánamo Bay as a combat pilot. There, he became the first pilot to launch a plane off a U.S. battleship, and the first pilot to launch a military aircraft off any ship, motivating the United States to begin developing the first military aircraft carriers. The idea was inspired by experiments in 1910 when stunt aviator Eugene Ely launched a Curtiss Model D (non-military) biplane off of a custom platform built onto the United States Cruiser USS Birmingham. Haviland's idea, which he had proposed to Captain Nathan C. Twining on the USS Texas (BB-35), was to build a 40 ft, 12 ft runway of timbers lashed together on the Number 2 guns of the Battleship's forward deck. His Sopwith Camel biplane would then be winched down on the runway and its wheels held by a bridle to be released at Haviland's command, after the plane's propeller had sufficient speed for takeoff. [...] "Haviland climbed into the cockpit and revved and raced the plane's motor until it seemed to the nearby sailors that the <b>prop</b> <b>blast</b> and vibration would tear the fuselage apart. Haviland signaled for the cables to be released. The straining aircraft roared down the runway, dropped precipitously toward the sea, then climbed into the sky." ...|$|E
5000|$|... 45 {{minutes after}} the initial explosion, at 12:15, a rescue team descended the shaft. Because of the {{firedamp}} they used Spedding mills to light their way. It was noted that the sparks fell [...] "like dark drops of blood" [...] due to the foul air. Having attempted two directions and being forced back by difficulty breathing they retreated to the pit bottom. The party ascended, but while two were still below and two were in the shaft a second explosion occurred. Haswell and H. Anderson were the two left below and they hung onto a pit <b>prop</b> whilst the <b>blast</b> lifted them and turned them.|$|R
