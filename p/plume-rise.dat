40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the effects of}} fire-induced <b>plume-rise</b> on the predicted export of carbon monoxide (CO) over Africa during SAFARI 2000 using the NCAR Community Atmosphere Model (CAM) with a CO tracer and <b>plume-rise</b> parameterization scheme. The <b>plume-rise</b> parameterization scheme simulates the consequences of strong buoyancy of hot gases emitted from biomass burning, including both dry and cloud-associated (pyrocumulus) lofting. The scheme was first adapted from a regional model. The current implementation of the <b>plume-rise</b> parameterization scheme into the global model provides an opportunity to {{examine the effect of}} <b>plume-rise</b> on long-range transport. The CAM simulation with the <b>plume-rise</b> parameterization scheme shows a substantial improvement of the agreements between the modeled and aircraft-measured vertical distribution of CO over southern Africa biomass burning area. The <b>plume-rise</b> mechanism plays a crucial role in lofting biomass burning pollutants to the middle troposphere. In the presence of deep convection we found that the <b>plume-rise</b> mechanism results in a decrease of CO concentration in the upper troposphere. The plume rise depletes the boundary layer, and thus leaves lower concentrations of CO to be lofted by the deep convection process. The effect of the <b>plume-rise</b> on free troposphere CO concentration is more important for the source area (short-distance transport) than for remote areas (long-distance transport). The <b>plume-rise</b> scheme also increases the CO export fluxes from Africa to the Atlantic and Indian Oceans. These results further confirm and extend previous findings in a regional model study. Effective lofting of large concentration of CO by the <b>plume-rise</b> mechanism also has implication for local air quality forecast in areas affected by other fire-related pollutants...|$|E
40|$|We use a space-based plume height {{climatology}} {{derived from}} observations {{made by the}} Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) instrument aboard the NASA Terra satellite to evaluate {{the ability of a}} <b>plume-rise</b> model currently embedded in several atmospheric chemical transport models (CTMs) to produce accurate smoke injection heights. We initialize the <b>plume-rise</b> model with assimilated meteorological fields from the NASA Goddard Earth Observing System and estimated fuel moisture content at the location and time of the MISR measurements. Fire properties that drive the <b>plume-rise</b> model are difficult to estimate and we test the model with four estimates for active fire area and four for total heat flux, obtained using empirical data and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) re radiative power (FRP) thermal anomalies available for each MISR plume. We show that the model is not able to reproduce the plume heights observed by MISR over the range of conditions studied (maximum r 2 obtained in all configurations is 0. 3). The model also fails to determine which plumes are in the free troposphere (according to MISR), key information needed for atmospheric models to simulate properly smoke dispersion. We conclude that embedding a <b>plume-rise</b> model using currently available re constraints in large-scale atmospheric studies remains a difficult proposition. However, we demonstrate {{the degree to which the}} fire dynamical heat flux (related to active fire area and sensible heat flux), and atmospheric stability structure influence plume rise, although other factors less well constrained (e. g., entrainment) may also be significant. Using atmospheric stability conditions, MODIS FRP, and MISR plume heights, we offer some constraints on the main physical factors that drive smoke plume rise. We find that smoke plumes reaching high altitudes are characterized by higher FRP and weaker atmospheric stability conditions than those at low altitude, which tend to remain confined below the BL, consistent with earlier results. We propose two simplified parameterizations for computing injection heights for fires in CTMs and discuss current challenges to representing plume injection heights in large scale atmospheric models...|$|E
40|$|A new {{methodology}} for {{the estimation of}} smoke-injection height from wild-land fires is proposed and evaluated. It is demonstrated that the approaches developed for estimating the plume rise from stacks, such as the formulas of G. Briggs, can be formally written in terms characterising the wild-land fires: fire energy, size and temperature. However, these semi-empirical methods still perform quite poorly because the physical processes controlling the uplift of the wildfire plumes differ from those controlling the plume rise from stacks. The proposed new methodology considers wildfire plumes in a way similar to Convective Available Potential Energy (CAPE) computations. The new formulations are applied to a dataset collected within the MISR Plume Height Project for about 2000 fire plumes in North America and Siberia. The estimates of the new method are compared with remote-sensing observations of the plume top by the MISR instrument, with {{two versions of the}} Briggs' <b>plume-rise</b> formulas, with the 1 -D <b>plume-rise</b> model BUOYANT, and with the prescribed plume-top position (the approach widely used in dispersion modelling). The new method has performed significantly better than all these approaches. For two-thirds of the cases, its predictions deviated from the MISR observations by less than 500 m, which is the uncertainty of the observations themselves. It is shown that the fraction of "good" predictions is much higher (> 80 %) for the plumes reaching the free troposphere...|$|E
40|$|The South American Biomass Burning Analysis (SAMBBA) field {{campaign}} took {{detailed in}} situ flight measurements of aerosol during the 2012 dry season to characterise biomass burning aerosol and improve {{understanding of its}} impacts on weather and climate. Developments {{have been made to}} the Weather Research and Forecast model with chemistry (WRF-Chem) model to improve the representation of biomass burning aerosol in the region, by coupling a sectional aerosol scheme to the <b>plume-rise</b> parameterisation. Brazilian Biomass Burning Emissions Model (3 BEM) fire emissions are used, prepared using PREP-CHEM-SRC, and mapped to CBM-Z and MOSAIC species. Model results have been evaluated against remote sensing products, AERONET sites, and four case studies of flight measurements from the SAMBBA campaign. WRF-Chem predicted layers of elevated aerosol loadings (5 – 20 μg sm − 3) of particulate organic matter at high altitude (6 – 8 km) over tropical forest regions, while flight measurements showed a sharp decrease above 2 – 4 km altitude. This difference was attributed to the <b>plume-rise</b> parameterisation overestimating injection height. The 3 BEM emissions product was modified using estimates of active fire size and burned area for the 2012 fire season, which reduced the fire size. The enhancement factor for fire emissions was increased from 1. 3 to 5 to retain reasonable aerosol optical depths (AODs). The smaller fire size lowered the injection height of the emissions, but WRF-Chem still showed elevated aerosol loadings between 4 – 5 km altitude. Over eastern cerrado (savannah-like) regions, both modelled and measured aerosol loadings decreased above approximately 4 km altitude. Compared with MODIS satellite data and AERONET sites, WRF-Chem represented AOD magnitude well (between 0. 3 – 1. 5) over western tropical forest fire regions {{in the first half of}} the campaign, but tended to over-predict them in the second half, when precipitation was more significant. Over eastern cerrado regions, WRF-Chem tended to under-predict AODs. Modelled aerosol loadings in the east were higher in the modified emission scenario. The primary organic matter to black carbon ratio was typically between 8 – 10 in WRF-Chem. This was lower than the western flight measurements (interquartile range of 11. 6 – 15. 7 in B 734, 14. 7 – 24. 0 in B 739), but similar to the eastern flight B 742 (8. 1 – 10. 4). However, single scattering albedo was close to measured over the western flights (0. 87 – 0. 89 in model; 0. 86 – 0. 91 in flight B 734, and 0. 81 – 0. 95 in flight B 739 measurements) but too high over the eastern flight B 742 (0. 86 – 0. 87 in model, 0. 79 – 0. 82 in measurements). This suggests that improvements are needed to both modelled aerosol composition and optical properties calculations in WRF-Chem...|$|E
30|$|We {{calculate}} the time-dependent physical states (temperature, pore pressure, {{mass flow rate}} of liquid/vapor, and heat flow) over four steps. First, assuming homogenous permeability for the entire space and boundary conditions of 15  °C and 1.013  ×  105  Pa at the ground surface, the model is run for 105 years until it reaches a quasi-steady state. Second, we reduce pressure at the ground surface from 1.013  ×  105 to 1.013  ×  103  Pa and run the model until another quasi-steady state is achieved (105 years). This step is used to induce an unsaturated zone within a shallow part of the edifice, since HOTH 2 O equation of state cannot explicitly deal with air. The unsaturated zone is treated as a two-phase zone of H 2 O over a less-than-atmospheric pressure range. Third, the high-permeability conduit and the surrounding low-permeability caprock are introduced {{in the middle of}} the slope and at the same time hydrothermal fluid (350  °C, 75  kg s− 1) is injected at the bottom of conduit to reproduce fumarolic heat discharge of about 100  MW, a value estimated by applying the <b>plume-rise</b> method (Kagiyama 1978) to time-lapse photographs of the plume in 2004 (picture data courtesy of JMA), after reaching a quasi-steady condition (103 years). Fourth and finally, an abrupt reduction of permeability is imposed at a particular depth in the conduit, and the system response is observed for about 10  years.|$|E
40|$|In this study, we {{describe}} how WRF-Sfire is coupled with WRF-Chem to construct WRFSC, an integrated forecast system for wildfire and smoke prediction. The integrated forecast system {{has the advantage}} of not requiring a simple <b>plume-rise</b> model and assumptions about the size and heat release from the fire in order to determine fire emissions into the atmosphere. With WRF-Sfire, wildfire spread, plume and plume-top heights are predicted directly, at every WRF time-step, providing comprehensive meteorology and fire emissions to the chemical transport model WRF-Chem. Evaluation of WRFSC was based on comparisons between available observations to the results of two WRFSC simulations. The study found overall good agreement between forecasted and observed fire spread and smoke transport for the Witch-Guejito fire. Also the simulated PM 2. 5 (fine particulate mat-ter) peak concentrations matched the observations. However, the NO and ozone levels were underestimated in the simulations and the peak concentrations were mistimed. Determining the terminal or plume-top height {{is one of the most}} important aspects of simulating wildfire plume transport, and the study found overall good agreement between simulated and observed plume-top heights, with some (10 % or less) underestimation by the simulations. One of the most promising results of the study was the agreement between passive-tracer modeled plume-top heights for the Barker Canyon fire simulation and observations. This simulation took only 13 h, with the first 24 h forecast ready in almost 3 h, making it a possible operational tool for providing emission profiles for external chemical transport models. 1 a...|$|E
40|$|Aircraft {{measurements}} {{taken as}} part of POLARCAT campaign (the Polar Study using Aircraft, Remote Sensing, Surface Measurements and Models, of Climate, Chemistry, Aerosols, and Transport) in the Arctic were aimed at investigating pollution transport and atmospheric chemistry. Anthropogenic pollution and boreal forest fire emissions followed by subsequent transport to the Arctic were measured in summer 2008. We combine aircraft measurements with simulations using the WRF-Chem model (Weather Research and Forecasting Model including aerosol and chemistry) to investigate cases of pollution transport to the Arctic during summer 2008. Two case studies are investigated in this work. The dynamics for transport of fire plumes originating over Canada {{that as well as}} anthropogenic pollution plumes primarily from the north east US will be presented to gain insight into the origin and fate of pollution transported to the Arctic. We also investigate the transport and evolution of anthropogenic pollution from East Asia. Model results are compared with high-resolution aircraft data obtained during POLARCAT in order to investigate the critical processes responsible for horizontal and vertical transport. We also investigate the impact of boreal fire and anthropogenic emissions on the subsequent production of ozone in plumes during transport to the Arctic. The WRF-Chem model simulates the emission, transport, mixing, and chemical transformation of trace gases and aerosols simultaneously with the meteorology. The treatment of forest fire emissions is taken into account using the online <b>plume-rise</b> model that predicts fire plume injection height. By comparing model results with POLARCAT aircraft data from summer 2008, we provide a means for interpreting the POLARCAT aircraft data set with the goal of improving our understanding of pollution transport to the Arctic. The contribution of the processes leading to Arctic pollution will be discussed including stratosphere to troposphere exchange, import of pollutants from remote sources through longrange transport, and local photochemistry...|$|E
40|$|International audienceVolcanoes {{are natural}} {{composite}} hazards. The volcanic ejecta can have considerable impact on human health. Volcanic gases and ash, {{can be especially}} harmful to people with lung disease such as asthma. Volcanic gases that pose the greatest potential hazards are sulfur dioxide, carbon dioxide, and hydrogen fluoride. Locally, sulfur dioxide gas can lead to acid rain and air pollution downwind from a volcano. These gases can come from lava flows as well as volcano eruptive plumes. This acidic pollution can be transported by wind over large distances. To comply with regulatory rules, modeling tools are needed to accurately predict the contribution of volcanic emissions to air quality degradation. Unfortunately, the ability of existing models to simulate volcanic plume production and dispersion is currently limited by inaccurate volcanic emissions and uncertainties in <b>plume-rise</b> estimates. The present work {{is dedicated to the}} study of deep injections of volcanic emissions into the troposphere developed as consequence of intense but localized input of heat near eruptive mouths. This work covers three aspects. First a precise quantification of heat sources in terms of surface, geometry and heat source intensity is done for the Piton de la Fournaise volcano. Second, large eddy simulation (LES) are performed with the Meso-NH model to determine the dynamics and vertical development of volcanic plumes. The estimated energy fluxes and the geometry of the heat source is used at the bottom boundary to generate and sustain the plume, while, passive tracers are used to represent volcanic gases and their injection into the atmosphere. The realism of the simulated plumes is validated on the basis of plume observations. The LES simulations finally serve as references for the development of column parameterizations for the coarser resolution version of the model which is the third aspect of the present work. At spatial resolution coarser than ~ 1 km, buoyant volcanic plumes are sub-grid processes. A new parameterization for the injection height is presented which is based on {{a modified version of the}} eddy-diffusivity/mass-flux scheme initially developed for the simulation of convective boundary layer...|$|E
40|$|Slow-spreading mid-ocean ridges {{such as the}} Mid-Atlantic Ridge are {{characterized}} by deep axial rift valleys which are isolated from the water on the ridge flanks. Topographic effects therefore {{have a significant impact}} on the rift-valley hydrography and dynamics but little is known about the details. Known processes of global importance acting near the axes of midocean ridges include high rates of diapycnal mixing associated with the rough topography and high-temperature hydrothermal circulation, a major source for a number of chemical constituents of the ocean. Physical data sets from the rift valley of two connected segments of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, which include the largest known hydrothermal vent field of the Atlantic, were analyzed to investigate the segment-scale hydrography, dynamics and geothermal fluxes. The data include two quasi-synoptic hydrographic and particle plume surveys (one year apart) and one-year-long records from an array of moored current meters. The hydrographic properties of the rift-valley water were similar during the two surveys, suggesting a stable state characterized by inflow from the eastern ridge flank, unidirectional along-segment flow (directly observed during an entire year), and monotonic along-valley hydrographic gradients consistent with high rates of diapycnal mixing. Geothermal processes do not appear to contribute significantly to these patterns. The data contain signatures of a range of dynamical processes consistent with high rates of diapycnal mixing, including hydraulically controlled sill flows, topographic lee waves and high-energy tidal flows. The spatial distribution of the light-scattering anomalies associated with the dispersing hydrothermal particle plume are consistent with the dynamical observations. Close to the vent field the particle distribution is highly inhomogeneous but density-averaged profiles indicate that the mean plume is Gaussian in depth. To quantify the fluxes associated with the hydrothermal plume the corresponding hydrographic anomalies were determined. The complexity of the hydrography within the rift valley precludes the application of "standard" methods ho that a new method had to be developed resulting in the first quantitative hydrographic anomaly measurements of an Atlantic hydrothermal plume. The hydrographic and particle anomalies of this plume are linearly correlated, indicating that the particles behave conservatively in the near field. Estimates for the heat flux associated with the hydrothermal plume were derived using two established methods, one based on <b>plume-rise</b> modeling and the other on the advection of heat anomalies away from the vent field. Height-of-rise modeling yields values which are an order of magnitude too low because the plume model relies on a point-source assumption which is violated by the geometry of the vent field. The uncertainties associated with the advection method are particularly small at the site studied because of the uni-directionality of the flow field, the small uncertainties of the hydrographic anomaly measurements, and the Gaussian shape of the averaged near-field plume. The resulting estimate for the heat flux associated with the particle plume is 2. 5 GW. Mass and heat budgets of the rift valley indicate that high diapycnal diffusivities are required to account for the hydrographic observations and suggest that a portion of the water flowing along the rift valley may be lost to the overlying water column. Inspired by the observations a simple analytical and numerical model for the flow within the rift valley was developed. The results indicate that the rift valley acts as an efficient low-pass filter with characteristic time scales of weeks to months, providing a plausible explanation for the persistence of the along-segment flow...|$|E
40|$|Here {{we respond}} to the {{comments}} by Cole-Dai et al. [2014] on our article Schmidt et al. [2012]. Specifically, in response to section 2 of their reply, we argued in Schmidt et al. [2012] that based on previously published estimates of the volatile release height during the 1783 - 1784 C. E. Laki eruption, {{the lack of a}} sulfur massindependent fractionation (MIF) anomaly is expected. In other words, no previous study on Laki ever argued that this eruption emitted SO 2 into altitudes > 13 - 15 km. In section 2. 3, Cole-Dai et al. [2014] argue that the nonzero 33 S value of their Laki sample 1 may be explained by a short-lived explosive phase at Laki during which volatiles reached the stratosphere. In Schmidt et al. [2012] in section 2, we argued in agreement with Cole-Dai et al. [2014] (section 3. 1) that for a MIF anomaly to be preserved, the Laki volatiles would have had to be emitted in > 20 km altitude. Our main point is that eruption column heights > 20 km are unlikely based on the historical accounts and <b>plume-rise</b> modeling for the Laki eruption [Stothers et al., 1986; Woods, 1993; Thordarson and Self, 2003]. In Schmidt et al. [2012], we argued that to deduce a short-lived climatic impact of the Laki eruption based on the lack of a MIF anomaly and the length of the sulfate deposition in Greenland ice cores may be misleading because the climatic impact will outlast the radiative forcing of the Laki aerosol cloud. Cole-Dai et al. [2014] acknowledge the latter in their reply in section 4. 2. We agreewith Cole-Dai et al. [2014] in that themagnitude and length of the climatic impact during the winter of 1783 - 1784 depends on the altitude of the volatile release during the eruption (sections 2. 3 and 4. 2). However, even if we assumed that during Laki all sulfur dioxide (SO 2) would have been released in the troposphere, then the aerosol cloud would still be present in the upper troposphere during March 1784, as is evident from independent model simulations of this "tropospheric-only" scenario [Stevenson et al., 2003]. We acknowledge that there is uncertainty on the volatile release height for Laki; however, it is worth considering that those climate model simulations that used an injection altitude between 9 km and 13 km for the Laki SO 2 [Highwood and Stevenson, 2003; Oman et al., 2006 a, 2006 b; Schmidt et al., 2012] best match the observed temperature changes during summer of 1783 [Angell and Korshover, 1985; Brzdil et al., 2010; Briffa et al., 1998; D'Arrigo and Jacoby, 1999; Jacoby et al., 1999; Kington, 1988; Manley, 1974; Parker et al., 1992; Thordarson and Self, 2003]. Based on these model simulations, a climatic impact during the winter of 1783 - 1784, albeit weaker than during the climactic phases of Laki, is expected (and our argument here does not exclude the role of natural variability in contributing to the cold winter of 1783 - 1784 as discussed in Schmidt et al. [2012]). Therefore, we continue to argue that for high-latitude eruptions such as Laki, the applicability of sulfur isotopic measurements to interpret the climatic relevance has yet to be demonstrated. Itmay transpire that the interpretation of MIF signals for the climate-relevance of an eruption is valid and unambiguous only for short-lived explosive eruptions in the tropics. In terms of the processes producing a MIF anomaly (section 3. 3 in Cole-Dai et al. [2014]), the works by Hattori et al. [2013] and Ono et al. [2013] suggest that there are remaining issues not discussed by Cole-Dai et al. [2014], for instance, self-shielding of SO 2 due to high column densities typical for eruptions of Pinatubo-scale and greater, and the preservation of the MIF signature in general...|$|E
