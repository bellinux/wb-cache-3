5|$|Some {{species of}} marine animals exist and rely, {{directly}} or indirectly, on the phytoplankton. Antarctic sea life includes penguins, blue whales, orcas, colossal squids and fur seals. The emperor <b>penguin</b> {{is the only}} <b>penguin</b> that breeds during the winter in Antarctica, while the Adélie <b>penguin</b> breeds farther south than any other <b>penguin.</b> The southern rockhopper <b>penguin</b> has distinctive feathers around the eyes, giving the appearance of elaborate eyelashes. King penguins, chinstrap penguins, and gentoo penguins also breed in the Antarctic.|$|E
5|$|Together {{with the}} {{similarly}} coloured but smaller king <b>penguin</b> (A. patagonicus), the emperor <b>penguin</b> {{is one of}} two extant species in the genus Aptenodytes. Fossil evidence of a third species—Ridgen's <b>penguin</b> (A. ridgeni)—has been found in fossil records from the late Pliocene, about three million years ago, in New Zealand. Studies of <b>penguin</b> behaviour and genetics have proposed that the genus Aptenodytes is basal; in other words, that it split off from a branch which led to all other living <b>penguin</b> species. Mitochondrial and nuclear DNA evidence suggests this split occurred around 40million years ago.|$|E
5|$|A {{special edition}} of 50 copies of Pinfold, on large paper, was {{prepared}} at Waugh's expense for presentation to his friends. The first <b>Penguin</b> paperback was issued in 1962, followed by numerous reissues in the following years, including a <b>Penguin</b> Modern Classic edition in 1999. It has also been translated into several languages.|$|E

50|$|It {{is one of}} the crested <b>penguins</b> (a {{different}} genus {{from the}} similarly named king or emperor <b>penguins).</b> There is some controversy over whether royal <b>penguins</b> are a subspecies of macaroni <b>penguins.</b> Individuals of the two groups have been known to interbreed, though this is a relatively rare occurrence. Indeed, other <b>penguins</b> have been known to form mixed-species pairs in the wild.|$|R

5|$|Edinburgh Zoo's long {{association}} with penguins began in January 1914, {{with the arrival}} of three king penguins from the Christian Salvesen whaling expedition which docked in Leith. The subsequent successful hatching of a king <b>penguin</b> chick in 1919 was the first <b>penguin</b> to be hatched in captivity. These were the first penguins to be seen outside of the South Atlantic anywhere in the world. The now famous daily <b>penguin</b> parade started by accident in 1950 with the escape of several birds. This proved so popular with visitors and the penguins that it is a daily feature of the zoo today.|$|E
50|$|Perhaps one in 50,000 <b>penguins</b> (of most species) {{are born}} with brown rather than black plumage.

[...] Plans for the channel (which launched October 1, 2009) include local and nationally-originated <b>Penguins</b> and hockey coverage (including [...] "NHL Live" [...] and league commissioner Gary Bettman’s weekly “NHL Hour"), rebroadcasts of classic <b>Penguins</b> games, and game broadcasts of the team's top farm club in Wilkes-Barre/Scranton. The move will make the <b>Penguins</b> the second North American professional sports team (the first NHL team) with their own terrestrial radio channel (after the NFL's Dallas Cowboys and their HD2 relationship with KRLD-FM).|$|R
