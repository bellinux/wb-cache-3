5|$|Madonna became {{interested}} in collaborating with Timberlake after hearing his 2006 album FutureSex/LoveSounds. Together they developed a number of songs for the album, but {{the basis of the}} development was Pharrell Williams' demos. Madonna had a number of songs written down for the album, which amazed Timberlake. They had intensive discussions among themselves before recording a song. Later, Madonna recalled that most of the songs on Hard Candy were autobiographical in many respects. However, according to her this was not intentional and happened while she was in the <b>process</b> <b>of</b> <b>developing</b> the album.|$|E

5|$|Researchers {{have argued}} that {{cognitive}} flexibility is also a component of multiple classification, as originally described by psychologist Jean Piaget. In multiple classification tasks, participants (primarily children, who have already developed or are in the <b>process</b> <b>of</b> <b>developing</b> this skill) must classify objects in several different ways at once - thereby thinking flexibly about them. Similarly, {{in order to be}} cognitively flexible they must overcome centration, which is the tendency for young children to solely focus on one aspect of an object or situation. For example, when children are young they may be solely able to focus on one aspect of an object (i.e. color of object), and be unable to focus on both aspects (i.e. both color and kind of object). Thus, research suggests if an individual is centrated in their thinking, then they will be more cognitively inflexible.|$|E

5|$|Tropical Storm Jeanne quickly {{organized}} {{over the}} eastern Caribbean Sea, developing a tight inner core and well-defined outflow as it tracked over warm water temperatures of about 84°F (29°C). Initially, {{the storm was}} forecast to attain hurricane status before crossing Puerto Rico. However, its organization deteriorated by early on September 15, with radar imagery tracking a low-level circulation {{moving away from the}} convection. The temporary weakening was due increased shear and dry air. At 1600UTC on September 15, Jeanne made landfall near Guayama, Puerto Rico with winds of 70mph (115km/h), and as it moved ashore it was in the <b>process</b> <b>of</b> <b>developing</b> an eye. Across the territory, the storm produced heavy rainfall, peaking at 23.75inches (605mm) on Vieques Island. Rainfall across the region resulted in moderate to severe river flooding, with several river stations in Puerto Rico reporting historical levels. Light winds, generally around tropical storm force, affected the region as well.|$|E
5|$|In 1995, the NPS {{began the}} <b>process</b> <b>of</b> <b>developing</b> a {{management}} {{plan for the}} Cumberland Island horse. After compiling information, they released a draft environmental assessment in early 1996 and began taking public comment on a potential management plan. Public opinion was severely divided, with environmentalists approving of the management plan, which would have likely resulted in the reduction or removal of the herd, and animal rights activists and island residents protesting the plan. However, before a plan could be implemented, US Representative Jack Kingston included a provision in a federal appropriations bill that prevented any management of the horses. Kingston made the change to the bill after touring the island, but without consultation with the NPS. He initially claimed that he personally did not see significant damage to the island from the horses, and that the herd size had decreased. However, upon later questioning, he refused to expand upon his observations of {{the damage to the}} island. The provision expired in 1997, but effectively halted momentum toward a park management plan. The study published in 2000 recommended a management strategy that reduced herd populations to environmentally-recommended sizes through a combination of off-island adoption to private owners and contraceptives. The researchers recommended that contraceptive use be focused on the female members of the herd, due to the high numbers of bachelor stallions.|$|E
