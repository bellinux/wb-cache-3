40|$|A {{numerical}} {{model of a}} servoactuator and of a four-port proportional direction control valve has been developed. Mechanical and hydraulic elements have been simulated in the LMS Amesim environment. The complete model has been validated {{on the basis of}} the experimental time histories of the actuator velocity and of the flow-rate controlled by the <b>proportional</b> <b>valve.</b> The validation data have been acquired on a fluid power system used to test electro-hydraulic servovalves according to ISO 10770 - 1 standard. The measurement of the instantaneous flow-rate through the valve has been performed with an innovative high-dynamics flowmeter, recently developed for high-pressure liquid flows. Furthermore, the model predicted static characteristic of the <b>proportional</b> <b>valve</b> has been compared with a corresponding experimentally derived curve and an analysis of the cause-and-effect relationships has been carried out for the valve static performance. Measured data on valve leakages have also been presented in order to complete the steadystate characterization of the tested valve. The developed model of the hydraulic system has been then applied to realize the Bode diagram of the <b>proportional</b> <b>valve,</b> which is expressed in terms of instantaneous flow-rate as a function of the sinusoidal driving command, as well as the Bode diagram of the subsystem made up of the <b>proportional</b> <b>valve</b> and of the linear actuator.
