60|$|SECOND, In {{the case}} of each Poem, any Note written by Wordsworth himself, as {{explanatory}} of it, comes first, and has the initials W. W., with the date of its first insertion placed after it. Next follows the Fenwick Note, within square brackets, thus [ ], and signed I. F.; and, afterwards, any editorial note required. When, however, Wordsworth's own notes were placed {{at the end of}} the Poems, or at the foot of the page, his plan is adopted, and the date appended. I should have been glad, had it been possible--the editors of the twentieth century may note this--to print Wordsworth's own notes, the Fenwick notes, and the Editor's in different type, and in type of a decreasing size; but the idea occurred to me too late, i. e. after the first volume had been <b>passed</b> <b>for</b> <b>press.</b>|$|E
60|$|The {{contents}} of this volume require some explanation of an historical nature. It is scarcely realised {{by the present}} generation that Wilde's works on their first appearance, {{with the exception of}} De Profundis, were met with almost general condemnation and ridicule. The plays on their first production were grudgingly praised because their obvious success could not be ignored; but on their subsequent publication in book form they were violently assailed. That nearly all of them have held the stage is still a source of irritation among certain journalists. Salome however enjoys a singular career. As every one knows, it was prohibited by the Censor when in rehearsal by Madame Bernhardt at the Palace Theatre in 1892. On its publication in 1893 it was greeted with greater abuse than any other of Wilde's works, and was consigned to the usual irrevocable oblivion. The accuracy of the French was freely canvassed, and of course {{it is obvious that the}} French is not that of a Frenchman. The play was <b>passed</b> <b>for</b> <b>press,</b> however, by no less a writer than Marcel Schwob whose letter to the Paris publisher, returning the proofs and mentioning two or three slight alterations, is still in my possession. Marcel Schwob told me some years afterwards that he thought it would have spoiled the spontaneity and character of Wilde's style if he had tried to harmonise it with the diction demanded by the French Academy. It was never composed with any idea of presentation. Madame Bernhardt happened to say she wished Wilde would write a play for her; he replied in jest that he had done so. She insisted on seeing the manuscript, and decided on its immediate production, ignorant or forgetful of the English law which prohibits the introduction of Scriptural characters on the stage. With his keen sense of the theatre Wilde would never have contrived the long speech of Salome at the end in a drama intended for the stage, even in the days of long speeches. His threat to change his nationality shortly after the Censor's interference called forth a most delightful and good- natured caricature of him by Mr. Bernard Partridge in Punch.|$|E
5000|$|As was the {{law at the}} time, {{the play}} was vetted by the Lord Chamberlain's Office and <b>passed</b> <b>for</b> performance. Several <b>press</b> {{articles}} [...] referred to the new play but suddenly, and without explanation, the theatre substituted Mary Broome, a four-act comedy from 1912 by Allan Monkhouse, in its place.|$|R
25|$|The {{printing}} process involves the substrate <b>passing</b> through <b>presses</b> <b>for</b> lithographic printing, intaglio printing, numbering printing, and varnish printing. The inks are transferred using the prepared plates, which are replaced when worn. The opacifier layers enable the inks of the offset and intaglio printing {{to adhere to}} the substrate. The varnish printing stage applies a required protective varnish to the polymer substrate. Offset printing deposits a 1.5µm layer, intaglio about 24µm, and the protective varnish is about 2µm thick.|$|R
6000|$|The scene now {{changes to}} the {{newspaper}} office. The writer of the article has discovered his mistake and wants to correct it by the next day: {{but the next day}} is Sunday. He cannot post a letter, so he rings up the paper and dictates a letter by telephone. He leaves the title to his friends at the other end; he knows that they can spell [...] "Gray," [...] as no doubt they can: but the letter is put down by journalistic custom in a pencil scribble and the vowel may well be doubtful. The friend writes {{at the top of the}} letter [...] "'G. K. C.' Explains," [...] putting the initials in quotation marks. The next man <b>passing</b> it <b>for</b> <b>press</b> is bored with these initials (I am with him there) and crosses them out, substituting with austere civility, [...] "Mr. Chesterton Explains." [...] But and now he hears the iron laughter of the Fates, for the blind bolt is about to fall&mdash;but he neglects to cross out the second [...] "quote" [...] (as we call it) and it goes up to press with a [...] "quote" [...] between the last words. Another quotation mark at the end of [...] "explains" [...] was the work of one merry moment for the printers upstairs. So the inverted commas were lifted entirely off one word on to the other and a totally innocent title suddenly turned into a blasting sneer. But that would have mattered nothing so far, for there was nothing to sneer at. In the same dark hour, however, there was a printer who was (I suppose) so devoted to this Government that he could think of no Gray but Sir Edward Grey. He spelt it [...] "Grey" [...] by a mere misprint, and the whole tale was complete: first blunder, second blunder, and final condemnation.|$|R
5000|$|In March 2001, Feldman {{was in the}} White House and {{composed}} a note <b>for</b> <b>Press</b> Secretary Ari Fleischer. She walked into his office in his absence to lay the note in his inbox. However, a staffer told her {{he would not be}} returning the next day, so she took her note back intending to hand it to him the next time she saw him. This was used as an excuse to suspend her <b>press</b> <b>pass</b> <b>for</b> 90 days and begin a whispering campaign that she was a [...] "security risk" [...] and telling Washington figures [...] "not to talk to her". That informal denial of access continues.|$|R
6000|$|The Vision of Judgment, begun May 7 (but {{probably}} laid aside till September 11), was {{forwarded to}} Murray October 4, 1821. [...] "By this post," [...] {{he wrote to}} Moore, October 6, 1821 (Letters, 1901, v. 387), [...] "I have sent my nightmare to balance the incubus of Southey's impudent anticipation of the Apotheosis of George the Third." [...] A chance perusal of Southey's letter in the Courier (see Medwin's Conversations, 1824, p. 222, and letters to Douglas Kinnaird, February 6, 25, 1822) quickened his desire for publication; {{but in spite of}} many appeals and suggestions to Murray, who had sent Byron's [...] "copy" [...] to his printer, the decisive step of <b>passing</b> the proofs <b>for</b> <b>press</b> was never taken. At length Byron lost patience, and desired Murray to hand over [...] "the corrected copy of the proof with the Preface" [...] of the Vision of Judgment to John Hunt (see letters to Murray, July 3, 6, 1822, Letters, 1901, vi. 92, 93). Finally, a year after the MS. had been sent to England, the Vision of Judgment, by Quevedo Redivivus, appeared in the first number (pp. 1-39) of the Liberal, which was issued October 15, 1822. The Preface, to Byron's astonishment and annoyance, was not forthcoming (see letter to Murray, October 22, 1822, Letters, 1901, vi. 126, and Examiner, Sunday, November 3, 1822, p. 697), and is not prefixed to the first issue of the Vision of Judgment in the first number of the Liberal.|$|R
