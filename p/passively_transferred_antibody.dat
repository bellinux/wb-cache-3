However, {{inhibition of}} vaccine-induced seroconversion by maternal antibodies after vaccination remains a problem, as it leaves infants susceptible to MV infection. In cotton rats, passive transfer of MV-specific IgG mimics maternal antibodies and inhibits vaccine-induced seroconversion. Here, {{we report that}} immunization {{in the presence of}} <b>passively</b> <b>transferred</b> IgG inhibits the secretion of neutralizing antibodies but not the generation of MV-specific B cells. This finding suggested that MV-specific B cells require an additional stimulus to mature into antibody-secreting plasma cells. In order to provide such a stimulus, we generated a recombinant Newcastle disease virus (NDV) expressing the MV hemagglutinin (NDV-H). In contrast to MV, NDV-H induced high levels of type I interferon in plasmacytoid dendritic cells and in lung tissue. In cotton rats immunized with NDV-H, neutralizing antibodies were also generated in the presence of <b>passively</b> <b>transferred</b> <b>antibodies.</b> In the latter case, however, the level and kinetics of antibody generation were reduced. In vitro, alpha interferon stimulated the activation of MV-specific B cells from MV-immune spleen cells. NDV infection (which induces alpha interferon) had the same effect, and stimulation could be abrogated by antibodies neutralizing alpha interferon, but not interleukin 6 (IL- 6). In vivo, coapplication of UV-inactivated MV with NDV led to increased MV-specific antibody production in the presence and absence of <b>passively</b> <b>transferred</b> <b>antibodies.</b> These data indicate that MV-specific B cells are being generated after immunization in the presence of maternal antibodies and that the provision of alpha interferon as an additional signal leads to antibody secretion...|$|R
40|$|Numerous {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} that the humoral and cell-mediated immune response can be modulated by actively synthesized, as well as by <b>passively</b> <b>transferred</b> <b>antibody</b> (1 - 9). The most frequently observed effect of passively administered antibody is the suppressed development of immunological responses by 7 S antibodies (1, 2, 10 - 14). However, in certain circumstances both 7 S and 19 S antibodies have been shown to enhance the immune response (2, 3). While feedback control of the B-cell (bursa- or bone marrowderived) response by passive antibody has been extensively studied, little information is available with regard to its effect on the development of T-cell responses (15). Studies have shown that delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) ' appears less readily affected than the primary antibody response (1). In fact, Uhr and MSller (1) reported that development of DTH was facilitated by antigen-antibody complex. Liew and Parish (5) have shown that suppression of antibody formation was accompanied by a concomitant increase in DTH. These results, in addition to those reported by Mackaness and Lagrange (4), suggest that an inverse relationship often exists between DTH and the humoral immun...|$|E
40|$|Mice {{infected}} with Schistosoma mansoni acquire a partial resistance to subsequent challenge infection (1). A {{number of studies}} have suggested that this immunity is directed in large part against the early schistosomulum during the period immediately after its entry into the host (1 - 3).

An intriguing mechanism for explaining the resistance of older parasites to immune killing was proposed by Smithers et al. (4). These investigators demonstrated the presence of substances of host origin on the integument of adult schistosomes and speculated that host molecules might promote the survival of the parasites by masking target antigens on the worm surface. In support of their hypothesis, a correlation was demonstrated between the acquisition of host molecules by schistosomula and the inability of the larvae to bind antibodies directed against parasite antigens (5, 6). Nevertheless, no direct evidence has been obtained supporting a protective role for host molecules, and other changes in the integument could account for the ability o...|$|E
40|$|It {{has long}} been {{recognized}} that preexisting antibody, either endogenously formed, or passively administered near {{the time of the}} injection of the corresponding antigen, can affect the subsequent antibody response. An excess or, in some cases, even an equivalent amount of passively administered antibody can partially or completely inhibit the primary response in a previously unchallenged animal (1 - 12) and passively administered or previously synthesized antibody may, under certain conditions, diminish the response to a secondary challenge (10, 13 - 15). On the other hand, with certain antigens, relatively small amounts of passively administered antibody actually may enhance the antibody response (12, 16 - 18). The mechanism by which preexisting or <b>passively</b> <b>transferred</b> <b>antibody</b> suppresses the antibody response is not entirely clear. It could be either by covering the immunogenic sites of the antigen and thereby preventing or diminishing the immunogenic stimulus, or by a direct suppressive action on the cells destined to respond to the antigen. In the broad sense, either of these actions might be considered a "feedback mechanism " since the product of the response, antibody, would serve, directly or indirectly...|$|E

40|$|The {{inhibition}} of vaccination by maternal antibodies {{is a widely}} observed phenomenon in human and veterinary medicine. Maternal antibodies are known to suppress the B-cell response. This is similar to antibody feedback mechanism studies where <b>passively</b> <b>transferred</b> <b>antibody</b> inhibits the B-cell response against particulate antigens because of epitope masking. In the absence of experimental data addressing the mechanism underlying inhibition by maternal antibodies, {{it has been suggested}} that epitope masking explains the inhibition by maternal antibodies, too. Here we report that in the cotton rat model of measles virus (MV) vaccination passively transferred MV-specific immunoglobulin G inhibit B-cell responses through cross-linking of the B-cell receptor with FcγRIIB. The extent of inhibition increases with the number of antibodies engaging FcγRIIB and depends on the Fc region of antibody and its isotype. This inhibition can be partially overcome by injection of MV-specific monoclonal IgM antibody. IgM stimulates the B-cell directly through cross-linking the B-cell receptor via complement protein 3 d and antigen to the complement receptor 2 signaling complex. These data demonstrate that maternal antibodies inhibit B-cell responses by interaction with the inhibitory/regulatory FcγRIIB receptor and not through epitope masking...|$|E

40|$|The suppressing {{activity}} of <b>passively</b> <b>transferred</b> <b>antibodies</b> on antibody synthesis against sheep red cells was investigated at the cellular level by the agar-plaque technique developed by Jerne. Humoral antibodies injected {{prior to the}} antigen suppressed the appearance of plaque-forming spleen cells producing 19 S antibodies completely. Antibodies given during the first 4 days after antigen injection also showed such action, but only after a latency period of 40 hours. The inhibiting efficiency of 7 S antibodies was about 100 to 200 times {{greater than that of}} 19 S antibodies. The results support the conclusion that humoral antibodies inhibit the immune response by removing the stimulus for the proliferation of the antibody producing cells and not by directly depressing antibody synthesis in already committed cells. <b>Passively</b> <b>transferred</b> <b>antibodies</b> inhibited the 7 S response if given prior to, or 24 hours after the antigen injection, in analogy with previous results concerning 19 S response. In contrast to these previous results on 19 S synthesis, <b>antibody</b> <b>transfer</b> had no detectable effect during the early exponential phase of 7 S production (5 to 7 days after antigen injection). Only limited inhibition was observed 3 days after the antigen. One possible explanation of this difference is that 7 S-producing cells do not divide, or divide at a slow rate. Antigen injection would stimulate the proliferation of 19 S-producing cells. Subsequently these would switch to the synthesis of 7 S antibodies. These would inhibit the initiation of new 19 S-producing cells by combining with the antigen. They would thus suppress the recruitment of their own precursors. A steady state of 7 S antibody production by cells with a long lifetime would be the result. This hypothesis ascribes an important regulatory function to 7 S antibodies. They would be parts of a feed-back system preventing excessive cell multiplication in response to a single antigen...|$|R

40|$|URL] zona pellucida 3 (mZP 3), {{is being}} {{developed}} for fertility control in mice. A single inoculation of the recombinant virus induces complete infertility in female BALB/c mice which persists for the breeding life of the animal. The extent of this autoimmune response was unexpected especially as the incorporation of mZP 3 appears to have immunologically attenuated {{the growth of the}} recombinant virus. The histological features of the infection are an initial depletion in tertiary follicles by 21 days post inoculation followed by a progressive depletion of primordial follicles, leading to an almost complete absence of follicles by 150 days post-infection. High titre, long lasting, zona pellucida-specific antibody is present in infertile BALB/c mice although infertility has not been linked with either a critical titre or a dominant immunoglobulin isotype. However, our evidence suggests that anti-ZP 3 antibody plays a primary role in infertility since antibodies are detected in vivo bound to the zona pellucida of ovaries from recombinant virus-infected mice, and <b>passively</b> <b>transferred</b> <b>antibody</b> from infected animals induces infertility in the absence of recombinant virus.

In the present study, we sought to identify the components of the adaptive immune response which contribute to protection against disseminating anaerobic infections and sepsis. For this purpose, various genetically engineered immunodeficient mice were employed, including RAG- 2 SCID, Igh- 6 (B-cell deficient), Tcrb Tcrd (T-cell deficient) and Hc 0 (C 5 deficient). For abscess induction, the mandibular first molars were subjected to pulp exposure on day 0. Teeth were infected with a mixture of four anaerobic pathogens, including Prevotella intermedia, Streptococcus intermedius, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Peptostreptococcus micros, and teeth were sealed to prevent communication with the oral cavity. The findings demonstrate that both RAG- 2 SCID and B-cell-deficient mice, but not T-cell- or C 5 -deficient mice, have increased susceptibility to the development of disseminating anaerobic infections. Abscess-susceptible RAG- 2 SCID and B-cell-deficient mice also showed a significant loss of body weight, splenomegaly, and absent antibacterial antibody production.

Gammaherpesvirus 68 (γHV 68) infection of mice provides a model well suited to defining contributions of specific immune system components to the control of viral latency. B cells play a critical role in regulating γHV 68 latency, but the mechanism(s) by which B cells regulate latency is not known. In the experiments reported here, we determined the effect of <b>passively</b> <b>transferred</b> <b>antibody</b> on established γHV 68 latency in B-cell-deficient (B-cell−/−) mice. Immune antibody decreased the frequency of cells reactivating ex vivo from latency in splenocytes (> 10 -fold) and peritoneal cells (> 100 -fold) and the frequency of cells carrying latent viral genome in splenocytes (> 5 -fold) and peritoneal cells (> 50 -fold). This effect required virus-specific antibody and was observed when total and virus-specific serum antibody concentrations in recipient B-cell−/− mice were < 8 % of those in normal mice during latent infection. Passive transfer of antibody specific for the lytic cycle γHV 68 RCA protein, but not passive transfer of antibody specific for the v-cyclin protein or the latent protein M 2, decreased both the frequency of cells reactivating ex vivo from latency and the frequency of cells carrying the latent viral genome. Therefore, antibody specific for lytic cycle viral antigens can play an important role in the control of gammaherpesvirus latency in immunocompromised hosts. Based on these findings, we propose a model in which ongoing productive replication is essential for maintaining high levels of latently infected cells in immunocompromised hosts.

40|$|Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) readily infects and reinfects during infancy and {{throughout}} life, despite maternal antibodies and immunity from prior infection {{and without the}} need for significant antigenic change. RSV has two neutralization antigens, the F and G virion glycoproteins. G is expressed in both membrane-bound (mG) and secreted (sG) forms. We investigated whether sG might act as a decoy for neutralizing antibodies by comparing the in vitro neutralization of wild-type (wt) RSV versus recombinant mG RSV expressing only mG. wt RSV indeed was less susceptible than mG RSV to monovalent G-specific and polyvalent RSV-specific antibodies, whereas susceptibility to F-specific antibodies was equivalent. This difference disappeared when the virus preparations were purified to remove sG. Thus, sG appears to function as a neutralization decoy. We evaluated this effect in vivo in mice by comparing the effects of <b>passively</b> <b>transferred</b> <b>antibodies</b> on the pulmonary replication of wt RSV versus mG RSV. Again, wt RSV was less sensitive than mG RSV to G-specific and RSV-specific antibodies; however, a similar difference was also observed with F-specific antibodies. This confirmed that sG helps wt RSV evade the antibody-dependent restriction of replication but indicated that in mice, it is not acting primarily as a decoy for G-specific antibodies, perhaps because sG is produced in insufficient quantities in this poorly permissive animal. Rather, we found that the greater sensitivity of mG versus wt RSV to the antiviral effect of <b>passively</b> <b>transferred</b> RSV <b>antibodies</b> required the presence of inflammatory cells in the lung and was Fcγ receptor dependent.

40|$|Simian-human {{immunodeficiency}} virus (SHIV) models for human {{immunodeficiency virus}} (HIV) infection {{have been widely used}} in passive studies with HIV neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) to test for protection against infection. However, because SHIV-infected adult macaques often rapidly control plasma viremia and any resulting pathogenesis is minor, the model has been unsuitable for studying the impact of antibodies on pathogenesis in infected animals. We found that SHIVSF 162 P 3 infection in 1 -month-old rhesus macaques not only results in high persistent plasma viremia but also leads to very rapid disease progression within 12 to 16 weeks. In this model, passive transfer of high doses of neutralizing IgG (SHIVIG) prevents infection. Here, we show that at lower doses, SHIVIG reduces both plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) -associated viremia and mitigates pathogenesis in infected animals. Moreover, production of endogenous NAbs correlated with lower set-point viremia and 100 % survival of infected animals. New SHIV models are needed to investigate whether <b>passively</b> <b>transferred</b> <b>antibodies</b> or antibodies elicited by vaccination that fall short of providing sterilizing immunity impact disease progression or influence immune responses. The 1 -month-old rhesus macaque SHIV model of infection provides a new tool to investigate the effects of antibodies on viral replication and clearance, mechanisms of B cell maintenance, and the induction of adaptive immunity in disease progression...|$|R
40|$|<b>Passively</b> <b>transferred</b> {{neutralizing}} <b>antibodies</b> {{can block}} lentivirus infection, but {{their role in}} postexposure prophylaxis is poorly understood. In this nonhuman-primate study, the effects of short-term antibody therapy on 5 -year disease progression, virus load, and host immunity were explored. We reported previously that postinfection passive treatment with polyclonal immune globulin with high neutralizing titers against SIVsmE 660 (SIVIG) significantly improved the 67 -week health of SIVsmE 660 -infected Macaca mulatta macaques. Four of six treated macaques maintained low or undetectable levels of virus in plasma, compared with one of ten controls, while two rapid progressors controlled viremia {{only as long as}} the SIVIG was present. SIVIG treatment delayed the de novo production of envelope (Env) -specific antibodies by 8 weeks (13). We show here that differences in disease progression were also significant at 5 years postinfection, excluding rapid progressors (P = 0. 05). Macaques that maintained ≤ 103 virus particles per ml of plasma and ≤ 30 infectious virus particles per 106 mononuclear cells from peripheral blood and lymph nodes had delayed disease onset. All macaques that survived beyond 18 months had measurable Gag-specific CD 8 + cytotoxic T cells, regardless of treatment. Humoral immunity in survivors beyond 20 weeks was strikingly different in the SIVIG and control groups. Despite a delay in Env-specific binding antibodies, de novo production of neutralizing antibodies was significantly accelerated in SIVIG-treated macaques. Titers of de novo neutralizing antibodies at week 12 were comparable to levels achieved in controls only by week 32 or later. Acceleration of de novo simian immunodeficiency virus immunity in the presence of <b>passively</b> <b>transferred</b> neutralizing <b>antibodies</b> is a novel finding with implications for postexposure prophylaxis and vaccines...|$|R
40|$|Immunization {{of mammals}} with {{purified}} acetylcholine receptor protein (AChR) 1 {{results in an}} autoimmune response to skeletal muscle AChR which impairs neuromuscular transmission, causing experimental autoimmune myasthenia gravis (EAMG). In {{the introduction to the}} accompanying article (1) the striking similarities between EAMG and the human disease myasthenia gravis (MG) were reviewed. In that article we showed that immunization of rats with purified syngeneic AChR protein or AChR from fish electric organs induced an autoimmune response to muscle AChR. Antibodies to AChR were found both free in serum and bound to muscle AChR. Also, a large decrease in AChR content was noted. In this paper we investigate the role of antibodies to AChR in the impairment of neuromuscular transmission in EAMG by <b>passively</b> <b>transferring</b> <b>antibody</b> from rats with EAMG to normal rats. Passive transfer experiments are intended to clarify the relative contribution of cell-mediated and humoral immunity to causing the changes in AChR function, AChR content, and postsynaptic membrane structure which are responsible for impairment of neuromuscular transmission. Previous experiments suggest that passive transfer of EAMG with antibody should be possible. Antisera from animals with EAMG block AChR activity on muscle (2, 3) and electric organ cells (4 - 6) in vitro. Chronic administration to mice of large amounts of immunoglobulin from patients with MG resulted in decreased miniature endplate potential amplitude and diminished toxin binding to end-plates (7). High titers of antibody to AChR have been found in the serum of babies suffering fro...|$|R

40|$|The mechanism(s) {{by which}} Sin Nombre (SN) {{hantavirus}} is maintained in deer mouse populations is unclear. Field {{studies indicate that}} transmission occurs primarily if not exclusively via a horizontal mechanism. Using an experimental deer mouse infection model in an outdoor laboratory, we tested whether infected rodents shed SN virus in urine, feces, and saliva, whether infected mice transmit infection to naïve cage mates, and whether infected dams are able to vertically transmit virus or antibody to offspring. Using pooled samples of urine, feces, and saliva collected from mice infected 8 to 120 days postinoculation (p. i.), we found that a subset of saliva samples, collected between 15 and 90 days p. i., contained viral RNA. Parallel studies conducted on wild-caught, naturally infected deer mice showed a similar pattern of intermittent positivity, also only in saliva samples. Attempts to isolate virus through inoculation of cells or naïve deer mice with the secreta or excreta of infected mice were uniformly negative. Of 54 attempts to transmit infection by cohousing infected deer mice with seronegative cage mates, we observed only a single case of transmission, which occurred between 29 and 42 days p. i. Dams <b>passively</b> <b>transferred</b> <b>antibodies</b> to neonatal pups via milk, and those antibodies persisted for at least 2 months after weaning, but none transmitted infection to their pups. Compared to other hantavirus models, SN virus is shed less efficiently and transmits inefficiently among cage mates.

40|$|We have {{conjugated}} {{cholera toxin}} (CT) B subunit (CTB) to dextran {{and studied the}} effect in mice of previous immunization with CT and CTB on the response to dextran after intranasal immunizations with conjugate. Preexisting immunity to CTB was found to inhibit both the lung mucosal response and serum antibody response to dextran, but this effect could be overcome by using a higher dose of conjugate and delaying the conjugate immunization until the CTB antibody titers had declined. The role of anti-CTB antibodies on the mucosal surface was probably to prevent uptake of the conjugate through a mechanism of immune exclusion. <b>Passively</b> <b>transferred</b> serum <b>antibodies</b> against CTB, on the other hand, suppressed both the serum response and the local antibody response against CTB but {{did not affect the}} response to dextran after intranasal immunization with conjugate...|$|R
