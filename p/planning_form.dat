40|$|Task-based {{language}} teaching (TBLT) {{has been a}} dominant approach {{in the field of}} ELT for some time now. However, it has complexities regarding its use in a foreign language context. It is said that focusing only on interaction may not be enough in guiding learners to use language correctly, so learners need exposure to grammar rules, and teachers presume that TBLT does not allow it. But, learners ’ attention could be directed to the grammar forms during task planning to facilitate noticing of linguistic code. To this end, this small-scale study collects discourse data from an adult EFL learner to evaluate whether guiding learners ’ attention to grammar during pre-task planning is of any help.

40|$|Recently, {{there have}} been various {{developments}} within Dutch substantive criminal-law doctrine that in some important ways suggest a shift towards a common-law conception of judicial interpretation in different topics which are central to substantive criminal law. The developments suggest that criminal-law doctrine in the Netherlands is becoming sketchier and is losing some theoretical profundity. Building on Cassirer's philosophy of symbolic forms, Shapiro's planning theory of law, and Wittgenstein's considerations on rule-following, this article aims {{to contribute to a}} description of the independent function of doctrine in substantive criminal law, by addressing the question as to how, and in what sense, doctrine 'helps' the court in applying the statutory and non-statutory criminal-law norms. It is argued that the law constitutes a 'symbolic form' that is to some extent disassociated from the social life-world, and that is construed by way of sophisticated, shared forms of 'social planning'. These forms of social <b>planning</b> <b>form</b> parts of a 'practice' governed by a specific 'legal point of view'. It is further argued that criminal-law doctrine, in a radical sense, comprises a form of proceduralization, by means of which the adjudicating judge is 'directed' to a certain position within the criminal law's symbolically construed space. It is concluded that criminal-law doctrine fulfils an important function in 'situating' the judge, and in 'prompting' or 'compelling' the judge, from his subjective position, to apply a criminal-law norm in an objectively correct manner...|$|E

40|$|Planning {{structure}} of cities {{plays an important}} role in shaping their sustainable development while elaborating urban planning documentation (master plans and detailed plan projects). The existing studies of small towns in Iran reveal issues of architectural heritage and do not touch upon such peculiar features of small town planning as shape of their plan, network of streets, their configuration. It has not been established how a planning {{structure of}} a small city influences on its sustainable development. An inspection of 16 small towns of Iran has shown that the majority of the cities have a compact <b>planning</b> <b>form</b> which is due to flat relief, as well as the need for efficient use of valuable agricultural land. At the same time the paper demonstrates that territory development for building construction within city boundaries has unequal character. It has been determined that cities have very few green areas. Undeveloped wastelands owned by private individuals are often located close to densely developed areas. Such situation is due to specific features of the Iranian legislation that does not specify time terms for territory development. Parameters of urban road-street networks (width in red lines, presence of such transverse profile elements as landscaping along roadways) do not correspond to the existing recommendations in Iran. Mixed or free system of streets is considered as the most common one and it is due to changes in urban conditions during the long process of development. Frequent network of narrow streets forms a system of small blocks of various shapes and needs to be improved. The majority of the inspected cities do not have bypass roads for freight transport, and there is also a transit transport through their historic centers. </p...|$|E
