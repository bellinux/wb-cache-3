5|$|With the {{entrance}} of the United States into World War II, Wendover Field took on greater importance. It was the Army Air Force's largest bombing and gunnery range. On March 1942 the Army Air Force activated Wendover Army Air Field and also assigned the research and development of guided missiles, <b>pilotless</b> <b>aircraft,</b> and remotely controlled bombs to the site. The new base was supplied and serviced by the Ogden Air Depot at Hill Field. In April 1942, the Wendover Sub-Depot was activated and assumed technical and administrative control of the field, under the Ogden Air Depot. The Wendover Sub-Depot was tasked to requisition, store, and issue all Army Air Forces property for organizations stationed at Wendover Field for training.|$|E
25|$|In 1945, NASA's {{predecessor}} agency, the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA), {{established a}} rocket launch site on Wallops Island {{under the direction}} of the Langley Research Center. This site was designated the <b>Pilotless</b> <b>Aircraft</b> Research Station and conducted high-speed aerodynamic research to supplement wind tunnel and laboratory investigations into the problems of flight. In 1958, Congress established NASA, which absorbed Langley Research Center and other NACA field centers and research facilities. At that time, the <b>Pilotless</b> <b>Aircraft</b> Research Station became a separate facility - Wallops Station - operating directly under NASA Headquarters in Washington, D.C.|$|E
25|$|In 1946, Boeing {{started to}} study surface-to-air guided {{missiles}} under the United States Army Air Forces project MX-606. By 1950, Boeing had launched more than 100 test rockets in various configurations, {{all under the}} designator XSAM-A-1 GAPA (Ground-to-Air <b>Pilotless</b> <b>Aircraft).</b> Because these tests were very promising, Boeing received a USAF contract in 1949 to develop a pilotless interceptor (a term then used by the USAF for air-defense guided missiles) under project MX-1599. The MX-1599 missile {{was to be a}} ramjet-powered, nuclear-armed long-range surface-to-air missile to defend the Continental United States from high-flying bombers. The Michigan Aerospace Research Center (MARC) was added to the project soon afterward, and this gave the new missile its name Bomarc (for Boeing and MARC). In 1951, the USAF decided to emphasize its point of view that missiles were nothing else than <b>pilotless</b> <b>aircraft</b> by assigning aircraft designators to its missile projects, and anti-aircraft missiles received F-for-Fighter designations. The Bomarc became the F-99.|$|E

25|$|Official {{requirements}} {{were published}} in 1945; Bell Laboratories won the Ordnance contract for a short-range line-of-sight weapon under Project Nike, while a team of players led by Boeing won the contract for a long-range design known as Ground-to-Air <b>Pilotless</b> <b>Aircraft,</b> or GAPA. GAPA moved to the US Air Force when that branch was formed in 1948. In 1946 the USAAF also started two early research projects into anti-missile systems in Project Thumper and Project Wizard.|$|E
25|$|In November 1945, he {{returned}} to the United States to serve as an instructor in the Aviation Section, Marine Corps Schools, Quantico. From October 1946 until December 1949, he was assigned to the Bureau of Aeronautics, Navy Department, in Washington, D.C.. He served in the Guided Missiles (then <b>Pilotless</b> <b>Aircraft)</b> Division of the Design and Engineering Group, and was Branch Chief at various times of the Liaison, Experimental Projects, and Target Drone branches. He also performed additional duty in 1947 as Senior Marine Corps Aide to the White House.|$|E
25|$|After the war, Eglin {{became a}} pioneer in {{developing}} the techniques for missile launching and handling; {{and the development of}} drone or <b>pilotless</b> <b>aircraft</b> beginning with the Republic-Ford JB-2 Loon, an American copy of the V-1. The 1st Experimental Guided Missiles Group was activated at Eglin Field, Florida, on 6 February 1946, operating out of Auxiliary Field 3. By March 1950, the 550th Guided Missiles Wing, comprising the 1st and 2nd Guided Missile Squadrons, had replaced the 1st Experimental Guided Missiles Group. The 2nd Guided Missile Squadron, SSM, had 62 pilots manning 14 B-17s, three B-29s, and four F-80 Shooting Stars, yellow-tailed drone aircraft used in the role of testing guided missiles.|$|E

50|$|The Airspeed AS.30 Queen Wasp was a British <b>pilotless</b> target <b>aircraft</b> {{built by}} Airspeed Limited at Portsmouth during the Second World War. Although {{intended}} for both Royal Air Force and Royal Navy use, the aircraft was fated {{not to go}} into series production.|$|R
25|$|After the war, Eglin {{became a}} pioneer in {{developing}} the techniques for missile launching and handling; {{and the development of}} drone or <b>pilotless</b> <b>aircraft</b> beginning with the Republic-Ford JB-2 Loon, an American copy of the V-1. The 1st Experimental Guided Missiles Group was activated at Eglin Field, Florida, on 6 February 1946, operating out of Auxiliary Field 3. Pursuant to an order from the War Department, dated 25 January 1946, the Commanding General of the Army Air Forces Center at Eglin Field was directed to activate the Headquarters, 1st Experimental Guided Missiles Group, the 1st Experimental Guided Missiles Squadron and the 1st Experimental Air Service Squadron. The total authorized strength for the three organizations was 130 officers, one warrant officer and 714 enlisted men. Eglin's commander was directed to supply manpower for the units from his own resources, but, given the recent postwar demobilization, his ability to do so was extremely limited. Operations were conducted out of Auxiliary Field 3 (Duke Field). On 13 January 1947, a successful drone flight from Eglin to Washington, D.C. was conducted utilizing a QB-17 Flying Fortress. A QB-17G, 44-85648, was utilized in a ditching test program at Eglin in 1948 when it was landed in the water by radio control. Ironically, although nine of the approximately 43 surviving intact B-17s in the world were assigned to the 3200th and 3205th Drone Groups at Eglin, the example displayed at the Air Force Armament Museum is not one of them, having been a former U.S. Navy PB-1W patrol model.|$|E
500|$|Wendover {{played a}} key role in the postwar weapons {{development}} industry with three areas being developed. The first was further testing of the JB-2 Loon flying bomb. [...] In the case of the second area, the B-17 Flying Fortress, obsolete as a combat aircraft, was being tested to fly remotely. [...] Gliding bombs, based on captured technology from the wartime Henschel Hs 293 German radio-controlled glide bomb were being developed that could be controlled by radar or radio. The third consisted of bombs that could be controlled by the launching plane. [...] The historic GAPA (ground to air <b>pilotless</b> <b>aircraft)</b> Boeing project resulted in the first supersonic flight of an American Air Force vehicle on 6 August 1946. In March 1947, the Air Proving Ground Command research programs were moved to Alamogordo Army Airfield, New Mexico. [...] As a result, 1,200 personnel from Wendover Field were moved to New Mexico from Utah and were relocated to Alamogordo to conduct guided missile research projects. Three ongoing projects were transferred: Ground-to-Air <b>Pilotless</b> <b>Aircraft</b> (GAPA), JB-2 Loon flight testing, and ASM-A-1 Tarzon gliding bomb.|$|E
500|$|The <b>pilotless</b> <b>aircraft</b> {{initially}} continued north, {{then turned}} left through 180° and crashed onto sea ice in North Star Bay {{at a relatively}} shallow angle of 20degrees—about [...] west of Thule Air Base—at 15:39EST. The conventional high explosive (HE) components of four 1.1megaton B28FI model hydrogen bombs detonated on impact, spreading radioactive material over a large area {{in a manner similar}} to a dirty bomb. [...] "Weak links" [...] in the weapon design ensured that a nuclear explosion was not triggered. The extreme heat generated by the burning of [...] of jet fuel during the five to six hours after the crash melted the ice sheet, causing wreckage and munitions to sink to the ocean floor.|$|E

500|$|A July 1945 Tizard Committee report foresaw {{the advent}} of {{long-range}} rockets and <b>pilotless</b> <b>aircraft,</b> but did not envision them as likely within ten years, and therefore urged the development of long-range jet bombers. In 1946, the RAF's front line bomber was the Avro Lincoln, a development of the wartime Avro Lancaster. It {{did not have the}} range to reach targets in the Soviet Union, nor could it deal with jet fighter interceptors. Operational Requirement (OR229) called for a high-altitude jet bomber with a range of [...] carrying an atomic bomb. The 9 August 1946 requirement for an atomic bomb (OR1001) specified that it be not more than [...] in length or [...] in diameter, and weigh no more than [...]|$|E
500|$|The {{concrete}} gun emplacements {{were called}} Summit Battery, Laboratory Battery, Garden Battery and Tombstone Battery. Along with the barracks {{they have been}} designated as GradeII listed buildings. The facilities installed included a master-gunners house, a small inn, and a water tank holding [...] of rainwater. The water tank is beneath the barracks and collects rainwater from its roof. The brick tank is [...] long, [...] wide and [...] high with a vaulted roof. Armaments included ten 7-inch rifled muzzle loaders MkIII spread between six batteries. These were later replaced with Armstrong 6-inch RML guns. Some of the gun batteries are scheduled monuments, {{and there are the}} remains of a centralised group of brick-built barrack blocks. In 1898 test firing by HMS Arrogant, an Arrogant-class cruiser, on Rudder Rock battery showed that the fixed gun emplacements used on Steep Holm and other sites were susceptible to attack by modern warships, and the site was no longer active. The military control on the island was maintained until 1908 when it was leased to James Sleeman and his family. In 1927 the first test of the RAE Larynx (from [...] "Long Range Gun with Lynx engine") an early <b>pilotless</b> <b>aircraft,</b> {{to be used as a}} guided anti-ship weapon, took place just off Steep Holm.|$|E
