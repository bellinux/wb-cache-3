5|$|Like {{some other}} psychoactive {{grassland}} {{species such as}} <b>Psilocybe</b> semilanceata, Conocybe cyanopus, P.tampanensis can form sclerotia–a hardened mass of mycelia that is more resistant to adverse environmental conditions than normal mycelia. This truffle-like form gives the fungus some protection from wildfires and other natural disasters. Other <b>Psilocybe</b> species known to produce sclerotia include <b>Psilocybe</b> mexicana and <b>Psilocybe</b> caerulescens. Sclerotia are also produced when the species is grown in culture.|$|E
5|$|<b>Psilocybe</b> {{authority}} Gastón Guzmán, in his 1983 monograph on psilocybin mushrooms, considered <b>Psilocybe</b> semilanceata the world's most widespread psilocybin mushroom species, as it {{has been}} reported on 17 countries.|$|E
5|$|Guzmán {{considers}} <b>Psilocybe</b> tampanensis to be intermediate in form between P.mexicana and P.caerulescens. <b>Psilocybe</b> mexicana {{has a more}} Mycena-like {{fruit body}} shape, and longer basidia measuring 22–24 by 7.7–11μm. It is known only from Mexico and Guatemala. <b>Psilocybe</b> caerulescens, found in the USA and Venezuela, is also somewhat similar, but has a collybioid habit (small to medium-sized mushrooms with a convex cap), with spores measuring 6.7–8 by 5.2–6.5 by 3.3–5.2μm, and cheilocystidia that are 15–22 by 4.4–5.5μm.|$|E
5|$|For {{almost two}} decades after its discovery, <b>Psilocybe</b> tampanensis was known only from the type locality, {{southeast}} of Brandon, Florida. In 1996, Guzmán reported finding it in a meadow with sandy soil in a deciduous forest in Pearl River County, Mississippi, a habitat {{similar to that of}} the type location. Due to its scarcity, however, its habitat preferences are not known with certainty. Like all <b>Psilocybe</b> species, it is saprobic.|$|E
5|$|<b>Psilocybe</b> aztecorum is {{the type}} species of Guzmán's section Aztecorum, a group of bluing (i.e., psilocybin-containing) <b>Psilocybe</b> {{mushrooms}} characterized by having a strongly hygrophanous cap that dries to brown or brownish white when dry; spores that appear asymmetrical when seen in side view; and pleurocystidia that, when present, are hyaline (translucent). Other species classified in section Aztecorum are P.baeocystis and P.quebecensis.|$|E
5|$|The {{species was}} first {{described}} scientifically by French mycologist Roger Heim in 1958. It {{was one of}} several species described and illustrated in the popular American weekly magazine Life ("Seeking the Magic Mushroom"), in which R. Gordon Wasson recounted the psychedelic visions that he experienced during the divinatory rituals of the Mixtec people, thereby introducing psilocybin mushrooms to Western popular culture; it was however, mislabeled as <b>Psilocybe</b> zaptecorum. Similarly, <b>Psilocybe</b> specialist Gastón Guzmán suggests that P.zapotecorum, as described by Rolf Singer in 1958, is misidentified as it agrees well with the type of P.hoogshagenii. The species <b>Psilocybe</b> caerulipes var. gastonii, described by Singer in 1958, is a synonym of P.hoogshagenii.|$|E
5|$|<b>Psilocybe</b> allenii was {{described}} as new to science in 2012 by Jan Borovička, Alan Rockefeller, and Peter G. Werner. Borovička received material collected from Seattle, Washington, which he noted was microscopically similar to <b>Psilocybe</b> cyanescens, but lacked the wavy cap margins characteristic of that species. In previous publications, Borovička had noted that both macro- and microscopic characters of certain <b>Psilocybe</b> species were highly variable, which could also account for the differences observed in the Seattle material. However, DNA sequencing revealed a 5-base pair change in the internal transcribed spacer regions (a segment of RNA often used in molecular phylogenetics to identify or distinguish fungal species) between P.cyanescens and the Seattle collections. This difference, {{in addition to the}} readily observable macroscopic differences, was deemed sufficient to warrant describing the taxon as a new species. Additional molecular studies published by Borovička and colleagues in 2015 identified P.azurescens, P.cyanescens, P.weraroa, P.cubensis, and P.serbica as closely related to P.allenii.|$|E
5|$|The {{species was}} {{described}} as new to science by American mycologists Rolf Singer and Alexander H. Smith, based on specimens collected in Nor Yungas Province, Bolivia, {{on the road to}} La Paz to Coroico. They published a short description in Latin in a 1958 Mycologia publication, followed by a more detailed description in English later that year. According to <b>Psilocybe</b> specialist Gastón Guzmán, the species <b>Psilocybe</b> acutissima (described by Roger Heim in 1958), and <b>Psilocybe</b> isauri (described by Singer in 1959) are synonyms, as both the macroscopic and microscopic features are the same in the type material of all three. Singer considered P.isauri a species distinct from P.yungensis because of differences in the hairiness of the stem surface. Smith named the variety P.yungensis var. diconica for specimens he found with conical, rather than obconical (the form of an inverted cone) papilla. Similarly, the main distinguishing feature that Heim ascribed to P.acutissima was a papillate cap (somewhat resembling the shape of a female human breast). Later studies showed that these morphological variations did not warrant individual recognition, because of the variable nature of these characteristics, and the existence of intermediate forms.|$|E
5|$|The {{species was}} first {{mentioned}} in the literature in 1981, when Pierre Margot and Roy Watling described a specimen collected in 1969 by Grace Marie Taylor near the Franz Josef Glacier as an unnamed <b>Psilocybe</b> with affinities to the North American species <b>Psilocybe</b> caerulipes. It was officially described as new to science in 1995 by mycologists Peter R. Johnston and Peter K. Buchanan. In his 1996 book Psilocybin Mushrooms of the World, Paul Stamets noted that the two authors are known to work with law-enforcement officials to assist in prosecuting those who illegally collect psychoactive mushrooms.|$|E
5|$|P. semilanceata, {{like all}} others {{species of the}} genus <b>Psilocybe,</b> is a {{saprobic}} fungus, meaning it obtains nutrients by breaking down organic matter. The mushroom is also associated with sedges in moist areas of fields, and it is thought {{to live on the}} decaying root remains.|$|E
5|$|<b>Psilocybe</b> semilanceata fruits solitarily or {{in groups}} on rich and acidic soil, {{typically}} in grasslands, such as meadows, pastures, or lawns. It is {{often found in}} pastures that have been fertilized with sheep or cow dung, although it does not typically grow directly on the dung.|$|E
5|$|The {{species was}} first {{described}} by Elias Magnus Fries as Agaricus semilanceatus in his 1838 Epicrisis Systematis Mycologici. Paul Kummer transferred it to <b>Psilocybe</b> in 1871 when he raised many of Fries's sub-groupings of Agaricus {{to the level}} of genus. Panaeolus semilanceatus, named by Jakob Emanuel Lange in both 1936 and 1939 publications, is a synonym. According to the taxonomical database MycoBank, several taxa once considered varieties of P.semilanceata are synonymous with the species now known as <b>Psilocybe</b> strictipes: the caerulescens variety described by Pier Andrea Saccardo in 1887 (originally named Agaricus semilanceatus var. coerulescens by Mordecai Cubitt Cooke in 1881), the microspora variety described by Rolf Singer in 1969, and the obtusata variety described by Marcel Bon in 1985.|$|E
5|$|Guzmán places P.yungensis in {{the section}} Cordisporae, a {{grouping}} of <b>Psilocybe</b> species characterized primarily by having rhomboid spores less than 8micrometers long. The specific epithet yungensis refers to {{the name of the}} type locality. The natives of Huautla de Jiménez and Mixe natives call P.yungensis a hongo adivinador ("divinatory mushroom"), hong que adormece ("soporific mushroom"), or hongo genio ("genius mushroom").|$|E
5|$|<b>Psilocybe</b> pelliculosa {{is found}} in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States and Canada, where it grows on the ground in groups or {{clusters}} along trails or forest roads in coniferous woods. A single collection has also been reported from Finland. The mushrooms contain the psychedelic compounds psilocybin and baeocystin, although at relatively low concentrations. Several mushroom species that are similar in appearance to P.pelliculosa can be distinguished by subtle differences {{in the form of the}} fruit body, or by microscopic characteristics.|$|E
5|$|<b>Psilocybe</b> semilanceata {{is roughly}} similar in {{appearance}} to P.hispanica, but may distinguished by its mycenoid (Mycena-like) appearance and acute umbonate cap. Although the grassland habitat {{of the two}} species is similar, P.semilanceata does not grow directly on dung; rather, it is a saprobic species that grows on decaying grass roots. P.fimetaria also resembles P.hispanica, {{but it also has}} a mycenoid appearance and has a ring on the stem. In terms of microscopic characteristics, P.fimetaria has larger cheilocystidia that measure 20–32 by 4–8μm. P.hispanica differs from P.liniformans var. liniformans in that it lacks a gelatinous gill edge. P. liniformans var. americana has larger cheilocystidia, measuring 22–33 by 5.5–9μm, and it is known to grow only on soil around herbs, in the Northwest and Northeast USA and Chile. Deconica coprophila (formerly known as <b>Psilocybe</b> coprophila) is a small brownish mushroom that also grows on dung, but it does not contain psilocybin and does not have a bluing stem.|$|E
5|$|Psilocybin {{is present}} in varying {{concentrations}} in over 200 species of Basidiomycota mushrooms which evolved to produce the compound from muscarine some 20 million years ago. In a 2000 review on the worldwide distribution of hallucinogenic mushrooms, Gastón Guzmán and colleagues considered these to be distributed amongst the following genera: <b>Psilocybe</b> (116species), Gymnopilus (14), Panaeolus (13), Copelandia (12), Hypholoma (6), Pluteus (6), Inocybe (6), Conocybe (4), Panaeolina (4), Gerronema (2) and Agrocybe, Galerina and Mycena (1species each). Guzmán increased his estimate {{of the number of}} psilocybin-containing <b>Psilocybe</b> to 144 species in a 2005 review. The majority of these are found in Mexico (53 species), with the remainder distributed in the US and Canada (22), Europe (16), Asia (15), Africa (4), and Australia and associated islands (19). In general, psilocybin-containing species are dark-spored, gilled mushrooms that grow in meadows and woods of the subtropics and tropics, usually in soils rich in humus and plant debris. Psilocybin mushrooms occur on all continents, but the majority of species are found in subtropical humid forests. <b>Psilocybe</b> species commonly found in the tropics include P.cubensis and P.subcubensis. P.semilanceata — considered by Guzmán to be the world's most widely distributed psilocybin mushroom — is found in Europe, North America, Asia, South America, Australia and New Zealand, but is entirely absent from Mexico. Although {{the presence or absence of}} psilocybin is not of much use as a chemotaxonomical marker at the familial level or higher, it is used to classify taxa of lower taxonomic groups.|$|E
5|$|The {{most potent}} {{are members of}} the genus <b>Psilocybe,</b> such as P.azurescens, P.semilanceata, and P.cyanescens, but {{psilocybin}} has also been isolated from about a dozen other genera. As a prodrug, psilocybin is quickly converted by the body to psilocin, which has mind-altering effects similar, in some aspects, to those of LSD, mescaline, and DMT. In general, the effects include euphoria, visual and mental hallucinations, changes in perception, a distorted sense of time, and spiritual experiences, and can include possible adverse reactions such as nausea and panic attacks.|$|E
5|$|The {{wide range}} of psychoactive effects can be {{variously}} described as depressant, sedative-hypnotic, psychedelic, dissociative, and deliriant; paradoxical effects such as stimulation may occur however. Perceptual phenomena such as synesthesia, macropsia, and micropsia may occur. Some users report lucid dreaming {{under the influence of}} its hypnotic effects. Unlike <b>Psilocybe</b> cubensis, A.muscaria cannot be commercially cultivated, due to its mycorrhizal relationship with the roots of pine trees. However, following the outlawing of psilocybin mushrooms in the United Kingdom in 2006, the sale of the still legal A.muscaria began increasing.|$|E
5|$|There is {{evidence}} to suggest that psychoactive mushrooms have been used by humans in religious ceremonies for thousands of years. Murals dated 9000 to 7000BCE found in the Sahara desert in southeast Algeria depict horned beings dressed as dancers, clothed in garb decorated with geometrical designs, and holding mushroom-like objects. Parallel lines extend from the mushroom shapes {{to the center of the}} dancers' heads. 6,000-year-old pictographs discovered near the Spanish town of Villar del Humo illustrate several mushrooms that have been tentatively identified as <b>Psilocybe</b> hispanica, a hallucinogenic species native to the area.|$|E
5|$|Laboratory {{tests have}} shown P.semilanceata to {{suppress}} {{the growth of the}} soil-borne water mold Phytophthora cinnamomi, a virulent plant pathogen that causes the disease root rot. When grown in dual culture with other saprobic fungi isolated from the rhizosphere of grasses from its habitat, P.semilanceata significantly suppresses their growth. This antifungal activity, which can be traced at least partly to two phenolic compounds it secretes, helps it compete successfully with other fungal species in the intense competition for nutrients provided by decaying plant matter. Using standard antimicrobial susceptibility tests, <b>Psilocybe</b> semilanceata was shown to strongly inhibit the growth of the human pathogen methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The source of the antimicrobial activity is unknown.|$|E
5|$|Possession {{and use of}} {{psilocybin}} mushrooms, {{including the}} bluing species of <b>Psilocybe,</b> is therefore prohibited by extension. However, in many national, state, and provincial drug laws, {{there has been a}} great deal of ambiguity about the legal status of psilocybin mushrooms, as well as a strong element of selective enforcement in some places. Most US state courts have considered the mushroom a 'container' of the illicit drugs, and therefore illegal. A loophole further complicates the legal situation—the spores of psilocybin mushrooms do not contain the drugs, and are legal to possess in many areas. Jurisdictions that have specifically enacted or amended laws to criminalize the possession of psilocybin mushroom spores include Germany (since 1998), and California, Georgia, and Idaho in the United States. As a consequence, there is an active underground economy involved in the sale of spores and cultivation materials, and an internet-based social network to support the illicit activity.|$|E
5|$|Several <b>Psilocybe</b> {{species have}} an {{appearance}} roughly similar to P.allenii, but these {{can usually be}} distinguished by differences in morphology or distribution. The European species P.serbica var. moravica has a similar cap and stipe, but is generally more slender than P.allenii. The closely related P.cyanescens is indistinguishable by microscopic characteristics, but features a wavy cap in maturity, a longer fruiting season (from late September through April), and lacks a ring zone on the stipe often seen in P.allenii. P.azurescens has a broader cap, an umbo that may be broad or acute, a longer stipe up to , and a growing season {{similar to that of}} P.cyanescens. The authors also note that the Australian P.subaeruginosa is similar (including three taxa that have since been synonymized: P.australiana, P.eucalypta, and P.tasmaniana) but suggest that further research is required to better understand the delimitation of this species complex.|$|E
5|$|Stropharia caerulea {{was first}} {{mentioned}} in the scientific literature by James Bolton in 1788, under the name Agaricus politus. This usage is not considered valid according to nomenclatural rules, because it was used by Christian Hendrik Persoon to refer to another species in his 1801 Synopsis methodica fungorum, which is a sanctioned work. Stropharia caerulea was officially described by mycologist Hanns Kreisel in 1979 from collections made near Woldegk, Germany. Machiel Noordeloos transferred the species to <b>Psilocybe</b> in 1995, but today this genus is mostly reserved for species that contain the psychoactive compounds psilocybin and psilocin. Although psilocybin had once been reported from S.caerulea, subsequent analyses have not revealed any traces of the substance in the fruit bodies.|$|E
5|$|The genera Moserella (Pöder & Scheuer, 1994) and Chromosera (Redhead, Ammirati & Norvell, 1995) {{were named}} in Moser's honour, {{as were the}} species Acariniola moseri (T. Majewsky & J. Wisn.), Conocybe moseri (Watling), Cortinarius moseri ((E. Horak) E. Horak), Cortinarius moserianus (Bohus), Cortinarius meinhardii (Bon), Entoloma moserianum (Noordel.), Gerronema moseri (Singer), Gymnopus moseri (Antonín & Noordel.), Hebeloma moseri (Singer), Hydropus moserianus (Bas), Hygrocybe moseri (Bon), Lactarius moseri (Harmaja), Lasiosphaeria moseri (O. Hilber), Leucoagaricus moseri (Wasser), Peziza moseri (Aviz.-Hersh. & Nemlich), Phaeocollybia moseri (Band.-Muñoz & Guzmán), Psathyrella moseri (Singer), <b>Psilocybe</b> moseri (Guzmán), Thaxteriola moseri (T. Majewsky & J. Wisn.), Tricholoma moseri (Singer), Tricholoma moserianum (Bon), Tubaria moseri (Raithelh.), and Wardomyces moseri (W. Gams).|$|E
5|$|The {{psilocybin}} {{contents of}} dried herbarium specimens of <b>Psilocybe</b> semilanceata {{in one study}} were shown to decrease with the increasing age of the sample: collections dated 11, 33, or 118 years old contained 0.84%, 0.67%, and 0.014% (all dry weight), respectively. Mature mycelia contain some psilocybin, while young mycelia (recently germinated from spores) lack appreciable amounts. Many species of mushrooms containing psilocybin also contain lesser amounts of the analog compounds baeocystin and norbaeocystin, chemicals thought to be biogenic precursors. Although most species of psilocybin-containing mushrooms bruise blue when handled or damaged due to the oxidization of phenolic compounds, this reaction is not a definitive method of identification or determining a mushroom's potency.|$|E
5|$|The {{toxicity}} of certain Galerina species {{has been known}} for a century. In 1912, Charles Horton Peck reported a human poisoning case due to G.autumnalis. In 1954, a poisoning was caused by G.venenata. Between 1978 and 1995, ten cases caused by amatoxin-containing Galerinas were reported in the literature. Three European cases, two from Finland and one from France were attributed to G.marginata and G.unicolor, respectively. Seven North American exposures included two fatalities from Washington due to G.venenata, with five cases reacting positively to treatment; four poisonings were caused by G.autumnalis from Michigan and Kansas, in addition to poisoning caused by an unidentified Galerina species from Ohio. Several poisonings have been attributed to collectors consuming the mushrooms after mistaking them for the hallucinogenic <b>Psilocybe</b> stuntzii.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, the Swiss {{scientist}} Albert Hofmann—known for {{the synthesis of}} the psychedelic drug LSD—chemically analyzed P.semilanceata fruit bodies collected in Switzerland and France by the botanist Roger Heim. Using the technique of paper chromatography, Hofmann confirmed the presence of 0.25% (by weight) psilocybin in dried samples. Their 1963 publication was the first report of psilocybin in a European mushroom species; previously, it had been known only in <b>Psilocybe</b> species native to Mexico, Asia and North America. This finding was confirmed in the late 1960s with specimens from Scotland and England, Czechoslovakia (1973), Germany (1977), Norway (1978), and Belgium and Finland (1984). In 1965, forensic characterization of psilocybin-containing mushrooms seized from college students in British Columbia identified P.semilanceata—the first recorded case of intentional recreational use of the mushroom in Canada. The presence of the psilocybin analog baeocystin was confirmed in 1977. Several studies published since then {{support the idea that}} the variability of psilocybin content in P.semilanceata is low, regardless of country of origin.|$|E
5|$|Plants {{provide the}} greater part of the food for people and their {{domestic}} animals: much of human culture and civilisation came into being through agriculture. While a large number of plants have been used for food, a small number of staple crops including wheat, rice, and maize provide most of the food in the world today. In turn, animals provide much of the meat eaten by the human population, whether farmed or hunted, and until the arrival of mechanised transport, terrestrial mammals provided {{a large part of the}} power used for work and transport. A variety of living things serve as models in biological research, such as in genetics, and in drug testing. Until the 19th century, plants yielded most of the medicinal drugs in common use, as described in the 1st century by Dioscorides. Plants are the source of many psychoactive drugs, some such as coca known to have been used for thousands of years. Yeast, a fungus, has been used to ferment cereals such as wheat and barley to make bread and beer; other fungi such as <b>Psilocybe</b> and fly agaric mushrooms have been gathered as psychoactive drugs.|$|E
5|$|<b>Psilocybe</b> pseudoaztecorum, {{found in}} India, differs from P.aztecorum in the {{morphology}} of the pleurocystidia and cheilocystidia. The characteristic filamentous neck {{present in the}} cystidia of P.aztecorum is absent in P.pseudoaztecorum. P.pseudoaztecorum had been previously described by K.Natarajan and N.Raman as P.aztecorum, but they published the taxon with a new name after consultation with Guzmán. Fresh specimens of P.aztecorum resemble P.pelliculosa, but this latter species is found only in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States and Canada. Like P.aztecorum, the caps of the South African species P.natalensis also bleach to nearly white when dried. The closely related P.baeocystis also bleaches in color to white when dry. Found in northwest North America from British Columbia to Washington and Oregon, P.baeocystis has thinner cheilocystidia than P.aztecorum (typically measuring 20–32 by 4.4–6μm) and its pleurocystidia, when present, are found only near the gill edge. P.quebecensis, known only from Quebec, Canada, has pleurocystidia measuring 12–25 by 5–10μm. Although the phylogeny of the species comprising section Aztecorum is not known with certainty, Guzmán has suggested that P.aztecorum was the ancestor of P.baeocystis in northwestern North America and of P.quebecensis in northeastern North America.|$|E
5|$|The {{mushroom}} {{also has}} a widespread distribution in North America. In Canada it has been collected from British Columbia, New Brunswick, Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, Ontario and Quebec. In the United States, it is most common in the Pacific Northwest, west of the Cascade Mountains, where it fruits abundantly in autumn and early winter; fruiting has also been reported to occur infrequently during spring months. Charles Horton Peck reported the mushroom to occur in New York in the early 20th century, and consequently, much literature published since then has reported the species {{to be present in}} the eastern United States. Gaston Guzman later examined Peck's herbarium specimen, and in his comprehensive 1983 monograph on <b>Psilocybe,</b> concluded that Peck had misidentified it with the species now known as Panaeolina foenisecii. P.semilanceata is much less common in South America, where it has been recorded in Chile. It is also known in Australia (where it may be an introduced species) and New Zealand, where it grows in high-altitude grasslands. In 2000, it was reported from Golaghat, in the Indian state of Assam.|$|E
25|$|This {{mushroom}} {{has been}} placed in the section Aztecorum by Gaston Guzman; {{other members of the}} section include <b>Psilocybe</b> aztecorum var. aztecorum, <b>Psilocybe</b> aztecorum var. bonetii, <b>Psilocybe</b> pseudoaztecorum, and <b>Psilocybe</b> quebecensis.|$|E
25|$|<b>Psilocybe</b> baeocystis is solitary to , and {{scattered}} to numerous on ground bark, wood chips, peat moss, decaying conifer mulch, occasionally on lawns, pastures, and rarely in coniferous forests. Often found growing under plants like rhododendrons and rose bushes in mulched garden beds, sometimes growing amongst other <b>Psilocybe</b> {{species such as}} <b>Psilocybe</b> stuntzii and <b>Psilocybe</b> cyanescens. <b>Psilocybe</b> baeocystis grows from August through December, and rarely {{as early as the}} end of June. <b>Psilocybe</b> baeocystis is a hemiboreal mushroom, common throughout the Pacific Northwest. It was found in Maine in November 2007 and is reported to have been found in Connecticut also.|$|E
25|$|This {{species is}} closely related to the {{subtropical}} <b>Psilocybe</b> aztecorum and <b>Psilocybe</b> quebecensis, which also have caps that bleach in color to white when dry.|$|E
25|$|Psychoactive {{mushrooms}} are another candidate. Terence McKenna {{speculated that the}} mysteries were focused around a variety of <b>Psilocybe.</b> Other entheogenic fungi, such as Amanita muscaria, have also been suggested. A recent hypothesis suggests that the ancient Egyptians cultivated <b>Psilocybe</b> cubensis on barley and associated it with the deity Osiris.|$|E
25|$|<b>Psilocybe</b> baeocystis is a {{psilocybin}} mushroom of {{the family}} Hymenogastraceae. It contains the hallucinogenic compounds psilocybin, psilocin and baeocystin.|$|E
25|$|On May 1 {{the band}} {{appeared}} on the Metal Marathon 3 Festival in St. Petersburg, with <b>Psilocybe</b> Larvae, Stalwart, Inside You, Melissa, etc.|$|E
