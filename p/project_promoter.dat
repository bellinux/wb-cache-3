40|$|Investments into large, green-field {{infrastructure}} projects under build-operate-transfer arrangements are challenging, and present complex issues for potential <b>project</b> <b>promoters.</b> To demonstrate, during the tendering stage, {{the two main}} concerns for <b>project</b> <b>promoters</b> are ensuring {{a certain level of}} profit margin, and making the financial proposal as attractive as possible to the client. Hence, from the <b>project</b> <b>promoter's</b> point of view, a state of optimality exists between selections of the right combination of key financial factors with appropriate values. Prior research in this area is limited, and has only partially addressed this optimization issue in a fragmented fashion. This paper provides a novel approach by integrating the leading financial elements pertaining to capital budgeting and project financing aspects, which in turn ensures optimum financial viability to promoters. Optimality equations and constraints, based on discounted cash flow analysis are developed, and the non-linear behavior of the objective function is accounted for. Finally, a genetic algorithms-based financial optimization model is developed to reach the near-optimal solution for maximizing the winning potential of the concession agreement under a reasonable profit margin from the equity holder's perspective. The proposed model is demonstrated through a numerical example, which will help improve the financial decision-making processes in an efficient and effective way.

40|$|The {{design of}} {{concession}} period for build-operate-transfer (BOT) projects {{is crucial to}} financial viability and completion risk management. A systematic analysis shows that concession period design involves the design of concession period structure, {{the determination of the}} concession period length and incentive schemes. The concession period may have a single-period structure or a two-period structure, its length may be fixed or variable, and it may be combined with incentive schemes. Different designs reflect different risk control strategies for completion time overruns. The single-period concession structure requires the project company to assume completion risk, while the two-period concession structure could, to some extent, reduce the completion risk exposure to the project company, depending on the incentive schemes. Through Monte Carlo simulation, this paper evaluates the mean net present value (NPV), variance and NPV-at-risk of different concession period structures so that both the government and the concessionaires can understand their risk exposure and rewards. The paper then analyses the influence of project characteristics on concession period design to evaluate the feasibility of the design. It is concluded that a well-designed concession period structure can create a 'win-win' solution for both <b>project</b> <b>promoter</b> and the host government.

The review was conducted in the scope of the international research project entitled ‘Socio-cultural and Psychological Predictors of Work-Life Balance and Gender Equality - Cross-Cultural Comparison of Polish and Norwegian Families’ (October 2013 to April 2017). The project, known under its short name PAR Migration Navigator, is jointly run by the University of Gdansk (<b>Project</b> <b>Promoter),</b> the Institute of Psychology of the Polish Academy of Sciences (IP PAN), the International Research Institute of Stavanger (IRIS), the University of Stavanger (UiS) and the Centre for Intercultural Communication (SIK) in Norway.

40|$|AbstractSuperoxide dismutase (SOD, EC 1. 15. 1. 1) plays a {{key role}} in {{response}} to drought stress, and differences in SOD activity changes among cultivars are important under drought conditions. We obtained the full-length DNA of the chloroplast Cu/Zn-SOD gene (AhCSD 2) from 11 allotetraploid cultivars and 5 diploid wild species in peanut. BLAST search against the peanut genome showed that the AhCSD 2 genes gCSD 2 - 1 and gCSD 2 - 2 are located at the tops of chromosome A 03 (A genome) and B 03 (B genome), respectively, and both contain 8 exons and 7 introns. Nucleotide sequence analyses indicated that gCSD 2 - 2 sequences were identical among all the tested cultivars, while gCSD 2 - 1 sequences showed allelic variations. The amino acid sequences deduced from gCSD 2 - 1 and gCSD 2 - 2 both contain a chloroplast transit peptide and are distinguished by 6 amino acid (aa) residue differences. The other 2 aa residue variations in the mature peptide regions give rise to three-dimensional structure changes of the protein deduced from the genes gCSD 2 - 1 and gCSD 2 - 2. Sequences analyses of cultivars and wild species showed that gCSD 2 - 2 of Arachis hypogaea and gAipCSD 2 (Arachis ipaensis) are identical, and despite the abundant polymorphic loci between gCSD 2 - 1 of A. hypogaea and sequences from A genome wild species, the deduced amino acid sequence of AhCSD 2 - 1 (A. hypogaea) is identical to that of AduCSD 2 (Arachis duranensis), whereas AcoCSD 2 (Arachis correntina) and AcaCSD 2 (Arachis cardenasii) both have 2 aa differences in the transit peptide region compared with AhCSD 2 - 1 (A. hypogaea). Based on the Peanut Genome <b>Project,</b> <b>promoter</b> prediction revealed many stress-related cis-acting elements within the potential promoter regions (pp-A and pp-B). pp-A contains more binding sites for drought-associated transcriptional factors than pp-B.

40|$|Behaviour {{of single}} {{bacterium}} have been mysterious {{for many years}} due to the technical difficulty and nature of bacteria forming communities. It has not been long since engineers and scientists have started to develop various techniques and devices to study and isolate single bacterium. In the present thesis, three subprojects with a common theme of applying single bacterium cells for engineering application or investigating regulation of gene expressions is introduced. Recently, metal structures with micrometer dimensions have been fabricated and successfully utilized to isolate single bacterial cells with dimensions similar to the designed pillars. First project further develops previously discovered feature of single bacterial cell isolation by metal hollow structures to capture polymeric nanoparticles inside the hollow structures. High achievement rates of filling the nanoparticles inside the structures and subsequently capping the top opening of hollow pillars have been attained. The study demonstrates that the shape of structures affects both the capturing rate and capping rate of nanoparticles. In the second project, a fabrication method and result of simple template to obtain well organized array of single bacterial cells is shown. The bacterial cells with size less than micrometer are patterned on a gold substrate in a uniform matter. The technique developed here requires no additional binding agent nor chemical modification of the substrate which provides an advantage in saving the processing time and cost in comparison to existing techniques developed to isolate single bacterial cells. The isolated bacterial cells are further engineered with magnetic nanoparticles to illustrate bacterial cell wall property remaining the constant after deposition. In the last <b>project,</b> <b>promoter</b> activity of single cells has been analyzed to study the population behaviour of the bacterial culture. In contrast to {{the assumption that the}} behaviour of a single bacterium would be identical as a group, the opposite behaviour was found.

During the experiment, two different morphology of cells were observed to exist in a single culture, a short cell and a long elongated cell and the promoter activity correlated with the morphology where the short body ones had higher activity in the promoter compared to the long ones.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we show how {{cost-benefit}} analysis {{can be used}} as a decision support mechanism for the location of new (urban) forest land, starting from the multifunctional role of these new forests. We start with a simple presentation of the cost-benefit analysis (CBA) technique. Key features of this evaluation technique are that (i) all – both positive and negative - impacts for all relevant parties (i. e. not only the <b>project</b> <b>promoter)</b> are taken into account and (ii) evaluation occurs on the basis of monetary values. Next, we give an overview of all relevant costs and benefits of afforestation projects for the whole society. On the cost side, we distinguish costs directly related to the afforestation project itself, such as tree planting and forest management on the one hand and opportunity costs on the other hand. On the benefit side we make a distinction between use and non-use values. Use values include timber production, hunting, recreation and ecosystem values. Non-use and option values capture forest benefits that are independent from the actual use made of the forest area. As valuation of recreation and non-use/option values is not straightforward, we discuss their valuation methods in more detail. For valuing recreation the travel cost method (TCM) is the most widely used technique. TCM seeks how the visit frequency responds to changes in the price of a visit. Non-use values can only be valued using the contingent valuation method (CVM). CVM uses survey questions to elicit people’s preferences for public goods by finding out what they would be willing to pay for specified changes in them. Finally, we apply the CBA to a real life policy problem. The Flemish government has agreed on a 10. 000 ha forest expansion in Flanders, focusing on the multifunction role of forests. In our case study we give an example for the Ghent region (East Flanders). We investigate the net benefits per hectare of combinations of potential forests that meet the surface restriction of 540 ha. We show the importance of including recreation benefits in the evaluation of afforestation projects and more specifically the role of alternative forests (substitutes) in the valuation of one specific forest. We find that this substitution effect is significant in the decision on the location of new forests and leads to a wide variation in the net benefits per hectare of different combinations. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Few {{issues in}} modern finance have {{inspired}} {{the interest of}} both practitioners and theoreticians more than risk evaluation and management. The basic principle governing risk management in an infrastructure project finance deal is intuitive and well-articulated: allocate project-specific risks to parties best able to bear them (taking into account each party's appetite for, and aversion to, risk); control performance risk through incentives; and use market hedging instruments (derivatives) for covering marketwide risks arising from fluctuations in, for instance, interest and exchange rates, among other things. In practice, however, governments {{have been asked to}} provide guarantees for various kinds of projects, often at no charge, because of problems associated with market imperfections: a) Derivative markets (swaps, forwards) for currency and interest-rate risk hedging either do not exist or are inadequately developed in most developing countries. b) Limited contracting possibilities (because of problems with credibility of enforcement). c) Differing methods for risk measurement and evaluation. Two factors distinguish the financing of infrastructure projects from corporate and traditional limited-recourse project finance: 1) a high concentration of project risk early in the project life cycle (pre-completion), and 2) a risk profile that changes as the project comes to fruition, with a relatively stable cash flow subject to market and regulatory risk once the project is completed. The authors introduce INFRISK, a computer-based risk-management approach to infrastructure project transactions that involve the private sector. Developed in-house in the Economic Development Institute of the World Bank, INFRISK is a guide to practitioners in the field and a training tool for raising awareness and improving expertise in the application of modern risk management techniques. INFRISK can analyze a project's exposure to a variety of market, credit, and performance risks form the perspective of key contracting parties (<b>project</b> <b>promoter,</b> creditor, and government). Their model is driven by the concept of the project's economic viability. Drawing on recent developments in the literature on project evaluation under uncertainty, INFRISK generates probability distributions for key decision variables, such as a project's net present value, internal rate of return, or capacity to service its debt on time during the life of the project. Computationally, INFRISK works in conjunction with Microsoft Excel and supports both the construction and the operation phases of a capital investment project. For a particular risk variable of interest (such as the revenue stream, operations and maintenance costs, and construction costs, among others) the program first generates a stream of probability of distributions for each year of a project's life through a Monte Carlo simulation technique. One of the key contributions made by INFRISK is to enable the use of a broader set of probability distributions (uniform, normal, beta, and lognormal) in conducting Monte Carlo simulations rather than relying only on the commonly used normal distribution.
