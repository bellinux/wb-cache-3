The number obtained is compared in the threshold comparators TC 1 and TC 2 with constants.

30|$|The FGM- 3 and FGM- 3 h sensors both produce TTL pulse streams with {{frequencies}} {{ranging from}} the 10 s to 100 s of kHz. We {{have found that the}} 8 -bit “PIC” series of microcontrollers from Microchip, Inc. are ideal high-speed <b>pulse</b> <b>counters,</b> because, unlike many similar microcontrollers, PIC microcontrollers allow external clocking of some of their internal 16 -bit registers, which can thus act as counters. The NPM uses twin PIC 18 F 252 microcontrollers (Microchip Technology Inc., 2006), each having two externally clocked 16 -bit counters. Because the output frequency of the magnetic sensors is sufficiently high to overflow the counters over the course of one second, frequency is measured by reading the stored counts added to the counter range multiplied by the number of timer overflows that occurred over the course of 1 second. The PIC counters return the resulting frequency measurement over a 9600 -baud TTL-level serial data stream, which is easily read by the control microcontroller. As each PIC is able to count two pulse streams, one of the PICs returns the frequencies of sensors X and Y, while the second PIC returns the frequency of sensor Z, leaving a spare channel.|$|R

It is of outmost importance to analyze the scalability and limits of such a design workflow. To analyze the design capabilities of libraries of regulatory elements, we have developed the first automated design approach that combines such elements to search the genotype space associated to a given phenotypic behavior. Herein, we calculated the designability of dynamical functions obtained from circuits assembled with a given genetic library. By designing circuits working as amplitude filters, <b>pulse</b> <b>counters</b> and oscillators, we could infer new mechanisms for such behaviors.

40|$|SummaryThe {{mechanisms}} {{behind the}} induction of cellular correlates of memory by sensory input and {{their contribution to}} meaningful behavioral changes are largely unknown. We previously reported a graded memory {{in the form of}} sensorimotor adaptation in the electromotor output of electric fish.

This mechanism rapidly integrates hundreds of spikes in a second, or gradually integrates the same number of spikes delivered over tens of minutes. Thus, this mechanism appears immune to frequency-dependent fluctuations in input and operates as a simple <b>pulse</b> <b>counter</b> over a wide range of time scales, enabling it to transduce graded sensory information into a graded memory and a corresponding change in the behavioral output. This adaptation is based on an NMDA receptor-mediated change in intrinsic excitability of the postsynaptic neurons involving the Ca 2 +-dependent activation of TRP channels...|$|E

Quantitative techniques that have been developed to overcome this difficulty include frequency analysis (Richardson, 1951; Walton, 1952) and the estimation of mean potential duration (Kugelberg, 1949; Pinelli and Buchthal, 1953). Frequency analysers are costly and complicated items of equipment (the analyser described by Walton contained 27 resonant circuits) and are not in general use.
