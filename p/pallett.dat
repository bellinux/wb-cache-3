5|$|Founded in 2001 {{by friends}} and classmates Win Butler and Josh Deu, the band came to {{prominence}} in 2004 {{with the release of}} their critically acclaimed debut album Funeral. Their second studio album, Neon Bible, won them the 2008 Meteor Music Award for Best International Album and the 2008 Juno Award for Alternative Album of the Year. Their third studio album, The Suburbs, was released in 2010 to critical acclaim and commercial success. It received many accolades, including the 2011 Grammy for Album of the Year, the 2011 Juno Award for Album of the Year and the 2011 Brit Award for Best International Album. In 2013, Arcade Fire released their fourth album, Reflektor, and scored the feature film Her, for which band members William Butler and Owen <b>Pallett</b> were nominated in the Best Original Score category at the 86th Academy Awards. In 2017, the band released their fifth studio album Everything Now. The band's first four studio albums have received nominations for the Best Alternative Music Album Grammy. The band's work has also been named three times as a shortlist nominee for the Polaris Music Prize: in 2007 for Neon Bible, in 2011 for The Suburbs and in 2014 for Reflektor, winning the award for The Suburbs.|$|E
25|$|The quartet {{was invited}} by Owen <b>Pallett</b> {{to play the}} Maximum Black Festival in various cities across Europe, with Dirty Projectors opening. During the tours that followed, Deerhoof {{performed}} onstage with several of their musical heroes. In August 2009 in Los Angeles, legendary avant-garde jazz trumpeter Wadada Leo Smith came onstage as guest for nearly their entire set. In December in Luzerne, Switzerland, Marlene Marder of the legendary Swiss band LiLiPUT performed on stage with the band. During this time Deerhoof also contributed a track to The Green Owl Comp: A Benefit for the Energy Action Coalition.|$|E
25|$|From 1894, Warwickshire's {{games against}} other {{first-class}} sides were also {{considered to be}} first-class, though the team did not join the County Championship until 1895. In 1894, Whitehead, alongside Henry <b>Pallett,</b> formed part of an extremely successful bowling line-up, and he took five wickets in an innings five times, on four occasions going on to take 10 or more wickets in a match. His best bowling performance came in Warwickshire's first first-class match when he took eight Nottinghamshire wickets for 47 runs; {{this was the best}} bowling of his career. He almost equalled that return in the very next game by taking eight Surrey wickets for 49 in the first innings. Whitehead's success brought him selection for one of the representative sides in a non-Test cricket season: he played for A. J. Webbe's XI alongside notables such as Lord Hawke and F. S. Jackson against Cambridge University and took eight wickets in the game. He was, however, unable to sustain this level of performance, though he finished the 1894 season with 73 wickets at the respectable bowling average of 17.17 runs per wicket.|$|E

500|$|Her (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack), {{the score}} for the film, was {{composed}} by Arcade Fire and Owen <b>Pallett,</b> with <b>Pallett</b> and Will Butler of Arcade Fire being the major contributors. At the 86th Academy Awards, the soundtrack was nominated for Best Original Score. In addition to the Score, Arcade Fire also wrote the song [...] "Supersymmetry" [...] for the film which appears on their album Reflektor. The melody for the song from the same album, called [...] "Porno" [...] can also be heard during the soundtrack.|$|E
5000|$|... "The Sea" [...] {{also appears}} on the Final Fantasy Young Canadian Mothers 7" [...] as [...] "The Sea (Tenderizer)". This {{recording}} is distinctly different from the Has a Good Home recording, sounding softer and less like a sea-shanty, and favouring a mix of instruments as opposed to <b>Pallett's</b> violin and voice alone.|$|R
5000|$|Rusty Santos (born August 14, 1979) is {{a record}} {{producer}} and musician based in New York City. He is known for producing, recording, mixing and/or mastering records like Animal Collective’s Sung Tongs and the reissue of Danse Manatee, Panda Bear’s Person Pitch, Born Ruffians’ Red, Yellow & Blue, Owen <b>Pallett's</b> Heartland & In Conflict, DJ Rashad's Welcome to the Chi, Dawn of Midi's [...] "Dysnomia", Boon's [...] "There's No Saving This House",and many more.|$|R
5000|$|At Rolling Stone, Ned Raggett {{rated the}} album three-and-a-half stars, stating that [...] "In Conflict is a pop {{treasure}} that's also a stirring, personal work of art." [...] Sasha Geffen of Consequence of Sound graded the album an A-, writing that [...] "In Conflict is ominous, gloomy, and marked {{with some of}} the most playful arrangements <b>Pallett’s</b> laid to date." [...] James Christopher Monger of AllMusic rated the album four-and-a-half stars, writing that the music contains a mixture of the [...] "sugary opulence" [...] reminiscent of Kishi Bashi and Jónsi and the [...] "chilly refinement" [...] akin to Björk circa 1997's Homogenic time period.|$|R
500|$|The {{band was}} rumoured {{to be working}} with {{producer}} Markus Dravs on the soundtrack for the Richard Kelly film The Box. Win Butler denied the claims, but stated that he and Owen <b>Pallett</b> [...] "may do an instrumental piece or two" [...] for the film.|$|E
500|$|Arcade Fire members William Butler and Owen <b>Pallett</b> {{received}} an Oscar nomination for Best Original score for Spike Jonze's 2013 science-fiction romance film Her. Speculation emerged in August that the album would be named Reflektor after images began circulating of street art using the name. These images {{were collected on}} an Instagram account and later uploads noted the date of September 9 and time of 9 P.M. Arcade Fire confirmed their connection to the campaign with a billboard put up in New York City on August 26, 2013. A week later, the band released a 15-second music clip on Spotify titled [...] "9pm 9/9" [...] under the album name Reflektor.|$|E
500|$|Arcade Fire {{made their}} first {{appearance}} on Saturday Night Live on February 24, 2007 (Episode 618), performing [...] "Intervention" [...] and [...] "Keep the Car Running". Owen <b>Pallett</b> {{was not present}} as he was recording for his solo project. During the performance, one of Win Butler's guitar strings broke, prompting him to rip the strings from his acoustic guitar and smash {{it on the floor}} until it shattered. On this guitar, [...] "sak vide pa kanpe" [...] was written in duct tape across the front. A Haitian proverb meaning [...] "An empty sack cannot stand up" [...] in Creole, this may have been a reference to the extreme poverty of Haiti, the country of origin of Régine Chassagne.|$|E
5000|$|In October 2007 Final Fantasy {{released}} a vinyl 7" [...] on Tomlab's Alphabet Single series ( [...] The Letter [...] "X" [...] ). The two tracks on [...] "X", recorded in Montreal with Zach Condon, {{of the band}} Beirut; predate the album He Poos Clouds. The tracks - [...] "Hey Dad" [...] and [...] "What Do You Think Will Happen Next?" [...] are both played regularly at live shows. The song [...] "Hey Dad" [...] contains a melody borrowed from the Nintendo video game [...] "Super Mario Bros. 3"; specifically it is the music from the [...] "Coin Heaven" [...] bonus/hidden stages. Also, the song is quite similar in melody, lyrics and tone to another of <b>Pallett's</b> songs - [...] "→".|$|R
5000|$|The {{start of}} 2008 saw Tucker out on tour {{throughout}} the UK with label-mates Fuck Buttons. The live debut of Stephen O'Malley & Alexander Tucker Duo {{is set to}} feature {{as part of the}} London date of Owen <b>Pallett's</b> Maximum Black Festival. In April Tucker released an edition of the ATP Recordings label's double 7" [...] single project entitled [...] "Custom Made". This featured a preview of the song [...] "Veins To The Sky" [...] which would feature on the forthcoming third album Portal. Veins was highlighted by Pitchfork Media and other media sources as a very positive progression from Tucker. The Pitchfork article highlighted its [...] "symphonic textures and miasmic chord changes that will grab your attention...a hybrid between ancient sounds and the psychedelic capacities of one man." ...|$|R
50|$|The more {{competitive}} cricket that Warwickshire's {{entry into the}} County Championship in 1895 brought had some impact on <b>Pallett's</b> bowling figures, but with 95 wickets {{at an average of}} 21.49 he was the team's leading wicket-taker and second only to the irregular bowler Alfred Glover in terms of average. His best bowling came in an early-season game against Derbyshire, when he took eight first-innings wickets for 69 runs, and these were the best Championship figures he achieved in his career. He was less effective in 1896, when his 74 wickets cost more than 25 runs apiece, and even less so in 1897, with a poor return of 44 wickets costing more than 33 runs each. In these seasons, however, his batting improved and he made two scores of 55, the first of them, against Surrey in 1896, being not out and therefore counting as his highest first-class score.|$|R
500|$|The band {{began working}} on the track in 2011, with vocalist and guitarist Win Butler noting, [...] "We {{recorded}} {{a little bit in}} Louisiana with the Haitian percussionists [...] and we kind of lived with that. It's an incredibly long process." [...] Regular Arcade Fire collaborators Owen <b>Pallett</b> and Colin Stetson provided instrumental parts, alongside English musician David Bowie who provided vocals for the song. Regarding Bowie's guest appearance on the track, multi-instrumentalist Richard Reed Parry noted, [...] "It was just after The Next Day had come out. He basically just came by the studio in New York while we were mixing, just to have a listen to the stuff we were doing. He offered to lend us his services because he really liked the song. In fact, he basically threatened us – he was like, 'If you don't hurry up and mix this song, I might just steal it from you!' So we thought, well why don't we go one better, why don't you sing on our version? Thankfully he obliged, and we were really happy about that." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "The second {{key to this}} song's Enormous Chart Success," [...] <b>Pallett</b> continues, [...] "has to do {{with the}} {{weighting}} of the melody lines." [...] Perry begins singing each verse on the beat ("you think I'm pretty ...") but then falls off it {{before the end of the}} first line ("... makeup on"), syncopating the melody, creating additional tension. [...] "Her lines dovetail elegantly into each other. This contributes to the feeling of suspension that I mentioned above. As listeners, we're waiting for her to get to the point." [...] <b>Pallett</b> says she does indeed do this in the pre-chorus, when she accentuates the imperatives ("Let's go all the way tonight ...") by returning to the beat. <b>Pallett</b> than calls it [...] "genius" [...] that the chorus itself inverts the weighting of the verses, as the line [...] "You make me feel like I'm living a teenage dream" [...] goes from off beat to on and then back again, in a single line.|$|E
2500|$|In February 2009, CBC Radio 3 participated with Exclaim! and aux.tv {{to launch}} X3, a new {{collaborative}} cross-promotional platform which sees all three outlets air feature content spotlighting a particular [...] "Artist of the Month".

2500|$|That {{suspension}} {{is created}} [...] "simply, by denying the listener any I chords," [...] <b>Pallett</b> explains. After {{the first few}} lines, the B tonic chord that repeats throughout the song is offset by bass notes that give it a more dominant 7th feel. [...] "The I chord will never appear again," [...] he observes. At the same time, however, Perry begins singing the melody on that note, and returns to it frequently, even when it clashes with the dominant V chord as she sings [...] "feel like I'm living a". [...] "he vocal melody establishes the key so clearly {{that there is no}} doubt ... Her voice is the sun and the song is in orbit around it," [...] he concludes. [...] "The insistence of the tonic in the melody keeps your ears’ eyes fixed on the destination, but the song never arrives there. Weightlessness is achieved. Great work, songwriters!" [...] <b>Pallett</b> notes other classic pop songs, such as Fleetwood Mac's [...] "Dreams" [...] and Coldplay's [...] "Viva La Vida", that employ the same device.|$|E
2500|$|In a 2014 {{article in}} Slate, {{composer}} Owen <b>Pallett</b> analyzed the song using music theory to explain its success. He focused on two factors: the tonal interplay of the chords and melody, and Perry's use of syncopation in her vocals. [...] "This song {{is all about}} suspension—not in the voice-leading 4–3 sense, but in the emotional sense, which listeners often associate with 'exhilaration,' being on the road, being on a roller coaster, travel," [...] he explained.|$|E
2500|$|Further, <b>Pallett</b> writes, in the song's bridge, Perry adds more {{complexity}} to the song—and {{makes it more}} memorable, in his opinion—by taking the simple step of singing the [...] "let you {{put your hands on}} me in my skintight jeans" [...] lyrics entirely on beat, including the reiteration of the song's title. [...] "How brilliant. The title of the song is rhythmically weighted two ways—it's like a flank attack. Two sides of the same face. You WILL remember the name of this song." ...|$|E
2500|$|Independent artists, such as Owen <b>Pallett,</b> The Shondes, and Andrew Bird, {{have also}} spurred {{increased}} interest in the instrument. Indie bands have often embraced new and unusual arrangements, allowing them more freedom to feature the violin than many mainstream musical artists. [...] It {{has been used in}} the post-rock genre by bands such as A Genuine Freakshow, Sigur Rós, Zox, Broken Social Scene, and A Silver Mt. Zion. The electric violin has even been used by bands like The Crüxshadows within the context of keyboard based music. Lindsey Stirling plays the violin in conjunction with electronic/dubstep/trance rifts and beats.|$|E
2500|$|In 2009 Grizzly Bear {{played at}} the Brooklyn Academy of Music on February 28 with Owen <b>Pallett,</b> backed by an {{orchestra}} arranged by Nico Muhly and conducted by Michael Christie. They played new songs from Veckatimest as well as songs from Yellow House. Ed Droste has stated that many songs (such as [...] "Central and Remote", [...] "Reprise" [...] and [...] "Campfire") will not be played again unless backed by an orchestra. In March 2009, they played two showcases at South by Southwest Festival in Austin, Texas. [...] In July 2009, they {{played at the}} Pitchfork Music Festival in Chicago, Illinois.|$|E
2500|$|Shilton was a lower-order {{right-handed}} batsman and a left-arm bowler variously {{described as}} slow orthodox spin and medium-pace {{with the ability}} to [...] "break both ways and vary his pace without in any way altering his action". His best bowling was achieved before Warwickshire gained first-class status: in the match against Leicestershire in 1888, for example, he finished the game with four wickets in four balls. Despite not playing for a major team, Shilton was selected for occasional first-class representative matches across the 1880s, appearing in the North v South game in 1884 and in England XIs against the 1886 and 1888 Australians. He was credited, alongside Harry <b>Pallett,</b> with the bowling prowess that led to Warwickshire's elevation to first-class status, and Lord Hawke was quoted as saying, when Warwickshire was a [...] "second class" [...] county, that [...] "Shilton was the only first-class man in the team".|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} {{featured in the}} March 21, 2012 issue of Kerrang! magazine, Bennington stated that the band has returned to more 'familiar' territory on their new record, saying [...] "with this [...] album, we've incorporated a lot of guitar work with big choruses and the heavier electronic stuff to give it that really big wall of sound feeling without getting too metal. This will be more familiar to people than A Thousand Suns was, where we were like 'Fuck it, we're {{just going to go}} bonkers." [...] Bennington also said that the new album's lyrics would be personal and avoid being political, adding [...] "We've been writing a lot about relationships." [...] Bennington and Shinoda echoed similar statements during {{an interview}} with Spin, with the former commenting that [...] "We now know we have the skills and the tools to take those ideas and make them into what we're actually looking for, as opposed to getting into it and discovering that it just sounds really nü-metal. That's always going to be gross to us, but we can take elements of that and reinvent the vibe, make it new and fresh." [...] The two previewed five songs from the album, as well as announced that they had collaborated with Canadian musician Owen <b>Pallett.</b> The vocalists also stated that they have adopted numerous influences and topics for the album, particularly about people.|$|E
