40|$|The Regolith and Environment Science and Oxygen & Lunar Volatile Extraction (RESOLVE) project aims to {{demonstrate}} the utility of "in situ resource utilization". In situ resource utilization (ISRU) is a way to rebalance the economics of spaceflight by reducing or eliminating materials that must be brought up from Earth and placed {{on the surface of the}} Moon for human use. RESOLVE is developing a rover-borne payload that (1) can locate near subsurface volatiles, (2) excavate and analyze samples of the volatile-bearing regolith, and (3) demonstrate the form, extractability and usefulness of the materials. Such investigations are important not only for ISRU but are also critically important for understanding the scientific nature of these intriguing lunar polar volatile deposits. Temperature models and orbital data suggest near surface volatile concentrations may exist at briefly lit lunar polar locations outside persistently shadowed regions. A lunar rover could be remotely operated at some of these locations for the 4 - 7 days of expected sunlight at relatively low cost. In July 2012 the RESOLVE project conducted a full-scale field demonstration. In particular, the ability to perform the real-time measurement analysis necessary to search for volatiles and the ability to combine the various measurement techniques to meet the mission measurement and science goals. With help from the Pacific International Space Center for Exploration Systems (PISCES), a lunar rover prototype (provided by the Canadian Space Agency) was equipped with <b>prospecting</b> <b>instruments</b> (neutron spectrometer and near-infrared spectrometer), subsurface access and sampling tools, including both an auger and coring drill (provided by CSA) and subsurface sample analysis instrumentation, including a sample oven system, the Oxygen and Volatile Extraction Node (OVEN), and Gas Chromatograph / Mass Spectrometer system, the Lunar Advanced Volatile Analysis (LAVA) system. Given the relatively short time period this lunar mission is being designed to, prospecting needs to occur in near real-time. The two <b>prospecting</b> <b>instruments</b> are the neutron and NIR spectrometers. In the field demo a small radioactive source was provided the neutron flux. The NIR spectrometer, which includes its own light source, looks at surface reflectance for signatures of bound H 20 / 0 H and general mineralogy. Once a "hot spot" was found by the <b>prospecting</b> <b>instruments,</b> the drill could either auger or core. The auger drill worked to a depth of 50 cm and is monitored with a drill camera and the NIR spectrometer. As cuttings are brought up the NIR spectra is monitored. If a particular location is considered of high -interest then the decision to core could be made. The coring drill (a push-tube) allowed a meter sample to be acquired processed by the OVEN/LAVA sys-tem. This presentation will provide details as how these instruments worked together and how and if the planned measurements and science was obtained...|$|E
40|$|International audienceFor {{the past}} forty years {{electromagnetic}} <b>prospecting</b> <b>instruments</b> {{have played a}} growing role in the mapping of soil EM properties in the very low-frequency (VLF) range for a large variety of applications and they {{are now beginning to}} be applied in the medium-frequency range. Measurement interpretations, however, necessitate expressing the results in terms of physical properties. This step allows not only comparisons and joint interpretation with data generated by different electromagnetic induction (EMI) instruments but also with other types of field measurements e. g., vertical electrical sounding (VES) or electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) or laboratory tests on samples. The calibration process here proposed is based on comparisons between the instrument responses and: (1) an exact 1 D multi-layer analytical modelling that takes the three EM properties into account, i. e., the electrical conductivity, the complex magnetic susceptibility and the complex dielectric permittivity when the instrument is elevated above a layered ground; (2) the response to purely conductive metallic spheres, which only depends on the diameter of the spheres. It is applied to two instrument prototypes: one in the VLF frequency range and the other in the medium-frequency (MF) range...|$|E
40|$|Data {{gathered}} from lunar missions {{within the last}} two decades have significantly enhanced our understanding of the volatile resources available on the lunar surface, specifically focusing on the polar regions. Several orbiting missions such as Clementine and Lunar Prospector have suggested the presence of volatile ices and enhanced hydrogen concentrations in the permanently shadowed regions of the moon. The Lunar Crater Observation and Sensing Satellite (LCROSS) mission was the first to provide direct measurement of water ice in a permanently shadowed region. These missions with other orbiting assets have laid the groundwork for {{the next step in the}} exploration of the lunar surface; providing ground truth data of the volatiles by mapping the distribution and processing lunar regolith for resource extraction. This next step is the robotic mission Resource Prospector (RP). Resource Prospector is a lunar mission to investigate 'strategic knowledge gaps' (SKGs) for in-situ resource utilization (ISRU). The mission is proposed to land in the lunar south pole near a permanently shadowed crater. The landing site will be determined by the science team with input from broader international community as being near traversable landscape that has a high potential of containing elevated concentrations of volatiles such as water while maximizing mission duration. A rover will host the Regolith & Environment Science and Oxygen & Lunar Volatile Extraction (RESOLVE) payload for resource mapping and processing. The science instruments on the payload include a 1 -meter drill, neutron spectrometer, a near infrared spectrometer, an operations camera, and a reactor with a gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer for volatile analysis. After the RP lander safely delivers the rover to the lunar surface, the science team will guide the rover team on the first traverse plan. The neutron spectrometer (NS) and near infrared (NIR) spectrometer instruments will be used as prospecting tools to guide the traverse path. The NS will map the water-equivalent hydrogen concentration as low as 0. 5 % by weight to an 80 centimeter depth as the rover traverses the lunar landscape. The NIR spectrometer will measure surficial H 2 O/OH as well as general mineralogy. When the <b>prospecting</b> <b>instruments</b> identify a potential volatile-rich area during the course of a traverse, the prospect is then mapped out and the most promising location identified. An augering drill capable of sampling to a depth of 100 centimeters will excavate regolith for analysis. A quick assay of the drill cuttings will be made using an operations camera and NIR spectrometer. With the water depth confirmed by this first auguring activity, a regolith sample may be extracted for processing. The drill will deliver the regolith sample to a crucible that will be sealed and heated. Evolved volatiles will be measured by a gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer and the water will be captured and photographed. RP is a solar powered mission, which given the polar location translates to a relatively short mission duration on the order of 4 - 15 days. This short mission duration drives the concept of operations, instrumentation, and data analysis towards critical real time analysis and decision support. Previous payload field tests have increased the fidelity of the hardware, software, and mission operations. Current activities include a mission level field test to optimize interfaces between the payload and rover as well as better understand the interaction of the science and rover teams during the mission timeline. This paper will include the current status of the science instruments on the payload as well as the integrated field test occurring in fall of 2015. The concept of operations will be discussed, including the real time science and engineering decision-making process based on the critical data from the instrumentation. The path to flight will be discussed with the approach to this ambitious low cost mission...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Some {{models for}} quantum gravity (QG) violate Lorentz {{invariance}} and predict an energy {{dependence of the}} speed of light, leading to a dispersion of high-energy gamma-ray signals that travel over cosmological distances. Limits on the dispersion from short-duration substructures observed in gamma-rays emitted by gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) at cosmological distances have provided interesting bounds on Lorentz invariance violation (LIV). Recent observations of unprecedentedly fast flares in the very-high energy gamma-ray emission of the active galactic nuclei (AGNs) Mkn 501 in 2005 and PKS 2155 – 304 in 2006 resulted in the most constraining limits on LIV from light-travel observations, approaching the Planck mass scale, at which QG effects are assumed to become important.

40|$|Recent {{mid-infrared}} (MIR) interferometric observations {{showed in}} few AGN {{that the bulk}} of the infrared emission originates from the polar region above the putative torus, where only little dust should be present.

The relative amount of resolved MIR emission is at least 40 per cent and scales with the narrow emission line fluxes implying a strong connection between the extended continuum and line emitters. These results together with the radio-quiet nature of the Seyferts support the scenario {{that the bulk of}} MIR emission is emitted by dust in the polar region and not by the torus, which would demand a new paradigm for the infrared emission structure in AGN.

40|$|Direct imaging {{searches}} {{have begun}} to detect planetary and brown dwarf companions and to place constraints {{on the presence of}} giant planets at large separations from their host star. This work helps to motivate such planet searches by predicting a population of young giant planets that could be detectable by direct imaging campaigns. Both the classical core accretion and the gravitational instability model for planet formation are hard pressed to form long-period planets in situ. Here, we show that dynamical instabilities among planetary systems that originally formed multiple giant planets much closer to the host star could produce a population of giant planets at large (≈ 10 ^ 2 - 10 ^ 5 AU) separations. We estimate the limits within which these planets may survive, quantify the efficiency of gravitational scattering into both stable and unstable wide orbits, and demonstrate that population analyses must take into account the age of the system. We predict that planet scattering creates detectable giant planets on wide orbits that decreases in number on timescales of 10 Myr. We demonstrate that several members of such populations should be detectable with current technology, quantify the <b>prospects</b> for future <b>instruments,</b> and suggest how they could place interesting constraints on planet formation models. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{concept for}} a new multi-spectral canopy LIDAR (MSCL) {{instrument}} was tested by simulating return waveforms using models providing tree structure (TREEGROW) and leaf reflectance (<b>PROSPECT).</b> The proposed <b>instrument</b> will take measurements at four different wavelengths, which were chosen according to physiological processes altering leaf reflectance. The modelling {{was used to assess}} both the structural and physiological information content such a device could provide, especially if the normally structure-dominated return waveform would pick up small changes in reflectance at the leaf level. Multi-spectral waveforms were simulated for models of single Scots pine trees of different ages and at different stages of the growing season. It was shown that the LIDAR waveforms would not only capture the tree height information, but as would also pick up the seasonal and vertical variation of NDVI computed from two of the four MSCL wavelengths inside the tree canopy. It could be demonstrated that a new multi-wavelength LIDAR predictor variable could significantly improve the retrieval accuracy of photosynthetically active biomass opposed to using a single wavelength LIDAR alone. It remains unclear, however, if these findings would persist for forest stands; thus such experiments simulating more complex scenarios will be the next task in this modelling framework...|$|R

This is called warm-hot intergalactic medium (WHIM). In this paper, we summarize search for emission from the WHIM, and show <b>prospects</b> with future <b>instruments.</b> Using XIS instrument onboard Suzaku, we searched for redshifted OVII and OVIII WHIM emission lines, in cluster outskirts and superclusters: Shapley supercluster, Sculptor supercluster, A 2218, A 1413, A 2142, A 2052, and the Coma cluster. The chance for detecting a signal {{was estimated to be}} sufficient to motivate our search, given the relatively high density and high temperature expected for the WHIM in these regions. We did not detect the significant emission, but obtained upper limits in OVII and OVIII emission intensities for these clusters and superclusters. The density of the WHIM was constrained based on the upper limits, which is 200 - 300 times mean baryon density of the Universe. Future instruments such as microcalorimeters have much higher sensitivity for weak lines. In particular a combination of a microcalorimeter and large grasp (effective area times field of view) telescope is ideal for mapping of the WHIM. We created mock spectra that contain the WHIM, cosmic X-ray background and Galactic emission. Here we present our results concerning detectability and expected 3 -d maps of the line emitting regions asssociated to the WHIM, with future missions such as EDGE/XENIA...|$|R
40|$|This {{habilitation}} thesis {{consists of}} seven published journal articles and one published book chapter. Part I, consisting of chapter 1, introduces the overarching theme of environmental policy instruments and discusses the current use of and <b>prospects</b> for economic <b>instruments</b> in conservation policies. A number of research gaps are identified which are {{addressed in the}} subsequent chapters. Part II, consisting of chapters 2 – 5, encompasses four papers focused on a single type of policy instrument: intergovernmental fiscal transfers. Although well documented in public finance literature, intergovernmental fiscal transfers remain a somewhat neglected instrument in environmental policy. Despite being well suited to address the spillover benefits that often accrue with conservation policies, there is scant research literature on ecological fiscal transfers compared to other economic instruments such as environmental taxes or tradable permits. In fact, very few countries make practical use of them to achieve conservation objectives. Thus intergovernmental fiscal transfers are an innovative instrument in conservation policies in particular, so that advances in both theory and applied research may prove especially beneficial here. Part III, consisting of chapters 6 – 9, combines a number of articles in integrative biodiversity research and applied biodiversity governance, themes that are often neglected in the economic analysis of environmental policy instruments. However, when implementing policy instruments in societal settings, interdisciplinary research bridging the natural and social sciences {{is as much a}} prerequisite as policy-relevant research that responds to the needs of decision makers and other stakeholders. Both policy design and policy evaluation yield the best outcomes when they involve ecologists, economists, legal and other social scientists, as this ensures that consideration is given to ecological effectiveness, economic efficiency, administrative feasibility, social acceptance, and perception by stakeholders. Policy-relevant research also responds to current societal developments and prospective changes in legislation which may provide windows of opportunity to propose new instruments. Meanwhile, sound empirical research and case study design are indispensable in making concrete policy recommendations, taking into account existing formal and informal institutions...|$|R
40|$|A major {{objective}} of the grant was to complete the fabrication, test, and evaluation of the atmosphere structure experiment on the Galileo Probe, and to receive, analyze, and interpret data received from the spacecraft. The grantee was competitively selected to be Principal Investigator of Jupiter's atmosphere structure on the Galileo Probe. His primary motivation was {{to learn as much}} as possible about Jupiter's atmosphere by means of a successful atmosphere structure experiment, and to support the needs and schedule of the Galileo Project. After a number of launch delays, the Flight instrument was shipped to Kennedy Space Center 2 years after the start of this collaboration, on April 14, 1989, at which time it was determined from System level tests of the ASI on the Probe that the instrument was in good working order and ready for flight. The spacecraft was launched on October 18, 1989. Data analysis of test and calibration data taken over a period of years of instrument testing was continued in preparation for the encounter. The initial instrument checkout in space was performed on October 26, 1989. The data set received by telemetry was thoroughly analyzed, and a report of the findings was transmitted to the Probe Operations Office on Feb. 28, 1990. Key findings reported were that the accelerometer biases had shifted by less than 1 mg through launch and since calibration at Bell Aerospace in 1983; accelerometer scale factors, evaluated by means of calibration currents, fell on lines of variation with temperature established in laboratory calibrations; pressure sensor offsets, correlated as a function of temperature, fell generally within the limits of several years of ground test data; atmospheric and engineering temperature sensor data were internally consistent within a few tenths of a degree; and the instrument electronics performed all expected functions without any observable fault. Altogether, this checkout was highly encouraging of the <b>prospects</b> of <b>instrument</b> performance, although performed greater than 5 years prior to Jupiter encounter. Capability of decoding the science data from the Experiment Data Record to be provided at encounter was developed and exercised using the tape recording of the first Cruise Checkout data. A team effort was organized to program the selection and combination of data words defining pressure, temperature, acceleration, turbulence, and engineering quantities; to apply decalibration algorithms to convert readings from digital numbers to physical quantities; and to organize the data into a suitable printout. A paper on the Galileo Atmosphere Structure Instrument was written and submitted for publication in a special issue of Space Science Reviews. At the Journal editor's request, the grantee reviewed other Probe instrument papers submitted for this special issue. Calibration data were carefully taken for all experiment sensors and accumulated over a period of 10 years. The data were analyzed, fitted with algorithms, and summarized in a calibration report for use in analyzing and interpreting data returned from Jupiter's atmosphere. The sensors included were the primary science pressure, temperature, and acceleration sensors, and the supporting engineering temperature sensors.
