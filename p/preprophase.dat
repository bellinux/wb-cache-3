50|$|The <b>preprophase</b> band is a {{microtubule}} array {{found in}} plant {{cells that are}} about to undergo cell division and enter the <b>preprophase</b> stage of the plant cell cycle. Besides the phragmosome, {{it is the first}} microscopically visible sign that a plant cell is about to enter mitosis. The <b>preprophase</b> band was first observed and described by Jeremy Pickett-Heaps and Donald Northcote at Cambridge University in 1966.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>preprophase</b> {{stage of}} somatic plant cell mitosis serves to {{establish}} the precise location of the division plane and future cell wall before the cell enters prophase. This is achieved through {{the formation of a}} transient microtubule structure, the <b>preprophase</b> band, and a so far unknown mechanism by which the cell is able to [...] "memorize" [...] the position of the <b>preprophase</b> band to guide the new cell wall growing during cytokinesis to the correct location. In gametophyte tissues during the reproductive phase of the plant life cycle, cell division planes may be established without the use of a <b>preprophase</b> band.|$|E
50|$|At the {{beginning}} of <b>preprophase,</b> the cortical microtubules of a plant cell disappear and aggregate into a dense ring underneath the plasma membrane. This <b>preprophase</b> band runs around the equatorial plane of the future mitotic spindle and marks the plane of cell division and future fusion site for the cell plate. It consists of microtubules and microfilaments (actin) and persists into prophase. Spindle formation occurs during prophase with the axis perpendicular to the plane surrounded by the <b>preprophase</b> band.|$|E
5000|$|During {{progression}} from <b>preprophase</b> into prophase, the randomly oriented microtubules align parallel along the nuclear surface {{according to the}} spindle axis. This structure is called the prophase spindle. Triggered by nuclear membrane breakdown {{at the beginning of}} prometaphase, the <b>preprophase</b> band disappears and the prophase spindle matures into the metaphase spindle occupying the space of the former nucleus. Experiments with drugs destroying microfilaments indicate that actin {{may play a role in}} keeping the cellular [...] "memory" [...] of the position of the division plane after the <b>preprophase</b> band breaks down to direct cytokinesis in telophase.|$|E
50|$|In highly vacuolated plant cells, <b>preprophase</b> may be {{preceded by}} the {{formation}} of a phragmosome. The function of the phragmosome is to suspend the cell nucleus {{in the center of the}} cell in preparation for mitosis. If a phragmosome is visible, the <b>preprophase</b> band will appear at its outer edge.|$|E

50|$|In {{contrast}} to animal cells, plant cells {{do not possess}} centrosomes to organize their mitotic spindles. Instead, the nuclear envelope acts as a microtubule organizing center (MTOC) for spindle formation during <b>preprophase.</b> The first sign is a clear, actin-free zone appearing around the nuclear envelope. This zone fills with microtubules nucleating {{on the surface of}} the nucleus. The <b>preprophase</b> spindle forms by self-assembly of these microtubules in the cytoplasm surrounding the nuclear envelope. It is reinforced through chromosome (kinetochore)-mediated spindle assembly after the nuclear envelope breaks down at the end of prophase.|$|E
50|$|The <b>preprophase</b> band disappears {{as soon as}} {{the nuclear}} {{envelope}} breaks down and the mitotic spindle forms, leaving behind an actin-depleted zone. However, its position marks the future fusion sites for the new cell plate with the existing cell wall during telophase. When mitosis is completed, the cell plate and new cell wall form starting from the center along the plane occupied by the phragmosome. The cell plate grows outwards until it fuses with the cell wall of the dividing cell at exactly the spots predicted by the position of the <b>preprophase</b> band.|$|E

50|$|In plant cells only, {{prophase}} is {{preceded by}} a pre-prophase stage. In highly vacuolated plant cells, the nucleus has to migrate {{into the center of}} the cell before mitosis can begin. This is achieved through the formation of a phragmosome, a transverse sheet of cytoplasm that bisects the cell along the future plane of cell division. In addition to phragmosome formation, <b>preprophase</b> is characterized by the formation of a ring of microtubules and actin filaments (called <b>preprophase</b> band) underneath the plasma membrane around the equatorial plane of the future mitotic spindle. This band marks the position where the cell will eventually divide. The cells of higher plants (such as the flowering plants) lack centrioles; instead, microtubules form a spindle on the surface of the nucleus and are then organized into a spindle by the chromosomes themselves, after the nuclear envelope breaks down. The <b>preprophase</b> band disappears during nuclear envelope breakdown and spindle formation in prometaphase.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Preprophase</b> is an {{additional}} phase during mitosis in plant cells that does not occur in other eukaryotes such as animals or fungi. It precedes prophase and is characterized by two distinct events: ...|$|E
50|$|Just before mitosis starts, the <b>preprophase</b> band {{forms as}} a dense band of microtubules around the phragmosome {{and the future}} {{division}} plane just below the plasma membrane. It encircles the nucleus at the equatorial plane of the future mitotic spindle when dividing cells enter the G2 phase of the cell cycle after DNA replication is complete. The <b>preprophase</b> band consists mainly of microtubules and microfilaments (actin) and is generally 2-3 Âµm wide. When stained with fluorescent markers, {{it can be seen}} as two bright spots close to the cell wall {{on either side of the}} nucleus.|$|E

5000|$|Plant cells lack centrosomes as {{microtubule}} organizing centers. Instead, the microtubules of the {{mitotic spindle}} aggregate {{on the nuclear}} surface and are reoriented to form the spindle {{at the end of}} prophase.

50|$|Just before mitosis, a dense band of microtubules appears {{around the}} phragmosome {{and the future}} {{division}} plane just below the plasma membrane. This <b>preprophase</b> band marks the equatorial plane of the future mitotic spindle {{as well as the}} future fusion sites for the new cell plate with the existing cell wall. It disappears as soon as the nuclear envelope breaks down and the mitotic spindle forms.|$|E
50|$|In {{the cell}} cycle, {{interphase}} is preceded by telophase and cytokinesis of the M phase. In alternative fashion, interphase is sometimes interrupted by G0 phase, which, in some circumstances, may then end and {{be followed by}} the remaining stages of interphase. After the successful completion of the G2 checkpoint, the final checkpoint in interphase, the cell proceeds to prophase, or in plants to <b>preprophase,</b> {{which is the first}} stage of mitosis.|$|E
50|$|The microtubules and actin {{filaments}} {{within the}} phragmoplast serve to guide vesicles with cell wall {{material to the}} growing cell plate. Actin filaments are also possibly involved in guiding the phragmoplast {{to the site of}} the former <b>preprophase</b> band location at the parent cell wall. While the cell plate is growing, segments of smooth endoplasmic reticulum are trapped within it, later forming the plasmodesmata connecting the two daughter cells.|$|E
50|$|The phragmoplast is {{a complex}} {{assembly}} of microtubules (MTs), microfilaments (MFs), and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) elements, that assemble in two opposing sets perpendicular to {{the plane of the}} future cell plate during anaphase and telophase. It is initially barrel-shaped and forms from the mitotic spindle between the two daughter nuclei while nuclear envelopes reassemble around them. The cell plate initially forms as a disc between the two halves of the phragmoplast structure. While new cell plate material is added to the edges of the growing plate, the phragmoplast microtubules disappear in the center and regenerate {{at the edges of the}} growing cell plate. The two structures grow outwards until they reach the outer wall of the dividing cell. If a phragmosome was present in the cell, the phragmoplast and cell plate will grow through the space occupied by the phragmosome. They will reach the parent cell wall exactly at the position formerly occupied by the <b>preprophase</b> band.|$|E
40|$|Many premitotic plant cells {{possess a}} {{cortical}} <b>preprophase</b> band of microtubules and actin filaments that encircles the nucleus. In vacuolated cells, the <b>preprophase</b> band is visibly {{connected to the}} nucleus by a cytoplasmic raft of actin filaments and microtubules termed the phragmosome. Typically, {{the location of the}} <b>preprophase</b> band and phragmosome corresponds to, and thus is thought to influence, the location of the cell division plane. To better understand the function of the <b>preprophase</b> band and phragmosome in orienting division, we used a green fluorescent protein-based microtubule reporter protein to observe mitosis in living tobacco bright yellow 2 cells possessing unusual <b>preprophase</b> bands. Observations of mitosis in these unusual cells support the involvement of the <b>preprophase</b> band/phragmosome in properly positioning the <b>preprophase</b> nucleus, influencing spindle orientation such that the cytokinetic phragmoplast initially grows in an appropriate direction, and delineating a region in the cell cortex that attracts microtubules and directs later stages of phragmoplast growth. Thus, the <b>preprophase</b> band/phragmosome appears to perform several interrelated functions to orient the division plane. However, functional information associated with the <b>preprophase</b> band is not always used or needed and there appears to be an age or distance-dependent character to the information. Cells treated with the anti-actin drug, latrunculin B, are still able to position the <b>preprophase</b> nucleus suggesting that microtubules may play a dominant role in premitotic positioning. Furthermore, in treated cells, spindle location and phragmoplast insertion are frequently abnormal suggesting that actin plays a significant role in nuclear anchoring and phragmoplast guidance. Thus, the microtubule and actin components of the <b>preprophase</b> band/phragmosome execute complementary activities to ensure proper orientation of the division plane...|$|E

They are also absent in roots exposed to cytochalasins B and D before fixation, but <b>preprophase</b> band microtubules at all stages of aggregation are still present. Colchicine treatment leads to the loss of both <b>preprophase</b> band microtubules and actin. The possible function of <b>preprophase</b> band actin is discussed...|$|E
40|$|Numerous vesicles were {{observed}} among the microtubules of the ' <b>preprophase</b> ' band in prophase cells from root tips of Allium cepa.

In addition, the cell walls perpendicular to the plane of (beneath) the <b>preprophase</b> band are often differentially thickened compared to the walls lying parallel to the plane of the band. Our interpretation of these observations is that the <b>preprophase</b> band may direct or channel vesicles containing precursors of the cell wall to localized regions of wall synthesis. The incorporation of constituents of the cell wall into a narrow region defined by the position of the <b>preprophase</b> band may be a mechanism that ensures unidirectional growth of meristematic cells...|$|E

40|$|Caffeine {{treatment}} of growing wheat tissues {{was used to}} form binucleate or polyploid cells; <b>preprophase</b> microtubules in subsequent division cycles in these and some other abnormal cells were then examined. In root tips, binucleate cells or those with greatly enlarged nuclei usually contained one transverse <b>preprophase</b> band of microtubules; sometimes this was slightly asymmetrical or skew, and less commonly two bands were seen. In coleoptile vascular bundles, there were generally two or more bands in the greatly elongated cells, these sometimes appearing in different planes. During formation of the stomatal complexes, <b>preprophase</b> microtubules were almost invariably found where expected, preceding abnormal development both in untreated and also in caffeine-treated material, regardless of the number, disposition or size of nuclei. This occurred even when wall stumps, formed during a previous abortive division, indicated that that previous division was also asymmetrical. It is concluded that the position(s) of <b>preprophase</b> band(s) of microtubules is not particularly influenced by the nucleus or nuclei, being more susceptible to external morphogenetic influences which can persist for some considerable time. Particularly {{in the case of}} stomatal complexes, a cell wall seems necessary to seal off or otherwise fulfil the tendency towards asymmetrical division...|$|E
40|$|At {{the onset}} of mitosis, plant cells form a microtubular <b>preprophase</b> band that defines the plane of cell division, but the {{mechanism}} of its formation remains a mystery. Here, we describe the use of mammalian yellow fluorescent protein-tagged CLIP 170 to visualize the dynamic plus ends of plant microtubules in transfected cowpea protoplasts and in stably transformed and dividing tobacco Bright Yellow 2 cells. Using plus-end labeling, we observed dynamic instability in different microtubular conformations in live plant cells. The interphase plant microtubules grow at 5 mum/min, shrink at 20 mum/min, and display catastrophe and rescue frequencies of 0. 02 and 0. 08 events/s, respectively, exhibiting faster turnover than their mammalian counterparts, Strikingly, during <b>preprophase</b> band formation, the growth rate and catastrophe frequency of plant microtubules double, whereas the shrinkage rate and rescue frequency remain unchanged, making microtubules shorter and more dynamic. Using these novel insights and four-dimensional time-lapse imaging data, we propose a model that can explain the mechanism by which changes in microtubule dynamic instability drive the dramatic rearrangements of microtubules during <b>preprophase</b> band and spindle formation in plant cells...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{colchicine}} and heavy water on cell division in wheat roots {{have been examined}} by means of mitotic index measurements correlated with an electron-microscope examination of the tissue. Heavy water alone caused an arrest of mitosis both in normal tissue and in roots which had been brought into partial synchrony of division by means of 5 -aminouracil. Colchicine alone caused an accumulation of cells at c-metaphase in the synchronized tissue. Colchicine dissolved in heavy water showed variable effects; at high heavy water concentrations (greater then 70 %) mitosis was arrested; when the heavy water concentration was less than 70 %, the mitotic index was approximately equal to that obtained by treatment of the tissue with colchicine dissolved in ordinary water. These actions of colchicine and heavy water on the mitosis of the cells have been related to the formation and organization of the microtubules in the dividing cells. Heavy-water treatment was characterized {{by an increase in}} the number of microtubules found in the <b>preprophase</b> band and in the mitotic spindle. The microtubules of the <b>preprophase</b> band in cells treated with heavy water were arranged in a highly disoriented manner. After colchicine treatment the numbers of microtubules at the <b>preprophase</b> band and in the mitotic spindle were depleted. The <b>preprophase</b> band consisted of a few microtubules situated close to the wall. In the mitotic spindle the microtubules were either not present or visible only in the vicinity of profiles of endopla 8 mic reticulum or the chromosomes. When the cells were exposed to a solution of colchi-cine in 70 % heavy water microtubules were absent from the mitotic spindle and the pre-prophase band consisted of a few microtubules which were sometimes found scattered both along the wall and dispersed further into the cytoplasm...|$|E
40|$|In higher plants, microtubule-based and actin {{filament-based}} structures play {{important roles}} in mitosis and cytokinesis. Besides the mitotic spindle, {{the evolution of a}} band comprising cortical microtubules and actin filaments, namely, the <b>preprophase</b> band, is evident in plant cells. This band forecasts a specific division plane before the initiation of mitosis. During cytokinesis, another plant-specific cytoskeletal structure called the phragmoplast guides vesicles {{in the creation of a}} new cell wall. In addition, a number of cytoskeleton-associated proteins are reportedly involved in the formation and function of the <b>preprophase</b> band, mitotic spindle, and phragmoplast. This review summarizes current knowledge on the cytoskeleton-associated proteins that mediate the cytoskeletal arrays during mitosis and cytokinesis in plant cells and discusses the interaction between microtubules and actin filaments involved in mitosis and cytokinesis...|$|E
40|$|The {{ultrastructure}} of mitosis in Euglena gracilis was investigated. At <b>preprophase</b> {{the nucleus}} migrates anteriorly and associates with the basal bodies. Flagella and basal bodies replicate at <b>preprophase.</b> Cells retain motility throughout division.

The spindle forms within the intact nuclear envelope. Polar fenestrae are absent. At metaphase, the endosome is elongated from pole to pole, and chromosomes are loosely arranged in the equatorial region. Distinct, trilayered kinetochores are present. Spindle elongates as chromosomes migrate to the poles forming a dumb-bell shaped nucleus by telophase. Daughter nuclei are formed by con-striction of the nuclear envelope. Cytokinesis is accomplished by furrowing. Cell division in Euglena is compared with that of certain other algae...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe Arabidopsis MAP 65 s are {{a protein}} family with {{similarity}} to the microtubule-associated proteins PRC 1 /Ase 1 p that accumulate in the spindle midzone during late anaphase in mammals and yeast, respectively. Here we investigate the molecular and functional properties of AtMAP 65 - 5 and improve {{our understanding of}} AtMAP 65 - 1 properties. We demonstrate that, in vitro, both proteins promote {{the formation of a}} planar network of antiparallel microtubules. In vivo, we show that AtMAP 65 - 5 selectively binds the <b>preprophase</b> band and the prophase spindle microtubule during prophase, whereas AtMAP 65 - 1 -GFP selectively binds the <b>preprophase</b> band but does not accumulate at the prophase spindle microtubules that coexists within the same cell. At later stages of mitosis, AtMAP 65 - 1 and AtMAP 65 - 5 differentially label the late spindle and phragmoplast. We present evidence for a mode of action for both proteins that involves the binding of monomeric units to microtubules that "zipper up" antiparallel arranged microtubules through the homodimerization of the N-terminal halves when adjacent microtubules encounter...|$|E
40|$|Microtubule arrays {{in living}} cells were {{analysed}} during Arabidopsis stomatal development {{in order to}} more closely define stages in the pathway and contextswhere intercellular signalling might operate. Arabidopsis stomata are patterned iteratively via the orientation of an asymmetric division in a cell located next to an existing stoma. It was found that <b>preprophase</b> bands of microtubules (PPBs) were correctly placed away from stomata and from two types of precursor cells. This suggests that all three cell types participate in an intercellular signalling pathway that orients the div-ision site. These and other asymmetric divisions in the pathway were preceded by a polarized cytoplasm, with the PPB around the nucleus at one end, and the vacuole at the other. PPBs before symmetric divisions of guard mother cells (GMCs) were broader than those in asymmetric divisions, and the GMC division site was marked by unusual end-wall thickenings.

40|$|International audiencePlant {{cells have}} {{specific}} microtubule structures involved in cell division and elongation. The tonneau 1 (ton 1) mutant of Arabidopsis thaliana displays drastic defects in morphogenesis, positioning of division planes, and cellular organization. These are primarily caused by dysfunction of the cortical cytoskeleton and {{absence of the}} <b>preprophase</b> band of microtubules. Characterization of the ton 1 insertional mutant reveals complex chromosomal rearrangements leading to simultaneous disruption of two highly similar genes in tandem, TON 1 a and TON 1 b. TON 1 proteins are conserved in land plants and share sequence motifs with human centrosomal proteins. The TON 1 protein associates with soluble and microsomal fractions of Arabidopsis cells, and a green fluorescent protein-TON 1 fusion labels cortical cytoskeletal structures, including the <b>preprophase</b> band and the interphase cortical array. A yeast two-hybrid screen identified Arabidopsis centrin as a potential TON 1 partner. This interaction was confirmed both in vitro and in plant cells. The similarity of TON 1 with centrosomal proteins and its interaction with centrin, another key component of microtubule organizing centers, suggests that functions involved {{in the organization of}} microtubule arrays by the centrosome were conserved across the evolutionary divergence between plants and animals...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{development}} of the <b>preprophase</b> band (PPB) of microtubules (MT) in meristematic plant cells was studied by using antibodies to pig brain tubulin and indirect immunofluorescence microscopy. The PPB is first visible as a wide band of MT that are arranged only slightly more densely than flanking MT of the cortical interphase array. MT progressively become more tightly packed together, and other cortical MT are no longer seen as the PPB matures. The surface of the nuclear envelope (NE) displays no tubulin fluorescence during interphase but begins to fluoresce {{in the early stages}} of PPB development, and its intensity progressively increases thereafter. The pattern at the NE is usually diffuse at first, suggesting the presence of nonpolymerized tubulin, but fibers along the NE can be resolved at later stages. MT, arranged either radially or as a meshwork, can occur between the nucleus and cell cortex, and sometimes appear to connect the PPB and NE directly. Isolated <b>preprophase</b> nuclei from cells ruptured during processing often retain the PPB in its normal orientation, indicating stable linkages between the nucleus and PPB. Fluorescent cross-bars perpendicular to the axis of the MT were resolved in some PPB, suggesting lateral linkages. This suggestio...|$|E

40|$|During the {{formation}} of stomata in the young leaves of wheat the cells divide in a character-istic manner; two of the cell divisions are asymmetrical and produce cells of unequal sizes. A study of the fine structure of the cells during mitosis has shown that a band of microtubules appears at each <b>preprophase</b> stage. This band, {{although it is not}} present in the subsequent stages of mitosis, indicates the location {{on the wall of the}} mother cell where the cell plate will join it at the final division of the cytoplasm at telophase. Thus the future plane of cell division is indicated by these microtubules at <b>preprophase.</b> Microtubules are also found at the growing edge of the cell plate and appear to function in directing the vesicles which are brought up to extend the plate. The cell plate which is formed to cut off the subsidiary cells on either side of the guard mother cell is curved, and the micro-tubules present in conjunction with this plate during its formation could function to align and hold it on the required position. The relationship of the guard mother cell to the divisions of the adjacent epidermal cells which form the subsidiary cells is discussed, and related to general problems of growth and differentiation...|$|E
