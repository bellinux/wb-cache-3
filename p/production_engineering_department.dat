50|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, the State Government began {{to find the}} {{logistics}} of controlling these colleges from Madras to be tedious and split the aegis into the Bharathidasan and Bharathiyar universities for the Tiruchirappalli and Coimbatore areas, respectively. In 1982, the college was thus incorporated under the Bharathidasan University umbrella, of which Dr. P.S. Manisundaram served as the inaugural Vice-Chancellor. The Institute would grant degrees under this name for the next 20 years, except for a brief stint under Anna University in 2001 and 2002. The college continued its progress under Bharathidasan University and introduced a Computer Science Department around 1984, split off the Mechanical Engineering Department’s manufacturing stream into a <b>Production</b> <b>Engineering</b> <b>Department</b> and introduced the Instrumentation and Control Engineering Department in 1992.|$|E
50|$|From 1964 to 1971, {{the faculty}} functioned {{under the old}} regulations. Due to the {{language}} regulations of 1956, students entering the faculty had to switch from their respective mother language to English - the medium of instruction of the faculty - to follow lectures. This caused some difficulties for students, which were addressed partially in 1970 by making bilingual streams for first year students. The first new department, Department of Mathematics was created in 1965 by Prof. E.F. Bartholomeusz. In 1971, the faculty received an IBM 1130, the first university computer in the country. The student unrests in 1965 and 1966 prompted the government to create a National Council for Higher Education (NCHE) to overlook the university system as the executive authority. In 1971, three other departments, Department of <b>Production</b> <b>Engineering,</b> <b>Department</b> of Chemical Engineering and Department of Agricultural Engineering {{were added to the}} faculty.|$|E

40|$|Human {{capital is}} {{undergoing}} {{major changes in}} organizations throughout the world. As a result, several management policies and actions are being suggested and deployed. In particular they are staring {{to be used as}} an element of marketing strategy in Brasil first to attract top professionals, executives and managers and secondly to promote corporate image with the aura of best employee relations. One of the theories exploited is a philosophy developed at the University of Southern California Center for Effective Organizations holding that, in order to achieve employee involvement, every organization should provide employees with training, information, decision-making power and rewards, so as to maximize their participation, increase their productivity, and improve service and products quality. This paper was based on a seminar delivered by Heitor Quintella and Edward Lawler at IBM Brazil. The speakers have decided to apply to Brazilian organizations part of a questionnaire adopted in the organizations surveyed by Lawler. This study gave birth to a master’s degree thesis at the Universidade Federal Fluminense, Estado do Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, presented by ÉRIKA LORANDES within the scope of the Human and Technological Factors for Competitiveness Project (0) developed at the <b>Production</b> <b>Engineering</b> <b>Department,</b> headed by Dr. Heitor Quintella.

40|$|Appropriate {{managerial}} efforts {{prior to}} and after adoption of New Manufacturing Technology (NMT) are the key requirements for successful NMT deployment. In this study, we identify factors related {{to the success of}} NMT deployment. After reviewing the literature, we developed interview protocol and used it to interview twenty managers of ten automotive manufactures. The managers are working in quality and <b>production</b> <b>engineering</b> <b>departments</b> of the first-tier suppliers of two major automobile assemblers. Fifty items were identified through the interview process representing the perspective of the mangers toward factors for successful NMT deployment. Finally, we asked ten experts to classify of those fifty items into four categories of the model of Quality Management System. The four categories are management responsibility, resource management, process and/or product realization, and measurement, analysis and improvement. The experts were chosen from academia, industry, registrar of ISO/QS 9000, and NMT system vendor. We found that fourteen of fifty items can be classified into the four categories with hundred per cent of consensus rate from experts. The results imply that one could use the concept of Quality System Management to enhance the success of NMT deployment...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the {{factors contributing to}} innovative activity in the Canadian food processing sector. The study first focuses {{on the importance of}} research and development activity and advanced business practices used by <b>production</b> and <b>engineering</b> <b>departments.</b> Second, it {{examines the}} extent to which larger firm size and less competition serve to stimulate competition-the so-called Schumpeterian hypothesis. Third, the effect of the nationality of a firm on innovation is investigated. Finally, industry effects are examined. The paper finds that business practices are significantly related to the probability that a firm is innovative. This is also the case for R&D. Size effects are significant, particularly for process innovations. Elsewhere, their effect is greatly diminished once business practices are included. Foreign ownership is significant only for process innovations and not for product innovations. Competition matters, more so for product than for process innovations. Establishments in the 'other' food products industry tend to lead when it comes to innovation, whereas fish product plants tend to lag.

40|$|ABSTRACT – The {{ubiquitous}} {{technology could}} be applied to real-time data exchange among diverse enterprise-wide IT solutions in automotive companies, such as ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning), MES (Manufacturing Execution System), QIS (Quality Information System) and PLM (Product Lifecycle Management). It allows a direct and real time link between the physical product and its related information, and the field data in production shops can be collected and synchronized through wireless devices including RFID (Radio Frequency Identification), Auto-ID sensors and USN (ubiquitous sensor network). This paper shows possibilities of applying Ubiquitous Technologies to manufacturing engineering in PLM of an Automotive Die Shop. By real-time information sharing between <b>production</b> shops and <b>engineering</b> <b>departments,</b> we can improve preciseness and responsiveness of engineering from design to production of automotive dies...|$|R
50|$|Sales {{engineers}} also {{collaborate with}} the design, <b>production,</b> <b>engineering,</b> or R&D <b>departments</b> of their companies {{to determine how}} products and services could be made or modified to suit customers' needs. This aspect of sales engineering is important, because it is what allows the sales engineer {{to feel that they}} can maintain their personal integrity (ethically speaking) {{in the face of the}} inherent COI of the job (explained earlier). The sales engineer does not have to lie (ignore or negatively misrepresent the competitor's products or services) if they can reasonably tell the customer that their employer can tailor its solutions to the customer's particular requirements. Doing that may not be easy or cheap, which means that there is always a line to be walked to avoid overpromising-and/or-underdelivering.|$|R
