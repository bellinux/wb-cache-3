40|$|The present {{investigation}} is focused to generate chicken Egg yolk antibodies against Salmonella pullorum and their in-vitro characterization. <b>Pullorum</b> <b>disease</b> is {{leading cause of}} morbidity and mortality in poultry and highly responsible for significant economic loss. Mortality in such outbreaks may approach 90 % if untreated. Treatment primarily is a salvage operation and does not prevent from becoming a carrier. Therefore, the prevention of this disease in breeder level through vaccination is more convenient for the control of vertical transmission. One of the recent researches has revealed that the combination of IBDV vaccine and chicken IgY generated against IBDV was superior in preventing IBDV infection in Broiler chickens rather than using them alone. Based on this recent finding, the chicken egg yolk antibody (IgY) raised against Salmonella pullorum. IgY antibodies were purified by (Polson et al., 1980) method and Water dilution method followed by DEAE cellulose ion exchange column chromatography. The total IgY concentration was relatively constant, average IgY concentration was 6. 62 mg/mL during the immunization period.

Moreover, we found that the p 38 MAPK signaling pathway was essential for Bfr-induced IFN-β expression.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Salmonella Gallinarum (S. Gallinarum) and Salmonella Pullorum (S. Pullorum) are poultry host-specific, {{agents of}} fowl typhoid and <b>pullorum</b> <b>disease,</b> respectively. These biovars cause septicemic infections, {{resulting}} in high mortality. Outbreaks are frequently reported worldwide, causing losses {{due to the}} elimination of infected flocks and treatments. The use of antimicrobial agents is frequent in poultry farms to prevent or treat gastrointestinal infections. In the present research it was evaluated the antimicrobial susceptibility of 50 S. Gallinarum and S. Pullorum isolates, from outbreaks that occurred between 1987 to 1991 and 2006 to 2013. The comparison of the susceptibility profiles showed that all isolates were susceptible to β-lactams. All isolates from 1987 - 1991 were susceptible to all antibiotics tested except NAL and CIP (78 %). The susceptibility profile of S. Gallinarum (2006 - 2013 period) was the following NAL (58 %), CIP (63 %), ENR (67 %), TET (92 %), FFC (96 %) and SXT (96 %). S. Pullorum isolates (2006 - 2013 period) showed the following susceptibility rates to NAL (65 %), CIP (71 %), ENR (94 %) and TET (94 %). All isolates were susceptible to β-lactams tested, however, resistance to quinolones and fluoroquinolones increased over time. Furthermore, low levels of resistance to other antibiotics were found in recent isolates, such as tetracyclines...|$|E
40|$|Fresh and {{processed}} poultry have been frequently implicated {{in cases of}} human salmonellosis. Furthermore, increased consumption of meat and poultry has increased the potential for exposure to Salmonella enterica. While advances {{have been made in}} reducing the prevalence and frequency of Salmonella contamination in processed poultry, there is mounting pressure on commercial growers to prevent and/or eliminate these human pathogens in preharvest production facilities. Several factors contribute to Salmonella colonization in commercial poultry, including the serovar and the infectious dose. In the early 1900 s, Salmonella enterica serovars Pullorum and Gallinarum caused widespread diseases in poultry, but vaccination and other voluntary programs helped eradicate <b>pullorum</b> <b>disease</b> and fowl typhoid from commercial flocks. However, the niche created by the eradication of these serovars was likely filled by S. Enteritidis, which proliferated in the bird populations. While this pathogen remains a significant problem in commercial egg and poultry production, its prevalence among poultry has been declining since the 1990 s. Coinciding with the decrease of S. Enteritidis, S. Heidelberg and S. Kentucky have emerged as the predominant serovars in commercial broilers. In this review, we have highlighted bacterial genetic and host-related factors that may contribute to such shifts in Salmonella populations in commercial poultry and intervention strategies that could limit their colonization...|$|E
40|$|A {{bacteriological}} {{study of}} Salmonella Gallinarum/Pullorum {{was conducted in}} in-tensively managed chickens in Hawassa, Ethiopia between November 2008 and May 2009. The objectives {{of the study were}} to estimate the bacteriological preva-lence of S. Gallinarum/Pullorum in apparently healthy chickens and to assess the proportional morbidity/mortality from S. Gallinarum/Pullorum in sick/dead chick-ens. Cloacal swabs were collected from a total of 380 randomly selected chickens from 3 poultry farms to estimate the prevalence, whereas necropsy samples of liver, spleen and ceca were collected from 31 sick/dead chickens to estimate the proportional morbidity/mortality. The prevalence of Salmonella infection (S. Gal-linaum/Pullorum) was 0. 8 % (3 / 380), while isolation was possible from 16. 1 % (5 / 31) sick/dead chickens. Only S. Gallinarum was isolated from cloacal swabs. Of the 6 isolates obtained from necropsy samples 1 was S. Pullorum and the rest 5 S. Galli-narum; and, 3 were from liver, 2 from cecum and 1 from spleen. It is concluded that salmonellosis is prevalent and fowl typhoid and <b>pullorum</b> <b>disease</b> have significant role in morbidity and mortality of intensively managed chickens in Hawassa. This result may indicate the challenge that the poultry industry of the country may face from S. Gallinarum/Pullorum in the future in its intensification. Concerted efforts, therefore, should be made at national and local levels to control the diseases...|$|E
