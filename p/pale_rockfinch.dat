50|$|The <b>pale</b> <b>rockfinch</b> or pale {{rock sparrow}} (Carpospiza brachydactyla) {{is a small}} sparrow found in the Middle East and Central Asia. It is {{the only member of}} the genus Carpospiza. Some {{authorities}} include it in the genus Petronia. Others have placed it in the finch family due to some similarities in behaviour and form, but the anatomy of its tongue exhibits characteristic sparrow features.|$|E

50|$|The {{combined}} area of Jabal Aja and Northern Ha'il {{has been}} designated an Important Bird and Biodiversity Area because of its importance as a centre for migratory birds especially the demoiselle crane (Grus virgo). Among the important species resident in the reserve are the sand partridge, griffon vulture, Egyptian vulture, desert owl and <b>pale</b> <b>rockfinch.</b> Among the migratory species that visit the reserve in passage or over-winter here are Menetries's warbler, white-throated robin, Finsch's wheatear, cinereous bunting and several species of cranes.|$|E
50|$|The latter {{four or five}} {{species are}} quite often {{separated}} in a genus Pyrgilauda, based on different vocalizations and ecological preferences. Similarly, the white-rumped snowfinch is occasionally placed in a monotypic genus Onychostruthus. But the evidence is equivocal; though the proposed three lineages of snowfinches seem indeed to be distinct (and can be split), {{it is not at}} all certain that the snowfinches are not a monophyletic group (where splitting would become necessary). Thus, without conclusive evidence that Montifringilla sensu lato is paraphyletic with its closest relatives - the petronias (or rock sparrows, Petronia) and the <b>pale</b> <b>rockfinch</b> (Carpospiza brachydactyla) -, Onychostruthus and Pyrgilauda are usually lumped with Montifringilla to avoid maintaining three small or monotypic genera.|$|E

50|$|The family Passeridae was {{introduced}} (as Passernia) by the French polymath Constantine Samuel Rafinesque in 1815. Under the classification {{used in the}} Handbook of the Birds of the World (HBW) main groupings of the sparrows are the true sparrows (genus Passer), the snowfinches (typically one genus, Montifringilla), and the rock sparrows (Petronia and the <b>pale</b> <b>rockfinch).</b> These groups are similar to each other, and are each fairly homogeneous, especially Passer. Some classifications also include the sparrow-weavers (Plocepasser) and several other African genera (otherwise classified among the weavers, Ploceidae) which are morphologically similar to Passer. According to a study of molecular and skeletal evidence by Jon Fjelds√• and colleagues, the cinnamon ibon of the Philippines, previously {{considered to be a}} white-eye, is a sister taxon to the sparrows as defined by the HBW. They therefore classify it as its own subfamily within Passeridae.|$|E
