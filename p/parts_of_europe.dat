30|$|Borehole heat {{exchanger}} technology {{is growing in}} Europe, and its applications are present {{as well in the}} southern <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>Europe,</b> namely in Spain and Italy. In contrast to the northern <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>Europe</b> (for example, the Scandinavian regions), the typical shallow ground in the southern <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>Europe</b> is not made of rocks (granite, basalt), but it is composed mainly of loose materials (sand, clay, marl, etc.). This fact complicates the application because of drilling issues, the reduced homogeneity of the soil, and lower thermal conductivity.|$|R

Since all native sundews species are protected in many <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>Europe</b> and North America, extracts are usually prepared using cultivated fast-growing sundews (specifically D. rotundifolia, D. intermedia, D. anglica, D. ramentacea and D. madagascariensis) or from plants collected and imported from Madagascar, Spain, France, Finland and the Baltics.|$|E

5|$|Benzylpiperazine (BZP) is a {{recreational}} drug with euphoriant and stimulant properties. The effects produced by BZP {{are comparable to}} those produced by amphetamine. Adverse effects have been reported following its use including acute psychosis, renal toxicity and seizures. No deaths have been reported following a sole ingestion of BZP, {{although there have been}} at least two deaths from the combination of BZP and MDMA.

5|$|Cacti {{are often}} grown in greenhouses, {{particularly}} in regions unsuited to {{the cultivation of}} cacti outdoors, such the northern <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>Europe</b> and North America. Here, they may be kept in pots or grown in the ground. Cacti are also grown as houseplants, many being tolerant of the often dry atmosphere. Cacti in pots may be placed outside in the summer to ornament gardens or patios, and then kept under cover during the winter. Less drought-resistant epiphytes, such as epiphyllum hybrids, Schlumbergera (the Thanksgiving or Christmas cactus) and Hatiora (the Easter cactus), are widely cultivated as houseplants.|$|E

5|$|In 1907, Australian swimmer and {{performer}} Annette Kellerman {{was arrested}} on a Boston beach for wearing form-fitting sleeveless one-piece knitted swimming tights that covered her from neck to toe, a costume she adopted from England, although it became accepted swimsuit attire for women in <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>Europe</b> by 1910.

5|$|The {{demographic}} decline due to {{the plague}} had economic consequences: the prices of food dropped and land values declined by 30 to 40% in most <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>Europe</b> between 1350 and 1400.

Amanita muscaria is noted for its hallucinogenic properties, with its main psychoactive constituent being the compound muscimol.

There has been much speculation on possible traditional use of this mushroom as an intoxicant in other places such as the Middle East, Eurasia, North America, and Scandinavia.|$|E
5|$|By contrast, the {{remainder}} of Europe saw stone towers being used in castles, {{but not in a}} way that fulfilled the range of functions seen in the western European keeps. In the Low Countries, it became popular for the local nobility to build stand-alone, square towers, but rarely as part of a wider castle. Similarly, square stone towers became popular in Venice, but these did not fulfil the same role as western keeps. In Germany, rectangular stone castles began to replace motte-and-bailey castles from the 12th century onwards. These designs included stone versions of the traditional Bergfriede, which still remained distinct from the domestic keeps used in more western <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>Europe,</b> with the occasional notable exception, such as the large, residential Bergfried at Eltville Castle.|$|E
