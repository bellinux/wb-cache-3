25|$|Frank Jackson {{formulated}} his well-known knowledge argument {{based upon}} similar considerations. In this thought experiment, known as Mary's room, he {{asks us to}} consider a neuroscientist, Mary, who was born, and has lived all of her life, in {{a black and white}} room with a black and white television and computer monitor where she collects all the scientific data she <b>possibly</b> <b>can</b> on the nature of colours. Jackson asserts that as soon as Mary leaves the room, she will come to have new knowledge which she did not possess before: the knowledge of the experience of colours (i.e., what they are like). Although Mary knows {{everything there is to know}} about colours from an objective, third-person perspective, she has never known, according to Jackson, what it was like to see red, orange, or green. If Mary really learns something new, it must be knowledge of something non-physical, since she already knew everything about the physical aspects of colour.|$|E

[...] In June he entered a controversy when Peter Martyr, another refugee who had taken the equivalent Regius Professor position at Oxford University, debated with Catholic colleagues {{over the issue of}} the Lord's Supper. Martyr asked Bucer for his support, but Bucer did not totally agree with Martyr's position and thought that exposure of differences would not assist the cause of reform. Unwilling to see the eucharist conflict repeat itself in England, he told Martyr he did not take sides, Catholic, Lutheran, or Zwinglian. He said, [...] "We must aspire with the utmost zeal to edify as many people as we <b>possibly</b> <b>can</b> in faith and in the love of Christ—and to offend no one." ...|$|E

[...] "I obviously have to reach out to all sides", he said. [...] "For the longest time, I personally tried to watch as many episodes of all the shows as I could to get sense of each show, and what each guy does. I don't just pick one and stick with that guy." [...] Carter researched the impact of financial decision-making on the controversy. He said he had known Leno for a long time, and O'Brien since he began working for NBC, and that these connections gave him the benefit of familiarity.|$|E

However, upon the game's 2008 release, Thompson called Grand Theft Auto IV [...] "the gravest assault upon children in this country since polio," [...] and asked Minnesota Governor Tim Pawlenty to [...] "pursue and file criminal charges against [...] Target and Best Buy". He also {{sent a letter to}} Take-Two chairman Strauss Zelnick's attorney, addressed to Zelnick's mother, in which Thompson accused her son of [...] "doing everything he <b>possibly</b> <b>can</b> to sell as many copies of GTA: IV to teen boys in the United States, a country in which your son claims you raised him to be a 'a Boy Scout'. ... More like the Hitler Youth, I would say." [...] On May 1, 2008 Thompson appeared on the CNN Headline News program Glenn Beck, asserting that the game's sexual content made its sale to minors illegal, and that he was working with law enforcement to have criminal prosecutions brought. Thompson also {{filed a complaint with the}} Chicago Transit Authority about poster ads for the game at Chicago, Illinois bus stops.|$|E

By connecting with his associates, Ryan states, it's [...] "valuable {{when it comes to}} figuring out how to motivate somebody (...) because I want that guy to fight for me, just like I want to fight for him." [...] Fullback Tony Richardson, in an interview, stated Ryan [...] "loves his football team, loves his players" [...] and does as much as he <b>possibly</b> <b>can</b> to ensure their success. Despite his boisterous and brash comments that have caused increased media coverage of the team, Ryan has taken the attention and has managed to [...] " [...] it on himself" [...] so the players can focus on their tasks. Ryan has also stressed that the teaching process is an important one, {{particularly when it comes to}} providing a player information and building chemistry. However, there has to be flexibility as the process must also be insightful and positive. Ryan states that coaches are responsible for providing players with information that is vitally important otherwise [...] "if you emphasize everything, you've emphasized nothing." ...|$|E
500|$|She starred as a femme fatale in {{her first}} film of 2011, Vishal Bhardwaj's black comedy 7 Khoon Maaf. Based on the short story [...] "Susanna's Seven Husbands" [...] by Ruskin Bond, [...] 7 Khoon Maaf centres on Susanna Anna-Marie Johannes, an Anglo-Indian woman (played by Chopra) who murders her seven husbands in an unending quest for love. The film and her {{performance}} received acclaim from critics. Nikhat Kazmi remarked, [...] "7 Khoon Maaf would undoubtedly end up as a milestone in Priyanka Chopra's career graph. The actor displays exquisite command over a complex character that is definitely a first in Indian cinema." [...] Aniruddha Guha of Daily News and Analysis wrote: [...] "Priyanka Chopra takes on a character that most of her contemporaries would shy away from and enacts {{it in a way}} that only she <b>possibly</b> <b>can.</b> For a woman with as many shades as Susanna, Chopra gets a crack at a role of a lifetime and she sparkles like never before." [...] Chopra's performance earned her the Filmfare Critics Award for Best Actress and a nomination for the Filmfare Award, IIFA Award, Producers Guild Film Award, and Screen Award for Best Actress.|$|E
500|$|Spotnitz wanted [...] "Deadalive" [...] {{to open in}} a {{way that}} would shock viewers and make them watch the entire episode. He {{concluded}} that the best way to do this was to show Mulder's funeral. He felt that [...] "the death of the hero [...] was shocking enough", but that no one expected [...] "Deadalive" [...] to blatantly open with a funeral. He elaborated, [...] "But here we are actually burying the man ... just pushing something as far as you <b>possibly</b> <b>can</b> because the audience can't quite believe you're doing it." [...] The funeral was expensive to film; several actors, such as Sheila Larken, who played Scully's mother, needed to be flown in specifically for the scene. Spotnitz later said, [...] "It's a lot of money to spend but, you know, you just couldn't really do Mulder's funeral without having them there, so we did all that." [...] Despite the fact that the show was filmed in California and under [...] "huge financial pressure", real snow was used for foreground shots and the background was painted white in post-production. Spotnitz later called the sequence [...] "a fun scene to write and stage" [...] and [...] "a great tease".|$|E

500|$|York {{recorded}} {{their first}} victory since early September 2014 after winning 1–0 away against Cheltenham Town, De Girolamo scoring from a Coulson {{pass in the}} 43rd minute. De Girolamo was recalled early from his loan spell by Sheffield United as they wanted him for their two upcoming cup fixtures, after he had scored three times in four York matches. Bournemouth's Guadeloupe international defender Stéphane Zubar joined on loan until 4 January 2015, with Parslow being loaned back to Grimsby until the same date. York drew 1–1 {{at home with their}} divisional rivals AFC Wimbledon {{in the first round of}} the FA Cup; Hyde gave York the lead in the eighth minute after scoring from Coulson's low cross, before Andy Frampton equalised for the away team on 22 minutes. Burton was ruled out for two to three months with a medial ligament injury suffered in this match, resulting in his loan at the club being curtailed. York signed 19-year-old Middlesbrough defender Brad Halliday on a one-month loan as cover and competition for McCoy. Fellow strugglers Oxford United won 1–0 at York, James Roberts scoring from threeyards after Danny Hylton flicked on a Brian Howard corner in the 35th minute, and Wilcox surmised the result saying [...] "The lads are working as hard as they <b>possibly</b> <b>can</b> but I'm just looking for a little bit more now".|$|E
500|$|Michael Manley {{described}} Roach as [...] "swashbuckling", playing risky but attractive shots outside off stump. He {{could play}} with equal ability {{from either the}} front foot—with his weight going forward into a batting shot—or back foot. George John, his former coach, believed {{that he was more}} effective on the back foot, and sometimes failed to move his feet when batting, but that his ability to deflect the ball by the movements of his wrist was unsurpassed in the whole world. John also suggested that Roach might struggle to play one delivery but then hit the next for six. The writer C. L. R. James described how he attacked the short ball outside off stump: [...] " [...] his right foot back and across as far as it will go, and then let him lift his bat as high as he <b>possibly</b> <b>can</b> and from that position let it go like a piston at the unfortunate ball." [...] The resulting stroke left little chance for the fielders." [...] From this description, the journalist Frank Keating suggested a playing resemblance to Gordon Greenidge. On another occasion, James described Roach as [...] "an untalkative but cheerful soul." [...] Roach's form may have been affected by his lack of a regular partner to open the batting; he frequently had different partners from one Test to the next. He was a very effective fielder, especially in the covers.|$|E
500|$|... 7 Khoon Maaf {{released}} to universal critical acclaim and Chopra's performance was singled out in particular, with many reviewers describing it as [...] "a {{role of a}} lifetime". Aniruddha Guha of the Daily News and Analysis rated the film a four (out of five) and wrote, [...] "For a filmmaker who has long established his hold over the craft, 7 Khoon Maaf {{is the only way}} forward – it pushes the envelope and takes you on a cinematic journey you may not experience in a Hindi film {{for a long time to}} come". She praised Chopra's performance: [...] "Priyanka Chopra takes on a character that most of her contemporaries would shy away from and enacts it in a way that only she <b>possibly</b> <b>can.</b> For a woman with as many shades as Susanna, Chopra gets a crack at a role of a lifetime. And Bhardwaj ensures she sparkles like never before". The Indo-Asian News Service described the film as a [...] "winner" [...] by Vishal Bhardwaj, rating it four out of five: [...] "Chalk up an absolute winner for the Vishal Bhardwaj-Priyanka Chopra team. They make a coherent vision out of an inconceivable marital crises." [...] Zee News also rated the film four out of five: [...] "Vishal Bhardwaj does it again. The maverick filmmaker has once again woven magic with his latest blockbuster Saat Khoon Maaf, which presents Priyanka Chopra in a never before character".|$|E
