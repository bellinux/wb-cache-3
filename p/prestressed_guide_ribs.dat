A common way to cool blade tips is to design serpentine passages with 180 degrees turn with the blade-tip walls inside the turbine blades. Improved internal convective cooling is therefore required to increase blade-tip lifetime. This chapter summarizes the heat transfer enhancement of an internal blade-tip wall having pins, dimples and protrusions, {{and the influence of}} <b>guide</b> <b>ribs</b> and pins material. It is found that the pinned tip exhibits best performance to improve the blade-tip cooling.

5000|$|Typically, {{the bolt}} {{consists}} of a tube of metal inside of which the firing mechanism is housed, and which has at the front or rear of the tube several metal knobs, or [...] "lugs", which serve to lock the bolt in place. The operation can be done via a rotating bolt, a lever, cam-action, locking piece, or a number of systems. Straight-pull designs have seen {{a great deal of}} use, though manual turn-bolt designs are what is most commonly thought of in reference to a bolt-action design due to the type ubiquity. As a result, the bolt-action term is often reserved for more modern types of rotating bolt-designs when talking about a specific weapon's type of action. However, both straight-pull and rotating bolt rifles are types of bolt-action rifles. Lever-action and pump-action weapons must still operate the bolt, but they are usually grouped separately from bolt-actions that are operated by a handle directly attached to a rotating bolt. Early bolt-action designs, such as the Dreyse needle gun and the Mauser Model 1871, locked by dropping the bolt handle or bolt <b>guide</b> <b>rib</b> into a notch in the receiver, this method is still used in [...]22 rimfire rifles. The most common locking method is a rotating bolt with two lugs on the bolt head, which was used by the Lebel Model 1886 rifle, Model 1888 Commission Rifle, Mauser M 98, Mosin-Nagant and most bolt-action rifles. The Lee-Enfield has a lug and <b>guide</b> <b>rib,</b> which lock on the rear end of the bolt into the receiver.|$|R

50|$|The A-Bolt rifle is a bolt-action rifle. It uses a {{non-rotating}} bolt sleeve (partial sleeve {{on first}} generation A-bolt rifles).

These three locking lugs also greatly increase bolt strength. The bolt's smoothness is also increased with a unique cartridge depressor; the cartridge depressor stays in place independent of the bolt's position. Near the end of the reloading cycle, when the bolt is re-inserted, the bolt moves gently over the cartridges in the magazine. The barrel is free-floating and the recoil lug is glass bedded.|$|R

Here, a numerical model is set up to expound experimental tests on a prestressed plate {{in the light of}} acoustoelasticity and in view of the formulation of an inverse problem, in which response is measured and stress is identified. The theory of acoustoelasticity is used to describe wave propagation in a <b>prestressed</b> <b>guided</b> wave, accounting for selected sources of nonlinearities. In particular, finite strains are used, and energy is written as a third-order function of the strains. The experiments are performed on a rectangular plate held by a machine, inducing prestress in the plate and applying in-plane impulsive loadings by an instrumented hammer. The time histories of both loading and dynamic response are recorded and the variation of the relevant dynamic response quantities are investigated. The aim of the experimental tests is to observe the transmission of waves in the plate, relating the prestress to the variation of the propagation speed of waves. © 2013 Taylor & Francis Group, London, UK...|$|R

40|$|Biochemical {{analysis}} for medical diagnostics is normally {{carried out by}} trained operators in sophisticated laboratories using large instruments. These techniques are out of reach to many people living in remote areas or are too slow for critically ill patients who need urgent care. A rapid, automated, compact, low cost and disposable integrated lab on a chip device which can be operated by a minimally trained person is required {{not only for the}} detection and diagnosis of the diseases, but also for water, food and environmental safety. Optical waveguide devices allow integration of various optoelectronic and microfluidic components to help in realizing sensing of liquid analytes and require 3 - 6 orders less sample volume compared with many conventional medical tests. The mid-infrared (mid-IR) spectral window covering wavelengths from 2 to 14 µm is ideal for biochemical analysis due to the fundamental fingerprint molecular absorption, and waveguide evanescent field based spectroscopy can potentially offer rapid high sensitivity, real-time measurement of complex mixtures to identify and quantify species in clinical samples for point of care diagnosis without any biomarkers. To realize such devices, mid-IR transparent chalcogenide materials are used to fabricate optical waveguides. In our previous work, we have demonstrated waveguiding in the mid-IR region using germanium telluride (GeTe 4) waveguide cores on zinc selenide (ZnSe) substrates [1]. In this work, ZnSe rib waveguides were fabricated on oxidized silicon with the dimensions shown in Fig 1 (a). ZnSe films were deposited by thermal evaporation and the ribs were fabricated using photolithography and Ar + ion-beam etching. Light from a tunable optical parametric oscillator (M-squared) operating between 2. 5 - 3. 7 µm wavelengths was butt-coupled into the waveguide using a single mode ZrF 4 fibre (core diameter ~ 9 µm) and the waveguide output was collected using a multimode InF 3 fibre (core diameter ~ 100 µm), directed onto a TE cooled Mercury Cadmium Telluride detector (MCT, Vigo System) and recorded on a computer. After optimizing coupling into the waveguide by imaging the waveguide output using a mid-IR camera from above, as shown in Fig 1 (b), two spectral scans were recorded, one of the output power from the waveguide alone and the other with a 10 µL DI water droplet on the waveguide surface of length ~ 0. 6 cm shown in Fig 1 (c) inset. The ratio, representing the waveguide absorption spectrum of water, is plotted in Fig 1 (c) (black points) and compared with a numerical model of the water-coated waveguide (blue line) using the published complex refractive index of water [2], for a waveguide length of 0. 6 cm. These preliminary experimental results are in good agreement with the theoretical results. The elevated transmission in the absorption band is due to substrate radiation and the transmission above unity is due to reduction in waveguide scattering loss with the water cladding. Future work will study the absorption spectra of clinically relevant analytes.

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation is}} carried out to study the effect of several turn treatments like single guide vane (short and long) and multiple guide vanes on the pressure drop distribution in smooth and rib roughened square channels with a sharp 180 ° bend. The sharp 180 ° turn is obtained by dividing a rectangular passage into two square channels using a divider wall with a rounded tip at the location where the flow negotiates the turn. In rib roughened channels, ribs are configured {{on the top and}} bottom surfaces in a symmetric arrangement with an angle of 90 ° to the mainstream flow. Rib height-to-hydraulic diameter ratio (e/D) is maintained constant at 0. 14 with a constant pitch-to-rib height ratio (P/e) of 10. The pressure drop distribution normalized with the mainstream fluid dynamic pressure head is presented for the outer surfaces. Results suggest that 90 ° multiple guide vanes result in the decrease of overall pressure drop by around 40 % in smooth square channels. However, a reduction in overall pressure drop by only 15 % is achievable through <b>guide</b> vanes in <b>rib</b> roughened square channels...|$|R
40|$|To {{determine}} {{the feasibility of}} coupling the output of a single-mode optical fiber into a single-mode rib waveguide in a temperature varying environment, a theoretical calculation of the coupling efficiency between the two was investigated. Due to the complex geometry of the <b>rib</b> <b>guide,</b> there is no analytical solution to the wave equation for the guided modes, thus, approximation and/or numerical techniques must be utilized to {{determine the}} field patterns of the guide. In this study, three solution methods were used for both the fiber and guide fields; the effective-index method (EIM), Marcatili's approximation, and a Fourier method. These methods were utilized independently to calculate the electric field profile of each component at two temperatures, 20 C and 300 C, representing a nominal and high temperature. Using the electric field profile calculated from each method, the theoretical coupling efficiency between an elliptical-core optical fiber and a rib waveguide was calculated using the overlap integral {{and the results were}} compared. It was determined that a high coupling efficiency can be achieved when the two components are aligned. The coupling efficiency was more sensitive to alignment offsets in the y direction than the x, due to the elliptical modal field profile of both components. Changes in the coupling efficiency over temperature were found to be minimal...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: Primary {{spontaneous}} pneumothorax {{has long been}} explained as being without apparent cause. This paper deals with the effect of chest wall shape and explains how this {{may lead to the}} pathogenesis of primary {{spontaneous pneumothorax}}. METHODS: Rib cage measurements were taken from chest radiographs in 12 male pneumothorax patients and 12 age-matched controls. Another group of 15 consecutive male thoracic computerised tomography (CT) were investigated using paramedian coronal and sagittal CT reconstructions to assess apical lung shape. A finite element analysis (FEA) model of a lung apex was constructed, including indentations for the first <b>rib</b> <b>guided</b> by CT scan data, to assess pleural stress. This model was tested using different anteroposterior diameter ratios, producing a range of thoracic indexes. RESULTS: The pneumothorax patients had a taller chest (P = 0. 03), wider transversely (P = 0. 009) and flatter (P = 0. 03) when compared with controls, resulting in a low thoracic index. Prominent rib indentations were found anteriorly and posteriorly on the lung surface, especially on the first rib on CT. FEA of the lung revealed significantly higher stress (× 5 -× 10) in the apex than {{in the rest of the}} lung. This was accentuated (× 4) in low thoracic index chests, resulting in 20 -fold higher stress levels in their apex. CONCLUSIONS: The FEA model demonstrates a 20 -fold increase in pleural stress in the apex of chests with low thoracic index typical of spontaneous pneumothorax patients. Mild changes in thoracic index, as occurring in females or with aging, reduce pleural stress. Spontaneous pneumothorax occurring in young male adults may have a biomechanical cause. peer-reviewe...|$|R

Dimension a s 1 mm, P s linear state power level boldnL L. lines; P s 1 mW, P s 0. 8 mW, nonlinear state power levels 1 2 in frequency. When operating at a given frequency the dis-persion nonlinear values may be very {{different from those of the}} linear state, and their correct value must be evaluated starting from a nonlinear model of the structure.

CONCLUSIONS In a standard rib waveguide the change of parameters has not proved to be very effective in the control of the group velocity dispersion; in particular, no negative dispersion may be obtained in the single-mode region. When a depressed. index layer usually called a notch is interposed between the guiding region and the substrate, a negative GVD may be easily obtained; in a <b>rib</b> <b>guide</b> with a proper choice of other parameters as the width of the loading strip a controlled amount of negative GVD may be obtained and the region of single-mode operation may be extended.

40|$|Heat {{transfer}} in gas turbine related applications is investigated by steady state liquid crystal thermography (LCT) in this thesis. The work presented includes {{outlet guide vane}} heat transfer and gas turbine internal cooling. The heat transfer on the outlet guide vane (OGV) surface and its endwall region is investigated experimentally in a linear cascade test facility. The inlet flow angle is varied from + 25 º (on-design), to + 40 º and - 25 º (off-design). The Reynolds numbers tested are 300, 000, and 450, 000. On the OGV surface, boundary layer transition and separation affect the heat transfer significantly and they vary significantly with the inlet flow angle. On the endwall region, {{the effects of a}} horseshoe vortex (HV) on the heat transfer are clearly noticed at the leading edge area. For off-design conditions, the HV becomes more energetic than that of the on-design condition and the pressure side leg departs from the OGV at the inlet flow angle α = - 25 º. Experimental investigation of heat transfer and pressure drop in the turn region of a two-pass channel has been carried out. Results indicate that heat transfer on the smooth outer wall is dominated by the flow impingement. When ribs are fitted onto the outer wall, it is found that the heat transfer patterns are significantly altered. The presence of ribs augments the heat transfer at the penalty of increased pressure loss. Thermal performance is considered to provide optimized rib configurations. By proper application of guide vanes, the pressure loss over the turn region is substantially reduced while the heat transfer is only moderately changed. The combined effect of <b>guide</b> vanes and <b>ribs</b> on the heat transfer is also analyzed. The results can be used to optimize the internal cooling design for gas turbine blade tips. Jet impingement is an effective heat transfer method while the favorable performance is usually degraded by the cross-flow. Experimental measurements were conducted to study the effects of vortex generator pair (VGP) on the jet impingement heat {{transfer in}} cross-flow. The VGP is placed in the cross-flow channel and upstream of the jet exit. The jet Reynolds number is 15, 000 and the cross-flow Reynolds numbers vary from 40, 000 to 64, 000. Results indicate that the VGP with common-flow-up (CFU) configuration promotes the jet penetration in cross-flow and augments the impingement heat transfer greatly on the target wall compared to the baseline case without the VGP. In addition, the parameters affecting the enhancement include the angle of attack of the VGP, the spacing between the VGP, the spacing between the VGP and the jet nozzle, the shape of the VGP, the height of the VGP, and also the cross-flow Reynolds number...|$|R
