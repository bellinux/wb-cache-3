He recruited four young scientists who had been at Los Alamos, including Sands, and two {{who had been in}} the Radiation Laboratory, as Ph.D. candidates. All were more mature than typical graduate students, with several years of wartime research experience. They were paid a stipend similar to that of a <b>postdoctoral</b> <b>researcher,</b> which enabled them to support families during their graduate studies.

50|$|On {{the other}} hand, 85 percent of {{engineering}} doctoral degrees holder {{are likely to}} initially go into business or industry sector. Under the circumstances, providing doctoral {{students as well as}} <b>postdoctoral</b> <b>researchers</b> with necessary skills for nonacademic positions {{has become one of the}} important roles for graduate schools and institutions. The America COMPETES Act recognized the importance of graduate student support for obtaining skills needed when they pursue nonacademic careers, and required National Science Foundation (NSF) to increase or decrease funding for the Integrative Graduate Education and Research Traineeship (IGERT) programs at least at the same rate as it increases or decreases funding for the Graduate Research Fellowship. There are no comprehensive data of international <b>postdoctoral</b> <b>researchers</b> in the US because of the less-organized survey and the difficulty in counting international <b>postdoctoral</b> <b>researchers.</b> The proportion of <b>postdoctoral</b> <b>researchers</b> on temporary visas reached 53.6% in 2010. The life sciences hold the largest percentage of <b>postdoctoral</b> <b>researchers</b> on temporary visas; in 2008, approximately 56% of <b>postdoctoral</b> <b>researchers</b> in the life sciences were temporary residents. Of these <b>postdoctoral</b> <b>researchers</b> on temporary visas, four out of five earned their PhD outside of the United States. While there exists fear that foreign PhD's are taking postdoctoral research positions from American researchers, it is not true. However, the influx of foreign PhD's has influenced the supply of ready-researchers, and thereby, the wages. One estimate claims that a 10% increase in the supply of foreign <b>postdoctoral</b> <b>researchers</b> lower the position salary by 3-4%.|$|R

25|$|Wall {{began work}} as a <b>postdoctoral</b> <b>researcher</b> at University of California-Riverside in 1972 where she began researching the {{function}} and biological diversity of soil ecosystems. In 1976 she began work in the Department of Nematology as an Assistant Research Nematologist. She continued to work at UC-Riverside for a further seventeen years before becoming a Professor in the Department of Nematology. Throughout this period, she was the Associate Director of the Drylands Research Institute for two years the Associate Program Director of the National Science Foundation in Washington, DC for one year.|$|E
25|$|As a <b>postdoctoral</b> <b>researcher</b> at Florida State University, US (1971–1973), Truswell {{participated in}} the first Deep Sea Drilling Program (DSDP) voyages to Antarctica, which still holds {{the record for the}} furthest south of such drilling. This voyage contributed to a new {{understanding}} of the age of the Antarctic ice sheet and the development of an early version of the Antarctic Convergence. Subsequent work on Ocean Drilling Program material led her, along with M.K. Macphail, to decipher an unparalleled pollen record from Prydz Bay, revealing the composition of terrestrial plant communities during the earliest stages of ice-cap formation during the Late Eocene preglacial-glacial transition.|$|E

25|$|As a <b>postdoctoral</b> <b>researcher</b> of {{subatomic}} particles during the 1970s, Jackson studied and conducted research {{at a number}} of physics laboratories in both the United States and Europe. Her first position was as a research associate at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory in Batavia, Illinois (known as Fermilab) where she studied hadrons. In 1974 she became a visiting scientist at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) in Switzerland. There she explored theories of strongly interacting elementary particles. In 1976 and 1977, she both lectured in physics at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center and became a visiting scientist at the Aspen Center for Physics.|$|E

Domokos is an {{engineer}} and {{is the head of}} Mechanics, Materials and Structures at Budapest University of Technology and Economics. Since 2004, he has been the youngest member of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences. Várkonyi was trained as an architect; he was a student of Domokos and a silver medalist at the International Physics Olympiad in 1997. After staying as a <b>postdoctoral</b> <b>researcher</b> at Princeton University in 2006–2007, he assumed an assistant professor position at Budapest University of Technology and Economics. Domokos had previously been working on mono-monostatic bodies. In 1995 he met Arnold at a major mathematics conference in Hamburg, where Arnold presented a plenary talk illustrating that most geometrical problems have four solutions or extremal points. In a personal discussion, however, Arnold questioned that four is a requirement for mono-monostatic bodies and encouraged Domokos to seek examples with fewer equilibria.|$|E

2500|$|A {{study in}} 2014—published in Science— led by <b>postdoctoral</b> <b>researcher</b> Paul Robertson {{concluded}} that Gliese 581d is [...] "an artifact of stellar activity which, when incompletely corrected, causes the false detection of planet g." [...] "They were very high value targets {{if they were}} real," [...] Robertson said, [...] "But unfortunately {{we found out that}} they weren't." [...] It was pointed out—during a press release by Penn State University—that sunspots could sometimes masquerade as planetary signals. An additional study concluded that Gliese 581g's existence depends on Gliese 581d's eccentricity. The planet was later delisted from the Habitable Exoplanets Catalog, which is run by the University of Puerto Rico at Arecibo. Later, in October that year, Abel Mendez wrote—in a blog post characterizing [...] "false starts" [...] in exoplanet habitability— that the planet does not exist.|$|E
50|$|Postdoctoral {{research}} {{may be required}} for obtaining a tenure-track faculty position, especially at research-oriented institutions.

In fact, the small supply of the professional positions in academia compared to {{the growing number of}} <b>postdoctoral</b> <b>researchers</b> makes it difficult to find tenure-track positions. In 2008, the proportion of <b>postdoctoral</b> <b>researchers</b> who got a tenure or tenure-track within 5 years after they received a doctoral degree was about 39%; nearly 10% of <b>postdoctoral</b> <b>researchers</b> were still waiting for tenure-track positions over 40 in 2003.|$|R

During this time, he was an author on papers regarding the coupling of superconducting qubits via a cavity bus and the coherent interaction of a single photon to a Cooper-pair box, among others. In 2004 he was appointed as an associate research scientist in the Department of Applied Physics at Yale and in June 2005 he was elected as a tenure-track assistant professor at ETH Zürich. Following the professorship appointment, he departed from Yale and started the Quantum Device Lab at ETH Zürich in January 2006, encouraged by the freedom of research afforded to him by the university. In 2011, he was chosen from among 380 ETH Zürich professors to be awarded the [...] Prize for his research activities.

2500|$|Thomas {{was born}} in New Iberia, Louisiana, the son of Mary (Eaton) and William Marco Thomas. The {{grandson}} of a slave, he attended Pearl High School in Nashville in the 1920s. Thomas had hoped to attend college and become a doctor, but the Great Depression derailed his plans. He worked at Vanderbilt University {{in the summer of}} 1929 doing carpentry but was laid off in the fall. In that same year, Thomas enrolled in the Tennessee Agricultural and Industrial College as a premedical student. [...] In the wake of the stock market crash in October, Thomas put his educational plans on hold, and, through a friend, in February 1930 secured a job as surgical research technician with Dr. Alfred Blalock at Vanderbilt University. On his first day of work, Thomas assisted Blalock with a surgical experiment on a dog. At the end of Thomas's first day, Blalock told Thomas they would do another experiment the next morning. Blalock told Thomas to [...] "come in and put the animal to sleep and get it set up". Within a few weeks, Thomas was starting surgery on his own. Thomas was classified and paid as a janitor, despite the fact that by the mid-1930s, he was doing the work of a <b>Postdoctoral</b> <b>researcher</b> in the lab.|$|E

2500|$|Urs Schreiber, a <b>postdoctoral</b> <b>researcher</b> at the University of Hamburg, {{noted that}} {{the mention of the}} Foucault {{pendulum}} was at odds with the papers' general tone, since they generally relied upon more [...] "modern terminology". [...] (According to George Johnson, the Foucault pendulum is [...] "an icon of French science that would belong in any good Gallic spoof.") [...] Schreiber identified five central ideas in the Bogdanovs' work—"'result' A" [...] through [...] "'result' E"—which are expressed in the jargon of statistical mechanics, topological field theory and cosmology. One bit of jargon, the Hagedorn temperature, comes from string theory, but as Schreiber notes, the paper does not use this concept in any detail; moreover, since the paper is manifestly not a string theory treatise, [...] "considering the role the Hagedorn temperature plays in string cosmology, this is bordering on self-parody." [...] Schreiber concludes that the fourth [...] "result" [...] (that the spacetime metric [...] "at the initial singularity" [...] must be Riemannian) contradicts the initial assumption of their argument (an FRW cosmology with pseudo-Riemannian metric). The fifth and last [...] "result", Schreiber notes, is an attempt to resolve this contradiction by [...] "invok quantum mechanics".
