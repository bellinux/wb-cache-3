Virochan announces that no gods other than Lord Shri Vishnu may be worshipped, angering Indra. Indra's anger worries Lord Shri Vishnu.|$|E
40|$|Modern {{dentistry}} gives {{possibility to}} rebuild damaged or removed teeth, to correct some patalogical and aesthetical defects and etc. Some procedures request intermediate operations. The usage of temporary bridges prostheses and <b>protective</b> <b>crowns</b> {{are the best}} example of these operations. The products are used for a limited time, but must rise above the crowd in following properties: strength, wear resistance, low absorption of liquids and calorific materials and etc. The main goal of this work is to investigate the maintenance properties of temporary bridges, made of the materials of different manufacturers, by estimating their resistance to the effecting powers within the time of chewing, wear resistance and liquid absorption. The following materials meant for the production of <b>protective</b> <b>crowns</b> were used: GC Unifast LC, STOMA Acryloxide, VOCO Structur 2 SC, 3 M Protemp 3 Garant. The first and the second materials are based on acryloxide, and the other ones are based on composite resin. The strength, absorption and abrasion of temporary bridge prostheses, made of above-mentioned materials, were determined. The studies show that none of them meet all the required indications maximally...|$|R
40|$|In forest {{restoration}} areas in northern Ethiopia, natural regeneration of Olea europaea ssp. euspidata only occurs under pioneer shrubs. To {{assess the impact}} of erosion on the spatial distribution of Olea recruits, secondary dispersal of olive seeds by surface runoff was determined in and near the micro-environment of two important pioneers (Acacia ethaica and Euclea racemosa). We hypothesized that (1) Olea seeds deposited under the <b>protective</b> <b>crowns</b> of shrubs {{are less likely to be}} lost by surface wash than seeds in the bare inter-plant areas and (2) that seeds in the latter are more prone to be translocated by runoff to microsites under shrubs than to open areas. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Chromium copper-diamond-like carbon (Cr:Cu) -DLC {{films were}} {{deposited}} onto silicon and by cathodic arc evaporation process using chromium (Cr) and copper (Cu) target arc sources to provide Cr and Cu in the Me-DLC. Acetylene reactive gases were the carbon source and activated at 180 degrees C at 13 mTorr, and a substrate bias voltage was varied from - 50 V to - 200 V {{to provide the}} (Cr:Cu) -DLC structure. The structure, interface, and chemical bonding state of the produced film were analyzed by transmission electron microscope (TEM), IR Fourier transform (FTIR) spectra, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The {{results showed that the}} Cr-containing a-C:H/Cu coatings exhibited an amorphous layer of DLC:Cr layer and a crystalline layer of Cu multilayer structure. The profiles of sp(3) /sp(2) (XPS) ratios corresponded to the change of microhardness profile by varying the pressure of the negative DC bias voltage. These (Cr:Cu) -DLC coatings are promising materials for soft substrate <b>protective</b> coatings. <b>Crown</b> Copyright (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|The Longyou rock caverns are a {{group of}} large ancient {{underground}} caverns. They were caved manually in pelitic siltstone in the Quxian Formation of Upper Cretaceous. They have the following five characteristics: more than 2000 years old, man-caved, large spanned, near ground surface and medium to hard surrounding rock. They were unearthed by local farmers who were pumping water out of five small pools on a rough-flat ground in 1992. This discovery called the attention of many specialists from China, Japan, Poland, Singapore and USA. One {{of the most interesting}} and challenging questions is why the five caverns have been able to keep their integrity for more than 2000 years. To address this question, this paper presents the engineering geological conditions of the caverns and their adjacent areas. They include the following five conditions: (a) geological setting, (b) hydrogeological conditions, (c) seepage in integrity caverns, (d) fractures in integrity caverns and (e) failed caverns. Based on these investigation results, the paper further examines the potential failures of the integrity caverns and their <b>protective</b> measures. <b>Crown</b> Copyright Â© 2008. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Titanium copper-diamond-like carbon (Ti:Cu) -DLC {{films were}} {{deposited}} onto silicon via cathodic arc evaporation process using titanium (Ti) and copper (Cu) target arc sources to provide Ti and Cu {{in the metal}} containing diamond-like carbon (Me-DLC) film systen. Acetylene reactive gases served as the carbon sources, which were activated at 180 degrees C at 20 mTorr. Varying substrate bias voltages from - 80 to - 250 V were used {{in order to provide}} the (Ti:Cu) -DLC structure. The structure, interface, and mechanical properties of the produced film were analyzed by transmission electron microscope (TEM), IR Fourier transform (FTIR) spectra, and Rockwell C hardness. The process parameters were compared by studying the various mechanical properties of the films, such as microhardness and adhesion. The results showed that the Ti-containing a-C:H/Cu coatings exhibited an amorphous layer of Ti-DLC layer as well as a nanocrystalline layer of Cu multilayer structure. The mechanical properties of the coatings, as determined by Rockwell C indents testing and the ball-on-disc test. varied with the the applied negative DC bias voltage. These (Ti:Cu) -DLC coatings are promising materials for soft substrate <b>protective</b> coatings. <b>Crown</b> Copyright (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
