50|$|<b>Potassium</b> <b>arsenite</b> is an {{inorganic}} salt that exists as an odorless white solid. It is largely {{soluble in water}} and only slightly soluble in alcohol. Solutions of <b>potassium</b> <b>arsenite</b> contain moderate concentrations of hydroxide, and are thus slightly basic. While <b>potassium</b> <b>arsenite</b> is noncombustible, heating it results in its decomposition {{and the formation of}} toxic fumes that include arsine, arsenic oxides, and potassium oxides. <b>Potassium</b> <b>arsenite</b> also reacts with acids to yield toxic arsine gas.|$|E
50|$|<b>Potassium</b> <b>arsenite</b> (KAsO2) is an {{inorganic}} compound {{that exists in}} two forms, potassium meta-arsenite (KAsO2) and potassium ortho-arsenite (K3AsO3). It is composed of arsenite ions (AsO33− or AsO2−) with arsenic always existing in the +3 oxidation state, and potassium existing in the +1 oxidation state. Like many other arsenic containing compounds, <b>potassium</b> <b>arsenite</b> is highly toxic and carcinogenic to humans. <b>Potassium</b> <b>arsenite</b> forms the basis of Fowler’s solution, which was historically used as a medicinal tonic, but due to its toxic nature its use was discontinued. <b>Potassium</b> <b>arsenite</b> is still, however, used as a rodenticide.|$|E
50|$|In {{the eighteenth}} century English {{physician}} Thomas Fowler utilized a <b>potassium</b> <b>arsenite</b> solution called Fowler’s solution to remedy a number of conditions including anemia, rheumatism, psoriasis, eczema, dermatitis, asthma, cholera, and syphilis. Furthermore, in 1865 the potential uses of <b>potassium</b> <b>arsenite</b> expanded as Fowler’s solution {{was used as the}} first chemotherapeutic agent to treat leukemia, however the chemotherapeutic effects were only temporary. Surprisingly enough, this specific use was inspired by potassium arsenite’s role in improving digestion and producing a smoother coat in horses. <b>Potassium</b> <b>arsenite</b> is also a key inorganic component of certain rodenticides, insecticides, and herbicides. Furthermore, its role as an insecticide also made it a great wood preservative; however, the solubility and toxicity made it a potential risk factor for the environment.|$|E
40|$|Cross-resistance between {{cisplatin}} (DDP) and metalloid salts {{in human}} cells was sought {{on the basis}} that mechanisms that mediate metalloid salt cross-resistance in prokaryotes are evolutionarily conserved. Two ovarian and two head and neck carcinoma cell lines selected for DDP resistance were found to be cross-resistant to antimony potassium tartrate, which contains trivalent antimony. The DDP-resistant variant 2008 /A was also cross-resistant to arsenite but not to stibogluconate, which contains pentavalent antimony. A variant selected for resistance to antimony potassium tartrate was cross-resistant to DDP and arsenite. Resistance to antimony <b>potassium</b> tartrate and <b>arsenite</b> was of a similar magnitude (3 - 7 -fold), whereas the level of resistance to DDP was greater (17 -fold), irrespective of whether the cells were selected by exposure to DDP or to antimony potassium tartrate. In the resistant sublines, uptake of [3 H]-dichloro(ethylenediamine) platinum(II) was reduced to 41 - 52 % of control, and a similar deficit was observed in the accumulation of arsenite. We conclude that DDP, antimony <b>potassium</b> tartrate, and <b>arsenite</b> all share a common mechanism of resistance in human cells and that this {{is due in part to}} an accumulation defect...|$|R

Bacteriol. 92 : 1447 – 1452. 1966. —Inheritance of the acriflavine resistance gene by an acriflavine-sensitive strain of Escherichia coli K- 12 resulted in {{a reduction in the}} cellular accumulation of acriflavine and other basic dyes, but had no effect on the accumulation of acid dyes. In both acriflavine-resistant and -sensitive strains, the cooling of cells from 37 to 0 C increased acriflavine accumulation. This increased accumulation was released from the cells after restoration to 37 C. Acriflavine accumulation was increased by carbon shortage and by metabolic disturbance caused by <b>potassium</b> cyanide, <b>arsenite,</b> puromycin, chloramphenicol, 2 -thiouracil, and 8 -azaguanine. The functional relation of acrifiavine accumulation to the acriflavine concentration of the medium suggests that adsorption is involved in the accumulation...|$|R
40|$|Several single {{components}} of mining waste (arsenic, manganese, lead, cadmium) to which humans are exposed at the m area of Villa de la Paz, Mexico, {{are known to}} provoke alterations of striatal dopaminergic parameters. In this study we used an animal model to examine neurochemical changes resulting from exposure to a metal mixue. We used microdialysis to compare in vivo dopamine release from adult rats subchronically exposed to a mining waste by oral route with those from a control group and from a sodium arsenite group (25 mglkg/day). We found that arsenic and m nese do accumulate in rat brain after 2 week of oral exposure. The mining waste group showed significantly decreased basal levels of dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC; 66. 7 ± 7. 53 pglpl) when compared to a control group (113. 7 ± 14. 3 pglpl). Although basal dopamine release rates were comparable among groups, when the system was challenged with a long-stading depolarization through high-potassium perfision, animals exposed to mining waste {{were not able to}} sustain an increaed dopamine release in respone to depolarization (g waste group 5. 5 * 0. 5 pg 4 d versus control group 21. 7 ± 5. 8 pg/pl).

50|$|The {{toxicity}} of <b>potassium</b> <b>arsenite</b> arises from arsenic’s high affinity for sulfhydryl groups. The formation of these arsenite-sulfur bonds impairs the functionality of certain enzymes such as glutathione reductase, glutathione peroxidases, thioredoxin reductase, and thioredoxin peroxidase. These enzymes are all closely {{affiliated with the}} defense of free radicals and the metabolism of pyruvate. Thus, exposure to <b>potassium</b> <b>arsenite</b> and other arsenite containing compounds results {{in the production of}} damaging oxygen free radicals and the arrest of cellular metabolism.|$|E
50|$|Additionally, {{arsenite}} containing compounds {{have also}} been labeled carcinogens. The carcinogenicity of <b>potassium</b> <b>arsenite</b> arises from its ability to inhibit DNA repair and methylation. This impairment of the cellular machinery can lead to cancer because the cells can no longer repair or arrest mutations and a tumor results. All of these conditions exhibit the hazardous nature of <b>potassium</b> <b>arsenite</b> and other arsenite containing compounds. This is evidenced by a LD50 of 14 mg/kg for rats and a TDL of 74 mg/kg for humans.|$|E
50|$|The two unique {{forms of}} <b>potassium</b> <b>arsenite</b> can be {{attributed}} to the different number of oxygen atoms. Potassium meta-arsenite (KAsO2) contains two oxygen atoms one of which is bonded to the arsenic atom via a double bond. Conversely, Potassium ortho-arsenite (K3AsO3) consists of three oxygen atoms all bound to the arsenic atom via single bonds. In each of these cases, arsenic exists in the +3 oxidation state and is known as arsenite, hence the single name referring to two different structures. Additionally, both the meta and ortho forms of <b>potassium</b> <b>arsenite</b> have identical properties.|$|E

40|$|FOR {{many years}} {{roentgen}} therapy {{has been the}} most satisfactory method of treatment of the chronic leukemias. It is generally agreed that life is not materially prolonged by irradiation, but in favorable cases symptomatic and hematologic improvement occurs for variable periods of time. Some patients experience uncomfortable reactions to treatment, others become refractory to irradiation, and occasionally an alarming depression of the red and white blood cells occurs. In the absence of specific forms of therapy for the disease, there is need of other palliative measures which may be used in place of, or in conjunction with, roentgen therapy. Interest in the use of solution of <b>potassium</b> <b>arsenite</b> was revived in 1931 by the reports of Forkner and Scott. 1 ' 2 These authors observed striking symptomatic and hematologic improvement in nine of ten cases of chronic myelogenous leukemia, treated for short periods of time with toxic or subtoxic doses of solution of <b>potassium</b> <b>arsenite</b> (Fowler's solution).

40|$|Abstract- This {{study was}} carried out to analyze the effect of arsenic types on growth and arsenic {{accumulation}} ability of Pteris multifida. Among arsenic pollution sources, Sodium arsenate, Calcium arsenate, Sodium arsenite and <b>Potassium</b> <b>arsenite</b> were treated in horticultural compost contaminated with 500 ㎎·kg- 1. P. multifida was cultivated for 12 weeks. The results of study, Calcium arsenate treatment showed slightly decreased growth of P. multifida. But, growth of P. multifida cultivated in the remaining arsenic treatment was similar to untreated control plot. With only short-term cultivation of 4 weeks, aerial part of P. multifida in Sodium arsenate treatment showed high arsenic accumulation of 2, 289. 5 ㎎·kg- 1 DW. The arsenic accumulation (2, 956. 0 ㎎·kg- 1 DW) was the highest at 12 week. On the other hand, underground part showed the highest arsenic accumulation in <b>Potassium</b> <b>arsenite</b> treatment (2, 470. 2 ㎎·kg- 1 DW) and Calcium arsenate treatment accumulated 1, 060. 7 ㎎·kg- 1 DW of arsenic. Regardless of arsenic types, aerial part of P. multifida was absorbed more than 1000 ㎎·kg- 1 DW of arsenic. And removal of arsenic in soil was also higher.

It is suggested that the human lung cancer observed among arsenic ore smelters and the skin cancer among people exposed therapeutically to Fowler's solution, have, as their common origin, the genotoxic arsenite ion AsO;-.

40|$|The {{toxicity}} of potassium arsenate, {{as measured by}} retardation or inhibition of growth on solid nutrient media, showed wide variation among different fungi but was consistently reduced {{by the addition of}} large amounts of potassium phosphate, with both arsenic-sensitive and arsenic-tolerant fungi. Poria monticola was completely inhibited by 0. 0025 M arsenate but was progressively less inhibited as the phosphate content of the medium increased and grew slowly at 0. 04 M arsenate when 0. 16 M KH 2 PO 4 was added. Cladosporium herbarum showed 36 % reduction in growth at 0. 08 M arsenate in a low-phosphate medium, but when 0. 01 M KH 2 PO 4 was added, arsenate concentrations up to 0. 64 M (at which the medium contains 4. 8 % As) caused no reduction in growth rate. Addition of phosphate also reduced the {{toxicity of}} <b>potassium</b> <b>arsenite</b> but not that of dimethyl sodium arsonate (sodium cacodylate). The counteracting effect of phosphate on arsenate toxicity was found to occur with every one {{of a wide variety of}} microorganisms tested. The author interprets the results as supporting the thesis that the fungitoxicity of arsenate is due to its competitive interference with phosphorus in oxidative phosphorylation and not to a reaction with the —SH groups of essential proteins. The latter mechanism is, however, probably operative with dimethyl sodium arsonate. The practical implications of the counter-inhibition phenomenon in laboratory investigations and standard tests of arsenical fungicides, in biochemical research, and in the commercial use of arsenical biocides are set out...|$|E
40|$|LEUKEMIA was {{established}} as a distinct clinical entity {{in the middle of}} the Nineteenth Century. As Forkner * notes in his monograph a hundred years later, "We know almost nothing about its cause or its specific treatment.,, <b>Potassium</b> <b>arsenite,</b> radiation and benzol were known by 1915 to produce marked clinical remissions in myelocytic leukemia. During the past four years, three additional agents—ethyl carbamate, the amine mustards, and perhaps the antifolic acid compounds—have been reported to effect distinct clinical improvement in the course of the disease. 2 Adequate analyses of the final results of such therapy, in terms of longevity of patients with myelocytic leukemia, are extremely limited and all deal with radiation therapy. 3 ' * • 5 » 6 > 7 » 8 ' 9 ' 10 'u The first and still the best of such presentations is the classic paper published in 1924 by Minot, Buck-man and Isaacs. 3 No satisfactory detailed data are available in the literature regarding final results with the older chemical agents, and insufficient time has elapsed to evaluate the results with the newer agents. The present report summarizes the pertinent statistical data available on the subject of incidence, distribution and fatality of individuals with myelocytic leukemia, in order to provide a foundation for comparisons be-tween previous results achieved in the disease and information that will eventually be available with newer agents. The specific purposes of this communication are as follows: (1) to analyze statistics relative to age of onset, sex, duration of illness and fatality of patients with myelocytic leuke-mia, from clinical records available in three San Francisco hospitals; (2) to compare the data with similar reports available in the medical literature, and (3) to compare the data with mortality statistics compiled by the Bureau of the Census. Emphasis is placed upon the possible changes that may have occurred in these statistics during the past 40 years, and upon the possible role of therapy in such changes.
