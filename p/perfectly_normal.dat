40|$|The last 2 decades, the {{importance}} of the radiocapitellar joint in the elbow function has become more clear and appreciated. Due to its refined anatomy, both mobility and stability of the elbow are insured by this joint. The cylindrical shape of the radial head, with the central depression that fits the round shaped capitellum <b>perfectly</b> in <b>normal</b> circumstances, allows the hinge function of the ulno-humeral joint together with the rotational mobility, that is needed for pro-supination of the forearm. The forearm rotation is further guided by the proximal radio-ulnar joint. Extra stability to this joint is ensured by the annular ligament that surrounds the radial head, strapping it to the lesser sigmoid notch of the ulna. To allow a full range of motion of elbow and forearm, the radiocapitellar and proximal radioulnar need perfect anatomical requirements. The joint surface needs to be intact due to the close contact and the direct force transmission of over 60 % within the elbow joint. On the other hand, radial neck deformities, with interference of the 15 ° angulation, will limit the rotation of the radius around the ulnar diaphysis, which will impact the pro-supination drastically. A good knowledge of both the anatomical and biomechanical properties of the radiocapitellar joint are essential to the orthopaedic surgeon to adequately understand and treat elbow trauma and its consequences in the long term, with accurate and successful decision making, avoiding irreversible failure of the elbow joint. status: publishe...|$|R

It {{can be considered as}} an incomplete, or partial, version of the Least Squares estimator of regression, applicable when high or perfect multicollinearity is present in the predictor variables. The Least Squares estimator is well-known to be an optimal estimator for regression, but only when the error terms are normally distributed.

In this paper a partial version of M-regression estimators will be defined.

40|$|Rationale and Objectives: The aim of {{the study}} is to build cardiac wall motion models to {{characterize}} mechanical dyssynchrony and predict pacing sites for the left ventricle of the heart in cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT). Materials and Methods: Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging data from 20 patients are used, in which half have heart failure problems. We propose two spatio-temporal ventricular motion models to analyze the mechanical dyssynchrony of heart: radial motion series and wall motion series (a time series of radial length or wall thickness change). The hierarchical agglomerative clustering technique is applied to the motion series to find candidate pacing sites. All experiments are performed separately on each ventricular motion model to facilitate performance comparison among models. Results: The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed methods perform as well as we expect. Our techniques not only effectively generate the candidate pacing sites list that can help guide CRT, but also derive clustering results that can distinguish the heart conditions between patients and <b>normals</b> <b>perfectly</b> to help medical diagnosis and prognosis. After comparing the results between two different ventricular motion models, the wall motion series model shows a better performance. Conclusion: In a traditional CRT device deployment, pacing sites are selected without efficient prediction, which runs the risk of suboptimal benefits. Our techniques can extract useful wall motion information from ventricular mechanical dyssynchrony and identify the candidate pacing sites with maximum contraction delay to assist pacemaker implantation in CRT.

40|$| when a {{young man}} makes a {{connection}} between a specific stimuli and a sexual response. A prepubescent boy may get an erection {{the same time he}} platonically admires his teacher’s shiny high heels. Because a woman’s symptoms of sexual arousal are not as obvious as a man’s, the boy is more likely to realize his feeling of desire and eventually associate it with his interest in the shoes. Over time, a fetish is born. Still, why does this connection between an object and an erotic response become permanent in some people but not others? No one knows for sure. Some people may be born with or develop a predisposition toward fetishism, according to kink expert Gates. Take the female looner Lynda, for example; perhaps the olfactory and pleasure centers of her brain are slightly more connected than those in an average brain, wiring her to be highly affected by the smell of balloons. No evidence suggests genetics cause people to develop fetishes, however, according to San Francisco psychotherapist and sex therapist William Henkin. The reasons people obtain fetishes are social, not biological, and they often have to do with a person’s interactions with parents or other caregivers. Henkin, who has worked with people with alternate sex and gender concerns {{for more than two decades}} (although not with any looners), says fetishes tend to develop in people who felt traumatized as young children and may feel some extra need to be in control. Gates agrees people may be socially primed for a fetish in childhood and puberty. Things happen in people’s lives and they notice a particular stimulus works for them – e. g. Shaun’s childhood fascination with balloons. They start to hone in on this stimulus during early masturbation, just as Shaun experienced his first orgasms with a balloon, which is common among looners. A child’s sexual focus may narrow if he or she experiences some type of social isolation or failure: being ostracized, lacking sexual information or sexual play, suffering from an illness or living in a hyper-religious setting. Family situations like these can induce anxiety, isolation and sexual shame. A boy could unknowingly program himself to be turned on by a specific stimulus just because it’s comforting in a stressful situation, Gates says. Experts agree fetishes almost always originate in childhood, but they disagree on the exact age. Henkin thinks they arise before 5, and probably before 3. Vancouver sexologist and clinical counselor Pega Ren thinks boys tend to develop fetishes between 2 and 10, with 5 to 8 being most common. “We’re prime, we’re ripe, we’re ready at that age,” says Ren, who coaches people about their sexuality on her website smartsextalk. com. “We do not become aware of erotic attraction until puberty, but we are aware of sexual curiosity about the same time we learn to read. We’re curious about all sorts of things at that age. It’s when we play doctor. It’s when, ‘you show me yours, I’ll show you mine’. ” Shaun says he had typical childlike interests and favorite toys that were popular with many kids. He carried around a Snoopy doll and later a Scooter character from the Muppets. But somewhere between 4 and 6, he became fascinated by balloons. Shaun remembers blowing them up and, when it was too hard for him, letting his older brother do it. They threw balloons in the family fireplace, watching flames whip them around until the latex burst. Balloons were one of Shaun’s few toys because they were cheap – he grew up in a family poor enough that he didn’t take meals for granted. Shaun remembers innocently playing with balloons; he would sit on them, bat them around and see how big they could get. But unlike most kids, Shaun never lost his interest in balloons. After he experienced that first orgasm masturbating with a balloon as a teenager, “There was a part of me that thought there was something very seriously wrong with me,” he says. For nearly a decade afterward, Shaun refused to touch the objects of his atypical affection. But he sometimes still craved them. Quitting balloons was like quitting smoking, he says. Accepting his homosexuality was much easier than admitting he had a balloon fetish. “I knew there were a lot of gay people out there,” he says. “With balloons, who had ever heard of that?” Chris Burney, the looner from Vermont, and Mike, the balloon businessman in Philly, have fetishes rooted in childhood fears of loud noises. Loud and unexpected balloon bursts frightened Burney as a kid, but somewhere between 8 and 12, he started feeling empowered by seeing how big he could blow one up without popping it. By the time he hit 15, the desire turned sexual. “I know it’s hard for people to understand why, but I get an erection from it. I don’t really understand why, but I do. ” At 19, he learned about the balloon fetish on an HBO documentary. “I couldn’t believe it. I was like, oh my god. ” Mike’s childhood fear of loud noises never subsided despite his interest in balloons turning into a fetish. The noise doesn’t bother him if it’s on screen: he enjoys watching videos like the ones he produces of sexy women playing with balloons. But if a balloon pops in front of Mike, the fun stops. “I don’t freak out, crawl up in a ball and shake,” he says. “I get startled. ” While for many looners the fetish is seemingly harmless, for others it can be disturbing, even damaging. Mike has witnessed a fanatical non-popper fall into a fetal position and quiver when a balloon suddenly deflated in his presence. The most extreme looners say they have ruined relationships (sneaking to hotel rooms to keep their secret from their spouses), gone into debt buying balloons and lost their sense of reality from their out-of-control preoccupation. Abramson, the UCLA professor, testifies as an expert witness in civil cases in which sex is an issue, and he says extreme fetishes can be unsafe. “I see the worst and most dangerous fetishes in my work as an expert witness; someone has died, been badly harmed. ” Abramson says the dependence on the fetish is the determining factor. “The more dependent and distressful, the worse it is. ” In determining whether a looner suffers from a psychological disorder, therapists will likely fit the person into one of four levels of fetishism outlined by Paul Gebhard, a well-known sexologist with a Ph. D. from Harvard and former director of the Institute for Sex Research. The most innocent enthusiasts, which Gebhard argues shouldn’t be called fetishists, slightly prefer specific stimuli, like balloons. Level two fetishists prefer an object like a balloon but don’t require one. Level three people would be those who need a balloon to perform sexually. And those who replace a sex partner with a balloon would be classified at the highest level – and at the greatest risk psychologically. The most fanatic non-poppers may be level four fetishists because they treat balloons as if they were human, so much so that they equate a busted balloon with murder. Mike is well connected in the looner community, and he says people who treat balloons as human partners are the exceptions. For Mike, balloons are like pizza – satisfying in moderation. “It’s like, ‘Ah, it’s Saturday night,’” he says. “I could go for some pizza. ” Shaun and his husband play with balloons in bed, but a balloon is not necessary for a satisfactory sexual experience. Burney won’t date women who ban balloons in the bedroom, but he also doesn’t need a balloon to get off. “A female is definitely going to turn me on. If a balloon is put into play, it’s a million times better. ” Lynda has applied a simple rule to her relationships: If a man tells her, “I ain’t doing that,” she says, “I ain’t doing you. ” Like several looners, Lynda became comfortable with her fixation came after she realized she wasn’t alone. And the Internet is to thank for that. Most looners grew up ashamed, thinking no one else in the world had a balloon fetish. Then they found people online who share their interest – people who had spouses, children, jobs; <b>perfectly</b> successful, <b>normal</b> people. “This is the moment when they realize, ‘I’m not alone,’” Gates says. The Internet has likely reduced the number of hardcore, level four fetishists, Gates says, by lessening the pressure and eliminating feelings of isolation – one of the worst burdens of fetishism. It then becomes easier to tell a partner about a fetish and helps people to keep their obsession under control. Some looners also throw in-person balloon parties. Shaun has hosted a few relatively tame gatherings that have included Balloon Buddy trivia contests, balloon inflation races and a roundtable discussion in which looners talk about their fetish. But the largest in-person balloon gathering Mike has heard of included about 40 guests. “I think a lot of people are still embarrassed about this,” he says. Mike is well-known in the heterosexual looner community and Shaun is known among gay looners, yet neither man will allow his last name to be published. Shaun explains: “I’m not ready to walk down the street with a thousand balloons and say, ‘hey, look at me,’ but I’m not ashamed of it either. ” Chris Burney, by contrast, is open enough about his fetish that he agreed to be featured on an episode of the TLC television series Strange Sex. Since the show aired in August, Burney has been criticized by what he calls the “vanilla world” – people who don’t have a fetish or are ignorant about them. But Burney says speaking out about balloon fetishism was the smartest thing he’s ever done. “Finally being able to come out and be myself and finally being able to walk down the street with a smile on my face, it was well worth it. ” He traveled a long road of secret shame to get to this point. “I remember the day that I literally got turned on by watching someone blow up a balloon. I said to myself that I would never tell anyone in my life. It was a secret. And I kept the secret for 10 years. ” But what once embarrassed Burney has become a source of pride. On his twenty-seventh birthday this past February, he maneuvered his 6 -foot- 7, nearly 400 -pound body inside a 72 -inch-wide transparent balloon and posted the video for his fans on YouTube – his fiftieth balloon fetish video on the site. Burney says the greater fetish community acts as a support system and reminds him that he’s not alone. Since coming out, he has been inspired to help people understand that it’s all right to be themselves. Burney says it also has helped him cope with difficult times. In the last few years, Burney’s father died, he has been unemployed, split up with his fiancé, suffered a mild heart attack and was diagnosed with Hodgkin’s lymphoma. Coming out as a looner is what he credits for changing his outlook on life and helping him cope. “If it wasn’t for the fetish community, I wouldn’t be where I’m at today. ” As important as the fetish community is to Burney, and contrary to what non-fetishists may think, he insists that balloon eroticism isn’t necessary for him to be happy. But it certainly helps. “Having a balloon fetish is not a big deal, it really isn’t. It’s awesome. ” Lynda says her boyfriend accepts her fetish because it’s not immoral, not fattening, it’s relatively cheap and brings a smile to her face. Shaun confesses to a scar on his inner thigh from a balloon pop gone wrong. Still, balloons are on the mild end of the fetish spectrum compared to masochism, sadism or an obsession with sharp objects. And playing dirty with balloons is healthier than more conventional addictions, like those involving alcohol, drugs or cigarettes. “There’s nothing wrong with having a balloon fetish,” Shaun says. “As long as you let it enhance y...|$|R

This abuse of notation is, in fact, taken to be <b>perfectly</b> <b>normal</b> in measure theory; it is the standard notation for the Radon–Nikodym derivative.|$|E
2500|$|The report {{included}} {{last moments}} in the cockpit, including a description of Omani captain Saoud Al Kindy praying as the plane nose-dived into the desert. Also on the flight deck was Bahraini co-pilot Khazal Al Qadi. The report mentioned that everything on board the flight was <b>perfectly</b> <b>normal</b> and voice transcripts showed the crew chatting among themselves. One asked the other if he was on duty the next day, to which he replied [...] "No, I've got a day off tomorrow". That {{was followed by a}} sudden interruption and the recording showed the pilots making a frantic attempt to control the plane.|$|E
2500|$|Contract {{implied in}} fact. A person's assent {{to be bound}} by an {{agreement}} can be expressed or implied. In the latter case, assuming the requisite formalities for a valid contract are met, there is a <b>perfectly</b> <b>normal</b> contract. The only distinction between a contract arising by express agreement between two people and a contract implied-in-fact is that the latter was recognised by a court drawing inferences from facts proved at trial. When the plaintiff sued on either sort of contract, she was suing in the law of contract in respect of a consensually assumed obligation and her remedy for the defendant's breach was damages.|$|E
2500|$|The {{earliest}} documented {{instances of}} piracy are {{the exploits of}} the Sea Peoples who threatened the ships sailing in the Aegean and Mediterranean waters in the 14th century BC. In classical antiquity, the Phoenicians, Illyrians and Tyrrhenians were known as pirates. The ancient Greeks condoned piracy as a viable profession; it apparently was widespread and [...] "regarded as an entirely honourable way of making a living". References are made to its <b>perfectly</b> <b>normal</b> occurrence many texts including in Homer's Iliad and Odyssey, and adbuction {{of women and children}} to be sold into slavery was common. By the era of Classical Greece, piracy was looked upon as a [...] "disgrace" [...] to have as a profession.|$|E
2500|$|But {{under the}} sensus communis we must include the Idea of a {{communal}} sense , i.e. of a faculty of judgement, which in its reflection takes account (a priori) of {{the mode of}} representation of all other men in thought; in order as it were to compare its judgement with the collective Reason of humanity, and thus to escape the illusion arising from the private conditions that could be so easily taken for objective, which would injuriously affect the judgement. Kant saw this concept as answering a particular need in his system: [...] "the question of why aesthetic judgments are valid: since aesthetic judgments are a <b>perfectly</b> <b>normal</b> function of the same faculties of cognition involved in ordinary cognition, {{they will have the}} same universal validity as such ordinary acts of cognition".|$|E
