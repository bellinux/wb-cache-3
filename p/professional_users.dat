40|$|Objective : The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the presence, frequency, and intensity of pain during speaking in <b>professional</b> voice <b>users</b> and nonvocal <b>professionals</b> and to determine if the presence of pain is significantly related with the profile of the <b>professional</b> voice <b>user.</b> Based on the available literature, significantly more pain symptoms in <b>professional</b> voice <b>users</b> can be hypothesized. Study Design : Sample survey. Methods : To characterize the presence, type, and degree of pain symptoms during speaking, a questionnaire was used. Pain severity was measured by means of a numerical rating scale. Results : Fifty-five (176 / 320) percent of the nonvocal professionals and 84 % (698 / 832) of the <b>professional</b> voice <b>users</b> mentioned the presence of one or more pain symptoms during speaking. Throat pain was mentioned as the most common pain in both the professional and nonvocal <b>professional</b> voice <b>users.</b> The <b>professional</b> voice <b>users</b> showed significantly more throat, neck, shoulder, headache, ear, and back pain. Moreover, the intensity of throat pain was significantly increased in the <b>professional</b> voice <b>users.</b> Conclusions : This study showed evidence that several types of pain are present with significantly greater frequency in <b>professional</b> voice <b>users.</b> Vocal screening strategies, diagnostic, and treatment protocols should include the assessment of the type and severity of pain. Currently, the voice clinic is working on improving the diagnostic protocol with the objective of defining the combination of tests, which best diagnose voice problems and related complaints and which evaluate progress in vocal characteristics and pain after rehabilitation...|$|R

40|$|This paper aims {{to present}} {{the needs of the}} <b>professional</b> {{information}} <b>user</b> for data quality. Firstly by looking at quality issues which are important to all professional information seeking tasks, and which should not be overlooked in order for advances in information retrieval to be acceptance by this community; and secondly to provide an example of a specific information retrieval task which, not only requires all the common quality criteria to be met, but is also common to three different professional groups. It is hoped that by considering common tasks such as this, fruitful directions for future research in IR which will benefit a wider number of information seekers will be realised. For the <b>professional</b> information <b>user</b> confidence in quality derives from data integrity, meaning information security, repeatability, transparency, timeliness, and confidentiality of information source, system and solution. Secondly an example of a use case common to three <b>professional</b> <b>user</b> groups will be used to illustrate these quality requirements, and to also describe again the complexity of professional information needs, but also, hopefully to illustrate some further area where information retrieval advances would be welcomed. ...|$|R
