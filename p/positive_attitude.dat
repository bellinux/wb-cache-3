A one-year longitudinal study involving 91 teachers and 1822 students from the higher years of Dutch primary schools showed that students develop less <b>positive</b> <b>attitudes</b> towards science and technology during their primary school years and that girls showed less <b>positive</b> <b>attitudes</b> than boys.

Methods: Among {{a random sample}} of university students (N = 852), multivariable logistic regression models assessed associations between <b>positive</b> and negative <b>attitudes</b> toward HTS. Results: <b>Positive</b> <b>attitudes</b> were associated with adjusted odds of 4. 32 (95 % CI = 3. 20, 5. 82) for current HTS, whereas negative attitudes were associated with lower adjusted odds for current smoking HTS (AOR = 0. 64, 95 % CI = 0. 53, 0. 76). <b>Positive</b> <b>attitudes</b> were also associated with adjusted odds of 9. 31 (95 % CI = 6. 77, 12. 80) for intention for future hookah use among non-HTS users. Conclusion: <b>Positive</b> <b>attitudes</b> toward HTS were more strongly associated with HTS compared to negative attitudes. It may be particularly valuable for future research and interventions to focus on decreasing <b>positive</b> <b>attitudes</b> toward HTS...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} is to {{elucidate}} what enables <b>positive</b> <b>attitudes</b> towards buying sex. The study has a posthumanist approach and the data is gathered trough hidden observations of a Swedish web forum dedicated to discussions of prostitution. The theoretical frame that is used in the study consist of concepts from the material feminists Karen Barads and Donna J. Haraways theories and Niels van Doorns argument of the embodiment of virtual texts. A theoretical inspired thematic analysis is used to examine the data from the observations of the web forum. The study shows that <b>positive</b> <b>attitudes</b> towards buying sex are given space and permanence though a variety of intra-actions between material and human agents. At the same time the result of the intra-actions is that the <b>positive</b> <b>attitudes</b> get mediated and endorsed, which enables <b>positive</b> <b>attitudes</b> towards buying sex. In addition to that, the intra-action between material and human agents creates normative understandings about buying sex and prostitution, which also enables these attitudes. In conclusion, the study shows that the enablement of <b>positive</b> <b>attitudes</b> towards buying sex is created through intra-action between not only human agents, instead the material shows to have a significant part in the enablement of <b>positive</b> <b>attitudes</b> towards buying sex...|$|R

Brian swims out to save him from drowning, but strains his back during the rescue and also ends up stranded in the water along with Peter, before being rescued by Joe. Lois berates Peter for his actions, since Brian is becoming old and has been smoking and drinking. Peter begins to grow upset about Brian's age so he obtains another dog and names him New Brian. His <b>positive</b> <b>attitude</b> and desirable personality make Brian feel like an outcast and Brian becomes sad that he is now unloved, and rejected. For example in one scene, when the Griffins hear New Brian fart, they think it is cute and when Brian does it, they get furious and kick him out. He ultimately decides to leave the residence, while his family begins to miss him.|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} religious affiliation, church attendance, and attitudes towards immigration. Following the ethnoreligious perspective, I predict that those who identify as Mainline Protestant, Evangelical Protestant, or Catholic will hold more <b>positive</b> <b>attitudes</b> {{than those who do}} not affiliate, which would reflect the teachings of their churches. I also predict that Catholics may have particularly <b>positive</b> <b>attitudes</b> because of social identity theory. Attending church services should be associated with more <b>positive</b> <b>attitudes,</b> according to religious restructuralism. Using 2006 telephone survey data of 1, 135 Nebraskans from the Nebraska Annual Social Indicators Survey (NASIS), I use binary logistic regression to test these theories and their effect on seven separate measures of immigration attitudes. I found that while affiliating with one of the religious groups did not lead to more <b>positive</b> <b>attitudes,</b> attending church services {{at least once a week}} was associated with more <b>positive</b> <b>attitudes</b> on the topics of government spending on immigrants and immigrants and crime. Results partially support religious restructuralism and the theory that church attendance, not merely identifying with a religious group, is what can improve attitudes towards immigration.

5|$|ETS, whose {{prestige}} {{enhanced the}} credibility of its findings, conducted two landmark summative evaluations in 1970 and 1971, demonstrating that Sesame Street had a significant educational impact on its viewers. These studies illustrated the early educational effects of Sesame Street, and have been cited in other studies {{of the effects of}} television on young children. ETS reported that the children who watched the show most learned the most, and achieved better results in letter-recognition skills. Three-year-olds who watched regularly scored higher than five-year-olds who did not; children from low-income households who were regular viewers scored higher than children from higher-income households who watched the show less frequently. Similar results occurred in children from non-English-speaking homes. Although adult supervision was not required for children to learn using the material presented, children who watched and discussed the program with their parents gained more skills than those who did not. Children viewing the show in an informal home setting learned as much as children who watched it at school under a teacher's supervision. Regular viewers adjusted better to the school environment than non-viewers. They also had a more <b>positive</b> <b>attitude</b> toward school and better peer relations than non-viewers.|$|E

Reubens also published a book as Pee-wee in 1989 called Travels with Pee-Wee. CBS aired reruns of Playhouse until July 1991, when Reubens was arrested, pulling from their schedule the last two remaining reruns. Fox Family Channel briefly aired reruns of the Playhouse in 1998. In early July 2006, Cartoon Network began running a teaser promo during its Adult Swim lineup. A later press release and many other promos confirmed that the show's 45 original episodes would nightly air from Monday to Thursday starting on that date. Playhouse attracted 1.5 million viewers nightly. In 2007, TV Guide named Playhouse {{one of the top}} 10 TV cult classics of all time.

The data obtained from the views of teachers with <b>positive</b> and negative <b>attitudes</b> towards rubrics were examined with figures. The findings indicated that the teachers with <b>positive</b> <b>attitudes</b> towards the rubrics benefited from the rubrics more than the teachers with negative attitudes when they were evaluating the achievement of the students in performance tasks. Both the teachers with <b>positive</b> and negative <b>attitudes</b> stated that they had knowledge about the rubrics and they used the course books while getting this information. Moreover, the teachers with negative attitudes consulted their colleagues more than the teachers with <b>positive</b> <b>attitudes.</b> It was observed that the teachers with <b>positive</b> <b>attitudes</b> prepared the rubrics themselves more often than the teachers with negative attitudes and they used the information obtained from the rubrics for “observing the development of students’ higher order thinking skills” and “observing to what extent the students used their knowledge and skills in real life situations”.
