40|$|Nowadays, peoples {{are facing}} problem {{to find an}} {{available}} <b>parking</b> <b>space</b> in <b>parking</b> lot due to the tremendous increase of occupancy of cars. When driver enters a certain parking lot, the driver takes along time just to find an available <b>parking</b> <b>space.</b> A Counting Available <b>Parking</b> <b>Space</b> using Image Processing (CAPSuIP) has been developed {{to solve the problem}} that driver faced with low cost. CAPSuIP use image processing to detect of existence of the car and also provide information such as number of available <b>parking</b> <b>space</b> and the location of that parking. The system captures image using surveillance camera and process the image to counting available <b>parking</b> <b>space.</b> The system use a modified Software D&velopment Life Cycle (SDLC) to plan, analyze, design, development and testing.

40|$|<b>Parking</b> <b>space</b> is a {{basic and}} {{important}} public facility in urban areas. Problems of <b>parking</b> <b>space</b> {{are said to be}} always occuring in urban areas, especially in the city centre or busy commercial and services zones. In Malaysia, the common parking system adopted is shared-parking turn-time system, whereby members of the public share limited <b>parking</b> <b>space</b> in the city centre and have to take turns to keep their vehicle temporarily in parking lots. City centres are said to be suffering from insufficient <b>parking</b> <b>space,</b> forcing people to park their vehicles on road shoulders or outside the gazetted parking lots. This causes traffic congestion and arouses question of sufficiency of <b>parking</b> <b>space</b> in such areas. The basic task in addressing this issue is by carrying out supply and demand analysis of <b>parking</b> <b>space.</b> The objective {{of this study is to}} apply a spatial technique using the Geographic Information System (CIS) in modelling the supply and demand of <b>parking</b> <b>space,</b> taking Johor Bahru city centre as a study case. Maps of buildings, land cadastre, urban land use, and others such as road and street networks are digitally constructed to form a spatial database of supply and demand of <b>parking</b> <b>space</b> in the study area. Attribute data on building inventory, building characteristics, land use, space supply, and demand of <b>parking</b> <b>space</b> are obtained from the Johor Bahru City Council, private parking companies operating in the city, observational, as well as interview surveys in the study area. The shared-parking turn-time model - the "SpaTT model" - is developed to analyse spatial distribution of <b>parking</b> <b>space</b> supply and demand in the study area. The "SpaTT model" is then incorporated into Arc View 3. 1 to determine <b>parking</b> <b>space</b> equilibrium across the study area. This, in turn, is used to determine zones with <b>parking</b> <b>space</b> deficit and, thus, which need additional parking lots. The study discloses that there is reasonable level of <b>parking</b> <b>space</b> equilibrium in the study area. In other words, there is no evidence of acute supply problem of <b>parking</b> <b>space</b> in the Johor Bahru city centre as perceived, although there are zones where additional on-street parking could be provided to add parking supply...|$|R

40|$|To easily find an unoccupied <b>parking</b> <b>space</b> {{in larger}} car park {{is a problem}} for many drivers. During the last four-decade, there are many parking models are develop. But, the models still cannot solve the parking problem. Another problem in parking systems is about {{security}} systems. The problem is about how {{to make sure that the}} car is safe and this kind of problem involves the security systems. Thus, we have to design a system that can help driver to find <b>parking</b> <b>space</b> easily and at the same time the car that has been park is safe. This project is especially design for private <b>parking</b> <b>space</b> and this system is not suitable for open <b>parking</b> <b>space.</b> The <b>parking</b> <b>space</b> will be monitor by magnetic sensors and the security systems is applied when the user enter the password. So, the user must have a password before they can enter the <b>parking</b> <b>space.</b> Some examples of application for this system are at exclusive club, country club and any private places...|$|R
40|$|This work aims at {{providing}} an effective parking management system {{by reducing the}} drivers' searching time for vacant car-parking space, in turn improving the traffic flow in the car park areas. This is achieved {{by the use of}} Fiber Bragg Grating Sensor (FBG) sensor instrumentation in vehicle parking management system. Present work involves embedding an array of FBG sensors underground in the <b>parking</b> <b>space,</b> then determining the strain changes on the FBG sensor due to load applied by the vehicle parked in the <b>parking</b> <b>space,</b> occupancy of the <b>parking</b> <b>space</b> is determined. To validate the FBG sensor parking management system, three most common cases have been considered.

Departments that are involved in the management of <b>parking</b> <b>space</b> in campus are different compared to other areas. In this research, MARA University of Technology (UiTM) Shah Alam was chosen as a case study. This institution is chosen because UiTM Shah Alam has a management system that is managed by its own unit. The objective of this research is to identify the problems and effectiveness of <b>parking</b> <b>space</b> management in UiTM Shah Alam. In addition, the objective is also to evaluate the satisfaction level of the user on management of <b>parking</b> <b>space.</b> The method carried out was through questionnaires and analysis.

40|$|Abstract — Our work {{draws on}} a {{concrete}} <b>parking</b> <b>space</b> search application to explore fundamental tradeoffs of wireless networking {{solutions to the}} provision of real-life services. In particular, we consider a city area, wherein each vehicle (mobile user) moves towards a chosen destination and seeks vacant <b>parking</b> <b>space</b> in its vicinity. Three main approaches to the <b>parking</b> <b>space</b> search problem are investigated, each representing a distinct paradigm of how wireless networking communications can assist the information management process. In the first approach, the vehicles execute the currently common “blind” sequential search for <b>parking</b> <b>space</b> by wandering around the destination. In the second distributed approach, the vehicles, while moving around the area, opportunistically collect and share with each other information on the location and status of each parking spot they encounter. Finally, with the third approach...|$|R

As the result the driver need to waste their time to circle the parking lot area to find out the free <b>parking</b> <b>space</b> to <b>park</b> their car. This paper investigates about problem and the weakness about the parking that exits in the FSKKP and finally it proposed the Mobi Parking Navigator System (clientside) to prevent this problem from occurs again.
