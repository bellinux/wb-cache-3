5|$|Krimibhojana/Krimibhaksha (worm-food): As per the Bhagavata Purana and the Devi Bhagavata Purana, it {{is where}} a <b>person</b> <b>who</b> <b>does</b> not share his food with guests, elders, {{children}} or the gods, and selfishly eats it alone, and he who eats without performing the five yajnas (panchayajna) is chastised. The Vishnu Purana states that one who loathes his father, Brahmins or the gods and who destroys jewels is punished here. This hell is a 100,000 yojana lake filled with worms. The sinful person is reduced to a worm, who feeds on other worms, who in turn devour his body for 100,000 years.|$|E

25|$|In Hungary, from 15 March 2014 {{when the}} long-awaited Civil Code was published, the law re-stated {{what had been}} normal practice, namely, that a person {{had the right to}} refuse being {{photograph}}ed. However, implied consent exists: it is not illegal to photograph a <b>person</b> <b>who</b> <b>does</b> not actively object.|$|E
25|$|Technology is even {{important}} in face-to-face social situations. For example, when deaf people meet a hearing <b>person</b> <b>who</b> <b>does</b> not know sign language, they often communicate via the notepad on their cell phones. Here, technology takes {{the place of}} a human sense, allowing deaf individuals to successfully communicate with different cultures.|$|E
25|$|Dance (from Old French dancier, {{perhaps from}} Frankish) {{generally}} refers to human movement either {{used as a}} form of expression or presented in a social, spiritual or performance setting. Dance is also used to describe methods of non-verbal communication (see body language) between humans or animals (bee dance, mating dance), and motion in inanimate objects (the leaves danced in the wind). Choreography is the art of creating dances, and the <b>person</b> <b>who</b> <b>does</b> this is called a choreographer.|$|E

25|$|The {{theological}} {{basis for}} forgiveness in Hinduism {{is that a}} <b>person</b> <b>who</b> <b>does</b> not forgive carries a baggage of memories of the wrong, of negative feelings, of anger and unresolved emotions that affect his or her present as well as future. In Hinduism, not only should one forgive others, but one must also seek forgiveness if one has wronged someone else. Forgiveness is to be sought from the individual wronged, as well as society at large, by acts of charity, purification, fasting, rituals and meditative introspection.|$|E
25|$|Liu Biao, the Governor of Jing Province, {{will not}} be persuaded by Liu Bei to launch an attack on Xu City, since Liu Biao is a <b>person</b> <b>who</b> <b>does</b> nothing but sit and talk.

25|$|The genders of nouns are {{masculine}} and feminine. A rough {{rule of thumb}} is that almost all masculine nouns in nominative case end in -s and most feminine – in -(i)a or -ė. There are no strict rules governing the gender. For example, upė – river, is feminine, but upelis – rivulet, is masculine. There is no neuter gender ("it gender"), {{but there are a few}} words that can be applied to both genders equally. They mostly describe people, have negative connotations, and end in -a, for example vė́pla – dummy, el̃geta – beggar, naktìbalda – night-lumberer, a <b>person</b> <b>who</b> <b>does</b> not sleep at night, but mėmė̃ – gawk.|$|E

500|$|In 1976, John Halverson {{argued that}} Leach's {{argument}} about taboos was [...] "specious", and his [...] "categorisation {{of animals in}} terms of 'social distance' and edibility is inconsistent in itself and corresponds neither to reality nor to the scheme of social distance and human sexuality it is claimed to parallel". Halverson disputed the association of animal epithets with potency, noting that calling a timid person a mouse, or a <b>person</b> <b>who</b> <b>does</b> not face reality an ostrich, or a silly person a goose, {{does not mean that}} these names are potent, taboo, or sacred.|$|E

A <b>person</b> <b>who</b> <b>does</b> not hold a certificate of suitability may not be admitted to an institution of higher learning as a student. A person who has been refused a certificate may appeal to the Home Affairs Minister, whose decision on the matter is final and cannot be called into question in any court.|$|E

There’s one <b>person</b> <b>who</b> <b>does</b> the eye brows, one person does the feet." [...] Janssen, who could not [...] "say enough things about Tommy [...] ", said she was especially impressed at how he stuck to his specific vision and [...] "fought" [...] hard to hire a number of unknown European actors {{that would otherwise be}} unlikely to appear in a big studio American film, in effect making it a much more international production.|$|E

500|$|In 1997 Chief of Staff Erskine Bowles {{recruited}} Mathews for {{deputy chief}} of staff after being impressed with her intelligence during an Oval Office meeting. Mathews became one of two Deputy Chiefs of Staff, serving alongside John Podesta. She was {{deputy chief of}} staff for policy, charged with the task of keeping the White House focused on its agenda amidst the impeachment of Clinton. Bowles later praised her as smart, hardworking, and skilled at getting people to work together, saying, [...] "I've never known one <b>person</b> <b>who</b> <b>does</b> all those things as well." [...] Bowles resigned in 1998, at which point Podesta was named chief of staff and Mathews moved to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), where she took the role of deputy director under Jack Lew. Mathews remained at OMB for the remainder of Clinton's presidency, during a time of three budget surpluses.|$|E
500|$|The event CGs were {{decided by}} Nakazawa {{based on the}} game's plot and script, and written down in a {{specification}} document given to the art team. Because this was done before the scenario was completely finished, there were some places that he {{when looking at the}} scenario as a whole realized would have benefited more from a CG than some of the passages that did get one, despite how he updated the specification document every so often throughout the development. Because of this, it was decided to add more CGs to several scenes for the game's [...] "Premium Edition" [...] re-release. A challenge in creating the CGs was that the art team did not understand the game's main plot twist, resulting in several finished CGs with mistakes that a <b>person</b> <b>who</b> <b>does</b> not know about the twist would not have noticed, that had to be fixed. For the background art, inspiration was drawn from the films Cube and The Abyss and the video game Resident Evil.|$|E
500|$|The Avalanches have {{described}} the album as a [...] "road trip" [...] in a [...] "big, wide, expansive country like Australia." [...] For inspiration, the group looked back on their teenage years of driving {{around the country and}} suburbia listening to music. The record is supposed to [...] "capture that feeling of growing up...jumping in the car and hitting the road with a six-pack and heading out to the bush." [...] The album attempts to capture the [...] "halfway between happy and sad" [...] feeling similar to old Beach Boys records which are a constant inspiration for the group. Chater felt that this feeling is what made Since I Left You a success, and they have continuously strived to create that feeling. Di Blasi thinks of Wildflower as a free-spirited <b>person</b> <b>who</b> <b>does</b> what they wish regardless of conventionality. The album features many samples from 1960s psychedelic music and relates to the era through counterculture and anti-establishment themes.|$|E

500|$|In {{addition}} to gameplay, {{she was also}} one of the first characters to have her backstory fleshed out. In an interview with PC Gamer, the game's creative director, Chris Metzen stated, [...] "Tracer [...] one of the first characters we really got to know. And while she wasn't particularly created to be a starring role, if you will, we felt on the team, the more we got to know her and play her, she was kind of like this Spider-Man type character for us. She's so rad, and it feels good to leverage her in the front of story ideas." [...] Tracer has also been noted for being a peppy character, with Hardcore Gamers Kevin Dunsmore describing her as a [...] "spunky Brit [...] full of little quips as she zips around the battlefield". Kaplan described [...] "Tracer [...] cute and playful, and she's the type of <b>person</b> <b>who</b> <b>does</b> everything with a wink and a smile." [...] In an interview with PCGamesN, game designer Michael Chu stated that [...] "the thing about Tracer is that she has a personality which is out of the norm for most people. She is incredibly optimistic, she is incredibly bubbly - it's part of her hero persona. We love her, I think she is very much one of the main characters of the game [...] really carry the torch of what the game is all about: heroism." [...] To reflect her English origin, Tracer is voiced by English actress Cara Theobold.|$|E

2500|$|Smith {{felt that}} the {{character}} needed to be a quiet and rather introverted <b>person</b> <b>who</b> <b>does</b> not burn himself out at every possible instance.

Smith acknowledged Seven Pounds as a drama film, but he saw it {{as more of a}} love story.|$|E
