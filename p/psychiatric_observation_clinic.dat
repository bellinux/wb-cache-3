50|$|The Pieter Baan Centre (Pieter Baan Centrum) is a {{forensic}} <b>psychiatric</b> <b>observation</b> <b>clinic</b> in Utrecht, Netherlands, {{operated by the}} Ministry of Security and Justice, where suspects of crimes in the Netherlands are observed to ascertain whether they can be held wholly responsible for their suspected crimes. When suspects are found guilty, but performed their crimes while suffering from some sort of psychiatric or psychological disorder, they may be applicable for involuntary commitment (in Dutch terbeschikkingstelling or TBS), which means To be held at disposal. This is a special measure for crimes which are committed under psychologically abnormal circumstances. The purpose is to treat the perpetrator rather than to punish them and to work towards their reintegration into society.The TBS measure is usually enacted after about one third to half of the prison sentence has been served, thought this practice is now (as of medio 2010) under review. The duration of TBS terms are decided upon by the treatment staff in concordance with the Ministry of Justice and can last decades. For this reason perpetrators not always cooperate with the observations of the Pieter Baan Centre.|$|E
40|$|In studies {{attempting}} to classify criminal offenders by cluster analysis of Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory- 2 (MMPI- 2) data, {{the number of}} clusters found varied between 10 (the Megargee System) and two (one cluster indicating no psychopathology and one exhibiting serious psychopathology). The latter results raise doubts about the suitability of the MMPI- 2 for classification in forensic settings. The present study aimed at deriving ail empirical classification system using cluster analysis of 247 MMPI- 2 profiles of pretrial criminal defendants in a forensic <b>psychiatric</b> <b>observation</b> <b>clinic.</b> Results indicated only a 'non-disturbed' and a 'disturbed' profile, differing on general elevation of MMPI- 2 profiles but displaying no qualitatively distinct profiles. The clusters differed oil age at admission and first conviction, indicating a late onset of criminal activity for disturbed offenders. Also, the clusters differed significantly on Axis I diagnosis and borderline significantly on Axis II diagnosis. The absence of distinct personality profiles between the clusters suggests restricted usefulness of the MMPI- 2 in a forensic context of diverse and severe psychopathology and serious crimes. Either the investigated population is in fact extremely homogeneous, truly comprising only two kinds of offenders, or the types of offenders in these populations are not effectively distinguished by the MMPI- 2...|$|E

40|$|A {{research}} report {{submitted to the}} Faculty of Health Sciences, University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Medicine in the branch of Psychiatry Johannesburg, 2014 BACKGROUND: Sexual offences against children have been an escalating problem in South Africa. Several international studies have found links between mental illness and sexual offenders. However, very little has been published on forensic <b>psychiatric</b> <b>observation</b> populations charged with sexual offences. South African studies have neither reported on mental illness and sexual offences against children, nor on forensic <b>psychiatric</b> <b>observation</b> of individuals charged with sexual offences against children. AIMS: To determine the demographic and clinical characteristics, and outcomes of the observation process, in a population charged with sexual offences against minors, referred for forensic <b>psychiatric</b> <b>observation.</b> OBJECTIVES: To measure {{the number of individuals}} admitted to a forensic <b>psychiatric</b> unit for <b>observation,</b> for any charge of a sexual offence against a minor, over a three year period; to determine their demographic profiles; to determine the number assessed to be fit to stand trial and criminally responsible, and the number not fit to stand trial and/or not criminally responsible; to determine if associations exist between the reasons for referral and outcomes in terms of fitness and responsibility; and to ascertain whether mental disorders were present in these individuals. METHODS: This study took the form of a retrospective record review at Sterkfontein Hospital from January 2007 to December 2009. It included all individuals charged with a sexual offence against a minor. Data was collected from the Criminal Procedure Act reports and clinical files. RESULTS: Rape was the commonest charge. More than half the sample was found fit to stand trial and criminally responsible. However, a high number of psychiatric diagnoses were made, of which substance-related disorders and intellectual impairment represented the majority of diagnoses. CONCLUSIONS: Among individuals referred for forensic <b>psychiatric</b> <b>observation,</b> charged with sexual offences against minors, rape was the commonest charge. Most of these individuals were found fit to stand trial and/or criminally responsible. However, a significant number were diagnosed with mental disorders. It is recommended that they receive special rehabilitation and psycho-education into their psychiatric conditions and the consequences thereof...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} empirically investigates whether {{personality}} disorders and psychopathic traits in criminal suspects are reasons for diminished criminal responsibility or enforced treatment in high security hospitals. Recently, the tenability {{of the claim}} that individuals with personality disorders and psychopathy can be held fully responsible for crimes has been questioned on theoretical bases. According to some interpretations, these disorders are due to cognitive, biological and developmental deficits that diminish the individual's accountability. The current article presents two studies among suspects of serious crimes under forensic evaluation in a Dutch forensic <b>psychiatric</b> <b>observation</b> <b>clinic.</b> The first study examined how experts weigh personality disorders in their conclusions {{as far as the}} degree of criminal responsibility and the need for enforced forensic psychiatric treatment are concerned (n = 843). The second study investigated associations between PCL-R scores and experts' responsibility and treatment advisements (n = 108). The results suggest that in Dutch forensic practice, the presence of a personality disorder decreased responsibility and led to an advice for enforced forensic treatment. Experts also take characteristics of psychopathy concerning impulsivity and (ir) responsibility into consideration when judging criminal accountability. Furthermore, they deem affective deficiencies sufficiently important to indicate suspects' threat to society or dangerousness and warrant a need for forensic treatment...|$|E
