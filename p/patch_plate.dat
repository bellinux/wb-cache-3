40|$|AbstractUnderwater welding is {{commonly}} used to repair corroded offshore steel structures. Corrosion-damaged portions are covered by welded patch plates. According to the current design manual, a thickness of <b>patch</b> <b>plate</b> and a weld length can be determined. However, different weld patterns can be designed {{to achieve the same}} required weld length. In order to examine the effectiveness of these different weld patterns, this paper first proposes a method to model underwater welds in the finite element analysis based on mechanical properties of fillet welds obtained from weld strength tests. The weld model was firstly validated against a theoretical shear stress distribution in a longitudinal fillet weld and then further validated against experimental results of thickness-reduced steel pipes repaired with welded patch plates under compression. The proposed model was then applied to thickness-reduced steel pipes repaired by welded patch plates with different weld patterns that have the minimum required weld length. Behaviors of these repaired pipes under a compressive load were examined with respect to stiffness, load-carrying capacity, load share of patch plates, and failure modes. It was found that stiffness and load-carrying capacity of the thickness-reduced steel pipes under compression cannot be fully recovered by the welded <b>patch</b> <b>plate</b> repair when a <b>patch</b> <b>plate</b> thickness {{is the same as the}} thickness reduction of the damaged pipe.

40|$|It {{is known}} that the {{impedance}} {{at the center of}} a patch antenna element is a short circuit, implying that a wire or post can be connected from the patch to the groundplane at this point without impacting radiation performance. In principle, this central post can be used to support the patch element, thus eliminating the need for dielectric. In spaceborne applications, this approach is problematic because a patch element supported by a single, thin post is highly susceptible to acoustic loads during launch. The technology reported here uses a large-diameter center post as its supporting structure. The supporting structure allows for the fabrication of a sufficiently rigid antenna element that can survive launch loads. The post may be either hollow or solid, depending on fabrication approach and/or mass constraints. The patch antenna element and support post are envisioned as being fabricated (milled) from a single piece of aluminum or other metal. Alternately, the <b>patch</b> <b>plate</b> and support column can be fabricated separately and then joined using fasteners, adhesive, or welding.

40|$|Abstract — In structures, stress {{concentration}} {{is a factor}} of fatigue fracture. Basically, the {{stress concentration}} is a phenomenon that should be avoided. However, {{it is difficult to}} avoid the stress concentration. Therefore, relaxation of the stress concentration is important. The stress concentration arises from notches and circular holes. There is a relaxation method that a composite patch covers a notch and a circular hole. This relaxation method is used to repair aerial wings, but it is not systematized. Composites are more expensive than single materials. Accordingly, we propose the relaxation method that a single material patch covers a notch and a circular hole, and aim to systematize this relaxation method. We performed FEA (Finite Element Analysis) about an object by using a three-dimensional FEA model. The object was that a patch adheres to a plate with a circular hole. And, a uniaxial tensile load acts on the <b>patched</b> <b>plate</b> with a circular hole. In the three-dimensional FEA model, {{it is not easy to}} model the adhesion layer. Basically, the yield stress of the adhesive is smaller than that of adherents. Accordingly, the adhesion layer gets to plastic deformation earlier than the adherents under the yield load of adherents. Therefore, we propose the three-dimensional FEA model which is applied a nonlinear elastic region to the adhesion layer. The nonlinear elastic region was calculated by a bilinear approximation. We compared the analysis results with the tensile test results to confirm whether the analysis model has usefulness. As a result, the analysis results agreed with the tensile test results. And, we confirmed that the analysis model has usefulness. As a result that the three-dimensional FEA model was used to the analysis, it was confirmed that an out-of-plane deformation occurred to the <b>patched</b> <b>plate</b> with a circular hole. The out-of-plane deformation causes stress increase of the <b>patched</b> <b>plate</b> with a circular hole. Therefore, we investigated that the out-of-plane deformation affects relaxation of the stress concentration in the plate with a circular hole on this relaxation method. As a result, it was confirmed that the out-of-plane deformation inhibits relaxation of the stress concentration on the plate with a circular hole.

40|$|The use of adhesively bonded {{composite}} reinforcements for strengthening metallic structures is {{a relatively}} new technique that has been introduced in the past few years. The technique was first applied for crack patching of aircraft components, with the first civil engineering applications on steel bridge members, which have been damaged due to corrosion or fatigue, being more recent. The finite element (FE) method was employed in order to analyse a steel plate containing a crack and reinforced with an adhesively bonded composite patch. The role of parameters such as the crack size and the properties (modulus and thickness) of the patch and the adhesive was examined. Results in tenns of the stress magnification factor at the crack tip and the shear and peel stress distributions at the steel/adhesive interface were obtained. Following this, the FE results were used in order to develop an analytical model for estimating the stress magnification factor (YJ for patched cracks. The effects of patch pre-stressing and thennal loading due to mismatch in thennal expansion coefficients of the materials involved were also examined. Patch debonding was also investigated. Two different cases were considered, namely a <b>patched</b> <b>plate</b> without a crack and a <b>patched</b> <b>plate</b> containing a crack. For the latter, apart from debonding being initiated from the patch extremities (patch end debonding), crack mouth debonding was also considered. The effect of debonding on Yp was determined. Following this, debonding was modelled as a crack located at the steel/adhesive interface and a fracture parameter, namely the energy release rate G, was obtained at the interface crack tip. An analytical model for G pertaining to patch end debonding was also developed. An experimental study was carried out in order to validate the model proposed for Yp' Fatigue tests of patched cracked specimens were performed and crack growth data was obtained and compared with predictions using the analytical model for Yp inside the well known Paris crack growth law. Prior to this, the tensile properties for steel and composite and the fatigue properties of steel were determined from tests. The results indicate that the models obtained can be used for the design of composite patch repairs of steel members. Therefore, they were included in a design methodology, which is also presented. The latter could form the basis of a more,comprehensive future design guide, or even complete existing guides, such as the CIRIA. guide (Cadei et a 1. 2004).

The model helps to select a patch material (i. e., elastic modulus of the material) and the patch thickness in order to reduce the Strain Energy Release Rate (SERR) at the crack tip. In other words, in order to achieve the desired SERR using the single-side patch, the analytical model can be utilized to find a proper patch material and patch dimensions for the given cracked plate if the plate modulus and thickness as well as the crack size are known. The model is based on the axial and bending stresses of the single-side strap joint, and those stresses are related to the SERR at the crack tip of a plate with a single-side patch repair.

This area of the small intestine as well as the cecum are both drained by the distal mesenteric lymph nodes, and were the only nodes which contained detectable numbers of viable Salmonella over the first 24 h of infection.
