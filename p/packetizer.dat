50|$|<b>Packetizer</b> bus {{monitors}} {{are designed}} for networked data acquisition systems where the acquired data from the avionics buses is captured and re-packetized in Ethernet frames for transmission to an analysis computer or network recorder. The <b>packetizer</b> bus monitor captures selected messages of interest (parsed) or all messages on the bus (snarfed) and packages the message in the payload of a UDP/IP packet. The application layer contains bus identifiers, sequence numbers and timestamps. The most popular application layer protocols used for networked data acquisition systems include the Airbus IENA format and the iNET (integrated Network Enhanced Telemetry) TmNS (Telemetry Network System) format.|$|E

Despite this, and the increased size of the data acquisition networks, the use of tightly integrated hardware, and setup and analysis software enable the FTI engineer to save time and increase productivity. This paper outlines how the use of innovative bus <b>packetizer</b> technology and the close integration of FTI software can simplify this process. The paper describes how <b>packetizer</b> technology is used to acquire data from avionics buses, and how it packages this data in a format that is optimized for network based systems. The paper further describes how software can simplify the process of configuring avionics bus monitors in addition to automating and optimizing the transport of data from various nodes in the acquisition network for transmission to either network recorders or via a telemetry link...|$|E

An accurateQoS metric for these services are of interest both for the customer and theservice provider. This thesis has investigated the impact of different parameterson the perceived voice quality for encrypted VoIP using a PESQ score as referencevalue. Based on this investigation a parametric prediction model has been developedwhich outputs a R-value, {{comparable to that of}} the widely used E-modelfrom ITU. This thesis can further be seen as a template for how to construct modelsof other equipments or codecs than those evaluated here since they effect theresult but are hard to parametrise. The results of the investigation are consistent with previous studies regarding theimpact of packet loss, the impact of jitter is shown to be significant over 40 ms. The results from three different <b>packetizers</b> are presented which illustrates theneed to take such aspects into consideration when constructing a model to predictvoice quality. The model derived from the investigation performs well withno mean error and a standard deviation of the error of a mere 1 : 45 R-value unitswhen validated in conditions to be expected in GSM networks. When validatedagainst an emulated 3 G network the standard deviation is even lower. ...|$|R
40|$|By {{extending}} the system theory under the (min,+) -algebra {{to the time}} varying setting, we {{solve the problem of}} constrained traffic regulation and develop a calculus for dynamic service guarantees. For a constrained traffic regulation problem with maximum tolerable delay d and maximum buffer size q, the optimal regulator that generates the output traffic conforming to a subadditive envelope f and minimizes the number of discarded packets is a concatenation of the g-clipper with g(t) = min[f(t+d), f(t) +q] and the maximal f-regulator. The g-clipper is a bufferless device which optimally drops packets as necessary in order that its output be conformant to an envelope g. The maximal f-regulator is a buffered device that delays packets as necessary in order that its output be conformant to an envelope f. The maximal f-regulator is a linear time invariant filter with impulse response f, under the (min +) -algebra. To provide dynamic service guarantees in a network, we develop the concept of a dynamic server as a basic network element. Dynamic servers can be joined by concatenation, "filter bank summation," and feedback to form a composite dynamic server. We also show that dynamic service guarantees for multiple input streams sharing a work conserving link can be achieved by a dynamic SCED (Service Curve Earliest Deadline) scheduling algorithm, if an appropriate admission control is enforced. To model more general network elements, such as routers and <b>packetizers,</b> we extend the time varying system theory to a general system theory, where the mapping from the input to the output is required to be sigma-additive under the (min,+) -algebra. Analogous to dynamic servers, network elements with the sigma-additive property can also be joined by concatenation, "filter bank summation," and feedback to form a composite network element...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports on}} the {{integration}} of a lossless data compression/decompression chipset into a space data system architecture. For its compression engine, the data system incorporates the Universal Source Encoder (USE) designed for the NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center. Currently, the data compression testbed generates video frames consisting of 512 lines of 512 pixels having 8 -bit resolution. Each image is passed through the USE where the lines are internally partitioned into 16 -word blocks. These blocks are adaptively encoded across widely varying entropy levels using a Rice 12 -option set coding algorithm. The current system operates at an Input/Output rate of 10 Msamples/s or 80 Mbits/s for each buffered input line. Frame and line synchronization for each image are maintained {{through the use of}} uniquely decodable command words. Length information of each variable length compressed image line is also included in the output stream. The data and command information are passed to the next stage of the system architecture through a serial fiber-optic transmitter. The initial segment of this stage consists of <b>packetizer</b> hardware which adds an appropriate CCSDS header to the received source data. An uncompressed mode is optionally available to pass image lines directly to the <b>packetizer</b> hardware. A data decompression testbed has also been developed to confirm the data compression operation...|$|E

40|$|Abstract [...] This paper {{presents}} implementations of two MPEG- 4 Streaming scenarios (remote retrieval and broadcast) for {{the delivery}} of multiple elementary stream presentations containing audio-visual objects. These systems have been tested with the MPEG- 4 demonstration software implementation (IM 1), but are in fact generic platforms for multimedia presentation delivery. The signalling and delivery layer of these system implementations conform to the recommendations made by part 6 of the MPEG- 4 standard, Delivery Multimedia Integration Framework (DMIF). We present the issues involved in designing our streaming server for the remote retrieval and broadcast scenarios. The remote retrieval system enables interactive media streaming across the Internet through its Data and Control Planes. The implementations also include a sourcebased rate-control system, a Synchronization Layer <b>packetizer,</b> and a signalling mechanism.

40|$|Network Calculus (NC) é um conjunto de regras e resultados para {{calcular}} parâmetros de desempenho de redes de comunicações. As redes de comunicações são exemplos de Sistemas Dinâmicos a Eventos Discretos (DEDS), ou seja, sistemas cujas mudanças de estado são comandadas por eventos que ocorrem em instantes discretos. As restrições matemáticas de alguns DEDS podem ser descritas mais adequadamente usando a álgebra de dióides. Existe, portanto, uma relação entre NC e álgebra de dióides. No entanto, trabalhar em uma plataforma completamente baseada na álgebra de dióides é uma abordagem nova para o NC. Nesse contexto, as contribuições deste trabalho podem ser consideradas sob dois aspectos. Por um lado, no uso sistemático da álgebra de dióides e na definição de métodos, baseados nessa álgebra, para a modelagem e análise de desempenho de redes de comunicações. Por outro lado, nas análises desenvolvidas e resultados alcançados para alguns sistemas específicos. Como uma forma de ilustrar os métodos propostos, analisam-se componentes comuns a modelo~ de redes de comunicações, tais como: enlaces conservativos, reguladores de tráfegos, buffers de recepção e multiplexadores. Alguns resultados alcançados para esses sistemas são inovadores e menos conservativos do ql 1 e os encontrados na literaturaNetwork Calculus (NC) {{is a set}} {{of rules}} and results regarding performance parameters of communication networks. Communication networks are examples of Discrete Event Dynamic Systems (DEDS), i. e., systems whose state transitions are triggered by events that occur at discrete instants. The mathematical constraints of some DEDS can be described more adequately using the dioid algebra. Therefore, there is a relationship between NC and the dioid algebra. However, working on a framework completely based on the dioid algebra is a new approach to the NC. ln this context, the contributions of this work can be considered under two aspects. On one hand, in the systematic use of the dioid algebra and the definition of methods based on this algebra to model and analyze performance of communication networks. On the other hand, in the analysis developed and results achieved for some specific systems. To illustrate the introduced methods, some systems that are commonly faund in models af communication networks were analyzed. Among them: conservative links, traffic regulators, receive buffers (or <b>packetizers)</b> and multiplexers. Some of the results obtained for these systems are new and less conservative than those in the literatur...|$|R
40|$|Network {{calculus}} is a min-plus system theory which {{facilitates the}} efficient derivation of performance bounds for networks of queues. It has successfully {{been applied to}} provide end-to-end quality of service guarantees for integrated and differentiated services networks. Yet, a true end-to-end analysis including the various components of end systems as well as taking into account mid-boxes like firewalls, proxies, or media gateways has not been accomplished so far. The particular challenge posed by such systems are transformation processes, like data processing, compression, encoding, and decoding, which may alter data arrivals drastically. The heterogeneity, which {{is reflected in the}} granularity of operation, for example multimedia applications process video frames which, however, are represented by packets in the network, complicates the analysis further. To this end this paper evolves a concise network calculus with scaling functions, which allow modelling a wide variety of transformation processes. Combined with the concept of <b>packetizer</b> this theory enables a true end-to-end analysis of distributed systems...|$|E
40|$|Abstract [...] Radio {{astronomy}} is a non-commercial, passive user of {{the radio}} frequency spectrum. It is also the branch of fundamental scientific research that provides us with the most useful data {{on the origins of}} our universe. This paper is about a heterogeneous design, allowing us to benefit from the strengths of FPGAs. A design called the Packetized Astronomy Signal Processor, or PASP, is run on the FPGA. PASP splits up the large band into smaller bands that can be processed using off the shelf servers. The sub bands are put into packets on the FPGA and sent over a gigabit Ethernet switch to a cluster of servers. The servers receive the data from the switch and process it using spectroscopy software provided in the software package or special purpose application software written by the user and linked into the provided packet processing infrastructure. In this paper a scaled down version of spectrometers are implemented for radio astronomy applications using VHDL for Xilinx FPGA platform. The input signal is taken from Direct Digital Frequency Synthesis (DDFS) within the FPGA module. A block shall be implemented inside the FPGA to read from serial DDFS. The digitized DDFS output inside the FPGA is divided into two channels. In each channel polyphase filter bank (PFB) shall be implemented. The output of PFB is given to 64 point FFT. Both the channels spectrum output is given to <b>packetizer.</b> This output can be transmitted by any Ethernet device. Keywords—DDFS, PASP, PFB. I...|$|E
