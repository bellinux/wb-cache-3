5|$|Water {{is needed}} by many birds {{although}} their mode of excretion {{and lack of}} sweat glands reduces the physiological demands. Some desert birds can obtain their water needs entirely from moisture in their food. They may also have other adaptations such as allowing their body temperature to rise, saving on moisture loss from evaporative cooling or <b>panting.</b> Seabirds can drink seawater and have salt glands inside the head that eliminate excess salt out of the nostrils.|$|E
5|$|Many {{sleeping}} birds bend {{their heads}} over {{their backs and}} tuck their bills in their back feathers, although others place their beaks among their breast feathers. Many birds rest on one leg, while some may pull up their legs into their feathers, especially in cold weather. Perching birds have a tendon locking mechanism that helps them {{hold on to the}} perch when they are asleep. Many ground birds, such as quails and pheasants, roost in trees. A few parrots of the genus Loriculus roost hanging upside down. Some hummingbirds go into a nightly state of torpor accompanied with a reduction of their metabolic rates. This physiological adaptation shows in nearly a hundred other species, including owlet-nightjars, nightjars, and woodswallows. One species, the common poorwill, even enters a state of hibernation. Birds do not have sweat glands, but they may cool themselves by moving to shade, standing in water, <b>panting,</b> increasing their surface area, fluttering their throat or by using special behaviours like urohidrosis to cool themselves.|$|E
30|$|For <b>pants</b> {{manufacturing}} {{according to}} the <b>pants</b> style (suit <b>pants,</b> casual <b>pants),</b> most menswear brands used the pattern with included seam allowances regardless of <b>pants</b> styles (suit <b>pants,</b> 84.6 %; casual <b>pants,</b> 61.5 %). Ease on the lining patterns from the outer shell patterns ({{according to the}} typical <b>pants</b> designs such as no-pleat, one-pleat, two-pleats <b>pants)</b> were the same regardless of the <b>pants</b> style (suit <b>pants,</b> 92.3 %; casual <b>pants,</b> 84.6 %).|$|R
30|$|Second, the {{manufacturing}} comparisons and contrasts of two <b>pant</b> styles (suit <b>pants</b> and casual <b>pants)</b> {{showed that the}} amount of seam allowance from the back crotch line to the waistline in the suit <b>pants</b> varied to allow for the alteration of the waist circumference. The casual <b>pants,</b> however, had the same amount of seam allowance throughout the <b>pant.</b> Also, results showed that the menswear <b>pants</b> lining was manufactured only in the front for suit <b>pants.</b> Occasionally, the back <b>pants</b> lining was necessary for casual <b>pants.</b>|$|R
50|$|Tearaway <b>pants,</b> {{also known}} as {{breakaway}} <b>pants,</b> rip-off <b>pants,</b> or (in the UK) popper <b>pants,</b> {{are closely related to}} windpants. Tearaway <b>pants</b> are windpants with snap fasteners running the length of both legs. The snaps allow athletes to remove their tearaway <b>pants</b> in a timely manner to compete in some sports. Basketball and track and field are the two sports most commonly associated with tearaway <b>pants.</b>|$|R
25|$|The common ostrich has {{no sweat}} glands, and under heat stress {{they rely on}} <b>panting</b> to reduce their body temperature. <b>Panting</b> {{increases}} evaporative heat (and water) loss from its respiratory surfaces, therefore forcing air and heat removal without the loss of metabolic salts. <b>Panting</b> allows the common ostrich {{to have a very}} effective respiratory evaporative water loss (REWL). Heat dissipated by respiratory evaporation increases linearly with ambient temperature, matching the rate of heat production. As a result of <b>panting</b> the common ostrich should eventually experience alkalosis. However, The CO2 concentration in the blood does not change when hot ambient temperatures are experienced. This effect is caused by a lung surface shunt. The lung is not completely shunted, allowing enough oxygen to fulfill the bird’s metabolic needs. The common ostrich utilizes gular fluttering, rapid rhythmic contraction and relaxation of throat muscles, in a similar way to <b>panting.</b> Both these behaviors allow the ostrich to actively increase the rate of evaporative cooling.|$|E
25|$|<b>Panting</b> in dogs, cats, {{birds and}} some other animals {{provides}} a means of reducing body temperature, by evaporating saliva in the mouth (instead of evaporating sweat on the skin).|$|E
25|$|Many of New Zealand's best-known artists {{came from}} or live in Palmerston North. The list {{includes}} Rita Angus, John Bevan Ford, Shane Cotton, Paul Dibble, Pat Hanly, Brent Harris, Bob Jahnke, John <b>Panting,</b> Carl Sydow and Tim Wilson.|$|E
30|$|Increasing {{interest}} in men’s fashion {{upon entering the}} 21 st century {{has led to a}} steady growth in the menswear market. When it comes to garments for {{the lower part of the}} body, <b>pants</b> are the most common item for menswear compared to womenswear, which includes both skirts and <b>pants</b> (Kim and Kim 2014). For upper-body garments, there are many items, such as shirts, T-shirts, sweaters, vests, jackets, and coats. However, for the men’s lower garments, <b>pants</b> are the most common. With the high fashion interest, menswear <b>pants</b> designs have become varied; from the typical suit <b>pants</b> (with no pleat, one pleat, and two pleats on the front) to casual <b>pants</b> (denim <b>pants,</b> cargo <b>pants,</b> baggy <b>pants,</b> and sports <b>pants,</b> etc.).|$|R
50|$|Similar <b>pants</b> {{are also}} known as dimije, tshalvar, schalwar, salwar kameez, kaccha, patiala salwar, shintijan, sirwal, sharovary, aladdin <b>pants,</b> balloon <b>pants,</b> drop crotch <b>pants,</b> pantaloons, zouave, pluderhose and pumphose.|$|R
50|$|The Bears' <b>pants</b> have {{substantially}} {{remained the}} same throughout, with blue <b>pants</b> having orange and white stripes, as well as white <b>pants</b> with blue and orange stripes. The team normally wears their blue <b>pants</b> with their away jerseys, and white <b>pants</b> at home. The addition of navy blue <b>pants</b> {{as a part of}} the road kit came in 1984. For a few games in the 1930s the Bears wore a combination of orange jerseys and orange <b>pants.</b>|$|R
25|$|Ponies' coats easily became {{soaked with}} {{perspiration}} during exertion, thus necessitating constant attention with blankets to avoid hypothermia through evaporation. Dogs in contrast {{do not have}} sweat glands—they cool themselves via <b>panting,</b> making them less vulnerable to the cold. With ponies, Scott acknowledged he could not depart until 1 November 1911 when the weather would be warmer, leaving him less time to complete the journey.|$|E
25|$|Kirk's dik-diks {{are highly}} adapted to {{surviving}} in the arid regions of eastern Africa. They have a hairy proboscis with tiny slit-like nostrils, {{a feature that}} is most pronounced in the Guenther's dik-dik. This proboscis contains an enlarged nasal chamber that is supplied with a rich amount of blood that is cooled via rapid nasal <b>panting.</b> <b>Panting</b> through their snouts leads to airflow and evaporation that cools the blood before it is pumped back into the body.2 This process is also efficient, because it results in a minimal loss {{of water in the}} exhaled air. Water and energy conserving methods, such as fluctuating body temperatures, lowered metabolic rates, concentrated urine, and dry feces all contribute to the ability of the dik-dik to survive harsh arid climates. Further, as observed by Hoppe 1977b, Kamau 1988, and Maloiy et al., 1988, they also conserve fluids by licking dew from their nose and reabsorbing water from their feces. When compared to cattle, dik-dik have a significantly lower density of sweat glands.|$|E
25|$|The dog or cat {{may show}} {{a great variety}} of signs that may be very subtle in the early stages. Early signs include lethargy, loss of appetite, {{apparent}} groaning when lifted, altered voice (bark/meow), noisy <b>panting,</b> coughing, drooling of saliva, gagging, regurgitation (dogs) and enlarged pupils (cats). Occasionally a single limb may appear to be weak or lame. A tick attached {{to the side of the}} face may cause loss of blink reflex, corneal ulceration and an ocular discharge. A tick attached near the anus can cause anal incontinence.|$|E
40|$|This study aims {{to compare}} the ease of men’s single-pleated <b>pants</b> patterns, and to analyze the fit and {{appearance}} through the 3 D virtual garment system. The researchers selected five(four educational materials and one industrial pattern) slim-fit single-pleated <b>pants</b> which is the current fashion trend in menswear. The CLO 3 D Modelist program was utilized {{to carry out the}} appearance evaluation through virtual wearing, opacity, and clothing pressure. The results showed that D <b>pants</b> had the greatest ease on the waist circumference, while C <b>pants</b> had the least ease. The E <b>pants</b> had the greatest ease on the hip circumference, then B <b>pants</b> and C <b>pants</b> showed less ease. Also, the E <b>pants</b> had the longest on the <b>pants</b> length, then D <b>pants</b> showed the shortest. In the appearance evaluation, A <b>pants</b> received the most favorable results, followed by D, B, E, and C <b>pants,</b> in descending order. The clothing pressure appeared to be mainly red on the waist, crotch, and hem in all <b>pants,</b> so the clothing pressure was high. From the results, we can understand that each of the 5 single-pleated <b>pants</b> patterns has different ease amount and silhouette...|$|R
50|$|There {{are many}} {{variations}} on the sweatpant design that have evolved to define their own categories of athletic <b>pants.</b> These variations include fashion <b>pants,</b> windpants, tearaway <b>pants,</b> and muscle <b>pants.</b>|$|R
30|$|There were {{interesting}} {{differences between}} the suit <b>pants</b> and the casual <b>pants</b> in seam allowances from the back crotch curve to the waistline. The suit <b>pants</b> pattern had different seam allowances throughout the garment (100 %, 13 out of 13), while the casual <b>pants</b> pattern used the same amount throughout (53.8 %, 7 out of 13). There could be several reasons for the differences: the price of suit <b>pants</b> {{is higher than the}} casual <b>pants,</b> so consumers would want to wear the suit <b>pants</b> {{for a longer period of}} time. In this case, individual alterations to the <b>pants</b> can take place as needed, since one’s body shape, especially the waist circumference, changes with age. The seam allowance for suit <b>pants</b> near the hip line, 1 – 1.3  cm, was increased to 2.5 – 3.0  cm on the waistline to prepare for the individual alteration. In contrast, the casual <b>pants</b> used the same 1 – 1.3  cm seam allowances on all areas of the garment, because alterations are not as common for casual <b>pants.</b> Consequently, the waistband shape on the center back line was different between the two <b>pant</b> types. The suit <b>pants</b> potentially need to be altered, while casual <b>pants</b> do not. The suit <b>pants</b> had a seam on the center back of the waistband and the casual <b>pants</b> had seamless center back line.|$|R
25|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that 'QC over-identifies with an 'exotic' militant punk persona to interrogate category-driven capitalist networks, through staging and virally inserting her artistic practice within pop culture, traversing music venues, forging protests and entering art galleries in order to emulate and interrupt the operations of these cultural zones'. Quilla Constance stages interventions across an interdisciplinary practice of paintings, lectures, photographs, live performances, costumes and music videos. Her live performance work has been noted for its 'unflinching physical narrative performed entirely through breath, posture and non-verbal sounds: <b>panting</b> like a dog, sex noises, then laughter, pure guttural anger, and back again'.|$|E
25|$|The {{increase}} in respiration rate {{from the low}} range to the high range is sudden and occurs in response to hyperthermia. Birds lack sweat glands, so when placed under stress due to heat, they heavily rely upon increased evaporation from the respiratory system for heat transfer. This rise in respiration rate however is not necessarily associated with a greater rate of oxygen consumption. Therefore, unlike other birds, the common ostrich is able to dissipate heat through <b>panting</b> without experiencing respiratory alkalosis by modifying ventilation of the respiratory medium. During hyperpnea ostriches pant at a respiratory rate of 40–60 cycles per minute, versus their resting rate of 6–12 cycles per minute. Hot, dry and moisture lacking properties of the common ostrich respiratory medium affects oxygen's diffusion rate (Henry's Law).|$|E
25|$|Chimpanzees, gorillas, and orangutans show laughter-like vocalizations in {{response}} to physical contact, such as wrestling, play-chasing, or tickling. This is documented in wild and captive chimpanzees. Common chimpanzee laughter is not readily recognisable to humans as such, because it is generated by alternating inhalations and exhalations that sound more like breathing and <b>panting.</b> Instances in which nonhuman primates have expressed joy have been reported. One study analyzed and recorded sounds made by human babies and bonobos when tickled. Although the bonobo's laugh was a higher frequency, the laugh followed a pattern {{similar to that of}} human babies and included similar facial expressions. Humans and chimpanzees share similar ticklish areas of the body, such as the armpits and belly. The enjoyment of tickling in chimpanzees does not diminish with age.|$|E

30|$|Results of {{this survey}} showed that the <b>pants</b> lining {{patterns}} were {{not the same as}} the outer shell pattern size. In addition, specific shifting degrees on the <b>pants</b> lining patterns were not simple, whether it is the suit <b>pants</b> or casual <b>pants.</b> Especially, for the casual <b>pants,</b> the length of back lining fit into two categories either knee length or crotch length. Manufacturers of men’s <b>pants</b> should consider these specific results to save time and cost when manufacturing both styles of <b>pants.</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of 3 D virtual fitting technology when visualizing the fit and silhouette of <b>pants</b> {{by analyzing the}} similarities between real and virtual fit using 20 fit locations, 3 lower body shapes, and fit status was investigated. We produced 61 custom <b>pants</b> for the participants and virtually tried each on a personalized 3 D body scan avatar. The technology was not generally effective for visualizing <b>pant</b> fit. Especially, the waist placement of the virtual <b>pants</b> was lower than that for the actual <b>pants.</b> The virtual software indicated less ease than the actual <b>pants</b> and could not express stress folds due to slight misfit. The front silhouette of the virtual <b>pants</b> spread wider than the real <b>pants.</b> The virtual <b>pants</b> for females with a hip tilt shape had the greatest divergence from the actual <b>pants.</b> The virtual <b>pants</b> with good fit appeared more effectively than did those with poor fit...|$|R
25|$|Heat stroke {{can occur}} in dogs, {{especially}} in flat-faced breeds such as the Bulldog or in giant breeds. Breed, lack of water, exercise, and high ambient temperature predispose dogs to heat stroke. Signs include vomiting, diarrhea, collapse, difficulty breathing, and body temperature approaching 42°C to 43°C. Treatment includes cooling the dogs with wet towels and fans, intravenous fluid therapy, and other supportive care. If a dog's temperature begin to drop to around 40°C, stop the cooling process. Once a dog’s body begins to cool, it can drop quickly and getting them too cool can create different problems. Allow the dog {{only a couple of}} laps of water until their temperature begins to drop to a more normal level. Do not allow a dog to gulp large quantities of water. If a dog is <b>panting</b> excessively and then drinks a lot of water, he will swallow large amounts of air with the water and this can cause an equally life-threatening case of gastric dilatation volvulus (bloat) in their stomach.|$|E
25|$|Acromegaly (also {{known as}} hypersomatotropism) is a {{hormonal}} condition resulting from over-secretion {{of the growth}} hormone somatotropin from the pituitary gland. The hormone is responsible for growth from birth to adulthood. Normally in adulthood, the growth plates of the bones close and the secretion of the hormone slows considerably. Because the bone plates close when entering maturity, the continued growth of acromegaly is not of normal proportions. Most dogs with the disease are unspayed females, but the condition can come about with use of medications containing progesterone. Acromegaly patients often also have diabetes mellitus. There is a transient form of acromegaly which can affect females at the diestrus portion of the reproductive cycle. This condition is {{brought about by the}} mammary glands excreting excess growth hormone, which is triggered by progesterone from the ovaries. As with non-transient acromegaly, spaying is necessary. The symptoms can include overgrowth or enlargement of gums with wide spaces between teeth, increased drinking, increased urination, thickening of the skin and skin folds, enlargement of the tongue and excessive <b>panting.</b> Acromegaly is also possible from a somatotroph adenoma. The hormone somatostatin can also be useful in treatment. Since hypothyroidism is connected with the release of excess growth hormone, hypothyroidism can be mistaken for acromegaly.|$|E

30|$|This study aims {{to survey}} the <b>pants</b> lining {{manufacturing}} of menswear brands and to provide practical data for developing the <b>pants</b> lining pattern. The researchers collected data by interviewing patternmakers of thirteen menswear brands in Korea. The {{results of this study}} are as follows: first, 69.2 % of menswear brands provide the <b>pants</b> lining pattern to the garment factory. Important factors in the patternmaking methods for the lining were the <b>pant</b> styles and the outer shell fabric’s degree of stretch. Second, for manufacturing comparisons according to the <b>pant</b> style, the seam allowance from the back crotch line to the waistline showed that suit <b>pants</b> had varied seam allowance throughout the <b>pant,</b> while casual <b>pants</b> had the same seam allowance throughout the <b>pant.</b> Also, results showed that menswear <b>pants</b> lining were manufactured only in the front for the suit <b>pants</b> lining. Third, ease in the <b>pants</b> lining pattern the waist, hip, and thigh were the same 0.75  cm. Due to the specific shifting amount in ease, the lining pattern increases in size. The length of the back could be adjusted whether the length is below the crotch level or below the knee level. Therefore, this study suggests that when the <b>pants</b> lining is manufactured, the manufacturer should consider these results to develop the proper <b>pants</b> lining pattern, a task equally important as the outer shell pattern.|$|R
