40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{shock-absorbing}} properties of a banking union {{by providing a}} detailed comparison between the way regional financial shocks have been absorbed {{at the federal level}} in the US, but have led to severe regional (national) financial dislocation and tensions in Europe and particularly in the euro area. The institutions of the banking union, which is now emerging in the euro area, should increase its capacity to deal with future regional boom and bust cycles. Cross-border capital flows in the form of equity appear to be much more stable than those taking the form of credit, especially inter-bank credit. It therefore follows that cross-border banks would be useful to deal with regional shocks. But large banks pose the 'too big to fail' problem and they would also <b>propagate</b> <b>regional</b> shocks, especially if they originate in large countries, to the entire area.

40|$|Thermal {{responses}} of inland waters {{to climate change}} varies on global and regional scales. The extent of warming is determined by system-specific characteristics such as fluvial input. Here we {{examine the impact of}} ongoing climate change on two alpine tributaries, the Aare River and the Rhône River, and their respective downstream peri-alpine lakes: Lake Biel and Lake Geneva. We <b>propagate</b> <b>regional</b> atmospheric temperature effects into river discharge projections. These, together with anthropogenic heat sources, are in turn incorporated into simple and efficient deterministic models that predict future water temperatures, river-borne suspended sediment concentration (SSC), lake stratification and river intrusion depth/volume in the lakes. Climate-induced shifts in river discharge regimes, including seasonal flow variations, act as positive and negative feedbacks in influencing river water temperature and SSC. Differences in temperature and heating regimes between rivers and lakes in turn result in large seasonal shifts in warming of downstream lakes. The extent of this repressive effect on warming is controlled by the lakes hydraulic residence time. Previous studies suggest that climate change will diminish deep-water oxygen renewal in lakes. We find that climate-related seasonal variations in river temperatures and SSC shift deep penetrating river intrusions from summer towards winter. Thus potentially counteracting the otherwise negative effects associated with climate change on deep-water oxygen content. Our findings provide a template for evaluating the response of similar hydrologic systems to on-going climate change...|$|R

Repealed in 1790 by the National Assembly in the midst of the French Revolution, the gabelle was later reinstated by Napoleon Bonaparte in 1806.

40|$|Three {{distinct}} sets of graben {{are associated}} with the volcano Alba Patera on Mars. One set, approximately circumferential to the edifice, has long been accepted to have formed as a tectonic response to an extensional stress regime associated with the evolution of the Alba Patera edifice. A second set includes mainly linear structures interpreted by many workers to have formed in response to very large-scale regional stresses. We infer that the third set of graben, all of which are relatively linear, none of which are strictly parallel to members of the second set, and many of which contain numerous pit craters, formed above long (∼ 1000 km), laterally <b>propagating</b> <b>regional</b> dikes emanating from a volcanic center located to the south within the Tharsis region. The expected geometries of such dikes (several hundred meters depth to dike top, ∼ 20 km depth to dike base, mean dike width ∼ 30 – 90 m) are modeled on the assumption that they were fed from a shallow magma reservoir centered on a neutral buoyancy horizon, expected to be present at a depth of ∼ 10 km on Mars. The volumes of magma in the dikes are consistent with a reservoir similar in size to those inferred to be present under the Tharsis shield volcanoes provided that the dikes were emplaced during caldera collapse episodes. The sizes of the graben associated with these dikes are consistent with the relaxation, during or immediately after dike emplacement, of preexisting regional extensional stresses of a few tens of MPa...|$|R

40|$|American poet Robert Frost (1874 - 1963) {{was born}} in San Francisco, California. After {{the death of his}} father, the family moved to New England, which {{provided}} the backdrop for Frost's trademark <b>regional</b> <b>poetry.</b> Frost briefly attended both Dartmouth College and Harvard University but did not earn a degree. Frost initially encountered difficulties in establishing himself as a published poet in American newspapers and literary journals. After little success in America, Frost and his family moved to England for three years, which proved to be more fertile publishing ground. By the time he returned to the United States in 1915, Frost had published two well-received full-length collections, A Boy's Will (1913) and North of Boston (1914), which solidified his reputation on both continents. By the 1920 s, he was the most celebrated poet in America. Frost was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for literature four times: for New Hampshire (1923), Collected Poems (1930), A Further Range (1936), and A Witness Tree (1942). Frost received more than forty honorary degrees from colleges and universities, including Oxford and Cambridge Universities, Amherst College, and the University of Michigan.

40|$|The rapid expansion, wider {{distribution}} and increased readership of print {{media in the}} latter half of the nineteenth century helped to foster the process that has been described as the nationalisation of English culture. In a parallel process, however, the same media could also be deployed to construct and to <b>propagate</b> <b>regional</b> cultures and identities. This thesis, concentrating on the period c. 1850 - 1918, uses Yorkshire as a case study. The employment of county boundaries and structures as a delimitation for historical research can be questioned. But it is defensible in the case of the cultural study of a county that, in spite of its size, heterogeneity and industrial transformation, had acquired a set of identities and stereotypes which evolved during the early-modern period and were retained, refined and celebrated in the industrial age. Although it had no political basis, Yorkshireness remained a powerful sub-identity within England, the United Kingdom and the wider British world. By examining the newspaper press, weekly periodicals, dialect almanacs and regional fiction, the thesis explores the evolution and the dissemination of Yorkshire’s cultural identity in an age of popular print. There is also an analysis of attempts to find a deterministic basis for Yorkshire character and a description of county societies in the UK and overseas. The evolution of folkloristic Yorkshire identities and symbols is traced, and illustrated dialect postcards of the early-twentieth century are analysed, on the grounds that they were a widely-transmitted source of Yorkshire stereotypes. Individuals who played a role in the construction of Yorkshireness include the writer James Burnley, the folklorist and humorist Richard Blakeborough, the novelists Halliwell Sutcliffe and William Riley, the dialect writers Charles Rogers and John Hartley, the cartoonist Arthur North and the University of Leeds academic Professor Frederic Moorman, who conceived the project for eisteddfod equivalents in Yorkshire. The conclusion is that Victorian and Edwardian print media and illustrated ephemera were used extensively to construct and convey a sense of Yorkshireness, acting as a countervailing force to the tendency towards nationalisation of culture, and that in the absence of a fully negotiated concept of universal Englishness, county identity was an important factor at home and overseas.

40|$|The Torfajökull central volcano {{in south-central}} Iceland {{contains}} the largest volume of exposed silicic extrusives in Iceland (∼ 225 km^ 3). Within SW-Torfajökull, postglacial mildly alkalic to peralkalic silicic lavas and lava domes (67 – 74 wt. % SiO_ 2) have erupted {{from a family}} of fissures 1 – 2. 5 km apart within or just outside a large caldera (12 × 18 km). The silicic lavas show a fissure-dependent variation in composition, and form five chemically distinct units. The lavas are of low crystallinity (0 – 7 vol. %) and contain phenocrysts in the following order of decreasing abundance: plagioclase (An_(10 - 40)), Na-rich anorthoclase (<Or_(23)), clinopyroxene (Fs_(37 - 20)), FeTi oxides (Usp_(32 - 60); Ilm_(93 - 88)), hornblende (edenitic–ferroedenitic) and olivine (Fo_(22 - 37)), with apatite, pyrrhotite and zircon as accessory phases. The phenocryst assemblage (0. 2 – 4. 0 mm) consistently exhibits pervasive disequilibrium with the host melt (glass). Xenoliths include sparse, disaggregated, and partially fused leucocratic fragments as well as amphibole-bearing rocks of broadly intermediate composition. The δ^(18) O values of the silicic lavas are in the range 3. 6 – 4. 4, and these are lower than the δ^(18) O values of comagmatic, contemporaneous basaltic extrusives within SW-Torfajökull, implying that the former can not be derived from the latter by simple fractional crystallization. FeTi-oxide geothermometry reveals temperatures as low as 750 – 800 °C. To explain the fissure-dependent chemical variations, ^(18) O depletions, low FeTi-oxide temperatures and pervasive crystal-melt disequilibrium, we propose the extraction and collection of small parcels of silicic melt from originally heterogeneous basaltic crustal rock through heterogeneous melting and wall rock collapse (solidification front instability, SFI). The original compositional heterogeneity of the source rock is due to (1) silicic segregations, in the form of pods and lenses characteristically formed in the upper parts of gabbroic intrusives, and (2) extreme isostatic subsidence of the earlier, less differentiated lavas of the Torfajökull central volcano. Ridge migration into older crustal terranes, coupled with establishment of concentrated volcanism at central volcanoes like Torfajökull due to <b>propagating</b> <b>regional</b> fissure swarms, supplies the heat source for this overall process. Continued magmatism in these fissures promotes extensive prograde heating of older crust and the progressive vitality and rise of the central volcano magmatic system that leads to, respectively, SFI and subsidence melting. The ensuing silicic melts (with relict crystals) are extracted, collected and extruded before reaching complete internal equilibrium. Chemically, this appears as a two-stage process of crystal fractionation. In general, the accumulation of high-temperature basaltic magmas at shallow depths beneath the Icelandic rift zones and major central volcanoes, coupled with unique tectonic conditions, allows large-scale reprocessing and recycling of the low-δ^(18) O, hydrothermally altered Icelandic crust. The end result is a compositionally bimodal proto-continental crust...|$|R
40|$|Colors, textures, lines, shapes, {{and forms}} are all rich visual elements-and, perhaps, no more {{honestly}} open to discovery {{than in the}} seeming infinity of the heavens above. But if one stares at the sky uninterruptedly for a long time, things may seem to start to come unbuttoned. No matter what riches nature provides for the human eye or the camera lens, it is always important to recognize the human perspective in the process. By paying heed to the horizon line and constantly referencing {{the fact that one}} 2 ̆ 7 s feet (or the camera 2 ̆ 7 s tripod) are planted firmly upon the earth, Wyman Meinzer allows us to experience most completely the complexities and subtleties of the world above us all. The artist knows this intuitively, of course, having trod many miles to find these natural elements and work his photographic vision with the light that reveals· all their elegant detail and emotive richness. Meinzer has worked this magic before in countless earlier books and prints, but it is throughout this volume that he is able to display most elegantly both his assured technique and his emotional honesty. With Between Heaven and Texas he honors earth and sky, of course, but above all he recognizes how the very act of photography forces both artist and viewer to connect with the world itself. To provide a deeper resonance to his words and images, Sarah Bird-one of the state 2 ̆ 7 s great novelists and essayists-provides a moving memoir on clouds and skies, reflecting upon 2 ̆ 2 how my thoughts soared here in this land with no lid. Forced to reach out to distant clouds, the range of my dreams increased as well.... 2 ̆ 2 Combined with <b>regional</b> <b>poetry</b> selected by Texas 2 ̆ 7 s finest living poet, Naomi Shihab Nye, the entire volume is a beautiful journey in which photographs and words, even more than complementary, become incalculably satisfying. Meinzer speaks of the 2 ̆ 2 frontier 2 ̆ 2 of the sky, and as one views the majestic images he has created it becomes evident that he invests that description with the same sense of history, emotion, and cultural dynamism that historians like Webb and geographers like Jackson have also invoked in their descriptions of Plains and people. More than a relationship, it becomes, through this photographer 2 ̆ 7 s eloquent eye, an important passage we are all invited to make with him. Meinzer, like countless pioneers of land and ideas before him, never forgets where he is standing and makes us see anew what William A. Quayle noted a century ago: 2 ̆ 2 The prairie path leads to the sky path; the paths are one: the continents are two; and you must make your journeys from the prairies to the sky. 2 ̆...|$|R
