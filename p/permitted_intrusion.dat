40|$|Approximately 180 diapirs {{define a}} 500 km belt {{coincident}} with the Flinders-Mount Lofty Ranges. New observations on these structures are prefaced by {{reviews of the}} concept of diapirism in general and of the history and regional geological setting of the province - the Adelaide 'Geosyncline'. The proposed model for diapirism in the 'Geosyncline' is based on a detailed map of the Arkaba Diapir. Primary control of diapir distribution in the trough can be related to fracture patterns in the pre-source-bed rocks. Outcrop of diapiric material is distinctive over a wide area, and may be accentuated by patterns of vegetation. Weathering is deep and intense but cap-rock or solution megabreccias arc absent. Typical forms are very complex, varying from massifs, domes, dykes, and plugs, shapes that have been controlled by host-rock anisotropy, notably patterns of fracture. Diapir/host-rock contacts are invariably abrupt and coincide with planes of weakness in the host. The contacts, despite sculpting and quarrying by invading diapiric material, can often be matched in 'continental drift' type reconstructions across the cores. Host strata are rarely brecciated or upturned against a diapir, Illustrating the passive nature of the intrusions. Where such deformation occurs, it usually pre-dates diapirism and is due to faulting. <b>Permitted</b> <b>intrusion</b> under local extension in the cover, plausibly induced by regional compression, is implied, Alteration of host-rock adjacent to contacts is absent but for minor dolomitization in certain zones. The intrusive material is an intensely mixed chaotic breccia but one which includes many well rounded and subsphericalxenoclasts, from kilometres across to the finest dust. The size spectrum appears to obey Rosin's Law of Crushing. The breccias, but for rare basement and host-rock xenoclasts, involve a restricted and characteristic range of shallow-marine lithologies including terrigenous clastics, carbonates (especially dolostones), and saline evaporites. This suite may well be assigned to the Callanna Beds of Late Precambrian age. Petrographic studies have revealed a suite of metamorphic minerals, notably carbonate, chlorite, clay, felspar, haematite, magnesioriebeckite, quartz, stilpnomelane, and talc, developed in the core rocks. All mineral components may reasonably have been derived by simple processes entirely from rocks of the type that comprise typical xenoclasts. Many reactions involved dedolomitization and/or saline evaporates. A low pressure, hypersaline, aqueous, oxidative metamorphic environment (zeolite facies) is indicated; replete with C 0 ₂, open-system, and low temperature (150 °C- 250 °C- 300 °C). Affinities are with natural hydrothermal and geothermal systems. Igneous rocks {{with a wide range of}} ages occur in the cores and include both intrusive and extrusive types, mainly basic to intermediate in character. They are essentially xenoclastic but include some in situ post-diapiric intrusions. The occurrence of igneous rock is fortuitous and non-essential to diapirism. Typical breccias have a banded fabric and other features such as the shaping, disruption, mixing, and alignment of xenoclasts that must be attributed to flow. Movement was slow, rather passive, and plug-like, described by non-Newtonian, Andradean law. Mobility of the source material, rather than factors such as density, was paramount to diapirism. The mobility is explained by the former presence of saline evaporites in the interstices of the breccias and by appeal to the concepts of dilatancy, fluidization, and rheidity. The overburden was relatively brittle, its weight the prime driving force to the intrusions. Emplacement was at least partly syn-tectonic, linked to pulses of deformation of the cover, as well as to basement evolution in the 'Geosyncline'. Decollement at the source layer is implied. The host was not explosively breached in the manner of a diatreme; the diapirs are not carbonatites. Although further problems have been outlined, a study of diapirs in the Flinders-Mount Lofty Ranges has clarified many aspects of the global theory. The essence of the new observations is embodied in a proposed classification of intrusions that includes diapirs. Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Adelaide, Department of Geology, 197...|$|E

40|$|Can {{international}} law regulate global surveillance programs without sacrificing national security interests? In {{the face of}} unprecedented global terrorist activity, this question takes on a near existential character: intercepting a chat room exchange between accomplices in Syria and California can {{be the difference between}} timely arrest and mass slaughter. Despite the practical importance of the question, scholarly engagement with it so far has failed to provide realistic guidance for the appraisal of global surveillance activity. Part of the literature submits that global intelligence programs operate beyond the grasp of legal constraint, thus dooming us to a bleak Orwellian future. The remainder proposes human rights-based solutions expressly rejected by the US, France, Russia, and China, thus erasing the already faint line between {{international law}} and wishful thinking. This Article for the first time develops that the question can be answered by theorizing the existence of a general principle of law, the Privacy Principle. The Article establishes the Privacy Principle by means of a comparative analysis of the private laws of core states with significant signals intelligence capabilities – the United States, France, Russia, China, Israel, and Iran. This analysis reveals that (1) there is general agreement upon the existence of a right to privacy prohibiting physical or virtual surveillance of people when in private; (2) “privacy” can be theorized in terms of reasonable expectations of seclusion as defined by the twin factors of the physical or virtual space affected and the intimacy of the information at issue; and (3) the “right to privacy” invariably weighs such reasonable expectations of seclusion against the public interest, <b>permitting</b> <b>intrusions</b> when they are proportionate to all relevant interests at stake. The Article demonstrates that the Privacy Principle is part of general international law. It explains how approaching privacy {{from the perspective of a}} general principle avoids the methodological pitfalls encountered by the current literature. It finally showcases how the application of the Privacy Principle to global surveillance programs is responsive to today 2 ̆ 7 s national security needs: the Privacy Principle prohibits the dragnet collection of data from private persons.

40|$|In the Karakoram Ridge of NW India, the Tangtse gorge {{cuts across}} deep crustal rocks exhumed by transpression along two strands of the dextral Karakoram fault. Crustal leucogranitic magmas prevasively intruded amphibolites and migmatites {{in the form}} of sheets that locally {{coalesced}} and expanded to form kilometre-scale plutons. Sheets resulted from slop seeping of granite into folidation planes (magmas wedging) rather than from dyking, driven by magmas buoyancy and possible syn-intrusive tectonic deformation. High temperature of the country rocks at the time of intrusion is inferred from similar crystallization ages of the intrusive leucogranite and in situ partial melt in the migmatites, and reflected in the ductile structures developed. Whereas low country rock viscosity inhibited dyking, high temperature freed the magmas from the constraints of freezing and <b>permitted</b> pervasive <b>intrusion.</b> The injection complex exposed along the Tangtse gorge, rather than representing the final emplacement structures, represent transient structures of the granite pathways on their upward journey tobuild the Karakoram batholith, which crops out a few kilometres north, at structurally shallower levels. We suggest that pervasive magmas flow is a transitional step between magma segregation at the source and later rise through cold crust and it may be one of several factors controlling whether dyking or diapirism becomes dominant during late ascent...|$|R

40|$|Leucogranite crops out in {{the upper}} Imja Khola, Khumbu Himalaya, Nepal, where it makes up {{approximately}} 50 % of the exposed bedrock. Leucogranites and their associated aplite-pegmatites typically intruded as concordant sills, millimeters- to kilometers-wide. The exceptional Nuptse granite is an ellipsoidal pluton of nearly 1 -km radius, which probably resulted from the ballooning of a sill and is wrapped in concordant country rock foliation. Small-scale structures and mineral paragenesis indicate syntectonic intrusion into high temperature-low pressure sillimanite + muscovite ± cordierite-bearing country rocks. Penetrative deformation of the country rock and sills is characterized by foliation striking N 60 °E/ 40 °NW and by north-northwest-plunging mineral lineation subparallel to fold axes of decimeter- to meter-scale isoclinal folds and centimeter- to decimeter-scale kink folds and crenulation. A volatile-rich phase played {{a fundamental role in}} the development of the Imja Khola leucogranites. It was responsible not only for pegmatitic rocks but also for autometasomatism producing (1) late growth of poikiloblastic K-feldspar megacrysts; (2) millimeter-wide microveins of albite, which replaced magmatic quartz, plagioclase, and K-feldspar; and (3) growth of tourmaline in schist. The metasomatic origin of K-feldspar poikiloblasts is supported by textural evidence and K/Na and Ba profiles. The volatile-rich phase also played a fundamental role in assisting leucogranite migration. The low viscosity and high pressure of the aqueous phase enabled it to pervade, to disrupt, and to heat up the country rock, giving rise to pathways that <b>permitted</b> the <b>intrusion</b> of the much stiffer magmatic phases...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to {{describe}} the use of a new trans-alveolar screw (TAS) as a temporary orthodontic anchorage device for the posterior maxilla, to intrude overerupted maxillary molars.

The TAS is cheap, easy to place and remove by the orthodontist, has bicortical anchorage, and is loaded on both sides. The main advantage of TAS is that when placed in the maxilla to intrude upper molars, it allows application of intrusive force from both buccal and palatal aspects simultaneously, so that the line of force in relation to the center of resistance of the posterior segment, <b>permits</b> an in-mass <b>intrusion,</b> avoiding buccal tipping or rotations.

40|$|Central steam is {{commonly}} distributed through direct burial lines protected by an outer conduit. These underground conduit systems {{are subject to}} electrolytic corrosion. Failure of the outer casing <b>permits</b> water <b>intrusion</b> and damage to insulation, resulting in increased thermal energy losses and eventual damage to the steam line. Breaches in the outer conduit are difficult to locate, and damage to the steam line may progress until the entire line requires replacement. Thermal energy losses are high if groundwater infiltrates the conduit and excavation to replace the steam line is extremely expensive. Locating leaks in steam line conduit is a two step procedure. The {{first step is to}} regularly pressure test sections of conduit to determine whether a breach has occurred. Pressure testing should be performed on a regular basis to minimize thermal losses and damage from groundwater intrusion. If pressure testing reveals that the conduit is leaking, the Navy has developed a procedure and equipment to determine where the breach occurred. The breach can be detected using sulfur hexafluoride (SF 6) tracer gas injected into the conduit. After injection, maintenance personnel walk the path of the steam line with an SF 6 detector that precisely locates the leak. Then, only the necessary conduit sections are excavated for repair. We have successfully used this system at several locations, and in a variety of soil conditions. Tracer gas leak testing provides an effective and inexpensive method to evaluate underground conduit systems. Performed on a regular basis, it is a useful preventive maintenance tool to minimize energy loss and utility system damage. Test results also provide valuable input to the decision to repair or replace underground steam lines. This equipment and procedure may be used on other utility system distribution components, such as compressed air and direct burial steam lines...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe Northern Mediterranean Current is {{the return}} {{branch of the}} {{cyclonic}} circulation of the northwestern Mediterranean Sea. Because of geostrophic constraints, this warm and oligotrophic current is forced to flow westward along the continental slope of the Gulf of Lion. But, occasionally, it penetrates on the shelf and strongly impacts the local biogeochemistry and in turn the primary production. By combining in situ observations and high-resolution modelling, it is shown that intrusions on {{the eastern part of}} the gulf are mainly forced by easterly or northwesterly wind events, through physical mechanisms that are very different in nature. Easterlies induce a piling of water along the Gulf of Lion coast that drives, through geostrophy, an alongshore shelf-intruding current. This intrusive current occurs independently of the stratification and is concomitant with the wind forcing. On the other hand, intrusions due to northwesterlies only occur during stratified conditions and are related to the development of upwellings along the Gulf of Lion coasts. When the upwelling develops, a northwestward alongshore pressure force balances the Coriolis force associated with the onshore flow at depth. When the winds drop, the upwelling relaxes and the onshore flow weakens. Consequently, the Coriolis force no longer counterbalances the pressure force that ultimately dominates the momentum balance, causing the displacement of the Northern Current on the Gulf of Lion shelf approximately 1 day after the wind relaxation. This time lag between the northwesterlies decrease and the <b>intrusions</b> <b>permits</b> to anticipate possible changes in the biogeochemistry of the Gulf of Lion...|$|R

It is characterized by hornblende-gabbros, gabbronorites, monzodiorites and granitic plutonic rocks. The exceptional exposure of the <b>intrusion</b> <b>permits</b> the identification of two structurally and petrographically different zones. Layered gabbronorite, olivine-bearing pyroxene-hornblende gabbronorite and monzodiorite forming vertical sheets and stocks in the west are referred to here as the feeder zone. These mafic rocks are in vertical contact with younger granitic rocks on their eastern border. The eastern part is a laccolith complex. It is characterized by three major units (I, II, III) of granitic rocks of over 1000 m vertical thickness; these are underlain in places by a sequence of hornblende-gabbro sills intermingled with evolved monzodiorite granite. Chilled, crenulated margins as well as flame structures between gabbroic rocks and monzodiorites suggest that the mafic sill complex remained partially molten during most of its construction. Bulk-rock major and trace element data indicate that the Paine mafic rocks follow a high-K calc-alkaline to shoshonitic differentiation trend. The parental magmas were basaltic trachyandesite liquids, with variable H 2 O and alkali contents. The majority of the feeder zone gabbronorites have high Al 2 O 3 contents and positive Eu and Sr anomalies, consistent with accumulation of plagioclase and efficient extraction of intercumulus melt. The mafic sill complex largely lacks these cumulate signatures. Comparisons of the intercumulus groundmass in the hornblende-gabbros with intra-sill dioritic stocks and pods reveal similar rare earth element patterns and trace element ratios indicating incomplete extraction of evolved interstitial liquids. The Sr, Nd and Pb isotopic compositions of the mafic and granitic rocks exhibit ranges of 87 Sr/ 86 Sr of 0 · 704 - 0 · 708, εNd + 3 · 8 to − 1 · 2, 206 Pb/ 204 Pb 18 · 61 - 18 · 77, 207 Pb/ 204 Pb 15 · 67 - 15 · 67 and 208 Pb/ 204 Pb 38 · 56 - 38 · 77. Crystal fractionation and assimilation-fractional crystallization modelling, combined with high-precision U-Pb dating of zircons, indicates that the western feeder zone gabbronorites {{are linked to the}} uppermost Paine granite (granite I), whereas the mafic sill complex is younger and not directly related to the voluminous granite units II and III. These results are interpreted to indicate that crystal-liquid separation is facilitated in subvertical, dynamic feeder systems whereas subhorizontal sill complexes are inefficient in separating large volumes of mafic cumulates and complementary felsic rock...|$|R
