25|$|For {{the first}} time in the Washington-Franklin issues three stamps were printed with a dual <b>perforation</b> <b>gauge</b> of 11 x 10.

5000|$|As {{the name}} for a philatelic tool used to measure perforations. Invented in 1866 by Jacques Legrand, the typical [...] "perf gauge" [...] (sometimes called an odontometer) is a metal or plastic tile on which <b>perforations</b> of <b>gauges</b> ranging from 7 and 7½ to 16 and 16½ are pictured (the {{pictures}} sometimes appear {{at the edges of}} the tile). The philatelist places each of these depictions beside a stamp until one is found that exactly matches the stamp’s <b>perforations.</b> Such a <b>gauge</b> is an indispensable tool for identifying stamps that present identical images but have been issued with perforations of several different sizes. An extreme example is the U. S. Washington-Franklin Issues, some of which are found with <b>perforations</b> of <b>gauges</b> 8½, 10, 11, 12, and 12½.|$|R
2500|$|Type II, also {{at first}} printed by Archer & Daly, {{is very similar}} to type I. Frederick Halpin {{designed}} and engraved the image of Davis. The corner ornaments are filled, and a faint line follows the outside of the design and encloses it. [...] The Archer & Daly plates for both Type I and Type II were moved from Richmond to Columbia, South Carolina, when the fall of Richmond became imminent in late 1864. The company of Keatinge & Ball then printed the two stamps. A small number of Types I and II in Archer & Daly printings were perforated and released for use by the Confederate Post Office Department in 1864. [...] The <b>perforations</b> (<b>gauge</b> [...] ) on these were often of notably poor quality, and forgeries abound, many of which betray themselves by perforations that either employ the wrong gauge or are cut too crisply.|$|R
25|$|When the Post Office {{changed the}} <b>perforation</b> <b>gauge</b> from 12 to 10 in 1914, a few sheets emerged with stamps {{that had been}} {{perforated}} {{with one of the}} gauges horizontally and the other vertically (compound perforations). These errors included 1¢, 2¢ and 5¢ stamps (Scott #423A, 423B and 423C) that were perforated 12×10 (12 horizontally and 10 vertically), as well as 1¢ and 2¢ stamps (Scott #423D and 423 E) perforated 10x12. All five varieties are great rarities; indeed the 2¢ perforated 10×12 issue (423E) has been identified as one of the rarest of all U.S. stamps with only a single used copy certified, while the #164 (24c on vertically ribbed paper) is unique. (By comparison, two examples are known of the celebrated 1¢ Z Grill stamp of 1868).|$|E
25|$|Three {{denominations}} of 1, 2 and 3-cents {{were printed}} by the offset printing process. There {{are two types}} of the 1-cent denomination, five different types of the 2-cent variety, and two types of the 3-cent variety. These types possess differences in the lines on the toga rope in Washington's profile and usually require the aid of magnification to positively identify their different characteristics. Stamps produced by the offset process were issued with a <b>perforation</b> <b>gauge</b> of 11 with the one exception of the 1919 1-cent issue with gauge 12½. The first Washington-Franklin stamp printed by the offset process was a 3-cent Washington-head, issued on March 22, 1918. The 1-cent green followed and was issued on December 24, 1918. The five types of the 2-cent denomination were issued sometime later on March 15, 1920. Beginning in 1919 an imperforate variety (no perforations between stamps) was also issued. All three denominations were printed and possess the same variations in type that are found on the perforated issues, as the imperforate issues were produced from the same plates. There were no Franklin-heads printed with the Offset printing press.|$|E
25|$|The first Washington-Franklin stamp issued was a two-cent red Washington-head, {{issued on}} November 16, 1908, {{to pay the}} first class postage on a {{standard}} letter. The seven separate and distinct Washington-Franklin series appeared at intervals of {{a year or two}} and included denominations that ranged from 1-cent to 1 or 5 dollars, depending on the series. The different issues can be distinguished from one another by one or more of several factors: <b>perforation</b> <b>gauge,</b> the type of stamp paper—or, in some unusual varieties, by the printing method used. Four or five basic paper-types were employed during the life of the issue. Two of these have different watermarks (consisting of single-line and double line letters: 'USPS'), while another paper-type had no watermarks (watermarks are detected by placing the stamp in a special fluid). In 1909 a much less common type of bluish paper was used, made of 35% rag stock combined with the usual wood pulp and can readily be identified by its faint bluish-gray color. (N. B., Some contend that bluish paper contained only 10% rag stock.) Later in the same year the Post Office is supposed to have experimented with China clay paper, but whether such a paper stock actually existed has become a matter of dispute.|$|E
25|$|The Spanish {{expedition}} {{of discovery}} of San Francisco Bay was depicted {{on the fourth}} and final denomination of the Panama-Pacific Exposition Issue, produced with both <b>gauge</b> 12 <b>perforations</b> (1913) and <b>gauge</b> 10 <b>perforations</b> (1915). The 10-cent stamp paid the domestic registered mail fee, and was commonly used to meet large weight and foreign destination rates. About 17 million were printed.|$|R
5000|$|Initially, some of {{the same}} plates that were used to print the Penny Black were used to print the Penny Red and about 21 billion Penny Reds were printed by Messrs. Perkins, Bacon & Co. Initially, the stamp had no perforations, and had to be cut from the sheet using {{scissors}} {{in the same manner as}} for the Penny Black and the early printings of the Two pence blue. <b>Perforations,</b> (experimental <b>gauge</b> 16), first came into use in 1850 and were officially adopted in 1854 (in the same size as the experimental issue). The experimental issue can be distinguished from the general issue as the later was applied to stamp which used a different alphabet type for the letters in the lower corners. Each stamp has unique corner letters AA, AB, AC ... AL etc., so its position on the plate can be identified.|$|R
50|$|The {{new stamps}} were printed in several colors and {{depicted}} {{a portrait of}} George Washington on all thirty denominations from one-cent to $200. The engraved image of Washington was modeled after a painting by Gilbert Stuart. The first issues were printed on hard brittle paper and later printed on soft woven paper of varying thicknesses. Colors were generally dull for stamps printed before 1868. The stamps were issued in sheets perforated with 12 <b>gauge</b> <b>perforations</b> or 'imperforate', i.e.solid sheets with no perforations. Washington remained the only figure on the dozens of varieties issued up until 1874.|$|R
2500|$|As the Bureau {{used only}} {{two types of}} watermarks for the Washington-Franklins, with each type bearing the {{initials}} USPS, their application is easily summarized. There are eight distinct configurations in which the watermarked initials can appear on any U.S. postage stamp (or sheet), from right side up, to sideways right, to upside down, and to sideways left; and similarly again in reverse form {{as a result of}} the sheet of paper being placed reversed in the printing press, thus causing the initials USPS to appear reversed on the stamp/sheet. Watermarks as they occur on U.S. postage stamps are not usually visible to the naked eye and must be submerged in a special watermark fluid that enhances its appearance. This is done to distinguish stamps with the same color, <b>perforation</b> <b>gauge</b> and denomination but which were printed on paper with different watermarks or without any watermarks—i.e., the only way to positively distinguish a 3-cent, 1908 issue, with double-line watermark, from a 3-cent, 1910 issue, with single-line watermark, is to test for these watermarks, as both of these issues are identical in color, denomination and <b>perforation</b> (<b>gauge</b> 12), and therefore cannot be differentiated by these features.

2500|$|In 1909 the U.S. Post Office, in {{its effort}} to counter the effects of shrinkage, experimented with {{different}} paper, printing the next series of postage stamps on a bluish-paper reportedly consisting of a 35% rag stock used conjunction with the usual wood pulp (this percentage has been called into question by some analysts). When placed next to a stamp of ordinary wood pulp paper and the reverse sides are inspected the difference in paper tone is readily apparent. This experimental paper was supposed to reduce shrinkage from the paper dampening involved in the wet-sheet printing process; but while it represented a marginal improvement over the 1908 issues, it did not solve shrinkage problem sufficiently and its use was discontinued after a brief period. The <b>perforation</b> <b>gauge</b> of this issue is again 12. Stamps printed on bluish paper have denominations that range from 1c through 15c and were sold only in Washington DC, so used examples on cover usually bear a Washington DC postmark. Consequently most of the issues from this series are scarce and generally expensive. The 1 and 2 cent stamps are the most affordable for collectors, for they were issued in larger quantities, approximately 3 million of each issue printed. The remaining denominations appeared in very limited quantities and are (sometimes very) valuable. Rarest of all are the 4-cent and 8-cent stamps, which, in fact, were never released for postal use; apparently, they reached the public in 1915 when the Post Office traded them to stamp dealers in exchange for rare issues missing from the Smithsonian Institution collection of U. S. stamps. The denominations of 7, 9, 11 and 12 cents do not occur on bluish paper. [...] ) ...|$|E

50|$|The stamp {{was later}} reprinted, in several shades, for 28 more times. The paper was changed from blued to white in 1861, and from 1863 Crown CC {{watermarked}} paper was used. All printings had the <b>perforation</b> of <b>gauge</b> 14, but in 1868 the stamp was issued with a rough perforation of 12½. Two years later {{a stamp with}} the same perforation but clean-cut was issued. The perforation was reverted to 14, but in 1878-1879 there were two printings with the perforation of 14 x 12½. These were the first Malta stamps to have a gutter in between the panes of the stamps in the sheet. Prior to this, the stamps had wing margins. In November 1879 the perforation was once again reverted to 14 and all subsequent printings used the same perforation. The last major change came in 1882, when paper watermarked Crown CA began to be used. These last printings are the cheapest versions of the stamp, and are catalogued at just €18 to €30 unused. A complete sheet of the final printing is also known to exist.|$|R
25|$|This series again {{includes}} Washington-heads on denominations 1-cent through 7-cents and Franklin-heads on the 8-cent through 1-dollar values. It is {{the first}} series to include the 11-cent denomination with the Franklin and Oak leaves design, colored slate-green, which appears again in the following two series of 1916 and 1917. Lower values of the series are printed from plates of 400 on single-line watermarked paper, while the one-dollar Franklin is printed from plates of 200 subjects and uses double-line watermarked paper of the appropriate size. Because of stamp separation problems in previous issues using <b>gauge</b> 12 <b>perforations,</b> particularly when attempting to tear a block of stamps from the sheet to cover postage on parcels, this series was instead issued with <b>gauge</b> 10. The <b>perforations</b> of this <b>gauge</b> would soon {{prove to be a}} problem also, as the coarser <b>gauge</b> of <b>perforation</b> made it more difficult to separate stamps, often resulting in torn stamps.|$|R
