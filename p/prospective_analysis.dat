40|$|Abstract. <b>Prospective</b> risk <b>analysis</b> is {{difficult}} in complex sociotechnical systems where humans interact with one {{other and with}} information systems. Traditional <b>prospective</b> risk <b>analysis</b> methods typically capture one risk {{at a time and}} rely on the specification of a chronological sequence of errors occurring in combination. The aim here is to introduce agent-based risk assessment (ABRA), whichaddressestheseissuesbysimulatingmultipleconcurrentandsequentialinteractionsamongstautonomousagentsthatactaccordingtotheirowngoals.

40|$|Traditional {{economic}} development theories {{have struggled to}} identify, in a comprehensive manner, the drivers and constraints that explain singular development paths and lead to spatial inequalities. Assuming that development patterns are territory-specific, {{the research hypothesis is}} that public policies should {{have a better understanding of}} territorial dynamics in order to propose strategies efficient to trigger changes. This paper applies the use of <b>Prospective</b> Structural <b>Analysis</b> (PSA), a foresight analysis technique, to explore the territorial dynamics. The results show that, within a territory, the variables play different roles, and suggest that rural policies might have focused on factors that have few influence in fostering changes rather than on those with leverage effects.

5000|$|To {{determine}} {{an estimate}} for {{the rate of}} occult Specimen Provenance Complication occurrence, researchers at Washington University School of Medicine conducted <b>prospective</b> <b>analysis</b> of approximately 13,000 prostate biopsies performed as part of routine clinical practice. Published in the American Journal of Clinical Pathology, this study classified biopsy misidentification errors into two segments: a complete transposition between patients (Type 1) and contamination of a patient’s tissue {{with one or more}} unrelated patients (Type 2). The frequency of occult Type 1 and Type 2 errors was found to be 0.26% and 0.67% respectively, or a combined error rate of 0.93%. However, each case involves at least two individuals, so this error rate actually underestimates the percentage of patients potentially affected by incidents of biopsy misidentification. Furthermore, the study demonstrated that errors occur across a variety of practice types and diagnostic laboratories, indicating no one setting is immune from this problem.|$|E

40|$|This study aims at {{identifying}} {{the roles and}} tasks of a Train driver, who operates a highly automated high-speed passenger train, {{as well as the}} job requirements in terms of personnel selection criteria. To this end, two studies – a <b>prospective</b> task <b>analysis</b> and a <b>prospective</b> job <b>analysis</b> based on Fleishman – were conducted with two samples of experienced highspeed train drivers from Germany. The results show that cognitive information acquisition and continuous Monitoring tasks require mental persistence and sustained attention, thus converting the train driver into a train operator. It is proposed that the future tasks and working conditions should be designed to strengthen the train operators’ share in tasks of information integration, strategizing, and decision-making. Thus, the detrimental effects of continuous Monitoring tasks, which are well established across transportation industry domains, could be alleviated...|$|R
