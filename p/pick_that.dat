He was drafted in the 21st round of the 2002 Major League Baseball Draft by the San Francisco Giants. The Giants gave him a $955,000 bonus {{to prevent him from}} attending Oregon State University. The bonus was the highest back then for a non-first-round player, cued on by the organization's approaching signing deadline. The Giants could afford to pay a 21st-round <b>pick</b> <b>that</b> much because their higher picks had signed quickly for routine bonuses.|$|E
5|$|Reuben Mayes {{rushed for}} 147 yards, the second-most in New Orleans Saints history, as the Saints equalled their highest-ever margin of victory. The Saints scored {{on their first}} three possessions. The Buccaneers did not score until the fourth quarter, when Steve DeBerg ran for a 1-yard touchdown. Steve Young left the stadium on crutches, and {{starting}} defensive end Ron Holmes left the game after trying to play the first quarter with a broken fibula. Mayes was selected with a third-round draft <b>pick</b> <b>that</b> had been obtained from the Buccaneers in exchange for safety David Greenwood, who the Buccaneers had already waived.|$|E

25|$|Reles's small {{physical}} size did {{not deter}} him from committing ruthless acts of violence. When carrying out murders, his {{weapon of choice}} was an ice pick, which he would ram through his victim's ear right into the brain.

25|$|In a {{blockbuster}} trade, the Wizards sent Gilbert Arenas to the Orlando Magic {{in return for}} Rashard Lewis on December 18. Kirk Hinrich {{was traded to the}} Atlanta Hawks for Jordan Crawford, Maurice Evans, Mike Bibby, and a 2011 1st round <b>pick</b> <b>that</b> became Chris Singleton, although Mike Bibby bought out his contract after playing two games and eventually signed with the Miami Heat. The Wizards finished with a 23–59 record, once again occupying the Southeast Division cellar.|$|E
25|$|In the 2014 NBA draft, the Bulls traded their #16 and #19 {{picks for}} Doug McDermott, the former Creighton star and 5th leading scorer in NCAA history, who was {{selected}} with the 11th pick, {{and in the}} second round, took Cameron Bairstow with the 49th <b>pick.</b> <b>That</b> offseason, they signed Pau Gasol, re-signed Kirk Hinrich and brought over Eurostar Nikola Mirotić, who was acquired via a draft day trade in 2011, but could not come over sooner due to salary cap constraints.|$|E

25|$|The 1979 season saw new Head Coach Fred Creighton—himself {{replaced}} by the newly retired Cheevers the following year. The Bruins trade of Ron Grahame to the Los Angeles Kings for a first round <b>pick,</b> <b>that</b> {{turned out to be}} eighth overall, enabled the Bruins to draft Ray Bourque, one of the greatest defensemen of all-time and the face of the Bruins for over two decades. The Bruins made the playoffs every year through the 1980s behind stars such as Park, Bourque and Rick Middleton—and had the league's best record in 1983 behind a Vezina Trophy–winning season from ex-Flyer goaltender Pete Peeters—but always fell short of making the Finals.|$|E
25|$|The early Pacers {{came out}} on the short end of two of the most one-sided trades in NBA history. In 1980, they traded Alex English to the Nuggets in order to reacquire former ABA star George McGinnis. McGinnis was long past his prime, and contributed very little during his two-year return. English, in contrast, went on {{to become one of the}} {{greatest}} scorers in NBA history. The next year, they traded a 1984 draft pick to the Portland Trail Blazers for center Tom Owens, who played one year for the Pacers with little impact. In 1983–84, the Pacers finished with the worst record in the Eastern Conference, which would have given the Pacers the second overall pick in the draft—the <b>pick</b> <b>that</b> the Blazers used to select Sam Bowie while Michael Jordan was still available. As a result of the Owens trade, they were left as bystanders in the midst of one of the deepest drafts in NBA history—including such future stars as Jordan, Hakeem Olajuwon, Charles Barkley, and John Stockton.|$|E
25|$|In {{the final}} home {{game for the}} team's senior class, the Irish took the field donning their special green jerseys. The {{first quarter of the}} game {{featured}} good defense by both teams including a stop on 4th down by the Irish and a <b>pick</b> <b>that</b> led to 3 by Army to give the Black Knights an early 3-0 lead. But in the second quarter the Irish came out firing and less than a minute into the 2nd Brady Quinn handed the ball to Darius Walker and he ran it in 10-yds for the Touchdown making it 7-3 Notre Dame. After a Defensive stop by the Irish they got the ball back and on 9 plays drove down field topping it off with Quinn throwing a 13-yd pass to Jeff Samardzija for the Irish's 2nd TD, but Gioia missed the PAT making the score 13-3 Notre Dame. With just over a minute left in the 1st half Brady Quinn hooked up with Rhema McKnight for an 8-yd touchdown reception and this time Carl Gioia hit the PAT giving Notre Dame a 20-3 lead going into halftime.|$|E

25|$|With news on draft {{day that}} Scott Niedermayer signed a one-year {{contract}} extension and that Teemu Selanne intended to fulfill {{the last year of}} his contract, the Ducks traded Chris Pronger to the Philadelphia Flyers, receiving Joffery Lupul back and defenseman Luca Sbisa, along with the Flyers' first-round <b>pick</b> <b>that</b> year and their first-round pick next year. On July 8, the Ducks signed former Montreal Canadiens captain Saku Koivu to {{a one-year contract}}. Another slow start doomed the Ducks. Before the trade deadline, the Ducks traded Giguere to the Toronto Maple Leafs for Jason Blake and Vesa Toskala after signing Hiller to a contract extension. The trade deadline saw the Ducks trade Ryan Whitney to Edmonton for offensive defenseman Lubomir Visnovsky, as well as the acquisitions of defenseman Aaron Ward from the Carolina Hurricanes and goalie Curtis McElhinney from the Calgary Flames. The Ducks played through frequent injuries and picked up play in the second half of the season, but struggled coming out of the Olympic break. For the first time since the lockout, the Ducks failed to make the playoffs with a 39–32–11 record. The 2010 off-season was also busy for the Ducks, as Scott Niedermayer announced his retirement in a June press conference. Niedermayer decided to stay a member of the Ducks as a team consultant. The Ducks resigned Saku Koivu for two years and signed free agent defenseman Toni Lydman to a three-year contract. In addition to Lydman, the Ducks were able to get defenseman Cam Fowler via the draft, and 35-year-old strong-willed defenseman Andy Sutton signed to a two-year deal. Restricted free agent Bobby Ryan was signed to a five-year deal.|$|E
500|$|After the 1968 season, MLB {{expanded}} and an expansion draft {{was conducted in}} which the new teams could select certain players from the established teams. The White Sox left Wilhelm unprotected, possibly {{because they did not}} believe that teams would have interest in a much older pitcher. [...] On October 15, 1968, Wilhelm was chosen in the expansion draft by the Kansas City Royals as the 49th <b>pick.</b> <b>That</b> offseason, he was traded by the Royals to the California Angels for Ed Kirkpatrick and Dennis Paepke.|$|E
500|$|Although Ferguson later praised television's part in {{aiding the}} Premier League, he {{maintained}} the league's freedom of control continued to impair club's chances in European competitions: [...] "You get some ridiculous situations when you're playing on Wednesday night in Europe {{and then at}} lunchtime the following Saturday. You ask any manager if they would <b>pick</b> <b>that</b> themselves... there'd be no chance." [...] He likened television to God and said [...] "When you shake hands with the devil {{you have to pay}} the price." [...] Arsène Wenger also criticised the influence television companies had over scheduling: [...] "At the moment, television decides. You cannot have decisive games with one team playing Friday and Tuesday, and another on Sunday and Tuesday." ...|$|E
50|$|Harris {{was drafted}} in the 2nd round (47th overall) of the 2007 NFL Draft by the New York Jets. The Jets sent their 2nd, 3rd, and 6th <b>picks</b> <b>that</b> year to the Green Bay Packers in {{exchange}} for the Packers 2nd rounder to select Harris.|$|R

500|$|The Indianapolis Colts {{owned the}} first draft <b>pick</b> <b>that</b> year. Team scouts favored Leaf, but Colts {{president}} Bill Polian and coaching staff preferred Manning, especially after discovering during individual workouts that he could throw harder than Leaf. Manning also impressed the team during his interview, while Leaf missed his. Leaf's draft prospect profile described the player as [...] "self-confident {{to the point where}} some people view him as being arrogant and almost obnoxious". Leaf gained about 20 pounds between the end of his junior season and the NFL Combine in February, which Jerry Angelo, one of six experts Sports Illustrated consulted on the choice, described as [...] "a [...] signal" [...] about his self-discipline. All six believed that Manning was the better choice, but the magazine concluded [...] "What does seem reasonably certain is that ... both Manning and Leaf should develop into at least good NFL starters".|$|E
500|$|On June 30, Bertuzzi {{announced}} that he had determined that Quebec's agreement with the Flyers was enforceable. He considered Farwell's phone call with Lindros to be [...] "critical" [...] in making his decision. Bertuzzi also found the Rangers to be innocent of any wrongdoing. The finalized trade had the Nordiques acquire Hextall, Duchesne, Ricci, Kerry Huffman, Peter Forsberg, a first-round pick in the 1993 NHL Entry Draft, $15million, and future considerations. As the agreed-upon trade included the Flyers sending a 1992 draft pick to Quebec which Philadelphia instead kept because the trade was not yet finalized, Bertuzzi helped the teams agree that the Flyers would send Chris Simon and a pick in the 1994 NHL Entry Draft to Quebec to compensate for the 1992 draft <b>pick</b> <b>that</b> the Flyers kept and used to select LW Ryan Sittler. The Nordiques selected Jocelyn Thibault with one of the picks, while they traded the second draft pick, which the Washington Capitals used to select Nolan Baumgartner.|$|E
500|$|Patrick's {{voice is}} {{provided}} by actor Bill Fagerbakke, who also does the voices of numerous other characters on SpongeBob SquarePants. While creating the show and writing its pilot episode in 1997, Hillenburg and Derek Drymon, the show's then-creative director, were also conducting auditions to find voices for the show's characters. Fagerbakke auditioned {{for the role of}} Patrick after Tom Kenny, SpongeBob's voice actor, had been cast. Fagerbakke said, [...] "Steve is such a lovely guy, and I had absolutely no feeling for the material whatsoever." [...] He described his experience in the audition, saying [...] "I was just going in for another audition, and I {{had no idea what was}} in store there in terms of the remarkable visual wit and really the kind of endearing child-like humanity in the show. I couldn't <b>pick</b> <b>that</b> up from the audition material at all. I was just kind of perfunctorially trying to give the guy what he wanted." ...|$|E
