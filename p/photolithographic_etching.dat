The advantages of the IDE design include the ability to produce fast and homogenous color change over large areas. In addition, it enables fabrication of multi-color devices. Our method involves <b>photolithographic</b> <b>etching</b> of ITO followed by electrophoretic deposition (EPD) and mechanical compression of porous titania to produce finely patterned electrodes with high surface area.

40|$|We {{present the}} design, {{processing}} {{and testing of}} a W-band finite by infinite and a finite by finite Grounded Frequency Selective Surfaces (FSSs) on infinite background. The 3 D full wave solver Nondirective Stable Plane Wave Multilevel Fast Multipole Algorithm (NSPWMLFMA) is used to simulate the FSSs. As NSPWMLFMA solver improves the complexity matrix-vector product in an iterative solver from O(N(2)) to O(N log N) which enables the solver to simulate finite arrays with faster execution time and manageable memory requirements. The simulation results were verified by comparing them with the experimental results. The comparisons demonstrate {{the accuracy of the}} NSPWMLFMA solver.

40|$|Abstract—The {{analysis}} {{and design of}} a microstrip antenna array with a conical beam are presented. The antenna array employs a periodic structure derived from the microstrip on a perforated ground plane. The microstrip antenna array consists of eight leaky lines evenly distributed around a circle. Each line radiates mainly a pair of forward and backward beams, forming a conical beam. The new leaky line design employs the concept of space-harmonic modulation on the EH 0 mode launched at the common joint of the antenna array. The scattering and dispersion characteristics of the leaky line are thoroughly investigated. The fact that the per-turbation of the antisymmetric holes made by <b>photolithographic</b> <b>etching</b> excites the leaky EH 1 mode is theoretically and experi-mentally validated. Scattering analyses of the surface currents on the microstrip, however, reveal in detail the physical operation of the leaky line. The dispersion characteristics are, thus, established and shown in a Brillouin diagram, indicating the role of each space harmonic, denoted by its complex propagation constant represents a traveling-wave component of the th higher-order spatial component {{in association with the}} EH mode: the superscript,+ (), signifies a forward (backward) traveling wave.

40|$|The {{enhanced}} {{grain boundary}} diffusion in cw laser processed LPCVD polycrystalline silicon films on insulating SiO 2 {{has been investigated}} and the grain boundary diffusion coefficient D' for Phosphorus has been determined. Mesa diodes were fabricated in the large grain poly-Si films by standard <b>photolithographic</b> and <b>etching</b> methods and subsequent ion implantation. The electron beam induced current mode (EBIC) of the SEM allowed direct measurement of the dopant diffusion length along the grain boundaries intersecting the p-n junction. We have found a t¼ dependence of the penetration depth and Arrhenius behavior for the temperature dependence of the diffusion coefficient. The numerical evaluation of the experimental data is based on Whipple's exact solution of the grain boundary diffusion problem...|$|R
40|$|Silicon {{photonic}} {{devices are}} becoming an increasingly popular platform for nonlinear optical applications {{owing to the}} high Kerr nonlinearity and tight optical confinement. Although typically these devices are fabricated from silicon planar wafers using standard <b>photolithographic</b> and <b>etching</b> techniques, more recently alternative fiber-based platforms have emerged [1]. In this paper we will review methods to fabricate novel micro-scale devices from our silicon fiber platform using standard fiber post-processing techniques. Fig. 1 shows two geometries that are unique to the fiber platform; microcylindrical silicon resonators [2] and tapered silicon core waveguides [3]. The ability to arbitrarily tailor the dimensions in these devices to manipulate the light confinement {{is of particular interest}} for low power, high speed nonlinear optical processing. For example, we will show that the ultra-small mode volume of the resonators can be exploited for ultrafast Kerr optical switching and modulation, whilst the longitudinally varying waveguide parameters of the tapers can be used for nonlinear pulse shaping at modest power levels...|$|R
40|$|Immunofluorescence and {{confocal}} microscopy {{were used}} to monitor the positioning of microtubule-organizing centers (MTOCs) during directional migration of chicken embryo fibroblasts on planar substrata and within three-dimensional collagen gels. Homologous assay conditions based on the radial emigration of cells from cell aggregates were used in both cases. Whereas approximately 70 % of the cells migrating directionally on glass and at least 60 % on other planar substrata have their MTOCs anterior to the nucleus, MTOCs are randomly distributed around the nucleus in cells within collagen gels. The anterior location of the MTOC in cells on glass is attained gradually during the first 4 hr of directional migration. Cells on oriented planar substrata, manufactured by <b>photolithographic</b> <b>etching</b> of narrow parallel grooves into the glass surface, also have a random position of the MTOC, although the cells themselves assume a highly polarized cell shape parallel to the grooves. This environment mimics the partial orientation of the collagen fibers produced by the tractive forces of the cells within collagen networks. These findings demonstrate a difference in MTOC positioning between fibroblasts on planar substrata and within a quasinatural environment...|$|E

The inherently low {{noise of the}} field effect is aided {{by the fact that}} majority carrier devices can operate at cryogenic temperatures with a 3 to 4 fold reduction in noise. 1 - 9 The operating frequencies for this study were chosen for their interest to radio astronomy. Specifically, 8. 45 GHz is the proposed frequency for space VLBI, 10 and 15 GHz is of importance for background radiation observations. 11 The astronomical requirements of over 1 GHz bandwidth and under 1000 K noise temperature are challenging design goals in the intermediate step of fabricating a reliable, cryogenically cooled low noise FET amplifier. The amplifier doubles as a test jig in the experimental study of FET gain and noise properties at high frequencies and low temperatures. Design features include easy device replacement and alternate versions for chip and packaged transistors to enable comparative study. For packages, duroid (teflon) substrate and solder connections are employed; the chip version is functionally identical, but eliminates solder joints and uses quartz substrate for the microstrip circuits. Impedances are tunable over a wide range, using broadband open-circuited stub lines. Substrate processing techniques including vacuum evaporation, plating and <b>photolithographic</b> <b>etching</b> were developed to enable rapid realization of any desired microstrip pattern...|$|E

Features down to 2 μm have been patterned into submicron-thick mesoporous films using standard <b>photolithographic</b> and dry <b>etching</b> techniques. After patterning {{of the top}} porous film, a second anodization can be performed, allowing an under-layer of highly uniform porosity and thickness to be achieved. High transmission greater than 40 % is measured, and modeling results suggest that a change in diffraction efficiency of 1 dB for a 1 % change in normalized refractive index can be achieved. Preliminary measurement of solvent vapor shows a large signal change from the grating sensor in agreement with models.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the systematic {{investigation of a}} range of microelectrode arrays with varying dimensions fabricated by standard <b>photolithographic</b> and reactive-ion <b>etching</b> techniques. As expected from theory, the electrochemical behavior of microelectrode arrays with a constant individual diameter varied strongly with center-to-center spacing, the larger the spacing the more sigmoidal the recorded voltammogram. Furthermore, the behavior of arrays with a constant relative center-to-center spacing is shown to vary with individual electrode diameter, the arrays with the smallest electrodes producing strongly peaked voltammograms. Peak current densities and signal-to-noise ratios were also obtained for a variety of array geometries, and the use of electrodeposited platinum black electrodes was investigated. To demonstrate one advantage of using a loosely packed microelectrode array in electroanalysis, a ferrocene-mediated enzyme-linked assay involving the biocatalytic reduction of H 2 O 2 was investigated.

40|$|The {{fundamental}} {{requirement of}} a competent tactile sensor for manipulating an {{object is to}} determine the magnitude and the position of an applied force on it. In addition, it is important to determine orientation of the object in relation to the tactile sensor. In order to achieve these goals, most investigators have attempted to design a tactile sensor using an array of sensing elements arranged in matrix form. There are several problems associated with this type of tactile sensors. These problems include cross-talk between sensing elements, fragility, and complexity. This thesis reports on the design, modeling, fabrication and testing of a membrane tactile sensing system with only four sensing elements. By using membrane stress combined with triangulation approach, it is shown {{that it is possible to}} overcome the above problems. The prototype sensor consists of a single film of 25 micron thick Polyvinylidene Fluoride (PVDF) film, which is held between two 12 mm-thick flat Plexiglass plates, each with a 90 mm-diameter center hole. Four square sensing elements, each 3 min side, were fabricated around the center of the membrane. The fabrication of the sensing elements is performed using <b>photolithographic</b> and <b>etching</b> techniques. By applying force with a probe of various shapes and sizes at various points away from the sensing elements, and using a geometric mapping process, the sensor is calibrated. As the result of calibration various isocharge contours were drawn. Using both finite element and experimental analysis, it is shown that it is possible to determine the position, orientation and the magnitude of the applied load though various flat shaped probes, by using only four sensing elements. The experimental and the finite element results are compared. It is shown that there is a good correlation between the finite element predictions and experimental data...|$|R
40|$|In {{the field}} of areal surface {{roughness}} measurement, characterization using several techniques can be helpful {{to better understand the}} performance of each technique and to improve the overall precision. Measuring exactly the same area with different techniques in practice is not easy. Such studies are of great interest in order to characterize and to understand important new materials today such as semiconductor alloys and graphene for silicon technologies, or biomaterials such as hydroxyapatite for use in human implants. In this work, two types of samples based on a silicon wafer were made by marking with a fractal, multi-scale <b>photolithographic</b> mask and <b>etching.</b> The first sample consisted of a bare silicon wafer with a pattern consisting of 2. 4 deep numbered square features. The second sample was a rough layer of hydroxyapatite deposited from a solution of simulated body fluid on a similarly etched silicon wafer.

40|$|Many {{groups have}} worked to {{incorporate}} thin film lead zirconate titanate (PZT) into {{a wide range of}} devices including: actuators, energy harvesters, resonators, pressure sensors, pumps, nano-positioning stages, and MEMS switches. However, the use of PZT has been limited in many MEMS designs due to the constraints and coupled nature of the currently popular spin coating process. Not only is spin coating inherently wasteful of the expensive PZT solution, but it prevents the deposition of PZT films on non-planar substrates and requires difficult, low yield, patterning steps. Direct printing of PZT thin films eliminates the need for <b>photolithographic</b> patterning and <b>etching,</b> allows for controlled deposition over non-planar topographies, and enables the fabrication of devices with varying thickness which cannot be accomplished with conventional spin coating processes. This paper presents the design interaction analysis that lead {{to the development of a}} dot on demand deposition process as the adequate manufacturing solution for small volume MEMS products. Furthermore, it describes the various ways in which Axiomatic Design principles guides the development of this new deposition process. Included is a method of resolving coupling between solution chemistry desirable for thermal processing and fluid properties acceptable for printing. It also presents analysis of the inherent coupling that occurs in digital deposition processes between the discrete material deposition and the desire for uniform film geometry and microstructure. Finally this paper discusses the coupling that has yet to be resolved in the manufacture of robust high quality PZT films and future work that may help further facilitate the integration of this powerful material...|$|R
40|$|A {{systematic}} {{investigation of}} the electrochemical behaviour of two sets of microelectrode arrays, fabricated by standard <b>photolithographic</b> and reactive-ion <b>etching</b> techniques, is presented. The first set of microelectrode arrays had a constant relative centre-centre spacing of 10 r (where r is the electrode radius). As a value of r was decreased, the cyclic voltammograms recorded from the array became increasingly peak-shaped, due to merging of the diffusion fields of the individual electrodes. Furthermore, it was shown that the peak current densities obtained were largest for the arrays with the smallest individual electrodes, as were the signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). Electroplating the individuals electrodes with platinum black was also shown to increase the peak currents and the SNRs, due {{to an increase in}} the effective surface area. Sigmoidal voltammograms, which are indicative of radial diffusion, were obtained for an individual electrode radius of 25 mm but not for arrays with smaller electrodes. To obtain radial diffusion for an array of 2. 5 mm electrodes, it was shown (using a second set of microelectrode arrays) that a minimum relative centre-centre spacing of 40 r is required. Further enhancement of the peak current densities were obtained by decreasing the size of the individual electrodes. A series of nanoelectrode arrays were fabricated using electron-beam lithography (EBL). The voltammograms obtained from these arrays exhibited a continual increase in the recorded peak current as the individual electrodes radius was decreased to a value of 110 nm. Since EBL is a slow and costly technique, nanoimprint lithography (NIL) was investigated as an alternative method of fabricating nanoelectrode arrays and comparable results were obtained from arrays produced by EBL and NIL. A dissolved oxygen and temperature sensor incorporating a working microelectrode array was also designed and fabricated. The sector comprised a densely packed array of 2. 5 mm radius electrodes and a micro-reference electrode, both of which were covered with an agarose electrolyte gel enclosed in an SU 8 chamber. A thermal resistor was included for temperature compensation of the dissolved oxygen measurements. The Ag|AgCl micro-reference electrode was found to be stable for approximately 80 hours in 0. 1 M KCl, with 100 nA of current passing through it. Linear calibration curves were obtained from both temperature and dissolved oxygen measurement...|$|R
