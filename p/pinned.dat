This time, the team of Sting, Steiner, Nash, and Booker T faced off against Styles, Joe, and two mystery {{partners}} (The TNA Front Line) in an Eight Man Tag Team match. The stipulations were if anyone from Styles' team <b>pinned</b> a member of Sting's team, then Styles won the TNA Title, while if anyone from Sting's team <b>pinned</b> a member of Styles' team, then Sting retained the title. The match was announced on the November 20 episode of Impact!. Styles' mystery partners were revealed on the November 27 episode of Impact! as Team 3D (Brother Devon and Brother Ray).

5|$|The team of Guts and Glory, {{consisting}} of Lex Luger, Adam Bomb, Mabel, and The Smoking Gunns (Billy and Bart Gunn), faced The Million Dollar Team, {{made up of}} Tatanka, Bam Bam Bigelow, King Kong Bundy, and The Heavenly Bodies (Tom Prichard and Jimmy Del Ray) in the next match. Guts and Glory took the early lead when Mabel <b>pinned</b> Prichard after performing a crossbody from the second rope. Mabel fought Bundy and Bigelow, but he was counted out after clotheslining Bigelow out of the ring. Bigelow then performed a moonsault on Bomb and got a pinfall. Luger and Del Ray fought back and forth until Luger performed a running forearm smash on Del Ray to get the pinfall.

A Texas Death match {{is similar to a}} Last Team Standing match, however, the {{competitor}} must pin or make his opponent submit before the referee begins his count. Daniels <b>pinned</b> Storm following hitting him in the knee with a steel chair to begin the ten count, which Storm failed to make. Daniels was the second to be eliminated, failing to reach the ten count after being <b>pinned</b> following a top rope legdrop by Harris. With the outcome of the match down to the competition between Harris and Skipper, Harris hit Skipper with the Catatonic onto a steel chair.

40|$|The {{formation}} of leaf vein patterns has fascinated biologists for centuries. Transport {{of the plant}} signal auxin has long been implicated in vein patterning, but molecular details have remained unclear. Varied evidence suggests a central role for the plasma-membrane (PM) -localized PIN-FORMED 1 (<b>PIN</b> 1) intercellular auxin transporter of Arabidopsis thaliana in auxin-transport-dependent vein patterning. However, {{in contrast to the}} severe vein-pattern defects induced by auxin transport inhibitors, <b>pin</b> 1 mutant leaves have only mild vein-pattern defects. These defects have been interpreted as evidence of redundancy between <b>PIN</b> 1 and the other four PM-localized <b>PIN</b> proteins in vein patterning, redundancy that underlies many developmental processes. By contrast, we show here that vein patterning in the Arabidopsis leaf is controlled by two distinct and convergent auxin-transport pathways: intercellular auxin transport mediated by PM-localized <b>PIN</b> 1 and intracellular auxin transport mediated by the evolutionarily older, endoplasmic-reticulum-localized <b>PIN</b> 6, <b>PIN</b> 8, and <b>PIN</b> 5. <b>PIN</b> 6 and <b>PIN</b> 8 are expressed, as <b>PIN</b> 1 and <b>PIN</b> 5, at sites of vein formation. <b>pin</b> 6 synthetically enhances <b>pin</b> 1 vein-pattern defects, and <b>pin</b> 8 quantitatively enhances <b>pin</b> 1 <b>pin</b> 6 vein-pattern defects. Function of <b>PIN</b> 6 is necessary, redundantly with that of <b>PIN</b> 8, and sufficient to control auxin response levels, <b>PIN</b> 1 expression, and vein network formation; and the vein pattern defects induced by ectopic <b>PIN</b> 6 expression are mimicked by ectopic <b>PIN</b> 8 expression.
