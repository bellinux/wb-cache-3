Drilling experiments were conducted with <b>drill</b> <b>points,</b> namely standard twist drill, Zhirov-point drill, and multifacet drill, using wide range of spindle speed, and feed rate to analyse thrust force, delamination and surface roughness. At high spindle speed, cutting force is less and the special geometry improves {{the quality of the}} hole further, especially Zhirov <b>point</b> <b>drill.</b> Multifacet drill is found better as far as the delamination value is concerned.

40|$|In seeking {{improved}} drill performance, {{researchers and}} manufacturers have made significant advances through the modification of <b>drill</b> <b>point</b> geometry {{and the use}} of advanced PVD coatings. The present study was set up to analyze the rake angle distributions on the drill lips and chisel edges of four selected <b>point</b> modified <b>drill</b> designs followed by an investigation into the effects of point modification and surface coatings on the generation of cutting forces during drilling. The results demonstrate that point modifcation can significantly reduce the amount of negative rake cutting at the <b>drill</b> <b>point,</b> which in turn, is reflected in reductions in cutting forces. However, reductions in cutting force due to PVD coatings on <b>point</b> modified <b>drills</b> were observed to be only minor, while steam oxide treated <b>point</b> modified <b>drills</b> showed the greatest reduction in cutting forces.

40|$|Drill-life {{testing is}} being used in {{industry}} to assess the performance of advanced surface coatings on cutting tools. However, it has been long recognized that such testing suffers {{from the fact that}} nominally similar drills with identical GP-twist drill design are subject to some variability in as-manufactured <b>drill</b> <b>point</b> features, that can give rise to large differences in tool-life. In the present study a brief review is presented made of previous investigations which looked at the specifications and measurement of prominent <b>drill</b> <b>point</b> features on GP-twist drills. This is followed by an overview of current practices in the production of GP-twist drills. Finally, results are presented of prominent <b>drill</b> <b>point</b> features measured on a batch of GP-twist drills. Production and design tolerances representing process capability ranges for <b>drill</b> <b>point</b> features were estimated and found to be within the tolerance ranges as specified by the drill manufacturer. Variations due to drift and machine setting changes were found to be negligible ie statistically not significant with a confidence level at 95 % or higher.

40|$|AbstractComposites {{are used}} in {{conjunction}} with another material to form a multi-material stack-up, which results in greater strength to weight ratios. In a wide range of aerospace applications dissimilar material stack-ups of composites and aluminium and/or titanium are used. Drilling is probably the most common machining operation applied to composites since components made out of composite materials are usually near net shaped and require only holes for assembly integration. In this investigation, experiments were conducted by varying the drilling parameters and determining the optimum cutting conditions for drilling of CFRP/Ti stacks using Genetic Algorithm (GA) optimization technique. Tool wear study was performed by drilling 100 holes each with 118 ° and 130 ° <b>point</b> angle <b>drills.</b> Less progressive tool wear and better chip evacuation was achievable in 130 ° <b>point</b> angle <b>drills</b> when compared with 118 °point angle drills...|$|R

40|$|The general {{appearance}} of twist drills {{is similar to}} a 'spiral' drill design patented by Morse in 1863. In the past few decades there have been numerous attempts to improve the cutting process and chip removal via changes and modifications in the <b>drill</b> <b>point</b> geometry, the flute shape and surface coatings. It has been recognized that the <b>drill</b> <b>point</b> design features and the flute shape are geometrically linked.

However, little has been published for other twist drill modifications e. g. deep hole jobber (DHJ) drill design, although the cutting action in drilling appears to be similar for various twist drills involving the drill lips in oblique cutting and the chisel edge in orthogonal cutting. Thus, this paper was focused on studying geometrical differences between GPT and DHJ drill designs via distribution of rake angles along the drill lips and chisel edge. Moreover, the experimentally measured thrust and torque values for both GPT and DHJ drills, in coated and uncoated conditions, are presented to quantify and highlight total possible improvements that can be achieved by <b>drill</b> <b>point</b> modifications and surface coatings...|$|R
