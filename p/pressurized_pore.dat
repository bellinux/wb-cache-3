50|$|A clastic dike is a seam of {{sedimentary}} material that fills an open fracture in and cuts across sedimentary rock strata or layering in other rock types. Clastic dikes form rapidly by fluidized injection (mobilization of <b>pressurized</b> <b>pore</b> fluids) or passively by water, wind, and gravity (sediment swept into open cracks). Diagenesis {{may play a}} role in the formation of some dikes. Clastic dikes are commonly vertical or near-vertical. Centimeter-scale widths are common, but thicknesses range from millimetres to metres. Length is usually many times width.|$|E
40|$|In this article, {{we present}} a glaciotectonic model for raft {{emplacement}} based on a study of large-scale and small-scale deformation structures associated with the accretion of chalk rafts at three Middle Pleistocene sites on the north Norfolk coast, eastern England. Detailed structural measurements taken from the three localities indicate an overall sense of ice movement and raft emplacement towards the south/southeast, suggesting a source area for the rafts located {{to the north of}} the present Norfolk coast in the offshore area of the North Sea. Provenancing of the chalk rafts, based on analysis of the foraminifera, also indicates a northern nearshore provenance for the chalk. Mechanisms for the detachment, transport and accretion of the rafts are explored, and it is concluded that <b>pressurized</b> <b>pore</b> water played an important role in all three phases. An imbricate thrust stack model of glaciotectonic raft generation is presented, with the structural history of raft emplacement explained by the geometric relationships between the large-scale basal shear planes and associated deformation structures within adjacent preglacial and glacial sediments...|$|E
40|$|International audienceFluid-rock {{interactions}} {{can control}} earthquake nucleation {{and the evolution}} of earthquake sequences. Experimental studies of fault frictional properties in the presence of fluid can provide unique insights into these interactions. We report the first results from experiments performed on cohesive silicate-bearing rocks (microgabbro) in the presence of <b>pressurized</b> <b>pore</b> fluids (H 2 O, drained conditions) at realistic seismic deformation conditions. The experimental data are compared with those recently obtained from carbonate-bearing rocks (Carrara marble). Contrary to theoretical arguments, and consistent with the interpretation of some field observations, we show that frictional melting of a microgabbro develops in the presence of water. In microgabbro, the initial weakening mechanism (flash melting of the asperities) is delayed in the presence of water; conversely, in calcite marble the weakening mechanism (brittle failure of the asperities) is favored. This opposite behavior highlights the importance of host-rock composition in controlling dynamic (frictional) weakening in the presence of water: cohesive carbonate-bearing rocks are more prone to slip in the presence of water, whereas the presence of water might delay or inhibit the rupture nucleation and propagation in cohesive silicate-bearing rocks...|$|E
40|$|The {{evolution}} of subsurface <b>pressurized</b> <b>pores,</b> originating blisters during heat treatment cycles, on High Pressure Die Cast components made of Al-Si-Cu alloys was studied using a Finite Element Model {{in order to}} understand under which conditions blister form even below 400 °C. The initial defect geometry, depth, inner pressure and the maximum temperature of the thermal cycle were varied in limited ranges, while the material was modelled as elastoplastic, considering creep effects negligible. Results suggested that blisters develop as a result of high plastic strain accumulation in localized regions lying between the pore and the outer surface and that blisters can form even at temperatures of 350 - 370 °C. The simulations were experimentally validated by two sets of experiments carried out on cast parts, monitoring the surface and volume {{evolution of}} subsurface defects coupled by optical microscopy and microtomography analyses...|$|R
40|$|To {{facilitate}} {{the design and}} development of porous metals, simulation of their mechanical behavior is essential. As an alternative to complex tomography procedures, a methodology has been developed to construct a simulated microstruc-ture that retains the essential features of the experimental material. The target material is a moderate porosity titanium foam that is being developed as a bone implant material. The methodology applies stereology theory to a foaming process based on growth of <b>pressurized</b> <b>pores.</b> Three-dimensional (3 D) pore size and pore distribution information is derived from 2 D sections for a sample with low porosity, early in the foaming process. A 3 D microstructure is developed based on the 3 D location and size distribution of the pores by use of a computational procedure. Pores are allowed to grow and coalesce in a simple simulated foaming process to achieve microstructures of higher porosity. These data {{have been used as}} inputs to write scripts of I-DEAS to create 3 D finite element models which are then examined for basic global and local mechan-ical properties...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We {{present a}} new {{three-dimensional}} {{inventory of the}} southern San Francisco Bay area faults {{and use it to}} calculate stress applied principally by the 1989 M = 7. 1 Loma Prieta earthquake and to compare fault seismicity rates before and after 1989. The major high-angle right-lateral faults exhibit a different response to the stress change than do minor oblique (right-lateral/thrust) faults. Seismicity on oblique-slip faults in the southern Santa Clara Valley thrust belt increased where the faults were unclamped. The strong dependence of seismicity change on normal stress change implies a high coefficient of static friction. In contrast, we observe that faults with significant offset (> 50 - 100 km) behave differently; microseismicity on the Hayward fault diminished where right-lateral shear stress was reduced and where it was unclamped by the Loma Prieta earthquake. We observe a similar response on the San Andreas fault zone in southern California after the Landers earthquake sequence. Additionally, the offshore San Gregorio fault shows a seismicity rate increase where right-lateral/oblique shear stress was increased by the Loma Prieta earthquake despite also being clamped by it. These responses are consistent with either a low coefficient of static friction or high pore fluid pressures within the fault zones. We can explain the different behavior of the two styles of faults if those with large cumulative offset become impermeable through gouge buildup; coseismically <b>pressurized</b> <b>pore</b> fluids could be trapped and negate imposed normal stress changes, whereas in more limited offset faults, fluids could rapidly escape. The difference in behavior between minor and major faults may explain why frictional failure criteria that apply intermediate coefficients of static friction can be effective in describing the broad distributions of aftershocks that follow large earthquakes, since many of these events occur both inside and outside major fault zones. 1...|$|E
40|$|The Triassic Evaporites (TE) of the Umbria-Marche Apennines, a {{sedimentary}} succession {{made up of}} {{a sequence}} of alternating sulphates (anhydrites and gypsum) and dolostones, represent a key lithology in terms of sealing properties and earthquake triggering. Here we: (1) report laboratory measurements of density, porosity, Vp, Vs, seismic anisotropy and permeability at effective confining pressures from 0 to 100 MPa, conducted on samples of TE collected from both outcrops and boreholes; and (2) attempt to upscale the laboratory results to larger scale geophysical investigation, such as Vp sonic logs, seismic tomography and in situ measurements of pore-fluid pressure. The average laboratory P-wave velocity is 6. 0 km/s for dolostones, 4. 6 km/s for gypsum-dolostones and 5. 8 km/s for anhydrites, at ambient pressure. As effective confining pressure is increased up to 100 MPa, the average P-wave velocity increases to 7. 0 km/s for dolostones, 5. 3 km/s for gypsum and 6. 4 km/s for anhydrites. Vp/Vs ratios appear to be independent of confining pressure, with average values of ~ 1. 8 to ~ 2. 2 for sulphates and ~ 1. 9 to ~ 2. 2 for dolostones, respectively, for dry and saturated conditions. All samples are characterized by very low permeability (10 - 18 m 2 to 10 - 21 m 2), with the higher values for gypsum-dolostones and fractured dolostones samples. The Vp profiles obtained from ultrasonic laboratory measurements match well the in situ Vp profiles measured using sonic logs. In the laboratory, the Vp/Vs ratio increases when <b>pressurized</b> <b>pore</b> fluids are present, in agreement with 4 D seismic tomography that relates the increase in Vp/Vs ratio to the migration of fluids during the 1997 Umbria-Marche seismic sequence (Mmax~ 6. 0) that nucleates within the TE. Our low-permeability values are consistent with deep borehole measurements of high pore-fluid pressure trapped within the Triassic Evaporites. © 2010 Elsevier B. V...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe coupled {{mechanics}} of fluid-filled granular media controls {{the physics of}} many Earth systems, for example saturated soils, fault gouge, and landslide shear zones. It is well established that when the pore fluid pressure rises, the shear resistance of fluid-filled granular systems decreases, and, as a result, catastrophic events such as soil liquefaction, earthquakes, and accelerating landslides may be triggered. Alternatively, when the pore pressure drops, the shear resistance of these geosystems increases. Despite the great importance of the coupled {{mechanics of}} grain-fluid systems, the basic physics that controls this coupling is far from understood. Fundamental questions {{that must be addressed}} include: what are the processes that control pore fluid pressurization and depressurization in response to deformation of the granular skeleton? and how do variations of pore pressure affect the mechanical strength of the grains skeleton? To answer these questions, a formulation for the pore fluid pressure and flow has been developed from mass and momentum conservation, and is coupled with a granular dynamics algorithm that solves the grain dynamics, to form a fully coupled model. The pore fluid formulation reveals that the evolution of pore pressure obeys viscoelastic rheology in response to pore space variations. Under undrained conditions elastic-like behavior dominates and leads to a linear relationship between pore pressure and overall volumetric strain. Viscous-like behavior dominates under well-drained conditions and leads to a linear relationship between pore pressure and volumetric strain rate. Numerical simulations reveal the possibility of liquefaction under drained and initially over-compacted conditions, which were often believed to be resistant to liquefaction. Under such conditions liquefaction occurs during short compactive phases that punctuate the overall dilative trend. In addition, the previously recognized generation of elevated pore pressure under undrained compactive conditions is observed. Simulations also show that during liquefaction events stress chains are detached, the external load becomes completely supported by the <b>pressurized</b> <b>pore</b> fluid, and shear resistance vanishes...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{ability of}} crustal faults to compact and to <b>pressurize</b> <b>pore</b> fluids is {{examined}} by combining geological observations, petrophysical measurements (permeability, P and S wave velocities, and porosity), and fully coupled hydromechanical modeling. A strike-slip fault {{located in the}} Argentera-Mercantour crystalline massif (southwestern French-Italian Alps) was analyzed in the field. This mature fault belongs to a large active fault system characterized by a recurrent seismic swarm activity (Mw[*]<[*] 4) between 2 and 12 [*]km depth. The studied exposure corresponds to a 50 [*]m thick anastomosing fault composed of three types of rock: host-rock gneiss, damage-zone phyllonite, and core zone gouge. Laboratory measurements made at effective pressures ranging from 10 to 190 [*]MPa show that the studied fault differs from the classical model and has a high-porosity, high-permeability, and low-rigidity core zone surrounded by a low-porosity, low-permeability, and high-rigidity damage zone {{with respect to the}} host rock. The hydraulic and elastic properties are controlled by different microstructures such as foliation, microcracks, and pores developed during the exhumation history of the massif and the reactivation of inherited low-friction mylonitic foliation. Hydromechanical modeling is then used to investigate the spatio-temporal evolution of the fluid overpressures across the fault zone elements in response to elastic compaction. Models demonstrate that fluid pressure can be developed and maintained temporally in the studied fault zone. This study concludes on the key role played by the hydromechanical properties of faults during compaction and provides an explanation for seismic swarm triggering and maintenance...|$|R
40|$|Expansive {{reactions}} damage {{porous materials}} through {{the formation of}} reaction products of a volume {{in excess of the}} available space left by the reactants and the natural porosity of the material. This leads to <b>pressurizing</b> the <b>pore</b> space accessible to the reaction products, which differs when the chemical reaction is through-solution or topochemical or both in nature. This paper investigates expansive reactions from a micromechanical point of view, which allows bridging the scale from the local chemo-mechanical mechanisms to the macroscopically observable stress-free expansion. In particular, the study of the effect of morphology of the pore space, in which the chemical expansion occurs locally, on the macroscopically observable expansion is the main focus of this paper. The first part revisits the through-solution and the topochemical reaction mechanism within the framework of micro–macro-homogenization theories, and the effect of the microscopic geometry of pores and microcracks in the solid matrix on the macroscopic chemical expansion is examined. The second part deals with the transition from a topochemical to a through-solution-like mechanism that occurs in a solid matrix with inclusions (cracks, pores) of different morphology...|$|R
40|$|For fluid-filled {{closed cell}} {{composites}} widely distributed in nature, the configuration evolution and effective elastic properties are investigated using a micromechanical model and a multiscale homogenization theory, {{in which the}} effect of initial fluid pressure is considered. Based on the configuration evolution of the composite, we present a novel micromechanics model to examine the interactions between the initial fluid pressure and the macroscopic elasticity of the material. In this model, the initial fluid pressure of the closed cells and the corresponding configuration can be produced by applying an eigenstrain at the introduced fictitious stress-free configuration, and the pressure-induced initial microscopic strain is derived. Through a configuration analysis, we find the initial fluid pressure has a prominent effect on the effective elastic properties of freestanding materials containing <b>pressurized</b> fluid <b>pores,</b> and a new explicit expression of effective moduli is then given {{in terms of the}} initial fluid pressure. Meanwhile, the classical multiscale homogenization theory for calculating the effective moduli of a periodical heterogeneous material is generalized to include the pressurized fluid "inclusion" effect. Considering the coupling between matrix deformation and fluid pressure in closed cells, the multiscale homogenization method is utilized to numerically determine the macroscopic elastic properties of such composites at the unit cell level with specific boundary conditions. The present micromechanical model and multiscale homogenization method are illustrated by several numerical examples for validation purposes, and good agreements are achieved. The results show that the initial pressure of the fluid phase can strengthen overall effective bulk modulus but has no contribution to the shear modulus of fluid-filled closed cell composites. <br /...|$|R
30|$|Contrary to {{expectations}} {{based on its}} low Mohs scratch hardness, serpentines, serpentinites and serpentinized peridotites deformed in the lab are surprisingly strong {{in the absence of}} free water. At confining pressures of a few kilobars or more and temperatures below 400 °C to 500 °C (i.e., within the serpentine P-T stability fields) experiments show that serpentinites are ductile, but have ultimate triaxial strengths of 0.5 to 1.4  GPa at T[*]<[*] 400 °C (Raleigh and Paterson 1965; Murrell and Ishmail 1976; Moore et al. 1997; Hirth and Guillot 2013). When deformed at higher temperatures outside the stability field of serpentine while dehydrating, serpentinites form faults that slip at far lower stresses. This embrittlement is understood {{to be associated with the}} reduction of effective normal stresses by fluid pressure (Raleigh and Paterson 1965). Moreover, in the absence of <b>pressurized</b> <b>pore</b> water or adsorbed water, coefficients of friction of serpentine gouges and serpentine-serpentine sliding surfaces range from 0.6 to 0.7 under crustal conditions (Moore et al. 1996, 1997; Hirth and Guillot 2013), a range that brackets most other silicate rocks. Rock stresses in deforming serpentinites that are controlled by dry frictional resistance should therefore be high. The apparent tectonic mobility of serpentinites inferred from field observations has been an enigma from this rock mechanics perspective and the role of water released by serpentine dehydration has long been suspected as a solution to this enigma (Raleigh and Paterson 1965). We suggest that our proposed deep dehydration source of pressurized water in the forearc mantle could help mobilize upward migration of blocks of forearc mantle serpentinites above this water source, driven in part by buoyancy due to their low density, from the forearc mantle wedge and from ultramafic material in the crust above by reducing the effective normal stress along faults bounding these serpentinized blocks or slivers. The production of weak alteration products during ascent of such fluids, such as talc, chrysotile, clay minerals, and brucite, may also play a supplementary role in fault zone weakening, as suggested by others (Moore et al. 2004; Schleicher et al. 2010). The close relationships between some serpentinite blocks and their associated magnetic anomalies on the one hand and the active faults in the SAFS on the other (Figures  1, 2, and 7) suggests that emplacement may occur through mobilization of such bodies from depth by fluids generated by the process described earlier in this paper.|$|E
40|$|The {{challenge}} of the Hot Dry Rock technology {{is to develop a}} heat exchanger in deep-hot-rock masses and to circulate a fluid in order recover and to exploit the energy at the ground surface. The present day strategy at the European project is to take advantage of natural fractures that pre-exist at these depths and to improve their hydraulic properties. The extension of the area with enhanced properties must then be evaluated so that the best locations for further boreholes can be proposed. By now, this development procedure is based on fluid injections at high rates, forcing hydrau-mechanical interactions to take place along <b>pressurized</b> fractures. These <b>pore</b> pressure driven mechanisms are accompanied by some seismic activity. Some authors have developed a theory to derive the virgin hydraulic diffusivity of the reservoir from the analysis of the spatio-temporal growth of the induced seismicity. Our work is partly aimed at verifying this approach using a numerical code to solve for hydrau-mechanical interactions. It assumes that the seismic activity is controlled by a shear criterion and we show how the interpretation of spreading rate of the modelled shear activity coincide with the hydraulic diffusivity of the same fracture network, computed from an independent numerical procedure. This is important for further quantitative analysis of any reservoir open to the far field, as the overall mass balance will be linked to the – in general poorly known- hydraulic properties of the neighbouring non-stimulated areas...|$|R
