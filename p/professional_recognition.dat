Because of her superiority in her research as well as teaching, and her persistence to the idea of equality, she was honored at the “Daughters of the Desert” symposium as a leader among the women anthropologist who have worked in the Southwest. Hawley served as President of the American Society for Ethnohistory in 1969 and in 1987 she was honored as one of 45 distinguished women featured in a traveling Smithsonian exhibit named “Daughters of the Desert”.

500|$|Reich's first book, [...] ("The Impulsive Character: A Psychoanalytic Study of the Pathology of the Self"), was {{published}} in 1925.

The book won him <b>professional</b> <b>recognition,</b> including from Freud, who in 1927 arranged for his appointment to the executive committee of the Vienna Psychoanalytic Society. The appointment was made over the objection of Paul Federn, who had been Reich's second analyst in 1922 and who, according to Sharaf, regarded Reich as a psychopath.

500|$|Tippett was not {{formally}} {{a member of}} any political party or group until 1935, {{when he joined the}} British Communist Party at the urging of his cousin, Phyllis Kemp. This membership was brief; the influence of Trotsky's History of the Russian Revolution [...] had led him to embrace Trotskyism, while the party maintained a strict Stalinist line. Tippett resigned after a few months when he saw no chance of converting his local party to his Trotskyist views. According to his obituarist J.J. Plant, Tippett then joined the [...] Bolshevik-Leninist Group within the Labour Party, where he continued to advocate [...] Trotskyism until at least 1938. Although Tippett's radical instincts always remained strong, he was aware that excessive political activism would distract him from his overriding objective of becoming recognised as a composer. A significant step towards <b>professional</b> <b>recognition</b> came in December 1935, when his String Quartet No. 1 was performed by the Brosa Quartet at the Mercury Theatre in Notting Hill, London. This work, which he dedicated to Franks, is the first in the recognised canon of Tippett's music.|$|E

40|$|Background: In {{response}} to {{recruitment and retention}} issues, <b>professional</b> development <b>recognition</b> programmes for nurses have become widespread internationally.
