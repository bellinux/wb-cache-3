25|$|Professional photographers {{prefer to}} use ambient light or {{indirect}} flash, as the red-eye reduction system does not always prevent red eyes— for example, if people look away during the <b>pre-flash.</b> In addition, people do not look natural with small pupils, and direct lighting from close to the camera lens is considered to produce unflattering photographs.|$|E
50|$|The <b>pre-flash</b> occurs {{immediately}} before the main flash (except {{when using the}} camera / flash in 2nd curtain synch mode) and is barely perceptible, although {{it can be seen}} if you watch carefully for it. The <b>pre-flash</b> may cause undesirable reactions from animate objects - e.g. humans may blink as a reaction to the <b>pre-flash,</b> and have their eyes closed by the time the main flash occurs. When using flash exposure lock (FEL), the <b>pre-flash</b> is fired when FEL is activated.|$|E
50|$|A <b>pre-flash</b> is {{also used}} in FE Lock mode (flash {{exposure}} lock). In this mode, the <b>pre-flash</b> is {{used in conjunction with}} spot metering to determine the correct exposure in advance of taking the picture. Thus, the camera can be moved to reframe the main subject off-center and still expose correctly.|$|E

50|$|Many compact cameras, however, {{only have}} a {{built-in}} flash and no hotshoe and no connector for an external flash {{and there is no}} way to suppress the <b>pre-flash.</b> In those instances, slave units are used that are able to skip a number of flashes, thus skipping one or more pre-flashes and only firing simultaneously with the main flash firing. Some modern flash units have this capacity built in. An example at the low end is the Godox 18, a simple flash unit that can be set to skip a max of 3 flashes. A more advanced flash that can set to skip one <b>pre-flash</b> is the popular 'strobist' flash, the Lumopro160. Also, some studio flashes can be set to ignore <b>pre-flash.</b>|$|E
50|$|Along {{with the}} other D-series Pentax DSLRs, the Pentax *ist DS, Pentax *ist DS2, and Pentax *ist D have TTL-mode (not only P-TTL) for {{external}} flash. This allows the photographer to use cheaper TTL flashes rather than the current offerings from Pentax and Samsung with 'pre-flash' operation, which can cause some subjects to blink. Unlike red-eye reduction <b>pre-flash,</b> the P-TTL <b>pre-flash</b> for metering purposes fires only a brief moment before the main flash. Looking through the viewfinder, {{it can be seen}} before the mirror flips up.|$|E
5000|$|CCDPACK : A {{package of}} {{programs}} for reducing CCD-like data. They allow you to debias, remove dark current, <b>pre-flash,</b> flatfield, register, resample, normalize and combine your data.|$|E
50|$|Rather than {{selecting}} a specific number of <b>pre-flashes</b> to ignore, some slave units have a learning mode in which firing one flash teaches them on which flash to synchronise.|$|R
5000|$|In {{cinematography}} and photography, <b>pre-flashing</b> is {{the exposure}} of the film or other photosensor to uniform light prior to exposing it to the scene to be imaged. This adds a bias to the overall light input recorded by the sensor.|$|R
50|$|In general photography, {{this process}} is often {{referred}} to as pre-exposure or <b>pre-flashing,</b> and is used with both film and paper. It can provide greater control over lower values than simply decreasing the time the film spends in developer, as well as enhancing the response of paper to low values during printing.|$|R
50|$|E-TTL (Evaluative-Through The Lens) is a Canon EOS flash {{exposure}} {{system that}} uses a brief <b>pre-flash</b> before the main flash {{in order to obtain}} a more correct exposure. Unlike TTL and A-TTL metering, which use a dedicated flash metering sensor mounted in the base of the mirror box, E-TTL uses the same evaluative metering sensor used for ambient metering. Like TTL (and like the actual flash metering, but not the <b>pre-flash,</b> of A-TTL), the sensor is internal to the camera and takes its exposure via the lens so any filters added to the lens will also affect the E-TTL readings giving more accurate exposure information to the camera.|$|E
5000|$|The P20 hotshoe {{accessory}} flash {{is fully}} automatic with the P880. The flash tilts {{and can be}} bounced off the ceiling with automatic exposure adjustment. The P880's flash and the P20 use a <b>pre-flash</b> before the main flash so the camera's autoexposure functions properly. The <b>pre-flash</b> to shutter delay is faster with the P20 which reduces the chance of subjects blinking. The P20 has a guide number of 24 to 40 depending on zoom level at ISO 100, much {{more powerful than the}} built in flash with a GN of 9 (ISO 100). It is the number one recommended add on for the P880 to extend its usability.|$|E
5000|$|On some cameras {{the flash}} {{exposure}} measuring logic fires a <b>pre-flash</b> very quickly before the real flash. In some camera/people combinations this {{will lead to}} shut eyes in every picture taken. The blink response time seems to be around 1/10 of a second. If the exposure flash is fired at approximately this interval after the TTL measuring flash, people will be squinting or have their eyes shut. One solution may be the FEL (flash exposure lock) offered on some more expensive cameras, which allows the photographer to fire the measuring flash at some earlier time, long (many seconds) before taking the real picture. Unfortunately many camera manufacturers do not make the TTL <b>pre-flash</b> interval configurable.|$|E
25|$|Cinematographers do not “white balance” in {{the same}} way as video camera operators; they use {{techniques}} such as filters, choice of film stock, <b>pre-flashing,</b> and, after shooting, color grading, both by exposure at the labs and also digitally. Cinematographers also work closely with set designers and lighting crews to achieve the desired color effects.|$|R
50|$|The LP180 {{carried the}} feature sets {{of both the}} LP120 and LP160 {{including}} Quad-Sync, metal hotshoe foot, optical slave, and digital slave that ignores TTL <b>pre-flashes.</b> In addition the legacy features, the LP180 introduces a new sliding lock hotshoe, a 1/4-20 mounting thread {{on the side of}} the head for on-axis mounting for umbrellas, and an audible feedback recycle tone.|$|R
50|$|The LP160 is the {{successor}} to the LP120. Like its predecessor, it offers 4 ways of synchronization. It has a more power flash (GN 140 in comparison with GN 100 for the LP120), 7 power variations (full to 1/64), faster recycle time (4 sec instead of 6.5 sec), and a metal hotshoe foot. Also has an additional digital slave mode to ignore TTL <b>pre-flashes.</b>|$|R
50|$|The EOS 50 {{was also}} the first camera to {{implement}} Canon's E-TTL flash system. Canon's previous TTL system metered light reflected from the film onto a sensor during the actual exposure. E-TTL on the other hand fires a low-intensity <b>pre-flash</b> before exposure, and meters the reflected light through the camera's normal metering system.|$|E
50|$|Professional photographers {{prefer to}} use ambient light or {{indirect}} flash, as the red-eye reduction system does not always prevent red eyes — for example, if people look away during the <b>pre-flash.</b> In addition, people do not look natural with small pupils, and direct lighting from close to the camera lens is considered to produce unflattering photographs.|$|E
50|$|This {{system was}} {{carried over into}} the early EOS cameras wholesale. A-TTL largely fell out of favor, and was {{replaced}} by E-TTL (Evaluative TTL). This used a <b>pre-flash</b> for advanced metering, and used the autofocus system to judge where the main subject was for more accurate exposure. E-TTL II, which was an enhancement in the camera's firmware only, replaced E-TTL from 2004.|$|E
50|$|Practical, user-applied hypersensitizing {{techniques}} have evolved {{over most of}} the last century and fall mostly into four types of treatments. Broadly, these involve liquid phase (washing), gas phase (out-gassing and baking and hydrogenation), exposure at lowered temperature, and <b>pre-flashing.</b> Some of these can be used in combination, but many severely shorten the shelf-life of a product and so can not be applied by the manufacturer.|$|R
50|$|Now, digital image-processing {{technology}} can pull details out of shadow areas without risking destroying the dailies or rushes. However, current digital image chips are still limited {{in the light}} intensity range over which they can record detail. Depending on the scenario it might be still be beneficial to use <b>pre-flashing</b> devices to lift up the general exposure to lift the darkest parts above the threshold where excessive sensor noise is present.|$|R
50|$|To {{resolve the}} issues of optical triggering, camera {{accessory}} manufacturers (e.g., PocketWizard, Cactus) have developed radio devices to trigger shoemount flashes wirelessly. Radio signals can easily transmit to a longer distance. They would not be wrongly triggered by <b>pre-flashes.</b> The off-camera flashes {{do not have to}} be placed in the line of sight with the camera. Comparatively, with radio triggering, photographers have more freedom to locate the off-camera flashes.|$|R
50|$|Distillation {{of crude}} oil is {{typically}} performed either under atmospheric pressure and under a vacuum. Low boiling fractions usually vaporize below 400 °C at atmospheric pressure without cracking the hydrocarbon compounds. Therefore, all the low boiling fractions {{of crude oil}} are separated by atmospheric distillation. A crude distillation unit (CDU) consists of <b>pre-flash</b> distillation column. The petroleum products obtained from the distillation process are light, medium, and heavy naphtha, kerosene, diesel, and oil residue.|$|E
50|$|Advanced models use {{automatic}} {{focus and}} have variable apertures. They all have light meters. They use electric motors to advance and rewind the film. They {{are much more}} versatile than the low-end models. They {{are also likely to}} have zoom lenses, more advanced auto-focus systems, exposure systems with manual controls, larger apertures and sharper lenses. They may have special lamps or <b>pre-flash</b> systems designed to reduce red eye in flash pictures of people.|$|E
50|$|Several camera {{equipment}} manufacturers have support for remote flash triggering built into {{at least some}} of their camera and flash models. This eliminates the issue of slave flashes triggering upon seeing a <b>pre-flash,</b> as the master flash unit (whether a shoemount flash or the camera's pop-up flash) sends predefined signals to the slave units to control them. However, the user is restricted to using flash units from that camera manufacturer, or a limited selection of third-party units which are compatible with it.|$|E
5000|$|Digital TTL {{works as}} follows: Before the actual {{exposure}} {{one or more}} small flashes, called [...] "preflashes", are emitted. The light returning through the lens is measured and this value {{is used to calculate}} the amount of light necessary for the actual exposure. Multiple <b>pre-flashes</b> can be used to improve the flash output. Canon refers to this technique as [...] "E-TTL" [...] and has later improved the system with [...] "E-TTL II". The first form of digital TTL by Nikon, called [...] "D-TTL", was used in a few early models. Since then, the superior [...] "i-TTL" [...] system has been used.|$|R
40|$|Several {{research}} platforms {{are available}} {{for the development of}} ultrasound applications and algorithm designs but they are all limited by its digitalization frequency ranging up to 80 MHz for standard medical imaging. Using transducers with mid frequencies above 20 MHz for high resolution (bio-) medical imaging, small animal imaging, skin imaging or non-destructive material testing requires ultrasound devices with higher sampling rates. Based on the ultrasound research platform 'DiPhAS' we realized the high frequency version of the beamformer with a digitalization rate of up to 480 MHz at all 128 channels. Each channel is built individually because no integrated circuits with multiple channels are commercially available for such a high digitalization rate. Transmission can be done with <b>pre-flashed</b> but customizable excitation sequences and output voltage up to 22 Vpp. The received data can be accessed as single element channel data of all 128 channels in parallel and transferred to a PC via Gigabit Ethernet or PCI-Express. Beamforming can be done on a massive parallel computing graphics processor (GPU). Online and offline software packages including closed loop control and filtering interfaces for Matlab, C++ and C# are used to process, analyze and visualize the data to characterize the beamformer. The system was set up successfully and evaluated and characterized for biomedical imaging methods using three 128 element ultrasound arrays (all designed by Fraunhofer IBMT) working at center frequencies of 35 MHz, 52 MHz and 56 MHz. The applications demonstrate the performance of the system to meet real time and signal quality demands for high frequency ultrasound imaging...|$|R
40|$|Photographic {{processing}} and lithographic printing reproduction {{are two different}} processes. In photography, the transparency reproduces the original scene in continuous tone. Whereas, in lithographic printing, the reproduction {{is a result of}} an all-or-nothing process. A transparency may have a tonal range that exceeds the range that can be reproduced in lithographic printing. So tone compression is performed on transparencies that exceed the tonal range for printing. Avoiding tone compression during lithographic production results in considerable savings in cost and time. One of the methods to reduce tonal range is for the photographer to understand the relationship between emulsion flashing and the tonal range of transparencies. Flashing is the process of projecting nonimage white light to the film emulsion either before or after exposure, but prior to processing. This study investigated the relationship between flashing and exposure for a transparency which would reduce its tonal range and make it suitable for printing. The hypotheses under investigation were: (1) it is possible to flash Ektachrome transparency film by a predetermined amount of light to produce a desired reduction in the tonal range of a transparency, making it more acceptable to the printing range of lithographic printing when using coated paper; (2) the post-flashing technique produces the most acceptable result in achieving the desired tonal range as compared to the <b>pre-flashing</b> technique; (3) the flashing technique produces the same result in a transparency as the image prepared by the use of adjusting the lighting ratio in measured photography. An experimental investigation was conducted. A setup consisting of standard scales was photographed at various exposures and different degrees of flashing. The photography was performed using a 4 X 5 camera. The setup was illuminated at 45 angles by means of two strobe lights. Exposure was controlled by altering the aperture opening of the lens or fstop. The degree of flashing was determined by pre-exposing or post-exposing the Ektachrome transparency film emulsion to non-image white light through sheets of parchment paper placed at a distance of three inches from the camera lens. The amount of light that could reach the lens during flashing was controlled by varying the number of sheets of parchment paper. Thirty-two transparencies were photographed. The transparencies were processed by E- 6 process. The tonal ranges of the transparencies were measured by means of a transmission densitometer. A visual test was conducted to determine the visual appeal of the transparencies by professionals in the field of photography and printing. The outcome of the experimental investigation showed that the tonal range of a transparency is reduced when the film emulsion is flashed. The results suggest that preflashing by an amount of a little over one-third of the light required for normal exposure and then exposing the film to the subject or setup at one and a half stop below the normal exposure produces transparencies that have a tonal range within the limits of lithographic printing and that are visually appealing. It was also shown that <b>pre-flashing</b> the film had a greater effect on reducing the tonal range than post-flashing. Moreover, the flashing technique was compared with methods used to reduce the tonal range by adjusting the lighting ratio. Based on these results, the first hypothesis was confirmed, the second was rejected, and the third was qualitatively accepte...|$|R
5000|$|In {{addition}} to the central contact point, many cameras have additional metal contacts within the [...] "U" [...] of the hot shoe. These are proprietary connectors that allow for more communication between the camera and a [...] "dedicated flash". A dedicated flash can communicate information about its power rating to the camera, set camera settings automatically, transmit color temperature data about the emitted light, and can be commanded to light a focus-assist light or fire a lower-powered <b>pre-flash</b> for focus-assist, metering assist or red-eye effect reduction.|$|E
50|$|Speedlight is {{the brand}} name used by Nikon Corporation for their {{photographic}} flash units, used since the company's introduction of strobe flashes in the 1960s. Nikon's standalone Speedlights (those not built into the company's cameras) have the SB- prefix {{as part of their}} model designation. Current Speedlights and other Nikon accessories make up part of Nikon's Creative Lighting System (CLS), which includes the Advanced Wireless Lighting, that enables various Nikon cameras to control multiple Nikon flash units in up to three separate controlled groups by sending encoded <b>pre-flash</b> signals to slave units.|$|E
50|$|Some {{electronic}} flash units {{can send}} out several short bursts {{of light to}} aid the autofocus system or for wireless communication with off-camera flash units. A <b>pre-flash</b> {{is often used to}} determine the amount of light that is reflected from the subject, which sets the duration of the main flash at time of exposure. Some cameras also employ automatic fill-flash, where the flash light and the available light are balanced. While these capabilities are not unique to the SLR, manufacturers included them early on in the top models, whereas the best rangefinder cameras adopted such features later.|$|E
40|$|H. C. Helgeson {{noted in}} 1968 that the {{salinity}} of the brine in the geothermal reservoir within the Salton Sea geothermal system generally increases {{from the top}} {{to the bottom and}} from the center to the sides. He also noted that pressure measurements at perforations in cased wells seemed to indicate that the formation fluids at the depths of production have a specific density about equal to 1, and that hot concentrated brines apparently exist in pressure equilibrium with comparatively cold dilute pore waters in the surrounding rocks. Since 1968 there have been no published reports that dispute these observations. However, a very high heat flux through the top of the system seems to require a substantial component of convective transfer of heat beneath an impermeable cap, whereas the apparent salinity gradient with depth seems to require little or no free convection of brine. This paradox may be resolved if double-diffusive convection is the main process that controls the depth-temperature-salinity relations. Such convection provides a mechanism for transferring heat from the bottom {{to the top of the}} hydrothermal system while maintaining vertical and horizontal salinity gradients—densities remaining close to unity. In 1981, Griffiths showed experimentally that layered double-diffusive convection cells may develop in porous media when hot saline waters underlie more dilute cooler waters. However, nagging questions remain about whether fluid densities within the Salton Sea geothermal system really adjust to unity in response to changing temperature and salinity at depths greater than about 1 km. The State 2 - 14 well, the Salton Sea Scientific Drill Hole, has provided one high-quality data point for a depth interval of 1, 865 - 1, 877 m, where the temperature is about 305 º C. The calculated density of the <b>pre-flashed</b> reservoir fluid sampled from that depth is 1. 0008 ± 0. 0023...|$|R
40|$|Purpose:Rod-cone gap {{junctions}} (GJs) in mammals {{are thought}} of being an escape route for rod signals when incoming light is greater than a few sparse photons and the rod-rod bipolar synapse is saturated. While indirect evidence suggest that this pathway is dynamically regulated by light and circadian rhythm, the only direct functional tests so far, done in Macaque, have found rod-cone coupling to be static. We optimized patch recordings from mouse cones to investigate the impact and regulatory latitude of rod-cone coupling. Methods:Cones (n= 55) were recorded with perforated patch-clamp in retinal slices from wt mice, and from animals lacking connexin isoform 36 (Cx 36 -KO). Photovoltage responses were evoked with green/UV stimulation protocols, consisting of dim (16. 6 ph/µm 2) and bright (1570 or 3140 ph/µm 2) flashes, designed to dissect and quantify rod input through differences in light sensitivity, kinetics of recovery from saturation and spectral preference. Control recordings in rods were also performed. Results:Most wt cones expressed rod-like features, including: (1) responses to dim flashes (> 1 mV in 23 of 42); (2) responses to bright flashes followed by slow plateaus and a transient suppression of dim flash responses; (3) slow recovery of dim flash responses and plateaus upon return to darkness after prolonged rod-saturating light background. While some cones expressed rod features {{at the beginning of}} the recording, most cones acquired them progressively starting from seal formation, with a time course of minutes. Irrespective of their intrinsic spectral type (G- or UV-preferring, as determined with rod-saturating <b>pre-flashes)</b> for dim flashes cones preferred G, in line with rods (n= 15). Medium-large dim flash responses were observed in both M and S/M cones, while, of two S cones recorded, only one had a small response. Dim and bright flash responses had different reversal potentials, consistent with an origin in separate electrotonic compartments. The involvement of GJs was confirmed with the specific antagonist meclofenamic acid (100 µM), which abolished dim flash responses. In contrast to wt animals, in Cx 36 -KO mice cones did not appear to be able to couple to rods. Conclusions:Mouse cones can couple remarkably well to rods and acquire a rod-like functional phenotype. Coupling strength varies among cones and is able to undergo rapid up-regulation triggered by perturbation of the intracellular milieu...|$|R
40|$|A {{holographic}} dielectric grating is a {{diffraction grating}} comprised of a periodic {{variation of the}} refractive index of a medium, and is produced by the interference pattern of two monochromatic waves. Emphasis is placed upon photographic emulsion as the medium for recording the pattern, but the treatment is general and includes any material that can have an internal modulation of the refractive index. Three topics are treated: the effective dielectric constant of the emulsion, the diffraction of light by dielectric gratings, and the techniques for producing gratings with high efficiency and good resolution. The photographic emulsion is treated as an artificially loaded material, i. e. as a suspension of grains in a gelatin base. A Mie scattering theory analysis is used {{and the effect of}} adjacent scatterers on the local field is accounted for by the Lorentz-Lorenz relation. The optical density of the emulsion is shown to be proportional to the number of grains present. The effective index variation after bleaching is proportional to the pre-bleached optical density, which implies that the emulsion should have a linear density vs. exposure curve to effect a sinusoidally modulated index of refraction. A relation between the modulation transfer function (MTF) of bleached and unbleached emulsion is derived. Means for improvement of the MTF is also obtained analytically. The diffraction of light by a dielectric grating is analyzed using the Raman-Nath formalism which is generalized to include loss. Graphs are presented showing the diffraction efficiency versus the index modulation {{for a wide range of}} thicknesses and loss. The peak efficiency for arbitrary emulsion thickness can be obtained from measurements at a specific thickness. The conclusion is reached that presently available emulsion should be made thicker, preferably in the 20 - 30 micron range. The basic physical processes of various holographic materials are described. The processing techniques of photographic emulsion are emphasized and the merits of various bleaches are evaluated. It is found that resolution can be increased by using a reversal process. The dielectric grains in an emulsion processed this way are round in shape. A desensitizing dye can be used to stabilize the grains. A method of extending the dynamic range of the photographic emulsion using a <b>pre-flashing</b> exposure technique is also described. Several experiments are proposed, and recommendations are made which may serve as guide-lines for the development of more suitable materials for holographic recording...|$|R
