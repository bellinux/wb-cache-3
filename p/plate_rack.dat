5000|$|Originally, {{a dresser}} {{was located in}} the kitchen and was a {{utilitarian}} piece of furniture where meat and other food was dressed or prepared, while prepared food was placed on sideboards in the dining room ready to be served. They could be modified to suit local needs; for example, dressers in the Scottish Highlands may have a [...] "porridge drawer" [...] - a tin lined drawer into which freshly made porridge was emptied and left to cool. When cold, slices of the porridge could be cut out and taken out of the house for later consumption. Gradually the purely utilitarian function of the dresser was supplemented with other functions, such as a means of displaying the best crockery in a farmhouse. Once it became a means of display the dresser could also be found in dining rooms where it served as sideboard and a place to store and display dinner ware. In the 19th century various different styles of ceramics would evolve to fill the <b>plate</b> <b>racks</b> of the Welsh dressers of Wales and {{to meet the needs of}} the Welsh market.

40|$|This paper {{reports a}} {{parametric}} stress analysis of various configurations of <b>rack</b> <b>plate</b> stiffened multi-planar welded KK joints using the finite element method. The KK joint finds application {{in the leg}} structure of offshore Oil & Gas jack-up platforms. The <b>rack</b> <b>plate</b> is a dual purpose element of the joint because it firstly functions as a stiffener which reduces the stress concentration at the brace/chord intersection. This could be an immense contribution {{to the increase in}} fatigue life of the joint but other hot spot sites are introduced to the joint. The rack is also used for raising and lowering of the jack-up hull which gives the jack-up platform its jacking capability. Over 120 models using a combination of shell and solid elements were built and analysed within ABAQUS. Non-dimensional joint geometric parameters; β, γ and Ω were employed in the study with Ω being defined as the ratio of rack thickness to chord diameter. Stress Concentration Factors (SCFs) were calculated under applied axial and OPB (out-of-plane-bending) loading. Three critical SCF locations were identified for each load case, with each location becoming the most critical based on the combination of the non-dimensional parameters selected for the joint. This is important as careful design can shift the critical SCF from an area inaccessible to NDT to one that can be easily inspected. The SCF values extracted from the models were used to derive six parametric equations through multiple regression analysis performed using MINITAB. The equations describe the SCF at the different locations {{as a function of the}} non-dimensional ratios. The equations not only allow the rapid optimisation of multi-planar joints but also can be used to quickly identify the location of maximum stress concentration and hence the likely position of fatigue cracks. This in itself is an invaluable tool for planning NDT procedures and schedules...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Sn {{whiskers}} {{can grow}} spontaneously {{on the surface}} in Sn alloy coatings. This paper focused on the mechanism of whisker growth on the pure Sn coating to Cu leads in electronic components. After the <b>rack</b> <b>plating</b> process the pure Sn coating was annealed at 150 ºC for one hour and measured about 10 µm in thickness. Then samples endured the high temperature/humidity storage tests (60 °C and 87 %RH) from 1 month to 6 months. The experimental results revealed that Sn whiskers were prone to grow from the surface with local corrosion in the Sn coating. This was the high temperature/humidity storage provided much moisture to cause an electrochemistry corrosion between Sn and H 2 O. The excess formation of SnO 2 had a large molar volume comparing to Sn and this generated a high inner stress in the corroded areas to shear the coating surface producing the defects. The compressive stress deriving from the formation of Cu-Sn intermetallic compounds drove Sn whiskers initially grew from the corroded areas...|$|R
40|$|To {{demonstrate}} {{the dissolution of}} plated iron in molten lead-free solder {{and the effect of}} iron-plating conditions on reactions in molten lead-free solder, the reaction test between Sn- 3. 0 Ag- 0. 5 Cu (mass%) solder and plated iron was performed. An Iron-plated copper plate, which was made by electroplating iron onto an oxygen-free copper substrate, was used as the test piece. The reaction test was carried out by using an oven in normal air. The solder was placed on the test piece and it was put into an oven held at 400, 430 and 460 C. The interface between the solder and plated iron was particularly examined. It was found that the intermetallic compound of FeSn 2 was formed at the interface regardless of the plating conditions. The results showed that the grain size of plated iron decreased with the increased current density and the dissolution thickness of plated iron in molten lead-free solder increased with the increased current density in the <b>rack</b> <b>plating.</b> In the barrel plating, the grain size was rather small in all the test pieces and the dissolution thickness was rather thick. Thus it has been made clear that the dissolution of plated iron in molten lead-free solder is attributable to the grain size of plated iron...|$|R

The house, after we had repaired the worst of the damages, and filled in some of the doors and windows with white cotton cloth, became a healthy and a pleasant dwelling-place, always airy and dry, and haunted by the outdoor perfumes of the glen.

A single shower of rain, to be sure, and we should have been drowned out like mice. But ours was a Californian summer, and an earthquake was a far likelier accident than a shower of rain.|$|R
