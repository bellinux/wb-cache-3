50|$|Lipases serve {{important}} roles in human practices as ancient as yogurt and cheese fermentation. However, lipases are also being exploited as cheap and versatile catalysts to degrade lipids in more modern applications. For instance, a biotechnology company has brought recombinant lipase enzymes to market for use in applications such as baking, laundry detergents and even as biocatalysts in alternative energy strategies to convert vegetable oil into fuel. High enzyme activity lipase can replace traditional catalyst in processing biodiesel, as this enzyme replaces chemicals in a process which is otherwise highly energy intensive, and can be more environmentally friendly and safe. Industrial application of lipases requires <b>process</b> <b>intensification</b> for continuous processing using tools like continuous flow microreactors at small scale.

Adjacent to Castner-Kellner site was Rocksavage works, where a variety of chemicals based on chlorine products were manufactured, including Chloromethanes, Arklone dry cleaning fluid, Trichloethylene degreasing fluid and the Arcton range of CFCs. Also on that site were PVC manufacture and HF (Hydrogen fluoride) manufacture. At Runcorn Heath Research Laboratories, technical support, research and development for Mond Division products was carried out, and the support sections included chemical plan design and engineering sections. Just {{to the north of}} Runcorn, on an island between the Manchester Ship Canal and the River Mersey could be found the Wigg Works, which had been erected originally for producing poison gas in wartime. In Widnes could also be found several factories producing weedkillers and other products.

40|$|The {{dawn of the}} new {{millennium}} saw a trend towards the dedicated use of microfluidic devices for <b>process</b> <b>intensification</b> in biotechnology. As the last decade went by, it became evident that this pattern was not a short-lived fad, since the deliverables related to this field of research have been consistently piling-up. The application of <b>process</b> <b>intensification</b> in biotechnology is therefore seemingly catching up with the trend already observed in the chemical engineering area, where the use of microfluidic devices has already been upgraded to production scale.

Other reactive distillation studies reported for this system based on heterogeneously catalyzed reaction include those carried out in continuous mode [16, 17, 18, 19, 20], in batch mode [21] and in semi-batch mode [22, 23, 24, 25, 26].|$|E
40|$|One of {{the best}} ways of {{preventing}} accidents is to avoid hazards by inherently safer design. As many processes, particularly those in the chemicals, nuclear and oil industries, involve the production, handling and use of hazardous substances, <b>process</b> <b>intensification</b> (PI) apparently offers to the plant managers many benefits such as safer, cleaner, smaller, and cheaper equipments. <b>Process</b> <b>Intensification</b> could lead to a higher process flexibility, increased inherent safety and energy efficiency, distributed manufacturing capability, and ability to use reactants at higher concentrations. These goals are achieved by multifunctional reactors, e. g. reactive distillation or membrane reactors, and miniaturization that can be done by employing micro reactors and/or improving heat and mass transfer. Within the benefits of <b>process</b> <b>intensification</b> with reference to process safety the following can be considered: The use of <b>process</b> <b>intensification</b> can reduce the number of process operations, which leads to fewer transfer operations and less pipework, preventing source of leakages; It can be easier to design a smaller vessel to contain the maximum pressure of any probable explosion; For exothermic reactions, the enhanced specific surface area of intensified plants makes heat transfer, and thus heat removal, easier, minimising the triggering potential of a runaway reaction. <b>Process</b> <b>intensification</b> has thus {{the potential to be a}} significant factor in the implementation of inherent safety practices Although safety can benefit from <b>process</b> <b>intensification,</b> it should be ensured that new hazards are not created. This can be obtained applying at a early design stage the reliability and safety analysis that are traditionally used in process risk assessment. In this paper in particular the above techniques are applied to a VOC (Volatile organic compound) treatment plant, comparing the traditional plant (a fixed bed reactor) to the intensified reverse flow reactor. From the results of the application of a recursive operability analysis and the successive fault trees fully quantified, some conclusions are drawn from the point of view of the reliability of intensified processes and from the adequateness of risk assessment methodologie...|$|E

40|$|AbstractConventional {{energy sources}} are limited and non-renewable and their {{consumption}} contributes to greenhouse gas emissions. The {{world is in}} need of advanced biorefineries to meet ever growing energy demands associated with population growth and economic development. An advanced biorefinery should use renewable and sustainable (both in quality and quantity) feedstock that gives rise to higher energy gains with minimum non-renewable energy and resource consumption. Development of advanced biorefineries is currently encircled by two major issues. The first issue is to ensure adequate biofuel feedstock supplies while the second issue is to develop resource-efficient technologies for the feedstock conversion to maximize energy and economic and environmental benefits. While microalgae, microbial derived oils, and agricultural biomass and other energy crops show great potential for meeting current energy demands in a sustainable manner, <b>process</b> <b>intensification</b> and associated synergism can improve the resource utilization efficiency. Synergism of <b>process</b> <b>intensification</b> tools is important to increase energy efficiency, reduce chemical utilization and associated environmental impacts, and finally process economics. Among the many <b>process</b> <b>intensification</b> methods, this commentary provides a perspective on the essential role of MWs and US and their synergy in biofuel production.
