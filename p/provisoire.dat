25|$|The Provisional Government of the French Republic (gouvernement <b>provisoire</b> de la République Française or GPRF) {{was officially}} {{created by the}} CNFL and succeeded it on 3 June 1944, the day before de Gaulle arrived in London from Algiers on Churchill's invitation, and three days before D-Day. Its {{creation}} marked the re-establishment of France as a republic, and the official end of Free France. Among its most immediate concerns were to ensure that France did not come under allied military administration, preserving the sovereignty of France and freeing Allied troops for fighting on the front.|$|E
25|$|On 20 June 2014, the two Chambers of the Swiss Parliament {{passed the}} Total Revision of the Federal Law Concerning the Acquisition and Loss of Swiss Nationality (Révision totale de la loi sur l'acquisition et la perte de la nationalité suisse). The Law, first {{introduced}} in 2011 by the Swiss federal government, aimed to lower, among other requirements, the residency requirement from 12 years to 8 years. During the parliamentary debates {{and the ensuing}} disagreements between the more conservative National Council (lower house) and the more liberal Council of States (upper house), the residency requirements were increased to 10 years. The time spent in Switzerland {{between the ages of}} 8 and 18 is doubled for purposes of applying for naturalisation, however, an applicant must spend at least 6 years in Switzerland. The new law also requires cantons to set a minimum residency requirement of between 2 and 5 years, as well as requiring applicants to have a permanent residency permit (Autorisation d'établissement), which is known as a C permit. Additionally, time spent in Switzerland with temporary admission (Permis d'admission <b>provisoire)</b> halved for purposes of applying for naturalisation. The 2014 Total Revision of the Federal Law Concerning the Acquisition and Loss of Swiss Nationality is scheduled to enter into force on 1 January 2018.|$|E

2500|$|By 1990, {{inspired}} {{by the fall of}} the Berlin Wall, a pro-democracy movement arose. Pressure from the United States, France, and from a group of locally represented countries and agencies called GIBAFOR (France, the USA, Germany, Japan, the EU, the World Bank, and the UN) finally led Kolingba to agree, in principle, to hold free elections in October 1992 with help from the UN Office of Electoral Affairs.

2500|$|Marie Angélique Foulon {{was born}} in 1793 to Nicolas Foulon and Madeleine Marotte du Coudray. Nicolas Foulon was an apostate Benedictine monk, who at one point drew up a French breviary to replace the Roman Catholic one. [...] He left and was {{expelled}} from the Jansenist monastery of Blancs-Manteaux in Paris {{at the time of}} the French Revolution. [...] His revolutionary political involvement reportedly included being bailiff at the Council of 500, and serving in the Tribunat and Senate. [...] Madeleine Marotte du Coudray had been raised in a severe Jansenist family. Because of opposition from her family, the couple lived together for several years and had at least one child before formally declaring their union in a civil ceremony on January 11, 1793, as a mariage <b>provisoire.</b> [...] Marie Angélique was the second of their four children. [...] Her older sister, also named Marie, was born [...] September 24, 1791, and is noted in the marriage declaration.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. The Federal {{government}} of the United States has, {{over a number of}} years, entered into provisional commitments with various owners and agencies in respect to areas of land in Alaska which, in aggregate, exceed the land area of the State by 22 %. It is now under pressure from sundry agenciw and interest groups to bring additional areas into existing systems of conservation without due study of the problems involved. There will be a consequent lessening in the chances of the State and its Native peoples achieving economic self-sufficiency within a programme of planned land use and protection of the environment. There is need for a single manager of Federal lands, unaffiliated with any existing agencies. &UM & Engagements concernant les terres d’Alaska.

2500|$|In March 1915, Joffre {{concluded}} that a period of inactivity would benefit the Germans more than the French; General Ferdinand Foch, commander of the Groupe <b>Provisoire</b> du Nord (GPN), proposed an offensive in which a [...] "general action" [...] on the Western Front including the British, to confuse the defenders and pin down reserves, would complement a [...] "decisive action", {{to break through the}} German defences, at a place where the Germans {{would not be able to}} establish a new defensive front by a short retirement. Joffre accepted the proposals on 23 March, with the objective being the seizure of Vimy Ridge and exploitation of the success by an eastwards advance into the Douai plain. The French army had not completed an adaptation to siege warfare and much of the equipment necessary, particularly heavy artillery, did not exist. It had been impossible to synchronise operations in Artois with the First Battle of Champagne, which ended on 17 March. Debate within the army as to means and ends had led to two schools of thought: those who like Joffre favoured [...] "continuous battle" [...] (an attack without pause involving all resources) and advocates of [...] "methodical battle" [...] like Foch, who wanted to conduct offensives as series of attacks, with pauses to reorganise and consolidate.|$|E
2500|$|On 27 October 1940, the Empire Defense Council (Conseil de défense de l'Empire) was {{constituted}} to organise {{the rule}} of the territories in central Africa, Asia and Oceania that had heeded the 18 June call. It was replaced on 24 September 1941 by the French National Committee (Comité national français or CNF). On 13 July 1942, [...] "Free France" [...] was officially renamed France combattante ("Fighting France"), to mark that the struggle against the Axis was conducted both externally by the FFF and internally by the French Forces of the Interior (FFI). After the reconquest of North Africa, this was in turn formally merged with de Gaulle's rival general Henri Giraud's command in Algiers to form the French Committee of National Liberation (Comité français de Libération nationale or CFNL). Exile officially ended with the capture of Paris by the 2nd Armoured Free French Division and Resistance forces on 25 August 1944, ushering in the Provisional Government of the French Republic (gouvernement <b>provisoire</b> de la République française or GPRF). It ruled France {{until the end of the}} war and afterwards to 1946, when the Fourth Republic was established, thus ending the series of interim regimes that had succeeded the Third Republic after its fall in 1940.|$|E
2500|$|In September 1991 {{the army}} {{performed}} a coup against him (1991 Haitian coup d'état), led by army general Raoul Cédras, {{who had been}} promoted by Aristide in June to {{commander in chief of}} the army. Aristide was deposed on 29 September 1991, and after several days sent into exile, his life only saved by the intervention of US, French and Venezuelan diplomats. In accordance with the requirements of article 149 of the Haitian Constitution, Superior Court justice Joseph Nérette was installed as président <b>provisoire</b> to serve until elections were held within 90 days of Aristide's resignation. However, real power was held by army commander Raoul Cédras. The elections were scheduled, but were cancelled under pressure from the United States government. Aristide and other sources claim that both the coup and the election cancellation were the result of pressure from the American government. High-ranking members of the Haitian National Intelligence Service (SIN), which had been set up and financed in the 1980s by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) as part of the war on drugs, were involved in the coup, and were reportedly still receiving funding and training from the CIA for intelligence-gathering activities at the time of the coup, but this funding reportedly ended after the coup. The New York Times said that [...] "No evidence suggests that the C.I.A backed the coup or intentionally undermined President Aristide." [...] However, press reports about possible CIA involvement in Haitian politics before the coup sparked congressional hearings in the United States.|$|E
40|$|Roland Lew, The East : What {{is being}} Done, and Undone There {{are several ways}} of {{understanding}} {{the changes that are}} occuring in the East. New personalities and strikingly dramatic events, such as the self-dissolution of actually existing socialism, can be referred to. In addition, the re-emergence of older cultural and social patterns such as cultural nationalism and religious sentiments is remarkable. There now is no choice but to call into question much received wisdom about existing socialism. The modernist pretentions of Stalinism enjoy no credibility and, more generally, much of what has been constructed in the East under existing socialism must be rejected. However, prudence requires a careful consideration of the bureaucratization of the whole of these societies, and of the negation real social groups. Equally, the long and complexe process of the reintegration of these societies into the logic of world capitalism must be analyzed. Further, the still mysterious relation between actually existing socialism and its socialist origins needs to be more adequately elucidated. Lew Roland.
