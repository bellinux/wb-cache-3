5|$|Like most film {{adaptations of}} Dick's works, {{many aspects of}} his story were changed in their {{transition}} to film, such as the addition of Lamar Burgess and the change in setting from New York City to Washington, D.C., Baltimore, and Northern Virginia. The character of John Anderton was changed from a balding and out-of-shape old man to an athletic officer in his 40s to fit its portrayer and the film's action scenes. The film adds two stories of tragic families; Anderton's, {{and that of the}} three pre-cogs. In the short story, Anderton is married with no children, while in the film, he is the divorced father of a kidnapped son, who is most likely deceased. Although it is implied, but unclear in the film whether Agatha is related to the twin pre-cogs, her family was shattered when Burgess murdered her mother, Anne Lively. The precogs were intellectually disabled and deformed individuals in the story, but in the film, they are the genetically mutated offspring of drug addicts. Anderton's future murder and the reasons for the conspiracy were changed from a general who wants to discredit PreCrime to regain some military funding, to a man who murdered a precog's mother to preserve PreCrime. The subsequent murders and plot developed from this change. The film's ending also differs from the short story's. In Dick's story, Anderton prevents the closure of the PreCrime division, however, in the movie Anderton successfully brings {{about the end of the}} organization. Other aspects were updated to include current technology. For instance in the story, Anderton uses a <b>punch</b> <b>card</b> machine to interpret the precogs' visions; in the movie, he uses a virtual reality interface.|$|E
25|$|Stevenson ran for Governor of Illinois in 1982 and 1986, losing both {{elections}} to James R. Thompson. In 1982, the initial vote count showed Stevenson winning; however, the final official count showed him losing by 0.14 percent. Stevenson promptly petitioned the Illinois Supreme Court for a recount and presented evidence of widespread election irregularities, including {{evidence of a}} failed <b>punch</b> <b>card</b> system for tabulation of votes. Three days before the gubernatorial inauguration, the court denied the recount by a one-vote margin, asserting that the Illinois recount statute was unconstitutional.|$|E
25|$|Assuming sorted data, L-estimators {{involving}} only a {{few points}} can be calculated with far fewer mathematical operations than efficient estimates. Before the advent of electronic calculators and computers, these provided a useful way to extract {{much of the information}} from a sample with minimal labour. These remained in practical use through the early and mid 20th century, when automated sorting of <b>punch</b> <b>card</b> data was possible, but computation remained difficult, and is still of use today, for estimates given a list of numerical values in non-machine-readable form, where data input is more costly than manual sorting. They also allow rapid estimation.|$|E
50|$|One of the {{earliest}} text entry interfaces was the <b>punched</b> <b>card</b> input. A <b>punched</b> <b>card</b> input is a computer input device used to read executable computer programs, source code, and data from <b>punched</b> <b>cards.</b> Most early computers used <b>punched</b> <b>cards</b> as their main input device. Along with a <b>card</b> <b>punch,</b> <b>punched</b> <b>card</b> readers were an earlier method of entering data and running programs before {{the current generation of}} input devices existed. A <b>card</b> <b>punch</b> is an output device that <b>punches</b> holes in <b>cards</b> under computer control. Sometimes card readers were combined with <b>card</b> <b>punches</b> and, later, other devices to form multifunction machines.|$|R

25|$|In 1960 {{the company}} {{exported}} 904,000 tonnes worth NOK60.8million and generated {{a profit of}} NOK24.7million. By 1962 Malmfart had three vessels, of which two were ore-bulk-oil carrier, which allowed them to transport petroleum on the return voyage to Norway. Up to 1963 the mining had taken place at the Østmalmen field, but from then production shifted to Vestmalmen. The first IT system, a <b>punch</b> <b>card</b> machine delivered by IBM, was introduced in 1963. A new icebreaker, Varangis II, was delivered the following year, replacing the old icebreaker. The separate company for operating the icebreakers as liquidated in 1964. The docks were expanded several times, allowing 17,000-tonne ships from 1959, 27,000-tonne ships from 1963 and 37,000-tonne ships from 1966.|$|E
25|$|Watson's {{merger of}} {{diplomacy}} and business {{was not always}} lauded. During the 1930s, IBM's German subsidiary was its most profitable foreign operation, and a 2001 book by Edwin Black, IBM and the Holocaust, argues that Watson's pursuit of profit led him to personally approve and spearhead IBM's strategic technological relationship with Nazi Germany. In particular, critics point to the coveted Order of the German Eagle medal that Watson received at the Berlin ICC meeting in 1937, as evidence {{that he was being}} honored for the help that IBM's German subsidiary Dehomag (Deutsche Hollerith-Maschinen Gesellschaft mbH) and its <b>punch</b> <b>card</b> machines provided the Nazi regime, particularly in the tabulation of census data (i.e. location of Jews). Another study argues that Watson believed, perhaps naively, that the medal was in recognition of his years of labor on behalf of global commerce and international peace. Within a year of the Berlin congress though, where Watson's hopes had run high, he found himself strongly protesting the German policy toward the Jews. Because of his strong feelings about the issue, Watson wanted to return his German citation shortly after receiving it. When Secretary of State Hull advised him against that course of action, he gave up the idea until the spring of 1940. Then Hull refused advice, and Watson sent the medal back in June 1940. Dehomag's management disapproved of Watson's action and considered separating from IBM. This occurred when Germany declared war on the United States in December 1941, and the German shareholders took custody of the Dehomag operation. But during World War II, IBM subsidiaries in occupied Europe never stopped delivery of punch cards to Dehomag, and documents uncovered show that senior executives at IBM world headquarters in New York took great pains to maintain legal authority over Dehomag's operations and assets through the personal intervention of IBM managers in neutral Switzerland, directed via personal communications and private letters.|$|E

500|$|Doggett has {{had five}} {{abortion}}s. After having her fifth abortion, {{which takes place}} at an abortion clinic in Fishersville, Virginia, the nurse remarks [...] "we should give you a <b>punch</b> <b>card,</b> get the sixth one free." [...] Doggett is so offended by this joke that she shoots the nurse with a shotgun. She agrees to have a Christian lawyer as it was {{likely to lead to}} a lighter sentence and her legal bills being paid for. Since she shot an abortion nurse, she became a 'hero' of the pro-life movement. Doggett regularly receives cards praising her for her claims of defending the unborn as well as generous cash donations to her commissary account by fans & supporters. Although her Christian faith was initially fake, at some point Doggett did become a Christian; this was confirmed by Manning in an interview. Manning describes Doggett's faith as [...] "a hybrid of Christianity, Baptism, Presbyterian".|$|E

2500|$|Because the 2000 presidential {{election}} {{was so close}} in Florida, the United States government and state governments pushed for election reform to be prepared by the 2004 {{presidential election}}. Many of Florida's year 2000 election night problems stemmed from usability and ballot design factors with voting systems, including the potentially confusing [...] "butterfly ballot". Many voters had difficulties with the paper-based <b>punch</b> <b>card</b> voting machines and were either unable to understand the required process for voting or unable to perform the process. This resulted in an unusual amount of overvote (voting for more candidates than is allowed) and undervotes (voting for fewer than the minimum candidates, including none at all). Many undervotes were caused by voter error, unmaintained <b>punch</b> <b>card</b> voting booths, or errors having to do merely with the characteristics of <b>punch</b> <b>card</b> ballots (resulting in hanging, dimpled, or pregnant chads).|$|E

In 1948 <b>punch</b> <b>card</b> equipment was used. The first trial of a computer system for income tax processing was in 1955, when an IBM 650 installed at Kansas City processed 1.1 million returns. The IRS was authorized to proceed with computerization in 1959, [...] and purchased IBM 1401 and IBM 7070 systems for local and regional data processing centers. The Social Security Number was used for taxpayer identification starting in 1965. By 1967, all returns were processed by computer and punched card data entry was phased out.|$|E
2500|$|In 2012 Haviv Rettig Gur criticized CityPass for {{automatically}} expiring single ride {{tickets at}} the end of the day they were purchased even if they were never used.

[...] Therefore, even if a passenger was traveling within the 90 minutes allowed for free transfers an inspector using CityPass equipment to read the Rav Kav would erroneously believe the fare was not paid and issue a fine. CityPass did not respond to the report nor fix the problem.|$|E
