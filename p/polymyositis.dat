5|$|In these diseases, {{antibodies}} {{are mainly}} directed against {{two of the}} proteins of the complex, called PM/Scl-100 (the RNase D like protein) and PM/Scl-75 (one of the RNase PH like proteins from the ring) and antibodies recognizing these proteins are found in approximately 30% of patients with the PM/Scl overlap syndrome. Although these two proteins are the main target of the autoantibodies, other exosome subunits and associated proteins (like C1D) can be targeted in these patients. At the current time, the most sensitive way to detect these antibodies is by using a peptide, derived from the PM/Scl-100 protein, as the antigen in an ELISA, instead of complete proteins. By this method, autoantibodies are found in up to 55% of patients with the PM/Scl overlap syndrome, {{but they can also}} be detected in patients suffering from either scleroderma, <b>polymyositis,</b> or dermatomyositis alone.|$|E
5|$|The exosome {{complex is}} the target of autoantibodies in {{patients}} suffering from various autoimmune diseases. These autoantibodies are mainly found in people that suffer from the PM/Scl overlap syndrome, an autoimmune disease in which patients have symptoms from both scleroderma and either <b>polymyositis</b> or dermatomyositis. Autoantibodies can be detected in the serum of patients {{by a variety of}} assays. In the past, the most commonly used methods were double immunodiffusion using calf thymus extracts, immunofluorescence on HEp-2 cells or immunoprecipitation from human cell extracts. In immunoprecipitation assays with sera from anti-exosome positive sera, a distinctive set of proteins is precipitated. Already years before the exosome complex was identified, this pattern was termed the PM/Scl complex. Immunofluorescence using sera from these patients usually shows a typical staining of the nucleolus of cells, which sparked the suggestion that the antigen recognized by autoantibodies might be important in ribosome synthesis. More recently, recombinant exosome proteins have become available and these have been used to develop line immunoassays (LIAs) and enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) for detecting these antibodies.|$|E
25|$|Although anti-Jo-1 {{antibodies}} {{are often}} included with ANAs, {{they are actually}} antibodies to the cytoplasmic protein, histidyl tRNA synthetase. They are highly associated with <b>polymyositis</b> and dermatomyositis, and are rarely found in other connective tissue diseases. Around 20–40% of <b>polymyositis</b> is positive for Jo-1 antibodies and most will have interstitial lung disease, HLA-DR3 and HLA-DRw52 human leukocyte antigen (HLA) markers; collectively known as Jo-1 syndrome.|$|E
25|$|Muscle {{weakness}} {{may be due}} {{to problems}} with the nerve supply, neuromuscular disease (such as myasthenia gravis) or problems with muscle itself. The latter category includes <b>polymyositis</b> and other muscle disorders.|$|E
25|$|Systemic {{autoimmune}} diseases include SLE, Sjögren's syndrome, sarcoidosis, scleroderma, rheumatoid arthritis, cryoglobulinemic vasculitis, and dermatomyositis. These conditions tend to {{be associated}} with autoantibodies to antigens which are not tissue specific. Thus although <b>polymyositis</b> is more or less tissue specific in presentation, it may be included in this group because the autoantigens are often ubiquitous t-RNA synthetases.|$|E
25|$|Inflammatory {{disorders}} {{may include}} musculoskeletal complaints, especially arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, <b>polymyositis,</b> dermatomyositis, osteoarthritis, dental pain, temporomandibular joint (TMJ) pain, spondylarthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, gout attacks, and pain management {{in cases of}} kidney stones and gallstones. An additional indication is the treatment of acute migraines. Diclofenac is used commonly to treat mild to moderate postoperative or post-traumatic pain, in particular when inflammation is also present, and is effective against menstrual pain and endometriosis.|$|E
25|$|ANAs {{are found}} in many {{disorders}}, {{as well as some}} healthy individuals. These disorders include: systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis, Sjögren's syndrome, scleroderma, <b>polymyositis,</b> dermatomyositis, primary biliary cirrhosis, drug induced lupus, autoimmune hepatitis, multiple sclerosis, discoid lupus, thyroid disease, antiphospholipid syndrome, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, juvenile dermatomyositis, idiopathic thrombocytopaenic purpura, infection and cancer. These antibodies can be subdivided according to their specificity, and each subset has different propensities for specific disorders.|$|E
25|$|Scleroderma, <b>polymyositis,</b> and {{dermatomyositis}} elicit {{little or}} no CRP response. CRP levels also tend not to be elevated in SLE unless serositis or synovitis is present. Elevations of CRP {{in the absence of}} clinically significant inflammation can occur in renal failure. CRP level is an independent risk factor for atherosclerotic disease. Patients with high CRP concentrations are more likely to develop stroke, myocardial infarction, and severe peripheral vascular disease. Elevated level of CRP can also be observed in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.|$|E
25|$|One-third of {{patients}} have their tumors discovered {{because they have}} an associated autoimmune disorder. As mentioned earlier, {{the most common of}} those conditions is myasthenia gravis (MG); 10–15% {{of patients}} with MG have a thymoma and, conversely, 30–45% of patients with thymomas have MG. Additional associated autoimmune conditions include thymoma-associated multiorgan autoimmunity, pure red cell aplasia and Good syndrome (thymoma with combined immunodeficiency and hypogammaglobulinemia). Other reported disease associations are with acute pericarditis, agranulocytosis, alopecia areata, ulcerative colitis, Cushing's disease, hemolytic anemia, limbic encephalopathy, myocarditis, nephrotic syndrome, panhypopituitarism, pernicious anemia, <b>polymyositis,</b> rheumatoid arthritis, sarcoidosis, scleroderma, sensorimotor radiculopathy, stiff person syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus and thyroiditis.|$|E
25|$|Anti-Ro and anti-La antibodies, {{also known}} as SS-A and SS-B, respectively, are {{commonly}} found in primary Sjögren's syndrome, an autoimmune disorder that affects the exocrine glands. The presence of both antibodies is found in 30–60% of Sjögren's syndrome, anti-Ro antibodies alone are found in 50–70% of Sjögren's syndrome and 30% of SLE with cutaneous involvement, and anti-La antibodies are rarely found in isolation. Anti-La antibodies are also found in SLE; however, Sjögren's syndrome is normally also present. Anti-Ro antibodies are also found less frequently in other disorders including autoimmune liver diseases, coeliac disease, autoimmune rheumatic diseases, cardiac neonatal lupus erythematosus and <b>polymyositis.</b> During pregnancy, anti-Ro antibodies can cross the placenta and cause neonatal lupus in babies. In Sjögren's syndrome, anti-Ro and anti-La antibodies correlate with early onset, increased disease duration, parotid gland enlargement, disease outside the glands and infiltration of glands by lymphocytes. Anti-Ro antibodies are specific to components of the Ro-RNP complex, comprising 45kDa, 52kDa, 54kDa and 60kDa proteins and RNA. The 60kDa DNA/RNA binding protein and 52kDa T-cell regulatory protein are the best characterised antigens of anti-Ro antibodies. Collectively, these proteins {{are part of a}} ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex that associate with the hyRNAs, hY1-hY5. The La antigen is a 48kDa transcription termination factor of RNA polymerase III, which associates with the Ro-RNP complex.|$|E
2500|$|Autoimmunity is {{the system}} of immune {{responses}} of an organism against its own healthy cells and tissues. Any disease that results from such an aberrant immune response is termed an [...] "autoimmune disease". Prominent examples include celiac disease, diabetes mellitus type 1, sarcoidosis, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), Sjögren's syndrome, [...] eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, Graves' disease, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, Addison's disease, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), ankylosing spondylitis, <b>polymyositis</b> (PM), dermatomyositis (DM) and multiple sclerosis (MS). Autoimmune diseases are very often treated with steroids.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are many}} subtypes of ANAs such as anti-Ro {{antibodies}}, anti-La antibodies, anti-Sm antibodies, anti-nRNP antibodies, anti-Scl-70 antibodies, anti-dsDNA antibodies, anti-histone antibodies, antibodies to nuclear pore complexes, [...] anti-centromere antibodies and anti-sp100 antibodies. Each of these antibody subtypes binds to different proteins or protein complexes within the nucleus. They {{are found in}} many disorders including autoimmunity, cancer and infection, with different prevalences of antibodies depending on the condition. This allows the use of ANAs in the diagnosis of some autoimmune disorders, including systemic lupus erythematosus, Sjögren's syndrome, scleroderma, mixed connective tissue disease, <b>polymyositis,</b> dermatomyositis, autoimmune hepatitis and drug induced lupus.|$|E
50|$|Dermatomyositis {{shares a}} number of similar {{physical}} symptoms and histopathological traits as <b>polymyositis,</b> but exhibits a skin rash not seen in <b>polymyositis</b> or sIBM. It may have different root causes unrelated to either <b>polymyositis</b> or sIBM.|$|E
50|$|It {{appears that}} sIBM and <b>polymyositis</b> share some features, {{especially}} the initial sequence of immune system activation, however, polmyositis comes on over weeks or months, does not display the subsequent muscle degeneration and protein abnormalities {{as seen in}} IBM, and as well, <b>polymyositis</b> tends to respond well to treatments, IBM does not. IBM is often confused with (misdiagnosed as) <b>polymyositis.</b> <b>Polymyositis</b> that does not respond to treatment is likely IBM.|$|E
50|$|Sporadic {{inclusion}} body myositis (sIBM): IBM is often confused with (misdiagnosed as) <b>polymyositis</b> or dermatomyositis {{that does not}} respond to treatment is likely IBM. sIBM comes on over months to years; <b>polymyositis</b> comes on over weeks to months. <b>Polymyositis</b> tends to respond well to treatment, at least initially; IBM does not.|$|E
50|$|<b>Polymyositis</b> is an {{inflammatory}} myopathy mediated by cytotoxic T cells with an as yet unknown autoantigen, while dermatomyositis is a humorally mediated angiopathy resulting in myositis and a typical dermatitis.The cause of <b>polymyositis</b> is unknown and may involve viruses and autoimmune factors. Cancer may trigger <b>polymyositis</b> and dermatomyositis, possibly through an immune reaction against cancer that also attacks {{a component of}} muscles.|$|E
50|$|Anti-signal {{recognition}} particle antibodies {{are mainly}} associated with, {{but are not}} very specific for, <b>polymyositis.</b> For individuals with <b>polymyositis,</b> the presence of anti-SRP antibodies are associated with more prominent muscle weakness and atrophy.|$|E
50|$|The {{hallmark}} clinical {{feature of}} <b>polymyositis</b> is proximal muscle weakness, with less important findings being muscle pain and dysphagia. Cardiac and pulmonary findings will {{be present in}} approximately 25% of cases of patients with <b>polymyositis.</b>|$|E

The skin involvement of dermatomyositis is absent in <b>polymyositis.</b> Dysphagia (difficulty swallowing) or other problems with esophageal motility occur in as many as 1/3 of patients. Low grade fever and peripheral adenopathy may be present. Foot drop in one or both feet can be a symptom of advanced <b>polymyositis</b> and inclusion body myositis.
