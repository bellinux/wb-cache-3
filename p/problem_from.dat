5|$|In Ancient Rome {{people did}} not eat or drink with the same pottery as that used by someone who was {{affected}}. People of the time would spit on their chest believing that this would keep the <b>problem</b> <b>from</b> affected them. According to Apuleius and other ancient physicians, in order detect epilepsy it was common to light a piece of gagates, whose smoke would trigger the seizure. Occasionally a spinning potter's wheel was used, perhaps a reference to photosensitive epilepsy.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the results}} of this {{experiment}} were accurate, Fricke misinterpreted the data to mean that the cell membrane is a single molecular layer. Prof. Dr. Evert Gorter (1881–1954) and F. Grendel of Leiden University approached the <b>problem</b> <b>from</b> a different perspective, spreading the erythrocyte lipids as a monolayer on a Langmuir-Blodgett trough. When they compared the area of the monolayer to the surface area of the cells, they found a ratio of two to one. Later analyses showed several errors and incorrect assumptions with this experiment but, serendipitously, these errors canceled out and from this flawed data Gorter and Grendel drew the correct conclusion- that the cell membrane is a lipid bilayer.|$|E

In this method, an image is represented fractally, capturing its inherent self-similarity.

5|$|Among the Pagans {{who use the}} Coldrum Stones {{for their}} ritual activities, there is general {{satisfaction}} with the Trust's management of the site, although some frustration at the poor access for disabled visitors. A patch of scorched earth exists on the grass in {{the centre of the}} monument, perhaps used by Pagans as well as non-Pagans, and the Trust warden responsible for the site has decided to leave it there rather than seeding it over, in order to encourage any who do light fires {{to do so in the}} same spot rather than nearer to the stones themselves. The site also faces a <b>problem</b> <b>from</b> litter left by visitors, although Pagans who regularly visit the site clean this up.|$|E
5|$|Changes in {{government}} approaches towards education {{meant that it}} was no longer regarded adequate for a child to leave education aged 14, as that is the age when they were seen to really understand and appreciate the value of education, as well as being the period when adolescence was at its height. It was beginning to be seen as the worst age for a sudden switch from education to employment, with around 80% of children in 1938 leaving education at this age, many having only had primary-school level education. Although there were concerns about the effects of having less labour from these children, it was hoped that the outcome of a larger quantity of more qualified, skilled workers would eliminate the deficit <b>problem</b> <b>from</b> the loss of unskilled labour.|$|E
5|$|Funding was a <b>problem</b> <b>from</b> the outset. No {{producer}} {{was willing}} to finance the film, as it lacked stars, songs and action scenes. On learning of Ray's plan, one producer, Mr Bhattacharya of Kalpana Movies, contacted Bandopadhyay's widow to request the filming rights and get the film made by Debaki Bose, a well-established director. The widow declined as she had already permitted Ray to make the film. The estimated budget for the production was 70,000 (about US$14,613 in 1955). One producer, Rana Dutta, gave money to continue shooting, but had to stop after some of his films flopped.|$|E

5|$|In 1612, having {{determined}} the orbital periods of Jupiter's satellites, Galileo proposed that with sufficiently accurate {{knowledge of their}} orbits, one could use their positions as a universal clock, and this would make possible the determination of longitude. He worked on this <b>problem</b> <b>from</b> time to time during {{the remainder of his}} life, but the practical problems were severe. The method was first successfully applied by Giovanni Domenico Cassini in 1681 and was later used extensively for large land surveys; this method, for example, was used to survey France, and later by Zebulon Pike of the midwestern United States in 1806. For sea navigation, where delicate telescopic observations were more difficult, the longitude problem eventually required development of a practical portable marine chronometer, such as that of John Harrison. Late in his life, when totally blind, Galileo designed an escapement mechanism for a pendulum clock (called Galileo's escapement), although no clock using this was built until after the first fully operational pendulum clock was made by Christiaan Huygens in the 1650s.|$|E
5|$|Legislation {{began to}} address the <b>problem</b> <b>from</b> 1649 onwards, but it was slow to make a difference. Helen Small writes that, under George III (reigned 1760–1820), new {{legislation}} prevented debts of under 40shillings leading to jail (£ in 2014), but even the smallest debt would exceed that once lawyers' fees were added. Under the Insolvent Debtors Act 1813, debtors could request release after 14days by taking an oath that their assets did not exceed £20, but if a creditor objected they had to stay inside. Even after years in prison, the debt remained to be paid.|$|E
5|$|Mercedes {{topped the}} time sheets {{in the second}} session, now {{switching}} to the soft compound tyres as well, with Nico Rosberg two and a half-tenths of a second clear of Kimi Räikkönen, while Lewis Hamilton was third fastest, more than seven tenths off Rosberg's time. Räikkönen's running was interrupted for a while when he was called back into the pitlane to investigate a fuel system problem, but {{was able to get}} back out. Fernando Alonso was seventh fastest for McLaren, but needed a replacement of his car's plank after running wide over artificial grass surrounding the track. His teammate, Jenson Button, also experienced problems, having to stop {{at the end of the}} pitlane early in the session with an electrical issue. Renault's <b>problem</b> <b>from</b> the first session continued: Jolyon Palmer, back in his car in place of Ocon, suffered a tyre failure on the start-finish straight, bringing out red flags in the process. Renault and tyre supplier Pirelli were left puzzled over the failure, as in this incident, no sign of a cut from debris was found.|$|E

5|$|The project {{suffered}} a setback on 12 March 1969, when the rotor on prototype #3 (s/n 66-8828) struck the fuselage and caused the aircraft to crash, killing the pilot, David A. Beil. The accident occurred {{on a test}} flight where the pilot was to manipulate the controls to excite 0.5P oscillations (or half-P hop) in the rotor; 0.5P is a vibration that happens once per two main rotor revolutions, where P is the rotor's rotational speed. The accident investigation noted that safety mechanisms on the controls had apparently been disabled for the flight. The investigation concluded that the pilot-induced oscillations {{had set up a}} resonant vibration that exceeded the rotor system's ability to compensate. After the investigation, the rotor and control systems were modified to prevent the same <b>problem</b> <b>from</b> occurring again.|$|E

25|$|A {{reduction}} can {{be demonstrated}} to this <b>problem</b> <b>from</b> the well-known undecidable problem of determining whether a Turing machine accepts a particular input (the halting problem).

A CFG can be constructed that generates all strings that are not accepting computation histories for a particular Turing machine on a particular input, and thus it will accept all strings only if the machine doesn't accept that input.|$|E

25|$|A year later, he {{came across}} another <b>problem</b> <b>from</b> {{hardware}} engineers working on the institute's next computer: minimize the amount of wire needed to connect the pins on the back panel of the machine. As a solution, he re-discovered the algorithm known as Prim's minimal spanning tree algorithm. The Prim's algorithm was originally developed in 1930 by Czech mathematician Vojtěch Jarník and later independently rediscovered and republished by Robert C. Prim in 1957 and Dijkstra in 1959. Therefore, it is also sometimes called the DJP algorithm.|$|E
