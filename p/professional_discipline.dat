25|$|Dijkstra's {{ideas about}} {{programming}} methodology (especially the structured programming movement) helped lay {{the foundations for}} the birth {{and development of the}} <b>professional</b> <b>discipline</b> of software engineering (in particular the software design and development), enabling programmers to organize and manage increasingly complex software projects. In the late 1960s Dijkstra discussed the concept of program families. And in the mid 1970s David Parnas and others clarified the idea and showed how to apply it in software engineering principles.|$|E

25|$|Both as an {{adolescent}} {{and as a}} young man, Spencer {{found it difficult to}} settle to any intellectual or <b>professional</b> <b>discipline.</b> He worked as a civil engineer during the railway boom of the late 1830s, while also devoting much of his time to writing for provincial journals that were nonconformist in their religion and radical in their politics. From 1848 to 1853 he served as sub-editor on the free-trade journal The Economist, during which time he published his first book, Social Statics (1851), which predicted that humanity would eventually become completely adapted to the requirements of living in society with the consequential withering away of the state.|$|E
2500|$|It {{is common}} to confuse BPM with a BPM suite (BPMS). [...] BPM is a <b>professional</b> <b>discipline</b> done by people, whereas [...] a BPMS is a {{technological}} suite of tools designed to help the BPM professionals accomplish their goals. [...] BPM should also {{not be confused with}} an application or solution developed to support a particular process. [...] Suites and solutions represent ways of automating business processes, but automation is only one aspect of BPM.|$|E

Dijkstra coined the phrase [...] "structured programming" [...] and during the 1970s this became the new programming orthodoxy. Dijkstra's ideas about structured programming helped lay the foundations for the birth and development of the <b>professional</b> <b>discipline</b> of software engineering, enabling programmers to organize and manage increasingly complex software projects.|$|E

2500|$|The Swiss scholar Ferdinand de Saussure founded {{linguistics}} as a twentieth-century <b>professional</b> <b>discipline.</b> Saussure regarded {{a language}} as a rule-governed system, much like a board game such as chess. In order to understand chess, he insisted, we must ignore such external factors as the weather prevailing during a particular session or the material composition {{of this or that}} piece. The game is autonomous with respect to its material embodiments. In the same way, when studying language, it's essential to focus on its internal structure as a social institution. External matters (e.g., the shape of the human tongue) are irrelevant from this standpoint. Saussure regarded 'speaking' (parole) as individual, ancillary and more or less accidental by comparison with [...] "language" [...] (langue), which he viewed as collective, systematic and essential.|$|E
