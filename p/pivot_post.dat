5000|$|John Danner (March 10, 1823 - April 12, 1918) invented and {{patented}} (May 16, 1876) [...] the <b>pivot</b> and <b>post</b> revolving bookcase. His bookcase hangs {{suspended from}} a simple cast iron bearing which sits {{on top of an}} inner column or post. The revolving mechanism consists of two nesting cast iron cones that provide a precise pivot point supporting the entire weight of the bookcase. The top support suspension design addressed the binding and racking problems of previous bottom bearing Lazy Susan type bookcases. [...] "These cases, with their immense load, revolve with a slight touch of the hand; are noiseless in operation, and will last a lifetime." [...] Originally designed to hold 32 volumes of the Encyclopedia, it is a compact, rotating bookcase. [...] "It is a square of 22 inches taking up no more room on the floor than an ordinary chair." ...|$|R
50|$|Distributed by the Elkhart, Indiana-based Gemstone Musical Instruments, Stephanhouser creates alto, tenor, soprano, and {{baritone}} saxophones for musicians at all levels, {{from student}} to professional. Stephanhöuser received three United States patents {{in less than}} five years of operation. The Stephanhouser innovations include the ScrewLess pin design, which eliminates <b>pivot</b> screws in <b>post</b> rods and enhances instrument durability, a procedure for creating a saxophone bow out of a single piece of brass for a more resonant sound, and a more precise octave key design. The Stephanhouser brand was created and developed by Dane Scott Stephens of Castroville, Texas in 2001.|$|R
5000|$|HAMBLE hydrobiplane HL.l (Hamble River, Luke & Co., Hamble, Hampshire)Constructed by an {{established}} boat building company, {{to the design}} of Frank Murphy, late of Bristol, the machine was shown incomplete at Olympia in March 1914. Changes were made later and the machine was tested by Gordon England, but costs were excessive, and the machine and the premises were put up for sale by July 1914.The aircraft was a large two-seater pusher seaplane with twin wooden main floats and twin metal tail floats, moving with the rudders. There were four pairs of interplane struts each side, with radiators mounted on the innermost pairs. Ailerons were fitted to both top and bottom wings, the latter having pronounced dihedral.The spruce tail booms, to be replaced by steel tubes later, extended aft from the second interplane struts. The tailplane and elevator were carried on the top booms, the pair of rudders <b>pivoting</b> on <b>posts</b> below. The pointed nose nacelle, was covered with two layers of cedar, laid up diagonally over the structure, and was mounted on short struts between the wings. The main floats were of similar construction, but rendered watertight, and were mounted on a steel tube chassis, intended to be sprung later.Power: 150hp NAG (British-made) six-cylinder inline, water-cooled driving a Normale pusher propeller direct.Data:Span top 60ftSpan bottom 53ftChord 6ftGap 6ftLength 30ftArea 678 sq ftArea tailplane 39 sq ftArea elevator 33 sq ftArea rudders 32 sq ftWeight 1,3001bWeight allup 2,550 lbSpeed range 32-65mphEndurance 5hr ...|$|R
40|$|Strain-relaxation {{effects in}} AlN-buffered GaN/InGaN microdisks <b>pivoted</b> on Si <b>posts</b> of varying radii {{have been studied}} by micro-Raman {{spectroscopy}} and scanning near-field optical spectroscopy (SNOS). With increasing undercut beneath the microdisks by chemical wet-etching, the mitigation of biaxial tensile stress {{is found to be}} dependent on the contact areas between the Si posts and GaN microdisks. Strain-relaxation reduces the quantum-confined Stark effect (QCSE) in the quantum wells (QWs), leading to an 18. 3 % enhancement in InGaN QW internal quantum efficiency (IQE). Light out-coupling is also improved in the suspended regions owing to reduced optical absorption at AlN/Si interface compared to the central region. Meanwhile, spectral blue-shifts of ~ 45. 6 meV are observed from the near-field photoluminescence (nf-PL) spectrum towards the edge of the microdisk. Such localization of strain relaxation can be exploited for precise strain engineering of the microdisks. The emission wavelengths of the microdisks can be stabilized by balancing strain-relaxation effects with thermal effects...|$|R
5000|$|At 6'8" [...] and 250 lbs, Diaw is {{a natural}} forward. However, his passing skills and ability to score inside have earned him a {{reputation}} of being capable of playing all positions on the floor well. This is best seen in the 2005-06 season, during which Diaw started as a bench player, then convincingly subbed as a point guard when starting playmaker Steve Nash (that season's MVP) was injured, then started as a small forward and was finally moved to center when all three Suns <b>pivots</b> got injured, <b>posting</b> impressive stats of 18.7 points, 6.7 rebounds and 5.2 assists in the playoffs despite playing out of position. His breakout season (13.3 points, 6.9 rebounds and 6.2 assists per game) was crowned with the Most Improved Player Award. He is lauded for his unselfish, but assertive play, and his versatility also makes him a triple-double threat: as of March 2016, he has recorded six of them.|$|R
50|$|The {{only other}} place at which {{vehicles}} can cross the navigable channel is at Martham Ferry, where a nineteenth-century bridge was replaced {{in the early}} 1920s by a floating swing bridge. The deck rests on two semi-circular steel buoyancy tanks, and there are concrete abutments {{on both sides of}} the river. The bridge <b>pivots</b> on a <b>post</b> at the south side of the river, and is connected by a chain to a winch on the north bank. The structure is grade II listed, and provides access for farm vehicles from Ferrygate Lane to Heigham Holmes, a national nature reserve managed by the National Trust, which is surrounded by water on all sides, and is normally only open to visitors on one day each year. The deck is lowered onto the concrete abutments when in position by pumping water into the buoyancy tanks, and pumping it out again before the bridge can be opened for navigation. The National Trust are looking to replace the bridge, due to the slow and cumbersome nature of its operation. An engineering survey suggested that a conventional swing bridge or bascule bridge could not easily be installed at the site, and so a replacement of a similar design, but incorporating powered operation is the preferred option.|$|R
