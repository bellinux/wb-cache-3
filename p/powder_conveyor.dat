40|$|Abstract. The {{bearing support}} {{breakage}} of screw coal <b>powder</b> <b>conveyor</b> in power plant boiler went through four stages: axial displacement of shaft sleeve, shaft sleeve wearing by shield ring and by bearing, and {{the wearing of}} skeleton seal rings and dustproof felts by shaft sleeve. By analyzing the wearing characters of each part, the renovation structure was designed. The bearing settled style was changed from using shield ring to using locknut by designing convex sidestep on the shaft sleeve, preventing the axial from drifting. Substituting for the welding assembly, the bolt connecting between the covers and the bearing support body was selected to replace the worn sealing materials easily in dismantling and installing. Good operating effects were achieved after the renovation of the coal <b>powder</b> <b>conveyor</b> bearing support, in the screw coal powder manufacturing line of 100 MW power plant boiler, there was no line vibrating, coal leaking, noising and line locking, having decreased the repairing cost greatly and insuring the safety and stable electric power producing...|$|E

40|$|Fine powders (10 μm 50 < 100 μm) behave analogously to liquids when aerated by air. Hence, methods (e. g. Couette method) used to {{determine}} the flow performance of liquids can be adopted to investigate the similar flow properties (e. g. apparent shear resistance) of aerated powders. By this means, the understanding and handling techniques for aerated fine powders can be significantly enhanced. This research aims to investigate the apparent shear resistance of aerated fine powders through a specialised viscometer. Such a viscometer is combined with a fluidisation system and a common rotary viscometer. Three types of fine powders (alumina, cement and flyash) were selected as testing materials. Experimental results indicated that aerated fine powders behave similarly to Herschel–Bulkley non-Newtonian fluids. Subsequently, the apparent shear resistance for three fine powders were modelled by modifying the original Herschel–Bulkley rheology model. Consequently, the apparent shear resistance of a specific aerated powder can be measured and modelled using the bench scale system developed in this study, thus can be utilised to predict the flow performance of fine <b>powders</b> in pneumatic <b>conveyors...</b>|$|R
40|$|Air-gravity conveyors, {{commonly}} referred to as air-slides, are widely used in industry to convey bulk materials with the advantages of low particle velocities, low levels of particle attrition, potentially very high conveying rates and low power consumption. Most current designs are based on empirical design charts and past experience as there have been relatively few investigations attempting to model the flow of aerated <b>powders</b> on air-gravity <b>conveyor</b> systems. In this paper, ANSYS FLUENT has been used to simulate the air-gravity flow, where a steady, three-dimensional fluidized granular flow is considered in a rectangular channel having frictional side walls for different flow conditions. The results of simulated bed heights along the air-gravity channel are discussed. Moreover, this paper reports on work which attempts to develop a fundamental conveying model for air-gravity conveyor flows in inclined channels with an emphasis on the conservation of momentum taking into account the rheology of the gas-solid mixture. The conveying model shows the relationship between mass flow rate and bed height. The developed model well predicts the steady flow bed heights for each mass flow rate. A sensitivity analysis has been carried out which demonstrates that the conveying model can be applied to powders in a fluidized state to predict the bed heights of the flow under inclination angles between 1 ° to 10 °...|$|R
40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) One of {{the most}} {{important}} technical issues of recent pneumatic conveying technology development is the new approach for better modelling of fine powder flow performance. This presents a significant challenge in ensuring the model adequately reflects the physical nature of the flow, and the predicted results are comparatively more accurate than the conventional empirical based methods. Instead of empirically based methods, this research adopted a fluid rheology based technique to assess the flow performance of fine <b>powders</b> within pneumatic <b>conveyors.</b> The approach stemmed from the liquid-analogy characteristics of fluidised powder materials where the critical property to determine the flow performance of a liquid is its rheological response. This liquid analogy principle can be applied to fine powder pneumatic flows. Therefore, the objective of this research was focused on following specific aspects: theoretical modelling of fine powder pneumatic flow from a rheology perspective, experimental determination of the rheological properties for aerated powders, validations of the proposed conveying models, and transient characteristics of fine powder pneumatic flows. Initially, conveying models based on the rheology of aerated powders were derived for straight pipelines. This was achieved by analysing a continuous flow system using classic fluid mechanics. By inputting the rheological and conveying parameters, models capable of predicting the pressure drops were proposed. Experimental investigations on the rheology of aerated powder materials (alumina, cement and flyash) were subsequently conducted. These investigations were predominantly focused on the hydrostatic yield stress at low aeration and viscous characteristics at high aeration. Two purposely designed and built experimental apparatuses were utilised to examine the rheology of aerated powders accordingly. Empirical power-law and yield power-law rheological correlations were subsequently formulated based on the quantitative results obtained through testing. Rheology based conveying models were finally evaluated and validated by comparing the pressure drop produced from conveying models with the pressure drop measured from a 7 -metre long pilot scale pneumatic conveyor. Results showed good agreements between the model predictions and experimental observations for alumina with overall error around 11. 7 %. However, for flyash, only the results in low to intermediate dense states (m* < 130) were found to be close the experimental results. Transient flow behaviours of the flyash powder were also investigated using a non-invasive imaging device-Electrical Capacitance Tomography (ECT). A 20 -metre long pilot scale pneumatic conveyor was designed and set up to conduct various tests with the ECT embedded in the pipeline. Flow patterns reconstructed from the ECT results indicated that the dense flyash pneumatic flows were naturally unsteady and pulsatile. Structural and statistical analyses on the pulse structures were subsequently carried out to unveil the pulsing characteristics under different experimental conditions. Additional transient flow parameters such as the solids flow velocity and solids mass flow rate were also estimated using the ECT results. This study not only enhances the current understanding of the fine powder pneumatic flows, but also provides an alternative approach to estimate the flow performance of fine powders in pneumatic conveying systems...|$|R
