25|$|Coagulative {{necrosis}} {{is characterized}} by the formation of a gelatinous (gel-like) substance in dead tissues in which the architecture of the tissue is maintained, and can be observed by light microscopy. Coagulation occurs as a result of <b>protein</b> <b>denaturation,</b> causing albumin to transform into a firm and opaque state. This pattern of necrosis is typically seen in hypoxic (low-oxygen) environments, such as infarction. Coagulative necrosis occurs primarily in tissues such as the kidney, heart and adrenal glands. Severe ischemia most commonly causes necrosis of this form.|$|E
25|$|Finally, infant {{formulas}} are {{heat treated}} {{to maintain the}} bacteriologic quality of the product. This can be done traditionally by either retort sterilization or high-temperature short-time (HTST) treatment. Recently, ultrahigh-temperature treated formula has become more commonly used. If powdered formula is made, then spray drying would be required in addition. Retort sterilization is a traditional retort sterilization method that uses 10-15mins treatment at 118°C. Ultrahigh-temperature (UHT) is a method that uses a brief (2–3 seconds) treatment at 142°C. Because of the short time used, there is little <b>protein</b> <b>denaturation,</b> but the process still ensures sterility of the final product.|$|E

25|$|If {{too much}} damage {{is present in}} mitochondria, a cell {{undergoes}} apoptosis or programmed cell death. Bcl-2 proteins are layered {{on the surface of}} the mitochondria, detect damage, and activate a class of proteins called Bax, which punch holes in the mitochondrial membrane, causing cytochrome C to leak out. This cytochrome C binds to Apaf-1, or apoptotic protease activating factor-1, which is free-floating in the cell's cytoplasm. Using energy from the ATPs in the mitochondrion, the Apaf-1 and cytochrome C bind together to form apoptosomes. The apoptosomes bind to and activate caspase-9, another free-floating protein. The caspase-9 then cleaves the proteins of the mitochondrial membrane, causing it to break down and start a chain reaction of <b>protein</b> <b>denaturation</b> and eventually phagocytosis of the cell.|$|E
25|$|In the {{extrusion}} process, {{raw materials}} are first {{ground to the}} correct particle size. The dry mix is passed through a pre-conditioner, in which other ingredients may be added, and steam is injected to start the cooking process. The preconditioned mix is then passed through an extruder, where it is forced through a die and cut to the desired length. The cooking process takes place within the extruder where the product produces its own friction and heat due to the pressure generated (10–20bar). The main independent parameters during extrusion cooking are feed rate, particle size of the raw material, barrel temperature, screw speed and moisture content. The extruding process can induce both <b>protein</b> <b>denaturation</b> and starch gelatinization, depending on inputs and parameters. Sometimes, a catalyst is used, for example, when producing texturised vegetable proteins (TVP).|$|E
25|$|A {{completely}} new approach of using SIRs for the separation or purification of biotechnological {{products such as}} proteins {{is based on the}} concept of impregnating porous particles with aqueous polymer solutions developed by B. Burghoff. These so-called Tunable Aqueous Polymer-Phase Impregnated Resins (TAPPIR) enhance aqueous two-phase extraction (ATPE) by applying the SIR technology. During classical aqueous two-phase extraction, biotechnological components such as proteins are extracted from aqueous solutions by using a second aqueous phase. This second aqueous phase contains e.g. polyethylene glycol (PEG). On the one hand, a low density difference and low interfacial tension between the two aqueous phases facilitate comparatively fast mass transfer between the phases. On the other hand, PEG appears to stabilize the protein molecules, which results in a comparatively low <b>protein</b> <b>denaturation</b> during the extraction. However, a significant drawback of ATPE is the persistent emulsification, which makes phase separation a challenge. The idea behind TAPPIR is to use the advantages posed by SIRs, namely low extractant loss due to immobilization in the pores and less emulsification than in liquid-liquid extraction. This way, the drawbacks of ATPE could be remedied. The setup would consist of a packed column or a fluidized bed rather than liquid-liquid extraction equipment with additional phase separation steps. Nonetheless, as yet only first feasibility studies are on the way to prove the concept. Adrawback of this method is the non-conitnous working mode. The packed column is run similar as a chromatographic column.|$|E

Adhesion is governed by the EPS consisting of polysaccharides and <b>proteins.</b> <b>Denaturation</b> of EPS (heat, UV) inhibits the adhesion. Chaotrophic and surface active agents reduced the adhesion rate significantly indicating that hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions are major adhesion forces. Changes in pH (3 - 10) and ionic strength interferred only weakly indicating that electrostatic interactions play a minor role in the adhesion process.

500|$|The {{process of}} <b>protein</b> <b>denaturation</b> (as {{distinguished}} from coagulation) {{had been discovered}} in 1910 by Harriette Chick and Charles Martin, but its nature was still mysterious. [...] Tim Anson and Alfred Mirsky had shown that denaturation was a reversible, two-state process [...] that results in many chemical groups becoming available for chemical reactions, including cleavage by enzymes. [...] In 1929, Hsien Wu hypothesized correctly that denaturation corresponded to protein unfolding, a purely conformational change {{that resulted in the}} exposure of amino-acid side chains to the solvent. [...] Wu's hypothesis was also advanced independently in 1936 by Mirsky and Linus Pauling. [...] Nevertheless, protein scientists could not exclude the possibility that denaturation corresponded to a chemical change in the protein structure, a hypothesis that was considered a (distant) possibility until the 1950s.|$|E

40|$|Common {{formulation}} batters {{were prepared}} by pork meat comminution and processed for 30 min by pressure/thermal combinations of 200 and 400 MPa with five temperatures from 10 to 70 °C. Processing performance was monitored by determination of pH, cooking loss, and three textural parameters {{to assess the}} quality of pressurized versus unpressurized samples. <b>Protein</b> thermal <b>denaturation</b> was determined by differential scanning calorimetry to evaluate the unfolding effects of processing. Net effects were pressure-temperature interdependent, pressure denaturation being particularly effective at nondenaturing temperatures. Pressure suppressed subsequent thermal denaturation at unfolding temperatures, preventing batter proteins from denaturing to an extent dependent on the magnitude of both pressure and temperature processing parameters. Pressurized batters needed higher temperatures to overcome pressure effects and regain total <b>protein</b> thermal <b>denaturation.</b> Pressure/thermal treatments impaired meat gelling at normal cooking temperatures, leading to undesirable effects on the pressurized batters.

Many more types of variation in protein sequences can be distinguished on one-dimensional gels in the absence of denaturants.

50|$|Millimeter {{wavelength}} {{radiation is}} {{a subset of}} the microwave radio frequency spectrum. Even at its high-energy end, it is still more than 3 orders of magnitude lower in energy than its nearest radiotoxic neighbour (ultraviolet) in the electromagnetic spectrum. As such, millimeter wave radiation is non-ionizing and incapable of causing cancers by radiolytic DNA bond cleavage. Yet, the WHO (World Health Organization) IARC (International Agency for Research in Cancer) in 2011 classified non-ionizing radiation such as millimeter waves or microwaves, as 2B, which means possibly carcinogenic to humans. Due to the shallow penetration depth of millimeter waves into tissue (typically less than 1 mm), acute biological effects of irradiation are localized in epidermal and dermal layers and manifest primarily as thermal effects. There is no clear evidence to date of harmful effects other than those caused by localised heating and ensuing chemical changes (expression of heat shock <b>proteins,</b> <b>denaturation,</b> proteolysis, and inflammatory response, see also mobile phone radiation and health). It should be noted however that the energy density required to produce thermal injury in skin is much higher than that typically delivered in an active millimeter wave scanner.|$|R
