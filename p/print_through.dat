2500|$|Buck Garden (500-1200 CE) were {{predominant}} throughout central Kanawha-New River Valley region {{following the}} upper Armstrong. They were first identified at the Buck Garden Creek site in Nicholas Co.. Buck Garden people were buried under Rock Mounds and cliffs. They lived in compact villages and began raising beans included within the Eastern Agricultural Complex method. Many illustrations of living activities in <b>print</b> <b>through</b> the decades have been suggested. These ideas {{have ranged from}} the bizarre to the probable. They grew or gathered root and ground vining foods, picked spring greens, berries [...] and ramp followed by gathering shellfish on creek flats, hickory and walnuts. Use of spice and Sassafras is presently speculative. With their fishing pike, they fished the spring run and in the following cooler leafless seasons they hunted game. Like their rock mound burial within the state's interior, their use of rocks is not clear: small fishing jetties and possible use of the curious game-herding stone walls. Dr. Otis K. Rice wrote, [...] "About 1000 A. D. the Buck Garden hill people began to occupy the Mount Carbon site." ...|$|E
60|$|As the major, posted {{near his}} clock, said the last words, his little {{audience}} of three, assembled {{at the opposite}} end of the room, saw the hour-hand and the minute-hand on the dial point together to twelve. The first stroke sounded, and Time, true to the signal, moved his scythe. The day of the month and the day of the week announced themselves in <b>print</b> <b>through</b> the glass pedestal next; Midwinter applauding their appearance with a noisy exaggeration of surprise, which Miss Milroy mistook for coarse sarcasm directed at her father's pursuits, and which Allan (seeing that she was offended) attempted to moderate by touching the elbow of his friend. Meanwhile, the performances of the clock went on. At the last stroke of twelve, Time lifted his scythe again, the chimes rang, the march tune of the major's old regiment followed; and the crowning exhibition of the relief of the guard announced itself in a preliminary trembling of the sentry-boxes, and a sudden disappearance of the major at the back of the clock.|$|E
