40|$|Regular aerobic {{physical}} activity increases exercise capacity and {{plays an important}} role in prevention of cardiovascular disease. Our study aimed at evaluation of level of exercise intensity during <b>playing</b> <b>golf</b> using a self-driving golf cart with monitoring both heart rates and blood pressure. Seven healthy middle-aged and older men （ 49 years old， SD: 6 ， 1 ） performed <b>playing</b> <b>golf</b> with monitoring Holter-ECG and blood pressure using a golf cart and also performed doing their routine job with monitoring Holter-ECG and blood pressure. The mean heart rates （ 107 beats/min， SD: 18 ） on <b>playing</b> <b>golf</b> moderately and significantly elevated in compared with the mean heart rates （ 82 beats/min， SD: 14 ） on doing routine job. The mean systolic blood pressure （ 131 mmHg， SD: 16 ） on <b>playing</b> <b>golf</b> significantly higher than the mean systolic blood pressure（ 123 mmHg， SD: 15 ） on doing routine job. However， there was no difference between the mean diastolic blood pressure （ 82 mmHg， SD: 14 ） on <b>playing</b> <b>golf</b> and the mean diastolic blood pressure （ 86 mmHg， SD: 11 ） on doing routine job. In comparison with doing routine job， systolic blood pressure at starting time of <b>playing</b> <b>golf</b> just before the tee shot was significantly elevated probably due to excitation of sympathetic nerve system. We suggest that <b>playing</b> <b>golf</b> even if using a self-driving golf cart is suitable and recommendable exercise for prevention of disease...|$|R
