5|$|In {{seeking to}} {{discipline}} the nuns, the Vatican did not contact {{any one of}} them personally, and did not respond to direct individual communication. Rather, the superiors of the nuns were asked to write letters verifying whether or not the nuns were in line with Catholic teaching on abortion, and a variety of responses were received from the superiors. A few nuns disavowed their <b>position</b> <b>on</b> <b>abortion</b> and the cases were quickly closed. Most nuns held to their earlier conviction, although their superiors sent letters saying that they accepted Church teaching. Once a nun's superior had {{sent a letter to the}} Vatican, the case was closed, without any further attempt to prevent the nun from speaking out on the issues.|$|E

25|$|The ACNA has {{attempted}} to incorporate {{the full spectrum of}} conservative Anglicanism within Canada and the United States. As a result, it accommodates Anglo-Catholic, charismatic, and evangelical theological orientations. It also includes those who oppose and those who support women's ordination. Women can serve as clergy members in some dioceses, while other dioceses maintain an exclusively male clergy. Women are ineligible to serve as bishops. The ACNA defines Christian marriage exclusively as a lifelong union {{between a man and a}} woman and consequently condemns homosexual relationships, as well as extra-marital relations, that are non-celibate as sinful. The church holds a pro-life <b>position</b> <b>on</b> <b>abortion</b> and euthanasia.|$|E
500|$|Sharp {{criticism}} from Catholic Church authorities put Ferraro {{on the defensive}} during the entire campaign, with abortion opponents frequently protesting her appearances {{with a level of}} fervor not usually encountered by pro-choice Catholic male candidates such as Mario Cuomo and Ted Kennedy. In a 1982 briefing for Congress, Ferraro had written that [...] "the Catholic <b>position</b> <b>on</b> <b>abortion</b> is not monolithic and there can be a range of personal and political responses to the issue." [...] Ferraro was criticized by Cardinal John O'Connor, the Catholic Archbishop of New York, and James Timlin, the Bishop of Scranton, for misrepresenting the Catholic Church's <b>position</b> <b>on</b> <b>abortion.</b> After several days of back-and-forth debate in the public media, Ferraro finally conceded that, [...] "the Catholic Church's <b>position</b> <b>on</b> <b>abortion</b> is monolithic" [...] but {{went on to say that}} [...] "But I do believe that there are a lot of Catholics who do not share the view of the Catholic Church". Ferraro was also criticized for saying that Reagan was not a [...] "good Christian" [...] because, she said, his policies hurt the poor. To defend Ferraro, the pro-choice group Catholics for a Free Choice placed an October 7, 1984, full-page ad in The New York Times titled [...] "A Catholic Statement on Pluralism and Abortion".|$|E
500|$|When Ferraro {{was named}} Walter Mondale's running mate for the Democratic Party in the 1984 election, Archbishop O'Connor and Archbishop of Boston Bernard Francis Law issued {{statements}} denouncing her <b>position</b> <b>on</b> <b>abortion.</b> It {{is likely that}} O'Connor targeted Ferraro because of her association with CFFC. O'Connor said that Catholic voters should not vote for pro-choice politicians. O'Connor said Ferraro [...] "has given the world to understand that Catholic teaching is divided {{on the subject of}} abortion", which he said was wrong. Ferraro said that her personal pro-choice views were not something she would force on the nation; she said she would follow {{the law of the land}} as interpreted by the Supreme Court. After receiving more criticism from O'Connor, Ferraro acknowledged that the Church's <b>position</b> <b>on</b> <b>abortion</b> was indeed [...] "monolithic", but said many Catholics [...] "do not share the view of the Catholic Church." ...|$|E

5000|$|Pro-life Libertarian {{former congressman}} Ron Paul says in [...] "Abortion and Liberty": It's no {{coincidence}} that today's argument over abortion {{comes at a time}} when freedom in general is threatened in the United States, as well as in other Western countries. Nor was it accidental that genocide, abortion, and euthanasia were all practiced under Hitler, and that all three characterize totalitarian states. Even today, Communist governments vary their <b>positions</b> <b>on</b> <b>abortion</b> strictly <b>on</b> economic calculations of whether more or fewer slaves are needed.|$|R
500|$|As president, Ford's <b>position</b> <b>on</b> <b>abortion</b> {{was that}} he {{supported}} [...] "a federal constitutional amendment that would permit {{each one of the}} 50 States to make the choice".

Geraldine Ferraro, then a member of the United States House of Representatives, wrote the introduction to the briefing. She wrote, [...] "As Catholics we deal each day, both personally and politically, with the wrenching abortion issue...the Catholic <b>position</b> <b>on</b> <b>abortion</b> is not monolithic and there can be a range of personal and political responses to the issue." [...] Other endorsers of the briefing included fellow Democratic politicians Leon Panetta and Tom Daschle.|$|E
500|$|There was one vice-presidential {{debate between}} Congresswoman Ferraro and Vice President George H. W. Bush. Held on , {{the result was}} proclaimed mostly even by the press and historians; women voters tended to think Ferraro had won, while men, Bush. At it, Ferraro criticized Reagan's initial refusal to support an {{extension}} to the Voting Rights Act. Her experience was questioned at the debate and she was asked how her three terms in Congress stacked up with Bush's extensive government experience. To one Bush statement she said, [...] "Let me just say first of all, that I almost resent, Vice President Bush, your patronizing attitude {{that you have to}} teach me about foreign policy." [...] She strongly defended her <b>position</b> <b>on</b> <b>abortion,</b> which earned her applause and a respectful reply from her opponent. In {{the days leading up to}} the debate, Second Lady of the United States Barbara Bush had publicly referred to Ferraro as [...] "that four-million-dollar—I can't say it, but it rhymes with 'rich'." [...] Barbara Bush soon apologized.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{represents}} {{a case study}} of the types of fallacies that may occur in the argumentation stage of an ethical dispute over abortion. The theoretical framework I use is the pragma-dialectical theory of argumentation (van Eemeren and Grootendorst 1992, 2004) which conceives of fallacies as violations of the rules for critical discussion. I will focus on the fallacies resulting from the violation of the relevance rule in two fragments of argumentative texts illustrating opposing <b>positions</b> <b>on</b> <b>abortion.</b> I claim that these fallacies function as winning strategies in the ethical dispute in case...|$|R
500|$|On March 2, 1986, a {{follow-up}} advertisement was placed by the Committee of Concerned Catholics, signed {{by more than}} 1,000 Catholics supportive {{of the right to}} speak dissenting views on abortion and other controversial subjects. This advertisement was intended to show solidarity for the 97 signers of the 1984 advertisement who were threatened by the Church. It began, [...] "We affirm our solidarity with all Catholics whose right to free speech is under attack." [...] Committee member Kissling said that, though seven nuns had [...] "clarified" [...] their positions, [...] "There have been no retractions; there have been no withdrawals." [...] She said the Church's assertion that many nuns had disavowed their 1984 signing was [...] "a lot of wishful thinking". Nine conservative Catholic lay group leaders responded with a letter to Hamer asking for quick disciplinary action against dissenting nuns. They warned that [...] "the revolt is spreading" [...] against the church's <b>position</b> <b>on</b> <b>abortion,</b> and chided the Vatican for failing to react decisively against signers of the first ad.|$|E
500|$|Two Sisters of Notre Dame de Namur, Patricia Hussey and Barbara Ferraro (no {{relation}} to Geraldine Ferraro), did not recant from their pro-choice positions. [...] Hussey and Ferraro, {{directors of the}} Covenant House in Charleston, West Virginia—a shelter for homeless and abused women and children—were supported by CFFC in their dispute with the Church. [...] By March 1986, Hussey and Ferraro were no longer calling for [...] "dialogue" [...] but were publicly demanding recognition of [...] "a woman's right to choose." [...] In July 1986 when the two nuns were pressured more strongly with expulsion, 11 of the other nuns who signed came forward with a statement in solidarity with them, denying a recent Vatican announcement that all nuns but Hussey and Ferraro were now aligned with the Church's <b>position</b> <b>on</b> <b>abortion.</b> The eleven complained of the Church's divisive tactics, which they said were intended to isolate Hussey and Ferraro. Signer Maureen Fiedler said, [...] "I have never retracted or recanted one syllable of the Catholic Statement on Abortion and Pluralism. I continue to stand behind every word of it without the slightest reservation." [...] After nearly four years of dispute, Hussey and Ferraro were informed by their order's leadership in June 1988 {{that they would not}} be dismissed from the order. However, the leadership of the School Sisters of Notre Dame distanced the order from Hussey and Ferraro, calling them [...] "intransigent" [...] and stating that they [...] "have in practice placed themselves outside the life and mission of the congregation." ...|$|E
500|$|On December 12, 2007, Keyes {{participated in}} the Des Moines Registers Republican presidential debate, {{televised}} nationwide by PBS and the cable news networks.

Although Keyes was not listed on the latest national CNN poll leading up to the debate, he registered with at least 1 percent of the Iowa vote in order to participate. During the debate, after the moderator began to ask a question of Texas Congressman Ron Paul, Keyes insisted he was not getting fair treatment. He interrupted the debate moderator at one point, saying that she had not called on him in several rounds and that he had to make an issue of it. He went on the offensive against his opponents during the debate, criticizing Rudy Giuliani's pro-choice position, as well as Mitt Romney's recent change in position on the same subject. In answering a question about global warming, he continued his criticisms of other candidates, saying, [...] "I'm in favor of reducing global warming, because I think the most important emission we need to control is the hot air emission of politicians who pretend one thing and don't deliver". He also advocated ending the income tax, establishing state-sanctioned prayer in public schools, and abolishing abortion. Toward the end of the debate, Keyes stated he could not support Giuliani if he were to win the nomination due to the former New York mayor's <b>position</b> <b>on</b> <b>abortion.</b>|$|E

Scalzi pledged to donate $5 to RAINN, Emily's List, the Human Rights Campaign, and the NAACP every time Day mentioned him on his website.

500|$|Feed Us A Fetus, the 1986 LP by Canadian thrash band Dayglo Abortions, adapted a {{photograph}} of Mr. and Mrs. Reagan [...] with the U.S. Presidential Seal in the background, adding to it is a fetus being served to the president on a plate. Earlier in his political career, Ronald Reagan had signed the Therapeutic Abortion Act six weeks into his first gubernatorial term, bringing California's statewide total of legal abortion procedures from 518 in 1967 {{to an average of}} around 100,000 annually throughout his two terms as governor—more than any other state prior to Roe vs. Wade. In 1972 Nancy Reagan make a public statement regarding her husband's decision, saying, [...] "If we accept the right to take life before birth are we so far from making the decision after birth?" [...] She went on to say, [...] "I agree with the California abortion law passed under my husband, however, I believe it has been terribly abused". By the end of the Reagans' first term in the White House, they had changed their <b>position</b> <b>on</b> <b>abortion,</b> and in 1986 the president addressed a joint session of Congress, saying, [...] "Today there is a wound in our national conscience. America will never be whole as long as the right to life granted by our Creator is denied to the unborn". By the 1990s, Nancy Reagan reasserted her public opinion of being [...] "somewhere in the middle" [...] in not supporting abortion while believing in women's right to choose. The Dayglo Abortions's name caused the band problems in both the United States and Canada, and the cover of Feed Us A Fetus resulted in an obscenity charge that was ultimately brought before and overturned by the Supreme Court of Canada.|$|E

Three weeks before the November 1978 election, incumbent Clark had a 30 percentage-point lead in campaign polls, but he lost to Republican Roger Jepsen, 52 to 48 percent. Clark's defeat was attributed to intense anti-Clark campaigning conducted by direct mail, mailgrams, and leaflet distribution during the final weeks of the campaign, attacking Clark for his <b>positions</b> <b>on</b> <b>abortion,</b> gun control, and the Panama Canal Treaty. NCPAC took credit for Clark's defeat and was encouraged to expand its efforts in the 1980 election.|$|R
