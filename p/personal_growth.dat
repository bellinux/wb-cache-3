40|$|The big-box {{retail stores}} such as Wal-Mart and Target have {{become the focus of}} many studies researching their impacts on local {{economic}} outcomes. This dissertation studies three related topics: (i) the dynamic interrelationship among the presence of the big-box stores, retail wage, and employment, (ii) the impact of the big-box retailers on <b>personal</b> income <b>growth,</b> and (iii) the dynamic interrelationship between the presence of big-box retailers and <b>personal</b> income <b>growth.</b> The research draws important insights with potential implications for regional developers and policy makers. The first essay analyzes the dynamic relationship among the presence of the big-box retailers, retail wage, and employment at the county level for 1986 - 2005. A vector autoregression model is applied on panel data. Impulse response functions and variance decompositions are also presented. Results suggest that the presence of big-box stores decreases retail wages and increases retail employment. Retail employment has a higher impact on the retailers’ location decision than retail wage. The results also show that the presence of Wal-Mart drives the above-mentioned effects, while the presence of Target is insignificant. The second essay investigates the impact from the presence of big-box retailers on <b>personal</b> income <b>growth</b> in U. S. counties between 2000 and 2005 - based on neoclassical growth models of cross-country income convergence. Results suggest that counties having both Wal-Mart and Target stores experienced slower <b>growth</b> in <b>personal</b> income. After controlling for spatial autocorrelation, similar to the first essay, the effect of Wal-Mart’s presence on <b>personal</b> income <b>growth</b> is dominant in terms of statistical significance relative to Target’s. The third essay expands the second essay and investigates the dynamic interaction between the presence of big-box retailers and <b>personal</b> income <b>growth</b> over time at the county level for the period 1987 - 2005, using a panel vector autoregression model. For this analysis, the earning shares of natural resources and manufacturing sectors are included - assuming that all the variables are endogenous to one another. The findings indicate that big-box retailers negatively affect <b>personal</b> income <b>growth,</b> which is consistent with the second essay. However, <b>personal</b> income <b>growth</b> has an insignificant effect on the big-box retailers’ location decision...|$|R

5|$|Scout, Tenderfoot, Second Class, and First Class is {{designed}} to teach the boy Scoutcraft skills, teamwork, and self-reliance. Scout is the first rank, awarded when a boy first joins the Scouts, and requires just a rudimentary knowledge of Scouting's ideals.

Scouts with a permanent mental or physical disability may use alternate requirements, based on their abilities and approved by the council.|$|E

These discoveries destroy the protagonist’s childish naivety, but don’t allow him to build a new and more mature identity.

5|$|Boy Scouts {{learn to}} use the ideals {{spelled out in the}} Scout Oath, the Scout Law, the Outdoor Code, the Scout motto ("Be prepared"), and the Scout slogan ("Do a good turn daily"). They wear a uniform and work {{together}} in patrols of four to ten boys with an elected patrol leader. Scouts share responsibilities, apply skills learned at meetings and live together in the outdoors. The advancement system provides opportunities for <b>personal</b> <b>growth</b> and self-reliance. Scouts interact with adult leaders who act as role models and mentors, but they are expected to plan their own activities within the troop and to participate in community service. Opportunities are provided for leadership training with practical application.|$|E
5|$|The story {{describes}} the romantic relationship between Annis Wychwood, a wealthy spinster, and Oliver Carleton, a rake who cares little for society's opinion of him. The two meet while jointly supervising Carleton's ward, Lucilla. Heyer granted her heroine {{a level of}} independence that was rare in Regency times and rare for Heyer's novels. Although the hero's personality {{is similar to that}} of many of Heyer's other heroes, in a departure from romance novel convention he experienced little <b>personal</b> <b>growth</b> in the novel; his primary change was to accept that he would like to have a wife.|$|E
5|$|Venturers are {{expected}} to know and live by the Venturing Oath and Venturing Code.

Venturers plan and participate in interdependent group experiences dependent on cooperation. An emphasis on high adventure provides opportunities for team-building and practical leadership applications. A series of awards provide opportunities for recognition and <b>personal</b> <b>growth.</b> Each award requires the Venturer to teach {{what they have learned}} to others returning the skill and knowledge back to the community and enabling the Venturer to master those skills.|$|E
40|$|Canadian {{personal}} indebtedness {{has become}} excessive. Low income families seem particularily vulnerable Economic and financial fundamentals {{suggest that the}} personal debt-to-income ratio {{should be in the}} 138 % to 140 % range over the coming five years. The current ratio is at 146 %. A U. S. -style crisis is not in the making, but Canadian <b>personal</b> debt <b>growth</b> must slow relative to its past rapid pace of increase. Various factors point to a moderation of household borrowing, but a sustained low rate environment with short-term rates only returning to 3. 50 % by 2013 may still support <b>personal</b> liability <b>growth</b> of 5 % annually. With <b>personal</b> income <b>growth</b> likely to advance at 4 % per annum, personal debtto-income could rise to 151 % by 2013. This suggests that further prudential actions might be warranted, but should not occur until the current housing cooling has run its course and the economy is on a firmer footing...|$|R

5|$|This decade also {{witnessed}} {{the emergence of}} a variety of new religious movements and newly established religions in the United States, creating a spiritual milieu from which the New Age drew upon; these included the San Francisco Zen Center, Transcendental Meditation, Soka Gakkai, the Inner Peace Movement, the Church of All Worlds, and the Church of Satan. Although there had been an established interest in Asian religious ideas in the U.S. from at least the eighteenth-century, many of these new developments were variants of Hinduism, Buddhism, and Sufism which had been imported to the West from Asia following the U.S. government's decision to rescind the Asian Exclusion Act in 1965. In 1962 the Esalen Institute was established in Big Sur, California. It was from Esalen and other similar <b>personal</b> <b>growth</b> centers which had developed links to humanistic psychology that the human potential movement emerged, which would also come to exert a strong influence on the New Age.|$|E
5|$|The {{localization}} {{proved more}} challenging than other Atlus projects for multiple reasons. As the characters' text bubbles {{were designed to}} use Japanese kanji characters—which compress {{a lot of information}} into a single symbol in a way impossible in the English alphabet—each text bubble had to be individually resized and sometimes shifted so they would not intrude on other elements within scenes. The sheer amount of voice acting in the game meant that dubbing took far longer than other similar projects, running past its projected time and requiring Atlus staff members to voice very minor characters to save time. The main characters were a major focus due to the storytelling style of multiple interlinked narratives, with each character's <b>personal</b> <b>growth</b> needing to be reflected in their voice performance. This was particularly true of Mercedes. The auto-scrolling nature of dialogue, which moved along at a set pace rather than through the player's button prompts, meant that performances needed to be correctly timed and balanced to the varying paces at which the actors read their lines. This led to lines being modified during recording to keep within schedule. During the last stages, the team needed to rerecord some lines of dialogue, but to keep the localization in budget and on schedule it was done outside a professional recording studio, resulting in an audible drop in quality.|$|E
