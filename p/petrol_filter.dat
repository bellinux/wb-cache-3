40|$|The work {{is engaged}} in effect of {{short-lived}} radon (222 Rn) daughter products on measurement of radon volume activity in soil gas. Solid radon daughter products 214 Po and 218 Po transform by α-decay and influence measurement of radon volume activity in soil gas. This effect was investigated by experimental measurement of radon volume activity in soil gas at the Buk radon reference site in Central Bohemia. At each particular point of radon reference site, three values of radon volume activity were determined by measuring; without filter, with automobile <b>petrol</b> <b>filter</b> and with micro-fibrous filter AFPC type. Experimental measurement demonstrates that both of applied filters have near {{the same effect on}} measured values of radon volume activity in soil gas. The difference between radon volume activity values got by measuring without filter and with filters is low, in order of measurement error. Experiment did not evidence necessity of using filter for measuring radon volume activity in soil gas. Radon volume activity measurement error is in order of several kBq. m- 3. This fact brings uncertainty into obtained results. The absence of theoretically possible high content of solid radon daughter products in soil gas samples may be explained by possible adsorption of these particles on sampling and soil [...] ...|$|E

40|$|Various methodologies in {{economic}} literature {{have been used}} to analyse the international hydrocarbon retail sector. Nevertheless at a Spanish level these studies are much more recent and most conclude that generally there is no effective competition present in this market, regardless of the approach used. In this paper, in order to analyse the price levels in the Spanish petrol market, our starting hypothesis is that in uncompetitive markets the prices are higher and the standard deviation is lower. We use weekly retail petrol price data from the ten biggest Spanish cities, and apply Markov chains to fill the missing values for petrol 95 and diesel, and we also employ a variance filter. We conclude that this market demonstrates reduced price dispersion, regardless of brand or city.

30|$|To a {{solution}} of 2.0  g (15.1  mmol, 1.0  eq.) glutaric acid in 15  mL, THF was added 3.7  mL (45.4  mmol, 3.0  eq.) pyridine, 9.5  mL (60.5  mmol, 4.0  eq.) DIC in 10  mL THF, and 11.1  g (60.5  mmol, 4.0  eq.) pentafluorophenol in 10  mL THF. After 2  h, the solvent was removed in vacuo, and the crude dissolved in <b>petrol</b> ether was <b>filtered</b> and purified using silica gel flash chromatography (petrol ether/ethyl acetate[*]=[*] 95 / 5) yielding 6.1  g (87 %) di-pentafluorophenyl glutarate (Glut(OPfp) 2) as a white crystalline solid.
