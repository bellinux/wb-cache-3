In Studies 1 – 3, dispositionally high- and low-power participants were randomly assigned to play a high- or low-power role in an interaction with a confederate. When participants ’ dispositional and role power fit (vs. conflicted), they reported greater self-expression (Study 1). Furthermore, under dispositional-role power fit conditions, the confederate’s ratings of participants ’ emotional experiences (Study 2) and personality traits (Study 3) were more congruent with participants ’ self-reported emotions and traits.

These preferences particularly applied to respondents who were older in age, had higher levels of salary, and greater years of work experience. Gender differences were also found on ideal culture ratings with women showing greater preference for person cultures.

Challenge is marked by high cardiac output (CO) and low total peripheral resistance (TPR), while threat is marked by low CO and high TPR (Blascovich and Mendes, 2010). In the current work we addressed a possible moderator of the power-threat/challenge relationship, namely the stability of power. We examined the influence of the stability of power (roles could or could not change) on CV responses during a dyadic task where one person was the "chief designer" (high <b>power)</b> <b>and</b> one <b>person</b> was the "assistant" (low power). During the task, different CV-measures were taken [CO, TPR, heart rate, pre-ejection period). Whereas participants in the unstable low power condition showed a stronger tendency toward challenge, participants in the unstable high power condition showed a stronger tendency toward threat. Moreover, participants in the stable low power condition showed CV signs of task disengagement.

40|$|Background. In a {{clinical}} study evaluating {{the functioning of}} mobility-limited elders, muscle power accounted {{for more of the}} variation in function than strength did. There was also evidence that the power–function relationship may be described as curvilinear. However, these findings have never been confirmed in a representative population. Methods. An analysis was conducted using data from the InCHIANTI study, a population-based cohort of 1032 adults living in Italy. To assess the relationships between impairments in <b>power</b> <b>and</b> strength and mobility performance, we created separate multivariate linear and log-transformed regression models as well as separate logistic regression models. Results. Subjects were age 65 years, predominately female (54 %), {{with a mean age of}} 74. 2 years, and most had mild–moderate mobility limitations (Short Physical Performance Battery score 10. 5 6 2. 1). Though leg extension <b>power</b> <b>and</b> isometric hip extension strength were closely associated, in several separate multivariate linear regression models, leg power consistently explained more of the variance than strength did in several measures of physical performance. Differences were even larger when observed in curvilinear models of <b>power</b> <b>and</b> strength. Using separate multivariate logistic regression models to examine the odds ratios for mobility limitations in persons with low muscle power versus high muscle <b>power,</b> <b>and</b> in <b>persons</b> with low muscle strength versus high muscle strength, we found that both factors influenced risk for mobility limitations, but low power was associated with a 2 – 3 -fold greater likelihood than low strength.
