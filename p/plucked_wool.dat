40|$|Protein {{synthesis}} in wool follicles was {{studied by}} incubating <b>plucked</b> <b>wool</b> fibers at 37 Â° C in Krebs-Ringer-phosphate buffer containing 14 C-leucine and glucose. The incorporation of 14 C-leucine by the plucked fibers was maintained for 12 - 24 {{hours in the}} presence of glucose. Autoradiographs showed that the incorporated radioactivity was mainly confined to the bulb region of the fiber. Initially most of the 14 C was present in wool root proteins which were dissolved or dispersed by 8 M urea. During incubation these proteins became increasingly insoluble in 8 M urea. After 24 hours' incubation the wool roots appeared completely urea-resistant and almost all of the incorporated 14 C was present in urea-insoluble material. This change in solubility was probably due to non-enzymatic oxidation of thiol groups and was catalyzed by cupric ions {{in the presence of}} atmospheric oxygen. Electrophoresis of the wool root proteins synthesized in vitro showed that 14 C-leucine was mainly incorporated into low-sulfur keratin proteins. Despite the apparent difficulties in maintaining the urea-solubility of the wool roots in vitro, this synthesis of low-sulfur protein in the bulb region of the plucked fibers indicates that keratin biosynthesis can be satisfactorily studied in vitro by this method...|$|E
50|$|The Sto:lo {{people had}} dogs {{similar to a}} coyote, with a deep, woolly {{undercoat}} covered by a coarser long hair. The dogs were <b>plucked</b> for their <b>wool,</b> not sheared. Often the Salish would incorporate the down of water fowl or the down of milk weed into the fiber as it was being spun into yarn.|$|R

We old gluttonous fellows were never meant for mountain-climbing. And standing here over the great misty pot----" [...] But just then it seemed to Thumb he felt, light as the wind, something softly <b>pluck</b> at his <b>wool</b> hat. Very, very slowly, and without a word, {{he lifted his head}} and looked up--looked straight up into the sorrowful hairy face of a Man of the Mountains dangling, the last of a long chain, from a rocky parapet above.|$|R
50|$|Before the rya rug in Sweden, peasants {{would sleep}} between fur skins, but the skins could become stiff and the fur {{could not be}} washed. The peasants then used <b>wool</b> <b>plucked</b> {{directly}} from the sheep without spinning to simulate fur as close as possible. They used the natural colors of the wool, which were black, white, and grey, to make simple patterns in the high pile. During the weaving, the wool was knotted in. The pile side of the rya had a soft sheen that resembled fur and was placed facing the body just like the fur skins were used previously. The pattern of the flat surface of other side was given less attention, and was the part on which the owner worked in their initials into the striped geometric design. Later, the wool was put into hot water before being used, which shrunk, stiffened, and tightened the wool. Consequently, the rugs were more durable, but were not as soft and glossy as earlier rya rugs.|$|R
500|$|One chief {{difference}} between ancient sheep and modern breeds is the technique by which wool could be collected. Primitive sheep can be shorn, but many {{can have their}} <b>wool</b> <b>plucked</b> out by hand in a process called [...] "rooing". Rooing helps to leave behind the coarse fibers called kemps which are still longer than the soft fleece. The fleece may also be collected from the field after it falls out naturally. This rooing trait survives today in unrefined breeds such as the Soay and many Shetlands. Indeed, the Soay, along with other Northern European breeds with short tails, naturally rooing fleece, diminutive size, and horns in both sexes, {{are closely related to}} ancient sheep. Originally, weaving and spinning wool was a handicraft practiced at home, rather than an industry. Babylonians, Sumerians, and Persians all depended on sheep; and although linen was the first fabric to be fashioned in to clothing, wool was a prized product. The raising of flocks for their fleece was one of the earliest industries, and flocks were a medium of exchange in barter economies. Numerous biblical figures kept large flocks, and subjects of the king of Israel were taxed according to the number of rams they owned.|$|R
