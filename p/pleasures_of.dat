5|$|On 31 March 1731, The Author's Farce was {{paired with}} the Tom Thumb remake, The Tragedy of Tragedies, as a {{replacement}} for The Letter Writers, the original companion piece. Although both Tragedy of Tragedies and The Author's Farce were main shows, they alternated on the billing until the 18 June 1731 performance, the final showing of any Fielding play in the Little Theatre except for a 12 May 1732 benefit show of The Author's Farce. The last documented non-puppet version was performed on 28 March 1748 by Theophilus Cibber as a two-act companion piece for a benefit show. The <b>Pleasures</b> <b>of</b> the Town act was performed as a one-act play outside London throughout the century, including a 15-show run at Norwich in 1749 and during the 1750s, and a production at York during the 1751–52 theatre season. Additionally, there were benefit shows that included the third act at a variety of locations, including Dublin, on 19 December 1763 and Edinburgh in 1763. There were also many performances of the puppet theatre versions, including a travelling show by Thomas Yeates, titled Punch's Oratory, or The <b>Pleasures</b> <b>of</b> the Town, which started in 1734.|$|E

5|$|Some {{philosophers}} and Christians resisted {{the demands of}} the body and the <b>pleasures</b> <b>of</b> food, and adopted fasting as an ideal. Food became simpler in general as urban life in the West diminished, trade routes were disrupted, and the rich retreated to the more limited self-sufficiency of their country estates. As an urban lifestyle came to be associated with decadence, the Church formally discouraged gluttony, and hunting and pastoralism were seen as simple, virtuous ways of life.|$|E
5|$|A common {{interpretation}} of Either/Or presents {{the reader with}} a choice between two approaches to life. There are no standards or guidelines which indicate how to choose. The reasons for choosing an ethical way of life over the aesthetic only make sense if one is already committed to an ethical way of life. Suggesting the aesthetic approach as evil implies one has already accepted {{the idea that there}} is a good/evil distinction to be made. Likewise, choosing an aesthetic way of life only appeals to the aesthete, ruling Judge Vilhelm's ethics as inconsequential and preferring the <b>pleasures</b> <b>of</b> seduction. Thus, existentialists see Victor Eremita as presenting a radical choice in which no pre-ordained value can be discerned. One must choose, and through one's choices, one creates what one is.|$|E
5|$|The Author's Farce and the <b>Pleasures</b> <b>of</b> the Town is a {{play by the}} English {{playwright and}} novelist Henry Fielding, first {{performed}} on 30 March 1730 at the Little Theatre, Haymarket. Written {{in response to the}} Theatre Royal's rejection of his earlier plays, The Author's Farce was Fielding's first theatrical success. The Little Theatre allowed Fielding the freedom to experiment, and to alter the traditional comedy genre. The play ran during the early 1730s and was altered for its run starting 21 April 1730 and again in response to the Actor Rebellion of 1733. Throughout its life, the play was coupled with several different plays, including The Cheats of Scapin and Fielding's Tom Thumb.|$|E

5|$|The Author's Farce and the <b>Pleasures</b> <b>of</b> the Town {{was written}} during 1729. The first press {{announcement}} of the play appeared on 18 March 1730 in the Daily Post, stating {{that it was in}} rehearsal. An advertisement appeared in the same newspaper shortly afterwards mentioning restricted seating and high ticket prices, suggesting that the play was expected to be a popular entertainment. It opened on Easter Monday, 30 March 1730, at the Little Theatre, Haymarket, and shortly thereafter was billed alongside The Cheats of Scapin. The last act was later made into the companion piece to Hurlothrumbo for one show.|$|E
5|$|The {{first and}} second acts deal with the {{attempts}} of the central character, Harry Luckless, to woo his landlady's daughter, and his efforts to make money by writing plays. In the second act, he finishes a puppet theatre play titled The <b>Pleasures</b> <b>of</b> the Town, about the Goddess Nonsense's choice of a husband from allegorical representatives of theatre and other literary genres. After its rejection by one theatre, Luckless's play is staged at another. The third act becomes a play within a play, in which {{the characters in the}} puppet play are portrayed by humans. The Author's Farce ends with a merging of the play's and the puppet show's realities.|$|E
5|$|While Vali's {{acquisition}} of Ruma— elder brother taking his younger sister-in-law as wife—is universally condemned; however as in Tara's case, elder brother's widow marrying her younger brother-in-law {{seems to be}} a social norm. Ramashraya Sharma considers that Rama's silence on marriage of Tara and Sugriva does not signal non-acceptance of the act, but rather that he is not concerned with the issue of the sexual relations of the loose charactered vanaras, in which Tara and Ruma exchange hands between the brothers. Ramayana mentions that Sugriva indulges in sexual <b>pleasures</b> <b>of</b> women, including Ruma and Tara, who he coveted. In Ramayana however, Angada criticizes Sugriva for his lustful marriage to his elder sister-in-law Tara, who is like a mother to him. Though a political marriage, Tara serves Sugriva loyally.|$|E
40|$|George Santayana (1896) defined beauty as the {{pleasure}} we attribute to an object. But is the <b>pleasure</b> <b>of</b> beauty really {{different from the}} <b>pleasure</b> <b>of</b> other activities? Various activities give rise to pleasure. Participants rated (0 - 10) the <b>pleasure</b> <b>of</b> different activities at regular intervals. We find that, once the activity ends, {{the pleasure}} decays at various rates, ranging from playing volleyball (- 0. 1 point/minute), eating ice cream (- 0. 33 pt/min), playing Pictionary (- 0. 5 pt/min), to listening to music (- 1 pt/min). Observers rated how much thought (0 - 10) was required by each activity. The <b>pleasure</b> <b>of</b> activities requiring the least thought decays most quickly whereas activities requiring more thought produce pleasures that linger longer. High-thought activities decayed slowly (- 0. 05 /min) and the <b>pleasure</b> <b>of</b> low-thought activities decayed quickly (- 0. 5 /min). This supports Kant’s claim {{that there is a}} fundamental difference between thoughtless and thoughtful pleasure, including beauty...|$|R

5|$|Most of Fielding's plays {{were written}} in five acts, but The Author's Farce was written in three. The opening {{introduces}} the main character, Harry Luckless, and his attempts to woo Harriot, the daughter of his landlady Mrs. Moneywood. The play begins {{in much the same}} way as Fielding's earlier romance-themed comedies, but quickly becomes a different type of play, mocking the literary and theatrical establishment. Luckless is trying to become a successful writer, but lacks the income that would allow him to concentrate on his writing. Although others try to support him financially, Luckless refuses their help; when his friend, Witmore, pays his rent behind his back, Luckless steals the money from Mrs. Moneywood. In the second act, Luckless seeks assistance to help finish his play, The <b>Pleasures</b> <b>of</b> the Town, but is poorly advised, and the work is rejected by his local theatre. Luckless revises his play and succeeds in finding an alternative venue, leading to the third act, in which the work is performed as a puppet show, with actors taking the place of the puppets.|$|E
5|$|The elite, hand-selected {{audience}} members favored with admission to performances by the concerto delle donne demanded diversions and entertainment beyond the <b>pleasures</b> <b>of</b> beautiful music alone. During the concerts, {{members of the}} concertos audience would sometimes play cards. Orazio Urbani, ambassador of the Grand Duke of Tuscany, having waited several years to see the concerto, complained that he was forced not only to play cards, distracting him from the performance, but also simultaneously admire and praise the women's music to their patron Alfonso. After at least one concert, to continue the entertainment, a dwarf couple danced. Alfonso was not as interested in these peripheral entertainments, and in one instance excused himself from the party to go sit under a tree {{to listen to the}} ladies, and follow along with the madrigal texts and musical scores, including embellishments, which were made available to listeners.|$|E
5|$|Bertram meets Raimbaut, who {{has arrived}} for an {{assignation}} with Alice. He {{gives him a}} bag of gold and advises him not to marry Alice as his new wealth will attract plenty of women (Ah! l’honnête homme). Raimbaut leaves and Bertram gloats at having corrupted him. Bertram reveals that Robert, to whom he is truly devoted, is his son; he then enters an adjoining cave to commune with the spirits of hell. Alice enters and expresses her love for Raimbaut (Quand je quittai la Normandie). She overhears strange chanting coming from the cave and decides to listen; she learns that Bertram will lose Robert forever if he cannot persuade him to sign away his soul to the Devil by midnight. On emerging from the cave, Bertram realizes that Alice has heard everything (Mais Alice, qu’as-tu donc?). He threatens her and she promises to keep silent. Robert arrives, mourning the loss of Isabelle, and Bertram tells him that to win her he should seize a magic branch from the tomb of Saint Rosalia in a nearby deserted cloister. Although to take it is sacrilege, the branch will give Robert magical powers. Robert declares {{that he will be}} bold and do as Bertram instructs. Bertram leads Robert to the cloister. The ghosts of nuns rise from their tombs, beckoned by Bertram, and dance, praising the <b>pleasures</b> <b>of</b> drinking, gambling and lust. Robert seizes the branch and fends off the demons who surround him.|$|E

40|$|The {{aims of the}} {{research}} are (1) to define the dark themes contained in John Boyne’s The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas, and (2) to reveal how the dark themes represent the <b>pleasure</b> <b>of</b> the main characters. Therefore, {{the research}}er applies children’s literature and <b>pleasure</b> <b>of</b> children’s literature theories. 	The researcher used qualitative descriptive content analysis. The subject of the research was a novel entitled The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas written by John Boyne. The data of the research were significant expressions related to the dark themes of the novel and how the dark themes represent the <b>pleasure</b> <b>of</b> the main characters {{in the form of}} sentence. The researcher was the primary instrument of the research and the two data tables are the secondary instrument. The triangulation technique was used to ensure the data trustworthiness. 	The findings of the research show that there are five dark themes found in the novel. They are the children’s anger, people’s oppression toward children, children’s sadness, children’s insecurity, and children’s dark environment. The dark themes represent the oppression toward the main characters and their response upon it. The researcher found three main categories on how pleasure is embodied in the novel. They are the <b>pleasure</b> <b>of</b> observing, the <b>pleasure</b> <b>of</b> learning, and the <b>pleasure</b> <b>of</b> understanding. Therefore, <b>pleasure</b> becomes an important element in children’s literature.
