2500|$|A major {{application}} for ESI is {{the field of}} protein mass spectrometry. Here, the MS {{is used for the}} identification and sizing of proteins. The identification of a protein sample can be done in an ESI-MS by de novo peptide sequencing (using tandem mass spectrometry) or peptide mass fingerprinting. Both methods require the previous digestion of proteins to peptides, mostly accomplished enzymatically using proteases. As well for the digestion in solution as for the in-gel digestion buffered solutions are needed, whose content in salts is too high and in analyte is too low for a successful ESI-MS measurement. Therefore, a combined desalting and concentration step is performed. Usually a reversed phase liquid chromatography is used, in which the peptides stay bound to the chromatography matrix whereas the salts are removed by washing. The peptides can be eluted from the matrix by the use of a small volume of a solution containing a large portion of organic solvent, which results in the reduction of the final volume of the analyte. In LC-MS the desalting/concentration is realised with a <b>pre-column,</b> in off-line measurements reversed phase micro columns are used, which can be used directly with [...] microliter pipettes.

Four modes of attachment of the aminoalkyladenylate to Sepharose were studied. The interaction between amino acid derivatives and the corresponding aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases is too weak to allow their use as ligands for affinity chromatography. Attachment of the aminoalkyladenylate via the alpha-nitrogen atom of the amino acid or via C- 8 of the nucleotide abolishes synthetase binding, and immobilization via the oxidized ribose ring is only marginally useful. However, attachment of the aminoalkyladenylate to the matrix via N- 6 of the nucleotide allows strong and specific synthetase binding, {{and the use of}} such columns permits the isolation of homogeneous synthetase from crude mixtures.

The main focus of this master thesis was the development of 20 μm inner diameter (ID) open tubular enzyme reactors (OTERs) based on 2 -hydroxyethyl methacrylate-co-vinyl azlactone (HEMA-VDM) for on-line protein digestion of limited sample sizes in a nano liquid chromatography (LC) - mass spectrometry (MS) system. Monolithic solid phase extraction (SPE) <b>pre-columns</b> based on butyl methacrylate (BuMa) and polystyrene divinylbenzene (PS-DVB) were prepared in 50 μm ID capillaries and used for trapping of peptides generated by the OTER. These peptides were then separated using 10 μm ID PS-DVB porous layer open tubular (PLOT) columns. The developed OTER was prepared by polymerization using a polymerization mixture consisting of HEMA and VDM as monomer, 1 -heptanol or 1 -decanol as porogen, and 2, 2 ´azobis(2 -methylpropinonitrile) (AIBN) as initiator. Short OTERs were prepared with 1 -decanol as porogen, while for longer OTERs, 1 -heptanol was used. The sample was loaded onto the OTER with a loading buffer consisting of 50 mM NH 4 OAc pH 8. 75 with 4 % acetonitrile (ACN). A trapping time of 4 min from the OTER to the SPE column {{was found to be}} optimal (for the short OTER) using the manual LC-MS-system (developed by Hanne K. Hustoft). The run-to-run retention time repeatability in this system, was 0. 25 - 0. 44 % in relative standard deviation (RSD %), and 300 attomoles of targeted recombinant progastrin-releasing peptide isoform 1 (ProGRP) could be detected.

The CFCs analytical system was composed mainly of devices of purging, trapping and analyzing. In the system, the ultrapure N 2 was used as purging and carrier gas. To avoid contamination and to reduce noise of system background, all devices were made without any plastics, and the valves were in purge housings flushed with carrier gas. First, the sample was introduced into a stripping chamber, and the CFCs were purged with ultrapure N 2 and quantitatively collected in a trap (A 35  cm long, 1 / 8 steel use stainless (SUS) pipe, filled with Res-sil C and Porapak T) cooled at − 40  °C by a refrigerant mixture of methanol and dry ice. Then the trap should be heated to 95  °C in the hot water to let the CFCs be injected into the gas chromatography through <b>pre-column</b> and analytical column in sequence by carrier gas. CFCs can be separated from other halocarbons in the <b>pre-column.</b> After CFCs entered the analytical column, the <b>pre-column</b> was back flushed to remove all other highly retentive halocarbons. The purified CFCs are analyzed by a gas chromatograph (GC- 14 B, Shimadzu) equipped with an electron capture detector (ECD). After analysis has been completed, the water sample is drained into a pre-weighed beaker and then weighed for the calculation of CFCs concentration which is reported in pmol/kg of water. The uncertainties for CFCs determinations are approximately 1  % for water equilibrated with the ambient atmosphere.|$|E
40|$|Objective(s) A {{sensitive}} liquid chromatographic {{method for}} the analysis of clarithromycin- a macrolide antibiotic- in human serum, using <b>pre-column</b> derivatization with 9 -fluorenylmethyl chloroformate (FMOC-Cl) is described. Materials and Methods The method involved liquid–liquid extraction of the drug and an internal standard (amantadine) followed by <b>pre-column</b> derivatization of the analytes with FMOC-Cl. A mixture of 0. 05 M phosphate buffer containing triethylamine (2 ml/l; pH 3. 8) and methanol (17 : 83, v/v) was used as mobile phase and chromatographic separation was achieved on a Shimpack CLC-ODS column. The eluate was monitored by a fluorescence detector with respective excitation and emission wavelengths of 265 and 315 nm. Results The analytical method was linear over the concentration range of 0. 025 - 10 µg/ml of clarithromycin in human serum with a limit of quantification of 0. 025 µg/ml. The assay is sensitive enough to measure drug levels obtained in human single dose studies. Conclusion In the present method, sensitivity and the running time of analysis have been improved and successfully applied in a bioequivalence study of three different clarithromycin preparations in 12 healthy volunteers...|$|E
40|$|Building on {{previous}} research on the origin and homochirality of life, this study focuses on analyses profiling important building blocks of life: the natural amino acids. The spark discharge variation of the iconic Miller experiment was performed with a reducing gas mixture of ammonia, methane, water and hydrogen. Amino acid analysis using liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry after <b>pre-column</b> derivatizaiton revealed the generation of several amino acids including those essential for life. Re-crystallization of the synthetic products and enantiomeric ratio analysis were subsequently performed. Results from liquid chromatography coupled with either fluorescent detector or tandem mass spectrometry after <b>pre-column</b> derivatization with chiral reagent revealed spontaneous and effective asymmetric resolution of serine and alanine. This work describes a useful analytical platform for investigation of hypotheses regarding the origin and homochirality of amino acids under prebiotic conditions. The formation of numerous amino acids in the electric discharge experiment and the occurrence of high enantiomeric ratios of amino acids in re-crystallization experiment give valuable implications for future studies in unraveling fundamental questions regarding origins and evolution of life...|$|E
40|$|Coupled with {{off-line}} extraction, a <b>pre-column</b> derivatization liquid chromatographic {{fluorescence detection}} (LC-FL) procedure {{was developed for}} the determination of atrazine and simazine in soil, crop and water samples. Concentrations in real samples {{were expected to be}} at or below the low ng/g level, which requires pre-concentration of analytes and improved detection. 4 -(2 -Phthalimidyl) benzoyl chloride (PIB-Cl) was used as a <b>pre-column</b> derivatization reagent for highperformance liquid chromatography. The clean-up and second-time concentration procedures, which were indispensable in the conventional analytical methods for soil and crop analysis because of the complexity of the samples, were replaced by a derivatization reaction between PIB-Cl and the analytes. The fluorescent and ultraviolet characteristics of the derivatives were investigated. The derivatization reaction and chromatographic separation conditions were optimized systematically. Detection limits of 1. 2 ng/g for atrazine and 1. 1 ng/g for simazine were obtained with recoveries of 84 - 95 % for environmental samples. On the basis of practical application to five soil and five crop samples, the LC-FL method was compared with the conventional GC-MS method. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
