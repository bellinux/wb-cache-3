5|$|As China {{entered the}} early modern period, the I Ching took on renewed {{relevance}} in both Confucian and Daoist study. The Kangxi Emperor was especially fond of the I Ching and ordered new interpretations of it. Qing dynasty scholars focused more intently on understanding pre-classical grammar, assisting {{the development of new}} <b>philological</b> approaches in the modern period.|$|E
5|$|The {{name was}} coined by the {{historian}} Andrew Watson in an influential 1974 paper. He listed eighteen crops that were widely diffused during the Islamic period, including four staple crops, namely durum wheat, Asiatic rice, sorghum, and cotton. He {{also argued that}} techniques such as irrigation were spread across the region at that time. The paper was not based on direct archaeological or scientific evidence, and its approach has been called old-fashioned and <b>philological.</b>|$|E
5|$|Carl Joachim Hambro (7 June 1914 – 19 February 1985) was a Norwegian novelist, journalist, essayist, {{translator}} and Romance philologist. The {{son of the}} Conservative politician C. J. Hambro, he {{embarked on}} a <b>philological</b> career, graduating in 1939. During the Second World War he taught at Oslo Commerce School and the Norwegian College in Uppsala. After the war, he taught Norwegian at Sorbonne, whilst also working as Paris correspondent for the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation and a few Norwegian daily newspapers.|$|E
5|$|Hermes o Logios faced serious {{financial}} problems during this period. When the Russo-Turkish War of 1806–1812 ended, Ignatios {{was forced to}} resign and leave Bucharest and its main sponsor, the <b>Philological</b> Society, ceased to exist. In an announcement published as an appendix to the issues of 1813 (dated April 1, 1813), Alexandros Vasileiou, a supporter of Korais and influential personality within the Greek community of Vienna, states this fact, as well as that the periodical had too few subscribers. He therefore called on all readers to canvass for new subscribers; moreover he called upon all scholars to send in their contributions.|$|E
5|$|In November 1937, Armstrong became {{sick with}} a {{persistent}} bout of influenza. Her condition worsened, {{and at the}} age of 55 on 9 December 1937, she died at Finchley Memorial Hospital, Middlesex, following a stroke. There was a service for her at Golders Green Crematorium at noon on 13 December. The University College Provost, Secretary, and Tutor to Women Students were among those present at her funeral. Her obituary was printed in The Times, The New York Times, Nature, , the Annual Report for University College, and other journals; her death was also reported in Transactions of the <b>Philological</b> Society, among other publications.|$|E
5|$|In {{the view}} of Mary Beagon, writing in The Classical Tradition in 2010:the Historia naturalis has regained its status {{to a greater extent}} than at any time since the advent of Humanism. Work by those with {{scientific}} as well as <b>philological</b> expertise has resulted in improvements both to Pliny's text and to his reputation as a scientist. The essential coherence of his enterprise has also been rediscovered, and his ambitious portrayal, in all its manifestations, of 'nature, that is, life'.. is recognized as a unique cultural record of its time.|$|E
5|$|The {{periodical}} {{started its}} circulation after a proposal by Adamantios Korais, a leading {{figure of the}} modern Greek Enlightenment, who had stressed the need of a printed medium, written in vernacular Greek. This initiative {{was supported by the}} <b>Philological</b> Society in Bucharest, an organization consisting of Greek intellectuals. Hermes o Logios reflected the style of other European periodicals of early 19th century and reviewed developments in arts and sciences, being an important channel for bringing contemporary intellectual movements {{to the attention of the}} Greeks that lived in the Ottoman Empire. It was closed down by the Austrian authorities when the Greek War of Independence broke out.|$|E
5|$|Tod's {{enthusiasm for}} bardic poetry {{reflected}} {{the works of}} Sir Walter Scott on Scottish subjects, which had a considerable influence both on British literary society and, bearing in mind Tod's Scottish ancestry, on Tod himself. Tod reconstructed Rajput history {{on the basis of}} the ancient texts and folklore of the Rajputs, although not everyone– for example, the polymath James Mill– accepted the historical validity of the native works. Tod also used <b>philological</b> techniques to reconstruct areas of Rajput history that were not even known to the Rajputs themselves, by drawing on works such as the religious texts known as Puranas.|$|E
5|$|For pharmacology, Shen {{wrote of}} the {{difficulties}} of adequate diagnosis and therapy, {{as well as the}} proper selection, preparation, and administration of drugs. He held great concern for detail and <b>philological</b> accuracy in identification, use and cultivation of different types of medicinal herbs, such as in which months medicinal plants should be gathered, their exact ripening times, which parts should be used for therapy; for domesticated herbs he wrote about planting times, fertilization, and other matters of horticulture. In the realms of botany, zoology, and mineralogy, Shen Kuo documented and systematically described hundreds of different plants, agricultural crops, rare vegetation, animals, and minerals found in China. For example, Shen noted that the mineral orpiment was used to quickly erase writing errors on paper.|$|E
5|$|The I Ching {{has been}} {{translated}} into Western languages dozens of times. The most influential edition is the 1923 German translation of Richard Wilhelm, later translated to English by Cary Baynes. The earliest complete published I Ching translation in a Western language was a Latin translation done in the 1730s by Jesuit missionary Jean-Baptiste Régis that was published in Germany in the 1830s. Although Thomas McClatchie and James Legge had both translated the text in the 19th century, the text gained significant traction during the counterculture of the 1960s, with the translations of Wilhelm and John Blofeld attracting particular interest. Richard Rutt's 1996 translation incorporated {{much of the new}} archaeological and <b>philological</b> discoveries of the 20th century. Gregory Whincup's 1986 translation also attempts to reconstruct Zhou period readings.|$|E
5|$|The faculty {{includes}} {{scholars such as}} {{the former}} President of the American <b>Philological</b> Association James J. O'Donnell, theologian John Haught, social activists Sam Marullo and Chai Feldblum, Nobel laureate George Akerlof, and preeminent hip-hop scholar Michael Eric Dyson. Many former politicians choose to teach at Georgetown, including the former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Jeane Kirkpatrick, U.S. Agency for International Development administrator Andrew Natsios, National Security Advisor Anthony Lake, and CIA director George Tenet. Internationally, the school attracts numerous former ambassadors and heads of state, such as Prime Minister of Spain José María Aznar, Saudi Ambassador Prince Turki bin Faisal Al Saud, and President of Colombia Álvaro Uribe.|$|E
5|$|The {{scholarly}} {{study of}} traditional Italian music began in about 1850, {{with a group}} of early <b>philological</b> ethnographers who studied the impact of music on a pan-Italian national identity. A unified Italian identity only just started to develop after the political integration of the peninsula in 1860. The focus at that time was on the lyrical and literary value of music, rather than the instrumentation; this focus remained until the early 1960s. Two folkloric journals helped to encourage the burgeoning field of study, the Rivista Italiana delle Tradizioni Popolari and Lares, founded in 1894 and 1912, respectively. The earliest major musical studies were on the Sardinian launeddas in 1913-1914 by Mario Giulio Fara; on Sicilian music, published in 1907 and 1921 by Alberto Favara; and studies of the music of Emilia Romagna in 1941 by Francesco Balilla Pratella.|$|E
5|$|During the 18th {{century the}} ideals of the Western European Enlightenment and the French Revolution became widely known to the Greek scholars. They soon {{realized}} the potential of these new ideals, and especially of popular freedom and sovereignty for their own national struggle against Ottoman rule. Adamantios Korais, a humanist scholar and leading figure of the modern Greek Enlightenment, had stressed the desirability of a printed medium, written in the vernacular language, in order to spread these ideas to the Greek people, that lived in the Ottoman Empire and the Diaspora in Western Europe as well. Korais explained about the necessity of a periodical that would gather material from political and <b>philological</b> newspapers of the enlightened peoples of Europe and contain reports from Ottoman-ruled Greece. He also stressed that this should be edited by a man of learning, and proposed that his friend Anthimos Gazis, scholar and Orthodox priest in Vienna, would be the most suitable person.|$|E

25|$|During the 1870s, the <b>Philological</b> Society was {{concerned}} {{with the process of}} publishing a dictionary with such an immense scope. They had pages printed by publishers, but no publication agreement was reached; both the Cambridge University Press and the Oxford University Press were approached. The OUP finally agreed in 1879 (after two years of negotiating by Sweet, Furnivall, and Murray) to publish the dictionary and to pay Murray, who was both the editor and the <b>Philological</b> Society president. The dictionary was to be published as interval fascicles, with the final form in four 6,400-page volumes. They hoped to finish the project in ten years.|$|E
