50|$|You are dealt a hand of six cards. If {{you have}} no {{characters}} in your initial hand, you return your hand to the <b>draw</b> <b>pile</b> and <b>draw</b> a fresh hand, continuing to do so until you {{have at least one}} character in your hand.|$|R
5000|$|Take the top cards of {{both the}} [...] "4th player's" [...] discard <b>pile</b> and the <b>draw</b> <b>pile</b> {{and replace them with}} the top two cards of your own pile.|$|R
5000|$|Whenever {{a player}} passes a turn, that player must {{pick up a}} card from the <b>draw</b> <b>pile.</b> When {{there are no more}} cards left in the <b>draw</b> <b>pile</b> game resumes to {{standard}} thirteen.|$|R
25|$|Note {{that play}} {{continues}} after the <b>draw</b> <b>pile</b> is exhausted, each player playing or discarding one card per turn. Once both players {{run out of}} cards in their hand with a depleted <b>draw</b> <b>pile,</b> play ends.|$|R
50|$|The game ends {{when one}} player has {{accumulated}} 100 or more View-points, or the <b>Draw</b> <b>Pile</b> and all players' Hands are empty. The <b>Draw</b> <b>Pile</b> {{does not get}} automatically replenished after it runs out of cards.|$|R
50|$|Dolphins {{typically}} {{consist of}} a number of piles driven into the seabed or riverbed, and connected above the water level to provide a platform or fixing point. The piles can be untreated azobé wood, pressure treated pine wood poles, or steel or reinforced concrete beams, blocks or tubes. Smaller dolphins can have the <b>piles</b> <b>drawn</b> together with wire rope, but larger dolphins are typically fixed using a reinforced concrete capping or a structural steel frame.|$|R
5000|$|A player wins {{when they}} have 3 sets of {{different}} colored properties on his turn. This {{means that there is}} only one winner for any one game. Usually, if there are no longer any cards left in the <b>Draw</b> <b>Pile,</b> a player would shuffle the cards remaining in the Play <b>Pile</b> and <b>draw</b> the card(s) required.|$|R
50|$|Pick-up ALL of {{the cards}} in the Discard <b>Pile.</b> Before <b>drawing,</b> players may examine and re-arrange the Discard Pile in any manner.|$|R
50|$|The rest of {{the cards}} are called the <b>Draw</b> <b>Pile,</b> and is placed in a central location, usually fanned a bit to the side instead of stacked neatly. Future draws are always taken {{from one end of}} the <b>Draw</b> <b>Pile.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{cards are}} shuffled and each player {{receives}} eight. The {{rest of the}} deck becomes the <b>draw</b> <b>pile.</b> The top card in the <b>draw</b> <b>pile</b> is turned over and placed face {{up next to the}} <b>draw</b> <b>pile</b> to form a discard pile. The upper card of the discard pile is called the Leading Card. The youngest player goes first. Starting clockwise, each player discards a card (or cards) onto the leading card, by (a) matching its color; or (b) matching its number or figure; or (c) using a SuperTaki, Switch Color, or King card. A player who cannot play draws one card from the <b>draw</b> <b>pile.</b> It may be used only in the next round. A player who is left with one card in his hand must announce [...] "Last card!" [...] If he fails to do this before the next player made his move, he draws 4 cards from the <b>draw</b> <b>pile.</b> The game ends when the first player has discarded his last card.|$|R

5000|$|The active player {{draws the}} top two cards from the <b>draw</b> <b>pile.</b> He or she must do this at the {{beginning}} of his or her turn. As soon as the <b>draw</b> <b>pile</b> is empty, shuffle the discard pile to create a new playing deck. Some characters have abilities that vary the number of cards drawn per turn.|$|R

5000|$|One {{player is}} {{chosen to be}} the dealer (alternately, the deal can rotate to the left after each hand). The dealer shuffles the deck and deals 10 cards, face down, one at a time, to each player. Players hold their 10 cards in hand so that the other players cannot see them. The {{remaining}} deck is placed face-down {{in the center of}} the play area to become the <b>draw</b> <b>pile.</b> A wild card turned up goes to the next player. The dealer then turns the top card of the <b>draw</b> <b>pile</b> over and places it next to the <b>draw</b> <b>pile,</b> to become the discard pile. During the first hand, all players try to complete Phase 1. Play consists of; ...|$|R
50|$|During play, {{cards are}} {{considered}} to be in one of 4 zones - <b>Draw</b> <b>Pile</b> (from which cards are <b>drawn),</b> Discard <b>Pile</b> (where discarded or cancelled cards are placed), Hand (where cards are placed when drawn and where cards are played from) and Field of View (where cards are played into). Each player has their own Field of View and Hand, whilst the <b>Draw</b> <b>Pile</b> and Discard Pile are shared.|$|R

5000|$|Both players deal five {{cards to}} {{themselves}} and leave {{the rest of the}} cards upside down on their <b>draw</b> <b>pile.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Discard a card: The player {{chooses a}} card {{from his hand}} and adds it to the discard <b>pile,</b> then <b>draws</b> a card to replace it. The {{discarded}} card {{is out of the}} game and can no longer be played. Discarding a card replenishes one information token.|$|R
50|$|Each {{player is}} dealt five cards {{to form a}} hand, and each player is dealt 15 cards face down to form a <b>draw</b> <b>pile.</b> If playing with jokers, they are used as wild cards and give each <b>draw</b> <b>pile</b> 16 cards. Two stacks of five cards, placed face down on each side between the players, serve as {{replacement}} piles. Finally, two cards are placed {{face down in the}} center between the replacement piles.|$|R
50|$|FIVE OR SIX PLAYERSFor 5-6 player games, {{the game}} is {{slightly}} different. The whole deck is dealt out {{so there is no}} <b>draw</b> <b>pile.</b>|$|R
50|$|At {{the end of}} a turn, players {{replenish}} {{their hands}} up to their hand limit (or, if already at their hand limit, exchange one card in their hand for a new one); players begin with a limit of three cards, but this may be expanded with certain improvements. When drawing a new card, players may choose to take the top card from any <b>draw</b> <b>pile,</b> or pay two resources to look through any one <b>draw</b> <b>pile</b> and take the card they need.|$|R

50|$|For each Sickness point {{a player}} has, {{they can hold}} one less card in their hand. At five points of Sickness, a player Swoons, loses their entire Fate <b>pile,</b> and <b>draws</b> five cards. A player who is not In Debt can draw cards from the discard pile. The first player to twenty Goth points wins.|$|R
50|$|As in {{the game}} Three Thirteen, players create sets or runs of 3 or more, using the Jokers and the current round's wild card as wilds. Each round has a {{different}} wild card (the 3's in the 3-card hand, 4's in the 4-card hand, 5's in the 5-card hand, and so on until the King is wild in the 13-card hand). The rest of the cards are placed face down to form a <b>draw</b> <b>pile</b> and the top card is turned over to form the discard <b>pile.</b> Players <b>draw</b> one card {{from the top of}} the <b>draw</b> or discard <b>pile,</b> add it to their hand, and then discard one card to end their turn.|$|R

The remaining cards form a <b>draw</b> <b>pile,</b> and the top one is turned over to form a discard pile (if this card is a power card, it is shuffled back into the <b>draw</b> <b>pile</b> and a replacement is dealt).|$|R
