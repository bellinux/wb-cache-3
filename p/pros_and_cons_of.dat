5|$|Gilmour had {{recorded}} his second solo album, About Face, in 1984, {{and he used}} it to express his feelings about a variety of topics, from the murder of John Lennon to his relationship with Waters. He later stated that he used the album {{to distance himself from}} Pink Floyd. Soon afterwards, Waters began touring his first solo album, The <b>Pros</b> <b>and</b> <b>Cons</b> <b>of</b> Hitch Hiking. Wright formed Zee with Dave Harris and recorded Identity, which went almost unnoticed upon its release. Mason released his second solo album, Profiles, in August 1985.|$|E

5|$|Waters began touring {{in support}} of the album, aided by Clapton, a new band, new material, and a {{selection}} of Pink Floyd favourites. Waters débuted his tour in Stockholm on 16 June 1984. Poor ticket sales plagued the tour, and some of the larger venues had to be cancelled. By his own estimate, he lost £400,000 on the tour. In March 1985, Waters went to North America to play smaller venues with the Pros and Cons Plus Some Old Pink Floyd Stuff—North America Tour 1985. The <b>Pros</b> <b>and</b> <b>Cons</b> <b>of</b> Hitch Hiking has been certified Gold by the RIAA.|$|E

5|$|In July 1978, amid a {{financial}} crisis caused by negligent investments, Waters presented the group with two original ideas for their next album. The first was a 90-minute demo with the working title Bricks in the Wall, and the other would later become Waters' first solo album, The <b>Pros</b> <b>and</b> <b>Cons</b> <b>of</b> Hitch Hiking. Although both Mason and Gilmour were initially cautious, they chose the former to be their next album. Bob Ezrin co-produced, and he wrote a forty-page script for the new album. Ezrin based {{the story on the}} central figure of Pink—a gestalt character inspired by Waters' childhood experiences, the most notable of which was {{the death of his father}} in World War II. This first metaphorical brick led to more problems; Pink would become drug-addled and depressed by the music industry, eventually transforming into a megalomaniac, a development inspired partly by the decline of Syd Barrett. At the end of the album, the increasingly fascist audience would watch as Pink tore down the wall, once again becoming a regular and caring person.|$|E
5|$|There {{are many}} {{stakeholders}} {{in many countries}} such as The United States who report several concerns in the usage of rules-based accounting. According to recent studies, many believe that the principles-based approach in financial reporting would not only improve but would also support an auditor upon dealing with client’s pressure. As a result, financial reports could be viewed with fairness and transparency. When the U.S. switched to International accounting standards, they are composed that this would bring change. However, as a new chairperson of the SEC takes over the system, the transition brings a stronger review about the <b>pros</b> <b>and</b> <b>cons</b> <b>of</b> rules- based accounting. While the move towards international standards progresses, there are small amount of research that examines the effect of principle- based standards in an auditor’s decision- making process. According to 114 auditing experts, most are willing to allow clients to manage their net income based on rules- based standards. These results offers insight to the SEC, IASB and FASB in weighing the arguments in the debate of principles- vs. rules based- accounting.|$|E
5|$|Waters' solo work {{includes}} the studio albums The <b>Pros</b> <b>and</b> <b>Cons</b> <b>of</b> Hitch Hiking, Radio K.A.O.S., Amused to Death, and Is This the Life We Really Want?. In 1990, he staged {{one of the}} largest and most extravagant rock concerts in history, The Wall– Live in Berlin, with an official attendance of 200,000. As a member of Pink Floyd, he was inducted into the U.S. Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996 and the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2005. In the same year he released , an opera in three acts translated from Étienne and Nadine Roda-Gils' libretto about the French Revolution. Later that year, he reunited with Pink Floyd bandmates Mason, Wright and David Gilmour for the Live 8 global awareness event; it was the group's first appearance with Waters since 1981. He has toured extensively as a solo act since 1999 and played The Dark Side of the Moon in its entirety for his world tour of 2006–2008. In 2010, he began The Wall Live and in 2011 Gilmour and Mason appeared with him during a performance of the double-album in London. As of 2017, the tour is the highest-grossing of all time by a solo artist.|$|E

25|$|A {{drinking}} water standard of 0.05mg/L (equal to 50 parts per billion, or ppb) arsenic was originally {{established in the}} United States by the Public Health Service in 1942. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) studied the <b>pros</b> <b>and</b> <b>cons</b> <b>of</b> lowering the arsenic Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL) for years in the late 1980s and 1990s. No action was taken until January 2001, when the Clinton administration in its final weeks promulgated a new standard of 0.01mg/L (10 ppb) to take effect January 2006. The Bush administration suspended the midnight regulation, but after some months of study, the new EPA administrator Christine Todd Whitman approved the new 10 ppb arsenic standard and its original effective date of January 2006. Many locations exceed this limit. A 2017 Lancet Public Health study found that this rule change led to fewer cancer deaths.|$|E

25|$|A {{good example}} that {{highlights}} the <b>pros</b> <b>and</b> <b>cons</b> <b>of</b> using dynamic arrays vs. linked lists is by implementing {{a program that}} resolves the Josephus problem. The Josephus problem is an election method that works by having {{a group of people}} stand in a circle. Starting at a predetermined person, you count around the circle n times. Once you reach the nth person, take them out of the circle and have the members close the circle. Then count around the circle the same n times and repeat the process, until only one person is left. That person wins the election. This shows {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} a linked list vs. a dynamic array, because if you view the people as connected nodes in a circular linked list then it shows how easily the linked list is able to delete nodes (as it only has to rearrange the links to the different nodes). However, the linked list will be poor at finding the next person to remove and will need to search through the list until it finds that person. A dynamic array, on the other hand, will be poor at deleting nodes (or elements) as it cannot remove one node without individually shifting all the elements up the list by one. However, it is exceptionally easy to find the nth person in the circle by directly referencing them by their position in the array.|$|E
