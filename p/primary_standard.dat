5|$|Ceria is {{the most}} widely used {{compound}} of cerium. The main application of ceria is as a polishing compound, for example in chemical-mechanical planarization (CMP). In this application, ceria has replaced other metal oxides for the production of high-quality optical surfaces. Major automotive applications for the lower sesquioxide are as a catalytic converter for the oxidation of CO and NOx emissions in the exhaust gases from motor vehicles, Cerium(IV) sulfate is used as an oxidising agent in quantitative analysis. Cerium(IV) in methanesulfonic acid solutions is applied in industrial scale electrosynthesis as a recyclable oxidant. Ceric ammonium nitrate is used as an oxidant in organic chemistry and in etching electronic components, and as a <b>primary</b> <b>standard</b> for quantitative analysis.|$|E

It is also used as a <b>primary</b> <b>standard</b> for acid-base titrations because it is solid and air-stable, making it easy to weigh accurately.|$|E

25|$|To take a {{scientific}} measurement with a microphone, its precise sensitivity must be known (in volts per pascal).

This service is offered by some microphone manufacturers and by independent certified testing labs. All microphone calibration is ultimately traceable to primary standards at a national measurement institute such as NPL in the UK, PTB in Germany and NIST in the United States, which most commonly calibrate using the reciprocity <b>primary</b> <b>standard.</b> Measurement microphones calibrated using this method can then be used to calibrate other microphones using comparison calibration techniques.|$|E
