5|$|The {{early signs}} of AML are often vague and nonspecific, and may be {{similar to those of}} {{influenza}} or other common illnesses. Some generalized symptoms include fever, fatigue, weight loss or loss of appetite, shortness of breath, anemia, easy bruising or bleeding, <b>petechiae</b> (flat, pin-head sized spots under the skin caused by bleeding), bone and joint pain, and persistent or frequent infections.|$|E

50|$|The {{yellow warbler}} (Setophaga <b>petechia,</b> {{formerly}} Dendroica <b>petechia)</b> is a New World warbler species. Sensu lato, {{they make up}} the most widespread species in the diverse Setophaga genus, breeding in almost the whole of North America and down to northern South America.|$|R

5|$|In the early, or {{fulminating}} form, hemorrhaging {{appears on}} {{the second or third}} day as sub-conjunctival bleeding turns the whites of the eyes deep red. Hemorrhagic smallpox also produces a dusky erythema, <b>petechiae,</b> and hemorrhages in the spleen, kidney, serosa, muscle, and, rarely, the epicardium, liver, testes, ovaries and bladder. Death often occurs suddenly between the fifth and seventh days of illness, when only a few insignificant skin lesions are present. A later form of the disease occurs in patients who survive for 8–10 days. The hemorrhages appear in the early eruptive period, and the rash is flat and does not progress beyond the vesicular stage. Patients in the early stage of disease show a decrease in coagulation factors (e.g. platelets, prothrombin, and globulin) and an increase in circulating antithrombin. Patients in the late stage have significant thrombocytopenia; however, deficiency of coagulation factors is less severe. Some in the late stage also show increased antithrombin. This form of smallpox occurs in anywhere from 3 to 25 percent of fatal cases depending on the virulence of the smallpox strain. Hemorrhagic smallpox is usually fatal.|$|E
25|$|Painless, {{round and}} {{pinpoint}} (1 to 3mm in diameter) <b>petechiae</b> usually appear and fade, and sometimes group to form ecchymoses. Larger than <b>petechiae,</b> ecchymoses are purple, blue or yellow-green areas of skin that vary {{in size and}} shape. They can occur anywhere on the body.|$|E
25|$|Some (<10%) are {{diagnosed}} during the accelerated stage which most often presents bleeding, <b>petechiae</b> and ecchymosis. In these patients fevers are most commonly {{the result of}} opportunistic infections.|$|E

Culmen length and body mass were also significantly different between Galapagos and North American populations of D. <b>petechia.</b> Morphological differences among island populations of D. p. aureola {{may be related to}} resource variability and the presence of different bird species on different islands...|$|R
25|$|Damage to {{the bone}} marrow, by way of {{displacing}} the normal bone marrow cells with higher numbers of immature white blood cells, results in a lack of blood platelets, which are important in the blood clotting process. This means people with leukemia may easily become bruised, bleed excessively, or develop pinprick bleeds (<b>petechiae).</b>|$|E
25|$|A {{plantar wart}} {{is a small}} lesion that appears {{on the surface of}} the skin and {{typically}} resembles a cauliflower, with tiny black <b>petechiae</b> (tiny hemorrhages under the skin) in the center. Pinpoint bleeding may occur when these are scratched. Plantar warts occur on the soles of feet and toes. They may be painful when standing or walking.|$|E
25|$|Thrombocytopenia {{usually has}} no {{symptoms}} and {{is picked up}} on a routine full blood count (or complete blood count). Some individuals with thrombocytopenia may experience external bleeding such as nosebleeds, and/or bleeding gums. Some women may have heavier or longer periods or breakthrough bleeding. Bruising, particularly purpura in the forearms and <b>petechiae</b> in the feet, legs, and mucous membranes, {{may be caused by}} spontaneous bleeding under the skin.|$|E
50|$|The scaly-breasted thrasher (Allenia fusca) {{may have}} become extirpated from the Island. A {{resident}} race of the yellow warbler (Dendroica <b>petechia</b> <b>petechia)</b> is also threatened, mostly due to loss of its mangrove swamp habitat; the last major refuge for this species is the Graeme Hall Swamp {{in the south of}} the Island, However some reports suggest the species is expanding its range on the island.|$|R
50|$|The 35 {{subspecies}} of D. <b>petechia</b> {{sensu lato}} {{can be divided}} into three main groups according to the males head color in the breeding season. Each of these groups is sometimes considered a separate species, or the aestiva group (yellow warbler) is considered a species different from D. <b>petechia</b> (mangrove warbler, including golden warbler); the latter option is the one currently accepted by the International Ornithological Congress World Bird List.|$|R

25|$|Signs {{include the}} {{spontaneous}} formation of bruises (purpura) and <b>petechiae</b> (tiny bruises), {{especially on the}} extremities, bleeding from the nostrils and/or gums, and menorrhagia (excessive menstrual bleeding), any of which may occur if the platelet count is below 20,000 per μl. A very low count (<10,000 per μl) may result in the spontaneous formation of hematomas (blood masses) in the mouth or on other mucous membranes. Bleeding time from minor lacerations or abrasions is usually prolonged.|$|E
25|$|In {{the absence}} of {{fracture}} and dislocation, occlusion of blood vessels becomes the major cause of death, rather than asphyxiation. Obstruction of venous drainage of the brain via occlusion of the internal jugular veins leads to cerebral oedema and then cerebral ischemia. The face will typically become engorged and cyanotic (turned blue through lack of oxygen). There will be the classic sign of strangulation, <b>petechiae,</b> little blood marks on the face and in the eyes from burst blood capillaries. The tongue may protrude.|$|E
25|$|A {{person with}} this disease may also {{complain}} of malaise, fatigue and general weakness (with or without accompanying blood loss). Acquired thrombocytopenia {{may be associated}} with a history of drug use. Inspection typically reveals evidence of bleeding (<b>petechiae</b> or ecchymoses), along with slow, continuous bleeding from any injuries or wounds. Adults may have large, blood-filled bullae in the mouth. If the person's platelet count is between 30,000 and 50,000/mm3, bruising with minor trauma may be expected; if it is between 15,000 and 30,000/mm3, spontaneous bruising will be seen (mostly on the arms and legs).|$|E
5000|$|The genus name Setophaga is from Ancient Greek ses, [...] "moth", and phagos, [...] "eating", and the {{specific}} <b>petechia</b> is from Italian petecchia, a small red spot on the skin.|$|R
5000|$|The {{yellow warbler}} (Setophaga <b>petechia)</b> is {{a species of}} warbler living in most of North America who is {{completely}} yellow other than a few red streaks on the breast and head in males.|$|R
50|$|A {{presumptive}} diagnosis {{can be made}} based on the history and clinical signs. Definitive diagnosis is achieved by direct or indirect fluorescent antibody testing (FAT), PCR, post mortem (signs include <b>petechia</b> and pulmonary congestion), histopathology or electron microscopy.|$|R
25|$|Compromise of the {{cerebral}} blood flow may occur by obstruction of the carotid arteries, even though their obstruction requires far more force than the obstruction of jugular veins, since they are seated deeper and they contain blood in much higher pressure compared to the jugular veins. Where death has occurred through carotid artery obstruction or cervical fracture, the face will typically be pale in colour and not show <b>petechiae.</b> Many reports and pictures exist of actual short-drop hangings that seem {{to show that the}} person died quickly, while others indicate a slow and agonising death by strangulation.|$|E
25|$|Early {{symptoms}} are malaise and lethargy. Even earlier {{might be a}} pain in {{a section of the}} gums which interferes with digestion. After 1–3 months, patients develop shortness of breath and bone pain. Myalgias may occur because of reduced carnitine production. Other symptoms include skin changes with roughness, easy bruising and <b>petechiae,</b> gum disease, loosening of teeth, poor wound healing, and emotional changes (which may appear before any physical changes). Dry mouth and dry eyes similar to Sjögren's syndrome may occur. In the late stages, jaundice, generalized edema, oliguria, neuropathy, fever, convulsions, and eventual death are frequently seen.|$|E
25|$|In some cases, {{internal}} and external bleeding may occur. This typically begins five to seven days after the first symptoms. All infected people show some decreased blood clotting. Bleeding from mucous membranes or from sites of needle punctures {{has been reported in}} 40–50 percent of cases. This may cause vomiting blood, coughing up of blood, or blood in stool. Bleeding into the skin may create <b>petechiae,</b> purpura, ecchymoses or hematomas (especially around needle injection sites). Bleeding into the whites of the eyes may also occur. Heavy bleeding is uncommon; if it occurs, it is usually located within the gastrointestinal tract.|$|E
5000|$|Bruising {{more easily}} {{due to a}} drop in {{platelets}} - you may have nosebleeds or bleeding gums after brushing your teeth. Or you may have lots of tiny red spots or bruises on your arms or legs (known as <b>petechia)</b> ...|$|R
50|$|It {{is used to}} {{determine}} whether a lesion is vascular (inflammatory or congenital), nonvascular (nevus), or hemorrhagic (<b>petechia</b> or purpura). Hemorrhagic lesions and nonvascular lesions do not blanch("negative diascopy"); inflammatory lesions do("positive diascopy"). Diascopy is sometimes used to identify sarcoid skin lesions, which, when tested, turn an apple jelly color.|$|R
25|$|Gonorrhea if left {{untreated}} may last {{for weeks or}} months with higher risks of complications. One of the complications of gonorrhea is systemic dissemination resulting in skin pustules or <b>petechia,</b> septic arthritis, meningitis, or endocarditis. This occurs in between 0.6 and 3% of infected women and 0.4 and 0.7% of infected men.|$|R
25|$|The acute {{stage of}} the disease, {{occurring}} most often {{in the spring and}} summer, begins one to three weeks after infection and lasts for two to four weeks. Clinical signs include a fever, <b>petechiae,</b> bleeding disorders, vasculitis, lymphadenopathy, discharge from the nose and eyes, and edema of the legs and scrotum. There are no outward signs of the subclinical phase. Clinical signs of the chronic phase include weight loss, pale gums due to anemia, bleeding due to thrombocytopenia, vasculitis, lymphadenopathy, dyspnea, coughing, polyuria, polydipsia, lameness, ophthalmic diseases such as retinal hemorrhage and anterior uveitis, and neurological disease. Dogs that are severely affected can die from this disease.|$|E

500|$|The febrile phase {{involves}} high fever, potentially over , and {{is associated}} with generalized pain and a headache; this usually lasts two to seven days. Nausea and vomiting may also occur. A rash occurs in 50–80% of those with symptoms in {{the first or second}} day of symptoms as flushed skin, or later in the course of illness (days 4–7), as a measles-like rash. A rash described as [...] "islands of white in a sea of red" [...] has also been observed. Some <b>petechiae</b> (small red spots that do not disappear when the skin is pressed, which are caused by broken capillaries) can appear at this point, as may some mild bleeding from the mucous membranes of the mouth and nose. The fever itself is classically biphasic or saddleback in nature, breaking and then returning for one or two days.|$|E

40|$|A {{number of}} {{innocent}} rashes occurs in neonates. They are usually transient and self limited and thus require no therapy but early recognition {{is important to}} distinguish these lesions from more serious disorders. In this study, our purpose {{was to determine the}} frequency of birthmarks in Iranian neonates. The presence of various types of birthmarks was determined in 503 Iranian neonates under 72 hour of age. The physiological skin changes observed in order to frequency were Epstein pearls in 444 (88. 27 %), Mongolian spot in 409 (81 %), erythema toxicum in 272 (54 %), sucking blisters in 264 (52. 1 %), Salmon patch in 262 (52 %), milia in 232 (46 %), <b>petechia</b> in 41 (0. 08 %) and mottling in 29 (0. 06 %). <b>Petechia</b> was seen more commonly in vaginal delivery and in babies with more birth weight. Mottling was more common in premature and low birth babies.
