50|$|USA-243 was {{launched}} by United Launch Alliance. A Delta IV-M+(5,4) rocket, Delta 362, {{was used to}} place it into a supersynchronous transfer orbit, from which the spacecraft will be maneuvered into geostationary orbit. It {{was launched}} from Space Launch Complex 37B at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station at 00:27 UTC on 25 May 2013. A launch attempt 24 hours before was cancelled because of {{a problem with a}} helium <b>pressurization</b> <b>line.</b> The launch was successful.|$|E
40|$|Tests {{were made}} to {{evaluate}} the effects of lightning strikes on the shuttle external tank gaseous oxygen <b>pressurization</b> <b>line.</b> This line, designed to conduct gaseous oxygen may also act as a lightning conductor. Questions have been raised as to the potential hazard of this line as a lightning conductor with speculation as to the damage that might occur to the <b>pressurization</b> <b>line,</b> and the adjacent thermal protective surfaces, from a lightning strike. The region of investigation was from above the cone of the launch tower lightning protection to 15. 24 km (50, 000 ft) altitude. Tests were performed on samples of thin wall stainless steel tubing filled with gaseous oxygen under simulated flight conditions. No specimen malfunctions occurred when the tests were conducted according to JSC specifications. Based on the JSC specifications {{and the results of}} these tests, it is concluded that a lightning strike will not cause a malfunction of the shuttle external tank gaseous oxygen line made of the representative material tested...|$|E
25|$|In 2005, {{the problem}} of foam shed had not been fully cured; on STS-114, {{additional}} cameras mounted on the tank recorded a piece of foam separated from one of its Protuberance Air Load (PAL) ramps, which are designed to prevent unsteady air flow underneath the tank’s cable trays and <b>pressurization</b> <b>lines</b> during ascent. The PAL ramps consist of manually sprayed layers of foam, {{and are more likely}} to become a source of debris. That piece of foam did not impact the orbiter.|$|R
40|$|A {{transient}} {{model of}} the propulsion test article (PTA) helium pressurization system was developed using the generalized fluid system simulation program (GFSSP). The model included <b>pressurization</b> <b>lines</b> from the facility interface to the engine purge interface and liquid oxygen (lox) and rocket propellant– 1 (RP– 1) tanks, the propellant tanks themselves including ullage space, and propellant feed lines to their respective pump interfaces. GFSSP’s capability was extended to model a control valve to maintain ullage pressure within a specified limit and pressurization processes such as heat transfer between ullage gas, propellant, and the tank wall as well as conduction in the tank wall. The purpose of the model is to predict the flow system characteristics in the entire pressurization system during 80 sec of lower feed system priming, 420 sec of fuel and lox pump priming, and 150 sec of engine firing. 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{pressurization}} system of cryogenic propellant rockets requires on-board pressurant gas. The {{objective of this}} study was to analyze the influence of the pressurant gas temperature on the required pressurant gas mass in terms of lowering the launcher mass. First, ground experiments were performed in order to investigate the pressurization process with regard to the influence of the pressurant gas inlet temperature. Second, a system study for the cryogenic upper stage of a small Two Stage to Orbit (TSTO) launch vehicle was performed with focus on the influence of the pressurant gas temperature on the propellant management system mass. One important experimental result is that for evaporated propellant as pressurant gas, the maximum applicable gas temperature is best for reducing the needed pressurant gas, but on condition that all <b>pressurization</b> <b>lines</b> are chilled down. Moreover, the use of helium is very advantageous with regard to lowering the pressurant gas mass. Also significant is that an immediate pressure drop occurred after the pressurization end. The conclusion drawn from the system analysis is that an increased evaporated propellant and helium pressurant gas temperature resulted in a decrease of the total propellant management system mass, despite the application of external helium vessels...|$|R
40|$|A {{pressurization}} system model {{was developed for}} a crossfeed subscale water test article using the EASY 5 modeling software. The model consisted of an integrated tank pressurization and <b>pressurization</b> <b>line</b> model. The tank model was developed using the general purpose library, while the line model was assembled from the gas dynamic library. The {{pressurization system}} model was correlated to water test data obtained from nine test runs conducted on the crossfeed subscale test article. The model was first correlated to a representative test run and frozen. The correlated model was then used to predict the tank pressures and compared with the test data for eight other runs. The model prediction showed excellent agreement with the test data, allowing it {{to be used in}} a later study to analyze the pressurization system performance of a full-scale bimese vehicle with cryogenic propellants...|$|E
40|$|Following the Challenger tragedy, an {{evaluation}} of the integrated main propulsion system flight data revealed a premature decay in the hydrogen external tank ullage pressure. A reconstruction of predicted ullage pressure versus time indicated an inconsistency between predicted and measured ullage pressure starting at approximately 65. 5 seconds into the flight and reaching a maximum value between 72 and 72. 9 seconds. This discrepancy could have been caused by a hydrogen gas leak or by a liquied hydrogen leak that occurred either in the pressurization system or in the external tank. The corresponding leak rates over the time interval from 65. 5 to 72. 9 seconds were estimated to range from 0. 28 kg/s (0. 62 lbm/s) + or - 41 percent to between 0. 43 and 0. 51 kg/s (0. 94 and 1. 12 lbs/s) + or - 1 percent for a gas leak and from 72. 9 kg/s (160. 5 lbs/s) + or - 41 percent to between 111. 6 and 133. 2 kg/s (245. 8 and 293. 3 lbs/s) + or - 1 percent for a liquid leak. No speculation is made to ascertain whether the leak is liquid or gas, as this cannot be determined from the analysis performed. Four structural failures in the hydrogen external tank were considered to explain the leak rates. A break in the 5 -cm (2 in) <b>pressurization</b> <b>line,</b> in the 13 -cm (5 in) vent line, or in the 43 -cm (17 in) feedline is not likely. A break in the 10 -cm (4 in) recirculation line with a larger structural failure occurring in the 72 to 73 -second time period, the time of the visibly identified premature pressure decay, does seem plausible and the most likely of the four modes considered. These modes are not all-inclusive and do not preclude the possibility of a leak elsewhere in the tank...|$|E
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} in unlimited. The effects of hydrostatic {{pressure on the}} mechanical properties of 1 / 4 inch polypropylene line were investigated. The line was exposed to hydrostatic pressures of 5, 000 and 10, 000 psi for periods of 6, 12, and 24 hours, respectively. Upon completion of the <b>pressurization</b> period, the <b>line</b> {{was removed from the}} pressure vessel and its ultimate tensile strength recorded and compared to that of the <b>line</b> before <b>pressurization.</b> There was an increase in the tensile strength of the line as pressure increased and time progressed, with a maximum increase of 3. 1 percent occurring after pressurization at 10, 000 psi for 12 hours and at 5, 000 psi for 24 hours. Secondly, there was no measurable difference in the relative elongation of the <b>line</b> after <b>pressurization</b> as compared to that before pressurization. The mode of failure was investigated by testing individual line fibers. Microscopic observation after failure showed no discernible difference between the mode of failure before and after pressurization. In each case, the fibers presented a somewhat jagged edge and the outer portions of the fiber appeared to have peeled back. [URL] United States Nav...|$|R
40|$|SPC {{performed}} {{analyses for}} Quad Cities Unit I Cycle 17 {{to determine the}} margin between peak steam line pressure and the lowest set point of the unpiped safety valves. ComEd adopts a limit of 60 psi margin for the main steam isolation valve closure- unpiped safety valve margin (MSIVC-USM) analysis. The load rejection no bypass- unpiped safety valve margin (LRNB USM) analysis was also performed. At EOFP the limiting initial conditions for steam <b>line</b> <b>pressurization</b> occur at 100 % core power and 87 % core flow (1 00 %P/ 87 %F). For coastdown conditions of EOFP+ 1500 MWd/MTU, the state point 100 %P/ 87 %F is unattainable; therefore, the limiting state point for EOFP+ 1 500 MWd/MTU is 1 00 %P/ 1 00 %F. The lowest nominal set point for a Quad Cities unpiped safety valve is 1254. 7 psia. Because the unpiped safety valve margin analyses are not licensing analyses, some of the conservatism normally assumed in COTRANSA 2 analyses is relaxed. The MSIVC-USM analysis with direct scram results in a fairly mild reactor pressurization. The relief valves have sufficient capacity to depressurize the reactor once the valves actuate. The MSIVC-USM analyses with direct scram were performed with plant-specific scram insertion from Section 8. 6 of Reference A. 1. Technical specification relief valve (RV) opening times and delays were use...|$|R
