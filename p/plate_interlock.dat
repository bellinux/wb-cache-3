40|$|Two new genera, Gedoelstascaris and Ortleppascaris, are {{proposed}} for species of ascaridoid nematodes occurring in crocodilians and previously included in Dujardinascaris. Species included in Gedoelstascaris are vandenbrandeni Baylis, 1929 as type species and australiensis Baylis, 1931 (= salomonis Kreis, 1940). These species occur in Crocodylus spp. in Africa and Australia respectively and are characterised by lips with a rostral <b>plate,</b> without <b>interlocking</b> processes or dentigerous ridges, with well-developed interlabia, lobulated ventriculus, and excretory pore {{in front of}} the nerve ring. Species included in Ortleppascaris are: nigra Gedoelst, 1916 (= tasmani Ortlepp, 1932) as type species; alata Baylis, 1947; antipini Mozgovoy, 1950. These species occur in Crocodylus, Caiman and Alligator and are characterized by flat lips with alate margins, without anterior rostral <b>plate,</b> <b>interlocking</b> processes or dentigerous ridges, with weakly developed interlabia, by an irregular-shaped ventriculus, excretory pore behind or between the subventral lips, and by the presence of lateral alae or cuticular thickenings in the oesophageal region.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The aim of {{this article}} was to {{determine}} the effects of minimally invasive percutaneous <b>plates</b> versus <b>interlocking</b> intramedullary nailing in the treatment of tibial shaft fractures in adults. METHOD: Literature searches of the Cochrane Library, PubMed, EMBASE, the Chinese Biomedical Literature database, the CNKI database, Wanfang Data, and the Weipu Journal database were performed up to August 2013. Only randomized and quasi-randomized controlled clinical trials comparing the use of percutaneous <b>plates</b> and <b>interlocking</b> intramedullary nails for tibial shaft fractures were included. Data collection and extraction, quality assessment, and data analyses were performed according to the Cochrane standards. RESULTS: Eleven trials were included. Compared with interlocking intramedullary nailing, minimally invasive percutaneous plates shortened fracture healing time and resulted in lower rates of postoperative delayed union and pain. There was no significant difference between the two methods with regard to the rates of excellent and good Johner-Wruh scoring, the rate of reoperation, and other complications. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, insufficient evidence exists regarding the effects of minimally invasive percutaneous <b>plates</b> versus <b>interlocking</b> intramedullary nailing in the treatment of tibial shaft fractures in adults. Low-quality evidence suggests that minimally invasive percutaneous plates could shorten fracture healing time, decrease the rate of postoperative delayed union, and decrease pain levels compared with interlocking intramedullary nailing. There is no significant difference between the two groups in terms of functional recovery scores, reoperation, and other complications. Further research that includes high-quality randomized controlled, multicenter trials is required to compare the effects of minimally invasive percutaneous <b>plates</b> versus <b>interlocking</b> intramedullary nailing in the treatment of tibial shaft fractures in adults...|$|R

30|$|There is {{a growing}} {{interest}} in treating even simple humeral shaft fractures by surgical modalities {{in order to avoid}} these problems and to allow earlier mobilization and rapid return to work [11, 12]. The usual operative methods involve the use of dynamic compression <b>plate</b> (DCP) or <b>interlocking</b> nail (ILN). <b>Plate</b> and screw fixation has traditionally been the preferred method and remains the gold standard for surgical management [13]. Use of the plate, however, requires extensive dissection and is complicated by the proximity of the radial nerve and the risk of mechanical failure in osteopenic bone. As a result of recent technical advances and success associated with nailing in other long bone fractures, there {{is a growing}} interest {{in the use of the}} humeral intramedullary nail for treating this fracture. ILN is a less invasive procedure with improved biomechanics and load-sharing feature of the implant. Fractures managed with ILN have better chances of union, as the surgery does not involve periosteal stripping and reaming produces act as an autograft. This benefit, however, comes at the cost of shoulder problems. We hypothesized that fractures managed by interlocking nailing would have faster union rates, less surgical time, shorter hospital stay, but more shoulder problems.|$|R

Materials and Methods: This prospective study was conducted {{over a period of}} three years on sixty patients with closed acute humeral shaft fracture requiring operative interventions. Results: Forty percent of cases were in the age group 31 - 40 years with males outnumbering females. Motor vehicle accidents (63. 3 %) were most frequent cause. Right humerus was more frequently (66. 6 %) involved. Maximum patients (40 %) were operated within 4 - 6 days after injury. Out of 30 patients of plate group complications were: Infection- 6. 6 %; delayed union- 13. 3 %; shoulder movement restriction- 13. 3 %; elbow movement restriction- 6. 6 %. Out of 30 patients of nail group complications were: Splintering of fracture end- 6. 6 %; infection- 6. 6 %; delayed union- 26. 6 %; shoulder movement restriction- 13. 3 %; elbow movement restriction- 6. 6 %; shoulder pain- 46. 6 %. Maximum number of fractures (73. 3 % in plating group and 60 % in nailing group) clinically united in the interval of 11 - 13 weeks.

A retrospective review was conducted of patients from one institution using the volar locking plate to treat intra-articular and extra-articular distal radius fractures. Unstable distal radius fractures in 15 patients, comprising 3 men and 12 women {{with a mean age of}} 64. 4 years (34 – 76 years), were treated with a volar locking compression plate (Acu-Loc distal radius plate system; Acumed, Oregon, USA) and followed up for a minimum of 1 year. Fractures were classified using the AO classification. Radiographic parameters of preoperative, postoperative, and final follow-up radiographs were compared. The time to initiation of active range of motion was determined. Final follow-up range of motion and complications were reported. Results. At final functional assessment, the scores of 5 patients were excellent, 7 patients good, and 3 patients fair according to Cooney’s Clinical Scoring Chart. No non-union or infection occurred.

50|$|The tail of Sauropelta was {{characteristically}} {{long and}} made up {{nearly half of the}} body length. One skeleton preserved forty caudal (tail) vertebrae, although some were missing, suggesting that the true number of caudal vertebrae may have exceeded fifty. Ossified tendons stiffened the tail along its length. Like other ankylosaurs, Sauropelta had a wide body, with a very broad pelvis and ribcage. The forelimbs were shorter than the hindlimbs, which resulted in an arched back, with the highest point over the hips. Its feet, limbs, shoulders, and pelvis were all very stoutly constructed and reinforced to support a great deal of weight. American paleontologist Ken Carpenter estimated the mass of S. edwardsorum at 1,500 kilograms (3,300 lb). Like other nodosaurids, Sauropelta was covered in armor formed from bony masses embedded in the skin (osteoderms). The discovery of a skeleton with the body armor preserved in situ allowed Carpenter and other scientists to accurately describe this protection. Two parallel rows of domed scutes ran down the top of the neck, along the anteroposterior axis (front to back).

Biomechanical parameters including range of motion (RoM), neutral zone (NZ), and elastic zone stiffness (EZS) were used to compare the stability of the two fixation techniques. No significant difference between the means of the NZ in flexion (p-value= 0. 3458), extension (pvalue= 0. 1255), and the total value (p-value = 0. 3458) of the injured lumbosacral (L 7 -S 1) joint fixated with the two fixation techniques was found.

40|$|Introduction & Objective: Jaundice is {{the most}} {{clinical}} finding in the neonatal period. Prolonged indirect fractures of the shaft of the femur {{are among the most}} common fractures encountered in orthopedic practice. Since the femur is the largest bone of the body and one of the principal loads bearing bone in the lower extremity, fractures can cause prolonged morbidity and extensive disability unless treatment is appropriate. In the recent years interlocking intramedullary nailing has become the technique of choice which decreases the complications and the duration of morbidity. In our country no study has bean achieved to compare this technique and traditional plating method. The aim of our study was to compare the time needed for fracture union of these two techniques. Materials & Methods: This study was a prospective clinical trial. 48 cases were randomly divided in two groups and were undergone <b>plating</b> method and <b>interlocking</b> intramedullary nailing. The groups were followed for bone union for at least one year. The information were analyzed by statistical exams (t-test, chi square, Cox regression, Kaplan meier) Results: Interlocking intramedullary nailing technique group showed a decreased union time (14. 4 weeks) compared with plating technique (19. 6 weeks) (P< 0. 001). The union time in open fracture in two groups were significantly increased (P< 0. 02). Conclusion: Interlocking technique is seriously recommended for treatment of femur shaft fractures because of decreased fracture union time and rapid rehabilitation and providing the facility for this technique is cost effective for all orthopedic surgery centers...|$|R
