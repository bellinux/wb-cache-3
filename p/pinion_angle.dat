5000|$|Because of the GTO's late {{introduction}} (some {{three-fourths of}} the way through the model year) and the ambiguous nature - technically a violation of GM policy limiting intermediates to 330 CID, although the 1963 Pontiac Tempest/LeMans had already done this in 1963, and even though badged as a 326 the 63 Tempest V-8 was already at 336 CID, 1964 it became a true 326. - the Olds offering was a conservative package. Technically the [...] "B09 Police Apprehender Pursuit" [...] option, it used the four-barrel carbureted 330 CID (5.4 L) V8 with heavy-duty valve gear, and a hotter camshaft, raising rated (SAE gross) output to 310 hp (231.3 kW) at 5200 rpm. Torque remained 355 lbft Nm, although the torque peak rose from 2800 rpm to 3600 rpm. Also included was a stiffened frame, adjustable <b>pinion</b> <b>angle</b> by way of added holes in the frame mounts for the rear upper control arms, Muncie four-speed manual transmission, a heavy duty drive shaft connected to a 3.36:1 rear end, oversized brakes(155.6 vs 118sq.in lining area) and the heavy-duty police-package suspension, with heavy duty wheels, higher-rate coil springs front and rear, heavy-duty shock absorbers, a larger front anti-roll bar, an additional rear anti-roll bar bolted to a fully boxed lower control arm, and dual snorkel air cleaner. Two-speed windshield wipers, A/C ($430), an AM/FM radio, an electronic trunk opener, and a tilt steering wheel ($43) were optional. [...] Unlike the 1965 4-4-2 model built in Lansing, the 1964 4-4-2 does not have an option code on the data plate. There is documentation available showing that the 1964 4-4-2 was built in both Lansing and Fremont.|$|E
30|$|Even {{though the}} 20 ° {{pressure}} <b>angle</b> <b>pinion</b> have many practical advantages {{such as it}} {{reduces the risk of}} undercut, it has greater length of contact and stronger at root, it is evident from Figure  2 that because of more sharp and weaker at the tip when compared to the modified pinion (15 ° pressure <b>angle)</b> the traditional <b>pinion</b> (20 ° pressure angle) undergone breakage of tooth only at the tip portion in all the cases.|$|R
30|$|The study infers {{that the}} 15 ° {{pressure}} <b>angle</b> <b>pinion</b> (contact ratio 3.117) is a superior choice for slow speed stage of gearbox {{used in the}} wind turbine generator. Here the author’s recommendation to avoid frequent pinion failure is that instead of using 20 ° pressure angle gear pair in both slow speed and high speed stage the traditional gear pair (20 ° pressure angle) having contact ratio 2.948 can be used only at high speed stage as the high-pressure angle gears are most efficient when operated in the high speed.|$|R
30|$|It {{is obvious}} from Table  7 {{that only the}} pinions having 15 ° {{pressure}} angle with 0.002 mm tip relief and 20 ° pressure angle with 0.002 mm tip relief are experiencing lesser bending stress than Lewis maximum bending stress. Among the two models, low pressure <b>angle</b> helical <b>pinion</b> (15 ° pressure angle with 0.002 mm tip relief) running at slow speed(509.2 rpm) provide improved performance with lesser bending stress (145.588 N/mm 2) over more traditional 20 ° pressure <b>angle</b> <b>pinion</b> (236.606 N/mm 2). This was verified through ANSYS analysis.|$|R

The further from {{the intersection of the}} gear and pinion axes, the bigger the tooth cross sections are. If the tooth face were to extend {{all the way to the}} axes intersection, the teeth would approach infinitesimal size there. The tooth cross-section at the largest part of the tooth is identical to the tooth cross-section of a tooth from a spur gear with Pitch Diameter of 2* rb, or twice the Back-Cone Radius, and with an imaginary number of teeth (N’) equal to [...] times the Back-Cone Radius (rb) divided by the Circular Pitch of the bevel gear (p). This method of obtaining the dimensions and shape of the largest tooth profile is known as the “Tredgold” tooth-shape approximation. Refer to the profiles shown near the Back-cone radius dimension in the drawing above.Mean radius: ...|$|R
40|$|The general {{procedure}} for synthesizing the {{rack and pinion}} mechanism up to seven precision conditions is developed. To illustrate the method, the mechanism has been synthesized in closed form for three precision conditions of path generation, two positions of function generation, and a velocity condition {{at one of the}} precision points. This mechanism has a number of advantages over conventional four bar mechanisms. First, since the rack is always tangent to the <b>pinion,</b> the transmission <b>angle</b> is always 90 deg minus the pressure angle of the rack. Second, with both translation and rotation of the rack occurring, multiple outputs are available. Other advantages include the generation of monotonic functions {{for a wide variety of}} motion and nonmonotonic functions for a full range of motion as well as nonlinear amplified motions. In this work the mechanism is made to satisfy a number of practical design requirements such as completely rotatable input crank and others. By including the velocity specification, the designer has considerably more control of the output motion. The method of solution developed in this work uses the complex number method of mechanism synthesis. A numerical example is included...|$|R
40|$|A design {{procedure}} for sizing standard involute spur gearsets is presented. The procedure {{is applied to}} find the optimal design for two examples - an external gear mesh with a ratio of 5 : 1 and an internal gear mesh with a ratio of 5 : 1. In the procedure, the gear mesh is designed to minimize the center distance for a given gear ratio, pressure <b>angle,</b> <b>pinion</b> torque, and allowable tooth strengths. From the methodology presented, a design space may be formulated for either external gear contact or for internal contact. The design space includes kinematics considerations of involute interference, tip fouling, and contact ratio. Also included are design constraints based on bending fatigue in the pinion fillet and Hertzian contact pressure in the full load region and at the gear tip where scoring is possible. This design space is two dimensional, giving the gear mesh center distance {{as a function of}} diametral pitch and the number of pinion teeth. The constraint equations were identified for kinematic interference, fillet bending fatigue, pitting fatigue, and scoring pressure, which define the optimal design space for a given gear design. The locus of equal size optimum designs was identified as the straight line through the origin which has the least slope in the design region...|$|R

The bending stresses were examined using three-dimensional finite element model [...] These stresses of different modules obtained from the finite element analysis were compared and the considerable reduction of weight occurred was found and also the values are compared with the theoretical values. Both results agree very well. This indicates that the finite element method model is accurate.
