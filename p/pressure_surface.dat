In the mountainous terrain of the western United States and Mexican Plateau, the 850 hPa <b>pressure</b> <b>surface</b> can be a more realistic depiction of the weather pattern than a standard surface analysis. Using the 850 and 700 hPa pressure surfaces, one can determine when and where warm advection (coincident with upward vertical motion) and cold advection (coincident with downward vertical motion) is occurring within the lower portions of the troposphere. Areas with small dewpoint depressions and are below freezing indicate the presence of icing conditions for aircraft.

5|$|A {{weather map}} {{displays}} various meteorological features across {{a particular area}} at a particular point in time and has various symbols which all have specific meanings. Such maps have been in use since the mid-19th century and are used for research and weather forecasting purposes. Maps using isotherms show temperature gradients, which can help locate weather fronts. Isotach maps, analyzing lines of equal wind speed, on a constant <b>pressure</b> <b>surface</b> of 300 or 250hPa show where the jet stream is located. Use of constant pressure charts at the 700 and 500hPa level can indicate tropical cyclone motion. Two-dimensional streamlines based on wind speeds at various levels show areas of convergence and divergence in the wind field, which are helpful in determining the location of features within the wind pattern. A popular type of surface weather map is the surface weather analysis, which plots isobars to depict areas of high pressure and low pressure. Cloud codes are translated into symbols and plotted on these maps along with other meteorological data that are included in synoptic reports sent by professionally trained observers.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Cosme caused {{flooding}} {{along the}} Pacific coast of Mexico in June2013. The third named tropical cyclone of the 2013 Pacific hurricane season, the storm system formed from a tropical wave south of Manzanillo, Colima, on June23. The cyclone intensified into {{a tropical storm}} on June24, and soon after strengthened into a hurricane on June25. Early the following day, Cosme attained its peak intensity as a Category1 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson scale with maximum sustained winds of 85mph (140km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 980mbar (hPa; 28.94inHg). However, Cosme then began to encounter stable air and lower sea surface temperatures, causing the system to weaken to a tropical storm late on June26. The system continued to weaken and degenerated into a remnant low <b>pressure</b> <b>surface</b> trough about 690mi (1,110km) west-southwest of Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, on June27.

5|$|On the {{top right}} corner of the model for a surface weather map is the {{pressure}}, showing the last two integer digits of the pressure in millibars, or hectopascals, along with the first decimal. For instance, if the pressure at a certain location is 999.7hPa, the pressure portion of the station model will read 997. Although the first digit or two of the pressure is left off, other nearby stations give away whether the pressure starts with a 10 or a 9. Most of the time, choosing first digits that would lead to a value nearest to 1000 works out best.

500|$|In deserts, lack {{of ground}} and plant {{moisture}} {{that would normally}} provide evaporative cooling can lead to intense, rapid solar heating of the lower layers of air. The hot air is less dense than surrounding cooler air. This, combined with the rising of the hot air, results in a low pressure area called a thermal low. [...] Over elevated surfaces, heating of the ground exceeds the heating of the surrounding air at the same altitude above sea level, which creates an associated heat low over the terrain and enhances any thermal lows which would have otherwise existed. [...] During the cold season, (winter), warm water bodies such as the Great Lakes can induce an instability low. [...] Thermal lows which develop near sea level can build in height during the warm season, or summer, to the elevation of the 700 hPa <b>pressure</b> <b>surface,</b> which lies near [...] above sea level. [...] Heat lows normally are stationary and have a weak cyclonic circulation. [...] As they are strongest at the surface and warm near their center, and weaker aloft where the air is more stable, the thermal low is considered warm core. [...] The strongest versions of these features globally are over Arabia, the northern portion of the Indian subcontinent, Arizona, Mexican plateau, northwest Argentina, southwestern Spain, Australia, and northern Africa. [...] The formation of the heat low over northern Africa leads to a low-level westerly jet stream from June into October.|$|E
500|$|Because of {{the forces}} that affect {{tropical}} cyclone tracks, accurate track predictions depend on determining the position and strength of high- and low-pressure areas, and predicting how those areas will change during {{the life of a}} tropical system. The deep layer mean flow, or average wind through the depth of the troposphere, is considered the best tool in determining track direction and speed. If storms are significantly sheared, use of wind speed measurements at a lower altitude, such as at the 70kPa <b>pressure</b> <b>surface</b> ( [...] above sea level) will produce better predictions. Tropical forecasters also consider smoothing out short-term [...] of the storm as it allows them to determine a more accurate long-term trajectory. High-speed computers and sophisticated simulation software allow forecasters to produce computer models that predict tropical cyclone tracks based on the future position and strength of high- and low-pressure systems. Combining forecast models with increased understanding {{of the forces}} that act on tropical cyclones, as well as with a wealth of data from Earth-orbiting satellites and other sensors, scientists have increased the accuracy of track forecasts over recent decades. However, scientists are not as skillful at predicting the intensity of tropical cyclones. The lack of improvement in intensity forecasting is attributed to the complexity of tropical systems and an incomplete understanding of factors that affect their development. [...] New tropical cyclone position and forecast information is available at least every twelve hours in the Southern Hemisphere and at least every six hours in the Northern Hemisphere from Regional Specialized Meteorological Centers and Tropical Cyclone Warning Centers.|$|E
