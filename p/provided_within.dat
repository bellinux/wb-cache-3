5|$|Video {{output is}} through an RF {{modulator}} and {{was designed for}} use with contemporary television sets, for a simple colour graphic display. Text can be displayed using 32columns × 24rows of characters from the ZX Spectrum character set or from a set <b>provided</b> <b>within</b> an application, from a palette of 15 shades: seven colours at two levels of brightness each, plus black. The image resolution is 256×192 with the same colour limitations. To conserve memory, colour is stored separate from the pixel bitmap in a low resolution, 32×24 grid overlay, corresponding to the character cells. In practice, this means that all pixels of an 8x8 character block share one foreground colour and one background colour.|$|E

25|$|The metre {{gauge station}} at Visp was {{originally}} located, as at Brig, in the forecourt of the SBB station building. South {{of the two}} metre gauge platform tracks {{there used to be}} a connection to the extensive depot and workshop facilities of the BVZ. For passenger traffic, the VZ had already erected a wooden shelter by the start of operations in 1890, and, even at that point, all of the other necessary facilities, such as toilets or a waiting hall, were <b>provided</b> <b>within</b> the standard gauge station building of the Jura-Simplon (until 1889, the Suisse Occidentale-Simplon).|$|E
25|$|The {{internet}} has dramatically empowered consumers and enabled {{buyers and sellers}} to come together with drastically reduced transaction and intermediary costs, creating much more robust marketplaces for the purchase and sale of goods and services. Examples include online auction sites, internet dating services, and internet book sellers. In many industries, the {{internet has}} dramatically altered the competitive landscape. Services {{that used to be}} <b>provided</b> <b>within</b> one entity (e.g., a car dealership providing financing and pricing information) are now provided by third parties. Further, compared to traditional media like television, the internet has caused a major shift in viewing habits through on demand content which has led to an increasingly fragmented audience.|$|E

25|$|In 2007, Toronto was {{reported}} as having {{some of the}} longer average ER wait times in Ontario. Toronto hospitals at the time employed a system of triage to ensure life-threatening injuries receive rapid treatment. After initial screening, initial assessments by physicians were completed within the waiting rooms themselves for greater efficiency, within a median of 1.2 hours. Tests, consultations, and initial treatments were also <b>provided</b> <b>within</b> waiting rooms. 50% of patients waited 4 hours before being transferred from the emergency room to another room. The least-urgent 10% of cases wait over 12 hours. The extended waiting-room times experienced by some patients were attributed to an overall shortage of acute care beds.|$|E
25|$|The rule {{of strict}} {{liability}} famously {{laid down by}} Blackburn J., in Rylands v. Fletcher, proved to be rather ineffective {{with the passage of}} time to counter the dangerous use of one’s property or an industry that produced substances or wastes detrimental to public health. The pre-requirements essential for establishing a liability under the principle of strict liability viz., the non-natural use of land, use of a dangerous thing, and the element of escape provided substantial loopholes to the enterprises to escape liability under the Rylands v. Fletcher rule. Moreover, the exceptions <b>provided</b> <b>within</b> the rule (and restated by the Supreme Court of India in MC Mehta v. Union of India) afford ample opportunity to the commercial enterprises to escape liability.|$|E
25|$|Biodiversity can {{be noticed}} around the campus, {{including}} {{a variety of}} species of birds, bats and insects. Habitats are also <b>provided</b> <b>within</b> areas such as The Grove, bounding the site to the north-east, comprising mature trees along the River Trent.

The university's commitment to biodiversity across all of its estates includes constant investigating into exactly what creatures share the campus with humans and how the environment can be enhanced to encourage numbers to increase, and to entice new wildlife to the campus. Future plans to help enhance biodiversity and manage the landscape have been made publicly available by the university in 2012.|$|E

25|$|The {{first decade}} of the 20th century saw other {{developments}} at Earl's Court station. On 30 June 1900 The Middle Circle service was withdrawn east of Earl's Court which became the terminus of the service until 31 January 1905 when the service was cut back again to terminate at Addison Road. On 15 December 1906, the Great Northern, Piccadilly and Brompton Railway (GNP, now the Piccadilly line) opened between Hammersmith and Finsbury Park serving Earl's Court from platforms in deep tube tunnels constructed beneath the surface station. Unlike at Gloucester Road and South Kensington, other stations served by both the District and Piccadilly lines, a new building to house the lifts to the deep level platforms was not required. Instead space was <b>provided</b> <b>within</b> the existing station shed, near Earls Court Road, and the lifts descended directly to platform level without the need for intermediate stairs below ground.|$|E
25|$|A second kind of {{experiment}} resembles the ordinary double-slit experiment. The schematic diagram of this experiment {{shows that a}} lens {{on the far side}} of the double slits makes the path from each slit diverge slightly from the other after they cross each other fairly near to that lens. The result is that at the two wavefunctions for each photon will be in superposition within a fairly short distance from the double slits, and if a detection screen is <b>provided</b> <b>within</b> the region wherein the wavefunctions are in superposition then interference patterns will be seen. There is no way by which any given photon could have been determined to have arrived from one or the other of the double slits. However, if the detection screen is removed the wavefunctions on each path will superimpose on regions of lower and lower amplitudes, and their combined probability values will be much less than the unreinforced probability values at the center of each path. When telescopes are aimed to intercept the center of the two paths, there will be equal probabilities of nearly 50% that a photon will show up in one of them. When a photon is detected by telescope 1, researchers may associate that photon with the wavefunction that emerged from the lower slit. When one is detected in telescope 2, researchers may associate that photon with the wavefunction that emerged from the upper slit. The explanation that supports this interpretation {{of experiment}}al results is that a photon has emerged from one of the slits, and that is the end of the matter. A photon must have started at the laser, passed through one of the slits, and arrived by a single straight-line path at the corresponding telescope.|$|E
500|$|In October 1939, the Soviet Union {{approached}} Germany with {{a request}} to purchase the then unfinished Admiral Hipper-class cruisers Lützow, , and , along with plans for German capital ships, naval artillery, and other naval technology. The Kriegsmarine denied the request for Seydlitz and Prinz Eugen, but agreed to sell Lützow, as well as [...] gun turrets and other weaponry. The price for the heavy cruiser was set at 150 millionReichsmarks, nearly double the original cost of the vessel, which was 83,590,000 Reichsmarks. Complete technical specifications, the results of engine trials, and spare parts {{were included in the}} sale. Eighty percent of the material was to be <b>provided</b> <b>within</b> twelve months of the transfer, with the remainder to be <b>provided</b> <b>within</b> fifteen months.

500|$|The {{game was}} a [...] "minor plot point" [...] {{in the third}} season of House of Cards, in which Frank Underwood plays the game; he is {{inspired}} by video gamer reviewer Thomas Yates's elegant description of Monument Valley to bring the reviewer on as his biographer. According to the studio Ustwo, they were approached by Netflix about including {{the game in the}} story, and the studio readily agreed without any financial compensation. They made a specialized version of the game for the show to aid in filming and to meet a description of the game <b>provided</b> <b>within</b> the script for the first episode in which it appeared. Ustwo saw the opportunity to introduce the title to a different audience set, and have already seen an increase in sales {{as a result of this}} appearance. The game re-entered the top of the most download app charts on the major app stores a few days after the February 2015 release of the season on Netflix.

500|$|On June 17, 1981, the EBP, OVRP and PRTP {{issued a}} joint {{statement}} after no updates were provided {{on the status of}} arrested FALN member Freddy Méndez calling this period of silence [...] "a kidnapping". Citing the tactics of CIA operative Dan Mitrione in Uruguay and similar interventions by the United States military in Argentina and Chile as part of Operation Condor, as well as allegations against the Phoenix Program in Vietnam, the organizations wondered if Méndez had been tortured and damaged to the point that publicly presenting him would cause a press crisis or if he had been killed in the process. Further quoting the previous use of drugs against prisoners by the FBI and the CIA in projects such as Project MKUltra, and the military use of truth serums, the organizations claimed that these tactics were unsuccessfully used against Rodríguez Cristóbal and that his death was a measure taken in response. Stating that in their opinion the case of Méndez had similarities, the alliance issued an ultimatum to the FBI, promising retaliation in no updates were <b>provided</b> <b>within</b> ten days.|$|E
500|$|Because {{there were}} no tornado {{warnings}} before the storm (and it occurred {{in an area where}} tornadoes are rare), the initial damage reports claimed an explosion had damaged a roof. Soon, however, the storm's nature and impact became apparent. Governor Ella Grasso lived just a block away from the tornado's path, though she was in Hartford {{at the time of the}} storm. She declared an 8 pm5 am curfew in the days following the tornado. About 500 National Guardsmen were activated to prevent looting and direct traffic, and the area was declared a disaster area by President Carter. FEMA trailers were <b>provided</b> <b>within</b> a few days, and were used by many residents until reconstruction or repairs could be completed. In all, at least 38 businesses were damaged or destroyed, 65 homes were completely destroyed, and at least 75 homes were damaged. Twenty-five tobacco sheds were [...] "extensively damaged". At the airport, at least 30 vintage aircraft were damaged or destroyed, as well as most of the state's National Guard helicopters. The final damage total reached $200 million (1979 USD), or $442 million in 1997 dollars.|$|E
