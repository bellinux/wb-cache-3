5|$|Access to {{the central}} island {{occurred}} over a drawbridge, through a pair of gatehouses on the eastern side. Caerphilly Castle's Inner East Gatehouse, based on the gatehouse built at Tonbridge in the 1250s, reinforced a trend in gatehouse design across England and Wales. Sometimes termed a keep-gatehouse, the fortification had both exterior and interior defences, enabling it to be defended even if {{the perimeter of the}} castle was breached. Two huge towers flanked the gatehouse on either side of an entrance that was protected by portcullises and murder-holes. The substantial size of the gatehouse allowed it to be used for accommodation as well as defence and it was comfortably equipped on a grand scale, <b>probably</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> use of the castle constable and his family. Another pair of gatehouses protected the west side.|$|E
5|$|Robert {{went on to}} rent further {{land around}} the north of Plas Mawr. The land {{at the south end}} of the burgage, however, facing onto the High Street, belonged to a Robert Laythwood, who had a house there. Wynne {{purchased}} this in 1585, <b>probably</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> relatively high price of £40, and demolished it to enable the final phase of development, using the space to build a gatehouse that formed the new entrance to Plas Mawr. Further small pieces of land were bought on the north-west side of the house and converted into an ornamental garden, bringing the total cost of the land to around £300. The result was the grandest Elizabethan town house in Wales at the time.|$|E
5|$|Gross {{salary was}} subject to {{deductions}} for food, clothing, boots and hay (<b>probably</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> company mules). It is unclear whether the cost of armour and weapons was also deducted, or borne by the army. Deductions left the soldier with a net salary of 78 denarii. This sum was sufficient, {{on the basis of}} the food deduction, to amply feed an adult for a year. In 84AD Domitian increased basic legionary pay by 33% (from 225 to 300 denarii): a similar increase was presumably accorded to auxiliaries, boosting their net income to 140 denarii, i.e. more than two food allowances. It was entirely disposable, as the soldier was exempt from the poll tax (capitatio), did not pay rent (he was housed in fort barracks) and his food, clothing and equipment were already deducted. It should be borne in mind that most recruits came from peasant families living at subsistence level. To such persons, any disposable income would appear attractive. It could be spent on leisure activities, sent to relatives or simply saved for retirement.|$|E

5|$|With {{help from}} her friends Bolo and Sky and her {{acquaintance}} Rottytops, she gains access to three dungeons where she retrieves {{three of the}} stones. At the fourth dungeon, Shantae finds the fourth stone, but is ambushed at the exit by Risky, who leaves with the stones. Shantae subsequently discovers the location of Risky's hideout with a magical flying telescope called the sky scope, and teleports there. Shantae reaches and destroys Risky's weapon, the Tinker Tank. Risky tries to kill Shantae but is defeated; and as Risky's hideout collapses, Shantae escapes. After, she is magically abducted to {{a place called the}} Genie Realm where the genies offer her a chance to remain with them as a reward for her courage, but at the price of never seeing her friends again. She refuses and is sent back to Scuttle Town where she announces to Mimic that she had to destroy the steam engine, but is relieved to hear from him that it was <b>probably</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> better.|$|E
25|$|Osteocytes {{are mostly}} {{inactive}} osteoblasts. Osteocytes originate from osteoblasts that have migrated into and become trapped {{and surrounded by}} bone matrix that they themselves produced. The spaces they occupy are known as lacunae. Osteocytes have many processes that reach out to meet osteoblasts and other osteocytes <b>probably</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> purposes of communication.|$|E
25|$|Most {{commentators}} {{agreed that}} the Liberal Party had little chance of winning government, and that Kerin would step down from the leadership after the election, a suspicion confirmed in Kerin's concession speech. Martin Hamilton-Smith was considering mounting a leadership challenge, however, he withdrew on 14 October 2005 (<b>probably</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> sake of the impression of party unity) and subsequently resigned or was pushed from the opposition frontbench.|$|E

25|$|In the books, the potion {{changes the}} drinker's voice to match {{that of the}} target, {{as well as any}} disabilities such as poor {{eyesight}} or amputations. The films contradict this point, <b>probably</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> sake of character clarity: Harry and Ron retain their own voices after using the potion in Chamber of Secrets; the same is true in Deathly Hallows – Part 1 during the scene of the seven Potters and while infiltrating the Ministry.|$|E
25|$|In 2007 the Edinburgh DVLA office {{exceptionally}} issued TN07 prefixed registrations {{for some}} vehicles, {{instead of the}} expected 'SN07'. This was stated to be because of potential offence caused by interpreting SN07 as 'snot'. This is the first known use of the 'T' code as the first letter, as it was not allocated to a region in the 2001 system. Also, TF07, TH07 and TJ07 registrations have been issued in Glasgow, most probably because the SA07–SJ07 allocations were exhausted. Similarly, along with TN07, TK07 has also been issued by Edinburgh, <b>probably</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> same oversubscription reason as in Glasgow. It has also been observed that the TP07 mark has also been issued.|$|E
25|$|Hugh J. Schonfield, in the {{controversial}} The Passover Plot and other works, saw {{evidence that the}} source of this Gospel was the Beloved Disciple of the Last Supper and further that this person, perhaps named John, was a senior Temple priest and so probably a member of the Sanhedrin. This would account for the knowledge of and access to the Temple which would not have been available to rough fishermen and followers of a disruptive rural preacher from the Galilee, one who was being accused of heresy besides. And <b>probably</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> evanescent presence of the Beloved Disciple in the events of Jesus' Ministry. On this reading, the Gospel was written, perhaps by a student and follower of this Disciple in his last advanced years, perhaps at Patmos.|$|E

25|$|Built around 1090, Neuenburg Castle was {{extended}} and modernized {{on a large}} scale several times. With its 30 000 square meters, the castle was amongst the strongest architectural representations of military power in all of the empire. It has survived to a remarkable extend: Major sections of the curtain walls in the north and east, part of the gate, the bottom part of the cattle, the castle keep, trenches in the east and in the south are conserved until today. The landmark big William (Dicker Wilhelm) is situated in the north-eastern part of the complex and visible from far away as a symbol of power. The castle keep III is classified as an independent development next to the French residential towers (donjons) which produced similar examples in the Rhineland region. Around 1225, a residential tower (residential tower II) was built <b>probably</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> landgrave’s family outside the southern curtain wall. 1172 Emperor Friedrich I Barbarossa visited Neuenburg Castle – the legend of the “living wall” of soldiers providing the best military defense has its roots in this legendary visit.|$|E
25|$|Charles Fraser {{was born}} in Blair Atholl, Perthshire, Scotland in 1788. He worked as a gardener, <b>probably</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> {{extensive}} estates of the landlord, the Duke of Atholl, and subsequently had connections with the botanic gardens of Edinburgh and Glasgow. He enlisted as {{a soldier in the}} 56th Regiment on 8 June 1815, and served in the East Indies before arriving in Sydney on board the convict ship Guildford on 8 April 1816. There, his skills as a horticulturalist were recognised, and he was appointed superintendent of the Royal Botanic Gardens, a position that he would hold until his death. In November 1816, Fraser was transferred to the 46th Regiment. He again transferred regiments in August 1817, this time to the 48th Regiment of Foot. On 6 January 1821, Fraser was discharged from the army and formally appointed Colonial Botanist, a position that he had been holding informally at least since 1819. Over the subsequent decade, he organised the development of Sydney Botanic Gardens from the governors’ kitchen garden to a world-renowned botanic garden, receiving and sending plants and seeds to all the major horticultural centres as well as to penal settlements and major gardens in New South Wales.|$|E
25|$|In series 1 of EastEnders: E20, Mercy, who is {{friends with}} Fatboy, {{is trying to}} create a project for the local church with the youth {{minister}} Benjamin (Damien Lynch), to attempt to bring younger people to the church, and if it is successful, Mercy's grandmother (played by Jay Byrd), will fund her university place. She enlists Fatboy's help but his ideas leave them humiliated. Mercy, along with the others, ends up squatting in 89b George Street, where she takes a pregnancy test and then tells her grandmother she will not be coming home. She goes to a clinic to discuss abortion, and later tells Fatboy she is pregnant. It is soon revealed that Benjamin, who is married to Celia (Marsha Henry) is the father, but Fatboy accuses Leon of being the father, and after an argument, Mercy doubles over in pain and is rushed to hospital. She suffers a miscarriage and Benjamin tells her it was <b>probably</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> best. Back at home, Fatboy looks after her. She attends Leon's boxing match where Fatboy gives her the completed project. Knowing they can no longer stay at the flat, Fatboy invites her and the others back to his house but she decides to return home to her grandmother.|$|E

25|$|It was <b>probably</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> {{same reason}} that the triumphal arch, the Arch of Trajan, was erected there by the senate and people of Rome and {{constructed}} by the architect Apollodorus of Damascus in 114. The Arch of Trajan {{is one of the}} best-preserved Roman structures in the Campania. It repeats the formula of the Arch of Titus in the Roman Forum, with reliefs of Trajan's life and exploits of his reign. Some of the sculptures are in the British Museum. Successive emperors seem to have bestowed on the city accessions of territory, and erected, or at least given name to, various public buildings. For administrative purposes it was first included, together {{with the rest of the}} Hirpini, in the second region of Augustus, but was afterwards annexed to Campania and placed under the control of the consular of that province. Its inhabitants were included in the Stellatine tribe. Beneventum retained its importance down to the close of the Empire, and though during the Gothic wars it was taken by Totila, and its walls razed to the ground, they were restored, as well as its public buildings, shortly after; and P. Diaconus speaks of it as a very wealthy city, and the capital of all the surrounding provinces.|$|E
25|$|Until {{the month}} before the 2007 race, there was much debate over a recent change in the Little 500 rules. While {{it has been a}} long-standing {{tradition}} in the race that teams have alumni riders coach them, IUSF decided to introduce a new mandatory system of coaching: the student coach. The idea behind it was twofold. One was to involve more students in the race to make it more like the original race before alumni riders existed, and another was to help give independent teams a better chance of success in the race. While both of these goals were both valid and likely needed, the rule change caused many problems. The first problem was that it was difficult for teams to find students that were interested in being a student coach. Secondly, the new rule was going to prohibit alumni coaches from being in their respective team's pit on race day. Both of these caused a great deal of controversy, to the point that some teams were threatening to boycott the race. In the end, some form of a compromise was reached: every team had a student coach, and on race day the alumni coaches were allowed to be in the pit. While it all turned out <b>probably</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> best, this rule change did change the race. There were teams that lost their alumni coaches due to this. And it is believed that this rule change {{is one of the reasons}} why the women's race did not have a full field in 2007.|$|E

500|$|The Buhl Altarpiece (...) is a late 15th-century, Gothic altarpiece of colossal {{dimensions}} now kept in {{the parish}} church Église Saint-Jean-Baptiste of Buhl in the Haut-Rhin département of France. It was painted by followers of Martin Schongauer, most <b>probably</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> convent of the Dominican sisters of Saint Catherine of Colmar, and moved to its present location in the early 19th century. It is classified as a Monument historique by the French Ministry of Culture (see below, History).|$|E
500|$|Bach {{composed}} {{the work in}} 1723, his first year as [...] in Leipzig, <b>probably</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> feast of the Visitation. For the occasion, he presented the Magnificat as his first work on a Latin text and his first five-part choral setting in Leipzig. Otherwise, he used five voices in the funeral motet , the Missa in B minor, composed in 1733 for the court of Dresden, from which he derived the derived cantata , and in the Mass in B minor. Richard D. P. Jones notes: [...] "Without exception these works lie outside the normal routine of Bach's sacred vocal works".|$|E
500|$|In 1086, the Domesday Book {{recorded}} that 11 houses {{had been}} built in the ditches around the city walls, which by then appear to have been in a poor condition. The encroachment was possibly the result of population pressures on the inner, walled city, as Canterbury had spread out well beyond the walls by the mid-11th century. It is unclear how the walls were maintained during this period, and by the 12th century they were in ruins and of little practical defensive value. In the late-12th century, the walls were assigned some limited royal funding through the local sheriff, <b>probably</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> maintenance of existing structures, and just over £5 was spent in 1166–67 on these repairs.|$|E
