40|$|Purpose – The {{objective}} of this paper included developing a <b>polar</b> <b>robot</b> (SPBot) for rotating and transferring car engine block (CEB) around and along two different axes in a confined workspace envelope. Design/methodology/approach – The complex transfer operations of the CEB requires sweeping complete surface of the half sphere, and thus a <b>polar</b> <b>robot</b> is best suited to such a task in a confined space. Considering the limited space for this operation, a specially designed manipulator is built comprising 2 degrees of freedom driven by electrical servo motors. Also due to the special form of CEB, an especially designed pneumatic gripper is developed. Kinematics models, static and dynamic equations, together with trajectory planning for such a manipulator are described. Findings – The high-speed complex transfer in a limited environment is successfully implemented. Originality/value – The developed <b>polar</b> <b>robot</b> provides for complex transfer operations that significantly increases {{the speed of the}} product line and thus reducing the cycle time from 60 ?s using manpower to just 20 ?s using the robot...|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} develop a {{self-sufficient}} autonomous mobile robot which has long working ability and can work on the polar ice caps, important data of the distributed density of the new energy and characteristic of renewable energy within the working area scope of the robot should be seriously considered. In this paper, we design a novel hybrid Solar-Wind power generation system {{that is capable of}} data acquisition of the battery charging and data transferring by satellite. This system has the capacity of automatically recording and transferring the information of its battery series, and is installed in Chinese Zhongshan station that is located in the Antarctic. The experimental results show that the Solar & Wind energy could be continuously captured by the system; meanwhile, the possible power consumption of the mobile <b>polar</b> expedition <b>robot</b> is also evaluated and analyzed. The system also provides useful renewable power data for the implementation of future <b>polar</b> expedition <b>robot</b> which aims to have infinite working ability.

40|$|Abstract. Why develop <b>polar</b> <b>robots?</b> As {{with space}} missions, {{logistics}} costs predominate polarscience budgets largely to maintain safe human operations in harsh environments. Reducing this logistics burden would greatly expand research {{opportunities in the}} Polar Regions. We have developed a simple four-wheel-drive, solar-powered Cool Robot to conduct autonomous summertime science campaigns in Antarctica and Greenland. The 60 -kg robot measures 1. 2 x 1. 2 x 1 m and can easily carry a 20 -kg science payload. A low-profile chassis supports a five-sided, lightweight box of solar cells. Reflected sunlight from polar snowfields contributes 20 – 40 % of the power input, and the side panels capture this power while avoiding the complexity of sun-tracking. Under clear polar skies, 15 W of payload power are available while the robot drives and over 200 W when it is stationary. The robot navigates by GPS waypoint following across largely obstacle-free polar terrain. It requires no fuel caches, and emits no pollutants so it can conduct clean snow and air measurements. Mobility considerations predominate the <b>robot’s</b> design. Although <b>polar</b> snow is firm, rolling resistance accounts for about 90 % of the power budget. To minimize it, the Cool Robot uses lightweight construction throughout and rides on 0. 51 -m-dia. x 0. 15 -m-wide tires at zer...|$|R

40|$|A novel {{point-to-point}} scan matching {{approach is}} proposed to address pose estimation and map building issues of mobile <b>robots.</b> <b>Polar</b> Scan Matching (PSM) and Metric-Based Iterative Closest Point (Mb-ICP) are usually employed for point-to-point scan matching tasks. However, {{due to the}} facts that PSM considers the distribution similarity of polar radii in irrelevant region of reference and current scans and Mb-ICP assumes a constant weight in the norm about rotation angle, they {{may lead to a}} mismatching of the reference and current scan in real-world scenarios. In order to obtain better match results and accurate estimation of the robot pose, we introduce a new metric rule, Polar Metric-Weighted Norm (PMWN), which takes both rotation and translation into account to match the reference and current scan. For robot pose estimation, the heading rotation angle is estimated by correspondences establishing results and further corrected by an absolute-value function, and then the geometric property of PMWN called projected circle is used to estimate the robot translation. The extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of PMWN-based approach. The results show that the proposed approach outperforms PSM and Mb-ICP in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and loop closure error of mapping...|$|R
