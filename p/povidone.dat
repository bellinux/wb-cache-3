Inactive ingredients in alprazolam tablets and solutions include microcrystalline cellulose, corn starch, docusate sodium, <b>povidone,</b> sodium starch glycollate, lactose monohydrate, magnesium stearate, colloidal silicon dioxide, and sodium benzoate. In addition, the 0.25mg tablet contains D Yellow No. 10 and the 0.5mg tablet contains FD Yellow No. 6 and D Yellow No. 10.|$|E
25|$|Viral {{conjunctivitis}} usually resolves {{on its own}} {{and does}} not require any specific treatment. Antihistamines (e.g., diphenhydramine) or mast cell stabilizers (e.g., cromolyn) {{may be used to}} help with the symptoms. <b>Povidone</b> iodine has been suggested as a treatment, but as of 2008 evidence to support it was poor.|$|E
25|$|Treatment {{can include}} topical steroids to {{diminish}} the inflammation. Antibiotics {{to diminish the}} proportion of aerobic bacteria is still a matter of debate. The use of local antibiotics, preferably local non-absorbed and broad spectrum, covering enteric gram-positive and gram-negative aerobes, can be an option. In some cases, systemic antibiotics can be helpful, such as amoxicillin/clavulanate or moxifloxacin. Vaginal rinsing with <b>povidone</b> iodine can provide relief of symptoms but does not provide long-term reduction of bacterial loads. Dequalinium chloride can also be an option for treatment.|$|E
25|$|Animal {{control and}} {{vaccination}} programs have decreased {{the risk of}} rabies from dogs {{in a number of}} regions of the world. Immunizing people before they are exposed is recommended for those who are at high risk. The high-risk group includes people who work with bats or who spend prolonged periods in areas of the world where rabies is common. In people who have been exposed to rabies, the rabies vaccine and sometimes rabies immunoglobulin are effective in preventing the disease if the person receives the treatment before the start of rabies symptoms. Washing bites and scratches for 15 minutes with soap and water, <b>povidone</b> iodine, or detergent may reduce the number of viral particles and may be somewhat effective at preventing transmission. Only six people have survived a rabies infection after showing symptoms, and this was with extensive treatment known as the Milwaukee protocol.|$|E

5000|$|Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), also {{commonly}} called polyvidone or <b>povidone,</b> is a water-soluble polymer {{made from the}} monomer N-vinylpyrrolidone: ...|$|E
50|$|Research has {{previously}} {{found that the}} polymer polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP, <b>povidone)</b> can coil around individual carbon nanotubes to make them water-soluble.|$|E
50|$|<b>Povidone</b> iodine {{is equally}} {{effective}} and safe as talc, {{and may be}} preferred because of easy availability and low cost.|$|E
50|$|<b>Povidone</b> iodine topical solution: This is a {{chemical}} complex of iodine with polyvinylpyrrolidone, the agent being a polymer having an {{average molecular weight}} of 40,000. The <b>povidone</b> iodine contains 10% available iodine, slowly released when applied to skin. This preparation is employed topically as a surgical scrub and non irritating antiseptic solution, with its effectiveness being directly attributed to the presence and release of iodine from the complex. Commercial product: Betadine solution.|$|E
5000|$|Factitial panniculitis is a panniculitis {{that may}} be induced by the {{injection}} of organic materials, <b>povidone,</b> feces, saliva, vaginal fluid, and oils.|$|E
50|$|In a {{randomized}} controlled trial involving forty patients with postoperative lesions on an infected diabetic foot, a super-oxidized solution {{was found to}} reduce healing times significantly more than treatment with <b>povidone</b> iodine.|$|E
50|$|<b>Povidone</b> iodine is an {{antiseptic}} in {{the form}} of liquid, swabstick, or towelette. Can be used in a weak dilution of clean water to prepare an irrigation solution for cleaning a wound.|$|E
50|$|An anti-filarial drug, such as diethylcarbamazine, may be prescribed. Severe {{damage to}} lymph {{channels}} may require surgery.Sclerotherapy with instillation of 1% of silver nitrate or <b>povidone</b> iodine (2ml of 5% + 8ml distilled water).|$|E
50|$|It {{is used in}} pleurodesis (fusion of the pleura {{because of}} incessant pleural effusions). For this purpose, <b>povidone</b> iodine is equally {{effective}} and safe as talc, and may be preferred because of easy availability and low cost.|$|E
5000|$|The wet {{granulate}} {{is prepared}} {{by adding the}} liquid binder-adhesive to the powder blend and mixing thoroughly. Examples of binders/adhesives include aqueous preparations of cornstarch, natural gums such as acacia, cellulose derivatives such as methyl cellulose, gelatin, and <b>povidone.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{blood is}} {{collected}} using aseptic technique. This requires {{that both the}} tops of the culture bottles and the venipuncture site of the patient are cleaned prior to collection by swabbing with 70% isopropyl alcohol (<b>povidone</b> and left to dry before venipuncture).|$|E
50|$|Povidone-iodine is a {{chemical}} complex of <b>povidone,</b> hydrogen iodide, and elemental iodine.It is completely soluble in cold and mild-warm water, ethyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, polyethylene glycol, and glycerol. Its stability in solution {{is much greater}} than that of tincture of iodine or Lugol's solution.|$|E
50|$|Valtrex {{is offered}} in 250 mg, 500 mg, and 1 gram tablets, the active {{ingredient}} being valacyclovir hydrochloride, with the inactive ingredients carnauba wax, colloidal silicon dioxide, crospovidone, FD&C Blue No. 2 Lake, hypromellose, magnesium stearate, microcrystalline cellulose, polyethylene glycol, polysorbate 80, <b>povidone,</b> and titanium dioxide.|$|E
50|$|<b>Povidone</b> is {{commonly}} {{used in conjunction with}} other chemicals. Some of these, such as iodine, are blamed for allergic responses, although testing results in some patients show no signs of allergy to the suspect chemical. Allergies attributed to these other chemicals may possibly be caused by the PVP instead.|$|E
50|$|The tablets contain lactose monohydrate, low {{substituted}} hydroxypropyl cellulose, <b>povidone,</b> microcrystalline cellulose, magnesium stearate, hypromellose, polyethylene glycol, talc, and {{titanium dioxide}} {{in addition to}} the API; the oral suspension contains sorbitol, microcrystalline cellulose, carboxymethylcellulose sodium, poloxamer, simethicone, citric acid, sodium benzoate and purified water {{in addition to the}} API.|$|E
50|$|Viral {{conjunctivitis}} usually resolves {{on its own}} {{and does}} not require any specific treatment. Antihistamines (e.g., diphenhydramine) or mast cell stabilizers (e.g., cromolyn) {{may be used to}} help with the symptoms. <b>Povidone</b> iodine has been suggested as a treatment, but as of 2008 evidence to support it was poor.|$|E
5000|$|In the United States, its use {{has been}} {{superseded}} by other agents (e.g., <b>povidone</b> iodine, benzalkonium chloride, chloroxylenol). In Canada, Jean Coutu/Personnelle brand sells as [...] "mercurochrome" [...] {{what is actually}} chlorhexidine. Mercurochrome is still an important antiseptic, particularly in developing nations, due to its “unbelievably low cost.” ...|$|E
50|$|The <b>povidone</b> polymer {{provides}} a sustained release of iodine. The polyethylene glycol {{provides a}} moist environment allowing the iodine {{to reach the}} bacteria in the wound. PVP-I is the broadest spectrum antiseptic for human use and has no reported cases of acquired resistance and is therefore a very effective bactericide.|$|E
50|$|An Iodophor is a {{preparation}} containing iodine complexed with a solubilizing agent, {{such as a}} surfactant or <b>povidone</b> (forming povidone-iodine). The result is a water-soluble material that releases free iodine when in solution. Iodophors are prepared by mixing iodine with the solubilizing agent; heat {{can be used to}} speed up the reaction.|$|E
50|$|The {{injectable}} form of delafloxacin is sold as the meglumine salt of {{the active}} ingredient and its United States Adopted Name, delafloxacin meglumine, reflects that; the injection formulation also includes EDTA and sulfobutylether-β-cyclodextrin. The tablet is made of delafloxacin, citric acid anhydrous, crospovidone, magnesium stearate, microcrystalline cellulose, <b>povidone,</b> sodium bicarbonate, and sodium phosphate monobasic monohydrate.|$|E
50|$|Some APIs may be tableted as pure substances, {{but this}} is rarely the case; most {{formulations}} include excipients. Normally, a pharmacologically inactive ingredient (excipient) termed a binder is added to help hold the tablet together and give it strength. A wide variety of binders may be used, some common ones including lactose, dibasic calcium phosphate, sucrose, corn (maize) starch, microcrystalline cellulose, <b>povidone</b> polyvinylpyrrolidone and modified cellulose (for example hydroxypropyl methylcellulose and hydroxyethylcellulose).|$|E
50|$|Side effects include skin irritation. If used {{on large}} wounds kidney problems, high blood sodium, and {{metabolic}} acidosis may occur. It {{is not recommended}} in people who are less than 32 weeks pregnant or are taking lithium. Frequent use is not recommended in people with thyroid problems. Povidone-iodine is a chemical complex of <b>povidone,</b> hydrogen iodide, and elemental iodine. It contains from 9% to 12% available iodine. It works by releasing iodine which results {{in the death of}} a range of microorganisms.|$|E
50|$|Treatment {{can include}} topical steroids to {{diminish}} the inflammation. Antibiotics {{to diminish the}} proportion of aerobic bacteria is still a matter of debate. The use of local antibiotics, preferably local non-absorbed and broad spectrum, covering enteric gram-positive and gram-negative aerobes, can be an option. In some cases, systemic antibiotics can be helpful, such as amoxicillin/clavulanate or moxifloxacin. Vaginal rinsing with <b>povidone</b> iodine can provide relief of symptoms but does not provide long-term reduction of bacterial loads. Dequalinium chloride can also be an option for treatment.|$|E
50|$|It is {{generally}} not advisable to use isopropyl alcohol to cleanse the venipuncture site when obtaining a specimen for a blood alcohol test. This has been related largely to the potential legal implications associated with use of alcohol based cleaners that could theoretically impact analysis. Numerous police alcohol collection kits have been marketed that incorporate a sodium fluoride/potassium oxalate preservative and non-alcohol based cleansing agents to ensure proper collection. Using soap and hot water or a <b>povidone</b> iodine swab are advisable alternatives to isopropyl alcohol in this case.|$|E
50|$|It {{is used as}} {{a binder}} in many {{pharmaceutical}} tablets; it simply passes through the body when taken orally. However, autopsies have found that crospovidone (PVPP) contributes to pulmonary vascular injury in substance abusers who have injected pharmaceutical tablets intended for oral consumption. The long-term effects of crospovidone or <b>povidone</b> within the lung are unknown. PVP added to iodine forms a complex called povidone-iodine that possesses disinfectant properties. This complex is used in various products like solutions, ointment, pessaries, liquid soaps and surgical scrubs. It is known under the trade names Pyodine and Betadine among a plethora of others.|$|E

Alprazolam oral solutions are available as 0.5 mg/5 mL and as 1 mg/1 mL oral solutions. Inactive ingredients in alprazolam tablets and solutions include microcrystalline cellulose, corn starch, docusate sodium, <b>povidone,</b> sodium starch glycollate, lactose monohydrate, magnesium stearate, colloidal silicon dioxide, and sodium benzoate. In addition, the 0.25 mg tablet contains D&C Yellow No. 10 and the 0.5 mg tablet contains FD&C Yellow No. 6 and D&C Yellow No. 10.|$|E
5000|$|If {{the area}} is still {{partially}} or fully frozen, it should be rewarmed {{in the hospital with}} a warm bath with <b>povidone</b> iodine or chlorhexidine antiseptic. Active rewarming seeks to warm the injured tissue as quickly as possible without burning. The faster tissue is thawed, the less tissue damage occurs. [...] According the Handford and colleagues, [...] "The Wilderness Medical Society and State of Alaska Cold Injury Guidelines recommend a temperature of 37°C-39°C, which decreases the pain experienced by the patient whilst only slightly slowing rewarming time." [...] Warming takes 15 minutes - 1 hour. Rewarming can be very painful, so pain management is important.|$|E
50|$|Treatment is {{not always}} easy and aims at {{correcting}} the three key changes encountered in aerobic vaginitis: the presence of atrophy, inflammation and abnormal flora. The treatment can include topical steroids to diminish the inflammation and topical estrogen to reduce the atrophy. The use and choice of antibiotics to diminish the load/proportion of aerobic bacteria is still a matter of debate. The use of local antibiotics, preferably local non-absorbed and broad spectrum, covering enteric gram-positive and gram-negative aerobes, like kanamycin can be an option. In some cases, systemic antibiotics can be helpful, such as amoxyclav or moxifloxacin. Vaginal rinsing with <b>povidone</b> iodine can provide rapid relief of symptoms but does not provide long-term reduction of bacterial loads. Dequalinium chloride can also be an option for treatment.|$|E
50|$|The {{patient will}} be {{transported to the}} {{operating}} room and the procedures for induction of the type of anesthesia chosen by both the patient and medical staff will be started. The subject area will be prepped by shaving, application of an antiseptic wash (usually <b>povidone</b> iodine or chlorhexidine gluconate - if sensitive or allergic to the former), surgically draped and placed in the Lloyd-Davies position. Note: throughout the duration of the procedure, the patient's legs will be massaged and manipulated at predetermined intervals in an attempt to prevent compartment syndrome, a complication from circulatory and nerve compression resultant from the lithotomy positioning. Some hospitals utilize the Allen Medical Stirrup System, which automatically inflates a compression sleeve applied to the thigh-portion of the stirrup device at predetermined intervals. This system is designed to prevent compartment syndrome in surgeries lasting more than six hours.|$|E
50|$|Water {{mixed into}} the powders can form bonds between powder {{particles}} that {{are strong enough}} to lock them together. However, once the water dries, the powders may fall apart. Therefore, water may not be strong enough to create and hold a bond. In such instances, a liquid solution that includes a binder (pharmaceutical glue) is required. <b>Povidone,</b> which is a polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP), {{is one of the most}} commonly used pharmaceutical binders. PVP is dissolved in water or solvent and added to the process. When PVP and a solvent/water are mixed with powders, PVP forms a bond with the powders during the process, and the solvent/water evaporates (dries). Once the solvent/water has been dried and the powders have formed a more densely held mass, then the granulation is milled. This process results in the formation of granules.|$|E
