5|$|Filming {{began in}} early August 2015, during the wet season, in the Idukki {{district}} of Kerala. Major {{portions of the}} film were shot in Thopramkudy, near Kattappana. In September, while filming in Cheruthoni, Faasil sustained a leg injury while performing a stunt with co-star Sujith Shanker. Although a two-day rest was advised, he decided to <b>press</b> <b>on</b> because of the tight shooting schedule. The filming in Idukki, which took 45 days, was wrapped up in late October.|$|E
5|$|Following Reinboldt's death, {{around the}} time that the Mark Foley scandal broke in 2006, Burdge unsuccessfully {{attempted}} to bring the charges against Hastert to light; she contacted ABC News and the Associated <b>Press</b> <b>on</b> an off-the-record basis, and also contacted some advocacy groups. ABC News and the AP could not corroborate Jolene's allegation at the time, and Hastert denied the accusation to ABC News at the time, so the claim was not published.|$|E
5|$|In a {{practice}} match before the <b>press</b> <b>on</b> January 13, 2011, Watson won a 15-question round against Ken Jennings and Brad Rutter {{with a score}} of $4,400 to Jennings's $3,400 and Rutter's $1,200, though Jennings and Watson were tied before the final $1,000 question. None of the three players responded incorrectly to a clue.|$|E
40|$|Concurrent variable-ratio {{schedules}} {{of electrical}} brain stimulation, food, and water were paired in various combinations as reinforcement of rats' lever presses. Relative {{prices of the}} concurrent reinforcers were varied by changing {{the ratio of the}} response requirements on the two levers. Economic substitutability, measured by the sensitivity of response ratio to changes in relative price, was highest with brain stimulation reinforcement of <b>presses</b> <b>on</b> both levers and lowest with food reinforcement of <b>presses</b> <b>on</b> one lever and water reinforcement of <b>presses</b> <b>on</b> the other. Substitutability with brain stimulation reinforcement of <b>presses</b> <b>on</b> one lever and either food or water reinforcement for <b>presses</b> <b>on</b> the other was about as high as with brain stimulation for <b>presses</b> <b>on</b> both levers. Electrical brain stimulation for rats may thus serve as an economic substitute for two reinforcers, neither of which is substitutable for the other...|$|R

5|$|Konami kept Raiden's {{starring}} role in Metal Gear Solid 2 secret until the game's North American release, {{going so far as}} to replace Raiden with Snake in teaser trailers and other preview materials.

60|$|Alderete had, as Cortez supposed, <b>pressed</b> <b>on</b> the {{retreating}} Aztecs with too great eagerness. He had carried the barricades which defended the breach, and had given orders that the chasm should be filled up. But in their eagerness {{to be first}} in the square, the Spaniards had <b>pressed</b> <b>on,</b> none caring to stop {{to see that the}} allies carried out the order. So, taking position after position, they <b>pressed</b> <b>on</b> until they were close to the square.|$|R

The match concluded when Kidman executed a Shooting star <b>press</b> <b>on</b> London for the win.|$|E

5|$|We {{took off}} from the {{concrete}} runway in Leck, Kirchner (Fhj.Fw Günther Kirchner) stayed 30 metres behind me on my right side as usual;... We climbed up to about 200 metres, when suddenly two Thunderbolts appeared behind us and instantly shot down Günther Kirchner's plane. I saw him jettison canopy and catapult but his parachute did not deploy. I was very lucky that the Thunderbolts did not <b>press</b> <b>on</b> with another attack.|$|E
5|$|Needled by {{repeated}} {{attacks from}} the <b>press</b> <b>on</b> his supposed indecency, poor taste {{and lack of}} creativity, Etty changed his approach after the response to Youth on the Prow, and Pleasure at the Helm. He exhibited over 80 further paintings at the Royal Academy alone, and remained a prominent painter of nudes, but from this time made conscious efforts to reflect moral lessons. He died in November 1849 and, while his work enjoyed a brief boom in popularity, interest in him declined over time, {{and by the end}} of the 19th century all of his paintings had fallen below their original prices.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, unbeknown {{to their}} commanders and each other, and having lost communications, the seven landing craft {{that had been}} {{reported}} missing made for their assigned beaches, determined to <b>press</b> <b>on</b> with the attack. In the end two parties landed, one party consisting of six craft carrying approximately 120 men under Captain R.L Willis landed on the beach opposite Le Petit Berneval {{to the east of}} the battery—Yellow I—while the other, consisting of only one craft of 20 men from No. 6 Troop under Captain Peter Young landed to the west at Yellow II.|$|E

5|$|Numerous {{damaging}} leaks, {{which appeared}} to originate from conversations between McVeigh and his defense attorneys, emerged. They included a confession {{said to have been}} inadvertently included on a computer disk that was given to the press, which McVeigh believed seriously compromised his chances of getting a fair trial. A gag order was imposed during the trial, prohibiting attorneys on either side from commenting to the <b>press</b> <b>on</b> the evidence, proceedings, or opinions regarding the trial proceedings. The defense was allowed to enter into evidence six pages of a 517-page Justice Department report criticizing the FBI crime laboratory and David Williams, one of the agency's explosives experts, for reaching unscientific and biased conclusions. The report claimed that Williams had worked backward in the investigation rather than basing his determinations on forensic evidence.|$|E
5|$|On 30 July 1993, {{a mortar}} shell fired by Bosnian Serb troops hit a Sarajevo neighbourhood, {{injuring}} five-year-old Irma Hadžimuratović and killing several others, including her mother. Sarajevo's overstretched Koševo hospital {{was unable to}} provide adequate treatment for the injuries Irma received to her spine, head and abdomen. She developed bacterial meningitis as a result. Edo Jaganjac, the surgeon treating Hadžimuratović, tried unsuccessfully to have her evacuated on a UN relief flight. He then resorted to distributing her photograph among foreign journalists in Sarajevo. Several picked up Irma's story, giving it widespread coverage in the international (and especially the British) <b>press.</b> <b>On</b> the evening of 8 August, BBC news led with coverage of Irma's injuries. On 9 August, British Prime Minister John Major personally intervened, dispatching an RAF Hercules to airlift Irma to London's Great Ormond Street Hospital.|$|E
5|$|Progress is {{punctuated by}} cutscenes and codec, {{as well as}} {{encounters}} with bosses. To progress, players must discover the weaknesses of each boss and defeat them. Play controls and strategies can also be accessed via the Codec radio, where advice is delivered from Snake's support team; for example, the support team may chastise Snake for not saving his progress often enough, or explain his combat moves in terms of which buttons to <b>press</b> <b>on</b> the gamepad. The Codec {{is also used to}} provide exposition on the game's backstory.|$|E
