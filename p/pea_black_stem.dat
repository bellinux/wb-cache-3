50|$|Spring <b>Black</b> <b>Stem</b> is {{a common}} fungal, foliar disease caused by Phoma medicaginis. Spring <b>Black</b> <b>Stem</b> is most {{commonly}} found in alfalfa, but also attacks certain clovers. The fungus survives in stubble from previous cuttings and spreads easily by rain splash, running water, and equipment. The disease is present in numerous alfalfa fields throughout the Northeast United States.|$|R
50|$|Lathyrus niger, {{also known}} as <b>black</b> <b>pea,</b> {{blackening}} flat <b>pea</b> and <b>black</b> bitter vetch, is a perennial legume that is native to Europe. Its common name is reference to the blackening of the plant's foliage as it dies.|$|R

40|$|Field {{experiments}} were conducted over two growing seasons with three sunflower cultivars {{to explore the}} spatiotemporal dynamics of phoma <b>black</b> <b>stem</b> epidemics and to test hypotheses pertaining to (i) disease spread from a known inoculum source; (ii) spatial patterns of the disease; (iii) disease spatiotemporal association; and (iv) association between disease intensity and sunflower defoliation. The spatial patterns of disease were random in most of epidemics, and disease gradients were not detected. Our results suggest absence of secondary infections, that is, that the studied phoma <b>black</b> <b>stem</b> epidemics were monocyclic under the experimental conditions reported here. Significant associations {{between the number of}} dead leaves per plant and the number of phoma <b>black</b> <b>stem</b> lesions per plant were detected towards the end of epidemics...|$|R

40|$|Abstract- The {{study was}} carried out during kharif, rabi and summer seasons in fifty villages of Narmada, Gujarat during 2012 - 13. All 400 demonstrations on pigeon <b>pea,</b> chick <b>pea,</b> <b>black</b> gram and green gram crops were carried out in area of 160 ha by the active {{participation}} of farmers with the objective to demonstrate the improved technologies of pulses production potential. The improved technologies consisting use of modern variety, seed treatment with rhizobium and PSB culture, balanced fertilizer application and integrated pest management. FLD recorded higher yield as compared to farmer’s local practice. The improved technology recorded higher yield of 1880 kg/ha, 1480 kg/ha, 880 kg/ha and 927 kg/ha in pigeon <b>pea,</b> chick <b>pea,</b> <b>black</b> gram and green gram, respectively than 1450, 1130, 680 and 711 kg/ha. In spite of increase in yield of pulses, technological gap, extension gap and technology index existed. The improved technology gave higher gross return, net return with higher benefit cost ratio as farmer’s practices...|$|R

50|$|Phoma <b>black</b> <b>stem</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{diseases}} affecting the sunflower plant in North America. Phoma <b>Black</b> <b>stem</b> has also been known to occur in regions of Europe and Asia. In many cases small lesions can be produced however if the infection is caused early on in the season the sunflower plant may become severely diseased. In the case of a more severe infection, smaller heads may be produced in which case there will be a reduced seed yield and oil percentage.|$|R

40|$|Alfalfa is {{the most}} {{important}} forage crop in Nebraska. it is wisely adapted, energy efficient and produces the most protein yield per acre. It is used widely for local livestock feed and its importance as a cash crop is growing rapidly.
