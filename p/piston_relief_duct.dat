40|$|<b>Relief</b> <b>ducts</b> {{fitted to}} venting {{openings}} {{is a widespread}} configuration in the industrial practice. The presence of a duct {{has been reported to}} severely increase the violence of the vented explosion posing a problem for the proper design of the venting device. Several studies have reported the leading importance - in the whole complex explosion phenomenology - of a secondary explosion in the duct. Modern approaches in the study of simply vented explosions (without ducts) have focused on the study of the interaction between internal and external explosion as a key issue in the mechanisms of pressure generation. The issue is even more relevant when a duct is fitted to the vent due the confined nature of the external explosion. In this work the interaction between internal and external events is experimentally investigated for gas explosions vented through a <b>relief</b> <b>duct.</b> The work has aimed at studying mechanisms underlying the pressure rise of this venting configuration. The study has put the emphasis on the mutual nature of the interaction. A larger scale than laboratory has been investigated allowing drawing results with a greater degree of generality with respect to data so far presented in literature. © 2007 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|The {{mitigation}} {{of effects}} {{of gas and}} dust explosions within industrial equipment is effective if venting the combustion products to safe location. The presence of <b>relief</b> <b>duct</b> is however likely to increase the severity of the explosion with respect to equipment vented to open atmosphere, due to secondary explosions occurring in the initial sections of duct, frictional drag and inertia of the gas column, acoustic and Helmholtz oscillations. The weights of these phenomena on explosion enhancement in terms of peak pressure and rate of pressure rise are still uncertain. As a consequence, appropriate design of duct-venting configuration is still a matter of debate. We recently found that the main phenomenon among those cited is the burn-up occurring in the initial section of duct, which leads to the backflow from the duct towards the protected vented equipment, thus restricting the effective vent section and turbulizing the flame within the combustion chamber. Starting from this result, we have identified dimensionless numbers which quantifies the burn-up effects and then we identified engineering correlations for the appropriate design of relief section in the presence of duct. © TÜBİTAK...|$|R

40|$|Venting {{devices are}} the main {{solution}} for the mitigation of accidental explosion. However, <b>relief</b> <b>ducts</b> are mandatory for the discharge of combustion products to safe location. On the other hand, {{the presence of a}} duct is likely to increase the severity of the explosion with respect to simply vented vessels. To this regard, several mechanisms have been proposed to account for the enhanced violence of the explosion in such configuration: secondary explosion in the duct (burnup), frictional drag and inertia of the gas column in the duct, acoustic and Helmholtz oscillations. The relative effects of the cited phenomena and their weight on maximum pressure reached during ducted vented explosion is uncertain. As a consequence, appropriate design of ductventing configuration is still a matter of debate and it’s not surprising that the available guidelines for the design of ducted vents for gas explosions can lead to gross errors. The authors have recently proposed experimental and numerical analyses (Computational Fluid Dynamics) for the analysis of duct-vented phenomena on the peak pressure measured in either small, medium or large scale equipment. Results of these studies highlighted that the two main phenomena responsible for the increased peak pressure are: i) the explosion occurring in the initial sections of the duct leading to a backflow from the duct towards the main vessel, thus restricting the effective vent section; ii) the turbulization of flame within the combustion chamber, due to the backflow, which enhances the combustion rate and the rate of pressure rise. In this paper, we propose an engineering correlation based on semi-empirical engineering methodologies aiming at quantifying the relation between the geometric properties (venting section, duct length, vessel volume) and the peak pressure occurring in the combustion chamber {{in the presence of a}} duct fitted on the vent panel...|$|R

40|$|Fault arcs in {{electrical}} installations occur extremely seldom. However, {{they can not}} be avoided totally. Insulation failure, flashover, malfunction or maloperation by service personnel can lead to powerful fault arcs. As a result switchgear installations and even substation buildings may be endangered by thermal and mechanical stress. Metal enclosed switchgears can withstand some hundred mbar overpressure, substation buildings e. g. constructed of bricks may be damaged by overpressures exceeding 3 mbar. The goal of this work is the investigation of possibilities to reduce overpressure due to internal arcs especially in switchgear rooms or substation buildings. The following measures are analysed:- pressure relief openings,- intermediate volumes and relief ducts,- fault arc energy absorbers. Encapsulated (gas insulated) switchgears are provided with overpressure relief devices which lead to the switchgear room. After fault arc ignition pressure rises in the compartment where the arc burns (arc room), the relief devices open and the overpressure in the switchgear room rises. The level of overpressure depends significantly on fault arc duration and power, which can be about some 10 MW in distribution systems. The overpressure reduction in the switchgear room can be achieved e. g. by sufficiently dimensioned pressure relief openings. Another possibility is the use of intermediate rooms as buffer volumes or pressure <b>relief</b> <b>ducts,</b> which can be installed on switchgears draining hot gases. Fault arc energy absorbers are cooling grids, which withdraw energy from hot gases generated by the fault arc with the result of overpressure reduction. The overpressure development is analysed by using two available program packages. The first one leads to pressure results, which are averaged values in the volume under consideration. The second one is a commercial Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) tool with three dimensional results. To quantify the effect of fault arc energy absorbers, experiments with a high-current test set-up are performed. The results of these investigations shall contribute to a safe design of measures for overpressure reduction in the case of fault arcs {{in electrical}} installations...|$|R

40|$|The {{reversibility}} of hepatic fibrosis {{was investigated}} in an experimental model of extrahepatic cholestasis in the rat after common bile duct ligation for 2 weeks, followed by bilioduodenal anastomosis for 3 weeks. Bile duct ligation resulted in a transitory marked elevation in the serum concentration of 5 '-nucleotidase, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin during the first 3 days. Then these levels decreased to threefold, twofold, and 100 -fold the normal values, respectively, during the following 4 weeks. Histologic examination of the liver disclosed extensive bile duct proliferation {{and the formation of}} periportal fibrosis, with only slight inflammation and necrosis. The distribution of the major components of the hepatic extracellular matrix was analyzed 2 weeks after bile duct ligation, using the indirect immunoperoxidase method. Fibrous septa were found to be strongly stained for collagens I, pro-III, III and IV, fibronectin, and laminin. The most intense staining was found in enlarged periportal areas, collagen IV and laminin being particularly abundant around newly formed bile ducts. These changes paralleled high steady-state levels of alpha 1 (I) and alpha 1 (IV) collagen and B 2 chain laminin mRNAs. Relief of the obstruction for 2 weeks resulted in a shift in the serum concentration of 5 '-nucleotidase, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin toward normal values. A dramatic resorption of bile duct proliferations and periportal fibrosis were observed. Three weeks after bile duct repermeabilization, immunohistochemical study showed that the pattern of distribution of extracellular matrix components was almost normal, except for collagen IV, which remained abundant in the sinusoids when compared with the normal liver. In parallel, the steady-state B 2 -chain laminin mRNA level became lower than in cholestatic livers, whereas alpha 1 (I) and alpha 1 (IV) mRNAs were almost undetectable. These results show that hepatic fibrosis induced by experimental extrahepatic cholestasis in rat disappears in less than 3 weeks after <b>relief</b> of bile <b>duct</b> obstruction, suggesting that an active degradation of matrix protein occurs, except for collagen IV in the sinusoid...|$|R
