40|$|Changes {{in public}} opinion and {{legislation}} {{have led to the}} general recognition that solid waste treatment practices must be changed. Solid-waste disposal by landfill is becoming increasingly expensive and regulated and no longer represents a long-term option in view of limited land space and environmental problems. Yard waste, a significant component of municipal solid waste, has previously not been separated from the municipal solid-waste stream. The treatment of municipal solid waste including yard waste must urgently be addressed because disposal via landfill will be prohibited by legislation. Separation of yard waste from municipal solid waste will be mandated in many localities, thus stressing the importance of scrutinizing current composting practices in treating grass clippings, leaves, and other yard residues. Yard waste poses a potential environmental health problem {{as a result of the}} widespread use of pesticides in lawn and tree care and the persistence of the residues of these chemicals in <b>plant</b> <b>tissue.</b> Yard <b>waste</b> containing pesticides may present a problem due to the recalcitrant and toxic nature of the pesticide molecules. Current composting processes are based on various modifications of either window systems or in-vessel systems. Both types of processes are ultimately dependent on microbial bioconversions of organic material to innocuous end products. The critical stage of the composting process is the thermophilic phase. The fate and mechanism of removal of pesticides in composting processes is largely unknown and in need of comprehensive analysis...|$|R

40|$|Cachexia is {{a common}} {{co-morbidity}} in cancer occurring in up to 80 % of patients {{depending on the type}} of cancer. Uric acid (UA), the end-product of the purine metabolism, is elevated in cachexia due to <b>tissue</b> <b>wasting</b> and up-regulated xanthine oxidase (XO) activity. High serum UA levels indicate increased XO dependent production of oxygen free radicals (ROS) and correlate with metabolic illness and poor survival. We hypothesized that XO- inhibition might reduce inflammatory signals accounting for <b>tissue</b> <b>wasting</b> and improve survival in experimental cancer cachexia. Animals were inoculated intra-peritoneally with AH- 130 hepatoma cells and treated with two XO-inhibitors: allopurinol (Allo, low and high dose 4 and 40 mg/kg/d) and its more effective active metabolite oxypurinol (Oxy, 4 and 40 mg/kg/d), or placebo for 15 days. Weight loss and <b>tissue</b> <b>wasting</b> of both fat and lean tissue (assessed by NMR-scanning) was reduced by both low (LD) and high dose (HD) Allo and low dose LD-Oxy, but not by HD-Oxy. A robust induction of XO-activity for generation of reactive oxygen species was seen in the placebo-group (assessed by electron paramagnetic spectroscopy), which was reduced by XO-inhibition. Increased ROS induced cytokine signaling, proteolytic activity and tissue degradation were all attenuated by XO inhibition. Survival was significantly and dose dependently improved. Food-intake and spontaneous locomotor activity were higher, indicating a higher quality of life. Inhibition of XO can reduce <b>tissue</b> <b>wasting</b> and improve survival in cancer cachexia and clearly clinical studies are needed...|$|R

40|$|The {{physiological}} responses of Myriophyllum spicatum to 2, 4 -D, diquat and copper were quantified using a <b>plant</b> <b>tissue</b> viability assay, and daily measures of dissolved oxygen and pH. Correlations of herbicide tissue residues to physiological response measures were determined {{and the relationship}} was used to develop exposure-response models. Diquat and copper had a greater effect on <b>plant</b> <b>tissue</b> viability than was observed for 2, 4 -D. Diquat produced greater reductions in dissolved oxygen concentrations and pH values than 2, 4 -D or copper. Copper exposure had the least effect on these parameters. Exposure-response models developed for 2, 4 -D predicted effective control at <b>plant</b> <b>tissue</b> residues ranging from 4000 to 4700 mg/kg. Aqueous exposure concentrations necessary to produce effective control <b>plant</b> <b>tissue</b> residues ranged from 0. 20 to 0. 40 mg/L. Exposure-response models developed for diquat predicted effective control at <b>plant</b> <b>tissue</b> residues ranging from 225 to 280 mg/kg. Aqueous exposure concentrations necessary to produce effective control <b>plant</b> <b>tissue</b> residues ranged from 0. 113 to 0. 169 mg/L. Exposure-response models developed for copper predicted effective control at <b>plant</b> <b>tissue</b> residues ranging from 680 to 790 mg/kg. Aqueous exposure concentrations necessary to produce effective control <b>plant</b> <b>tissue</b> residues ranged from 0. 32 to 0. 64 mg/L. Model predictions for 2, 4 -D, diquat and copper were within 0. 5 mg/L of the manufacturers' label recommendations for these herbicides. The use of laboratory microcosms in development of exposure-response models for diquat and copper produced results comparable to those using the larger-scale greenhouse systems. Diquat effectively controlled M. spicatum at lower tissue residues than 2, 4 -D or copper. In addition, initial aqueous exposure concentrations were also lower for diquat. Use of these models in field situations should be coupled with considerations of quantity of biomass present and environmental conditions, such as turbidity, in order to accurately calculate exposure concentrations necessary for effective tissue residues. Thus, {{the use of these}} models can be used to optimize the impact on the target species while minimizing exposure for nontarget species...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Histochemical {{staining}} of <b>plant</b> <b>tissues</b> with 4 -dimethylaminocinnamaldehyde (DMACA) or vanillin-HCl {{is widely}} used to characterize spatial patterns of proanthocyanidin accumulation in <b>plant</b> <b>tissues.</b> These methods are limited {{in their ability to}} allow high-resolution imaging of proanthocyanidin deposits. Results Tissue embedding techniques were used in combination with DMACA staining to analyze the accumulation of proanthocyanidins in Lotus corniculatus (L.) and Trifolium repens (L.) <b>tissues.</b> Embedding of <b>plant</b> <b>tissues</b> in LR White or paraffin matrices, with or without DMACA staining, preserved the physical integrity of the <b>plant</b> <b>tissues,</b> allowing high-resolution imaging that facilitated cell-specific localization of proanthocyanidins. A brown coloration was seen in proanthocyanidin-producing cells when <b>plant</b> <b>tissues</b> were embedded without DMACA staining and this was likely to have been due to non-enzymatic oxidation of proanthocyanidins and the formation of colored semiquinones and quinones. Conclusions This paper presents a simple, high-resolution method for analysis of proanthocyanidin accumulation in organs, tissues and cells of two plant species with different patterns of proanthocyanidin accumulation, namely Lotus corniculatus (birdsfoot trefoil) and Trifolium repens (white clover). This technique was used to characterize cell type-specific patterns of proanthocyanidin accumulation in white clover flowers at different stages of development. </p...|$|R

Soil and plant testing is routinely used for diagnosing iron (Fe) deficiency chlorosis in crops, with mixed results. This article presents {{an overview of the}} factors that influence soil and <b>plant</b> <b>tissue</b> testing results. It is clear that soil tests for Fe are dominantly influenced by soil pH, bicarbonate, and moisture regime rather soil test result per se.

Samples of natural and agricultural soils were processed and analyzed by Mehlich- 1 extraction and by DTPA. To quantify Ni in the <b>plant</b> <b>tissues,</b> samples were digested with nitric acid in a closed system in a microwave oven. The measurement was performed by inductively coupled plasma/optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES). There was a positive and significant correlation between the levels of available Ni in the soils subjected to Mehlich- 1 and DTPA extraction, while for <b>plant</b> <b>tissue</b> samples the Ni levels recovered were high and similar to the reference materials. The availability of Ni in some of the natural soil and <b>plant</b> <b>tissue</b> samples were lower than the limits of quantification. Concentrations of this micronutrient were higher in the soil samples in which Ni had been applied. Nickel concentration differed in the plant parts analyzed, with highest levels in the grains of soybean.
