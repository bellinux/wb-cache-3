5|$|As {{time went}} on Gould moved away from wedding punctuated {{equilibrium}} to allopatric speciation, <b>particularly</b> <b>as</b> evidence accumulated in support of other modes of speciation.

5|$|Thrud the Barbarian is a comics {{character}} {{created by}} Carl Critchlow in 1981.

5|$|A type of refined cooking {{developed}} in the late Middle Ages that set the standard among the nobility all over Europe. Common seasonings in the highly spiced sweet-sour repertory typical of upper-class medieval food included verjuice, wine and vinegar in combination with spices such as black pepper, saffron and ginger. These, along with {{the widespread use of}} sugar or honey, gave many dishes a sweet-sour flavour. Almonds were very popular as a thickener in soups, stews, and sauces, <b>particularly</b> <b>as</b> almond milk.|$|E
5|$|After Michael France {{delivered}} the original screenplay, Jeffrey Caine {{was brought in}} to rewrite it. Caine kept many of France's ideas but added the prologue prior to the credits. Kevin Wade polished the script and Bruce Feirstein added the finishing touches. In the film, the writing credit was shared by Caine and Feirstein, while France was credited with only the story, an arrangement he felt was unfair, <b>particularly</b> <b>as</b> he believed the additions made were not an improvement on his original version. Wade did not receive an official credit, but was acknowledged in the naming of Jack Wade, the CIA character he created.|$|E
5|$|As {{publishing}} {{began to}} change its form in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, large publishing houses pushed out small, independent booksellers. Johnson {{did not attempt to}} form or join one of these new firms. In the late 1790s and early 19th century, Johnson's business declined, <b>particularly</b> <b>as</b> his relatives, John Miles and Roland Hunter, began to take over the daily operations; Miles was uninterested in the business, and Hunter did not have Johnson's commercial sense or his ability to choose successful manuscripts. In January 1806, Johnson's premises were wracked by a second fire, destroying the building and all of his stock.|$|E

5|$|Author John Macklin {{includes}} an account in his 1965 book, Strange Destinies, of two green children {{who arrived in}} the Spanish village of Banjos in 1887. Many details of the story very closely resemble the accounts given of the Woolpit children, such as the name of Ricardo de Calno, the mayor of Banjos who befriends the two children, strikingly similar to Richard de Calne. It therefore seems that Macklin's story is an invention inspired by the green children of Woolpit, <b>particularly</b> <b>as</b> {{there is no record}} of any Spanish village called Banjos.|$|E
5|$|Before The Joshua Tree, U2 had {{released}} four studio {{albums and}} were an internationally successful band, <b>particularly</b> <b>as</b> a live act having toured {{every year in}} the 1980s.

U2 began writing new material in mid-1985 following the Unforgettable Fire Tour.|$|E

5|$|By the mid-15th century, Magna Carta {{ceased to}} occupy {{a central role in}} English {{political}} life, as monarchs reasserted authority and powers which had been challenged in the 100 years after Edward I's reign.

5|$|Labor's convincing win was not unexpected, <b>particularly</b> <b>as</b> infighting in the LCL {{had been}} ongoing {{for over a}} year. Friction was present {{throughout}} the campaign as well as before it, <b>particularly</b> <b>as</b> much of the donations were given directly to the LM. In the months before the election LCL members had thrown punches {{in the corridors of}} Parliament House. Internal battles between conservatives and LM members for party pre-selection were keenly contested. Around half of the LCL candidates were LM supporters and avoided mention of the LCL and its conservative leader Bruce Eastick in their pamphlets. Some of the LM faction candidates instead trumpeted Hall as their leader and printed books detailing their policies. There was also an incident where a LM function celebrating Wilson's win in the 1972 federal election clashed with Eastick's main policy speech. Eastick and his conservatives arrived at Wilson's dinner after they finished campaigning for the night, but then walked out when Wilson was delivering a speech calling for the LCL to be more tolerant of the diverse opinions within the party. Labor ran a sedate campaign, but made much of the internal LCL divisions.|$|E
5|$|Most {{scientists}} {{of the day}} recoiled to find that Cope's feud with Marsh had become front-page news. Those closest to the scientific fields under discussion, geology and vertebrate paleontology, certainly winced, <b>particularly</b> <b>as</b> they found themselves quoted, mentioned, or misspelled. The feud was not news to them, for it had lurked at their scientific meetings for two decades. Most of them had already taken sides.|$|E

Also, Penn State's tight end tandem, which struggled during non-conference play, needed to improve, <b>particularly</b> <b>as</b> Penn State had a young quarterback in Christian Hackenberg who would face tougher defenses in conference play.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the most}} famous of the early African Americans in the {{territory}} was George Bonga. He was born in Minnesota in 1802, his father Pierre Bonga the son of a freed slave and his mother a member of the Ojibwe tribe. Bonga was schooled in Montreal and eventually became a fur trader in the Northwest territories. He went on to serve as an interpreter in negotiations with the Ojibwe (<b>particularly</b> <b>as</b> a representative of Michigan Governor Lewis Cass). His brother Stephen served as the Ojibwe interpreter at Fort Snelling for the 1837 treaty.|$|E

By the end of 1918, the bank had recovered and surpassed CHF 1billion in total assets and grew to 2,000 employees by 1920. The impact of the stock market crash of 1929 and the Great Depression was severe, <b>particularly</b> <b>as</b> the Swiss franc suffered major devaluation in 1936. The bank saw its assets fall from a 1929 peak of CHF 1.6billion to its 1918 levels of CHF 1billion by 1936.|$|E
5|$|Several {{critics have}} made exactly the {{opposite}} interpretation, reading the poem as a comic critique of the Christianity of the time, <b>particularly</b> <b>as</b> embodied in the Christian chivalry of Arthur's court. In its zeal to extirpate all traces of paganism, Christianity had cut itself off from the sources of life in nature and the female. The green girdle represents all the pentangle lacks. The Arthurian enterprise is doomed unless it can acknowledge the unattainability of {{the ideals of the}} Round Table, and, for the sake of realism and wholeness, recognize and incorporate the pagan values represented by the Green Knight.|$|E
