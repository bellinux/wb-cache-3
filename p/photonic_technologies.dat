40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} hyper-media {{photonic}} information network (HM-PIN) concept {{as a candidate}} of innovative future networks based on <b>photonic</b> <b>technologies.</b> The HM-PIN having a universal network interface integrates a variety of information services: telecommunications, newspapers, magazines, TV broadcasts and the growing collection of information servers. This network fundamentally o#ers three items: (1) bi-directional real-time channels with 10 -Mbit/s-class or higher bit rate, (2) multipoint connections including multicasting /broadcasting, (3) high accessibility to information. These items are derived from {{the constraints of the}} conventional telephone networks and the Internet. By applying <b>photonic</b> <b>technologies,</b> the HM-PIN can be implemented as follows: The local network (the service platform) of the HM-PIN can be achieved by using a wavelength-division-multiplexing (WDM) broadcastand -select (B&S) architecture that o#ers broadband multipoint connections (one-to-many, many-to-many) based on an inherent full-mesh topology. The WDM B&S local network will be able to support 10, 000 to 100, 000 channels (each with 10 -Mbit/s or more bandwidth) by using optical and electrical multiplexing techniques. The backbone network can be constructed by combining photonic asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) switching systems and WDM transmission systems (including cross-connects). Two deployment scenarios of the HM-PIN (cost-oriented and serviceoriented deployment scenarios) are also described for smoothly introducing the HM-PIN even before the cost issue is solved. The HM-PIN based on <b>photonic</b> <b>technologies</b> will be a future network service platform that greatly enhances communication services...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the role that <b>photonics</b> <b>technology</b> can play in the implementation of modern broadband telecommunications networks. Starting from the continuous growth of bandwidth demand that is observed due to the Internet and multimedia applications, the attractive features of <b>photonics</b> <b>technology</b> that have rendered fibre the primary transmission medium are underlined and the modern optical multiplexing techniques are presented.
