5|$|Although much of Britain {{from this}} time is now beneath the sea, remains have been {{discovered}} on land that show horses were present, and being hunted, in this period. Significant finds include a horse tooth dating from between 55,000 and 47,000BC and horse bones dating from between 50,000 and 45,000BC, recovered from <b>Pin</b> <b>Hole</b> Cave, in the Creswell Crags ravine in the North Midlands; further horse remains from the same era have been recovered from Kent's Cavern. In Robin Hood Cave, also in Creswell Crags, a horse tooth was recovered dating from between 32,000 and 24,000BC; this cave has also preserved {{one of the earliest}} examples of prehistoric artwork in Britain– an engraving of a horse, on a piece of horse bone. A goddess figurine carved from horse bone and dating from around 23,000BC has been recovered from Paviland Cave in South Wales.|$|E

40|$|One cracked HPTR disc of an {{aeroengine}} {{was sent}} to the laboratory for analysis. The HPTR disc had developed a crack from one of the <b>pinning</b> <b>hole.</b> It was a through thickness crack and had propagated about 50 mm in the radial direction. Fractographic study revealed that the disc had cracked by fatigue and the fatigue crack had initiated at one of the <b>pinning</b> <b>holes.</b> Examination also revealed that the fatigue crack initiation was due to presence of a mechanical damage at this location. Similar damages were observed in the <b>pinning</b> <b>hole</b> elsewhere as well. These damages were mainly in the form of deep indentation marks and cut marks along the longitudinal direction of the hole...|$|R

25|$|The Glock 17P, 22P, and Glock 17R are all {{training}} pistols for practicing hand-to-hand combat, {{loading and}} unloading of the pistol. These Glocks are identical to a standard Glock 17/22 except for their red frame; some models have an inert barrel (without a chamber, thus preventing the accidental chambering of a live cartridge) and no firing <b>pin</b> <b>hole</b> in the breech face (preventing someone from using a live barrel with the training slide). The difference between models is that to perform a 'reset' of the trigger, a cycling of the slide has to be performed on the 17P/22P, {{but not on the}} 17R.|$|E
2500|$|Scientists {{working with}} high vacuum systems {{test for the}} {{presence}} of tiny pin holes in the apparatus (especially a newly blown piece of glassware) using high-voltage discharges produced by a small handheld Tesla coil. When the system is evacuated the high voltage electrode of the coil is played over the outside of the apparatus. At low pressures, air is more easily ionized and thus conducts electricity better than atmospheric pressure air. [...] Therefore, the discharge travels through any <b>pin</b> <b>hole</b> immediately below it, producing a corona discharge inside the evacuated space which illuminates the hole, indicating points that need to be annealed or reblown before they can be used in an experiment.|$|E
2500|$|In total, some 2,079 bones, tusks, antlers {{and teeth}} of Mammuthus primigenius (mammoth), Coelodonta antiquitatis(woolly rhinoceros), Rangifer tarandus (reindeer), Equus ferus (horse), Bison priscus (bison), Canis lupus (wolf), Vulpes vulpes or Alopex lagopus (red or Arctic fox) and [...] Ursus arctos (brown bear) were {{individually}} recorded and a further 25,000 bone, tooth and tusk fragments recovered. Feces of scavengers (possibly the spotted hyena Crocuta crocuta) were also {{recovered from the}} organic sediments. No articulated skeletons were found. The bone varied in condition with some bones extensively weathered and others exhibiting traces of gnawing by predator-scavengers. Bone fractures characteristic of marrow extraction by hominids have been identified {{on some of the}} reindeer and horse bones recovered from the deposit. The faunal remains recovered from the palaeochannel are typical of the <b>Pin</b> <b>Hole</b> Mammal Assemblage Zone of the Middle Devensian.|$|E
