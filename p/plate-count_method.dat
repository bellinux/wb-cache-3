Ecological studies on the disease {{in relation to the}} bacterial population in the rhizosphere, is still limited. The rhizobacteria could be exploited as the biocontrol agents to suppress the growth of the pathogen. This experiment was conducted to observe the abundance of fluorescent Pseudomonads, heat tolerant, and chitinolytic bacteria in the banana rhizosphere and assess their antagonistic activities against Foc in vitro. The bacterial population was calculated by serial dilution and <b>plate-count</b> <b>method.</b> The antagonistic test was observed using dual culture method. The average populations of non-fluorescent, heat tolerant, and chitinolytic bacteria in healthy banana rhizosphere were significantly higher compared with those in the diseased plants, while fluorescent Pseudomonads population did not show significant difference from control (the diseased plants). Among the fluorescent Pseudomonads, isolate KB 2 produced the widest inhibition zone against F. oxysporum f. sp. cubense, while among the isolates of chitinolytic and heat tolerant bacteria, isolate CH 4 and TSA 3 caused the highest inhibition of mycelial growth and the least mycelial growth of F. oxysporum f. sp. cubense at 3 days after inoculation (DAI), respectively.

The number of cells adhered to the surfaces increased with contact time reaching 5. 0 - 6. 1 log CDM. cm- 2 after 10 hours, which {{can be considered a}} well established adherence process. The number of adhered cells doubled in 29. 5 minutes and 23. 5 minutes on stainless steel and thin polyvinyl chloride-coated cloth, respectively. For the other surfaces, this value was 9. 8 minutes on average. Marble, granite, thick polyvinyl-coated cloth, double-faced rugous polyurethane, and silicone-coated cloth were not different (p < 0. 05) in their ability to adhere cells (CFU/cm²) after 2 and 10 hours. The surfaces that had higher percentage of similarity in the adhesion level and higher log CFU/cm² of adhered cells were double-faced rugous polyurethane, silicone-coated cloth, and granite.

Finally, the determination of the evolution of viable, the VBNC, and the dead cells allowed us to develop a segregated kinetic model to describe the yeast and the bacteria population dynamics and glucose consumption in batch cultures.

40|$|Two co-occurring ascidians of the Pacific subtidal, Polyclinum planum and Cystodytes lobatus, {{were found}} to exhibit remarkably {{different}} numbers of surface bacteria. On average, epibacterial densities on P. planum were 140 times greater than those on C lobatus as measured by <b>plate-counting</b> <b>methods.</b> Organic extracts of both ascidian species were tested for antimicrobial activities and effects on bacterial settlement. Bacterial settlement was measured using a new bioassay described in this paper. The results of the settlement bioassay clearly demonstrate that extracts of the little-colonized C. lobatus deter bacterial settlement while extracts of the heavily colonized P. planum induce settlement relative to the control. In addition to reducing bacterial settlement, extracts of C. lobatus colonies exhibited varying, but generally low, levels of antiraicrobial activity against, on average, one-half of the 36 strains of marine bacteria tested. On an interspecific level, including 11 ascidian species screened in a pilot study, fouling-deterring activities were correlated with epibacterial abundances while antimicrobial activity was not. It is concluded that the chemical control of bacterial settlement, possibly complemented by antimicrobial toxicity, provides an accurate model to explain the dramatically different bacterial abundance on the surfaces of the ascidian species studied. This investigation presents evidence that non-toxic metabolites influence bacterial settlement and, in this way, may function to regulate bacterial epibiosis on the surfaces of some marine invertebrates...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} {{an investigation of the}} potential for bioremediation of a soil heavily contaminated with hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)). The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine if the indigenous microbial populations in a soil heavily contaminated with Cr(VI) were capable of catalyzing Cr(VI) reduction, thereby decreasing Cr toxicity and bioavailability, and to determine how these populations compared to those in soils with no history of Cr(VI) contamination. ^ Chromium-containing industrial effluents are primarily responsible for environmental contamination by toxic and highly mobile, hexavalent chromium. The dilution <b>plate-count</b> <b>method,</b> using media amended with Cr(VI) at concentrations ranging from 0 to 1000 mg L- 1, was used to compare the sizes of Cr(VI) -resistant bacterial populations from a soil contaminated with 25, 100 mg kg- 1 total Cr (12, 400 mg kg- 1 Cr(VI)) to those isolated from a slightly contaminated soil (99. 6 mg kg- 1 total Cr) and two other soils without any history of Cr contamination. Bacterial populations resistant to 500 mg L- 1 Cr(VI) were isolated from all soils except the heavily contaminated soil. To determine whether Cr-resistant bacterial populations were indigenous to both the contaminated and the uncontaminated soils, enrichment cultures containing Cr(VI) at concentrations ranging from 0 to 1000 mg L- 1 were employed. Bacterial populations, as high as 105 CFU g- 1 soil, tolerant of 500 mg L- 1 Cr(VI) were isolated from all soils within 48 hr of enrichment suggesting that the presence of aerobic Cr(VI) -resistant bacterial populations is unrelated to contamination levels or contamination history. ^ Soil containing 25, 100 mg kg- 1 total Cr (12, 400 mg kg- 1 Cr(VI)) was collected from a Superfund site and used in batch culture studies to evaluate the potential for aerobic reduction of Cr(VI) by the indigenous bacterial population.

Using our model organism Bacillus cereus, a notorious Gram-positive food spoilage and pathogenic spore-forming bacterium, a strategy will be described that allows for identification of biomarkers for robustness. First an overview will be presented of its two-component systems that generally include a transmembrane sensor histidine kinase and its cognate response regulator, allowing rapid and robust responses to fluctuations in the environment. The role of the multisensor hybrid kinase RsbK and the PP 2 C-type phosphatase RsbY system in activation of the general stress sigma factor sB is highlighted. An extensive comparative analysis of transcriptional landscapes derived from B. cereus exposed to mild stress conditions such as heat, acid, salt and oxidative stress, revealed that, amongst others sB regulated genes were induced in most conditions tested. The information derived from the transcriptome data was subsequently implemented in a framework for identifying and selecting cellular biomarkers at their mRNA, protein and/or activity level, for mild stressinduced microbial robustness towards lethal stresses. Exposure of unstressed and mild stress-adapted cells to subsequent lethal stress conditions (heat, acid and oxidative stress) allowed for quantification of the robustness advantage provided by mild stress pretreatment using the <b>plate-count</b> <b>method.</b> The induction levels of the selected candidate-biomarkers, sB protein, catalase activity and transcripts of certain proteases upon mild stress treatment, were significantly correlated to mild stress-induced enhanced robustness towards lethal thermal, oxidative and acid stresses, and were therefore suitable to predict these adaptive traits.

Here, we report a bioconjugated nanoparticle-based bioassay for in situ pathogen quantification down to single bacterium within 20 min. The bioconjugated nanoparticle provides an extremely high fluorescent signal for bioanalysis and can be easily incorporated with biorecognition molecules, such as antibody. The antibody-conjugated nanoparticles can readily and specifically identify a variety of bacterium, such as Escherichia coli O 157 :H 7, through antibody–antigen interaction and recognition. The single-bacterium-detection capability within 20 min has been confirmed by the <b>plate-counting</b> <b>method</b> and realized by using two independent optical techniques.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to develop a rapid assay based on a nucleic acid double-staining by using two fluorochromes [SYBR Green II RNA gel stain (SYBR-II) and propidium iodide (PI) ] (Gregori et al., 2001) to {{distinguish}} viable from damaged and dead cells of Lactobacillus sakei strains after exposure to heat and acid stresses. Cells were discriminated in density plots of green fluorescence versus red fluorescence. After single labeling firstly with SYBR-II and then with PI, cytograms showed two bacterial clusters, live and dead cells. Moreover, dual staining differentiated cell populations in different physiological states, alive cells with intact membranes, an intermediate physiological state that corresponded to damaged cells that are still alive but with injured membranes, so with even a recovery ability, and dead cells killed because of a permanent membrane damage. This application was validated against the classical <b>plate-counting</b> <b>method</b> and the comparison of two methods produced interesting results. In the traditional method, the removal of the stress and the incubation of the cells in favourable growth conditions caused an increase of colony counts that corresponding to the recovery ability, attributed to damaged cells of the cytofluorimetric analyses. This study evidenced that, due to the complexity of the physiological status and heterogeneity of bacterial cells in a culture, especially after stress, multiparameter analysis is preferable. This approach allowed to achieve information about the dynamics and physiological heterogeneity of microbial populations and to monitoring changes in bacterial behaviour after exposure to different stresses. This is the first report about the use of double staining cytofluorimetric analysis on an important food bacteria as Lactobacillus sakei. This novel assay has potential for physiological research on lactic acid bacteria and for application in the food industry.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a rapid and sensitive {{strategy for the}} absolute and simultaneous quantification of specific pathogenic strain and total bacterial cells in a mixture. A laboratory-built compact, high-sensitivity, dual channel flow cytometer (HSDCFCM) was modified to enable dual fluorescence detection. A bacterial cell mixture comprising heat-killed pathogenic Escherichia coli E. coli 0 157 : H 7 and harmless E. coli DH 5 alpha {{was used as a}} model system. Pathogenic E. coli 0 157 :H 7 cells were selectively labeled by red fluorescent probe via antibody-antigen interaction, and all bacterial cells were stained with membrane-permeable nucleic acid dye that fluoresces green. When each individual bacterium passes through the interrogating laser beam, E. coli 0 157 : 117 emits both red and green fluorescence, while E. coli DH 5 alpha. exhibits only green fluorescence. Because the fluorescence burst generated from each individual bacterial cell was easily distinguished from the background, accurate enumeration and consequently absolute quantification were achieved for both pathogenic and total bacterial cells. By using this strategy, accurate counting of bacteria at a density above 1. 0 x 10 (5) cells/mL can be accomplished with 1 min of data acquisition time after fluorescent staining. Excellent correlation between the concentrations measured by the HSDCFCM and the conventional <b>plate-counting</b> <b>method</b> were obtained for pure-cultured E. coli O 157 :H 7 (R- 2 = 0. 9993) and E. coli DH 5 alpha (R- 2 = 0. 9998). Bacterial cell mixtures with varying proportions of E. coli O 157 :H 7 and E. coli DH 5 alpha were measured with good ratio correspondence. We applied the established approach to detecting artificially contaminated drinking water samples; E. coli 0157 :H 7 of 1. 0 x 101 cells/mL were accurately quantified upon sample enrichment. It is believed that the proposed method will find wide applications in many fields demanding bacterial identification and quantification.
