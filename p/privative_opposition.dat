40|$|Abstract. Semantic {{parameters}} of agency and affectedness {{have long been}} known to affect the realization of case-marking. This paper proposes an approach which decomposes agency and affectedness into semantic properties, loosely based on Dowty’s proto-role theory, but conceived in terms of <b>privative</b> <b>opposition</b> and organized into a lattice. This results in a structured framework which is capable of modelling both case systems and case alternations, as is demonstrated by an account of subject-marking in Hindi/Urdu. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{argues that}} two {{productive}} applicatives in Mapudungun, viz. -(l) el and -ñma, can be labeled benefactive and malefactive respectively, {{but only in}} a superficially impressionistic way. Based on a detailed survey {{of the literature on}} the language, as well as on synchronic evidence and some tentative internal reconstruction, I suggest that the yield of -ñma was originally probably neutral with respect to benefaction, and that it still is in some uses of this suffix. According to this account, the appearance of (l) el-applicatives (probably from elu- ‘give’ or el- ‘set’) gave rise to a <b>privative</b> <b>opposition</b> between the meaning of both morphemes with many bivalent predicates...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to propose an etymological {{relationship}} between cast. (gal. -port.) buscar and lat. poscere ‘to ask for’. From a semantic point of view, since both verbs imply a <b>privative</b> <b>opposition</b> of terms meaning ‘to try to obtain’ (cast. buscar-pedir; lat. quaerere-petere-poscere), closely related with the verbs of volition (cast. querer, lat. uelle), the loss of uelle in castilian and the choice of quaerere to take its place could have caused the meaning of the ‘to try to obtain’ verbs to change, and, more specifically, the verb poscere to stop meaning ‘to ask for’ in order to mean ‘to look for’. The final form sprang from the mutual interference of the first persons of the simple present of poscere (posco) and of a verb imported from Europe into the north-western section of the Iberian Peninsula in the 11 th century, boscare-buscare (bosco-busco), which meant ‘to do something in the forest’...|$|E

This paper introduces fuzzy <b>privative</b> and <b>opposition</b> <b>privative</b> in traditional knowledge representation. It takes a power {{transmission and distribution}} program for example, adopts a ratio function of distance to define the fuzzy set's member functions. Moreover, one confirmed method is presented to define the λ value {{as well as the}} threshold τ value in fuzzy production rules．Finally it discusses fuzzy knowledge reasoning by a specific example.

40|$|Polish {{personal}} nouns demonstrate {{not only}} grammatical features of gender (selective gender) {{but also the}} -sex of the designation (natural reference gender). Only masculine and feminine nouns have natural gender. These nouns form oppositions. We distinguish between privative oppositions: dyrektor : dyrektorka, grubas : grubaska, and equipollent oppositions: murzyn î murzynka, blondyn : blondynka, kelner : kelnerka. There are certain correlations between them. In <b>privative</b> <b>oppositions</b> masculine nouns are the non-distinctive elements. They frequently {{play the role of}} indexes in both oppositional reference genders. It refers, first of all, to names of jobs, positions, titles end to the use in plural. The use of masculine nouns as the index of both genders (i. e. masculine and feminine) gives such homonims as: dyrektor 1 : dyrektor 2. In such homonym pairs the-lexeme dyrektor 1 is masculine and dyrektor 2 is feminine derived from dyrektor 1. Zadanie pt.

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} {{linguistic}} phenomena at suprasentential level. In particular, it looks into how textual analysis {{can be enhanced}} by supplementing the Parisian programme of interpretive semantics, as devised by François Rastier, namely his theory of isotopies, with elementary aspects of topic-focus articulation (TFA), as well as contextual boundness (CB) and contextual non-boundness (CN), as elaborated within the Praguian linguistic tradition (V. Mathesius, P. Sgall, E. Hajičová, F. Daneš, J. Firbas), and how the descriptive power of the former can be increased by the latter. In this respect, {{it is argued that}} two types of TFA phenomena interact during any process of textual interpretation: those of topic-focus articulation at the level of sentence, conceiving lexical morphs as thematic (T) and/or rhematic (R), as well as contextually bound (CB) and/or contextually non-bound (CN), and those of topic-focus articulation at the level of isotopy, with each isotopy being conceived as structured around a center (an abstract semantic unit) and periphery (a span of concrete utterances). Two types of such interaction are described, each defined by either correlation, or non-correlation of the CB and CN semes at the levels of isotopy and sentence, respectively: thematic-rhematic isotopy, induced by co-occurrence of the CB seme of the center and the CB seme of the periphery; and thematic-rhematic allotopy (i. e. non-isotopy), induced by co-occurrence of the CB seme of the center and the CN seme of the periphery. Since topic-focus isotopies and allotopies can be perceived as members of <b>privative</b> <b>oppositions,</b> a tentative system of such oppositions is presented, based on linguistic analyses of selected European Commission texts drafted in English and their Czech translations. The author’s ultimate intention is to show that the semantic features of topic-focus articulation at the sentential and suprasentential levels are both structurally parallel and functionally complementary...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Case {{attraction}} {{has stood}} as a puzzling, and elusive, oddity of older Indo-European languages. This paper focuses on attraction in Ancient Greek, establishing both the regularity {{of the operation}} and its underlying motivation. A novel method is proposed for grounding case {{in terms of a}} feature-based representation of agentivity properties, loosely based on Dowty’s proto-role theory, but reformulated in terms of <b>privative</b> <b>opposition</b> and hierarchically organized via a lattice. This structure is then used to model the case system of Ancient Greek and derive a hierarchical ordering on the case system in terms of agentivity. Modelling the interaction between this hierarchy and the other factors involved in case attraction in the Optimality Theory framework yields a full solution, predicting both its distribution and frequencies therein. The attempt to describe case as a stable, syntactic phenomenon is belied by instances of what is known as case conflict. This paper investigates a particular type of case conflict, case attraction, which involves relative pronouns and their antecedents. Case attraction has long been seen as an exception to the general rule of case assignment, but I will argue in what follows that, once the conditions under which case attraction are clarified, and a given case’s relation to semantic content is secured, case attraction must no longer be seen as an aberration, but rather as consistent with the general principles of case assignment. The organization of the paper is as follows. I begin by summarizing the data from Ancient Greek, paying particular attention to the distribution of the phe-nomenon and the frequencies therein. Case attraction will be seen as crucially linked to the thematic, or agentivity, properties associated with a given case, and a general framework for connecting case and agentivity via a lattice struc-ture will be exposed in section 2. The case system of Ancient Greek is then mapped upon the lattice, determining a hierarchical relation on the case sys-tem. Section 3 unifies the foregoing analysis of case attraction with the semantic agentivity properties to account for case attraction and its distribution within the Optimality Theory (OT) framework...|$|E
40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. May 2010. Major: Linguistics. Advisors: Dr. Nancy Stenson and Dr. Jeanette Gundel. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); ix, 268 pages. Heritage grammars, linguistic varieties {{emerging in the}} context of intergenerational language loss, are known to diverge from the corresponding full-fledged baseline varieties in principled and systematic ways, as typically illustrated by errors made by heritage speakers in production. This dissertation examines covert restructuring of aspect in heritage Russian, a grammatical reorganization of the perfective-imperfective opposition not manifested in overt errors. The aspectual system instantiated in acrolectal varieties of heritage Russian is shown to exhibit signs of covert divergence from the baseline system at the interface between syntax and discourse-pragmatics, manifested in a reduction of pragmatically-conditioned functions of the imperfective aspect with total single events. This emerging restriction leads to a gradual shift from a <b>privative</b> aspectual <b>opposition</b> in baseline Russian, where imperfective is the unmarked member, to an opposition of the equipollent type. Experimental evidence presented suggests that heritage speakers differ from baseline Russian speakers in their use, acceptability ratings, and accuracy of interpretation of the imperfective aspect. In Russian, both aspects are compatible with completed events; however, aspectual competition is resolved in favor of the imperfective in the presence of discourse-pragmatic triggers that condition the general-factual functions of the imperfective: statement of fact, annulled result, thematicity and backgrounding. Assuming a multi-level approach to aspect, I maintain that the two aspectual systems converge on the level of the verbal predicate, where aspectual values of activities and accomplishments reflect compositional telicity, but diverge on the level of sentential aspect, where the contribution of telicity may be overridden by grammatical aspectual operators and discourse-pragmatic aspectual triggers. The restructuring of aspect in advanced heritage grammars affects the highest level of sentential structure, a domain in which syntactic information is mapped onto discourse-pragmatic information (the C-domain). In addressing the role of linguistic input in heritage language acquisition, the dissertation examines additional data from bilingual Russian-English speakers, including parents of heritage speakers. While bilingual speakers pattern with monolingual controls on comprehension tests, they differ from monolinguals in production of the imperfective with total single events, suggesting that competence divergence in advanced heritage grammars may be linked, across generations, to impoverished performance on C-domain properties...|$|R
