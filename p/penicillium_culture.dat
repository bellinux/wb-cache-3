It has been briefly reported by Gitterman to inhibit the cytopathogenic effect of Semliki Forest virus grown in chick embryo fibroblast cell culture (5). Obviously, isolation of helenine is of great interest in both practical and theoretical virology; however, a serious effort of Lewis et al. has resulted only in partial purification (6). One major difficulty was the wide fluctuation in antiviral activity of various crude helenine preparations freshly harvested from peniclllium cultures grown under presumably identical conditions.

Two atoxigenic strains of Aspergillus flavus, AF 36 and Afla-Guard, are labeled for its management. The purpose of this study was to measure differences in the ability of these strains to sporulate and to track movement of their conidia in corn and cotton fields. Sporulation was evaluated by incubating the two strains on their commercial formulations (inoculated on cereal grains) at six constant humidity levels ranging from 0 - 100 %, using closed chambers with saturated salt solutions. Conidial production by Afla-Guard was 3 -fold greater than that of AF 36 at 100 % humidity. Sporulation of the two strains was also evaluated on one substrate by inoculating their conidia on sterile, hulled barley. After 3 days, there was a 234 -fold increase in conidia recovered from the barley inoculated with Afla-Guard, compared with a 21 -fold increase in conidia recovered from the AF 36 -inoculated barley. These data suggest that the Afla-Guard strain sporulates better than the AF 36 strain, which may be a factor in effectiveness for biological control. An in vitro de-Wit competition experiment showed that sporulation by the Afla-Guard strain was not affected by co-inoculation with either AF 36 or the wildtype NRRL 3357 toxin producing strain. To measure conidial movement, an Afla-Guard nitrate non-utilizing mutant colonizing autoclaved corn seed, was placed at one point in a field of cotton and corn. For detection, aliquots washed from leaf samples were plated onto a medium containing potassium chlorate. The mutant was recovered at a maximum distance of 6. 4 m in corn fields along the same row and as far as 10. 2 m across rows from the point source. In cotton fields, the mutant was recovered at 9. 1 meters along the same row and 6. 1 m across rows from the point source. There was no recovery at 24. 3 m from the point source - the maximum distance evaluated. The experiment was repeated in a second year with similar results. These data suggest that plots in field trials may not need wide separation in order to avoid cross contamination. To assess the viability of a toxigenic and atoxigenic strain of A. flavus over time, polycarbonate packets containing conidia and sclerotia of both strains were buried in Ships Clay soil with the matric potential held constant at - 24 kPa or - 154 kPa. After 10 months, viable conidia were recovered in all treatments. After 14 months, viability of the atoxigenic strain incubated at - 154 kPa ?m was lost, while other treatments remained viable. Ears of corn were inoculated via silk channel at different stages of silk senescence. Sclerotia were enumerated from the same plants following harvest of the crop. Sclerotial production by A. flavus was greatest from ears with silks inoculated at senescence, compared with inoculation when silks were green. The isolation frequency of Penicillium sp. from surface-sterilized kernels at harvest was the highest from ears that were inoculated with A. flavus when silks were fresh, as compared with A. flavus inoculation of ears with senescent silks. A Fusarium and Penicillium species was isolated from harvested kernels, and their sterile Czapek-Dox broth culture filtrates were tested for their effect on development of three strains of A. flavus on agar. The Penicillium broth filtrate greatly reduced sclerotial numbers relative to the control and the Fusarium filtrate (P< 0. 05). When A. flavus was grown in the presence of autoclaved <b>Penicillium</b> <b>culture</b> filtrate, there was no effect on sclerotial production. The Penicillium filtrate increased the rate of radial hyphal growth of the A. flavus isolates on agar compared to the control and the Fusarium culture filtrate. ...|$|E

As a result, we urgently need effective alternatives to the use of antibiotics. The overall aim {{of the study was to}} add further our knowledge of some of these alternatives to antibiotics, concentrating on maggot therapy, apitherapy and to a lesser extent mycotherapy. The nature of the exceptionally high non-peroxide antibacterial activity of Leptospermum scoparium Manuka honey was further investigated. It was shown that this activity is unlikely to be due to accumulated residual hydrogen peroxide and the microflora of bees and honey probably act as a source of any non–hydrogen peroxide inhibitory components. Tregothnan English Manuka did not show any exceptionally high non-peroxide antibacterial activity compared to New Zealand Manuka. 	 Studies on the mechanisms of the antibacterial activity of high medical grade New Zealand Manuka (UMF 20 +, 25 +) against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and (SEM) and TEM studies on the morphological effects on (MRSA) and Escherichia coli were conducted. It was observed that Gram-positive and Gram-negative cells were not uniformly affected by Manuka honey, Gram-positive bacteria were more sensitive and had less MICs and MBCs values. Time killing assays confirmed the bactericidal effect of Manuka. 16 S rRNA sequencing technique confirmed that that C. botulinum spores are not likely to be detectable in tested medical grade New Zealand Manuka honey samples. Leptospermum scoparium essential oil showed a marked inhibitory activity against Gram-positive bacteria, including MRSA, M. phlei and B. subtilis;significant antifungal activity against Trichophyton terrestre was also observed. The in vitro antibacterial activity of tamarind (Tamarindus indica) was evaluated and compared with 25 + Manuka honey. Data obtained from the agar diffusion, MICs, MBCs values and time to kill study show that tamarind exhibits a stronger antimicrobial effect against the six tested bacteria and C. albicans than do high medical grade manuka honeys. It is suggested that an autoclaved, sterilized, commercially available tamarind paste should be clinically evaluated for the treatment of wounds and indolent ulcers which are infected with bacteria, notably MRSA. In relation to maggot therapy, evidence is provided to support the anti-Mycobacterium activity of Calliphora quadrimaculata maggot gases; unfortunately, attempts to isolate these gases were unsuccessful. For first time, in vitro evidence (such as antifungal and yeast (S. cerevisiae (BY 4742) GFP ingestion ability), was provided to support the use of Lucilia sericata maggot to control fungi involved in superficial fungal infections, i. e. fungal burn wound infections and dermatomycoses. A study was made to determine if Mycoplasmas can be detected in the hemolymph of maggots of Calliphora quadrimaculata and Lucilia sericata maggots by using Mycoplasma, EZ-PCR Mycoplasma Test Kit. Mycoplasmas were not detected in any of the maggot samples tested. These observations suggest that Calliphora quadrimaculata and Lucilia sericata larvae are unlikely to act as transmission vectors for Mycoplasmas. Another antibiotic-alternative called mycotherapy (an approach which as yet has not be reinstated in medicine) was also studied.

CONCLUSION: This study provides information on the usability of selected strains of P. nalgiovense that could support the development of sensory properties of mould-ripened soft cheese. The cheese with the culture N 2 had the best flavour after 35 days of storage. Moreover, this strain showed the lowest bitterness in comparison with the other used P. nalgiovense cultures.

Parameter optimization of culture composition using Test plan L 16, {{available in the}} form of an orthogonal array and software for automatic design and analysis of the experiments, both based on Taguchi approach was performed in MAP production process by Penicillium brevicompactum ATCC 16024 in a batch submerged culture. Optimal levels of key parameters including glucose, enzymaticaly hydrolyzed casein, methionine and glycine concentrations were determined. Optimum glucose, enzymaticaly hydrolyzed casein, methionine and glycine concentrations were obtained 80, 25, 1. 2 and 20 g. L, respectively. 1 Theoretically expected and also experimentally actual obtained mycophenolic acid concentrations under the optimal conditions were 2. 025 and 1. 995 g. L, respectively with a good consistency as 98. 5 %. Analysis 1 showed the glucose concentration was found to be the most significant factor as well as glycine concentration was the less important factor on MPA production in the investigated process.

The kinetics of enzyme production was investigated using PuOC alone in the range from 13 to 168 h, with moisture contents varying from 44 % the ability to grow and produce Exo-p activity on this substrate, reaching a maximum value of 1451. 75 U/g. d. w PuOC by the 5 th day of fermentation. Fermentation experiments indicated that the water activity (aw) influenced the enzyme production. A medium with aw 0. 932 and the fermentation time of 5 days were selected, as these conditions resulted in the highest pectolytic activity and were used for further investigation. A next step in this research was to examine the effect of the substrate combination, PuOC with wheat bran (WB), in different ratios. The addition of WB as carbon sources was found to have a significant influence on the enzymes yields. Exo-p activities were the highest with initial water activity of a w 0. 932 and PuOC supplementation with WB (1 : 0. 67) ...|$|R
40|$|On {{the species}} of the fungi Penicillium verrucosum grown on liquid nutritious base, {{according}} to Czapek and on {{a variation of the}} same nutritious base with detergent MERIX ('Merima', Kruševac) and individual components of the same detergent: sodium tripolyphosphate and ethoxyled oleyl-cetyl alcohol in a concentration of 0. 1 %, the following analyses were performed: pH, redox potential, proteolytic activity, the quantity of free and total organic acids, amino acids, proteins and total biomass. We can notice from the obtained results that the detergent, sodium tripoly-phosphate and ethoxyled oleyl-cetyl alcohol in a concentration of 0. 1 % had an inhibitory effect on protein bioproduction and total biomass on the 8 th day from the day of inoculation, while the production of free and total organic acids was partially or significantly stimulated by the presence of the detergent, sodium tripoly-phosphate and ethoxyled oleyl-cetyl alcohol in a concentration of 0. 1 %. With aging of the fungus <b>culture</b> <b>Penicillium</b> verrucosum, the exception was free organic acids production which was, with the age of the culture, partially inhibited by the detergent. Proteolytic activity of the fungi Penicillium verrucosum had a slightly variable value during the experimental period with added nutritions media to the detergent, sodium tripoly-phosphate and ethoxyled oleyl-cetyl alcohol in a concentration of 0. 1 % with a slight aberration in relation to the control in some phases of the fungal growth...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} is {{concerned}} with the optimization of the cultural conditions of locally isolated mould cultures for the production of cellulose enzymes by both surface culture and submerged culture methods in conical flasks and stirred fomenter. The mould cultures after their isolation and screening were identified and found to be the species of trichoderma, Aspergilllus, <b>penicillium,</b> Rhizohus. The <b>cultures</b> of trichoderma viride GCB- 20, Aspergillus niger GCB- 5 however were best producer of cellulases. The agricultural byproducts such as wheat bran, bagasse, rice straw and wheat straw etc. were evaluated as substrate by both mould culture for the production of enzymes. Of all the substrates tested, however, wheat, bran was found to be an ideal substrate providing all the nutrients for the synthesis of cellulases. The parameters in solid state fermentation such as depth of wheat bran and its partial replacement with other agricultural by-products such as wheat straw, rice straw or bagasse, moisture content i. e. ratio of wheat bran to water, selection of diluents, extraction of enzymes and rate of fermentation were optimized.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the work is to {{establish}} some rational modes of receipt of the food fibers (FF) from secondary resources of vegetable raw materials. Studying chemical properties of research objects has been carried out by standard methods in accordance with the GOST 26183 – 84, GOST 7636 – 85, GOST 25555. 3 – 82, GOST 28561 – 90. Determination of reducing and not reducing sugars content has been performed by the cyanide method; determination of pectinaceous substances' content – by the calcium-pectate method. As an enzyme medicine the earlier not studied complex enzyme medicine of proteolytic and amilolytic action of Bacillus subtilis and <b>Penicillium</b> emersonii <b>cultures</b> has been tested. Studying heat stability of complex enzyme medicine has been carried out at varying of the hydrolysis temperature from 40 °C to 80 °C. The fractional composition of carbohydrates of secondary resources of aubergines, vegetable marrows and onions conversion has been researched. Content of FF (cellulose, gemitsellyuloza, pectin) in waste from conversion of vegetable marrows constitutes 42 % of general content of carbohydrates, aubergines – 39, 2 %, and onion – 30, 4 %. Chemical and carbohydrate structures of secondary resources of vegetable raw materials allow consider them as FF source, and also shows feasibility of their conversion without fractionation by the form of secondary resources. The rational modes of hydrolysis of vegetable raw materials secondary resources' mix for removing the accompanying organic compounds have been determined. The maximum proteolytic activity of enzyme medicine takes place at the temperature of 50 °C, amilolytic activity – at 70 °C. In case of рН increase from 2. 0 to 6. 0 proteolytic and amilolytic activity reaches the maximum and constitutes 94 % and 95 % respectively, in case of further increase рН the activity decreases. The rational value of рН of reactionary environment when carrying out enzymatic hydrolysis in the presence of enzyme medicine is рН equal to 6. 0. The received results allow set the rational modes of enzyme medicine effect (temperature and рН) necessary for carrying out enzymatic hydrolysis of secondary resources of aubergines, vegetable marrows and onion processing...|$|R
40|$|Penicillium nordicum is {{the main}} {{ochratoxin}} A (OTA) -producing fungal species isolated from artisanal sausages of different areas of Italy and other European countries. P. nordicum grows on and produces OTA in the sausage casing, thereby posing a health risk to Italian consumers, who commonly eat both the meat and casing of artisanal sausages. Different methods have been proposed to eliminate OTA and P. nordicum on the casings, including brushing, brushing and washing, the use of fungal starter <b>cultures</b> (<b>Penicillium</b> nalgiovense) and gaseous ozone. The {{aim of this study}} was to compare these methods with regard to eliminating the risk of OTA contamination in sausages. Three concentrations of gaseous ozone were assessed, i. e. 0. 5, 1. 0 and 1. 5 mg/l. Only 1. 5 mg/l prevented P. nordicum growth and production of OTA in sausages without influencing the physicochemical parameters and the sensory characteristic of the products. Application of this gaseous ozone concentration was then compared to the other methods, i. e. brushing, brushing and washing, a one-step starter culture of P. nalgiovense (inoculation after casing) and a two-step starter culture (inoculation after both casing and drying). The results obtained showed that only the use of gaseous ozone and a two-step starter culture of P. nalgiovense achieved complete inhibition of P. nordicum growth and OTA production. However, sensory analysis of the treated sausages showed that the use of starter cultures was the best method...|$|R
40|$|In 1998 - 2001, the {{healthiness}} of thyme {{cultivated in}} the region of Lublin was examined. Surveys were made on the one-year-old plantations of thyme at a stage of 6 -week-old seedlings and just before the first harvest of the crop, {{as well as on the}} two-year-old plantations in spring and before the last harvest. The percentage of the plants showing fungal disease symptoms and the index of infection with fungi were determined. The fungi were isolated from superficially disinfected plant fragments namely from roots, bases of stem and leaves, separately, using mineral culture medium. PDA and SNA media were used to culture Fusarium spp., malt-agar and Czapek-Dox ones to <b>culture</b> <b>Penicillium</b> spp. and malt-agar, oat-agar and cherry-agar ones to culture Phoma spp. The percentage of plant infected with the fungi ranged within 12. 18 and 23. 05, in case of the one-year-old plantations, and within 29. 91 and 43. 65 in the two-year-old ones, whereas values of the index of infection ranged within 11. 56 and 24. 69 and within 20. 75 and 43, 28, respectively. Necroses were observed on roots and base of stems on one-year-old and two-year-old plantations, but in the last period of vegetation of thyme close to harvest. very often stems and leaves showed symptoms of a complete necrosis. It was found that base of stems and roots of thyme in the first and the second year of cultivation were colonized by a complex of pathogenic fungi:Fusarium spp., Rhizoctonia solani, Thielaviopsis basicola were obtained from the major part of diseased plants. Among the Fusarium species colonizing bases of stems F. culmorum, F. avenaceum, F. equiseti and F. oxysporum dominated, but from roots of thyme most often F. oxysporum, F. equiseti and F. culmorum were isolated. From stems, and particularly from leaves of thyme showing dark spots, commonly Alternaria alternata was obtained. On the other hand, shoots and leaves, but rarely roots of thyme, were colonized by various species of Phoma, particularly by Phoma exigua var. exigua. Colletotrichum gleosporioides occurred rarely on thyme in the area surveyed...|$|R
