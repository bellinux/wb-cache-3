Through analysis of North Atlantic sector submarine mass movements, a conceptual model of continental slope failure is proposed and examined against the Peach slide case study. Situated on the eastern flank of the Rockall Trough, the Barra Fan is subject to cyclonic ocean circulation and has experienced growth since continental uplift during the mid-Pliocene. Surface and shallow-subsurface morphology of the fan is determined using pinger sub-bottom <b>profile</b> (<b>paper</b> records scanned and converted to SEGY format), sidescan sonar and multibeam echosounder data. A number of different acoustic facies are mapped, including: contourites, hemipelagites and debris flows. Analysis of gravity core 56 /- 10 / 239 identifies a debris flow containing material of glacial age and AMS ¹⁴C dating of planktonic foraminifera constrain emplacement prior to 11. 9 ka cal BP. Reference to additional sediment cores located in the Barra Fan region (MD 95 - 2006 and 56 /- 10 / 36) allows {{the development of a}} chronology for the contourites and hemipelagites interpreted during geophysical investigation. This allows constraint of two periods of slope failure during the late Pleistocene: the first between 21 and 20 ka cal BP, shortly after the British ice sheetʼs maximum advance; and the second between 12 and 11 ka cal BP at the termination of the Younger Dryas stadial. Processes similar to those on the Norwegian continental margin seem to operate on the northwest British continental margin, the morphology and setting of the Peach slide is similar to Storegga and Trænadjupet, suggesting that similar processes initiated failure. Important roles seem to be played by contouritic and glaciogenic sedimentation, producing excess pore pressure in the fanʼs sediments with fluid expulsion visible in the acoustic data...|$|E

Senior thesis, Kansas State Agricultural College, 1907. Introduction: The object in these tests {{was to determine}} the pull of certain loads on dry and muddy roads of different grades and surfaces. The following roads were selected on which the tests were to be made; the road that leads from shops to East college entrance oiled road (Manhattan Avenue) from East college entrance to Fremont street; Fremont street from South end of oiled road to 9 th street; South on 9 th street to Leavenworth street; East on Leavenworth street to 2 nd street; South on 2 nd street to Humbolt street; West on Humbolt street to 9 th street; North on 9 th street to Fremont street; East on Fremont street to 2 nd street; North on 2 nd street to Moro street, West on Moro street to oiled road (Manhattan Avenue); North on oiled road to North end; West from North end of oiled road to gate just North of college barns; from this gate up to shop to starting point. These were supposed to be fair samples of different kinds of road, A survey was then made of these roads and a profile of them plotted on standard <b>profile</b> <b>paper</b> to a convenient scale from which the grades of the road may be obtained. The recording traction dynamometer used in connection with these tests was built in the Kansas State Agricultural College shops, A full description with detail and assembly drawings of the instrument is given in the designers' thesis. A few minro changes were made {{in the construction of the}} dynamometer and some new parts were added. The main axle was shortened so that the wheels would track with a farm wagon. The spring that was to be placed in the supply drum was omitted and a brake shoe was substituted in its place. Instead of using one edge of the paper as a zero line, a marker was attached to the machine to make a zero or base line and in which the movable pencil would lie when there was no pull.

A major factor in the rising rate of cesarean deliveries in the United States is the large number of elective repeat cesareans performed on women with a history of cesarean sections. Until the 1980 's, physicians were instructed that women with a history of cesarean section should only deliver by cesarean in any future pregnancies because the uterine scar was at risk of opening, leading to a dangerous uterine rupture that could result in severe consequences for the mother and infant. In the 1980 's data became available that vaginal birth after cesarean (VBAC) was not as dangerous as previously believed. Subsequently, the VBAC rate rose to a high of almost 30 % of all births in the 1990 's with a concomitant drop in the total cesarean section rate to 20 %. In 1996, a high <b>profile</b> <b>paper</b> reported the serious consequences that could accompany uterine rupture. The VBAC rate dropped precipitously and remains at a mere 9. 2 % today. Because of physician fear of uterine rupture, many women with prior cesareans are unaware of or denied a trial of labor after cesarean (TOLAC) in an effort to achieve vaginal birth. There appears to be poor understanding of the risks associated with elective repeat cesarean delivery (ERCD), the risks associated with VBAC, and no simple method to compare them. Based on many studies analyzing maternal and fetal outcomes of ERCD and TOLAC, it has been consistently shown that actual risk or frequency of uterine rupture for TOLAC is low, less than 1. 2 %. But when compared to an ERCD, the risk of uterine rupture during TOLAC becomes two to twenty times more likely than during an ERCD. Studies have uncovered numerous determinants that can either prevent or promote the risk of complications. Having had a prior successful vaginal delivery is most protective against uterine rupture, and an increasing number of prior cesareans leaves a woman more likely to fail TOLAC. Induction or augmentation of labor by using oxytocin, prostaglandins, or both may also increase risks of uterine rupture during TOLAC. With better knowledge of risk factors associated with uterine rupture and failed TOLACs, current guidelines suggest physicians consider a woman's choice and her desired child-bearing experience. Women prefer to be actively involved in their healthcare provision, and counseling of women with prior cesareans would ideally incorporate personal choice. While maternal and child health will always be the first priority in decision-making, if a woman is at low risk of TOLAC failure, modern medical practices and literature suggest granting her the option of attempting a VBAC rather than be subjected to another cesarean.

40|$|Coronary {{artery disease}} (CAD) {{is the leading}} cause of death {{worldwide}} and most often due to atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory process that involves the arteries, inclouding those that supply blood to the heart muscle. Although inflammation is an important contributing factor to atherosclerosis, the mechanisms are not fully understood. One mechanism contributing to atherogenesis may involve some infectious microorganisms such as cytomegalovirus (CMV). In atherosclerosis, the arterial wall becomes infiltrated with lipids followed by different types of leukocytes and inflammatory mediators (atherogenesis). Leukocytes recirculate continuously between the blood and lymphoid organs, such as lymph nodes, where the adaptive immune response is started and regulated. The general aim of this thesis was to increase the understanding of associations between lymphocyte populations and different conditions of CAD (unstable and stable). To assess changes over time, a longitudinal follow up design was mostly used. Therefore, also perspectives of longitudinal variation were included in the thesis. Paper I showed that flow cytometric evaluation of lymphocyte populations is a robust technique that can be used in longitudinal studies, both in clinical and research settings. It was also shown that the time of sampling over the year did not have a major impact on the findings. In paper II, thoracic lymph nodes were investigated to assess whether CAD-associated changes were more prominent in comparison with blood. As expected, there were several major differences in lymphocyte composition between lymph nodes and blood. However, the analysis of thoracic lymph nodes did not reveal any further changes that were not detected in blood. Thus, blood is still the most reliable compartment for studies of lymphocyte populations in CAD since it is not possible to examine the local findings in the artery wall. Natural killer (NK) cells are innate lymphocytes with both regulatory and effector functions. In paper II and III we confirmed previous findings that CAD patients have lower proportions of NK cells in blood. However, the NK subtype and cytokine <b>profile</b> (<b>paper</b> III, measured by subtype markers and intra-cellular cytokine staining) did not differ between patients and controls. During a 12 -month follow-up, the proportions of NK cells increased, although not in all patients. Failure to reconstitute NK cell levels was associated with several components of the metabolic syndrome and with a persistent low-grade inflammation as measured by plasma IL- 6 levels. The findings support the notion of a protective role for NK cells in inflammation. CD 4 + but not CD 8 + T cells were significantly increased in patients with both unstable and stable conditions compared with healthy individuals (paper IV). Subpopulations of CD 4 + T cells (CD 4 +CD 28 null) have previously been associated with CAD. However, we show that CD 28 null and CD 28 null 57 + cells within the CD 4 + and CD 8 + T cell populations were similar in CAD patients and healthy controls. Instead, CMV seropositivity was the major determinant of expanded CD 28 null and CD 57 + T cell fractions in both patients and healthy individuals. During the 1 year follow up the proportion of CD 4 +CD 28 null and CD 8 +CD 28 null cells increased in patients, which may reflect an accelerated immunological ageing occurring after the cardiac event...|$|E

40|$|Systemic {{sclerosis}} (SSc) is a {{rare disease}} that preferentially affects females, with a reported female-to-male ratio of 4. 6 : 1. 0 and a typical onset between 45 and 64 years. The prevalence is difficult to evaluate and may well differ between countries and ethnicities. In France, the prevalence among adults is about 158 /million. Thus, by extrapolation, the number of SSc cases in Belgium should be around 1, 700. SSc is a multisystemic disease purportedly resulting from three types of injuries: fibrosis, immune dysregulation and vascular damage. The exact trigger and the precise relation between {{the three types of}} injuries are complex, remain incompletely understood and depend in part on extrinsic factors (such as environmental, viral or toxic factors) and genetic susceptibility. This disease is characterized by excessive production of extracellular matrix proteins by fibroblasts and the clinical picture mainly results from tissue fibrosis and vascular occlusions. Clinical manifestations are various but Raynaud’s phenomenon, digital ulcers, sclerodactyly, interstitial lung disease, oeso-gastro-intestinal hypotony, arthritis, myositis and pulmonary arterial hypertension are common symptoms. Mortality in some series of SSc is as high as 30 % at 10 years. However, survival is variable due to disease heterogeneousness, impact of therapy, and difficulties in assessing the time of disease onset. There are only a few evidence-based drugs available in SSc. The lack of relevant animal models and the remaining uncertainties regarding pathophysiology largely explain this unmet need. Moreover, the rarity of the disease and the heterogeneous nature of the clinical manifestations limit the possibility to run randomized controlled trials. However, in 2009, recommendations for the treatment of SSc were published so that current treatment is based on expert opinions and on a patient-tailored multi-drug approach, according to the extent of skin/internal organ involvement. The Belgian Systemic Sclerosis Cohort (BSSC) is a nationwide initiative launched by Frédéric Houssiau in 2006. The aim of this long-term prospective observational study was to define the natural history of SSc, to identify prognostic factors, and, in parallel, {{to improve the quality of}} care. All prevalent and incident cases of SSc, fulfilling LeRoy and Medsger’s classification criteria followed in Belgian teaching hospitals were asked to participate. Data were collected in a prospective way, at baseline, 6 months and then yearly, within the regulatory frame required by good clinical practices. Since April 2006, 540 patients have been included. The first paper reports baseline and follow-up data on the first 438 patients included in the BSSC with a special emphasis on death rate and on correlations between disease severity scores, cutaneous subsets and autoantibody <b>profile</b> (<b>paper</b> 1). The BSSC is the backbone of this thesis; moreover, this large serie of well characterized cases gave us the opportunity to launch spin-off studies. First, we performed a study dealing with hand radiological damage in a large group of SSc patients, with a special emphasis on the distinction between osteoarthritic- and inflammation-driven damage. The originality of our work stems from the comparison with a gender- and age-matched control group and from the correlations we were able to test with the clinical and functional characteristics of SSc patients available through the BSSC (paper 2). Second, we developed and validated a questionnaire specifically aimed at testing manual ability of SSc patients. The latter was created using the Rasch model that estimates the item difficulty and the patient’s manual ability on a common linear scale from the answers given to each item, within a probablistic framework (paper 3). Third, in a small and retrospective study, we reported the safety, in terms of renal function and blood pressure, of monthly intravenous (IV) methylprednisolone (MP) pulses in early SSc patients suffering from interstitial lung disease (ILD), myositis, arthritis or rapidly progressing diffuse cutaneous involvement (paper 4). Finally, we suggested the efficacy and safety of mycophenolate mofetil combined to IV and oral glucocorticoids in a small one-year pilot study including 16 early SSc patients suffering from either interstitial lung disease or diffuse skin disease (paper 5).

40|$|Oral {{squamous}} cell carcinoma (OSCC) is a major health problem in many developing countries, representing more than 25 % of all new cancer cases in some countries such as India and Sri Lanka. Cigarette smoking, smokeless tobacco (ST), alcohol use and chewing of betel quid (BQ) are the main risk factors associated with OSCC development. Infection with highrisk Human papillomavirus (HPV) is an emerging risk factor, particularly for oropharyngeal cancers. Most of the OSCC cases are diagnosed at advanced stages, {{being one of the}} factors related to the high mortality rate of this cancer. A better understanding of the molecular biology of OSCC development might lead to improved methods related to detection, assessing prognosis and novel treatments of this malignancy. Over the recent years, microarray-based technologies have become commonly used techniques for analyzing gene expression and chromosomal alterations in human cancers and other disease conditions. These high-throughput technologies enable genome-wide analysis of changes in gene expression or chromosomal deletions/amplifications in the pathological samples to be studied. In the search for possible molecular biomarkers for OSCCs, a series of studies were carried out in the work described here, where cDNA microarrays and arraycomparative genomic hybridization (array-CGH) were applied to examine possible changes in gene expression and DNA copy number alterations in OSCC samples compared to their pairwised normal controls and between OSCC samples from different populations. In addition to examining gene expression in OSCC, the study included analysis of samples from a potentially malignant disorder known as oral submucous fibrosis (OSF), common in Asian populations, to ascertain whether genetic aberrations found in OSCC could be observed in early phases of carcinogenesis. Gene expression profiles and chromosomal alterations were studied in OSCC/OSF samples from Sri Lankan, Indian, Swedish and UK patients using cDNA microarrays and array-CGH. For gene expression <b>profile</b> (<b>Paper</b> I), 15 cases of OSCCs from Sri Lanka and their pairwised normal controls were examined. Following RNA extraction from all samples, cDNA was synthesized and labeled with Cy 3 (tumor cDNA) and Cy 5 (normal cDNA). Labeled tumor and normal cDNA were hybridized to 31 k cDNA microarrays, slides were scanned and images were subjected to analysis with Genepix and J-Express computer software programmes. 262 genes (189 up-regulated and 73 down-regulated) were found to be differentially expressed between tumors and normal controls with 66 genes of known function and 66 novel genes. Among the group of genes of known function those found were CAV 1, CAV 2, COL 4 A 1, MMP 1, MMP 3, PLAU, SPARC, TNC (all up-regulated) and AZGP 1, KRT 19 and S 100 A 1 (all down-regulated). Microarray results for nine genes were verified with RTqPCR. Hierarchical clustering of the samples based on the differentially expressed genes did not show any clear relationship between sample clustering and the clinicopathological data, except for two samples (one verrucous carcinoma and one advanced tumor) that were clustered separately. In Paper II, gene expression profiles from 19 OSCCs from Sweden (n= 8) and UK (n= 11) were examined and compared between these two populations. RNA was extracted from all OSCCs and cDNA was synthesized and labeled with Cy 3. For controls, human universal reference RNA was used for cDNA synthesis and labeling with Cy 5. Labeled cDNAs were hybridized to 21 k human oligonucleotide microarrays, slides were scanned and images were subjected to analysis with GenePix and J-Express. Here, 42 genes (including APOL 3, NT 5 E, HMGA 1, FASN and FOS) were found as being differentially expressed between the two populations compared to controls. Expression of three genes was validated with RT-qPCR. Upon hierarchical clustering, there was a tendency for the samples from the same population to group together. For chromosomal alterations (Paper III) 24 cases of OSCCs (12 from Sri Lanka and 12 from India) and 6 OSF (India) samples were studied. Following total DNA extraction from all samples, tumor and control DNA (Human Universal Reference DNA) were digested and labeled with Cy 3 (tumors) and Cy 5 (control) and further hybridized to arrays containing 4500 Bacterial artificial chromosomes (BAC) and P 1 artificial chromosomes (PAC) clones. Array- CGH resulted in 349 candidate genes located in deleted (34 genes) or amplified (30 genes) different chromosomal regions in these samples common to both populations, in addition to 285 genes located in 66 chromosomal regions found as deleted or amplified in either Indian or Sri Lankan samples. Further, we selected one gene found to be deleted in the samples from both countries, namely S 100 A 14, for further validation analysis using immunohistochemistry (IHC) and genetic variation study by RFLP (Restriction fragment length polymorphism). IHC showed decreased expression of S 100 A 14 in OSCC archival samples compared to normal oral mucosa, and a relocalization from membrane to cytoplasmic expression. RFLP for one SNP (461 A>G) demonstrated a significant difference in genotypes of OSCC and OSF. These results together with our previous findings on cases of OSCCs studied from Sudan and Norway, demonstrate that 72 genes were found to be common for all six populations studied. Among these were BAX, CCND 1, COL 4 A 1, DAPK 1, FGF 3, FGF 4, JUNB, MMP 1, MMP 3, PLAU, SPARC, TNC, TGFB 1, several S 100 gene family members (including S 100 A 14) and TP 53. Of particular note, there were only small differences in gene aberrations in OSF compared to OSCCs. These results suggest that genetic alterations occur early during OSCC development, and that there are genes commonly involved in OSCC development regardless of the life-style and source of the material to be studied. We suggest S 100 A 14 as a possible tumor biomarker for OSCCs together with COL 4 A 1, MMP 1, MMP 3, PLAU, SPARC and TNC. Findings in the present work further suggest that there is a specific genotype of OSF which might be related to an increased risk of OSCC development...|$|E

Please do not use in any publications without checking with yanailab. technion. ac. il first Abstract of bioRxiv paper at [URL] ====================================== The genome of the tardigrade Hypsibius dujardini ====================================== Background: Tardigrades are meiofaunal ecdysozoans that may be key to understanding the origins of Arthropoda. Many species of Tardigrada can survive extreme conditions through adoption of a cryptobiotic state. A recent high <b>profile</b> <b>paper</b> suggested that the genome of a model tardigrade, Hypsibius dujardini, has been shaped by unprecedented levels of horizontal gene transfer (HGT) encompassing 17 % of protein coding genes, and speculated that this was likely formative in the evolution of stress resistance. We tested these findings using an independently sequenced and assembled genome of H. dujardini, derived from the same original culture isolate. Results: Whole-organism sampling of meiofaunal species will perforce include gut and surface microbiotal contamination, and our raw data contained bacterial and algal sequences. Careful filtering generated a cleaned H. dujardini genome assembly, validated and annotated with GSSs, ESTs and RNA-Seq data, with superior assembly metrics compared to the published, HGT-rich assembly. A small amount of additional microbial contamination likely remains in our 135 Mb assembly. Our assembly length fits well with multiple empirical measurements of H. dujardini genome size, and is 120 Mb shorter than the HGT-rich version. Among 23, 021 protein coding gene predictions we found 216 genes (0. 9 %) with similarity to prokaryotes, 196 of which were expressed, suggestive of HGT. We also identified ~ 400 genes (< 2 %) that could be HGT from other non-metazoan eukaryotes. Cross-comparison of the assemblies, using raw read and RNA-Seq data, confirmed that {{the overwhelming majority of the}} putative HGT candidates in the previous genome were predicted from scaffolds at very low coverage and were not transcribed. Crucially much of the natural contamination in both projects was non-overlapping, confirming it as foreign to the shared target animal genome. Conclusions: We find no support for massive horizontal gene transfer into the genome of H. dujardini. Many of the bacterial sequences in the previously published genome were not present in our raw reads. In construction of our assembly we removed most, but still not all, contamination with approaches derived from metagenomics, which we show are very appropriate for meiofaunal species. We conclude that HGT into H. dujardini accounts for 1 - 2 % of genes and that the proposal that 17 % of tardigrade genes originate from HGT events is an artefact of undetected contamination...|$|E
