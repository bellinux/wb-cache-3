40|$|Origins and {{distribution}} of the human inferior <b>phrenic</b> <b>arteries</b> were studied by dissecting 68 Japanese adult cadavers. The inferior <b>phrenic</b> <b>arteries</b> were usually observed as paired (left and right) vessels. Their origins were summarized as follows: a) the aorta itself (85 / 138 cases, 61. 6 %), b) the ventro-visceral arteries (celiaco-mesenteric system of the aorta) including the celiac trunk (39 / 138 cases, 28. 2 %) and the left gastric artery (4 / 138 cases, 2. 9 %), and c) the latero-visceral arteries (adreno-renal system of the aorta) including the middle adrenal artery (4 / 138 cases, 2. 9 %) and the renal artery (6 / 138 cases, 4. 3 %). The left and right arteries occasionally originated in common trunk from the aorta, celiaco-mesenteric system or adreno-renal system (22 / 138 cases, 15. 9 %). A typological diagram explaining these variations is given. The inferior <b>phrenic</b> <b>arteries,</b> especially the left ones, sometimes issued visceral or esophageal branches. This fact indicates that the inferior <b>phrenic</b> <b>arteries</b> are homologous with the celiac trunk and mesenteric arteries. It is further discussed that the celiac trunk and mesenteric arteries are originally paired vessels, through introduction of our previous typological diagram of the abdominal arteries. </p...|$|R

40|$|Injury to the {{inferior}} <b>phrenic</b> <b>artery</b> after blunt trauma {{is an extremely}} rare event, and it may occur under unanticipated conditions. This case report describes an injury to the left inferior <b>phrenic</b> <b>artery</b> caused by blunt trauma, which was complicated by massive hemothorax, and treated with transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE). An 81 year-old female {{hit by a car}} while walking at the traffic intersection was transferred to the emergency department, computed tomography scanning revealed active extravasations of the contrast medium within the retrocrural space and from branches of the internal iliac artery. The patient underwent repeated angiography, and active extravasation of contrast medium was observed between the retrocrural space and the right pleural space originating from the left inferior <b>phrenic</b> <b>artery.</b> The injured left inferior <b>phrenic</b> <b>artery</b> was successfully embolized with N-butyl cyanoacrylate, resulting in stabilization of the patient’s clinical condition.

40|$|Multiple {{variations}} {{were found}} in a 54 -year-old male cadaver during routine dissections of abdominal retroperitoneal region. Right inferior <b>phrenic</b> <b>artery</b> was arising from right renal artery, while the right middle and superior suprarenal artery branched from the right inferior <b>phrenic</b> <b>artery.</b> Left inferior <b>phrenic</b> <b>artery</b> was originating from the abdominal aorta below celiac trunk. The left middle suprarenal artery appeared as the branch of celiac trunk. Double left renal artery was arising separately {{from the left side}} of the aorta. The upper left renal artery showed approximately 80 º of kinking which then crossed the lower one and entered to the inferior pole of hilum of kidney. Left testicular artery was originating from the upper left renal artery after this kinking. The left and right fourth lumbar arteries and median sacral artery have branched from a common trunk posterior to the abdominal aorta. In spite of these abundant variations in the branches, abdominal aorta itself did not show any variation, spanning normally between the levels of T 12 –L 4 vertebrae. The variations of abdominal aorta may have clinical importance, especially in surgical and radiologic investigations...|$|E
50|$|The {{superior}} <b>phrenic</b> <b>arteries</b> {{are small}} and arise from {{the lower part of}} the thoracic aorta; they are distributed to the posterior part of the upper surface of the diaphragm, and anastomose with the musculophrenic and pericardiacophrenic arteries.|$|R
50|$|The {{pericardiacophrenic artery}} {{is a long}} slender branch of the {{internal}} thoracic artery.

40|$|SUMMARY: Knowledge of the {{branching}} {{pattern of the}} abdominal aorta is clinically important for any abdominal surgeon operating on parts of the gut or neighboring structures like the suprarenals, spleen, pancreas, liver, kidneys and ureter. The presence of abnormal inferior <b>phrenic</b> <b>artery</b> associated with aberrant branch from the celiac trunk supplying the pancreas and duodenum is a rare anomaly. In the present case, we observed four branches of the celiac artery i. e. (a) left gastric artery (b) common hepatic artery (c) splenic artery and (d) an aberrant branch, which took a course inferiorly towards the pancreas. The aberrant artery supplied {{the body of the}} pancreas and gave a branch which supplied the horizontal part of the duodenum and then entered the transverse mesocolon to supply the hepatic flexure and some portions of the ascending and the transverse colon. The inferior <b>phrenic</b> <b>artery</b> was absent on the left side. Concomitant anomalies of such type are to be kept in mind by the surgeon, while operating cases of carcinoma head of pancreas and performing kidney transplantations...|$|E

40|$|Variations in the {{branching}} {{pattern of the}} celiac trunk are well documented. We are reporting a case of unusual origins of left superior suprarenal, left middle suprarenal, gastroduodenal and right inferior <b>phrenic</b> <b>arteries</b> from the celiac trunk {{in addition to its}} usual left gastric, splenic and common hepatic arteries. This type of rare variation has significant importance in surgical and radiological procedures...|$|R
40|$|Renal, adrenal, gonadal, {{ureteral}} and inferior <b>phrenic</b> <b>arteries</b> vary {{in their}} level of origin and in their calibre, number and precise anatomical relationship to other structures. Studies of the origin and early development of these arteries have evoked sharp disputes. The ladder theory of Felix, which states that ‘All the mesonephric arteries may persist; from them are formed the phrenic, suprarenal, renal and internal spermatic arteries’ has been generally quoted in the anatomical textbooks without rigorous verification for 100 years. In this study, we re-examined this theory by performing micro-injection of dye and resin into rat (Rattus norvegicus) embryos. Our results revealed {{that most of the}} mesonephric arteries had degenerated before the metanephros started its ascent. The definitive renal, adrenal, gonadal, ureteral and inferior <b>phrenic</b> <b>arteries</b> appeared as new branches from the gonadal artery and/or directly from the abdominal aorta to the para-aortic ridge. Coincidental to this, the anatomical architecture of the inter-renal vascular cage, which consists of the interlobar and arcuate arteries and their collateral veins, was completed within the developing metanephros. We demonstrated that the delicate renal vascular cage switched from the primary renal artery to the definitive renal artery and that the route of venous drainage changed from the posterior cardinal vein to the inferior (caudal) vena cava...|$|R
40|$|A {{thorough}} {{knowledge of}} variation in the branching pattern of celiac trunk and superior mesenteric artery is important for surgeons, radiologists and other medical specialties.

40|$|In {{patients}} with chronic pancreatitis, an actively bleeding pseudo aneurysm can be life threatening. Common sites of pseudoaneurysms are splenic, gastro-duodenal, superior & inferior pancreaticoduodenal arterial branches.

30|$|The adrenals are paired retroperitoneal glands {{that lie}} superiorly and anteromedially to the kidneys. They are triangular-shaped {{with the right}} adrenal gland being usually more {{pyramidal}} in shape [8]. The adrenal glands are made of an outer cortex deriving from the mesoderm and an inner medulla deriving from the neural crest. In the cortex, the zona glomerulosa produces mineralocorticoids, the zona fasciculata glucocorticoids, and the zona reticularis sex steroids or gonadocorticoids, whereas the medulla produces catecholamines, adrenaline, and noradrenaline. The adrenals are supplied by three arteries: superior (from the inferior <b>phrenic</b> <b>arteries),</b> middle (from the abdominal aorta), and inferior suprarenal arteries (from the renal arteries). The right adrenal vein ends into the inferior vena cava, while the left adrenal vein ends into the left renal vein or inferior phrenic vein. The lymphatic vessels drain to the para-aortic nodes. The innervation of adrenals comes from the splanchnic nerves arising from the aortic and renal plexuses [9].|$|R

He had shortness of breath and chest tightness, which prompted an FDG PET/CT study to evaluate the nature of the mass. The images revealed abnormal FDG accumulation in a right lower lung mass and a mediastinal lymph node. Therefore, a possible diagnosis of lung carcinoma with mediastinal lymph node metastasis was suggested. A right lower lobe lobectomy was performed. Histopathologically, squamous cell carcinoma with mediastinal lymph node metastases was diagnosed (stage IIIA by AJCC, T 2 N 2) ...|$|E
40|$|In transhiatal blunt esophagectomy {{there is}} {{surprisingly}} little bleeding if no adjacent great vessels are torn. This prompted {{an investigation by}} new injection techniques and corrosion on the human esophageal vasculature three-dimensionally. The three main arterial sources were confirmed: the superior thyroid artery, bronchial arteries {{at the level of}} the carina, and the left gastric and splenic artery. Two facts became obvious that were not appreciated hitherto. All major vascular trees divide into minute branches at some distance from the esophagus. Those branches go on to form a dense submucosal interconnected network. It appears that such small extraesophageal branches, when torn, will have the benefit of contractile hemostasis. Previous claims made that essential nutritional vessels arise from intercostal <b>phrenic</b> <b>arteries</b> or the aorta directly could not be confirmed.

Taking into account the {{importance}} of morphological data for various studies, this paper aimed to elucidate the branching of the abdominal aorta in this species to foster the development of further studies. To do this, 4 specimens were used, 2 male and 2 female, all young, from the Bauxite Mine – Paragominas, Para, Brazil, donated after death due to running over to the Animal Morphology Research Laboratory (LaPMA) of Universidade Federal Rural da Amazonia (UFRA). The arterial system was filled with contrasted latex and the animals were fixed in a formaldehyde solution (10 %), and then dissected, in order to evidence the abdominal aorta and its collateral branches. The parietal branches consisted of 1 pair of caudal <b>phrenic</b> <b>arteries,</b> 2 pairs of intercostal arteries, and 3 pairs of lumbar arteries. Among the visceral branches, stood out: celiac artery; cranial mesenteric artery; adrenal arteries; renal arteries; caudal mesenteric artery; and external, internal, and median sacral iliac arteries, formed from the final portion of the abdominal aorta.
