50|$|Beda is a {{given name}} and surname of {{multiple}} origin.As a given name, it originates as an Anglo-Saxon short name, West Saxon Bīeda, Northumbrian Bǣda, Anglian Bēda (the <b>purported</b> <b>name</b> {{of one of the}} Saxon founders of Portsmouth in AD 501 according to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle) cognate with German Bodo.

40|$|Patriarch Luo or Luo Qing was {{the author}} of a very {{influential}} religious work traditionally known as the Five Books in Six Volumes. They contain his religious autobiography as well as statements on various points of religious practice, supported by a wealth of quotations that stem mostly from the Buddhist canon. This article first deals briefly with Luo Qing's biography, pointing out that reliable historical knowledge on him is extremely limited. Much of what is claimed about him in the secondary literature, including his <b>purported</b> <b>name</b> of Luo Menghong, is derived from later, mythological sources. What we do have are his own written works. By analyzing patterns in quotations from these works, this article tries to uncover the author's patterns of reading and writing. A quantitative analysis of the sources shows that the Five Books in Six Volumes seemingly quote a large number of different, mostly Buddhist texts, but that by far the largest number of these quotations comes from {{a very small number of}} works. Moreover, the quotations often have minor mistakes, appear in the wrong sequence, and are highly selective and even haphazard. On the basis of an analysis of some striking examples, it is argued that Patriarch Luo or Luo Qing may not even have been quoting directly from written texts, but was instead quoting from memory. This would also explain why he sometimes quotes only a very small number of fragments from one particular source, since he may not been quoting directly from that source, but rather from a lecture he heard from a Buddhist teacher at one or another point in his life...|$|E

40|$|This study follows {{words from}} the {{languages}} of Native American peoples that appeared in printed and manuscript accounts by Europeans {{in the first years}} of American colonization. I present a cultural bibliography of Native languages from the late fifteenth through the mid-sixteenth centuries, examining the contexts of publication and circulation of texts that include Native words. When were Native words and phrases first written and printed? Who may have been responsible for their appearance and disappearance, their transcription, their printing, and their circulation? Why did they appear in some texts and documents and not in others? How did such words function in texts? How might our readings of them change our understandings of Native-European contact and colonization? My case studies include the word canoa, one of the first loan{{words from the}} American Native language now called 2 ̆ 2 Taino 2 ̆ 2; Guanahani, the <b>purported</b> <b>name</b> of the island on which Christopher Columbus and his crew first arrived in 1492; and the controversial word cannibal, the meanings of which were debated in European sources during the 1490 s. Alongside Native words, I trace references to 2 ̆ 2 conversation 2 ̆ 2 between Europeans and Natives. Europeans needed to converse in order to gain vital information for trade and settlement and hence were dependent, to an extent, upon Native words. European writers take the willingness of Native peoples to engage in conversation as a marker of civility and take language variations as indicative of political divisions between peoples. Texts I analyze include versions of the letter recounting Columbus 2 ̆ 7 s first transatlantic voyage and reports by Italian merchants, diplomats, chroniclers, and scholars relating to the first and second Spanish expeditions. I study the letters attributed to Amerigo Vespucci alongside the imaginary American alphabet printed in Thomas More 2 ̆ 7 s Utopia. I conclude with a comparison of word lists printed in Peter Martyr d 2 ̆ 7 Anghiera 2 ̆ 7 s De Orbe novo and in narratives of Jacques Cartier 2 ̆ 7 s expeditions to the St. Lawrence River valley in the 1530 s. ...|$|E

In Gene-Mutation tactic we are propagating two child from single parent and selecting one of them on the basis of fitness and also bring into play elitism on the child so that the mutation operation does not degrade the fitness of the distinct, whereas in Plain Crossover we select the two child for the succeeding generation on the basis of size, depth and fitness along with elitism on each step from the six child which is generated during crossover. To exhibit our approach we have designed a Multiclass Classifier using GP by taking some standard datasets. The results attained show that by applying Plain crossover together with Gene-Mutation refined the performance of the classifier...|$|R
2500|$|In March 1868, McCarver {{then moved}} north and helped found Tacoma, Washington. He {{first went to}} Olympia, capital of the then Washington Territory, and {{procured}} a map to study the area and consider the most likely terminus of the then planned transcontinental railroad. On April 1, 1868, McCarver arrived at Commencement Bay, a likely railroad terminus on Puget Sound due to its proximity to Snoqualmie Pass, and then purchased the land of Job Carr. He continued buying up available land along Commencement Bay {{in anticipation of the}} railroad. McCarver also convinced Hanson, Ackerson & Company to build a sawmill in the area while he platted a town site and sold-off lots. McCarver wanted to call the city Commencement City, but after a suggestion by Philip Ritz of the Northern Pacific Railroad, McCarver changed his mind. Anthony Carr, Job's son, had already filed a plat for [...] "Tacoma" [...] on November 30, 1869. McCarver chose to call his neighboring plat [...] "Tacoma City," [...] when he filed his plat map on December 3, 1869. The word [...] "Tacoma" [...] may be the <b>purported</b> Native American <b>name</b> for nearby Mount Rainier. Alternatively, it may have been used by Native Americans in the Puget Sound region to describe all snow-topped peaks in the region, and was not specific to Mount Rainier.|$|R
50|$|There {{are several}} small towns {{scattered}} around the island, making it quite evenly populated.The largest towns are Holyhead, Llangefni, Benllech, Menai Bridge, and Amlwch. Beaumaris (Welsh: Biwmares), in {{the east of the}} island, features Beaumaris Castle, built by Edward I as part of his Bastide Town campaign in North Wales. Beaumaris is a yachting centre, with many boats moored in the bay or off Gallows Point. The village of Newborough (Welsh: Niwbwrch), in the south, created when the townsfolk of Llanfaes were relocated {{to make way for the}} building of Beaumaris Castle, includes the site of Llys Rhosyr, another of the courts of the medieval Welsh princes, which features one of the oldest courtrooms in the United Kingdom. Llangefni is located in the centre of the island and is the island's administrative centre. The town of Menai Bridge (Welsh: Porthaethwy) (in the south-east) expanded when the first bridge to the mainland was being built, in order to accommodate workers and construction. Until then, Porthaethwy had been one of the principal ferry crossing points from the mainland. A short distance from this town lies Bryn Celli Ddu, a Stone Age burial mound. Also nearby is the village with the longest <b>purported</b> place <b>name</b> in the United Kingdom, Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch. Nearby is Plas Newydd, ancestral home of the Marquesses of Anglesey. The town of Amlwch is situated in the northeast of the island and was once largely industrialised, having grown during the 18th century supporting the copper mining industry at Parys Mountain.Other villages and settlements include Cemaes, Pentraeth, Gaerwen, Dwyran, Bodedern, Malltraeth, and Rhosneigr. The Anglesey Sea Zoo is a local tourist attraction, providing a look at and descriptions of local marine wildlife from common lobsters to congers. All the fish and crustaceans on display are caught around the island and are placed in reconstructions of their natural habitat. The Anglesey Sea Zoo also breed commercially lobsters, for food, and oysters, for pearls, both from local stocks. Sea salt (Halen Môn, evaporated from the local sea water), now produced in a modern facility nearby, was formerly produced at the Sea Zoo site.|$|R
40|$|International law {{scholars}} frequently seek {{to participate}} in international legal proceedings as amici curiae. Often they do so by ‘piggy-backing’ onto the submissions of NGOs and other advocacy groups. Occasionally – but increasingly in recent years – they do so in their own <b>names,</b> <b>purporting</b> to offer ‘pure’ academic expertise, and generating certain expectations of scholarly neutrality. This article focuses on the latter trend, which the authors argue {{has the potential to}} re-shape the scholar-adjudicator dialogue in interesting ways. Under the traditional approach towards ‘teachings’, the decision of whether, how and with whom to engage is firmly {{in the hands of the}} adjudicators. The proliferation of academic amicus briefs threatens to disrupt this arrangement. It also brings certain benefits: the briefs are often more ‘on point’ than doctrinal writings, while openness to unsolicited academic submissions encourages plurality and reduces reliance on reputation as a measure of scholarly quality. Our survey of the emerging practice across various international courts and tribunals indicates that adjudicators tend to be reticent when it comes to the reception of unsolicited academic amicus briefs. However, we identify several instances of productive engagement. This leads us to conclude that it would be unduly gloomy to characterise the emerging practice as a ‘dialogue of the deaf’. A fairer assessment would be that the academic amicus trend is bringing about a modest adjustment in the way that international law scholars and adjudicators engage with each other...|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} learn a {{language}}, a child has to learn how the language expresses reference grammatically. Quine presents a behavioral theory in which the child acquires language {{through a process of}} conditioning and ostension. This process consists of four phases. In the first phase the child starts babbling. This behavior gets rewarded or not, dependent on the situation in which it occurs. Terms are learned by a process of reinforcement and extinction. In this phase, the child is not aware yet of objects, it just reacts to stimulations. This is a form of operant conditioning. In the second phase, the child acquires general terms, and demonstrative singular terms (this, that) and singular description, sentences that <b>name</b> (or <b>purport</b> to <b>name)</b> only one object. In this phase the child also learns terms that do not have reference, like ‘unicorn’. Furthermore, the child learns divided reference of general terms (that general term refer to more than one object), and with that it has access to a conceptual scheme that includes ‘enduring and recurring objects’. With this, the child has acquired the important distinction between singular and general terms. This distinction entails that a singular term 'purports to refer to one object' while a general term does not purports to refer to an object. As Quine points out: 'The basis combination in which general and singular terms find their contrasting roles is that of predication.' Predication combines general terms with singular terms, in a sentence that is true or false just as the general term (‘F’) is true or false of the object to which the singular term (‘a’) refers. Predication is thus logically represented as ‘Fa’. In the third phase, the child learns composite general terms, which are formed by joining two general terms. In the fourth phase, the child learns how to talk about new objects. The child can now apply relative terms to singular or general terms. A relative term is a term that is true of two (or more) objects in relation to each other, like ‘bigger than’. The child can now make terms that refer to objects that cannot be seen, for example ‘smaller than that speck’ to refer to a neutrino. This phase thus gives a new dimension to the child’s conceptual scheme.|$|R
