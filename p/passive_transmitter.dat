We obtained a 20 - 80 % rise time (tr) of approximately 80 micros at 22 degrees C, shorter than any previously reported values, and tr variability (SD) with an upper limit of 25 - 30 micros. Extracellular electrode pressure can increase tr and its variability by 2 - to 3 -fold. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we modeled passive acetylcholine diffusion through a vesicle fusion pore expanding radially at 25 nm x ms(- 1) (rapid, from endplate omega figure appearance) or 0. 275 nm x ms(- 1) (slow, from mast cell exocytosis). Simulated mEPCs obtained with rapid expansion reproduced tr {{and the overall}} shape of our experimental mEPCs, and were similar to simulated mEPCs obtained with instant acetylcholine release.

40|$|During recent decades, new {{insights}} regarding the spawning migration of lampreys have been gained due to {{advances in technology}} and growing interest in this key life history phase. The development of miniaturized active and <b>passive</b> <b>transmitters</b> has led to detailed information on the timing and extent of lamprey migrations. These tools, together with sophisticated laboratory experiments, have provided fertile ground for studies of lamprey migratory physiology and behavior. New molecular tools have been applied to questions of population structure and philopatry, while the identification of lamprey pheromones has illuminated heretofore unimagined mechanisms of migration and orientation. Interest in spawning migration has been spurred by the growing need to restore native lamprey populations and the equally pressing need to control invasive sea lamprey in the Laurentian Great Lakes. While important advances in anadromous lamprey biology have been achieved, gaps remain {{in our understanding of}} marine movements, speciesspecific differences, mechanisms of orientation, and the factors controlling passage success. Moreover, {{with the exception of the}} landlocked sea lamprey in the Great Lakes, research on the spawning migrations of the strictly potamodromous species (i. e., those that are parasitic in fresh water and the non-parasitic “brook” lampreys) is sorely lacking, seriously compromising our ability to assess what constitutes barriers to their migration...|$|R

Tendon-derived cues, albeit poorly understood, are necessary for proper muscle guidance and attachment during development. In the present study, we used dorsal longitudinal muscles of Drosophila and their tendon attachment sites to unravel the molecular nature of interactions between muscles and tendons. We performed a genetic screen using RNAi-mediated knockdown in tendon cells to find out molecular players involved in the formation and maintenance of myotendinous junction and found 21 candidates out of 2507 RNAi lines screened.

They must articulate the diversity of interests of campaign donors to maximize their autonomy, but at the same time, raise funds to increase their chances of seizing political power. Once in power, they are the programmers of political processes and policy making. Even then, the clash of forces continues: the judiciary exercises networking power by gate-keeping access to political positions and regulating procedures; political decision relies on media to communicate with the public and get support; media owners are not <b>passive</b> <b>transmitters</b> of political instructions: they distribute biased political programs according to their specific interests as media organizations. This interface between political networks and media networks is an example of switching power. It is the control over the connecting points between various strategic networks. When switchers become aligned in oligarchic domination, the dynamism and initiative of multiple sources of social structure suffocate. This is why the government should not control the media and reciprocally, media owners do not became political leaders. This can be extended to the relationships between religious leaders and media owners, and between politicians and rural corporations. Switching functions, and therefore switchers, play a central role to understanding power making [17].|$|R
40|$|Most {{experimental}} realizations {{of quantum}} key distribution {{are based on the}} Bennett-Brassard 1984 (so-called BB 84) protocol. In a typical optical implementation of this scheme, the sender uses an active source to produce the required BB 84 signal states. While active state preparation of BB 84 signals is a simple and elegant solution in principle, in practice passive state preparation might be desirable in some scenarios, for instance, in those experimental setups operating at high transmission rates. Passive schemes might also be more robust against side-channel attacks than active sources. Typical passive devices involve parametric down-conversion. In this paper, we show that both coherent light and practical single photon sources are also suitable for passive generation of BB 84 signal states. Our method does not require any external-driven element, but only linear optical components and photodetectors. In the case of coherent light, the resulting key rate is similar to the one delivered by an active source. When the sender uses practical single photon sources, however, the distance covered by a <b>passive</b> <b>transmitter</b> might be longer than the one of an active configuration.

40|$|As the {{communications}} revolution continues {{there is an}} ever increasing demand for integrated transmitters and receivers on silicon in devices such as mobile phones and networking products. The demand to integrate complete systems onto a single die has driven a need to minimise the area of transmitters {{which has led to}} research into combining digital to analogue converters and RF mixers to minimise their area. The drive for increasing speeds and smaller transistors has resulted in higher capacitance densities and lower operating voltages, the latter making it more difficult to implement conventional transmitter circuits. Therefore {{there is a need for}} <b>passive</b> <b>transmitter</b> systems that maximise the output power to the load by minimising the voltage overhead on the output signal. This thesis proposes and demonstrates that it is possible to use a digital to analogue converter that performs RF up conversion using direct capacitive discharge to the load, which takes advantage of the large capacitance densities of a modern 40 nm CMOS process. The DAC uses charge sharing in a similar manner to a charge sharing DAC without the bandwidth limitations imposed by an output amplifier. The RF frequency up conversion at the DAC data clock rate is produced using two DACs that differentially output the complement of each other on different halves of the clock cycle (one outputting while the other is charging) thereby emulating a passive switched mixer. The thesis shows that an 8 bit capacitive discharge DAC of 0. 16 mm 2 can output 3 dBm into a 50 Ω load at 2. 15 GHz using a clock rate of 2 GHz with MTPR of greater than 30 dBc...|$|E
30|$|A corner cube {{retroreflector}} (CCR) {{has been}} developed as an optical <b>passive</b> <b>transmitter</b> in wireless optical communication with low power consumption [1]. While the CCR {{does not have a}} light source, it can transmit the data to the source by digitally modulated reflection of the incident light. It is comprised of two mutually orthogonal vertical mirrors and horizontal mirror with the magnetic or electro-static actuator. The actuator is utilized to form the angular displacement of the horizontal mirror. The electrostatic actuators have been commonly used due to their simple working principles and structures [2 – 5]. However, the electro-static actuator still needs high driving voltage to obtain the large angular displacement. Two mutually orthogonal vertical mirrors for the CCRs have successfully been fabricated using surface micromachining technique [2 – 5]. However, the alignment of two mirrors has been limited due to the curvature of the fabricated mirrors from the asymmetric film stresses and a manual assembling of two mirrors. In order to improve the flatness and alignment of the mirrors, bonded silicon-on-insulator (BSOI) with structurally-assisted and assembled or self-assembled structure was utilized [3, 4]. While they have presented good feasibility, {{it is not easy to}} obtain the accurate angular alignment to form mutually orthogonal mirror surfaces. In this study, a silicon bulk micromachined CCR was investigated with ultra-low voltage operation and negligible power consumption [6]. It was comprised of the bulk-micromachined silicon vertical mirror and silicon nitride horizontal mirror with piezoelectric cantilever actuator. For achieving good surface roughness, accurate angular alignment, and mass productivity of the vertical mirror, a new fabrication process was developed using a double-SOI wafer and anisotropic KOH etching technique. For obtaining a large displacement at low induced voltage and minimizing the initial angular displacement of the horizontal mirror, the piezoelectric micro-cantilever actuator and supports were new 1 y applied.|$|E

We explore the translation chains through which urban policies become mobile and are translated into practice. Informed by the city management and policy mobility literature, we conduct {{a case study of}} La Chureca, the rubbish dump and slum of Managua, Nicaragua, and its renewal programme. The Acahualinca Programme was implemented via translation chains enacted by many policy translators. It was translated into residents' and waste collectors' interests, its language packaged in artefacts such as prototypes in order to travel. It was made mobile via relational sites or situations providing safe and accessible connections with Chureca residents. Paradoxically, these places also allowed extraordinary connections between actors located in different scales and spaces, facilitating unexpected local community resistance. Although the Program ultimately remained almost unalterable in content, resistance unexpectedly transformed residents from <b>passive</b> policy <b>transmitters</b> into active policy actors in making the city.

40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of two parts. In the first part, we develop a remote data collection system to extract information {{from a number of}} <b>passive</b> sensors. Active <b>transmitters</b> on sensors, being inherently energy expensive, pose a bottleneck to long battery life. We propose modulated reradiation of radar illumination by sensor nodes as a means to transmit information. A Synthetic Aperture processing technique is developed to decode the transmitted information and simultaneously obtain a geographic map of the sensor locations. Modulated re-radiation be achieved by switching a load on the sensor antenna. Load modulation consumes negligible power compared to an active transmitter, thus reducing the overall power consumption of the sensor. To eliminate the clutter interference in the imaging process due to the presence of unwanted targets, a nonlinear antenna load is used and the reradiated harmonics are processed. ^ In the second part, we develop an LDPC coded modulation scheme for bandwidthefficient data transmission using QAM modulation. The underlying LDPC code is a rate 1 / 2 quasi-regular code having a low check degree of 5. The code is designed to offer different levels of protection to each bit position in the modulation symbol. Edges attached to different bit positions are treated differently and constraints are imposed on the check node connections to maximize the reliability of the outgoing messages from the check nodes. With a suitable choice of the constellation labeling and by using iterative demodulation, the code is shown to provide excellent performance on an AWGN channel at reasonably short block lengths. ...|$|R

These types of applications typically require low effective data rates, thus providing an opportunity to employ simple modulation schemes and aggressive duty-cycling. Due to their inherently duty-cycled nature, pulse-based Ultra-Wideband (UWB) systems are amenable to low-power operation by shutting off circuitry during idle mode between pulses. Furthermore, the use of non-coherent UWB signaling greatly simplifies both transmitter and receiver implementations, offering additional energy savings. This thesis presents an all-digital transmitter designed for a non-coherent pulsed UWB system. By exploiting relaxed center frequency tolerances in non-coherent wideband communication, the transmitter synthesizes UWB pulses from an energy efficient, single-ended digital ring oscillator. Dual capacitively-coupled digital power amplifiers (PAs) are used in tandem to generate bipolar phase modulated pulses for spectral scrambling purposes. By maintaining opposite common modes at the output of these PAs during idle mode (i. e. when no pulses are being transmitted), low frequency turn-on and turn-off transients typically associated with single-ended digital circuits driving single-ended antennas are attenuated by up to 12 dB. Furthermore, four level digital pulse shaping is employed to attenuate RF side lobes by up to 20 dB. The resulting dual power amplifiers achieve FCC compliant operation in the 3. 5, 4. 0, and 4. 5 GHz IEEE 802. 15. 4 a bands without the use of any off-chip filters or large <b>passive</b> components. The <b>transmitter</b> is fabricated in a 90 nm CMOS process and requires a core area of 0. 07 mm 2. The entirely digital architecture consumes zero static bias current, resulting in an energy efficiency of 17. 5 pJ/pulse at data rates up to 15. 6 Mbps. by Patrick Philip Mercier. Thesis (S. M.)
