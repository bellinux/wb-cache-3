40|$|To {{reduce the}} {{migration}} {{time of a}} virtual machine and network traffic generated during migration, existing works have proposed a number of optimizations to pre-copy live migration. These optimizations are delta compression, <b>page</b> <b>skip,</b> deduplication, and data compression. The cost-benefit analysis of these optimizations may preclude the use of certain optimizations in specific scenarios. However, no study has compared the performance & cost of these optimizations, and identified the impact of application behaviour on performance gain. Hence, {{it is not clear}} for a given migration scenario and an application, what is the best optimization that one must employ? In this paper, we present a comprehensive empirical study using a large number of workloads to provide recommendations on selection of optimizations for pre-copy live migration. The empirical study reveals that <b>page</b> <b>skip</b> is an important optimization as it reduces network traffic by 20 % with negligible additional CPU cost. Data compression yields impressive gains in reducing network traffic (37 %) but at the cost of a significant increase in CPU consumption (5 x). Deduplication needs to be applied with utmost care as the increase in CPU utilization might outweigh the benefits considerably. The combination of <b>page</b> <b>skip</b> and data compression works the best across workloads and results in a significant reduction in network traffic (40 %) ...|$|E

40|$|Ebook DDA (demand-driven acquisitions) {{programs}} have become common in academic libraries of all sizes. To establish a DDA program, a library creates potential subject collections by establishing profiles and downloading e-records that match {{them into their}} online catalog; when books are “used” (in an amazingly wide array of options), the library buys the book, often after a certain threshold is met. This is a fairly seamless process that users are often unaware is happening. DDA assessment by libraries, however, is often limited to the obvious demarcation between those ebooks that are purchased (after meeting library thresholds), and those that remain as viewable records in the OPAC, but are either never purchased or don’t move beyond the library’s preset limit of free views. Ironically, the data lurking behind DDA programs are extensive, albeit often confusing and difficult to navigate. And while libraries are frequently content to know an ebook has been selected and purchased through a vetted “use” process, {{there is much more}} to learn from DDA. This poster will present a clear guide to ebook use data, comparing a third-party vendor (EBL) and a publisher (Springer). EBL (employing in-house data) and Springer (employing COUNTER) both provide ebook use data, but they are surprisingly different. The research questions for this study are: • What are the options for pre- and post-purchase DDA ebook assessment? • How do data from COUNTER differ from those offered by EBL’s in-house data? • What are the positives and negatives of the wide variety of “use” definitions? • Are there any comparable data points uniformly available for ebook use across platforms? • Do COUNTER and EBL statistics provide sufficient data for assessing ebook usage? • What are the implications of the lack of uniformity with data provided by ebook vendors and publishers? Much of the confusion surrounding post-purchase ebook assessment stems from the wide variety of data options provided by publishers and third-party vendors. How many chapter downloads might equal how many page views? Does a total book download trump all other use, or do minutes spent inside a book, with specific pages viewed, carry more weight? And why does it matter? Ebook assessment matters because it offers new ways of evaluating and measuring how readers read and how books are read. Detailed DDA data are showing us what’s possible to learn about ebook use. These data can show us when users dip in and out (<b>pages</b> <b>skipped),</b> when they judge a book by its preface (reading only the first few pages), or when they read the entire book (rarely!). Ebook data provide libraries with a peek inside how our users use books, something a print book could never tell us. By evaluating and analyzing ebook use data, libraries can begin to better understand why users choose to read ebooks based on how they read ebooks, facts that will greatly enhance the collection development of ebook collections going forward...|$|R
40|$|We {{study in}} this paper the Web forum {{crawling}} problem, {{which is a very}} fundamental step in many Web applications, such as search engine and Web data mining. As a typical user-created content (UCC), Web forum has become an important resource on the Web due to its rich information contributed by millions of Internet users every day. However, Web forum crawling is not a trivial problem due to the in-depth link structures, the large amount of duplicate pages, as well as many invalid pages caused by login failure issues. In this paper, we propose and build a prototype of an intelligent forum crawler, iRobot, which has intelligence to understand the content and the structure of a forum site, and then decide how to choose traversal paths among different kinds of pages. To do this, we first randomly sample (download) a few pages from the target forum site, and introduce the page content layout as the characteristics to group those pre-sampled pages and re-construct the forum's sitemap. After that, we select an optimal crawling path which only traverses informative <b>pages</b> and <b>skips</b> invalid and duplicate ones. The extensive experimental results on several forums show the performance of our system in the following aspects: 1) Effectiveness – Compared to a generic crawler, iRobot significantly decreases the duplicate and invalid pages; 2) Efficiency – With a small cost of pre-sampling a few pages for learning the necessary knowledge, iRobot saves substantial network bandwidth and storage as it only fetches informative pages from a forum site; and 3) Long threads that are divided into multiple pages can be re-concatenated and archived as a whole thread, which is of great help for further indexing and data mining...|$|R

[...] Error in pagination: <b>page</b> 119 <b>skipped.</b> Signs of {{pathogenicity}} were quantified in cunner, Tautogolabrus adspersus, living adjacent (Birchy Cove and Summerside) to a non-chlorinated {{pulp and}} paper mill in the Humber River Estuary, western Newfoundland, compared with a reference site (Gillams) approximately 12 kilometers downstream of effluent outfall(s). Several bioindicators of pulp toxicity were utilized, including condition factor, organ somatic indices, macroscopic and microscopic irregularities, parasitofauna, age structure and induction of hepatic mixed function oxygenases. Condition factors were nonsignificant among sites in contrast to exaggerated growth at impact sites compared to Gillams' fish. Male and female gonadosomatic indices (GSIs) and histological analyses suggested a delay in spawning and/or gametogenesis of impacted fish versus mature, reference cunner. However, consideration of the short reproductive cycle of this species {{it is possible that}} polluted fish may have been sampled {{at the beginning of the}} maturational phase in comparison to Gillams' counterparts. Hepatosomatic indices (HSIs) were exaggerated at polluted sites and may reflect proliferation of hepatic smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER). This was consistent with significant induction of 7 ethoxyresorufin deethylase at the Birchy Cove site, since SER is the site of both Phase-I and Phase-II enzymes. However, increased liver size may be attributed to vitellogenesis of female fish. No consistent differences were observed in visceralsomatic indices (VSIs), but splenosomatic indices (SSIs) were, in general, larger at Birchy Cove and Summerside than at Gillams. Percent splenic deposits did not demonstrate site significance. Histological surveys indicated more pronounced tissue pathology at Birchy Cove and Summerside. Quantification of Cryptocotyle lingua did not establish any site-specific trends, however, enteric parasitization was considerably more intense at the reference site compared to Birchy Cove and Summerside, possibly due to voiding or reduced proliferation in effluent-exposed cunner. Otolith analysis (1994) showed the mean age of the Gillams' sample to be significantly greater than at polluted sites. Chronic stress observed in cunners suggests that evidence of pulp-induced toxicity in this population is not necessarily due to chlorine constituents...|$|R

The most substantial recent work is forty years old and however admirable are the qualities of A. P. Rossiter's edition, its pronouncements cannot now be considered as conclusive. Newer scholarship modifies or extends many of the older views. Yet because this scholarship consists of individual pieces or notes scattered throughout four decades of journals, Rossiter's edition remains, for most scholars, the undoubted authority. The lack of comprehensive up-to-date scholarship cannot but be prejudicial to a true consideration of the worth of the play. [...] This thesis attempts to gather and examine all existing scholarship on Woodstock and augment it with original work. For convenience, the thesis {{is divided into two}} sections. The first deals with the most common topics of concern for scholars, most of these being peripheral to an examination of the intrinsic merits of the play. The topics consist of the dating, historical sources and literary relationships of the play. The second part examines the internal workings of Woodstock, centering around its political designs. The politics of Woodstock is its most important aspect and this section details the Morality influences on the play, the political shapings of the imagery, and the significance of the political stand of Woodstock. [...] Woodstock deserves greater attention than it has received. It is a play of artistic integrity and has important connections with Shakespeare and the development of the Elizabethan history play. Its neglect is due rather to circumstance than any artistic weaknesses. This thesis, at least in part, rectifies the imbalance between critical study and the merits of the play...|$|R
