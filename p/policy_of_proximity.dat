Consequently if the same scholar sits {{on the board of}} editors of two journals, those journals could have some common elements in their editorial <b>policies.</b> The <b>proximity</b> <b>of</b> the editorial <b>policies</b> <b>of</b> two scientific journals can be assessed by the number of common editors sitting on their boards. A database of all editors of ECONLIT journals is used. The structure of the network generated by interlocking editorship is explored by applying the instruments of network analysis. Evidence has been found of a compact network containing different components. This is interpreted {{as the result of a}} plurality of perspectives about the appropriate methods for the investigation of problems and the construction of theories within the domain of economics...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{analyzes}} the proximity {{in relation to}} the new meanings assumed by the concept in retail geography. The most recent phenomena of post-hierarchical organization of the urban spaces and the development of e-commerce lead to consider, in addition to the geographical, a multiplicity <b>of</b> dimensions <b>of</b> <b>proximity.</b> Multiplicity becomes significant especially considering the commerce-city relationship through the interpretative key of consumption. Analysing in a critical perspective the retail-led <b>policies</b> <b>of</b> urban regeneration, the contribution highlights the use <b>of</b> geographical <b>proximity</b> as a new imperative for the commerce of the city-centre, in a lack of tools and practices more closely tied to the new demands of spatial and temporal proximity expressed by the consumers...|$|R

40|$|The {{proximity}} {{concept is}} used {{in many different ways}} in the literature. These dimensions <b>of</b> <b>proximity</b> are, however, defined and measured in many different (sometimes even contradictory) ways, show large amounts of overlap, and often are under- or over-specified. The goal {{of this paper is to}} specify the different dimensions <b>of</b> <b>proximity</b> relevant in inter-organizational collaboration more precisely and to provide definitions of these dimensions. The research presented contributes to reducing the ambiguity <b>of</b> the <b>proximity</b> concept as used in the literature. Based on the above, the following research question is addressed in this paper: ‘Which dimensions <b>of</b> <b>proximity</b> are relevant in inter-organizational collaboration and how are they defined?’ A systematic literature review is presented in order to disentangle the dimensions <b>of</b> the <b>proximity</b> concept. Based on this literature review, three dimensions <b>of</b> <b>proximity</b> relevant in inter-organizational collaboration are distinguished: geographical proximity, organizational proximity and technological proximity. Examples (case studies) from the literature are used to illustrate the current conceptual ambiguity as well as to clarify how the proposed dimensions <b>of</b> <b>proximity</b> reduce this conceptual ambiguity...|$|R

This paper explores the impact <b>of</b> <b>proximity</b> {{measures}} on knowledge exchange measured by granted research and development (R&D) collaboration projects in German NUTS- 3 regions. The results are obtained from a spatial interaction model including eigenvector spatial filters. Not only geographical but also other forms <b>of</b> <b>proximity</b> (technological, organizational and institutional) have a significant influence on the emergence of collaborations. Furthermore, the results suggest interdependences between proximity measures. Nevertheless, the analysis does not show that other forms <b>of</b> <b>proximity</b> may compensate for missing geographical proximity.

30|$|As nanotechnologies’ further {{advancement}} {{depends on}} effective integration of scientific disciplines and industrial sectors, {{while at the}} same time several dimensions <b>of</b> <b>proximity</b> may be lacking, it is relevant to investigate the relationship between personal proximity and related kinds <b>of</b> <b>proximity</b> and nanotechnology research collaborations.|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} aims to {{find out}} the importance <b>of</b> <b>proximity</b> between research collaborators within a science-intensive sector. This research uses the biotechnological field. This is done by using regression analysis on scientometric data from Web of Science and using network analysis tools to analyse the citation impact of publications. There are five different dimensions <b>of</b> <b>proximity</b> distinguished: cognitive, organisational, social, institutional, and geographical. In addition to this, four of these five dimensions <b>of</b> <b>proximity</b> are studied on their relative importance of nearness. This paper shows that for all the dimensions <b>of</b> <b>proximity</b> between the authors of a publication under study, the organisational dimension and the cognitive dimension show a significant relationship {{to the quality of the}} research in terms of citation impact...|$|R

40|$|International audienceAlthough the {{importance}} <b>of</b> <b>proximity</b> has been highlighted, it {{remains an open}} question which types and levels <b>of</b> <b>proximity</b> are critical for knowledge networks. This paper addresses this issue by examining the role of spatial, social and cognitive <b>proximity</b> <b>of</b> personal knowledge relationships in the Cambridge IT Cluster. It is shown that distinguishing between sub-dimensions <b>of</b> cognitive <b>proximity</b> can clarify the 'proximity paradox'. Moreover, the results highlight that local relationships enable access to cognitively more diverse knowledge than non-local ones. Finally, the paper provides empirical evidence of a compensation mechanism: distance in one dimension is compensated by proximity in at least one other dimension.

40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to draw some lines about the {{application}} <b>of</b> <b>proximity</b> analysis in business relations, be there face to face exchanges or distant relations, with a peculiar attention to innovative behaviors, whether they imply local interactions, virtual exchanges or mobility of white collars and engineers.

40|$|We {{initiate}} {{a study of}} non-interactive proofs <b>of</b> <b>proximity.</b> These proof-systems consist of a verifier that wishes to ascertain the validity of a given statement, using a short (sublinear length) explicitly given proof, and a sublinear number of queries to its input. Since the verifier cannot even read the entire input, we only require it to reject inputs that are far from being valid. Thus, the verifier is only assured <b>of</b> the <b>proximity</b> <b>of</b> the statement to a correct one. Such proof-systems {{can be viewed as}} the N P (or more accurately MA) analogue of property testing. We explore both the power and limitations of non-interactive proofs <b>of</b> <b>proximity.</b> We show that such proof-systems can be exponentially stronger than property testers, but are exponentially weaker than the interactive proofs <b>of</b> <b>proximity</b> studied by Rothblum, Vadhan and Wigderson (STOC 2013). In addition, we show a natural problem that has a full and (almost) tight multiplicative trade-off between the length of the proof and the verifier’s query complexity. On the negative side, we also show that there exist properties for which even a linearly-long (non-interactive) proof <b>of</b> <b>proximity</b> cannot significantly reduce the query complexity...|$|R
