40|$|A {{numerical}} {{investigation into}} the aerodynamic characteristics and aeroelastic stability of a proposed footbridge across a motorway {{in the north of}} England has been undertaken. The longer than usual span, along with the unusual nature of the pedestrian barriers, indicated that the deck configuration was likely to be beyond the reliable limits of the British design code BD 49 / 01. In particular, the investigation focussed on the susceptibility of the bridge due to flutter, and to assess if the design wind speeds could be met satisfactorily. The calculations were performed using the discrete vortex method, DIVEX, developed at the Universities of Glasgow and Strathclyde. DIVEX has been successfully validated {{on a wide range of}} problems, including the aeroelastic response of bridge deck sections. The proposed deck configuration, which incorporated a <b>pedestrian</b> <b>barrier</b> composed of angled flat plates, was found to be unstable at low wind speeds with the plates having a strong turning effect on the flow at the leading edge of the deck. DIVEX was used to assess a number of alternative design options, investigating the stability with respect to flutter for each configuration. Reducing the number of flat plates and their angle to the deck lessened the effect of the barrier on the overall aerodynamic characteristics and increased the stability of the bridge to an acceptable level, with the critical flutter speed in excess of the specified design speed...|$|E

40|$|In New Zealand {{pedestrian}} {{infrastructure is}} not a robust area of transport planning. As a funding class it receives minimal monetary allocation. This thesis argues design interventions in the pedestrian environment need to be both responsive to the surrounding context and effective in promoting walking patronage. To achieve this goal this thesis argues that the current process used by central authorities and local authorities for researching, designing, and implementing pedestrian infrastructure, needs to change. As a solution this thesis develops a new methodology for researching, designing and implementing pedestrian infrastructure. The methodology is developed {{through a series of}} design experiments using Central Wellington as a site. The methodology uses a multi paradigm framework adopted from landscape perception research, which allows it to successfully alternate between ‘top down’ expert orientated approaches. For example, on one hand the methodology uses standardized typological solutions as a cost and time efficient approach to resolving <b>pedestrian</b> <b>barriers</b> to walking; as well as a ‘top down’ macro scale urban analysis in order to ensure any resources being spent at a micro scale street level are also improving larger urban scale problems in the pedestrian network. While on the other hand uses a ‘bottom up’ qualitative approach through a newly developed ‘cognitive survey and interview technique’, to research {{from the perspective of the}} public where <b>pedestrian</b> accessibility <b>barriers</b> to walking are located in the built environment. The research is significant as it reveals new insight into the practical application of a standardized typological approach to pedestrian design. In particular it reveals how a new hybrid methodology combining a ‘top down expert’ and utilitarian approach, with a ‘bottom up qualitative’ and contextual approach, makes for efficient employment of design resources when implementing pedestrian infrastructure...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} a {{continuation}} of a previous one, Sanz-Andrés, Santiago-Prowald, Baker and Quinn (J. Wind Eng. Ind. Aerodyn. 91 (2003) 925) concerning the loads generated on a structural panel (traffic sign) by vehicle running along the road, although obviously, the results are also applicable to the effects of other moving vehicles such as trains. The structural panel was modelized as a large plate whose largest dimension is perpendicular to the vehicle motion direction. In this paper a similar approach is used to develop a mathematical model for the vehicle-induced load on <b>pedestrian</b> <b>barriers,</b> modelized as a large plate whose largest dimension is parallel to the vehicle motion direction. The purpose of the work is to develop a model simple enough to give analytical results, although with the physical phenomena correctly accounted for, such as to be able to explain, at least qualitatively, the main characteristics of the phenomenon, as observed in the experiments performed by Quinn et al. (J. Wind Eng. Ind. Aerodyn. 89 (2001) 831). Actually, in spite of the model simplicity, results of the theoretical model show a reasonable good quantitative agreement with the experimental results. The aim of this and previous publications is to provide to the transport infrastructure community with some simple tools that can help to explain, and in some cases also to compute, the unsteady loading produced by moving vehicles on persons and installations placed close to the roads or tracks...|$|R

40|$|This study aims to {{find the}} factors {{affecting}} residents near transit stations within 1000 Â m, who {{are referred to as}} transit-oriented development (TOD) residents, to reduce motorcycle taxi use and encourage walking to stations. These two modes of commuting are the most popular among over 85 % of residents. However, motorcycle taxis are the main <b>pedestrian</b> <b>barriers</b> that hinder easy access and walkability in TODs of Bangkok, because they ride, stop, and provide services on sidewalks. From 2013 to 2015, these problems substantially increased the number of motorcycle taxis that are not willing and able to follow the rules. The increasing number of pedestrian accidents on sidewalks is related to {{the increase in the number}} of motorcycle taxis. According to a survey on pedestrian safety with 249 respondents, over 25 % of walkers feel unsafe to walk, while 40 % of motorcycle-taxi users riding to stations do not walk because they are afraid of accidents. In modal split, the share of walking reduces from 76 % for areas <Â  500 Â m, to 25 % for areas between 500 and 1000 Â m from transit stations, respectively. Hence, the number of motorcycle taxis in the 500 â 1000 m range is twice as high compared to that within the 500 Â m area. If motorcycle taxi users would accept a longer walking distance to station by 36 Â m or would be willing to walk to the station within 9. 15 Â min, 54 % of them may switch to walking to stations. Moreover, based on the estimation results of the logistic regression models, middle-adult aged residents, office employees, residents owning a car, and people living far from stations are less likely to walk. Average income households and commuters during non-peak hours tend to use motorcycle taxis more. On the other hand, residents living far from stations tend to use motorcycle taxis less, because most of the motorcycle taxi services are located near transit stations.

50|$|The Quarterbridge {{spans the}} River Glass {{at this point}} and forms part of the {{boundary}} between the parishes of Braddan and Onchan. A bridge at this point was washed away during a storm in 1727 and replaced with a two-arched structure 30 yards downstream. The local mason Charles Scott was contracted in 1809 to build a single-arched span across the River Glass on the present alignment for a price of £280. The bridge was extended upstream in 1862 and there was a further extension downstream in the early 1900s. The public house on the site, The Union Hotel, was damaged by fire in 1830 and replaced by the present Quarterbridge Hotel. A gatehouse and nearby Quarterbridge rail-crossing were built in 1873 for the new Isle of Man Railway's Douglas to Peel line. Road widening on the A1 Peel Road during the winter of 1937 included the demolition of the Brown Bobby public house and road work at the Quarterbridge road junction. In the 1930s a distinctive roadside cafe was built in a modular prefabricated concrete Post-Modernist design on the junction with the A2 Quarterbridge Road. During the winter of 1953/54 road widening to the approach to the Quarterbridge occurred for the 1954 Isle of Man TT Races. In 1963 a roundabout was added to the road junction at the Quarterbridge. In winter 1986/87 there was further reprofiling at the Quarterbridge road junction, with a new road traffic system including two mini-roundabouts, and the removal of a traffic island and cherry trees. In July 2008, the Department of Transport announced a £4 million road safety scheme for the road junction, including the building of a new roundabout and the demolition of the Quarterbridge Hotel. In February/March 2011 the Highways Division of the Department of Infrastructure modified the junction, including major road resurfacing work, improved drainage, elevation changes and repositioning of <b>pedestrian</b> <b>barriers</b> adjacent to the Quarterbridge Hotel.|$|R

2500|$|Major {{historical}} {{improvements to}} the city's road network include Thomas Telford's Holyhead Road (now part of A41), which was constructed between 1819 and 1826 to improve communications between London and Holyhead, and hence to Ireland. [...] The majority of work within the city saw improvement to the contemporary network, though the both Wellington Road in Bilston and the cutting at the Rock near Tettenhall were newly constructed for the road, although the improvements at The Rock were constructed by the local Turnpike Trust rather than Telford himself. In 1927, the A4123 Birmingham-Wolverhampton New Road was constructed as both an unemployment relief project, and to relieve pressure on Telford's road through the Black Country. It was the first purpose built inter-city road in the United Kingdom within the 20th century, and {{was said to be}} the longest stretch of new road in Britain since the Romans. It took just three years to complete and cost £600,000. Also in 1927, the first automatic traffic lights in the United Kingdom were installed in Princes Square in the city centre.

40|$|Perception {{of safety}} and comfort of bicycle {{infrastructure}} {{is an important factor}} influencing the use of bicycles. Cyclists can be found all over India. In urban areas presently, mostly captive riders choose to bicycle as no other viable options of travel are available to them. This study discusses perceptions of these captive riders as compared to a group of not yet riding (potential) cyclists. A stated preference survey to estimate the perception of captive users and potential users on cycling was conducted. The perception of risk among captive riders and potential riders does not show much difference as against popular beliefs. Both the captive users as well as the potential users focus on physical safety and the difficulties in crossing the intersections. Differences arise in perception of comfort / attractiveness and <b>barriers.</b> <b>Pedestrians</b> / bus commuters waiting at the curb side lane are considered as predominant barriers (about 28 %) by potential users while captive riders are more tolerant to them. Results indicate that perception {{of safety and}} comfort are not related to age, gender, type of zone and distance travelled. However, the presence of informal sector on the street side is social security element and attractive for providing services for captive cyclists. The potential users consider informal sector as a barrier, although, lighting seems to be important to them. Results of SP experiment shows potential users perceive slope as bigger threat to bicycle compatibility as compared to captive riders. Captive riders prefer wider roads against the narrow roads preferred by potential cyclists. Land use mix seems to be not a major concern, while low density areas are preferred. The results can be used for evaluating area bicycle compatibility both for captive and potential users...|$|R

Four low-income senior housing sites in San Diego, CA {{were randomly assigned to}} an advocacy program or physical activity control (n = 50 seniors; n = 20 students). A mixed methods evaluation used pre-post surveys, focus groups, and direct observation. The primary outcome was changes in seniors’ advocacy confidence and skills. Other outcomes included advocacy actions and outcomes, changes in intergenerational attitudes, study feasibility, and physical activity measured via accelerometer. Main analyses were conducted using repeated measures ANOVAs to examine time by condition interactions. Results showed that seniors in the advocacy condition increased their advocacy outcome efficacy (p =. 03) and knowledge of resources (p =. 04) more than seniors in the physical activity condition. Almost all seniors in the advocacy condition completed an audit of nearby streets, made an advocacy presentation, and submitted an online advocacy request. Immediate results included repairs to three crosswalks, a sidewalk, and a water meter box. The City approved requests for additional lighting, curb cuts, and crosswalk markings. Seniors in the advocacy condition improved their attitudes about younger adults (p =. 02). Students in both conditions reported increased respect for older adults and desire for future intergenerational work. Students in the physical activity condition decreased ageism (p =. 02). Seniors’ accelerometer-measured physical activity did not significantly increase, but self-reported transportation activity increased in the physical activity condition (p =. 04). Students in the physical activity condition decreased sedentary behavior (p =. 05). Process evaluation showed feasibility of recruitment, 89 % attendance rate, and intervention fidelity and quality.
