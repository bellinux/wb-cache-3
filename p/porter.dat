5|$|Edwards {{was born}} in Cleveland, Ohio, the son of local {{merchant}} William Edwards, and Lucia Ransom. He graduated last in his class from the United States Military Academy in 1883. Upon his graduation from West Point, Edwards was appointed a second lieutenant in the Infantry Branch, serving with the 23rd Infantry Regiment. For {{the next several years}} Edwards served at various posts, including Fort Union, Fort <b>Porter,</b> Cleveland, Ohio (commanding the guard at the tomb of President Garfield), and Fort Davis. While stationed at Fort <b>Porter</b> he met Bessie Rochester <b>Porter,</b> {{a member of the family}} that included Peter Buell <b>Porter,</b> for whom the fort was named, and they were married in 1889.|$|E
5|$|<b>Porter</b> {{edited the}} Constellation, a {{newspaper}} in New York City that published humorous stories. <b>Porter</b> became interested in sports, and concentrated on the emerging sports journalism field. In December 1831, <b>Porter</b> published {{the first issue of}} a new newspaper devoted to covering sports and other recreational activities, which he called The Spirit of the Times. <b>Porter</b> imitated Bell's Life in London, a contemporary English publication covering the same subjects. The first attempt at Spirit of the Times failed quickly, and <b>Porter</b> sold the magazine to C. J. B. Fisher, who merged it into Fisher's publication of the Traveller, and the Spirit was combined with the Traveller as the Traveller and Spirit of the Times. During the brief period that <b>Porter</b> operated the Spirit, he employed Horace Greeley as a typesetter. When <b>Porter</b> sold the Spirit, he then went to work at the New-Yorker, which was edited at the time by Horace Greeley. In January 1835 <b>Porter</b> purchased the Traveller and Spirit of the Times and renamed the newspaper back to Spirit of the Times, returning to editing it. This version of the Spirit managed to survive, although with some initial financial difficulties. <b>Porter</b> focused on selling his paper in the south and west of the United States, and emphasized subjects of use to his readers, such as cattle breeding, farm methods, books of interest, as well as sports. The newspaper was published weekly.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the cultural and}} socio-economic profiles of <b>porters</b> in Accra, capital of Ghana. <b>Porters</b> are individuals who carry goods in and around markets and commercial centers in cities for a fee. A majority of the <b>porters</b> migrate from northern or rural {{parts of the country}} to live and work in southern cities. Findings indicate that <b>porters</b> have very little or no education and are from very poor socio-economic backgrounds. Male <b>porters</b> tend to be slightly older, have a little education, married and living with their families in Accra. Female <b>porters</b> are younger, temporary <b>porters,</b> and in addition to low socio-economic background are affected by cultural factors...|$|R

5|$|The Panic of 1837 {{hurt the}} Spirit's circulation, but <b>Porter</b> responded by buying out his main competition, the American Turf Register and Sporting Magazine {{and moved it}} to New York City. <b>Porter</b> edited the Turf Register until the paper stopped being {{published}} in 1844. <b>Porter</b> continued the publication of annual stallion lists and the publication of lists of horses owned by breeders. However, {{the purchase of the}} American Turf Register strained Porter's finances, and he sold the Spirit to another printer, John Richards, who retained <b>Porter</b> as editor. The 1840s were prosperous, but in the 1850s the magazine again encountered difficulties. Around 1855, <b>Porter</b> left Richards' paper, and in 1856, another printer, George Wilkes, began a new sporting newspaper, which he called Porter's Spirit of the Times, and employed <b>Porter</b> as editor.|$|E

2500|$|The second {{attempt was}} started on 2 June by Norton and Somervell {{with the support}} of 6 <b>porters.</b> They were {{astonished}} to see Mallory and Bruce descending so early and wondered if their <b>porters</b> would also refuse to continue beyond Camp V. This fear was partially realized when 2 <b>porters</b> were sent “home” to Camp IV, but the other 4 <b>porters</b> and the 2 English climbers spent the night in Camp V.

The route continues on a southeast track through <b>Porter,</b> passing a mixture of rural and residential areas on its way into the hamlet of <b>Porter</b> Center, where NY93 enters an intersection with <b>Porter</b> Center Road (CR57). Another southeastward stretch brings the route across Twelvemile Creek and into the hamlet of Ransomville, where NY93 becomes the community's main street.

50|$|Several of the PTS <b>porters</b> in the Glc family lack {{their own}} IIA domains and instead use the glucose IIA protein (IIAglc or Crr). Most of these <b>porters</b> have the B and C domains linked {{together}} in a single polypeptide chain. A cysteyl residue in the IIB domain is phosphorylated by direct phosphoryl transfer from IIAglc(his~P) or one of its homologues. Those <b>porters</b> which lack a IIA domain include the maltose, arbutin-salicin-cellobiose, trehalose, putative glucoside and sucrose <b>porters</b> of E. coli. Most, but not all Scr <b>porters</b> of other bacteria also lack a IIA domain.|$|R
40|$|A {{variety of}} {{underlying}} conditions {{increase the likelihood}} of children entering the labor force. Nearly half of Nepal’s population between 5 and 14 years of age is economically active, many in conditions classified by the International Labor Organization as ‘the worst forms of child labor’. In order to assess the relationship between <b>portering</b> and well-being outcomes, including diet, nutrition status, injury and social and behavioral risks, a cross-sectional study was conducted among long distance child <b>porters</b> in Eastern Nepal. <b>Porters</b> were consistently less well off than their non-portering peers according to a variety of indicators. <b>Porters</b> were 2. 2 (95 % CI: 1. 4 – 3. 4) times as likely not to have attended school in the past month and frequency of attendance was significantly lower among <b>porters.</b> <b>Porters</b> had worse diets and significantly lower Body mass indexes than controls; prevalence of anemia was 30 % and the risk of anemia was 1. 9 (95 % CI: 1. 1 – 3. 1) times greater for <b>porters</b> as compared with controls. Injury rates within the past year were similar between the two groups, with 88 % of participants reporting being injured. Prevalence of alcohol use among <b>porters</b> was 38 % and <b>porters</b> were 2. 9 (95 CI: 1. 7 – 4. 9) times more likely to consume alcohol than controls. Risk of sexual assault was 10. 1 (95 CI: 2. 3 – 43. 9) times greater among <b>porters</b> as compared with their non-portering peers, and 91 % indicated they felt <b>portering</b> negatively impacted their general well-being. Findings indicate that despite the Nepalese government’s legislative efforts to regulate to the <b>portering</b> industry, <b>portering</b> children experience a substantially increased risk of negative physical, emotional and educational outcomes due to their involvement in exploitive and dangerous work. The long-term ramifications of <b>portering</b> are harmful to the well-being of children, and in the long run, lack of education may reduce employment options and the chance to escape from a life of continued poverty...|$|R

5|$|At {{the end of}} 1891 he was {{considered}} by many to be the top two-year-old. During the 1892 season he earned £13,023, the second highest of any horse and only bettered by La Fleche.

When Orme was at his best, John <b>Porter</b> rated him 7 to 10 pounds inferior to Ormonde, whom <b>Porter</b> also trained. <b>Porter</b> also believed that Orme was a better racehorse at age four than he had been at two and three.|$|E
