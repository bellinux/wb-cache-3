40|$|The {{activity}} of Drosophila melanogaster DNA polymerase alpha on DNA-primed single-stranded DNA templates has been examined. The DNA templates contain a 1471 -nucleotide sequence from the heavy-strand origin region of mouse mtDNA {{inserted into the}} single-stranded bacteriophage vector M 13 Gori 1. Preferred sites for pausing of in vitro DNA synthesis have been mapped within the cloned mtDNA insert and in the G 4 cDNA strand origin which is contained within the vector DNA. Analysis of nascent DNA strands from replicative intermediates has revealed that pause sites are discrete and lie both at the positions of predicted stable dyads and in regions lacking the potential for formation of such structures. The patterns of kinetic pause sites observed for Escherichia coli DNA polymerase III holoenzyme is qualitatively similar to that found for DNA polymerase alpha.

In the semantic representation of the NP the additional meaning indicated in the translation is accounted for by the introduction of a suprasegmental one-place predicate (inversion), taking the numeral as its argument. In the sentence, the <b>pause</b> <b>signals</b> a contrastive meaning (‘books, as opposed to, for instance, jour- nals'). Of more interest and importance, however, is the enigmatic use of genitive plural also in combinations with the numerals 2 - 4, which other- wise take the genitive singular. It is suggested that numerals take two ar- guments, one naming the actual set of, for instance, five books, the other naming the set of all possible books. As a rule, the bigger set is expressed by means of a preposition phrase, but in this particular construction it is expressed by the initial genitive plural form...|$|R

40|$|The Saccharomyces cerevisiae {{polymerase}} I (polI) transcription terminator utilizes a DNA-binding protein (Reb 1 p) {{as part of}} {{a signal}} that causes the polymerase to pause prior to release from the template.

Release efficiency is maximal when the lac repressor causes polI to pause in exactly the same position that Reb 1 p would have caused it to pause, suggesting that polI must be precisely positioned for transcript release to occur.

We discuss possible mechanisms whereby this polI release element might function...|$|E

The two major transcripts in the paused complex have 3 '-ends mapping to 15 and 21 nt upstream of the T 3 box, remain bound to the template in 0. 25 % Sarkosyl, are subject to pyrophosphorolysis and can be chased into longer transcripts. Mutations that reduce overall termination also affect pausing, indicating that pausing is a limiting step in the termination process. Oligonucleotide competition experiments, furthermore, suggest that pausing requires a DNA binding factor. The data support a model in which the first step leading to transcription termination by pol I in Xenopus is pausing of the elongation complex upstream of the T 3 box...|$|E

40|$|The poly(A) {{signal and}} {{downstream}} elements with transcriptional pausing activity {{play an important}} role in termination of RNA polymerase II transcription. We show that an intronic sequence derived from the plant seed protein gene (AmA 1) specifically acts as a transcriptional terminator in the fission yeast, Schizosaccharomyces pombe. The 3 ′-end points of mRNA encoded by the AmA 1 gene were mapped at different positions in S. pombe and in native cells of Amaranthus hypochondriacus. Deletion analyses of the AmA 1 intronic sequence revealed that multiple elements essential for proper transcriptional termination in S. pombe include two site-determining elements (SDEs) and three downstream sequence elements. RT–PCR analyses detected transcripts up to the second SDE. This is the first report showing that the highly conserved mammalian poly(A) signal, AAUAAA, is also functional in S. pombe. The poly(A) site was determined as Y(A) both in native and heterologous systems but at different positions. Deletion of these cis-elements abolished 3 ′-end processing in S. pombe and a single point mutation in this motif reduced the activity by 70 % while enhancing activity at downstream SDE. These results indicate that the bipartite sequence elements as signals for 3 ′-end processing in fission yeast act in tandem with other cis-acting elements. A comparison of these elements in the AmA 1 intron that function as a transcriptional terminator in fission yeast with that of its native genes showed that both require an AT-rich distal and proximal upstream element. However, these sequences are not identical. Transcription run-on analysis indicates that elongating RNA polymerase II molecules accumulate over these <b>pause</b> <b>signals,</b> maximal at 611 – 949 nt. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the AmA 1 intronic terminator sequence acts in a position-independent manner when placed within another gene...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIntrinsic {{transcription}} termination plays {{a crucial}} role in regulating gene expression in prokaryotes. After a short <b>pause,</b> the termination <b>signal</b> appears in RNA as a hairpin that destabilizes the elongation complex (EC). We demonstrate that negative and positive termination factors control the efficiency of termination primarily through a direct modulation of hairpin folding and, to a much lesser extent, by changing pausing at the point of termination. The mechanism controlling hairpin formation at the termination point relies on weak protein interactions with single-stranded RNA, which corresponds to the upstream portion of the hairpin. Escherichia coli NusA protein destabilizes these interactions and thus promotes hairpin folding and termination. Stabilization of these contacts by phage λ N protein leads to antitermination...|$|R
25|$|RNA {{polymerase}} III can terminate transcription efficiently without {{involvement of}} additional factors. The Pol III termination signal {{consists of a}} stretch of thymines (on the nontemplate strand) located within 40bp downstream from the 3' end of mature RNAs. The poly-T termination <b>signal</b> <b>pauses</b> Pol III and causes it to back track to the nearest RNA hairpin to become a “dead-end” complex. Consistent with the allosteric mechanism of termination, the RNA hairpin allosterically opens Pol III and causes the elongation complex to disintegrate.

RNA-duplex-dependent termination is an ancient mechanism that dates back to the last universal common ancestor.|$|R

This compressed complex isomerizes to a paused conformation by an ∼ 10 by jump of its downstream DNA contact and simultaneous extrusion of an RNA hairpin that stabilizes the paused conformation.

40|$|Adaptation of {{bacterial}} cells to diverse habitats {{relies on the}} ability of RNA polymerase to respond to various regulatory signals.

In this study we present a comprehensive comparative analysis of RNA polymerases from two distantly related bacterial species, Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis, using a panel of in vitro transcription assays.

5000|$|At the {{transcript}} level, {{disruption of the}} EAR motif leads to {{a significant decrease in}} the expression of distally located eps genes (epsF-O) without affecting proximal genes (epsC-E). Consistent with this observation, several potential intrinsic terminator hairpins were found inside the epsF coding region. [...] A wild-type EAR element is capable of promoting transcriptional readthrough of these epsF terminator sites. In contrast, mutational disruption of EAR instead permits termination at the epsF terminators. The EAR element also promotes readthrough of heterologous termination sites. From these data it was hypothesized that the EAR element controls eps expression through a processive antitermination mechanism to ensure the complete synthesis of the 16 kilobase operon. [...] Processive antitermination, as opposed to {{the transcript}}ion attenuation mechanism typically used by other cis-acting regulatory RNAs, is a process wherein the transcription elongation complex is altered by accessory factors to become resistant to <b>pausing</b> and termination <b>signals.</b> So far, EAR is the only processive antitermination system specific for Gram-positive bacteria.

Mutations inactivating prfC, encoding RF 3 (release factor 3), displayed a similar phenotype. Conversely, production of RF 4 from a plasmid increased the thermosensitivity of the peptidyl-tRNA hydrolase mutant. In vitro measurements of peptidyl-tRNA release from ribosomes <b>paused</b> at stop <b>signals</b> or sense codons confirmed that RF 3 and RF 4 were able to stimulate peptidyl-tRNA release from ribosomes, and showed that this action of RF 4 required the presence of translocation factor EF 2, known to be needed for the function of RF 4 in ribosome recycling.

I investigate how these negative information events impact decisions in the settings of scientific publishing and drug development. In the first essay, I study the impact of scientific retractions on citation patterns and funding in the retracted paper's intellectual field. I investigate how the retraction disclosure and affected field's characteristics influence the extent of these spillover effects. The second essay evaluates how retraction scandals damage individual scientists' reputations. This study shows that the magnitude of the retraction penalty depends on a scientist's prominence and whether or not the retraction event involved "misconduct.

Each registration consisted of seven speech utterances and was subjected to an acoustic analysis {{as well as to}} a perceptual evaluation, the latter involving eight parameters like "overall impression", "tonicity", etc. Since the goal of our work is to find out the best acoustical measurement for supporting perception and making it precise, it seemed logical to strive for a perceptually based acoustic analysis. We therefore performed the analysis by means of a peripheral auditory model with a built-in fundamental frequency (pitch) extractor. From the frame-level outputs (a frame is 10 ms) of the analyser, global objective parameters, such as (1) the percentage of voiced frames, (2) the average voicing evidence, (3) the voicing length distribution and (4) the fundamental frequency jitter, were computed for the different speech utterances. So as to reduce the parameter variability arising from the nature of the speech utterances (e. g., the presence of <b>pauses</b> in the <b>signal,</b> errors caused by the pitch extractor, etc.), the objective parameters were computed using non-standard averaging schemes involving energy weighting and frame selection. A statistical analysis of the objective parameters confirms that the quality of tracheo-esophageal speech is superior to that of esophageal speech, but inferior to that of normal speech and speech with the preservation of one vocal fold. Correlations between the objective parameters and the perceptual parameters are moderate. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The {{writer is}} {{interested}} in analyzing hesitation pauses used in conversational interaction produced by the English Letters and Language Department s Students at the State Islamic University of Malang. This study {{is focused on the}} categorization of hesitation pauses and also the reason of producing hesitation based on the context of situation when the hesitation pauses are produced by the English Letters and Language Department s Students at the State Islamic University of Malang. The researcher hopes that this study gives contribution toward the psycholinguistics study especially on hesitation phenomena. This study is a descriptive qualitative research as it concerns with the description of hesitation pauses founded in the utterances of English Letters and Language Department s Students at the State Islamic University of Malang used in conversational interaction, and the reason of producing hesitation based on the context of situation. The design requires data presenting form of word and utterances rather than numbers. In order to obtain the valid data, the writer applied observation instruments through recording the speeches of the English Letters and Language Departments students at the State Islamic University of Malang, listening carefully for every dialog or conversation to cross check with the scrip of the speeches, taking note of every possible hesitation pauses, tones and expression, and mostly the utterances are categorized into silent pause and filled pause. The writer found that hesitation pauses take an important role in natural conversation, especially in turn-taking in English conversation. They used silent and filled <b>pauses</b> as a <b>signal</b> to open the conversation, to take place for the speaker in turn-taking, to think first before continuing their speech, and to hold the floor. Based on the data analysis, the writer has some suggestions that useful for the speakers in speaking. The writer suggest to the speakers to minimize the usage of silent and filled pauses when the speakers wanted to hold the floor, because thus will give bad effect in speech production. The writer also suggests for the next researcher who studied this topic would investigate pauses in turn-taking from speeches of native speaker. So that we can find out more reasons using hesitation pauses...|$|R
