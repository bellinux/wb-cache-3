5|$|As {{part of her}} {{preparation}} for entering the studio, Bush toured pubs with the KT Bush Band. However, for her début album, The Kick Inside (1978), she was persuaded to use established session musicians, some of whom she would retain even after she had brought her bandmates back on board. Her brother Paddy played the harmonica and mandolin, unlike on later albums where he would play more exotic instruments such as the balalaika and didgeridoo. Stuart Elliott <b>played</b> <b>some</b> of the drums and would become her main drummer on subsequent albums.|$|E
5|$|Deacon {{grew up in}} Oadby, Leicestershire, playing bass in a local band, The Opposition, {{before moving}} to study {{electronics}} in Chelsea College, London. He joined Queen in 1971 {{on the strength of}} his musical and electronic skills, particularly the home-made Deacy Amp which guitarist Brian May used to create guitar orchestras throughout Queen's career. From the third album, Sheer Heart Attack, onwards, he wrote at least one song per album, several of which became hits. As well as bass, Deacon <b>played</b> <b>some</b> guitar and keyboards on Queen's studio work, but was the only member never to sing on their records.|$|E

5|$|Bosanquet {{improved}} his record for Oxford in 1899, scoring two fifties and taking five wickets on three occasions before the University match. Against Cambridge, he failed with the bat but took seven wickets for 89 {{runs in the}} first innings. Bosanquet's record earned him selection for the Gentlemen against the Players; in this prestigious match he took only one wicket but scored 61 runs. He played another two matches for Middlesex and ended {{the season with a}} batting record of 419 runs in all matches, at an average of 27.93, and 55 wickets at 22.72.

5|$|Despite the game's {{expanded}} memory resources, reviewers {{felt that the}} game's visuals were only marginally—if at all—better than for contemporary games, such as the previous year's Banjo-Kazooie. In fact, IGN felt that Donkey Kong 64 was not as pretty as Banjo-Kazooie, especially in its water and backgrounds, though it still ranked among the console's prettiest games. The setting is barren and nondescript at first, and only later introduces lighting effects and richer textures. IGN hoped for more from Rare, and while its reviewer praised the game's particle effects (e.g., in the desert wind), he considered the game's dynamic lighting overused. N64 Magazine said that the enhanced effects were most often used for decoration, though they also <b>played</b> <b>some</b> role in puzzles based on illuminating paths. Reviewers noted graphical difficulties even with the extra memory, such as frame rate slowdowns and distant features not appearing in any detail, though overall they considered the added graphical flourishes commendable. GameSpot also saw a lack of variety in the game's environment.|$|E
5|$|During the 1998 season, Burns {{recorded}} similar batting averages to {{the previous}} season, but was rarely used as a bowler. Wisden noted that he <b>played</b> <b>some</b> good first-class innings, but needed to be more consistent; an improvement he made in 1999. That following year, Burns achieved a batting average in excess of thirty for the first time, and scored the maiden century of his first-class career. Facing Leicestershire, who had not lost in the County Championship for 21 months, Burns scored 109, and shared a 244-run partnership with Peter Bowler to help Somerset to victory by 9 wickets. His second century that season came in a defeat to Worcestershire; chasing 316 runs {{to win in the}} fourth innings, Somerset were reduced to 56 for three. Burns played an attacking innings, hitting 105 runs from 103 deliveries to give his side a chance of victory, but Worcestershire eventually won by 26 runs.|$|E
5|$|In 1939, {{the last}} season before the Second World War, Leyland scored 1,238 runs at 39.93 and took 23 wickets. He {{served in the}} army during the war: first as a {{sergeant}} instructor, and was later commissioned as lieutenant. Between his army duties, he played cricket in the Bradford League, and played for various wartime teams, including ones representing the army. In 1945, he <b>played</b> <b>some</b> non-first-class games for teams representing Yorkshire and a first-class game for Yorkshire against Lancashire. Choosing to continue his career after the war to help the Yorkshire team become re-established, Leyland played a last full season in 1946 when he scored 632 runs at 21.06, with a highest score of 88, and took 16 wickets at 14.70; against Warwickshire, he took seven for 36. During August 1946, he announced his retirement, but in the following two seasons, he appeared in some end-of-season first-class games. He ended his first-class career in 1948 with 33,660 runs at 40.50 and 466 wickets at 29.31.|$|E

5|$|In the 1880s, Alfred Comyn Lyall, an {{administrator}} of the British Raj who also studied history, revisited Tod's classification and asserted that the Rajput society was in fact tribal, based on kinship rather than feudal vassalage. He had previously generally agreed with Tod, who acknowledged claims that blood-ties <b>played</b> <b>some</b> sort of role {{in the relationship between}} princes and vassals in many states. In shifting the emphasis from a feudal to a tribal basis, Lyall was able to deny the possibility that the Rajput kingdoms might gain sovereignty. If Rajput society was not feudal, then it was not on the same trajectory that European nations had followed, thereby forestalling any need to consider that they might evolve into sovereign states. There was thus no need for Britain to consider itself to be illegitimately governing them.|$|E
5|$|In {{the later}} 1950s, Constantine {{supported}} the campaign, led by James, to appoint West Indies cricket's first black captain; {{the success of}} black people like Constantine in attaining government positions while not permitted to captain the cricket team was {{a key factor in}} an ultimately successful campaign. While in government, Constantine assisted {{in the development of the}} West Indies Federation, as a step towards the independence of the islands, and his fame and familiarity with Britain <b>played</b> <b>some</b> part in the negotiations which led to Trinidad's independence in 1962. After he decided not to stand for re-election in 1961, Williams appointed him as Trinidad and Tobago's first High Commissioner in London.|$|E

He became fluent in the Hindustani language and although friendly, never formed close relationships with other officers. He gave lectures and <b>played</b> <b>some</b> cricket while in India. He left the army in 1945 only to find his job with the coal mining company was no longer available.|$|E
