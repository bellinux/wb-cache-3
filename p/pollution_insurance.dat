The absence of a national law weakens the legal basis of <b>pollution</b> <b>insurance,</b> and poor technical support stagnates further implementation. Moreover, current <b>pollution</b> <b>insurance</b> products have limited risk coverage, high premium rates, and low loss ratios, which make them fairly unattractive to polluters.

40|$|The {{following}} is a synopsis of the major achievements attributed to {{the operation of the}} Weatherization Assistance Program Technical Assistance Center (WAPTAC) by the National Association for State Community Services Programs (NASCSP). During the past five years, the WAPTAC has developed into the premier source for information related to operating the Weatherization Assistance Program (WAP) {{at the state and local}} levels. The services provide through WAPTAC include both virtual technical support as well as hands-on training and instruction in classroom and in the field. The WAPTAC achieved several important milestones during its operation including the establishment of a national Weatherization Day now celebrated in most states, the implementation of a comprehensive Public Information Campaign (PIC) to raise the awareness of the Program among policy makers and the public, the training of more than 150 new state managers and staff as they assume their duties in state offices around the country, and the creation and support of a major virtual information source on the Internet being accessed by thousands of staff each month. The Weatherization Assistance Program Technical Assistance Center serves the Department of Energy's (DOE) Office of Weatherization and Intergovernmental Program as a valuable training and technical assistance resource for the network of 54 direct state grantees (50 states, District of Columbia and three Native American tribes) and the network of 900 local subgrantees (comprised of community action agencies, units of local government, and other non-profit organizations). The services provided through WAPTAC focus on standardizing and improving the daily management of the WAP. Staff continually identify policies changes and best practices to help the network improve its effectiveness and enhance the benefits of the Program for the customers who receive service and the federal and private investors. The operations of WAPTAC are separated into six distinct areas: (1) Orientation for New WAP State Directors and Staff; (2) <b>Pollution</b> Occurrence <b>Insurance</b> Project; (3) Public Information Campaign; (4) State Management Training Project; (5) System for Integrating and Reviewing Technologies and Techniques; and (6) WAPTAC Services...|$|R
30|$|When the {{revision}} process started, the NPC Committee of Environment and Resources had consulted relevant departments and experts several times. The Committee also visited Hunan, Hubei, Chongqing, Fujian, Jiangsu, Shaanxi provinces {{and other places}} to do research from April to September. A seminar was held in Xu Zhou city of Jiangsu province to discuss {{the revision}}, joined by committees of environment and resources from different provinces and cities, some NPC delegates who proposed the revision, and the Law Committee in NPC Standing Committee. Meanwhile, expert consultation meetings and departmental meetings were organized to analyze the issues of environmental protection planning, supervision, pollution charge and treatment with a time limit. During the process of drafting the amendment, the NPC Committee of Environment and Resources formally consulted 18 central institutions, such as the Law Committee in NPC Standing Committee and the Supreme People's Court, and gathered opinions from the 34 provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities. Further, the Committee listened to comments from representatives who had submitted four proposals during the Fifth Session of the NPC and other local people in Shanghai in March 2012.’ 14 It {{can be seen that}} the internal process of the revision involved central and local governments, the NPC system, the judiciary system and other relevant institutions. The procedures included department consultation, expert advice, NPC research, field research and public consultation. Including these diverse participants implied diverse positions and disagreements. To be more specific, ‘during this revision, some departments proposed to add more requests on the administrative system. Some put forward the sewage permit system, environmental <b>pollution</b> liability <b>insurance,</b> and environmental function zone. The current Environmental Protection Law did not adopt these proposals. Further, there are disagreements on these points among relevant departments in the State Council.’ 15 Significantly, the difficulties in coping with the diverse opinions during the policy making process made it possible to introduce new players in the field. There were two public consultation sessions during this revision 16, which occurred after the first and second reviews of the NPC Standing Committee. The debates at each stage of the revision were transparent and open to the public. Public feedback also influenced the legislation. This helped promote democracy in the legislation and also enhanced the legitimacy and justice of the legislation (Song and Zhou, 2007).|$|R

40|$|Paper revised from {{original}} submittal. Greenberg 2 By converting fixed {{insurance costs}} to per-mile charges, pay-as-you-drive-and-you-save (PAYDAYS) insurance would encourage voluntary reductions in driving with concomitant decreases in congestion, air <b>pollution,</b> crashes, and <b>insurance</b> claims. Despite these benefits, {{a range of}} technical, regulatory, and marketing challenges, and the related costs to address them, have, as of this writing, precluded {{anything more than a}} small amount of industry experimentation with the concept in the U. S. In other circumstances where the products offered in the marketplace {{have been found to be}} important to meeting public policy objectives, government intervention in markets has sometimes occurred. Recently, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) issued a final fuel economy rule for light trucks that is intended, as its principle objective, to maximize net benefits (1). This paper explores how an analogous benefitmaximizing rule could be structured to encourage adoption of PAYDAYS insurance. The key to designing such a benefit-maximizing rule is to determine: a) the net benefits of every mile not driven (about 16 ¢); b) the reduction in mileage that would result from PAYDAYS insurance (about 10 %); and, c) to then calculate the net benefits of every PAYDAYS-insured mile (about 1. 6 ¢). In one possible design of a rule, insurance companies might be offered incentive payments equal to this benefit. A mechanism by which the industry itself funds the incentive payments is described, as are alternatives. Companies would likely only offer such insurance—and the industry itself would only incur related expenses—if the 1. 6 ¢-per-mile payment exceeded their costs of offering it...|$|R
40|$|Responding to {{the flurry}} of {{environmental}} coverage litigation over {{the application of the}} “sudden and accidental” <b>pollution</b> exclusion, the <b>insurance</b> industry during the mid- 1980 s largely adopted new standard pollution exclusion language for commercial general liability (CGL) policies. Since the mid- 1980 s, the standard form CGL has included the so-called absolute pollution exclusion, which provides that the insurance does not apply to bodily injury or property damage “arising out of the actual, alleged or threatened discharge, dispersal, seepage, migration, release, or escape of pollutants. ” A “pollutant” is defined as “any solid, liquid, gaseous or thermal irritant or contaminant, including smoke, vapor, soot, fumes, acids, alkalis, chemicals, and waste. Waste includes materials to be recycled, reconditioned or reclaimed. ” The broad language used in the current pollution exclusion has, like its predecessor, spurred heated litigation as to the meaning and application of the exclusion. To date, courts found the exclusion applicable to preclude coverage for what might be termed “classic” pollution claims involving widespread discharge of contaminants giving rise to claims of environmental degradation. Courts have divided roughly equally, however, regarding the applicability of the exclusion to so-called toxic torts or other claims in which chemicals or irritants are involved. The issue continues to be hotly litigated and debated. In late 1997, the Illinois and Massachusetts Supreme Courts refused to bar coverage for claims arising out of carbon monoxide poisoning while in early 1998 the Florida Supreme Court read the exclusion broadly and literally to bar coverage for claims arising out of an ammonia spill in the office and a crop-spraying mishap that caused immediate harm to two bystanders...|$|R
