40|$|Accurately perceiving the {{locations}} of objects is essential for successfully interacting with our environment. However, the visual system must constantly contend with motion, both from objects moving through space and on the retina as the observer moves through the environment. Previous work has shown that motion can bias the perceived locations of both moving and non-moving targets, demonstrating that the visual system uses information from motion to update the represented locations of objects. Here, we examined the extent and circumstances under which motion-induced <b>position</b> <b>shifts</b> can influence perception, and whether they can influence action. First, we used psychophysics to demonstrate that motion can influence the location at which low-level adaptation is observed, supporting the idea that motion can bias retinotopic coding of stationary objects at early stages of visual processing. Moreover, we demonstrate that motor responses are not immune to these early influences of motion on position representation. Specifically, we show that <b>position</b> <b>shifts</b> resulting from motion can bias saccade targeting. However, this influence of motion-induced <b>position</b> <b>shifts</b> on saccade targeting does not simply result from perceptual <b>shifts</b> in <b>position.</b> Instead, we demonstrate that the saccade system updates information from motion-induced <b>position</b> <b>shifts</b> before observers are able to consciously perceive these changes. Together, these experiments {{support the idea that}} motion exerts an early influence on represented positions and that the saccade system has access to this information before it is perceptually registered...|$|R

The present study examined the role of the visual awareness of motion in the motion-induced <b>position</b> <b>shift</b> by using exclusive dominance and suppression of binocular rivalry. Observers dichoptically viewed a flickering radial checkerboard and two sinusoidal gratings that drifted vertically in opposite directions. When observers viewed exclusively either the checkerboard or motion stimulus, two horizontal lines were flashed, one for each side of the rivalry stimulus. During the exclusive dominance of the grating motion, the lines appeared to shift in the directions of the nearby motions. The <b>position</b> <b>shift</b> was identical to that during non-rivalry, monocular viewing of the motion stimulus. However, when the grating motions were completely suppressed, no <b>position</b> <b>shift</b> was observed.

40|$|AbstractMotion can {{influence}} the perceived position of nearby stationary objects (Nature Neuroscience 3 (2000) 954). To investigate the influence of high-level motion processes on the <b>position</b> <b>shift</b> while controlling for low-level motion signals, we measured the <b>position</b> <b>shift</b> {{as a function of}} the motion seen in a bistable quartet. In this stimulus, motion can be seen along either one or the other of two possible paths. An illusory <b>position</b> <b>shift</b> was observed only when the flashes were adjacent to the path where motion was perceived. If the flash was adjacent to the other path, where no motion was perceived, there was no illusory displacement. Thus for the same physical stimulus, a change in the perceived motion path determined the location where illusory position shifts would be seen. This result indicates that high-level motion processes alone are sufficient to produce the <b>position</b> <b>shift</b> of stationary objects. The effect of the timing of the test flash between the onset and offset of the motion was also examined. The position shifts were greatest at the onset of motion, then decreasing gradually, disappearing at the offset of motion. We propose an attentional repulsion explanation for the shift effect...|$|E
40|$|AbstractMotion {{perception}} influences perceived position. It {{has been}} shown that first-order (luminance defined) motion shifts perceived position across a wide range of spatial and temporal frequencies. On the other hand, second-order (contrast defined) motion shifts perceived position over a narrow range of temporal frequencies, regardless of spatial frequency [Bressler, D. W., & Whitney, D. (2006). Second-order motion shifts perceived position. Vision Research, 46 (6 – 7), 1120 – 1128]. These results suggest the presence of distinct position assignment mechanisms for first- and second-order motion. We investigated whether the first- and second-order systems independently encode and assign the position of a moving stimulus. To measure motion induced <b>position</b> <b>shift</b> we presented two horizontally offset Gabors placed above and below a central fixation point, with sine wave carriers drifting in opposite directions. Subjects judged the position of the top Gabor relative to the bottom one. We used both first-order Gabors (sinusoidal luminance modulation of a dynamic noise carrier enveloped by a static Gaussian) and second-order Gabors (sinusoidal contrast modulation of a dynamic noise carrier enveloped by a static Gaussian). Results showed a strong <b>position</b> <b>shift</b> {{in the direction of the}} carrier motion when both Gabors were first-order, a weak <b>position</b> <b>shift</b> when both Gabors were second-order, and no appreciable <b>position</b> <b>shift</b> when one Gabor was first-order and the other was second-order (cross-order motion). The absence of a <b>position</b> <b>shift</b> using cross-order motion supports the hypothesis that the two motion systems independently encode and assign the position of a moving object. These results are consistent with those of experiments investigating global spatial interactions between static first-order and second-order Gabor patches, indicating a commonality in the underlying spatial integration processes...|$|E
