50|$|Growth in Latin America - not {{including}} the Caribbean region - is expected to average between 3.5 and 4.5 percent of GDP in 2011 (better than economic activity in some developed nations). Progress is attributed to current macroeconomic management, a constant domestic demand, commodity export boom, and the commodity increase in prices which have spurred investments in mining and energy. Unemployment rates have dropped down to seven percent and current results are better than in most North American areas and some wealthier European nations. In the fiscal year 2011, World Bank Group has produced $14.7 billion in funding for the region. Contributions {{have been made by}} International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), the International Development Association (IDA), the International Finance Corporation (IFC) and the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA). Most of the funding was devoted to health, social, transportation, and <b>public</b> <b>administration</b> <b>services.</b> Countries that received the most financial help were Mexico ($2.7 billion), Brazil ($2.5 billion), and Argentina ($2.2 billion). Funding stimulates development which in turn promotes investment as the current case in Latin America.

After that, work follows with global situation in European Union and concentrates on one country (Austria) and its services. During design of the catalogue was used actual knowledge and research about service providing, which reflects customer oriented approach and access through single point of contact. The necessity of splitting the whole process of service providing into two parts, service access and service execution part, is emphasized. Within design of catalogue are presented two main models – domain model describing the structure of catalogue itself and service model, describing services. Based on analysis of possible uses and its integration potential with existing systems are defined its main benefits and is devised integrating principles designed in catalogue into „Portal veřejné správy“...|$|E

There are several approaches for formalizing product model information in the old economy (for example CAD/CAM-based product models in discrete parts manufacturing). The service sector evolved to the most important sector in all developed economies. Knowledge {{plays a crucial role}} for delivering many services. For complex, IT-based service products high in variants (such as insurances, IT outsourcing or <b>public</b> <b>administration</b> <b>services)</b> existing approaches are not suitable but formalization is desired (e. g. it allows easier rendering, export or trade of such products). This paper elicits a possible strategy for defining formal product models for knowledge-based services using knowledge representation and semantic web technologies...|$|E

40|$|Main {{purpose of}} this PhD {{dissertation}} is to improve overview about data, procedures, services and life-events in Slovenian public administration. This will be achieved by unified description of data, procedures, services and life-events. Furthermore, such description will enable e-service semantic interoperability and active Slovenian governmental portal. Final goal of this PhD dissertation is development of executable knowledge presentation model of Slovenian public administration knowledge. Second part of {{the goal is to}} examine the model on some cases of life-event modeling. So, I will develop formal knowledge presentation model, which will be conceptualization of the knowledge from the field of life events and Slovenian <b>public</b> <b>administration</b> <b>services.</b> It will be constructed as ontology and implemented as executable computer software. Then I will examine the knowledge presentation model usability by construction of some life-event models. I will compare life-event modeling by comparative analysis, where two different techniques for modeling will be used. One of techniques will be classic one, where information analytics have to analyze services from the beginning and the second one will be proposed one, which will include also previously developed knowledge presentation model. Main dissertation thesis says that knowledge presentation model simplifies lifeevent modeling. It will be examined through previously mentioned activities. There are also some working theses, which support the main one: • <b>Public</b> <b>administration</b> <b>services</b> and life events can be satisfactory described by a final set of concepts and relations. • Conceptual model can be constructed as ontology and implemented as executable computer software. • Implemented ontology simplifies life-events modeling. Main dissertation contributions to the science are analysis and description of possible accessions to knowledge presentation in the public administration field, description of chosen or developed accession and finally, examination of developed accession executability and usability.

40|$|The {{best way}} to {{contribute}} electronic and mobile Government is by creating a public administration network in virtual communities. This is essentially the definition of Virtual Public Administration (VPA). A virtual community (a good example {{of which would be}} the well acclaimed virtual reality world Second Life), could potentially provide the platform to offer improved <b>public</b> <b>administration</b> <b>services.</b> Arguably, the quality of these services to citizens and businesses in virtual communities are more competitive than in reality. Therefore, the social, economic and technological impact is more inquiring because we could potentially offer to the end users more motivation to join these communities. Furthermore the success of the VPA is based on the virtual project management application. Our paper examines, theoretically and empirically, how VPA could potentially contribute to better <b>public</b> <b>administration</b> <b>services</b> and how effective project management application could facilitate the proposed transition. The research strategy is based on a combination of qualitative and quantitative methodological approaches. In that respect pertinent data is been collected through both semi structured interviews and questionnaires, with executives and others, in the Greek and UK public administration sector. Preliminary theoretical results demonstrate the improvement achieved by integrating time in virtual and real worlds and by testing impact to the quality of service provided by public sector to citizens/businesses. To that end, our study provides both qualitative (statements of directors, observations) and quantitative (metrics) examples related to these improvements. Three UK based councils have agreed in principle to participate to the study. Furthermore, in Greece the General Inspector of Public Administration, the National University of Athens and others has also agreed to participate.
