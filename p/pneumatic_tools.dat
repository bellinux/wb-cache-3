25|$|In year 1900 Hietalahti Shipyard and Engineering Works {{invested}} on <b>pneumatic</b> <b>tools.</b> A separate {{air compressor}} building was constructed {{next to the}} steam boiler building, and the premises were equipped with a comprehensive pressurised air supply network.

40|$|A {{simulated}} drywall plastering {{task was}} used in this study to evaluate the potential health and safety benefits of using a pneumatic drywall finishing system. The plastering task was performed in a controlled job setting. Muscular exertion while performing the plastering task was measured using electromyography (EMG). Usability questionnaires were given to all participants. Mixed findings were observed for the EMG dependent variables. Significant reduction in the number and duration of muscular rest and static load level were observed for the left forearm flexor muscles when working with the <b>pneumatic</b> <b>tool.</b> However, significant increase in the median and peak load level were observed in the right forearm flexor muscle when working with the Apla-Tech <b>pneumatic</b> <b>tool.</b> The usability questionnaire indicated {{that a majority of the}} workers preferred the <b>pneumatic</b> <b>tool.</b> The use of ladders and rolling scaffolds was reduced when working with the <b>pneumatic</b> <b>tool</b> because the tool allowed all workers to reach higher corners and ceiling height. Based on the EMG measures, tool preference and reduction of risk of traumatic slips and falls indicate that the <b>pneumatic</b> <b>tool</b> is an effective tool for applying compound onto drywall joints. Further studies in the field setting to verify the effectiveness of the <b>pneumatic</b> <b>tool</b> should be conducted...|$|R
5000|$|Chicago Pneumatic is a {{brand name}} in the <b>pneumatic</b> <b>tool</b> {{industry}} with a history traced back to 1889. John W. Duntley had in mind the idea of sourcing and selling construction tools [...] "that weren’t yet available". In 1894, he established the Chicago <b>Pneumatic</b> <b>Tool</b> Company, with an office in Chicago. The first plant to begin manufacturing product specifically for CP was the Boyer Machine Shop in St. Louis, Missouri. In 1901, Duntley met steel magnate Charles M. Schwab, who invested heavily in the company. On December 28, the company was incorporated and the first single-valve pneumatic hammer was patented.|$|R
25|$|In the U.S., {{a filling}} station that also offers {{services}} such as oil changes and mechanical repairs to automobiles is called a service station. Until the 1970s {{the vast majority of}} gas stations were service stations; now only a minority are. These stations typically offered free air for inflating tires, as compressed air was already on hand to operate the repair garage's <b>pneumatic</b> <b>tools.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{industry}} and manufacturing to supply compressed air {{for all types}} of <b>pneumatic</b> <b>tools.</b> Centrifugal compressors for such uses are often multistage and driven by electric motors. Inter-cooling is often needed between stages to control air temperature. Note that the road repair crew and the local automobile repair garage find screw compressors better adapt to their needs. Standards set by the industry for these compressors include ASME and government regulations that emphasize safety. Ideal gas relationships are often used to properly design, test and analyze the performance of these machines. Carrier’s equation is often used to deal with humidity.|$|E
500|$|Trauma {{to parts}} of the {{respiratory}} system other than the lungs, such as rupture of a bronchial tube, may also cause subcutaneous emphysema. Air may travel upward to the neck from a pneumomediastinum that results from a bronchial rupture, or downward from a torn trachea or larynx into the soft tissues of the chest. It may also occur with fractures of the facial bones, neoplasms, during asthma attacks, when the Heimlich maneuver is used, and during [...] childbirth. [...] It is estimated to occur with pneumomediastinum in one in every 2000–100,000 deliveries. Injury with <b>pneumatic</b> <b>tools,</b> those that are driven by air, is also known to cause subcutaneous emphysema, even in extremities (the arms and legs). [...] It can also occur {{as a result of}} rupture of the esophagus; when it does, it is usually as a late sign.|$|E
50|$|In August 1999, Pentair {{bought the}} DeVilbiss Air Power Company for $460 million in cash.

2500|$|Thorp also {{invented the}} rotary gas meter in 1902, and, what his {{obituary}} describes as [...] "a tiny device... for economical regulation of gas delivery [...] {{has been very}} widely employed by manufacturers and public authorities."

2500|$|The most {{important}} {{proponent of the}} northern route and the Hoosac Tunnel was Alvah Crocker, a self-made paper mill owner from Fitchburg, Massachusetts. The Science Channel documentary Driven to Invent: Killer Tunnel called Crocker [...] "The Father of Modern Tunneling" [...] for his influence in advancing the use of geologists, explosives, <b>pneumatic</b> <b>tools</b> and boring technology, and said, [...] "He laid down the rules for tunnel construction even to the present day." [...] In 1841, Crocker formed the Fitchburg Railroad (chartered 1842, opened 1845) between Boston and Fitchburg. In 1844 Crocker incorporated the existing Vermont and Massachusetts Railroad, which ran from Fitchburg west to Greenfield, as well as northward (from Millers Falls) to Brattleboro, Vermont. In 1848 Crocker secured from the legislature a charter for the Troy & Greenfield Railroad (T & G), with provisions for a tunnel through Hoosac Mountain.|$|E
2500|$|Large {{marine diesel}} engines are started using {{compressed}} air, typically between 20 and 30 bar {{and stored in}} two or more large bottles, acting directly on the pistons via special starting valves to turn the crankshaft prior to beginning fuel injection. [...] This arrangement is more compact and cheaper than an electric starter motor would be at such scales, and able to supply the necessary burst of extremely high power without placing a prohibitive load on the ship's electrical generators and distribution system. [...] Compressed air is commonly also used, at lower pressures, to control the engine and act as the spring force acting on the cylinder exhaust valves, and to operate other auxiliary systems and power tools on board, sometimes including pneumatic PID controllers. [...] One advantage {{of this approach is}} that {{in the event of an}} electrical blackout, ship systems powered by stored compressed air can continue functioning uninterrupted, and generators can be restarted without an electrical supply. [...] Another is that <b>pneumatic</b> <b>tools</b> can be used in commonly wet environments without risk of electric shock.|$|E

50|$|An {{air pump}} is a device for pushing air. Examples include a bicycle pump, pumps {{that are used}} to aerate an {{aquarium}} or a pond via an airstone; a gas compressor used to power a <b>pneumatic</b> <b>tool,</b> air horn or pipe organ; a bellows used to encourage a fire; a vacuum cleaner and a vacuum pump.|$|R

5000|$|A {{pneumatic}} tool, air tool, air-powered tool or pneumatic-powered tool {{is a type}} {{of power}} tool, driven by compressed air, supplied by an air compressor. <b>Pneumatic</b> <b>tools</b> can also be driven by compressed carbon dioxide (...) stored in small cylinders allowing for portability. <b>Pneumatic</b> <b>tools</b> are safer to run and maintain than their electric power tool equivalents, and have a higher power-to-weight ratio, allowing a smaller, lighter tool to accomplish the same task. General grade <b>pneumatic</b> <b>tools</b> with short life span are commonly cheaper and are also called disposable tools in tooling industries while industrial grade <b>pneumatic</b> <b>tools</b> with long life span are more expensive. In general, <b>pneumatic</b> <b>tools</b> are cheaper than the equivalent electric-powered tools.|$|E

50|$|A <b>pneumatic</b> <b>tool</b> {{is first}} {{thought to have}} been used for rock {{drilling}} in 1844. Many quarries used hand held tools that required the driller to suspend himself from a rope over the quarry face in order to place the drill hole in the required position. This system used small diameter holes and was not only terribly inefficient, but very dangerous due to flying rock {{as a result of the}} inaccuracy of the drilled borehole.|$|R
