40|$|Ketoprofen and {{piketoprofen}} are non-steroi-dal antiinflamatory drugs (NSAIDs) {{from the}} group of the aryl-propionic acid derivatives. They are widely used in topical presentations {{in the management of}} musculoskeletal rheuma-tisms and traumatisms. The advantage of this form of administration is, besides its commo-dity, the infrequent development of systemic adverse effects. There have been reports of cases of contact dermatitis and photodermatitis, the latter particularly in countries of the Medite-rranean area or in countries with a greater sun-light exposure 1 - 10. We present the case of a young girl who atten-ded our Paediatric Allergy outpatient clinic des-cribing the development of three marked local reactions after the use of dermatologic gels con-taining these NSAIDs in their formulations. CLINICAL OBSERVATION The patient was a 14 -year-old girl, whose only relevant personal antecedent was the presence of atopic dermatitis some years earlier. She came to our Paediatric Allergy outpatient clinic because she had first developed, after the application of Fas-tum Â¨ gel (ethyl alcohol, carbomer, diethanolami-ne, essence of lavender, methyl p-hydroxybenzoa-te, <b>propyl</b> <b>p-hydroxybenzoate</b> and ketoprofen) on her knee because of a traumatism, and after expo-sure to sunlight, erythema, oedema, local hypert-hermia and small macular lesions with pruritus and burning in the area of application. She was initially treated with antihistamines and a topical corticoste-roid, with moderate improvement. Treatment was thereupon instituted with oral 6 -methyl-prednisolo-ne, and the lesions remitted in 20 days. Som...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{discrete}} esters and ester mixtures on the intestinal stability and absorption of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (tenofovir DF, an esterase-sensitive prodrug of the antiviral tenofovir) was {{compared with the}} effect of strawberry extract, which {{has been shown to}} enhance the absorption of the prodrug across Caco- 2 monolayers and in rat ileum. In addition, the mechanism of absorption enhancement was investigated. In rat intestinal homogenates, complete inhibition of the conversion of tenofovir DF (as obtained by strawberry extract) could only be obtained at relatively high concentrations of the discrete esters or by using mixtures of esters (e. g., <b>propyl</b> <b>p-hydroxybenzoate</b> 0. 02 %, octyl acetate 0. 02 %, ethyl caprylate 0. 01 %). Coincubation of tenofovir DF with this mixture also resulted in an enhancement of its absorption in the in vitro Caco- 2 system as well as in rat ileum. As tenofovir DF is a substrate for P-glycoprotein (P-gp) -related efflux carriers in the Caco- 2 model, the modulatory effect of the ester mixtures was studied on the functionality of P-gp using cyclosporin A (CsA) as a model substrate. Strawberry extract as well as the mixture of three esters interfered with the absorptive transport of CsA across Caco- 2 monolayers, illustrating that both mixtures interfere with both esterase-activity and P-gp functionality. This concerted barrier was not observed in rat ileum, suggesting differential functional activities of the biochemical barrier toward tenofovir DF in different absorption systems. Overall, our results illustrate that modulation of the biochemical barrier (metabolism and efflux) of tenofovir DF by ester mixtures can be used to increase the intestinal absorption of tenofovir DF in an in vitro and an in situ absorption model; the mechanism of action appears to be a complex interplay of different systems; the differential expression of carriers and enzymes in different systems illustrates the difficulty of extrapolating observations between different systems/species. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Antimicrobial {{screening}} of several lichen species and subsequent isolation and structure elucidation of active compounds {{revealed that the}} hydrolysis products of certain lichen metabolites, i. e., depsides, were active against gram-negative bacteria and fungi as well as gram-positive bacteria. The active constituents isolated from Stereocaulon alpinum and Peltigera aphthosa were identified, respectively, as methyl beta-orsellinate and a mixture of methyl and ethyl orsellinates. MIC determinations indicated that activity of these compounds was superior {{to that of the}} commonly used preservative agents methyl and <b>propyl</b> <b>p-hydroxybenzoates</b> and was of the same order as that of chlorocresol...|$|R
40|$|Cells of {{a strain}} of Pseudomonas cepacia were {{isolated}} from an oil-in-water emulsion containing methyl and <b>propyl</b> <b>p-hydroxybenzoates</b> (methylparaben and propylparaben) as preservative additives. This strain demonstrated the ability to destroy these additives, to utilize the propyl ester as sole carbon source, and to hydrolyze the methyl ester. When the isolate was grown on Eugon agar, exposure to the methyl ester killed 99. 9 % of the inoculum, but the surviving cells grew logarithmically. On the other hand, cells grown on media containing propylparaben were less susceptible when subsequently exposed to emulsions containing methylparaben. These observations demonstrate one mechanism by which microorganisms develop resistance to antimicrobial preservatives...|$|R
40|$|A liquid {{chromatography}} method {{has been developed}} for quantitative analysis of a mixture of methyl and <b>propyl</b> <b>p-hydroxybenzoates</b> in water and fat soluble ointment formulations. The method employs a PLRP-S 8 mu m 100 Angstrom, 250 x 4. 6 mm i. d. column maintained at 60 degrees C and a mobile phase acetonitrile-potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7. 0; 0. 2 M) -water (35 : 5 : 60, v/v/v), at a flow rate of 1. 0 ml min(- 1). The analytes were detected by UV at 254 nm. Water soluble formulations were dissolved in acetonitrile-water (40 : 60, v/v). Fat soluble formulations were dissolved in hexane and extracted with acetonitrile-water (60 : 40, v/v). The method showed good selectivity, repeatability, reproducibility, linearity and recovery. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|When a {{commercial}} substrate {{was used in}} the determination of serum amylase activities of patients with acute pancreatitis, results much higher than those re-ported by the manufacturer with similar patients were found. A failure to quantitate all of the reducing groups liberated during incubation may account for the lower results. A modified saccharogenic method has been developed, which, by increasing the ratios of starch to enzyme and copper to reducing sugars, considerably extends the range of the determination. Unequivocally elevated serum and urine amylase values can be measured without repetition of {{all or part of the}} test and with good precision. lECENT STUDIES of saccharogenic amylase methods (1, 2) stress the importance of using sufficient substrate to maintain maximum reac-tion velocity during incubation. This paper presents evidence that commonly used spectrophotometric copper reduction methods for the determination of reducing groups in postincubation mixtures have been misapplied, leading to factitiously low amylase values. A modi-fied saccharogenic method, which permits analysis of most pathologic human sera or urines without repetition of either incubation or copper reduction steps and without sacrifice of precision in the normal range, is described.
