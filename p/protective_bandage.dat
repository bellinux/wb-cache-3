40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{describe}} an alternative method {{for the treatment}} of non-responsive self-mutilation injuries in three dogs after carpal/tarsal arthrodesis. STUDY DESIGN: Case series ANIMALS: Two dogs with carpal injury and one dog with tarsal injury treated by arthrodesis METHODS: All dogs developed self-mutilation injuries due to licking and/or chewing of the toes within 21 - 52 days of surgery. Clinical signs did not resolve within one week after conservative treatment with wound debridement and <b>protective</b> <b>bandages.</b> Following general anaesthesia, a deep horseshoe-shaped skin incision, including the subdermal tissue, was performed proximal to the self-mutilation injury transecting the sensory cutaneous afferent nerves. The skin incision was closed with simple interrupted sutures. RESULTS: All wounds healed without complication. Self-mutilation resolved completely within 24 hours after surgery in all dogs. No recurrence was observed (5 months to 3 years). CONCLUSION: Non-selective cutaneous sensory neurectomy may lead to resolution of self-mutilation following arthrodesis in dogs. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Failure of conservative treatment in self-mutilation injuries often leads to toe or limb amputation as a last resort. The technique described in this case series is a simple procedure that should be considered prior to amputation. The outcome of this procedure in dogs self-multilating due to neurological or behavioral disturbances unrelated to carpal or tarsal arthrodesis is not known...|$|R

A criação de técnicas de baixo custo, de fácil aplicabilidade e disponibilidade em saúde tem permeado os conceitos de inovação e tecnologia. Nesse sentido, estratégias de criação e avanço tecnológico têm sido estimuladas como foco de pesquisa em enfermagem. Este estudo metodológico e quantitativo realizado na unidade de terapia intensiva de um {{hospital}} universitário em Florianópolis, Santa Catarina, teve por objetivos avaliar os resultados da aplicação da Â bandagem protetora acolchoadaÂ na prevenção da úlcera por pressão em calcâneos; e associar o escore da escala de Braden e a utilização de norepinefrina no desenvolvimento das úlceras por pressão. A amostra foi constituída por 107 pacientes adultos, de ambos os sexos, com escore ABSTRACT: The {{creation of}} methods of low cost, easy availability and applicability in health has permeated the innovation and technology concepts. Accordingly, strategies {{of creation and}} technological advance have been stimulated with a research focus on nursing. This methodological and quantitative study, performed {{in the intensive care}} unit of a university hospital in Florianopolis, Santa Catarina, had the objective of assessing the results of the application of the Â protective quilted bandageÂ in the prevention of pressure ulcers in calcanei, besides associating the score of the Braden scale and the use of norepinephrine in the development of pressure ulcers. The sample was composed of 107 adult patients, of both sexes, with a score < 15 in the Braden scale, admitted to the intensive care unit for up to 36 hours, without pressure ulcer or injury in any calcaneus. Among the patients who participated in the study, 93 did not develop pressure ulcer. Variables with statistical significance for the development of pressure ulcer were considered, namely: score of the Braden Scale (p< 0, 001), score of the Glasgow coma scale (p= 0, 007), score of the Ramsay scale (p< 0, 001) and use of norepinephrine (p< 0, 001). The use of <b>protective</b> quilted <b>bandage,</b> so-called in this study, was effective within the confidence interval between 80 and 93 % for a confidence level of 95 %, always being used on a supportive surface (pyramidal mattress with a density of 33 or a differentiated density mattress). The following associations in relation to the occurrence of pressure ulcer were also independently assessed: score of the Braden Scale, maximum daily dosage of administered norepinephrine and total time of norepinephrine infusion. The score of the Braden scale (p < 0, 001) showed a mean of 9, 7 points, with a median of 10 points in patients who developed injuries. The use of norepinephrine showed a statistical significance (p= 0, 005) in the development of pressure ulcer, as well as time of use of norepinephrine in hours (p= 0, 012) and the maximum daily concentration of infused norepinephrine (p= 0, 004) in microgram/kg /minute/day (mcg / kg /min/day) and in microgram/ hours (mg/hr) (p < 0, 001). The time in hours of infusion of norepinephrine showed a mean of 41, 1 hours of infusion, median of 30, 5 hours, with a range from zero to 240 hours for the group without injuries. In the group with injuries, the mean was of 71, 8 hours of infusion, median of 72 hours, with a range from zero to 240 hours. Nonetheless, it is necessary to perform other studies that might present new data in relation to the concentration and usage time of norepinephrine in the occurrence of pressure ulcers in adult patients in intensive care units...|$|R
