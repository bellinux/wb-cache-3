40|$|<b>Brazed</b> <b>plate</b> heat {{exchangers}} are carving {{a big chunk}} out of the heat transfer industry with their compact size and high efficiency design. <b>Brazed</b> <b>plate</b> units are up to six times smaller than alternative methods of heat exchange with the same capacity. This is because of their unique construction: more then hundred corrugated stainless steel <b>plates</b> are <b>brazed</b> together with every second plate turned 180 degrees. This design creates two highly turbulent fluid channels that flow in opposite directions over a massive surface area. The result of this construction is a significantly higher heat transfer coefficient with less required surface area and outstanding performance characteristics...|$|R

Varying the mass flux, the condensation temperature, and the vapor quality of the refrigerant, we measured the condensation heat transfer coefficient and the pressure drops. Both the heat transfer coefficient and the pressure drop increased proportionally with the mass flux and the vapor quality and inversely with the condensation temperature and the chevron angle. Correlations of the Nusselt number and the friction factor with the geometric parameters are suggested for the tested BPHEs...|$|R
40|$|An {{electroplating}} fabrication {{method has}} been used since 1962 for S-band frequency electron accelerating structures in Japan. The electrical contact between disk and cylinder, and the vacuum integrity are maintained by an electroplated copper layer 5 mm thick, without any <b>metal</b> <b>brazing.</b> The typical integrated phase error after plating was kept below ± 2 ° without any frequency tuning. The mechanical straightness was within ± 100 µm over the 2 m length of the S-band accelerating structure. Since this method does not require any high-temperature processes, such as the <b>metal</b> <b>brazing</b> commonly used for accelerator fabrication, the copper material does not crystallize and maintains a higher tensile strength. That makes this method very attractive for fabrication of the high-performance structures which will be required in various future projects, and especially for e+e- linear colliders. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{experimental}} {{performance of}} a 100 kW heat pump using propane is presented. The charge minimization is a priority {{in the design of}} such a device and thus shell-and-tube heat exchangers using minichannels and providing low charge have been installed in the unit, along with conventional <b>brazed</b> <b>plate</b> heat exchangers, in order to compare different working configurations, both in terms of energy efficiency and refrigerant charge. The performance when using the minichannel condenser is here compared to the one obtained when using a <b>brazed</b> <b>plate</b> condenser and the influence of a minichannel internal heat exchanger on the performance of the equipment is measured and discussed. It is shown that a 100 kW heat pump without a liquid receiver could be run with around 3 kg of propane using a plate condenser and a plate evaporator.

40|$|Abstract. Practical {{applications}} of metal/ceramic joints {{can be found}} in the biomedical field regarding the encapsulation of implantable telemetric devices, the fabrication of crowns and bridges for dental restoration, or in the production of drug delivery systems, biomedical sensors and electrodes. Most of metal/ceramic joints are produced by the active <b>metal</b> <b>brazing</b> technique, which originates a multi-layered interface which should be able of accommodating the abrupt electronic, crystallographic, chemical, mechanical and thermo-mechanical discontinuity that characterize these systems. Additionally, when considering biomedical applications, corrosion resistance becomes of prime importance. In this work, the corrosion resistance of Ti/glass-ceramic interfaces obtained by active <b>metal</b> <b>brazing</b> was evaluated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) tests. The electrochemical behaviour of the interface was monitored, as a function of time, in a simulated physiological solution at room temperature.

40|$|Steady-state heat {{transfer}} data for single-phase (water) in both frame-and-plate (FPHE) and <b>brazed</b> <b>plate</b> heat exchangers (BPHE) {{are presented with}} various number of chevron plates in U-type flow arrangement. Analysis of the experimental results indicates that the end plates, instead of being adiabatic, function as fins due to the contact with adjacent plates. The experimental data is used to validate a thermal conduction model in ANSYS, which indicates that the end plates fin efficiency {{is a function of}} fluid convective {{heat transfer}} coefficient and conductive thermal resistance. In the frame-and-plate heat exchanger, the pressing force of the frame may affect the contact thermal resistance, thus change the fin efficiency. In <b>brazed</b> <b>plate</b> heat exchanger, the fin efficiency is much higher due to the larger contact area and higher conductivity of the brazing material. Although the effect of end plates is quickly diluted by the increased number of plates in real applications, it could be significant when plate number is small, {{as is often the case}} in laboratory settings for the development of heat transfer correlations...|$|R

40|$|It is {{well known}} that when a {{superheated}} gas reaches a cold surface, the condensation starts immediately only if the wall temperature is lower than the dew temperature of the refrigerant; in this case, the heat transfer phenomenon can be also affected by the superheating temperature. This paper presents the experimental measurements of the heat transfer coefficient carried out during partial condensation of superheated R 32 refrigerant in a commercial <b>brazed</b> <b>plate</b> heat exchanger prototype. The present work aims at highlighting the effects of the superheating during the partial condensation of R 32 by imposing 5, 10, 15, and 25 K of vapour superheating at the inlet of the <b>brazed</b> <b>plate</b> heat exchanger prototype. The experimental measurements were carried out by varying the specific mass velocity between 15 and 40 kg m- 2 s- 1 and the outlet vapour quality between 0. 0 and 0. 65.
