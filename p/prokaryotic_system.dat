40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} step in structure-based drug design studies is obtaining the protein in active form after cloning the target gene. In one of our previous study, it was determined that an internal Shine-Dalgarno-like sequence present just before the third methionine at N-terminus of wild type lactate dehydrogenase enzyme of Plasmodium falciparum prevent the translation of full length protein. Inspection of the same region in P. vivax LDH, which was overproduced as an active enzyme, indicated that the codon preference in the same region was slightly different than the codon preference of wild type PfLDH. In this study, 5 '-GGAGGC- 3 ' sequence of P. vivax that codes for two glycine residues just before the third methionine was exchanged to 5 '-GGAGGA- 3 ', by mimicking P. falciparum LDH, to prove the possible effects of having an internal SD-like sequence when expressing an eukaryotic protein in a <b>prokaryotic</b> <b>system.</b> Exchange was made by site-directed mutagenesis. Results indicated that having two glycine residues with an internal SD-like sequence (GGAGGA) just before the third methionine abolishes the enzyme activity due to the preference of the <b>prokaryotic</b> <b>system</b> used for the expression.

Choosing the right system depends, among other things, {{on the growth}} rate and culture of host cells, level of the target gene expression and posttranslational processing of the synthesized protein.

The most widely used system for protein overproduction, both on a laboratory and industrial scale, is the <b>prokaryotic</b> <b>system.</b> This system is based primarily on the bacteria E. coli, although increasingly often Bacillus species are used.

Ellipticine is oxidized by cytochromes P 450 to form up to five metabolites (7 -hydroxy-, 9 -hydroxy, 12 - hydroxy-, 13 -hydroxyellipticine and N 2 -oxide ellipticine). 9 -Hydroxy- and 7 - hydroxyellipticine {{are considered to be}} detoxification metabolites, whereas 12 -hydroxy-, 13 - hydroxyellipticine and N 2 -oxide of ellipticine are considered as activation metabolites, which are responsible for formation of covalent DNA adducts.

40|$|Abstract Background Duck viral {{enteritis}}, {{which is}} caused by duck enteritis virus (DEV), causes significant economic losses in domestic and wild waterfowls {{because of the high}} mortality and low egg production rates. With the purpose of eliminating this disease and decreasing economic loss in the commercial duck industry, researching on glycoprotein K (gK) of DEV may be a new kind of method for preventing and curing this disease. Because glycoproteins project from the virus envelope as spikes and are directly involved in the host immune system and elicitation of the host immune responses, and also {{play an important role in}} mediating infection of target cells, the entry into cell for free virus and the maturation or egress of virus. The gK is one of the major envelope glycoproteins of DEV. However, little information correlated with gK is known, such as antigenic and functional characterization. Results Bioinformatic predictions revealed that the expression of the full-length gK gene (fgK) in a <b>prokaryotic</b> <b>system</b> is difficult because of the presence of suboptimal exon and transmembrane domains at the C-terminal. In this study, we found that the fgK gene might not be expressed in a <b>prokaryotic</b> <b>system</b> in accordance with the bioinformatic predictions. Further, we successfully used bioinformatics tools to guide the prokaryotic expression of the gK gene by designing a novel truncated gK gene (tgK). These findings indicated that bioinformatics provides theoretical data for target gene expression and saves time for our research. The recombinant tgK protein (tgK) was expressed and purified by immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC). Western blotting and indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) showed that the tgK possessed antigenic characteristics similar to native DEV-gK.
