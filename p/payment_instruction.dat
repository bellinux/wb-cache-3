The payment itself is a booking in the accounts of the central bank where P's loro is debited with P (it will be B-P≥0 thereafter) and simultaneously Rs nostro is credit with P (its balance C will be C+P≥0 thereafter).|$|E

40|$|We {{develop a}} parsimonious {{model of the}} interbank payment system to study {{congestion}} {{and the role of}} liquidity markets in alleviating congestion. The model incorporates an endogenous instruction arrival process, scale-free topology of payments between banks, fixed total liquidity that limits banks 2 ̆ 019 capacity to process arriving instructions, and a global market that distributes liquidity. We find that at low liquidity, the system becomes congested and payment settlement loses correlation with <b>payment</b> <b>instruction</b> arrival, becoming coupled across the network. The onset of congestion is evidently related to the relative values of three characteristic times: the time for banks 2 ̆ 019 net position to return to zero, the time for banks to exhaust their liquidity endowments, and the liquidity market relaxation time. In the congested regime, settlement takes place in cascades having a characteristic size. A global liquidity market substantially diminishes congestion, requiring {{only a small fraction of}} the payment-induced liquidity flow to achieve strong beneficial effects...|$|E
40|$|Payment systems come in many forms, {{but their}} purpose {{is always the}} same - namely, to enable people to {{transfer}} funds from an account at one bank to an account at another bank. The alternative for the payer and the payee would be to settle their transaction either using cash or by barter. Banks themselves also use payment systems to transfer funds {{as a result of their}} own transactions (as distinct from their customers’). Whatever its particular form, a payment system can be seen as comprising three main elements or processes: A means of authorising and initiating the payment ie the means by which the payer gives authority to his bank for funds to be transferred. A means of transmitting and exchanging the <b>payment</b> <b>instruction</b> between the banks involved - usually referred to as clearing. A means of settlement between the banks involved - ie the payer’s bank has to compensate the payee’s bank, either bilaterally or through accounts that the banks hold at a third-party settlement agent, usually (but not always) the central bank. This Handbook considers these processes in more detail, and in particular the risks and policy issues that they present. A recurring theme is that, while there are a number of common risks and problems to be addressed, there is no single ideal way of addressing them. Solutions adopted in one country may not necessarily be appropriate in another. Another important message is that, in developing a new payment system or modifying an existing one, the emphasis must be on agreement and co-operation - both between central bank and commercial banks as the operators of the system, and between the system operators and its customers. This handbook is also available in Arabic and Spanish. Payment Systems...|$|E

50|$|Following an FX transaction, Settlement Members submit <b>payment</b> <b>{{instructions}}</b> to CLS. These {{instructions are}} authenticated and matched by CLS and {{maintained by the}} system until settlement date. The CLS daily settlement cycle operates with settlement and funding occurring during a five-hour window when all real time gross settlement (RTGS) systems in the CLS settlement currency jurisdictions are open and able to make and receive payments. This enables simultaneous settlement of the payments {{on both sides of}} a FX transaction.|$|R

The latest time for the exchange of files on any working day is 4 p.m. local time of the receiving bank for next-day execution. Therefore, the beneficiary’s account is normally credited two working days after the order is placed.|$|R

50|$|Another {{key element}} of the CLS Settlement Service is the {{liquidity}} efficiencies delivered through multilateral payment netting. On each day participants will very likely {{have more than one}} trade to settle—in practice, major banks will have hundreds or thousands of trades each day. Each day prior to settlement, CLS calculates the funding required of each Settlement Member on a multilateral netted basis. The amount of cash required by CLS to settle all <b>payment</b> <b>instructions</b> is reduced, allowing each Settlement Member to transfer only the net amount of its payment obligations in each currency, rather than the total amount of each trade to be settled. On average, CLS netting efficiency is in the region of 96 percent.|$|R

RTGS systems process and settle <b>payment</b> <b>instructions</b> individually in real time, ensuring intraday finality. Furthermore, central banks typically provide the settlement accounts across which payments are processed; hence, settlement is typically effected in central bank money, thereby eliminating counterparty risks between members once settlement has taken place. The model allows us to examine the key factors that influence both an agent. s decision over whether to participate directly in an RTGS payment system, and a central bank. s decision as to whether to require collateralisation of intraday credit extensions to payment system participants. ...|$|R

This article argues that concepts of value are conceptually and practically misleading. Identifying and determining the content of transactions are normative processes that depend, not upon identifying the precise mechanisms by which a particular change in legal relations is sought and executed, but rather upon the manifested intentions of the transacting parties. This allows us to deal straightforwardly with complex payment structures, clearing and credit, and to focus instead upon the role of transactions in the justification for a resulting claim...|$|R

40|$|Cryptography and {{the banking}} {{industry}} The banking industry, {{as well as the}} military, has been the largest market for cryptography. It is well known that modern cryptography began with the development of the Data Encryption Standard (DES), which was ignited by the strong business needs for secure communication by banks in the United States. In the 1960 s, US commercial banks were competing with each other to build a computer network for financial transactions between their headquarters and branches. Banks {{have to be able to}} ensure that information within the banking network, such as <b>payment</b> <b>instructions</b> and private information, remains secure. American banks therefore requested that the US government set a standard for a reliable cryptographic algorithm. IBM developed the algorithm and the National Bureau of Standards (NBS, now the National Institute of Standards and Technology, NIST) approved the DES as FIPS (Federal Information Processing Standards) in the mid- 1970 s. The DES is known as FIPS 46 - 1 and 46 - 2, but among banks it is more frequently referred to as ANSI X 9. 32, one of the US national banking standards. After the standardization...|$|R

40|$|Flower export has transcended beyond Ecuador‟s borders. This {{has created}} the {{necessity}} for the sales departments from flower exporters to master the English language, specifically business English oriented to flower sellers selling their products to English speaking buyers. This dissertation proposes {{to put together a}} course of English for specific purposes (ESP) that suits the needs of a group of flower sellers. Therefore, a situational and a needs analysis were performed in the field using digital surveys to learn about specific functions of the sales group. Once the information has been retrieved, an analysis of the language functions from the sales group was carried on. The result of these observations is a curriculum proposal, which has to be accepted for implementation by the company‟s management. Optimizing the sales group‟s time is crucial, so they will receive classes through videoconferences.

Its {{mission is}} to contribute to Third World development while avoiding creating the dependency associated with traditional aid systems. Support in locating funding sources is thus directed at developing economic activity {{and the creation of}} businesses and employment. Farmers' associations, women's groups, traditional fishermen and tradesmen in the informal sector, and small business organizations in developing countries have benefited from the support of RAFAD. Its activities fall into four programme areas: · access to bank credit through a system of guarantees for development groups engaged in economic activities; · a network of support for organizational matters, management and monitoring; · the search for new ways of funding; and · dissemination of techniques used in the North in order to find systems of aid outside the current system which results in too much dependence. The Foundation has already provided the equivalent of 200 years of bank guarantees for loans ranging from US$ 10, 000 to US$ 150, 000, to development groups or associations in 22 countries. In turn these have been able to provide credit to several thousand businessmen or small farmers. The average repayment of these loans has been 97. 2 %. RAFAD also helps to create development funding by contributing an equal amount to debt repurchase by donors in the North. Such a fund, equivalent to 700, 000 Swiss francs, was made available to the Madagascar Business Promotion Enterprise (APEM; Association pour la promotion de ['enterprise a Madagascar) as counterpart to a debt repurchase with a gig of 350, 000 Swiss francs from the Canton of Geneva.
