500|$|Bushnell {{felt that}} Pong was {{especially}} significant in {{its role as}} a social lubricant, since it was multiplayer-only and did not require each player to use more than one hand: [...] "It was very common to have a girl with a quarter in hand pull a guy off a bar stool and say, 'I'd like to play Pong and there's nobody to play.' It was a way you could play games, you were sitting shoulder to shoulder, you could talk, you could laugh, you could challenge each other ... As you became better friends, you could put down your beer and hug. You could put your arm around the person. You could play left-handed if you so desired. In fact, {{there are a lot of}} <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> up to me over the years and said, 'I met my wife playing Pong,' and that's kind of a nice thing to have achieved." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{majority}} of Tijuana's migrant Mexican population hail from Sinaloa, Michoacán, Jalisco, Oaxaca, and the Federal District. Because {{of the diversity}} of Mexico and the influx of immigrants from almost every region in the country, there are no accurate estimates on ethnicity or race of the current population. The heavy influx of immigrants to the city and municipality of Tijuana has led to job creation in the form of over 700 twin-plant (maquiladora) factories, which serve as the basis of employment for the {{majority of}} the working-class people in northern Mexico. [...] The high poverty level in Tijuana is attributed to the city's [...] "magnet status" [...] for <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> from the poorer south of the nation and citizens from other nations seeking to escape from extreme poverty. [...] Tijuana holds a status that provides the possibility of employment as well as higher education and the dream of crossing the border. [...] Tijuana and Baja California in general have much stronger economies and higher incomes than other Mexican cities along the United States border, as well as more moderate weather.|$|E
2500|$|The film {{continues}} to cause controversy; in February 2007, the Church of St Thomas the Martyr in Newcastle upon Tyne held a public screening {{in the church}} itself, with song-sheets, organ accompaniment, stewards in costume and false beards for female {{members of the audience}} (alluding to an early scene where a group of women disguise themselves as men so that they are able {{to take part in a}} stoning). Although the screening was a sell-out, some Christian groups, notably the conservative Christian Voice, were highly critical of the decision to allow the screening to go ahead. Stephen Green, the head of Christian Voice, insisted that [...] "You don't promote Christ to the community by taking the mick out of him." [...] The Reverend Jonathan Adams, one of the church's clergy, defended his taste in comedy, saying that it did not mock Jesus, and that it raised important issues about the hypocrisy and stupidity that can affect religion. Again on the film's DVD commentary, Cleese also spoke up for religious <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> forward and congratulated him and his colleagues on the film's highlighting of double standards among purported followers of their own faith.|$|E

6000|$|... [Footnote 37: It is {{northern}} American, {{to call a}} small 'lake' a 'pond,' a small 'river' a 'creek,' {{even though}} {{it should be an}} 'outlet,' instead of an 'inlet,' &c. &c. It is a more difficult thing than is commonly supposed, to make two great nations, each of which is disposed to innovate, speak the same language with precise uniformity. The Manhattanese, who have probably fewer of the peculiarities of the inhabitants of a capital than the population of any other town in the world of four hundred thousand souls, the consequences of a rapid growth, and of a <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> principally from the country are much addicted to introducing new significations for words, which arise from their own provincial habits. In Manhattanese parlance, for instance, a 'square' is a 'park,' or, even a 'garden' is a 'park.' A promenade, on the water, is a 'battery!' It is a pity that, in this humour for change, they have not thought of altering the complex and imitative mine of their town.--EDITOR.] ...|$|E
60|$|One more thing. Last night Judge Douglas tormented {{himself with}} horrors about my {{disposition}} to make negroes perfectly equal with white men {{in social and}} political relations. He did not stop to show that I have said any such thing, or that it legitimately follows from anything I have said, but he rushes on with his assertions. I adhere to the Declaration of Independence. If Judge Douglas and his friends {{are not willing to}} stand by it, let them come up and amend it. Let them make it read {{that all men are created}} equal except negroes. Let us have it decided whether the Declaration of Independence, in this blessed year of 1858, shall be thus amended. In his construction of the Declaration last year, he said it only meant that Americans in America were equal to Englishmen in England. Then, when I pointed out to him that by that rule he excludes the Germans, the Irish, the Portuguese, and all the other <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> among us since the revolution, he reconstructs his construction. In his last speech he tells us it meant Europeans.|$|E

60|$|We {{all know}} the new hotel near the station, where it is always gusty, going up the lane which is always muddy, where we are sure to arrive at night, and where we make the gas start awfully when we open the front door.

We all know how the gas, being lighted, shows maps of Damp upon the walls. We all know how the ghost of mortar passes into our sandwich, stirs our negus, goes up to bed with us, ascends the pale bedroom chimney, and prevents the smoke from following. We all know how a leg of our chair comes off at breakfast in the morning, and how the dejected waiter attributes the accident to a general greenness pervading the establishment, and informs us, in reply to a local inquiry, that he is thankful to say he is an entire stranger {{in that part of the}} country and is going back to his own connexion on Saturday.|$|E

Look at his persistence and endurance. With the child-brain that was to him he have long since conceive the idea of coming to a great city. What does he do? He find out the place {{of all the world}} most of promise for him. Then he deliberately set himself down to prepare for the task. He find in patience just how is his strength, and what are his powers. He study new tongues. He learn new social life, new environment of old ways, the politics, the law, the finance, the science, the habit of a new land and a new <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> to be since he was. His glimpse that he have had, whet his appetite only and enkeen his desire. Nay, it help him to grow as to his brain. For it all prove to him how right he was at the first in his surmises. He have done this alone, all alone! From a ruin tomb in a forgotten land. What more may he not do when the greater world of thought is open to him. He that can smile at death, as we know him. Who can flourish in the midst of diseases that kill off whole peoples. Oh! If such an one was to come from God, and not the Devil, what a force for good might he not be in this old world of ours. But we are pledged to set the world free. Our toil must be in silence, and our efforts all in secret. For in this enlightened age, when men believe not even what they see, the doubting of wise men would be his greatest strength. It would be at once his sheath and his armor, and his weapons to destroy us, his enemies, who are willing to peril even our own souls for the safety of one we love. For the good of mankind, and for the honour and glory of God." ...|$|E
