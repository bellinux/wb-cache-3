5|$|In The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life, Durkheim's first <b>purpose</b> <b>was</b> to {{identify}} the social origin and function of religion as he felt that religion {{was a source of}} camaraderie and solidarity. His second <b>purpose</b> <b>was</b> {{to identify}} links between certain religions in different cultures, finding a common denominator. He wanted to understand the empirical, social aspect of religion that is common to all religions and goes beyond the concepts of spirituality and God.|$|E

5|$|A Jonline {{is a short}} line used by scuba divers {{to fasten}} {{themselves}} to something. The original <b>purpose</b> <b>was</b> to fasten a diver to a shot line during decompression stops in current. The line is typically around 1m (3 feet) long and equipped with a clip at each end. One clip is fastened to the diver's harness, {{and the other is}} used to fasten the line to the anchor line. In current this relieves the diver from holding on to the anchor line during the decompression stop.|$|E

5|$|After {{reaching}} a virtual stalemate {{with these two}} wars against the Afghans, the British imposed the Durand Line in 1893, which divided Afghanistan and British India (now the North-West Frontier Province, Federally Administered Tribal Areas (F.A.T.A.) and Balochistan provinces of Pakistan). Named after Sir Mortimer Durand, the foreign secretary of the British Indian government, it was agreed upon by the Emir of Afghanistan (Abdur Rahman Khan) and {{the representatives of the}} British Empire but deeply resented by the Afghans. Its intended <b>purpose</b> <b>was</b> to serve as a buffer zone to inhibit the spread of Russian influence down into British India.|$|E

5|$|It {{has been}} held in the UK that when a public {{authority}} exercises a statutory power {{for a number of}} purposes, some of which are unlawful, the applicable test for deciding whether the authority acted illegally is whether the unlawful <b>purpose</b> <b>is</b> incidental to the exercise of the power or if the dominant <b>purpose</b> <b>is</b> itself unlawful.

5|$|As {{with the}} related genus Barosaurus, the very long neck of Diplodocus {{is the source}} of much {{controversy}} among scientists. A 1992 Columbia University study of diplodocid neck structure indicated that the longest necks would have required a 1.6-ton heart — a tenth of the animal's body weight. The study proposed that animals like these would have had rudimentary auxiliary 'hearts' in their necks, whose only <b>purpose</b> <b>was</b> to pump blood up to the next 'heart'. Some argue that the near-horizontal posture {{of the head and neck}} would have eliminated the problem of supplying blood to the brain, as it would not be elevated.|$|E
5|$|Benicio del Toro as Fred Fenster. Spacey {{suggested}} del Toro for the role. The {{character was}} originally written with a Harry Dean Stanton-type actor in mind. Del Toro met with Singer and the film's casting director {{and told them}} {{that he did not want}} to audition because he did not feel comfortable doing them. After reading the script, del Toro realized that his character's only <b>purpose</b> <b>was</b> to be killed to demonstrate Söze's power, and did not have any meaningful impact on the story. As a result, del Toro developed Fenster's unique, garbled speech pattern to make him more memorable as a character.|$|E

5|$|Flanders {{referred}} to the Marshall Plan as an important application of moral law to public policy.

5|$|For {{protection}} and preservation, a polished Japanese sword needs a scabbard. A fully mounted scabbard (koshirae) may {{consist of a}} lacquered body, a taped hilt, a sword guard (tsuba) and decorative metal fittings. Though the original <b>purpose</b> <b>was</b> to protect a sword from damage, from early times on Japanese sword mountings became a status symbol and were used to add dignity. Starting in the Heian period, a sharp distinction was made between swords designed for use in battle and those for ceremonial use. Tachi long swords were worn edge down suspended by two cords or chains from the waist belt. The cords were attached to two eyelets on the scabbard.|$|E
50|$|Each {{college has}} {{dedicated}} staff members who help students acclimate themselves to the university.

50|$|Professional fraternities, in the North American {{fraternity}} system, are organizations {{whose primary}} <b>purpose</b> <b>is</b> {{to promote the}} interests of a particular profession and whose membership is restricted to students in that particular field of professional education or study.

30|$|The Laozi’s idea is {{whatever}} we do must have a purpose in our job, purpose allows us to fulfil ourselves effectively and efficiently. Laozi uses the metaphor of people who occupy different jobs to illustrate impact of purpose on performance. A good passenger’s <b>purpose</b> <b>is</b> to leave no tracks and footprint wherever he travels; a good speaker’s <b>purpose</b> <b>is</b> to make no slips whenever he speaks; a good accountant’s <b>purpose</b> <b>is</b> to make no miscalculation even when he does not use calculator; a good locker’s <b>purpose</b> <b>is</b> to keep doors unlocked {{even if he does}} not use bolts; and a good knotter’s <b>purpose</b> <b>is</b> to keep knots untied even when he does not use ropes. Laozi’s idea in this passage is more concerned with job purpose instead of job function. In our modern business philosophy, job <b>purpose</b> <b>is</b> different from job function. Job function is the set of tasks a person performs in their role, whereas job <b>purpose</b> <b>is</b> the intended outcome of the job in terms of its impact on organization, community, customers, society or environment (Izzo & Vanderwielen, 2018). Those who have high purpose in their jobs and lives work effectively and efficiently are less prone to waste of resources. As a result, whatever they do {{have a positive impact on}} environment and society. The purpose-driven or effective leaders must understand the distinction between job function and job purpose, and instill a sense of purpose in their job and act on it.|$|R
