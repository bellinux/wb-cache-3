2500|$|Alone in {{the cabin}} outside Leadville, Baby Doe turned to religion. She {{considered}} her life of great wealth a period of vanity and created penances for herself. During the frigidly bitter Colorado high-country winters, she wound burlap sacks around her legs. With no money, she ate very little, living on stale bread and suet, and refused to accept charity. Baby Doe lived like this for 35 years. [...] During these years she wrote incessantly. In diaries, letters, and scraps she called [...] "Dreams and Visions", consisting of about 2000 fragments later found bundled in <b>piles</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> in her cabin, she wrote entries such as: [...] "Nov. 26—1918 Papa Tabor's Birthday I owe my room rent & am in need of food and only enough bread for tonight & breakfast.... my shoes and stockings only 1 pair are in rags." [...] An eyewitness described her in 1927 as dressed [...] "in corduroy trousers, mining boots, and a torn soiled blouse .... a blue bandana tied around her head", {{and went on to}} say that [...] "her eyes were very far apart and a gorgeous blue".|$|E

The Harpswell post-office was kept in Mr. Silas Perrit's store, and the letters were every one of them carefully and curiously investigated by all the gossips of the village, and as this was addressed to St. Augustine in Florida, he foresaw that before Sunday the news would be in every mouth in the parish that the minister had written to so and so in Florida, [...] "and what do you s'pose it's about?" ...|$|E

60|$|Entering {{beneath a}} wide archway, still bearing {{the sign of}} the Bear and Ragged Staff, Lucas led the way into what must {{have been one of the}} courts of offices, for it was {{surrounded}} with buildings and sheds of different heights and sizes, and had on one side a deep trough of stone, fed by a series of water-taps, intended for the use of the stables. The doors of one of these buildings was unlocked by Master Hansen, and Ambrose found himself in what had once perhaps been part of a stable, but had been partitioned off from the rest. There were two stalls, one serving the Dutchman for his living room, the other for his workshop. In one corner stood a white earthenware stove--so new a spectacle to the young forester that he supposed it to be the printing press. A table, shiny with rubbing, a wooden chair, a couple of stools, a few vessels, mirrors for brightness, some chests and corner cupboards, a bed shutting up like a box and likewise highly polished, completed the furniture, all arranged with the marvellous orderliness and neatness of the nation. A curtain shut off the opening to the other stall, where stood a machine with a huge screw, turned by leverage. Boxes of type and <b>piles</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> surrounded it, and Ambrose stood and looked at it with a sort of awe-struck wonder and respect as the great fount of wisdom. Hansen showed him what his work would be, in setting up type, and by and by correcting after the first proof. The machine could only print four pages at a time, and for this operation the whole strength of the establishment was required. Moreover, Master Hansen bound, as well as printed his books. Ambrose was by no means daunted. As long as he might read as well as print, and while he had Sundays at St. Paul's to look to, he asked no more--except indeed that his gentle blood stirred at the notion of acting salesman in the book-stall, and Master Hansen assured him with a smile that Will Wherry, the other boy, would do that better than either of them, and that he would be entirely employed here.|$|E
5000|$|From 1938 to 1946, he {{was married}} to Mary McCarthy who, like Wilson, was well known as a {{literary}} critic. She admired enormously Wilson's breadth and depth of intellect, and they collaborated on numerous works. In an article in The New Yorker, Louis Menand says [...] "The marriage to McCarthy was a mistake that neither side wanted to be first to admit. When they fought, he would retreat into his study and lock the door; she would set <b>piles</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> on fire and try to push them under it." [...] This marriage resulted in the birth of their son, Reuel Wilson (born December 25, 1938).|$|E
50|$|The {{sketch of}} an armoire desk which comes with this article shows {{a fairly large}} version with four folding doors, a writing surface which slides out, and a {{keyboard}} and mouse pad tray which, in turn, slides {{out from under the}} sliding writing surface. In the version shown here it is possible to leave a few thin <b>piles</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> on the writing surface before sliding it back in. In other versions this is not possible. Since most armoire desk are modern forms, the writing surface here is placed at 30 inches (76 cm) from the floor. In antique desk forms it would have been 29 inches (73.5 cm) from the floor.|$|E

She stressed how Carolina did not like the black men living in the favela and that they did not favor Carolina too much either. When she lived in Sacramento, she was sometimes called a witch, but in Canindé she was merely regarded as eccentric. They were less in awe of her writing, and more intimidated by it: [...] "In the favela, they thought that she was crazy, walking with her notebook under her arm. There were people who laughed. The worst ones laughed at her <b>piles</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper,</b> but they stopped when they realized that it was neither a joke nor craziness" [...] (103). She threatened to write about people in her book if she got upset. Jealousy of her writing, men, and lifestyle resulted in other faveladas becoming her enemies. However, this did not stop Carolina continuing to write about {{what was happening in the}} favela.|$|E

5000|$|Task {{conflict}} {{goes hand in}} {{hand with}} intragroup conflict because task conflict mostly occurs in workplace or group environments. In a business or workplace environment task conflict involves two parties who are unable to reach an agreement or move forward on the task at hand due to differing needs or perspectives. There are essentially three components of task conflict. The first is behavioral. It occurs when someone interferes with your goals or objectives. For example, you wish to keep your work desk neat and tidy, but your coworker keeps leaving <b>piles</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> all over it. The second component is cognitive. It is a disagreement between you and someone else due to a divergence between your interests, needs and objectives and the other person's interests, needs and objectives. For example, let's say you and a fellow researcher both need to use the company's supercomputer to process data on separate research projects. You each disagree about which research project has priority because it is in both of your interests to finish first, but only one of you can [...] Affective component is the third and final task conflict component. Affect means 'emotional feelings,' and in the cause of conflict, it means negative feelings such as anger, resentment and aggression. Getting into a fight with a coworker over personal resentments is a perfect example.|$|E

50|$|It’s {{also said}} that burning winter clothes on the Winter Clothes Day {{originated}} from a businessman’s promotion strategy. According to historical records, paper was invented {{by a man named}} Cai Lun in the Eastern Han Dynasty (25-220 AD). After Cai Lun invented the paper, many people came to his paper factory to purchase the paper. When Cai Lun’s sister-in-law named Hui Niang found that papermaking was profitable, she persuaded her husband named Cai Mo to learn papermaking form his brother. However, her husband was not very patient. He set up his own paper factory before he was skilled at making paper, leading to that no one came to his factory to buy paper because of its low quality. Hui Niang tried to help her husband get away from the trouble. Suddenly, an idea occurred to her mind. One night, she pretended to be ill and died. Her husband was extremely sad and guilty for he thought her death partly resulted from his behaviors. He blamed himself when he burnt the paper made by himself. Unexpectedly, a sound coming from the coffin appeared, which scared the people in mourning hall. It’s Hui Niang’s voice. She said, “Open the coffin, hurry up. I have come back”. When people opened the coffin, Hui Ning jumped out from it and told people, “Paper in this world becomes money in the nether world. I could not come back without my husband burning paper to me. The king of hell originally planned to torture me. Luckily, I used money to bribe him and ghosts. Then, they sent me back to earth”. Then, her husband took two <b>piles</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> to burn to his parents, hoping it could make his parents have a better life in the nether world. After witnessing the function of paper, people in mourning hall started to buy the paper from Cai Mo’s paper factory to burn. The story of Hui Niang spread quickly, therefore, unmarketable paper of Cai Mo’s paper factory sold out within a few days. The day was October first of the lunar calendar when Hui Niang “returned back from hell”, so people gradually offered sacrifice to their ancestors in front of their graves by burning paper.|$|E

We find that the “natural ” methods people use (with <b>piles</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> documents) are in fact very sophisticated and have a subtlety that is lacking in current computer interfaces. This analysis shows that the lack of expressiveness and responsiveness in current interface designs dramatically limits human performance, suggesting ways in which the next generation of analytic tools must evolve in order to support literate use of large volume / complex document collections...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{looks at}} the use of {{technology}} in the acquisition, storage, processing, and communication of cadastral data. If cadastral systems are to service the broader interests of society and support sustainable development then it will be important to address the core issues of the information society, including the protection of intellectual property rights and the privacy of the individual. Computerisation is not only changing how cadastral systems operate but also how and by whom the data are used. The most significant development will however be in the ways that value is added to the data through new forms of analysis.

However, {{there are no}} computer tools that support organization of paper documents on our desks. We ran a study of people's organization of their office desk space {{with respect to their}} digital workspace. This study resulted in a set of requirements for a media bridging tool. Based on these requirements, we built a prototype media bridging tool called PaperSpace that uses computer vision to link paper and digital documents. The system also tracks <b>piles</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> documents on the real desktop, and links those papers to digital documents stored in the computer. Digital documents can be sorted and grouped according to the physical layout of the corresponding papers on the desk. The system automatically creates digital piles of documents in a simulated desktop that reflect the paper piles on the real desktop. The user can access valuable information through the system, such as printing statistics, location of a printed document on the desk, and past projects and their documents. A two week user evaluation of the system showed interesting usage scenarios and future trends for improving user interaction...|$|E
