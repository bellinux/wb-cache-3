This paper {{studies the}} optimal {{visibility}} coverage for autonomous robots in complex 3 D environments. The perception sensor equipped on an inspection robot usually has a pyramid-shaped visible range with limited distance and angle. Finding the optimal pyramid visibility coverage {{for a given}} 3 D region is NP hard; this paper presents an effective progressive integer linear programming algorithm to compute an approximate solution. Our framework allows the user to specify a coverage rate parameter to balance the <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> <b>visibility</b> and the required guarding points for the given region. The algorithm is assessed in a simulated 3 D pipeline environment and demonstrated promising for detecting leaks, clogs, and deformation of the pipes. ? 2013 IEEE...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{studies the}} optimal {{visibility}} coverage for autonomous robots in complex 3 D environments. When a robot {{equipped with a}} range sensor is sent to inspect a 3 D region, we want the complete visual coverage on the entire region using smallest number of scans. The practical sensor equipped on the robot usually has a pyramidshaped visible range with restricted scanning distance and angle. Finding the optimal pyramid visibility coverage of a 3 D region is NP hard. In this paper we present an efficient computation algorithm {{to find a good}} approximate solution. Our framework allows the user to flexibly specify a coverage rate parameter to balance the <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> <b>visibility</b> and the required guarding points for the given region.

In other words, {{the audience for}} journalistic content, that is, those people who wish to be informed about the world around them, access news stories via the results pages of search engines as well as via social networks, and not solely via the websites of the news media. /nThis means the news media today have to implement an effective search engine optimization (SEO) policy to ensure their success, otherwise, these platforms (the results page and social networks) will not provide the <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> <b>visibility</b> and visits that these online news sites should be obtaining. /nThis document presents a framework for optimizing journalistic content, both {{from the perspective of}} web optimization or SEO and from the perspective of visibility on social networks. The framework can be characterized as being:/n• A methodology for training and for the acquisition of skills in the field of SEO and Communication. /n• A proposal for independent work, but one that {{is at the same time}} adaptable and compatible with the style books of different news media. /n• A proposal for new cyber media that need to adopt a methodology to begin their professional activities. /n• A proposal for comparing standards and procedures that any researcher or firm can adopt as part of their comparative analyses and benchmarking studies to improve procedures.

40|$|Different aspects <b>of</b> <b>visibility</b> {{degradation}} {{problems in}} Brisbane were investigated through concurrent visibility monitoring and aerosol sampling programs {{carried out in}} 1995. The relationship between the light extinction coefficients and aerosol mass/composition was derived by using multiple linear regression techniques. The visibility properties at different sites in Brisbane {{were found to be}} correlated with each other on a daily basis, but not correlated with each other hour by hour. The cause of scattering of light by moisture (bsw) was due to sulphate particles which shift to a larger size under high-humidity conditions. The scattering of light by particulate matter (bsp) was found to be highly correlated with the mass of fine aerosols, in particular the mass of fine soot, sulphate and non-soil K. For the period studied, on average, the total light extinction coefficient (bext) at five sites in Brisbane was 0. 65 ױ 0 - 4 m- 1, considerably smaller than those values found in other Australian and overseas cities. On average, the major component of bext is bsp (49 % of bext), followed by bap (the absorption of light, mainly by fine soot particles, 28 %), bsg (Rayleigh scattering, 20 %) and bsw (3 %). The absorption of light by NO 2 (bag) is expected to contribute less than 5 % of bext. On average, the <b>percentage</b> contribution <b>of</b> the <b>visibility</b> degrading species to bext (excluding bag) were: soot (53 %), sulphate (21 %), Rayleigh scattering (20 %), non-soil K (2 %) and humidity (3 %). In terms <b>of</b> <b>visibility</b> degrading sources, motor vehicles (including soot and the secondary products) are expected to contribute {{more than half of the}} bext (excluding bag) in Brisbane on average, followed by secondary sulphates (17 %) and biomass burning (10 %).

5|$|The {{economic}} {{importance of}} pipeline transport – {{responsible for a}} high <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> {{oil and natural gas}} transportation – is often undermined by the general public due to the lack <b>of</b> <b>visibility</b> <b>of</b> this mode. Generally held to be safer and more economical and reliable than the other modes of transport, this mode has many advantages over rival modes, such as trucks and railways. Examples of modern pipeline transport include Alashankou-Dushanzi Crude Oil Pipeline and Iran-Armenia Natural Gas Pipeline. International pipeline transport projects, like the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline, presently connect modern nation states– in this case, Azerbaijan, Georgia and Turkey– through pipeline networks.|$|R

The algorithm proposed in this paper decreases the number of edges involved in the computation <b>of</b> <b>visibility</b> by replacing traditional visibility with Delaunay visibility. With Delaunay visibility introduced, all strongly Delaunay edges are excluded from the computation <b>of</b> <b>visibility.</b> Furthermore, a sufficient condition for DT (CDT whose triangles are all Delaunay) existence is presented to decrease the times <b>of</b> <b>visibility</b> determinations.

40|$|In several visual tasks, {{participants}} {{report that}} they feel confident about discrimination responses {{at a level of}} stimulation at which they would report not seeing the stimulus. How general and reliable is this effect? We compared subjective reports of discrimination confidence and subjective reports <b>of</b> <b>visibility</b> in an orientation discrimination task with varying stimulus contrast. Participants applied more liberal criteria for subjective reports of discrimination confidence than for <b>visibility.</b> While reports <b>of</b> discrimination confidence were more efficient in predicting trial accuracy than reports <b>of</b> <b>visibility,</b> only reports <b>of</b> <b>visibility</b> but not confidence were associated with stimulus contrast in incorrect trials. It is argued that the distinction between discrimination confidence and visibility can be reconciled with both the partial awareness hypothesis and higher order thought theory.

40|$|Development {{cooperation}} has to {{be visible}} to ensure domestic political support. This explains the frequent calls for greater visibility at the headquarters level of aid agencies. However, effective development cooperation is not compatible with every form <b>of</b> <b>visibility.</b> Actions geared toward increasing the effectiveness of development cooperation become more challenging if these actions lack a certain degree <b>of</b> <b>visibility.</b> Whether aid is delivered on or off {{the budget of the}} partner country or whether aid programmes are aligned to the partner country’s priorities is linked to the domestic pressure on development partners for visibility in the partner country. This study analyses the influence <b>of</b> <b>visibility</b> on the implementation of the aid effectiveness agenda.

40|$|AbstractTwo {{vertices}} of {{a simple}} polygon P are visible if the line segment joining them does not intersect the exterior <b>of</b> P. The <b>visibility</b> graph <b>of</b> P is a graph G obtained by representing each vertex of P by a vertex of G and two vertices of G are joined by an edge {{if and only if}} their corresponding vertices in P are visible. A graph G is a visibility graph if there exists a simple polygon P such that G is isomorphic to the <b>visibility</b> graph <b>of</b> P. No characterization <b>of</b> <b>visibility</b> graphs is available. Coullard and Lubiw derived a necessary condition for a graph to be the <b>visibility</b> graph <b>of</b> a simple polygon. They proved that any 3 -connected component <b>of</b> a <b>visibility</b> graph has a 3 -clique ordering starting from any triangle. However, Coullard and Lubiw insisted on the non-standard definition <b>of</b> <b>visibility</b> (the line segment joining two visible vertices may not go through intermediate vertices) and they said they do not know if their result will hold under the standard definition <b>of</b> <b>visibility.</b> The purpose <b>of</b> this paper is to prove that Coullard and Lubiw's result still holds under the standard definition <b>of</b> <b>visibility...</b>|$|R
