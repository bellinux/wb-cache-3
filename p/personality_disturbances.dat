40|$|The {{psychological}} literature {{pertaining to}} the treatment of the patient with a narcissistic <b>personality</b> <b>disturbance</b> is dominated by the divergent theories of Otto Kernberg and Heinz Kohut. In this context, Stephen Mitchell’s theory of narcissistic illusion, which integrates Kernberg’s view of narcissism as a defensive phenomenon and Kohut’s view of narcissism as a growth-enhancing opportunity, is first reviewed. The current study then seeks to assess, through the application of Mitchell’s integrated treatment model to three long-term psychotherapy cases, the efficacy of Mitchell’s model. Efficacy is assessed through a comparison of pre-treatment and post-treatment, standardized, self-report measures, including Raskin and Terry's Narcissistic Personality Inventory and the Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory-III, as well as by Fishman’s individual-case-comparison method. In interpreting the findings of the case studies, I argue that the goal of treatment of patients with a narcissistic <b>personality</b> <b>disturbance</b> is to help them (a) acknowledge their narcissistic orientation, and (b) ultimately understand the function of their narcissistic illusion.

5000|$|American psychiatrists officially {{recognised}} {{concepts of}} enduring <b>personality</b> <b>disturbances</b> {{in the first}} Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders in the 1950s, which relied heavily on psychoanalytic concepts. Somewhat more neutral language was employed in the DSM-II in 1968, though the terms and descriptions had only a slight resemblance to current definitions. The DSM-III published in 1980 made some major changes, notably putting all personality disorders onto a second separate 'axis' along with mental retardation, intended to signify more enduring patterns, distinct from what were considered axis one mental disorders. 'Inadequate' and 'asthenic' personality disorder' categories were deleted, and others were expanded into more types, or changed from being personality disorders to regular disorders. Sociopathic personality disorder, which had been the term for psychopathy, was renamed Antisocial Personality Disorder. Most categories were given more specific 'operationalized' definitions, with standard criteria that psychiatrists could agree on in order to conduct research and diagnose patients. In the DSM-III revision, self-defeating personality disorder and sadistic personality disorder were included as provisional diagnoses requiring further study. They were dropped in the DSM-IV, though a proposed 'depressive personality disorder' was added; in addition, the official diagnosis of passive-aggressive personality disorder was dropped, tentatively renamed 'negativistic personality disorder.' ...|$|E

50|$|Another {{psychological}} {{contribution from}} Vives involves {{his thoughts on}} emotion. His ideas were largely influenced by the ideologies that came from Galen and Hippocrates {{in terms of how}} emotion is related to bile in the body. He agreed with the two with the belief that “different colored biles that humans have reflected different types of emotions”. Further, Vives believed that “Certain emotions color bile inside of human bodies and colored bodies likewise influences emotions”. According to Norena, Vives followed Galen’s recommendations of eating certain types of food for certain types of temperaments. Vives also suggested that almost all of our emotions, even those considered to be negative, are actually beneficial in a lot of ways. He expressed how there is potential to learn and grow from negative emotions as well as positive emotions. His emphasis on animism, or animal spirits, influenced Decartes according to Clements. Vives suggested in his work that the degree in which how strongly a person believes in his or her morals have a great impact on the way they feel about themselves-—“mental strength can influence physical strength”. Emotions, according to Vives, can be divided up into “Hot, cold, moist, dry, and varying combinations of the four”. <b>Personality</b> <b>disturbances</b> with emotions could be fixed when applying the correct temperature on to the body.|$|E

40|$|Objective: We {{found out}} the {{personality}} pattern of an incontinent population and proceeded to a correlation between the personality inventory and the ICIQ-UI-SF (International Consultation Incontinence Questionnaire Urinary Incontinence Short Form) to demonstrate reliability and sincerity of the answers and to establish that a <b>personality</b> <b>disturbance</b> may impact the physiopathology of micturition. Materials and methods: We performed an observational prospective study. It included patient's answers to a computed questionnaire combining a double ICIQ-UI-SF questionnaire and the 71 questions of the Minimult questionnaire. Forty-seven patients were asked to participate. Results: Over 37 patients included, Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney non parametric test confirmed agreement of the two ICIQ-UI-SF questionnaires with P = 0. 1792. Twenty-three patients were validated to the Minimult inventory with F scale < 70. We analysed variability of the two global ICIQ-UI-SF score in regard with the validity scale using ROC analysis. We observed an AUC of 0. 559 with sensitivity 78. 6 % and specificity 43. 5 %. No L score was above 70 demonstrating absence of lie. No <b>personality</b> <b>disturbance</b> was found in 9 cases. We observed six cases with a high hypochondric value, five with a high depressive value, and four with a high hysteric value. This neurotic triad was found in two cases. We noticed five cases with psychopathic deviance relative to antisocial behaviour while values of paranoia and hypomania were high in one case without any association of these personality aspects, which demonstrated absence of behavioural problem. Psychotic profile associating schizophrenia, paranoia, depression and hypomania was not found. We outlined in half of the valid population a significant high psycho-asthenic pattern. Conclusion: We conclude that a correlation between the personality inventory and the ICIQ-UI-SF is feasible. The comparative study demonstrate reliability of answers. Sincerity is established by the Minimult L scale. We confirm and precise literature information over clinical personality pattern of this population and observe relevant elements concerning the psycho-asthenic pattern which depicts an anxious personality with an important feeling of the problem. These elements permit to suspect that a <b>personality</b> <b>disturbance</b> may impact the physiopathology of the micturition. Level of evidence: 4.

40|$|This article {{offers a}} {{framework}} for understanding contradictory findings {{in the field of}} the personality of working and professional women. Modern theory and research display two patterns: the early pattern of the 1960 s, which viewed professional women as violating sex stereotypes, lacking femininity, and having personality disturbances; and the contemporary view, which emerged during the 1970 s and suggests the possibility of combining career with family without psychological conflicts and <b>personality</b> <b>disturbances.</b> A critical appraisal of the literature in four areas (psychological role conflict, fear of success, comparison between housewives and career women, and comparisons between women in traditional and pioneer occupations) concludes that little evidence supports the view that professional women have <b>personality</b> <b>disturbances</b> because of their career.

The article also analyzes the issues and problems professional women currently face and assesses the accessibility of those issues to empirical study.
