40|$|We {{introduce}} s-kNN, a {{nearest neighbor}} based spatial data mining algorithm. It {{belongs to the}} class of vector-geometry based algorithms that reason on complex spatial objects instead of point measurements. In contrast to most methods in this class, it does on the fly spatial computations that cannot {{be replaced by a}} preprocessing step without sacrificing efficiency. The key is a partial evaluation scheme for efficient computations. The algorithm is fully integrated into an object-relational spatial database. It is the basis for traffic frequency predictions (vehicles and pedestrians) for all German cities larger than 50, 000 inhabitants and is the basis for <b>pricing</b> of <b>posters</b> in Germany...|$|R
40|$|Poster {{presentation}} {{from the}} Living the Future 8 Conference, April 23 - 24, 2012, University of Arizona Libraries, Tucson, AZ. Due to significant {{cuts in the}} University of Mississippi's library budget, a ranking system was needed to determine {{the value of a}} journal to the local research and instruction needs. Major journal rankings products are not a strong resource to measure a journal's value because they exclude many journals and do not account for local research preferences. What was created was a simple algorithm to rank the business journal collection based on varying levels of usage, citations, and <b>pricing.</b> This <b>poster</b> will present an explanation of the algorithm, the resulting rank-order list, and what journals were actually cut...|$|R

Despite appearances, the door behind him is on a different plane from the ticket window. The rectangular structure behind the trombonist (to the right), defines the edge of the platform and shows the admission <b>price.</b> Above the <b>poster</b> is the gas pipe support beam. The trombonist stands shadowed on a pedestal (left of the central stairs) several meters in front of the platform, illuminated from the rear. While the tuba player is faceless, the red faces of the clarinetist and cornet players show that they stand on the gaslit platform.|$|R
40|$|With this BMW Profiles edition {{we would}} like to give you, as an admirer of {{historical}} BMW vehicles, the opportunity of occupying yourself more intensively with their roles in the respective times and society. BMW Profiles appears at regular intervals and concentrates in each case on a subject from the history of the BMW company and products. With the reproduction of original documentation -construction plans, photographs, press releases, advertisements, catalogues, <b>price</b> lists, and <b>posters</b> - there arises a vivid relationship between the BMW vehicles presented and their historical setting. At the same time it becomes clear how BMW has been developing in the course of its history to its present personality as a marque. (orig.)

50|$|The film {{industry}} quickly discovered that vibrantly coloured posters were {{an easy way}} to sell their pictures. Today, posters are produced for most major films, and the collecting of movie posters has become a major hobby. The record <b>price</b> for a <b>poster</b> was set on November 15, 2005 when US$690,000 was paid for a poster of Fritz Lang's 1927 film Metropolis from the Reel Poster Gallery in London. Other early horror and science fiction posters are known to bring tremendous prices as well, with an example from The Mummy realizing $452,000 in a 1997 Sotheby's auction, and posters from both The Black Cat and Bride of Frankenstein selling for $334,600 in various Heritage Auctions. The 1931 Frankenstein 6-sheet poster, of which only 1 copy is known to exist, is considered to be the most valuable film poster in the world.|$|R
