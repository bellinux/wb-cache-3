Inside the JSON attribute you don’t need a fixed structure. You can have various keys {{which may or may not}} be present in all documents.

40|$|In this dissertation, it is {{investigated}} how {{the current}} knowledge that people possess about a certain <b>product</b> <b>category</b> influences perception and aesthetic appraisal of product appearances within this <b>product</b> <b>category.</b> Through the reoccurring exposure to product appearances {{in everyday life}} people form Internalized Product Appearances (IPA) of different <b>product</b> <b>categories.</b> The IPA forms the benchmark to which a new product appearance is compared. This comparison process influences perception and aesthetic appraisal of product appearances. The IPA is <b>product</b> <b>category</b> dependent, which implies that the relationships of physical properties (e. g., shape, color) with perceived typicality, product attributes (e. g., modernity) and aesthetic appraisal are not generalizable over <b>product</b> <b>categories.</b> For example, a product appearance from a <b>product</b> <b>category</b> with an angular prototype shape (e. g., a toaster), is perceived as modern when made curved, while a product appearance from a <b>product</b> <b>category</b> with a curved prototype shape is perceived as modern when made angular. Deviating a product appearance from the IPA of a <b>product</b> <b>category</b> can {{have a positive effect}} on aesthetic appraisal of product appearances, but only up to a certain optimum level after which a product appearance deviates too much from the IPA to be aesthetically pleasing. The IPA is not the only comparison standard provided to consumers in daily life.

Based on this dissertation, we encourage designers to specifically look at the current design-style within the <b>product</b> <b>category</b> that they are working with. Then, designers and marketers can make a more market-oriented decision on how to design a product appearance that communicates the intended product attributes and that is aesthetically pleasing.

In this paper we provide a positive {{answer to this}} question by finding that among illiquid exporters leverage is negatively correlated with the quality of their exported goods.

Olive mill wate waters were subjected to elaboration with adsorption resins XAD 16 and XAD 7 HP, resulting in the production of 2 fractions, one enriched with polyphenols and one containing the colorants of the olive tree, respectively. The methanol fraction that resulted from the elaboration with resins XAD 16 of the olive mill waste waters was studied phytochemically.

This particular characteristic {{for the product}} makes the retailer’s reputation a crucial choice especially when he also sells a well-know product as branded goods.

Besides, the decrease of the production cost is not a sufficient condition to ensure a reputable own-brand. However, taking into account vertical bargaining power of the retailer vis-à-vis the branded good manufacturer reveals that strong retailers are more likely to sustain the reputation of their own-brand, except if the product is characterized with a lowfrequency of purchase.

40|$|Discrete choice {{models of}} {{aggregate}} demand, {{such as the}} random coefficients logit, can handle large differentiated <b>products</b> <b>categories</b> parsimoniously while still providing flexible substitution patterns. However, the discrete choice assumption may not be appropriate for many categories in which we expect consumers may purchase more than one unit of the selected item. We derive the aggregate demand system corresponding to a discrete/continuous household-level model of demand. We also propose a Method-of-Simulated-Moments procedure that provides consistent estimates of the structural parameters when only aggregate data are available. The procedure also enables the researcher to control both for the potential endogeneity of marketing variables as well as potential heterogeneity in consumer tastes. Using our aggregate estimates, we can measure the decomposition of price elasticities into incidence, brand choice and purchase quantity components.

There has been analyzed the structure of quality attributes that are used to assess the quality of logistics services. As the dominant requirement is stated the reliability of logistics services, competitiveness of structure and price, frequency of delivery, as well as an efficiency of logistics management. Logistics processes that are taking place at different levels are measured by quality of service in logistics network, logistics chain and logistics system. As indicators of the quality of logistics processes are analyzed as: disposition, shipping, transportation, storage, delivery. Analysis and improvement of quality is possible within and between logistics systems where the problem of quality involves difference between the projected and actual system. The quality of projected system is viewed through two groups of components: quality of management-business structure and quality of technical-technological structure of the system. From the social point of view, the quality of logistics services must meet the three analyzed functions: protection of environmental, life and health of people and protection of service users and consumers of the products.

The {{quality of the}} results {{is due to the}} fact that in geometric method the completion of the basic patterns is achieved by prototype implementation followed by viewing the correspondence between the body and the garment, by dressing the human body or industrial mannequin. In the case that the garment, designed and manufactured for type representative bodies according to the standards is dressed by persons that do not fit the type bodies for whom the product was made, the fenomena called “draping defects” apprears. These unconcordances between wearer body and product obtained in industrial system is due to the conformational features of potential users such as: buttocks prominence and form, hips prominence and form, pelvis width and length, ratio between front and anterior-posterior diameters of the pelvis. Anthropometry researches have shown that for a standardized value of the hip perimeter the secondary dimensions of the area (posterior buttock arch, length from waist the buttock point, lower arch of torso) may have different values.
