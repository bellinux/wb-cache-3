5|$|Each forelimb of {{the horse}} runs from the scapula or {{shoulder}} blade to the navicular bone. In between are the humerus (arm), radius (forearm), elbow joint, ulna (elbow), carpus (knee) bones and joint, large metacarpal (cannon), small metacarpal (splint), sesamoid, fetlock joint, first phalanx (long <b>pastern),</b> <b>pastern</b> joint, second phalanx (short <b>pastern),</b> coffin joint, outwardly evidenced by the coronary band, and the third phalanx (coffin or pedal) bones. Each hind limb {{of the horse}} runs from the pelvis to the navicular bone. After the pelvis come the femur (thigh), patella, stifle joint, tibia, fibula, tarsal (hock) bone and joint, large metatarsal (cannon) and small metatarsal (splint) bones. Below these, the arrangement of sesamoid and phalanx bones and joints {{is the same as}} in the forelimbs. When the horse is moving, the distal interphalangeal joint (coffin joint) has the highest amount of stresses applied to it of any joint in the body, and it can be significantly affected by trimming and shoeing techniques. Although having a small range of movement, the proximal interphalangeal joint (<b>pastern</b> joint) is also influential to the movement of the horse, and can change the way that various shoeing techniques affect tendons and ligaments in the legs. Due to the horse's development as a cursorial animal (one whose main form of defense is running), its bones evolved to facilitate speed in a forward direction over hard ground, without the need for grasping, lifting or swinging. The ulna shrank in size and its top portion became the point of the elbow, while the bottom fused with the radius above the radiocarpal (knee) joint, which corresponds to the wrist in humans. A similar change occurred in the fibula bone of the hind limbs. These changes were first seen in the genus Merychippus, approximately 17 million years ago.|$|E
5|$|Duke of Marmalade {{was then}} moved {{directly}} into Group Two class; {{he was sent}} to England for the Vintage Stakes at Goodwood in July, where his opponents included the July Stakes winner Strategic Prince. Ridden by Michael Kinane he raced just behind the leaders before being moved forward to challenge the leaders in the straight. He made ground steadily, but was unable to reach the front and finished second, beaten by a neck by Strategic Prince. Before his run at Goodwood, Duke of Marmalade had been supported in the betting for the following year's 2000 Guineas, but shortly after the race he suffered a <b>pastern</b> injury which required surgery; as a result, he did not race again in 2006.|$|E
25|$|High ringbone: The horse {{will have}} a bony growth around the <b>pastern</b> area, and the <b>pastern</b> will have less mobility. The horse will show pain when the <b>pastern</b> joint is moved or rotated. Early cases {{will have a}} {{lameness}} score of 1-2 out of 5, {{with little or no}} bony swelling seen, although possibly felt when compared to the opposite <b>pastern.</b> Lameness will worsen to a grade 2-3 on a scale of 5 as the ringbone worsens.|$|E
50|$|Short, upright <b>pasterns</b> {{are often}} seen in draft horses. This is because draft horses bred for pulling rather than riding (and so they were not {{selected}} for smooth gaits of a saddle horse), and because upright <b>pasterns</b> give more leverage to dig into the ground as the horse pulls a heavy load. Short, upright <b>pasterns</b> are also commonly seen in Quarter Horses, Warmbloods, and Paint Horses. However, riding horses {{are more likely to}} have problems with upright <b>pasterns</b> than draft horses because they tend to work at faster speeds. Due to the lack of shock absorption, horses that have upright <b>pasterns</b> should be kept off hard surfaces whenever possible.|$|R
40|$|R. Litvinenko. Burials of a Babino Cultural Circle With <b>Pasterns</b> The present {{article is}} devoted to {{research}} of burials of Babino cultural circle into which funeral stock included a bones of joints of the hoofed animals legs, frequently named <b>pasterns</b> (in Latin — Talus, in Ukrainian and in Russian — astragal). The all-round statistical data and the analysis of archaeological contexts of <b>pasterns</b> finds in burials are submitted. It was possible to reveal local features of use of <b>pasterns</b> in funeral ritual for Dnepr-Don Babino and Dnepr-Prut Babino cultures. The conclusion that, at least, a part from <b>pasterns</b> in burials performed a semiotics meaning of ritual knuckle bones or fortunetelling bones is made. Practice of use of <b>pasterns</b> in a funeral ceremony of tribes of Babino culture has been inherited by the population of Timber-Grave cultures. In the long term researches {{it is necessary to}} carry out the similar analysis of sources of Catacomb cultures, and then to lead the retrospective comparison of the data on cultures of a middle and late Bronze Age of Northern Black Sea region...|$|R

25|$|Poor shoeing and conformation, such as long, sloping pasterns, upright pasterns, long-toes {{with low}} heels, pigeon toes, splay foot, or {{unbalanced}} feet may predispose {{the horse to}} ringbone, as they create uneven stress on the <b>pastern</b> and coffin joint, unequal tension on the soft tissues, or worsen the concussion that is absorbed by the <b>pastern</b> area.|$|E
25|$|Joint injections: The <b>pastern</b> joint can be {{injected}} directly, typically with {{a form of}} corticosteroid and hyaluronic acid.|$|E
25|$|Arthrodesis: {{the fusion}} of the two bones of the <b>pastern</b> joints {{eliminates}} the instability of the joint, and thus the inflammation. This procedure may then eliminate the horse's lameness as well. However, surgical alteration of the joint can promote the growth of bone in the area, which is cosmetically displeasing. Arthrodesis of the coffin joint is usually not performed due {{to the location of}} the joint (within the hoof) and because the coffin joint needs some mobility for the horse to move correctly (unlike the <b>pastern</b> joint, which is very still).|$|E

5000|$|The horse's <b>pasterns</b> have darker hair {{than the}} rest of the horse's coat.|$|R
25|$|Trauma to the {{periosteum}} {{can cause}} bone growth on the <b>pastern</b> bone. However, {{this is usually}} not progressive unless nearby soft tissue was also harmed and thus the joint instability was affected.|$|E
25|$|Working on steep hills, galloping, {{and jumping}} all {{contribute}} to navicular syndrome, as they place greater stress on the DDF tendons, and may cause overextension of the <b>pastern</b> and coffin joints.|$|E
25|$|Horses {{that are}} not {{performing}} strenuous work, such as jumping or working at speed, will probably be usable for years to come. However, horses competing in intense sports {{may not be able}} to continue at their previous level, as their <b>pastern</b> joints are constantly stressed.|$|E
5000|$|Medical {{problems}} that are more common in horses with long, sloping <b>pasterns</b> include: ...|$|R
50|$|Conformation that {{encourages}} osselets to occur include short, upright <b>pasterns,</b> because this conformation promotes concussion.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>pasterns</b> {{are long}} (more than 3/4 length of cannon) {{relative}} to rest of leg.|$|R
25|$|The SDFT {{branches}} at the fetlock, {{creating a}} sling under {{the back of}} the joint. Thus, overextension of the fetlock is more likely to overstretch the SDFT than the DDFT, which simply travels straight down behind the fetlock and <b>pastern,</b> to attach to the coffin bone.|$|E
25|$|A dog {{walks on}} its toes {{like a horse}} does; a dog's <b>pastern</b> and paws are {{analogous}} {{to the back of}} a human's hand and fingers, respectively. The pasterns slope very slightly, but are not weak. Feet are round and compact with well-arched toes; the feet turn neither in nor out.|$|E
25|$|Osteoarthritis (the endstage of {{degenerative}} joint disease) of the <b>pastern</b> or coffin joint is a {{very common}} cause of articular ringbone. Bone is then produced to try to immobilize the joint and to relieve the chronic inflammation of the joint capsule. This process may take years, and lameness will continue until the joint is completely immobilized.|$|E
5000|$|Medical {{problems}} {{linked to}} short, upright <b>pasterns</b> are usually {{a result of}} excess concussion. They include: ...|$|R
50|$|The {{angle of}} the <b>pasterns</b> is best at a {{moderate}} slope (about 50 degrees) and moderate length.|$|R

25|$|Ringbone is {{exostosis}} (bone growth) in the <b>pastern</b> or coffin {{joint of}} a horse. In severe cases, the growth can encircle the bones, giving ringbone its name. It {{has been suggested}} by some authors that such a colloquial term, whilst commonly used, might be misleading {{and that it would}} be better to refer to this condition as osteoarthritis of the inter-phalangeal joints in ungulates (Rogers and Waldron, 1995: 34-35).|$|E
25|$|Excessive {{tension on}} the tendons, ligaments, and joint {{capsules}} of the <b>pastern</b> area can strain the periosteum. The body compensates by growing bone at the stresspoint. Strain on the extensor tendon, the superficial digital flexor tendon branches, the collateral ligaments, and the distal sesamoidean ligaments are all common factors. If these tissues are stretched or torn, and the joint is instabilized by the injury, new bone is produced to help to stabilize the joint.|$|E
25|$|Knowledge of equine forelimb anatomy is {{especially}} useful for understanding navicular syndrome. The navicular bone lies behind the coffin bone {{and under the}} small <b>pastern</b> bone. The deep digital flexor (DDF) tendon runs {{down the back of}} the cannon and soft tissue in that area and under the navicular bone before attaching {{to the back of the}} coffin bone. The DDF tendon flexes the coffin joint, and the navicular bone acts as a fulcrum that the DDF tendon runs over.|$|E

5000|$|... "Western"-style horse hobbles {{are tied}} around the <b>pasterns</b> or cannon {{bones of the}} horse's front legs. They {{comprise}} three basic types: ...|$|R
25|$|The {{first factor}} is {{compression}} of the navicular bone under the DDF tendon {{and the back}} of the small <b>pastern</b> bone. Repeated compression in this area can cause cartilage degeneration, with the cartilage flattening and gradually becoming less springy and shock-absorbing. It may also begin to erode. Cartilage degeneration is common in navicular horses, usually along the flexor surface. This finding, and the associated biochemical changes, have led some researchers to conclude that there are elements in navicular disease common to osteoarthritis, and to suggest similar therapeutic regimes.|$|E
25|$|Before {{beginning}} to shoe, the farrier removes the old shoe using pincers (shoe pullers) and trims the hoof {{wall to the}} desired length with nippers, a sharp pliers-like tool, and the sole and frog of the hoof with a hoof knife. Shoes do not allow the hoof to wear down as it naturally would in the wild, and it can then become too long. The coffin bone inside the hoof should line up straight with both bones in the <b>pastern.</b> If the excess hoof is not trimmed, the bones will become misaligned, which would place stress on {{the legs of the}} animal.|$|E
