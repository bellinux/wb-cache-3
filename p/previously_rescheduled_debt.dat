Therefore, it is relevant for policy makers and institutional and private foreign investors to investigate factors that influence <b>debt</b> <b>rescheduling</b> probabilities, as these may directly affect the size of and return on investments in these countries. Our findings suggest that policy efforts focused on reducing government expenditure, attracting foreign direct investment, increasing export revenues, and keeping a good repayment record result in low <b>debt</b> <b>rescheduling</b> probabilities and, in turn, decrease the cost of debt for these countries.
