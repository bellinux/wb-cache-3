5|$|The series follows Blythe Baxter, a 12 Year {{old girl}} {{living with her}} air pilot father, Roger. Forced to move out from her {{suburban}} hometown following her father's promotion, she moves into an apartment located in a crowded city. Their complex is located above the eponymous Littlest Pet Shop—a <b>pet</b> <b>store</b> that {{also serves as a}} day camp for numerous pets—where Blythe works as a fashion designer. Her adventure begins when she discovers that she alone can miraculously understand and talk to the pets that regularly stay at the shop, in addition to most other animals on the planet. As she and the pets spend time together, they find the pet shop jeopardized by larger <b>pet</b> <b>store</b> managed by Fisher Biskit and his snooty twin daughters, Whittany and Brittany Biskit. To avoid being dispersed, the pets convince Blythe to remain an employee.|$|E
5|$|Given Hasbro's {{framework}} for Littlest Pet Shop, the developers Cahills pitched their {{adaptation of the}} property. Hasbro originally felt discouraged over having the show set at the <b>pet</b> <b>store,</b> finding the exchange of animals they thought would come from that disconcerting. The Cahills saw the studio's definition of such stores as antiquated, convincing them that most modern locations provide grooming and day care services as opposed to merely selling pets. Production followed quickly, much to their surprise.|$|E

5|$|Littlest Pet Shop is a Canadian–American children's {{animated}} {{television series}} developed by Julie McNally-Cahill and Tim Cahill for Hasbro Studios. Based on the Littlest Pet Shop and Blythe toys owned by Hasbro, the show follows Blythe Baxter, {{a teenage girl}} who, after moving into an apartment in a metropolitan area, gains {{the ability to communicate}} with animals. Located below her apartment is the eponymous <b>pet</b> <b>store</b> where Blythe works and talks to a group of pets who regularly reside at a day care in the shop.

5|$|While {{the bulk}} of Post Oak Mall's 125 stores are {{clothing}} and accessory shops, as of 2009 {{it is home to}} several hair salons and cosmetic stores, two video game stores, two optical shops, a Dallas Cowboys Pro Shop, a store featuring Texas A merchandise (Aggieland Outfitters), and a <b>pet</b> <b>store</b> that primarily sells puppies imported from Canada. In addition to six food vendors in the central food court, the mall houses full-size Casa Olé and Chuck E. Cheese's restaurants, and kiosk versions of Auntie Anne's and Dippin' Dots. There is a small indoor children's play area located in the food court, a night club, and recruitment centers for the United States Air Force, Army, Navy, and Marines.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the late}} 1990s, both high demand and {{resulting}} high prices have fueled increased smuggling of slow lorises to Japan. Although pet shop employees declare that their slow lorises are captive-bred, the advertisements on the <b>pet</b> <b>store</b> websites indicate that their stocks come from Java, Sumatra, or China. New arrivals to the stores are also variable {{in size and}} age, which has further led the JWCS to suspect the slow lorises are imported illegally. Official, legal trade of slow lorises prior to CITES Appendix I coverage (from 1998 to 2006) was limited to just ten Sunda slow lorises from Malaysia and Myanmar. A review of 24surveys covering wildlife trade between 1990 and 2006 demonstrated 228slow lorises were {{known to have been}} traded unofficially each year and had come from Cambodia, Indonesia, Vietnam, and Laos. The major trade hubs were Jakarta, Medan, Singapore and Bangkok. Numerous illegal trade routes for each species were also documented prior to the 2007 CITES vote over Appendix I coverage in the Notification to Parties publication.|$|E

5000|$|RAPS {{worked with}} the city to ban the sale of rabbits and dogs from <b>pet</b> <b>stores.</b> The sale of rabbits was banned on April 1, 2010. A city {{councillor}} stated that extending the ban to dogs was [...] "a first step in {{sending a message to}} puppy mills and will reduce the number of dogs surrendered to shelters". RAPS had noted [...] "a steady stream of surrendered dogs, originally bought from <b>pet</b> <b>stores,</b> whose owners lose interest once their purchases outgrow the cute puppy stage." [...] The bylaw prohibiting sales of dogs went into effect on April 30, 2011, and survived a court challenge from <b>pet</b> <b>stores.</b>|$|R

5|$|Mercer {{talks to}} Kate while driving, imagining her {{sitting in the}} back seat of the car, but she hangs up in jealousy when he {{mentions}} Joely for the first time. He arrives in Sacramento and finds the <b>pet</b> <b>store</b> where Arlen worked. The owner (Maura Tierney) asks Mercer to sing in her children's band, for which she plays as part of her probation. When he returns to the car, he finds somebody trying to break into it, only to discover that it is Kate. They spend the night at a hotel, but he leaves without her the next morning and catches a train to Los Angeles, California. With the help of a translator, he phones Arlen's last residence and learns from a Hispanic woman that Arlen is working at a hotel in Ensenada, Mexico. Mercer finally meets Arlen (Jsu Garcia) at the hotel in Ensenada, but Arlen assumes Mercer is just there for money. Enraged, Mercer tackles his brother to the ground and gets kicked off the premises. Kate later finds a bloody Mercer sitting on the side of a road and takes him to a hotel. She tells him that she let him take her car because she was attracted to him, and they have sex. The next day Mercer meets with Arlen again, more amicably, and tells him that he and Kate are driving to Louisiana to spread his mother's ashes.|$|E
5|$|Mercer {{travels to}} a bohemian pottery-making commune in Shelter Cove, California where Arlen once lived, but learns that {{he moved to}} Reno, Nevada. He passes through Fallon, Nevada {{to meet up with}} the seductive Joely (Jena Malone), his middle school crush. In Reno, they take ecstasy and almost have sex before Mercer resumes his search for Arlen. Later he finds himself on the set of a pornographic film, where the {{director}} (Julio Oscar Mechoso) tells him that Arlen left to work at a <b>pet</b> <b>store</b> in Sacramento, California. Joely asks Mercer if he can drive her cousin Buddy (Colin Fickes) and his friend Rid (William Lee Scott) to Mojave, California, where they are building their own car. While driving, Mercer finds Kate's YMCA card in the trunk of her car and, now knowing what she looks like, describes a dream to her in which he, Joely, and Kate are dancing in a re-enactment of Bande à parts dance sequence. Not wanting to get sidetracked, he tries to leave the others behind in a motel room, but when Buddy threatens to steal the car, Mercer tells him that the car belongs to his girlfriend, and Buddy, Rid, and Joely leave without Mercer in Kate's car. He hitchhikes to Mojave and finds the salvage yard where Buddy and Rid are working, and retrieves the car.|$|E

25|$|Turtle racing has {{garnered}} controversy {{at times}} {{due to the}} treatment of turtles and the gambling that occurs at many races. The annual turtle races at the Gala Days in the Canadian village of Ailsa Craig have drawn particular scrutiny. After news of the annual turtle race was popularized in 2010, the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources told the organizers to cancel the event. Ministry officials intervened due to wild turtles being caught in a nearby river in order {{to be used in the}} race, threatening to fine anyone who entered a wild animal in the race. A ministry spokesperson cited the danger of spreading disease and disrupting the ecosystem by catching wild turtles and then putting them back. The spokesperson also cited the stress that the race caused the turtles. The event later proceeded as planned after turtles were rented from a nearby <b>pet</b> <b>store</b> for use in the race. Many residents had been catching turtles for weeks in order to enter them in the race, and area residents had to release over one hundred turtles.|$|E

He later started using 8 mm film but realized that video was easier. He began writing in adolescence, and at 17 years old he began experimenting with a Bolex sixteen millimeter camera. After years of experimenting with [...] "standard fare", he wrote and filmed his first real production as {{a senior in high school}} at Montclair Prep using money he earned cleaning cages at a <b>pet</b> <b>store.</b> The film was a thirty-minute mockumentary shot on video called The Dirk Diggler Story (1988), about a pornography star; the story was inspired by John Holmes, who also served as a major inspiration for Boogie Nights.|$|E
