50|$|A phylogenetic {{analysis}} using DNA (see Psittacula) {{showed that the}} Mauritius parakeet (<b>Psittacula</b> <b>echo)</b> {{is closely related to}} this species, and probably needs to be placed between the African and Asian subspecies. Consequently, this species is paraphyletic.|$|R

50|$|Members of {{the parrot}} genus Psittacula or Afro-Asian ringnecked parakeets {{as they are}} {{commonly}} known in aviculture originates found from Africa to South-East Asia. It is a widespread group, with a clear concentration of species in south Asia, but also with representatives in Africa and the islands of the Indian Ocean. This is the only genus of Parrot which has majority of its species in continental Asia. Of all the extant species only Psittacula calthropae, Psittacula caniceps and <b>Psittacula</b> <b>echo</b> {{do not have a}} representative subspecies in any part of mainland continental Asia.

5|$|Of {{the eight}} or so parrot species endemic to the Mascarenes, only the <b>echo</b> parakeet (<b>Psittacula</b> <b>echo)</b> of Mauritius has survived.

In 1834, the German zoologist and author Carl Wilhelm Hahn published an often-cited account of a live Mascarene parrot in the possession of King Maximilian I Joseph of Bavaria. The bird must have been very old at the time, and Hahn claimed an accompanying illustration was drawn after this specimen. The IUCN Red List accepts the 1834 account as the last mention of a live specimen.|$|R

50|$|During the 1970s, the Mauritius parakeet (<b>Psittacula</b> <b>echo),</b> {{the only}} {{surviving}} parrot species endemic to Mauritius and the Mascarenes, had suffered huge losses due to competing invasive species, predation from introduced mammals {{and loss of}} native trees in which to nest. By the early 1980s there {{were thought to be}} around 10 Mauritius parakeets left, with precious little recruitment throughout the decade. Whilst speaking at a 1990 captive breeding conference, Jones told delegates that the echo parakeet had a perilously low population and would likely become extinct, not for lack of expertise, but because attempts at gaining funding for the necessary actions had been fruitless. Mike Reynolds of the Parrot Trust approached Jones after the presentation, and the resultant collaboration brought much needed funds and veterinary expertise to the assistance of the species restoration project. Under Jones' guidance, nest boxes were placed in the forest, treatments to dissuade tropical nest flies from attacking the young in the nest and supplementary feeding for breeding pairs, and by 2005, 139 birds had been released. By 2015, there was a population of about 650 birds, and the species had been down-listed from Critically Endangered to Endangered in 2007.|$|R
40|$|For {{conservation}} managers {{tasked with}} recovering threatened species, genetic structure can exacerbate {{the rate of}} loss of genetic diversity because alleles unique to a sub-population {{are more likely to}} be lost by the effects of random genetic drift than if a population is panmictic. Given that intensive management techniques commonly used to recover threatened species frequently involve movement of individuals within and between populations, managers need to be aware not only of pre-existing levels of genetic structure but also of the potential effects that intensive management might have on these patterns. The Mauritius parakeet (<b>Psittacula</b> <b>echo)</b> has been the subject of an intensive conservation programme, involving translocation and reintroduction that has recovered the population from less than 20 individuals in 1987 to approximately 500 in 2010. Analysis of genotype data derived from 18 microsatellite markers developed for this species reveals a clear signal of structure in the population before intensive management began, but which subsequently disappears following management intervention. This study illustrates the impacts that conservation management can have on the genetic structure of an island endemic population and demonstrates how translocations or reintroductions can benefit populations of endangered species by reducing the risk of loss of genetic diversity...|$|R
