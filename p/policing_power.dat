Bundy also claimed that federally owned land in Nevada actually belongs to the state. According to The Guardian, Bundy told his supporters that [...] "We definitely don't recognize [...] jurisdiction or authority, his arresting power or <b>policing</b> <b>power</b> in any way," [...] and in interviews he used the language of the sovereign citizen movement, thereby gaining the support of members of the Oath Keepers, the White Mountain Militia and the Praetorian Guard militias.

Protesters also converged at the mouth of Gold Butte, the preserve where the cattle were corralled, and a tense, hour-long standoff ensued. BLM rangers warned over loudspeakers that they were prepared to use tear gas. Former Arizona Sheriff Richard Mack, who was with the protesters, said that they were [...] "strategizing to put all the women up at the front. If they are going to start shooting, it's going to be women {{that are going to be}} televised all across the world getting shot by these rogue federal officers". Protestors with rifles took positions on a highway overpass, seemingly offering cover as horse-mounted wranglers led protesters to face off against heavily equipped BLM rangers and snipers. Utah Lt. Gov. Spencer Cox, who officially traveled to the Bundy standoff to convey that Utah did not want the cattle, put the number of federal agents present at over 200. According to Las Vegas assistant sheriff Joe Lombardo, there were 24 BLM rangers and Las Vegas deputy sheriffs present at the standoff. Las Vegas police were not allowed to wear protective gear because of fear that it would be seen as a provocation. Clark County Sheriff Gillespie blames the escalation of the situation on the BLM, stating to the Las Vegas Review-Journal that the BLM has lied to him about having a place to take the cattle and the BLM did not attend town-hall meetings and disregarded his advice as County Sheriff.|$|E

In November 2010, portions of the suit were thrown out by the Cook County Circuit Court, including {{the claim that the}} city was using public funds unlawfully to enforce parking regulations after it was decided by the presiding judge that the city retained its ability to write tickets and enforce parking laws. However, the judge allowed other parts of the suit to stand, including an accusation that the city unlawfully conceded some of its <b>policing</b> <b>power</b> and its ability to set parking and traffic policy to the private company in the concession agreement. As of January 2011, the suit remained active, with the City of Chicago maintaining that the city retains all <b>policing</b> <b>power,</b> maintains responsibility for traffic management, and, through the concession agreement, retains control over rates.|$|E
5000|$|Max Weber {{wrote in}} Politics as a Vocation that a {{fundamental}} characteristic of statehood is {{the claim of}} such a monopoly, His expanded definition was that something is [...] "a 'state' if and insofar as its administrative staff successfully upholds a claim on the 'monopoly of the legitimate use of physical force' (das Monopol legitimen physischen Zwanges) in the enforcement of its order."

50|$|Barbour’s {{opinions}} {{began to}} unravel the work of Marshall’s Court, and set a precedent for future cases as the country became more polarized. Barbour’s arguments for the authority of President to interpret the Constitution as the President desires Kendall v. United States ex rel. Stokes, {{and the expansion of}} states’ <b>policing</b> <b>power</b> and power afforded to governing officials and Barbour’s argument for lack of judicial power {{on the basis of the}} Eleventh Amendment in Cohens v. Virginia, allowed Justice Taney to rule in favor of slaveholder’s that slaves were not citizens in Dred Scott v. Sanford (1857). Ironically, they were also used by President Abraham Lincoln to issue a suspension of habeas corpus in 1861, therefore fomenting political unrest, inciting Southern state succession and the Civil War.|$|E
50|$|Justice Barbour’s {{holding in}} New York v. Miln was {{supported}} by Taney’s opinion in Charles River Bridge that the people have rights {{and it is the}} duty of both the state and the nation to preserve those rights in order to ensure the happiness and welfare of every citizen. New York v. Miln allowed Barbour to begin to set a precedent for the understanding of state power as he developed a states’ rights constitutional vision for the Supreme Court. This opinion served to establish a narrowed definition for federal commerce power while expanding state <b>policing</b> <b>power.</b> For both Briscoe v. Bank of the Commonwealth of Kentucky and Charles River Bridge v. Warren Bridge, Barbour voted with the majority, simultaneously gaining more power for states and weakening Marshall Court nationalism.|$|E
5000|$|After the Night of the Long Knives, the Schutzstaffel (SS) {{became the}} {{dominant}} <b>policing</b> <b>power</b> in Germany. Reichsführer-SS Heinrich Himmler {{was eager to}} please Hitler and so willingly obeyed his orders. Since the SS had been Hitler's personal bodyguard, its members were far more loyal and skilled {{than those of the}} Sturmabteilung (SA) had been. Because of this, they were also supported, though distrusted, by the army, which was now more willing to agree with Hitler's decisions than when the SA was dominant. All of this allowed Hitler more direct control over government and political attitude towards Jews in Nazi Germany. In 1937 and 1938, new laws were implemented, and the segregation of Jews from the true [...] "Aryan" [...] German population was started. In particular, Jews were penalized financially for their perceived racial status.|$|E

5000|$|Miller’s The Novel and the Police (1988) drew on {{the writing}} and {{teaching}} of Michel Foucault to consider the novel’s setting {{to work as a}} technology of discipline. “Disciplinary power,” Miller wrote, “constitutively mobilizes a tactic of tact: it is the <b>policing</b> <b>power</b> that never passes for such, but is either invisible or visible only under cover of other, nobler or simply blander intentionalities (to educate, to cure, to produce, to defend).” Miller’s book thus countered critical celebrations of the novel as inherently emancipatory. (Indeed, The Novel and the Police exposed these celebrations as “perpetuating the novel’s ruse.”) Against this “subversion hypothesis,” Miller called for attention to the novel’s ability effectively to produce subjects, its capacity to form “a subject habituated to psychic displacements, evacuations, reinvestments, in a social order whose totalizing power circulates all the more easily for being pulverized.” ...|$|E

5000|$|During Barbour’s {{first term}} (1837), he heard three cases that mitigated Marshall’s {{accomplishment}} of judicial nationalism, Briscoe v. Bank of the Commonwealth of Kentucky, Charles River Bridge v. Warren Bridge, and New York v. Miln. Justice Barbour authored the major opinion {{for the case}} of New York v. Miln. In 1824, the state of New York passed a law that required all ship masters to provide a report delineating personal information of passengers {{in order to prevent}} smuggling and immigration of the impoverished for whom the state could not provide. Ship master Miln refused to comply with the law and was therefore jailed and fined. The case arrived to the Supreme Court on the issue of whether the New York statute regarding immigrants violated the Commerce Clause in Article 1, section 8 of the Constitution. Barbour held that the New York statute did not violate the Commerce Clause, because the statute was an exercise of the state’s <b>policing</b> <b>power</b> granted to the state to “regulate their internal police and to take care that no detriment comes to the commonwealth.” People could not be considered commerce for people are not “being imported goods, cannot fall within a train of reasoning founded upon the construction of a power given to Congress to regulate commerce, and the prohibition of the States from imposing a duty on imported goods.” [...] Justice Barbour argued that the statue was valid as an act of police power to protect the health and welfare of the community. Because it is within the powers of the state to have jurisdiction over its people and things within its territorial boundaries, then “the authority of a state is complete, unqualified, and exclusive.” ...|$|E

30|$|The {{involvement}} of private companies raises {{a number of}} issues, related {{to the concept of}} governance by and of platforms (Gillespie 2017). On the one hand, SM platforms have acquired responsibility in terms of content regulation: especially since States cannot police or regulate contents on SM companies without their collaboration (Gillespie 2017). However, delegating or imposing <b>policing</b> <b>power</b> on private companies (i.e. governance by platforms) comes with the risk of subordinating security to the for-profit agenda of capitalist companies. This creates issues in terms of democratic legitimacy and the possible effects on human rights, especially with regard to the quality of communication and the management of users’ data by these companies (see Cambridge Analytica). On the other hand, too much State governance of platforms risks abuse and ultimately chilling effects on freedom of expression (i.e. NSA state surveillance) (United Nations and Kaye 2016).|$|E
40|$|Abstract The {{distinction}} {{between high and}} low policing is increasingly relevant {{in the wake of the}} terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001. The paper reviews the content of the high policing paradigm and addresses recent criticism. Its first part provides an update of the defining features of high policing: absorbent <b>policing,</b> <b>power</b> conflation, protection of the state and use of covert informants. It is, thereafter, argued that the high and low distinction is considered to run deeper than anticipated by the various bodies reporting on the policing and intelligence failure to prevent 9 / 11. In part three, the place of private security agencies in high policing is assessed. Private high policing must be taken into account, but it only shares in some of the defining features of high policing and is lacking in others. Finally, the contrast {{between high and low}} policing is examined in relation to symbolic significance...|$|E
