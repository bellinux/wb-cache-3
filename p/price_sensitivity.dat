25|$|Research {{has shown}} that the direct rebound effects for energy {{services}} is lower at high income levels, due to less <b>price</b> <b>sensitivity.</b> Studies have found that own-price elasticity of gas consumption by UK households was two times greater for households in the lowest income decile when compared to the highest decile. Studies have also observed higher rebounds in low-income houses for improvements in heating technology. Evaluation methods have also been used to assess the scale of rebound effects from efficient heating installations in lower income homes in the United Kingdom. This research found that direct effects are close to 100% in many cases. High income households in developed countries are likely to set the temperature at the optimum comfort level, regardless of the cost – therefore any cost reduction does not result in increased heating, for it was already optimal. But low-income households are more price sensitive, and have made thermal sacrifices due to the cost of heating. In this case, a high direct rebound is likely. This analogy can be extended to most household energy consumption.|$|E

40|$|Risk {{management}} in financial derivative markets requires inevitably {{the calculation of}} the different <b>price</b> <b>sensitivities.</b> The literature contains an abundant amount of research works that have studied the computation of these important values. Most of these works consider the well-known Black and Scholes model where the volatility {{is assumed to be}} constant. Moreover, to our best knowledge, they compute only the first order <b>price</b> <b>sensitivities.</b> Some works that attempt to extend to markets affected by financial crisis appeared recently. However, none of these papers deal with the calculation of the <b>price</b> <b>sensitivities</b> of second order. Providing second derivatives for the underlying <b>price</b> <b>sensitivities</b> is an important issue in financial risk management because the investor can determine whether or not each source of risk is increasing at an increasing rate. In this paper, we work on the computation of second order <b>prices</b> <b>sensitivities</b> for a market under crisis.

40|$|This paper studies a Stated Preference (SP) {{experiment}} on {{the choice of}} type of (Rail) season card, conducted among current Dutch Railways season cardholders. They were asked to choose from the following three alternatives: (1) an unrestricted season card, (2) a cheaper season card with peak travel and travel frequency restrictions, and (3) not buying a season card. Multinomial logit (MNL), nested logit and mixed logit models are used to analyse their choices. It is found that MNL underestimates the <b>price</b> <b>sensitivities</b> (as measured by the price elasticities) of the respondents and overestimates their Willingnessto- Pay (WTP) for reductions in the restrictions. The mixed logit estimation shows that there are (unobserved) differences in the marginal utilities {{of the price of}} the card (response heterogeneity), and the utility of owning a season card (preference heterogeneity). In the Netherlands a large share of commuters and business travellers receive travel cost compensation from their employer. However, empirical studies often do not control for the effect of travel cost compensation. We find, as expected, that travel cost compensation has a large impact on the <b>price</b> <b>sensitivities</b> and choices of the respondents...|$|R
40|$|The {{assumption}} that the probability distribution of returns is independent of {{the current level of}} the asset price is an intuitive property for option pricing models on financial assets. This ‘scale invariance’ feature is common to the Black-Scholes (1973) model, most stochastic volatility models and most jump-diffusion models. In this paper we extend the scale-invariant property to other models, including some local volatility, Lévy and mixture models, and derive a set of equivalence properties that are useful for classifying their hedging performance. Bates (2005) shows that, if calibrated exactly to the implied volatility smile, scale-invariant models have the same ‘model-free’ partial <b>price</b> <b>sensitivities</b> for vanilla options. We show that these model-free price hedge ratios are not optimal hedge ratios for many scale-invariant models. We derive optimal hedge ratios for stochastic and local volatility models that have not always been used in the literature. An empirical comparison of well-known models applied to SP 500 index options shows that optimal hedges are similar in all the smile-consistent models considered and they perform better than the Black-Scholes model on average. The partial <b>price</b> <b>sensitivities</b> of scale-invariant models provide the poorest hedges. ...|$|R

We derive analytical expressions for the Laplace transforms in time of the <b>prices</b> and <b>sensitivities</b> of single barrier options in an exponential Levy model with hyper-exponential jumps. Inversion of these single Laplace transform yields rapid, accurate results. These results are employed to construct an approximation of the <b>prices</b> and <b>sensitivities</b> of barrier options in exponential generalised hyper-exponential (GHE) Levy models. The latter class includes many of the Levy models employed in quantitative finance such as the variance gamma (VG), KoBoL, generalised hyperbolic, and the normal inverse Gaussian (NIG) models. Convergence of the approximating <b>prices</b> and <b>sensitivities</b> is proved. To provide a numerical illustration, this transform approach is compared with Monte Carlo simulation in the cases that the driving process is a VG and a NIG Levy process.
