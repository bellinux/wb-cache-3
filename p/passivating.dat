5|$|Zinc {{burns in}} {{air with a}} bright bluish-green flame, giving off fumes of zinc oxide. Zinc reacts readily with acids, alkalis and other non-metals. Extremely pure zinc reacts only slowly at room {{temperature}} with acids. Strong acids, such as hydrochloric or sulfuric acid, can remove the <b>passivating</b> layer and subsequent reaction with water releases hydrogen gas.|$|E
5|$|Zinc has an {{electron}} configuration of 3d104s2 {{and is a}} member of the group 12 of the periodic table. It is a moderately reactive metal and strong reducing agent. The surface of the pure metal tarnishes quickly, eventually forming a protective <b>passivating</b> layer of the basic zinc carbonate, , by reaction with atmospheric carbon dioxide. This layer helps prevent further reaction with air and water.|$|E
5|$|Like {{the other}} group 8 elements, {{ruthenium}} and osmium, iron exists {{in a wide range}} of oxidation states, −2 to +7, although +2 and +3 are the most common. Elemental iron occurs in meteoroids and other low oxygen environments, but is reactive to oxygen and water. Fresh iron surfaces appear lustrous silvery-gray, but oxidize in normal air to give hydrated iron oxides, commonly known as rust. Unlike the metals that form <b>passivating</b> oxide layers, iron oxides occupy more volume than the metal and thus flake off, exposing fresh surfaces for corrosion.|$|E

5|$|The {{trioxide}} is {{volatile and}} sublimes at high temperatures. This prevents {{formation of a}} continuous protective (<b>passivating)</b> oxide layer, which would stop the bulk oxidation of metal. Molybdenum has several oxidation states, the most stable being +4 and +6 (bolded in the table at left). The chemistry and the compounds show more similarity to tungsten than to chromium; the instability of molybdenum(III) and tungsten(III) compounds, for example, contrasts with {{the stability of the}} chromium(III) compounds. The highest oxidation state is seen in molybdenum(VI) oxide (MoO3), while the normal sulfur compound is molybdenum disulfide MoS2.|$|E
25|$|Aluminium alloys often {{undergo a}} surface treatment. Electrochemical {{conditions}} in the bath are carefully adjusted so that uniform pores, several nanometers wide, appear in the metal's oxide film. These pores allow the oxide to grow much thicker than <b>passivating</b> conditions would allow. At {{the end of the}} treatment, the pores are allowed to seal, forming a harder-than-usual surface layer. If this coating is scratched, normal passivation processes take over to protect the damaged area.|$|E
25|$|In early 1959, Noyce solved another {{important}} problem, {{the problem of}} interconnections that hindered mass-production of ICs. According to the colleagues from the traitorous eight his idea was self-evident: of course, the <b>passivating</b> oxide layer forms a natural barrier between the chip and the metallization layer. According to Turner Hasty, who worked with Kilby and Noyce, Noyce planned to make the microelectronic patents of Fairchild accessible {{to a wide range}} of companies, similar to Bell Labs which in 1951–1952 released their transistor technologies.|$|E
30|$|In our {{previous}} work, we have systematically studied the ferromagnetic properties of Mn ions doped in the ZnO nanowire in different configurations, {{and found that}} the ferromagnetic coupling between the Mn ions exists in the ZnO nanowire with unpassivated surfaces while not in the nanowire with <b>passivated</b> surfaces [30]. In order to exclude the surface states locating in the band gap, which may have effects on the ferromagnetism and are not present in the <b>passivated</b> case, we <b>passivate</b> the nanowire using pseudo-H atoms.

25|$|Methanol and ethanol fuels contain soluble and {{insoluble}} contaminants. Halide ions, {{which are}} soluble contaminants, such as chloride ions, {{have a large}} effect on the corrosivity of alcohol fuels. Halide ions increase corrosion in two ways: they chemically attack <b>passivating</b> oxide films on several metals causing pitting corrosion, and they increase the conductivity of the fuel. Increased electrical conductivity promotes electrical, galvanic and ordinary corrosion in the fuel system. Soluble contaminants such as aluminum hydroxide, itself a product of corrosion by halide ions, clogs the fuel system over time.|$|E
25|$|The {{alkaline}} {{chemical environment}} {{provided by the}} alkali reserve (KOH, NaOH) and the portlandite (calcium hydroxide) contained in the hardened cement paste causes a <b>passivating</b> film to form {{on the surface of}} the steel, making it much more resistant to corrosion than it would be in neutral or acidic conditions. When the cement paste is exposed to the air and meteoric water reacts with the atmospheric CO2, portlandite and the calcium silicate hydrate (CSH) of the hardened cement paste become progressively carbonated and the high pH gradually decreases from 13.5 – 12.5 to 8.5, the pH of water in equilibrium with calcite (calcium carbonate) and the steel is no longer passivated.|$|E
25|$|Certain conditions, such as low {{concentrations}} of oxygen or high {{concentrations of}} species such as chloride which complete as anions, can interfere with a given alloy's ability to re-form a <b>passivating</b> film. In the worst case, {{almost all of the}} surface will remain protected, but tiny local fluctuations will degrade the oxide film in a few critical points. Corrosion at these points will be greatly amplified, and can cause corrosion pits of several types, depending upon conditions. While the corrosion pits only nucleate under fairly extreme circumstances, they can continue to grow even when conditions return to normal, since the interior of a pit is naturally deprived of oxygen and locally the pH decreases to very low values and the corrosion rate increases due to an autocatalytic process. In extreme cases, the sharp tips of extremely long and narrow corrosion pits can cause stress concentration to the point that otherwise tough alloys can shatter; a thin film pierced by an invisibly small hole can hide a thumb sized pit from view. These problems are especially dangerous because they are difficult to detect before a part or structure fails. Pitting remains among the most common and damaging forms of corrosion in passivated alloys, but it can be prevented by control of the alloy's environment.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In the work, the {{influence}} of electrochemical modifications of Ti 6 Al 4 V ELI on the in vitro corrosion resistance was studied. The specimens with carbon layer produced {{with the use of}} IBAD method on the <b>passivated</b> specimens were also examined. The characteristics of the grinded, the electropolished, the electropolished and electrochemically <b>passivated</b> and with the passive-carbon layer specimens were evaluated by the potentiodynamic tests in Tyrode’s solution. A flexibility of the passive layer was examined in potentiodynamic tests of the bended specimens. Results show that electropolishing and anodic oxidation in the examined solutions increased the in vitro corrosion resistance of the alloy. The corrosion potential of the polished and <b>passivated</b> specimens is much higher then the grinded samples. The increase of passive current density was not observed for the polished and <b>passivated</b> specimens. The passive layer was uniform that was proved by the AFM investigation. The tests proved high corrosion resistance of the <b>passivated</b> specimens that were bended (up to 90 °) to evaluate the flexibility of passive layer.

40|$|Surface {{passivation}} {{effects were}} studied on AlGaN/GaN high-electron-mobility transistors (HEMTs) using SiO 2, Si 3 N 4, and silicon oxynitride (SiON) formed by plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition. An increase of IDmax and gmmax {{has been observed}} on the <b>passivated</b> (SiO 2, Si 3 N 4 and SiON) HEMTs {{when compared with the}} unpassivated HEMTs. About an order of magnitude low IgLeak and three orders of magnitude high IgLeak was observed on Si 3 N 4 and SiO 2 <b>passivated</b> HEMTs, respectively, when compared with the unpassivated HEMTs.

2500|$|Stainless steel {{can pose}} special {{corrosion}} challenges, since its <b>passivating</b> behavior {{relies on the}} presence of a major alloying component (chromium, at least 11.5%). Because of the elevated temperatures of welding and heat treatment, chromium carbides can form in the grain boundaries of stainless alloys. This chemical reaction robs the material of chromium in the zone near the grain boundary, making those areas much less resistant to corrosion. This creates a galvanic couple with the well-protected alloy nearby, which leads to [...] "weld decay" [...] (corrosion of the grain boundaries in the heat affected zones) in highly corrosive environments.
