5|$|One example {{superalloy}} is Inconel 718, {{consisting of}} roughly 50% nickel, 18.6% chromium, 18.5% iron, 5% niobium, 3.1% molybdenum, 0.9% titanium, and 0.4% aluminium. These superalloys are used, for example, in advanced air frame {{systems for the}} Gemini program. Another niobium alloy {{was used for the}} nozzle of the Apollo Service Module. Because niobium is oxidized at temperatures above 400°C, a <b>protective</b> <b>coating</b> is necessary for these applications to prevent the alloy from becoming brittle.|$|E

25|$|In July 2013, {{the entire}} SAS span was {{completed}} and asphalt paving for the roadway began. Each deck segment is paved with two single-inch layers of asphalt and concrete {{which should be}} very durable and last for the entire lifetime of the bridge. However, {{the rest of the}} bridge is not paved with asphalt but instead only received a <b>protective</b> <b>coating</b> finish.|$|E
25|$|A {{less obvious}} hazard of welding is {{exposure}} to harmful chemicals. Exposure to certain metals, metal oxides, or carbon monoxide can {{often lead to}} severe medical conditions. Damaging chemicals can be produced from the fuel, from the work-piece, or from a <b>protective</b> <b>coating</b> on the work-piece. By increasing ventilation around the welding environment, the welders will have much less exposure to harmful chemicals from any source.|$|E
25|$|An alloy {{used for}} liquid rocket {{thruster}} nozzles, {{such as in}} the main engine of the Apollo Lunar Modules, is C103, which consists of 89% niobium, 10% hafnium and 1% titanium. Another niobium alloy was used for the nozzle of the Apollo Service Module. As niobium is oxidized at temperatures above 400°C, a <b>protective</b> <b>coating</b> is necessary for these applications to prevent the alloy from becoming brittle.|$|E

25|$|Natural {{graphite}} {{has found}} uses in zinc-carbon batteries, in electric motor brushes, and various specialized applications. Graphite of various hardness or softness results in different qualities and tones when {{used as an}} artistic medium. Railroads would often mix powdered graphite with waste oil or linseed oil to create a heat-resistant <b>protective</b> <b>coating</b> for the exposed portions of a steam locomotive's boiler, such as the smokebox or {{lower part of the}} firebox.|$|E
25|$|Vitreous-lined {{tanks are}} much lower in initial cost, and often include {{one or more}} {{sacrificial}} anode rods {{designed to protect the}} tank from perforation caused by corrosion made necessary since chlorinated water is very corrosive to carbon steel. As it is very nearly impossible to apply any <b>protective</b> <b>coating</b> perfectly (without microscopic cracks or pinhole defects in the protective layer) manufacturers may recommend a periodic check of any sacrificial anode, replacing it when necessary.|$|E
25|$|While {{in other}} respects the Spirit of St. Louis appears today much as it {{appeared}} on its accession into the Smithsonian collection in 1928, the gold color of the aircraft's aluminum nose panels is an artifact of well-intended early conservation efforts. Not long after the museum took possession of the Spirit, conservators applied a clear layer of varnish or shellac to the forward panels {{in an attempt to}} preserve the flags and other artwork painted on the engine cowling. This <b>protective</b> <b>coating</b> has yellowed with age, resulting in the golden hue seen today. Smithsonian officials have indicated that the varnish will be removed and the nose panels restored to their original silver appearance the next time the aircraft is taken down for conservation.|$|E

50|$|Tin resists {{corrosion}} from water, but can {{be attacked}} by acids and alkalis. Tin can be highly polished and {{is used as a}} <b>protective</b> <b>coat</b> for other metals. A protective oxide (passivation) layer prevents further oxidation, the same that forms on pewter and other tin alloys. Tin acts as a catalyst when oxygen is in solution and helps accelerate chemical attack.|$|R
25|$|The female insect’s main {{reproductive}} {{function is}} to produce eggs, including the egg’s <b>protective</b> <b>coating,</b> and to store the male spermatozoa until egg fertilisation is ready. The female reproductive organs include paired ovaries which empty their eggs (oocytes) via the calyces into lateral oviducts, joining to form the common oviduct. The opening (gonopore) of the common oviduct is concealed in a cavity called the genital chamber and this serves as a copulatory pouch (bursa copulatrix) when mating. The external opening to this is the vulva. Often in insects the vulva is narrow and the genital chamber becomes pouch or tube like and is called the vagina. Related to the vagina is a saclike structure, the spermatheca, where spermatozoa are stored ready for egg fertilisation. A secretory gland nourishes the contained spermatozoa in the vagina.|$|E
25|$|Engaging {{in combat}} {{thousands}} of {{light years away}} from Earth, Mandella and his soldiers need to resort to medieval weapons in order to fight inside a stasis field which neutralizes all electromagnetic radiation in anything not covered with a <b>protective</b> <b>coating.</b> It {{turns out to be}} the last conflict of the war. Humanity has begun to clone itself, resulting in a new, collective species calling itself simply Man. Unlike its predecessor Man is able to communicate with the Taurans, who are also clones. It is discovered that the war started due to a misunderstanding; the colony ships were lost to accidents and those on Earth with a vested interest in a new war used these disappearances as an excuse to begin the conflict. The futile, meaningless war, which had lasted for more than a thousand years, ends.|$|E
500|$|To {{achieve a}} tone and quality {{that was true}} to the story as well as {{reflected}} {{the period in which}} it is set, Spielberg once again collaborated with cinematographer Janusz Kamiński, saying, [...] "Early on, we both knew that we did not want this to look like a Technicolor extravaganza about World War II, but more like color newsreel footage from the 1940s, which is very desaturated and low-tech." [...] Kamiński had the <b>protective</b> <b>coating</b> stripped from the camera lenses, making them closer to those used in the 1940s. He explains that [...] "without the <b>protective</b> <b>coating,</b> the light goes in and starts bouncing around, which makes it slightly more diffused and a bit softer without being out of focus." [...] The cinematographer completed the overall effect by putting the negative through bleach bypass, a process that reduces brightness and color saturation. The shutter timing was set to 90 or 45 degrees for many of the battle sequences, as opposed to the standard of 180-degree timing. Kamiński clarifies, [...] "In this way, we attained a certain staccato in the actors' movements and a certain crispness in the explosions, which makes them slightly more realistic." ...|$|E
50|$|The virino is a {{hypothetical}} infectious particle {{that was once}} theorized to {{be the cause of}} scrapie and other degenerative diseases of the central nervous system; it was thought to consist of nucleic acids in a <b>protective</b> <b>coat</b> of host cell proteins. The hypothesis was never widely accepted and the causative agents responsible for these diseases are now known to be prions.|$|R

The hull {{is made of}} wooden planks that are held together by ropes of coconut fiber; the usual wood is 'Anjali'. The roof is made of bamboo poles and palm leaves. The exterior of the boat is painted with <b>protective</b> <b>coats</b> of cashew nut oil.|$|R
50|$|Firefighters {{are usually}} seen in <b>protective</b> <b>coats</b> and helmets as they rescue victims and battle devastating fires. But these firemen decided to don {{civilian}} clothes and {{reach out to}} Filipinos {{through the power of}} music. Spreading the message of fire safety awareness through their song is an extension of their duties-a noble endeavor that could hopefully reduce the casualties in fire-related incidents in the country.|$|R
500|$|An uproar {{occurred}} in 1995 when a maintenance worker in St. Ignace, Michigan, refurbished the bell by stripping the <b>protective</b> <b>coating</b> applied by Michigan State University experts. The controversy continued when the Great Lakes Shipwreck Museum {{tried to use}} the bell as a touring exhibit in 1996. Relatives of the crew halted this move, objecting that the bell was {{being used as a}} [...] "traveling trophy." [...] The bell is now on display in the Great Lakes Shipwreck Museum in Whitefish Point near Paradise, Michigan.|$|E
500|$|Shoe polish {{is applied}} to the shoe using a rag, cloth, or brush. Shoe polish is not a {{cleaning}} product, and therefore the footwear should be both clean and dry before application. A vigorous rubbing action to apply the polish evenly on the boot, followed by further buffing with a clean dry cloth or brush, usually provides good results. Another technique, known as spit-polishing or bull polishing, involves gently rubbing polish into the leather with a cloth and a drop of water or spit. This achieves the mirror-like, high-gloss finish sometimes known as a spit shine or bull which is especially valued in military organizations. Despite the term, saliva is less commonly used as the vehicle or diluent with polish than is water. [...] Polishes containing carnauba wax {{can be used as a}} <b>protective</b> <b>coating</b> to extend the life and look of a leather shoe.|$|E
500|$|Construction of the Perkin-Elmer mirror {{began in}} 1979, {{starting}} with a blank manufactured by Corning from their ultra-low expansion glass. To keep the mirror's weight to a minimum it consisted of top and bottom plates, each one inch (25.4mm) thick, sandwiching a honeycomb lattice. Perkin-Elmer simulated microgravity by supporting the mirror from the back with 130 rods that exerted varying amounts of force. This ensured that the mirror's final shape would be correct and to specification when finally deployed. Mirror polishing continued until May 1981. NASA reports at the time questioned Perkin-Elmer's managerial structure, and the polishing began to slip behind schedule and over budget. To save money, NASA halted work on the back-up mirror and put the launch date of the telescope back to October 1984. The mirror was completed {{by the end of}} 1981; it was washed using 2,400 gallons (9,100 L) of hot, deionized water and then received a reflective coating of [...] 65nm-thick aluminum and a <b>protective</b> <b>coating</b> of 25nm-thick magnesium fluoride.|$|E
