5|$|A ring could {{possibly}} exist in Himalia's orbit. One <b>possible</b> <b>explanation</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> a small moon had crashed into Himalia {{and the force}} of the impact caused material to blast off Himalia.|$|E
5|$|If {{consciousness}} (the mind) {{can exist}} independently of physical reality (the brain), one must explain how physical memories are created concerning consciousness. Dualism must therefore explain how consciousness affects physical reality. One <b>possible</b> <b>explanation</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> of a miracle, proposed by Arnold Geulincx and Nicolas Malebranche, where all mind–body interactions require the direct intervention of God.|$|E
5|$|A {{detailed}} topographic {{analysis of}} the Hawaiian – Emperor seamount chain reveals the hotspot {{as the center of}} a topographic high, and that elevation falls with distance from the hotspot. The most rapid decrease in elevation and the highest ratio between the topography and geoid height are over the southeastern part of the chain, falling with distance from the hotspot, particularly at the intersection of the Molokai and Murray fracture zones. The most likely explanation is that the region between the two zones is more susceptible to reheating than most of the chain. Another <b>possible</b> <b>explanation</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the hotspot strength swells and subsides over time.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} his Thracian campaign, Philip moved {{against the}} city of Perinthos, {{formerly}} his ally. Diodorus says that this was because the city had begun to oppose him, and favour the Athenians; however, from Athenian sources, {{there is no indication that}} this was the case. One <b>possible</b> <b>explanation</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Perinthos had refused to send aid to Philip during the Thracian campaign, and it was for this reason he decided to attack it. Either way, since Perinthos was a Greek city, Philip's actions gave the Athenian war-party the excuse it had been looking for to disrupt the peace Philip had wrought in Greece, thereby starting a new phase in the wars.|$|E
5|$|Data {{collected}} in the North Sea {{have shown that the}} overall incidence of decompression sickness for in-water and surface decompression is similar, but surface decompression tends to produce ten times more type II (neurological) DCS than in-water decompression. A <b>possible</b> <b>explanation</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> during the final stage of ascent, bubbles are produced that are stopped in the lung capillaries. During recompression of the diver in the deck chamber, the diameter of some of these bubbles is reduced sufficiently that they pass through the pulmonary capillaries and reach the systemic circulation on the arterial side, later lodging in systemic capillaries and causing neurological symptoms. The same scenario was proposed for type II DCS recorded after sawtooth profile diving or multiple repetitive diving.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{apparent}} cheapness of manufacture of their basic components, many surviving examples of Late Roman helmets, including the Intercisa type, show evidence of expensive decoration {{in the form}} of silver or silver-gilt sheathing. A <b>possible</b> <b>explanation</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> most of the surviving exemplars may have belonged to officers and that silver- or gold-plating denoted rank; and, in the case of mounted gemstones, high rank e.g. the ornate Deurne helmet, believed by some historians to have belonged to a senior officer. Other academics, in contrast, consider that silver-sheathed helmets may have been widely worn by comitatenses soldiers, given as a form of pay or reward. Roman law indicates that all helmets of this construction were supposed to be sheathed in a specific amount of gold or silver.|$|E

50|$|Often the veils, {{ribbons and}} mountings, or rods have <b>been</b> lost. Some <b>possible</b> <b>explanations</b> <b>are</b> <b>that</b> they <b>were</b> {{discarded}} {{when they become}} severely deteriorated and were not replaced.

Dealers or collectors or the museum sometimes remove them for particular reasons.|$|R
30|$|After 17 : 00 UT {{when the}} pump cycle changes to 2 min on, 2 min off, there {{also appears to}} be a gap of reduced or nonexistent {{backscatter}} close to the 32 nd range gate. <b>Possible</b> <b>explanations</b> <b>are</b> <b>that</b> the ionosphere <b>is</b> under-dense in this region of space or that the CUTLASS radar orthogonality condition for backscatter breaks down here so no signal is received.|$|R
5|$|Noctilucent {{clouds are}} known to exhibit high radar reflectivity, in a {{frequency}} range of 50MHz to 1.3GHz. This behaviour is not well understood but a <b>possible</b> <b>explanation</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the ice grains become coated with a thin metal film composed of sodium and iron, which makes the cloud far more reflective to radar, although this explanation remains controversial. Sodium and iron atoms are stripped from incoming micrometeors and settle into a layer just above the altitude of noctilucent clouds, and measurements have shown that these elements are severely depleted when the clouds are present. Other experiments have demonstrated that, at the extremely cold temperatures of a noctilucent cloud, sodium vapour can rapidly be deposited onto an ice surface.|$|E
5|$|The major Ordovician–Silurian {{extinction}} events 450 {{million years}} ago may {{have been caused by}} a GRB. The late Ordovician species of trilobites that spent portions of their lives in the plankton layer near the ocean surface were much harder hit than deep-water dwellers, which tended to remain within quite restricted areas. This is in contrast to the usual pattern of extinction events, wherein species with more widely spread populations typically fare better. A <b>possible</b> <b>explanation</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> trilobites remaining in deep water would be more shielded from the increased UV radiation associated with a GRB. Also supportive of this hypothesis is the fact that during the late Ordovician, burrowing bivalve species were less likely to go extinct than bivalves that lived on the surface.|$|E
5|$|Despite this {{evidence}} of Mercian {{involvement in the}} southeast {{there is very little}} indication that Æthelred had expansionist ambitions to the south. The increasing strength of the West Saxons under Cædwalla and Ine would have limited Mercian opportunities in that direction. The Northumbrians were no longer a distraction; they had been contained north of the Humber since the Battle of the Trent, and became even less of a threat after their disastrous defeat in 685 {{at the hands of the}} Picts. A <b>possible</b> <b>explanation</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Æthelred was preoccupied with war with the Welsh. It was also at this time that the Hwicce came more definitely into the Mercian orbit. The last Hwiccean ruler to take the title of king was Oshere, who died in 685; but from the mid-670s he sought Æthelred's consent for his grants, and Æthelred regarded him as a subking. Further evidence of Æthelred's involvement among the Hwicce comes from a charter in which he grants land for a minster in Gloucestershire, in Hwiccean territory; the charter is generally thought to be a fabrication, but it appears to be based on an authentic earlier source.|$|E
50|$|The {{effect was}} only found for {{elliptical}} {{and not for}} spiral galaxies. One <b>possible</b> <b>explanation</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> younger galaxies contain more red giants than older galaxies. This kind of evolution could not exist according to the steady-state theory. Later analysis of the same data showed <b>that</b> the data <b>was</b> inadequate to establish the claimed effect. After further measurements and analysis Whitford withdrew the claim in 1956.|$|R
50|$|Heavily speculated as a {{possible}} Republican candidate in the 2012 presidential election, Paul again appeared on the 2010 CPAC Straw Poll. Paul easily won the straw poll and defeated Mitt Romney, who had won the straw poll the previous three years.

5|$|During its {{period of}} migration, Neptune {{is thought to}} have {{captured}} a large KBO, Triton, which is the only large moon in the Solar System with a retrograde orbit (it orbits opposite to Neptune's rotation). This suggests that, unlike the large moons of Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus, which are thought to have coalesced from rotating discs of material around their young parent planets, Triton was a fully formed body that was captured from surrounding space. Gravitational capture of an object is not easy: it requires some mechanism to slow down the object enough to be caught by the larger object's gravity. A <b>possible</b> <b>explanation</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Triton was part of a binary when it encountered Neptune. (Many KBOs are members of binaries. See below.) Ejection of the other member of the binary by Neptune could then explain Triton's capture. Triton is only 14% larger than Pluto, and spectral analysis of both worlds shows that their surfaces are largely composed of similar materials, such as methane and carbon monoxide. All this points to the conclusion that Triton was once a KBO that was captured by Neptune during its outward migration.|$|E
5|$|The δ ring is {{circular}} {{and slightly}} inclined. It shows significant unexplained azimuthal variations in normal optical depth and width. One <b>possible</b> <b>explanation</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the ring has an azimuthal wave-like structure, excited {{by a small}} moonlet just inside it. The sharp {{outer edge of the}} δ ring is in 23:22 resonance with Cordelia. The δ ring consists of two components: a narrow optically dense component and a broad inward shoulder with low optical depth. The width of the narrow component is 4.1–6.1km and the equivalent depth is about 2.2km, which corresponds to a normal optical depth of about 0.3–0.6. The ring's broad component is about 10–12km wide and its equivalent depth is close to 0.3km, indicating a low normal optical depth of 3×10−2. This is known only from occultation data because Voyager 2's imaging experiment failed to resolve the δ ring. When observed in forward-scattering geometry by Voyager 2, the δ ring appeared relatively bright, which is compatible with the presence of dust in its broad component. The broad component is geometrically thicker than the narrow component. This is supported by the observations of a ring plane-crossing event in 2007, when the δ ring remained visible, which is consistent with the behavior of a simultaneously geometrically thick and optically thin ring.|$|E
25|$|The pure {{anhydrous}} orthorhombic form (δ) rapidly {{changes to}} one of the other forms on exposure to the atmosphere, and a <b>possible</b> <b>explanation</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the OH− ions originating from the absorbed water facilitate the rearrangement.

25|$|In 644, Umar {{was assassinated}} by a Persian slave named Abu Lulu by later accounts. His {{motivation}} for the assassination is not clear. One <b>possible</b> <b>explanation</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> it <b>was</b> done {{in response to the}} Muslim conquest of Persia. The assassination was planned several months earlier. In October 644, Umar undertook a Hajj to Mecca, during which the assassins pronounced Umar's imminent death that year, and the massive crowd of the congregation was used by the conspirators as a veil to hide themselves.|$|R

50|$|The {{purpose of}} the pyramid is under debate by scholars.

25|$|When the {{temperature}} of the nest becomes too hot (over 29°C), the queen attempts to fan the nest to bring {{the temperature}} back down. In addition, workers have been observed to modulate body temperature. As protein content of food sources increase, thoracic temperature increases.

A <b>possible</b> <b>explanation</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> they modulate thoracic temperatures to increase foraging efficiency.|$|E
25|$|Tuberculosis: Another <b>possible</b> <b>explanation</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{carriers}} {{of the gene}} could have some resistance to TB. This hypothesis {{is based on the}} thesis that CFTR gene mutation carriers have insufficient action in one of their enzymes – arylsulphatase - which is necessary for Mycobacterium tuberculosis virulence. As M. tuberculosis would use its host’s sources to affect the individual, and {{due to the lack of}} enzyme it could not presents its virulence, being a carrier of CFTR mutation could provide resistance against tuberculosis.|$|E

5|$|About an {{hour after}} {{fragment}} K entered Jupiter, observers recorded auroral emission near the impact region, {{as well as at}} the antipode of the impact site with respect to Jupiter's strong magnetic field. The cause of these emissions was difficult to establish due to a lack of knowledge of Jupiter's internal magnetic field and of the geometry of the impact sites. One <b>possible</b> <b>explanation</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> upwardly accelerating shock waves from the impact accelerated charged particles enough to cause auroral emission, a phenomenon more typically associated with fast-moving solar wind particles striking a planetary atmosphere near a magnetic pole.|$|R
25|$|All {{of these}} points may be partly correct in themselves, but they leave {{unanswered}} {{the question of}} why Beck acted like he did. A <b>possible</b> <b>explanation</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> he needed to repair his reputation: He was a politician and had during the First War of Schleswig 15 years earlier been passed over for promotion for criticism by Colonel Læssøe, and would probably suffer the same again, for in February during the battle of Sankelmark he left his unit while it was in battle.|$|E
25|$|Possible {{challenges}} to this theory emerged recently, {{with the discovery}} of two nearby long gamma-ray bursts that lacked the signature of any type of supernova: both GRB060614 and GRB 060505 defied predictions that a supernova would emerge despite intense scrutiny from ground-based telescopes. Both events were, however, associated with actively star-forming stellar populations. One <b>possible</b> <b>explanation</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> during the core collapse of a very massive star a black hole can form, which then 'swallows' the entire star before the supernova blast can reach the surface.|$|E
25|$|It {{is unclear}} why several nations with few female workers {{have such a}} high {{percentage}} of salaried women. One <b>possible</b> <b>explanation</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> so few women are active in the labor market because the demand for female employment is restricted to a few higher-paying, low-labor-intensive industries. If only a few women are needed but they need to have above-average skills, then these laborers' marginal value may necessitate salary as opposed to simple wages.
