40|$|Abstract. We {{design a}} new two-sided {{coupling}} channel drop filter (CDF) {{based on a}} two-dimensional (2 D) photonic crystal (PC). Three channels formed by line defects for light propagation, two L 4 resonators <b>positioned</b> <b>at</b> <b>both</b> <b>sides</b> of the input waveguide for light coupling, and one point defect micro-cavity in the bus waveguide for wavelength-selective reflection are introduced into the PC structure. The optical characteristics of this proposed structure are calculated by finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method combined with the perfectly matched layers (PMLs) as the boundary conditions. Three wavelengths centered at 1550, 1575 and 1610 nm within the limit of communication windows are successfully separated in three channels by adjusting the size of coupling rods and the positions of L 4 resonators and micro-cavity. High transmission efficiency and more than 20 nm channel spacing are achieved. These demonstrate that our proposed structure is suitable for photonic integrated circuits (PICs) and coarse wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) optical communication systems...|$|E
40|$|The {{review article}} {{provides}} a methodical approach for understanding membraneless laminar flow-based fuel cells (LFFCs), {{also known as}} microfluidic fuel cells. Membraneless LFFCs benefit from the lamination of multiple streams in a microchannel. The lack of convective mixing leads to a well-defined liquid-liquid interface. Usually, anode and cathode are <b>positioned</b> <b>at</b> <b>both</b> <b>sides</b> of the interface. The liquid-liquid interface is considered as a virtual membrane and ions can travel across the channel to reach {{the other side and}} complete the ionic conduction. The advantage of membraneless LFFC is the lack of a physical membrane and the related issues of membrane conditioning can be eliminated or becomes less important. Based on the electrode architectures, membraneless LFFCs in the literature can be categorized into three main types: flow-over design with planar electrodes, flow-through design with three-dimensional porous electrodes, and membraneless LFFCs with air-breathing cathode. Since this paper focuses on reviewing the design considerations of membraneless LFFCs, a concept map is provided for understanding the cross-related problems. The impacts of flow and electrode architecture on cell performance and fuel utilization are discussed. In addition, the main challenges and key issues for further development of membraneless LFFCs are discussed. Full Tex...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of a selection of my published work from 1989 - 2015, accompanied by an essay and a bibliography. The essay looks at {{the ways in which}} I am drawn towards marginal and liminal zones within fiction, including the areas between Young Adult (YA) and Adult fiction, crime fiction and literary fiction, and that between depicting reality and fictionalising it. I also consider the use of narrative mode in defining these liminal areas. By 'liminal', I mean occupying a <b>position</b> <b>at,</b> or on <b>both</b> <b>sides</b> of a boundary or threshold, rather than the word's other, looser sense, where it means 'vague'. The examples of fiction selected are intended to display the range of my published work since joining Nottingham Trent University. The order in which the pieces are discussed is broadly chronological. There is an introductory section about and brief examples of my work prior to 2002. While the work selected has been chosen primarily to be representative of my published work, they also illustrate the liminal and marginal zones referred to above. The majority of the extracts and stories that follow are taken from those published during the thirteen years I have worked at Nottingham Trent University. The texts used are taken from the published versions. Consequently the editorial conventions applied to chapter headings, double or single speech marks et al. are not consistent. While I have endeavoured to correct typographical errors that appeared in the original publications, I have not attempted to improve the style...|$|R

40|$|Lim·i·nal -ˈlimənl/ -adjective 1. of or {{relating}} to a transitional or initial {{stage of a}} process. 2. occupying a <b>position</b> <b>at,</b> or on <b>both</b> <b>sides</b> of, a boundary or threshold. from the Latin word līmen, meaning 2 ̆ 2 a threshold 2 ̆ 2 I often think about the different roles that I play within my own life, {{as well as the}} roles other people occupy. My own roles include a daughter, sister, aunt, friend, student, employee, artist, etc. At any given moment, I must be ready to change from 2 ̆ 2 Aunt Mariah 2 ̆ 2 to 2 ̆ 2 Mariah Kuta – Employee 2 ̆ 2. Or from 2 ̆ 2 At-home Mariah 2 ̆ 2 to 2 ̆ 2 At-school Mariah 2 ̆ 2. These are sides of myself that possess different vocabularies and mannerisms. We all possess these subtle changes to our posture and behavior depending on where we are and whom we are with. We are constantly in a state of transition between these roles and social circles and we pass through these liminal spaces and into the appropriate role without really thinking about it. But, who are we when we occupy that liminal space? Do we base our identity on who we are to other people? The state of liminality by itself can be ambiguous and disorienting, but I also believe that a kind of peace can be found in that space. My works are made to bring attention to our own liminal spaces and raise the question of who we really are in that middle ground. I want to bring focus to the Venn diagram that makes us who we are. There is a repetition of circles and overlapping images that represent colorful portals of activity and duty, while the black and white voids are the spaces that have not yet been designated. The various hints of injury come from the feelings of dissociation and disjointment that are effects from the state of liminality that wound our sense of comfort and stability. The contusions mimic the colors of the portals. Crystals are also a recurring theme as I see them as organic, multifaceted dimensions within themselves. They are small, but they hold a great depth and many possibilities for growth. The crystals represent us, as we are also composed of multiple sides, features, characteristics, and are forever changing and growing. I draw inspiration from the watercolor quality, use of circles, and themes present in the artwork of Kelly McKernan. Mandie Manzano 2 ̆ 7 s use of color and movement are striking elements that I keep in mind when choosing the colors for my own works and how those colors will blend and interact with each other. James Jean 2 ̆ 7 s work possess an elegant and sometimes dark nature that is comforting and holds my attention to all parts of the piece. His line and color quality are strong elements of inspiration. I use the components from these artists that appeal to me to make decisions in my own work. Much like my inspirations, I aim to pose a question for the viewers and invite them to meditate on it while they observe my work. -Mariah Kuta[URL]...|$|R
