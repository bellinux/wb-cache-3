Subsequently, the SPA methodology is introduced in detail and its application discussed. In the methodology, the first <b>procedural</b> <b>step</b> consists of identifying a number of macro-factorial—key drivers—trends and challenges determining changes that in the medium/long term can be deemed significant to the design of global logistics systems and networks. Secondly, key drivers are combined to construct one or more scenarios. More rigorously, a scenario can be defined in terms of a probable combination of some or all the drivers [2936].|$|R

This is important when an event becomes extreme and no time is available to start and conclude each step before getting to the proper emergency phase. A log file registers all the executed actions, the operator in charge and the time and date of each action. This log file plays a crucial role: in the training phase, to measure the response capacity to different hazard types and, if needed, to check and modify the formalized procedures; to carry out back analysis (identify lessons learned from past events or simulations); and to control, verify, and validate the consistency of each <b>procedural</b> <b>step.</b>|$|R

We identify a mathematical action called "pulling out" as a procedural resource to help students with separating the time part from the space part of the wave function in the course of solving the time-dependent Schrodinger equation.

40|$|In 1991 a tower {{controller}} at Los Angeles International airport {{cleared a}} commuter aircraft to position {{and hold on}} runway 24 L while she worked to clear other aircraft to cross {{the other end of}} the runway. There were several communications delays because one of the other aircraft was on the wrong radio frequency. Visibility was poor at twilight because of haze and glare. The controller’s workload was considered moderate by air traffic controllers, though laypeople might consider it quite busy. The controller forgot to clear the commuter aircraft to take off and cleared another aircraft to land on 24 L, which it did, destroying both aircraft and killing 34 people. Similar errors by pilots have also led to major accidents. In 1994 an airliner ran off the runway at LaGuardia airport after the crew rejected the takeoff at high-speed because they observed anomalous indications on their airspeed indicators. The NTSB determined that the anomalous indications occurred because the crew failed to turn on the pitot heat, a normal <b>procedural</b> <b>step,</b> that keeps the pitot input to the airspeed indicators from freezing in cold, wet weather. Two previous major airline accidents occurred in the 1980 ’s when the crews forgot to extend wing flaps and slats to takeoff position, a normal <b>procedural</b> <b>step</b> required before takeoff. More recently, in 1996, an airliner landed gear-up in Houston when the landing gear failed to extend because the crew forgot to set the hydraulic pumps to the high position, which was part of the normal procedure for preparing their type of aircraft for landing. Obviously multiple factors were at play in each of these accidents, but a central aspect of each accident was the failure of the cre...|$|R

Side branch predilation, a <b>procedural</b> <b>step</b> that is typically avoided, {{may be required to}} maintain side branch patency. The impact of side branch predilation on the immediate results of percutaneous coronary intervention in complex coronary bifurcation lesions was investigated. MethodsBetween May, 2008 and August, 2009, 59 patients with single coronary bifurcation lesions and significant involvement of the main and side branches were included in the study. The main exclusion criteria were the involvement of the left main coronary artery, ST-elevation acute myocardial infarction (87. 6 % was identified as the most accurate cut-off value to predict failure in the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve.

50|$|The {{nature of}} {{setbacks}} can vary considerably. For example, a minor setback {{might result from}} a minor injury. Larger setbacks include the lack of knowledge that a certain <b>procedural</b> <b>step</b> or other condition is necessary for a project's success: If one attempts to keep working {{despite the lack of}} knowledge that this obstacle exists (let alone how to deal with it), one's lack of progress may prompt one to take long breaks from the project, to focus one's attention on other endeavors, or even to lose interest in the project altogether. Pirsig suggests preventing these kinds of gumption traps by being slow and meticulous, taking notes that might help later, and troubleshooting in advance (e.g., by laying out the requirements for one's project in logical and/or conceptual order and looking for procedural problems ranging from unaccounted-for prerequisites to gaps in one's instructions or plans).|$|R
