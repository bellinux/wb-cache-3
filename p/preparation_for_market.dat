Particular emphasis was placed on the development of high fat cream and fat-filled powders, flavour-delivery systems and protein-enriched ingredients. The major achievement of this project is that it is now possible to confidently select the appropriate processing conditions during the spray drying of ingredients in order to attain desired end-product specifications. Based {{on the use of the}} newly-installed Tall-form drier, the project succeeded in correlating the effects of process parameters of this technicallyadvanced pilot plant with the physicochemical properties of powders containing varying fat (20 - 80 %) and protein contents. In general, the physicochemical characteristics of fat-filled and cream-filled powders with similar fat contents were similar except for higher solubility index values (range 0. 1 - 0. 6) in the case of the former particularly in the range 26 - 28 % fat.

Burley tobacco production required large amounts of hand labor with minimum mechanization. Both the availability and cost of intensive hand labor required at peak seasons began forcing many producers to seek labor-saving tech niques. About one-half of the labor required {{for the production of}} burley tobacco prior to the late 1970 s involved stripping and <b>preparation</b> <b>for</b> <b>market.</b> Leaves of air cured burley tobacco were removed from the stalk, held in an oriented fashion and tied with a wrapper leaf into "hands " or bundles. Studies indicated that considerable farm and warehouse labor and time might be saved if burley tobaGco could be successf ully marketed in an untied or loose-leaf form. Flue-cured tobacco was marketed in a loose-leaf, unoriented manner, packaged in a burlap sheet. Canadian and other types of tobacco were packaged and marketed in a compressed bale. lnterest by many producers in loose-leaf methods for packaging and handing burley tobacco coincided with this increased interest. Further information was gained from various experiments on labor requirements for packaging by conventional and loose-leaf methods, on moisture variables in the loose-leaf package, and on the technical and mechanical aspects of loose-leaf handling. These studies and experiments by industry and public agencies led to the approval of unlimited sale of baled burley by the Secretary of Agriculture beginning in the 1981 - 82 marketing year. Widespread adoption of the bale method has been made by producers and the industry since that time.

40|$|This {{item was}} {{digitized}} by the Internet Archive. Thesis (M. A.) [...] Boston UniversityThe {{purpose of this}} thesis has been to present the economically important tree crops of the different climatic {{regions of the world}} in order to show man's present dependence upon them for his welfare and comfort. The tree crops taken under consideration consisted of fruits, nuts, beans, berries, flower buds, seeds, leaves, bark, latex, and juices of trees which grow in native forests and in a cultivated state in plantations and orchards. The geographical basis chosen for this study was climate, since climate is fundamentally responsible for the geographical distribution of trees. The climatic regions were analyzed as to the conditions favorable for the growth of crop-yielding trees; then within each climatic region the tree crops have been presented under headings indicative of man's major use of them: beverages, dyes and pigments, drugs and medicinal products, fibers, fruits, gums and resins, latex products, masticatories, oils and waxes, spices and flavoring materials, tree legumes and edible nuts, sugar and starches, tanning materials, and miscellaneous. Each tree crop is discussed as to geographical distribution, geographic factors underlying its production, its culture and <b>preparation</b> <b>for</b> <b>market,</b> and its economic importance. A number of geographic factors combine to determine the distribution and production of tree crops, economic, physiographic, political, and climatic factors. The economic factors influencing tree crop production are supply and demand, labor, and the time factors of gestation period, age commercial bearing begins, and the duration of yield. Physiographic factors which may restrict the localities of tree crop production are location—-in respect to land and sea, in respect to main trade routes, in respect to the labor supply—-soil, and topography. Existing political conditions may either foster or restrict tree crop production in a region despite the fact that climate favors its distribution there. Climatic factors fundamentally responsible for the distribution of tree crops include rainfall and humidity, temperature, wind, and sunlight. Of all the geographical factors, climate more than any other determines the possible areas where the tree crop may be produced; but the actual economic exploitation and production may be further limited by economic, physiographic, and political factors. Therefore, in this geographic study of tree crops the basis of subdivision is climate. Of all the climatic regions of the world three are conspicuous by the total absence of tree crops, [...] the Polar Continental, the Subpolar, and the Polar Ice Cap climates. In each of these three temperature is the forbidding factor in tree growth, In all other climatic regions tree crops are present in varying numbers, depending on the combination of temperature, rainfall and humidity, wind, and sunlight. Regions {{under the influence of the}} Tropical Rainy climate are the richest in crop-yielding trees. In general, optimum atmospheric conditions of temperature and rainfall exist in this climatic regime for the growth of trees and tree crops. Every major type of tree crop is to be found in this climate; numerous varieties of each type contribute to the length of the list. Many of these tree crops come directly from the tropical rainforests; others are cultivated on plantations or native farms. The Monsoon Tropical (Tropical Savanna) climate has only seven tree crops of commercial importance since the number and species of trees possible in this climatic type are limited to those which are adapted in response to the distinct rainy and pronounced dry seasons which exist there. There is but one tree crop of prominence in the Cool Tropical Highland climate-—coffee. Though certain temperate fruits can be grown in regions having this climate, they are not of economic importance since their quality is poor due to the lack of influence of winter conditions which are needed in order for them to do their best. Since the Semi-arid Tropical regions are lands of scanty rain which occurs only from one to three months of the year, few trees are able to exist there. Only five tree crops typical of this climate have attained commercial importance. One tree crop-—the date-—is representative of oases in the Arid Tropical regions of the world. The Arid Tropical climate is unfavorable to tree growth except where underground sources of water are available to make their growth possible in oases. Though other tree fruits, as pomegranate, apricot, olives, and even peach, may be found along with dates in this climatic type, they are only of minor importance here, having been introduced from the subtropical regions. The date is the dominant tree in the oases of tropical deserts and is "king of tree crops" there. The Humid Subtropical climate is an important contributor of tree crop products. The prevailing climatic conditions of abundant rainfall, somewhat evenly distributed throughout the year, and moderate temperatures favor the growth of a wide variety of trees and so furnish man with a large number and variety of tree crops. Regions under the influence of the Mediterranean Subtropical climate are rich in the number and variety of economically important tree crops which they produce. Those found within this climate are mainly of two types: the dry land type—-those which are native to this climatic regime and so are naturally adapted to the prevailing summer drought of the environment; and the intensive irrigated type—-those moisture-loving crops which have been introduced here from humid regions. Climatic conditions are adverse to tree growth in regions having a Dry Subtropical climate; but because of their adaptability to arid and semi-arid conditions such as exist in regions under the influence of this climate two tree crops—-mesquite and piñon nuts—-are to be found. The two Humid Continental climates—-the Long Summer Phase and Short Summer Phase—-are similar in all climatic aspects with one exception—-their length of summers. Therefore, the kind of trees and, naturally, the kind of tree crops in both are for the most part the same. Both of these climactic types are rich in the number of crop-yielding trees which exist within their bounds and provide man with a large variety of tree crops. The Marine West-Coast climate is not a large contributor of commercially important tree crops. Though the vegetation of regions having this climate is or has been essentially one of heavy forest growth, only three tree crops of any note are derived directly from this source. This type of climate with its rainy, cloudy, cool weather, and its continually moist soils is not favorable for maturing and harvesting fruit crops; therefore, only a few of the hardier tree fruits are grown in any appreciable quantities. The variety of tree crops and the many uses for which they are employed are more extensive than the average person realizes. From a study of this thesis it may be concluded that tree crops constitute a basic part of man's daily life. Without them he would bo deprived of a great variety of products which add to his welfare and comfort. [URL]...|$|E

40|$|In {{the past}} decade or so there has been {{emphasis}} on increase in agriculture production in Ghana while ignoring the fact that the extra production may not reach the consumer because of marketing and distribution problems the alleged inefficient way in which intermediaries (private) tend to handle produce. To overcome this problem, corporations like the Ghana Food Distribution and the Grains Board were set up as corporations under the Ministry of Agriculture. The principle objectives of the above-named corporations to keep down the prices of basic foodstuffs and ensuring their regular supply are far from realisation. We cannot simply argue that even though agricultural output has increased the drastic cut in imports of agricultural produce and products from abroad causes prices of commodities to increase. We can only say that if total production of produce has in fact increased by 30 % as is maintained in certain circles, this should offset the cut in imports since the relative increase in domestic production is higher than the relative decrease in imports. Ceteris paribus the relative prices of produce should be on the downward trend. The inefficient way in which the main government food distribution organisation goes about its marketing has much to do with this. For one thing, there has not been adequate <b>preparation</b> <b>for</b> <b>marketing</b> the relative increase in food production. Suggested improvements in the organisational set-up of the corporation have so far ended up in the lockers of some officials without any follow-up. This is partly due to over-centralisation at the national headquarters of the corporation and the constant counter-measures of the Ministry of Agriculture under rwhich this corporation falls. A relative-increase in produce which-may not actually benefit-agroallied processing industries or final consumerscl-early calls for a systematic study of human and non-human factors which influence the smooth flow of commodities. There is often total confusion (due to lack of basic marketing information) among government or non-government agencies as to what really constitutes the marketing problem. All the information which is systematically available on marketing are the wholesale and retail price information given by the Ministry of Agriculture's Economic and Marketing-Divisions. Further, systematic information on the basic structure or types of intermediaries who operate within the market is not available. As has been recently pointed out - while some maintain that transportation is the main bottleneck, others believe that the main impediment is the system of private intermediaries.

50|$|Of Brittany, Mrs. Lionel Birch wrote:In {{that most}} {{beautiful}} and interesting portion of France, {{there seemed to}} be found everything that an artist could desire. Inhabited by a race of a distinct and marked type, wearing still the beautiful national costumes which had been handed down from bygone ages, and retaining the old language of their forefathers, each village followed religiously the old traditions which ordered the fashion of their dress and the conduct of their lives. Here was a country dear to all who love that which is old and quaint, time-honoured, and reminiscent of past ages.A painting made there, A Street in Brittany, was shown and well received at the 1882 Royal Academy exhibition and sold later that year to the Walker Art Gallery in Liverpool. During an 1883 trip to Brittany, Forbes stayed at Quimperlé. His Breton Children in an Orchard - Quimperlé, was shown at the 1884 Royal Hibernian Academy. Two other works were made Fair Measures: a shop in Quimperlé and <b>Preparations</b> <b>for</b> the <b>Market,</b> Quimperlé; They were both shown at the Royal Academy in 1884. True to his degree of satisfaction, the Fair Measures painting was well-received and the Market painting was found to be too blue and shadowless. Since blue was the colour of the Breton costumes, Forbes decided that it might be useful to change locations for a broader range of subjects and colours.Other artists who were painting in Brittany {{at the time of his}} visits, and who Forbes may have met, were Norman Garstin, Nathaniel Hill, Joseph Malachy Kavanagh and Walter Osborne.|$|R
