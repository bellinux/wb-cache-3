Under her crape borders showed the smoothest of hair, and her apron was spotlessly white. The two little girls were patterns, with short cut hair, spotted blue frocks and checkered pinafores in the week, lilac frocks on Sundays; white capes on that same day, and bonnets of coarse straw, tied down with green ribbon, over little bonnet caps with <b>plain</b> <b>net</b> frilling, the only attempt at luxury apparent in their dress. Their names were Jane and Mary, and they looked very pretty and demure, though there was a little mischief in Mary's eyes. Nothing could look nicer or more promising {{in the eyes of the}} sisters when they took her to her cottage, nor could any one be better pleased than she to work under her own young ladies, and to have so peaceful a home for her little daughters.

6000|$|The same quick {{perception}} of dangers {{to be avoided}} and difficulties to be overcome which had warned her to leave the extravagant part of her character costume in the box at Birmingham now kept her mind fully alive to the vast difference between a disguise worn by gas-light for the amusement of an audience and a disguise assumed by daylight to deceive the searching eyes of two strangers. The first article of dress which she put on was an old gown of her own (made of the material called [...] "alpaca"), of a dark-brown color, with a neat pattern of little star-shaped spots in white. A double flounce running round {{the bottom of this}} dress was the only milliner's ornament which it presented--an ornament not at all out of character with the costume appropriated to an elderly lady. The disguise of her head and face was the next object of her attention. She fitted and arranged the gray wig with the dexterity which constant practice had given her; fixed the false eyebrows (made rather large, and of hair darker than the wig) carefully in their position with the gum she had with her for the purpose, and stained her face with the customary stage materials, so as to change the transparent fairness of her complexion to the dull, faintly opaque color of a woman in ill health. The lines and markings of age followed next; and here the first obstacles presented themselves. The art which succeeded by gas-light failed by day: the difficulty of hiding the plainly artificial nature of the marks was almost insuperable. She turned to her trunk; took from it two veils; and putting on her old-fashioned bonnet, tried the effect of them in succession. One of the veils (of black lace) was too thick to be worn over the face at that summer season without exciting remark. The other, of <b>plain</b> <b>net,</b> allowed her features to be seen through it, just indistinctly enough to permit the safe introduction of certain lines (many fewer than she was accustomed to use in performing the character) on the forehead and at the sides of the mouth. But the obstacle thus set aside only opened the way to a new difficulty--the difficulty of keeping her veil down while she was speaking to other persons, without any obvious reason for doing so. An instant's consideration, and a chance look at her little china palette of stage colors, suggested to her ready invention the production of a visible excuse for wearing her veil. She deliberately disfigured herself by artificially reddening the insides of her eyelids so as to produce an appearance of inflammation which no human creature but a doctor--and that doctor at close quarters--could have detected as false. She sprang to her feet and looked triumphantly at the hideous transformation of herself reflected in the glass. Who could think it strange now if she wore her veil down, and if she begged Mrs. Lecount's permission to sit {{with her back to the}} light? ...|$|E

40|$|We {{introduce}} ω-Petri nets (ωPN), {{an extension}} of <b>plain</b> Petri <b>nets</b> with ω-labeled input and output arcs, that is well-suited to analyse parametric concurrent systems with dynamic thread creation. Most techniques (such as the Karp and Miller tree or the Rackoff technique) that have been proposed {{in the setting of}} <b>plain</b> Petri <b>nets</b> do not apply directly to ωPN because ωPN define transition systems that have infinite branching. This motivates a thorough analysis of the computational aspects of ωPN. We show that an ωPN can be turned into a <b>plain</b> Petri <b>net</b> that allows us to recover the reachability set of the ωPN, but that does not preserve termination (an ωPN terminates iff it admits no infinitely long execution). This yields complexity bounds for the reachability, boundedness, place boundedness and coverability problems on ωPN. We provide a practical algorithm to compute a coverability set of the ωPN and to decide termination by adapting the classical Karp and Miller tree construction. We also adapt the Rackoff technique to ωPN, to obtain the exact complexity of the termination problem. Finally, we consider the extension of ωPN with reset and transfer arcs, and show how this extension impacts the decidability and complexity of the aforementioned problems. IOS Press.

50|$|In 1764, a {{profound}} change {{was made to}} the stocking frame that enabled it to produce weft-knitted nets. Hammond, the attributed inventor, used ticklers to stitch-transfer from one needle to the third one along crossing over two intermediate needles creating a cross stitch. He also used a tickler to move two stitches two to the right, and then two to the left in a double cross stitch, Valenciennes lace. To do this the tickler bar was detached from the frame and attached to 'dogs', that is, jointed arms. This allowed forward motion to scoop, and sideways motion to shog. New inventions were patented: Frost's tickler net of 1769, the two <b>plain</b> <b>net</b> of 1777 and the square net of 1781, and their patents were fiercely defended.

To allow for an inductive definition of concurrency, missing in the original proposal and essential for an efficient unfolding procedure, the key intuition is to associate histories not only with events, but also with places.

40|$|Petri nets {{efficiently}} model both data- and control-flow. Control-flow {{is either}} modeled explicitly as flow {{of a specific}} kind of data, or implicit based on the data-flow. Explicit modeling of control-flow is useful for well-known and highly structured processes, but may make modeling of abstract features of models, or processes which are highly dynamic, overly complex. Declarative modeling, such as is supported by Declare and DCR graphs, focus on control-flow, but does not specify it explicitly; instead specifications {{come in the form}} of constraints on the order or appearance of tasks. In this paper we propose a combination of the two, using colored Petri <b>nets</b> instead of <b>plain</b> Petri <b>nets</b> to provide full data support. The combined approach makes it possible to add a focus on data to declarative languages, and to remove focus from the explicit control-flow from Petri nets for dynamic or abstract processes. In addition to enriching both procedural processes in the form of Petri nets and declarative processes, we also support a flow from modeling only abstract data- and control-flow of a model towards a more explicit control-flow model if so desired. We define our combined approach, and provide considerations necessary for enactment. Our approach has been implemented in CPN Tools 4...|$|R

In this study, the individual behaviour of Atlantic cod Gadus morhua to inspect and bite the net was investigated in 4 replicate multi-patch experiments, using underwater video techniques and behavioural event recording. The experimental system included a tank enclosure where cod were presented with 6 separate net panels: duplicate pairs of <b>plain</b> control <b>nets</b> and 2 different treatment panels. Four holes {{were made in the}} treatment panels, 3 of which were mended with different repair techniques including short and loose thread ends and contrasting colour repair threads. Behavioural effects of feed stimulants were studied before, during and after a feed source was placed outside the net. The cod inspected and bit the net systematically, significantly focusing on loose threads or minor damage on the net, and the fish were capable of causing severe net damage within a few days. The observed behaviours were related to hunger level and feed stimulation, and increased significantly during times when a feed source was present outside the net wall. Few bites were observed, and almost no measureable damage was recorded to plain control panels and the area around unrepaired holes during the treatment. Repairs made with white and black threads, and loose, long ends were significantly more damaged than repairs made with short thread ends and threads of similar colour as the net. The experiments demonstrated how a behavioural approach might be used in interpretation of a practical problem in aquaculture, and the results will be useful in the development of technology and escape mitigation strategies.

Neither of them had seen her save by the dim light of a single lamp, and even then she had been wrapped in a long {{traveling}} coat; and so, although Lord St. Maurice had called her beautiful, they were neither of them prepared to see her quite as she was. She wore a <b>plain</b> black <b>net</b> dinner gown, curving only slightly downward at the white throat, the somberness of which was partially relieved by an amber foundation. She had no jewelry of any sort, nor any flowers, and she carried only a tiny lace handkerchief in her left hand. But she had no need of a toilet or of adornment. That proud, exquisitely graceful carriage, which only race can give, was the dowry of her descent from one of the ancient families of Southern Europe; but the beauty of her face was nature's gift alone. It was beauty of the best and purest French type--the beauty of the aristocrats of the court of Louis the Fourteenth. The luxurious black hair was parted in the middle, and raised slightly over the temples, showing a high but delicately arched forehead. Her complexion was dazzling in its purity, but colorless. There was none of the harshness of the Sicilian type in her features, or in the lines of her figure. The severest critic of feminine beauty could have asked only for a slightly relaxed mouth, and a touch of humanity in her dark, still eyes; and even he, knowing that the great joys of womanhood--the joys of loving and being loved--were as yet untasted by her, would have held his peace, murmuring, perhaps, that the days of miracles were not yet passed, and a daughter of Diana had appeared upon the earth.|$|R

The results showed that the Great <b>Plains</b> was a <b>net</b> sink with an averaged annual NEP of 24 ± 14 g C m− 2 yr− 1, ranging from a low value of 0. 3 g C m− 2 yr− 1 in 2002 to a high value of 47. 7 g C m− 2 yr− 1 in 2005. The regional averaged NEP for the entire Great Plains grasslands was estimated to be 336 Tg C yr− 1 from 2000 to 2008. In the 9 year period including 4 dry years, the annual NEP was very variable in both space and time. It appeared that the carbon gains for the Great Plains were more sensitive to droughts in the west than the east. The droughts in 2000, 2002, 2006, and 2008 resulted in increased carbon losses over drought‐affected areas, and the Great Plains grasslands turned into a relatively low sink with NEP values of 15. 8, 0. 3, 20. 1, and 10. 2 g C m− 2 yr− 1 for the 4 years, respectively...|$|R
40|$|To {{improve the}} {{understandings}} on regional climatic effects of past human-induced land cover changes, the surface albedo changes caused by conversions from natural vegetation to cropland were estimated across northeastern China {{over the last}} 300 years, and its climatic effects were simulated by using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. Essential natural vegetation records compiled from historical documents and regional optimal surface albedo dataset were used. The {{results show that the}} surface albedo decreased by 0. 01 - 0. 03 due to conversions from grassland to cropland in the Northeast China Plain and it increased by 0. 005 - 0. 015 due to conversions from forests to cropland in the surrounding mountains. As a consequence, in the Northeast China <b>Plain,</b> the surface <b>net</b> radiation increased by 4 - 8 W/m(2), 2 - 5 W/m(2), and 1 - 3 W/m(2), and the climate was therefore warmed by 0. 1 degrees C- 0. 2 degrees C, 0. 1 degrees C- 0. 2 degrees C, 0. 1 degrees C- 0. 3 degrees C in the spring, autumn and winter, respectively. In the surrounding mountain area, the net radiation decreased by less than 1. 5 W/m(2), and the climate was therefore cooled too slight to be detected. In summer, effects of surface albedo changes on climate were closely associated with moisture dynamics, such as evapotranspiration and cloud, instead of being merely determined by surface radiation budget. The simulated summer climatic effects have large uncertainties. These findings demonstrate that surface albedo changes resulted in warming climate effects in the non-rainy seasons in Northeast China Plain through surface radiation processes while the climatic effects in summer could hardly be concluded so far...|$|R
50|$|After World War II, various {{styles of}} {{camouflage}} cover were used at different times. In the 1960s through 1970s, the type commonly {{seen in the}} United States Army and Marine Corps was a reversible fabric cover called the Mitchell Pattern, with a leafy green pattern {{on one side and}} orange cloud pattern on the other. This type was nearly omnipresent in Vietnam, and where, for the first time, the army wore the cloth camouflage as general issue; whereas in World War II and the Korean War, the army traditionally wore their helmets only with <b>nets,</b> <b>plain</b> without anything on it, or with field-made, non-issue covers without camouflage. By contrast, United States Marines have consistently worn a cloth camouflage cover over their M-1 helmets in all three major wars—World War II, Korea, and Vietnam. The Korean War (1950-1953) was largely fought using World War II weapons and equipment, and the Marine Corps helmets and camouflage covers were basically the same as those used during World War II. In Vietnam, the green portion of the reversible fabric camouflage was normally worn outermost. Helmet covers in the (European) woodland camouflage, were designed for fighting in the European Theater of Operations (NATO), and became the post-Vietnam (jungle pattern) camouflage cover used by the U.S. military from the late 1970s onward. The (European) Woodland pattern was not reversible; they were only printed on one side, though some rare desert camouflage examples do exist. These covers were all constructed from two semi-circular pieces of cloth stitched together to form a dome-like shape conforming to the helmet's shape. They were secured to the helmet by folding their open ends into the steel pot, and then placing the liner inside, trapping the cloth between the pot and the liner. An olive green elastic band, intended to hold additional camouflage materials, was often worn around the helmet to further hold the cover in place.|$|R
