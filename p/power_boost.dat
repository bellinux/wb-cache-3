40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we present}} a noise {{robustness}} algorithm called Small <b>Power</b> <b>Boosting</b> (SPB). We observe that in the spectral domain, time-frequency bins with smaller power are more affected by additive noise. The conventional way of handling this problem is estimating the noise from the test utterance and doing normalization or subtraction. In our work, in contrast, we intentionally <b>boost</b> the <b>power</b> of time-frequency bins with small energy for both the training and testing datasets. Since timefrequency bins with small power no longer exist after this <b>power</b> <b>boosting,</b> the spectral distortion between the clean and corrupt test sets becomes reduced. This type of small <b>power</b> <b>boosting</b> is also highly related to physiological nonlinearity. We observe that when small <b>power</b> <b>boosting</b> is done, suitable weighting smoothing becomes highly important. Our experimental results indicate that this simple idea is very helpful for very difficult noisy environments such as corruption by background music.

500|$|Players {{dispatch}} enemies {{by either}} thrusting {{at them with}} his Dragon Sword or by defeating them using <b>Power</b> <b>Boosting</b> Items. These special items consume Ryu's [...] "ninja power", also located {{on the top of}} the screen. <b>Power</b> <b>Boosting</b> Items include the following: shurikens; [...] "Windmill Throwing Stars" [...] that move back and forth like a boomerang; [...] "The Art of the Fire Wheel" [...] which hurls fireballs diagonally upwards; [...] "Fire Dragon Balls" [...] which hurls fireballs diagonally downwards; and the [...] "Invincible Fire Wheel" [...] that creates a barrier of three fireballs around Ryu, destroying any enemy that touches them. These items can be found in various crystal balls scattered throughout the levels, and they can be switched out by collecting another <b>Power</b> <b>Boosting</b> Item. The amount of ninja power used depends on the type of <b>Power</b> <b>Boosting</b> Item used.

5|$|Hartley {{explained}} that Arthur would {{be aware of}} his powers {{at the beginning of}} the series and would have no problem using them for personal gain. Hartley felt this played against the typical superheroes, because his character was not afraid to flaunt his abilities. Gough explained A.C. would be able to swim faster than humans, breathe underwater, as well as have super strength while underwater. He also stated that exposure to water on land would give him powers. The extent of his speed is shown in the pilot, when Arthur is able to keep up with a fighter jet flying above him. The extent of A.C.'s ability to breathe underwater was not elaborated upon, but he is seen swimming near the bottom of the ocean near the start of the pilot. When A.C. is talking to Eva about releasing captive dolphins, he tells her that he felt as though the dolphins were somehow calling to him. In the comics, one of Aquaman's powers is the ability to communicate with sea life. Gough likened A.C.'s not having access to water to Clark's growing weak around kryptonite in Smallville – if A.C. does not get water, he will dehydrate and weaken. Water gives him a <b>power</b> <b>boost</b> and enables producers to explore stories on land.|$|E
500|$|Changes in the {{relative}} values of the Australian dollar and Japanese yen made it financially impractical {{to continue with the}} well-regarded Nissan engine of the VL. Instead, Holden manufactured their own 3.8-litre V6 engine based on a Buick design, adapted from FWD to RWD. The 5.0-litre V8 remained optional and received a <b>power</b> <b>boost</b> to [...] courtesy of multi-point fuel injection. Although not known for its refinement, the new V6 was nevertheless praised for its performance and fuel efficiency at the time. A 2.0-litre Family II engine was also offered for some export markets including New Zealand and Singapore where it was sold as the Holden Berlina. Accompanying the changes to engines, the VL's four-speed automatic transmission was replaced by the Turbo-Hydramatic and a Borg-Warner five-speed manual.

500|$|Final Fantasy Type-0 is {{an action}} {{role-playing}} video {{game in which}} the player controls the 14 members of Class Zero, who are sent on missions across Orience. Outside environments such as the Vermillion Peristylium (Class Zero's home base) and dedicated missions, the game world of Orience is navigated via a scaled-down world map. Class Zero are sent on missions across Orience {{during the course of}} the game. The player initially travels to preset destinations in the world on an airship supplied by the Peristylium, but gains their own airship to freely navigate the world map with after defeating a powerful enemy guarding it. The main gameplay is presented in a mission-based structure. The two types of missions encountered are story-based missions, and [...] "Practice" [...] missions, which act as side-quests. During missions, optional orders are issued which can be obeyed or ignored as the player chooses. Should they be accepted, the characters receive a temporary <b>power</b> <b>boost,</b> and completing the objectives yields rewards. Players can also engage in real-time strategy battles on the world map, with the player taking control of allied military divisions. Missions involve liberating cities and towns from enemy forces. Timed aerial missions are also available where the characters shoot down attacking dragons using their airship's weapons.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the problem of}} automatic characterization and detection of target images in a rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) task based on EEG data. A novel method that aims to identify single-trial event-related potentials (ERPs) in time-frequency is proposed, and a robust classifier with feature clustering is developed to better utilize the correlated ERP features. The method is applied to EEG recordings of a RSVP experiment with multiple sessions and subjects. The {{results show that the}} target image events are mainly characterized by 3 distinct patterns in the time-frequency domain, i. e., a theta band (4. 3 Hz) <b>power</b> <b>boosting</b> 300 – 700 ms after the target image onset, an alpha band (12 Hz) <b>power</b> <b>boosting</b> 500 – 1000 ms after the stimulus onset, and a delta band (2 Hz) <b>power</b> <b>boosting</b> after 500 ms. The most discriminant time-frequency features are <b>power</b> <b>boosting</b> and are relatively consistent among multiple sessions and subjects. Since the original discriminant time-frequency features are highly correlated, we constructed the uncorrelated features using hierarchical clustering for better classification of target and non-target images. With feature clustering, performance (area under ROC) improved from 0. 85 to 0. 89 on within-session tests, and from 0. 76 to 0. 84 on cross-subject tests. The constructed uncorrelated features were more robust than the original discriminant features and corresponded to a numbe...|$|R
