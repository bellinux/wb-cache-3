5|$|Fearing the {{influence}} of French Revolutionary ideals, particularly those of philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Trimmer emphasized orthodox Anglicanism and encouraged the <b>perpetuation</b> <b>of</b> the contemporary social and political order. Despite her conservatism, however, she agreed with Rousseau and other progressive educational reformers on many issues, such as the damaging effects of rote learning and the irrationalism of fairy tales.|$|E
5|$|The Narrator – as {{in other}} works of metafiction, the narrator's voice {{frequently}} intervenes in the story with a personality of its own. Though the voice appears {{to be that of}} Fowles, Magali Cornier Michael notes that chapter 13, which discusses the role of author and narrator within fiction, distinguishes between the author's role in the text and the narrator's. Alice Ferrebe describes the narrator as both a lens for critiquing traditional gender roles and a <b>perpetuation</b> <b>of</b> the perspectives on gendered identity perpetuated by the male gaze.|$|E
50|$|All {{stories are}} {{considered}} {{property in the}} Tlingit cultural system, such that sharing a story without the proper permission of its owners is a breach of Tlingit law. However, {{the stories of the}} Tlingit people as a whole, the creation myths, and other seemingly universal records are usually considered to be property of the entire tribe, and thus may be shared without particular restriction. It is however important to the Tlingit that the details be correct, for if not this can lead to <b>perpetuations</b> <b>of</b> error and worsen the transmission of the information in the future, as well as degrade the value of the knowledge.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Identifying {{intraspecific}} units or {{stocks of}} a species with unique morphological characters enables a better management of these subunits of species and ensurs <b>perpetuations</b> <b>of</b> the resources. Multivariate morphometry has been commonly used to investigate the discreteness and interrelationships of stocks within a species. Different types of body measurements have been traditionally used to charecterise stocks. However these measurements have recently been criticised because there are several biases and weaknesses inherent in traditional characters. As an alternative, {{a new system of}} morphometric measurements called The Truss Network System has been increasingly used for stock identification. In this review a computer-originated approach to the collection and analysis of morphometric characteristics of stocks is described. Key Words: Stock identification, multivariate morphometric investigation, the Truss System...|$|R
40|$|This {{study of}} atomic-bomb {{literature}} on Hiroshima will be through a critical lens, largely through postcolonial theory and reader-response criticism. It {{will be a}} discussion on {{the social and political}} implications behind the popularization of certain works. The discussed texts will not necessarily be written by the Japanese or by survivors of the atomic bomb: in the first case, I will be examining authorial intent and its relation to the intended reader responses from the implied American audience to study <b>perpetuations</b> <b>of</b> propaganda after the war. This paper will also be examining the interlingual translatability of psychological and physical trauma surrounding the atomic bomb and will be exploring the capacities of language to express an emotional and often sensitive topic...|$|R
5|$|Scholarship in {{the area}} of Jewish Christian studies has tended to be based on {{artificial}} constructs similar to those developed by the early Christian heresiologists, with the underlying assumption that all of the beliefs and practices of these groups were based on theology. This has led to the <b>perpetuation</b> <b>of</b> ideological definitions that fail {{to take into account the}} pluriformity of these groups, reflecting differences in geography, time periods in history, and ethnicity. With respect to Epiphanius, and the Ebionites in particular, insufficient attention has been paid to the highly speculative nature of his theological constructs and his mixing together of disparate sources, including his use of a gospel harmony that may have had nothing to do with the Ebionite sect known to Irenaeus. In the end, he presents an enigmatic picture of the Ebionites and their place in early Christian history.|$|E
5|$|When Darwin {{received}} Alfred Russel Wallace's {{paper that}} described natural selection, Hooker and Charles Lyell {{arranged for a}} joint reading of papers by Darwin and Wallace to the Linnean Society on July1, 1858. Since Darwin had nothing prepared, the reading included excerpts from his 1844 Essay and from a letter he had sent to Asa Gray in July 1857 outlining his theory {{on the origin of}} species. By that time, Darwin had begun writing his book On the Origin of Species. The correspondence with Gray was thus a key piece of evidence in establishing Darwin's intellectual priority with respect to the theory of evolution by natural selection. Neither Darwin nor Wallace attended the meeting. The papers were published by the society as On the Tendency of Species to form Varieties; and on the <b>Perpetuation</b> <b>of</b> Varieties and Species by Natural Means of Selection. By summer 1859 it was obvious to Gray and others working with Darwin that On the Origin of Species would be a ground-breaking book.|$|E

40|$|Meta-disparagement” humor {{refers to}} jokes that {{explicitly}} target a minority while implicitly ridiculing {{those who would}} laugh at the joke at face value. Through the use of irony, an implicit bigot is summoned as the true joke target. But at an explicit level, these jokes are offensive <b>perpetuations</b> <b>of</b> stereotypes. Thus, while meta-disparagement humor purports to undermine stereotypes, it may in fact reinforce and perpetuate them. Using both qualitative and quantitative methodologies, this dissertation investigates this possibility vis-à-vis humor that targets women, blacks, gay people, and Arabs. A discursive textual analysis {{of this type of}} humor in popular television series reveals that meta-disparagement humor most often derives from “hyperbole of prejudice” to ultimately critique political correctness. For all four groups, meta-disparagement humor is a double-edged phenomenon, indulging in stereotypes to ridicule them. A quantitative content analysis of the same television series determines the prevalence of and power dynamics embedded in this type of humor. A survey establishes baseline attitudes towards these groups. Finally, a series of six experiments tests the effects meta-disparagement versus direct disparagement humor of the four groups of interest on attitudes towards these groups using a variety of outcome variables. Overall, the experiments point to negative effects of this type of humor, such that stereotypes are more salient and impact subsequent judgments...|$|R

This was when many deferred programs and alternatives to formal criminal and adult jurisdictions changed, making it more child-friendly. In more recent years, the restorative justice model has been promoted as {{a better way to}} process and reintegrate youth who are involved in the court system back into the community. This model is multifaceted and requires a change in the cultural understanding {{of what it means to}} commit a crime as a person under the age of majority. The United Nations has offered aid to countries looking to move towards a restorative justice model as it is a positive change in from a human rights discourse. Difficulty in implementing restorative justice comes with cultural differences cross-nationally as well as the scope and breadth of the model. Additionally, the traditional values of adversarial justice have been rooted in the juvenile system for a very long time, which makes it difficult implement change on a global scale. Overall, the United Nation's attempts at changing the conversation and structure surrounding juvenile courts, have made small strides as many other issues continually being addressed.|$|R

40|$|Whitebark pine (Pinus albicaulis) {{is a major}} {{tree species}} of upper subalpine forests of the {{northern}} Rocky Mountains (Schmidt and McDonald 1990). It is an important nutri-tional and structural component of wildlife habitat (Arno and Hoff 1990; Schmidt and McDonald 1990). Its large, nutlike seeds are a major food source for many birds and mammals (about 105 species) including squirrels, black and grizzly bears, and Clark's nutcrackers (Hutchins and Lan-ner 1982). The species protects watersheds by stabilizing soil and rock on the harshest sites and by catching and securing snowpack. Historically, whitebark pine was a ma-jor species on 10 to 15 percent of the forest landscape in western Montana and central Idaho (Arno 1986); thus, its <b>perpetuation</b> is <b>of</b> concern for maintaining natural biodiversity and landscape structure...|$|R
