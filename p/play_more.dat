5|$|During McCartney's {{early years}} with the Beatles, he {{primarily}} used a Höfner 500/1 bass, though in 1965, he began sporadically using a Rickenbacker 4001S for recording. While typically using Vox amplifiers, by 1967 he had also begun using a Fender Bassman for amplification. During the late 1980s and early 1990s, he used a Wal 5-String, which he said made him <b>play</b> <b>more</b> thick-sounding basslines, {{in contrast to the}} much lighter Höfner, which inspired him to <b>play</b> <b>more</b> sensitively, something he considers fundamental to his playing style. He changed back to the Höfner around 1990 for that reason. He uses Mesa Boogie bass amplifiers while performing live.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of her}} {{preparation}} for entering the studio, Bush toured pubs with the KT Bush Band. However, for her début album, The Kick Inside (1978), she was persuaded to use established session musicians, some of whom she would retain even after she had brought her bandmates back on board. Her brother Paddy played the harmonica and mandolin, unlike on later albums where he would <b>play</b> <b>more</b> exotic instruments such as the balalaika and didgeridoo. Stuart Elliott played some of the drums and would become her main drummer on subsequent albums.|$|E
5|$|Kafka shared time {{at quarterback}} with Persa {{due to his}} {{strained}} hamstring on November 7 against the 4th-ranked, and previously undefeated, Iowa Hawkeyes. Northwestern coming into the game was a 16-point underdog, but still beat Iowa 17–10 in Northwestern's first win over a nationally ranked top-ten team since they won against Ohio State in 2004. Persa {{had to leave the}} game early to receive X-rays for a hand injury, which forced Kafka to <b>play</b> <b>more</b> than original planned. He finished as Northwestern’s leading passer with 72yards on ten completions.|$|E

He was tipped by ESPN journalist Jonathan Johnson to <b>play</b> <b>more</b> frequently over the season, as new manager Unai Emery sold David Luiz back to Chelsea. He scored his first goal of the season on 26 February 2017, opening a 5–1 win at rivals Marseille; prior to the game he confirmed {{that he was in}} talks for a new contract at the club.|$|E

5|$|McLean's favoured {{position}} is {{as a central}} midfielder, but he can also play as a left midfielder. He {{has said that he}} favours playing in the centre because he can get more of the ball and influence <b>play</b> <b>more</b> than when he is on the left. He is a naturally attacking player and when playing in the centre he makes runs to and beyond the striker which adds an extra dimension to his team's play.|$|E

5|$|The Nord Stage {{follows the}} success of earlier {{keyboard}} instruments from Clavia, and contains similar emulations of vintage electromechanical keyboards such as the Hammond Organ and electric pianos as found on the Nord Electro 2, with additional functionality including a weighted piano-like keyboard on certain models, a synthesizer section based on the Nord Lead, a more versatile organ section and extended effects processing. The Nord Stage is multitimbral, which means it can <b>play</b> <b>more</b> than one sound at once, either by splitting the internal keyboard or connecting an external MIDI controller.|$|E
5|$|The monochord {{served as}} a precise measure of the notes of a musical scale, {{allowing}} more accurate musical arrangements. Mechanical hurdy-gurdies allowed single musicians to <b>play</b> <b>more</b> complicated arrangements than a fiddle would; both were prominent folk instruments in the Middle Ages. Southern Europeans played short and long lutes whose pegs extended to the sides, unlike the rear-facing pegs of Central and Northern European instruments. Idiophones such as bells and clappers served various practical purposes, such as warning of the approach of a leper.|$|E
40|$|The {{bachelor}} {{study was}} focused on the analysis of dog interactions in Brno-Lužanky. Two hundred dogs were observed. The sex of the dog influenced canine behavior. Female dogs more frequently sniffed the head in dogs, while male dogs more frequently sniffed the back part of the body in dogs. Dogs of the opposite sex <b>played</b> <b>more</b> frequently than dogs of the same sex. Dogs off a leash <b>played</b> <b>more</b> frequently than dogs on a leash. Dogs led by men <b>played</b> <b>more</b> frequently than dogs led by women. In conclusion, canine behavior in open spaces is influenced by many factors...|$|R

He also queried the first-class status of Bill Ponsford's record innings of 429, scored against Tasmania. On the journey home, MacLaren {{sent a message to}} Lancashire asking for more money; the committee declined to send the sum and shortly afterwards terminated his contract as coach.

5|$|After {{three years}} in the youth team, Totti made his first {{appearance}} for Roma's senior side in Serie A at the age of 16, when coach Vujadin Boškov called him up in the 2–0 away victory against Brescia on 28 March 1993. In the following season under Carlo Mazzone, Totti began to <b>play</b> <b>more</b> regularly as a second striker, and scored his first goal on 4 September 1994 in a 1–1 draw against Foggia. By 1995, Totti had become a regular in Roma's starting line-up and scored 16 goals during the next three seasons, while creating several more, as his talent was praised by his manager Mazzone.|$|E
5|$|Allen {{was born}} in Australia {{and grew up in}} England from the age of six. After playing cricket for Eton College, he went to Cambridge University where he {{established}} a reputation as a fast bowler, albeit one who was often injured. After leaving university, Allen played mainly for Middlesex. He improved as a batsman in the following seasons until work commitments forced him to play less regularly. A change of career allowed him to <b>play</b> <b>more</b> cricket, and by the late 1920s he {{was on the verge of}} the England Test team. He made his debut in 1930, and remained in contention for a place, when he was available to play, for the rest of the decade. During the controversial Bodyline tour of 1932–33, Allen was very successful for England but refused to use the intimidatory tactics employed by his teammates.|$|E

He spent three years at Derby but handed in a transfer request when the club was relegated from the Premier League. Southampton signed Higginbotham for a £1.5million fee in February 2003, and he helped them reach the 2003 FA Cup Final. When Southampton were relegated in 2005, Higginbotham rejected a new contract and {{was placed on the}} transfer list.|$|E
5|$|Carrick {{was born}} to Vince and Lynn Carrick in Wallsend, Tyne and Wear, and first became {{involved}} in football at age five. A boyhood fan of Newcastle United, he played five-a-side football with Wallsend Boys Club on Saturday nights, courtesy of his father's volunteer work at the club. Football became more serious {{for him at the}} age of 12 when he was selected for Burnside High School and later on North Tyneside Schools. While playing for Wallsend Boys' Club under-16s, he was capped for the England Boys' club side. At age 13, Carrick was profiled by the BBC children's programme Live & Kicking episode 49, which aired on 4 February 1995. During his school years, and the years up until his move to West Ham United, Carrick actually played as a centre-forward; it was only at West Ham that he started to <b>play</b> <b>more</b> often as a midfielder. He studied at Wallsend's Western Middle School and Burnside Community High School, completing his GCSE exams in 1997.|$|E
5|$|Chapman was {{unavailable}} for the Test series in South Africa {{in the winter}} of 1927–28, but was a certainty to lead the MCC team to Australia in 1928–29. The selectors wished him to <b>play</b> <b>more</b> regularly, so he played more often in 1928 than any other season. He began in good form, but was never as effective as in 1927. Although his captaincy continued to be highly regarded, there were concerns in the press over his increasing weight, although these were offset by his impressive fielding in that season's Tests. He captained England to a 3–0 series win over West Indies, who were playing their first Test matches, and scored one fifty. In total, he scored 967 first-class runs at 37.19.|$|E
