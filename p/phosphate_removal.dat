The aim of this prospective study {{was to develop a}} simple, bedside formula to estimate dialytic <b>phosphate</b> <b>removal</b> in stable HD patients. Methods.  This was a prospective, randomized trial. Phosphate and urea elimination were assessed in a representative group of patients at two dialysis centres using randomly different dialysers (1. 3 - 2. 4 [*]m 2).

Results.  A formula allowing quantification of <b>phosphate</b> <b>removal</b> within one HD session was developed in 18 of 74 patients during 41 treatments (137 out of 177 data sets) and was determined as: MPO 4 pred= 0. 1 t − 17 + 50 cds 60 + 11 cb 60, where t is treatment time in min, cds 60 and cb 60 are phosphate concentrations in dialysate and plasma measured 60 [*]min into HD in mmol/l, and MPO 4 pred is estimated phosphate removed in mmol.

The effects of different parameters such as pH, adsorbent dosage, initial dye concentration, contact time, addition of ions and temperature have been studied to understand the adsorption behavior of the adsorbent under various conditions. The adsorbent has been characterized by pHzpc measurement, chemical analyses, FTIR, XRD and TEM.

Thermodynamic parameters including the Gibbs free energy ΔG, enthalpy ΔH, and entropy ΔS have revealed that the adsorption of DY 28 on the apatitic tricalcium phosphate is feasible, spontaneous and endothermic. Among the kinetic models tested for apatitic tricalcium phosphate, the pseudo-second-order model fits the kinetic data well. The introduction of orthophosphate ions in the medium causes a decrease of adsorption. The addition of Ca 2 + ions favors the adsorption.

This study investigated the <b>phosphate</b> <b>removal</b> efficiencies of unaerated and aerated filter systems using high composition of Calcium (Ca) steel slag as the filter media at different pH values of the wastewater influents. Lab-scale filters were developed using 25 mg/L synthetic wastewater and weekly sampling was done to monitor the <b>phosphate</b> <b>removal</b> efficiencies together with the concentration of metals (Calcium (Ca) and Magnesium (Mg). The results show that both unaerated and aerated systems have excellent <b>phosphate</b> <b>removal</b> efficiency at all acidic, neutral and alkaline pH feed, though unaerated systems removed slightly better compared to aerated systems; 76 - 98 % and 69 - 97 % respectively. The dominant <b>phosphate</b> <b>removal</b> mechanism for aerated systems was adsorption, meanwhilefor unaerated systems; both adsorption and precipitation for acidic and neutral pH, whileprecipitation was more dominant at basic pH. The performance of unaerated systems are slightly better compared to aerated systems, however, aerated systems are recommended to be applied when simultaneous removal of nutrients (phosphorus and nitrogen) are concerned...|$|E
40|$|The {{international}} {{shellfish farming}} industry has {{a growing problem}} with respect to sustainability: the shells, a by-product, are currently being mostly wasted to landfill. Instead, this calcium-rich resource {{can be used to}} produce lime [calcium oxide (CaO) ] and then used to remove phosphate from rural wastewaters. Powdered mussel shell was heat treated to form lime. Two different shell particle sizes (fine, 53 – 106 µm; coarse, 212 – 250 µm) as well as various pyrolysis times, heating rates, pyrolysis temperatures and shell concentrations were used {{to determine the effects of}} these parameters on the lime formation and subsequent <b>phosphate</b> <b>removal</b> from a synthetic wastewater. Furthermore, the mechanisms of <b>phosphate</b> <b>removal</b> were determined by quantifying the phosphate content in all components before and after reaction with the synthetic wastewater. It was found that with excess of partially calcined pyrolysed shells, at a concentration of 5 g l− 1, more than 95 % <b>phosphate</b> <b>removal</b> was achieved, irrespective of particle size or pyrolysis conditions. When using optimally heat-treated shells (particle size: 53 – 106 µm, pyrolysed for 1 h at 750 °C), it was possible to achieve over 90 % <b>phosphate</b> <b>removal</b> using just 196 mg l− 1 of shell. For the pyrolysed shells, the main mechanisms of <b>phosphate</b> <b>removal</b> were homogeneous nucleation to form a suspended precipitate, as well as adsorption and heterogeneous precipitation on the surface of the remaining calcite shell particle...|$|E

40|$|Constructed {{wetlands}} (CW) {{and soil}} aquifer treatment (SAT) represent natural wastewater treatment systems (NWTSs). The {{high costs of}} conventional wastewater treatment techniques encourage more studies to investigate lower cost treatment methods which make these appropriate for developing and also in developed countries. The main objective {{of this research was}} to investigate the removals of nutrients and organic micropollutants (OMPs) through SAT, CW and the CW-SAT hybrid system. CWs are an efficient technology to purify and remove different nutrients as well as OMPs from wastewater. They removed most of the dissolved organic matter (DOC), total nitrogen (TN), ammonium and phosphate. Furthermore, CWs aeration could be used as one of the alternatives to reduce CWs footprint by around 10 %. The vegetation in CWs plays an essential role in the treatment especially for nitrogen and <b>phosphate</b> <b>removals,</b> it is responsible for the removal of 15 %, 55 %, 38 %, and 22 % for TN, dissolved organic nitrogen (DON), nitrate and phosphate, respectively. CWs achieved a very high removal for some OMPs; they attenuated acetaminophen, caffeine, fluoxetine and trimethoprim (> 90 %) under different redox conditions. Moreover, it was found that increasing temperature (up to 36 C) could enhance the removals of atenolol, caffeine, DEET and trimethoprim by 17 %, 14 %, 28 % and 45 %, respectively. On the other hand, some OMPs, were found to be removed by vegetation such as: acetaminophen, caffeine, fluoxetine, sulfamethoxazole, and trimethoprim. Moreover, atenolol, caffeine, fluoxetine and trimethoprim, showed high removal (> 80 %) through SAT system. It was also found that, temperature increasing and using primary instead of secondary effluent could enhance the removal of some OMPs. The CWs performance study showed that these systems are adapted to the prevailing extreme arid conditions and the average percent removals are about, 88 %, 96 %, 98 %, 98 % and 92 %, for COD, BOD and TSS, ammonium and phosphate, respectively. Additionally, the natural hybrid system (CW-SAT) can provide an effective treatment technology of reclaimed water for replenishing aquifers and subsequent reuse. This hybrid system embodied the performance advantages of both processes and exhibits a high potential for removal of OMPs, nutrients, metals as well as pathogens, bacteria and viruses...|$|R
