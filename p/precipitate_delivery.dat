50|$|<b>Precipitate</b> <b>{{delivery}}</b> {{refers to}} a delivery which results after an unusually rapid labor (combined 1st stage and second stage duration is <2hrs) and culminates in the rapid, spontaneous expulsion of the infant. Delivery often occurs {{without the benefit of}} asepsis.|$|E

40|$|Causes {{of birth}} {{asphyxia}} and trauma were determined in the 208 most severely affected infants of 10, 995 consecutive live births; 159 infants had cerebral disturbances, 39 had fractures and palsies, and 10 had fractures or palsies {{in addition to}} cerebral disturbances. Most frequent causes of birth asphyxia and trauma were: prolonged labour, midforceps or breech delivery in full-term infants; abruption placentae, difficult breech delivery, and maternal sedation in premature infants; and unattended <b>precipitate</b> <b>deliveries</b> in immature infants. Asphyxia following normal labour and delivery usually occurred in infants with fetal malnutrition...|$|R

There may also be hemorrhaging from the uterus. Uterine atony may result from muscular exhaustion after unusually strong and rapid labor.There may be infection as a result of unsterile delivery.|$|E

The empirical research generates {{an expression of the}} psychological contracts held between internal customers and suppliers based upon the content analysis of qualitative interviews. Seven hundred and twenty three contractual expectations are reduced into 17 categories and this analytical framework is applied to measure the strength of the psychological contract between three interdependent service groups. The research explores how established psychological contracts encouraged the provision of flexible {{internal service}}s and how psychological contract breach <b>precipitated</b> service <b>delivery</b> problems with clear implications for managers and service organisations...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: Despite {{controversy}} {{regarding the}} efficacy of home uterine activity monitoring (HUAM), it is currently licensed for detection of preterm labor in women with previous preterm deliveries. In practice, however, it is being more widely utilized {{in an effort to}} prevent preterm delivery. This study seeks to determine which group of mothers delivering very low birth weight (VLBW) infants would have qualified for HUAM given three different sets of criteria and in which women it could have been used to help prolong gestation. METHODS: The authors reviewed the medical records of mothers of VLBW infants born in five U. S. locations (N = 1440), retrospectively applying three sets of eligibility criteria for HUAM use: (a) the current FDA licensing criterion for use of HUAM, a previous preterm birth; (b) indication for HUAM commonly cited in published reports; (c) a broad set of criteria based on the presence of any reproductive or medical conditions that might predispose to premature delivery. The authors then analyzed the conditions <b>precipitating</b> <b>delivery</b> for each group to determine whether delivery might have been prevented with HUAM and tocolytic therapy. RESULTS: Only 4. 4 % of the total group of women delivering VLBW infants would have been eligible for HUAM under the FDA criterion and might potentially have benefited from this technology. If extremely broad criteria had been applied to identify those eligible for monitoring, under which almost 80 % of all women who delivered VLBW infants would have been monitored, only 20. 3 % of the total group would have been found eligible and would potentially have benefited. If such broad criteria were applied to all pregnant women, a sizable proportion of pregnancies would be monitored at great expense with small potential clinical benefit. CONCLUSIONS: Because VLBW births are usually precipitated by conditions that are unlikely to benefit from HUAM, this technology will have little impact on reducing VLBW and neonatal mortality rates. More comprehensive preventive strategies should be sought...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Background: In Japan, the {{proportion}} of women aged 35 and older giving birth has greatly increased in recent years, and maternal age is continuing to increase. Advanced maternal age is {{a risk factor for}} abnormal delivery, as is hiesho (sensitivity to cold). Research Question: This study aimed to assess whether advanced maternal age and hiesho <b>precipitate</b> premature <b>delivery,</b> premature rupture of membranes, weak labor pains, prolonged labor and atonic bleeding. Method: The study design was a descriptive comparative study with a retrospective cohort group design. Subjects in this study were 2, 810 Japanese women in hospital after childbirth. The research methods employed were a paper questionnaire and extraction of data from medical records. Results: Comparing the rate of occurrence of abnormal delivery among women aged 35 to 39 according to whether or not they had hiesho, results were premature delivery OR: 3. 51 (95 % CI: 1. 66 - 7. 43), premature rupture of membranes OR...|$|R
40|$|Trends in out-of-hospital births for the State of Michigan, 1972 - 79, were {{examined}} by analyzing (a) location of deliveries, (b) {{characteristics of the}} mother, (c) use of health services, and (d) characteristics of the newborn. A large increase occurred {{in the number of}} births at the mother's home and other nonhospital sites for both the black and the white populations. For white women, the increase was associated with better education and greater use of prenatal care. Physician attendance for deliveries at mother's home declined. Birth weights for home-born infants increased significantly over the period, more so for whites than for blacks; mortality declined in some groups, especially for high-birth-weight babies born at the mother's home. Assuming that the rise in home births in the 1970 s was due to an increase in planned and not <b>precipitate</b> home <b>deliveries,</b> the authors concluded that these trends reflect, at least in part, the impact of planned out-of-hospital births. Toward the end of the 1970 s, both the conditions under which these births occurred and some of their outcome measures were more characteristic of safety than {{at the beginning of the}} period. Disaggregation by race demonstrated, however, that the safety factor was not necessarily present for out-of-hospital births of black infants...|$|R
40|$|Considering the {{processing}} of case hardening steel components, the machining {{as well as the}} heat treatment offer great capability for cost savings. By increasing the carburising temperature from today approximately 940 °C up to e. g. 1050 °C significant process time reductions are achievable due to the acceleration of diffusion and absorption processes. While increasing the carburising temperature, the appearance of prohibited coarse austenite grains has to be avoided. However the former austenite grain size is an attribute of the overall process chain from steel melting to case hardening. In this work, the influence of the manufacturing process on grain size stability of case hardening steels has been investigated. To simulate the hot forming process in laboratory scale compression tests (Rastegaev samples) have been performed to different standard steel grades (16 MnCr 5 / 20 NiCrMo 2) as well as two micro-alloyed (16 MnCr 5 Nb / 20 NiCrMo 2 Nb) steel grades. An increase in grain size stability during carburising simply depends on the size of precipitates. Unfortunately the use of a mean precipitate size is not significant, because the size distribution is modified by every single process step - even the case hardening itself. The results of this work show, that if deformation is carried out by warm deformation below a specific temperature T 1 - which {{is a function of the}} chemical composition - grain size stability is assessed by the condition of <b>precipitates</b> upon <b>delivery.</b> The low temperature prevents a change in precipitate morphology by low diffusion. Increasing the deformation temperature the grain size stability during following case hardening depends on the deformation degree. The higher the deformation degree, the bigger is the risk of illegal grain coarsening. With a further increase of the deformation temperature - above a specific temperature T 2 - no dependence of grain coarsening temperature and deformation degree is observed, assumed that the material contains an adequate content of micro-alloying elements Nb and Ti as well as Al and N...|$|R
