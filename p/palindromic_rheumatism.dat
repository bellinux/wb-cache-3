50|$|<b>Palindromic</b> <b>rheumatism</b> is {{a disease}} of unknown cause. It has been {{suggested}} that it is an abortive form of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), since anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies (anti-CCP) and antikeratin antibodies (AKA) are present in a high proportion of patients, {{as is the case in}} rheumatoid arthritis. Unlike RA and some other forms of arthritis, <b>palindromic</b> <b>rheumatism</b> affects men and women equally. <b>Palindromic</b> <b>rheumatism</b> is frequently the presentation for Whipple disease which is caused by the infectious agent Tropheryma whipplei (formerly T. whippelii).|$|E

50|$|<b>Palindromic</b> <b>rheumatism.</b> Like IH, <b>palindromic</b> <b>rheumatism</b> (PR) is also characterised by relapsing, short-episodes {{of sudden}} onset {{arthritis}} with no recognisable trigger. However, unlike PR, IH affects the knee almost exclusively {{and there is}} a predictable periodic, regularity of attacks, with laboratory tests during attacks being generally unremarkable. PR is also more likely to be associated with development of rheumatoid arthritis.|$|E
50|$|No {{single test}} can confirm a {{diagnosis}}. A doctor {{may make a}} diagnosis based on medical history and signs and symptoms. <b>Palindromic</b> <b>rheumatism</b> must be distinguished from acute gouty arthritis and an atypical, acute onset of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Without specific tests (such as analysis of joint fluid), {{it may be difficult}} to distinguish <b>palindromic</b> <b>rheumatism</b> from other episodic joint problems. It is important to note that a person may experience more than one autoimmune disorder at the same time. Laboratory findings are usually normal. Blood tests may show an elevation of the ESR and CRP, but are otherwise unremarkable. Rheumatoid factor may be present especially in the group that is likely to develop rheumatoid arthritis.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Palindromic</b> <b>rheumatism</b> derives {{its name}} from the Greek palindromos meaning to take the same road once again (palin, again + dromos, pathway) {{emphasizing}} how the illness begins and ends in a similar way.

50|$|<b>Palindromic</b> <b>rheumatism</b> (PR) {{consists}} of sudden and rapidly developing attacks of arthritis. There is acute pain, redness, swelling, and disability {{of one or}} multiple joints. The interval between recurrent palindromic attacks {{and the length of}} an attack is extremely variable from few hours to days. Attacks may become more frequent with time but there is no joint damage after attacks. It is thought to be an autoimmune disease, possibly an abortive form of rheumatoid arthritis.|$|E
50|$|<b>Palindromic</b> <b>rheumatism</b> {{is a rare}} type of {{inflammatory}} arthritis which causes sudden inflammation in one or several joints, lasts a few hours or up to a few days, and then goes away completely. The problem usually involves 2 or 3 joints, which have onset over hours and last days to weeks, before subsiding. However episodes of recurrence form a pattern, with symptom-free periods between attacks lasting for weeks to months. The large joints are most commonly involved. Constitutionally, there {{may or may not}} be a fever, and swelling of the joints. The soft tissues are involved with swelling of the periarticular tissues, especially heel pads and finger pads. Nodules may be found in the subcutaneous tissues.Attacks may become more frequent with time but there is no joint damage after attacks.|$|E

40|$|Objective: Considering demographic, {{clinical}} and laboratory characteristics of <b>palindromic</b> <b>rheumatism</b> {{and finding out}} the difference between rheumatoid factor and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide positive and negative cases of <b>palindromic</b> <b>rheumatism</b> in Iran. Methods: In this cross-sectional and multicenter study, patients with intermittent arthritis were evaluated by a rheumatologist for <b>palindromic</b> <b>rheumatism.</b> Diagnosis of <b>palindromic</b> <b>rheumatism</b> was made after ruling out other causes of recurrent arthritis, and the fulfillment of the Pasero and Barbieri criteria. Then the demographic and clinical characteristics were recorded and compared in rheumatoid factor and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide positive and negative patients. Results: Of the 69 patients with <b>palindromic</b> <b>rheumatism,</b> 35 were men and 34 were women. The mean ages of the patients {{at the time of}} diagnosis were 38. 5 Â Â±Â 14. 6 Â years. The mean attack intervals and duration of the attacks were 66. 3 Â Â±Â 38. 4 Â days and 3. 9 Â Â±Â 3. 3 Â days, respectively. The most commonly involved joints were knees, metacarpophalangeals and proximal interphalangeals. Rheumatoid factor in 46. 4 and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide in 42 of the cases were positive. Palindromic patients with positive anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide had higher age, shorter duration of disease, shorter duration of attacks, more frequent attacks and more metacarpophalangeal joints involvement. Conclusions: Rheumatoid factor and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptides were found in a high proportion of patients with <b>palindromic</b> <b>rheumatism.</b> The clinical features of the disease in our study were different in rheumatoid factor and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide positive and negative patients.

40|$|<b>Palindromic</b> <b>rheumatism</b> is {{very rare}} in children. The {{familial}} occurrence of the disease has been only briefly reported previously. A family is described here in which the mother and her 3 children suffered from typical <b>palindromic</b> <b>rheumatism,</b> which ran a benign course. All 4 members were seronegative and the HLA types {{of the children were}} identical. The HLA genotype of the mother was HLA A 2, Cw 4, Bw 41, Bw 6, DR 5, MT 2 /Aw 32, CX, Bw 44, Bw 4, DR 1, MT 1. HLA DR 5 has previously been found to be associated with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, while DR 1 in Jews is significantly associated with adult-onset rheumatoid arthritis. DR 5 was shared by the mother and her 3 children. The presence of the antigen DR 5 in this sibship suggests that <b>palindromic</b> <b>rheumatism</b> may be a variant of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis with a relatively late onset and a more benign course.

40|$|Fifty {{patients}} who presented with typical <b>palindromic</b> <b>rheumatism</b> {{of at least}} 6 months ' duration were tissue-typed for HLA A, B, C antigens. DR typing was also performed but was not possible for technical reasons in three patients. Twenty-three {{patients who}} had progressed to definite or classical rheumatoid arthritis (RA) after a mean interval of 5 years were compared with 20 patients whose palindromic attacks had persisted over a similar period. Both groups showed a significantly higher frequency of DR 4 antigen than a control population. The RA group also showed an increased frequency of DR 1. There {{was no significant difference}} in the frequency of DR 4 or of any other DR antigen between the two patient groups. The frequency of B 27 antigen was significantly higher in the palindromic group compared with the controls.

At the first attendance minor clinical or radiological changes, raised erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and positive serology were more common along those patients who were about to develop the picture of RA. Rheumatoid disease developing in patients with a palindromic onset was at least as severe as that among other patients with RA. 5 patients gave a history suggestive of fluid retention during the palindromic episodes, suggesting that attacks might be related to circulating immune complexes and altered vascular permeability.

40|$|AbstractINTRODUCTIONMulticentric Reticulo{{histiocytosis}} (MRH) {{is a rare}} non-Langerhans cell histiocytosis characterised by destructive polyarthritis and violaceous skin papules. PRESENTATION OF CASEIn 2010, a 70 -year-old {{woman with}} <b>Palindromic</b> <b>Rheumatism</b> was diagnosed with MRH. Within a few months, she developed ankylosis of the small joints of both hands which resulted in severe fixed flexion deformities of the fingers and thumbs. The joint disease {{failed to respond to}} medical therapies and the palmar skin of her left hand was becoming increasingly macerated. Therefore, she elected to undergo arthrodesis of the metacarpophalangeal joints to allow hand hygiene. DISCUSSIONTo-date, this is the first report of a surgical intervention for this rare condition and represents a novel avenue of potential therapy. Medical therapies for MRH are usually ineffective in preventing the debilitating small joint disease which often develops and there is on-going research into newer agents and alternative surgical techniques. CONCLUSIONOnce medical therapies are exhausted, clinicians should consider the input of Hand Surgeons in managing the inevitable and mutilating joint disease of this rare condition...|$|E
40|$|A {{seropositive}} {{white man}} had follow-up for 16 {{years with a}} diagnosis of <b>palindromic</b> <b>rheumatism.</b> Treatment had included parenteral gold, methotrexate, prednisone, hydroxychloroquine sulfate, and penicillamine before diarrhea led to a biopsy-proven diagnosis of Whipple 2 ̆ 7 s disease. Clinical and radiographic criteria for ankylosing spondylitis were met. In addition to classic Whipple 2 ̆ 7 s arthropathy, he had the combined but singular findings of pancarpal destruction and cervical apophyseal fusion. HLA typing revealed the B 7 antigen. This case illustrates the pitfalls in diagnosis of a chronic polyarthritis that has, as a typical feature, a long latency before manifesting its more specific signs and symptoms (ie, diarrhea, malabsorption, and hyperpigmentation). Care should be taken during evaluation of any disease with atypical and nonspecific features (eg, positive rheumatoid factor in a patient with polyarthritis) and one should continue to reevaluate the original impression, while confirmatory evidence is lacking. Moreover, the roentgenographic findings of pancarpal narrowing, apophyseal fusion, and advanced iliofemoral joint disease, in addition to sacroiliitis and syndesmophyte formation, challenge the generally held notion that Whipple 2 ̆ 7 s arthropathy is a nondestructive joint disease...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} whether sonography and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) antibodies in Chinese {{patients with}} <b>palindromic</b> <b>rheumatism</b> (PR) during active episodes are of predictive value {{for development of}} rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Clinically involved regions of 84 PR patients during active episodes were examined with ultrasonography using a 6 – 13 MHz linear transducer. Serum levels of anti-CCP antibodies were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. All patients were followed up monthly for 3 years after investigation. Thirteen (15 %) of the PR patients had progressed to RA after a mean of 1. 4 years (range, 0. 4 – 3. 0 years). Of these 13 patients, 11 patients (85 %) had sonographic features of synovitis and 8 patients (62 %) had a positive anti-CCP antibody test. The absence of sonographic features of synovitis during active episodes provided a very high 3 -year predictive value in excluding the possibility of progression to RA for PR patients with a negative anti-CCP antibody test. Both the sonographic findings of synovitis and a positive anti-CCP antibody test were significant predictors for progression of PR to RA within 3 years by backward stepwise logistic regression analysis. Sonographic examination together with an anti-CCP antibody test during active episodes is useful for predicting the progression of PR to RA...|$|E
40|$|Objective. The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} whether the presence of ultrasonographic findings of synovitis is associated with the presence of anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP) antibodies and rheumatoid factor (RF) in patients with <b>palindromic</b> <b>rheumatism</b> (PR) during active episodes. Methods. Clinically involved regions of 84 patients with PR during active episodes were examined with high-resolution ultrasonography. Serum levels of anti-CCP antibodies were determined by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and RF levels were measured by nephelometry. Results. Thirty patients (36 %) had ultrasonographic findings of synovitis during active episodes. Significantly higher positive rates of anti-CCP antibodies and RF were observed in patients with PR who had ultrasonographic findings of synovitis compared with those who had no ultrasonographic findings of synovitis (26. 7 % versus 5. 6 %; odds ratio, 6. 18; P <. 05; and 30. 0 % versus 5. 6 %; odds ratio, 7. 29; P <. 01, respectively). The intraobserver and interobserver agreement for the detection of synovitis and Doppler signals by ultrasonographic assessment was excellent. Conclusions. Ultrasonography is a reliable method for assessing the presence of synovitis in patients with PR during active episodes.

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{determine}} the frequency of rheumatoid factor (RF) and cyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP) antibodies in a cohort of patients with <b>palindromic</b> <b>rheumatism</b> (PR) and to find determinants for progression to rheumatoid arthritis (RA). All new cases of PR (n[*]=[*] 90) were included prospectively and followed up for 1 year, and a comparison group of RA cases (n[*]=[*] 70) was also included. At study entry in all patients in both groups, RF and anti-CCP antibodies were tested, and the findings were compared and correlated. In the PR group at presentation, RF was positive in 30 patients (33. 3 %) and, in the RA group, in 45 patients (64. 3 %). Anti-CCP antibodies were positive in 35 patients (38. 9 %) with PR and in 58 patients (82. 9 %) with RA. In the PR group, positive correlations were observed between RF and C-reactive protein (CRP) (p[*]=[*] 0. 036), while anti-CCP positively correlated with disease duration (p[*]=[*] 0. 015) and CRP (p[*]<[*] 0. 001). At 1 -year follow-up, 25 cases (27. 5 %) had progressed to RA, 3 (3. 3 %) cases had developed systemic lupus, 43 cases had responded to hydroxychloroquine with complete remission, five cases had developed other rheumatic diseases, and 14 cases had progressed to undifferentiated arthritis. After regression analysis, the involvement of hand joints and positive anti-CCP were the only predictors that determined progression into RA within a year (p[*]<[*] 0. 001 and p[*]=[*] 0. 02, respectively).

40|$|To {{estimate}} {{the association between}} a history of periodontitis (PD) {{and the risk of}} incident <b>palindromic</b> <b>rheumatism</b> (PR). Using a nationwide, administrative database, this study identified 4, 421 newly-diagnosed PR cases from 2007 to 2012 and randomly selected 44, 210 non-PR controls matched (1 : 10) for sex, age and the year of the index date. After adjusting for comorbid diabetes mellitus, we estimated the odds ratios (ORs) with 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) using conditional logistic regression analysis to quantify the association between a history of PD and the risk of PR. The influences of the lag time and severity of PD were examined by calculating ORs for subgroups of patients based on the time interval between the last PD-related visit and the index date and PD-related cumulative cost and number of visit. This study showed an association between a history of PD and incident PR (OR, 1. 51; 95 % CI, 1. 41 - 1. 61). The association remained significant after variation of PD definitions. The magnitude of the association was greater in those with shorter lag time between the latest date of PD diagnosis and PR index date and those who had a higher number of visits for PD or a greater cumulative cost for PD-related visits. After excluding 569 PR patients who developed rheumatoid arthritis after the index date, we found a consistent time- and dose-dependent association between PD and PR risk.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{determine}} which variables at baseline are predictive {{for the development}} of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) from <b>palindromic</b> <b>rheumatism</b> (PR) in a Japanese population. METHODS: Anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) antibodies, joint involvement pattern, genotypes of HLA-DRB 1, peptidylarginine deiminase (PADI 4), and protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTPN 22) were examined in 28 patients with PR at baseline, and their clinical outcome was prospectively evaluated. The same variables were also investigated in 38 healthy controls. RESULTS: Eleven out of 28 patients with PR developed RA. The prevalence of anti-CCP antibodies in the PR patients who developed RA was significantly higher compared to the patients who did not. Proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint involvement at baseline was also predictive towards the development of RA. Compared with the controls, differences in the frequency of single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) on padi 4 _ 104 [T(RA susceptible) [...] >C(RA non-susceptible) ] and the presence of an RA susceptible homozygote of the PADI 4 haplotype were detected in patients with PR whereas we could not find any further difference in PR patients who developed RA compared to PR patients who do not develop RA in PADI 4. None of the subjects possessed the PTPN 22 SNP (1858 C [...] >T). Cox regression analysis revealed that anti-CCP antibodies as well as PIP involvement are the most relevant variables {{for the development of}} RA from PR. None of the PR patients with either HLA-DRB 1 *SE alleles (or the HLA-DRB 1 * 0405 allele) or anti-CCP antibodies developed RA.

40|$|<b>Palindromic</b> <b>rheumatism</b> (PR) is {{characterized}} by recurrent attacks of acute arthritis, periarthritis, and sometimes paraarthritis. Some PR patients would develop to RA, which is a relatively serious disease. The controversy over whether PR is a separate disorder or is a prodrome of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) has not been resolved. However, the cytokine level of PR patients is currently unknown. This study aims to investigate the possible difference {{in the frequency of}} circulating T-helper 17 (Th 17) cells and serum levels of Th 17 related cytokines between PR patients and RA patients, associated PR and pure PR, as well as between PR patients in active phase and those in inactive phase. We also attempted to search Th 17 -related cytokines, which might be helpful for separating PR and RA, and also predicting whether PR progress to RA. In this study, the percentages of circulating interleukin (IL) - 17, TNF (Tumor necrosis factor) -α, and IFN (Interferon) -γ expressing T helper cells in PR patients and RA patients were determined by flow cytometry analysis. The concentration of serum IL- 17, TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL- 6, and IL- 1 β were determined by ELISA. Our preliminary results revealed that the percentages of circulating Th 17, Th 1, and TNF-α expressing Th cells were significantly lower in PR patients than in RA patients. Significantly lower levels of serum IL- 17, IFN-γ, IL- 6, and IL- 1 β were also observed in PR patients than in RA patients, but no statistical difference in serum TNF-α levels. Significantly higher levels of serum IFN-γ, IL- 6, and IL- 1 β, were observed in associated PR patients than in pure PR patients. There {{were no significant differences in}} levels of serum IL- 17 or TNF-α between associated PR patients and pure PR patients. The serum level of TNF-α in active PR was significant higher than inactive PR. In summary, different pattern of Th 17 and related cytokines was noted between PR patients and RA patients, also between associated PR patients and pure PR patients. Our preliminary result suggested pure elucidate these finding. 反覆性風濕症（Palindromic rheumatism, PR）被認為是反覆發作的發炎性關節疾病，並經常伴隨著關節周圍與關節以外組織發炎，且有部份PR患者會轉變成較嚴重的類風濕關節炎（Rheumatoid arthritis, RA）。然而，PR究竟是一個獨立的疾病或是RA的前兆，目前仍未確立。由於PR患者體內細胞激素（Cytokines）的變化至今尚未被報告，因此本篇研究主要探討PR患者再分為相關性反覆性風濕症（associated PR）與單純性反覆性風濕症（pure PR）患者與RA患者其周邊血液第十七型輔助T細胞（T-helper 17 cell, Th 17 cells）比例及與其相關之細胞激素（Cytokines）濃度是否存在差異性，進而找出可能作為分辨PR與RA，或是預測PR是否轉變成RA的細胞激素。本研究係以流式細胞儀（Flow cytometry）檢測PR與RA患者周邊血液中之，第十七型輔助T細胞、第一型輔助T細胞（T-helper 1 cells,Th 17 cells）、表現TNF-α之輔助型T細胞（CD 4 +TNF-α+ T-helper cells）之比例；並以酵素連結免疫吸著劑分析法（Enzyme-linked immunosobent assay, ELISA）分析PR與RA患者血清介白質（Interleukin, IL）- 17 、腫瘤壞死因子（Tumor necrosis factor, TNF）-α、干擾素（Interferon, IFN）-γ、IL- 6 及IL- 1 β細胞激素濃度。我們的結果顯示PR患者周邊血液Th 17 細胞、Th 1 細胞與表現TNF-α之輔助型T細胞比例皆低於RA患者；PR患者血清IL- 17 、IFN-γ、IL- 6 、IL- 1 β的濃度皆低於RA患者，但TNF-α則沒有統計上之差異。而associated PR患者血清IFN-γ、IL- 6 、IL- 1 β之濃度高於pure PR；IL- 17 及TNF-α則無顯著差異。PR患者發病前後，僅於血清TNF-α濃度有顯著差異。本研究闡明PR與RA、associated PR與pure PR、及PR發作前後，患者體內Th 17 與其相關細胞激素具有差異性，開啟了研究此疾病之新方向。第一章、緒論 P 1 一、類風濕關節炎 	P 1 二、反覆性風濕症	P 5 三、第十七型輔助T細胞及其相關之細胞激素 P 12 第二章、研究目的 P 17 第三章、材料與方法	 	P 18 一、血液檢體收集與處理 	 P 18 二、酵素連結免疫吸著劑分析法 P 19 三、流式細胞儀分析法	 	 P 21 四、統計方法			 P 23 第四章、結果			 P 24 一、背景統計資料			 P 24 二、PR與RA表現細胞激素的輔助型T細胞含量 P 28 三、PR與RA血清細胞激素之濃度 P 32 四、associated PR與pure PR血清細胞激素之濃度 P 37 第五章、討論	 		 P 42 參考文獻		 	 P 4...|$|E
40|$|To {{determine}} {{the causes of}} non-traumatic arthritides and their outcome In patients admitted tu a national referral hospital. Prospective study of all consecutive admissions with joint symptoms as the primary disorder or in whom the joint disorder {{was one of the}} presenting problems. Study period. I May to 31 December. 1992. Muhimhili Medical Centre. Oar es Salaam. Tanzania. 120 patients: 78 male. 42 female. One percent of all medical and orthopaedic admissions during the study period were due to rheumatic diseases. The mean age of the patients was 36) 'c';lr:-; (r~ 1 I 1 gl' ~- 76 years). There were more males (78 (65. 0 %» than females (42 (3). 0 %» (p = 0. 000). Seventy nine (6). 9 %) patients were between 11 and 40 years of age. The rheumatic disorders seen in descending order of frequency were: HIV arthropathy 32 (26. 7 %). rheumatoid arthritis 20 (16. 7 %), septic arthritis 17 (14. 2 %). Reiter's disease 14 (I I. 6 %), gout 7 (5. 8 %). osteoarth rit is 7 (5. 8 %). acute rheumatic fever 3 (2. 7 %), palindrornic rheumatism 3 (2. 7 %). haernarth rns is 2 (I. 7 %). h ypertroph ic pulmonary osteoarth ropath y 2 (I. 7 %). systemic lupus erythematosus I (0. 8 %), psoriatic arthropathy I (0. 8 %). leukaemia I (0. 8 %) and tuberculous arthritis I (0. 8 %). In 9 (7. 5 %) patients no definite diagnosis was made. More males than females suffered from H IV arthropathy and Reiter's disease. the male: female rat io being 2 : I and 3 : I respectively. More females than males suffered rrorn rheumatoid arthritis. osteuarthritis. <b>palindromic</b> <b>rheumatism</b> and acute rheumatic fever though the differences were not statistically significant. IX The mean age of patients with Reiter's disease was lowest (26 years) while till'. highest was of patients suffering from osreoarthritis (59. 5 years). The IllL~, 1 I 1 ages of patients suflering from HIV arthropathy and rheumatoid arthritis were almost similar, 35 and 34 years respectively. The youngest patient (8 years) suffered from septic arthritis while the oldest patient (76 years) suffered from HIV arthropathy. It was not possible to determine statistical associations between various rheumatic diseases and smoking, occupation, level of education and bully m,ISS index because of the small number of patients seen in each diagnostic category. Ninety-eight (81. 7 %) patients presented to the hospital after th ree weeks had passed since the onset of symptoms, wh i I e 22 (18. 3 %) had an acute presentation. In only 5 (4. 2 %) patients was there evidence of familial clustering of rheumatic diseases. The kneejoint was involved in 102 (85 %) patients while the ankle joint was involved in 42 (35 %) patients. The wrist was the commonest joint involved ill the upper limbs. being involved in 34 (28. 3 %) patients. The proximal interphalangealjoints were involved in 31 (25. 8 %) patients. III HIV arthropathy, 17 (53. 1 %) patients had ol igoarticular involvement of the joints while 8 (25. 0 %) presented with polyarthritis and 7 (21. 9 %) had monuartluitis. Fourteen (82. 4 %) patients with septic arthritis had a peripheral leucocyte count above 10, 000 cells/crnm. In only tour patients was it possible to isolate the causative organisms from the synovial fluid. There were two patients in whom beta-haemolytic streptococci were cultured. one had Streptococcus pyogenes infection and in the fourth Klebsiella species was found The extra-articular features in HIV arthropathy included lymph node enlargement (13 / 32), pustular skin lesions (2 / 32) and splenomegaly (2 / 32). The complications and extra-articular features in patients with rheumatoid arthritis were muscle wasting (3 / 20). ulnar deviation of fingers at the metacarpophalangeal joints (3 / 20), vascul itic lesions (2 / 20), lymph nude enl. ngement (2 / 20). splenomegaly (2 / 20) and hepatomegaly (2 / 20). Only one patient with rheumatoid arthritis had skin nodules. x Conclusion Eighty three (69. 2 %) of the 120 patients were unable to perform normal duties while 12 (10 %) were able to carry out normal activities on admission. On discharge. 71 (60. 1 %) out of 118 patients were unable to perform normal duties while 37 (31. 4 %) were able to perform normal activities. One hundred and two (86. 4 %) patients were followed up after 5. 8 months utter discharge. 01 these 64 (62. 7 %) were able to perform normal duties. 28 (27. 4 %) were unable to work and 3 (2. 9 %) were severely incapacitated. There were 7 (6. 9 %) deaths: two in patients with HIV arthropathy, two in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. and three in patients. one each having acute rheumatic fever. leukaemia and systemic lupus erythematosus. There were 82 patients in whom the Arthritis Impact Measurement Scale was completed at follow up. Ten (12. 2 %) patients were unable to use public transpon. f (6. 0 %) needed help in doing household activities, 4 (4. 9 %) were completely unable to do household activities. Three (3. 6 %) patients were unable {{to take care of themselves}} (needing help in washing and going to the tu iI et). The rheumatic diseases seen in developed countries are also encountered in medical practice in developing countries like Tanzania. affecting people in the productive years of life. While the prevalence of some rheumatic diseases like rheumatoid arthritis may. at present. be low. others like HIV arthropathy are likely to he seen with increasing frequency. The findings of this study suggest a need for increased awareness of rheu matic cl iseases with i n Tanzania, and consideration of how management of these diseases can be i mproved...|$|E
