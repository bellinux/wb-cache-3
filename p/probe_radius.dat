As proposed in this reference probes with different <b>probe</b> <b>radii</b> {{should be used to}} cover different frequency ranges. Within these frequency ranges the analytically determined resonance frequencies in this mansuscript are larger than that from the simulations. This is caused by a metallic adapter ring, which serves as planar impedance matching in the pMRP design.

50|$|The Shrake-Rupley {{algorithm}} is a numerical method that draws a mesh of points equidistant from each atom of the molecule {{and uses the}} number of these points that are solvent accessible to determine the surface area. The points are drawn at a water molecule's estimated radius beyond the van der Waals radius, which is effectively similar to ‘rolling a ball’ along the surface. All points are checked against the surface of neighboring atoms {{to determine whether they}} are buried or accessible. The number of points accessible is multiplied by the portion of surface area each point represents to calculate the ASA. The choice of the 'probe radius' does {{have an effect on the}} observed surface area, as using a smaller <b>probe</b> <b>radius</b> detects more surface details and therefore reports a larger surface. A typical value is 1.4Å, which approximates the radius of a water molecule. Another factor that affects the results is the definition of the VDW radii of the atoms in the molecule under study. For example, the molecule may often lack hydrogen atoms which are implicit in the structure. The hydrogen atoms may be implicitly included in the atomic radii of the 'heavy' atoms, with a measure called the 'group radii'. In addition, the number of points created on the van der Waals surface of each atom determines another aspect of discretization, where more points provide an increased level of detail.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Psychrophiles, cold-adapted organisms, {{have adapted}} to live at low {{temperatures}} by {{using a variety of}} mechanisms. Their enzymes are active at cold temperatures by being structurally more flexible than mesophilic enzymes. Even though, there are some indications of the possible structural mechanisms by which psychrophilic enzymes are catalytic active at cold temperatures, there is not a generalized structural property common to all psychrophilic enzymes. Results We examine twenty homologous enzyme pairs from psychrophiles and mesophiles to investigate flexibility as a key characteristic for cold adaptation. B-factors in protein X-ray structures are one way to measure flexibility. Comparing psychrophilic to mesophilic protein B-factors reveals that psychrophilic enzymes are more flexible in 5 -turn and strand secondary structures. Enzyme cavities, identified using CASTp at various probe sizes, indicate that psychrophilic enzymes have larger average cavity sizes at <b>probe</b> <b>radii</b> of 1. 4 - 1. 5 Å, sufficient for water molecules. Furthermore, amino acid side chains lining these cavities show an increased frequency of acidic groups in psychrophilic enzymes. Conclusions These findings suggest that embedded water molecules may {{play a significant role in}} cavity flexibility, and therefore, overall protein flexibility. Thus, our results point to the important role enzyme flexibility plays in adaptation to cold environments. </p...|$|R

40|$|SplitPocket ([URL] is a {{web server}} to {{identify}} functional surfaces of protein from structure coordinates. Using the Alpha Shape Theory, we previously developed an analytical approach to identify protein functional surfaces by the geometric {{concept of a}} split pocket, which is a pocket split by a binding ligand. Our geometric approach extracts site-specific spatial information from coordinates of structures. To reduce the search space, <b>probe</b> <b>radii</b> are designed according to the physicochemical textures of molecules. The method uses the weighted Delaunay triangulation and the discrete flow algorithm to obtain geometric measurements and spatial patterns for each predicted pocket. It can also measure the hydrophobicity on a surface patch. Furthermore, we quantify the evolutionary conservation of surface patches by an index derived from the entropy scores in HSSP (homology-derived secondary structure of proteins). We have used the method to examine ∼ 1. 16 million potential pockets and identified the split pockets in > 26 000 structures in the Protein Data Bank.

40|$|The solvent-excluded surface (SES) is {{a popular}} {{molecular}} representation that gives the boundary of the molecular volume {{with respect to a}} specific solvent. SESs depict which areas of a molecule are accessible by a specific solvent, which is represented as a spherical probe. Despite the popularity of SESs, their generation is still a compute-intensive process, which is often performed in a preprocessing stage prior to the actual rendering (except for small models). For dynamic data or varying <b>probe</b> <b>radii,</b> however, such a preprocessing is not feasible as it prevents interactive visual analysis. Thus, we present a novel approach for the on-the-fly generation of SESs, a highly parallelizable, grid-based algorithm where the SES is rendered using ray-marching. By exploiting modern GPUs, we are able to rapidly generate SESs directly within the mapping stage of the visualization pipeline. Our algorithm can be applied to large time-varying molecules and is scalable, as it can progressively refine the SES if GPU capabilities are insufficient. In this paper, we show how our algorithm is realized and how smooth transitions are achieved during progressive refinement. We further show visual results obtained from real-world data and discuss the performance obtained, which improves upon previous techniques in both the size of the molecules that can be handled and the resulting frame rate.

40|$|A {{theory is}} {{presented}} for a cylindrical electrostatic probe in a collisionless plasma {{in the case}} where the probe axis is inclined {{at an angle to}} a uniform magnetic field. The theory is applicable to electron collection, and under more restrictive conditions, to ion collection. For a probe at space potential, the theory is exact in the limit where <b>probe</b> <b>radius</b> is much less than Debye length. At attracting probe potentials, the theory yields an upper bound and an adiabatic limit for current collection. At repelling probe potentials, it provides a lower bound. The theory is valid if the ratios of <b>probe</b> <b>radius</b> to Debye length and <b>probe</b> <b>radius</b> to mean gyroradius are not simultaneously large enough to produce extrema in the probe sheath potential. The numerical current calculations are based on the approximation that particle orbits are helices near the probe, together with the use of kinetic theory to relate velocity distributions near the probe to those far from it. Probe characteristics are presented for inclination angles from 0 to 90 deg and for probe-radius mean-gyroradius ratios from 0. 1 to infinity. For an angle of 0 deg, the end-effect current is calculated separately...|$|E

The specific permanent defects governing the wear phenomena are composed of stair-rod dislocations and prismatic dislocation loops as well as vacancies. While the contact pressure for the nucleation of initial dislocation is independent on <b>probe</b> <b>radius,</b> the minimum wear depth increases with <b>probe</b> <b>radius.</b> Further analysis of the shear strain distribution implies that a larger probe results in more compliant deformation of the material, which leads to larger volume of wear debris and wider extent of defect structures.|$|E

Molecular surface [23] {{is one of the}} most important concepts in modern biochemistry and molecular biology. Albeit molecular surfaces are merely a conventional imitation of molecular boundaries, it has been shown that such models can often explain fundamental physical and chemical effects.

40|$|Calculations of {{electrostatic}} {{properties of}} protein-protein complexes are usually done within {{framework of a}} model with a certain set of parameters. In this paper we present a comprehensive statistical analysis of {{the sensitivity of the}} electrostatic component of binding free energy (ΔΔGel) with respect with different force fields (Charmm, Amber, and OPLS), different values of the internal dielectric constant, and different presentations of molecular surface (different values of the <b>probe</b> <b>radius).</b> The study was done using the largest so far set of entries comprising 260 hetero and 2148 homo protein-protein complexes extracted from a previously developed database of protein complexes (ProtCom). To test the sensitivity of the energy calculations with respect to the structural details, all structures were energy minimized with corresponding force field, and the energies were recalculated. The results indicate that the absolute value of the electrostatic component of the binding free energy (ΔΔGel) is very sensitive to the force field parameters, the minimization procedure, the values of the internal dielectric constant, and the <b>probe</b> <b>radius.</b> Nevertheless our results indicate that certain trends in ΔΔGel behavior are much less sensitive to the calculation parameters. For instance, the fraction of the homo-complexes, for which the electrostatics was found to oppose binding, is 80 % regardless of the force fields and parameters used. For the hetero-complexes, however, the percentage of the cases for which electrostatics opposed binding varied from 43 % to 85 %, depending on the protocol and parameters employed. A significant correlation was found between the effects caused by raising the internal dielectric constant and decreasing the <b>probe</b> <b>radius.</b> Correlations were also found among the results obtained with different force fields.
