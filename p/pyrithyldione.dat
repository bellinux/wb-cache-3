50|$|<b>Pyrithyldione</b> (Presidon, Persedon) is a {{psychoactive drug}} invented in 1949.An {{improved}} {{method of manufacture}} was patented by Roche in 1959. It {{was used as a}} hypnotic or sedative and presumed to be less toxic than barbiturates. Today, this substance is no longer used. Agranulocytosis was sometimes reported as adverse effect.|$|E
50|$|Saridon {{was first}} {{launched}} by Roche in 1933, initially containing <b>pyrithyldione</b> and phenacetin, widely used remedies for fever and pain. It often contained aspirin, phenacetin and caffeine, but was reformulated in 1981, replacing the original ingredient phenacetin with paracetamol, before phenacetin was {{banned by the}} US FDA in 1983. It was available in more than 80 countries across Europe, Latin America, Asia and Africa, but has been discontinued in many of them.|$|E

It can be e-mailed to: scholar@sun. ac. zaA co-crystal of two polymorphic active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), first reported and patented in 1937, has been prepared and thoroughly characterised, including crystal structure analysis. The existence of four crystal forms {{of one of the}} APIs, the sedative and hypnotic active pharmaceutical ingredient 3, 3 -diethyl- 2, 4 (1 H, 3 H) -pyridinedione, <b>pyrithyldione</b> (PYR), and of three crystal forms of the co-crystal-forming second API, the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug 1, 2 -dihydro- 1, 5 -dimethyl- 4 -(1 -methylethyl) - 2 -phenyl- 3 H-pyrazol- 3 -one, propyphenazone (PROP), has been reported previously, but they have only been partly characterised. For both compounds, none of the metastable forms exist at room temperature. DSC, hot-stage microscopy, X-ray diffraction and powder synchrotron X-ray diffraction were employed to characterise the polymorphic forms and to determine the crystal structures of forms I-III of PYR and forms I and II of PROP. Something old, something novel: Back in 1937, Hoffmann-LaRoche patented a co-crystal of the two active pharmaceutical ingredients <b>pyrithyldione</b> and propyphenazone, shown here prepared by the Kofler contact method. This is an historic example that justifies the current drive to improve physical, chemical or physiological properties by using pharmaceutical co-crystals. In addition, the crystal structures of the polymorphs of the two drug compounds have been determined for the first time by careful manipulation of the stable forms.
