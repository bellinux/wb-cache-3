25|$|As a cost {{reduction}} measure, especially in high-volume consumer receivers, all the tube heaters could be connected in series across the AC supply using heaters requiring the same current {{and with a}} similar warm-up time. In one such design, a tap on the tube heater string supplied the 6 volts needed for the dial light. By deriving the high voltage from a half-wave rectifier directly connected to the AC mains, the heavy and costly <b>power</b> <b>transformer</b> was eliminated. This also allowed such receivers to operate on direct current, a so-called AC/DC receiver design. Many different US consumer AM radio manufacturers of the era used a virtually identical circuit, given the nickname All American Five.|$|E
25|$|In the past, {{grounded}} appliances {{have been}} designed with internal isolation {{to a degree that}} allowed the simple disconnection of ground by cheater plugs without apparent problem (a dangerous practice, since the safety of the resulting floating equipment relies on the insulation in its <b>power</b> <b>transformer).</b> Modern appliances however often include power entry modules which are designed with deliberate capacitive coupling between the AC power lines and chassis, to suppress electromagnetic interference. This results in a significant leakage current from the power lines to ground. If the ground is disconnected by a cheater plug or by accident, the resulting leakage current can cause mild shocks, even without any fault in the equipment. Even small leakage currents are a significant concern in medical settings, as the accidental disconnection of ground can introduce these currents into sensitive parts of the human body. As a result, medical power supplies are designed to have low capacitance.|$|E
25|$|Alternating current {{systems can}} use {{transformers}} to change voltage from low to high level and back, allowing generation and consumption at low voltages but transmission, possibly over great distances, at high voltage, with savings {{in the cost}} of conductors and energy losses. A bipolar open-core <b>power</b> <b>transformer</b> developed by Lucien Gaulard and John Dixon Gibbs was demonstrated in London in 1881, and attracted the interest of Westinghouse. They also exhibited the invention in Turin in 1884. However these early induction coils with open magnetic circuits are inefficient at transferring power to loads. Until about 1880, the paradigm for AC power transmission from a high voltage supply to a low voltage load was a series circuit. Open-core transformers with a ratio near 1:1 were connected with their primaries in series to allow use of a high voltage for transmission while presenting a low voltage to the lamps. The inherent flaw in this method was that turning off a single lamp (or other electric device) affected the voltage supplied to all others on the same circuit. Many adjustable transformer designs were introduced to compensate for this problematic characteristic of the series circuit, including those employing methods of adjusting the core or bypassing the magnetic flux around part of a coil. The direct current systems did not have these drawbacks, giving it significant advantages over early AC systems.|$|E

40|$|Because of {{the large}} capital value of <b>power</b> <b>transformers</b> and their {{critical}} role in the electricity network, there is an increasing need for non-intrusive diagnostic and monitoring tools to assess their internal condition. The UHF technique is being applied increasingly to monitor partial discharges (PD) in <b>power</b> <b>transformers</b> and {{has been shown to be}} much more sensitive than acoustic techniques when the signal path passes through solid insulation. Field trials were performed on five <b>power</b> <b>transformers</b> ranging in size from 18 to 1000 MVA and in voltage from 25 to 400 kV.

2500|$|The {{desire to}} power {{electronic}} equipment using AC mains power faced a difficulty {{with respect to}} the powering of the tubes' filaments, as these were also the cathode of each tube. Powering the filaments directly from a <b>power</b> <b>transformer</b> introduced mains-frequency (50 or 60Hz) hum into audio stages. The invention of the [...] "equipotential cathode" [...] reduced this problem, with the filaments being powered by a balanced AC <b>power</b> <b>transformer</b> winding having a grounded center tap.|$|E
2500|$|A {{microwave}} oven converts {{only part of}} its electrical input into microwave energy. An average consumer {{microwave oven}} consumes 1100 W of electricity in producing 700 W of microwave power , an efficiency of 64%. [...] The other 400 W are dissipated as heat, mostly in the magnetron tube. [...] Such wasted heat, along with heat from the product being microwaved, is exhausted as warm air through cooling vents. [...] Additional power is used to operate the lamps, AC <b>power</b> <b>transformer,</b> magnetron cooling fan, food turntable motor and the control circuits, although the power consumed by the electronic control circuits of a modern microwave oven is negligible (< 1% of the input power) during cooking.|$|E
2500|$|In America, George Westinghouse who {{had become}} {{interested}} in the <b>power</b> <b>transformer</b> developed by Gaulard and Gibbs, began to develop his AC lighting system, using a transmission system with a 20:1 step up voltage with step-down. In 1890 Westinghouse and Stanley built a system to transmit power several miles to a mine in Colorado. A decision was taken to use AC for power transmission from the Niagara Power Project to Buffalo, New York. Proposals submitted by vendors in 1890 included DC and compressed air systems. [...] A combination DC and compressed air system remained under consideration {{until late in the}} schedule. [...] Despite the protestations of the Niagara commissioner William Thomson (Lord Kelvin) the decision was taken to build an AC system, which had been proposed by both Westinghouse and General Electric. In October 1893 Westinghouse was awarded the contract to provide the first three 5,000hp, 250 rpm, 25Hz, two phase generators.|$|E
40|$|In current practice, {{product design}} and process design of low <b>power</b> <b>transformers</b> are done {{sequentially}} in which {{quite a number}} of activities are mainly performed by engineers. Therefore, the time for the development of low <b>power</b> <b>transformers</b> {{and the quality of the}} product and process design are largely dependent on the experience of the engineers. In this paper, an artificial intelligence technique, case-based reasoning, is introduced to perform the concurrent product and process design of low <b>power</b> <b>transformers</b> from which a prototype concurrent design system for low <b>power</b> <b>transformers,</b> named CBS-TX, was developed. The prototype system aims to assist design engineers in formulating a configurable design of low <b>power</b> <b>transformers</b> in short time and provide the process information in the early design stage.

40|$|The {{aims of the}} Master's thesis {{project are}} to {{investigate}} the data {{of the characteristics of}} insulating oil of 30 / 110 / 10 kV autotransformers AT- 2 (Jonava), AT- 1 (Kruonis) and 110 / 35 / 10 kV <b>power</b> <b>transformers</b> T- 1 and T- 2 (Kruonis) during their maintenance period; to analyze the chemical parameters of oil; to determine the importance of the factors for assessing the nature of the defects; and to compare the data of analyses. The assessment of the condition of <b>power</b> <b>transformers</b> and prognosis of the defects is an important and quite challenging task, which affects the safety and reliability of the work of various devices and the entire electrical system. A constant and regular control of insulating oil of <b>power</b> <b>transformers</b> significantly reduces the damages and breakdowns and their consequences. Statistically, the <b>power</b> <b>transformers</b> are the most damageable appliance. The reliability of <b>power</b> <b>transformers</b> considerably decreases due to the period of their exploitation.

2500|$|Other early {{customers}} included Pete Townshend and John Entwistle of The Who, whose {{search for}} extra volume led Marshall {{to design the}} classic 100-watt valve amplifier.

Four of these amplifiers were built and delivered to Pete Townshend, and the Marshall Super Lead Model 1959, the original Plexi, was born in 1965. At the request of Pete Townshend, Marshall produced an 8Ã—12-inch cabinet (soon replaced {{by a pair of}} 4Ã—12-inch cabinets) on top of which the 1959 amplifier head was placed, giving rise to the Marshall stack, an iconic image for rock and roll. The size of the wall of Marshall stacks [...] "soon became an indicator of the band's status", even when rendered obsolete by improved PA systems; indeed, many of the [...] "ridiculously huge arrays of heads and cabs" [...] included dummies. Still, most modern 100-watt heads have roots in Marshall's design, even though they often contain many more features (or different tubes, such as the more American-sounding 6L6 tubes).|$|E
