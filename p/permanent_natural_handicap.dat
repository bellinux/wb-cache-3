40|$|The Less Favoured Areas (LFAs) Directive (75 / 268) {{which was}} {{introduced}} in 1975, was the first common European instrument of regional agricultural structural policy. LFAs are areas where agriculture is hampered by <b>permanent</b> <b>natural</b> <b>handicaps.</b> The major objectives were to ensure the continuation of farming, thereby maintaining a minimum population level and preserving scenic landscapes and environmentally valuable habitats. In the Netherlands, the LFA measure is used as an additional payment, to compensate farmers for negative economic effects due to the conservation of these <b>natural</b> <b>handicaps.</b> It was not implemented as a stand alone policy, but is linked to measures aiming at active nature and landscape conservation management. In this paper, the effects will be examined of the regulations aiming at the conservation of <b>natural</b> <b>handicaps</b> on farm businesses within LFAs, when comparing them to farm businesses outside LFAs, where these regulations and handicaps do not exist. The main data source that was used is the Farm Accountancy Data Network. Reference groups of farms were compiled {{with the use of}} the simple and multiple imputation approach in Stars (Statistics for Regional Studies). Both analyses were tested with the use of a parametric and a nonparametric test. When comparing the results of both analyses, it can be concluded that there is no evidence that there is a statistical difference in family farm income corrected for and not corrected for LFA payment between the LFA farm businesses and the reference groups. Based on these findings it can be concluded that the size of the compensatory allowances is small and there is no evidence that it has a significant effect on the family farm income of LFA farm businesses. The main purpose of the Dutch LFA policy is to compensate farm businesses for negative economic effects due to the conservation of <b>natural</b> <b>handicaps.</b> Although this may be true for some individual farms, based on the methods used in this paper, it appears not to be the case for the collectivity of LFA premium beneficiaries as a whole.

40|$|In {{order to}} assess {{agricultural}} areas with <b>natural</b> <b>handicaps,</b> the European Commission proposed a set of biophysical criteria. In this report all criteria were applied to the Dutch agricultural areas. The application of the criteria showed that four criteria led to the delineation of areas with <b>natural</b> <b>handicaps.</b> The handicaps were soil drainage, texture, chemical properties and slope. The criteria for low temperature, heat stress, rooting depth and soil moisture balance were not applicable to the Dutch agricultural soils. All results were aggregated to LAU 2 units (municipality). An area at the scale of LAU 2 units was considered affected by significant <b>natural</b> <b>handicaps</b> if at least 66 % of the Utilised Agricultural Areas met {{at least one of}} the biophysical criteria.

30|$|Since 1975, the {{designation}} of Less-Favoured Areas (LFAs) within the CAP recognises the specific features of areas presenting agro-ecological constraints (lack of water, climate, unfavourable soil and terrain characteristics, short crop season and tendencies of depopulation), including mountainous or hilly features. However, pastoralism in the EU is mostly associated with mountainous ecosystems areas which exist in southern {{as well as in}} northern Europe, where mobile livestock rearing is also practiced outside mountainous environments. LFAs benefit from different forms of compensatory allowances, i.e. the LFA payments - now called <b>Natural</b> <b>Handicap</b> Payments, and from a number of payments for structural adjustment.

30|$|Through {{the second}} axis of this pillar, farmers could receive {{compensation}} for sustainable land management, for instance, putting into practice agricultural {{activities that are}} more environmentally demanding than legally mandatory requirements. Typical instances for pastoralists include those of High Nature Value (HNV) areas, which mainly consist of semi-natural grasslands and are managed under farming systems characterised by low stocking densities, low levels of agro-chemical inputs and often labour intensive management practices such as shepherding. Examples of HNV farmland are alpine meadows and pasture. These low-intensity farming systems {{are associated with a}} high species and habitat diversity or the presence of species of European conservation concern (EC 2006 a). These areas may benefit from payments that could either compensate for <b>natural</b> <b>handicaps</b> or remunerate for specific agro-environmental measures.|$|R

We considered three different categories of handicap that should negatively impact falcons: missing remiges and rectrices, broken remiges and rectrices, and foot handicaps.

40|$|In {{the long}} term, {{productivity}} and especially productivity growth are necessary {{conditions for the}} survival of farms and the food industry in Finland. The <b>natural</b> <b>handicap</b> and small farm size are challenges, but farmers are further challenged by the decoupling of supports and their transformation into direct income payments. Additionally, farmers actions are limited by some institutional settings that substantially reduce incentives to improve productivity. Technical progress was found to drive the increase in productivity on grain farms in Finland. The scale had only a moderate effect and for the whole study period (19762006) the effect was close to zero. Total factor productivity (TFP) increased, depending on the model, by 0. 61. 7 % per year. The results demonstrated that the increase in productivity was hindered by the policy changes introduced in 1995. The cumulative increase in TFP over the study period was at the same level as the measured yearly changes in TFP. The results highlight the nature of grain farming in Finland as well as the challenges in simultaneously taking into account the general trend and yearly variation in TFP. ...|$|R
