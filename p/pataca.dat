5|$|Usage of the Octopus {{card was}} {{extended}} to Macau and the Chinese city of Shenzhen in 2006. In collaboration with China UnionPay, Octopus Cards Limited introduced Octopus card usage to two Fairwood restaurants in Shenzhen in August 2006. In 2008, five Café de Coral locations in Shenzhen also started accepting Octopus. Value cannot be reloaded to Octopus cards in Shenzhen, but the Automatic Add Value Service is available to automatically deduct money value from a customer's credit card to reload an Octopus card. The two Fairwood restaurants in Shenzhen that were enabled for Octopus card payments are located at Luohu Commercial City and Shenzhen Railway Station. Shenzhen became the first city outside Hong Kong in which Octopus cards may be accepted as payment. In Macau, the Octopus card was introduced in December 2006 when two Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurants in the territory adopted its usage as payment. Similar to its usage in Shenzhen, an Octopus card may not be reloaded in Macau, and the currency exchange rate between the Macanese <b>pataca</b> and the Hong Kong dollar when using an Octopus card is MOP1:HKD1. The two Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurants in Macau that adopted the Octopus card for payment are located at the Rua Do Campo and the Sands Casino.|$|E
25|$|The <b>pataca</b> was {{introduced}} in Portuguese Macau and Portuguese Timor in the year 1894, but only as a unit of account. The unit initially corresponded to the Mexican dollar, and it replaced the Portuguese real {{at a rate of}} 1 <b>pataca</b> = 450 reais. The name <b>pataca</b> derives {{from the fact that the}} Portuguese always referred to the Mexican dollar as the <b>pataca</b> mexicana.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the initial}} issues of <b>pataca</b> {{banknotes}} in 1906, the new currency was supplemented {{the following year}} by 10 and 25 <b>pataca</b> notes, and in February 1920, 5, 10 and 50 avo notes were added. In 1923, the Banco Vui Hang introduced 10 <b>pataca</b> notes which stated that they were backed by Cantonese 20 cent coins. These notes were followed until 1934 by cashier's cheques issued by various banks in denominations of 1, 5, 10, 50, 100, 200, 400, 800 and 1000 dollars, presumably equivalent to the <b>pataca.</b> The BNU issues were augmented by 1 and 20 avo notes in 1942, and in 1944, 500 <b>pataca</b> notes were introduced. Also in 1944, further cashier's cheques were issued, denominated 1000 yuan and NC$5000. The 25 <b>pataca</b> note was discontinued after 1958.|$|E
25|$|Brass 10, 20 and 50 avos and {{cupro-nickel}} 1 and 5 <b>patacas</b> {{were introduced}} in 1982. The 20 avos and 5 <b>patacas</b> became dodecagonal in 1993 and 1992, respectively, whilst a bimetallic 10 <b>patacas</b> was introduced in 1997 and a cupronickel 2 <b>patacas</b> in 1998. Coins are issued by the Monetary Authority of Macau.|$|R
50|$|In 1912, the Banco Nacional Ultramarino {{introduced}} notes (dated 1910) in denominations of 1, 5, 10 and 20 <b>patacas.</b> 25 <b>patacas</b> {{notes from}} Macao also circulated. In 1940, notes of 5, 10 and 50 avos were introduced. Some of these notes were overprints of Macanese notes, {{as were the}} 5, 25 and 100 <b>patacas</b> notes introduced in 1945. The same year, specific issues for Timor were introduced in denominations of 1, 5, 10, 20 and 25 <b>patacas,</b> followed by 20 avos in 1948.|$|R
50|$|Macau has {{distributed}} {{funds to}} all residents, permanent and non-permanent, since 2008, {{as part of}} the region's Wealth Partaking Scheme. In 2014, the government distributed 9,000 <b>patacas</b> (approx. US$1,127) to each permanent resident, and 5,400 <b>patacas</b> ($676) to non-permanent residents.|$|R
25|$|Although the <b>pataca</b> is {{the legal}} tender of Macau, the Hong Kong dollar is almost universally {{acceptable}} in the Region, and in some cases, is preferred to the <b>Pataca.</b> Circulation of the <b>pataca</b> is mandated by a decree (Decreto-Lei n.º 16/95/M) prohibiting refusal by merchants, but some casinos flout this rule and refuse bets in patacas. The Hong Kong dollar and Chinese yuan are generally accepted throughout Macau from casinos to restaurants. Payments to government agencies can also be made in both Hong Kong dollars and patacas.|$|E
25|$|Macau has a {{currency}} board system {{under which the}} legal tender, Macau <b>pataca</b> is 100 percent backed by foreign exchange reserves, in this case currently the Hong Kong dollar. Moreover, the currency board, Monetary Authority of Macau (AMCM), has a statutory obligation to issue and redeem Macau <b>pataca</b> on demand against the Hong Kong dollar at a fixed exchange rate of HK$1 = MOP$1.032, and without limit.|$|E
25|$|In 1935, when Hong Kong and China {{abandoned}} the silver standard, the Hong Kong unit was pegged to sterling {{at a rate}} of 1 shilling and 3 pence, while the Macau <b>pataca</b> was pegged to the Portuguese escudo {{at a rate of}} 5.5 escudos. This meant that the Macau <b>pataca</b> was worth only 1 shilling sterling and was therefore at a discount of 3 pence sterling in relation to the Hong Kong unit.|$|E
25|$|The {{exchange}} rate is pegged and is approximately MOP$1.03 for HK$1. For United States dollars, {{to which the}} Hong Kong dollar is in turn loosely pegged, the {{exchange rate}} is around 8 <b>patacas</b> to 1 US dollar. Although {{it is possible to}} exchange <b>patacas</b> in Macau, it is either difficult or impossible to do so elsewhere. The few places in Hong Kong where <b>patacas</b> are available are concentrated on Cleverly Street in Central, a short distance from the Hong Kong-Macau Ferry Terminal.|$|R
50|$|Hong Kong Dollar {{is widely}} {{accepted}} in Macau, {{even though it}} hasn't gained any official recognition from Autoridade Monetária de Macau (AMCM) as legal tender in Macau. Currently, Macauese Pacata is pegged to Hong Kong Dollar at 1.029(buy)/1.032(sell). However, many merchants who accept Hong Kong Dollars may now offer to pay the difference between 2 currencies, such practice is often called '不补水' in Chinese. If merchandise priced in <b>Patacas</b> is paid in Hong Kong Dollars, and if merchants practice '不补水', prices in <b>Patacas</b> may be rounded up to the equivalent in Hong Kong Dollars, and merchants would offer change in Hong Kong dollars. Or the amount of Hong Kong Dollars paid would be automatically transformed into <b>Patacas</b> and merchants would then offer change in <b>Patacas.</b>|$|R

25|$|In 2012, the Banco Nacional Ultramarino and Banco de China issued {{ten million}} 10 <b>pataca</b> {{banknotes}} {{to commemorate the}} Year of the Dragon, and from 2012–2023, the Banco National Ultramarino and the Banco da China are each authorized to issue a maximum number of 20 million special notes with the face value of 10 patacas to mark each lunar new year. The Bank of China also issued a 100 <b>pataca</b> banknote to commemorate its centennial anniversary.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} {{the nineteenth}} century, there was no single {{currency}} in use in Macau, but the predominant circulating coins were the silver Mexican dollars, the British silver trade dollars of Hong Kong and the Straits Settlements, as well as the silver dollars and fractional coinage of the neighbouring province of Canton. In 1901, it was decided to have a uniquely Macau currency, and for that purpose, the Banco Nacional Ultramarino was granted exclusive rights to issue legal tender banknotes that were to be denominated in patacas. On January 27, 1906, <b>pataca</b> notes in denominations of 1, 5, 50 and 100 were introduced and all foreign coinage was outlawed, the idea being to make the <b>pataca</b> paper notes the sole legal tender currency in Macau. However, the Chinese, being so accustomed to using silver for barter, were suspicious of this new paper money, and as such, the paper <b>pataca</b> always circulated at a discount in relation to the silver dollar coins. On the contrary, a similar action at exactly the same time in the Straits Settlements, and for the same purpose, had the different effect of putting the new Straits dollar into the gold exchange standard. Hence both the Macau <b>pataca</b> and the Straits dollar were launched at a sterling value of 2 shillings and 4 pence, but where the Straits dollar remained at that value until the 1960s, the Macau <b>pataca</b> fluctuated with the value of silver, just like the Hong Kong unit.|$|E
25|$|In 2008, the Macau {{branch of}} the Bank of China issued four million 20 <b>pataca</b> {{banknotes}} in commemoration of the 29th Summer Olympic Games in Beijing.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{the fact}} that the <b>pataca</b> is the {{official}} currency of Macau, most of the money in circulation in the Region is actually Hong Kong dollars. Patacas accounted for only 29.9% of Macau's money supply at the end of 1998.|$|E
25|$|The first {{exclusively}} Macau coinage was not introduced {{until the}} year 1952, which {{happened to be the}} year after the last <b>pataca</b> fractional coins were minted for East Timor. In that year in Macau, denominations below 10 patacas were replaced by coins.|$|E
25|$|The escudo {{was used}} in the Portuguese mainland, the Azores and Madeira, with no {{distinction}} of coins or banknotes. In Portugal's African colonies, the escudo was generally used up to independence, with Portuguese and sometime local coins circulating alongside banknotes of the Banco Nacional Ultramarino, rather than those of the Bank of Portugal used on the mainland. For more details, see the escudos of Angola, Cape Verde, Mozambique, Portuguese Guinea and São Tomé and Príncipe. Only Cape Verde continues to use the escudo. In Macau, the currency during the colonial period was, as it is today, the <b>pataca.</b> Timor-Leste adopted the escudo whilst still a Portuguese colony, having earlier used the <b>pataca.</b> Portuguese India adopted the escudo before it was annexed by India.|$|E

25|$|In the two Special Administrative Regions of the People's Republic of China, {{arrangements}} {{are similar to}} those in the UK; in Hong Kong, three commercial banks are licensed to issue Hong Kong dollar notes, and in Macau, banknotes of the Macanese <b>pataca</b> are issued by two different commercial banks.

2500|$|In Macau, {{the unit}} of {{currency}} is the <b>pataca,</b> which is currently pegged to the Hong Kong dollar {{at a rate of}} HK$1= MOP1.03. The name <b>pataca</b> is a Portuguese word which was applied to the Mexican dollars that were the main circulating coin in the wider region {{in the second half of}} the 19th century. In 1894, the <b>pataca</b> was introduced in both Macau and Portuguese Timor as a unit of account for the Mexican dollar and the other silver dollar coins in circulation. However, the <b>pataca</b> was not the official currency when it was first enacted. In 1901, it was decided to grant the Banco Nacional Ultramarino the exclusive rights to issue banknotes denominated in patacas, and in the year 1906, all foreign coins were outlawed. However, the Chinese were suspicious of these paper patacas, being so accustomed to using silver for barter, and as such, the paper patacas circulated at a discount in relation to the silver dollar coins. In 1935, when China and Hong Kong abandoned the silver standard, the Hong Kong dollar was pegged to sterling at the fixed rate of 1 shilling and 3 pence, whereas the <b>pataca</b> was pegged to the Portuguese escudo at a sterling equivalent rate of only 1 shilling. From 1945 to 1951, fractional coins of the <b>pataca</b> were minted for issue in Portuguese Timor; and, in 1952, similar issues were minted for Macau including an actual <b>pataca</b> coin for the first time.|$|E
2500|$|On August 8, 1988, BNU {{issued a}} 1000 <b>pataca</b> {{banknote}}, the highest value banknote yet. Because 8 in Chinese (ba) {{is similar to}} [...] "getting rich" [...] (fa; [...] ), this unique date, which occurs only once per century, gives the note a special meaning. Another feature is {{the replacement of the}} Coat of arms of Portugal with BNU's logo, shedding a political symbol in the prospect of reunification with China. In 1995, the Banco da China introduced notes in denominations of 10, 50, 100, 500 and 1000 patacas. Both the BNU and Banco da China introduced 20 <b>pataca</b> notes in 1996.|$|E

5000|$|Ho {{was arrested}} on 27 February 2016 as he was {{boarding}} a ferry to Hong Kong, and was charged with 1,536 counts of a criminal nature - {{the largest number of}} charges in Macau’s history. Alleged crimes included initiating or founding a criminal syndicate, forgery, fraud and money laundering. Principally, Ho allegedly conspired to award and personally benefit from some 2,000 public contracts worth more than 167 million <b>patacas</b> (US$20 million) between 2004 and 2014. Ho and nine co-defendants were estimated to have pocketing at least 44 million <b>patacas</b> (US$5.3 million). Ho is said to have conspired with relatives to set up 10 shell companies, which were then used to obtain outsourcing contracts from the prosecutor's office. During the trial, his driver Mak Hak Neng admitted in court to having transported bags of cash - from 100 to 300,000 <b>patacas</b> each time - on Ho's behalf and deposited in an individual bank account in Zhuhai under Ho's name.|$|R
