5000|$|Up {{until the}} American Revolutionary War, {{most of the}} colonial {{conflicts}} in North America, {{if they were not}} amphibious operations, took place in the wilderness. Most of the first British colonists in the region were farmers and merchants, not soldiers. At the onset of the Colony of Virginia they underwent military drilling and fortified their settlements. However, this practice was soon abandoned and a militia system was adopted. Regular militias consisted of all able males from 16-60 years of age who used their own firearms and served without <b>pay.</b> <b>Training</b> was minimal and occurred once a year, at which point militiamen would have to demonstrate their proficiency with their weapons. In the areas under the greatest threat from Native Americans, the militias would garrison several fortified dwellings, though militiamen usually defended their own homes. From these militias, paid [...] "rangers" [...] were hired to patrol the frontier line and occasionally conduct offensive raids on Native American villages.|$|E

50|$|An {{infantry}} battalion is numbered ordinarily {{within its}} regiment (e.g., 1st Battalion, The Rifles, usually {{referred to as}} 1 Rifles). It normally has a headquarters company, support company, and three rifle companies (usually, but not always, A, B and C companies). Each company is commanded by a major, the officer commanding (OC), with a captain or senior lieutenant as second-in-command (2IC). The HQ company contains signals, quartermaster, catering, intelligence, administration, <b>pay,</b> <b>training,</b> operations and medical elements. The support company usually contains anti-tank, machine gun, mortar, pioneer and reconnaissance platoons. Mechanised units usually have an attached light aid detachment (LAD) of the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers (REME) to perform field repairs on vehicles and equipment. A British battalion in theatre during World War II had around 845 men in it, and, as of 2012, a British battalion had around 650 soldiers. With successive rounds of cutbacks after the war, many infantry regiments were reduced to a single battalion (others were amalgamated to form large regiments which maintained multiple battalions, e.g., the Royal Anglian Regiment).|$|E

40|$|Liberal {{market economies}} used to govern {{workplace}} employment relationships through collective bargaining. This institution has been allowed, or encouraged, to wither. The {{assumption is that}} governance {{at the level of}} the workplace will produce efficiency and also fairness. The evidence for this assumption is questionable, as illustrated by the limited take-up of claimed efficiency-inducing practices and growing inequality and work pressures. Thinking in terms of ‘beneficial constraints ’ helps to identify ways in which regulation through constraints can in fact produce long-term gains. Concrete ways of putting these ideas into effect do not necessarily imply new regulations. A key need is to make existing rights meaningful and to encourage genuine dialogue about firms ’ strategic options. This paper has three key terms and one argument linking them together.

40|$|Abstract—The {{evaluation}} of employee’s performance {{is the most}} important and probably the most complicated task for every supervisor or manager working in any organization. Performance appraisal is intended to improve overall performance of organization by engaging and aligning each employee. Performance Appraisal (PA) provides a basis for identifying and correcting disparities in employee’s performance. PA may also provide the basis for other personnel actions like bonus <b>pay,</b> <b>training</b> & career development, promotion & placement, recognition & rewards and disciplinary actions, its success depends primarily on the system and measures (criteria), work culture, the attitudes and involvement of participants in PA process.

In the whole process probably ‘rating ’ {{is the most important}} and crucial steps which involves human judgment and perception which inherently leads to the vagueness in taking decision or Fuzzy decisions. This paper proposes stage-wise fuzzy reasoning model for performance rating...|$|E
