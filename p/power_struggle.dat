5|$|After {{losing their}} {{remaining}} South African lands in 1840, Mzilikazi and his tribe permanently {{settled in the}} southwest of present-day Zimbabwe in {{what became known as}} Matabeleland, establishing Bulawayo as their capital. Mzilikazi then organised his society into a military system with regimental kraals, similar to those of Shaka, which was stable enough to repel further Boer incursions. Mzilikazi died in 1868 and, following a violent <b>power</b> <b>struggle,</b> was succeeded by his son, Lobengula.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, the Habsburgs had been {{involved}} in a major <b>power</b> <b>struggle</b> with the French kings of the House of Valois over the control of the remains of the realm of Charles the Bold, whose daughter and heiress Mary Maximilian had married. Maximilian's second marriage in 1493 with Bianca Maria Sforza from Milan then got the Habsburgs directly involved in the Italian Wars, clashing again with the French kings over the control of the Duchy of Milan.|$|E
5|$|Domesday {{makes it}} obvious that Urse {{was the most}} {{powerful}} layman in Worcester, and {{the only person who}} could contest his power in the county was the Bishop of Worcester.

Only one other layman is recorded as having a castle in Worcestershire in Domesday, and he held much less land than Urse.|$|E

40|$|Organizational teams {{frequently}} {{come into}} conflict with one another over limited resources. Core theories of intergroup conflict suggest that such inter-team resource conflicts unite teams internally, reducing intra-team <b>power</b> <b>struggles.</b> However, conflict spill-over theory suggests that inter-team conflicts may also stimulate competitive power dynamics within teams. We reconcile these two opposing lines of thought by introducing the internal power structure of teams as the key moderator that determines whether inter-team conflict reduces or promotes <b>power</b> <b>struggles</b> within teams. We theorize that while the common fate of members of egalitarian teams makes them likely to unite and pool resources when facing an inter-team conflict, the power differences in hierarchical teams cause members to be differently impacted by the resource-threatening inter-team conflict, leading them to have different perspectives and concerns, thereby promoting internal fights over resources (i. e., <b>power</b> <b>struggles).</b> In turn, such <b>power</b> <b>struggles</b> are expected to negatively affect team performance. We tested these hypotheses with a laboratory study of 85 three-person negotiation teams and a field study of 158 organizational work teams, and find, as expected, that a resource-threatening inter-team conflict promotes performance-detracting <b>power</b> <b>struggles</b> in hierarchical (but not egalitarian) teams...|$|R
5|$|Finnish {{society had}} {{experienced}} rapid population growth, industrialization, pre-urbanization {{and the rise}} of a comprehensive labor movement. The country's political and governmental systems were in an unstable phase of democratization and modernization, while the people's socioeconomic condition and national-cultural status gradually improved. World War I led to the collapse of the Russian Empire and a <b>power</b> <b>struggle,</b> militarization and escalating crisis between the left-leaning Finnish labor movement and the Finnish conservatives.|$|E

After his release, he headed north through Placerita Canyon, saw the mining operation, and was determined to search for gold near where he later established Sutter's Fort; the latter in Mexican territory.|$|E
5|$|Later {{that same}} year, Khánh became {{involved}} in a <b>power</b> <b>struggle</b> with his deputy Khiêm as well as Minh, who had been retained as the titular head of state. Thảo {{was a close friend}} of Khiêm, so when Khánh prevailed in the <b>power</b> <b>struggle,</b> Khánh despatched Khiêm to Washington as the ambassador with Thảo was his press attaché. In August 1964, Khánh's leadership became increasingly troubled after he tried to augment his powers by declaring a state of emergency. This only provoked large-scale protests and riots calling for an end to military rule, with Buddhist activists at the forefront. Fearful of losing power, Khánh began making concessions to the protesters and promised democracy in the near future, which encouraged more groups to demand changes, and Khánh demoted certain Catholic pro-Diệm supporters. On 13 September, a Catholic-dominated group led by Generals Lâm Văn Phát and Dương Văn Đức, both of whom had been demoted, moved troops into Saigon but then withdrew after it became obvious they did not have the numbers to remove Khánh. Khiêm and Thảo were implicated in helping to plot Phát and Đức's attempted putsch; both were sent abroad by Khánh.|$|E

5|$|After {{the death}} of Vladimir Lenin in January 1924, {{there was a brief}} <b>power</b> <b>struggle</b> in the Soviet Union, from which Joseph Stalin rose to take the reins of power. Armenian society and its economy were changed by Stalin and his fellow Moscow policymakers. In 1936, the TSFSR was {{dissolved}} under Stalin's orders and the socialist republics of Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia were established instead. For the Armenian people, conditions grew worse under Stalin's rule. In a period of twenty-five years, Armenia was industrialized and educated under strictly prescribed conditions, and nationalism was harshly suppressed.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the exact}} {{details of the}} {{assassination}} remain disputed, {{the involvement of the}} Portuguese government, particularly Aginter Press or PIDE, is generally accepted by most historians and biographers and is supported by the Portuguese stay behind Gladio-esque army, known as Aginter Press, that suggested in 1990 that they were responsible for the assassination. Initially, due to the uncertainty regarding who was responsible, Mondlane's death created great suspicion within the ranks of the FRELIMO itself and a short <b>power</b> <b>struggle</b> which resulted in a dramatic swing to the political left.|$|E
5|$|Arriving in Colorado, McDonald {{found himself}} at the centre of another <b>power</b> <b>struggle.</b> Sympathetic {{to the fact that}} his wife was less than two weeks away from giving birth, head coach Don Cherry gave McDonald {{permission}} to leave the team on off-days to return to his wife in Toronto. But he did so without gaining the approval of general manager Ray Miron, who disagreed frequently with Cherry and fired him following the season. On the ice, McDonald scored 35goals with the Rockies and finished with a total of 40 between the two teams.|$|E

5|$|As the {{national}} commander of Los Zetas, Treviño Morales earned a notorious reputation for intimidating officials and citizens throughout Mexico. The Mexican authorities {{believe that he}} is responsible for {{a significant part of the}} violence in Mexico, including the murder of 72 migrants in 2010 and the massacre of 193 people in 2011. A common torture method of his was known as guiso (stew), in which victims would be dumped into oil barrels, doused with gasoline and burned alive. Following the death of his boss Lazcano Lazcano in October 2012, Treviño Morales became his successor and the top leader of Los Zetas drug cartel amid an internal <b>power</b> <b>struggle</b> within the organization.|$|E
5|$|Besides their {{obligations}} as obedient, peaceful and nonpolitical {{inhabitants of the}} Grand Duchy, who had a few decades earlier accepted the class system as {{the natural order of}} their life, the commoners began to ask for and demand their civil rights and citizenship in Finnish society. The <b>power</b> <b>struggle</b> between the Finnish estates and the Russian administration gave a concrete role model and free space for the labor movement. On the other side, due to at least a century-long tradition and experience of administrative leadership, the Finnish elite saw itself as the inherent natural power.|$|E
5|$|Central African Republic President David Dacko, Bokassa's cousin, {{took over}} the country in 1960, after winning a <b>power</b> <b>struggle</b> against Abel Goumba.

By 1965, the country was in turmoil—plagued by {{corruption}} and slow economic growth, while its borders were breached by rebels from neighboring countries. Dacko obtained financial aid from the People's Republic of China, {{but in spite of}} this support, the country's problems persisted.
