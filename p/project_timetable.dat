40|$|Carnegie Mellon University has {{undertaken}} a research, development, and demonstration program to enable a robotic lunar mission. The two-year mission scenario is to traverse 1, 000 kilometers, revisiting the historic sites of Apollo 11, Surveyor 5, Ranger 8, Apollo 17, and Lunokhod 2, and to return continuous live video amounting {{to more than}} 11 terabytes of data. Our vision blends autonomously safeguarded user driving with autonomous operation augmented with rich visual feedback, in order to enable facile interaction and exploration. The resulting experience is intended to attract mass participation and evoke strong public interest in lunar exploration. The encompassing program that forwards this work is the Lunar Rover Initiative (LRI). Two concrete technology demonstration projects currently advancing the Lunar Rover Initiative are: (1) The Dante/Mt. Spurr project, which, {{at the time of}} this writing, is sending the walking robot Dante to explore the Mt. Spurr volcano, in rough terrain that is a realistic planetary analogue.

40|$|This {{development}} {{program is a}} joint effort among the Northeast Gas Association (formerly New York Gas Group), Foster-Miller, Inc., and the US Department of Energy (DOE) through the National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL). The DOE's contribution to this project is $ 572, 525 {{out of a total}} of $ 772, 525. The present report summarizes the accomplishments of the project during its third three-month period (from April 2003 through June 2003). The project was initiated with delay in February 2003 due to contractual issues that emerged between NGA and Foster-Miller, Inc. The two organizations are working diligently to maintain the program's pace and expect to complete it in time. The efforts of the project focused during this period in finalizing the assessment of the tether technology, which is intended to be used as the means of communication between robot and operator. Results indicate that the tether is a viable option under certain pipeline operating conditions, but not all. Concerns also exist regarding the abrasion resistance of the tether, this issue being the last studied. Substantial work was also conducted on the design of the robotic platform, which has progressed very well. Finally, work on the MFL sensor, able to negotiate all pipeline obstacles (including plug valves), was initiated by PII following the successful completion of the subcontract negotiations between Foster-Miller and PII.

The proposed algorithm for this automatic scheduling system could generate optimal presentation timetable and enables direct interaction with lecturers in order to gather data of their availability time among other its functionalities.

40|$|M. F. A. University of Hawaii at Manoa 2012. Includes bibliographical references. In {{order to}} fulfill the thesis {{requirements}} for an MFA degree in dance, I will choreograph three new works for the Fall Footholds concert from October 10 - 14, 2012. This concert will be performed in the Earl Ernst Lab Theatre. By choreographing these three new works, utilizing three innovative examples of fine art as inspiration, I hope to challenge and expand my choreographic abilities and broaden my skills and knowledge as a dance artist. The connection between visual art and movement is the inspiration for my proposed works. I have always found visual art intriguing and {{believe that there is}} an existing relationship between it and dance. Therefore, my goal is to produce movement that reflects and replicates the pieces of artwork that I have chosen. The three artworks are from a collection of different sea glass sculptures from artist, Jonathan Fuller. All three of my dances will incorporate still frame photographs projected on the cyclorama. Each artwork has inspired me to create movement; hence, the movement will reflect the sea glass and the overall structure of the sculptures. The total length of my choreographic works will be approximately 15 minutes. Though each sculpture contains similarities, {{such as the use of}} sea glass and wood and the texture and gradients of color, there are vast differences between each work. For the purpose of clarity, I will include a written description of these differences for each artwork and use them in creating movement. I believe that these descriptions aid me in choreographing the essence of each sculpture. Since I will be using images of Jonathan Fuller's sculptures within my work, copyright permission will be needed. I recently contacted Fuller via email and received his approval. To keep my cast and committee informed, I have created a private Facebook group titled, "Elyse's MFA Thesis. " This group will be used as a way for me to communicate with some of my dancers who will be off island during the summer. I will use this group page to post rehearsal updates, any information and rehearsal footage.
