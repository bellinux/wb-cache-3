Methods We evaluated 22 dogs (8 sham controls, 7 treated with autologous bone marrow monocytes, and 7 with stromal cells) using both imaging of 111 Indium-tropolone labeled cells and late gadolinium enhancement CMR for up to 12 weeks after a 3 hour coronary occlusion.

40|$|AbstractPurposeTo study {{intermediate}} clinical outcomes, {{rates of}} recurrent varicosities and neovascularisation, ultrasound {{changes of the}} GSV, {{and the quality of}} life changes in patients from EVOLVeS trial. MethodsForty five patients were re-examined 1 year and 65 two years after treatment. Follow-up visits included clinical examination with CEAP classification and calculation of venous clinical severity score (VCSS), ultrasound examination, and a quality of life questionnaire. ResultsThe clinical course of the disease (CEAP, VCSS) was similar in the two treatment groups. 51 % of the GSV trunks occluded by RFO underwent <b>progressive</b> <b>shrinkage</b> with the external diameter decreased from 6. 3 SD 1. 4  mm at 72  h after treatment to 2. 9 SD 1. 5  mm at 2 years. An additional 41 % of the GSV became undetectable by ultrasound at 2 -year follow up. In two patients we observed re-opening of an initially closed GSV lumen. Neovascularisation was found in one RFO case and in four S and L cases. Cumulative rates of recurrent varicose veins at combined 1 and 2 years follow-up were 14 % for RFO and 21 % for S and L (NS). The difference in global QOL score in favour of RFO re-appeared at 1 year and remained significant at 2 years after treatment. ConclusionThe 2 -year clinical results of radiofrequency obliteration are at least equal to those after high ligation and stripping of the GSV. In the vast majority of RFO patients the GSV remained permanently closed, and underwent <b>progressive</b> <b>shrinkage</b> to eventual sonographic disappearance. Recurrence and neovascularisation rates were similar in the two groups although limited patient numbers prevent reliable statistical analysis.

40|$|PURPOSE. To {{monitor and}} measure {{dendritic}} shrinkage of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) in {{a strain of}} transgenic mice (Thy- 1 YFP) that expresses yellow fluorescent proteins in neurons {{under the control of}} a Thy- 1 promoter. METHODS. A total of 125 RGCs from 16 eyes of Thy- 1 YFP transgenic mice were serially imaged with a confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscope for 6 months after optic nerve crush. Quantitative analysis of cell body area, axon diameter, dendritic field, number of terminal branches, total dendritic branch length, branching complexity, symmetry, and distance from the optic disc was used to characterize the morphology of RGCs, describe the patterns of axonal and dendritic degeneration, identify the morphologic predictors for cell survival, and estimate the rate of dendritic shrinkage. RESULTS. RGC damage was observed prospectively to begin with <b>progressive</b> dendritic <b>shrinkage,</b> followed by loss of the axon and the cell body. In a small proportion of RGCs, progressive axonal changes including fragmentation, beading, retraction, and bulb formation were also observed. RGCs with a larger dendritic field and a longer total dendritic branch length in general have a better survival probability. The rate of dendritic shrinkage was variable with a slower rate observed in cells having a larger dendritic field, a longer total dendritic branch length, and a greater distance from the optic disc. CONCLUSIONS. Estimating the probability of RGC survival and measuring the rate of dendritic shrinkage could become a new paradigm for investigating neuronal degeneration and evaluating the response of neuroprotective treatment. © 2011 The Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology, Inc. postprin...|$|R

40|$|Evidence-based {{guidelines}} {{for the management of}} localized perinatal adrenal neuroblastoma are not yet available. We describe our preliminary experience managing this tumor with a "wait and see" policy. A single-center prospective study (February 2002 to December 2009) was conducted with 12 consecutive patients in whom an adrenal mass was detected antenatally or within the first 3 months of life. Diagnostic workup included the following investigations: measurement of urine catecholamine metabolites, imaging studies (ultrasonography, magnetic resonance imaging, or computed tomography), metaiodobenzylguanidine scintigraphy, and/or core needle biopsy. The male/female ratio was 1. 4 : 1. 0. Median tumor size at presentation was 29 mm (range 10 - 50 mm). Eight lesions were detected antenatally. Ten lesions were diagnosed as localized neuroblastoma. Of these ten lesions, four were excised because of parental preference (n = 2), tumor enlargement (n = 1) or tumor persistence (n = 1). The remaining six patients underwent watchful clinical observation, which showed <b>progressive</b> tumor <b>shrinkage</b> and complete regression within 10 - 39 months (median 12. 5 months). The final two lesions were small predominantly cystic lesions without a clear-cut diagnosis. They were managed noninvasively. At an overall median follow-up of 109 months (range 30 - 122 months), all patients are alive and disease-free, although one patient progressed to stage 4 disease despite early excision of the primary tumor. Spontaneous regression of localized perinatal adrenal neuroblastoma occurs often, and a "wait and see" strategy seems justified in these small infants. Patients with enlarging or stable lesions that have persisted for several months may benefit from surgery, although prompt excision may not prevent tumor progression...|$|R

40|$|PurposeQuantifying {{the extent}} of conjunctival {{fibrosis}} for documentation of progression in conjunctival scarring disease is a clinical challenge. Measurement of forniceal foreshortening facilitates monitoring of these disorders. This study aims (1) to define {{the limits of the}} normal human conjunctival fornices and how these alter with age and (2) to provide normative data for upper and lower fornix depths (FDs) and fornix intercanthal distance (FICD) within a healthy South Asian, racially distinct population. DesignEpidemiologic, cross-sectional study. ParticipantsA total of 240 subjects with national origins from South Asia, with no known ocular history and normal adnexal and conjunctival examination, aged 20 to 80 years. MethodsAn FICD modification of a custom-designed fornix depth measurer (FDM) was validated and used for measurement of both lower and upper FDs together with FICDs in 480 healthy eyes with no ocular comorbidities. Data were analyzed using repeated-measures analysis of variance and presented as means with 95 % confidence intervals (CIs). Main Outcome MeasuresMean lower and upper FDs and FICD for the entire cohort, stratified according to age decade and sex. ResultsFor this South Asian population, the overall upper and lower FDs were 15. 3 mm (95 % CI, 14. 9 – 15. 6) and 10. 9 mm (95 % CI, 10. 7 – 11. 1), respectively, with FICD defined as 32. 9 mm (95 % CI, 32. 5 – 33. 4) (upper) and 31. 7 mm (95 % CI, 31. 3 – 32. 1) (lower). With increasing age, a progressive reduction of all measured parameters (P[*]<[*] 0. 001) was noted, with female subjects having significantly shallower fornices (upper FD, P[*]<[*] 0. 001; lower FD, P[*]<[*] 0. 001; upper FICD, P = 0. 081; and lower FICD, P = 0. 015). ConclusionsThis is the first study to define the limits of normal upper FD and FICDs in any population group. Our study demonstrates sex variations and <b>progressive</b> conjunctival <b>shrinkage</b> with age.

40|$|Abstract Background To {{evaluate}} {{the performance of}} surface-based deformable image registration (DR) for adaptive radiotherapy of {{non-small cell lung cancer}} (NSCLC). Methods Based on 13 patients with locally advanced NSCLC, CT images acquired at treatment planning, midway {{and the end of the}} radio- (n = 1) or radiochemotherapy (n = 12) course were used for evaluation of DR. All CT images were manually [gross tumor volume (GTV) ] and automatically [organs-at-risk (OAR) lung, spinal cord, vertebral spine, trachea, aorta, outline] segmented. Contours were transformed into 3 D meshes using the Pinnacle treatment planning system and corresponding mesh points defined control points for DR with interpolation within the structures. Using these deformation maps, follow-up CT images were transformed into the planning images and compared with the original planning CT images. Results A <b>progressive</b> tumor <b>shrinkage</b> was observed with median GTV volumes of 170 cm 3 (range 42 cm 3 - 353 cm 3), 124 cm 3 (19 cm 3 - 325 cm 3) and 100 cm 3 (10 cm 3 - 270 cm 3) at treatment planning, mid-way and at the end of treatment. Without DR, correlation coefficients (CC) were 0. 76 ± 0. 11 and 0. 74 ± 0. 10 for comparison of the planning CT and the CT images acquired mid-way and at the end of treatment, respectively; DR significantly improved the CC to 0. 88 ± 0. 03 and 0. 86 ± 0. 05 (p = 0. 001), respectively. With manual landmark registration as reference, DR reduced uncertainties on the GTV surface from 11. 8 mm ± 5. 1 mm to 2. 9 mm ± 1. 2 mm. Regarding the carina and intrapulmonary vessel bifurcations, DR reduced uncertainties by about 40 % with residual errors of 4 mm to 6 mm on average. Severe deformation artefacts were observed in patients with resolving atelectasis and pleural effusion, in one patient, where the tumor was located around large bronchi and separate segmentation of the GTV and OARs was not possible, and in one patient, where no clear shrinkage but more a decay of the tumor was observed. Discussion The surface-based DR performed accurately for the majority of the patients with locally advanced NSCLC. However, morphological response patterns were identified, where results of the surface-based DR are uncertain. </p...|$|R
40|$|Holocene lake level {{fluctuations}} were reconstructed from a 2. 7 -m sediment core from Nam Co, Central Tibet, China {{dating to}} > 7. 2 cal ka BP. Results {{were compared to}} existing lake records from the Tibetan Plateau to infer variations in {{the strength of the}} Asian Monsoon. Geomorphological features in the Nam Co catchment, such as beach ridges and lake terraces, indicate high lake stands during the late Glacial. A major low stand is suggested for the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). Sands and sandy silts {{at the base of the}} core are transgressive facies, with material transported by melt water and deposited under rising lake level conditions that followed the LGM low stand. Variations in grain size, major elements, biomarker stable isotopes and minerals in the core suggest a climate evolution reflected in at least five depositional units and subunits. Sediments in Unit I (similar to 7. 2 to similar to 5. 4 cal ka BP) were deposited at highest lake levels. Large amounts of allogenic minerals and allochthonous organic matter suggest high precipitation and melt water input, implying positive water balance. Increasing aquatic productivity points to favourable environmental conditions. Unit II (similar to 5. 4 to similar to 4. 0 cal ka BP) marks a transition between favourable, stable hydrological conditions and lake level decrease. Lower lake levels were a consequence of drier climate with less monsoonal precipitation, higher evaporation rates, and increased moisture recycling in the catchment. Unit III (similar to 4. 0 to similar to 1. 4 cal ka BP) reflects the driest periods recorded, at similar to 3. 7 cal ka BP and 1. 6 cal ka BP. Lake shrinkage and salinization was interrupted as suggested by the deposition of Unit IV (similar to 1. 4 to similar to 0. 8 cal ka BP), when increased precipitation and runoff that might be related to the Medieval Warm Period, led to a stable, but still low lake level. Unit V (800 cal years BP-present) is characterized by <b>progressive</b> lake <b>shrinkage</b> due to intense evaporation. Large fluctuations in geochemical variables indicate humid and arid periods, respectively, at Nam Co between similar to 450 and similar to 200 cal years BP, with the latter assumed to correspond to the Little Ice Age. Modern hydrological data indicate the lake level is rising. Comparison of the Nam Co record with other lake records from the Tibetan Plateau suggests general agreement with the broader picture of Holocene environmental evolution. The timing of dry and wet climate conditions at lake sites across Tibet indicates a gradually decreasing influence of the southern monsoon during the Holocene, from NW to SE. Nevertheless, further research is needed to improve our understanding of Holocene spatio-temporal hydrological variations across the Asian continent...|$|R

40|$|A {{confocal}} scanning laser ophthalmoscope (CSLO) {{was used}} to image the axonal and dendritic aborizations of RGCs in the Thy- 1 YFP mice. With quantitative analysis of cell body area, axon diameter, dendritic field, number of terminal branches, total dendritic branch length, branching complexity, symmetry and distance from the optic disc, the morphologies of RGCs and the patterns of axonal and dendritic degeneration were analyzed. After optic nerve crush, RGC damage was observed prospectively to begin with <b>progressive</b> dendritic <b>shrinkage,</b> followed by loss of the axon and the cell body. Similar pattern of RGC degeneration was observed after 90 minutes of retinal ischemia although no morphological changes were detected when the duration of ischemia was shortened to 30 minutes. The rate of dendritic shrinkage was variable and estimated on average 2. 0 % per day and 11. 7 % per day with linear mixed modeling, after optic nerve crush and retinal ischemic injury, respectively. RGCs with a larger dendritic field had a slower rate of dendritic shrinkage. In summary, we demonstrated that dendritic shrinkage could be evident even before axonal degeneration after optic nerve crush and retinal ischemic injury. We have established a methodology for in vivo and direct visualization of RGCs and retinal microglia, which could provide reliable and early markers for neuronal damage. Measuring the rate of dendritic shrinkage and tracking the longitudinal activation of microglia would provide new paradigms to study the mechanism of neurodegenerative diseases and offer new insights in testing novel therapies for neuroprotection. Progressive neuronal cell death and microglial activation are the key pathological features in most neurodegenerative diseases. While investigating the longitudinal profiles of neuronal degeneration and microglial activation is pertinent to understanding disease mechanism and developing treatment, analyzing progressive changes has been obfuscated {{by the lack of}} a non-invasive approach that allows long term, serial monitoring of individual neuronal and microglial cells. Because of the clear optical media in the eye, direct visualization of the retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and microglia is possible with high resolution in vivo imaging technique. In this study, we developed experimental models to visualize and characterize the cellular morphology of RGCs and retinal microglia in vivo in the Thy- 1 YFP and the CX 3 CR 1 +/GFP transgenic mice, described the patterns of axonal and dendritic shrinkage of RGCs, discerned the dynamic profile of microglial activation and investigated the relationship between RGC survival and microglial activation after optic nerve crush and retinal ischemic injury induced by acute elevation of intraocular pressure. The longitudinal profile of microglial activation was investigated by imaging the CX 3 CR 1 GFP/+ transgenic mice with the CSLO. Activation of retinal microglia was characterized with an increase in cell number reaching a peak at a week after optic nerve crush and retinal ischemic injury, which was followed by a gradual decline falling near to the baseline at the 4 th week. The activation of retinal microglia was proportional to the severity of injury. The number of RGCs survival at 4 weeks post-injury was significantly associated with the number of activated retinal microglia. Li, Zhiwei. Adviser: Leung Kai Shun.

40|$|Abstract Ageing is a <b>progressive</b> <b>shrinkage</b> of the homeodynamic space and, at the {{molecular}} level, it {{is associated with the}} stochastic occurrence and pro-gressive accumulation of molecular damage. Imper-fection of the maintenance and repair systems results in the failure of homeodynamics characterized by increased molecular heterogeneity, altered cellular functioning, reduced stress tolerance and reduced remodeling and adaptation, which lead to increased probability of diseases and eventual death. Although, several types of molecular damages have been shown to accumulate and increase molecular heterogeneity during ageing, its relevance and significance with respect to the physiology, survival and longevity remains to be determined. Such studies are essential for establishing biomarkers of health, frailty, remod-eling and adaptation, and for developing effective methods for the prevention and reversion of age-related changes. A promising strategy for ageing intervention and modulation is that of strengthening the homeodynamics through repeated mild stress-induced hormesis by physical, biological and nutri-tional hormetins. Because a number of ethical, social, and personal implications emerge by the develop-ment and use of anti-ageing and life-extending technologies, biogerontologists should incorporate these elements while developing their research agenda in biogerontology...|$|E

Single or multiple exposure to low doses of otherwise harmful agents, such as irradiation, food limitation, heat stress, hypergravity, {{reactive oxygen species}} and other free radicals {{have a variety of}} anti-aging and longevity-extending hormetic effects. Detailed molecular mechanisms that bring about the hormetic effects are being increasingly understood, and comprise a cascade of stress response and other pathways of maintenance and repair. Although the extent of immediate hormetic effects after exposure to a particular stress may only be moderate, the chain of events following initial hormesis leads to biologically amplified effects that are much larger, synergistic and pleiotropic. A consequence of hormetic amplification is an increase in the homeodynamic space of a living system in terms of increased defence capacity and reduced load of damaged macromolecules. Hormetic strengthening of the homeodynamic space provides wider margins for metabolic fluctuation, stress tolerance, adaptation and survival. Hormesis thus counter-balances the <b>progressive</b> <b>shrinkage</b> of the homeodynamic space, which is the ultimate cause of aging, diseases and death. Healthy aging may be achieved by hormesis through mild and periodic, but not severe or chronic, physical and mental challenges, and by the use of nutritional hormesis incorporating mild stress-inducing molecules called hormetins.

It examines, in particular, the role that trading and post-trading FMIs, and their new regulatory regime, are playing in the expansion of ‘public’ securities and derivatives markets, and the <b>progressive</b> <b>shrinkage</b> of ‘private’ markets (which broadly coincide with the ‘unregulated’ or ‘less regulated’ over-the-counter (OTC) markets). The paper provides an overview of the policy approaches underlying the international crisis-era reforms to FMIs, and {{focuses on the}} dichotomy between the ‘systemic risk’ and ‘transaction costs’ approaches to financial markets and FMIs regulation. By reviewing the current move from ‘private’ markets to ‘public’ markets internationally, and with respect to the EU and US regimes, we analyze the role of trading infrastructures as liquidity providers, both in the securities markets and in the derivatives markets. And, shifting the focus to post-trading infrastructures – central clearing houses (CCPs), central securities depositories (CSDs), and trade repositories (TRs) – we address their role in supporting financial stability and market transparency. We conclude by identifying how regulators are now more deeply involved in FMIs’ governance and operation. We argue that such policy approach resulted in regulatory initiatives which move in the direction of increasing the systemic scope of FMIs, introducing elements of publicity in private markets, and calling for higher public supervision...|$|E
40|$|We herein {{provide a}} {{thorough}} description of new transgenic mouse models for dentatorubral–pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) harboring a single {{copy of the}} full-length human mutant DRPLA gene with 76 and 129 CAG repeats. The Q 129 mouse line was unexpectedly obtained by en masse expansion based on the somatic instability of 76 CAG repeats in vivo. The mRNA expression levels of both Q 76 and Q 129 transgenes were each 80 % of that of the endogenous mouse gene, whereas only the Q 129 mice exhibited devastating progressive neurological phenotypes {{similar to those of}} juvenile-onset DRPLA patients. Electrophysiological studies of the Q 129 mice demonstrated age-dependent and region-specific presynaptic dysfunction in the globus pallidus and cerebellum. <b>Progressive</b> <b>shrinkage</b> of distal dendrites of Purkinje cells and decreased currents through α-amino- 3 -hydroxy- 5 -methyl- 4 -isoxazolepropionic acid and γ-aminobutyrate type A receptors in CA 1 neurons were also observed. Neuropathological studies of the Q 129 mice revealed progressive brain atrophy, but no obvious neuronal loss, associated with massive neuronal intranuclear accumulation (NIA) of mutant proteins with expanded polyglutamine stretches starting on postnatal day 4, whereas NIA in the Q 76 mice appeared later with regional specificity to the vulnerable regions of DRPLA. Expression profile analyses demonstrated age-dependent down-regulation of genes, including those relevant to synaptic functions and CREB-dependent genes. These results suggest that neuronal dysfunction without neuronal death is the essential pathophysiologic process and that the age-dependent NIA is associated with nuclear dysfunction including transcriptional dysregulations. Thus, our Q 129 mice should be highly valuable for investigating the mechanisms of disease pathogenesis and therapeutic interventions...|$|E
40|$|BackgroundAutologous recellularization of decellularized {{heart valve}} {{scaffolds}} is a promising {{challenge in the}} field of tissue-engineered heart valves and could be boosted by bone marrow progenitor cell mobilization. The aim {{of this study was to}} examine the spontaneous in vivo recolonization potential of xenogeneic decellularized heart valves in a lamb model and the effects of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor mobilization of bone marrow cells on this process. MethodsDecellularized porcine aortic valves were implanted in 12 lambs. Six lambs received granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (10 μg·kg− 1 ·d− 1 for 7 days, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor group), and 6 received no granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (control group). Additionally, nondecellularized porcine valves were implanted in 5 lambs (xenograft group). Angiographic and histologic evaluation was performed at 3, 6, 8, and 16 weeks. ResultsFew macroscopic modifications of leaflets and the aortic wall were observed in the control group, whereas <b>progressive</b> <b>shrinkage</b> and thickening of the leaflets appeared in the granulocyte colony-stimulating factor and xenograft groups. In the 3 groups progressive ovine cell infiltration (fluorescence in situ hybridization) was observed in the leaflets and in the adventitia and the intima of the aortic wall but not in the media. Neointimal proliferation of α-actin–positive cells, inflammatory infiltration, adventitial neovascularization, and calcifications were more important in the xenograft and the granulocyte colony-stimulating factor groups than in the control group. Continuous re-endothelialization appeared only in the control group. ConclusionDecellularized xenogeneic heart valve scaffolds allowed partial autologous recellularization. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor led to accelerated heart valve deterioration similar to that observed in nondecellularized xenogeneic cardiac bioprostheses...|$|E

40|$|To {{establish}} the therapeutic potential of low-intensity ultrasound, it is fundamentally important to characterize its biophysical interactions with living cells. Here, {{through a series}} of single-cell direct observations, we show that low-intensity ultrasound pulsing would give rise to a dynamic course of cytomechanical perturbations at both the membrane and nucleus levels. Our investigation was conducted using a composite platform that coupled a 1 MHz ultrasound exposure hardware to a confocal microscopy system. Short ultrasound pulses (5 cycles; 2 kHz pulse repetition frequency) with 0. 24 W/cm 2 spatial-peak, time-averaged intensity (0. 85 MPa peak positive acoustic pressure) were delivered over a 10 min period to adherent Neuro- 2 a neuroblastoma cells, and live imaging of cellular dynamics was performed before, during, and after the exposure period. Bright-field imaging results showed <b>progressive</b> <b>shrinkage</b> of cellular cross-sectional area (25 - 45 %; N = 7) during low-intensity ultrasound pulsing; the initial rate of size decrease was estimated to be 8 - 14 % per min. This shrinkage was found to be transient, as the sonicated cells had recovered (at a rate of size increase of 0. 4 - 0. 9 % per min) to their pre-exposure size within 30 min after the end of exposure. 3 -D confocal imaging results further revealed that: (i) ultrasound-induced membrane contraction was volumetric in nature (21 - 45 % reduction); (ii) concomitant decrease in nucleus volume was evident (12 - 25 % reduction). Altogether, these findings demonstrate that low-intensity ultrasound pulsing, if applied on the order of minutes, would reversibly perturb the physical and subcellular structures of living cells...|$|E
40|$|International audienceConcerns {{regarding}} vaccine safety {{have emerged}} following reports of potential adverse events in both humans and animals. In the present study, alum, alum-containing vaccine and alum adjuvant tagged with fluorescent nanodiamonds {{were used to}} evaluate i) the persistence time at the injection site, ii) the translocation of alum from the injection site to lymphoid organs, and iii) the behavior of adult CD 1 mice following intramuscular injection of alum (400 mu g Al/kg). Results showed {{for the first time}} a strikingly delayed systemic translocation of adjuvant particles. Alum-induced granuloma remained for a very long time in the injected muscle despite <b>progressive</b> <b>shrinkage</b> from day 45 to day 270. Concomitantly, a markedly delayed translocation of alum to the draining lymph nodes, major at day 270 endpoint, was observed. Translocation to the spleen was similarly delayed (highest number of particles at day 270). In contrast to C 57 BL/ 6 J mice, no brain translocation of alum was observed by day 270 in CD 1 mice. Consistently neither increase of Al cerebral content, nor behavioral changes were observed. On the basis of previous reports showing alum neurotoxic effects in CD 1 mice, an additional experiment was done, and showed early brain translocation at day 45 of alum injected subcutaneously at 200 mu g Al/kg. This study confirms the striking biopersistence of alum. It points out an unexpectedly delayed diffusion of the adjuvant in lymph nodes and spleen of CD 1 mice, and suggests the importance of mouse strain, route of administration, and doses, for future studies focusing on the potential toxic effects of aluminum-based adjuvants...|$|E
40|$|Fresh and frozen-stored mitochondrial, microsomal, and {{endoplasmic}} reticulum extracts of blood leucocytes act as potent alloantigens in human recipients. Similar results were obtained with freshly prepared extracts consisting of mixtures of all cytoplasmic fractions; storage of such mixtures at [...] 20 C, followed by 1 - 2 hr thawing at 37 C abrogated {{their capacity to}} induce allograft sensitivity in 45 of 47 recipients. Donor-specific skin allografts and grafts from other sources exhibited significant attenuations in the tempo and intensity of rejection, ranging from first-set rejection to chronic rejection and/or to prolongations in allograft survival. In contrast with the 66. 2 % rejection rate of first-set skin grafts at 10 days in 71 normal subjects, only 29 % of skin grafts from the leucocyte donor applied to 24 recipients of 0. 1 to 9 Transplantation Antigen (T. A.) units of pooled cytoplasmic mixtures were rejected by that time. Only 17. 4 % similar grafts in 23 recipients of 25 to 515 T. A. units were rejected at 10 days. Seventeen skin grafts placed on recipients of 45 to 140 T. A. units of the same cytoplasmic preparation exhibited a slow rejection characterized by <b>progressive</b> <b>shrinkage</b> and eventual disappearance, with no evidence of hemorrhagic necrosis (chronic skin graft rejection). These results support {{the possibility that the}} attenuations in allograft reactivity observed in patients with end-stage renal disease after blood transfusions {{may be related to the}} leucocyte components of such transfusions. The capacity of blood transfusions to decrease reactivity to renal allografts in uremic patients maintained on hemodialysis stands in contrast with the ability of such transfusions to sensitize normal human recipients to donor-specific skin allografts. The differential effect may be related to the immunosuppressed state(s) documented in the uremic population, and/or the use of immunosuppressive drug therapy in such patients at the time of transplantation and thereafter...|$|E
40|$|Flavonoids {{display a}} wide range of {{pharmacological}} properties including anti-inflammatory. Anti-mutagenic, anti-carcinogenic and anti-cancer effects. Here, we evaluated the effects of eight flavonoids on the tumour cell proliferation, cellular protein phosphorylation, and matrix metalloproteinase (MMPs) secretion. Of the flavonoids examined, luteolin (Lu) and quercetin (Qu) were the two most potent agents, and significantly inhibited A 431 cell proliferation with IC 50 values of 19 and 21 [*]μM, respectively. The epidermal growth factor (EGF) (10 [*]nM) promoted growth of A 431 cells (+ 25 ± 4. 6 %) and mediated epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase activity and autophosphorylation of EGFR were inhibited by Lu and Qu. At concentration of 20 [*]μM, both Lu and Qu markedly decreased the levels of phosphorylation of A 431 cellular proteins, including EGFR. A 431 cells treated with Lu or Qu exhibited protuberant cytoplasmic blebs and <b>progressive</b> <b>shrinkage</b> morphology. Lu and Qu also time-dependently induced the appearance of a ladder pattern of DNA fragmentation, and this effect was abolished by EGF treatment. The addition of EGF only marginally diminished the inhibitory effect of luteolin and quercetin on the growth rate of A 431 cells, treatment of cellular proteins with EGF and luteolin or quercetin greatly reduced protein phosphorylation, indicating Lu and Qu may act effectively to inhibit {{a wide range}} of protein kinases, including EGFR tyrosine kinase. EGF increased the levels of matrix metalloproteinase- 2 (MMP- 2) and matrix metalloproteinase- 9 (MMP- 9), while Lu and Qu appeared to suppress the secretion of these two MMPs in A 431 cells. Examination {{of the relationship between the}} chemical structure and inhibitory effects of eight flavonoids reveal that the double bond between C 2 and C 3 in ring C and the OH groups on C 3 ′ and C 4 ′ in ring B are critical for the biological activities. This study demonstrates that the inhibitory effects of Lu and Qu, and the stimulatory effects of EGF, on tumour cell proliferation, cellular protein phosphorylation, and MMP secretion may be mediated at least partly through EGFR. This study supports the idea that Lu and Qu may have potential as anti-cancer and anti-metastasis agents...|$|E
40|$|AbstractWith {{the advent}} of {{multisensor}} micromanometric/velocimetric catheterization, digital angiography and Doppler and color echocardiography, extensive fluid dynamic quantitation is now possible in cardiology. Such high fidelity instantaneous measurements offer the clinician the prospect of identifying phasic changes in ventricular ejection dynamics that may disclose contraction abnormalities before overt muscle or pump failure is manifested. Accordingly, this review provides a basis for interpreting these measurements and a conceptual framework for understanding ventricular ejection dynamics with and without outflow obstruction. Necessary terminology and fluid dynamic background, including properties of flows generated by large transient forces, Euler and unsteady Bernoulli equations and local and convective acceleration gradients, are reviewed first. Physiologic aspects of ejection dynamics and transvalvular and intraventricular gradients without obstruction are discussed. Maximal outflow acceleration, rather than ejection velocity, coincides with the attainment of the early peak of the nonobstructive pressure gradients. These gradients are characteristically even more asymmetric than are the associated ejection velocity signals. Clinical correlations are introduced, beginning with obstructive transvalvular and subvalvular gradients in aortic stenosis and the phenomenon of recovery of pressure loss in the poststenotic dilation. The large obstructive gradients tend to be distinctively symmetric, as are the ejection waveforms, whose configuration they track more or less closely, depending {{on the degree of}} stenosis and relative preponderance of convective effects throughout ejection. Pitfalls in some unwarranted applications of the “simplified Bernoulli equation” are pointed out. Polymorphic gradients of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, refecting dynamically dissimilar intraventricular low regimes in early, mid and late systole, are examined. Enormous late systolic gradients can be associated with <b>progressive</b> <b>shrinkage</b> of flow passage area and sharp increases in linear velocity while volumetric outflow is diminutive. The concept of ventriculoannular disproportion in dilated ventricles is defined and discussed. The implications of ejection fluid dynamics for systolic ventricular and myocardial loading are examined, and the concept of complementarity and competitiveness between intrinsic and extrinsic load components is introduced. Finally, critical research issues are identified and addressed. The primary emphasis is on using the basic principles of fluid dynamics to better understand ejection in the normal or abnormal human left ventricle and aortic root. To this end, results mainly from clinical multisensor micromanometric/velocimetric catheterization studies—but also from pertinent animal experiments and noninvasive echocardiographic and Doppler investigations—have been used as resources. It is the rapidly increasing convergence of high fidelity invasive and noninvasive measurements with advances in the hemodynamics of unsteady intracardiac blood flow that makes ejection research an exciting topic with promise of continuing significant clinical contributions...|$|E
