40|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that spatial heterogeneity is key to the coexistence at local spatial scales of subordinate and dominant predator species by allowing the former to shift to more protective habitats when the risk of intraguild predation exists. Here, we show how the smaller carnivore Egyptian mongoose (Herpestes ichneumon) may coexist on a local scale with its intraguild pre- dator, the Iberian lynx (Lynx pardinus), by using places with different microhabitat character- istics. We expect that mongooses living within lynx home ranges will use denser and more protective habitats when active in order to di- minish their risk of being killed by lynx com- <b>pared</b> <b>to</b> <b>those</b> living in areas similar in ve- getation and prey availability but where lynx are absent. The scrubland cover of points used by mongooses outside lynx areas, and that of points located within lynx areas but not used by mongooses, were significantly lower than, or similar to, cover of points used by mongooses within lynx areas. The probability of finding mongoose tracks was constant across levels of scrubland cover when lynx were absent, but more mongoose tracks were likely to be found in thicker scrubland within lynx areas, especially if these areas were intensively used by lynx. This result agrees with the hypothesis on shifts in microhabitat use of subordinate carnivores to prevent fatal or risky encounters with dominant ones. Peer Reviewe...|$|R

A lifting line representation of the blade aerodynamics is coupled to Brown's Vorticity Transport Model to simulate the aerodynam- ics of the rotor systems. The acoustic ¯eld is determined using the Ffowcs Williams-Hawkings equation. Acoustic analysis shows that the principal contribution to noise radiated by both the coaxial and equivalent single rotor systems is at the fundamental blade passage frequency, but that the coaxial rotor generates higher sound pressure levels (by 10 dB for the evaluated con¯gurations) than the equivalent single rotor at all °ight speeds. The sources of blade vortex interaction (BVI) noise are investigated and the principal BVI events are identi¯ed. For the coaxial rotor, the most intense impulsive noise is seen to be generated by the inter-rotor BVI on the advancing side of the lower rotor. The impulsive noise that is generated by blade vortex interactions for the equivalent single rotor reduces in amplitude as the strength of BVI events on the rotor decreases with forward speed. Conversely, the BVI noise of the coaxial rotor intensi¯es with increasing °ight speed due to the increasing strength {{of the interaction between}} the wake of the upper rotor and the blades of the lower rotor. The impulsive noise due to BVI for the coaxial rotor is found to be higher by 2035 dB compared to the equivalent single rotor.

Indeed, symmetric double radio galaxies are {{only a small percentage}} of the total content of ra- dio loud cluster galaxies, which show mainly tailed morphologies (e. g. O’Dea & Owen, 1985). Moreover, cluster mergers can deeply affect the statistical properties of their radio activity. In order to better understand the morphological and radio activity differences of the radio galaxies in major mergeing and non/tidal-merging clusters, we performed a multifrequency study of extended radio galax- ies inside two cluster complexes, A 3528 and A 3558. They belong to the innermost region of the Shapley Concentration, the most massive con- centration of galaxy clusters (termed supercluster) in the local Universe, at average redshift z ≈ 0. 043. We analysed low frequency radio data performed at 235 and 610 MHz with Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) and we combined them with proprietary and literature observations, in order to have a wide frequency range (150 MHz to 8. 4 GHz) to perform the spectral analysis. The low frequency images allowed us to carry out a detailed study of the radio tails and diffuse emission found in some cases. The results in the radio band were also qualitatively compared with the X-ray information coming from XMM-Newton observations, in order to test the interaction between radio galaxies and cluster weather. We found that the brightest central galaxies (BCGs) in the A 3528 cluster complex are powerful and present substantial emission from old relativistic plasma characterized by a steep spectrum (α > 2). In the light of observational pieces of evidence, we suggest they are possible re-started radio galaxies. On the other hand, the tailed radio galaxies trace the host galaxy motion with respect to the ICM, and our find- ings is consistent with the dynamical interpretation of a tidal interaction (Gastaldello et al. 2003). On the contrary, the BCGs in the A 3558 clus- ter complex are either quiet or very faint radio galaxies, supporting the hypothesis that clusters mergers quench the radio emission from AGN...|$|R

Whereas both EHV- 1 and EHV- 4 produce well-documented respiratory syndromes in equids, {{the contribution of}} EHV- 2 and EHV- 5 to disease of the respiratory tract is still enigmatic. This study describes the detection and genetic characterization of EHVs from equids with and without clinical respiratory disease. Virus-specific PCRs were used to detect EHV- 1, - 2, - 4 and - 5. From the total of 160 equids with respiratory disease, EHV- 5 was detected at the highest prevalence (23. 1 %), followed by EHV- 2 (20. 0 %), EHV- 4 (8. 1 %) and EHV- 1 (7. 5 %). Concurrent infections with EHV- 2 and EHV- 5 were recorded from nine (5. 2 %) diseased horses. Of the total of 111 clinically healthy equids, EHV- 1 and EHV- 4 were never detected whereas EHV- 2 and EHV- 5 were found in 8 (7. 2 %) and 18 (16. 2 %) horses, respec- tively. A significantly higher proportion of EHV- 2 -infected equids was observed in the respiratory disease group (32 / 160, 20. 0 %; P = 0. 005) com- <b>pared</b> <b>to</b> <b>those</b> without disease (8 / 111; 7. 2 %). EHV- 2 -positive equids were {{three times more likely}} to display clinical signs of respiratory disease than EHV- 2 -negative equids (OR 3. 22, 95 % CI: 1. 42 – 7. 28). For EHV- 5, the observed difference was not statistically significant (P = 0. 166). The phyloge- netic analysis of the gB gene revealed that the Ethiopian EHV- 2 and EHV- 5 strains had a remarkable genetic diversity, with a nucleotide sequence identity among each other that ranged from 94. 0 to 99. 4 % and 95. 1 to 100 %, respec- tively. Moreover, the nucleotide sequence identity of EHV- 2 and EHV- 5 with isolates from other countries acquired from GenBank ranged from 92. 9 to 99. 1 % and 95. 1 to 99. 5 %, respectively. Our results suggest that besides EHV- 1 and EHV- 4, EHV- 2 is likely to be an important contributor either to induce or predispose equids to respiratory disease. However, more work is needed to better understand the contribution of EHV- 2 in the establishment of respiratory disease...|$|R

40|$|Heat {{transfer}} measurements {{around the}} centreline circumference of a cylinder in crossflow are {{performed in a}} wind tunnel. The cylinder is placed at several stations downstream of three turbulence-generating grids with different geometries and different blockage ratios σ g : a reg- ular grid (RG 60) with σ g = 32 %, a fractal-square grid (FSG 17) with σ g = 25 % and a single- square grid (SSG) with σ g = 20 %. Measurements are performed at 20 stations for 3 nominal Reynolds numbers (based on the diameter D of the cylinder) Re ∞ = 11 100, 24 500, 37 900. Hot-wire measurements are performed along the centreline, without the cylinder in place, to characterise the flow downstream of the grids. The extent of the turbulence production region, where the turbulence intensity Tu increases with the streamwise distance x from the grid, is higher for SSG and more so for FSG 17 than for RG 60. The angular profiles of the Nusselt number Nu are measured in the production regions of these two grids and are com- <b>pared</b> <b>to</b> <b>those</b> obtained in the decay regions, where Tu decreases with x. This comparison is made at locations with approximately same Tu. It is found that, for SSG, Nu/Re 0. 5 {{on the front of}} the cylinder (boundary layer region) is lower in the production region than in the decay region. This is explained by the presence of clear and intense vortex shedding in the production region of SSG which reduces the turbulent fluctuations which are “effective” in enhancing the heat transfer across a laminar boundary layer. For higher Re ∞, the values of Nu/Re 0. 5 {{on the front of the}} cylinder are higher in the production region of FSG 17 than in that of SSG, despite Tu being higher for SSG. This is consistent with a lower intermittency of the flow for FSG 17 caused by the presence of the fractal geometrical iterations. The recov- ery of Nu on the back of the cylinder (wake region) is appreciably higher in the production region than in the decay region for both FSG 17 and for SSG. This can be due to the lower integral length scale ratio L u /D in the production region and suggests, for the same Re ∞, a reduction of the vortex formation length downstream of the cylinder, possibly promoted by the interaction between the wakes of the bars of the grid and the wake of the cylinder. At a large distance from the grids, the heat transfer enhancement is higher and it is more efficient for FSG 17 and for SSG than for RG 60. For high values of x in the turbulence decay region of the grids, the values of Nu (circumferential average of Nu) are similar for FSG 17 and for SSG and they are both appreciably higher than for RG 60. This happens despite both FSG 17 and SSG having a lower blockage ratio than RG 60. The use of FSG 17 has the practical advantage of combining high heat transfer rates on the cylinder with a weak vortex shedding from the grid...|$|R
