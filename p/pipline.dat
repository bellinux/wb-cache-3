40|$|We {{propose a}} method for {{automatic}} target detection and tracking in forward-looking infrared (FLIR) image sequences. We use morphological connected operators to extract and track targets of interest and remove undesirable clutter. The design of these operators is based on general size, connectivity and motion criteria, using spatial intraframe and temporal interframe information. In a first step, an image sequence is filtered on a frame-by-frame basis to remove background and residual clutter and to enhance the presence of targets. Detections extracted from the first step are passed to a second step for motion-based analysis. This step exploits the spatiotemporal correlation of the data, {{stated in terms of}} a connectivity criterion along the time dimension. The proposed method is suitable for <b>piplined</b> implementation or time progressive coding/transmission, since only a few frames are considered at a time.

Results Buried residues, bends, cysteines, prolines and leucines were significantly more likely to occupy positions highly correlated with structural change than expected by chance. Some buried residues were found to be less informative than expected, particularly residues involved in active sites and the binding of small molecules.

Unfortunately, optimum scheduling is computationally intractable, and one must resort to carefully crafted heuristics in practice. Ifthe scope of application of a scheduling heuristic is limited to basic blocks, considerable performance loss may be incurred at block boundaries. To overcome this obstacle, basic blocks are coalesced across branches to form either superblocks or hyperblocks, with the branches labeled with branch probabilities obtained via profiling. Then, the goal of the scheduling heuristic is to minimize the expected completion time of the superblock or the hyperblock. In this paper, we analyze the general problem of scheduling with profIle information and present some experimental results on heuristics that are suggested by our analysis. Specifically, we carry out a theoretical analysis on a simplified abstraction of the problem to obtain insight into its structure, and to develop provably good algorithms. Based on the theoretical analysis of the simplified abstraction, we develop a generic scheme for converting any list scheduling heuristic for basic blocks into a heuristic for the superblockslhyperblocks with associated profIle information.

A trace-back method is used for returning to the beginning of the selected path back, i. e., to the first time unit of the interval NK to read out the stored branch metrics of the selected path which correspond to the message bits. The decoding decision made in this way is no longer maximum likelihood, but can be almost as good, provided that constraint length K in not too small. The advantage is that for a long message, it is not necessary to provide a large memory to store the trellis derived information until the end of the message to select the path that is to be decoded; the selection is made at the end of every NK time unit, thus decoding a long message in successive blocks...|$|E

To date, the next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology has been widely used to discover miRNAs in plants and animals. Although evolutionary analysis is important to reveal the functional dynamics of miRNAs, few computational tools {{have been developed to}} analyze the evolution of miRNA sequence and expression across species, especially the newly emerged ones, Results We developed miREvo, an integrated software platform with a graphical user interface (GUI), to process deep-sequencing data of small RNAs and to analyze miRNA sequence and expression evolution based on the multiple-species whole genome alignments (WGAs). Three major features are provided by miREvo: (i) to identify novel miRNAs in both plants and animals, based on a modified miRDeep algorithm, (ii) to detect miRNA homologs and measure their pairwise evolutionary distances among multiple species based on a WGA, and (iii) to profile miRNA expression abundances and analyze expression divergence across multiple species (small RNA libraries).

40|$|Reconfigurable {{computing}} is {{a method}} of development that provides a developer {{with the ability to}} reprogram a hardware device. In the specific case of FPGAs this allows for rapid and cost effective implementation of hardware devices when compared to standard a ASIC design, coupled with an increase in performance when compared to software based solutions. With the advent of development tools such as Celoxica's DK package and Xilinx's Forge package, that support languages traditionally associated with software development, a change in the skill sets required to develop FPGA solutions from hardware designers to software programmers is possible and perhaps desirable to increase the adoption of FPGA technologies. To support developers with these skill sets tools should closely mirror current software development tools in terms of language, syntax and methodology, {{while at the same time}} both transparently and automatically take advantage of as much of the increased performance that reconfigurable architectures can provide over traditional software architectures by utilizing the parallelism and the ability to create arbitrary depth pipelines which is not present in traditional microprocessor designs. A common feature of many programming languages that is not supported by many higher level design tools is recursion. Recursion is a powerful method used to elegantly describe many algorithms. Recursion is typically implemented by using a stack to store arguments, context and a return address for function calls. This however limits the controlling hardware to running only a single function at any moment which eliminates an algorithm's ability to take advantage of the parallelism available between successive iterations of a recursive function. This squanders the high amount of parallelism provided by the resources on the FPGA thus reducing the performance of the recursive algorithm. This thesis presents a method to address the lack of support for recursion in design tools that exploits the parallelism available between recursive calls. It does this by unrolling the recursion into a pipeline, in a similar manner to the pipeline obtained from loop unrolling, and then streaming the data through the resulting pipeline. However essential differences between loops and recursive functions such as multiple recursive calls in a function, and hence multiple unrollings, and post-recursive statements add further complexity to the issue of unrolling as the pipeline may take a non-linear shape and contain heterogeneous stages. Unrolling the recursive function on the FPGA increases the parallelism available, however the depth of the <b>pipline</b> and therefore the amount of parallelism available, is limited by the finite resources on the FPGA. To make efficient use of the resources on the FPGA the system must be able to unroll the function in a way to best suit the input but also must ensure that the function is not unrolled past its maximum recursive depth. A trivial solution such as unrolling on-demand introduces a latency into the system when a further instance of the function is unrolled that reduces overall performance. To reduce this penalty it is desirable for the system to be able to predict the behaviour of the recursive function based on the input data and unroll the function to a suitable length prior to it being required. Accurate prediction is possible in cases where the condition for recursion is a simple function on the arguments, however in cases where the condition for recursion is based on complex functions, such as the entire recursive function, accurate prediction is not possible. In situations such as this a heuristic is used which provides a close approximation to the correct depth of recursion at any given time. This prediction allows the system to reduce the performance penalty from real time unrolling without over utilization of the the FPGA resources. Results obtained demonstrate the increase in performance for various recursive functions obtained from the increased parallelism, when compared to a stack based implementation on the same device. In certain instances due to constraints on hardware availability results were gained from device simulation using a simulator developed for this purpose. Details of this simulator are presented in this thesis...|$|E
40|$|Direct {{electrical}} heating (DEH) of pipelines is a {{flow assurance}} method that {{has proven to}} be a good and reliable solution for preventing the formation of hydrates and wax in multiphase flow lines. The technology is installed on several pipelines in the North Sea and has become StatoilHydros preferred method for flow assurance. Tyrihans is the newest installation with 10 MW DEH for a 43 km <b>pipline.</b> However, the pipeline represents a considerable single-phase load which makes the power system dependent on a balancing unit for providing symmetrical conditions. This limits the step out distance and is not suitable for subsea installation. Aker Solutions has proposed several specially connected transformers for subsea power supply of DEH systems, Scott-T being one of them. The Scott-T transformer is a three-to-two-phase transformer which provides balanced electrical power between the two systems when the two secondary one-phase loads are equal. By implementing this transformer, it can be possible to install the power supply subsea as there is no need for a balancing unit. In addition, the system may be applicable for long step out distances. This is because the pipeline is inductive and can use the reactive power produced by the long cable which also can increase the critical cable length. There are however some limitations on this system using the Scott-T transformer. There is a large variation in the magnetic permeability between individual joints of the pipeline. This can result in different load impedance of the two pipe sections connected to the Scott-T transformer. The result is unbalance in the power system. The method of symmetrical components is applied to investigate the behavior during unbalanced loading of the Scott-transformer. The relationship between the negative- and the positive sequence component of the current is used to express the degree of unsymmetry. For the simulations in SIMPOW, the Scott-T transformer is modelled by the use of Dynamic Simulation Language. The simulations on the DSL model give correct and reliable results for analysing the the degree of unsymmetry in the Scott-T transformer. When the load impedance of one pipe section is varied, simulation proves that it can change between 0. 75 and 1. 34 per unit of the other pipe impedance. The Scott-T transformer does still provide electrical power between the two systems which is below the limit for the degree of unsymmetry (15 %). Case 1 and Case 2 introduce two possible configurations for a subsea DEH system with the Scott-T transformer implemented. The configurations include an onshore power supply which is connected to a subsea power system for direct electrical heating and a subsea load at the far end of the subsea cable. The pipeline in Case 1 is 100 km long and is divided into two pipe sections of 50 km which are connected to a Scott-T transformer. The pipeline in Case 2 is 200 km long and is divided into four pipe sections of 50 km each. There are two Scott-T transformers in Case 2. For normal operation of the subsea load (50 MW, cosfi= 0. 9) and heating the pipe content from the ambient sea emperature, the results indicate that tap changers are necessary to keep the Scott-T transformers secondary terminal voltage at 25 kV. This meets the requirement in both cases for heating the pipe content from 4 to 25 degrees celsius within 48 hours after a shutdown of the process. The degree of unsymmetry is zero for both cases when the system is operated as normal. However, all system simulations indicate that reactive power compensation has to be included for Case 1 as well as for Case 2 in order to have a power factor of unity at the onshore grid connection. The fault scenarios indicate that the degree of unsymmetry is dependent on both the type of fault and the power supply in the system. For Case 1, the relationship (I-/I+) is only of 3. 3 % in the subsea cable when there is a short-circuit at DEHBUS 3, but as much as 87 % at the grid connection. The degree of unsymmetry in the Scott-T transformer is then 67 %. This is far beyond the limit for maximum negative sequence component of 15 %. The significant unsymmetry in the line between the grid and BUS 1 is most likely due to the large power delivered to the fault. During the fault, the reactive power delivered to the system increases from 10. 6 Mvar to 131. 9 Mvar after the fault, but the active power increases only from 75. 2 MW to 87. 1 MW. This means that it is most likely the reactive power that contributes to the consequent unsymmetry and negative sequence component of the current. There are two Scott-T transformers installed in Case 2. If the DEH system is only heating the pipe section closest to shore (at DEHBUS 33), simulations show that the three-phase power system becomes unsymmetric which results in different phase currents. The degree of unsymmetry at the grid connection is 32 % when only the pipe section at DEHBUS 33 is heated. In addition, the unbalance in the three-phase system caused by SCOTT 1 involves unbalance in the SCOTT 2 transformer as well. The load voltages are not equal in magnitude and dephased of 90 degrees for this mode, but are 32 kV and 35 kV respectively and dephased of 88 degrees. This concludes a very important behavior of the Scott-T transformer. The simulations conclude that the Scott-T transformer provides symmetrical conditions for both configurations when the two load impedances are equal. However, Case 2 shows an important result when installing two Scott-T transformers in the same system. Unbalanced loading of one of the specially connected transformers gives unsymmetrical conditions in the three-phase system which results in unbalanced load voltages for the other Scott-T transformer. The analysis is limited to the configurations given for Case 1 and Case 2, but shows typical results when an alternative transformer connection is implemented in a DEH system. </p...|$|E
