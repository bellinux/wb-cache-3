Counties Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway, Waterford and Tipperary have been broken up into smaller administrative areas. However, they are still treated as counties for cultural and some official purposes, for example <b>postal</b> <b>addresses</b> and by the Ordnance Survey Ireland. Counties in Northern Ireland are no longer used for local governmental purposes, but, as in the Republic, their traditional boundaries are still used for informal purposes such as sports leagues and in cultural or tourism contexts.|$|E
50|$|In 1884, John Webb petitioned for a {{separate}} <b>postal</b> <b>address</b> for Spanish Point.

A separate town eventually grew around that <b>postal</b> <b>address.</b> Although there is no similar documentation regarding the name of Sarasota, that federal one-word rule for postal designations may be the reason that Zara Zota or Sara Sota became Sarasota.|$|R

40|$|The <b>postal</b> <b>address</b> {{data and}} the domain {{information}} for address validation contain qualitative, numeric, interval {{and other types of}} data. The efficient processing of such data required for postal automation needs a robust data structure that facilitates their storage and access. A symbolic data structure is proposed to represent the <b>postal</b> <b>address</b> and the information relevant for validating the <b>postal</b> <b>address</b> is stored in a newly devised symbolic knowledge base. The symbolic representation gives a formal structure to the information and hence is more beneficial than other representations such as frames, which do not reflect the structure inherent in the domain knowledge. The process of <b>postal</b> <b>address</b> validation checks the different components of the <b>postal</b> <b>address</b> for consistency before using it for further processing. In the present work a symbolic knowledge base supported address validation system is developed and tested for about 500 addresses. The system efficiency is observed to be 95. 6 % in validating the addresses automatically...|$|R

Egham Hythe, Surrey also had <b>postal</b> <b>addresses</b> of Staines, Middlesex. Conversely, Hampton Wick was conveniently placed in Kingston, Surrey with its sorting offices just across the river.

The customer <b>postal</b> <b>address</b> is a touch point to analyzing demographic where it is vital important to the business, especially to prospecting their profitable customer. From literature review survey, the business has been used survey intensively as main sources for gathering demographic infomation about customer, including non-contractual customer, also called non-database customer. However, some problem will rise during joins used of home <b>postal</b> <b>address,</b> specifically, refers to un-match problems between home <b>postal</b> <b>address</b> of non-contractual customer (from the survey) with spatial data address (road and street data). These un-match problems may create un-accurate value in analyzing customer demographic background when current location, of customer takes into account. The objective of the paper is to discuss some issues regarding un-match between home <b>postal</b> <b>address</b> of non-contractual customer and spatial address. Secondly, this study will introduce a procedure on how to solve these problems where at the end results on 100 percents match between these two data. The method {{of this study is}} by using iThoughMap as an application for transforming customer <b>postal</b> <b>address</b> into spatial address. To operating this work, data survey of non-contracting customer will use as a source of home <b>postal</b> <b>address,</b> while road and street data were obtained from government agency. This study will be applied specifically on the location of Seberang Perai, Pulau Pinang in Malaysia. One of result indicates that perfect match between <b>postal</b> <b>address</b> with spatial address bas produced when hundred percent match has resulted. At the end, suggestion will be recommended for future research on how improvising the accuracy, timeliness, and precision of information regarding non- contracting customer by utilizes spatial and non-spatial data...|$|R

New Zealand Post recognises Māori place-names in <b>postal</b> <b>addresses.</b> Dealings with government agencies may be conducted in Māori, but in practice, this almost always requires interpreters, restricting its everyday use to the limited geographical areas of high Māori fluency, and to more formal occasions, such as during public consultation.

25|$|Part of the Merrythought site is now {{rented out}} to other businesses, as the company has scaled down operations, {{with many of the}} factory and {{associated}} buildings not in use by Merrythought rented {{out to other}} companies. The overall site therefore has become mixed use with office, workshop and retail units, and has been named the Merrythought Village. The Village at present includes the Merrythought company's factory and its teddy bear museum and shop, but is also home to Ironbridge Interiors, Crystal Labyrinth, Ironbridge Fine Arts and Framing, Ironbridge Scenic River Cruises, Admaston Firecraft Centre Ltd, Ironbridge Arts and Antiques Centre and the Ironworkers of Ironbridge. The Ironbridge Brewery was located at the Village until 2014 (it moved to Wellington and has been renamed) and brewed real ale in the building closest to the Severn.

2500|$|Before 1972 townlands were {{included}} on all rural <b>postal</b> <b>addresses</b> throughout the island, {{but in that}} year the Royal Mail decided that the townland element of the address was obsolete in Northern Ireland. Townland names were not banned, but they were deemed [...] "superfluous information" [...] and people were asked not to include them on addresses. They were {{to be replaced by}} house numbers, road names and postcodes. In response the Townlands Campaign emerged to protest against the changes. It was described as a [...] "ground-level community effort". Taking place in the midst of The Troubles, the campaign was a rare example of unity between Catholics and Protestants, nationalists and unionists. Townlands and their names [...] "seem to have been considered as a shared resource and heritage". Those involved in the campaign argued that, in many areas, people still strongly identified with their townlands and that this gave them a sense of belonging.

2500|$|The second {{article is}} a {{condensed}} and simplified version of Professor Ross’ [...] "Linguistic Class-Indicators in Present-Day English", which appeared in 1954 in the Finnish philological periodical Neuphilologische Mitteilungen. For him the English class-system was essentially tripartite — there exists an upper, a middle, and a lower class. Solely by its language {{it is possible to}} identify them. In times past (e.g. in the Victorian and Edwardian periods) this was not the case. In fact the Professor says there are, it is true, a few minor points of life which may serve to demarcate the upper class, but they are minor ones, and he is concerned in this essay only with the linguistic demarcation. This line, for the Professor, is, often, a line between, on one hand, gentlemen and, on the other, persons who, though not gentlemen, must at first sight appear, or would like to appear, as such. Thus, habits of speech peculiar to the lower classes find no place in this article. He also addresses the written language, considering the following points: names on envelopes, etc., beginning of letters, names on cards, <b>postal</b> <b>addresses</b> on envelopes, etc. at the heads of letters, and on cards; finally, letter-endings.|$|E

The outer {{boundary}} of {{the area in which}} Freedom Passes and 60+ Oyster Cards can be used is mostly the same as the area within which ordinary Oyster Cards can be used. However, there are notable exceptions: Oyster 60+ and Freedom passes are valid to both Dartford and Swanley stations, to which non-concessionary Oyster cards are invalid on train services but can be used on TfL bus services. [...] This comes about because although both stations are outside Greater London, both Dartford and Swanley have expanded sufficiently that parts now technically lie inside the Greater London boundary, though their <b>postal</b> <b>addresses</b> are still 'Dartford, Kent' and 'Swanley, Kent' respectively. [...] Residents of these areas are entitled to an Oyster 60+ or Freedom pass as appropriate and require access to a local station to use them. Also, Oyster PAYG cards can be used to Broxbourne station, but Freedom Passes and 60+ Oyster cannot be used north of [...] or [...] stations. This is solely because National Express East Anglia Railways has taken a decision to accept Oyster PAYG as far as Broxbourne. [...] Both types of concessionary card have to be visually inspected at stations not equipped to read Oyster Cards.
