Chadian authors {{have been forced}} to write from exile or expatriate status and have generated literature dominated by themes of political oppression and historical discourse. Since 1962, 20 Chadian authors have written some 60 works of fiction. Among the most internationally renowned writers are Joseph Brahim Seïd, Baba Moustapha, Antoine Bangui and Koulsy Lamko.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{academic}} staffs’ job satisfaction in a higher educational institution, namely UiTM (Universiti Teknologi MARA), campus Sungai Petani. Survey was conducted using instrument Job Descriptive Index (JDI) and few demographic variables to measure the academic staffs job satisfaction. The findings shown that majority of the academic staffs were highly satisfied with three aspects of job, which are job in general, present job, and present pay. About half of them indicated highly satisfied with co-workers and supervision. Conversely, only a small portion of them highly satisfied with the opportunities for promotion. The result of this study shown that in general, academic staffs were highly satisfied with their job, except the opportunities for promotion. In this aspect, in order to motivate them, top management should reviewed the promotional system in the organization based on academic merit and contribution where the academic staffs that have excellent job performance will be rewarded and promoted accordingly. The <b>promotional</b> <b>structure,</b> system and process should be clearly communicated and understood by all the academic staffs...|$|E
40|$|Magister Pharmaceuticae - MPharmPrior to 2007, South Africa’s {{government}} {{became concerned}} about the loss and inability to retain certain professionals in its employment. Health human resources were distributed in favour {{of the private sector}} and urban areas while rural areas survived on a meagre portion of health employees. In 2007, the government introduced a re-designed remuneration structure for individual skilled professions namely, Occupation Specific Dispensation (OSD), with the goal to attract and retain professionals. This study qualitatively explores the perceptions of public sector employment (PSE) by pharmacists to extract how OSD-policy {{may or may not be}} succeeding. It also investigates the opinions of pharmacists on the <b>promotional</b> <b>structure</b> of OSD and opportunity for career advancement (CA) as a possible indication of organisational commitment. Participants were recruited from four career streams in OSD’s structure, all employed in the Department of Health, Provincial Government of the Western Cape. In the first stage of data collection, one-on-one interviews were conducted with key-informants which consisted of policy specialists (n= 2) and management (n= 2). In the second stage, focus group interviews were conducted comprising of production and supervisory pharmacists (n= 27). Sampling strategies encompassed purposive, snowball and stratified sampling to ensure saturation of data and provide comparisons between groups and sub-groups. Thematic analysis of interview transcripts was performed using inductive coding in the first stage and apriori coding in the second stage. Themes and sub-themes were “reflexed” onto Human Resource and Work Motivation Theory by engaging a three question reflexive framework to ensure consistency in the interpretation of results. Eleven major themes emerged: overlapping of salary grades; variety of positions; being a manager of professionals; envisioning promotion; pay versus responsibility; pay equity and expectancy; OSD and attraction; OSD and retention; over-time and after-hours remuneration; interpreting OSD; and using unions to negotiate policy for professionals. 41 sub-themes that emerged were positively, negatively or neutrally connected to perceptions of PSE or CA. Positive sub-themes of PSE is that OSD has “ensured that entry level positions are extremely attractive” and OSD is “attracting more junior pharmacists to management positions”. Negative sub-themes of PSE include that a “retention strategy for experienced pharmacists tends to be neglected” and “some work related factors may nullify retention strategies”. Negative or stagnant perceptions of PSE produce an image that fails to care for individual employee needs and tarnishes the image of public sector employment. Positive sub-themes of CA are that OSD now “permits individual freedom of career path choice” and OSD “has created a variety positions through a broadened post structure”. Negative subthemes of CA are that “experienced pharmacists stagnate in their career” and “supervisors have a lot more responsibilities but get paid the same as production pharmacists”. Since the perception of career mobility is related to organizational commitment and retention, negative perceptions of career advancement may result in apprehension to develop via promotion or career path change. This can lead to employee boredom, complacency or frustration of career ambitions and eventual loss of staff. Some aspects of OSD, such as overlapping of salary grades, should be addressed by policy-developers to ensure the successful accomplishment of policy goals...|$|E

40|$|This article {{explores the}} link between {{national}} success {{as a writer and}} the <b>promotional</b> <b>structures</b> of world literature in the West. It does so through critically examining how individual people relate to the various creative processes that underpin literature as it travels around the western world. The article draws in particular on Bruno Latour’s work on the concepts of ‘agency’ and ‘mediators’ in the context of actor–network theory, as well as developing the idea of a ‘network intellectual’ put forward in 2015 by Fred Turner and Christine Larson. In so doing, the article finds common ground between literary studies and celebrity studies that can help parse the concept of ‘literary celebrity’. The model for understanding the links between authorship, celebrity and world literature that I propose is exemplified through reference to the intertwined contemporary careers of novelists Daniel Kehlmann and Jonathan Franzen. Both writers have achieved bestseller status in their respective national contexts (Germany/Austria and the United States), both deliberately seek to place their work and person into dialogue with key writers and works from other national traditions, and both have been systematically promoted across multiple countries as international success stories. Approaching them as contemporary case studies in both world authorship and literary celebrity allows us to reconsider how individuals carry wider cultural value in an age of rapid network expansion...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{focuses on}} how price changes influence the observed pattern of brand competition. The paper begins with a basic utility model formulation and examines the implications of three major classes of preference distributions on the expected patterns of competition. A price-tier model is proposed to operationalize the theory and to allow predictive testing. The price-tier model is estimated on 28 brands across four product categories. The results show a specific asymmetric pattern of price competition. Higher-price, higher quality brands steal share from other brands in the same price-quality tier, {{as well as from}} brands in the tier below. However, lower-price, lower-quality brands take sales from their own tier and the tier below brands, but do steal significant share from the tiers above. The results are consistent with a bimodal preference distribution, with the regular price indifference point being located toward the lower-quality end of the preference distribution for the categories analyzed. <b>promotional</b> analyses, market <b>structure</b> models, price competition...|$|R
40|$|This study {{explores the}} ways in which "social art cinema" has been {{constructed}} as a form of national cinema {{in the context of the}} 1990 s. It discusses how particular institutional issues of the period affected signification revolving around the genre and, consequently, how that affected the concept of national cinema. This research draws upon a range of agendas relating to financial and distribution <b>structures,</b> <b>promotional</b> activities and multi-media consumption that were involved in encouraging the proliferation of social art cinema. This study contends that the success of social art cinema as a generic style was a key factor in constructing an idea of British cinema as a cultural entity. By examining how the institutional elements created this idea, I discuss how social art cinema was positioned as a national cinema in the market place through such elements. The primary objective of this study is therefore to make a contribution towards the growing body of scholarly work that considers the role played by the idea of national cinema in the very commercial environment of the contemporary film business where expressions of national specificity can often seen indistinct. The study also presents evidence for the need to consider contextual aspects when discussing the idea of national cinema. Thus, by examining the commercial aspects of national cinema, I demonstrate that national cinema should not only be defined by accounts of socio-political engagement, but should encompass institutional agendas as well.

40|$|The {{globalization}} {{of higher education}} has been greatly accelerated in the 21 st century. International student recruitment not only enriches cultural diversity but also provides huge revenue to education providers. This study is a written discourse analysis of the introductory pages of university prospectuses in the two culturally distinct institutional contexts of Hong Kong and the United Kingdom. Applying Bhatia’s (1993) model of applied genre analysis, a five-move generic structure has been identified in 14 selected introductory pages which display evidence of interdiscursivity “with elements of advertising and other promotional genres” (Fairclough, 1993 : 146). The introductory pages are established as a hybrid promotional genre sharing a recognisable set of three communicative purposes: persuading, welcoming and informing. Halliday’s (1994) functional grammar approach is adopted to closely examine how the introductory pages represent the experimental and interpersonal metafunctions of language by analysing the grammar of clauses (with a focus on transitivity) and allocation of social roles (with a focus on personal pronouns). Although there are variations shown in move <b>structures,</b> <b>promotional</b> strategies and linguistic and multimodal resources, both Hong Kong and British universities tend to maintain a common institutional role and most irregularities are due to “organisational differences ” (Bhatia, 1999 : 27). Individual universities push out the generic boundaries to fulfil private intentions so as to stand out from their regional or international counterparts. It is hoped that the recommendations for writing prospectuses can be applied effectively and extended to other related advertising genres to help universities and international educational organisation produce better promotional texts which target their intended audience...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – Destination {{branding}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular topics among tourism destinations researchers and practitioners however recent research revealed that it doesn’t have a clear concept. The purpose of presented paper is to enhance the destination branding theory by introducing some new elements taken from other popular concepts used in destination management into destination branding theory. The concept of destination brand licensing was undertaken as a response to several critical arguments raised against the existing idea of destination branding. However the concept is not completed and practical examples presented so far need scientific background to prepare some guidelines on successful procedure for implementing destination brand licensing. The aim of the paper is pointing out some crucial elements which are conditions for effective implementing of destination brand licensing.

The <b>structure</b> of the paper follows this division. After introduction and presentation of destination branding and destination brand licensing concepts further chapter are devoted the five presented problem areas. At the end, there is a chapter in which effectiveness of destination brand licensing procedure is discussed. Approach and methodology – The paper is theoretical with limited use of case study approach. Within the frame of those five areas several dilemmas and potential problems were presented on the basis of several practical implementation examples of destination brand licensing ideas from different European countries. Research findings and originality – Apart from the five problem areas, three overall effectiveness indicators were proposed. These are: increased volume of tourism movement, improvement in destination image and enhancement of local stakeholders for better cooperation. However both, problem areas and indicators should be perceived as initial proposal and further discussion is expected...|$|R
