This study investigates the emission from a palm waste biomass fired boiler of two studied palm oil mill plants – named as Plant A and Plant B. The finding shows that the total <b>particulate</b> <b>emission</b> of Plant A is 4, 242 mg/Nm 3 - exceeding the emission limit specified by the Department of Environment Malaysia (DOE) by 960 %, while the average total <b>particulate</b> <b>emission</b> of Plant B was 851 mg/Nm 3 (exceeds the limit by 113 %). This study also performed more detailed measurements on the emissions of PM 10 and PM 2. 5 in Plant B.

However, during that same time period regulatory changes meant that annual emissions of carbon monoxide fell from 197 million tons to 89 million, nitrogen oxides emissions fell from 27 million tons to 19 million, sulfur dioxide emissions fell from 31 million tons to 15 million, <b>particulate</b> <b>emissions</b> fell by 80%, and lead emissions fell by more than 98%.|$|E
25|$|Since {{biodiesel}} is {{an effective}} solvent and cleans residues deposited by mineral diesel, engine filters {{may need to be}} replaced more often, as the biofuel dissolves old deposits in the fuel tank and pipes. It also effectively cleans the engine combustion chamber of carbon deposits, helping to maintain efficiency. In many European countries, a 5% biodiesel blend is widely used and is available at thousands of gas stations. Biodiesel is also an oxygenated fuel, meaning it contains a reduced amount of carbon and higher hydrogen and oxygen content than fossil diesel. This improves the combustion of biodiesel and reduces the <b>particulate</b> <b>emissions</b> from unburnt carbon. However, using pure biodiesel may increase NOx-emissions-levels also when using B100.|$|E
25|$|High {{levels of}} sulfur in diesel are harmful for the {{environment}} because they prevent the use of catalytic diesel particulate filters to control diesel <b>particulate</b> <b>emissions,</b> {{as well as more}} advanced technologies, such as nitrogen oxide (NOx) adsorbers (still under development), to reduce emissions. Moreover, sulfur in the fuel is oxidized during combustion, producing sulfur dioxide and sulfur trioxide, that in presence of water rapidly convert to sulfuric acid, one of the chemical processes that results in acid rain. However, the process for lowering sulfur also reduces the lubricity of the fuel, meaning that additives must be put into the fuel to help lubricate engines. Biodiesel and biodiesel/petrodiesel blends, with their higher lubricity levels, are increasingly being utilized as an alternative.|$|E
40|$|The {{quantification}} of <b>particulate</b> matter <b>emissions</b> from mineral handling is {{an important}} problem for the quantification of global emissions on industrial sites. Mineral <b>particulate</b> matter <b>emissions</b> could adversely impact environmental quality in mining regions, transport regions, and even on a global scale. Mineral loading {{is an important}} process contributing to mineral <b>particulate</b> matter <b>emissions,</b> especially under weak wind conditions. Mathematical models are effective ways to evaluate <b>particulate</b> matter <b>emissions</b> during the mineral loading process. The currently used empirical models based on {{the form of a}} power function do not predict <b>particulate</b> matter <b>emissions</b> accurately under weak wind conditions. At low <b>particulate</b> matter <b>emissions,</b> the models overestimated, and at high <b>particulate</b> matter <b>emissions,</b> the models underestimated emission factors. We conducted wind tunnel experiments to evaluate the <b>particulate</b> matter <b>emission</b> factors for the mineral loading process. A new approach based on the mathematical form of a logistical function was developed and tested.

40|$|A {{study to}} {{investigate}} the <b>particulate</b> <b>emission</b> from a boiler of a palm oil mill plant equipped with a multi-cyclones particulate arrestor was performed and reported in this paper. The <b>particulate</b> <b>emission</b> concentration was measured at the outlet of an 8000 kg steam/h capacity water-tube typed boiler of a palm oil mill plant processing 27000 kg/h of fresh fruit bunch (FFB). The particulate sample was collected iso-kinetically using the USEPA method 5 sampling train through a sampling port made at the duct of the exiting flue gas between the boiler and a multi-cyclones unit. The {{results showed that the}} <b>particulate</b> <b>emission</b> rates exiting the boiler varied from 8. 51 g/s to 126 g/s with an average of 44. 3 ± 31. 6 g/s. In terms of concentration, the average <b>particulate</b> <b>emission</b> concentration exiting the boiler was 7. 75 ± 4. 71 g/Nm 3 (corrected to 7 % oxygen concentration), ranging from 1. 50 to 17. 7 g/Nm 3 (@ 7 % O 2) of the flue gas during the measurement. Based on the 27000 kg/h FFB processed, 6000 kg/h fiber and shell (F&S) burned and the capacity of the boiler of 8000 kg steam/h, the calculated <b>particulate</b> <b>emission</b> factor was 5. 91 ± 4. 21 g particulate/kg FFB processed, 26. 6 ± 18. 9 g particulate/kg F&S burned and 19. 9 ± 14. 2 g particulate/kg boiler capacity, respectively. Based on the finding, in order to comply with the emission limits of 0. 4 g/Nm 3, the required collection efficiency of any given particulate pollution control system to consider for the mill will be between 73 and 98 %, which is not easily achievable with the existing multi-cyclones unit...|$|R
25|$|Respirable {{suspended}} particulate matter, {{of less than}} 10 micrometers (µm) in size, can {{be present in the}} drift from cooling towers. Larger particles above 10µm in size are generally filtered out in the nose and throat via cilia and mucus but particulate matter smaller than 10µm, referred to as PM10, can settle in the bronchi and lungs and cause health problems. Similarly, particles smaller than 2.5µm, (PM2.5), tend to penetrate into the gas exchange regions of the lung, and very small particles (less than 100 nanometers) may pass through the lungs to affect other organs. Though the total <b>particulate</b> <b>emissions</b> from wet cooling towers with fresh water make-up is much less, they contain more PM10 and PM2.5 than the total emissions from wet cooling towers with sea water make-up. This is due to lesser salt content in fresh water drift (below 2,000ppm) compared to the salt content of sea water drift (60,000ppm).|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In this study, a Cummins B 5 {{diesel engine}} {{was set up}} to operate on a {{dynamometer}} under the US transient cycle. Twenty-four diesel fuels were tested. Regulated air pollutants (HC, CO, NOx, particulate matter) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emissions were meas-ured. PAH was analyzed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometer detector (GC/MS). The av-erage emission factors were 0. 32, 2. 1, 4. 9 and 0. 09 g/BHP-hr for HC, CO, NOx and particulate matter, which were all lower than the emission standards in Taiwan. Total PAH (sum of 21 PAHs) emission factor was 3. 6 mg/BHP-hr. The non-liner two-variable regression analysis was used to identify the fuel properties which may have influenced the diesel engine <b>particulate</b> and PAH <b>emissions.</b> The greatest influential factor on <b>particulate</b> <b>emission</b> was carbon content, followed by density and viscosity. A 1 % increase in carbon content was associated with an increase of 63. 1 % in <b>particulate</b> <b>emission.</b> The first three important fuel properties affecting PAH emission were density, viscosity and carbon content.

40|$|Woodstove change-out programs, which entail the {{replacement}} of old uncertified wood heaters with new lower-emitting EPA certified wood heaters, have become a recognized strategy to reduce ambient particulate levels. To assess the benefit of <b>particulate</b> <b>emission</b> reductions affected by change outs, accurate emission factors for new model certified wood heaters are needed. Standards of performance (NSPS) for new residential wood heaters were promulgated February 26, 1988.

These test methods and procedures {{can best be described}} as “benchmark ” and emission rates obtained from them are only loosely predictive of actual in-home emission factors.
