5|$|Sterol lipids, such as {{cholesterol}} and its derivatives, {{are an important}} component of membrane lipids, along with the glycerophospholipids and sphingomyelins. The steroids, all derived from the same fused four-ring core structure, have different biological roles as hormones and signaling molecules. The eighteen-carbon (C18) steroids include the estrogen family whereas the C19 steroids comprise the androgens such as testosterone and androsterone. The C21 subclass includes the progestogens as well as the glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids. The secosteroids, comprising various forms of vitamin D, are characterized by cleavage of the B ring of the core structure. Other examples of sterols are the bile acids and their conjugates, which in mammals are oxidized derivatives of {{cholesterol and}} are synthesized in the liver. The plant equivalents are the <b>phytosterols,</b> such as β-sitosterol, stigmasterol, and brassicasterol; the latter compound is also used as a biomarker for algal growth. The predominant sterol in fungal cell membranes is ergosterol.|$|E
25|$|From a dietary perspective, plant cells do not {{manufacture}} cholesterol, {{and it is}} {{not found}} in plant foods. Some plant foods, such as avocado, flax seeds and peanuts, contain <b>phytosterols,</b> which compete with cholesterol for absorption in the intestines, reducing the absorption of both dietary and bile cholesterol. However, a typical diet contributes on the order of 0.2 grams of <b>phytosterols,</b> which is not enough to {{have a significant impact on}} blocking cholesterol absorption. <b>Phytosterols</b> intake can be supplemented through the use of phytosterol-containing functional foods or dietary supplements that are recognized as having potential to reduce levels of LDL-cholesterol. Some supplemental guidelines have recommended doses of <b>phytosterols</b> in the 1.6–3.0grams per day range (Health Canada, EFSA, ATP III, FDA).

25|$|Plants make {{cholesterol}} in {{very small}} amounts. Plants manufacture <b>phytosterols</b> (substances chemically similar to cholesterol), which {{can compete with}} cholesterol for reabsorption in the intestinal tract, thus potentially reducing cholesterol reabsorption. When intestinal lining cells absorb <b>phytosterols,</b> in place of cholesterol, they usually excrete the phytosterol molecules back into the GI tract, an important protective mechanism. The intake of naturally occurring <b>phytosterols,</b> which encompass plant sterols and stanols, ranges between ~200–300mg/day depending on eating habits. Specially designed vegetarian experimental diets have been produced yielding upwards of 700mg/day.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to prepare and characterise {{water-soluble}} <b>phytosterol</b> nanodispersions for food formulation.

The lipid (fatty acid, <b>phytosterol)</b> and antioxidant (total phenolics, radical scavenging capacity) profiles of grapeseed (GSO), corn (CO) and coconut (CNO) oils and their physiological (triacylglycerides, total and HDL-cholesterol and antioxidant capacity (FRAP) in serum and fatty acid and <b>phytosterol</b> hepatic deposition) and genomic (HL, LCAT, ApoA- 1 and SR-BP 1 mRNA hepatic levels) responses after their sub-chronic intake (10 % diet for 28 days) was examined in healthy albino rats. Fatty acid, <b>phytosterol</b> and antioxidant profiles differed between oils (p ≤ 0. 01).

Near infra-red spectrometry (NIRS) is widely used to classify sunflower lots according to fatty acid content. This study proposes an extension of NIRS potential use con-cerning sunflower by tocopherol and <b>phytosterol</b> content quantifications. Approximately 800 samples of ground sunflower kernels were scanned by NIRS at 2 nm intervals from 400 to 2500 nm. For each sample standard meas-urements of tocopherol and <b>phytosterol</b> contents were performed. Total toco-pherol content was obtained by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) coupled with a fluorescence detector while total <b>phytosterol</b> content was assessed by gas chromatography (GC). For tocopherol, the calibration data set ranged from 190 to 1280 mgxkg- 1 oil (mean value around 615 ± 165 mgxkg- 1 oil) whereas for <b>phytosterol</b> content, the calibration data set ranged from 125 to 765 mgx 100 g- 1 oil (mean value of 334 _ 75 mgx 100 g- 1 oil). The NIRS calibration showed a relative good correlation (R 2 = 0. 62) between pre-dicted by NIRS and real values for total tocopherol content but a poor correla-tion for total <b>phytosterol</b> content (R 2 = 0. 21). These results indicate that NIR spectrometry could be useful to classify high and low tocopherol containing lots despite possible improvement of calibration by inclusion of {{a larger number of}} data in tocopherols NIRS calibration. In contrast, the determination of <b>phytosterol</b> content by NIRS needs more investigations.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: As {{opposed to}} {{traditional}} food based delivery {{we examined the}} efficacy of ingesting encapsulated <b>phytosterol</b> esters on indices of lipid health in hypercholesterolemic adults. METHODS: We performed a randomized, double-blinded, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, clinical intervention examining 54 men and women (20 - 70 y of age) with a low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) level > /= 3. 33 mmol/L. Participants were not taking cholesterol-lowering medications. Treatment consisted of ingesting 2. 6 g of encapsulated <b>phytosterol</b> esters (n = 25) or a matching placebo (n = 29) for 12 wk. RESULTS: Total cholesterol (TC) levels at baseline (mean +/- SD) were 6. 29 +/- 0. 7 mmol/L in the <b>phytosterol</b> group and 6. 00 +/- 0. 7 mmol/L in the placebo group. Baseline LDL-C levels were 4. 27 +/- 0. 7 mmol/L in the treatment group and 4. 00 +/- 0. 8 mmol/L in the placebo group. Analysis of variance and Tukey's least significant difference post hoc analyses revealed a significant within-group reduction in TC (- 0. 23 +/- 0. 4 mmol/L, P < 0. 05) and LDL-C (- 0. 22 +/- 0. 5 mmol/L, P < 0. 05) for the <b>phytosterol</b> treatment group. Mean reductions in TC and LDL-C were greater than placebo (P < 0. 05). Percentages of change from baseline for TC were - 3. 52 % (95 % confidence interval - 6. 44 to - 0. 40) for <b>phytosterol</b> treatment and 2. 64 % (95 % confidence interval 0. 30 - 5. 60) for placebo. Those for LDL-C were - 5. 00 % (95 % confidence interval - 9. 92 to - 0. 08) for <b>phytosterol</b> and 4. 89 (95 % confidence interval 0. 24 - 9. 5) for placebo. No other significant effects were observed. CONCLUSION: Encapsulated <b>phytosterol</b> ester ingestion appears to positively modulate LDL-C. Given that the reduction in LDL-C was not as extensive as in food-based trials, future investigations should examine potential timing and dose issues relative to encapsulated delivery...|$|R
