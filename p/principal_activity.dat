25|$|After the Great Northern War at the {{beginning}} of the 18th century, Sweden encouraged the foundation of villages on its territories by tax exemptions. As a result, a few isolated villages were established in the forest of Skuleskogen, but none in today's park. Until the middle of the 18th century, logging was limited to the area directly around the villages and thus only minimally affected the forest of the park. But that soon changed, the state taking an active part in the exploitation of the forest. Logging became the <b>principal</b> <b>activity</b> in the area of the park. In a few years, a dozen mills, including a steam mill, were constructed in immediate proximity to today's park. The sawmills driven by water wheels only had weak capacities in general and only functioned during certain periods of the year. The number of steam mills grew thereafter. At first, only the trees with trunks over a fixed length in diameter were able to be cut, but bit by bit, these rules changed, and in the end all the trees were able to be felled. Logging slowed down markedly at the turn of the century, allowing the forest to regenerate. About 15% of the forest was affected by a new period of exploitation before the protection of the area. The forest's oldest trees therefore date from the start of the 20th century.|$|E
500|$|For {{the next}} decade, the Savoy Operas (as the series {{came to be}} known, after the theatre Carte later built to house them) were Gilbert's <b>principal</b> <b>activity.</b> The {{successful}} comic operas with Sullivan continued to appear every year or two, several of them being among the longest-running productions {{up to that point}} {{in the history of the}} musical stage.

Gilbert not only directed and oversaw all aspects of production for these works, but he actually designed the costumes himself for Patience, Iolanthe, Princess Ida, and Ruddigore. [...] He insisted on precise and authentic sets and costumes, which provided a foundation to ground and focus his absurd characters and situations.|$|E

500|$|Dudley {{returned}} to England in 1693 and {{embarked on a}} series of intrigues to regain an office in New England. [...] He ingratiated himself to the religious elements of the London political establishment by formally joining the Church of England. [...] He acquired a patron in Baron Cutts, who engineered his appointment as lieutenant governor of the Isle of Wight where Cutts had been appointed governor. [...] Dudley and Cutts assisted each other politically; Cutts worked to advance Dudley's agenda in London, while Dudley worked to promote that of Cutts on Wight. [...] His <b>principal</b> <b>activity</b> that has been documented is the manipulation of parliamentary election processes in the island's constituencies to see that Cutts' chosen candidates were elected. [...] This process made Cutts highly unpopular on Wight, although he continued in its governorship until his death in 1707.

The most important mining sites have been at Avoca and Glendalough. Mining has taken place at Avoca since at least the Bronze Age (c. 2,500–600 BCE). Iron ore extraction took place between the 12th and 17th centuries before being replaced by lead mining up to the mid 18th century. The <b>principal</b> <b>activity</b> from 1720 to the closure of the last mine in 1982 was copper extraction. Sulphur has also been extracted at certain times and, in smaller quantities, gold, silver and zinc. Lead mining has been the <b>principal</b> <b>activity</b> in the Glendalough valley and its neighbouring valleys of Glendasan and Glenmalure. Lead was first discovered in Glendasan in the early 19th century and the lead veins were later followed through Camaderry mountain to Glendalough. Mining on a smaller scale took place in Glenmalure. Ore from these mines was shipped to Ballycorus for processing. [...] The last mine closed in 1957.|$|E
