25|$|Additional {{missions}} to the Moon continued this exploration phase. In 1969 the Apollo12 mission landed {{next to the}} Surveyor3 spacecraft, demonstrating <b>precision</b> <b>landing</b> capability. The use of a manned vehicle on the Moon's surface was demonstrated in 1971 with the Lunar Rover during Apollo15. Apollo16 made the first landing within the rugged Lunar highlands. However, interest in further exploration of the Moon was beginning to wane among the American public. In 1972 Apollo17 was the final Apollo Lunar mission, and further planned missions were scrapped at the directive of President Nixon. Instead, focus was turned to the Space Shuttle and manned missions in near Earth orbit.|$|E

40|$|Stagnating {{yield and}} declining input use {{efficiency}} in irrigated wheat of the Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP) coupled with diminishing availability {{of water for}} agriculture {{is a major concern}} of food security in South Asia. The objective of our study was to establish an understanding of how wheat yield and input use efficiency can be improved and how land leveling and crop establishment practices can be modified to be more efficient in water use through layering of precision-conservation crop management techniques. The “precision land leveling with raised bed” planting can be used to improve crop yield, water and nutrient use efficiency over the existing “traditional land leveling with flat” planting practices. We conducted a field experiment during 2002 - 2004 at Modipuram, India to quantify the benefits of alternate <b>land</b> leveling (<b>precision</b> <b>land</b> leveling) and crop establishment (furrow irrigated raised bed planting) techniques alone or in combination (layering precision-conservation) in terms of crop yield, water savings, and nutrient use efficiency of wheat production in IGP. The wheat yield was about 16. 6 % higher with nearly 50 % less irrigation water with layering <b>precision</b> <b>land</b> leveling and raised bed planting compared to traditional practices (traditional land leveling with flat planting). The agronomic (AE) and uptake efficiency (UE) of N, P and K were significantly improved under <b>precision</b> <b>land</b> leveling with raised bed planting technique compared to other practices...|$|R
25|$|Interscan {{proved to}} have many {{advantages}} over other <b>precision</b> <b>landing</b> systems. It allows {{a wide selection of}} channels to avoid interference with other nearby airports; has excellent performance in all weather; and gives freedom to locate antennae anywhere at an airport. Some installations became operational in the 1990s and more were set up subsequently in Europe. NASA has operated a similar system to land space shuttles. However, Interscan has not become widely deployed worldwide, largely because the US Federal Aviation Administration has developed the Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS), which augments the satellite-based Global Positioning System (GPS). Although WAAS is cheaper and conforms to ILS Category I, its accuracy is under 1.0 metre laterally and under 1.5 metres vertically, which is a particular concern at locations that frequently suffer from low visibility.|$|E

The Command Module Pilot was Gemini veteran Richard F. Gordon Jr. Conrad and Bean carried the first lunar surface color television camera, but it was damaged when accidentally pointed into the Sun. They made two EVAs totaling 7 hours and 45 minutes. On one, they walked to the Surveyor, photographed it, and removed some parts which they returned to Earth.|$|E

2500|$|Precision guided entry {{made use}} of onboard {{computing}} ability to steer itself toward the pre-determined landing site, improving landing accuracy {{from a range of}} hundreds of kilometers to [...] This capability helped remove some of the uncertainties of landing hazards that might be present in larger landing ellipses. Steering was achieved by the combined use of thrusters and ejectable balance masses. The ejectable balance masses shift the capsule center of mass enabling generation of a lift vector during the atmospheric phase. A navigation computer integrated the measurements to estimate the position and attitude of the capsule that generated automated torque commands. This was the first planetary mission to use <b>precision</b> <b>landing</b> techniques.|$|E
2500|$|In 1957, when Cooper was 30 and a Captain, he was {{assigned}} to Fighter Section of the Experimental Flight Test Engineering Division at Edwards AFB in California.

This cinetheodolite system would take pictures at one frame per second as an aircraft landed. The crew consisted of James Bittick and Jack Gettys who began work at the site just before 08:00, using both still and motion picture cameras.
