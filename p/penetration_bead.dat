Laser welding input parameters play a very significant {{role in determining the}} quality of a weld joint. The joint quality can be defined in terms of the weld bead parameters such as weld bead <b>penetration,</b> <b>Bead</b> width & bead volume.

For welding of thicker plates the heat loss in thickness direction increases the cooling rate of plate.

40|$|Keyhole welding, {{meaning that}} the laser beam forms a vapour cavity inside the steel, {{is one of the}} two types of laser welding {{processes}} and currently it is used in few industrial applications. Modern high power solid state lasers are becoming more used generally, but not all process fundamentals and phenomena of the process are well known and understanding of these helps to improve quality of final products. This study concentrates on the process fundamentals and the behaviour of the keyhole welding process by the means of real time high speed x-ray videography. One of the problem areas in laser welding has been mixing of the filler wire into the weld; the phenomena are explained and also one possible solution for this problem is presented in this study. The argument of this thesis is that the keyhole laser welding process has three keyhole modes that behave differently. These modes are trap, cylinder and kaleidoscope. Two of these have sub-modes, in which the keyhole behaves similarly but the molten pool changes behaviour and geometry of the resulting weld is different. X-ray videography was used to visualize the actual keyhole side view profile during the welding process. Several methods were applied to analyse and compile high speed x-ray video data to achieve a clearer image of the keyhole side view. Averaging was used to measure the keyhole side view outline, which was used to reconstruct a 3 D-model of the actual keyhole. This 3 D-model was taken as basis for calculation of the vapour volume inside of the keyhole for each laser parameter combination and joint geometry. Four different joint geometries were tested, partial <b>penetration</b> <b>bead</b> on plate and I-butt joint and full <b>penetration</b> <b>bead</b> on plate and I-butt joint.

Typically, those reduced activated steels can loose their radioactivity in approximately 100 years, compared to thousands of years for the non-reduced-activated steels. The commonly used welding process for fabricating this steel are electron-beam welding, and tungsten inert gas (TIG) welding. Therefore, Activated-flux tungsten inert gas (A-TIG) welding, a variant of TIG welding has been developed in-house to increase the depth of penetration in single pass welding.

40|$|Robotic Gas Metal Arc Welding (GMAW) {{is used in}} fatigue loaded {{structures}} where {{demands on}} weld quality are very high. Bead dimensions of a weld such as <b>penetration</b> <b>bead</b> thickness and toe radius can reveal whether a weld can reach high fatigue life. However, several welding parameters have high impact on these dimensions. From previous research it has been indicated that geometrical parameters such as torch angle, weld position, push or pull direction etc. are the most influential ones concerning quality of a weld with solid wires. Welding technology offers solid or metal cored wires for robotic GMAW. Even though metal cored wires depict several advantages compared to solid, a lot of skepticism is faced among industries due to its higher cost. Response parameters of a fillet weld by robotized GMAW using metal cored wire were investigated {{as a function of}} welding geometry parameters. The goal is to reveal the optimal settings aiming at as high productivity as possible. Iteration of welding tests using solid wire has been made in order to depict repeatability of previous test results with the same settings. Next step consisted of several series of experiments varying geometrical parameters using metal cored electrode. Repetition of this series for different values of wire feed rate has been carried out and comparisons are made. In order to reveal higher possible productivity, a few tests were carried out for the optimal welds from previous steps for different welding speeds and with pulsed welding. Specimens were cut, grinded and etched. Measurement of weld dimensions was performed via Lumenera software. Analysis of the results was made with JMP 11 software by SAS. Results indicated that for metal cored wire the majority of high quality welds were performed in push direction, PA position and gun angle of 35 o. Correlation analysis showed the nature of the relationships between input and output parameters. Prediction models were constructed for all weld dimensions using regression analysis. Tests with higher welding speeds suggest that there are possibilities for productivity improvement. Pulsed welding revealed that only a trade-off between values of bead thickness and penetration can create a quality weld.

40|$|The overall aim of {{this project}} was to produce {{homogeneously}} sized polysaccharide microparticles and apply these and similar sized particles as probes for investigation of mucin layers {{as a model for}} a biological barrier. Small polysaccharide particles have many applications, e. g. within the medical field of drug delivery. In this study a microfluidic system was developed to produce alginate beads, which can be used in drug delivery systems. Different designs, continuous phases and concentrations were tested in order to find an optimal system. Beads in the size range of 10 &# 181;m were produced using a device with T-shaped design and three inlets. An electrostatic bead generator was also used to make alginate beads, however the beads produced were too large {{to be used in the}} experiments with the mucin layers. One of the many challenges when working with drug delivery systems is the mucus barrier protecting the epithelial cells. In this study a model mucus barrier was made by immobilizing mucins, the glycoprotein responsible for the physical properties of the barrier. A procedure for fluorescence labelling of polystyrene beads with quantum dots was developed, and <b>penetration</b> of these <b>beads</b> into the model barrier was measured with total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy. In TIRF the excitation field intensity decays exponentially, and the emitted fluorescence intensity from the beads gives an indication of the distance between the beads and the surface. Measurements performed on mucin layers of different concentrations indicate that mucin concentrations above 0, 5 mg/ml will result in a layer too thick or too dense to give a intensity signal. At mucin concentration 0, 05 mg/ml fluorescence was observable in TIRF, and it was clearly weaker than for the control with a bead directly on a glass surface. This indicates that the beads hover over the surface due to the mucin layers, and show that it is in principle possible to measure the <b>penetration</b> depth of <b>beads</b> into mucin layer using TIRF. To simulate the condition in the lungs of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients, the mucin layers were incubated with alginate. Measurements were performed to see how this affected the <b>penetration</b> of the <b>beads</b> into the layer. A weaker fluorescent signal was obtained for these samples in TIRF, which suggests that there has been interaction between mucin and alginate. It was in addition investigated how different concentrations of G-blocks in the solution affected the penetration into the mucin-alginate layer. These testes were carried out using both TIRF and atomic force microscopy (AFM) nanoindentation experiments.

30|$|In {{adaptive}} control welding, i.e., a {{closed loop system}} using feedback-sensing devices and {{adaptive control}}, there is a process control system that detects changes in welding conditions automatically {{with the aid of}} sensors and directs the equipment to take appropriate action. Sensors are needed in adaptive control welding to find the joint, assess root <b>penetration,</b> conduct <b>bead</b> placement and seam tracking, and ensure proper joint fill (Cary and Helzer 2005). Use of sensors allows adaptive control for real-time control and adjustment of process parameters such as welding current and voltage. For example, the capabilities of sensors in seam finding, identification of joint penetration and joint filling, and ensuring root penetration and acceptable weld bead shape mean that corrective modification of relevant welding parameters is done such that constant weld quality is maintained (Cary and Helzer 2005; Drews and Starke 1986). An adaptive welding robot should have the capabilities to address two main aspects. The first aspect is the control of the end effector’s path and orientation so that the robot is able to track the joint to be welded with high precision. The second one is the control of welding process variables in real time, for example, the control of the amount of metal deposition into the joint as per the dimensions of the gap separating the parts to be welded.|$|R

The solution of dominant equation in such case is expressed by the exponential function similar to temperature distribution equation of heat conduction, and the relationship between Z_m or S_B and parameters such as d, W and d/W ratio is expressed by exponential function, and this can be explained by the fact that it exhibits temperature distribution at melting point of the weld including fluid flow field...|$|R
