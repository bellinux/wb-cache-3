5000|$|According to the {{tradition}} of the village, and confirmed by the above-mentioned archeological finds, the village was originally located 800 meters east of its current location, on a site called Topolite, which, however, was abandoned by the ancestors of the villagers because (according to {{the tradition}}) an army of ants was destroying their field crops and greens. As a result, they moved and built a whole new settlement on a new site near the current Campsite. The former site is still known as [...] "Old Sotira" [...] or [...] "Old Loukovits". According {{to the tradition}}, though, as they often heard peals and loud noises deriving from a nearby spring, that still exists, and indeed people died once they heard those strange noises, they also abandoned that area and settled, about five hundred (500)years ago, at the site where the current village is located and built their settlement on the ruins of an older former village. However, as the death rate continued to raise, they decided to adjure the evil eye by putting two twin boys yoke two twin oxen and plow the village <b>perimetrically.</b> Since then, according to the legend, they released from the fetishisms and the superstitions.|$|E
40|$|Purpose: To {{compare the}} ability of optic disc and retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) imaging to {{discriminate}} <b>perimetrically</b> unaffected eyes of glaucoma patients from normal eyes. Methods: Forty-six primary open-angle glaucoma patients with glaucomatous visual field loss with achromatic perimetry in one eye and a normal visual field in the fellow eye and 46 normal controls were selected. Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves and sensitivities at fixed specificities were {{used to compare the}} performance of StratusOCT (Fast RNFL algorithm), GDx-VCC, HRT II, and clinical evaluation of optic disc photographs to distinguish <b>perimetrically</b> unaffected eyes of glaucoma patients from normal eyes. Results: The parameters with the largest area under the ROC curves (AUC) were as follows: inferior average RNFL thickness (0. 92 ± 0. 03) for StratusOCT; linear cup-to-disc ratio (0. 82 ± 0. 05) for HRT II; and nerve fiber layer index (0. 69 ± 0. 06) for GDx-VCC. Clinical evaluation of stereoscopic disc photographs resulted in AUCs ranging between 0. 80 and 0. 85. The P values for pairwise comparisons of the AUCs of OCT’s best parameter with those of HRT, GDx, and disc photographs were. 06, <. 001, and. 17, respectively. The sensitivities at 95 % specificity for the best parameters from StratusOCT (inferior average), HRT II (cup volume), GDx-VCC (temporal-superior-nasal-inferior-temporal average), and clinical evaluation of disc photographs were 61 %, 39 %, 37 %, and 28 %, respectively. OCT identified more <b>perimetrically</b> normal glaucomatous eyes as having abnormalities, compared to normals, than did HRT (P =. 001), GDx (P =. 001), or clinical evaluation of disc photographs (P <. 001). Conclusion: Optical coherence tomography (StratusOCT) may detect evidence of glaucomatous damage earlier than other imaging techniques and clinical evaluation of optic disc photographs in <b>perimetrically</b> unaffected eyes of primary open-angle glaucoma patients.

40|$|AbstractTo {{investigate}} {{the relationship between}} reaction time (RT), stimulus intensity and visual field eccentricity. We generated frequency of seeing (FOS) curves and measured RTs by testing 10 <b>perimetrically</b> experienced normal subjects with a Humphrey perimeter controlled by a custom program. Subjects were tested from 10 ° to 50 ° eccentricity along the nasal horizontal meridian in 10 ° increments. A range of 20 dB, centered on threshold, was tested in 1 dB steps along with 60 and 0 dB intensities as catch trials. Twenty repetitions for each intensity at each location were used. Linear regression showed {{a significant increase in}} suprathreshold RT (to the 0 dB stimulus) with increasing eccentricity. The RT at the calculated FOS 50 % threshold was prolonged by about 200 ms compared with the RT using the 0 dB target at the equivalent eccentricities. Also, when the difference between the RT at 0 dB stimulus and the RT at threshold was regressed against visual field eccentricity there was a significant decrease with eccentricity. When the RTpi (RT prolongation from threshold relative to the 0 dB stimulus) was plotted as a function of decreasing stimulus attenuation, the results fit the function RTpi=a+bi 3 (i=stimulus intensity) with r 2 > 0. 94 at all eccentricities. However, the slope of the function flattened with increasing eccentricity. Using conventional automated perimetry stimuli in <b>perimetrically</b> experienced young subjects, suprathreshold RT increases but threshold RT prolongation decreases with increasing visual field eccentricity. RT fits a power function with decreasing stimulus attenuation but the slope flattens with eccentricity. This relationship found along the nasal horizontal meridian may allow use of RT to cross-check threshold results or to define response windows for reliability indices of conventional automated perimetry...|$|E

The participants were instructed to detect the circle by pressing a corresponding button. A wavelet transform based on Morlet wavelets was employed for the calculation of oscillatory GBRs. The early evoked GBR exhibited a larger amplitude and shorter latency for the healthy group compared to hemianopic patients and was associated with behavioral measures. The late total GBR between 200 and 400 ms after stimulus onset was significantly increased for Gestalt-like patterns in healthy participants. This effect was not manifested in patients.

(1986). Blindsight: A case study and implications. Oxford: Oxford University Press]. After initial reports of basic form discrimination (Weiskrantz, 1986), it later emerged that this ability to discriminate single stimuli presented to the blind field was probably based on the discrimination of orientation cues [Weiskrantz, L.

In a temporal two alternative forced choice (2 AFC) detection experiment we have investigated the limits of DB's detection ability within his field defect. Blind field performance was compared to his sighted field performance and to an age-matched control group (n= 6). DB reliably detected {{the presence of a}} small (2 degrees), low contrast (7 %), 4. 6 c/ degrees Gabor patch with the same space-averaged luminance as the background presented within his blind field but performed at chance levels at the same eccentricity (11. 3 degrees) within his sighted field. Investigation of detection as a function of stimulus contrast revealed DB's ability to detect the presence of an 8 % contrast stimulus within his blind field, compared to 12 % in his sighted field. No significant difference in detection performance between DB's sighted field and the performance of six age-matched control participants suggests poor sighted field performance does not account for the results.

40|$|Some patients, who are {{rendered}} <b>perimetrically</b> {{blind in}} one hemifield by cortical lesions, nevertheless exhibit residual visual capacities within their field defects. The neural mechanism that mediates the residual visual responses {{has remained the}} topic of considerable debate. One explanation posits the subcortical visual pathways that bypass the primary visual cortex and innervate the extrastriate visual areas as the substrate that underlies the residual vision. The other explanation is that small islands of the primary visual cortex remain intact and provide the signals for residual vision. We have performed behavioral and {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} experiments to investigate the validity of the two explanations of residual vision. Our behavioral experiments indicated that of the seven hemianopes tested, two had the ability to discriminate the direction of a drifting grating. This residual visual response was shown with fMRI {{to be the result of}} spared islands of calcarine cortical activity in one of the hemianopes, whereas only lateral occipital activity was documented in the other patient. These results indicate that the underlying neural correlates of residual vision can vary between patients. Moreover, our study emphasizes the necessity of ruling out the presence of islands of preserved function and primary visual cortex before assigning residual visual capacities to the properties of visual pathways that bypass the primary visual cortex. ...|$|E

METHODS: Thirty-six subjects (12 with no eye disease and 24 with <b>perimetrically</b> diagnosed glaucoma) were examined. One eye for each participant was studied with 3 -Tesla DTI (with automatic generation of mean diffusivity (MD) and fractional anisotropy (FA) values); GDx-VCC, HRT-III and OCT. Single and multiple regression analyses of all variables studied were performed. RESULTS: MD displayed the strongest correlation with linear cup/disc ratio (LCDR) from HTR-III (r= 0. 662), retinal nerve fibre layer (RNFL) thickness (avThickn) from OCT (r=- 0. 644), and nerve fibre index (NFI) from GDx (r= 0. 642); FA was strongly correlated with the LCDR (r=- 0. 499). In multiple regression analyses, MD correlated with LCDR (p= 0. 02) when all variables were considered; with avThickn (p< 0. 01) (analysis of all RNFL parameters); with NFI (p< 0. 01) (analysis of all GDx parameters); with avThickn (p< 0. 01) (analysis of OCT parameters); with LCDR (p= 0. 01) (analysis of HRT-III morphometric parameters) and with linear discriminant function (RB) (p= 0. 02) (analysis of HRT-III indices).

40|$|International audiencePURPOSE. To {{investigate}} {{the characteristics of}} the prelamina and lamina cribrosa (LC) of both eyes in glaucoma patients with unilateral visual field (VF) defect. METHODS. Forty-one subjects diagnosed with primary open-angle glaucoma with unilateral VF loss and 41 age-matched healthy control subjects were scanned by swept-source optical coherence tomography (SS-OCT). All eyes were divided into three groups: VF-affected glaucomatous eyes (group A, n = 41), <b>perimetrically</b> unaffected fellow eyes (group B, n = 41), and healthy control eyes (group C, n = 41). The anterior prelaminar depth (APLD) and LC depth (LCD) were measured {{at the center of the}} reference line (the Bruch's membrane opening plane). The prelaminar tissue thickness (PTT) was obtained by subtracting the APLD from the LCD. The APLD, LCD, and PTT were compared among these groups. RESULTS. The APLD and LCD were significantly greater in group A than in the other groups (group B, P < 0. 001; group C, P < 0. 001). The prelaminar tissue was significantly thinner in group A than in the other groups (group B, P = 0. 007; group C, P < 0. 001). Also, the prelaminar tissue was significantly thinner in group B than in group C (P = 0. 003). Multivariate analysis demonstrated a significant association between PTT and initial IOP among the overall study population (P < 0. 05). CONCLUSIONS. In the fellow eyes with unilateral glaucoma patients, APLD was significantly greater, and the prelaminar tissue was significantly thinner, than in the healthy control eyes. Our findings suggest that subclinical or preperimetric changes of the LC and/or prelaminar tissue are already present in the fellow eyes with unilateral glaucoma...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: In {{a recent}} study, we {{demonstrated}} superior performance of Blue-on-Yellow pattern-onset multifocal VEP in identifying glaucomatous visual field defects {{as compared to}} black and white pattern-reversing checkerboard stimulation. We hypothesized that Blue-on-Yellow stimulation specifically targets non-redundant koniocellular visual pathways, enhancing identification of early losses. Current study was aimed at investigating comparative sensitivity of various pathways using temporally similar (pattern-onset) stimulus presentation technique. Methods: 23 patients with early <b>perimetrically</b> proven glaucoma (MD < 6 dB, repeatable defects) underwent mfVEP using three different pattern-onset stimulation conditions: high (98 %) luminance contrast achromatic (HC), low (50 %) luminance contrast achromatic (LC) and Blue-on-Yellow (BonY) stimulation to preferentially stimulate parvocellular, magmocellular and koniocellular pathways respectively. The order of tests was randomized. Normal database (30 healthy subjects) was constructed for each test condition. Results: The HVF identified scotomas in 28 eyes of the 23 patients. 21 of the scotomas were identified by HC mfVEP (75 %), 26 were identified by BonY (93 %) and all 28 (100 %) by LC mfVEP. Comparison of defect severity using Accumap Severity Index (ASI) demonstrated largest averaged value for LC (62. 7 + 28. 5), followed by BonY (56. 5 + 28. 8) with HC showing less abnormality (41. 5 + 31. 5). ANOVA revealed {{significant differences between the}} groups, with LC and BonY ASI values significantly larger than HC (p< 0. 001 and p< 0. 01 respectively), but no significant difference between LC and BonY (p= 0. 16). Conclusions: Both BonY and LC achromatic mfVEP performed significantly better than HC pattern-onset stimulation in identifying early glaucomatous defects. Enhanced performance of BonY and LC may be attributed to non-redundancy of the koniocellular and magnocellular pathways. 1 page(s...|$|E
40|$|The {{topic of}} the present thesis is the direct {{numerical}} simulation of gas-liquid two-phase flow in rectangular channels with hydraulic diameter {{of the order of}} 1 mm with heat transfer. A new volume-averaged equation for enthalpy is derived and implemented in the finite volume code TURBIT-VoF for the case when both fluids are considered as incompressible. The numerical approximation of this equation reduces the oscillations associated with the discontinuities at the interface using an accurate reconstruction of the convective and conductive heat fluxes. To model convective heat transfer for a spatially periodic two-phase flow in a channel with large length-to-hydraulic diameter ratio, a new concept, called periodic fully developed flow and heat transfer, is proposed. After a few hydraulic diameters away from the channel inlet the flow characteristics are free from entrance effects. For this region, the identification of the periodicity characteristics of the flow enables to restrict the analysis of the flow field and temperature distribution to a single isolated module. As typical example of periodic gas-liquid two-phase flow, the slug flow in small channels is considered. The flow of a train of large bubbles uniformly distributed along a channel with square cross-section is simulated. The bubble shape, the flow structure inside the bubble and in the liquid slug are analyzed. The bubble diameter, bubble velocity and relative bubble velocity for two different capillary numbers are computed and compared with the experimental data from the literature showing good agreement. The convection and conduction of heat inside the channel due to a uniform, both axially and <b>perimetrically,</b> heat flux is also considered. The modification of the temperature field due to the presence of the bubble is analyzed. (orig.)

40|$|Primary {{open angle}} {{glaucoma}} is mostly prevalent in patients over 60 years. However, studies examining {{the role of}} laser scanning tomography in detecting glaucoma hitherto have employed non-population based data drawn from younger subjects. This study employed an elderly, Caucasian, population-based cohort (minimum age 65 years, n= 721). All subjects underwent ophthalmological examination including Goldmann applanation tonometry, suprathreshold automated visual field test and Heidelberg retina tomography. Normality was defined as normal visual acuity, visual field and intraocular pressure. <b>Perimetrically</b> normal males {{were found to have}} significantly larger optic cups than females. Normative data were used to construct three diagnostic tests: Linear regression of rim area, RADAAR (rim area/disc area asymmetry ratio) and the optic disc hemifield test (comparison of the superior and inferior rim/disc area ratios in the temporal and nasal sectors). Specificities at the 99 th limit of normality were 91. 4 %, 95. 1 % and 98. 3 % respectively. Sensitivity was assessed using a cohort of patients (n= 58) with a new diagnosis of open angle glaucoma at the Queen's Medical Centre, Nottingham within the last two years. Sensitivities at the 99 th limit of normality were 72. 4 %, 55. 6 % and 27. 6 % respectively. Applying the regression analysis bilaterally and RADAAR simultaneously generated a specificity of 83. 0 % and sensitivity of 88. 9 %. Inclusion of the optic disc hemifield test did not further increase sensitivity. Linear regression of rim area/disc area was found to be susceptible to non-linearity and heteroscedasticity, causing reduced specificity in bigger optic discs. Modeling the relationship separately for each disc area quartile overcame this limitation to produce a diagnostic test with constant accuracy. Whilst laser scanning ophthalmoscopy can discriminate glaucoma with reasonable accuracy, it is limited by disagreement in contour placement and poor image quality in the elderly. The combination of multiple statistical tests is not ideal - application of statistical shape analysis techniques may better employ the normative data.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{present a}} new perimetric index for calculating {{the rate of}} glaucomatous {{progression}} and to compare its performance with the traditional mean deviation index (MDI). DESIGN: Experimental study describing a device and retrospective cohort study. METHODS: We developed a new visual field index, the glaucoma progression index (GPI), intended to be less affected by cataract than the MDI by calculating age-corrected defect depth at test points identified as significantly depressed in pattern deviation probability maps. The valid operating range for pattern deviation analysis was estimated. When exceeding this range, the total deviation probability maps were used for identification of significantly depressed points. The GPI is expressed in percentage, where 100 % represents a normal visual field and 0 % represents a <b>perimetrically</b> blind field, and is plotted vs patient age. Rate of progression, presented as yearly change in the GPI, is calculated by linear regression analysis. We conducted a pilot evaluation in three groups of patients: 1) eyes with developing cataract, 2) eyes without cataract, and 3) eyes in which cataract surgery was performed {{in the middle of}} the series. RESULTS: The cut-off for pattern deviation was, at mean deviation, worse than - 20 decibels (dB) in fields in which the eighty-fifth percentile of the total deviation value was significantly depressed. In the first group (n = 45), the measured rate of progression was greater with the MDI than with the GPI (P <. 0001). The mean loss per year was 3. 6 %/year for the MDI and 2. 1 %/year for the GPI. In the second group (n = 42), the rate of progression did not differ between the MDI and the GPI (P =. 52); the means were 2. 7 %/year and 2. 6 %/year, respectively. In the third group (n = 44), the confidence limits for the rate of progression were significantly smaller with the GPI than with the MDI (P =. 04). CONCLUSIONS: Glaucoma progression rates calculated using the GPI seem to be considerably less affected by cataract and cataract surgery than rates based on the traditional MDI...|$|E
40|$|The biologically {{inspired}} {{method of}} tail articulation is investigated {{as a means}} of reducing tonal noise due to the stator wake blade interaction in underwater vehicles. This work is experimental in nature and conducted in the closed channel water tunnel at Naval Undersea Warfare Center in Newport, Rhode Island. Tail articulation is carried out with a life scale stator model with hinged flapping tail designed to (i) operate in freestream velocities corresponding to Reynolds number in the range 75, 000 < Re < 300, 000 and (ii) operate at frequencies up to 30 Hz in order to investigate the range of Strouhal number 0. 0 < St < 0. 35. Velocity measurements in the active stator wake are carried out by Laser Doppler Velocimetry, LDV, and Particle Image Velocimetry, PIV, in order to investigate the effects of tail articulation. Time averaged measurements of the stator wake by LDV show that Strouhal number of the tail articulation has a dominant effect on the time mean stator drag. Instantaneous phase averaged measurements of the stator wake by PIV show three regimes of the stator wake as Strouhal number is increased; quasi-steady wake spreading, vortex roll up, and strong vortex wake. A low order model describing the creation and convection of vorticity by tail articulation is developed which describes wake phenomena observed in experimental measurements. A two dimensional blade force simulation coupled with the reduced order tail articulation model is used to <b>perimetrically</b> search for a tail motion resulting in lower unsteady blade forces. (cont.) Finally, a three dimensional unsteady propeller simulation using both experimental wake velocity data by PIV and simulated wake velocity data generated by the reduced order tail articulation model is used to predict the effect of tail articulation on radiated noise. These simulations indicate that reduction of radiated noise by 5 dB or more is possible using tail articulation. by Daniel Lee Macumber. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|Visual {{manifestations of}} {{migraine}} are largely considered transient, without permanent sequelae. Recent findings raise {{the possibility of}} persistent ocular and neural manifestations. This thesis investigates visual function in migraine during the period between episodes by applying various psychophysical tests to two migraine groups (migraine with aura (n = 20) and migraine without aura (n = 20)) and comparing the results to those of a nonheadache control group (n = 20). Tests were designed to address the level of visual system involvement, and to investigate {{the extent to which}} selective visual processes, specifically, motion and other forms of temporal modulation are adversely affected in migraine. The first experiment assessed global processing of complex form and motion in Glass patterns. Compared to nonheadache participants, the migraine groups demonstrated significantly elevated motion detection than motion discrimination thresholds. In contrast, average form detection thresholds were almost identical between subject groups. The second experiment measured <b>perimetrically,</b> in each eye, global motion sensitivity in fifteen localized visual field regions and compared these results in the same subjects to those obtained from conventional luminance-based perimetry. Perimetry testing revealed that two-thirds of migraineurs had localized deficits in motion coherence. Almost all motion field defects occurred in regions of normal sensitivity to the luminance targets. Over 80 % of migrainous visual field defects were nonhomonymous, indicating that dysfunction occurs largely prior to the optic chiasm. Homonymous defects were also detected, raising the possibility of postchiasmal dysfunction, although several of these defects may represent independent monocular losses. The stability of a sample of field defects was retested after a 4 [...] 6 week delay. Sixty-percent of the motion defects persisted. These regions could support normal resolution acuity, but in most cases, not the discrimination of small increments in speed in globally coherent motion. Also included is a study of the spatial and temporal frequency characteristics of visual discomfort to grating patterns. Visual discomfort was experienced by a greater proportion of migraineurs than nonheadache controls, and at significantly lower levels of stimulus contrast in migraineurs than in controls. Gratings modulated at high temporal frequencies were particularly effective in eliciting discomfort in migraineurs. Comparison of individual results across the various tests suggests that functional deficits in migraine (i) are demonstrated on tasks that involve global motion and other forms of temporal modulation, (ii) occur primarily prior to the optic chiasm, but may, in some cases, also involve higher-levels of the visual pathway. Theoretical and clinical implications on migraine pathology and the visual system are discussed...|$|E
