5|$|Boron nitride (along with Si3N4, NbN, and BNC) is {{reported}} to show weak fibrogenic activity, and to cause <b>pneumoconiosis</b> when inhaled in particulate form. The maximum concentration recommended for nitrides of nonmetals is 10mg/m3 for BN and 4 for AlN or ZrN.|$|E
5|$|Some {{types of}} chronic lung {{diseases}} {{are classified as}} restrictive lung disease, because of a restriction {{in the amount of}} lung tissue involved in respiration. These include pulmonary fibrosis which can occur when the lung is inflamed {{for a long period of}} time. Fibrosis in the lung replaces functioning lung tissue with fibrous connective tissue. This can be due to a large variety of occupational diseases such as Coalworker's <b>pneumoconiosis,</b> autoimmune diseases or more rarely to a reaction to medication.|$|E
5|$|Lanthanum {{has a low}} to {{moderate}} level of toxicity and should be handled with care. The injection of lanthanum solutions produces hyperglycemia, low blood pressure, degeneration of the spleen and hepatic alterations. The application in carbon arc light led to the exposure of people to rare earth element oxides and fluorides, which sometimes led to <b>pneumoconiosis.</b> As the La3+ ion is similar in size to the Ca2+ ion, it is sometimes used as an easily traced substitute for the latter in medical studies. Lanthanum, like the other lanthanides, is known to affect human metabolism, lowering cholesterol levels, blood pressure, appetite, and risk of blood coagulation. When injected into the brain, it acts as a painkiller, similarly to morphine and other opiates, though the mechanism behind this is still unknown.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the passing}} of the 1963 Act, the only {{exceptions}} to the normal statute of limitations (three years after the events that caused the injury, as established by the Law Reform (Limitation of Actions, etc.) Act 1954) were if the claim was being brought for a case of mistake or fraud, in which case the statute of limitations was twelve months from when the claimant could reasonably have been expected to discover the fraud or mistake. In Cartledge v E. Jopling & Sons Ltd the claimant sued Jopling after he developed <b>pneumoconiosis</b> from working in the company's poorly ventilated steel mills. The injuries were sustained in October 1950 but they were not discovered until 1956, and as a result the injured party had no cause of action. Because the injuries had not been discovered until six years after they were caused, and the statute of limitations was three years after the injury itself, Cartledge was not legally allowed to bring a case.|$|E
5|$|Pure carbon has {{extremely}} low toxicity to humans {{and can be}} handled and even ingested safely {{in the form of}} graphite or charcoal. It is resistant to dissolution or chemical attack, even in the acidic contents of the digestive tract. Consequently, once it enters into the body's tissues it is likely to remain there indefinitely. Carbon black {{was probably one of the}} first pigments to be used for tattooing, and Ötzi the Iceman was found to have carbon tattoos that survived during his life and for 5200years after his death. Inhalation of coal dust or soot (carbon black) in large quantities can be dangerous, irritating lung tissues and causing the congestive lung disease, coalworker's <b>pneumoconiosis.</b> Diamond dust used as an abrasive can be harmful if ingested or inhaled. Microparticles of carbon are produced in diesel engine exhaust fumes, and may accumulate in the lungs. In these examples, the harm may result from contaminants (e.g., organic chemicals, heavy metals) rather than from the carbon itself.|$|E

25|$|Silicosis (previously miner's phthisis, grinder's asthma, potter's rot {{and other}} occupation-related names) {{is a form}} of {{occupational}} lung disease caused by inhalation of crystalline silica dust, and is marked by inflammation and scarring in the form of nodular lesions in the upper lobes of the lungs. It is a type of <b>pneumoconiosis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Upon {{returning}} home in 1921, {{he found that}} the Tredegar Iron & Coal Company refused to re-employ him. He did not find work until 1924 and his employer, the Bedwellty Colliery, closed down only ten months later. Bevan then had to endure another year of unemployment. In February 1925, his father died of <b>pneumoconiosis.</b>|$|E
25|$|There are {{numerous}} occupational hazards associated with mining, including exposure to rockdust {{which can lead}} to diseases such as silicosis, asbestosis, and <b>pneumoconiosis.</b> Gases in the mine can lead to asphyxiation and could also be ignited. Mining equipment can generate considerable noise, putting workers at risk for hearing loss. Cave-ins, rock falls, and exposure to excess heat are also known hazards.|$|E
25|$|Prolonged {{inhalation}} {{of asbestos}} fibers can cause serious and fatal illnesses including lung cancer, mesothelioma, and asbestosis (a type of <b>pneumoconiosis).</b> Concern of asbestos-related illness {{in modern times}} began with the 20th century and escalated during the 1920s and 1930s. By the 1980s and 1990s, asbestos trade and use were heavily restricted, phased out, or banned outright in {{an increasing number of}} countries.|$|E
25|$|Chronic lung diseases, such as <b>pneumoconiosis</b> (black lung) {{were once}} common in miners, leading to reduced life expectancy. In some mining {{countries}} black lung is still common, with 4,000 {{new cases of}} black lung {{every year in the}} US (4 percent of workers annually) and 10,000 new cases every year in China (0.2 percent of workers). Rates may be higher than reported in some regions.|$|E
25|$|Coal dust is {{responsible}} for the lung disease known as <b>pneumoconiosis,</b> including black lung disease that occurs among coal miners. The danger of coal dust resulted in environmental legislation regulating work place air quality in some jurisdictions. In addition, if enough coal dust is dispersed within the air in a given area, in very rare circumstances, it can create an explosion hazard under certain circumstances. These circumstances are typically within confined spaces.|$|E
25|$|Asbestosis resembles {{many other}} diffuse {{interstitial}} lung diseases, including other <b>pneumoconiosis.</b> The differential diagnosis includes {{idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis}} (IPF), hypersensitivity pneumonitis, sarcoidosis, and others. The presence of pleural plaquing may provide supportive evidence of causation by asbestos. Although lung biopsy is usually not necessary, the presence of asbestos bodies in association with pulmonary fibrosis establishes the diagnosis. Conversely, interstitial pulmonary fibrosis {{in the absence of}} asbestos bodies is most likely not asbestosis. Asbestos bodies in the absence of fibrosis indicate exposure, not disease.|$|E

Though a shy child, Brenda would sing along with country and pop songs on the radio, and she was {{encouraged}} by her mother to sing for visitors to their house. Inspired {{by the success of}} her sister Loretta Lynn, she learned to play the guitar and sing backup in her brothers' folk band. While still in high school, she began to tour with her sister for a few weeks each summer.|$|E
25|$|Historically, {{coal mining}} {{has been a}} very {{dangerous}} activity, and the list of historical coal mining disasters is long. The principal hazards are mine wall failures and vehicle collisions; underground mining hazards include suffocation, gas poisoning, roof collapse and gas explosions. Chronic lung diseases, such as <b>pneumoconiosis</b> (black lung) were once common in miners, leading to reduced life expectancy. In some mining countries black lung is still common, with 4,000 new cases of black lung every year in the US (4 percent of workers annually) and 10,000 new cases every year in China (0.2 percent of workers).

500|$|Margaret Hale (Daniela Denby-Ashe) and {{her parents}} Maria (Lesley Manville) and Richard (Tim Pigott-Smith) move to the (fictional) {{industrial}} town of Milton, Darkshire, {{in the north of}} England because her father, a clergyman, decides to leave the Church of England and become a Nonconformist. [...] Thanks to his friend, Mr. Bell (Brian Protheroe), he is able to find a house and gains employment as a private tutor. [...] One of his pupils is local mill-owner John Thornton (Richard Armitage), who gets off to a bad start with Margaret when she witnesses him beating a worker whom he has caught smoking in the mill, thus endangering all the workers. Gradually, Margaret gets used to Thornton, but his mother Hannah (Sinéad Cusack) and sister Fanny (Jo Joyner) disapprove of her, believing her haughty and alien to the customs of the North. In the meantime, Margaret attempts to do charitable work among the working classes, and thus comes into contact with Nicholas Higgins (Brendan Coyle) and his daughter, Bessy (Anna Maxwell Martin), who contracted <b>Pneumoconiosis</b> from exposure to the cotton-fibres in the mills. [...] When Bessy became ill at Hamper's Mill, her father moved her to Marlborough Mills, Thornton's mill, because the working environment is better there. In a meeting with fellow mill owners, Thornton says he had a wheel for ventilation installed in all of the rooms of his factory, {{despite the fact that it}} costs a great deal of money. The other industrialists had refused to install a wheel because of the expense.|$|E

The move was necessitated from her father's struggles with Coalworker's <b>pneumoconiosis,</b> or black lung disease. This was caused by years of working in the coal mines and breathing in the coal dust.|$|E
2500|$|Ernie Hall {{joined the}} [...] at Yale University, {{where he also}} taught in the Department of Computer Science. At Yale, his primary focus was in {{diagnostic}} radiography (see Radiography) such as the automated diagnosis of coal workers <b>pneumoconiosis,</b> but he also {{became interested in the}} new field of computed tomography. In 1973, he joined the [...] (SIPI) at the University of Southern California that had been recently formed with support from a DARPA grant to develop computer imaging technologies. In 1976 he joined the University of Tennessee the Image and Pattern Analysis Laboratory. While in Knoxville, Tennessee, he consulted with the Oak Ridge National Laboratory.

2500|$|Middleton {{was invited}} to join the faculty at the University of Wisconsin (UW; in Madison, WI) - then a 2-year medical school - {{immediately}} after his internship. He moved to Madison in 1912 as a Clinical Instructor in Medicine, principally serving students at the fledgling UW student health center, along with its director, Dr. Joseph Spragg Evans. Middleton had broad interests regarding areas of clinical investigation, but they especially centered on sarcoidosis, <b>pneumoconiosis,</b> hematological disorders, infectious diseases and medical history. He steadily rose through the academic ranks, and when the medical school became a four-year degree-granting entity in 1924 and built a university hospital, Middleton emerged as a central figure in the education of third- and fourth-year clinical clerks as well as house officers in internal medicine. He was known for his mastery of the physical examination [...] and for his consummate professionalism. Middleton sign {{is still one of the}} best methods for identifying splenomegaly. A novel and innovative program of [...] "preceptorships" [...] was initiated in 1926, wherein senior medical students were assigned to work with community practitioners throughout Wisconsin as a prelude to internship. That system of mentoring continues to this day. After the death of UW medical school Dean Charles Russell Bardeen in 1935, Middleton was named as his successor. The deanship was a difficult position at that time, because of growing factionalism among academic departments and their faculty members. In spite of that problem, the school flourished under Dean Middleton's guidance over 20 years. He continued to teach actively and to pursue his own research interests despite the administrative demands on his time, ultimately producing more than 300 contributions to the peer-reviewed medical literature. In 1939, the American Board of Internal Medicine was constituted under the aegis of the American Board of Medical Specialties. Middleton was asked to serve as one of the eight initial Board members, and was named Secretary-Treasurer of the organization. He was instrumental in formulating a national curriculum for residency training in internal medicine and a structured system of examination to achieve board-certification in that medical specialty.|$|E
