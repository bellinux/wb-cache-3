40|$|Background: The {{assembly}} of the Drosophila embryo mitotic spindle during prophase depends upon a balance of outward forces generated by cortical dynein and inward forces generated by kinesin- 14 and nuclear elasticity. Myosin II is known {{to contribute to the}} dynamics of the cell cortex but how this influences the prophase force-balance is unclear. Principal Findings: Here we investigated this question by injecting the myosin II inhibitor, Y 27632, into early Drosophila embryos. We observed a significant increase in both the area of the dense cortical actin caps and in the spacing of the spindle <b>poles.</b> <b>Tracking</b> of microtubule plus ends marked by EB 1 -GFP and of actin at the cortex revealed that astral microtubules can interact with all regions of these expanded caps, presumably via their interaction with cortical dynein. In Scrambled mutants displaying abnormally small actin caps but normal prophase spindle length in late prophase, myosin II inhibition produced very short spindles. Conclusions: These results suggest that two complementary outward forces are exerted on the prophase spindle by the overlying cortex. Specifically, dynein localized on the mechanically firm actin caps and the actomyosin-driven contraction of the deformable soft patches of the actin cortex, cooperate to pull astral microtubules outward. Thus, myosin II controls the size and dynamic properties of the actin-based cortex to influence the spacing of the poles of the underlying spindle durin...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a method for}} the fast evaluation of the Sommerfeld integrals for modeling a vertical dipole antenna array in a borehole. When we analyze the antenna inside a medium modeled by multiple cylindrical layers with the Method of Moment (MoM), we need a Green's function including the scattered field from the cylindrical boundaries. We focus on the calculation of Green's functions {{under the condition that}} both the detector and the source are situated in the innermost layer, since the Green's functions are used to form the impedance matrix of the antenna. Considering bounds on the location of singularities on a complex wave number plane, a fast convergent integration path where <b>pole</b> <b>tracking</b> is unnecessary is considered for numerical integration. Furthermore, as an approximation of the Sommerfeld integral, we describe an asymptotic expansion of the integrals along the branch cuts. The pole contribution of TM 01 and HE 11 modes are considered in the asymptotic expansion. To obtain numerical results, we use a fast convergent integration path that always proves to be accurate and efficient. The asymptotic expansion works well under specific conditions. The Sommerfeld integral values calculated with the fast evaluation method is used to model the array antenna in a borehole with the MoM. We compare the MoM data with experimental data, and we show the validity of the fast evaluation method. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
