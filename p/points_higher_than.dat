25|$|Despite {{constant}} {{media attention}} on preference deals, and a widely held {{belief that the}} two party preferred result for the election would be close, the Newspoll figures during the three {{months prior to the}} election showed little alteration in the first preference margin between the parties, nor was there any evidence of any voter volatility. The figures suggested, then, that as the Coalition's first preference vote was healthy, the most likely result was a Government victory. This was born out in the election results when the Liberal first preference vote of 40.5 per cent was 3.4 percentage <b>points</b> <b>higher</b> <b>than</b> in 2001, while Labor's first-preference vote of 37.6 per cent was its lowest since the elections of 1931 and 1934.

The collapse of Labor's primary vote therefore negated this effect, even though 61 out of 150 House of Representatives seats were decided on preferences.|$|E
25|$|University of California, Berkeley Professor David L. Kirp, in his 2011 book, Kids First, and his 2013 book, Improbable Scholars, praised Union City's {{education}} system for bringing poor, mostly immigrant kids (three quarters of whom live in homes where only Spanish is spoken {{and a quarter}} of which {{are thought to be}} undocumented and fearful of deportation) into the educational mainstream. Kirp, who spent a year in Union City examining its schools, notes that while in the late 1970s, Union City schools faced the threat of state takeover, they now boast achievement scores that approximate the statewide average. Kirp also observes that in 2011, Union City boasted a high school graduation rate of 89.5 percent—roughly 10 percentage <b>points</b> <b>higher</b> <b>than</b> the national average, and that in 2012, 75 percent of Union City graduates enrolled in college, with top students winning scholarships to the Ivy League. Kirp singles out the city's practice of enrolling almost every 3- and 4-year-old in kindergarten, and the leadership of Union City High School principal John Bennetti for the positive educational atmosphere in that school.|$|E
