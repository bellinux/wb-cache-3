60|$|The {{following}} pages will contain {{a picture of}} my vagrant life, intermixed with specimens, generally brief and slight, of that great mass of fiction to which I gave existence, and which has vanished like cloud-shapes. Besides the occasions when I sought a <b>pecuniary</b> <b>reward,</b> I was accustomed to exercise my narrative faculty wherever chance had collected a little audience idle enough to listen. These rehearsals were useful in testing the strong points of my stories; and, indeed, the flow of fancy soon came upon me so abundantly that its indulgence was its own reward, though the hope of praise also became a powerful incitement. Since I shall never feel the warm gush of new thought as I did then, let me beseech the reader to believe that my tales were not always so cold as he may find them now. With each specimen will be given a sketch of the circumstances in which the story was told. Thus my air-drawn pictures will be set in frames perhaps more valuable than the pictures themselves, since they will be embossed with groups of characteristic figures, amid the lake and mountain scenery, the villages and fertile fields, of our native land. But I write the book for the sake of its moral, which many a dreaming youth may profit by, though it is the experience of a wandering story-teller.|$|E
6000|$|There is no {{writer of}} the present day who has so much puzzled me by his eccentricities, impracticabilities, and {{capabilities}} as Charles Reade. I look upon him as endowed almost with genius, but as one {{who has not been}} gifted by nature with ordinary powers of reasoning. He can see what is grandly noble and admire it with all his heart. He can see, too, what is foully vicious and hate it with equal ardour. But in the common affairs of life he cannot see what is right or wrong; and as he is altogether unwilling to be guided by the opinion of others, he is constantly making mistakes in his literary career, and subjecting himself to reproach which he hardly deserves. He means to be honest. He means to be especially honest,--more honest than other people. He has written a book called The Eighth Commandment on behalf of honesty in literary transactions,--a wonderful work, which has I believe been read by a very few. I never saw a copy except that in my own library, or heard of any one who knew the book. Nevertheless it is a volume that must have taken very great labour, and have been written,--as indeed he declares that it was written,--without the hope of <b>pecuniary</b> <b>reward.</b> He makes an appeal to the British Parliament and British people on behalf of literary honesty, declaring that should he fail--"I shall have to go on blushing for the people I was born among." [...] And yet of all the writers of my day he has seemed to me to understand literary honesty the least. On one occasion, as he tells us in this book, he bought for a certain sum from a French author the right of using a plot taken from a play,--which he probably might have used without such purchase, and also without infringing any international copyright act. The French author not unnaturally praises him for the transaction, telling him that he is [...] "un vrai gentleman." [...] The plot was used by Reade in a novel; and a critic discovering the adaptation, made known his discovery to the public. Whereupon the novelist became angry, called his critic a pseudonymuncle, and defended himself by stating the fact of his own purchase. In all this he seems to me to ignore what we all mean when we talk of literary plagiarism and literary honesty. The sin of which the author is accused is not that of taking another man's property, but of passing off as his own creation that which he does not himself create. When an author puts his name to a book he claims to have written all that there is therein, unless he makes direct signification to the contrary. Some years subsequently there arose another similar question, in which Mr. Reade's opinion was declared even more plainly, and certainly very much more publicly. In a tale which he wrote he inserted a dialogue which he took from Swift, and took without any acknowledgment. As might have been expected, one of the critics of the day fell foul of him for this barefaced plagiarism. The author, however, defended himself, with much abuse of the critic, by asserting, that whereas Swift had found the jewel he had supplied the setting;--an argument in which there was some little wit, and would have been much excellent truth, had he given the words as belonging to Swift and not to himself.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{examines}} {{the role of}} social rewards in Bentham’s analysis of public management. In his early works on reward, Bentham argued that emulation for honour, social status, {{and in some cases}} also <b>pecuniary</b> <b>rewards</b> were a potent means to stimulate the productivity and efficiency of civil servants. He admired Catherine the Great, the empress of Russia, for the articulated ‘scale of ranks’ she had contrived to stimulate emulation. However, in later moral and political works Bentham became increasingly sceptical about the use of emulation. In the contest for honour, dignity and status he saw a dangerous mechanism that could generate abuses, mismanagement and corruption. In his theory of representative democracy Bentham suggested to replace competition for ‘factitious dignity’ with the love of reputation (or ‘general respect’) as a motive that could stimulate the efficiency of civil servants and strengthen their ‘moral aptitude’, avoiding corruption and preventing aristocracies. The paper argues that this revision marks a key historical turn from a focus on hierarchical social rewards to another on more horizontal and democratic ones...|$|R
40|$|Human capital theory {{holds that}} a higher {{education}} will be pursued {{to the extent}} that its <b>pecuniary</b> <b>rewards</b> outstrip its costs. This notion is founded on the neoclassical economic assumption that expected earnings conditional on educational investment are accurately anticipated by those considering such investments. However, the evidence in support of this thesis is slim and, in the case of South Africa in particular, remains largely untested. This paper - the product of a qualitative study - reports the expected earnings data of Durban University of Technology first-year students who, on the whole, are evidently able to relatively accurately predict their commencing and medium- to long-term earnings. This merited the computation and analysis of expected private rates of return to educational investments which were found to be significantly related to study field and parents' educational attainment, useful knowledge in any description of higher education demand. More importantly, though, the paper argues, possibly somewhat controversially, that human capital theory may offer a more plausible explanation of individual higher education choice if it is unconstrained by its neoclassical economic framework. human capital theory, earnings expectations, expected rate of return, higher education demand, educational investment,...|$|R
