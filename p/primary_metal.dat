25|$|Recyclability is a {{key factor}} of a {{sustainable}} material. It reduces the need to mine new resources and requires less energy than mining. Copper and its alloys are virtually 100% recyclable and can be recycled infinitely without any loss of quality (i.e., copper does not degrade (i.e., downcycle) after each recycling loop as do most non-metallic materials, if they are recyclable at all). Copper retains much of its <b>primary</b> <b>metal</b> value: premium-grade scrap normally contains at least 95% {{of the value of}} <b>primary</b> <b>metal</b> from newly mined ore. Scrap values for competing materials range from about 60% down to 0%. And copper recycling requires only around 20% of the energy needed to extract and process <b>primary</b> <b>metal.</b>|$|E

500|$|In Spokane, {{wood and}} food processing, {{printing}} and publishing, <b>primary</b> <b>metal</b> refining and fabrication, electrical and computer equipment, and transportation equipment are {{leaders in the}} manufacturing sector. Gold mining company Gold Reserve, and Fortune 1000 company Potlatch Corporation– a forest products company that operates as a real estate investment trust– are headquartered in the city proper. Mining, forestry, and agribusiness remain important to the local and regional economy, but Spokane's economy has diversified to include other industries, including the high-tech and biotech sectors. Spokane is becoming a more service-oriented economy {{in the face of}} a less prominent manufacturing sector which declined in the 1980s, particularly as a medical and biotechnology center; Fortune 1000 technology company Itron, for instance, is headquartered in the area. Avista Corporation, the holding company of Avista Utilities, is the only company in Spokane that has been listed in the Fortune 500, ranked 299 on the list in 2002. Other companies with head offices in the Spokane area include technology company Key Tronic, vacation rental provider Stay Alfred, and microcar maker Commuter Cars. Despite diversification to new industries, Spokane's economy has struggled in recent decades. Spokane was ranked the #1 [...] "Worst City For Jobs" [...] in America in both 2012 and 2015, while also ranking #4 in 2014. Additionally, Forbes named Spokane the [...] "Scam Capital of America" [...] in 2009 due to widespread business fraud.

2500|$|In {{addition}} to the active metal the catalysts typically contain a number of [...] "promoters," [...] including potassium and copper. Group 1 alkali metals, including potassium, are a poison for cobalt catalysts but are promoters for iron catalysts. Catalysts are supported on high-surface-area binders/supports such as silica, alumina, or zeolites. Promotors also have an important influence on activity. Alkali metal oxides and copper are common promotors, but the formulation depends on the <b>primary</b> <b>metal,</b> iron vs cobalt. Alkali oxides on cobalt catalysts generally cause activity to drop severely even with very low alkali loadings. C≥5 and CO2 selectivity increase while methane and C2–C4 selectivity decrease. In addition, the alkene to alkane ratio increases.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the issues of}} corporate control and bank power by analyzing relations between commercial banks and firms in the <b>primary</b> <b>metals</b> industry. We construct three models of corporate control: management control, single bank con-trol, and collective bank control. We test the validity of these models for the <b>primary</b> <b>metals</b> industry by comparing (1) frequencies and distributions of bank-corporate in-terlocks and bank-trust department stockholdings; and (2) relationships between bank interlocks and measures of relative short-term debt and dividend payout rate. Our results support none of the models fully but lend partial support to the collective bank-control model. Two additional approaches {{to the study of}} economic power— the resource dependence perspective and the class cohesion perspective—are then discussed and suggestions made for further research. Corporations, and the managers and stockholders that govern them, have enormous power in our society (Bell, 1973); yet our knowledge of how corporations function, and of how they cooperate and compete, is severely limited (Useem, 1979, 1980). The ability of commercial banks and bankers to influence non-financial corporations is one important area that requires mor...|$|R
