5|$|Pyrrho {{said that}} we should refrain from making {{judgment}} as we can never know the true reality. According to Pyrrho, having opinion was <b>possible,</b> <b>but</b> certainty and knowledge are impossible.|$|E
5|$|Closed-circuit: A second rebreather {{containing}} one or {{more independent}} diving cylinders for its gas supply. Using another rebreather as a bail-out is <b>possible</b> <b>but</b> uncommon. Although the long duration of rebreathers seems compelling for bail-out, rebreathers are relatively bulky, complex, vulnerable to damage and require more time to start breathing from, than easy-to-use, instantly available, robust and reliable open-circuit equipment.|$|E
5|$|Definite {{delimitation}} of Huascarán National Park {{was possible}} through the reversion {{of land to}} state control by means of compensated land expropriation. The park's boundaries avoided the inclusion of settlements when <b>possible,</b> <b>but</b> several communities continue to raise livestock, although park authorities try to regulate the practice.|$|E

50|$|A2 {{excludes}} {{individuals that}} exist {{in more than one}} <b>possible</b> world. <b>But</b> because David Lewis accepts the existence of arbitrary mereological sums there are individuals {{that exist in}} several <b>possible</b> worlds, <b>but</b> they are not possible individuals because none of them have the property of being actual. And that is because it is not possible for such a whole to be actual.|$|R
5|$|Gravity {{tends to}} {{contract}} celestial bodies into a perfect sphere, the shape {{where all the}} mass {{is as close to}} the center of gravity as <b>possible.</b> <b>But</b> a rotating star is not spherical in shape, it has an equatorial bulge.|$|E
5|$|In principle, the {{simultaneous}} occurrence of a Solar eclipse and a transit {{of a planet}} is <b>possible.</b> <b>But</b> these events are extremely rare because of their short durations. The next anticipated simultaneous occurrence of a Solar eclipse and a transit of Mercury will be on July 5, 6757, and a Solar eclipse and a transit of Venus is expected on April 5, 15232.|$|E
5|$|Neubronner's {{invention}} was {{at least}} partially motivated {{by the prospect of}} military applications. At the time photographic aerial reconnaissance was <b>possible</b> <b>but</b> cumbersome, as it involved balloons, kites or rockets. The Wright brothers' successful flight in 1903 presented new possibilities, and surveillance aircraft were introduced and perfected during the First World War. But pigeon-based photography, despite its practical difficulties, promised to deliver complementary, detailed photographs taken from a lower height.|$|E

5|$|One of Maria Theresa's {{greatest}} wishes {{was to have}} as many grandchildren as <b>possible,</b> <b>but</b> she {{had only}} about two dozen {{at the time of her}} death, of which all the eldest surviving daughters were named after her, with the exception of Caroline of Parma, her eldest granddaughter by Maria Amalia.|$|E
5|$|The F-22 has {{integrated}} radio functionality, {{the signal}} processing systems are virtualized {{rather than as}} a separate hardware module. There have been several reports on the F-22's inability to communicate with other aircraft, and funding cuts have affected the integration of the Multifunction Advanced Data Link (MADL). Voice communication is <b>possible,</b> <b>but</b> not data transfer.|$|E
5|$|Users of Microsoft Windows {{typically}} install one of {{the native}} binary distributions of Perl for Win32, most commonly Strawberry Perl or ActivePerl. Compiling Perl from source code under Windows is <b>possible,</b> <b>but</b> most installations lack the requisite C compiler and build tools. This also {{makes it difficult to}} install modules from the CPAN, particularly those that are partially written in C.|$|E

5|$|When {{the highway}} {{commission}} started accepting registered routes, the RRR association planned to register their route {{as soon as}} <b>possible.</b> <b>But</b> miscommunication between association members and with the highway commission delayed the actual registration for years. The route became official on April 16, 1918. When the primary highway system was created, the River-to-River Road was assigned Primary Road No. 7.|$|E
5|$|A {{wide variety}} of weather can be found along an {{occluded}} front, with thunderstorms <b>possible,</b> <b>but</b> usually their passage {{is associated with a}} drying of the air mass. Within the occlusion of the front, a circulation of air brings warm air upward and sends drafts of cold air downward, or vice versa depending on the occlusion the front is experiencing. Precipitations and clouds are associated with the trowal, the projection on the Earth's surface of the tongue of warm air aloft formed during the occlusion process of the depression.|$|E
5|$|Another {{similarity}} {{with the}} stegosaurs is the narrow head, which might indicate a selective diet consisting of high-quality fodder. However, Barrett {{pointed out that}} for an animal the size of Scelidosaurus, with a large gut allowing efficient fermentation, the intake of easily digestible food of high energetic value was less important than with smaller animals, that are often critically dependent on it. Norman concluded that Scelidosaurus fed on low scrubby vegetation, with a height up to one metre. Raising itself on its hindlimbs alone, could have vertically increased the feeding envelope and was perhaps anatomically <b>possible,</b> <b>but</b> Norman doubted it was a relevant part of its behaviour.|$|E

5|$|Complicating the picture, Reagan {{suffered}} {{an episode of}} head trauma in July 1989, five years before his diagnosis. After being thrown from a horse in Mexico, a subdural hematoma was found and surgically treated later in the year. Nancy Reagan, citing what doctors told her, asserted that her husband's 1989 fall hastened the onset of Alzheimer's disease, although acute brain injury has not been conclusively proven to accelerate Alzheimer's or dementia. Reagan's one-time physician Daniel Ruge has said it is <b>possible,</b> <b>but</b> not certain, that the horse accident affected the course of Reagan's memory.|$|E
5|$|Data {{is visiting}} D'Sora, but she seems unhappy {{and he is}} acting erratically {{in order to find}} an {{appropriate}} response to make her happy. It becomes evident to the crew that the nebula is causing distortions in space; Picard orders the ship into warp to leave the nebula as quickly as <b>possible</b> <b>but</b> this speeds up the distortions. Whilst investigating them, Lieutenant Van Mayter (Georgina Shore) is killed when a distortion embeds her into the deck. Data discovers that dark matter is causing the distortions. The ship can detect the pockets at short range, but not in enough time {{to move out of the}} way. Worf proposes using a shuttle to lead the Enterprise out, and Picard insists on piloting it alone.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{seemingly}} {{close proximity to}} its neighbouring communities, a motorized pirogue trip to Carabane from Elinkine, the nearest village, takes about thirty minutes; the trip once took {{an hour and a}} half by canoe. Carabane may also be accessed by a two- or three-hour boat trip from Ziguinchor. Travelling from Cap Skirring via Cachouane is also <b>possible,</b> <b>but</b> as a detailed map of the region would make clear, the channels of salt water are not easily navigated.|$|E
