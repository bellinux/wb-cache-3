40|$|Most of the {{analytical}} models devoted {{to determine the}} acoustic properties of a rigid <b>perforated</b> <b>panel</b> consider the acoustic impedance of a single hole and then use the porosity to determine the impedance for the whole panel. However, {{in the case of}} not homogeneous hole distribution or more complex configurations this approach is no longer valid. This work explores some of these limitations and proposes a finite element methodology that implements the linearized Navier Stokes equations in the frequency domain to analyse the acoustic performance under normal incidence of <b>perforated</b> <b>panel</b> absorbers. Some preliminary results for a homogenous <b>perforated</b> <b>panel</b> show that the sound absorption coefficient derived from the Maa analytical model does not match those from the simulations. These differences are mainly attributed to the finite geometry effect and to the spatial distribution of the perforations for the numerical case. In order to confirm these statements, the acoustic field in the vicinities of the perforations is analysed for a more complex configuration of <b>perforated</b> <b>panel.</b> Additionally, experimental studies are carried out in an impedance tube for the same configuration and then compared to previous methods. The proposed methodology is shown to be in better agreement with the laboratorial measurements than {{the analytical}} approach...|$|E

In past studies the estimated entrainment {{in the case of}} the jets issued from the lobed <b>perforated</b> <b>panel</b> was found to be greater than {{in the case of the}} standard circular <b>perforated</b> <b>panel.</b> The lobed flow offers a larger induction and a longer throw, a more uniform distribution of the flow, allowing thermal comfort improvement if such perforated panels were used. We integrated this concept of perforated air diffuser in the air distribution system referred to as “laminar flow ceiling” for the operating rooms in hospital environments. We found that the lobed <b>perforated</b> <b>panel</b> is performing better than the circular <b>perforated</b> <b>panel</b> in isothermal conditions for several volumetric flow rates.

40|$|International audienceThe {{applicability}} of <b>perforated</b> <b>panels</b> {{placed in the}} injection line of a turbulent swirled burner is investigated as a passive control solution for combustion instabilities. <b>Perforated</b> <b>panels</b> backed by a cavity are widely used as acoustic liners, mostly in the hot gas region of combustion chambers to reduce pure tone noises. This paper focuses on the implementation of this technology in the injection line of a burner. The system is used to control the inlet acoustic reﬂection coefficient of the burner to stabilize the combustion. This method is shown to be particularly efficient because high acoustic ﬂuxes issued from the combustion region are concentrated on a small surface area in the injection line. Theoretical results are used to design two types of perforated plates featuring similar acoustic damping properties when submitted to low amplitude pressure ﬂuctuations (linear regime). Their behaviors nonetheless largely differ when facing large pressure ﬂuctuations levels (non linear regime) typical of those encountered during self-sustained combustion oscillations. Design criteria are given to control the reﬂection coefficient of <b>perforated</b> <b>panels</b> submitted to high pressure ﬂuctuations levels and damp thermo-acoustic oscillations. While developed on a labora- tory scale swirled combustor, this method is more general and could easily be adapted to practical combustors...|$|R

The normal incidence sound absorption coefficients of the compound panel absorber are tested experimentally.

40|$|Currently, {{there is}} a great {{interest}} in panel absorber design where porous components are excluded due to environmental and cleaning considerations. For such absorbers, the challenge is to increase the natural, viscous losses to attain an acceptable absorption bandwidth. This dissertation presents two new <b>perforated</b> <b>panel</b> absorber concepts, where the viscous energy dissipation has been enhanced by the use of non-traditional design of the perforations. The first concept is a <b>perforated</b> <b>panel</b> where the perforations has been shaped as small horns. The inner part of the horns have dimensions comparable to microperforated panels. The purpose of the design is to increase the surface area of the opening, increase the flow velocity in the inner part of the horn, and offer a better impedance match to the incoming wave. The concept has been investigated primarily by calculations using the Finite Difference Method. The results indicate that a relatively large absorption bandwidth can be obtained for a horn with wide outer radius and small inner radius. The second concept is a double <b>perforated</b> <b>panel,</b> consisting of two parallel, perforated plates separated by a small distance, typically 0. 1 – 0. 3 mm. The main part of the energy dissipation takes place in the small gap between the plates. Both perforated and slitted variants have been investigated by simulations and experiments. For the slitted palne case, absorption bandwidths equivalent to microperforated panels has been observed. The slitted variant can also be designed to be adjustable, allowing tha lateral distance between the slites in the two plates to be varied. This offers two special features: The maximum absorption coefficient can be adjusted from unity to almost zero, and the resonance frequency can be shifted. A frequency shift of one actave at normal sound incidence has been obtained. dr. ing. dr. ing...|$|E
40|$|A finite {{flexible}} <b>perforated</b> <b>panel</b> {{set in a}} differently perforated rigid baffle is considered. The {{radiation efficiency}} from such a panel is derived using a 2 -D wavenumber domain formulation. This generalization is later used to represent a more practical case of a <b>perforated</b> <b>panel</b> fixed in an unperforated baffle. The perforations are {{in the form of}} an array of uniformly distributed circular holes. A complex impedance model for the holes available in the literature is used. An averaged fluid particle velocity is derived using the continuity equation and the surface pressure is derived using an appropriate momentum equation. The discontinuity in the perforate impedance (due to different hole dimensions or perforation ratio) at the panel-baffle interface is carefully taken into account. It is found that there exists a `coupling' of different wavenumbers of the spatially mean fluid particle velocity field. The change in the resonance frequencies and the modeshapes of the panel due to the perforations is taken into account using the Receptance method. Analytical expressions for the radiated power and radiation efficiency are derived in an integral form and numerical results are presented. Several comparisons are made to understand the radiation efficiency curves. Since both the resistive and reactive components of the hole impedance are taken into account, the model is directly applicable to micro-perforated panels also. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

It is experimentally demonstrated that though the HIE is mostly an added mass effect, the nonlinear resistance parameters depend on the separation distance between the holes. Analysis of the data shows that even with HIE, the nonlinear reactance dependency with velocity is very slight compared to the resistance-velocity-dependency. Microperforated panels of 2 mm thickness with varying pitches between holes were made and tested. Some classical models (based on Fok's functions) demonstrating holes interaction effects are compared to the experimental results performed with an impedance tube.
