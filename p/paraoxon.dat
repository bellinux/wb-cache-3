25|$|PON1 {{in humans}} is encoded by the PON1 gene {{which is located}} on the long arm of {{chromosome}} 7. Although many nutritional, life-style and pharmaceutical modulators of PON1 are known., by far the biggest effect on PON1 activity levels, which can vary by over 40 fold between individuals, is through PON1 genetic polymorphisms. The coding region PON1-Q192R polymorphism determines a substrate dependent effect on activity. Some substrates e.g. <b>paraoxon</b> are hydrolysed faster by the R- isoform while others such as diazoxon and lipid-peroxides are hydrolysed more rapidly by the Q- isoform. Both the coding region PON1-L55M and the promoter region PON1-T-108C polymorphisms are associated with different serum concentrations and therefore activities. The 55L allele results in significantly higher PON1 mRNA and serum protein levels and therefore activity compared to the 55M allele. The -108C allele has greater promoter activity than the -108T allele which results in different serum activities.|$|E

They {{were related to}} organophosphate-induced lung cholinesterase inhibition. A single pass procedure was used to perfuse the lungs with an artificial medium perfusate containing <b>paraoxon</b> or parathion. The <b>paraoxon</b> and parathion concentrations were determined in the effluents collected at chosen intervals over an 18 -min period beginning {{at the start of}} perfusion. Three inflowing concentrations (1 nmol/ml, 10 nmol/ml, and 20 nmol/ml) were tested in guinea pig lungs and one (10 nmol/ml) in rabbit lungs. Cholinesterase activity was determined at time 0 {{and at the end of}} the experiment. The lungs abundantly extracted <b>paraoxon</b> and parathion over the perfusion period. The extraction ratio was consistently greater in guinea pig than in rabbit lungs. The uptake velocity varied biexponentially in time, suggesting the existence of two compartments. Initial uptake velocities (A, B) and slopes (alpha and beta) were calculated for both compartments. In guinea pigs, A, B and A + B increased proportionally to the supply rate of <b>paraoxon</b> and parathion while a and b remained constant. No significant difference was observed between parathion and <b>paraoxon</b> uptake kinetics. Parameter B was the only one to differ significantly between the two species (rabbits: 8. 19 +/- 1. 53 for parathion and 6. 85 +/- 1. 26 for paraoxon; guinea pigs: 12. 75 +/- 0. 88 for parathion and 15. 02 +/- 3. 84 for <b>paraoxon).</b> In the lungs of both species, there was a linear relation between y, the percentage of cholinesterase inhibition induced by either organophosphate, and X, the total amount of drug taken up by the lung tissue (in nmol/g/ 18 min). The following equations were obtained: y = 0. 128 x + 0. 979 (R 2 = 0. 89, p < 0. 001 for paraoxon); y = 0. 120 x - 6. 57 (R 2 = 0. 82, p < 0. 005 for parathion). No difference was observed between the two organophosphates. After treatment with the cytochrome P 450 inhibitor piperonyl butoxide, the above relations ceased to apply, but this treatment did not influence the kinetics of <b>paraoxon</b> and parathion uptake. The IC 50 value calculated for <b>paraoxon,</b> i. e., the <b>paraoxon</b> concentration required to produce 50 % inhibition of lung cholinesterase activity, was similar for guinea pigs (2. 22 10 (- 7) +/- 0. 22 M) and rabbits (2. 36 10 (- 7) +/- 0. 24 M). In conclusion, the biexponential evolution of the velocity of <b>paraoxon</b> and parathion uptake by the lungs thus demonstrates the presence of two pools. The lower extraction ratios calculated for rabbit lungs reflect the lower initial uptake velocity of the second compartment.

The edema induced by <b>paraoxon</b> has been previously related to a chain reaction mediated by acetylcholine. Lungs were ventilated and blood-free perfused with a constant flow. Arterial and venous pressures and lung weight were continuously recorded. Endothelial permeability was evaluated by measuring the capillary filtration coefficient (Kf,c). <b>Paraoxon</b> (4 x 10 (- 4) M) was injected in the perfusion circuit, in lungs with or without pretreatment with atropine, ketanserin, clonidine, morphine, indomethacin, and terfenadine plus cimetidine. <b>Paraoxon</b> induced a time-dependent increase in the Kf,c, a maximal effect being recorded 60 min after the injection. All the antagonists used as pretreatment significantly reduced the maximal effect recorded after <b>paraoxon.</b> These results show that muscarinic receptor antagonists, inhibitors of neuropeptides release, cyclooxygenase inhibitors, and 5 -hydroxytryptamine and histamine receptor antagonists can protect the lung against the edema induced by <b>paraoxon.</b> This {{protective effect}} is due to inhibition of the chain reaction triggered by acetylcholine.

40|$|Background: Diazinon and <b>paraoxon</b> are a {{group of}} {{pesticide}} organophosphates which are widely used in agriculture. Some organophosphates increase the production of free radicals. This study aims to compare the effects of diazinon and <b>paraoxon</b> on biomarkers of oxidative stress in rat serum. Materials and Methods : This experimental study was performed in 2010 in Baqiyatallah (a. s) University of Medical Sciences. 49 male Wistar rats were randomly divided into 7 groups: the control group was given corn oil as a solvent of diazinon and <b>paraoxon</b> and the other six groups were given diazinon at doses 30, 50 and 100 mg/kg and <b>paraoxon</b> at doses 0. 3, 0. 7 and 1 mg/kg intraperitoneally. 24 hours after the injection, blood was collected by cardiac puncture and serum was prepared. Then, the activities of butrylcholinesterase enzyme (BChE), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and glutathione level (GSH) were measured by chemical methods. Results: The decreased SOD and CAT activities and GSH level after administration of Diazinon (more than 30 mg/kg) and <b>paraoxon</b> (more than 0. 3 mg/kg) is significant compared to control group, whereas the activity of LDH enzyme significantly increases. The decreased BChE activity is not significant compared to control group. Conclusion: Diazinon and <b>paraoxon</b> induce the production of free radicals and oxidative stress in a dose-dependent manner. The decreased activity of antioxidant enzymes and depleted GSH content probably represent the antioxidant defense system failure against the toxic actions of free radicals and oxidative tissue damage. <b>Paraoxon</b> has more severe effects than diazinon...|$|E

A single oral dose of 16 mg/kg of aldrin protected mice 4 days later against parathion, <b>paraoxon,</b> tetraethyl pyrophosphate, diisopropyl fluorophosphate, 0 -ethyl 0 -p-nitrophenylphosphor othioate, Guthion, tri-o-tolylphosphate and physostigmine, but not against octamethyl py rophosphoramide (OMPA) or neostigmine. One hour after aldrin, the toxicity of parathion was increased, whereas, from 16 hr to 12 days after aidrin, animals were significantly pro tected. This effect of aldrin reached its maximum in about 4 days, and 1 mg/kg provided significant protection. Two days after aidrin, A-esterase, which detoxifies <b>paraoxon,</b> in creased 38 % {{in the liver}} but decreased 50 % in the plasma, and plasma B-esterase, which is inhibited by <b>paraoxon,</b> was increased 24 %. Aldrin {{had no effect on}} the inhibitory action of <b>paraoxon</b> on plasma cholinesterase, but it reduced this action of <b>paraoxon</b> in the brain. This is in accord with the finding that aldrin failed to protect against OMPA or neostigmine, which differ from the other anticholinesterases tested in being poor in vivo inhibitors of brai...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Since organophosphorus {{compounds}} (OP) are toxic {{and designed to}} destroy insects and pest species, there are many hazards associated with their use. Although, the main target site of these compounds is acetylcholinesterase (AChE), however {{it has become increasingly}} evident that OPs have also other direct effects on cellular processes. In the present study, the effects of low concentrations of <b>paraoxon</b> and its interaction with forskolin, an activator of protein kinase A (PKA), were studied on Ca 2 + spike configuration and frequency in neurons of snail Caucasotachea atrolabiata. Methods: Subesophageal ganglia neurons were recorded in current clamp mode in Na+ free Ringer solution that contained voltage dependent potassium channel blockers, 4 AP and TEA. Results: <b>Paraoxon</b> (0. 3 - 0. 6 μM) decreased the duration of spontaneous Ca 2 + spikes. This effect was seen with a suppression of single spike AHPs, leading to an increment in firing rate. <b>Paraoxon</b> induced hyperactivity appeared to be a consequence of decrease in Ca 2 + influx during spikes which is the main determinant of AHP duration by activating Ca 2 + dependent potassium channels. Forskolin (25 μM), {{in the absence of a}} significant change in spike duration, decreased the duration of single spike AHPs and increased the frequency of spikes. After forskolin application, <b>paraoxon</b> decreased the duration of Ca 2 + spikes and AHPs, and increased the activity. However, these effects, especially on spike duration, were not as pronounced as in the absence of forskolin. Conclusion: These findings suggest that although forskolin, similar to <b>paraoxon,</b> decreases the AHP and increases the frequency of spikes but it employs mechanism(s) different from <b>paraoxon</b> which also oppose the effects of <b>paraoxon</b> on Ca 2 + spikes configuration and frequency...|$|E
40|$|Organophosphates (OPs) are {{potentially}} able to affect serine proteases by reacting with their active site. The potential effects of OPs on coagulation {{factors such as}} thrombin and on coagulation tests have been only partially characterized and potential interactions with OPs antidotes such as oximes and muscarinic blockers have not been addressed. In the current study, we investigated the in vitro interactions between coagulation, thrombin, the OP <b>paraoxon,</b> and its antidotes obidoxime and atropine. The effects of these substances on thrombin activity were measured in a fluorescent substrate and on coagulation by standard tests. Both <b>paraoxon</b> and obidoxime but not atropine significantly inhibited thrombin activity, and prolonged prothrombin time, thrombin time, and partial thromboplastin time. When <b>paraoxon</b> and obidoxime were combined, a significant synergistic effect was found on both thrombin activity and coagulation tests. In conclusion, <b>paraoxon</b> and obidoxime affect thrombin activity and consequently alter {{the function of the}} coagulation system. Similar interactions may be clinically relevant for coagulation pathways in the blood and possibly in the brain...|$|E
40|$|Background Organophosphate {{pesticides}} (OP) {{are applied}} to agricultural farms and can be carried away into closely sewerage and gullies, which consequently carry water to rivers and lakes and when distributed in the environment they become polluted and require remediation. Objectives The current study aimed at producing a genetically engineered Pseudomonas plecoglossicida capable of biodegradation of the organophosphate pesticides, <b>paraoxon.</b> Methods Genetically engineered P. plecoglossicida was initially made by transferring polymerase chain reaction (PCR) product of opd gene from Flavobacterium sp. ATCC 27551 into the chromosome of P. plecoglossicida. Results The constructed strain could hydrolyze <b>paraoxon</b> to p-nitrophenol and di-ethylphosphate in <b>paraoxon</b> supplemented in complete supplement mixture (CSM) medium. The isolate could use <b>paraoxon</b> as {{the only source of}} carbon. Thus, the bacteria degraded the organophosphate pesticides, and utilized nutrient products of their degradation. Conclusions The observed versatility of genetically engineered P. plecoglossicida in biodegradation of xenobiotics suggested that this strain may be useful for the multipurpose bioremediation of contaminated agricultural and industrial sites...|$|E
