5|$|Georgia began proposing the {{placement}} of international <b>peacekeeping</b> <b>forces</b> in the separatist regions when Russia began to apply more pressure on Georgia after April 2008. The West launched new initiatives for peace settlement, with peace plans being offered and conferences being organised by the European Union, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and Germany. Georgia accepted the German project for Abkhazia, but the separatists dismissed it. Russia and the separatists did not attend an EU-funded peace conference on Abkhazia. They also dismissed an OSCE offer to renew talks regarding South Ossetia.|$|E

5|$|The United Nations {{had tried}} {{several times to}} {{reconcile}} {{the government of the}} Congo with the State of Katanga, which had declared independence under Moïse Tshombe with Belgian support in 1960. Though initially limiting its actions, the United Nations Operation in the Congo became increasingly impatient towards Katanga and Tshombe and drew up plans to resolve the situation through force. Tshombe continuously violated agreements he had made with the United Nations and the Congolese government by building up his forces and bringing foreign mercenaries into the conflict. The situation came to a breaking point in December 1962 when Katangese gendarmes attacked <b>peacekeeping</b> <b>forces</b> in Katanga. United Nations Secretary-General U Thant authorised a retaliatory offensive to eliminate secessionist opposition.|$|E
5|$|By the 1960s, {{debate for}} an {{official}} Canadian flag intensified {{and became a}} subject of controversy, culminating in the Great Flag Debate of 1964. In 1963, the minority Liberal government of Lester B. Pearson gained power and decided to adopt an official Canadian flag through parliamentary debate. The principal political proponent of the change was Pearson. He had been a significant broker during the Suez Crisis of 1956, {{for which he was}} awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. During the crisis, Pearson was disturbed when the Egyptian government objected to Canadian <b>peacekeeping</b> <b>forces</b> {{on the grounds that the}} Canadian flag (the Red Ensign) contained the same symbol (the Union Flag) also used as a flag by the United Kingdom, one of the belligerents. Pearson's goal was for the Canadian flag to be distinctive and unmistakably Canadian. The main opponent to changing the flag was the leader of the opposition and former prime minister, John Diefenbaker, who eventually made the subject a personal crusade.|$|E

5|$|In March 1992, {{the start}} of the UNTAC mission in Cambodia was marked by the arrival of 22,000 UN peacekeepers, which {{included}} troops from 22 countries, 6,000 officials, 3,500 police and 1,700 civilian employees and electoral volunteers. The mission was led by Yasushi Akashi. In June 1992, the Khmer Rouge formally established the National Union Party of Kampuchea, and announced that it would not register to participate in the upcoming elections. Furthermore, the Khmer Rouge also refused to disarm its forces in accordance with the Paris agreement. Then, to prevent ethnic Vietnamese from taking part in the elections, the Khmer Rouge started massacring Vietnamese civilian communities, causing hundreds of thousands of Vietnamese to flee Cambodia. Towards the end of 1992, Khmer Rouge forces advanced into Kampong Thom in order to gain a strategic foothold, before UN <b>peacekeeping</b> <b>forces</b> were fully deployed there. In {{the months leading up to}} the elections, several UN military patrols were attacked as they entered Khmer Rouge-held territory.|$|E
5|$|In mid-2000 the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET) {{invited a}} team from King's College London to conduct a study of East Timor's {{security}} force options. The team's report identified three options for an East Timorese military. Option1 was based on FALINTIL's preference for a relatively large and heavily armed military of 3,000–5,000 personnel, option2 was a force of 1,500 regulars and 1,500 conscripts and option3 was for a force of 1,500 regulars and 1,500 volunteer reservists. The study team recommended option3 as being best suited to East Timor's security needs and economic situation. This recommendation was accepted by UNTAET in September 2000 and {{formed the basis of}} East Timor's defence planning. The plan was also accepted by all the countries that had contributed <b>peacekeeping</b> <b>forces</b> to East Timor. The King's College report has been criticised {{on the grounds that it}} led East Timor to establish a large police force and a large Army when its security needs may have been better met by a single smaller paramilitary force.|$|E
