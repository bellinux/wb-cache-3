40|$|Thesis (Ph. D. (Business Management)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2004. The {{operating}} {{environment in which}} banks conduct their business, especially the credit risk environment, underwent significant changes since {{the latter half of}} the previous decade. Developments have resulted in a bombardment of quantitative and qualitative credit risk information and data on the one hand, and on the other an absence of a clear focus and management approach and philosophy to effectively manage credit risk. The primary objective of the research was the formulation of a process approach that could be applied in the management of credit risk of credit asset portfolios. Part of the objective was an implicit requirement that it should form the foundation from where the management of credit risk can be leveraged to exploit all the dimensions of credit risk while focussing on the maximisation of shareholder wealth. A literature study was undertaken to determine the theoretical aspects regarding the management of credit asset <b>portfolios,</b> credit risk <b>management,</b> the credit <b>portfolio</b> risk <b>management</b> approach and its principles. An empirical study aimed to establish the credit risk management practices being applied in the South African Banking Industry. The process approach developed for managing credit asset portfolios incorporate the account life cycle as point of departure. This was necessary to facilitate the various processes that need to be considered for effective credit <b>portfolio</b> risk <b>management.</b> The specific data requirements, as it culminate in a credit <b>portfolio</b> risk <b>management</b> functionality, enable the credit <b>portfolio</b> risk <b>management</b> approach and principles to be applied to credit asset portfolios within the context of two perspectives to credit <b>portfolio</b> risk <b>management,</b> namely: > The economic value perspective (also referred to as the shareholder wealth perspective) which has an ex post focus (after default has occurred) and which calculates the impact of credit risk on Credit RAROC or shareholder value; and > The earnings perspective which has an ex ante focus (before default occurs) and which addresses the bank's loss in income as a result of, and associated with, deterioration in credit standing (the cash flow implication to be considered when credit standing deteriorates). Applying the developed process approach to credit asset portfolios, two distinctive but dependent dimensions with underlying sub-dimensions to <b>portfolio</b> risk <b>management</b> is identified namely, micro <b>portfolio</b> risk <b>management</b> and macro <b>portfolio</b> risk <b>management.</b> The former focuses on the credit asset portfolio and the latter on the group portfolio in the context of all risks impacting the organisation. The final stage in the process approach is to establish a Business Health Forum that reports to the Board appointed committees. The forum ensures an independent view of all the risks and activities of the business, including credit risk. Adopting and applying the developed framework regarding the process approach to managing credit asset portfolios in a South African bank will assist executive management to ensure that the requirements (processes, systems, data) for effective credit <b>portfolio</b> risk <b>management</b> are met. It would also broaden the understanding regarding the interdependency between profit, sustainable growth and effective credit <b>portfolio</b> risk <b>management.</b> Doctora...|$|R

25|$|Risk {{management}} involves {{analyzing the}} market and credit risk that an investment bank or its clients take onto their balance sheet during transactions or trades. Credit risk focuses around capital markets activities, such as syndicated loans, bond issuance, restructuring, and leveraged finance. Market risk conducts review of sales and trading activities utilizing the VaR model and provide hedge-fund solutions to portfolio managers. Other risk groups include country risk, operational risk, and counterparty risks {{which may or may}} not exist on a bank to bank basis. Credit risk solutions are key part of capital market transactions, involving debt structuring, exit financing, loan amendment, project finance, leveraged buy-outs, and sometimes portfolio hedging. Front office market risk activities provide service to investors via derivative solutions, <b>portfolio</b> <b>management,</b> portfolio consulting, and risk advisory. Well-known risk groups in JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and Barclays engage in revenue-generating activities involving debt structuring, restructuring, syndicated loans, and securitization for clients such as corporates, governments, and hedge funds. J.P. Morgan IB Risk works with investment banking to execute transactions and advise investors, although its Finance & Operation risk groups focus on middle office functions involving internal, non-revenue generating, operational risk controls. Credit default swap, for instance, is a famous credit risk hedging solution for clients invented by J.P. Morgan's Blythe Masters during the 1990s. The Loan Risk Solutions group within Barclays' investment banking division and Risk Management and Financing group housed in Goldman Sach's securities division are client-driven franchises. However, risk management groups such as operational risk, internal risk control, and legal risk are restrained to internal business functions including firm balance-sheet risk analysis and assigning trading cap that are independent of client needs, even though these groups may be responsible for deal approval that directly affects capital market activities. Risk management is a broad area, and like research, its roles can be client-facing or internal.|$|E
