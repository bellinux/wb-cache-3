Since 1928, the LSA has offered training to linguists through courses held at its biennial Linguistic Institutes held in the summer. The LSA and its 3,500 members work to raise awareness of linguistic issues with the public and contributes to policy debates on issues including bilingual education and the preservation of endangered languages.|$|E
40|$|English as an {{international}} language {{plays an important role}} in crosscultural communication. The main function of language is communication and <b>pragmatic</b> competence is an important component of communicative competence. So lack of <b>pragmatic</b> knowledge leads to <b>pragmatic</b> failure and it prevents from being successful in crosscultural communication. Since <b>pragmatic</b> failure closely relates to English learners’ lack of <b>pragmatic</b> knowledge and understanding of the culture of the target language, in order to improve <b>pragmatic</b> and communicative competence, cultural information and <b>pragmatic</b> knowledge should be incorporated into English language...|$|R

5|$|This view of {{language}} {{is associated with}} the study {{of language}} in pragmatic, cognitive, and interactive frameworks, as well as in sociolinguistics and linguistic anthropology. Functionalist theories tend to study grammar as dynamic phenomena, as structures that are always in the process of changing as they are employed by their speakers. This view places importance on the study of linguistic typology, or the classification of languages according to structural features, as it can be shown that processes of grammaticalization tend to follow trajectories that are partly dependent on typology. In the philosophy of language, the view of <b>pragmatics</b> as being central to language and meaning is often associated with Wittgenstein's later works and with ordinary language philosophers such as J. L. Austin, Paul Grice, John Searle, and W. O. Quine.|$|E

40|$|National {{cultural}} {{distance is}} considered to be a strong predictor of language learners’ <b>pragmatic</b> competence. To test the actual effect of national cultural distance on <b>pragmatic</b> competence holistically and comprehension and production aspects of <b>pragmatic</b> competence discretely, the current study was conducted on two groups of undergraduate student of English: 24 German students considered culturally close to Britons as target language community and 28 South Korean students considered culturally distant from Britons. A 24 -item <b>pragmatic</b> comprehension test developed by Taguchi (2007, 2008) was used to measure language learners’ <b>pragmatic</b> comprehension ability. A discourse completion task developed by Bardovi-Harlig (2009) was also used to measure language learners’ <b>pragmatic</b> production ability. Multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) revealed the significant positive effect of national cultural distance on <b>pragmatic</b> competence holistically and comprehension and production aspects of <b>pragmatic</b> competence discretely. The pedagogical implications of the findings suggested incorporating target language pragmalinguistic and sociopragmatic features into class instruction and providing abundant opportunities for language learners to be exposed to pragmalinguistic and sociopragmatic features of the target language.

40|$|In this paper, the {{semantic}} and <b>pragmatic</b> modules of a spoken dialogue system development platform are presented and evaluated. The main {{goal of this}} research is to create spoken dialogue system modules that are portable across applications domains and interaction modalities. We propose a hierarchical semantic representation that encodes all information supplied by the user over multiple dialogue turns and can efficiently represent and be used to argue with ambiguous or conflicting information. Implicit in this semantic representation is a <b>pragmatic</b> module, consisting of context tracking, <b>pragmatic</b> analysis and <b>pragmatic</b> scoring sub-modules, which computes <b>pragmatic</b> confidence scores for all system beliefs. These <b>pragmatic</b> scores are obtained by combining semantic and <b>pragmatic</b> evidence from the various sub-modules (taking into account the modality of input) and are used to rank-order attribute-value pairs in {{the semantic}} representation, as well as identifying and resolving ambiguities. These modules were implemented and evaluated within a travel reservation dialogue system {{under the auspices of the}} DARPA Communicator project, as well as for a movie information application.

25|$|A {{dialogue}} journal {{allows students}} and a teacher to together use authentic communication (including questioning, complaining, complimenting, apologizing, and requesting) to communicate honestly and openly and “get things done”. This distinguishes it from most student writing assignments, which are restricted to monologic description, explanation, or narrative. This aspect of everyday language use is known in philosophy as speech acts (John Searle) and in linguistics as <b>pragmatics.</b> (J.L.

Specifically, the members of the universal set of a Boolean algebra or group need not be numbers. Moreover, a fair bit of philosophy and theoretical science can be formalized as axiomatic theories embodying first-order logic and set theory. Note also how model theory has been employed to formalize and reason about such emphatically nonnumerical subjects as semantics and <b>pragmatics</b> of natural languages.
