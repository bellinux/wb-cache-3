50|$|In {{addition}} to the free-radical scavenging role, HA may also function in the negative feedback loop of inflammatory activation through its specific biological interactions with the biological constituents of inflammation. TNF-α, an important cytokine generated in inflammation, stimulates the expression of TSG-6 (TNF-stimulated gene 6) in fibroblasts and inflammatory cells. TSG-6, a HA-binding protein, also forms a stable complex with the serum proteinase inhibitor IαI (Inter-α-inhibitor) with a synergistic effect on the latter’s plasmin-inhibitory activity. Plasmin is involved in activation of the proteolytic cascade of matrix metalloproteinases and other proteinases leading to inflammatory tissue damage. Therefore, the action of TSG-6/ IαI complex, which may be additionally organized by binding to HA in the extracellular matrix, {{may serve as a}} potent negative feedback loop to moderate inflammation and stabilize the granulation tissue as healing progresses. In the murine air pouch model of carragenan/IL-1 (Interleukin-1β)-induced inflammation, where HA has been shown to have a <b>proinflammatory</b> <b>property,</b> reduction of inflammation can be achieved by administrating TSG-6, and the result is comparable with systemic dexamethasone treatment.|$|E
40|$|We {{report a}} case of bimatoprost induced serous macular {{detachment}} and choroidal folds following uneventful cataract surgery. A 66 -year-old male using topical bimatoprost in both eyes for open angle glaucoma underwent uneventful cataract surgery in the right eye. Postoperatively, he was restarted on topical bimatoprost and antibiotic-steroids combination drops. One week after surgery, he presented with conjunctival hyperemia, serous macular detachment, and choroidal folds at the posterior pole. Fundus fluorescein angiography showed perifoveal leaks in early stage with pooling of dye in late stage. Discontinuation of bimatoprost led to resolution of serous detachment and choroidal folds within 3 weeks with significant improvement in visual acuity. Occurrence of serous macular detachment and choroidal folds in this case could be probably related to the <b>proinflammatory</b> <b>property</b> of bimatoprost.

40|$|Heat shock {{proteins}} {{have been}} implicated as endogenous activators for dendritic cells (DCs). Without tissue distress or death, these intracellular molecules are inaccessible to surface receptor(s) on DCs, possibly to avoid uncontrolled DC activation and breakdown of immunologic tolerance. We herein addressed this hypothesis in transgenic mice by enforcing cell surface expression of gp 96, a ubiquitous {{heat shock protein}} of the endoplasmic reticulum. Although a pan-specific promoter is used for transgene expression, neither the expression level nor the tissue distribution of the endogenous gp 96 was altered by this maneuver. However, cell surface gp 96 induced significant DC activations and spontaneous lupus-like autoimmune diseases, even though the development/functions of lymphocytic compartments were unaltered. Using a bone marrow chimera approach, we further demonstrated that both DC activation and autoimmunity elicited by cell surface gp 96 are dependent on the downstream adaptor protein MyD 88 for signaling by Toll/IL- 1 receptor family. Our study not only established the <b>proinflammatory</b> <b>property</b> of cell surface gp 96 in vivo, but also suggested a chronic stimulation of DCs by gp 96 as a pathway to initiate spontaneous autoimmune diseases...|$|E

This study aimed to investigate the role of Cyr 61 in progressive kidney fibrosis induced by unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) surgery in mice. The expression of Cyr 61 transcripts and proteins in the obstructed kidneys were increased from day 1 and remained high until day 10 after surgery. Immunohistochemistry indicated that Cyr 61 was expressed mainly in renal tubular epithelial cells. The upregulated Cyr 61 in UUO kidneys was reduced in mice treated with pan-transforming growth factor-b (TGF-b) antibody. The role of TGF-b in tubular Cyr 61 upregulation after obstructive kidney injury was further supported by experiments showing that TGF-b 1 stimulated Cyr 61 expression in cultured tubular epithelial cells. Notably, the upregulation of Cyr 61 in UUO kidneys was followed by a marked increase in monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP- 1) transcripts and macrophage infiltration, which were attenuated in mice treated with anti-Cyr 61 antibodies. This <b>proinflammatory</b> <b>property</b> of Cyr 61 in inducing MCP- 1 expression was further confirmed in tubular epithelial cells cultured with Cyr 61 protein. The anti-Cyr 61 antibody in UUO mice also reduced the levels of collagen type 1 -a 1 transcripts, collagen fibril accumulation evaluated by picrosirius red staining, and the levels of a-smooth muscle actin (a-SMA) transcripts and proteins on day 4 after surgery; however, the antifibrotic effect was not sustained.

40|$|IL- 18 {{shares with}} IL- 1 {{the same family}} of receptors and several {{identical}} signal transduction pathways. Because of these similarities, IL- 18 was investigated {{for its ability to}} induce prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2) synthesis in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), a prominent, <b>proinflammatory</b> <b>property</b> of IL- 1. IL- 18 was highly active in PBMC by inducing the synthesis of the chemokine IL- 8; however, no induction of PGE 2 synthesis nor cyclooxygenase type- 2 gene expression was observed in PBMC stimulated with IL- 18. In the same cultures, IL- 1 β induced a 12 -fold increase in PGE 2. Although IL- 1 β-induced IL- 8 synthesis was augmented 3 -fold by IL- 18, IL- 18 suppressed IL- 1 β-induced PGE 2 production by 40 %. The suppressive effect of IL- 18 on PGE 2 production was mediated by interferon (IFN) -γ because anti-human IFN-γ-antibody prevented IL- 18 -induced reduction in PGE 2. Consistent with these observations, IL- 12, a known inducer of IFN-γ, augmented IL- 1 β-induced IFN-γ but suppressed IL- 1 β-induced PGE 2 by 75 %. IL- 18 binding protein (IL- 18 BP) is a naturally occurring and specific inhibitor of IL- 18. When recombinant IL- 18 BP was added to PBMC cultures, unexpectedly, spontaneous PGE 2 production increased. PGE 2 production was also increased by the addition of IL- 18 BP to PBMC stimulated with either IL- 1 β or IL- 12 and also in whole blood cultures stimulated with Staphylococcus epidermidis. These studies demonstrate that IL- 18 BP decreases endogenous IL- 18 activity by reducing IFN-γ-mediated responses...|$|E

Our data revealed that PapMV rapidly induced two chemokines, macrophage-inflammatory protein (MIP) - 2 /CXC chemokine ligand (CXCL) 2 and interferon-garmma inducible 10 kDa protein (IP- 10) /CXCL 10 in a time and dose-dependent manner. Thereafter, by using various macrophage deficient cell lines (TLR 4 -/-,MyD 88 -/-), we identified that PapMV-induced chemokines expression through a TLR 4 and MyD 88 -dependent signaling pathway. In addition, we obtained data demonstrating that the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway, NF-kappaB, AP- 1 were involved in this signaling. These factors play a pivotal role in regulating PapMV-induced chemokine expression. Collectively, this study represents the first demonstration that a plant virus can be recognized by mammalian cells and trigger an inflammatory signal via TLR 4 /MyD 88 pathway.

However, the factors that influence the functional outcomes of IL- 22 expression remain poorly defined. We demonstrate that after administration of a high dose of bleomycin that induces acute tissue damage and airway inflammation and is lethal to wild-type (WT) mice, Th 17 cell–derived IL- 22 and IL- 17 A are expressed in the lung. Bleomycin-induced disease was ameliorated in Il 22 −/− mice or after anti–IL- 22 monoclonal antibody (mAb) treatment of WT mice, indicating a proinflammatory/pathological role for IL- 22 in airway inflammation. However, despite increased bleomycin-induced IL- 22 production, Il 17 a−/− mice were protected from airway inflammation, suggesting that IL- 17 A may regulate the expression and/or <b>proinflammatory</b> <b>properties</b> of IL- 22. Consistent with this, IL- 17 A inhibited IL- 22 production by Th 17 cells, and exogenous administration of IL- 22 could only promote airway inflammation in vivo by acting in synergy with IL- 17 A. Anti–IL- 22 mAb was delivered to Il 17 a−/− mice and was found to exacerbate bleomycin-induced airway inflammation, indicating that IL- 22 is tissue protective in the absence of IL- 17 A. Finally, in an in vitro culture system, IL- 22 administration protected airway epithelial cells from bleomycin-induced apoptosis, and this protection was reversed after coadministration of IL- 17 A. These data identify that IL- 17 A can regulate the expression, <b>proinflammatory</b> <b>properties,</b> and tissue-protective functions of IL- 22, and indicate that {{the presence or absence of}} IL- 17 A governs the <b>proinflammatory</b> versus tissue-protective <b>properties</b> of IL- 22 in a model of airway damage and inflammation...|$|R

We report here that several broad-spectrum HDAC inhibitors, including TSA and SAHA, suppressed the LPS-induced mRNA {{expression of the}} proinflammatory mediators Edn- 1, Ccl- 7 /MCP- 3, and Il- 12 p 40 but amplified {{the expression of the}} proatherogenic factors Cox- 2 and Pai- 1 /serpine 1 in primary mouse BMM. Similar effects were also apparent in LPS-stimulated TEPM and HMDM. The pro-and anti-inflammatory effects of TSA were separable over a concentration range, implying that individual HDACs have differential effects on macrophage inflammatory responses. The HDAC 1 -selective inhibitor, MS- 275, retained proinflammatory effects (amplification of LPS-induced expression of Cox- 2 and Pai- 1 in BMM) but suppressed only some inflammatory responses. In contrast, 17 a (a reportedly HDAC 6 -selective inhibitor) retained anti-inflammatory but not <b>proinflammatory</b> <b>properties.</b> Despite this, HDAC 6 (-/-) macrophages showed normal LPS-induced expression of HDAC-dependent inflammatory genes, arguing that the anti-inflammatory effects of 17 a are not a result of inhibition of HDAC 6 alone.

Objectives: To investigate the expression and roles of IL- 22 in the onset and resolution of experimental allergic asthma and its cross-talk with IL- 17 A. Methods: IL- 22 expression was assessed in patient samples and in the lung of mice immunized and challenged with ovalbumin. IL- 22 functions in allergic airway inflammation were evaluated using mice deficient in IL- 22 or anti-IL- 22 neutralizing antibodies. Moreover, the effects of recombinant IL- 22 and IL- 17 A neutralizing antibodies were investigated. Measurements and Main Results: Increased pulmonary IL- 22 expression {{is found in the}} serum of patients with asthma and mice immunized and challenged with ovalbumin. Allergic lung inflammation is IL- 22 dependent because eosinophil recruitment, Th 2 cytokine including IL- 13 and IL- 33, chemokine production, airway hyperreactivity, and mucus production are drastically reduced in mice deficient in IL- 22 or by IL- 22 antibody neutralization during immunization of wild-type mice. By contrast, IL- 22 neutralization during antigen challenge enhanced allergic lung inflammation with increased Th 2 cytokines. Consistent with this, recombinant IL- 22 given with allergen challenge protects mice from lung inflammation. Finally, IL- 22 may regulate the expression and <b>proinflammatory</b> <b>properties</b> of IL- 17 A in allergic lung inflammation. Conclusions: IL- 22 is required for the onset of allergic asthma, but functions as a negative regulator of established allergic inflammation.

40|$|Objective Systemic lupus {{erythematosus}} (SLE) is an autoimmune disease with chronic or episodic inflammation in several organ systems, {{related to the}} presence of circulating and tissue-deposited immune complexes (ICs) that stimulate leukocytes through Fc? receptors (Fc?R) with subsequent inflammation. Treatment with endoglycosidase S (EndoS), an IgG glycanhydrolyzing bacterial enzyme from Streptococcus pyogenes, has shown beneficial effects in several experimental animal models of chronic inflammatory disease. This study was undertaken to investigate whether EndoS affects the <b>proinflammatory</b> <b>properties</b> of ICs and {{has the potential to be}} developed as a therapy for SLE. Methods ICs purified from SLE patients or RNA-containing ICs formed in vitro were treated with EndoS and used in several assays reflecting different important features of SLE pathogenesis, such as phagocytosis by polymorphonuclear cells (PMNs) and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (PDCs), complement activation, and interferon-a (IFNa) production by PDCs. Results EndoS treatment abolished all <b>proinflammatory</b> <b>properties</b> of the ICs investigated. This included Fc?R-mediated phagocytosis by PDCs (P = 0. 001) and subsequent production of IFNa (P = 0. 002), IC-induced classical pathway of complement activation (P = 0. 008), chemotaxis, and oxidative burst activity of PMNs (P = 0. 002). EndoS treatment also had a direct effect on the molecular structure of ICs, causing decreased IC size and glycosylation.

40|$|The {{foundation}} of this thesis was laid in 1982 {{when we made}} the first studies of the production of inflammatory mediators by macrophages collected from effluent dialysate of patients on Continuous Ambulatory Dialysis (CAPD). During the frrst experiments, these cells, harvested from infection-free patients, proved to be suitable for immunopharmacological studies (4). When macrophages were collected when CAPD was complicated by an infectious peritonitis, the cells exhibited some striking differences in comparison with macrophages that were collected when the patients were infection-free. Notably {{the finding that the}} release of prostaglandins and the intracellular cAMP levels were decteased in macrophages collected during an episode of peritonitis, was intriguing (2). While prostaglandins are well known for their <b>proinflammatory</b> <b>properties</b> they can have antiinflammatory properties as well thought to be mediated by stimulating intracellular cAMP levels (3). At that time emphasis was put on the <b>proinflammatory</b> <b>properties</b> of prostaglandins, while the relevance of t. l:te antiinflammatory properties to in vivo conditions was sometimes questioned. Tne finding that macrophages from an inflammatory environment showed a decrease in the release of prostaglandins, might indicate, that prostaglandins fulfil antiinflammatory-immunomodulatory rather than proinflammatory functions with regard to these macrophages during the acute phase of an inflammation. A decrease in the release of the antiinflammatory prostaglandins could allow macrophages to become "activated" during an infection (7). To test this postulate I proposed, in 1983, to i [...] -tvestigate the secretion of the proinfla. 'lliDatory "factor" later identified as interleukin- 1 : IL-l, by using peritoneal macrophages isolated from CAPD patients during peritoPitis and during an infection-free period. The following questions had to be answered: 1) Is the decreased secretion of the antii'l. flammatory prostaglandins, as found during peritonitis, associated with increased secretion of the proinflammatory IL-l? 2) Do prostaglandins have inhibitory effects on IL-l secretion? These questions underlie the studies of this thesis. IL-l secretion by peritoneal macrophages from infected patients as compared to infection-free patients, is described in chapter 5. In chapter 6, the relationship between the secretion of IL-lB and that of prostaglandins (PGEz, PGI:J was studied. In chapter 7, the in vitro secretion of Tumor Necrosis Factor ex (TNFcx), an other cytokine with <b>proinflammatory</b> <b>properties,</b> by peritoneal macrophages from infected patients is compared with that of infection-free patients.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Polymorphonuclear {{neutrophils}} (PMNs) {{have gained}} attention as critical mediators of acute coronary syndromes (ACS). Myeloperoxidase (MPO), a hemoprotein abundantly expressed by PMNs and secreted during activation, possesses potent <b>proinflammatory</b> <b>properties</b> and may contribute directly to tissue injury. However, whether MPO also provides prognostic information {{in patients with}} ACS remains unknown. METHODS AND RESULTS: MPO serum levels were assessed in 1090 patients with ACS. We recorded death and myocardial infarctions during 6 months of follow-up. MPO levels did not correlate with troponin T, soluble CD 40 ligand, or C-reactive protein levels or with ST-segment changes. However, patients with elevated MPO levels (> 350 microg/L; 31. 3 %) experienced a markedly increased cardiac risk (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 2. 25 [1. 32 to 3. 82]; P= 0. 003). In particular, MPO serum levels identified patients at risk who had troponin T levels below 0. 01 microg/L (adjusted HR 7. 48 [95 % CI 1. 98 to 28. 29]; P= 0. 001). In a multivariate model that included other biochemical markers, troponin T (HR 1. 99; P= 0. 023), C-reactive protein (1. 25; P= 0. 044), vascular endothelial growth factor (HR 1. 87; P= 0. 041), soluble CD 40 ligand (HR 2. 78; P< 0. 001), and MPO (HR 2. 11; P= 0. 008) were all independent predictors of the patient's 6 -month outcome. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with ACS, MPO serum levels powerfully predict an increased risk for subsequent cardiovascular events and extend the prognostic information gained from traditional biochemical markers. Given its <b>proinflammatory</b> <b>properties,</b> MPO may serve as both a marker and mediator of vascular inflammation and further points toward the significance of PMN activation in the pathophysiology of ACS...|$|R

Although no pharmacological antagonists of pneumolysin have, to our knowledge, been described, we reasoned that agents, such as the omega- 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids doco...|$|R
40|$|Angiotensin (Ang) II mediates pathophysiologial {{changes in}} the kidney. Ang-(1 - 7) by {{interacting}} with the G protein-coupled receptor Mas may also have important biological activities. In this study, renal deficiency for Mas diminished renal damage in models of renal insufficiency as unilateral ureteral obstruction and ischemia/reperfusion injury while the infusion of Ang-(1 - 7) to wild-type mice pronounced the pathological outcome by aggravating the inflammatory response. Mas deficiency inhibited NF-kappaB activation and thus the elevation of inflammation-stimulating cytokines, while Ang-(1 - 7) infusion had <b>proinflammatory</b> <b>properties</b> in experimental models of renal failure as well as under basal conditions. The Ang-(1 - 7) -mediated NF-kappaB activation was Mas dependent but did not involve Ang II receptors. Therefore, the blockade of the NF-kappaB-activating properties of the receptor Mas could be a new strategy in the therapy of failing kidney...|$|R
40|$|Platelet-activating factor (PAF), a glycerophospholipid with <b>proinflammatory</b> <b>properties,</b> exerts its {{biological}} effects by {{interacting with}} the PAF receptor (PAFR) expressed on many different cell types. The PAFR specifically binds phosphorylcholine, the biologically active component of PAF. However, phosphorylcholine is also {{a component of the}} cell wall of nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi). In recently published in vitro experiments, the invasion of respiratory epithelial cells by NTHi was mediated by the PAFR. To determine the role of the PAFR in host defense against pneumonia induced by NTHi, PAFR-deficient (PAFR-/-) and normal wild-type mice were intranasally inoculated with NTHi. The absence of a functional PAFR was associated with a normal innate immune response as indicated by similar bacterial counts, myeloperoxidase activity, and inflammation within the pulmonary compartment of PAFR-/- and wild-type mice. These data indicate that the PAFR does not interfere with the clearance of NTHi from the respiratory trac...|$|R
40|$|Point {{mutations}} cause {{members of}} the serine protease inhibitor (serpin) superfamily to undergo a novel conformational transition, forming ordered polymers. These polymers characterize {{a group of diseases}} termed the serpinopathies. The formation of polymers underlies the retention of α 1 -antitrypsin within hepatocytes and of neuroserpin within neurons to cause cirrhosis and dementia, respectively. Point mutations of antithrombin, C 1 inhibitor, α 1 -antichymotrypsin, and heparin cofactor II cause a similar conformational transition, resulting in a plasma deficiency that is associated with thrombosis, angioedema, and emphysema. Polymers of serpins can also form in extracellular tissues where they activate inflammatory cascades. This is best described for the Z variant of α 1 -antitrypsin in which the <b>proinflammatory</b> <b>properties</b> of polymers provide an explanation for both progressive emphysema and the selective advantage of this mutant allele. Therapeutic strategies are now being developed to block the aberrant conformational transitions and so treat the serpinopathies...|$|R
40|$|Members of the caspase {{family of}} {{cysteine}} proteases coordinate the morphological and biochemical events that typify apoptosis. However, neutralization of caspase activity in mammals fails to block death {{in response to}} most proapoptotic stimuli. This is because many cell death triggers provoke mitochondrial dysfunction upstream of caspase activation {{as a consequence of}} BAX/BAK channel opening. Although genetic or phar- macological inactivation of caspases fails to block cell death in most instances, it does convert the pheno- type from apoptosis to necrosis. This has important implications for how the immune system responds to such cells, as necrotic cells provoke inflammation whereas apoptotic cells typically do not. Here, we propose an alternative perspective on apoptosis-associated caspase function by suggesting that these proteases are activated, not to kill, but to extinguish the <b>proinflammatory</b> <b>properties</b> of dying cells. This perspective unifies the mammalian caspase family as either positive or negative regulators of inflammation...|$|R
40|$|When human {{neutrophils}} were co-cultured for 72 h with nontransformed human fibroblasts, 69 +/- 3 % (n = 13) survived, {{as compared}} with survival levels of 2 +/- 1 % (n = 15) and 26 +/- 6 % (n = 7), respectively, for neutrophils cultured for {{the same time period}} in enriched medium alone or supplemented with 10 pM recombinant human granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor (rh GM-CSF). Conditioned medium from the human fibroblast cultures enhanced neutrophil survival in a dose-dependent fashion to the same level achieved with neutrophil/fibroblast co-cultures, and its soluble viability-sustaining activity was not inhibited by preincubation with neutralizing antiserum against rh GM-CSF. As compared with freshly isolated replicate samples, neutrophils co-cultured with human fibroblasts for 72 h exhibited augmented FMLP-stimulated superoxide production without spontaneous superoxide generation. This striking extension of survival and associated priming for a ligand response by neutrophils co-cultured with human fibroblasts suggests that fibroblasts may contribute to the <b>proinflammatory</b> <b>properties</b> of neutrophils in tissues...|$|R
