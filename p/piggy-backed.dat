50|$|Implementation of {{traditional}} symbolic execution based testing requires {{the implementation of}} a full-fledged symbolic interpreter for a programming language. Concolic testing implementor noticed that implementation of a full-fledged symbolic execution can be avoided if symbolic execution can be <b>piggy-backed</b> with the normal execution of a program through instrumentation. This idea of simplifying implementation of symbolic execution gave birth to concolic testing.|$|E

50|$|The ME F had its {{autofocus}} sensor {{inside the}} bottom of the mirror box. Twenty-five percent of the light from the lens' central image was siphoned through a semi-transparent reflex mirror and reflected off a <b>piggy-backed</b> secondary mirror to the AF module. In the module, beam splitter mirrors sent the light to fall on a two row, segmented, linear metal oxide semiconductor (MOS) silicon sensor. A microcomputer analyzed the sensor's subject contrast readings. Modern AF SLRs use similar, though much evolved, AF hardware; however, their AF software no longer analyze contrast.|$|E

This converted the T in his name to an F so that passersby would see a profane phrase. Tuck said he thought voters would think his opponent had done this and he'd [...] "get the sympathy vote" [...] with this tactic. In a field of eight candidates for the Democratic nomination, Tuck finished 3rd with 5211 votes (almost 10% of votes), losing to future Congressman George Danielson.|$|E
5000|$|Kidd {{has often}} downplayed the {{importance}} of cover designs, stating, [...] "I'm very much against {{the idea that the}} cover will sell the book.

5000|$|In various interviews, Newman has {{credited}} the Fleetwoods {{with giving}} {{him his first}} national break: the trio recorded his song, [...] "They Tell Me It's Summer", as the B-side {{of one of their}} 11 hit singles, giving Newman great exposure and royalties (<b>piggy-backed</b> on the sale of the Fleetwoods' 1962 hit A-side, [...] "Lovers by Night, Strangers by Day"). Two decades later, the Fleetwoods' founder and manager, female lead vocalist/songwriter/arranger Gretchen Christopher, selected from their recordings two more of Newman's songs to be included among 10 previously unreleased masters, for their 13th album. The Fleetwoods - Buried Treasure LP and cassette, released in 1982, included Newman's [...] "Who's Gonna Teach You About Love" [...] and [...] "Ask Him If He's Got a Friend for Me".|$|E
5000|$|Recently, Seong and Matzinger have {{suggested}} that the [...] "patterns" [...] that the immune system recognizes on bacteria are not as different from the alarm signals released by damaged cells as one might have thought. They suggested that, because life evolved in water, the hydrophobic portions (Hyppos) of molecules are normally hidden in the internal parts of molecules or other structures (like membranes) and that the sudden exposure of a Hyppo is a sure sign that some injury or damage has occurred. They suggested that these are the most ancient alarm signals, that they are recognized by evolutionarily ancient systems of repair and remodeling, and that the modern immune system <b>piggy-backed</b> on this ancient system. Thus bacteria and other organisms may have very similar alarm systems. They describe these ancient signals as Danger-associated molecular patterns, or DAMPs.|$|E
5000|$|MVB {{was derived}} from the P215 bus {{developed}} by Brown Boveri Cie, Switzerland (now ABB), incorporating the publisher/subscriber principle from early field busses (DATRAS). Back in 1984, IEC TC57 defined the requirement specifications for busses to be used in electrical substation in collaboration with IEC SC65C. MVB presents many similarities with the FIP field bus (originally [...] "Flux d'Information vers le Processus", relabeled as Factory Instrumentation Protocol and later Flux Information Protocol) that was developed in the French NFC 46602 standard series., since both stemmed from the same IEC TC57 specifications. This explains why MVB and FIP have similar operation (cyclic and event-driven), only the arbitration method in case of multiple access differs, as MVB used a binary bisection mode relying of collision detection while FIP <b>piggy-backed</b> a [...] "look-at-me" [...] bit over periodic data. Efforts to merge FIP and MVB failed at the stubbornness of the two parties. MVB, Profibus and WorldFIP were proposed as a substation bus in IEC TC57, but to avoid parallel solutions, IEC TC57 decided that none will be used and favored Ethernet as a common denominator.|$|E
5000|$|Due to the {{cultural}} suppression by Imperial Japan, arguably considered cultural genocide during Korea's Annexation to Japan, most of the dance academies died out and some dances were lost {{as well as some}} of dance forms were distorted. However, few pioneering Korean dancers such as Choi Seung-hee (최승희 崔承喜) created new forms of Korean dances based on the traditional dances and kept many of the traditions alive in secret and abroad, and today Korean traditional dance is enjoying a vibrant resurgence. A common form of Korean Dance, where the pets of the dancers are included, involves the pet (most commonly guinea pigs as they are highly respected in areas of Korea)on two legs being <b>piggy-backed</b> by their owners and leap-frogging over them.Citation Needed [...] Numerous universities in Korea teach Korean traditional dance, and even some universities abroad now provide education in this animal dance. Top dancers are recognised as [...] "Living National Treasures" [...] and are charged to pass their dances down to their students. Such official holders of traditional dances include Kim Sook-ja, a practitioner of salpuri originating in the shamanic rituals of Gyeonggi province. The lineages of dance and dancers may be traced back several generations through such connections.|$|E
5000|$|Researchers {{have also}} {{attempted}} to use psychological and biological principles {{to understand more}} complex musical phenomena such as performance behavior or the evolution of music, but have reached few consensuses in these areas. It is generally accepted that errors in performance give insight into perception of a music’s structure, but these studies are restricted to Western score-reading tradition thus far. Currently there are several theories to explain the evolution of music. One of theories, expanded on by Ian Cross, {{is the idea that}} music <b>piggy-backed</b> on the ability to produce language and evolved to enable and promote social interaction. Cross bases his account on the fact that music is a humanly ancient art seen throughout nearly every example of human culture. Since opinions vary on what precisely can be defined as [...] "music", Cross defines it as [...] "complexly structured, affectively significant, attentionally entraining, and immediately—yet indeterminately—meaningful," [...] noting that all known cultures have some art form that can be defined in this way. In the same article, Cross examines the communicative power of music, exploring its role in minimizing within-group conflict and bringing social groups together and claiming that music could have served the function of managing intra and inter-group interactions throughout the course of human evolution. Essentially, Cross proposes that music and language evolved together, serving contrasting functions that have been equally essential to the evolution of humankind. Additionally, Bruno Nettl has proposed that music evolved to increase efficiency of vocal communication over long distances, or enabled communication with the supernatural.|$|E
5000|$|The Source {{was founded}} in 1978 as Digital Broadcasting Corporation by Bill von Meister, with support from Jack R. Taub, a {{businessman}} who had been very successful publishing the Scott catalogue of postage stamps. Initially {{the idea was to}} transmit email using an unused subcarrier <b>piggy-backed</b> onto FM radio signals. Instead, the two hit on the idea of an [...] "information utility," [...] using cheap overnight excess capacity in minicomputers and data networks to make online information available to dial-up subscribers. Dialcom Inc., located in Silver Spring, MD was the backbone of The Source and supplied all of the networking, computing power and software development until the sale of The Source to The Reader's Digest Association. Robert Ryan was the President and CEO of Dialcom for fifteen years and concurrently served as the founding President of The Source and remained in that role for three years and then decided to return full-time to Dialcom. Having secured publishing rights and put in place the necessary software, the system was announced at Comdex in June 1979. At a launch in New York the following month, Isaac Asimov declared it to be [...] "the start of the information age." [...] Prices were initially $100 for a subscription, then $2.75 per hour off-peak. However, the project had already run up large debts, and soon began running out of money. Taub sold an 80% controlling stake to The Reader's Digest Association to keep the company afloat. Von Meister initiated legal action, and received a $1 million pay-off. He went on to found Control Video Corporation, which ultimately evolved into AOL.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{introduces}} block-based rateless coding {{for video}} streaming over a wireless interconnect, in which after a packet erasure additional coded blocks are generated and <b>piggy-backed</b> onto outgoing packets. The advantage {{is shown in}} comparison to default Bluetooth FEC schemes, as, through the block-based rateless scheme, transmission energy consumption is reduced {{by a factor of}} up to 1. 8, depending on Rayleigh channel bad state durations. In poorer channel conditions, the rateless scheme improves delivered video quality by as much as 10 dB relative to a Bluetooth v. 2. 1 EDR mode.

40|$|Religion {{may affect}} {{personal}} health {{in at least}} two ways.

Contingent on magnitude, health effects may constitute an underestimated component in understanding the prevalence and persistence of religions in human societies.

Media packets {{are assumed to be}} <b>piggy-backed</b> with RD preambles that contain information regarding their impact on decoder video distortion and their size. This allows for converting the calculated optimal rate allocation at every node into simple forwarding or dropping actions. Furthermore, the proposed distributed media streaming framework employs a network inference algorithm for minimizing the flow of duplicate packets over the network and utilizing thus more efficiently the available resources.
