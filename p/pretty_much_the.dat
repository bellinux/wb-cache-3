25|$|Until the 1950s, {{the whole}} family seated around a set {{in the living room}} was the typical way of {{listening}} to radio.

25|$|Lights can be powered through {{electromagnetic}} induction. Reelight, a Danish company, is {{well known}} for this and claims as much as one third of all bikes in Denmark feature it. The lights are mounted on the bike wheels and powered every time a magnet on the wheel spoke passes, eliminating the need for batteries. The advantages are <b>pretty</b> <b>much</b> <b>the</b> same as with dynamo lighting while incurring less resistance to the rider than traditional dynamos and eliminating the noise and wear of the tire.|$|E
25|$|Ahead {{of their}} first final against {{cross-town}} rivals the Giants, the Swans confirmed that they would play all home finals at the SCG except for Sydney Derbies, which would be played at ANZ Stadium. The final would create history, being the first Sydney Derby to be played in a final. It {{was also the first}} time that the Giants would make the finals in their fifth year. In a low-scoring first half, the Swans were very competitive, trailing by only 2 points. However, a mark not paid to Isaac Heeney midway through the third quarter turned all the momentum the Giants way, as they kicked away to win by 36 points. The Swans only kicked 2 goals after half-time with Giant Jeremy Cameron outscoring them in the third quarter alone with 3 goals. They were quick to bounce back the following week, thumping the Adelaide Crows by 6 goals, with Franklin and Tom Papley kicking 4 goals a piece, after a blistering 7 goal to 1 quarter. The story was <b>pretty</b> <b>much</b> <b>the</b> same in the preliminary final against the Geelong Cats at the MCG. The Swans kept the Cats goalless for the first quarter, and were never really challenged in their 37-point triumph. It would take them to their third grand final in 5 years, against the Western Bulldogs at the MCG. After leading by a scant 2 point margin at half time, the Bulldogs pulled away towards the end of the fourth quarter to hand Sydney their second grand final loss in three years.|$|E

500|$|The exact {{genre of}} Nightcrawler {{has been the}} subject of debate. While most critics agree that the film {{predominantly}} features thriller elements, other descriptions have been used, including dark comedy, drama, horror, and neo-noir. When asked about the film's genre, Gilroy stated: [...] "I see Nightcrawler as having genre elements in the sense that it’s a thriller. It also has some strong dramatic elements and I think I understand the question as there's some really strong elements of drama."

When he suddenly found a group of friends that would accept him for himself, as he did in Cleveland in 1964, the 'compensation' factor went out of his drawing, and this was <b>pretty</b> <b>much</b> <b>the</b> end of Fritz's impetus." ...|$|E

500|$|Harry and the Potters {{with its}} strong persona or theme {{is as much}} a {{performance}} art project as it is a rock band. Musically, they sound much like other indie rock music with the exception that the band adheres to a novel conceit: the Harry Potter books will inspire the lyrics. As Joe said in a 2005 interview, [...] "We try to take the themes from the books and amplify them." [...] Their musical sound is described as [...] "simple, catchy rock – think The White Stripes crossed with Raffi – where everyone sings along which is easy because in songs like 'Voldemort Can't Stop the Rock' the title is <b>pretty</b> <b>much</b> <b>the</b> only line." [...] Another reviewer’s ear hears [...] "a touch of the Ramones in their ultra simple lyrics." ...|$|E

Zack Handlen, writing for The A.V.

Matt Haigh, writing for Den of Geek, felt negatively about the episode, again finding it too similar to other episodes of the season, finding it to be [...] "nothing incredibly exciting", noting that it [...] "follows <b>pretty</b> <b>much</b> <b>the</b> same template {{as many of the}} other episodes".|$|E

[...] She further praised the song, writing, [...] "It's {{one of the best}} songs in her catalog, being as it is a four-minute summation of why she's one of pop's premier stylists right now; her vocals are equal parts pleading and snarling, the twitchy disco-funk beat gets hips shaking, and the declarations of confused self-love throughout can cause the listener to both root for her and realize that they've been in similar situations." [...] On The Village Voice 2010 year-end Pazz & Jop singles list, [...] "Why Don't You Love Me" [...] was ranked at number 549.|$|E
500|$|After {{completing}} the lead vocals, Swivel decided {{to rework the}} 1980s sound on the snares as they were originally very tight. He therefore added a gated reverb for the snap sound which was long and drawn‑out snap sound. He also subbed in an additional kick underneath to add some real oomph to the bottom. Owing to the work Swivel had accomplished during production, the final mix took only a few hours. He said: [...] "There {{were a lot of}} tracks, but I just enjoyed it, to be honest. I knew how I wanted it to sound, and it was <b>pretty</b> <b>much</b> <b>the</b> last song we cut; a lot of the mixing was nailed in the production as well, which helped. Dream did a great job producing this track." [...] The bar one guitar track of [...] "Schoolin' Life" [...] was entirely programmed.

500|$|To {{promote the}} game, Chunsoft {{released}} an original video animation in December 2011.

The gameplay of the Flash game has the player attempt to open a metal door by quickly clicking on it. As the door begins to open, Clover is revealed on the other side, and the player begins clicking on her breasts. Richard Eisenbeis of Kotaku was perplexed by the Flash game, stating that: [...] "as it is <b>pretty</b> <b>much</b> <b>the</b> antithesis of everything presented in Virtue's Last Reward, I truly wonder how this Flash game is supposed to convince anyone to play the full title. Perhaps it's just due to a [...] department following the old adage: 'sex sells'." ...|$|E
