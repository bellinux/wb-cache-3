40|$|Management is an {{important}} challenge for future enterprises. Previous work has addressed platform management (e. g., power and thermal management) separately from virtualization management (e. g., virtual machine (VM) provisioning, application performance). Coordinating the actions taken by these different management layers is important and beneficial, for reasons of performance, stability, and efficiency. Such coordination, in addition to working well with existing multi-vendor solutions, {{also needs to be}} extensible to support future new management solutions potentially operating on different sensors and actuators. In response to these requirements, this paper proposes vManage, a solution to loosely couple platform and virtualization management and facilitate coordination between them in data centers. Our solution is comprised of registry and proxy mechanisms that provide unified monitoring and actuation across platform and virtualization domains, and coordinators that provide policy execution for better VM placement and runtime management, including a formal approach to ensure system stability from inefficient management actions. The solution is instantiated in a Xen environment through a platform-aware virtualization manager at a cluster management node, and a virtualization-aware <b>platform</b> <b>manager</b> on each server.

30|$|The work {{routine in}} oil {{platforms}} involves conducting equipment tests which often demands inhibition of instruments and safety systems. Such processes {{are described in}} an internal document with guidelines for inhibition and control of security systems. Operators in the operational control center were expected to keep a physical copy of this document on their desks. The document states {{that it is the}} responsibility of the <b>platform</b> <b>manager</b> and operators in the local and in remote control rooms to follow the guidelines, analyze risks, register processes and suggest improvements. Furthermore, this documents states a hierarchy of responsibility in authorizing equipment inhibition according to equipment or system being controlled and the length of inhibition period. Operators in the control room played central role by gathering necessary documents to authorize inhibitions. In some moments, the communication between remote and local operators assumed a conflictual tone as offshore staff argued that the authorization process was rather time-consuming often unnecessarily delaying processes. In the same way, operators in the control center described mismatches between the “real life” of oil production and standards that they had to comply with as described in the guidelines document. On the other hand, an important dimension of integration is the physical proximity opening for the possibility of comparing how the standards are used in other platforms. The integration in the form of physical proximity among operators of different platforms provided the space for interpretation in such guidelines and in different moments, operators would discuss and compare procedures.|$|E

As a platform, RPAS carry out a wide collection of complex tasks, thanks to the interleaving of the various services of sensors. The sensors {{are in charge of}} collecting data from the environment. In this paper, we aim to design a system as a software medium layer between the <b>platform</b> <b>manager</b> and the hardware resources on board of the airborne platform (i. e. multifunction sensors).

40|$|Manufacturing {{companies}} are continuously faced with requirements regarding technology novelty, shorter time to market, {{a higher level}} of functionality, and lower prices for their products. This is especially true of suppliers that develop and manufacture highly customized products within the automotive industry. It is not uncommon that a request for a new product or subsystem goes out to several suppliers and that the one that can deliver the product most quickly and at the lowest price receives the contract. It is therefore vital for any supplier to answer to quotation requests rapidly and {{with a high level of}} precision while also ensuring that company assets are used efficiently. Other issues that apply to suppliers in the automotive industry are heavily fluctuating requirements during development projects, each customer’s individual preferences, and the ever changing interfaces with the OEM product with which the supplier’s product is to be integrated. Platform strategies have been widely accepted in industry to serve a wide product variety while maintaining business efficiency. However, the challenge of applying a platform strategy at the supplier level in the face of the reality described above has not been fully investigated. Platform approaches tend to require a focused development of the platform, which in turn requires some knowledge about which future variants are to be derived from the platform. The research presented in this thesis investigates the state of practice in industry regarding the challenges, needs, and current use of platforms. To respond to the identified need, a platform approach is proposed that expands the scope of what a product platform has traditionally contained. This is undertaken to aid in the development of highly customized products when physical modules or component scalability does not suffice. The platform approach provides a coherent environment for heterogeneous design assets to be used in product development, supporting both the activity of designing and off-the-shelf solutions. The approach is based on identifying and modelling generic product items that are associated with descriptions governing their design. By describing the outcome of technology and product development like finished designs, design guidelines, constraints, etc., in a standardized format, the platform continues to evolve. To aid in using the platform approach, a support system called Design <b>Platform</b> <b>Manager</b> is introduced at a company active as a secondtier supplier in the automotive industry. The system enables the creation of generic product items that can be structured, instantiated, and associated with descriptions, which aids in realizing product variants. The aim of the platform approach and tool is to support the quotation and continued design processes by identifying valid knowledge to use as circumstances, such as requirement changes or new design iterations, warrant.

Platform firms are firms that increase social surplus by (1) catering to distinct groups of customers such that (2) members of at least one group wish to access the other group and (3) facilitating group-access more efficiently than bi-lateral relationships between the members of the groups. Examples include markets of print media companies like newspapers and magazines (readers and advertisers), TV broadcasters (viewers and advertisers), shopping malls (shoppers and retailers), and payment cards (cardholders and merchants). The marketplace today is abundantly populated with such platform firms that operate in 'two-sided' markets. A platform firm is different from firms operating in 'one-sided' classic firm markets because their marketing strategies must take into account the fact that the benefit enjoyed by a member of one group depends upon how well the platform attracts customers from the other group. The marketing literature has largely ignored this aspect to date; hence platform firms remain an under-studied phenomenon in our field. This dissertation deals with two fundamental responsibilities of marketing managers; a) setting marketing budgets optimally and b) benchmarking the performance of individual decision making units (DMUs). In two essays, this dissertation advances knowledge with respect to optimal marketing budgeting by platform firms (Chapter 2) and benchmarking of platform DMUs (Chapter 3). The first essay (Chapter 2) makes three contributions. We note that sales-response models in the platform-firm context must capture the notion that the benefit enjoyed by a member of one group depends upon how well the platform firm attracts members from another group, i. e., the extent of cross-market effects (CMEs). CMEs are absent in 'one-sided' markets. The first contribution of the essay is a demonstration of how CMEs theoretically impact optimal investment levels and allocation ratios, extending and even reversing the extant normative budgeting rules obtained from models that ignore CMEs. The second, contribution lies in empirical demonstration of CMEs and showing how they affect the evaluation of marketing elasticity in a real-world setting. The third contribution is the development of a tool that allows a <b>platform</b> <b>manager</b> to set budgets optimally for any planning horizon by taking CMEs into account. The second essay (Chapter 3) is focused on media-based platform firms and makes two contributions. We note that productivity benchmarking involves the study of which DMU is more efficient in converting inputs into outputs. Benchmarking media-platform DMUs poses some methodological challenges by virtue of their business model. For instance, the outputs of some platform-firms are inherently networked since the outputs of some departments may serve as inputs to the other and vice versa. A survey of the literature suggests that none of the current benchmarking approaches account for all of the media-platform's benchmarking challenges simultaneously. The first contribution of this essay (Chapter 3) is to combine relatively new techniques in the operations research and statistics literatures to develop a new procedure to benchmark media-platforms that addresses the challenges. The second contribution of the essay lies in empirical demonstration/validation of the approach via an application to U. S. print newspaper firms. While doing so, the essay also demonstrates how the developed approach outperforms applications of the existing approaches. Thus, this dissertation offers insights into how to approach marketing budgeting and benchmarking decisions differently as platform-firm managers...|$|E
40|$|Avoiding {{accidents}} is important, {{especially in}} the petroleum industry where {{the outcome of a}} major accident can be serious harm to both people, the environment and to company property. There are requirements from the Petroleum Safety Authority [Norway] (PSAN), as well as from internal guidelines from operators on the Norwegian Continental Shelf, that barriers are established and maintained so that the probability of accident situations developing is reduced, and that harm and disadvantages are limited. Furthermore, it is required that the operators are aware of the condition of the safety barriers, i. e. if the barriers have been impaired or are non-functioning. As a result of the Macondo disaster, PSAN has identified the need to develop new tools for risk management. In addition, a questionnaire survey carried out for PSAN as a supervisory activity in 2009 revealed the need for the development of such tools, as it showed that the current risk analysis studies employed by the sector were not utilised ?as input to day-to-day decisions on installations/plants about minor modifications, maintenance and intervention activities? (Vinnem and Haugen, 2012, p. 4). This master's thesis explores and describes how barrier management can be directly linked to operational control of major accident risk. An extensive review of literature and several interviews are performed to examine how the <b>platform</b> <b>manager</b> can use information {{on the state of the}} safety barriers as a risk control tool. The thesis describes the premises for a new risk control tool including, but not limited to, its purpose, expectations and requirements to the tool, situations of use, how information should be communicated, a description of the type of information that goes into the risk control tool, the data sources of such information and the output it provides. Moreover, interviews with two former platform managers and an executive vice president are performed to present the most important decisions the management of the platform makes where the information on barrier condition is of importance, as well as how risk considerations come into these decisions. Furthermore, existing measures, methods and tools are presented, including a method for considering the total risk on the platform against acceptance criteria for risk. Finally, based on contact with the petroleum industry and a classification society, the thesis presents how decision-making criteria can be set for the activities that are not permitted based on, amongst other, information on the state of the safety barriers. Based on these examinations, the following suggestions are made:?	A new risk control tool should be developed with the purpose of providing decision support, including amongst other decision-making criteria and information on safety barrier condition, to situations where the management of the platform is to decide whether or not an activity can be performed. ?	A new risk control tool should be focused on bridging gaps found in the industry it is intended for. A new risk control tool should thus be focused on providing decision support on a day-to-day basis to platform manager(s), as well as to onshore management on a long-term basis, during planning of activities on the installation where the information on the state of safety barriers is of importance. ?	The tool itself should be a robust information surface with an interface built up like other tools used in the industry or by a specific company. ?	The user(s) of the tool should be presented with; area specific information on the state of the safety barriers that are directed against major accidents, relevant indicators and information that is suitable for helping the decision-maker make a decision including, but not limited to, valve status from automatic transponders, a ?map? of the platform showing relevant information, current weather and weather forecast, operational data, operating limits and preconditions used in QRA, preconditions stipulated and risk considerations performed during the onshore planning of activities, decision-making criteria and guidance, a simulation function where the user(s) can simulate the effect a specific activity brings in time and space, and a function for considering the total risk of the platform against tolerance limits for risk. ?	A new risk control tool should, as far as possible, rely on and take advantage of frequently updated and reliable information from systems already put in place by the operator. ?	Efforts should be made to be able to present detailed installation specific information of the condition of the safety barriers/-systems. ?	A classification of barrier elements according to their transient properties / behaviour could be developed for a risk control tool that is to be capable of capturing and showing the short-term transient behaviour (or state) of the safety barriers. ?	Focus should be on technical and organisational safety barriers, which show a more short-term transient behaviour than operational barriers. ?	Presented indicators should be limited to a reasonable number, fit the purpose of the risk control tool, and be recognizable for decision-makers and fitting to the installation. </p...|$|E

One of her main responsibilities {{will include the}} coordination of openUP - a collection which digitally preserves the research articles of UP staff and students in UPSpace, their institutional repository. She has been working as an information specialist {{in the field of}} Education for the past 17 years - formerly at UNISA and the Teachers College in Pretoria. Her current research interests include the role of institutional repositories in the scholarly communication process, and the open access movement. Ina Smith is the E-Application Specialist & UPSpace <b>Platform</b> <b>Manager,</b> Academic Information Service, University of Pretoria. The world-wide paradigm is to make research collections available online, thereby improving access to information and adding value to the research process. Since the facilitation of access to information (for research as well as e-research purposes) is a primary function of the Academic Information Service (library of the University of Pretoria), the library took the initiative to implement a digital research repository in order to manage, organize, preserve, distribute and offer access to research conducted by the members of the University of Pretoria’s community. The implementation of this repository is in support of the e-strategy formulated by the library management team, and strongly supports open access to digitally borne and non-digitally borne items after being digitized. The latter can, for example, also include rare sources to which access in the past had been restricted. Currently the repository of the University of Pretoria covers mainly three areas: - Historical/archival material, e. g. artifacts, photos like the Gerard Moerdyk and the Mapungubwe Collections - Scholarly material, e. g. post-prints of published articles like the OpenUP Collection - Popular material e. g. interviews, media columns like the Jonathan Jansen Collection In this paper we would like to demonstrate to you how we have utilized DSpace open source software to address the very specific needs of researchers at a South African higher education institution in the areas listed above. We shall share with you not only the lessons learnt, but also our successes during the implementation following the top-down approach. We shall discuss the problems we encountered {{and the ways in which}} we addressed and still address them. The four “champion” collections that will be demonstrated are: The Gerard Moerdyk Collection The Gerard Moerdyk [Moerdijk] Collection was established in cooperation with the personnel and students of the Department of Architecture and library staff. It includes photographs and newspaper clippings of this well-known South African architect. The Mapungubwe Collection The Mapungubwe Research Collection on UPSpace serves as a research and public information resource, essential to the interpretation and dissemination of knowledge on Mapungubwe. The extensive research collection consists of accredited research publications, unpublished material such as theses, reports and other documents, photographs, negatives, slides, maps, manuscripts, commercial publications, newspaper clippings, audio-visuals, drawings, site plans, excavation and site reports. OpenUP Collection This collection offers open access to the full text of research articles published by staff, students and affiliates of the University of Pretoria. These items are identical in content to their published counterparts. It is linked to the Research Information System and complements the Annual Research Report of the University of Pretoria The Jonathan Jansen Collection The Jonathan Jansen Collection is one of the first personalized collections on UPSpace, the institutional repository of the University of Pretoria. Its main purpose is to bring together and preserve the intellectual output of the dean of the Faculty of Education in digital format. It serves as a central archive of his publications (popular as well as research articles), radio and TV interviews, photographs and even PowerPoint presentations since 1990 to current. This paper will conclude with the plan for improved cooperation and involvement with Faculty and other groups and future deployment of UPSPace on the campus of the University of Pretoria.

We shall share with you not only the lessons learnt, but also our successes during the implementation following the top-down approach. We shall discuss the problems we encountered and the ways in which we addressed and still address them. The four “champion” collections that will be demonstrated are: The Gerard Moerdyk Collection The Gerard Moerdyk [Moerdijk] Collection was established in cooperation with the personnel and students of the Department of Architecture and library staff. It includes photographs and newspaper clippings of this well-known South African architect. The Mapungubwe Collection The Mapungubwe Research Collection on UPSpace serves as a research and public information resource, essential to the interpretation and dissemination of knowledge on Mapungubwe. The extensive research collection consists of accredited research publications, unpublished material such as theses, reports and other documents, photographs, negatives, slides, maps, manuscripts, commercial publications, newspaper clippings, audio-visuals, drawings, site plans, excavation and site reports. OpenUP Collection This collection offers open access to the full text of research articles published by staff, students and affiliates of the University of Pretoria. These items are identical in content to their published counterparts. It is linked to the Research Information System and complements the Annual Research Report of the University of Pretoria The Jonathan Jansen Collection The Jonathan Jansen Collection is one of the first personalized collections on UPSpace, the institutional repository of the University of Pretoria. Its main purpose is to bring together and preserve the intellectual output of the dean of the Faculty of Education in digital format. It serves as a central archive of his publications (popular as well as research articles), radio and TV interviews, photographs and even PowerPoint presentations since 1990 to current. This paper will conclude with the plan for improved cooperation and involvement with Faculty and other groups and future deployment of UPSPace on the campus of the University of Pretoria...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Research into {{organised}} online protest typically {{focuses on}} how digital activism empowers social movements. But what if an online community is rebelling against its platform owners? This study seeks {{to identify the}} trajectory of internally focused revolutionary activity in self-regulated online communities. Based on an analysis of three cases (Reddit, 2015; Mozilla, 2014, and Skyrim, 2015) it identifies six stages of revolution: incident, reaction, mobilization, action, negotiation, {{and a return to}} ‘normality’ with a new power equilibrium. For each stage, key events, relations between the community and <b>platform</b> <b>managers,</b> {{and the ways in which}} power is enacted through online means, are identified. This preliminary model for online community revolution offers potential for further work that has diagnostic, predictive and ameliorative value. Relations with online communities are of significant value in an era in which many platform-related business models are reliant on voluntary contributions of selfregulating online communities...|$|R
