2500|$|After {{receiving}} his doctorate, Wolman {{worked as}} a special agent for the Commission on Industrial Relations, a U.S. federal government commission which investigated industrial working conditions in the United States from 1912 to 1915. Returning to academia after the Commission ended its work, he taught at Hobart College, Johns Hopkins University, and the University of Michigan. After the United States entered World War I in 1917, he served on the Council of National Defense (a U.S. federal government agency which advised the President on economic production issues) and later was appointed head of the section on <b>production</b> <b>statistics</b> of the War Industries Board. [...] In 1919, he served six months with the American Peace Mission which negotiated the Treaty of Versailles.|$|E
2500|$|With {{dramatically}} reduced yields, even {{urban areas}} suffered much reduced rations; however, mass starvation was largely {{confined to the}} countryside, where, {{as a result of}} drastically inflated <b>production</b> <b>statistics,</b> very little grain was left for the peasants to eat. Food shortages were bad throughout the country; however, the provinces which had adopted Mao's reforms with the most vigor, such as Anhui, Gansu and Henan, tended to suffer disproportionately. Sichuan, one of China's most populous provinces, known in China as [...] "Heaven's Granary" [...] because of its fertility, is thought to have suffered the greatest absolute numbers of deaths from starvation due to the vigor with which provincial leader Li Jinquan undertook Mao's reforms. During the Great Leap Forward, cases of cannibalism also occurred in the parts of China that were severely affected by famine.|$|E
2500|$|... "Material {{relating}} to the economic life of the rural population was meagre," [...] asserts , [...] "and reliable information {{relating to}} the famine was simply not available." [...] As early as October 1942, crop forecasts {{for the coming year}} predicted a significant shortfall. Traders began to warn of an impending famine, but the Bengal Government did not act on those predictions, apparently doubting their credibility. There were several reasons for this. First, administrators and statisticians had known for decades that India's agricultural <b>production</b> <b>statistics</b> were unreliable and incomplete and [...] "not merely guesses, but frequently demonstrably absurd guesses". The official statistics were riddled with [...] "elements of negligence and incompetence, of subjectivity and conservatism, of corruption and absurdity ... indifference and genuine perplexity [...] ". Second, there was little or no internal bureaucracy for creating and maintaining such reports, and the low-ranking police officers or village officials charged with gathering local statistics were often poorly supplied with maps and other necessary information, poorly educated, and poorly motivated to be accurate. Moreover, the already haphazard rural administration went through an increasing process of collapse through 1941 and 1942; many of these local officials went unpaid for long periods of time. Third, these forecasts had predicted a shortfall several times in previous years, but no significant problems had occurred. Finally, given the general poverty of the area, there were many other pressing needs that demanded greater attention than the collection of statistics.|$|E
