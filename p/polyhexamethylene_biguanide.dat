A retrospective analysis of wound cleanser clinical efficacy and cost-effectiveness focussed on <b>Polyhexamethylene</b> <b>biguanide</b> solution, Ringer’s solution or saline in 112 venous leg ulcer patients. The study group received the <b>Polyhexamethylene</b> <b>biguanide</b> solution (n=59) and the control group received either Ringer’s solution or saline (n=53). In both arms, ulcer healing patterns were evaluated. Within the first 3 months of treatment, a shorter time to healing was recorded in the study group when compared with the control group - 60% v. 28% with corresponding mean time to healing being 3.31 months (study group) compared to 4.42 months (control group) p= <0.0001. More patients in the <b>Polyhexamethylene</b> <b>biguanide</b> group healed in the 6-month period when compared with the controls - 97% v. 89%. The authors concluded that optimization of the local wound environment was significantly influenced through cleansing with polyhexanide solution.|$|E
40|$|AIMS: This study {{reports the}} {{activity}} of two biguanides against MS 2 bacteriophage used as a surrogate virus for nonenveloped mammalian viruses and provides an explanation as to their apparent limited efficacy. METHODS AND RESULTS: When tested in a standard suspension test, two <b>polyhexamethylene</b> <b>biguanides</b> (PHMB), VANTOCIL TG and COSMOCIL CQ, reduced the viability of MS 2 by only 1 - 2 log(10) PFU ml(- 1). Exposure time up to 30 min did not affect {{the activity of}} the biguanides, although both PHMB were shown to strongly interact with MS 2 proteins. CONCLUSIONS: Inactivation kinetics and change in virus hydrophobicity suggested that PHMB induces the formation of viral aggregates. This hypothesis was supported using dynamic light scattering that showed an increase in viral aggregates sizes (up to 500 nm) in a concentration-dependent manner. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: It has been reported that viral aggregation is responsible for virus survival to the biocide exposure. Here, this might be the case, because the virucidal activity of the biguanides was modest and viral aggregation important. The formation of viral aggregates during virus exposure to PHMB was unlikely to overestimate the virucidal potential of the biguanides...|$|R
40|$|New {{advances}} {{have been released}} in textile industry. Contributions {{at the level of}} textile fiber chains engineering has allowed modification of their structure, production of smart polymers responding to changes in environment, and attachment or entrapment of cells and bioactive molecules. Likewise, our society high demand of hygienic patterns, has raised the intensive research and development of antimicrobial textiles. Applications are being extended to underwear, sportswear, home furnishing, protective clothes, wound-dressings and in areas with high risk of microbial infection, as hospitals, schools and hotels. Throughout last decades hospitals have faced tough challenges concerning microbial multi-resistance, especially in immunodepressed patients. The strongest cause for microbial resistance {{may be due to the}} abuse of antibiotics uptake, either by humans to treat something non appropriately, as by animals, to earn weight. The development of antimicrobial textiles arise as a promising solution that may significantly decrease the risk of nosocomial infections. Several antimicrobial agents have been applied in textiles, namely quaternary ammonium compounds, silver, <b>polyhexamethylene</b> <b>biguanides</b> and triclosan. However, they have shown a reduced spectrum of microbial inhibition which cause resistances, cytotoxicity causing skin irritation, as well as toxic to the environment. Furthermore, these compounds gradually lose their bioactivity with use and launderings. L-cysteine (L-Cys) that is found in several living organisms is a natural defensive thiolated aminoacid never studied before as a potential antimicrobial agent for textiles, which can grant antibacterial properties without cytotoxicity. Furthermore, antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) belong to innate immune system of multicellular organisms and appear as an alternative to antibiotics. They are small, amphipathic, and strongly cationic which bind to negatively charged phospholipid headgroups of microbial membranes. Although the mechanism of AMPs-microbial killing is still not known, many hypotheses have been proposed: (i) membrane depolarization, (ii) formation of physical holes at the membrane, (iii) programmed bacterial death processes, (iv) phospholipidic redistribution, and (v) internalization of the AMP. They have broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity. Once their target is the bacterial membrane microorganisms hardly develop resistance, otherwise they would have to change all their lipidic composition and/or organization, which is high demanding and not energetically worth it. During this work, non-covalently adsorbed L-Cys to wool (patent PAT 104540 A) and to cotton showed to be non-toxic to human cells, and had antimicrobial effects against Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria and its main mechanism of action on cotton was assessed by flow citometry. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) will also be immobilized on textiles, in order to find if textile imobilized-AMP can attract and kill bacteria. Natural polymers have shown few adverse reactions, once they have excellent humidity control, biocompatibility and low-allergic responses, due to their similarity to macromolecules which biological environment is prepared to recognize and to deal with metabolically. AMPs will be selected, based on their 3 D structure, terminal charge and size. Best-studied AMPs are cationic due to their action on negative surface charged microorganisms. Evaluation of minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of AMPs will elucidate the amount of AMPs to be used to functionalize textile substrates and cytotoxicity studies will provide the toxicity of functionalized textiles to human cells. In order to develop long-lasting and washable functionalized textiles we propose the covalent binding of AMPs on textiles through selected chemistries already employed on surface modifying of medical devices elsewhere. Alternatively, we will use plasma treatment, which is usually used to modify many surface properties of polymeric materials. This study may allow the development of innovative antimicrobial textiles, simulating microbial-free microenvironments in order to develop, in the future, antimicrobial fabrics to avoid airborne spreading and improve patient’s quality of life in a hospital context...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE. To assess dose- and concentration-dependent {{rates of}} biguanides on the {{viability}} of Acanthamoeba cysts isolated from severe ulcerative keratitis, and to correlate cysticidal activites with cytotoxic profiles in corneal and endothelial cells. METHODS. Cysticidal activities of <b>polyhexamethylene</b> <b>biguanide</b> and chlorhexidine digluconate were evaluated in the Acanthamoeba castellanii strain and clinical isolates of Acanthamoeba spp obtained from two severe and recurrent cases of ulcerative keratitis. the molecular characterization of protozoa used in the experimental assays was performed by sequencing reactions of the 18 S rDNA gene. Acanthamoeba cysts were exposed at different dosages and concentrations of both biguanides; the application of double-biguanides was also evaluated. Automated cell viability assessment of cysts was performed using the trypan blue dye exclusion method. Cytotoxicity assays of biguanides were conducted using primary cultures of endothelial cells alone or in coculture with Acanthamoeba cysts. Human corneal epithelial cells were used as a comparative pattern to assess the toxicity of biguanide compounds. Cell viability was measured using both quantitative and qualitative methods. Statistical analyses were applied to the data. RESULTS. the in vitro study showed that all dosages, concentrations, and combinations of biguanides tested had a cysticidal effect on Acanthamoeba spp strains tested compared with control cultures not exposed to any antimicrobials; the difference in response was statistically significant. the use of both biguanides in combination demonstrated the best cysticidal effect. the use of isolated biguanides was associated with greater cytotoxic effects than with biguanides used in combination. Chlorhexidine digluconate used alone tended to have greater cytotoxicity than <b>polyhexamethylene</b> <b>biguanide.</b> Furthermore, the double-biguanide application had a statistically significant decrease in the deleterious effect on endothelial cells at higher dosage and concentration. Quantitative and qualitative analyses demonstrated the toxic effect of biguanide compounds on {{the viability of}} corneal epithelial cells, under single or in combination usage. CONCLUSIONS. We demonstrated that the combined use of biguanides had greater cysticidal activity than individual drug application {{as well as a}} possible protective effect on endothelial cells. the biguanide compounds tested were able to induce corneal epithelial cell death in time and concentration-independent fashions. Findings support the hypothesis concerning the cysticidal effect and the differential patterns of toxicity expressed by <b>polyhexamethylene</b> <b>biguanide</b> and chlorhexidine digluconate on the endothelial and corneal cells.
