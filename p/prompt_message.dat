The relationships between students ’ food waste behavior, sustainability beliefs, and demographics were evaluated {{with the use}} of a self-administered survey and continual food waste monitoring. This study also assessed whether simple prompt-type message interventions had an impact or if the addition of more personally relevant feedback-based data elicited a greater change in consumer beliefs and behaviors On average, more than 57 grams of edible food was left on each tray. Food waste behaviors were not influenced by demographic factors. Individuals with higher levels of food waste beliefs also disposed of less edible food items. The simple prompt-type messages stimulated a 15 % reduction in food waste.

40|$|To {{create a}} cost {{effective}} environment during {{the management of}} building facilities, energy conservation is important among building users as it can help to conserve energy and reduce energy cost. To promote energy conservation, the behavior of user should be focused where their behavior should be improved to reduce energy wastage. Prompt is among the simplest and inexpensive behavioural interventions to improve energy conservation behavior. The prompt has been used wisely in healthcare sectors to promote healthy lifestyles, but no recent study on energy conservation behavior. The aim {{of this research was}} to investigate the effectiveness of prompt in prompting energy conservation behavior among the building users in university. An experiment was designed and carried out to examine the effectiveness of local and global types prompt messages for prompting efficiency use of energy. This research findings show that {{there was no significant difference}} between local and global types prompt messages, however, the findings indicate that both prompt messages were able to prompt the behavior change among the energy users and local type <b>prompt</b> <b>message</b> was more able to prompt the users than global types prompt messages.

Focus groups of students were used with a written survey to gain insight into their perceptions of tray free dining. Benefits included: decreased waste, reduced chemical, resource, and food costs, and improved student satisfaction. Managers identified complaints and dining room cleanliness as negative outcomes. Student involvement, education, and communication were strongly recommended by both managers and students. This research supports the recommendation to consider the implementation of tray free dining at Van Zile.

30|$|The {{population}} of the elderly is growing at a phenomenal rate. In view of cognitive decline, especially, memory, hearing, and visual impairment for the elderly, the Smart Home (SH) {{has emerged as a}} potential approach to assisting old people with lots of intelligent services which make it possible for them to live independently [1]. With the vision of ubiquitous computing becoming reality, people will soon live in environments surrounded by networked computers and mobile devices [2]. Many intelligent services are deployed in those devices. However, those devices differ from each other significantly in terms of computational capabilities, network protocols, and available intelligent services. Furthermore, lots of handheld devices such as smart phones and Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs) serve as terminals. The dynamics and the mobility of those devices have significant effects on the access of built-in services. For example, when the host is ready to go to work with a smart phone, a service is triggered which aims to remind the host to purchase milk and fruit on the way home. This scenario raises the following issues: (1) Where to present the <b>prompt</b> <b>message.</b> As there is no knowledge about what kinds of devices are available in the current situation. (2) Even though the available devices are known, in the aforementioned scenario it's the smart phone, how to access the built-in services in a given device is implicit. The mechanism to match task requirements (TR) and service capabilities is necessitated. (3) Due to the constraints of devices and user preferences, a reasonable way to show the information is crucial. To enhance the user satisfaction, content adaptation is introduced. Thus, in order to overcome all those problems and manage intelligent services in SHs, a context-aware service scheduling framework (CASSF) is required. The CASSF discovers accessible devices, provides semantic service selection to match TRs against service capabilities and allocates suitable services according to current contexts and user preferences.|$|E

The simulator allows students to study the normal steady state behaviour of a power system (load-flow analysis) and also the transient stability of the system due to the different possible disturbances (dynamic analysis). In the system dynamics, a general and comprehensive form of multi-node system dynamic analysis is developed and on which an extensive simulation facility has been based. A major part of the author's work has been {{in the development of a}} powerful input/output interface to the dynamic and load-flow analysis packages, allowing the user to interact with the program using a graphic display terminal.

40|$|A {{control model}} is {{one or more}} {{functional}} relationships to tie student’s measureable parameters and test tasks to {{the assessment of the}} outcomes achieved. The control models are used to measure the level of academic achievements. The article surveys the academic achievement control models used in e-learning systems. It discusses a G. Rasch technique, which allows tracking the academic progress within the scope of the Item Response Theory. In traditional interpretation the G. Rasch model links the level of academic achievements and the level of the test task difficulties to the probability of their correct execution. This approach has been modified. A modified approach, firstly, takes into account the behavioral factors in measuring the level of achievements; secondly, it enables to include nonmonotonic variables in a mathematical G. Rasch model. Behavioral factors are thought of as acts committed by students when working in the e-learning system, for example, access to <b>prompt</b> <b>messages</b> (or tooltips), preview of browsing fragments of the learning content, skip of test tasks, etc. The article introduces quantitative metrics of these factors based on the fuzzy sets. Experiments are conducted to confirm a non-monotonic nature of the impact some behavioral factors have on the level of academic achievements. The results presented in the article are of practical application to measuring the level of academic achievements during e-learning process.

40|$|A {{computer}} program, run on {{a hand-held}} printing pocket computer, that simplifies routine calorie and fluid calculations on high-risk neonates {{in the intensive care}} nursery is described. It is useful in performing these calculations on patients with parenteral nutrition, diluted feedings, other intravenous fluids, and medium-chain triglyceride oil supplements, all of which make calorie and fluid calculations by hand very difficult. Both physician and nonphysician personnel can be taught to use this program, allowing them to quickly and easily perform the otherwise laborious fluid and calorie calculations, even on complicated patients. FLUID AND CALORIE calculations are part of the morning routine of each newbon infant in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). These calculations can be complex and time consuming in infants on parenteral nutrition, medium-chain triglyceride (MCT) oil, and/ or multiple intravenous (IV) solutions. l. 2 These cal-culations, done in a standard and repetitive fashion, are well suited for a computer. This article describes a simple program {{run on a}} pocket hand-held computer that provides a printout of the patient’s fluid, calorie, parenteral nutrition, and urine output (UOP) calcu-lations. Materials-Hardware Description This program was written for the Casio model FX- 802 P hand-held printing pocket computer.

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} Juntos y Saludables (Get Healthy Together), a multi-component obesity prevention pilot tailored for Mexican American Head Start children (ages 3 - 5). For the parent education component, researchers trained seven peer parent educators to deliver health information via afterschool parent education sessions. When parents attended the sessions, they received a take-home bag with a book and family activity to promote physical activity in the home. Method: Parent intercept interviews, focus groups, and questionnaires were collected (average 80 % participation rate). Results: Average participation rate at the parent education sessions was 46 % and rates varied between 34 % (61 parents) and 53 % (94 parents). More parents in the intervention school reported that their child ate fruit at least 3 times (83. 5 % versus 79. 17 %), ate in front of the television less than three times (70. 87 % versus 49. 38 %) during the typical week and more parents reported that their child watched 2 hours or less of television each day (73. 79 % versus 13. 19 %), compared to the comparison school. 81 % of parents interviewed correctly identified the program name.
