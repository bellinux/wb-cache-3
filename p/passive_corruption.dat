60|$|After we {{had brought}} forward this cause, (the {{greatest}} in extent that ever was tried before any human tribunal, {{to say nothing}} of the magnitude of its consequences,) we soon found, whatever the reasons might be, without at present blaming the prisoner, without blaming your Lordships, and far are we from imputing blame to ourselves, we soon found that this trial was likely to be protracted to an unusual length. The Managers of the Commons, feeling this, went up to their constituents to procure from them the means of reducing it within a compass fitter for their management and for your Lordships' judgment. Being furnished with this power, a second selection was made upon the principles of the first: not upon the idea that what we left could be less clearly sustained, but because we thought a selection should be made upon some juridical principle. With this impression on our minds, we reduced the whole cause to four great heads of guilt and criminality. Two of them, namely, Benares and the Begums, show the effects of his open violence and injustice; the other two expose the principles of pecuniary corruption upon which the prisoner proceeded: one of these displays his <b>passive</b> <b>corruption</b> in receiving bribes, and the other his active corruption, in which he has endeavored to defend his <b>passive</b> <b>corruption</b> by forming a most formidable faction both abroad and at home. There is hardly any one act of the prisoner's corruption in which there is not presumptive violence, nor any acts of his violence in which there are not presumptive proofs of corruption. These practices are so intimately blended with each other, that we thought the distribution which we have adopted would best bring before you the spirit and genius of his government; and we were convinced, that, if upon these four great heads of charge your Lordships should not find him guilty, nothing could be added to them which would persuade you so to do.|$|E

30|$|The CCP’s anti-corruption lexicon is a {{combination}} of bodily and cultural metaphors. The four metaphor categories that emerged from the Chinese data, subsumed under the general domain of HARM, represent basic human experiences central to adaption and survival. Specifically, DISEASE focuses on the somatic and medical aspects, VERMIN and WEED on the environmental and ecological, and SLOVENRY on the behavioral. At the same time, reference to cultural models of conceptualizing shared human experience and to the historical aspect of intertextuality as culturally inherited narrative is crucial to a full understanding of the specific metaphoric imageries mapped onto corruption and anti-corruption actions. Two of the source domains—DISEASE and VERMIN—stand out with FOUR WINDS and TIGER as the most entrenched metaphor tokens. The metaphorical entailments of the FOUR WINDS metaphor serve to construct an etiology of corruption in a way that emphasizes the existential danger posed by corruption, obviates the need for, and potentially distracts from, a rational examination of the political, economic, and institutional circumstances conducive to corruption, and encourages compassion for the institutional entity construed as the <b>passive</b> victim of <b>corruption.</b> The entailments of the TIGER metaphor based on the blending of the power domain and the heroism domain profile the anti-corruption campaign as an extraordinary undertaking of heroism against harmful and destructive forces.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Secure {{function}} evaluation (SFE) {{allows a}} set of players to compute an arbitrary agreed function of their private inputs, even if an adversary may corrupt some of the players. Secure multi-party computation (MPC) is a generalization allowing to perform an arbitrary on-going (also called reactive or stateful) computation during which players can receive outputs and provide new inputs at intermediate stages. At Crypto 2006, Ishai et al. considered mixed threshold adversaries that either passively corrupt some fixed number of players, or, alternatively, actively corrupt some (smaller) fixed number of players, and showed that for certain thresholds, cryptographic SFE is possible, whereas cryptographic MPC is not. However, this separation does not occur when one considers perfect security. Actually, past work suggests that no such separation exists, as all known general protocols for perfectly secure SFE {{can also be used}} for MPC. Also, such a separation does not show up with general adversaries, characterized by a collection of corruptible subsets of the players, when considering <b>passive</b> and active <b>corruption.</b> In this paper, we study the most general corruption model where the adversary is characterized by a collection of adversary classes, each specifying the subset of players that can be actively, passively, or fail-corrupted, respectively, and show that in this model, perfectly secure MPC separates from perfectly secure SFE. Furthermore, we derive the exact conditions on the adversary structure for the existence of perfectly secure SFE resp. MPC, and provide efficient protocols for both cases. ...|$|R
50|$|Corruption {{can occur}} in any sector, whether they be public or private {{industry}} or even NGOs(espesially in public sector). However, only in democratically controlled institutions is there an interest of the public (owner) to develop internal mechanisms to fight active or <b>passive</b> <b>corruption,</b> whereas in private industry {{as well as in}} NGOs there is no public control. Therefore, the owners' investors' or sponsors' profits are largely decisive.|$|E

5000|$|Rodrigo Maia's name {{appears in}} Operation Car Wash. According {{to an article}} in Brazilian weekly {{magazine}} Epoca, he exchanged text messages with contractor Léo Pinheiro, from Grupo OAS, regarding electoral donations. On February 8, 2017, in a news report by Jornal Nacional, the Federal Polic finalized its investigations and concluded that {{there were signs of}} <b>passive</b> <b>corruption</b> and money laundering. This investigation began with the text message exchange between Leo Pinheiro and Maia himself. He is accused of providing [...] "political favors" [...] and defending OAS interests in Congress in 2013 and 2014. According to the Federal Police, Maia helped OAS by introducing an amendment to the provisional measure that created rules for regional aviation. Investigators believe that Maia asked the contractor for $1 million reais in electoral donations in 2014 (this money was officially given to Cesar Maia, Rodrigo Maia's father, campaign) and that this transfer was an attempt to hide the real origin of the money. Maia has denied any involvement. Given Maia's privileged forum as a congressman, the decision to open investigations against him will be the responsibility of the Federal Public Prosecutor's office.|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} problem of unconditionally {{reliable}} message transmission (URMT), where two nonfaulty players, the sender S and the receiver R {{are part of a}} synchronous network modeled as a directed hypergraph, a part of which may be under the influence of an adversary having unbounded computing power. S intends to transmit a message m to R, such that R should correctly obtain S’s message with probability at least (1 − δ) for arbitrarily small δ> 0. However, unlike most of the literature on this problem, we assume the adversary modeling the faults is threshold mixed, and can corrupt different set of nodes in Byzantine, passive and fail-stop fashion simultaneously. The main contribution of this work is the complete characterization of URMT in directed hypergraph tolerating such an adversary. Working out a direct characterization of URMT over directed hypergraphs tolerating threshold mixed adversary is highly un-intuitive. So we first propose a novel technique, which takes as input a directed hypergraph and a threshold mixed adversary on that hypergraph and outputs a corresponding digraph, along with a non-threshold mixed adversary, such that URMT over the hypergraph tolerating the threshold mixed adversary is possible iff a special type of URMT is possible over the obtained digraph, tolerating the corresponding non-threshold mixed adversary. We then characterize URMT in arbitrary digraphs tolerating non-threshold mixed adversary and modify it to obtain the characterization for special type of URMT over digraphs tolerating non-threshold mixed adversary. This completes the characterization of URMT over the original hypergraph. Surprisingly, our results indicate that even <b>passive</b> <b>corruption,</b> in collusion with active faults, substantially affects the reliability of URMT protocols! This is interesting because it is a general belief that <b>passive</b> <b>corruption</b> (eavesdropping) does not affect reliable communication...|$|E
40|$|Corruption in {{business}} occurs {{in situations of}} {{a quid pro quo}} relationship between public officials and business managers representing corporations. Many a time, such corrupt situations can harm stakeholder interests. Managers, as decision-makers, in corruption-related situations may fail to understand the impact of their decisions in such situation for they operate from a position of "position-dependent objectivity" (Sen, 2002) focusing on economic objectives usually. They may fail to understand that their involvement in corrupt acts can lead to violation of fundamental stakeholder issues such as human rights as in the cases of Shell and Enron (discussed in this thesis). The thesis examines the meaning of corruption in relation to its stakeholder impact and proposes that corporate good governance in corruption-related situations is a matter of ethical decision-making, exceeding legal compliance. It explores the decision-making factors that operate within an individual manager while dealing with corruption-related situations {{in business}} and maps an analytical mental model of a decision-making manager in such situations. The thesis proposes 'Corruption-related Decision-making' (CRDM) as an orderly way of thinking for managers to deal with corruption-related situations in business. The CRDM concept is demonstrated {{through the use of a}} new Corruption-related Decision-making model that protects human rights, environmental issues, sustainable development and any other relevant stakeholder issue that one may wish to include. The relevance of the CRDM concept and the model was evaluated in a survey of forty-one multinational companies from Mumbai, India. The survey confirmed that none of the respondents used any decision-making tools while dealing with corruption-related situations. The survey revealed that 40 out of 41 companies experienced rent-seeking behaviour (bribes demanded) in India. Out of these 41 companies, 26 companies 'usually' lost business due to non-compliance with bribe demands and another 9 companies lost business 'sometimes. ' The survey also explored the role of 'fear of loss of business' in the decision-making process and found that 'fear of loss of business' led decision-makers change stance from a state of <b>passive</b> <b>corruption</b> (facing demand) to a position of active corruption (making an offer), with 27 companies actually moving from a position of <b>passive</b> <b>corruption</b> to active corruption. All 41 companies, without a single exception, believed (when asked) that corruption can adversely affect stakeholder issues such as human rights. The survey findings confirm the relevance of the CRDM model as a decision-making tool and as a good practice document in corruption-related situations. The CRDM model can motivate an internal review of a manager's persona with a reminder that ethical decision-making and protection of stakeholder rights is possible in corruption-related situations. The concept of CRDM is a potential contribution in dealing with the illegitimate, the illegal and the oppressive aspects of international business...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The goal of Multi-Party Computation (MPC) is {{to perform}} an {{arbitrary}} computation in a distributed, private, and fault-tolerant way. For this purpose, a fixed set of n parties runs a protocol that tolerates an adversary corrupting {{a subset of the}} parties, preserving certain security guarantees like correctness, secrecy, robustness, and fairness. Corruptions can be either passive or active: A passively corrupted party follows the protocol correctly, but the adversary learns the entire internal state of this party. An actively corrupted party is completely controlled by the adversary, and may deviate arbitrarily from the protocol. A mixed adversary may at the same time corrupt some parties actively and some additional parties passively. In this work, we consider the statistical setting with mixed adversaries and study the exact consequences of active and passive corruptions on secrecy, correctness, robustness, and fairness separately (i. e., hybrid security). Clearly, the number of passive corruptions affects the thresholds for secrecy, while the number of active corruptions affects all thresholds. It turns out that in the statistical setting, the number of passive corruptions in particular also affects the threshold for correctness, i. e., in all protocols there are (tolerated) adversaries for which a single additional <b>passive</b> <b>corruption</b> is sufficient to break correctness. This is in contrast to both the perfect and the computational setting, where such an influence cannot be observed. Apparently, this effect arises from the use of information-theoretic signatures, which are part of most (if not all) statistical protocols...|$|E
40|$|Young {{women and}} {{children}} moved into the local sex industries dominate human trafficking in the borderlands of Burma, Cambodia and Thailand. Some are trafficked beyond to the sex industry in Bangkok, Phnom Penh, Rangoon and even Sydney. The {{great majority of the}} trafficking takes place within the Greater Mekong Subregion to service the needs of locals. Groups supposed to protect vulnerable groups, such as the police and military, facilitate trafficking in the borderlands. This dissertation provides an analysis of the degree of involvement by these groups in the trafficking process and examines issues of active and <b>passive</b> <b>corruption</b> associated with the trade in people. The dissertation also considers the role of cross-border criminal groups who, in effect, operate transnationally. However, they are only considered within a domestic framework. This trafficking sociology has placed limitations on the ability of the international community to combat the trade. The borderlands environment makes it problematic to combat trafficking. Some groups operating in the borderlands have built substantial wealth upon the smuggling and trafficking of goods, including people. Central control is also weaker with provincial authorities and military officials operating fiefdoms in lucrative border provinces. The complex interplay of patronage networks, illicit border industries and accelerating economic development in border provinces has created a climate well suited to the trafficking of people into the local sex industries. As a way to understand this problem, the dissertation proposes the widening of the definition and understanding of transnational organised crime groups to include low order and high order transnational crime groups differentiating between high order groups such as the Russian Mafiya, and low order groups such as Cambodian crossborder criminals trading Vietnamese women in Thailand. This dissertation examines the groups operating in the borderlands, the dynamics behind the trade, and the regional influences facilitating the growth of this illicit trade...|$|E
