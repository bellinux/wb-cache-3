40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the extent superintendents in Colorado, Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, South Dakota, and Wyoming relied on (a) <b>prior</b> <b>administrative</b> experiences, (b) network of colleagues, (c) professional and governmental organizations, (d) academic preparation, and (e) research to effectively complete key job responsibilities. For this study, the key job responsibilities were the eight standards identified by the American Association of School Administrators Commission on Standards for the Superintendency, chaired by John Hoyle, completed in 1993. The eight standards identified were: leadership and district culture, policy and governance, communications and community relations, organizational management, curriculum planning and development, instructional management, human resources management, and values and ethics of leadership. A total of 207 superintendents with at least three but not more than five years of experience were included in the study. ^ The findings associated with the research questions revealed that superintendents relied on <b>prior</b> <b>administrative</b> experiences significantly more than any of the other four variables to complete each key job responsibility. When all eight key job responsibilities were considered as a whole, <b>prior</b> <b>administrative</b> experiences were relied on significantly more than any other variable. Network of colleagues were relied on significantly more than professional and governmental organizations, research, and academic preparation. Research and academic preparation were relied on equally, but less so than any of the other variables. ...|$|R

40|$|How do Cambodian villagers {{perceive}} sustainability {{and what}} do they do ‘on the ground’? Looking at sustainability issues through the lens of two local resource management com-mittees, and using a triangulation of social science research methods, this paper examines the roles and responsibilities of these groups and how they grapple with resource degrada-tion and related activities. The committees have experimented with a range of resource management strategies, from creating fishing sanctuaries to resolving fishing gear theft. The results indicate that one reason villagers are willing to engage in community-based management is when they believe that they can improve livelihoods within their commu-nity. Community-based management is being carried out in the absence of formal legisla-tion; it is recognized through government policy and <b>administrative</b> <b>approvals.</b> In this regard, local-level support and leadership has been key, and the current arrangement has created the political space for experimentation and learning...|$|R
