5|$|Burton v. United States is {{the name}} of two appeals to the Supreme Court of the United States by Senator Joseph R. Burton (R-KS) {{following}} his conviction for compensated representation of a <b>party</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> proceeding in which the United States was interested: Burton v. United States, 196 U.S. 283 (1905) and Burton v. United States, 202 U.S. 344 (1906). Burton was convicted of acting as counsel to Rialto Grain and Securities Company in the United States Postmaster General's investigation of Rialto for mail fraud.|$|E
5|$|Each <b>party</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> coevolutionary {{relationship}} exerts selective {{pressures on}} the other, thereby affecting each other's evolution. Coevolution includes many forms of mutualism, host-parasite, and predator-prey relationships between species, as well as competition within or between species. In many cases, the selective pressures drive an evolutionary arms race between the species involved. Pairwise or specific coevolution, between exactly two species, {{is not the only}} possibility; in guild or diffuse coevolution, several species may evolve a trait in reciprocity with a trait in another species, as has happened between the flowering plants and pollinating insects such as bees, flies, and beetles.|$|E

5|$|Vizzini’s {{support for}} the DC was not a secret. During the crucial 1948 {{elections}} that would decide on Italy’s post-war future, Vizzini and Genco Russo sat {{at the same table}} with leading DC politicians, attending an electoral lunch. In the course of the start of the Cold War, the 1948 elections were a triumph for the Christian Democrats, who would govern Italy with up and downs for the next 45 years in different coalitions. One of its main aims was to keep the Italian Communist Party – the biggest communist <b>party</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> NATO member state – away from power.|$|E
5|$|After initial {{rises in}} opinion polls {{following}} Brown becoming Prime Minister, Labour's popularity declined {{with the onset}} of a recession in 2008, leading to poor results in the local and European elections in 2009. A year later, Labour lost 91 seats in the House of Commons at the 2010 general election, the party's biggest loss of seats in a single general election since 1931, making the Conservatives the largest <b>party</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> hung parliament. Brown remained in office as Labour negotiated to form a coalition government with the Liberal Democrats. On 10 May 2010, Brown announced he would stand down as leader of the Labour Party, and instructed the party to put into motion the processes to elect a new leader. Labour's attempts to retain power failed and on 11 May, he officially resigned as Prime Minister and Leader of the Labour Party. He was succeeded as Prime Minister by David Cameron, and as Leader of the Labour Party by Ed Miliband.|$|E
5|$|After {{she turned}} 15, Falle {{had her first}} {{experience}} in the sex industry at a <b>party</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> bar in Chinatown, Calgary. A 25-year-old man at the party who had forged identity documents convinced her to sell sex for money and give him half of her earnings. Falle found this man well-dressed and attractive and {{did not think that}} he fit the stereotypical image of a pimp. She had nowhere to sleep that night and had no money for food, so she accepted his offer. The man to whom she sold sex that night had teeth that were rotten. They had sex on a soiled mattress in a poorly-ventilated restaurant attic, and she received $100.|$|E

5|$|Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) {{attempts}} to make everyone's Christmas wishes come true. At a conference meeting, he vows to keep his promise to make wishes and asks the office members to also be nice to his new girlfriend Jessica (Eleanor Seigler). An emotionally confused Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) tries {{to be nice to}} Jessica, but ends up drinking too much at the <b>party.</b> <b>In</b> <b>a</b> drunken stupor, she tells Andy that her Christmas wish is for Jessica to die. Offended, he tells her to get over their breakup before storming off. Kelly Kapoor (Mindy Kaling) does her part as a friend of Erin's by being mean to Jessica. Andy becomes concerned about Erin's behavior, not least because Robert California (James Spader) has revealed that his marriage is ending, spends {{a good deal of the}} party hanging out with Erin and pressures her into drinking shots. When Andy has to drive a drunken Meredith Palmer (Kate Flannery) home, he sees Erin getting into Robert's car and he follows them with a look of panic on his face. However, he covertly witnesses Robert being a gentleman and sending Erin off to her apartment with a hug and words of encouragement. Andy subsequently drives away with a smile on his face.|$|E
5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1845, Palmer {{traveled}} to Oregon without his family, as captain of a wagon train of 23 wagons. Stephen Meek served as the train's paid guide. Meek left the group at Fort Hall to lead {{some of the members}} on the Meek Cutoff. The remaining parts of the wagon train {{reached the end of the}} overland Oregon Trail at the Columbia River, and unwilling to wait for transport down the dangerous Cascade Rapids, Palmer's party joined Sam Barlow's <b>party</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> quest for passage through the Cascade Range around the south side of Mount Hood. Palmer climbed to the 9,000-foot level of Mount Hood on October 7, 1845—with little food and the scant protection of moccasins—to scout a route off the mountains. This was Mount Hood's first recorded climb; the Palmer Glacier on the mountain is named for him.|$|E
5|$|The Song {{judicial}} system retained {{most of the}} legal code of the earlier Tang dynasty, the basis of traditional Chinese law up until the modern era. Roving sheriffs maintained {{law and order in}} the municipal jurisdictions and occasionally ventured into the countryside. Official magistrates overseeing court cases were not only expected to be well-versed in written law but also to promote morality in society. Magistrates such as the famed Bao Qingtian (999–1062) embodied the upright, moral judge who upheld justice and never {{failed to live up to}} his principles. Song judges specified the guilty person or <b>party</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> criminal act and meted out punishments accordingly, often in the form of caning. A guilty individual or parties brought to court for a criminal or civil offense were not viewed as wholly innocent until proven otherwise, while even accusers were viewed with a high level of suspicion by the judge. Due to costly court expenses and immediate jailing of those accused of criminal offences, people in the Song preferred to settle disputes and quarrels privately, without the court's interference.|$|E

They are ambushed by Saturos and Menardi, along with Felix, a previous resident of Vale who was kidnapped during the storms three years earlier. They kidnap Jenna and Kraden and take {{three of the four}} Elemental Stars and depart to light the four lighthouses and release Alchemy on the world. Isaac's party is joined by two other young adepts named Ivan and Mia, and together they pursue Saturos' <b>party</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> lengthy chase and journey that follows eventually spans two continents, climaxing in a fierce battle that leads to Saturos and Menardi's death.|$|E
5|$|Years later colonial trader Ludovick Grant, {{who lived}} in Great Tellico and briefly {{accompanied}} Cuming during his tour, described the latter's techniques. In each town, Cuming arranged a meeting with local Cherokee leaders. He arrived fully armed at the meeting at the town council house, in defiance of custom. There he made a prepared speech {{saying that he was}} a private citizen wishing only to see their country, and that if any Indians wished to return to England with him, he would take them. He asked them to join his <b>party</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> toast to the health of King George II, and to kneel in allegiance. He told his guides that he would have set fire to the townhouse and killed the assembled Indians if they refused.|$|E
5|$|Zajączek participated as {{a deputy}} from the Podole Voivodeship in the Sejm (parliament of the Commonwealth) session of 1784, {{and was a}} vocal member of the hetman Branicki's faction (known as the Hetmans' <b>Party).</b> <b>In</b> <b>a</b> similar vein he participated in the Sejm of 1786, this time as a deputy from the Kiev Voivodeship. During that time he emerged as a vocal critic of king Stanisław August Poniatowski. In late 1786 he married Aleksandra Iaura, née de Pernet. Meanwhile, he kept being {{promoted}} in ranks, reaching that of colonel in 1787. He was also not a deputy to {{the first half of}} the Four-year Sejm (1788–1792), and spent the first two years of its deliberations with his unit (2nd Front Guard Regiment, Polish: 2 regiment straży przedniej) on the Ukrainian border; in 1790, however, he was elected as a deputy once again and joined his patron Branicki in Warsaw. Soon, however, he left Branicki's camp, joining the faction of Hugo Kołłątaj, the Patriotic Party. Zajączek became involved in the works of a commission tasked with reforming the Polish military, and contributed to a new project on military exercises and officer training. He became one of the supporters of the new Constitution of 3 May 1791, and members of the Friends of the Constitution society.|$|E
