5|$|Variety subreticulatus, like variety boralis, has a {{generally}} darker coloration than the two-colored bolete, but varies {{much more than}} either. When fresh the coloration of the cap varies from a rose red, red, rose pink, dark red, and <b>purple</b> <b>red.</b> With age it changes to a cinnamon red or a rusty rose color, with yellowing toward the margin. The pore surface {{is similar to that}} of the main speciesyellow when fresh and with age changing to a dull ochre yellow; the bruising coloration is blue but is much lighter and sometimes not appearing to stain when bruised at all. The spore print is olive brown. The distribution of variety subreticulatus is very similar to the distribution of the two-colored bolete in North America, and appears north to eastern Canada and south to Florida, and west to Wisconsin.|$|E
25|$|The {{softened}} fibers {{are kept}} in water until they are processed. This {{needs to be done}} as quickly as possible so that they do not rot. At this stage, chlorine bleach may be added to either lighten the paper entirely or to create a mix of shades to create a marbled effect. This step has become necessary {{due to the lack of}} naturally light bark fibers. If the paper is to be colored, strong industrial dyes are used. These can vary from <b>purple,</b> <b>red,</b> green or pink, whatever the demand is.|$|E
25|$|Creme {{eggs are}} usually sold {{individually}} {{but are also}} available in boxes containing a varying quantity of eggs depending on the country the packaging is intended for. The foil wrapping of the eggs was traditionally green, red, yellow and blue in colour in the United Kingdom and Ireland, though green was removed and purple replaced blue early in the 21st century. In the United States, some green is incorporated into the design, which previously featured the product's mascot—the Creme Egg Chick. As of 2015, the packaging in Canada {{has turned into a}} 34g, <b>purple,</b> <b>red</b> and yellow soft plastic shell.|$|E

25|$|At present, no canonical, presecribed use of colours can be detected, {{except that}} at least from Augustan times the {{background}} was usually in light blue regardless of the scenes and motifs, but it could include two or more other colours as well. The colour of human skin was usually in something between dark red and hot pink. In Dionysiac scenes, skin could also be painted a reddy-brown. In Augustan times light yellow was not unusual for skin. At Hannover, violet-brown, reddy brown, <b>purple,</b> <b>red,</b> yellow, yellow-brown, turquoise-green, dark bown, pink, blue, black, and white can all be identified. Today the paint is lost in almost all cases and only residual traces can be recognised.|$|E
25|$|Four Andean civilizations {{flourished in}} Late Intermediate Period: the Chancay, Chimú, Lambayeque, and Ica. Luxury goods, {{including}} elaborate ceramics, were mass-produced in vast quantities {{for the middle}} class as well as nobles. Identical ceramics created in molds took sway over individualized works. The Lambayeque culture of north coastal Peru created press-molded reliefs on blackware ceramics. Chimú ceramics, also predominantly blackware, often featured zoomorphic appliqués, such as monkeys or sea birds. They excelled at the doubled-chambered whistling vessels. Chancay ceramics, from the central coast, featured black-on-white designs on unique shapes, such as female effigies or elongated, oval jars. Their sand-tempered ceramics were hastily painted and left unpolished. Ica culture ceramics, from the southern coasts, were the finest quality of their time. They were still handcrafted and had a wide range of polychrome slips, including black, maroon, orange, <b>purple,</b> <b>red,</b> white, and a glittery deep purple. Designs were abstract and geometric.|$|E
25|$|Edmund Roberts {{calls the}} island Crokatoa in his journal. A paraphrased account follows: On 8 September 1832, US sloop-of war Peacock {{anchored}} off the north end, also visiting Long Island, {{in search of}} inhabitants, fresh water, and yams. It was found difficult to effect a landing anywhere, owing to a heavy surf and to the coral having extended itself to a considerable distance from the shore. Hot springs boiling furiously up, through many fathoms of water, {{were found on the}} eastern side of Krakatoa, 150 feet from the shore. Roberts, Captain Geisinger, and marine Lieutenant Fowler visited Forsaken island, having mistaken the singing of locusts for the sound of running water. The boat glided over crystal clear water, over an extensive and highly beautiful submarine garden. Corals of every shape and hue were there; some resembling sunflowers and mushrooms; others, cabbages from an inch to three feet in diameter: while a third bore a striking likeness to the rose. The hillsides were typical of tropical climate; large flocks of parrots, monkeys in great variety, wild-mango and orange groves—a superb scene of plants and flowers of every description, glowing in vivid tints of <b>purple,</b> <b>red,</b> blue, brown, and green—but not the so-much-needed supply of water and provisions.|$|E
