Moreover, attention to the relationship between navigation and environment (particularly with regards to the marine environment) has sensibly increased in the last years as testified by numerous innovations in eco-compatible marine engines and in the navigation in <b>protected</b> <b>sea</b> <b>areas.</b> Recreational boating industry, in swift development, represents a sector of excellence for the made-in-Italy that – by virtue of considerable investments in technology of environmental interest – allowed the making of boats that present innovative solutions and eco-compatible standard which, sometimes, anticipated communitarian laws. Italian products reveal, thus, to be aligned with the safeguard needs for places of environmental value, also after the introduction of the “Environmental premiality” for eco-compatible boats in <b>protected</b> <b>sea</b> <b>areas</b> – soon to be consolidated, in consideration of an extension of these good practices to the entire protected area system. The present study aims at providing the instruments necessary to the understanding of the importance of recreational boating and its eco-compatible fruition, by means of an accurate analysis of the situation in <b>protected</b> <b>sea</b> <b>areas</b> and, particularly, of the case-study of the AMP of Tavolara-Punta Coda Cavallo. ...|$|R

Therefore the echo-ranging detection systems require state-of-the-art hardware and efficient processing algorithms to <b>protect</b> <b>sea</b> <b>areas.</b> Such up-to-date hydroacoustic equipment was developed by R&D Marine Technology Centre. The SHL- 101 /T system is the triple frequency, wideband and very high resolution hull-mounted minehunting sonar. It was put into service to Polish Navy minesweeper on April 2007. Sonar underwent factory, harbour and sea acceptance trials. Presently Polish Navy carries out further exploitation and military tests. The results are remarkable and they enable to explore mysteries of the sunken objects in the Gdansk Gulf. The paper presents the results of SHL- 101 /T sonar harbour and sea trials.

40|$|A {{standard}} digestion method {{coupled to}} electrochemical detection for the monitoring of heavy metals in biological samples {{has been used}} for the simultaneous analysis of the target analytes. Square wave anodic stripping voltammetry (SWASV) coupled to disposable screen-printed electrodes (SPEs) was employed as a fast and sensitive electroanalytical method for the detection of heavy metals. The aim of our study was to determine Cd, Pb and Cu by SWASV in brown algae (Sargasum natan) and green turtle eggs (Chelonia mydas) using screen-printed electrodes. The method proved useful for the simultaneous analysis of these metals by comparison between two different procedures for preparing the samples. Two different approaches in digestion protocols were assessed. The study was focused on Guanahacabibes brown algae and green turtle eggs because the metal concentrations recorded in this area may be used for intraspecific comparison within the Guanahacabibes <b>Protected</b> <b>Sea</b> Park <b>area,</b> a body of water for which information is still very scarce. The best results were obtained by digesting biological samples with the EPA 3050 B method.

It is an important cultural and natural resource that contributes with several economic benefits. Among the many documents aiming to <b>protect</b> the Baltic <b>Sea,</b> this thesis concerns two of the action plans; An Agenda for the Baltic Sea Region – Baltic 21 and HELCOM Baltic Sea Action Plan, which {{are two of the}} most recognised documents aiming at <b>protecting</b> the Baltic <b>Sea</b> <b>area.</b> The two documents was analysed using three different types of text analysis. As the main goal in all environmental protection is to urge preventive action in protecting the environment, the two documents will be analysed with the aim of investigating whether preventive action is advocated in the protection of the Baltic Sea, even though the region is threatened and have many problems from an environmental point of view. The two documents differ structurally as their approaches differ. The HELCOM Baltic Sea Action Plan (BSAP) has an ecosystem approach, whiles the Baltic 21 has sustainable development as its primarily approach. The results of the study further show that preventive action is advocated in both documents. However, the BSAP presents a cleared preventive approach and suggests more preventive action than Baltic 21. Baltic 21 lack a clear connection to the Baltic Sea and instead focus in the whole Baltic <b>Sea</b> <b>area.</b> There are few clearly preventive action presented in the protection of the actual Baltic Sea in Baltic 21.

The new Water Framework Directive will, eventually, also have consequences for the area. What are the consequences of EU Directives aimed at <b>protecting</b> the Wadden <b>Sea</b> <b>area?</b> Provide these Directives effective protection against harmful activities? These questions have been dealt with through a case study on the decision-making process with regard to mechanical cockle fisheries in the Dutch part of the Wadden Sea in 2004. Also, data obtained from other European research projects into {{the effectiveness of the}} Directives have been analyzed. These studies indicate that especially the Wild Birds and Habitats Directives can be very effective tools for legal protection of the area. Especially case law by the European Court of Justice has rendered the Directives strong teeth. The Directives offer opportunities to protect the area, without neglecting economic interests, although the effectiveness still very much depends on the political will to take the Directives seriously, and/or on NGOs that go to court, invoking the provisions of the Directives. According to some, the Directives are too effective! Evaluation and amendments of the Wild Birds and Habitats Directives are to be expected within the next few years.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine the appropriate initial body size and the corresponding stocking density of sea bass, Lates calcarifer, during nursery rearing in illuminated cages. Hatchery-produced sea bass fry of different initial sizes of 7. 2 (day 15), 13. 2 (day 22), and 15. 2 mm (day 29) were stocked at densities between 300 and 1, 500 m - 3 in decreasing order with fish size. Nylon net cages (1 x 1 x 1 m) set in a <b>protected</b> <b>sea</b> cove <b>area</b> were individually lit at 300 lux using incandescent bulb placed at 1 m above water surface. Artificial lights attract wild zooplankton that served as prey to young sea bass. After 42 days of culture 22 -day old sea bass fry with 13. 2 mm TL initial size and stocked at 400 m - 3 showed the highest growth (35. 3 mm TL, 535. 7 mg BW) and survival rates (64. 4 %). At a stocking density of 800 m - 3, the survival rate was the second highest at 43 %. Although day 15 -fry at 7. 2 mm TL initial size showed higher specific growth rates (11 % day - 1) and size at harvest (29 - 31 mm TL, 346. 2 - 374. 4 mg BW), survival rates (11 - 15 %) were lower than the day 22 - and 29 -fry (30 - 64 %). Calanoid copepods of the genus Calanus, Paracalanus and Acartia dominated the diet (81 - 90 %) of sea bass at different size groups. Percentage number of shooters ranged from 0. 5 - 1. 4 % of total stocks and were not significantly different among treatments. The present results indicate that sea bass should spend 21 days in the hatchery prior to nursery rearing in illuminated sea cages.

However, the Navy considered the armored area of these ships restricted and the caliber of their heavy guns small compared to their displacement. This did not stop the Navy's Bureau of Construction and Repair (C) from requesting funds from Congress for two additional units as part of the 1901 naval building program. When Congress did not approve funding for these ships, this obligated the Secretary of the Navy under law to order a new study of capital ship and armored cruiser designs that Congress might approve. A smaller, 11,000-ton design with thinner armor than the Pennsylvanias was favored by the Board's new Chief Constructor, F. T. Bowles, who considered the Pennsylvanias [...] "indefensible on account of their size." [...] However, reducing the size of any new warships was considered unacceptable politically, as Congress had already opposed the growth in size and cost of vessels recently commissioned. Also, Rear Admiral R.B.
