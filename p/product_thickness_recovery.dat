Drying curves exhibited first order drying kinetics and effective moisture diffusivity values varied between 3. 1 × 10 − 9 and 52. 6 × 10 − 9 m 2 /s. The temperature dependence of the effective moisture diffusivity was satisfactorily described by an Arrhenius-type relationship. Drying conditions, <b>product</b> <b>thickness</b> and operation temperature had various effects on drying rate and final quality of the product. In terms of drying kinetics and final quality of product, vacuum drying had higher drying rate with higher conservation of phenolic, anthocyanin and ascorbic acid that is connected to faster drying condition and oxygen deficient medium.

40|$|International audienceIn this study, {{predictive}} microbiology and food engineering were combined {{in order to}} develop a new analytical model predicting the bacterial growth under dynamic temperature conditions. The proposed model associates a simplified primary bacterial growth model without lag, the secondary Ratkowsky "square root" model and a simplified two-parameter heat transfer model regarding an infinite slab. The model takes into consideration the <b>product</b> <b>thickness,</b> its thermal properties, the ambient air temperature, the convective heat transfer coefficient and the growth parameters of the micro organism of concern. For the validation of the overall model, five different combinations of ambient air temperature (ranging from 8 °C to 12 °C), <b>product</b> <b>thickness</b> (ranging from 1 cm to 6 cm) and convective heat transfer coefficient (ranging from 8 W/ (m 2 K) to 60 W/(m 2 K)) were tested during a cooling procedure. Moreover, three different ambient air temperature scenarios assuming alternated cooling and heating stages, drawn from real refrigerated food processes, were tested. General agreement between predicted and observed bacterial growth was obtained and less than 5 % of the experimental data fell outside the 95 % confidence bands estimated by the bootstrap percentile method, at all the tested conditions. Accordingly, the overall model was successfully validated for isothermal and dynamic refrigeration cycles allowing for temperature dynamic changes at the centre and at the surface of the product. The major impact of the convective heat transfer coefficient and the <b>product</b> <b>thickness</b> on bacterial growth during the product cooling was demonstrated. For instance, the time needed for the same level of bacterial growth to be reached at the <b>product's</b> half <b>thickness</b> was estimated to be 5 and 16. 5 h at low and high convection level, respectively. Moreover, simulation results demonstrated that the predicted bacterial growth at the air ambient temperature cannot be assumed to be equivalent to the bacterial growth occurring at the product's surface or centre when convection heat transfer is taken into account. Our results indicate that combining food engineering and {{predictive microbiology}} models is an interesting approach providing very useful tools for food safety and process optimisation...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{study the}} effect of short-chain fatty-acids on atrophy and {{inflammation}} of excluded colonic segments {{before and after the}} development of diversion colitis. INTRODUCTION: Diversion colitis is a chronic inflammatory process affecting the dysfunctional colon, possibly evolving with mucous and blood discharge. The most favored hypotheses to explain its development is short-chain fatty-acid deficiency in the colon lumen. METHODS: Wistar rats were submitted to colostomy with distal colon exclusion. Two control groups (A 1 and B 1) received rectally administered physiological saline, whereas two experimental groups (A 2 and B 2) received rectally administered short-chain fatty-acids. The A groups were prophylactically treated (5 th to 40 th days postoperatively), whereas the B groups were therapeutically treated (after post-operative day 40). The mucosal thickness of the excluded colon was measured histologically. The inflammatory reaction of the mucosal lamina propria and the lymphoid tissue response were quantified through established scores. RESULTS: There was a significant <b>thickness</b> <b>recovery</b> of the colonic mucosa in group B 2 animals (p = 0. 0001), which also exhibited a significant {{reduction in the number of}} eosinophilic polymorphonuclear cells in the lamina propria (p = 0. 0126) and in the intestinal lumen (p = 0. 0256). Group A 2 showed no mucosal <b>thickness</b> <b>recovery</b> and significant increases in the numbers of lymphocytes (p = 0. 0006) and eosinophilic polymorphonuclear cells in the lamina propria of the mucosa (p = 0. 0022).

The microstructural unit was found to be composed of thin expanded graphite discs with slightly misaligned basal planes of graphite. Highly localized deformation of a thin expanded graphite disc was observed during the compression and recovery processes, suggesting strong interaction with surrounding expanded graphite discs. The macroscopic compression behavior of flexible graphite is attributable to a combination of bending and thickness reduction/recovery of the discs.

40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} the acute effects of isolated eccentric and concentric calf muscle exercise on Achilles tendon sagittal thickness. Design: Within-subject, counterbalanced, mixed design. Setting: Institutional. Participants: 11 healthy, recreationally active male adults. Interventions: Participants performed an exercise protocol, which involved isolated eccentric loading of the Achilles tendon {{of a single}} limb and isolated concentric loading of the contralateral, both {{with the addition of}} 20 % bodyweight. Main outcome measurements: Sagittal sonograms were acquired prior to, immediately following and 3, 6, 12 and 24 h after exercise. Tendon thickness was measured 2 cm proximal to the superior aspect of the calcaneus. Results: Both loading conditions resulted in an immediate decrease in normalised Achilles tendon thickness. Eccentric loading induced a significantly greater decrease than concentric loading despite a similar impulse (− 0. 21 vs − 0. 05, p< 0. 05). Post-exercise, eccentrically loaded tendons recovered exponentially, with a recovery time constant of 2. 5 h. The same exponential function did not adequately model changes in tendon thickness resulting from concentric loading. Even so, recovery pathways subsequent to the 3 h time point were comparable. Regardless of the exercise protocol, full tendon <b>thickness</b> <b>recovery</b> was not observed until 24 h.

We hypothesized that meniscectomy alters nominal strain in tibial articular cartilage, and that meniscectomy affects cartilage <b>thickness</b> <b>recovery</b> following cessation of loading. MethodsA cyclic load simulating normal gait {{was applied to}} four sheep knees. A custom device was used to obtain MR images of cartilage at 4. 7 T during cyclic loading. Articular cartilage thickness and nominal strain were measured every 2. 5 min during 1 h of cyclic loading, and during 2. 5 h after cessation of loading. ResultsFollowing meniscectomy the loaded joints rapidly developed high strain centrally and minimal strain peripherally. Maximum nominal strains after 1 h of loading were about 55 % in the intact knees and 72 % in the meniscectomized knees. Nominal strains in the peripheral tibial cartilage were significantly reduced in the meniscectomized knees. Strain recovery was markedly prolonged in the meniscectomized knees. ConclusionsWith meniscectomy, tibial articular cartilage in the central load bearing region remains chronically deformed and dehydrated, even after cessation of loading. Post-meniscectomy osteoarthritis may be initiated in this region by direct damage to the cartilage matrix, or by altering the hydration of the tissue. In peripheral regions, reduced loading and strain may facilitate subchondral vascular invasion, and endochondral ossification.

The efforts of this research have been to develop an approach which combines the VTC process with a chemical modification process resulting in a novel wood-based product that exhibits improved structural properties, as well as a high degree of dimensional stability. Low-grade, plantation-grown hybrid poplar (Populus spp.) was impregnated with low molecular weight phenol-formaldehyde resin, acetic anhydride or tung oil and then densified in the VTC process.
