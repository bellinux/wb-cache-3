5|$|Lovejoy {{was elected}} in 1848 to {{what would be the}} final session of the <b>Provisional</b> <b>Legislature,</b> which was held in late 1848 into early 1849. However, Lovejoy now {{representing}} Vancouver District north of the Columbia River resigned before the session started. In September 1848, he traveled with a group to California during the California Gold Rush, but returned aboard the brig Undine in January 1849 after six weeks in California. During the same session he resigned from, he was selected by the <b>Provisional</b> <b>Legislature</b> as Supreme Judge of the government on February 16, 1849, but never served and the Provisional government was dissolved the following month {{with the arrival of the}} territorial government.|$|E
5|$|That autumn, Barlow {{considered}} the route {{over the mountains}} and petitioned the <b>Provisional</b> <b>Legislature</b> of Oregon for permission to build a road on December 9, 1845, claiming that his estimated cost of $4000 was {{lower than that of}} others familiar with the route. Permission was granted with a vote of 8-2 on December 17, 1845, approved by Speaker pro-tem Henry A. G. Lee, and signed into law by Governor George Abernethy.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Provisional</b> <b>Legislature</b> held session {{mainly in}} Oregon City. They met at {{different}} times each year, and in 1848 they did not meet; too many members had left for the California gold fields. The legislature enacted various laws, sent memorials to Congress, incorporated towns and organizations, and granted divorces and licenses to run ferries. After {{the establishment of the}} Oregon Territory, the legislature was replaced with the two house Oregon Territorial Legislature.|$|E

Lovejoy ran for the newly created office of governor that replaced the Executive Committee in 1845 with the adoption of the Second Organic Laws of Oregon. George Abernethy won the election after he received the most votes with 228, followed by Osbourne Russell with 130, William J. Bailey with 75, and finally Lovejoy with 71 votes. Though he lost the election for governor, he was elected as mayor of Oregon City that year.|$|E
5|$|On June 15, 1846, the Oregon Treaty {{was signed}} with Great Britain, which settled {{the dispute over}} {{sovereignty}} of the Oregon Country. On August 13, 1848 the United States Congress created the Oregon Territory out of the land between California and the 49th parallel (this served as the border with Britain's North American colonies) and west of the Rocky Mountains. A new bicameral territorial legislature was created with an upper chamber Council and lower chamber House. These bodies {{met for the first}} time on July 16, 1849, with some members of the <b>provisional</b> <b>legislature</b> continuing into the new government, including David Hill, Asa Lovejoy, Samuel Parker, and Absalom J. Hembree. Upon statehood in 1859, the territorial legislature would be transformed into the Oregon Legislative Assembly.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Provisional</b> <b>Legislature</b> of Oregon was the single-chamber {{legislative}} {{body of the}} Provisional Government of Oregon. It served the Oregon Country of the Pacific Northwest of North America from 1843 until early 1849 {{at a time when}} no country had sovereignty over the region. This democratically elected legislature became the Oregon Territorial Legislature when the territorial authorities arrived after the creation of the Oregon Territory by the United States in 1848. The body was first termed the Legislative Committee and later renamed the House of Representatives. Over the course of its six-year history the legislature passed laws, including taxation and liquor regulation, and created an army to deal with conflicts with Native Americans.|$|E
50|$|With the Allied {{invasion}} of Normandy, the Committee moved its headquarters to London, and in August 1944 the Committee moved to Paris, following {{the liberation of}} France by Allied forces. In September, Allied forces recognized the Committee as the legitimate, provisional government of France, whereupon the Committee reorganized itself under the presidency of Charles de Gaulle, incorporating representatives of various French political parties such as the Socialists and French Communists. The Committee also began {{the process of writing}} a new constitution to found the French Fourth Republic. However, Charles de Gaulle resigned in 1946 over the <b>provisional</b> <b>legislature's</b> refusal to grant more powers to the President and owing to the in-fighting between various political factions and the Communists.|$|R

5000|$|On 25 September 1932, an {{agreement}} known as Poona Pact was signed between Dr. Ambedkar (on {{behalf of the}} depressed classes among Hindus) and Malaviya (on behalf of the other Hindus). The agreement gave reserved seats for the depressed classes in the <b>Provisional</b> <b>legislatures,</b> within the general electorate and not by creating a separate electorate. Due to the pact, the depressed class received 148 seats in the legislature, instead of the 71 as allocated in the Communal Award proposal of the British Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald. After the pact, the Communal Award was modified to include the terms as per the pacts. The text uses the term [...] "Depressed Classes" [...] to denote Untouchables among Hindus who were later called Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes under India Act 1935, and the later Indian Constitution of 1950.|$|R
5|$|The <b>Provisional</b> <b>Legislature</b> met for two {{sessions}} in late 1848 and early 1849. The first session, from December 5 to December 13, never formally organized {{as so many}} of the representatives had traveled south for the California Gold Rush. Beginning on February 5, a session was organized that conducted the final business of the Provisional Government. The session lasted until February 16. During this session a law forbidding the sale of firearms and supplies to Native Americans was repealed, and a law was passed to authorize the minting of gold coins. The law concerning the coins allowed for the creation of the Beaver Coins, which had a higher gold content than United States minted coins. Less than a month later, when the new territorial governor Joseph Lane arrived, however, he rescinded the law as unconstitutional and the coins were collected and removed from circulation. For the legislative session Ralph Wilcox was chosen as speaker, but he resigned from the post. Stephen Meek served as the doorkeeper, William G. T’Vault as a clerk, and William Holmes as sergeant at arms.|$|E
25|$|The Provisional Government of Oregon was the region's {{governing}} body from 1843 until 1849, {{at the end}} of the region's joint settlement by Great Britain and the United States.

50|$|In 1890 {{the newly}} {{appointed}} British Resident, Frederick Moss, persuaded the ariki of Rarotonga {{to form a}} <b>provisional</b> Rarotongan <b>legislature</b> or General Council, the first government for the entire island. The following year representatives of the ariki from Rarotonga and the Southern Group islands agreed to form the first federal legislature in the islands. However the path through {{the last decade of}} the 19th century was far from smooth and the numerous changes that took place were not well accepted by some ariki and members of the nobility.|$|R
2500|$|In 1932, British {{announced}} {{the formation of}} a separate electorate for [...] "Depressed Classes" [...] in the Communal Award. Gandhi fiercely opposed a separate electorate for untouchables, saying he feared that such an arrangement would divide the Hindu community. Gandhi protested by fasting while imprisoned in the Yerwada Central Jail of Poona. Following the fast, Congress politicians and activists such as Madan Mohan Malaviya and Palwankar Baloo organised joint meetings with Ambedkar and his supporters at Yerwada. On 25 September 1932, the agreement known as Poona Pact was signed between Ambedkar (on behalf of the depressed classes among Hindus) and Madan Mohan Malaviya (on behalf of the other Hindus). The agreement gave reserved seats for the depressed classes in the <b>Provisional</b> <b>legislatures,</b> within the general electorate.

25|$|In 1843, Nesmith {{arrived in}} Oregon {{where he studied}} law and was {{admitted}} to the bar before being selected to serve as Supreme Judge of the Provisional Government of Oregon in 1845. He finished his term in 1846 and moved to Polk County where he took a land claim, began farming, and married Pauline Goff on June 21, with whom he would have seven children. In 1847, {{he was elected to the}} <b>Provisional</b> <b>Legislature</b> of Oregon from Polk County, and served briefly in the 1848 session before resigning.|$|E
25|$|During the {{provisional}} government {{time in the}} Oregon Country, Ford was selected by the <b>Provisional</b> <b>Legislature</b> to be the Supreme Judge of Oregon in 1845, but Ford declined to serve. Years later in 1856 {{he was elected to}} the Territorial Legislature to represent Polk and Tillamook Counties. The following two years he was again elected, but representing other counties in addition to Polk County. During this time he served in the upper chamber, called the Council, as a Democrat. 1858 was the last year of the Territorial Legislature, and Ford’s last term as the following year Oregon became a state and the Council became the Oregon Senate.|$|E
25|$|In May 1843, {{he participated}} in the Champoeg Meetings where pioneers debated on whether to create an {{independent}} government for the Oregon Country prior to the settlement of the Oregon boundary dispute. At the meetings, Smith voted {{for the creation of}} the Provisional Government of Oregon and was elected as a magistrate for the Twality District, now Washington County. Smith was appointed by the <b>Provisional</b> <b>Legislature</b> of Oregon as a road viewer for a proposed road from the Willamette Falls to the Tualatin Plains in 1844. In 1851, he was elected as the probate judge for Washington County and received his commission from Territorial Governor John P. Gaines on July 3, 1851.|$|E
50|$|In Yugoslavia, {{elections}} were held while it had existed as a Monarchy, {{the first one}} being in 1918 for the <b>Provisional</b> Popular <b>Legislature</b> of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (which was preceded by local elections of National Councils in former Austria-Hungary, including the elections in Vojvodina and Montenegro for local parliaments) and the last being the parliamentary (National Assembly {{and half of the}} Senate) election of 1935. Women were not eligible to vote. After the 1918 indirect ones, the 1920 parliamentary election was the first direct one. Parliamentary Elections were held in 1923, 1925 and 1927, while with the new constitution a de facto Lower and Upper House were introduced in 1931 (the Senate next to the National Assembly). The 1931 {{elections were}} not free, as they were handled under a single-course dictatorship, while the 1935 and 1938 were held under limited basic democratic principles.|$|R
50|$|On November 7, 1859, Governor Robert Williamson Steele {{opened the}} first session of the <b>provisional</b> Jefferson Territorial <b>Legislature</b> in Denver City with the {{following}} proclamation: Let us then enter upon our duties with a determination of spirit that conquers all difficulties: working {{for the benefit of}} the whole commonwealth, encouraging moderation and conservation in all our acts, that we may never be ashamed of having taken an humble part of the organization of a Provisional Government for the Territory of Jefferson. During this first session, the legislature organized 12 counties. (The Colorado General Assembly would create 17 counties with somewhat similar boundaries in 1861.) The legislature adjourned on December 7, 1859.|$|R
25|$|In 1842, Newell {{helped to}} {{establish}} the Oregon Lyceum at Oregon City, Oregon. He would later become {{the director of the}} Oregon Printing Association that grew out of the Lyceum and started the first newspaper west of the Rocky Mountains, the Oregon Spectator. At the May 2, 1843, settler meeting Newell voted in favor of creating a provisional government in the region. The vote passed 52 to 50 and a <b>Provisional</b> <b>Legislature</b> was created. Newell served in that body from 1843 until it was replaced with the Oregon Territorial Legislature in 1849, although he resigned during the final session. During the 1847 meeting of the group, Newell served as Speaker of the body.|$|E
25|$|In 1843, Burnett {{became part}} of the exodus of Easterners moving Westward, moving his family to the Oregon Country (now modern-day Oregon) to take up farming in order to solve growing debts in Missouri, an {{agricultural}} endeavour that failed. While in the Oregon Country, Burnett began his forays into politics, getting elected to the <b>provisional</b> <b>legislature</b> between 1844 and 1848. In 1844, he completed construction of Germantown Road between the Tualatin Valley and what became Portland. It was during his time in Oregon that Burnett, a traditional Southern Protestant, began to question the practices of his faith, drifting his religious views more to Roman Catholicism. By 1846, Burnett and his family made the complete transition from Protestant to become Catholic.|$|E
25|$|In 1849, Burnett {{announced}} his intentions {{to return to}} politics. 1849 saw the first California Constitutional Convention in Monterey, where territorial politicians drafted documents suitable to admit California as a state in the United States. During the 1849 referendum to adopt the California Constitution, Burnett, now with name recognition in Sacramento and San Francisco, and a resume that included the Oregon <b>Provisional</b> <b>Legislature,</b> {{decided to run for}} the new territory's first civilian governor, replacing the string of military governors and bureaucracy from the U.S. military. Burnett easily won the election over four other candidates, including John Sutter, and was sworn in as California's first elected civilian governor on December 20, 1849 in San Jose in front of the California State Legislature.|$|E
500|$|On May 2, 1843, {{by a vote}} of 52 to 50, the European American {{settlers}} [...] of the Oregon Country (mainly {{those from}} the Willamette Valley), created a provisional government at Champoeg. In May and June, a nine-person committee met in Oregon City and drafted the Organic Laws of Oregon as a pseudo-constitution that was subsequently ratified on July 5, 1843. This document created the government and authorized a <b>provisional</b> <b>legislature</b> of nine people.|$|E
500|$|The Barlow Road (at inception, Mount Hood Road) is a {{historic}} road {{in what is now}} the U.S. state of Oregon. It was built in 1846 by Sam Barlow and Philip Foster, with authorization of the <b>Provisional</b> <b>Legislature</b> of Oregon, and served as the last overland segment of the Oregon Trail.

500|$|The {{discovery}} of iron ore near {{the settlement of}} Oswego in the hills south of Portland is credited to Morton M.

2500|$|Once in Oregon, McCarver settled {{along the}} Columbia River {{in what is}} now Portland, Oregon. He made a land claim and founded Linnton in 1843, which is now part of Portland. On June 18, 1844, he was {{selected}} as the speaker of the Legislative Committee, the forerunner to the Oregon House of Representatives. In 1845, he was again elected to the <b>Provisional</b> <b>Legislature</b> of Oregon from Tuality District and was selected as the speaker of the then renamed House of Representatives, the first to hold that position.

The bill was read twice and voted into law the following day. The bill contained methods of enforcement for the prevention of slavery, which had already been banned in the territory. These laws included a three year limit on all free blacks, and required freed slaves to leave the state within two years, if male, and three years, if female. The initial law proposed [...] "no more than 20" [...] lashings by whip for slaves found in violation of the law, which was amended in December 1844. A week after the law's passage, Burnett wrote in a personal letter that the bill was intended to [...] "keep clear of that most troublesome class of population." ...|$|E
2500|$|Peter Burnett's {{legacy is}} largely mixed. While {{regarded}} as one of the fathers of modern California in the state's early days, Burnett's openly racist attitudes towards blacks, Chinese and Native Americans have blackened his name today. Burnett's period in the Oregon <b>Provisional</b> <b>Legislature</b> helped facilitate the exclusion of Blacks from the state until 1926. One of his Oregon proposals was to force free Blacks to leave the state, and to institute floggings, every six months, of any who continued to remain. Also, his open hostility to foreign laborers influenced a number of federal and state California legislators to push future xenophobic legislation, such as the Chinese Exclusion Act thirty years after his departure from the governorship. Burnett was also an open advocate of exterminating local California Indian tribes, a policy that continued with successive state governmental administrations for several decades, where the state offered US$10 to US$25 for evidence of dead Natives.
