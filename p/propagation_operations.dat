40|$|Triple graph grammars (TGGs) {{have been}} used {{successfully}} to analyse correctness of bidirectional model transformations. Most recently, also a corresponding formal approach to model synchronization has been presented, where a forward <b>propagation</b> <b>operation</b> updates a source model modification from source to target, and symmetrically, a backward <b>propagation</b> <b>operation</b> takes care of updates from target to source models. However, a corresponding formal approach of concurrent model synchronization, where a source and a target modification have to be synchronized simultaneously, {{has not yet been}} presented and analysed. This paper closes this gap taking into account that the given and propagated source or target model modifications are in conflict with each other. Our conflict resolution strategy is semi-automatic, where a formal resolution strategy – known from previous work – can be combined with a user-specific strategy. As first main result, we show correctness of concurrent model synchronization with respect to the TGG. This means that each result of our nondeterministic concurrent update leads to a consistent correspondence between source and target models, where consistency is defined by the TGG. As second main result, we show compatibility of concurrent with basic model synchronization. In other words, concurrent model synchronization can be realized either to coincide with forward or with backward propagation. The main results are illustrated by a running example on updating organizational models...|$|R

30|$|The main factor {{influencing}} the fracture orientated propagation is horizontal stress difference. The increasing of horizontal stress difference {{is good for}} decreasing the failure pressure but not good for fracture orientated propagation. The azimuth of radial well influences the failure pressure mainly, which means low azimuth is good for fracture operation. The increase of vertical density of radial wells improves the effect of fracture orientated propagation greatly. The recommended vertical density of radial wells is larger or equal to 1 well per meter in this case. The increasing of elastic modulus of formation is not conducive to the fracture initiation, orientated propagation and maximum fracture width. The increasing of Poisson’s ratio of formation is conducive to the fracture initiation and maximum fracture width, but not as helpful as to fracture orientated propagation. Large diameter of radial well is good for fracture oriented <b>propagation.</b> <b>Operation</b> parameters of fracturing fluid viscosity and construction displacement have less effect on fracture oriented propagation and could be adjusted according to the actual situation.|$|R

Evidence <b>propagation</b> <b>operations</b> are critical for the computation {{of the value of}} evidence, general update and inference operations in normative expert systems which are based on the influence diagram (generalized Bayesian network) paradigm. The value of evidence allows us to compute directly an outcome sensitivity, a value of perfect information and a value of control which are used in decision analysis (the science of decision making under uncertainty). More specifically, the outcome sensitivity is the maximum difference among the values of evidence, the value of perfect information is the expected value of the values of evidence, and the value of control is the optimal value of the values of evidence. We also discuss an implementation and a relative computational efficiency issues related to the value of evidence and the value of perfect information.

However, previous binarization scheme could be regarded as simple pixel-wise thresholding operations (i. e., order-one approximation) and suffers a big accuracy loss. In this paper, we propose a highorder binarization scheme, which achieves more accurate approximation while still possesses the advantage of binary operation. In particular, the proposed scheme recursively performs residual quantization and yields a series of binary input images with decreasing magnitude scales. Accordingly, we propose high-order binary filtering and gradient <b>propagation</b> <b>operations</b> for both forward and backward computations.

40|$|Abstract. Main stream {{approaches}} in {{distributed artificial intelligence}} (DAI) are essentially logic-based. Little {{has been reported to}} explore probabilistic approach in DAI. On the other hand, Bayesian networks have been applied to many AI tasks that require reasoning under uncertainty. However, as commonly applied, a single-agent paradigm is assumed in Bayesian networks. This paper extends multiply sectioned Bayesian networks (MSBNs) for single-agent systems into a framework for multi-agent distributed interpretation systems. Each cooperative agent is represented as a Bayesian subnet that consumes its own computational resource, gathers its own evidence, and can answer queries. Unlike in single-agent systems where evidence is entered one subnet at a time, multiple agents may acquire evidence in parallel. We add to the set of single-agent MSBN operations new belief <b>propagation</b> <b>operations</b> which, when performed, regain global consistency. Due to the inter-agent ’distance ’ and the associated communication cost, global consistency can not be maintained constantly.

40|$|As {{the study}} of graphs, such as web and social graphs, becomes {{increasingly}} popular, the requirements of efficiency and program-ming flexibility of large graph processing tasks challenge existing tools. We propose to demonstrate Surfer, a large graph process-ing engine designed to execute in the cloud. Surfer provides two basic primitives for programmers – MapReduce and propagation. MapReduce, originally developed by Google, processes different key-value pairs in parallel, and propagation is an iterative compu-tational pattern that transfers information along the edges from a vertex to its neighbors in the graph. These two primitives are com-plementary in graph processing. MapReduce is suitable for pro-cessing flat data structures, such as vertex-oriented tasks, and prop-agation is optimized for edge-oriented tasks on partitioned graphs. To further improve the programmability of large graph process-ing, Surfer consists of a small set of high level building blocks that use these two primitives. Developers may also construct custom building blocks. Surfer further provides a GUI (Graphical User Interface) using which developers can visually create large graph processing tasks. Surfer transforms a task into an execution plan composed of MapReduce and <b>propagation</b> <b>operations.</b> It then au-tomatically applies various optimizations to improve the efficiency of distributed execution. Surfer also provides a visualization tool to monitor the detailed execution dynamics of the execution plan to show the interesting tradeoffs between MapReduce and propa-gation.

However, the fracture morphology and propagation law of it are still remain unclear, which limits the development and application of it. A 3 D numerical model is established by ABAQUS to solve the current problems. The stage of fracture propagation is simulated by the extended finite element method. The conclusions stated that in situ stress field distribution was changed during the radial well fracturing and the induced stress field along the radial well is established at the same time. The propagation of major fracture is orientated by the induced stress in a certain area. The guiding function of fracture orientated propagation is evaluated by included angle η between the axis of radial well and equivalent fracture. The smaller the value of η is, the better effect of fracture orientated propagation is. The increase of horizontal stress difference and decrease of vertical density of radial wells are unfavorable to decrease the value of η. The failure pressure grows up with the azimuth angle of radial well increasing. The increasing of elastic modulus of formation is not conducive {{to the effect of}} radial well fracturing.
