5000|$|The flat-pattern {{method is}} where the entire <b>pattern</b> is <b>drafted</b> {{on a flat surface}} from measurements, using rulers, curves and straight-edges. A pattern maker would also use various tools such as a notcher, drill and awl to mark the pattern. Usually, flat {{patterning}} begins with the creation of a sloper or block pattern, a simple, fitted garment made to the wearer's measurements. For women, this will usually be a jewel-neck bodice and narrow skirt, and for men an upper sloper and a pants sloper. The final sloper pattern is usually made of cardboard or paperboard, without seam allowances or style details (thicker paper or cardboard allows repeated tracing and pattern development from the original sloper). Once the shape of the sloper has been refined by making a series of mock-up garments called toiles (UK) or muslins (US), the final sloper can be used in turn to create patterns for many styles of garments with varying necklines, sleeves, dart placements, and so on. The flat <b>pattern</b> <b>drafting</b> method is the most commonly used method in menswear; menswear rarely involves draping. There are many pattern making system available, but M.

40|$|A well-tailored {{jacket is}} {{considered}} to be a staple item in a working-woman’s wardrobe. Generally characterized as a garment with notched collar and lapels and a lining, these “tailored” garments are expected to fit appropriately and be constructed to a high level of quality. Classic tailoring, also known as bespoke tailoring in the UK, refers to the methods and techniques used to build a completely original and unique suit for your client. For this project, each of my clients are members of my family: my younger cousin, myself, my mother, and my grandmother. Presenting four generations in my family, I examine the various needs and desires of each age group and translate that into a unique jacket design that will flatter both their body shape and personality. The design is constructed using classic tailoring methods including but not limited to: <b>pattern</b> <b>drafting,</b> fitting, cutting, hand and machine sewing, and careful finishing and pressing. Using luxurious wool and silk fabrics, each design is brought to fruition as a complete wearable garment. By taking this applied research project from concept to garment, I am better able to understand the design process and the labor-intensive work involved in custom-tailored garments. While still applying the high-quality bespoke techniques, I explore both conventional and unconventional elements in tailored jacket design in an attempt to redefine the concept of a “well-tailored jacket”.

This hands-on presentation taught the essentials of sashiko <b>pattern</b> <b>drafting</b> and stitching to facilitate an experiential understanding of geometry and subdivision of the stitched plane. Each participant received a threaded needle and a fabric square prepared with a grid, the underlying structure for all traditional sashiko patterns. I guided the participants {{through the process of}} sewing and drawing stitches through the grid in the efficient sequence of parallel lines. A selection of traditional patterns that have the stitching orders and subdivisions identified was provided in the materials insert provided in the symposium packet.

Sashiko is running-stitch embroidery and a quilting technique sewn with white thread into indigo dyed fabric, and is characteristically identified by complex geometric patterns. Who sewed sashiko? When and where was it done? Sashiko was developed and practiced by the farmers of Northern Japan. It flourished during the last feudal era of Japan under the Tokugawa Shogunate between 1615 - 1868, because the ruling classes retained the rights to silk, cotton and wool: the warm and durable fabrics.

40|$|A global {{organisation}} {{of fashion}} schools hold this annual conference {{dedicated to the}} advancement of education, research and development in fashion design, technology, business and related industries. My research is in producing robust 2 -D pattern profiles that can be passed onto the 3 -D virtual environment. My new approach to custom fit uses different <b>pattern</b> <b>drafting</b> coordinates cooperating with fabric stretch characteristics, conforming to the shape of a person, using a personally extended set of traditional measurements. The research hypothesis argued that adapting traditional garment pattern coordinates for stretch fabric is not an appropriate starting point for developing a custom-fit stretch pattern. I posit that when a traditional pattern is adapted the profile becomes increasingly distorted as the fabric is incrementally stretched around the body contours. It is the inconsistent garment-to-body fit, relationship within the conventional pattern profile geometry, combined with arbitrary fabric stretch factors, that ultimately undermines the fit potential of custom-fit stretch garments. To contextualise and develop the theory. First garment fit was defined using the anatomical terms 'distal' and 'proximal', which I have adopted to describe the proximity of the garment to the body. The aetiology of traditional methods of pattern design was outlined then how patterns are adapted for stretch fabric. It was highlighted how little objective information on stretch fabrics parameters for pattern construction is available, and how current garment-sizing systems do not accommodate variations in bodyshapes. The development of virtual technology to date, and whether the garment offering was a true custom fit or just a coincidental fit, was questioned. I then illustrated my research method to objectively analyse and evaluate the stretch garment-to-body fit relationship by applying a 25 mm grid on a bodysuit. A video clip of a dancer demonstrated the bodysuit fit and how the stretch fabric did not become displaced during movement...|$|R
40|$|In the garment-production process, reverse {{engineering}} the 3 -D designed garment pattern {{in a virtual}} realm, into the 2 -D pattern pieces, is problematic. My area of research is in producing robust 2 -D pattern profiles that can be passed onto the 3 -D virtual environment. I have developed {{a different approach to}} custom-fit garment pattern design, based on new <b>pattern</b> <b>drafting</b> coordinates cooperating with fabric stretch characteristics, conforming to the shape of a person, using a personally extended set of traditional measurements. Currently, assessing fabric stretch extension for pattern construction is dependent on subjective expertise. Industry standards use laboratory- based electronic testing instruments for the climatically controlled measurement of tensile characteristics of cut samples, but these are for QA/QC, which is inappropriate for pattern construction. The aim was to develop a simple qualitative and quantitative procedure for objectively measuring, recording and specifying fabric characteristics that can be implemented for pattern design. The method used to determine the specific force/load involved laboratory pre-test conditioning of sample fabrics in differing weights and percentages of elastane, which were then subject to electronic tensile testing. Having established a force/load working range, a hanger/load test method was devised and used {{in the development of a}} new approach to stretch pattern design. The invention is a compact, portable testing instrument that measures the degree of extension of planar materials having a low modulus of elasticity, such as stretch fabrics containing elastane. The unique feature of the invention is the fabric clamping arrangement. The measurement procedure need not be subject to laboratory conditions. Measurements can be taken on a portion of fabric that may form part of a roll of fabric, a made-up garment or a cut sample. The hand-held device for quantifying fabric stretch extension can be used in haptic practices or inputted into a CAD system...|$|R
