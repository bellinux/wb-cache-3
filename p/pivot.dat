This question has attracted considerable attention, {{with the evidence}} now favoring a northern <b>pivot.</b> A key piece of evidence is that the Crescent Formation is laid over sediments (the Blue Mountain unit) derived from the continent, including boulders of quartz diorite some 65 million years old; this requires the Crescent Formation to have formed close to the continent.|$|E

40|$|AbstractGaussian {{elimination}} {{is among}} the most widely used tools in scientific computing. Gaussian elimination with partial <b>pivoting</b> requires only O(n 2) comparisons beyond the work required in Gaussian elimination with no <b>pivoting</b> but can, in principle, have error growth that is exponential in the matrix size n. Gaussian elimination with complete <b>pivoting,</b> on the other hand, cannot have exponential error growth but requires O(n 3) comparisons beyond the work required by Gaussian elimination with no <b>pivoting.</b> Numerical experiments suggest that Gaussian elimination with rook <b>pivoting</b> is between partial <b>pivoting</b> and complete <b>pivoting</b> in terms of efficiency and accuracy. In this paper we prove that rook <b>pivoting</b> cannot have exponential error growth. We also introduce a combination of partial <b>pivoting</b> and rock <b>pivoting</b> which we call Gaussian elimination with partial rook <b>pivoting</b> and we prove the partial rook <b>pivoting</b> cannot have exponential error growth. We include numerical experiments showing that on a serial computer the run times for cook <b>pivoting</b> are almost always close to those of partial <b>pivoting</b> and the run times for partial rook <b>pivoting</b> appear to be the same as those of partial <b>pivoting...</b>|$|R

Some new <b>pivoting</b> strategies, intermediate between partial <b>pivoting</b> and rook <b>pivoting,</b> are introduced. For random matrices, an approximation {{of the average}} normalized growth factor associated with several <b>pivoting</b> strategies is computed and analyzed. A stationary behavior of the expected growth factors of the new <b>pivoting</b> strategies is observed. Bounds for the growth factors of these <b>pivoting</b> strategies are provided.

However, information on sex differences in proprioceptive acuity under weight-bearing and leg neuromuscular control in <b>pivoting</b> is scarce. The objective {{of this study was}} to investigate sex differences in <b>pivoting</b> neuromuscular control during strenuous stepping tasks and proprioceptive acuity under weight-bearing. 21 male and 22 female subjects were recruited to evaluate <b>pivoting</b> proprioceptive acuity under weight-bearing, and <b>pivoting</b> neuromuscular control (in terms of leg <b>pivoting</b> instability, stiffness, maximum internal and external <b>pivoting</b> angles, and entropy of time-to-peak EMG in lower limb muscles) during strenuous stepping tasks performed on a novel offaxis elliptical trainer. Compared to males, females had significantly lower proprioceptive acuity under weight-bearing in both internal and external <b>pivoting</b> directions, higher <b>pivoting</b> instability, larger maximum internal <b>pivoting</b> angle, lower leg <b>pivoting</b> stiffness, and higher entropy of time-to-peak EMG in the gastrocnemius muscles during strenuous stepping tasks with internal and external <b>pivoting</b> perturbations. Results of this study may help us better understand factors contributing to ACL injuries in females and males, develop training strategies to improve <b>pivoting</b> neuromuscular control and proprioceptive acuity, and potentially reduce ACL and lower-limb musculoskeletal injuriesclose 0...|$|R
40|$|Rook <b>pivoting</b> is a {{relatively}} new <b>pivoting</b> strategy used in Gaussian elimination (GE). It can be as computationally cheap as partial <b>pivoting</b> and as stable as complete <b>pivoting.</b> This paper shows some new attractive features of rook <b>pivoting.</b> We first derive error bounds for the LU factors computed by GE and show rook <b>pivoting</b> usually gives a highly accurate U factor. Then we show accuracy of the computed solution of a linear system by rook <b>pivoting</b> is essentially independent of row scaling of the coefficient matrix. Thus if the matrix is ill-conditioned due to bad row scaling a highly accurate solution can usually be obtained. Finally for a typical inversion method involving the LU factorization we show rook <b>pivoting</b> usually makes both left and right residuals for the computed inverse of a matrix small...|$|R

5|$|Soubise and Saxe-Hildburghausen {{ignored the}} {{confusion}} {{as their own}} troops struggled in the wheeling <b>pivot.</b> From their vantage point, it appeared to the Allied commanders that the Prussians were moving eastward; Soubise and Saxe-Hildburghausen presumed that the Prussians were about to retreat {{in order to avoid}} being taken in their flank and rear. The Allied generals hurried the march, sending on the leading (right wing) cavalry towards Reichardtswerben. They also called up part of the left wing cavalry from the tail of the column and even the flank guard cavalry to take part in what they presumed would be the general chase. Any semblance of the wheeling <b>pivot</b> was lost in these fresh maneuvers, and the remaining columns lost all cohesion and order.|$|E

40|$|Tridiagonal solvers are {{important}} {{building blocks for}} a wide range of scientific applications that are commonly performance-sensitive.

40|$|Background: Currently, a {{suitable}} and reliable noninvasive method to evaluate rotational stability in vivo in anterior cruciate ligament-deficient knees, particularly during sports movements, does not exist. We speculated {{that if there}} is a rotational instability, the patient would avoid reaching a high <b>pivoting</b> moment during <b>pivoting</b> activities as a defense mechanism, and that the ground reaction moment, as registered by dynamometric platforms, would be reduced. On the basis of this hypothesis, we developed a study using kinetic analysis to evaluate rotational stability under dynamic loading. Methods: Thirty recreationally active athletes, including fifteen healthy subjects and fifteen with an anterior cruciate ligament-deficient knee, were recruited for this study. Patients performed jumping with <b>pivoting</b> with internal tibial rotation and external tibial rotation on the dynamometric platform with both the healthy and the injured limb. The quantitative results were graphically plotted, and the following parameters were evaluated: loading moment, <b>pivoting</b> moment, torque amplitude, loading slope, <b>pivoting</b> slope, percentage of <b>pivoting</b> with load, loading impulse, <b>pivoting</b> impulse, and maxi-mum body rotation angle. Results: There were no significant differences between the dominant and nondominant knees in the control group during the jumping with <b>pivoting</b> and external tibial rotation test with regard to the pivotingmoment (p = 0. 805), <b>pivoting</b> slope (p= 0. 716), <b>pivoting</b> impulse 2 (p = 0. 858), and <b>pivoting</b> impulse 3 (p = 0. 873).

At first, the columns retained regulation distance, wheeling eastward toward Zeuchfeld, but then part of the reserve infantry moved between the two main columns, hampering the movements of the reserve artillery.

5|$|A {{feature of}} the wing, which contributed greatly to its success, was an {{innovative}} spar boom design, made up of five square tubes that fitted into each other.

The undercarriage legs were attached to <b>pivot</b> points built into the inner, rear section of the main spar and retracted outwards and slightly backwards into wells in the non-load-carrying wing structure. The resultant narrow undercarriage track was considered to be an acceptable compromise as this reduced the bending loads on the main-spar during landing.|$|E
