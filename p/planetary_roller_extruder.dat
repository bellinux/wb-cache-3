50|$|The {{three main}} {{elements}} of a typical <b>planetary</b> <b>roller</b> screw are the screw shaft, nut and <b>planetary</b> <b>roller.</b> The screw, a shaft with a multi-start V-shaped thread, provides a helical raceway for multiple rollers radially arrayed around the screw and encapsulated by a threaded nut. The thread of the screw is typically identical to the internal thread of the nut. The rollers spin in contact with, and serve as low-friction transmission elements between screw and nut. The rollers typically have a single-start thread with convex flanks that limit friction at the rollers' contacts with screw and nut. The rollers typically orbit the screw as they spin (in the manner of planet gears to sun gear), and are thus known as <b>planetary,</b> or satellite, <b>rollers.</b> As with a lead screw or ball screw, rotation of the nut results in screw travel, and rotation of the screw results in nut travel.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. A {{cylindrical}} <b>roller</b> <b>planetary</b> {{traction drive}} was developed. It comprises a sun <b>roller,</b> three <b>planetary</b> <b>rollers,</b> an outer ring, a stationary carrier and an input shaft. The sun roller is hollow, and is connected through three logarithmic spiral profiles to the input shaft. As the input shaft rotates {{relative to the}} sun roller, a wedging action takes place between the input shaft and the sun roller; this makes the sun roller generate {{a certain amount of}} elastic deformation, so an appreciable amount of contact load is generated between the sun <b>roller</b> and the <b>planetary</b> <b>roller.</b> The greater the input torque is, the stronger the strength of the wedging action and the greater the contact load, and vice versa; so this configuration is self-actuating. Here, as cylindrical rollers are used in the planetary traction-drive configuration, the spin motion as would present in the case that the tapered rollers were used will not occur. Meanwhile, as a logarithmic spiral is used in the profile connection, the distribution of contact stress between the two connected surfaces will be uniform. This reduces the concentration of contact stress of the connected surfaces, and prolongs the life of the contact fatigue of the contacting surfaces...|$|R

A {{function of the}} planetary gears is to synchronize an operation of rollers {{in order to avoid}} axial displacements. A condition of the correct operation is no axial movement of rollers in relation to the nut. The planetary gears are integral parts of rollers and therefore an operation of the gear transmissions has a direct impact on cooperation of the screw, rollers and the nut. The proper design of gear engagements is essential for reducing slippage on surfaces of the cooperating threaded elements. For this purpose, in a designing method, both the limitations of operation and kinematic conditions of rollers’ operation have to be taken into account...|$|R

40|$|Two {{differential}} (dual input, single output) drives (a roller-gear and a pure roller), and {{a momentum}} balanced (single input, dual output) drive (pure roller) were designed, fabricated, and tested. The differential drives are each rated at 295 rad/sec (2800 rpm) input speed, 450 N-m (4, 000 in-lbf) output torque. The momentum balanced drive is rated at 302 rad/sec (2880 rpm) input speed, and dual output torques of 434 N-m (3840 in-lbf). The Dual Input Differential Roller-Gear Drive (DC- 700) has a planetary roller-gear {{system with a}} reduction ratio (one input driving the output with the second input fixed) of 29. 23 : 1. The Dual Input Differential Roller Drive (DC- 500) has a <b>planetary</b> <b>roller</b> system with a reduction ratio of approximately 24 : 1. Each of the differential drives features dual roller-gear or roller arrangements consisting of a sun, four first row planets, four second row planets, and a ring. The Momentum Balanced (Grounded Ring) Drive (DC- 400) has a <b>planetary</b> <b>roller</b> system with a reduction ratio of 24 : 1 with both outputs counterrotating at equal speed. Its single roller cluster consists of a sun, five first and five second row planets, a roller cage or spider and a ring. Outputs are taken from both the roller cage and the ring which counterrotate. Test results reported for all three drives include angular and torque ripple (linearity and cogging), viscous and Coulomb friction, and forward and reverse power efficiency. Of the two differential drives, the Differential Roller Drive had better linearity and less cogging than did the Differential Roller-Gear Drive, but it had higher friction and lower efficiency (particularly at low power throughput levels). Use of full preloading rather than a variable preload system in the Differential Roller Drive assessed a heavy penalty in part load efficiency. Maximum measured efficiency (ratio of power out to power in) was 95 % for the Differential Roller-Gear Drive and 86 % for the Differential Roller Drive. The Momentum Balanced (Grounded Ring) Drive performed as expected kinematically. Reduction r-atios to the two counterrotating outputs (design nominal= 24 : 1) were measured to be 23. 98 : 1 and 24. 12 : 1 at zero load [...] At 25 ONm (2200 in-lbf) output torque the ratio changed 2 % due to roller creep. This drive was the smoothest of all three as determined from linearity and cogging tests, and maximum measured efficiency (ratio of power out to power in) was 95 %. The disadvantages of full preloading as comvared to variable preload were apparent in this drive as in the Differential Roller Drive. Efficiencies at part load were low, but improved dramatically with increases in torque. These were consistent with friction measurements which indicated losses primarily from Coulomb friction. The initial preload level setting was low so roller slip was encountered at higher torques during testing...|$|R

40|$|Ball screw {{mechanisms}} (BSM) and <b>planetary</b> <b>roller</b> screw mechanisms (PRSM) {{belong to}} promising energy-saving mechanisms converting rotary motion into linear motion. To calculate and design these mechanisms the static and dynamic load capacities are used. In case a standard {{size of the}} mechanism to be designed is available in manufacturer’s catalog, the specified load capacities can be taken from the catalog, and if not, then the static load for the mechanism being designed can be calculated. To determine the dynamic load capacity, long-term and costly experimental studies are to be conducted. Therefore, the crucial task is to forecast the BSM and PRSM dynamic load capacity and, further, the service life of these mechanisms. As follows from the analysis of information provided in manufacturers’ catalogs, there were established correlative relationships of static and dynamic load capacities for BSM and PRSM with the parameters determining their standard sizes. Using these relationships and methods of power regression enable us to obtain empirical dependences linking the factor equal to the ratio of static load capacity to dynamic load capacity with parameters defining standard sizes of the mechanisms. To predict BSM and PRSM service lives the said ratio is calculated using the empirical dependence, static load capacity of the mechanism being designed is determined by means of calculation using known procedures, and then dynamic load capacity is determined as the quotient of static load capacity division by the said factor. Then, having determined the equivalent load acting on the mechanism being designed the service life value is predicted based on known procedures. The developed procedure for predicting dynamic load capacity and service life {{can be used for}} calculation of newly developed BSM and PRSM designs when determining reasonable parameters of these mechanisms and their parts.

40|$|<b>Planetary</b> <b>roller</b> drives (PRD) with axial {{backlash}} {{have the highest}} load capacity amongst the prospective roller drives. PRD consists of a screw and a nut, between which thread rolls are installed in separators, force calculation of which is sufficient to assess the PRD force loading. For several reasons, the load is unevenly distributed between the roll turns operating with the screw and nut turns. These include rollers size variation by the average diameter of their thread, PRD parts' thread manufacturing errors, primarily thread pitch errors, and other reasons. The article discusses one of them – a special feature of thread roll loading. If we neglect the circumferential forces due to their smallness, then the roll's turns mating with the nut along one of the roll's generatrices and the roll turns mating with the screw along the opposite generatrix will be loaded with axial and radial forces. Since the PRD parts thread turn flank angle is symmetrical and equal to 90 °, then the radial force {{is equal to the}} axial one on each turn. If we sum the axial forces on the mating roll turns along one of the generatrices, then from the equation of equilibrium one gets that the sum vector value is equal to the sum vector value along the other roll generatrix. Here the sum vectors will have the opposite direction, and the arm between them equals to the average roll thread diameter. Multiplying the sum vector modulus by that arm, one gets the roll overturning moment that does not depend on the distribution of the axial forces along the roll axis. This moment is the cause of uneven load distribution between the roll turns mating with the nut and the screw. The overturning moment can be balanced on the two forming roll generatrices only by radial forces, distribution of which along the roll axis will be uneven. The PRD parts thread turns load distribution irregularity factor is introduced as the ratio of the maximum force acting on the most loaded roll turn to a nominal force. It is determined in the example that the value of this factor is equal to 1. 454 or 45. 4 %, i. e. the influence of the PRD roll loading characteristics on the drive threaded parts turns loading irregularity is strong...|$|R

40|$|Experimental Advanced Superconducting Tokamak (EAST) is the world's first fully {{superconducting tokamak}} with a non-circular cross-section. In recent years, with {{increased}} device performance and experimental parameters, EAST {{has achieved a}} series of important research results and scientific discoveries. However, EAST inner components of the first wall will also be facing an increasingly tough operating environment with higher heat loads. Although plasma facing components (PFCs) have been updated and upgraded several times, the high heat flux during experiments will cause damage or even failure to local small parts in the EAST vacuum vessel (VV). Any failure of the internal components might influence the obtaining of high-quality plasma or even lead to a plasma discharge and cause safety problems of the operation device. Therefore, {{it is essential to}} have timely maintenance based on the condition of damaged internal components in the experimental period. In conventional manual maintenance, even if small sign of damage is seen, the device has to be shut down, which seriously affects the efficiency of physical experiments, and increases the time and economic costs. Therefore, to ensure adequate running time, the demand for remote handling maintenance of the EAST device during physical experiments is urgent. The EAST articulated maintenance arm (EAMA) system is developed for real-time detection and rapid repair operations to damaged internal components during plasma discharges without breaking the EAST ultra-high vacuum (UHV) condition. To achieve the desired objectives, the EAMA system design should guarantee that the robot can stably run in the harsh environments of high temperature (80 - 120 oC) and high vacuum (~ 10 - 5 Pa). Meanwhile, the errors caused by the deformation of long flexible robot arms should also be predicted and compensated in real-time to obtain high accurate maintenance operations. The main contributions of this dissertation include: design, development and analysis of the whole EAMA hardware system; study of two different methods of matrix structural analysis (MSA) and a back-propagation neural network (BPNN) to predict flexible deformations of a manipulator system; the eventual developing of an EAMA dynamic error compensation algorithm to precisely control the EAMA system operation. Firstly, during the EAST experiments, environment conditions inside the vacuum vessel were very harsh with complex geometry; from the design view, the requirements for an EAMA robot were more critical than those for a conventional industrial robot arm. Beyond the conventional techniques in robot design, many unique techniques were considered in the EAMA manipulator arm design: (1) Redundant articulated configuration with modular techniques were utilized in robot arm design; (2) All joint actuators and high-speed transmission components were set up in a sealed box, using a <b>planetary</b> <b>roller</b> screw to change rotation into linear motion, which was transferred outside by the bellows; (3) Solid lubrication using MoS 2 -Ti-C composite coatings were developed for the low-speed transmission parts exposed to the vacuum environment; (4) A parallelogram link mechanism was developed to provide more than 50, 000 times of reduction ratio and more than 1000 Nm of drive torque. Secondly, as the total length of the EAMA system reaches more than 10 m, it will produce significant flexible deformation under the effects of torques and gravity. The deformation values will always be constantly changing as the arm movements and postures change. If this flexibility could not be accurately predicted and reasonably compensated, it would seriously affect the position accuracy of the manipulator system. Based on the rigid-body dynamic model, the prediction models of flexible arm deflections have been established using two different methods: a stiffness matrix method based on matrix structural analysis (MSA) theory and a forecasting by BP neural network method based on real experimental data. The prediction accuracy, pros and cons of the two methods were compared. Both methods have good real-time, which can provide the basis for achieving precise control. Finally, considering manipulator kinematics and trajectory planning, an algorithm for dynamic error compensation of the EAMA manipulator has been developed according to the existing deformation prediction model and calculation results. The related feedback control codes were programed to compensate the dynamic errors of end-effector in any positions or postures of the manipulator system in real-time. Therefore, sufficiently high control accuracy for successful completion of the relevant remote operation and maintenance tasks can be achieved for the EAMA robot system...|$|R
