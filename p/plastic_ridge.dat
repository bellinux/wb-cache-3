Such a zipper is easier to open and close than a clipped version, and the slider has a gap above the zipper teeth for separating the ridge seal. This seal is structurally weak against internal pressure, and can be separated by pressure within the sealed container pushing outward on the ridges, which simply flex and spread apart, potentially allowing air or liquid entry through the spread-open ridges. Ridge-sealed zippers are sometimes used on lower-cost surface dry suits.|$|E

40|$|The {{abrasion}} {{behavior of}} high manganese steel is investigated under {{three levels of}} impact energy in acid-ironstone slurry. The wear test {{was carried out by}} an MLDF- 10 tester with impact energy of 0. 7 [*]J, 1. 2 [*]J, and 1. 7 [*]J. The impact abrasion property of high manganese steel in corrosive condition was compared according to the wear mass loss curves. The wear mechanism was analysed by the SEM analysis of the worn surface and the optical metallographic analysis of the vertical section to the wear surface. The results show that the impact energy has a great effect on the impact corrosion and abrasion properties of it. Its abrasion mechanism in corrosive condition is mainly microplough and breakage of <b>plastic</b> deformed <b>ridges</b> and wedges under the impact energy of 0. 7 [*]J.

40|$|Information on {{availability}} of the test {{can be obtained by}} contact-ing Dr. Carey. The ability to discriminate differences in tactile stimuli, such as textures, is commonly and characteristically impaired after stroke. Assessment of tactile discrimination is cur-rently compromised by measures that are not quantitative and standardized, do not as-sess active touch sensibility, or are not suitable for use in clinical settings with stroke patients. Therefore, a test that addressed these limitations was developed. The Tac-tile Discrimination Test required subjects to discriminate differences in finely graded <b>plastic</b> <b>ridged</b> surfaces using a three-alternative forced choice design. Test-retest reli-ability, based on a sample of 35 stroke patients, was high (r = 0. 92), and changes of the magnitude of 27 percent spatial increase (PSI) can be detected with 95 percent confidence, which is sufficiently accurate for clinical monitoring. A matched pairs study of 50 stroke and 50 unimpaired subjects found that normal performance scores were contained within the 3 - 46 PSI range. The conservative criterion of abnormal-ity was defined as 46 PSI, with a zone of uncertainty from 31 to 61 PSI. The test dif...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} the Daily based Morgan–Morgan–Finney model. The main {{processes}} {{in this model}} {{are based on the}} Morgan–Morgan–Finney soil erosion model, and it is suitable for estimating surface runoff and sediment redistribution patterns in seasonal climate regions with complex surface configurations. We achieved temporal flexibility by utilizing daily time steps, which is suitable for regions with concentrated seasonal rainfall. We introduce the proportion of impervious surface cover as a parameter to reflect its impacts on soil erosion through blocking water infiltration and protecting the soil from detachment. Also, several equations and sequences of sub-processes are modified from the previous model to better represent physical processes. From the sensitivity analysis using the Sobol’ method, the DMMF model shows the rational response to the input parameters which is consistent with the result from the previous versions. To evaluate the model performance, we applied the model to two potato fields in South Korea that had complex surface configurations using <b>plastic</b> covered <b>ridges</b> at various temporal periods during the monsoon season. Our new model shows acceptable performance for runoff and the sediment loss estimation (NSE ≥ 0. 63, | PBIAS | ≤ 17. 00, and RSR ≤ 0. 57).

40|$|In China, the ridge-furrow water {{conservation}} planting (RC) system is advantageous for improving crop yields and rainwater use efficiency. In RC planting system, <b>plastic</b> film-mulched <b>ridges</b> are employed for water harvesting while the furrows serve as infiltration and planting belts. To optimize the RC {{system and to}} overcome problems {{due to the lack}} of water in semi-humid areas at risk of drought, we mulched the furrows with 8 % biodegradable film (RCSB), liquid film (RCSL), or no mulching in the furrows (RCSN), while conventional flat planting (CF) was employed as the control. After 4 year (2007 – 2010) consecutive field study, the results showed that the soil water storage level in the 0 – 100 cm layer with four treatments was ranked as follow: RCSB > RCSL > RCSN > CF, while the RCSB and RCSL were 26. 3 and 12. 2 mm greater than RCSN, respectively. Compared with CF, the average soil temperature was significantly (P < 0. 05) higher by 3. 1, 1. 7, and 1. 5 °C under the RC planting treatments (RCSB, RCSL, and RCSN) during each year, respectively. The average ET rate of RC treatments were all lower than CF in each experimental year, and the average decreased by 8. 0 % (P < 0. 05). The average yields with RCSB, RCSL, and RCSN increased by 2, 665, 1, 444, and 1, 235 kg ha− 1, respectively, and the water use efficiency (WUE) increased by 51. 6, 25. 6, and 21. 1 %, compared with CF. RCSB obtained the highest economic benefit, the average net income was higher than CF by 4, 020 Yuan ha− 1.

40|$|The thesis {{addresses}} selected {{problems related}} to localized deformation of the solid Earth’s lithosphere that stem from non-uniform strengths or emerge from non-linear rheologies. A new code has been developed to model the spontaneous localization through strain-weakening plasticity. A code coupling technique is introduced {{as an attempt to}} efficiently solve multi-material and multi-physics problems like crust-mantle interactions. We first address a problem of localized deformation that is caused by pre-existing heterogeneities. Specifically, the effects of laterally varying viscous strength on the Cenozoic extension of the northern Basin and Range are investigated using numerical models. Three-dimensional viscous flow models with imposed plate motions and localized zones of low viscosity show that strain rates are concentrated in weak zones with adjacent blocks experiencing little deformation. This result can explain the geodetically discovered concentrated strain {{in the eastern part of}} the northern Basin and Range as the high strains are a response to far field plate motions within a locally less viscous mantle. The low viscosity of mantle is consistent with the low seismic velocities in the region. As an instance of spontaneously emergent localized deformations, brittle deformations in oceanic lithosphere are investigated next. We developed a Lagrangian finite difference code, SNAC, to investigate this class of problems. Brittle deformations are modeled as localized plastic strain. The detailed algorithm of SNAC is presented in Appendix A. The spacing of fracture zones in oceanic lithosphere is numerically explored. Numerical models represent a ridge-parallel cross-section of young oceanic lithosphere. An elasto-visco-plastic rheology can induce brittle deformation or creep according to the local temperature. The spacing of localized plastic zones, corresponding to fracture zones, decreases as crustal thickness increases. The stronger creep strength raises the threshold value of crustal thickness: If the crust is thinner than the threshold, the brittle deformation can evolve into primary cracks. Plastic flow rules are parametrized by the dilation angle. If the dilatational deformation is allowed in the plastic flow rules (dilation angle> 0 °), the primary cracks tend to be vertical; otherwise, a pair of primary cracks form a graben. The modeling results are compatible with the correlation between crustal thickness and the spacing of fracture zones found in different regions such as the Reykjanes ridge and the Australian Antarctic Discordance. Three-dimensional (3 D) numerical models are used to find the mechanics responsible for the various patterns made by the segments of the mid-ocean ridges and the structures connecting them. The models are initially loaded with thermal stresses due to the cooling of oceanic lithosphere and prescribed plate motions. The two driving forces are comparable in magnitude and the thermal stresses can exert ridge-parallel forces when selectively released by ridges and ridge-parallel structure. Represented by localized <b>plastic</b> strain, <b>ridge</b> segments interact in two different modes as they propagate towards each other: An overlapping mode where ridge segments overlap and bend toward each other and a connecting mode where two ridge segments are connected by a transform-like fault. As the ratio of thermal stress to spreading-induced stress (γ) increases, the patterns of localized plastic strain change from the overlapping to connecting mode. Rate effects are taken into account by the spreading rate normalized by a reference-cooling rate (Pe′) and the ratio of thermal stress to the reference spreading-induced stresses (γ′). The stability fields of the two modes are unambiguously defined by Pe′ paired with γ'. Crust and mantle are distinct in terms of composition and rheology. To study the combined response of crust and mantle, it is necessary to solve multi-material and multi-physics problems that are numerically challenging. As an efficient way of solving such a problem, we introduce a code coupling technique. We adapt Pyre, a framework allowing distinct codes to exchange variables through shared interfaces, to the coupling of SNAC, a Lagrangian code for lithospheric dynamics, and CitcomS, an Eulerian code for mantle convection. The continuity of velocities and tractions and no-slip conditions are imposed on the interfaces. The benchmarks against analytic solutions to the bending of a thin plate verifies that SNAC gives an accurate solution for the given traction boundary condition. It is also shown that Pyre can correctly handle the data exchanges at the interfaces. In a preliminary high-resolution model, an elasto-visco-plastic lithosphere is coupled to a Newtonian viscous mantle. This coupled model shows a steady growth of dome in the lithosphere directly above a hot sphere placed in the mantle. However, the two coupled codes incur unnecessarily high numerical costs because they use different methods for time integration. </p...|$|R
