40|$|A {{transport}} using {{at least}} two means of transport is called a combined transport (CT). A traditional road/rail combined transport contains a pick up service with a short road haulage at the <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>dispatch,</b> transhipment to a rail wagon, long dis¬tance rail haulage, another transhipment and a delivery road haulage. On July 1, 1992, the business unit for CT of Swedish State Railways (SJ), SJ Kombi, was changed into a limited company. The new company, Rail Combi AB, is principal of all Swedish CT terminals and has also a monopoly of selling domestic CT services to hauliers and forwarders. Approximately 1 000 wagons for combined transport are handled daily at the Swedish terminals. About 20 % refer to international transport. Rail Combi takes a central point in this paper. The purpose of the paper is to describe the Swedish production system for domestic combined transport. The current situation as well as development plans are de¬scribed. The outline is made along three descriptive factors; activities, resources and actors...|$|E
40|$|Technological {{innovations}} {{have significantly}} caused an unprecedented {{shift from the}} orthodox paper-based approach to a continuum of internet transactions. Technology redefined the status quo of traditional markets and resulted {{in the international community}} and territorial boundaries merging into one population of cyber citizens in the electronic commerce sphere. These new paradigms give rise to legal challenges which are precipitated by legal aspects of electronic commerce necessitating for the legal regulation. The 1996 United Nations Commission on International Trade Law on Electronic Commerce is a global legal framework for legislators. It seeks to address these issues by transposing common law requirements for validly concluded traditional contracts into cyber contracts in order to accord cyber contracts the same legal standing through functional equivalence approach. The Lesotho jurisdiction envisions to embrace this development through the envisaged Lesotho Electronic Transactions and Electronic Commerce Bill 2013. This study is the juxtaposition of the Lesotho Bill and the South Africa s Electronic Communications and Transactions Act 25 of 2002 on electronic transactions provisions covering the legal recognition of electronic messages, time of contract formation, time and <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>dispatch</b> and receipt of communication, and the in writing and signature requirements which are applied in online contracts {{in order to meet the}} similar common law contract demands for paper based contracts. The interrogation should indicate whether there are any challenges occasioned by the Bill in electronic contracting, and the recommended solutions, considering lessons learned from the South Africa s ECT Act, and compliance with the best international practices.

For instance, e-commerce law of Malaysia has been enacted many years back through different statutes. This study examines the adequacy of the Electronic Commerce Act of Malaysia as a case study to find out whether the present laws are comprehensive enough to support the new technologies, legal and commercial demands. For this purpose, the principles governing the formation of e-contract are analyzed and compared with international instruments. The analytical approach through comparative legal study is selected for the research methodology. The results indicates that there are some silence features and lacuna under e-commerce Act of Malaysia.

30|$|The study <b>of</b> {{economic}} <b>dispatch</b> {{dates back}} to the 1920 s. The spatial and temporal distribution variation of load demand is the prime cause <b>of</b> economic <b>dispatch.</b> The goal <b>of</b> <b>dispatch</b> is the advanced decision-making for base-point generations of units and configuration of spinning reserves based on load forecast. From classical economic dispatch centering on the concepts of incremental cost, incremental loss and hydro-coal conversion equivalent in the mid and late of 1950 s [1], to the optimal power flow considering network security in the 1960 s [2], thence to the theories <b>of</b> <b>dispatch</b> and control which emphasizing the coordination <b>of</b> <b>dispatch</b> and automatic generation control (AGC) in the 1980 s [3, 4], the study <b>of</b> economic <b>dispatch</b> has been relatively mature in theory and practice.|$|R

In both of mentioned novels we can find a resemblance with Kalif's world, based on using the alter ego's world. An alter ego is a second self, a second personality or persona within a person, who is often oblivious to the persona's actions. It was coined {{in the early nineteenth century}} when dissociative identity disorder was first described by psychologists. A person with an alter ego is said to lead a double life. It is more than evident that Mihaly Babits was impressed with Sigmund Freud's new theory about dream interpretations. So that is why I am including [...] ...|$|R

40|$|A {{model has}} been {{developed}} and solved which captures {{the essence of the}} concept <b>of</b> mobile <b>dispatch</b> service. There are two types <b>of</b> users, <b>dispatch</b> and interconnect (calls routed from the public switched telephone network, of much longer holding times). Also, only some of the available repeaters can be used for interconnect traffic, and blocked interconnect calls are cleared. Dispatch calls, however, can access all repeaters, and then are queued if all repeaters are busy. One design decision involves a trade between blocking of interconnect calls and queueing <b>of</b> <b>dispatch</b> calls. A formula has been derived for both interconnect blocking probability and the mean dispatch queueing time to permit this trade. The results indicate that a good operating point is to have (N - a_d) (rounded down) interconnected repeaters, where there are N total repeaters and a_d Erlangs <b>of</b> <b>dispatch</b> traffic...|$|R
