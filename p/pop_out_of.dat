5|$|A {{specialist}} {{was hired}} to enhance the game's artificial intelligence and give enemies more lifelike behaviour. In previous Tomb Raider games, enemies would simply run at Lara and attack immediately, whereas in Tomb Raider III, enemies can <b>pop</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the dark and attack the player, or retreat back into the level and regroup to attack later. A stealth element partially inspired by Rare's 1997 hit GoldenEye 007 was also introduced, giving players the option of sneaking around and avoid detection. New vehicles that are critical to complete certain levels were added; the team also experimented {{with the idea of}} putting Lara on horseback, but they ultimately discarded it. The development of the game took eleven months to complete, and incorporating all the new ideas into the engine was considered the most difficult task of the project.|$|E
25|$|Hawking {{radiation}} {{is required by}} the Unruh effect and the equivalence principle applied to black hole horizons. Close to the event horizon of a black hole, a local observer must accelerate to keep from falling in. An accelerating observer sees a thermal bath of particles that <b>pop</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the local acceleration horizon, turn around, and free-fall back in. The condition of local thermal equilibrium implies that the consistent extension of this local thermal bath has a finite temperature at infinity, which implies {{that some of these}} particles emitted by the horizon are not reabsorbed and become outgoing Hawking radiation.|$|E

25|$|There are a {{large number}} of rules {{regarding}} the specifics of what can and cannot be done during a scrum. This is mainly for safety reasons, because if a scrum is not conducted properly there is a greater chance of injury. Much of the rules regard behaviour of the front row. Front rowers must engage square on, rather than bore in on an angle. The tight-head prop doing this limits the movement of the opposing hooker. As well, a loose-head prop pushing into the opposition tight-head prop's chest causing their body to <b>pop</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the scrum. Both infringements are punished with penalties. Front-rowers are also banned from twisting their bodies, pulling opponents, or doing anything that might collapse the scrum. They must not push an opponent in the air. Finally, the back row must remain bound until the ball has left the scrum. For flankers, this means keeping one arm, up to the shoulder, in contact with the scrum. The no. 8 must have both hands touching the scrum until the scrum has ended.|$|E

500|$|In {{addition}} to trying {{different types of}} ordnance, the Allied Air Forces experimented with modifications to the aircraft themselves. Major Paul I. [...] "Pappy" [...] Gunn modified some USAAF Douglas A-20 Havoc light bombers by installing four [...] machine guns in their noses, and two [...] fuel tanks were added to give the aircraft more range. This was successful, and an attempt was then made to create a longer range attack aircraft by {{doing the same thing}} to a B-25 Mitchell medium bomber, to operate as a [...] "commerce destroyer". This proved to be somewhat more difficult. The resulting aircraft was obviously nose heavy despite adding lead ballast to the tail, and the vibrations caused by firing the machine guns were enough to make rivets <b>pop</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the skin of the aircraft. The tail guns and belly turrets were removed, the latter being of little use if the aircraft was flying low.|$|E

500|$|Neil McCormick of The Daily Telegraph {{felt it was}} [...] "a great opening track" [...] for Beyoncé and lauded its [...] "anthemic" [...] chorus. Mesfin Fekadu of the Associated Press {{deemed the}} song [...] "a supreme way" [...] to open the album. musicOMH's Philip Matusavage wrote that [...] "Pretty Hurts" [...] {{manifested}} Beyoncé as a [...] "definitive personal statement rather than just another Beyoncé album". The Guardian reviewer Michael Cragg listed the track as an [...] "immediate" [...] single choice on the album. Julia Leconte of Now opined that the song was [...] "classic Beyoncé feminism" [...] and quipped, [...] "and if you're a sucker for girl-power hits like 'Irreplaceable', you'll have this one on repeat, too". While Claire Lobenfield of Complex stated, [...] "What sounds like a classic Beyoncé female empowerment ballad cuts even deeper." [...] Tim Finney of the same publication deemed the song a [...] "heavy-handed future concert staple". Writing for the Los Angeles Times, Mikael Wood felt that with [...] "Pretty Hurts," [...] Beyoncé created [...] "razzle-dazzle <b>pop</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> small-scale sentiments that might've seemed on paper like fodder for hushed ballads". [...] Drowned in Sound writer Robert Leedham stated the track was [...] "impeccably sung".|$|E
500|$|Both Tales of Phantasia and Star Ocean {{stretched}} {{the power of}} the Super Famicom to its limits, with a total of 48 megabits of data. [...] Additionally, Star Ocean was also one of two games that used a special S-DD1 chip to aid in compression of almost all graphics and map data, meaning that it effectively stored even more data than Tales of Phantasia, though the compression lead to a lower audio quality. [...] The game also featured special technology called a [...] "Flexible Voice Driver" [...] that allowed for the compression of sound, allowing for voice clips for characters when in battles, another trait that was both very rare for a Super Famicom game, and shared with Tales of Phantasia. Different voice clips would be played depending on the scenario; if the characters were confronted by weak enemies, they may say something more confident, where as if confronted by strong enemies, they may say something more fearful or frantic. Mode 7 graphics were generated using software, and appear when items <b>pop</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> treasure chests; the need for extra tiles, however, limited the graphical effects implementation. The game also featured surround sound. Planning for a sequel began as soon as development was completed on Star Ocean. Feedback about weak boss monsters later lead to more challenging battles in Star Ocean 2.|$|E

500|$|Initially {{created by}} Victor Miller, Jason's final design was a {{combined}} effort by Miller, Ron Kurz, and Tom Savini. The name [...] "Jason" [...] {{is a combination}} of [...] "Josh" [...] and [...] "Ian", Miller's two sons, and [...] "Voorhees" [...] was inspired by a girl that Miller knew at high school whose last name was Van Voorhees. Miller felt it was a [...] "creepy-sounding name", which was perfect for his character. Miller initially wrote Jason as a normal-looking child, but the crew behind the film decided he needed to be deformed. Victor Miller explained Jason was not meant to be a creature from the [...] "Black Lagoon" [...] in his script, and scripted Jason as a mentally disabled young boy; it was Savini who made Jason deformed. Ron Kurz confirmed that Miller's version of Jason was that of a normal child, but claims that it was his idea to turn Jason into a [...] "mongoloid creature", and have him [...] "jump out of the lake {{at the end of the}} film". Miller later agreed the ending would not have been as good if he looked like [...] "Betsy Palmer at eight years old". Miller wrote a scene where Alice dreams she is attacked in a canoe by Jason, and then she wakes up in a hospital bed. Miller's intention was to get as close to Carries ending as possible. Savini believed having Jason <b>pop</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the lake would be psychologically disturbing to the audience, and since Alice is supposed to be dreaming, the crew could get away with adding anything they wanted.|$|E
500|$|... "Crash" [...] {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. In a review for The New York Times, Kelefa Sanneh {{noted that the}} track [...] "successfully conjure up the infectious spirit of early Madonna." [...] David Browne of Entertainment Weekly called the song [...] "a pricey retro fashion blurb" [...] on which Stefani appears as [...] "an old-school, gold-chained rapper". Krissi Murison of the NME disagreed, calling it one of [...] "the best bits of the decade of decadence" [...] and referring to it as [...] "Salt-N-Pepa's cartoon rap". Jason Shawhan of About.com stated that the song's [...] "great Narada Michael Walden bleepy synth noises [...] <b>pop</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the mix like the car stereo just decided to sing along", and Jennifer Nine of Yahoo! Music commented that the track had [...] "icy-cool schoolyard sass". Eric Greenwood of Drawer B argued that the track [...] "carelessly revisits Stefani's blatant fondness for 80's pop, but not even [...] Tony Kanal can save her from lifeless retreads like these." [...] The Washington Post reviewer Sean Daly compared it to Salt-n-Pepa's 1987 single [...] "Push It" [...] and added that Stefani [...] "pushes it real good". PopMatters's Jason Damas gave it a very strong review, stating that [...] "Stefani nails all the vocal mannerisms" [...] and that Kanal [...] "reveals a major mainstream pop jones here, especially {{in the way he}} layers the cut [...] with dozens of orchestra hits [...] which have been absent from almost all pop albums for a decade or more now." [...] Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine gave the song a mixed review, stating that it [...] "features some near-fatal car metaphors" [...] but that Stefani [...] "maintains her signature sass throughout".|$|E
500|$|During {{the writing}} process, Price and Seaman were unsure of whom to include as the villain in the plot. They wrote scripts that had either Jessica Rabbit or Baby Herman as the villain, {{but they made}} their final {{decision}} with newly created character Judge Doom. Doom {{was supposed to have}} an animated vulture sit on his shoulder, but this was deleted due to the technical challenges this posed. Doom would also have a suitcase of 12 small animated kangaroos that act as a jury, by having their joeys <b>pop</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> their pouches, each with letters, when put together would spell YOU ARE GUILTY. This was also cut for budget and technical reasons. Doom's five-man [...] "Weasel Gang" [...] (Stupid, Smart Ass, Greasy, Wheezy and Psycho) satirizes the Seven Dwarfs (Doc, Grumpy, Happy, Sleepy, Bashful, Sneezy and Dopey) who appeared in Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937). There were originally seven weasels to mimic the dwarf's complement, but eventually two of them, Slimey and Slezey, were written out of the script. Further references included The [...] "Ink and Paint Club" [...] resembling the Harlem Cotton Club, while Zemeckis compared Judge Doom's invention of [...] "The Dip" [...] to eliminate all the Toons as Hitler's Final Solution. Doom was originally the hunter who [...] killed Bambi's Mother, but Disney objected to the idea. Benny the Cab was first conceived to be a Volkswagen Beetle before being changed to a Taxicab. Ideas originally conceived for the story also included a sequence set at Marvin Acme's funeral, whose attendees included Eddie, Foghorn Leghorn, Mickey Mouse, Minnie Mouse, Tom and Jerry, Heckle and Jeckle, Chip n' Dale, Mighty Mouse, Superman, Popeye, Olive Oyl, Bluto, Clarabelle Cow, and The Seven Dwarfs in cameo appearances. However, the scene was cut for pacing reasons and never made it past the storyboard stage. Before finally agreeing on Who Framed Roger Rabbit as the film's title, working titles included Murder in Toontown, Toons, Dead Toons Don't Pay Bills, The Toontown Trial, Trouble in Toontown, and Eddie Goes to Toontown.|$|E

Only 15 popped out, leaving the antenna looking like a lop-sided, half-open umbrella. Investigators concluded that during the 4.5 years that Galileo spent in storage after the 1986 Challenger disaster, the lubricants between the tips of the ribs and the cup were eroded and worn away from vibration during three cross-country journeys by truck between California and Florida for the spacecraft. The failed ribs were those closest to the flat-bed trailers carrying Galileo on these trips, which were used instead of air transport to cut costs. [...] The antenna lubricants were not checked or replaced before launch.|$|E

2500|$|As a {{performance}} artist he enjoyed creating the costumes, and often shocking audiences. He first {{appeared at the}} Anthony D'Offay Gallery in London in 1988. In a signature performance, he would appear on stage in outlandish drag or other costume, looking very huge. He would sing and dance about. Then suddenly, much to the audience's surprise, he would drop onto his back and simulate giving birth to a petite and naked young woman, who was his friend and assistant Nicola Bateman. She had been hidden {{for the first part}} of the performance by being strapped to Leigh's belly with her face in his crotch. Then she would slip out of her harness, and appear to <b>pop</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> Bowery's belly along with a lot of stage blood and links of sausages, while Bowery wailed.

2500|$|Dynamic {{instability}} {{refers to}} the coexistence of assembly and disassembly {{at the ends of}} a microtubule. The microtubule can dynamically switch between growing and shrinking phases in this region. Tubulin dimers can bind two molecules of GTP, one of which can be hydrolyzed subsequent to assembly. [...] During polymerization, the tubulin dimers are in the GTP-bound state. [...] The GTP bound to α-tubulin is stable and it plays a structural function in this bound state. However, the GTP bound to β-tubulin may be hydrolyzed to GDP shortly after assembly. The assembly properties of GDP-tubulin are different from those of GTP-tubulin, as GDP-tubulin is more prone to depolymerization. A GDP-bound tubulin subunit at the tip of a microtubule will tend to fall off, although a GDP-bound tubulin {{in the middle of a}} microtubule cannot spontaneously <b>pop</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the polymer. [...] Since tubulin adds onto the end of the microtubule in the GTP-bound state, a cap of GTP-bound tubulin is proposed to exist at the tip of the microtubule, protecting it from disassembly. [...] When hydrolysis catches up to the tip of the microtubule, it begins a rapid depolymerization and shrinkage. This switch from growth to shrinking is called a catastrophe. [...] GTP-bound tubulin can begin adding to the tip of the microtubule again, providing a new cap and protecting the microtubule from shrinking. This is referred to as [...] "rescue".|$|E
