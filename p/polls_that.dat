5|$|In the 1995 college {{football}} season, teams {{were selected for}} the Sugar Bowl under the new Bowl Alliance system. The Bowl Alliance matched up the conference champions of the Big East, Southeastern Conference, Big 12 Conference, Atlantic Coast Conference, and two at-large teams in games to determine an official national champion. Prior {{to the introduction of}} the Bowl Alliance and its predecessor, the Bowl Coalition, national champions were determined by various {{college football}} <b>polls</b> <b>that</b> sometimes named different teams as champion.|$|E
5|$|In 1936, Shepard, Ominsky, and Finnerty {{were all}} reelected to the legislature. The {{following}} year, {{he was appointed}} to a commission charged with drafting a new city charter for Philadelphia, but the resulting document {{was rejected by the}} voters at the <b>polls</b> <b>that</b> November. He was not a candidate for reelection in 1938, but in 1940 he ran again and was elected along with Finnerty and Samuel Rose. After that term ended, President Franklin D. Roosevelt appointed Shepard recorder of deeds in Washington, D.C., a position he held until 1951. At that time, Shepard and Mary McLeod Bethune were the only two black people in government service in the nation's capital.|$|E

2500|$|A 2010 <b>poll</b> found <b>that</b> 61% {{of voters}} would choose a penalty {{other than the}} death {{sentence}} for murder. When persons surveyed are given a choice between {{the death penalty and}} life without parole for persons convicted of capital crimes, support for execution has traditionally been significantly lower than in <b>polling</b> <b>that</b> asks only if a person does or does not support the death penalty. In 2010, for instance, a Gallup <b>poll</b> <b>that</b> offered a choice showed 49% favoring the death penalty, and 46% favoring life imprisonment.|$|R

5|$|Ratajkowski {{has been}} {{frequently}} named in lists and <b>polls</b> <b>that</b> rank beauty or fashion in the media. She was ranked in Maxim Hot 100 list in both 2014 (No.62) and 2015 (No.2). AskMen ranked her among its most desirable women of 2014 (No.3) and 2016 (No.14); while FHM ranked her among the sexiest in 2014 (No.4), and 2015 (No.18). She is also praised for her fashion sense: Ratajkowski made Vogue Italia's Best Dressed List of 2015, and Harper's Bazaar placed her atop its best dressed list at the February 2016 New York Fashion Week.|$|E
5|$|Unlike most sports, college football's {{governing}} body, the NCAA, {{does not}} bestow a National Championship title. That title is bestowed {{by one or}} more of four different polling agencies. There are two main weekly <b>polls</b> <b>that</b> begin in the preseason: the AP Poll and the Coaches Poll. Two additional polls are released midway through the season; the Harris Interactive Poll is released after the fourth week of the season and the Bowl Championship Series (BCS) Standings is released after the seventh week. The Harris Poll and Coaches Poll are factors in the BCS Standings.|$|E
5|$|After {{receiving}} the nomination, Kemp became the ticket's spokesman for minorities and the inner-city. Due to {{agreement on the}} self-help policy that Louis Farrakhan has endorsed in many fora including the Million Man March, Kemp in a sense aligned himself with Farrakhan. However, Farrakhan was perceived as being anti-Semitic, and Kemp was considered an ally of Republican Jews. This issue necessitated some political sidestepping. As the nominee, Kemp at times overshadowed Dole. In fact, more than once, Kemp was described {{as if he was}} the Presidential nominee. In addition to having overshadowed Dole, despite the negative ad campaigns that the ticket used, Kemp was a very positive running mate who relied on a pep rally type of campaign tour full of football-related metaphors and hyperbole. Although some enjoyed Kemp's style, referring to him as the Good Shepherd, his detractors, such as U.S. News & World Report writer Steven V. Roberts, criticized the extensive use of recounting stories of passing balls relative to the use of recounting stories of passing bills. During the campaign, Kemp expressed the opinion that Republican Party leaders did not stand behind the ticket wholeheartedly. Despite Kemp's voice on minority issues, Colin Powell's support and <b>polls</b> <b>that</b> showed about 30% of blacks identified themselves as conservatives on issues such as school prayer, school vouchers and criminal justice, the Republicans were unable to improve upon historical support levels from African-American voters.|$|E

25|$|Republican {{presidential nominee}} John McCain had early hopes {{for winning the}} state. New Hampshire {{strongly}} supported McCain in the 2000 and 2008 Republican primaries, attracted by his status as an independent maverick; New Hampshire voters have historically been friendly to independent-minded Republicans. After he clinched the GOP nomination in March 2008, McCain began to move more {{to the right to}} appease the base of his party, and his selection of the socially conservative Governor of Alaska Sarah Palin to be the vice presidential nominee alienated several independents and libertarian-leaning Republicans in New Hampshire. Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama campaigned extensively throughout the state in 2008 to try and unite the party in the general election after the historic and divisive 2008 Democratic primary. Despite the <b>polls</b> <b>that</b> had Obama leading by double digits, New Hampshire voters gave a surprise comeback win to Hillary Rodham Clinton in the January 2008 New Hampshire Democratic Primary {{thanks in large part to}} an enormous number of women who turned out to support Clinton after her emotional moment at a campaign stop in Portsmouth a few days earlier. Obama acknowledged this phenomenon throughout the campaign when he advised his supporters not to get so cocky and arrogant when they saw the <b>polls</b> <b>that</b> had him leading.|$|E

He announced in April 2008 that he was considering his political future, and would make an announcement later in 2008 {{as to whether or}} not he would stay on further as the party leader.|$|E

He attended its national convention in 1876, but after the party made no gains at the <b>polls</b> <b>that</b> year, he decided to become a Democrat.|$|E
25|$|Obama ran {{the most}} {{successful}} Senate campaign in 2004, and was so far ahead in <b>polls</b> <b>that</b> he soon began to campaign outside of Illinois in support of other Democratic candidates. He gave large sums of campaign funds to other candidates and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee and sent many of his volunteers to work on other races, including that of eventual three-term Congresswoman Melissa Bean who defeated then-Congressman Phil Crane in that year's election. Obama and Keyes differed on many issues including school vouchers and tax cuts, both of which Keyes supported and Obama opposed.|$|E

Trevor Mallard and Phil Goff cited the results of recent opinion <b>polls</b> <b>that</b> showed widespread public opposition or apathy (results are shown in the section below).
