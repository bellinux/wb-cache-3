40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an approach to}} a knowledge-based real-time diagnostic system for PLC controlled manufacturing systems. A general structure of the diagnostic system is implemented, which is the extension of an existing diagnostic system we developed in recent years. Diagnostic knowledge is acquired artificially and by model-based methods from the <b>pneumatic</b> and hydraulic <b>circuit</b> <b>diagrams</b> and the PLC program. The knowledge is {{the description of the}} functional and operational logic embedded in the PLC in a more usable form compared to that held in the mind of manufacturing system designers themselves. These models contain the design and engineering knowledge about the manufacturing system to be diagnosed. During the operation of the manufacturing system, the diagnostic system can continuously acquire data from the PLC, identify possible faults, search for their causes and suggest corrective actions. 1...|$|R

40|$|A {{canonical}} form for <b>circuit</b> <b>diagrams</b> with a designated start state is presented. The form {{is based upon}} finite automata minimization and Shannon's {{canonical form}} for boolean expressions. 1 Introduction This paper presents a canonical form for <b>circuit</b> <b>diagrams</b> with a designated start state. It builds upon our previous work in the logic of hardware diagrams [Fis 94]. This canonical form {{will be used to}} prove a set of inference rules on <b>circuit</b> <b>diagrams</b> logically complete in a companion paper. We present a general discussion of our canonical form in section 2, a background of <b>circuit</b> <b>diagram</b> logic in section 3 and the canonical form algorithm in section 4. 2 Canonical Forms and <b>Circuit</b> <b>Diagrams</b> In section 3, we define an equivalence relation on <b>circuit</b> <b>diagrams</b> such that all diagrams in the same equivalence class are behaviorally equivalent. Intuitively, two circuits are behaviorally equivalent if and only if they have the same observable external behavior when operated on the same sets [...] ...|$|R
