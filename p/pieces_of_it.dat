5|$|By {{the end of}} the New Kingdom, a {{tradition}} had developed that Set had cut Osiris's body into pieces and scattered them across Egypt. Cult centers of Osiris all over the country claimed that the corpse, or particular <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> were found near them. The dismembered parts could be said to number as many as forty-two, each piece being equated with one of the forty-two nomes, or provinces, in Egypt. Thus, the god of kingship becomes the embodiment of his kingdom.|$|E

25|$|Four {{years later}} (the {{timeline}} of Soulcalibur II, Soulcalibur III and Soulcalibur IV), news reach {{her that the}} Emperor destroyed and massacred Xiwei, the center of government in the Empire's western territory under the public justification of a revolt, believing that the fortress had been withholding Soul Edge from him. He asks Xianghua to investigate the ruins, as her experience could be useful in locating the sword among the rubble. Xianghua finds out the truth behind the attack from Ming spies. Though she believed that she had destroyed Soul Edge, <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> are rumored to exist in this place and so Xianghua decides to find every fragment and destroy them. She lefts on a second journey alone, convinced {{that this was a}} burden she has to bear after she failed to destroy Soul Edge completely the first time. During her adventure, Xianghua is reunited with Kilik. While on their journey, they are attacked by Zasalamel, who gravely injures Kilik. Xianghua takes Kilik back to his home, where she hears that he would make full recovery. After leaving a letter for him, she departs seeking an old general whom Edge Master has arranged for her to meet. Training with the general, Xianghua's skills improve significantly but she is unable to shake off an overwhelming feeling of inadequacy due to her failure to help Kilik. On the general's sage advice, she then begins to train her mind to become more fluid and allow her heart to filter in both the good and the bad. After months of training, she feels that she was ready and bid farewell to the general, beginning her journey anew to fight by herself. While traveling west on the Silk Road, she reunites with Kilik. Together they travel to India to find Maxi, but he does not join them. Xianghua swears to destroy the Soul Edge properly and once and for all.|$|E

They soon {{discover}} that the angel Balthazar has stolen it and sold <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> to people in exchange for their souls. They confront Balthazar, but are interrupted by Raphael. Before Raphael is able to get his revenge against Castiel, Balthazar destroys Raphael's vessel and sends him back to Heaven. After trapping Balthazar within a ring of ignited holy oil and forcing him to restore the souls he has taken, Castiel sets him free, claiming his debt has been paid off.|$|E
500|$|Weighing [...] as a newborn, Kemper {{was already}} a head taller than his peers {{by the age of}} four. He was also {{intelligent}} but exhibited antisocial and psychopathic behavior such as cruelty to animals. At the age of 10, he buried a pet cat alive and once it had died, he dug it up, decapitated it and mounted its head on a spike. Kemper later stated that he derived pleasure from successfully lying to his family and about killing the cat. At the age of 13, he killed another family cat when he perceived it to be favoring his younger sister, Allyn Lee Kemper (born 1951), over him. He kept <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> in his closet until his mother found them.|$|E

Armstrong and Butchart brought the aircraft into a nose-down alignment to increase speed, then launched the Skyrocket. At the instant of launch, the number-four engine propeller disintegrated. <b>Pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> damaged the number-three engine and hit the number-two engine. Butchart and Armstrong were forced {{to shut down the}} number-three engine, due to damage, and the number-one engine, due to the torque it created.

500|$|For many Southern sympathizers, the Mint {{soon became}} a symbol of their hatred for the Union occupation. After U.S. Marines under Farragut had raised the U.S. flag {{on the roof of the}} Mint in April 1862, a {{professional}} steamboat gambler named William Bruce Mumford ascended the roof and tore the flag down. He ripped the banner into shreds, and defiantly stuffed <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> into his shirt to wear as souvenirs. Union General Benjamin Franklin Butler, the military governor of New Orleans (who was soon to be derisively nicknamed [...] "Spoons" [...] for allegedly pocketing the silverware of New Orleans citizens arrested for treason against the United States), ordered Mumford executed in retaliation. And so, Mumford was hanged from a flagstaff projecting horizontally from the building on June 7, 1862. Mumford's hanging made national headlines. Jefferson Davis demanded that Butler immediately be executed if captured. The event stuck in the minds of many New Orleanians: eleven years later, in 1873, a visitor to the city named Edward King mentioned it in his description of the structure.|$|E

500|$|After the 1814 battle, George Armistead took {{possession}} of the large flag, and {{after his death in}} 1818 his widow, Louisa Hughes Armistead, kept it. [...] During her four decades of ownership, she allowed it to be displayed on a few occasions, and also removed <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> to be given as gifts, a common practice of the day. [...] Following her death in 1861 the flag went to her daughter, Georgiana Armistead Appleton, and then later to her grandson, Eben Appleton. [...] The flag was moved to various locations over a 40-year period until 1907 when Eben Appleton loaned it to the Smithsonian. [...] In 1912 the loan became permanent, and the flag underwent a variety of restorations. [...] Beginning in December 1998, the flag began an $18 million conservation treatment (not a restoration) and now this flag that was hand crafted by Pickersgill and her helpers in 1813 {{is one of the most}} important artifacts, and the centerpiece of the redesigned National Museum of American History.|$|E
500|$|The scenes {{shot at the}} Hospital {{maternity}} {{ward and}} the warehouse were shot at a new studio called [...] "The Coca-Cola Factory" [...] which was formerly a Coke bottling plant. The hospital scenes took 40 days to shoot. The hospital segment's location was chosen since they wanted to have an atypical location where gangs would hide their weapons. While filming in the hospital, the windows were covered with blast shields to {{give the appearance of}} night time, which allowed the crew to film {{at any time during the}} day. Members of the cast and crew stayed in the hospital for days often losing track of the time of day. After long hours of filming in the hospital, the crew became exhausted. This led to having the last scene be one long five-minute scene of action to shorten the time needed to film. To complete this, during the scene when two characters go into an elevator to talk for twenty seconds, the crew changes the scene entirely and sets up the explosions for the scene to continue seamlessly. An accident occurred while filming the hospital sequence. Real glass was used and <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> flew toward Tony Leung and got into his eyes. Leung was sent to the hospital and after a week's rest, he returned to the set. Woo changed the ending of Hard Boiled after many members of the crew of the film felt that Leung's character should survive at the film's end.|$|E

2500|$|The newer {{information}} {{is supported by}} the fate of 63-13287. On 14 December 1965, operating TDY from Incirlik Air Base in Turkey as [...] "Big Rib 06", it disappeared during a mission over the Black Sea whose route passed through telemetry range for Soviet ICBMs. What actually happened is still uncertain. There was speculation that the aircraft had been shot down by a Soviet S-75 Dvina (NATO designation [...] "SA-2 Guideline") surface-to-air missile, but the official statement by the USAF was that the aircraft was on its third pass along its route when it deviated from its flight plan, orbiting and spiraling down to below minimum radar tracking altitude, indicating that the aircraft crew had probably perished from an oxygen system failure. Although searches for the wreckage continued until 28 December, only small bits and <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> were recovered, although unsubstantiated reports asserted that the two crew members had been captured alive by the Soviets. However one of the recovered pieces was an inner wing panel that a team of structural experts concluded was struck by an object, likely a missile. The crew was declared dead after being missing for six months. The Soviets used the incident to argue successfully against U.S. intelligence-gathering missions originating from Turkish air bases.|$|E
