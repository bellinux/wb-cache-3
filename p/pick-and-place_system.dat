40|$|This paper {{presents}} a robotic <b>pick-and-place</b> <b>system</b> that {{is capable of}} grasping and recognizing both known and novel objects in cluttered environments. The key new feature of the system is that it handles a wide range of object categories without needing any task-specific training data for novel objects. To achieve this, it first uses a category-agnostic affordance prediction algorithm to select among four different grasping primitive behaviors. It then recognizes picked objects with a cross-domain image classification framework that matches observed images to product images. Since product images are readily available {{for a wide range of}} objects (e. g., from the web), the system works out-of-the-box for novel objects without requiring any additional training data. Exhaustive experimental results demonstrate that our multi-affordance grasping achieves high success rates for a wide variety of objects in clutter, and our recognition algorithm achieves high accuracy for both known and novel grasped objects.

A fully autonomous warehouse <b>pick-and-place</b> <b>system</b> requires robust vision that reliably recognizes and locates objects amid cluttered environments, self-occlusions, sensor noise, {{and a large}} variety of objects. In this paper we present an approach that leverages multi-view RGB-D data and self-supervised, data-driven learning to overcome those difficulties. The approach {{was part of the}} MIT-Princeton Team system that took 3 rd- and 4 th- place in the stowing and picking tasks, respectively at APC 2016. In the proposed approach, we segment and label multiple views of a scene with a fully convolutional neural network, and then fit pre-scanned 3 D object models to the resulting segmentation to get the 6 D object pose. Training a deep neural network for segmentation typically requires a large amount of training data. We propose a self-supervised method to generate a large labeled dataset without tedious manual segmentation.

40|$|International audienceOptical Solar Reflectors (OSR) are {{efficient}} thermal emitter glass tiles with {{a typical}} size of 40 x 40 mm. They cover spacecraft radiator panels to reduce absorption of solar radiation and to dissipate internally generated heat into space. On modern high-power telecom satellites total radiator areas reach sizes {{of more than}} 20 m². State-of-the-art processes to apply such OSR tiles are labour intensive and involve application of two-component adhesives, manual placing of tiles and long duration temperature controlled adhesive curing cycles. This paper presents the qualification campaign of a sophisticated OSR application method using electrically conductive pressure sensitive adhesive (PSA) and a semi-automated OSR pick-and-place facility. Compared to standard OSR application using electrically conductive filled silicone resins, the new process is resulting in radiator surfaces with up to 27 % lower mass. After manual application of the PSA the panel {{is placed in the}} 3 -axis controlled gantry system, where a precise manipulator takes each tile and places it on the CAD pre-defined position on the panel. When the panel is covered with OSR an automated rolling process applies the required pressure to activate tape adhesion.

For qualification, samples prepared with the automated process were subjected to a thorough space environmental test campaign.

40|$|From {{a simple}} {{electronic}} devices to replace sophisticated electro-mechanical relays, nowadays PLCs are extensively used in industrial automation field {{and they are}} integrated into much larger environment, capable of almost any type of control applications, including motion control and instrumentation. It {{is well known that}} PLC related processes in manufacturing lines are safety-critical systems because of the increasing number of embedded functions and features. These are beneficial for engineers since they can design and develop sophisticated and complex control programs up {{to the best of their}} knowledge and capabilities. On the other hand, this introduces a potential safety risk; thus, their effects on system reliability need to be investigated more thoroughly. Moreover, any failure of these control systems might not only result in a significant financial loss but lead to casualties as well. Hence, their actual programming and the correctness of the programs play a vital role. Manufacturing automation is facing strong demands for high reliability of process control systems. These include the flexibility and safety requirements in order to improve the performance of machines and equipments in manufacturing lines. For example, prior to the commissioning of new machines or production lines, it is necessary to ensure that the designed control programs will not violate any previously determined control specifications. In other words, appropriate preventive actions should be taken in advance so that the process runs in a safe system configuration; thus, avoiding additional corrective procedures due to unsafe or failures of operations. Formal verification of correctness of a property (i. e. deadlock freeness) in a system follows the steps which are; identify the properties that need to be verified, build an abstract model of the system (including the surrounding environment), identify the parts of the systems that are interesting, and mathematically show that the property always holds in the region of interest. Even more interesting is that when having all this information, beside verification one can even compute a correct "solution". The formal verification process is nowadays plays an important role in industrial automation complex problem solving. Implementation of verification procedures is required to eliminate design errors that decrease the safety of automation systems. Design errors may vary from case to case but will certainly jeopardize the safety of manufacturing lines and operators. Therefore, checking the possibility of state transitions in the control systems from safe to unsafe states is essential. Formal verification via model checking procedures has proven to be efficient and is widely used. System finite element models are employed to automatically verify certain correctness properties. In this study, we propose a novel method of model checking for logic control design. A checking procedure based on Gr ? bner bases (GB) model is used to analyze and design a controller that meets the requirements defined by a predetermined safety function. We compare the proposed method with symbolic computation tree logic (CTL) model checking based on binary decision diagrams. A crane system is used as a case study. In addition, we compare the computational efficiency of the methods and present counterexamples by unsafe conditions. Our works presented in the thesis deal with safety design and verification and validation (V&V) of logic control systems that are widely used in manufacturing processes. Two methods, one is a proposed method of Gr ? bner bases computation and the other is conventional BDD-based model checking, are used to verify the safety of the designed controller, by using predetermined safety properties based on known hazardous states of a logic control system. The model checking based on Gr ? bner bases computation is our novel work that uses algebraic approach, compare to BDD-based model checking that proposes symbolic computations. We also carry out verification of other temporal properties, such as reachability, liveness and fairness evaluation by using the BDD-based model checking approach. We perform a number of experiments to validate the safety of designed controllers using an arm pick-and-place model, considered as two types of control systems, which are a two cranes system and a nondeterministic arm <b>pick-and-place</b> <b>system.</b> Performance analysis on computational complexity between both verification methods is also thoroughly discussed. Furthermore, we introduce a formal modeling and verification of PLC nondeterministic behavior with ladder diagram (LD) implementation. We provide an illustrative example by using an arm pick-and-place model and design the LD program for the arm, with application of a timer ON and timer OFF function blocks. The nondeterministic behaviors are configured from an arm grip condition and also from the logical formalism of both timers properties. By applying several logical properties to the arm model, we verify the deterministic and nondeterministic behaviors and illustrate experimental results for validation of arm safe operation. This work contributes to safety verification and validation of an arm pick-and-place operationa model nondeterministic behaviors, model verification using logical properties with inclusion of nondeterministic behaviors from state operation and timer function, and application of the timer OFF function block for safety experiments and implementation liveness property check...|$|E

40|$|Automation of the {{industrial}} transformer core assembly process is highly desirable. A survey undertaken by the author however, revealed that due to {{the high cost of}} existing fully automated systems, Australian manufacturers producing low to medium transformer volumes continue to maintain a manual construction approach. The conceptual design of a cost-effective automation system for core assembly from pre-cut lamination stacks was consequently undertaken. The major hurdle for automating the existing manual process was identified as the difficulty in reliably handling and accurately positioning the constituent core laminations, which number in their thousands, during transformer core construction. Technical evaluation of the proposed <b>pick-and-place</b> core assembly <b>system,</b> incorporating two mobile robots bearing a common gripper, is presented herein to address these requirements. A unique robotic gripper, having the capability to selectively pick a given number of steel laminations (typically two or three) concurrently from a stack, has the potential to significantly increase productivity. The only available avenue for picking multiple laminations was deemed to be a gripper based on magnetism. Closed form analytical and finite element models for an electromagnet-stack system were contrived and their force distributions obtained. The theoretical findings were validated by experiment using a specially constructed prototype. Critical parameters for reliably lifting the required number of laminations were identified and a full scale electromagnet, that overcame inherent suction forces present in the stack during picking, was subsequently developed. A mechanical docking arrangement is envisaged that will ensure precise lamination placement. Owing to the grippers unwieldy length however, conventional robots cannot be used for assembling larger cores. Two wheeled mobile robots (WMRs) compliantly coupled to either end of the gripper could be considered although a review of the current literature revealed the absence of a suitable controller. Dynamic modelling for a single WMR was therefore undertaken and later expanded upon for the dual WMR system conceived. Nonlinear adaptive controllers for both WMR systems were developed and subsequently investigated via simulation. Neglecting the systems dynamics resulted in analogous, simplified kinematic control schemes, that were verified experimentally using prototypes. Additional cooperative control laws ensuring the synchronisation of the two robots were also implemented on the prototype system...|$|R
40|$|Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) This thesis proposes an {{automated}} grid-based alignment system utilizing lasers {{and an array}} of light-detecting photodiodes. The intent is to create an inexpensive and scalable alignment system for <b>pick-and-place</b> robotic <b>systems.</b> The system utilizes the transformation matrix, geometry, and trigonometry to determine the movements to align the robot with a grid-based array of photodiodes. The alignment system consists of a sending unit utilizing lasers, a receiving module consisting of photodiodes, a data acquisition unit, a computer-based control system, and the robot being aligned. The control system computes the robot movements needed to position the lasers based on the laser positions detected by the photodiodes. A transformation matrix converts movements from the coordinate system of the grid formed by the photodiodes to the coordinate system of the robot. The photodiode grid can detect a single laser spot and move it to any part of the grid, or it can detect up to four laser spots and use their relative positions to determine rotational misalignment of the robot. Testing the alignment consists of detecting the position of a single laser at individual points in a distinct pattern on the grid array of photodiodes, and running the entire alignment process multiple times starting with different misalignment cases. The first test provides a measure of the position detection accuracy of the system, while the second test demonstrates the alignment accuracy and repeatability of the system. The system detects the position of a single laser or multiple lasers by using a method similar to a center-of-gravity calculation. The intensity of each photodiode is multiplied by the X-position of that photodiode. The summed result from each photodiode intensity and position product is divided by the summed value of all of the photodiode intensities to get the X-position of the laser. The same thing is done with the Y-values to get the Y-position of the laser. Results show that with this method the system can read a single laser position value with a resolution of 0. 1 mm, and with a maximum X-error of 2. 9 mm and Y-error of 2. 0 mm. It takes approximately 1. 5 seconds to process the reading. The alignment procedure calculates the initial misalignment between the robot and the grid of photodiodes by moving the robot to two distinct points along the robot’s X-axis so that only one laser is over the grid. Using these two detected points, a movement trajectory is generated to move that laser to the X = 0, Y = 0 position on the grid. In the process, this moves the other three lasers over the grid, allowing the system to detect the positions of four lasers and uses the positions to determine the rotational and translational offset needed to align the lasers to the grid of photodiodes. This step is run in a feedback loop to update the adjustment until it is within a permissible error value. The desired result for the complete alignment is a robot manipulator positioning within ± 0. 5 mm along the X and Y-axes. The system shows a maximum error of 0. 2 mm in the X-direction and 0. 5 mm in the Y-direction with a run-time of approximately 4 to 5 minutes per alignment. If the permissible error value of the final alignment is tripled the alignment time goes down to 1 to 1. 5 minutes and the maximum error goes up to 1. 4 mm in both the X and Y-directions.
