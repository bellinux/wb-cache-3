Hybrid orbitals are very useful in the explanation of molecular geometry and atomic bonding properties.

Hirsch's most significant work would be his attempt to unify theories of superconductivity with his theory of hole superconductivity which suggests pairing of electron holes {{that would lead to}} high temperature superconductivity as opposed to <b>pairing</b> <b>of</b> <b>electrons</b> in conventional BCS theory. He believes that there is a single mechanism of superconductivity for all materials that explains the Meissner effect and differs from the conventional mechanism in several fundamental aspects.|$|E
5000|$|Peierls’ {{discovery}} gained experimental backing {{during the}} effort to find new superconducting materials. In 1964, Dr. William Little of the Stanford University Department of Physics theorized that a certain class of polymer chains may experience a high Tc superconducting transition. [...] The basis for his assertion was that the lattice distortions that lead to <b>pairing</b> <b>of</b> <b>electrons</b> in the BCS theory of superconductivity could be replaced instead by rearranging the electron density {{in a series of}} side chains. This means that now electrons would be responsible for creating the Cooper pairs instead of ions. Because the transition temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the mass of the charged particle responsible for the distortions, the Tc should be improved by a corresponding factor: ...|$|E
5000|$|Early {{studies of}} quasi-1-D {{conductors}} {{were motivated by}} a proposal, in 1964, that certain types of polymer chain compounds could exhibit superconductivity with a high critical temperature Tc. [...] The theory {{was based on the}} idea that <b>pairing</b> <b>of</b> <b>electrons</b> in the BCS theory of superconductivity could be mediated by interactions of conducting electrons in one chain with nonconducting electrons in some side chains. (By contrast, electron pairing is mediated by phonons, or vibrating ions, in the BCS theory of conventional superconductors.) Since light electrons, instead of heavy ions, would lead to the formation of Cooper pairs, their characteristic frequency and, hence, energy scale and Tc would be enhanced. Organic materials, such as TTF-TCNQ were measured and studied theoretically in the 1970s. [...] These materials were found to undergo a metal-insulator, rather than superconducting, transition. It was eventually established that such experiments represented the first observations of the Peierls transition.|$|E

40|$|The iron-based superconductors {{allow for}} a zoo of {{possible}} order parameters due to their orbital degrees of freedom. These order parameters are often written in an orbital basis, as this allows to distinguish their different symmetry. Unlike in standard single-band superconductors, where electrons of the same band - and hence, energy - are paired, a general order parameter in such a multi-orbital system also contains <b>pairing</b> <b>of</b> <b>electrons</b> belonging to different bands. As this corresponds to <b>pairing</b> <b>of</b> <b>electrons</b> of different energy, such order parameters are energetically less stable. Here, we present a simple criterion for a stability analysis of the orbital part of the gap function based on the basic principle that electrons of equal energy are paired in the superconducting state.
