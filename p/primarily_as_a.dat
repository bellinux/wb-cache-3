As a colleague of Watsuki, he worked <b>primarily</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> manga assistant, only focusing on his own projects during his days off. He was influenced by street art from hip-hop and rap culture, which is apparent in his manga artwork. For drawing, he used calligraphy inks and pen nibs. When illustrating, he used Copic brand color markers.|$|E
5|$|By 1975, {{peregrine}} falcons {{had been}} reduced to 324 pairs in North America, <b>primarily</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> result of DDT, a widely used pesticide. DDT lowered estrogen levels in female peregrines and inhibited the production of calcium, causing eggs to thin and break during incubation. Recovery efforts for the peregrine falcon have been remarkably successful: agricultural DDT was banned by the U.S. in 1972 and efforts to breed and train peregrine falcons in captivity to later release to the wild were effective. In 1999, the peregrine falcon was removed from the U.S. Endangered Species list.|$|E
5|$|Clindamycin {{preparations}} for oral administration include capsules (containing clindamycin hydrochloride) and oral suspensions (containing clindamycin palmitate hydrochloride).

5|$|Hamhuis' {{role with}} the Predators was diminished {{in his final}} few seasons in Nashville with the {{emergence}} of younger defencemen Shea Weber and Ryan Suter as the club's top two defencemen. With Weber and Suter providing most of the offence from the blueline, Hamhuis was used <b>primarily</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> shutdown defenceman, matching up against opposing team's top forward units and leading the club in shorthanded ice time, while seeing limited powerplay time.|$|E
5|$|In 1720, Squire Boone, {{who worked}} <b>primarily</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> weaver and a blacksmith, married Sarah Morgan (1700–77).

5|$|In 1908, the Dip the Dips Scenic Railway {{roller coaster}} opened but was soon overshadowed in 1912 {{by the larger}} Leap the Dips ride. In 1917, Dip the Dips was razed and {{replaced}} by the Leap Frog Scenic Railway. With three roller coasters and a growing variety of other rides, Cedar Point was beginning to grow as an amusement park, though that was not Boeckling's priority. He marketed the peninsula <b>primarily</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> bathing resort complete with shows, exhibits, motion pictures, {{and other forms of}} entertainment, but did not emphasize the park's rides.|$|E
