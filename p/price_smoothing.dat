40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the case for}} government-led smoothing of domestic petroleum prices {{in the face of}} volatile international prices. Governments in most developing and transition countries engage in petroleum <b>price</b> <b>smoothing,</b> as the survey of country practice carried out for this paper shows.

40|$|International audienceColumn {{generation}} {{is a well-known}} method to solve large-scale combinatorial optimisation problem. However, its application in practice if often limited by convergence issues. To overcome this drawback, several stabilization techniques have been proposed. Probably, the most common techniques are 1) adding piecewise linear penalty functions to the dual objective and 2) dual <b>price</b> <b>smoothing,</b> which consists in pricing with a linear combination of the current dual solution and the best dual solution obtained earlier. Recently we proposed an automatic (parameter-less) variant of the dual <b>price</b> <b>smoothing</b> technique. In this work, we experimentally compare efficiency of the two mentioned stabilisation techniques {{on a wide range}} of problems, including machine scheduling, generalised assignment, lot sizing, capacitated vehicle routing, shift scheduling, and min-cost multi-commodity flow. Then, we also test numerically the combination of these techniques. Our experimental results show that for most problems this combination outperforms the two techniques applied separately...|$|E

Exploiting the link between in-out separation strategies and dual <b>price</b> <b>smoothing</b> techniques for column generation, we derive a generic bound convergence property for algorithms using a smoothing feature. Such property adds to existing in-out asymptotic convergence results. Beyond theoretically convergence, we describe a proposal for effective finite convergence in practice and we develop a smoothing auto-regulating strategy that makes the need for parameter tuning obsolete. These contributions turn stabilization by smoothing into a general purpose practical scheme that can be used into a generic column generation procedure. We conclude the paper by showing that the approach can be combined with an ascent method, leading to improved performances. Such combination might inspire novel cut separation strategies...|$|E

The introduced PCM layer in conjunction with night cooling add to the usual ceiling cooling systems offers the advantages of low energy consumption, high cool storage capacity, operation under reduced night electricity <b>price,</b> <b>smoothing</b> of electricity consumption by eliminating daily peak loads, improved thermal comfort and elimination of ceiling dripping. Our parametric analysis {{is based on a}} transient three-dimensional finite-difference solution of the related heat-transfer problem for various values of all the main system parameters. PCM phase change process is simulated by using the effective thermal capacity function, which is determined experimentally for PCM suitable for air-conditioning applications. Our tests showed that the main parameters of the system are pipe spacing, PCM layer thickness, pipe depth within the ceiling, cooling water inlet temperature, night cooling duration and PCM properties (thermal conductivity, phase change heat and ends of phase change temperature range). The effect of all the above parameters is analysed and suggestions are made for selecting the proper combinations of their values in order to obtain the lowest energy consumption in conjunction with the highest level of thermal comfort. © 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|E
40|$|Commodity {{prices have}} {{historically}} {{been among the most}} volatile of international prices. Measured volatility (the standard deviation of price changes) has not been below 15 percent and at times has been more than 50 percent. Often the volatility of commodity prices has exceeded that of exchange rates and interest rates. The large price variations are caused by disturbances in demand and supply. Stockholding leads to some <b>price</b> <b>smoothing,</b> but when stocks are low, prices can jump sharply. As a result, commodity price series are not stationary and in some periods they jump abruptly to high levels or fall precipitously to low levels relative to their long-run average. Thus {{it is difficult to determine}} long-term price trends and the underlying distribution of prices. The volatility of commodity prices makes price forecasting difficult. Indeed, realized prices often deviate greatly from forecasted prices, which has led to the practice of giving forecasts probability ranges. But assigning probability ranges requires forecasting future price volatility, which, given uncertainties about true price distribution, is difficult. One potentially useful source of information for forecasting volatility is the volatility forecasts imbedded in the prices of options written on commodities traded in exchanges. Options give the holder the right to buy (call) or sell (put) a certain commodity at a certain date at a fixed (exercise) price. Options prices depend on several variables, one of which is the expected volatility up to the maturity date. Given a specific theoretical model, the market prices of options can be used to derive the market's expectations about price volatility and the price distribution. The authors systematically analyze different methods'abilities to forecast commodity price volatility (for several commodities). They collected the daily prices of commodity options and other variables for seven commodities (cocoa, corn, cotton, gold, silver, sugar, and wheat). They extracted the volatility forecasts implicit in options prices using several techniques. They compared several volatility forecasting methods, divided into three categories: (1) forecasts using only expectations derived form options prices; (2) forecasts using only time-series modeling; (3) forecasts that combine market expectations and time-series modeling (a new method devised for this purpose). They find that the volatility forecasts produced by method 3 outperform the first two as well as the naive forecast based on historical volatility. This result holds both in and out of sample for almost all commodities considered. Markets and Market Access,Access to Markets,Economic Theory&Research,Economic Forecasting,Science Education...|$|E
