40|$|During liver insufficiency, besides portasystemic shunting, high {{arterial}} glutamine concentrations could enhance intestinal glutamine {{consumption and}} ammonia generation, thereby aggravating hyperammonaemia. To investigate this hypothesis, portal drained viscera (intestines) fluxes and jejunal tissue concentrations of ammonia and glutamine were measured in <b>portacaval</b> <b>shunted</b> rats with a ligated bile duct, <b>portacaval</b> <b>shunted,</b> and sham operated rats, seven and 14 days after surgery, and in normal unoperated controls. Effects {{of differences in}} food intake were minimised by pair feeding <b>portacaval</b> <b>shunted</b> and sham operated with <b>portacaval</b> <b>shunted</b> rats with biliary obstruction.

At day 7 in all operated groups glutamine uptake by portal drained viscera was lower than in normal unoperated controls, but no major differences were found at day 14.

40|$|Renal {{glutamine}} uptake {{and subsequent}} urinary ammonia excretion {{could be an}} important alternative pathway of ammonia disposal from the body during liver failure (diminished urea synthesis), but this pathway has received little attention.

Renal fluxes, urinary excretion, and renal tissue concentrations of amino acids and ammonia were measured 24 h after <b>portacaval</b> <b>shunting,</b> and 2, 4, and 6 h after liver ischemia induction and in the appropriate controls. Arterial ammonia increased to 247 +/- 22 microM after <b>portacaval</b> <b>shunting</b> compared to controls (51 +/- 8 microM) (P < 0. 001) and increased to 934 +/- 54 microM during liver ischemia (P < 0. 001).

In contrast to controls, in <b>portacaval</b> <b>shunted</b> rats the kidney net disposed ammonia from the body by diminishing renal venous ammonia release (from 267 +/- 33 to - 49 +/- 59 nmol/ 100 g body wt per min) and enhancing urinary ammonia excretion from 113 +/- 24 to 305 +/- 52 nmol/ 100 g body wt per min (both P < 0. 01).

40|$|Emergency {{treatment}} of bleeding esophageal varices in cirrhosis is of singular importance {{because of the}} high mortality rate. Emergency <b>portacaval</b> <b>shunt</b> is rarely used today because of the belief, unsubstantiated by long-term randomized trials, that it causes frequent portal-systemic encephalopathy and liver failure. Consequently, <b>portacaval</b> <b>shunt</b> has been relegated solely to salvage therapy when endoscopic and pharmacologic therapies have failed. Question: Is the regimen of endoscopic sclerotherapy with rescue <b>portacaval</b> <b>shunt</b> for failure to control bleeding varices superior to emergency <b>portacaval</b> <b>shunt?</b> A unique opportunity to answer this question was provided by a randomized controlled trial of endoscopic sclerotherapy versus emergency <b>portacaval</b> <b>shunt</b> conducted from 1988 to 2005. Unselected consecutive cirrhotic patients with acute bleeding esophageal varices were randomized to endoscopic sclerotherapy (n[*]=[*] 106) or emergency <b>portacaval</b> <b>shunt</b> (n[*]=[*] 105). Diagnostic workup was completed and treatment was initiated within 8  h. Failure of endoscopic sclerotherapy was defined by strict criteria and treated by rescue <b>portacaval</b> <b>shunt</b> (n[*]=[*] 50) whenever possible. Ninety-six percent of patients had more than 10  years of follow-up or until death. Comparison of emergency <b>portacaval</b> <b>shunt</b> and endoscopic sclerotherapy followed by rescue <b>portacaval</b> <b>shunt</b> showed the following differences in measurements of outcomes: (1) survival after 5  years (72 % versus 22 %), 10  years (46 % versus 16 %), and 15  years (46 % versus 0 %); (2) median post-shunt survival (6. 18 versus 1. 99  years); (3) mean requirements of packed red blood cell units (17. 85 versus 27. 80); (4) incidence of recurrent portal-systemic encephalopathy (15 % versus 43 %); (5) 5 -year change in Child’s class showing improvement (59 % versus 19 %) or worsening (8 % versus 44 %); (6) mean quality of life points in which lower is better (13. 89 versus 27. 89); and (7) mean cost of care per year ($ 39, 200 versus $ 216, 700). These differences were highly significant in favor of emergency <b>portacaval</b> <b>shunt</b> (all p[*]<[*] 0. 001).

Using the technique of injecting Polystyrene microspheres in the superior mesenteric vein, we demonstrated that the {{presence of}} adult schistosomes in the lungs of R. rattus was not due to an innate anomaly of the rat vasculature but resulted from the formation of <b>portacaval</b> <b>shunts</b> during infection. In rats harbouring a bisexual infection, microspheres were only detected in the lungs from week 7. The development and increasing size of the shunts were maximal between weeks 7 and 10 and coincident with the translocation of adult worms from the portal tract to the lungs. At weeks 20 – 25, only 1 – 2 % of the microspheres were recovered from the lungs, suggesting that the portacaval anastomoses have regressed due to reduction in portal hypertension after worm translocation. R. rattus with a male-only schistosome infection harboured adult worms in the lungs, indicating that the development of shunts does not solely depend upon egg deposition in the liver to generate hypertension.

The pharmacokinetic parameters of lidocaine, antipyrine and salicylamide were studied in dogs before and after construction of a <b>portacaval</b> <b>shunt.</b> The systemic availability of antipyrine was not altered significantly by the surgical procedure whereas the availability of lidocaine and salicylamide, drugs with a marked first-pass effect, was increased from 14. 8 ± 2. 8 to 81. 3 ± 5. 2 % and from 21. 8 ± 7. 8 to 57. 5 ± 2. 5 %, respectively.

This report describes an experience with emergency <b>portacaval</b> <b>shunt</b> for the treatment of variceal bleeding when used systematically after hemodynamic stabilization and control of the bleeding episode with balloon tamponade, if necessary, in patients with mild or moderate liver disease. The population studied comprised 62 consecutive patients who rebled from varices while participating in a controlled trial of propranolol for the prevention of rebleeding. Of the 62 patients, nine died of massive hemorrhage and 53 survived the hemorrhage. Of the 53 survivors, 11 had severe liver disease and were not considered for shunt surgery. Of the remaining 42 patients with mild or moderate liver disease, 36 had emergency central <b>portacaval</b> <b>shunt.</b> The interval between endoscopic diagnosis of variceal bleeding and surgery averaged 19 +/- 3 hours (mean +/- SE).

Thus, under specific conditions, emergency <b>portacaval</b> <b>shunt</b> results in an acceptable long-term survival rate.

40|$|The {{major cause}} of portal {{hypertension}} in Western countries is nutritional cirrhosis (parenchymal block) related to alcoholism. A third of those patients die of variceal bleeding when increased pressure within the varices precipitates bleeding. Construction of portal systemic shunts is aimed at reducing the pressure within the varices and thereby decreasing the risk of bleeding. However, it increases the incidence of hepatic encephalopathy and hence should be used only in patients who have bled. The remaining function {{appears to be the}} main factor that determines survival and the incidence of encephalopathy in obese individuals. <b>Portacaval</b> <b>shunts</b> almost completely eliminate the risk of bleeding.

The phosphomonoesters (p < 0. 01), inorganic phosphate and ATP levels (p < 0. 05) were decreased significantly in portacaval shunt–treated and in portacaval shunt‐pluscyclosporin A–treated dogs compared with unshunted control dogs. After a fructose challenge (750 mg/kg body wt, intravenously), fructose‐ 1 ‐phosphate metabolism was reduced in portacaval shunt–treated dogs compared with either the normal or portacaval shuntplus‐cyclosporin A–treated dogs (p < 0. 05). Both portacaval shunt– and portacaval shunt‐plus‐cyclosporin A–treated dogs demonstrated a reduced decline in ATP levels after fructose infusion when compared with the controls (p < 0. 05). Immediately after the fructose challenge, the intracellular pH decreased from 7. 30 ± 0. 03 to 7. 00 ± 0. 05 in all animals (p < 0. 01) and then gradually returned to normal over 60 min.

Severity of encephalopathy was quantified by clinical grading and EEG spectral analysis. Changes in brain metabolites were assessed by amino acid analysis of brain cortex homogenates, whereas changes in amino acids with neurotransmitter activity were assessed in cerebrospinal fluid; brain water content was measured by subtracting dry from wet brain weights and intracranial pressure was measured by a pressure transducer connected to a cisterna magna cannula. Although similar increased blood and brain ammonia concentrations were obtained in both experimental groups, only AI-portacaval shunted rats developed encephalopathy, associated with {{a significant increase in}} intracranial pressure.

It is suggested that bacterial presence in the bowel together with a depression of the liver reticuloendothelial function plays an important part in the early and rapid mortality of acute liver failure. Temporary auxiliary liver transplantation using an allograft or a closely related primate heterograft seem to be the 2 best available methods of hepatic support for potentially reversible acute liver failure...|$|R

Partial {{diversion}} of the portal system aims to redeuce portal pressure sufficiently to prevent variceal hemorrhage but still maintain adwquate hepatic portal flow. Methods. Partial <b>portacaval</b> <b>shunts</b> were performed in 25 patients with cirrhosis with portal hypertension and esophageal varices, either as a primary procedure (n 16) or for failure of endoscopic sclerotherapy (n = 9), with ringed polytetrafluoroethylene prostheses (8, 10, or 12 rnrn). Results. All patients have now been followed up for at least 1 year. The operative mortality rate (2 months) was 4 %. In 24 patients who survived beyond the initial perioperative period, there was no recurrence of variceal bleeding. Cumulative shunt patency (up to 4 years) is 96 %. Acute encephalopathy was detected in two patients (8 %) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of microsurgery has been dependent on experimental animals. Microsurgery {{could be a}} very valuable technique to improve experimental models of liver diseases. Microdissection and microsutures are the two main microsurgical techniques that can be considered for classifying the experimental models developed for liver research in the rat. Partial portal vein ligation, extrahepatic cholestasis and hepatectomies are all models based on microdissection. On the other hand, in <b>portacaval</b> <b>shunts,</b> orthotopic liver transplantation and partial heterotopic liver transplantation, the microsuture techniques stand out. By reducing surgical complications, these microsurgical techniques allow for improving the resulting experimental models. If good experimental models for liver research are successfully developed, the results obtained from their study might be particularly useful in patients with liver disease. Therefore experimental liver microsurgery could be an invaluable way to translate laboratory data on liver research into new clinical diagnostic and therapeutic strategies...|$|R
