5|$|On Jan. 11, 2016, the Klein ISD Board of Trustees {{approved}} the Design Development for Intermediate School #10. Huckabee Architects has designed the 205,000 sf. campus in three separate learning areas: 6th Grade, 7th & 8th Grade STEM, and 7th & 8th Grade Humanities. It {{is designed to}} accommodate a site on West Rayford Rd next to Metzler Elementary with a 20ft. elevation change that runs front to back, as well as 2 acres of protected wetlands. Per the current instructional program for intermediate schools, the campus includes a Black Box theater classroom that is being designed to combine as a stage, collaboration areas within the communities for <b>project-based</b> learning and small group instruction, and Makerspace in the library or learning commons. The estimated completion date is Fall 2018.|$|E

25|$|The School of Environmental Studies was {{designed}} {{in a manner}} very different from most schools. The committee charged with planning SES conducted almost two years of research before commissioning an architect. What emerged was a clear vision {{of the kinds of}} learning experiences they hoped to provide: interdisciplinary, <b>project-based,</b> and real-world.|$|E
25|$|Toastmasters {{provides}} {{a number of}} educational modules outside of the regular <b>project-based</b> curriculum that teach members leadership skills. These include The Leadership Excellence Series which deals with individual leadership skills, and The Successful Club Series which are targeted at the club as a group. The Success/Leadership programs also exist, as a leadership counterpart to Success/Communication. Like Success/Communication, these programs can be presented inside {{or out of the}} club, to non-members.|$|E
25|$|PSD {{is home to}} 32 {{elementary}} schools. A {{model of}} site-based management allows each school to select the focus that best fits the needs of its community, meaning that schools offer {{a wide range of}} specialized programs including International Baccalaureate, Core Knowledge, <b>Project-Based</b> Learning, Bilingual, and Expeditionary Learning. Colorado state law mandates Schools of Choice, meaning that parents can opt their child into any school in the district beyond their assigned neighborhood school, if space is available.|$|E
25|$|Central Junior High {{has offered}} {{accelerated}} biology and physics classes (where {{students are able}} to take high school biology in 8th grade and high school physics in 9th grade) since the 2013-2014 school year. However, after a 2015-2016 pilot program at Stonegate Elementary and Central Junior High involving hands-on projects and <b>project-based</b> learning, the school was officially designated a STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) School of Choice for the 2016-2017 school year. The program continues through the high school level at the Buinger Career and Technical Education Academy with many STEM classes such as Engineering Design and Honors Aerospace.|$|E
25|$|Harel's {{research}} at the Harvard Graduate School of Education and the MIT Media Lab in the 1980s led to the 1991 publication of Children Designers, which won the 1991 Outstanding Book Award from the American Education Research Association, with an introduction by Harel's research collaborator, constructivist researcher Seymour Papert. Children Designers {{presents the results of}} Harel's research in which she introduced disadvantaged fourth-grade children from the Boston area to the Logo programming language, and facilitated their creation of mathematical software applications that would help third-grade peers learn fractions. Children Designers suggested implementations within schools that emphasize this <b>project-based</b> and student-centered approach.|$|E
25|$|Connected {{learning}} {{has been a}} term used in research since the early 1990s. The original usages piggybacked {{on the concept of}} , which emphasized the importance of context in the development of knowledge for women. Many articles from this time used the term connected learning in reference to hands-on education like fieldwork or internships which is tied to the concept of learning in context. The early research that used the term connected learning also shared the common theme of sociality being important to learning outcomes. From 2000, the term connected learning began to be used in research publications to refer variously to <b>project-based,</b> networked, social, and information-age learning.|$|E
25|$|AAST {{was founded}} on a charter school {{framework}} in 1992 with the mission of preparing students for careers {{in math and science}} by promoting a problem-solving, <b>project-based,</b> technical learning environment. AAST has departed from this model and has since become a more standard magnet school. The roots of the program can be seen in its unique science curriculum, which emphasizes and integrates chemistry, biology, and physics, and its hallmark Wednesday lab rotation for the first two years. This academy celebrated ten years of excellence in 2006-07. Much of the AAST model, including the 6-mod project period on Wednesday, has been adopted by the other academies.|$|E
25|$|Vancouver Board of Education's {{gifted program}} is called Multi-Age Cluster Class or MACC. This is a {{full-time}} program for highly gifted elementary students from grades 4 to 7. Through <b>project-based</b> learning, students are challenged to use higher order thinking skills. Another focus {{of the program is}} autonomous learning; students are encouraged to self-monitor, self-reflect and seek out enrichment opportunities. Entrance to the program is initiated through referral followed by a review by a screening committee. IQ tests are used but not exclusively. Students are also assessed by performance, cognitive ability tests, and motivation. There are 4 MACC's in Vancouver: grade 4/5 and grade 6/7 at Sir William Osler Elementary, grade 5/6/7 at Tecumseh Elementary, and a French Immersion grade 5/6/7 at Kerrisdale Elementary.|$|E
25|$|University {{interpretation}} and up-to-date understanding of export control regulations {{and willingness to}} seek opinions from the U.S. State Department affect the research that can be conducted on their campuses; for example, the University of Michigan successfully obtained an opinion from the Department of State stating that satellite development work on an (at the time) ITAR-controlled satellite being conducted by a student group containing both U.S. and non-U.S. citizens was considered fundamental research and was allowed to proceed. In contrast, as of March 2016, Stanford's Export Control Officer maintains that all satellite systems are controlled defense articles under the ITAR (despite their reclassification under the EAR in 2014) and, based on NASA criteria for automatic designation of a research project as fundamental research, does not consider projects above TRL 4 to be fundamental research, limiting the activities of laboratories and <b>project-based</b> groups on campus. This and similar policies are particularly damaging to international students studying aerospace engineering or related fields at U.S. universities, as opportunities to gain practical experience in their studies through internships are, due to licensing requirements, typically not offered to them at U.S. aerospace companies, and on-campus projects, when allowed, offer an alternate route for developing skills like those obtained through internships and co-op programs.|$|E
500|$|Kagame's image amongst {{international}} observers is varied. Human rights organisations, including Amnesty International and Freedom House, {{claim that}} Kagame hamstrings his opposition by restricting candidacies in elections to government-friendly parties, suppressing demonstrations, and arresting opposition leaders and journalists. Human Rights Watch and Freedom House have accused Kagame of using strict laws criminalizing [...] "divisionism" [...] (ethnic hatred) and genocide ideology to silence his critics, {{to the point}} that Rwanda is a de facto one-party state. [...] It has praised some aspects of Kagame's rule, such as the progress made in the delivery of justice and the abolition of the death penalty. Other progressive initiatives include supporting a UN declaration on LGBT rights, as well as the world's highest representation of women in parliament. Kagame's image amongst foreign leaders was very positive until the late 2000s. He was credited with ending the genocide, bringing peace and security to Rwanda, and achieving development. Since 2010, the international community has increasingly criticized Kagame following a leaked United Nations report alleging Rwanda's support for the rebel M23 movement in Congo. In 2012, the United Kingdom, Germany, the Netherlands and several other countries suspended programmes of budget support to Rwanda, with many redirecting their aid to <b>project-based</b> assistance.|$|E
2500|$|Most {{educators}} {{agree that}} [...] "global citizenship is a learned and nurtured behavior", {{and the most}} widely used classroom strategy for developing global skills is <b>project-based</b> learning. This pedagogical technique can be utilized in the case of almost any school subject, [...] " [...] is the primary pedagogical strategy in the discourse of global competencies. Educators see it as an important method for developing the tools- technical and emotional- for success in the global society". With the aim of nurturing students' potential to be both learners and citizens, the <b>project-based</b> approach has been used successfully in community-based learning, for example.|$|E

Diablo High School, opened in 1901 and {{currently}} home to four academies, including the Digital Safari Academy, a three-year program involving the integration of multimedia with the core curriculum through integrated, <b>project-based</b> learning.|$|E
2500|$|The School of Environmental Studies is an {{optional}} two-year {{high school in}} Apple Valley, Minnesota, United States. Also known as the [...] "Zoo School" [...] because of its active partnership with the Minnesota Zoo and its 12-acre (48,000 m²) site on zoo property, the school embraces <b>project-based</b> learning with an environmental theme.|$|E

Among the most prominent projects are , , surveys conducted off Normandy Beaches, and the search for [...] UAB also oversees, supports, and issues archaeological permits to third-party researchers. Finally, the Branch seeks to encourage research and development in related science and technology fields which in turn contribute to Navy <b>project-based</b> training.|$|E
2500|$|Movie {{production}} incentives {{do not necessarily}} result {{in the creation of}} jobs. [...] Rather, the economic impact is that of a transfer of jobs from one location or state to another. [...] Additionally, unless the state in question has a consistent stream of productions, the <b>project-based</b> nature of the film and television industry generates short-term jobs that eventually leave specialized laborers out of work.|$|E
2500|$|According to Yoichi Wada, the {{development}} department was reorganized {{away from the}} Product Development Division System by March 2007 into a <b>project-based</b> system. Until 2013, the teams {{in charge of the}} Final Fantasy and Kingdom Hearts series were still collectively referred to as the [...] The 1st Production Department was formed from the fall 2010 combination of Square Enix's Tokyo and Osaka development studios, with Shinji Hashimoto as its corporate executive.|$|E
2500|$|The University {{created the}} {{interdisciplinary}} [...] through the [...] department {{as a program}} for students to experience the aspects of sustainability through different lenses. This holistic approach {{to the study of}} sustainability will allow students of all academic backgrounds to learn not only about the environmental dimensions of sustainability, but also the societal and economic impacts. The minor also requires students to participate in a <b>project-based</b> action learning class designed to apply their classroom lessons to real sustainability issues.|$|E
2500|$|The CDM and JI {{are called}} [...] "project-based mechanisms," [...] {{in that they}} {{generate}} emission reductions from projects. The difference between IET and the <b>project-based</b> mechanisms is that IET {{is based on the}} setting of a quantitative restriction of emissions, while the CDM and JI are based on the idea of [...] "production" [...] of emission reductions. [...] The CDM is designed to encourage production of emission reductions in non-Annex I Parties, while JI encourages production of emission reductions in Annex I Parties.|$|E
2500|$|Merriam School. Named for Florence A. Merriam {{who taught}} for 35 years in Acton. Merriam offers a <b>project-based</b> curriculum. At Merriam, {{teachers}} teach {{the same group}} of students for two years (i.e., a teacher will teach first grade one year, second grade the next and then wrap back to first). This practice is called [...] "looping". Merriam School is housed in the Parker Damon Building which it shares with the McCarthy-Towne school. At Merriam as well as at McCarthy-Towne, students call their teachers by their first names.|$|E
2500|$|As a result, {{schools with}} an IP allow their {{students}} to skip the [...] "O" [...] levels at Secondary 4 and go straight into junior colleges (JCs) in Year 5/JC1. The Integrated Programme with the revised Singapore-Cambridge GCE [...] "A" [...] levels or the IB Diploma as a terminal qualification has become an increasingly popular alternative to the standard secondary education pathway. This is because it is perceived as having {{moved away from the}} usually heavy emphasis on the sciences, a phenomenon resulting from the post-independence need for quick and basic technical and industrial education; to subjects in the arts and humanities. Such programmes are more <b>project-based</b> and students are expected to be independent learners.|$|E
2500|$|WPI's <b>project-based</b> {{curriculum}} {{makes it}} unique by requiring undergraduate students {{to complete a}} Sufficiency in the Liberal Arts (or a Technical Sufficiency for liberal arts majors), an Interactive Qualifying Project (IQP) to study the social effects of technology with students from other disciplines, and a Major Qualifying Project (MQP) within their own discipline. These projects are based on WPI's founding principle of theory alongside practice, though were introduced in the last 40 years. Usually, the Sufficiency, IQP, and MQP are completed in the sophomore, junior, and senior years, respectively. The MQP is similar to other schools' [...] "senior thesis," [...] while the IQP {{is a bit more}} unusual and sometimes difficult to explain on resumes.|$|E
2500|$|Presently, TSE trades {{mainly in}} {{securities}} offered by listed companies. As of 2015, equities and corporate bonds (e.g. Sukuk) are being traded at TSE. The {{plan is to}} introduce other financial instruments in the near future. The introduction of <b>project-based</b> participation certificates that bear a fixed annual return {{during the period of}} the project and promise the final settlement of the profit at the date of its completion, has diversified the market. As of 2015, TSE does not offer much complicated Islamic finance instruments such as derivatives (except ETFs and a few put options), nor does it allow [...] short sales or margin trading (except for futures) in contrast to the neighboring Dubai Financial Market.|$|E
2500|$|Project {{entrepreneurs}} are {{individuals who are}} engaged in the repeated assembly or creation of temporary organizations. These are organizations that have limited lifespans which are devoted to producing a singular objective or goal and get disbanded rapidly when the project ends. Industries where <b>project-based</b> enterprises are widespread include: sound recording, film production, software development, television production, new media and construction. What makes project-entrepreneurs distinctive from a theoretical standpoint {{is that they have}} to [...] "rewire" [...] these temporary ventures and modify them to suit the needs of new project opportunities that emerge. A project entrepreneur who used a certain approach and team for one project may have to modify the business model and/or team for a subsequent project.|$|E
2500|$|With {{the rise}} of the Internet, many new career paths were created. Before the rise, many {{technical}} jobs were seen as nerdy. The Internet led to creative work that was seen as laid-back and diverse amongst sex, race, and sexual orientation. Web design, gaming design, webcasting, blogging, and animation are all creative career paths that came with this rise. At first glance, the field of new media may seem hip, cool, creative and relaxed. [...] What many don't realize is that working in this field is tiresome. Many of the people that work in this field don't have steady jobs. Work in this field has become <b>project-based.</b> Individuals work project to project for different companies. Most people are not working on one project or contract, but multiple ones at the same time. Despite working on numerous projects, people in this industry receive low payments, which is highly contrasted with the techy millionaire stereotype. It may seem as a carefree life from the outside, but it is not. [...] New media workers work long hours for little pay and spend up to 20 hours a week looking for new projects to work on.|$|E
2500|$|ASU's {{academic}} programs are spread across campuses in the Phoenix Metropolitan Area; however, unlike most multi-campus institutions, ASU describes itself as [...] "one university in many places," [...] inferring there is [...] "not {{a system with}} separate campuses, and not one main campus with branch campuses." [...] The university considers each campus [...] "distinctive" [...] and academically focused on {{certain aspects of the}} overall university mission. The Tempe campus is the university's research and graduate school center. Undergraduate studies on the Tempe campus are research-based programs designed to prepare students for graduate school, professional school, or employment. The Polytechnic campus is designed with an emphasis on professional and technological programs for direct workforce preparation. The Polytechnic campus is the location of many of the university's simulators and laboratories dedicated for <b>project-based</b> learning. The West campus is focused on interdisciplinary degrees and the liberal arts, while maintaining professional programs with a direct impact on the community and society. The Downtown campus focuses on direct urban and public programs such as nursing, public policy, criminal justice, mass communication, and journalism. ASU recently relocated some nursing and health related programs to its new ASU-Mayo Medical School campus. Inter-campus shuttles and light rail allow students and faculty to easily travel between the campuses. In addition to the physical campuses, ASU's [...] "virtual campus", housed at the university's SkySong Innovation Center, provides online and extended education.|$|E
2500|$|In early 2000, Bekele {{broke off}} from her {{corporate}} career to focus on international technology issues and third-world technological development using Africa as a base model. Most of Bekele's work in these years {{has been associated with}} CBS International, a company she founded and served as President and Chief Executive Officer. CBS International is a California-based consulting company with focus on technology transfer to emerging markets. Primarily, the company provided international technology procurement, <b>project-based</b> capacity building, technological project management, internet/intranet systems integration and Internet related solutions. [...] As an affiliate, Bekele set up SbCommunications Network, plc, (SbCnet), based in Addis Ababa, specializing in technology integration and support services. Bekele was interested to do nation building projects that have high impact and yield to benefit society. Through her companies, she expressed interest and participated and won international contracts for large scale projects such as the information technology infrastructure for the Organization of African Unity (AU) General Secretariat and an integrated data networking infrastructure for the Ethiopian parliament, House of Peoples’ Representatives and House of Federation. The AU project was an e-government Internet-working project initiative, sponsored by UNDP (United Nations Development Programme) involving the implementation of a complex fiber-optic-based information technology campus wide area network infrastructure and considered one of the largest IT projects in the Country at the time.
