As was typical for the period, {{the children were}} infrequently seen by the king and queen; Finch was the unvarying adult figure in their lives. While the royal princes endured disciplined lessons in an austere educational environment, Finch was loved by her female charges. They affectionately referred to her as [...] "Lady Cha", and upon returning {{from a trip to}} the continent in 1771, Queen Charlotte wrote her, [...] "They can never be in better hands than yours". Shefrin says that Finch [...] "supervised a progressive nursery focused on child-centred learning" [...] and shared a <b>passion</b> <b>for</b> <b>education</b> with Queen Charlotte, as is evident in their correspondence and the writings of contemporaries; the idea of noble mothers encouraging education for their children – a concept advocated by educators and scholars – was becoming popular, and Finch's approach at court helped spread these new educational theories.

40|$|The goal of {{this study}} was to examine the {{development}} of <b>passion</b> <b>for</b> the profession of family and consumer sciences (FCS) in three undergraduate students majoring in FCS education. The first purpose was to ascertain an understanding of participants 2 ̆ 7 identification with FCS education and their decisions to declare it as a major. The second purpose was to examine the participants 2 ̆ 7 knowledge of the content with an understanding of the integrative nature of the FCS profession. The third purpose was to identify the participants 2 ̆ 7 motivation and <b>passion</b> <b>for</b> being FCS educators.;Narrative inquiry was used to investigate the participants 2 ̆ 7 lived experiences of the journey to FCS education. Themes that emerged included: pivotal moments in the journey, first exposure to FCS, advising and academic experiences in FCS, family background and influences, God 2 ̆ 7 s plan <b>for</b> selecting FCS <b>education,</b> participants 2 ̆ 7 interpretations of the mission of the FCS profession, their development of personal missions, benefits of being FCS educators, <b>passion</b> <b>for</b> FCS, and commitment to FCS education.;A result of the research was the development of the process of developing <b>passion</b> <b>for</b> family and consumer sciences education model. The model depicts five steps in the process of developing <b>passion</b> <b>for</b> FCS <b>education.</b> The first step, identify, involved identifying FCS education as a program of study. The second step, knowledge, required that participants develop knowledge of the FCS content with an understanding of the integrative nature of the FCS profession. The third step, personal and professional alignment, involved participants interpreting the mission of the profession, internalizing those interpretations, and developing personal missions aligned with their interpretations. Motivation was the fourth step in the process of developing <b>passion</b> <b>for</b> FCS <b>education.</b> Alignment with the profession 2 ̆ 7 s mission and personal interpretations of that mission provided the motivation for the participants to pursue FCS education. This motivation led to the development of commitment, the fifth step in the process of developing <b>passion</b> <b>for</b> FCS <b>education.</b> As the researcher, I am led to believe that passionate professionals are more likely to demonstrate their commitment to the profession and that passion will be the propelling force that motivates them to become advocates for anything that may challenge their personal and professional missions. Developing <b>passion</b> <b>for</b> FCS <b>education</b> is a process beginning with the first step of identifying the FCS education major. Passion continues to develop as one progresses through the aforementioned five steps.;This study reveals the importance of providing inspiring educational and advising experiences within programs of study at the undergraduate level and encouraging the development of commitment in future professionals who will become leaders in their chosen fields...|$|R
