50|$|<b>Pindone</b> is an {{anticoagulant}} drug for agricultural use. It {{is commonly used}} as a rodenticide {{in the management of}} rat and rabbit populations.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{group of}} VKAs are 1,3-indandione derivatives. <b>Pindone,</b> chlorophacinone, and diphacinone {{are used as}} rodenticides. They are {{categorised}} as [...] "first-generation" [...] anticoagulants, and have similar effects as warfarin. They have been largely superseded by second-generation anticoagulants because warfarin-resistant rodents have become more common.|$|E
50|$|The spotted harrier {{is mostly}} {{threatened}} by clearing and degradation of suitable foraging and breeding habitat. These threats also extend to key prey species affecting prey densities. Clearing and grazing of breeding sites {{are a key}} threat alongside secondary poisoning from rodenticides and <b>pindone,</b> a poison used in the control of rabbits.|$|E
50|$|<b>Pindone,</b> diphacinone, and {{coumatetralyl}} are the first-generation anticoagulants {{most commonly}} used for pest control. They are generally very effective at controlling rats to keep their numbers low, but cannot effectively deal with sudden population surges. Anticoagulants break down very slowly in water and soil. They also accumulate in the liver tissue of live animals that {{have been exposed to}} the poison (either by eating bait or feeding on an animal that has eaten bait) and in carcasses. They are also the most inhumane of the poisons currently used. By-kill of native species is a significant risk from the use of first-generation anticoagulants. Different types of anticoagulants need to be rotated to avoid populations becoming bait-shy or building up resistance.|$|E
5000|$|Poisoning is {{probably}} the most widely used of the conventional techniques, as it requires the least effort, and capable of destroying a local population, though of course re-infestation by the highly mobile pest is almost inevitable. Laying baits of pollard laced with a phosphorus-based poison, such as [...] "S.A.P." [...] manufactured by Sayers, Allport & Potter, was an early method. The advantage of phosphorus is that in dry weather, assuming it has not been laid in clumps (obviated by use of a poison cart), it soon degrades to innocuous phosphoric acid and presents no further danger to livestock or pets. It does, however, present a real fire risk, and concentrated fumes can be toxic to operators.More modern poisons for rabbit control are sodium fluoroacetate ("1080") and <b>pindone.</b>|$|E
50|$|Large-scale rat control {{programs}} {{have been taken to}} maintain a steady level of the invasive predators in order to conserve the native species in New Zealand such as kokako and mohua. Pesticides, such as <b>pindone</b> and 1080 (sodium fluoroacetate), are commonly distributed via aerial spray by helicopter as a method of mass control on islands infested with invasive rat populations. Bait, such as brodifacoum, is also used along with coloured dyes in order to kill and identify rats for experimental and tracking purposes. Another method to track rats is the use of wired cage traps, which are used along with bait, such as rolled oats and peanut butter, to tag and track rats to determine population sizes through methods like mark-recapture and radio-tracking. Poison control methods are effective in reducing rat populations to nonthreatening sizes, but rat populations often rebound to normal size within months. Besides their highly adaptive foraging behavior and fast reproduction, the exact mechanisms for their rebound is unclear and are still being studied.|$|E
40|$|The {{sensitivity}} {{of a number}} of avian species to the rabbit poison <b>pindone</b> (2 -pivalyl- 1, 3 -indandione) was investigated using increase of prothrombin time (PT) as an index of poisoning. Daily dose levels of <b>pindone</b> were 0. 25 mg/kg for eagles, 4. 0 mg/kg for magpies and 5. 0 mg/kg for pigeons, parrots and ducks. Considerable species variation in response was observed, and within each species there was considerable individual variation in response to <b>pindone.</b> The PTs of magpies and ducks increased to approximately twice baseline levels. Significant elevations (4 - to 7 -fold) occurred in parrots, pigeons and eagles. Clinical symptoms were observed in only one species, the wedge-tailed eagle. Results of dosing trials indicate that all species tested are theoretically at risk of <b>pindone</b> poisoning, although the risk to some species is minimised by factors such as population size, food availability and bait placement...|$|E
40|$|The Little Eagle Hieraaetus morphnoides {{is declining}} {{in parts of}} {{south-eastern}} Australia, including the Australian Capital Territory (ACT), even though the number of European Rabbits Oryctolagus cuniculus is increasing. A non-pathogenic lagovirus related to Rabbit Haemorrhagic Disease Virus (RHDV) is protecting rabbits from RHD in cooler areas of south-eastern Australia. Consequently, the chemicals <b>Pindone</b> (2 -pivalyl, 3 -indandione) and 1080 (sodium fl uoroacetate) are used to poison rabbits, and <b>Pindone</b> may disable raptors and/or be fatal to them. Little Eagles take proportionally more rabbits than do Wedge-tailed Eagles Aquila audax, so Little Eagles may be more affected by secondary poisoning. We recommend that (i) the Little Eagle be uplisted from vulnerable to endangered in the ACT, and (ii) <b>Pindone</b> be banned in Little Eagle home ranges in the ACT...|$|E
40|$|The {{toxicity}} of <b>pindone,</b> a rabbit poison, to horses, cattle, goats, chickens, {{dogs and cats}} was investigated, using extension of prothrombin time (PT) as an index of poisoning. The daily dose of <b>pindone,</b> administered for 5 days, ranged from 0. 3 mg/kg for dogs to 2. 5 mg/kg for chickens. This range of dose rates {{was considered to be}} indicative of the worst possible case that could arise following a campaign of baiting for rabbits. Although significant elevations in PT (more than double baseline values) were noted in all species other than horses, clinical signs of anticoagulant poisoning were not observed in any of the species tested. From the observed PT, cattle and cats appeared to be the most susceptible, and horses the least susceptible, to <b>pindone</b> toxicity. The half-lives of the elevated PT were calculated as 3. 1 days for cattle, 2. 8 days for goats and chickens, 1. 9 days for horses and dogs and less than one day for cats. It is proposed that these half-lives {{can be used as a}} guide for determining the duration of treatment of pindone-affected animals...|$|E
40|$|Toxins {{are a major}} {{component}} of rabbit control campaigns in New Zealand, with sodium monofluoroacetate (1080) being the primary toxin in use since the 1950 s. However, landowners can use 1080 only under the direct supervision of a licensed operator, and rabbit populations in regularly-poisoned areas have become increasingly resistant to this form of control. A new, cost-effective toxin that does not cause persistent residues in livestock is required by landowners who wish to undertake their own rabbit control. Several recent trials have demonstrated the potential of the anticoagulant <b>pindone</b> (2 -pivalyl-l, 3 -indandione) to meet these requirements. In 1992, the New Zealand Pesticides Board granted full registration to cereal <b>pindone</b> pellets, so {{that for the first time}} the New Zealand public has access to a rabbit bait that does not require a licence for its use. The bait is being used with apparent success in a wide range of situations, with sales of the product exceeding 100 ton in 1993...|$|E
40|$|Small {{vertebrate}} pests such as possums, rodents, mustelids {{and rabbits}} are routinely poisoned using toxins such as sodium monofluoroacetate (1080), brodifacoum, <b>pindone,</b> cholecalciferol, and cyanide.

This report describes the rate of cyanide loss from Feratox® capsules in feed paste...|$|E
40|$|Many rural Australians have a {{dread of}} rabbits. If they see {{one or two}} on their {{property}} they have visions of hoards of rabbits teeming over the land, eating all available vegetation, undermining trees and bushes, and destroying everything in sight. Indeed rabbits {{have been a major}} problem in many agricultural areas in the past and efforts to eradicate them have included the introduction of the viruses Myxomatosis in 1950 and calicivirus since 1995. Although calicivirus has been successful in significantly reducing rabbit numbers, some survive and landholders are now ever vigilant of rabbits for fear they may again reach plague proportions. Their efforts in this regard are aided in NSW by the Livestock Health and Pest Authorities (LHPA) in areas where it deems rabbits are too numerous. The LHPA uses calicivirus, poisons such as 1080 and <b>pindone,</b> and habitat destruction, in conjunction with councils and landholders. Most recently the LHPA has been active in coastal areas of southern NSW, promoting the use of <b>pindone</b> to kill rabbits and training local landholders t...|$|E
40|$|Measurement of indandione rodenticides is {{important}} in the diagnosis and treatment of accidental rodenticide ingestion. Current assays lack effective measurements for simultaneous analysis of the indandiones, especially the isomers. The intent {{of this study was to}} establish a novel and selective method for the simultaneous determination of indandione-type rodenticides (diphacinone, chlorophacinone, valone, and <b>pindone)</b> in human serum by liquid chromatography–electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry. After addition of internal standard, the sample was extracted with 10 % methanol in acetonitrile and cleaned by solid-phase extraction (SPE). The analytes were separated on a C 18 rapid column and infused into an ion trap mass spectrometer in the negative electrospray ionization mode. The multiple-reaction monitoring ion pairs were m/z 339 → 167, m/z 373 → 201, m/z 229 → 145, m/z 229 → 172, and m/z 307 → 161 for diphacinone, chlorophacinone, valone, <b>pindone,</b> and IS, respectively. Recoveries were between 81. 5 and 94. 6 %, and the limits of quantification were 0. 2 to 0. 5 ng/mL. Intra- and interday RSDs were less than 7. 9 and 11. 5 %, respectively. The assay was linear in the range of 0. 5 – 100. 0 ng/mL with coefficients of determination (r 2 > 0. 99) for all analytes. The proposed method enables the unambiguous confirmation and quantification of the indandiones in both clinical and forensic specimens...|$|E
40|$|Poison {{operations}} are a widely used technique for rodent {{control in the}} indigenous forests of New Zealand. This study examined the bait-take and rat monitoring data obtained for continuous poison operations at Boundary Stream Mainland Island (BSMI), Hawke’s Bay, between 1996 and 2007. Since {{the beginning of the}} Mainland Island project at BSMI in 1996, 800 ha of indigenous forest have been treated with an ‘Integrated Pest Management’ approach, in which rodents (primarily ship rats) have been targeted by consecutive ground poison operations. The aim of the intensive pest control was to allow the ecosystem to recover and provide a safe environment for threatened native bird species to recover or be re-introduced. Another important aim of this pest control is to provide experience and expert knowledge in management techniques especially applicable to the protection of indigenous habitat on the New Zealand mainland. This research study had two main aims: to identify spatial patterns of the rodent population at BSMI and to determine the efficacy of the different rodenticides applied for their control. The distribution of the rodent population was investigated by spatial analysis of bait-take across the reserve and through time. Visualisation of high and low bait-take areas revealed that there was a noticeable reinvasion from adjacent unmanaged native forests, but not markedly from exotic forest or pasture. Reinvasion from small and isolated adjacent forests ceased to be noticeable consistently after approximately four years of the poison operation, while a large scenic native reserve, as well as a narrow part of the treatment area surrounded by many native bush patches, were continuously affected by reinvasion through the entire project time. Bait-take was visibly higher after the bait had either been removed, or left in the field unserviced, over winter. No consistent areas of no bait-take were identified. Further statistical analysis of bait-take data revealed that bait-take was higher in bait stations within 150 m of the treatment edge than interior bait stations. Bait-take in broadleaf/tawa/podocarp forest was significantly higher than in kamahi/kanuka/rewarewa, beech and cloud-cap forest. The second aim {{of the study was to}} determine the efficacy of the various bait types with different active ingredients used during the operation. Rat monitoring data, namely rat tracking indices (RTI) obtained from tracking tunnels, were statistically modelled using Generalised Linear Models. Diphacinone cereal pellets (Pestoff® 50 D, 0. 05 g/kg diphacinone) obtained the lowest RTI, followed by <b>pindone</b> cereal pellets (<b>Pindone</b> Pellets®, 0. 5 g/kg <b>pindone),</b> brodifacoum cereal pellets (Pestoff® 20 p and Talon®, 0. 02 g/kg brodifacoum), coumatetralyl paste (Racumin®, 0. 375 g/kg) and diphacinone bait blocks (Ditrac®, 0. 05 g/kg). Cereal pellet baits worked better than any other bait type used at this location. Season had no statistically significant effect on either RTI or bait-take estimates. The overall goal of the poison operation to decrease rat numbers, and to maintain low levels, has been met. However, the results of this study suggest that baiting needs to be done continuously and over the entire treatment area. Edge bait stations – particularly next to adjacent native forests – should be prioritised to target reinvading rodents. Poisons presented in cereal pellet baits should be preferred to other bait types. Both <b>pindone</b> and brodifacoum showed very good results, as well as diphacinone in cereal pellet baits...|$|E
40|$|European rabbits in Australia have a {{significant}} impact on the environment and the economy. It is therefore necessary to implement control programs. In rural areas a number of methods including warren ripping and poisoning are frequently used. In urban areas though, rabbit control is not as easily accomplished because the use of many control methods is not appropriate. For example, the poison 1080 often cannot be used due to public health concerns and warren ripping cannot be used in conservation areas. Poisoning with <b>pindone,</b> an anticoagulant, is therefore one of few options available to the managers of urban reserves. However, the use of <b>pindone</b> is not without risks to wildlife and domestic animals. This study was conducted in Bold Park, Perth, Western Australia, as tt was recognised that rabbits have a tremendous impact on the bushland. The study investigated the use of bait stations during a bailing program and was designed to: assess the bait uptake from two different bait station designs; identify animals visiting the bait stations; and determine whether these animals showed a preference for one of the bait station designs. Prior to the field trials, oat seed viability studies were carried out to ensure that the oat seeds used as bait would not germinate in the field. To identify animals visiting the bait stations (through tracks and scats), bait stations were placed onto existing sand plots. The study showed that rabbits accepted bait stations and fed from both bait station types. Although they preferred the slab design the difference in visitation was not significant. Bird visitation to the drum design was significantly lower than to the slab design and rodents visited the drum more often than the slab design. From these results it was concluded that bait stations similar to the drum design should be used whenever bird poisoning is a concern. When small native mammals are present in the area, additional precautions should be taken to protect these animals from being poisoned. Also discussed are potential problems associated with the use of bait stations...|$|E
40|$|Summary: This paper {{describes}} {{the impact of}} nine poison operations on ship rats in four areas (35 ha to 3200 ha) of North Island forest. Poisoning with 1080, brodifacoum, or <b>pindone</b> killed 87 - 100 % of rats, based on trapping and tracking-tunnel indices. Rat populations took 4 - 5 months to recover. Operations to protect nesting birds should therefore coincide {{with the onset of}} nesting and be repeated each year, although not necessarily with the same methods. Population reduction declined each year at Mapara, King Country, during three annual 1080 operations which used the same lures and baits, but remained high at Kaharoa, Bay of Plenty, where poison toxicity was higher, non-toxic bait was pre-fed, and poisoning methods varied each year. Mouse tracking rates increased in poisoned forests 3 - 6 months after poisoning if the initial kill of rats exceeded 90 %, peaked 7 - 9 months after poisoning, then declined to pre-poison levels. Future research should focus on how prey and non-prey species within a forest community respond to a temporary reduction in rat numbers, and on methods to maintain low rat densities after initial knock-down. _________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________...|$|E
40|$|Rattus rattus is {{commonly}} known as the roof rat, black rat, and ship rat. Roof rats were common on early sailing ships and apparently arrived in North America by that route.

40|$|The {{house mouse}} (Mus musculus) is a small, slender rodent {{that has a}} {{slightly}} pointed nose; small, black, somewhat protruding eyes; large, sparsely haired ears; and a nearly hairless tail with obvious scale rings. House mice are considered among the most troublesome and economically important rodents in the United States. Effective prevention and control of house mouse damage involves three aspects: rodent-proof construction, sanitation, and population reduction by means of traps, toxicants, or fumigants. The first two are useful as preventive measures, but when a house mouse infestation already exists, some form of population reduction is almost always necessary.

40|$|There {{are about}} 3400 islands off the Western Australian coast, {{many of which}} have high nature {{conservation}} values. Eleven species of introduced mammals occur or occurred on 124 islands, including three domestic animals (horse, camel and sheep) that have not become feral. In addition, Aborigines introduced dingoes to at least four islands before European settlement. Six exotic mammals (red fox, feral cat, goat, rabbit, black rat and house mouse) have now been eradicated from more than 45 islands in a series of projects since the 1960 s. Most effort has been directed at black rats with more than 31 islands now clear of this species. <b>Pindone,</b> vacuum-impregnated into oats, was used until the 1990 s, when bran pellets with brodifacoum were used in the Montebello Islands. Rabbits have been eradicated using carrots soaked in sodium monofluoroacetate (1080), red foxes with dried meat baits impregnated with 1080 and cats with a combination of baiting and trapping. After a period of 20 years of ground shooting, goats were finally eradicated from Bernier Island using an experienced shooter operating from a helicopter. The house mouse has been eradicated from Barrow Island four times after introductions in food and equipment, and from Varanus and adjacent islands after introduction in food containers. Both islands are utilised by the petroleum industry. Difficulties and how they were overcome, and future eradication priorities, are discussed.

Also called the brown rat, house rat, barn rat, sewer rat, gray rat, or wharf rat, it is a slightly larger animal than the roof rat (Fig. 2). Adult Norway rats weigh {{an average of}} 1 pound (454 g). Their fur is coarse and usually brownish or reddish gray above and whitish gray on the belly. Blackish individuals occur in some locations. Among the diseases rats may transmit to humans or livestock are murine typhus, leptospirosis, trichinosis, salmonellosis (food poisoning), and ratbite fever.
