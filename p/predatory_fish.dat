5|$|The burbot, a <b>predatory</b> <b>fish</b> {{native to}} streams and lakes of North America and Eurasia, is also {{commonly}} mistaken for bowfin. Burbots {{can be distinguished}} by their flat head and chin barbel, long anal fin, and pelvic fins situated beneath the pectoral fins.|$|E
5|$|Negative {{effects on}} {{fisheries}} are mostly restricted to raiding by birds on aquaculture, although long-lining fisheries {{also have to}} deal with bait stealing. There have been claims of prey depletion by seabirds of fishery stocks, and while there is some evidence of this, the effects of seabirds are considered smaller than that of marine mammals and <b>predatory</b> <b>fish</b> (like tuna).|$|E
5|$|The cookiecutter shark uses {{bioluminescence}} to camouflage its underside by counterillumination, but a {{small patch}} near its pectoral fins remains dark, appearing as a small fish to large <b>predatory</b> <b>fish</b> like tuna and mackerel swimming beneath it. When such fish approach the lure, they are bitten by the shark.|$|E

50|$|I. strobilina inhabits marine waters, {{specifically}} {{those of}} the Caribbean Sea including {{off the coast of}} Florida, the Virgin Islands, Cuba and Venezuela. It is found in warm, shallow water, anchored to a substrate. This species is the most abundant sponge in the Abrolhos reef, where it grows exposed to many <b>predatory</b> <b>fishes.</b> The <b>predatory</b> <b>fishes</b> avoid I. strobilina, for reasons discussed below.|$|R
25|$|Other {{threats are}} sprawl of the Guaratuba and Matinhos urban areas, <b>predatory</b> <b>fishing</b> and buffalo farming.|$|R
5|$|The fairy shrimp {{is found}} in {{temporary}} pools of water, from seasonal ponds to muddy ruts, preferring sites with regular disturbance, such as passing tractors or livestock. It has {{a broad range of}} ecological tolerances, in terms of temperature, dissolved oxygen and pH, but cannot coexist with <b>predatory</b> <b>fish.</b> C. diaphanus swims with its ventral side upwards, and is a filter feeder, collecting zooplankton and detritus with its phyllopodia.|$|E
5|$|The slime glands {{along the}} body of the hagfish secrete {{enormous}} amounts of mucus when it is provoked or stressed. The gelatinous slime has dramatic effects on the flow and viscosity of water, rapidly clogging the gills of any fish that attempt to capture hagfish; predators typically release the hagfish within seconds (pictured above). Common predators of hagfish include seabirds, pinnipeds and cetaceans, but few fish, suggesting that <b>predatory</b> <b>fish</b> avoid hagfish as prey.|$|E
5|$|The {{green and}} golden bell frog occurs on three islands off {{the east coast}} of Australia: Kooragang and Broughton Islands off Port Stephens, and Bowen Island at Jervis Bay. It was {{introduced}} to New Zealand in the 1860s, and it is now common in the part of the North Island north of Rotorua. In most places, it is the only frog species in the vicinity. However, recent declines have been reported, suspected to be due to <b>predatory</b> <b>fish.</b> It was also introduced to the Pacific island countries of New Caledonia and Vanuatu in the 19th century, and has since become common there.|$|E

50|$|The {{main problem}} in the reserve is <b>predatory</b> <b>fishing,</b> which is {{estimated}} {{to take at least}} three tons of fish annually.The main threats in the region are logging and illegal mining.|$|R
5|$|Though not commercially {{important}} themselves, these {{forage fish}} support artisanal fisheries and local markets worldwide. They are also fed upon by other commercially important <b>predatory</b> <b>fishes,</b> such as billfishes, mackerels, and sharks.|$|R
5|$|Most terns hunt fish by diving, often {{hovering}} first, and {{the particular}} approach technique used can help to distinguish similar species at a distance. Sea terns often hunt in association with porpoises or <b>predatory</b> <b>fish,</b> such as bluefish, tuna or bonitos, since these large marine animals drive the prey to the surface. Sooty terns feed at night as the fish rise to the surface, and are believed {{to sleep on the}} wing since they become waterlogged easily. Terns of several species will feed on invertebrates, following the plough or hunting on foot on mudflats. The marsh terns normally catch insects in the air or pick them off the surface of fresh water. Other species will sometimes use these techniques if the opportunity arises. An individual tern's foraging efficiency increases with its age.|$|E
5|$|The {{best known}} {{cleaning}} symbioses are among marine fishes, where {{several species of}} small fish, notably of wrasse, are specialised in colour, pattern and behaviour as cleaners, providing a cleaning and ectoparasite removal service to larger, often <b>predatory</b> <b>fish.</b> Cleaner species, {{as shown in the}} table, vary widely in their degree of dependence on their clients. Some are essentially pure obligate symbionts like the cleaner wrasse; some are opportunistic or facultative symbionts, like the orange chromide or some cleaner shrimps; and some, like the oxpeckers, combine a little eating of parasites (beneficial to client) with taking of blood (harmful to client), their favoured food.|$|E
5|$|The larvae are {{themselves}} eaten by various {{animals such as}} carnivorous invertebrates and water birds, and are especially vulnerable to <b>predatory</b> <b>fish.</b> Adults generally avoid predators through their hidden lifestyle but are sometimes eaten by herons and other birds, snakes such as the grass snake, and mammals such as shrews, badgers and hedgehogs. They secrete the poison tetrodotoxin from their skin, albeit much less than for example the North American Pacific newts (Taricha). The bright yellow or orange underside of crested newts is a warning coloration which can be presented in case of perceived danger. In such a posture, the newts typically roll up and secrete a milky substance.|$|E
40|$|Prior to {{stocking}} economic {{species in}} tanks and nursery ponds, all the unwanted and <b>predatory</b> <b>fishes</b> in them {{will have to}} be removed. Even though most of them can be caught with ordinary gear such as cast net, drag net, scoop net etc. Total or absolute eradication is not possible and those left over are sufficient to destroy all the fingerlings introduced. Development of an electrical method for killing <b>predatory</b> <b>fishes</b> at reasonable cost is therefore, expected to provide a solution. This paper deals with a few methods, based on the use of electricity and which are suitable for different ponds...|$|R
50|$|Arowanas {{will eat}} insects, shrimp, frozen tilapia, frogs, etc. The best diet for arowanas is pellets, live crickets, and shrimp. Small feeder fish are often raised in poor {{conditions}} and can carry many diseases transmittable to <b>predatory</b> <b>fishes.</b>|$|R
50|$|They are {{marine fishes}} {{found in the}} Atlantic, Indian and Pacific Oceans. Most species are fast-swimming <b>predatory</b> <b>fishes</b> that hunt in the waters above reefs and in the open sea; some dig in the sea floor for invertebrates.|$|R
5|$|The {{major threat}} for crested and marbled newts is habitat loss. This {{concerns}} especially breeding sites, which are lost through the upscaling and intensification of agriculture, drainage, urban sprawl, and artificial flooding regimes (affecting {{in particular the}} Danube crested newt). Especially in the southern ranges, exploitation of groundwater and decreasing spring rain, possibly caused by global warming, threaten breeding ponds. Aquatic habitats are also degraded through pollution with agricultural pesticides and fertiliser. Introduction of crayfish and <b>predatory</b> <b>fish</b> threatens larval development; the Chinese sleeper {{has been a major}} concern in Eastern Europe. Exotic plants can also degrade habitats: the swamp stonecrop replaces natural vegetation and overshadows waterbodies in the United Kingdom, and its hard leaves are unsuitable for egg-laying to crested newts.|$|E
5|$|There are {{a number}} of non-infectious causes of {{inflammation}} of the gastrointestinal tract. Some of the more common include medications (like NSAIDs), certain foods such as lactose (in those who are intolerant), and gluten (in those with celiac disease). Crohn's disease is also a non-infectious source of (often severe) gastroenteritis. Disease secondary to toxins may also occur. Some food-related conditions associated with nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea include: ciguatera poisoning due to consumption of contaminated <b>predatory</b> <b>fish,</b> scombroid associated with the consumption of certain types of spoiled fish, tetrodotoxin poisoning from the consumption of puffer fish among others, and botulism typically due to improperly preserved food.|$|E
5|$|Habitat {{protection}} and management {{is seen as}} the most important element for the conservation of Triturus newts. This includes preservation of natural water bodies, reduction of fertiliser and pesticide use, control or eradication of introduced <b>predatory</b> <b>fish,</b> and the connection of habitats through sufficiently wide corridors of uncultivated land. A network of aquatic habitats in proximity is important to sustain populations, and the creation of new breeding ponds is in general very effective as they are rapidly colonised when other habitats are nearby. In some cases, entire populations have been moved when threatened by development projects, but such translocations need to be carefully planned to be successful. Strict protection of the northern crested newt in the United Kingdom has created conflicts with local development projects; at the same time, the charismatic crested newts are seen as flagship species, whose conservation also benefits a range of other amphibians.|$|E
50|$|The diet of {{the lake}} chub is varied: zooplankton, insects, aquatic insect larvae, and algae. The largest {{individuals}} can capture small fishes. The lake chub itself can be eaten by large <b>predatory</b> <b>fishes</b> and is therefore suitable as bait for fishing.|$|R
40|$|The {{magnitude}} of the influence that predators exert on their prey is partly determined by factors that influence the density and behaviour of predators, and partly by factors that influence the survival of prey {{in the presence of}} predators. We tested whether the presence of reefs influences the density of small <b>predatory</b> <b>fishes</b> inhabiting seagrass meadows, and the intensity of predation by these fishes on tethered crabs, by taking measurements at increasing distances from 10 rocky reefs at 2 locations separated by several hundred km. We also tested whether these variables were influenced by type of seagrass by comparing patterns yielded in meadows dominated by Amphibolis spp. and Posidonia sinuosa, 2 seagrasses with different morphological and architectural characteristics. The densities of small <b>predatory</b> <b>fishes</b> declined rapidly with increasing distance from reefs, with significantly lower densities 30 m from reefs than immediately adjacent to reefs. Densities 3 ̆e 300 m from reefs were generally not significantly different to densities 30 m from reefs. However, the survival of tethered crabs showed no consistent trend associated with distance from reefs. Type of seagrass was not a significant influence on the density of small <b>predatory</b> <b>fishes,</b> but did influence the survival of tethered crabs: those in Amphibolis spp. meadows were 3. 1 × more likely to be eaten than those in P. sinuosa meadows. These patterns were consistent between locations. Our results suggest that over landscape scales (hundreds of metres) reefs are an important influence on abundance of small <b>predatory</b> <b>fishes,</b> but not on the intensity of predation on crabs. Differences in the intensity of predation between the 2 seagrass species are likely due to their dissimilar morphological and architectural characteristics...|$|R

5|$|Amphibians have soft {{bodies with}} thin skins, and lack claws, {{defensive}} armour, or spines. Nevertheless, they have evolved various defence mechanisms to keep themselves alive. The {{first line of}} defence in salamanders and frogs is the mucous secretion that they produce. This keeps their skin moist and makes them slippery and difficult to grip. The secretion is often sticky and distasteful or toxic. Snakes have been observed yawning and gaping when trying to swallow African clawed frogs (Xenopus laevis), which gives the frogs an opportunity to escape. Caecilians have been little studied in this respect, but the Cayenne caecilian (Typhlonectes compressicauda) produces toxic mucus that has killed <b>predatory</b> <b>fish</b> in a feeding experiment in Brazil. In some salamanders, the skin is poisonous. The rough-skinned newt (Taricha granulosa) from North America {{and other members of}} its genus contain the neurotoxin tetrodotoxin (TTX), the most toxic non-protein substance known and almost identical to that produced by pufferfish. Handling the newts does not cause harm, but ingestion of even the most minute amounts of the skin is deadly. In feeding trials, fish, frogs, reptiles, birds and mammals were all found to be susceptible. The only predators with some tolerance to the poison are certain populations of common garter snake (Thamnophis sirtalis).|$|E
5|$|Many {{factors are}} thought to be {{responsible}} for the dramatic decline of this species in Australia, including habitat fragmentation, erosion and sedimentation of soil, insecticides and fertilisers contaminating water systems, the introduction of <b>predatory</b> <b>fish,</b> and alteration of drainage regimes. Population declines are closely related to the introduction of the eastern mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki), a species native to North America that was introduced to control mosquito larvae. Laboratory studies have demonstrated the eggs and tadpoles of the green and golden bell frog are extremely susceptible to predation by this fish, and in 77 of the 93 sites in New South Wales where the green and golden bell frog was known to have disappeared before 1990, eastern mosquitofish were found to be present. The frogs have been known to inhabit waters containing the fish, but breeding is rarely successful there, pointing to the fish's voracious eating of eggs and tadpoles. The fish are not yet present in eastern Victoria, where green and golden bell frog numbers have remained solid, but the fish likely will spread to rivers there, possibly inflicting heavy losses on the frogs.|$|E
5|$|The {{green and}} golden bell frog has been {{detected}} {{in a wide}} range of habitats. It is generally associated with coastal swamps, wetlands, marshes, dams, ditches, small rivers, woodlands, and forests, but populations have also been found at former industrial sites (for instance, the Brickpit). It has even been found in human vessels such as bathtubs. The requirements of its habitat have been difficult to determine, for it has been found {{in a wide range}} of water bodies except fast-flowing streams. It is most typically found in short-lived freshwater ponds that are still, shallow, unshaded, and unpolluted, and it tends to avoid waters that contain <b>predatory</b> <b>fish,</b> whether native or introduced. However, it is most often found in areas that have been affected by human habitation. The frog prefers water bodies that support emergent vegetation, such as reeds and bullrushes, for basking, and winter habitats consist of available shelters around the breeding site, which can be vegetation, rocks, rubbish, or human debris and discarded building materials. Grassy habitats are usually close at hand to provide suitable terrestrial feeding grounds. It prefers waterways with a substrate of sand, rock, or clay, and can tolerate a wide range of water turbidities, pH and oxygen levels, and temperatures, although these can hamper physical growth. Although its legs provide much grip, the frog does not choose to climb trees or live up them to any significant extent. It spends most of its time within 10cm of the ground and rarely ventures more than a metre above the ground. The green and golden bell frog also has the ability to sit still for several minutes.|$|E

5|$|Towards {{the end of}} the tadpole phase, {{hind legs}} appear, {{followed}} by front limbs, and the phase ends when the front limbs are developed. This normally occurs between October and April due to the breeding season, but tadpoles been observed in the wild throughout the year, suggesting some tadpoles overwinter; this has been seen to occur for captive tadpoles. The length of the tadpole stage, in the wild and in captivity, is usually between 10 and 12 weeks, but can range from five weeks to a year. The slower-growing tadpoles usually progress during winter, as there is a positive correlation between growth rates and temperatures. Variation in growth rate across pH values of 4, 7 and 9 was insignificant. In the first four weeks, there was no significant dependence of the growth rate across the 18–26°C range, but from this point on, growth was significantly hindered at 18°C. At the beginning of the metamorphing stage, all limbs are present and developed, along with a tail. During this phase, the tail is resorbed, and the only other visible change is the spiracle closing. Metamorphing tadpoles typically have a SVL of 22–28mm, and will complete metamorphosis between two and 11 months, depending on the temperature of the water and available food. The process is slowed at low temperatures, but generally takes between three and eight days after the tadpole stage is complete. Breeding occurs in a significantly higher proportion of sites where no <b>predatory</b> <b>fish</b> are present, and water bodies are ephemeral rather than permanent. Populations in Victoria, however, have been recorded as breeding in permanent ponds as readily as they do in ephemeral ponds.|$|E
