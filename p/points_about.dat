5|$|PlayStation Official Magazine - UK {{praised the}} story's {{blurring}} of Gallia's moral standing, art style, and most <b>points</b> <b>about</b> its gameplay, positively noting the latter for both its continued {{quality and the}} tweaks to balance and content. Its one major criticism were multiple difficulty spikes, something that had affected the previous games. Heath Hindman of gaming website PlayStation Lifestyle praised the addition of non-linear elements and improvements or removal of mechanics from Valkyria Chronicles II in addition to praising the returning gameplay style of previous games. He also positively noted the story's serious tone. Points criticized in the review were recycled elements, awkward cutscenes that seemed to include all characters in a scene for no good reason, pacing issues, and occasional problems with the game's AI.|$|E
5|$|Supporters {{said that}} the {{publication}} of the cartoons was a legitimate exercise of free speech regardless of the validity of the expression, {{that it was important to}} openly discuss Islam without fear or that the cartoons made important <b>points</b> <b>about</b> topical issues. The Danish tradition of relatively high tolerance for freedom of speech became a focus of some attention. The controversy ignited a debate about the limits of freedom of expression in all societies, religious tolerance and the relationship of Muslim minorities with their broader societies in the West, and relations between the Islamic World in general and the West. Critics of the cartoons described them as Islamophobic, racist, or baiting and blasphemous to Muslims, possibly intended to humiliate a Danish minority. Others saw them as a manifestation of ignorance about the history of Western imperialism, double standards, and stereotyping.|$|E
5|$|Today {{the clan}} {{is alive and}} lives as the Clan Maclachlan Society and the Lachlan Trust. The Clan Maclachlan Society {{consists}} of eight branches around the world, including Australia, Britain & Ireland, Canada, New Zealand, and the United States of America. The Lachlan Trust is a registered Scottish charitable organisation which takes donations to preserve the heritage of Clan Maclachlan. The trust, in part with Historic Scotland and the Heritage Lottery Fund, helped raise £100,000 {{for the preservation of}} Kilmorie Chapel, the traditional burying place of the chiefs. The project was completed in 2006, as a memorial to the twenty-fourth chief (the present chief's mother). Further funding from Historic Scotland and the Heritage Lottery Fund has since been approved for the conservation of the old castle and {{the construction of a new}} footbridge over the River Lachlan. Work began in the spring of 2013 with the erection of scaffolding around the west corner of the old castle. The plan is to develop the site for the enjoyment of visitors, with improved pathways, a nature trail and information <b>points</b> <b>about</b> the heritage of the area.|$|E

5|$|While {{the first}} {{interview}} was videotaped, {{at the beginning of}} the second interview, Lyons said that he wanted video recording to be stopped. It has been alleged that the decision to terminate the recording was prompted by the gardaí before the start of the second interview. A number of items discussed during the second interview were not included on the formal interview record, including anecdotes told by Lyons about his former criminal activity which gardaí believed at the time to be untrue. As the interview continued, Lyons was asked if he wanted to make a formal statement, to which he agreed. This statement contains a number of <b>points</b> <b>about</b> the killings that were not known to the public at the time. Some of the more glaring inaccuracies mentioned in {{the first interview}} are not included in the statement, although this statement contains some notable omissions and inaccuracies.|$|E
25|$|Ranking of liturgical {{days in the}} Roman Rite serves two purposes. The rank {{indicates}} {{some particular}} <b>points</b> <b>about</b> the liturgical manner of celebrating the day: for instance, the Mass of a Solemnity will include recitation or singing of the Gloria in Excelsis and the Creed; that {{of what is now}} called in a specific technical sense a Feast will have the Gloria but not the Creed. A Memorial will have neither, although it may have proper readings.|$|E
25|$|Wells's stories, on {{the other}} hand, use science fiction devices to make didactic <b>points</b> <b>about</b> his society. In The Time Machine (1895), for example, the {{technical}} details of the machine are glossed over quickly so that the Time Traveller can tell a story that criticizes the stratification of English society. The story also uses Darwinian evolution (as would be expected in {{a former student of}} Darwin's champion, Huxley), and shows an awareness of Marxism. In The War of the Worlds (1898), the Martians' technology is not explained as it would have been in a Verne story, and the story is resolved by a deus ex machina, albeit a scientifically explained one.|$|E

25|$|In February 2007, an {{open letter}} by Steve Jobs, Apple's then-CEO, {{discussed}} the use of DRM on music, raising <b>points</b> <b>about</b> {{the future of the}} protection and announcing the company's support for ending the use of DRM. Although the open letter initially caused mixed industry reactions, Apple signed a deal with a major record label the following month to offer iTunes customers a purchase option for a higher-quality, DRM-free version of the label's tracks. In January 2009, Apple signed deals with all major record labels as well as a large number of independent labels to offer all iTunes music in the DRM-free option. This does not apply to songs downloaded while using Apple Music, Apple's subscription-based music streaming service.|$|E
25|$|The {{restrictions}} {{imposed by}} FairPlay, mainly limited device compatibility, have sparked criticism, with a lawsuit alleging antitrust violation that was eventually closed in Apple's favor, and various successful efforts {{to remove the}} DRM protection from files, with Apple continually updating its software to counteract such projects.

25|$|Mary Lefkowitz has criticised this research. She {{suggests}} {{that some of the}} research was done not to determine the reliability of the dating method, as was suggested, but to back up an assumption of age and to make certain <b>points</b> <b>about</b> pyramids and Greek civilization. She notes that not only are the results not very precise, but that other structures mentioned in the research are not in fact pyramids, e.g. a tomb alleged to be the tomb of Amphion and Zethus near Thebes, a structure at Stylidha (Thessaly) which is just a long wall, etc. She also notes the possibility that the stones that were dated might have been recycled from earlier constructions. She also notes that earlier research from the 1930s, confirmed in the 1980s by Fracchia was ignored. She argues that they undertook their research using a novel and previously untested methodology in order to confirm a predetermined theory about the age of these structures.|$|E

25|$|A {{short time}} after {{entering}} the Columbia River and trading with the natives, ship and crew sailed to China {{to sell the}} pelts before returning to Boston in July 1793. Gray's entering of the Columbia was later used, during the Oregon boundary dispute, to support the American claim to the Oregon Country, against the claim of Britain. The American and British diplomats raised many points in addition to Gray's voyage to support their cases. Neither side could agree that the other had established a clear and exclusive right of sovereignty. The British raised several points questioning whether Gray's voyage up the Columbia River had any value in establishing sovereignty. The Americans raised counter-points. No agreement was reached on this and many other <b>points</b> <b>about</b> the right to the Oregon Country. In the end the dispute was resolved by compromise in the Oregon Treaty of 1846. Upon Gray’s return, though, little was thought of his discovery. He did not publish it, and the long-term consequences to which it contributed were unforeseen.|$|E

500|$|Hazlitt {{ends the}} chapter by making four <b>points</b> <b>about</b> genius, poetry, and {{especially}} tragedy. To David Bromwich {{the most important}} of these is the third, [...] "That the greatest strength of genius is shewn in describing the strongest passions: for the power of the imagination, in works of invention, must be in proportion to the force of the natural impressions, which are the subject of them." ...|$|E

He also idolized players such as Earl Monroe and Marques Haynes, and practiced [...] "all day." [...] Magic Johnson came from an athletic family. His father played high school basketball {{in his home state}} of Mississippi, and Johnson learned the finer <b>points</b> <b>about</b> the game from him. Johnson's mother, originally from North Carolina, had also played basketball as a child, and she grew up watching her brothers play the game.|$|E
500|$|In 1968, Enoch Powell {{delivered}} his [...] "Rivers of Blood" [...] {{speech in which}} he strongly criticised Commonwealth immigration to the United Kingdom and the then-proposed Race Relations Bill. When Heath telephoned Thatcher to inform {{her that he was}} going to sack Powell from the Shadow Cabinet, she recalled that she [...] "really thought that it was better to let things cool down for the present rather than heighten the crisis". She believed that his main <b>points</b> <b>about</b> Commonwealth immigration were correct and that his selected quotations from his speech had been taken out of context. In a 1991 interview for Today, Thatcher stated that she thought Powell had [...] "made a valid argument, if in sometimes regrettable terms".|$|E

When Leslie <b>points</b> <b>about</b> U.S. President Barack Obama has a foreign-sounding name, Tom gets upset. The reference to Obama's name was originally featured in a scene that was cut from Parks and Recreation pilot episode. Offerman, who barely moves and is often quiet throughout the episode, said he learned to use humor amid silence while serving as an altar boy and lector at his church. Offerman said, [...] "I had a cousin in the congregation, and I would speak with the utmost, august stoicism, and everyone would think I was a very effective speaker. But he knew I was being facetious. He'd get in trouble for cracking up." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{book was}} {{described}} as a [...] "slim, vivid novel" [...] with a [...] "very simple" [...] and [...] "fast paced" [...] plot line. A review in The Washington Times was positive: [...] "With a plot that takes Batman very seriously — and makes him very human — and a dismaying amount of information on the sexual exploitation of children for profit, this novel makes an ineradicable impression". Likewise, another reviewer found it [...] "an engaging and disturbing one-night read that's all the more astonishing because Vachss manages to explore and make his <b>points</b> <b>about</b> a wholly depressing topic without driving your moods into the sewer." [...] Roger Catlin in the Hartford Courant said [...] "Vachss' bold, simple prose is well suited to his story. He's good at making Batman's various devices — the Batmobile, computers, flying gizmos — come to life with his cool description." ...|$|E
500|$|Scattered {{throughout}} the chapters {{are more general}} critical discussions, such as that on tragedy in the essay [...] "Othello", comedy in [...] "Twelfth Night", and the value for human life of poetry in general, in [...] "Lear", among many others. Along the way, Hazlitt intersperses lengthy quotations from the plays, sharing with the reader poetic passages he thought particularly excellent. This practice resembled the by then common practice of collecting long extracts from the plays as the [...] "beauties" [...] of Shakespeare. Hazlitt, however, also adds critical commentary (though often far less extensive than would become the practice in later years), with the quotations illustrating particular <b>points</b> <b>about</b> the plays as well as sharing with his readers what he thought worthy of attention. All this, done as no one had before, made Characters of Shakespear's Plays the first handbook for the study and appreciation of all of Shakespeare's plays.|$|E
