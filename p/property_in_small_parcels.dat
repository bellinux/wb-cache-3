50|$|During {{the month}} of June the Montagnards played for time. Yet the Convention did not {{overlook}} the peasants. It was to these latter that the revolution of 31 May (like those of 14 July and 10 August) brought a substantial and permanent profit. On 3 June {{the sale of the}} <b>property</b> of emigrants, <b>in</b> <b>small</b> <b>parcels</b> and payable <b>in</b> ten years, was decreed; on the 10th, the optional division of common lands by head; and on 17 July, the abolition, without compensation, of all that remained of manorial rights.|$|R
50|$|Meanwhile, the Hudson's Bay Company {{decided to}} try its hand at farming. Douglas leased all of Vancouver Island for seven shillings a year from Great Britain, and had a {{division}} of the HBC, the Puget Sound Agricultural Company, come in to develop the land. The Viewfield farm was the first in 1850, with the Constance Cove farm and Craigflower farms added later. The Craigflower farmhouse still exists as a heritage site, as does the Craigflower schoolhouse built to serve the settlers' children. Thomas Mackenzie, the bailiff in charge of the farm, named it for the ancestral home of one of his superiors. By the mid-1860s, the farms were considered failures and abandoned, and the <b>property</b> sold off <b>in</b> <b>small</b> <b>parcels.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Around the 1950s, {{developers}} began creating subdivisions {{along the}} U.S.-Mexico border on agriculturally poor <b>properties,</b> divided land <b>in</b> <b>small</b> <b>parcels,</b> and provided few services; {{the development of}} the properties, intended for low income buyers, {{was the beginning of the}} Texas colonias. By 1995, the state passed laws against developing subdivisions without services. From 1995 and 2011, the office of the Texas Attorney General had 87 judgments against developers who created properties without services. The office of the Texas Attorney General said by 2011 that Texas had about 2,294 colonias and estimates that about 500,000 lived in the colonias. In Texas, Hidalgo County, as of 2011, has the largest number of colonias, though estimating their population is difficult: [...] "Getting an accurate count of the population in any of" [...] the state's colonias [...] "is notoriously difficult, due to geographic isolation, shared addresses, swiftly changing development and mistrust of government data collectors." ...|$|R
50|$|On an {{economic}} level, agriculture <b>in</b> <b>small</b> <b>parcels,</b> primarily subsistence <b>in</b> character, predominates this region, with {{the cultivation of}} corn and vineyards being the focus crops. In addition, civil construction, meat-processing charcuteira and saw-milling provide ancillary service economies to the region.|$|R
5000|$|Castro's {{grant was}} {{patented}} in 1865. [...] Soon after, Castro began {{to sell off}} his land to pay debts. The last of his holding was sold in a sheriff's sale in 1864 to Faxon Atherton. Atherton in turn began selling off his portion <b>in</b> <b>smaller</b> <b>parcels.</b>|$|R
50|$|Atherton (after {{whom the}} city of Atherton is named) in turn began selling off his portion <b>in</b> <b>smaller</b> <b>parcels.</b> Two gentlemen named Cull (the namesake of Cull Canyon) and Luce bought some 2,400 acres (10 km²) and began running a steam-operated saw mill in Redwood Canyon. The Jensen {{brothers}} also bought land from Atherton in 1867.|$|R
50|$|Webster {{eventually}} sold most of {{the square}} mile <b>in</b> <b>small</b> <b>parcels</b> for $9,000 each. The last parcel was purchased by Joseph Forman, a merchant from Troy, New York who had settled in Onondaga Hollow a few years earlier, for $6,250 on October 18, 1805. Forman {{was the father of}} a young lawyer named, Joshua Forman, who later founded the village of Syracuse.|$|R

50|$|Other historians {{supported}} the class conflict interpretation, {{noting that the}} states confiscated great semifeudal landholdings of Loyalists and gave them out <b>in</b> <b>small</b> <b>parcels</b> to ordinary farmers. Conservatives such as William Howard Taft were shocked at the Progressive interpretation because it seem to belittle the Constitution. History professors, however, mostly adopted it and by 1930 it became the standard interpretation of the era among them, but was largely ignored by the legal community.|$|R
50|$|In 1995 GoldenEye {{became the}} title of the seventeenth James Bond film, the first to star Pierce Brosnan. Blackwell {{gradually}} added 25 acre <b>in</b> <b>small</b> <b>parcels</b> to the original estate to reach a current total of 40 acre. As it grew, he also added various cottages and huts around an inner lagoon sandwiched between James Bond Beach and Low Cay Beach. In the late 1980s, he formed the Island Outpost Company and opened the property as a small hotel.|$|R
50|$|The {{fruit is}} harvested, {{fermented}} and matured <b>in</b> <b>small</b> <b>parcels,</b> where every {{decision is made}} to reflect the vintage and the journey of the individual barrique. Grading is a continuous activity from the vineyard, through maturation, until the final composition of each wine is determined, working from the Icon wines through to the Premier, Filius and Classics tiers. Bottling is completed within the Estate to ensure the most rigorous quality control and reduce unnecessary movement of the wine.|$|R
5000|$|The small priory {{was one of}} 16 nunneries {{exclusively}} for women founded between 1165 and 1215 in southern England. [...] By 1535, {{at the time of}} its dissolution, it was valued at only £29 12s. 10d, with a little over 250 acre <b>in</b> <b>small</b> <b>parcels</b> <b>in</b> 23 manors, two churches and three advowsons. The king granted it to John de Vere, 15th Earl of Oxford, with all its possessions in 1536. [...] No cartulary is known to have survived, only individual charters.|$|R
5000|$|LaserShip {{began as}} a {{document}} delivery service in 1986. In the 1990s, LaserShip landed <b>in</b> the <b>small</b> <b>parcel</b> business during the dot-com boom. In 1999, the company partnered with Barnes & Noble to provide same-day shipping services in New York City.|$|R
50|$|During the Confederacy Period of 1781-1789, the Continental Congress passed three {{ordinances}} whose {{authority was}} unclear regarding the region's governance on the American side. The Land Ordinance of 1784 established the broad outlines of future governance. The territory would {{be divided into}} six states, which would be given broad powers of constitutional instituting, and admitted to the nation as equal members. The Land Ordinance of 1785 specified {{the manner in which}} land would be distributed in the Territory, favoring sale <b>in</b> <b>small</b> <b>parcels</b> to settlers who would work their own farms.|$|R
5000|$|Following closing, the {{property}} was purchased by Harold L. Doty and some of {{the property}} was used for the [...] "Little Flower Children's Center". The pool, playgrounds, ball fields and other facilities were used by the day care center. The owners also lived on the property. After this use, {{the property was}} sold off <b>in</b> <b>smaller</b> <b>parcels</b> but about 30 acres was purchased for the Sri Guruvaayoorappan Temple. All buildings but one were demolished. One of the buildings was re-purposed and adapted for the Hindu-American Temple which currently occupies the campus.|$|R
50|$|The {{bulk of the}} <b>property</b> was {{acquired}} <b>in</b> the late 1960s from the estate of well known horse breeder Walter M. Jeffords, Sr. and his wife Sarah, a niece of Samuel D. Riddle. The Jeffords had acquired the land starting about 1912 <b>in</b> <b>small</b> <b>parcels,</b> until they had over 2000 acre, which was the largest private undeveloped <b>property</b> <b>in</b> the Philadelphia area by the 1960s. By 1918 they had built a large mansion, now the park office, around a stone colonial farmhouse. Twenty-four other historic properties were located on the grounds, many farmsteads that had retained family ownership since the seventeenth century. <b>In</b> 1976 these <b>properties</b> were registered on the National Register of Historic Places as a national historic district.|$|R
50|$|In 1921 and 1922, the {{government}} ordered these lands <b>parceled</b> and sold <b>in</b> <b>small</b> <b>parcels</b> for residential purposes. This was {{during a time}} period when the political climate favored workers demands for living space. Under President Álvaro Obregón, orders were given to acquire and partition lands for use by lower class inhabitants. There is little information about the early residents of the area except that they did have a homeowners’ association. These early residents bought their land in conjunction with {{the government}}, which gave them five years to pay off their debt. In return, the government installed services such as water and streets.|$|R
50|$|The couple {{made great}} {{improvements}} to both house and estate, particularly the laying-out {{of the formal}} garden in 1911. Specimen trees and many other varieties of plants were planted in the park. Sydney Elphinstone died in 1955 and his wife, Lady Mary, died six years later in 1961. Lady Mary bequeathed the tower to the Church of Scotland. The church used the tower as a conference centre where they built an annexe and a chapel in the park. Much of the estate was sold <b>in</b> <b>small</b> <b>parcels,</b> though {{most of it is}} in the ownership of the Buccleuch Estate.|$|R
50|$|The {{land that}} {{is now known as}} Branchburg Township was {{originally}} inhabited by the Raritans, a tribe of the Lenni Lenape Native Americans. By 1686 most of the land was purchased from the Lenape by the Lords Proprietors of East Jersey, who sold the land <b>in</b> <b>small</b> <b>parcels</b> to numerous settlers, mostly of Dutch or English extraction. With the 1688 redrawing of the boundary between East and West Jersey, the Branchburg region was split between Essex County to the north and the newly formed Somerset County to the south. With Somerset's acquisition of territory from Essex and Middlesex Counties in 1741, Branchburg lay entirely within Somerset County.|$|R
50|$|With its Soane {{interiors}} Wotton had {{a succession}} of Grenville occupiers until 1889, when the last direct male heir died. It was rented and then bought by Michael Beaumont (MP for Aylesbury) in 1929. He later moved to Kildare in Ireland {{and the house was}} sold to a charity. It was neglected down through the Second World War (when it was not requisitioned), but it was put up for sale shortly thereafter. After the war much of the grounds were sold <b>in</b> <b>small</b> <b>parcels</b> and <b>in</b> the early 1950s the building was used by two boys' boarding schools, Wotton House Boys' School followed by Cokethorpe School (since relocated to near Witney).|$|R
50|$|Between 1957 and 1980 {{there was}} a {{reallocation}} {{of land in the}} mountain forest which, after comprehensive and expensive survey work, resulted <b>in</b> 42 <b>small</b> <b>parcels</b> of land being consolidated into twelve larger ones. To commemorate this, a monument was erected in 2007 with a brass plate that records the names of all the participants.|$|R
50|$|Palms {{sold his}} land in lower Michigan <b>in</b> <b>small</b> <b>parcels</b> for a profit {{estimated}} to be between $300,000 and $400,000 and with the proceeds purchased pine and other forest lands in Michigan's Upper Peninsula and Wisconsin. He invested in the white pine areas near the Jump River in Wisconsin along with other successful businessmen including Ezra Cornell, Frederick Weyerhauser and Henry Sage, and in 1875, the men paid between $10 an acre up to $23.59. He also received land from a Pottawatomie chief, Chief Lerner, and continued to purchase more Indian Reserve lands as they became available. With these additions to his holdings, he became the largest landholder in Michigan (and possibly the U.S.) while in his late 20s.|$|R
5000|$|The {{notion of}} the ‘old moral economy’ is a fitting example of such conceptions. E. P. Thompson, in his work on 18th century England, {{described}} a society where [...] "notions of common well being, often supported by paternalistic traditional authorities, imposed some limits on the free operations of the market". Farmers were then not allowed to manipulate prices by withholding their products to wait for price increases. The actions of the middlemen were always considered legally suspect, were severely restricted and the poor were provided opportunities to buy staple foods <b>in</b> <b>small</b> <b>parcels.</b> Fair trade was already seen {{as a way to}} address market failures; although the concept mainly revolved around consumer, rather than producer, rights.|$|R
5000|$|Working {{from the}} present site, Ellicott not only oversaw the sale of {{individual}} properties but functioned as the area's sole regional planner, reporting to Paolo Busti, the company's agent in Philadelphia, by mail. He was, a contemporary historian wrote, [...] "the single most powerful person {{in the area for}} the first two decades of the century." [...] His decision to sell the land <b>in</b> <b>small</b> <b>parcels</b> rather than large blocks, despite the objections of the company's trustees who wanted the land sold quickly, resulted <b>in</b> settlement by <b>small</b> farmers rather than the establishment of quasi-feudal manors as had occurred in the Hudson Valley. Drawing on his experience laying out the city of Washington, D.C., for Pierre L'Enfant, he surveyed and planned the cities of Buffalo and Batavia.|$|R
60|$|We {{went away}} in the wild dawn, leaving the cabin desolate. We loaded the white mare with the pelts, and my father wore a woollen suit like that of our Scotch visitor, which I had never seen before. He had clubbed his hair. But, strangest of all, he carried <b>in</b> a <b>small</b> <b>parcel</b> the silk gown that had been my mother's. We had scant other baggage.|$|R

50|$|Timothy Dwight Hobart {{had great}} {{difficulty}} with the British government and the State of Texas in disposing of Mrs. Adair's property. The governments demanded tax payments which could be raised only with the sale of parts of the ranch {{at a time when}} the market for beef prices was particularly poor. The British demands required Hobart to make several trips abroad to explain the situation to the government agents. Hobart said his greatest concern was in meeting the needs of Mrs. Adair's heirs. He also tried to honour her wishes that the ranch be sold <b>in</b> <b>small</b> <b>parcels</b> to settlers, a processed that dragged on for many years. He hoped petroleum would be found on Adair lands to ease in the financial consideration in the disposal of the property.|$|R
50|$|Freemantle was {{originally}} a large house and estate within the parish of Millbrook {{and before that}} was a farm house and land within that same parish. In 1851 it was deemed a separate parish, although some sources still refer to Freemantle as being part of Millbrook. The Freemantle House and Estate was sold by its last owner, Sir George Henry Hewett in 1852, and was bought by Sampson Payne, a local property developer. Sampson Payne {{was not only a}} merchant and local propertydeveloper, he was a town councillor of many years standing, and also was Mayor of Southampton from 1854-1856. He disposed of the land <b>in</b> <b>smaller</b> <b>parcels</b> ranging <b>in</b> value from £20 to £100 to various property developers and building societies. Within a short time, he had also intersected the park by nearly twenty roads.|$|R
50|$|With each of {{the daughters}} married to landowners elsewhere, the park and other lands in Barrow were sold and {{exchanged}} <b>in</b> <b>small</b> <b>parcels,</b> but by the fourteenth century were mainly split between two big landowners, the Despenser and Erdington Families. With the disgrace and execution Hugh Despenser in 1326, his estates, {{now part of the}} manor of Beaumanor, passed to the Beaumonts. The Erdington line died out in 1467, and having reverted to the crown was added to William Hastings' vast Leicestershire land holdings until his execution in 1483. The manor of Barrow remained with the Hastings family until 1840, but much of the individual land holdings were sold off piecemeal, and {{it was only in the}} 18th century that Buddon Wood returned to a single owner when Joseph Danvers was able to consolidate the various parts.|$|R
50|$|Economically, {{the primary}} sector {{is still the}} most {{important}} activities in the parish, however, its relevance has steadily declined over time. The pastures of the parish are dominated by cattle ranching and dairy herding, with agriculture that includes the cultivation of potato, corn and other vegetables are occurring <b>in</b> the <b>small</b> <b>parcels.</b> Complimenting these activities are secondary sector industries associated with construction, painting and carpentry. Trade and commerce are based on subsistence and supports primarily the local market.|$|R
