5|$|The {{construction}} of the temple was completed ten days ahead of schedule, allowing for more non-member guests to visit the temple before the dedication. The King of Tonga was given a private tour of the temple by previous Tongan mission president John Groberg to explain {{the purposes of the}} building. Before its formal dedication, over 50 percent of the Tongan population had toured the temple. The church's Nuku'alofa Tonga Temple was dedicated in 1983 by Gordon B. Hinckley as Kimball was ill and could not attend the dedication. There were seven dedicatory sessions held, most of which took place in the Liahona School gymnasium. 15,000 <b>people</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> attendance of these sessions.|$|E
5|$|For the All-Americans' next game, {{they played}} against the Toledo Maroons. Based in Toledo, Ohio, the Maroons were an {{independent}} team but {{became part of}} the APFA in 1922. Coming into the game, the Maroons had not scored a point for the entire season, and that streak continued this game. Six thousand <b>people</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> attendance for the 38–0 All-Americans victory. In the first quarter, Anderson returned a 40-yard and a 50-yard punt for two touchdowns. Hughitt scored a rushing touchdown in the second quarter, and Weldon kicked a 35-yard field goal to make the score 24–0 at halftime. Anderson scored the final two touchdowns of the game.

By the afternoon of October23, the Red Cross began deploying relief supplies to the affected region; 300 tents and 150 bags of rice were planned to be distributed to Kyaukphyu where at least 5,000 people were left homeless. According to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), a total of 176,823 people were affected by the storm and 70,795 were left homeless. By October30, the number affected and homeless had risen to 1.1million and roughly 100,000 respectively. Red Cross officials also reported that an estimated 60,000 <b>people</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> need of assistance throughout Myanmar. Later that day, a relief charity was opened in Rangoon to aid victims of the storm; in short order, the charity had received donations of 10million kyat ($10,000USD). By October25, temporary shelter camps set up by relief agencies housed an estimated 5,000 people.|$|E

5|$|In {{contrast}} to Hiroshima, {{almost all of}} the buildings were of old-fashioned Japanese construction, consisting of timber or timber-framed buildings with timber walls (with or without plaster) and tile roofs. Many of the smaller industries and business establishments were also situated in buildings of timber or other materials not designed to withstand explosions. Nagasaki had been permitted to grow for many years without conforming to any definite city zoning plan; residences were erected adjacent to factory buildings and to each other almost as closely as possible throughout the entire industrial valley. On the day of the bombing, an estimated 263,000 <b>people</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> Nagasaki, including 240,000 Japanese residents, 10,000 Korean residents, 2,500 conscripted Korean workers, 9,000 Japanese soldiers, 600 conscripted Chinese workers, and 400 Allied prisoners of war in a camp to the north of Nagasaki.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of the storm, the French Red Cross {{supplied}} 1.5tons of supplies to approximately 10,000people victims of Kalunde. Mauritius Deputy Prime Minister Paul Berenger visited the island Friday to assess the damage while another official called on Mauritius officials to contribute to a cyclone relief fund for the island group. Twenty technicians were also sent to the area in wake of the storm. Officials estimated that it would take five weeks for power to be fully restored across Rodrigues. They also stated that if a similar situation took place and <b>people</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> need of emergency services, no one would be able to receive them. Furthermore, they proposed that bridges would to be built in order to forestall roads from being washed out again.|$|E
5|$|The {{album was}} {{recorded}} over {{four and a}} half months at Larrabee North Studio in North Hollywood, California, beginning in mid-June 1997, the longest Madonna had ever worked on an album. For most of the recording process, only three other <b>people</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> the studio with Madonna: William Orbit, an engineer named Pat McCarthy, and his assistant engineer, Matt Silva. They started recording in Los Angeles, but the recording process was initially plagued with machinery problems, as Orbit preferred to work with samples, synth sounds, and Pro Tools, and not with live musicians. The computers would break down, and recording would have to be delayed until they could be repaired. Orbit recorded the bulk of the album's instrumentation over a four-month period. Orbit recalls playing the guitar and having his fingers bleed during the long hours he spent in the studio.|$|E

5|$|The {{evening before}} Fischer's burial, over 600 people {{attended}} a Catholic service at St. Mary's Church in Brownsville. His parents {{decided to have}} an open casket to allow attendees to kneel and pray next to the coffin. The funeral {{took place in the}} same church. Many <b>people</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> attendance including Buddy and Corinne's acquaintances, and Fischer's high school classmates. His girlfriend Marianela Caballero and her mother attended both services. Cristina, his ex-girlfriend, was also at the services, but her mother was not present. Fischer was buried at the Mont Meta Memorial Park in San Benito, Texas. In the days after the funeral, several of Fischer's longtime friends and their parents gathered at Buddy's house for moral support. Fischer's family moved out of the house where he was killed, and went to live with Corinne's mother. The day of the murder, the Brownsville police offered a reward of US$5,000 to anyone who could assist in the arrest of any individual involved in the murder. A week later the reward was increased to US$20,000. Five months after the murder, Fischer's house was sold at a US$18,000 loss.|$|E
5|$|The main {{shopping}} area was Jackson Square, with about 20 shops. The Army attempted to keep prices down by encouraging competition, but this met with limited success {{due to the}} captive nature of the population, and the requirements of security, which meant that firms and goods could not freely move in and out. The Army could give prospective concessionaires only vague information about how many <b>people</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> or {{would be in the}} town, and concessions were only {{for the duration of the}} war. Concessions were therefore charged a percentage of their profits in rental rather than a fixed fee. The Army avoided imposing draconian price controls, but limited prices to those of similar goods in Knoxville. By 1945, community amenities included 6 recreation halls, 36 bowling alleys, 23 tennis courts, 18 ball parks, 12 playgrounds, a swimming pool, a 9,400-volume library, and a newspaper.|$|E
5|$|With over 100 {{transmission}} lines paralyzed by the ice, Quebec {{fell into a}} massive power outage in the cold Canadian winter. Even though power restoration initiated after the first blackouts, large numbers of Quebecers were in the dark. At {{the height of the}} blackout, some 1.4–1.5 million homes and customers, housing three to more than four million <b>people,</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> the dark. Private companies and other utilities from other parts of Canada and the United States were sent in to help Hydro-Québec undertake this massive restoration task, but these efforts were complicated by the widespread damage of the power grid. Blackouts in some areas lasted for 33 days, and 90% of those affected by the blackout had no power for more than seven days. Although power was fully restored to all locations in Quebec by February 8, 1998, it wasn't until mid-March that the power facilities were back in service. By then, much social and economic damage had occurred, such as ruined food and deaths resulting from lack of electric heating.|$|E

5|$|Hailing from Plymouth, Michigan at the Compuware Sports Arena on October 22, 2006 TNA {{held the}} second annual Bound for Glory event, where it {{featured}} eight professional wrestling matches. Like the previous year's incarnation, another 30-minute pre-show was featured before the event, with Bobby Roode, who was accompanied by Traci, defeating Lance Hoyt on the telecast. Approximately 3,600 <b>people</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> attendance for the event, which was 900 people less than the maximum capacity of the Compuware Sports Arena. All three of TNA's active championships {{at the time were}} defended at the event. All three championships changed hands at the event, making this event the only time in TNA history that all have changed hands in one night. The main event on the card was Jeff Jarrett defending the NWA World Heavyweight Championship against Sting in a Title vs. Career match with Kurt Angle as the Special Outside Enforcer; Sting won the encounter to become the new champion. The TNA X Division Championship was also defended by Senshi against Chris Sabin, which Sabin won to win the title. The last championship match was a Six Sides of Steel cage match for the NWA World Tag Team Championship, in which A.J. Styles and Christopher Daniels lost the championship to Homicide and Hernandez of The Latin American Exchange; the ring was surrounded by a steel cage in this match. There were several matches featured on the event's undercard: an 8 Mile Street Fight resulting in a victory for Christian Cage over Rhino; and Samoa Joe defeating Brother Runt, Raven, and Abyss, who was accompanied by James Mitchell, in a Monster's Ball match with Jake Roberts as the Special Guest Referee.|$|E
