40|$|Abstract — Domain-specific {{languages}} describe specific {{solutions to}} problems in the application domain. Traditionally they form a solution composing black-box abstractions together. This, usually, involves non-deep transformations over the target model. In this paper we {{argue that it is}} potentially powerful to operate with grey-box abstractions to build a domain-specific software system. We present <b>parametric</b> <b>code</b> templates as grey-box abstractions and conceptual tools to encapsulate and manipulate these templates. Manipulations introduce template’s merging routines and can be defined in a generic way. This involves reasoning mechanisms at the code templates level. We introduce the concept of Neurath Modelling Language (NML) that operates with <b>parametric</b> <b>code</b> templates and specifies a visualisation mapping mechanism for target models. Finally we provide an example of calculating a domain-specific software system with predefined NML elements...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MScIng (Electrical and Electronic Engineering)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2006. Despite {{enormous}} {{advances in}} digital communication, {{the voice is}} still the primary tool with which people exchange ideas. However, uncompressed digital speech tends to require prohibitively high data rates (upward of 64 kbps), making it impractical for many applications. Speech coding {{is the process of}} reducing the data rate of digital voice to manageable levels. Parametric speech coders or vocoders utilise a-priori information about the mechanism by which speech is produced in order to achieve extremely efficient compression of speech signals (as low as 1 kbps). The greater part of this thesis comprises an investigation into <b>parametric</b> speech <b>coding.</b> This consisted of a review of the mathematical and heuristic tools used in <b>parametric</b> speech <b>coding,</b> as well as the implementation of an accepted standard algorithm for <b>parametric</b> voice <b>coding.</b> In order to examine avenues of improvement for the existing vocoders, we examined some of the mathematical structure underlying <b>parametric</b> speech <b>coding.</b> Following on from this, we developed a novel approach to <b>parametric</b> speech <b>coding</b> which obtained promising results under both objective and subjective evaluation. An additional contribution by this thesis was the comparative subjective evaluation of the effect of <b>parametric</b> speech <b>coding</b> on English and Xhosa speech.

30|$|Nevertheless, a {{model is}} used in <b>parametric</b> <b>coding.</b> This is called a signal model to {{distinguish}} it from source models as are used in speech coding. The origin of the signal model is more based on destination properties (i.e., the human hearing system) {{in the sense that}} it tries to describe perceptually-relevant acoustic events. Consequently, <b>parametric</b> <b>coding</b> is also related to musical synthesis. However, the distinction between source and destination models is arguable; for example, many musical instruments create tonal components and biological evolution presumably leads to a tight connection between destination and source characteristics.|$|E

Hybrid transform-based and <b>parametric</b> <b>coding</b> could potentially overcome {{the limits of the}} individual approaches. Yet, existing hybrid coders are hampered by the lack of integrative interplay between both techniques.

40|$|Abstract — The {{existing}} {{constructions of}} space-time codes or modulation have mainly focused on two ideal situations: either quasi-static or rapid fading channels. In this paper, {{we consider the}} design of robust space-time modulation for time-correlated Rayleigh fading channels. We show that the space-time signals of square size achieving full diversity in quasi-static fading channels can also achieve the full diversity in time-correlated fading channels irrespectively of the time correlation matrix. Moreover, we propose a space-time signal construction method by combining orthogonal designs with sphere packings. The simulation results show that our scheme outperforms the previously existing methods. For example, we observe a coding gain of about 1. 5 dB over the conventional orthogonal design, about 2 dB over the <b>parametric</b> <b>code,</b> and about 4 dB over the cyclic code under certain fading conditions.

In this paper, we focus on the design of unitary signal constellations for differential space–time modulation with double transmit antennas.

30|$|Technically speaking, the {{waveform}} {{coding scheme}} has no noise-resistant precaution {{and thus is}} vulnerable to noise. In terms of the <b>parametric</b> <b>coding</b> scheme, the noise will bring in errors to the feature parameters such as pitch period and voiced/unvoiced judgment. Once such parameters are contaminated, undesirable reconstruct distortion happens. For reasons given above, the noise resistance of the proposed scheme {{is better than the}} counterparts.|$|E
30|$|The above model-based codec and {{parametric}} codec {{can offer}} a considerable compression ratio. However, those methods {{need to know the}} direction of the real audio source to do objective-oriented coding, or estimated a virtual source direction to do downmixing and <b>parametric</b> <b>coding.</b> In practice, such as live recording, {{it is very difficult to}} obtain the real audio source direction. Downmixing and <b>parametric</b> <b>coding</b> will cause interchannel interference such as ‘tone leakage’ artifacts when channel signals differ greatly [30]. Furthermore, the computational complexity of an audio codec should be acceptable while maintaining enough coding efficiency, and <b>parametric</b> <b>coding</b> can only achieve a performance gain at low bitrates. This paper focuses on the situation that only the multichannel signals of audio sources are recorded, instead of their directions. And we consider high-quality/high-bitrate application and focus on the non-parametric coding method. Section ‘M/S coding in 3 D space’ describes the conventional M/S coding process and presents a three-channel Dependent M/S coding (3 D-M/S) method. The main idea is to expand M/S coding to three-dimensional audio by designing a new transform matrix, which remove the redundancy of three channels in 3 D space rather than just two channels in the horizontal plane. Section ‘ 3 D-M/S psychoacoustic model’ discusses the psychoacoustic model for transformed 3 D-M/S signals. Section ‘Framework for general channel configuration’ specifies a new framework enables 3 D-M/S to be applied to a more general channel configuration. Section ‘Experiment’ gives a comparison of 3 D-M/S coding with PCA coding and Independent channel coding to justify the performance of compression ratio and computational complexity. Section ‘Conclusion’ summarizes and concludes this paper.|$|E

40|$|For {{very low}} bit rate audio coding {{applications}} in mobile communications or on the internet, <b>parametric</b> audio <b>coding</b> has evolved as a technique complementing the more traditional approaches.

40|$|The {{subject of}} this paper looks into {{designing}} high density residential architecture that enables certain qualities, {{in order to improve}} the livability and perception of the design. A parametric design approach was chosen for this project in order to enable these qualities. First, several important conditions and criteria for this project were formed. These form guiding principles for the parametric models. This is important, since parametric modeling software can often lead to reflexive design criteria and unnecessary complexity. In order to avoid this, relation to context and social relevance become important guiding criteria. View, daylight, orientation and privacy are all guiding criteria that contribute to this social relevance. The first Grasshopper model was then created. By switching between different domains (or design aspects) within a design process, and combining their results, a qualitative design can eventually be created. The first Grasshopper model, however, forms a more linear process, in which every step within the created model is placed within one continuous code. A second Grasshopper model was then created. This model showed promise by allowing better differentiation between de different design domains. However, by basing the input parameters of the second Grasshopper model on a gradient image, the input parameters became in a way fixed within this model. With the help of parametric form-finding, the architect can create a certain kind of differentiation of elements within his design, giving him more freedom in the composition of the design within the design process. However, <b>parametric</b> <b>codes</b> are created with a certain algorithmic logic. This can be limiting the creative freedom of the designer and a design could then possibly lose its human-touch. Therefore, the designer should always be in control over the <b>parametric</b> <b>code</b> he created, changing the role of the designer from a physical designer to a more virtual designer, a programmer, who is in control of all the aspects of parametric design (input, algorithmic process and output). By reflecting on each Grasshopper model, {{in order to understand the}} strengths and weaknesses, the complexity of the design process of designing high density housing itself could be made more understandable and rationalized. However, according to certain Literature (Simon 1973; Lawson 1980) the design process can never be fully rationalized. This is because the design process can also be described as ill-structured. Understanding the advantages of the computer in well-structured problems and its disadvantages in ill-structured problems, is also important for understanding the need for heuristics within the parametric design approach. Rowe (1982) states that the architectural design process is inherent heuristic. This means that the further a design process advances, more conditions become clear and therefore, the better the design process could be rationalized by the designer or architect. Within the design and development of the parametric tool itself, this would mean that perhaps a <b>parametric</b> <b>code</b> / program could be designed in such a way, that it can rewrite itself according to what it has learned. In languages that support Object Oriented Programming (OOP) an object can be seen as a structure that contains both data and procedures. Understanding these procedures will enable the designer to reflect on the input and output data, making a cooperative and iterative trial-and-error process possible between the computer and the designer.

Another multichannel audio processing method called upmix {{can also be}} used to deliver multichannel audio, typically 5. 1 signals, at low data rates. More precisely, we focus on existing upmix method based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA). This PCA-based upmix method aims at blindly create a realistic multichannel output signal while BCC scheme aims at perceptually restitute the original multichannel audio signal. PCA-based upmix method and BCC scheme both use spatial para-meters extracted from stereo channels to generate auditory events with correct spatial attributes i. e. sound sources positions and spatial impression. In this paper, we expose a multichannel audio model based on PCA which allows a parametric representation of multichannel audio. Considering stereo audio, signals resulting from PCA can be represented as a principal component, corresponding to directional sources, and one remaining signal, corresponding to ambience signals, which are both related to original input with PCA transformation parameters.
