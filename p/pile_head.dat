At the top of the piston are vent holes that are sealed by the load hanger retaining the reaction mass.

40|$|In {{the last}} few decades there has been a rapid {{increase}} in the number of piled foundations where the piles have been employed as settlement reducers; in some recent projects, the piles have been separated from the raft by a granular layer, which creates a more uniform pressure distribution on the raft bottom and reduces constraint reactions in the soil, foundation, and superstructure. A series of centrifuge model tests has been performed to investigate the load transfer mechanisms between a square rigid raft and a group of instrumented piles jacked in dry dense sand, in direct contact with the raft or separated from the raft by an interposed granular layer. The test results have shown that contact piles act as settlement reducers by diffusing the load applied to their heads to greater and deeper volumes of soil. The insertion of a deformable layer between a raft and <b>pile</b> <b>heads</b> does not ensure displacement compatibility, and the pressure diffused by the granular fill acts partly on the <b>pile</b> <b>heads</b> and partly produces shallow soil settlements, which mobilize negative skin friction on the upper part of the pile shaft.

50|$|The end of {{the arrow}} that is {{designed}} to hit the target is called the arrowhead. Usually, these are separate items that are attached to the arrow shaft by either tangs or sockets. Materials used in the past for arrowheads include flint, bone, horn, or metal. Most modern arrowheads are made of steel, but wood and other traditional materials are still used occasionally. A number of different types of arrowheads are known, with the most common being bodkins, broadheads, and piles. Bodkin heads are simple spikes made of metal of various shapes, designed to pierce armour. A broadhead arrowhead is usually triangular or leaf-shaped and has a sharpened edge or edges. Broadheads are commonly used for hunting. A pile arrowhead is a simple metal cone, either sharpened to a point or somewhat blunt, that is used mainly for target shooting. A <b>pile</b> <b>head</b> is the same diameter as the arrow shaft and is usually just fitted over the tip of the arrow. Other heads are known, including the blunt head, which is flat at the end and is used for hunting small game or birds, and is designed to not pierce the target nor embed itself in trees or other objects and make recovery difficult. Another type of arrowhead is a barbed head, usually used in warfare or hunting.|$|E

40|$|A piled raft is a {{composite}} foundation in which the piles are used as settlement reducers and they share, with the raft, the load from the superstructure. The applied load is transferred from the raft to the shallow soil and to the <b>pile</b> <b>heads,</b> and from the piles it is diffused through the shaft and the base to deeper soil. The pile–raft and pile–pile interactions represent the distinctive aspect of the piled raft foundations since they modify the load–bearing behaviour of each foundation component, compared to an analogous isolated element, thus determining the overall foundation behaviour. The main aim of this thesis is to highlight {{the effects of the}} raft–soil–pile interactions on the resistance and stiffness of axially loaded piled raft foundations in sand. A series of centrifuge tests on models of rigid circular piled rafts in loose saturated sand has been performed to this end, employing both non displacement and displacement piles. The raft settlement and the load transmitted to the <b>pile</b> <b>heads</b> and bases were monitored during the tests, which also included unpiled raft and isolated pile tests. The test results have been analysed in terms of bearing capacity and stiffness; the former according to a load efficiency method, the latter by comparing the values obtained from centrifuge tests with those evaluated through a simplified analytical method. ii Modelling of Piled Raft Foundations in Sand D. Giretti In order to clarify the effect of the pressure transmitted by the raft to the soil on the behaviour of a single capped pile, some of the centrifuge tests were simulated via finite element numerical analyses, using an elasto–plastic strain hardening constitutive model for the sand. The geometry and the dimensions of the numerical models corresponded to those of the physical ones and the simulations were carried out applying an accelerated gravitational field to the mesh. The influence of a granular layer, interposed between the raft and the <b>pile</b> <b>heads,</b> on the load transfer mechanism has also been analysed, through an additional series of centrifuge tests which was performed on square rigid raft models on displacement piles in dry dense sand...|$|R

Seven tests, corresponding to various axial loads ranging from 0 to 70 % of the pile estimated bearing capacity, were performed. The results on <b>pile</b> <b>head</b> displacement show that heating under low axial load induced heave and cooling induced settlement; the pile temperature-displacement curve {{was found to be}} reversible and compatible with the thermal expansion curve of the pile. However, at higher axial loads, irreversible settlement of the <b>pile</b> <b>head</b> was observed after a few thermal cycles. The axial load profile measured by the strain gauges evidenced that the <b>pile</b> <b>head</b> load was mainly transferred to the pile toe.

40|$|Many {{structures}} often carry {{lateral loads}} due to earth pressure, wind, earthquakes, wave action and ship impact. The accurate {{predictions of the}} load–displacement response of the pile group {{as well as the}} straining actions are needed for a safe and economic design. Most research focused on the behavior of laterally loaded single piles though piles are most frequently used in groups. Soil is modeled as an elastic-perfectly plastic model using the Mohr–Coulomb constitutive model. The three-dimensional Plaxis model is validated using load–displacement results from centrifuge tests of laterally loaded piles embedded in sand. This study utilizes three dimensional finite element modeling to better understand the main parameters that affect the response of laterally loaded pile groups (2  ×  2 and 3  ×  3 pile configurations) including sand relative density, pile spacing (s =  2. 5 D, 5 D and 8 D) and pile location within the group. The fixity of the <b>pile</b> <b>head</b> affects its load–displacement under lateral loading. Typically, the <b>pile</b> <b>head</b> may be unrestrained (free) head as the <b>pile</b> <b>head</b> is allowed to rotate, or restrained (fixed) head condition where no <b>pile</b> <b>head</b> rotation is permitted.

40|$|Embedded {{stabilizing}} piles are new anti-slide {{structures that}} are unlike traditional stabilizing piles. The pile heads are embedded {{at a certain}} depth {{below the surface of}} a slope. The piles do not need to support the thrust of the entire upslope sliding mass, and it is, therefore, possible to reduce the sliding thrust on the piles. The embedded depth of the pile heads is an important parameter to maximize the anti-sliding function. Based on an analysis of the stability mechanism of a reinforced landslide with one row of embedded stabilizing piles, a calculation method for the embedded depth of a <b>pile</b> <b>head</b> using limit equilibrium theory is proposed. The related calculation formula is derived in detail using the transfer coefficient method. The proposed method features a close correlation between the embedded depth of a <b>pile</b> <b>head</b> and the design factor of safety of a slope to be reinforced. Additionally, the method can quantitatively demonstrate the relationship that the factor of safety of the slope for the failure mode of the surpassing <b>pile</b> <b>head</b> decreases as the embedded depth of the <b>pile</b> <b>head</b> increases. For a given factor of safety, the range of the maximum bending moment, the maximum shear force on a pile and the lateral displacement at the <b>pile</b> <b>head</b> also can be approximately predicted. Several calculation examples that are closely related to practical engineering applications are examined to show the convenience and rationality of the proposed method. In addition, the theoretical analysis is compared with the results of the numerical simulation of an actual accumulation landslide control engineering project. The results further demonstrate that the proposed theoretical analysis method is reasonable and applicable...|$|E

The influence of soil plasticity is investigated on the seismic response of soil-pile-structure system for two idealized soil deposits: cohesive and frictional soils.
