40|$|As {{fossil fuel}} {{resources}} {{become more and more}} scarce, attention has been turned to alternative sources of fuels and energy. One promising prospect is the conversion of methane (natural gas) to methanol, which requires an initial activation of a C-H <b>bond</b> and subsequent <b>formation</b> of a <b>C-O</b> <b>bond.</b> The most well studied methodologies for both C-H activation and <b>C-O</b> <b>bond</b> <b>formation</b> involve oxidation of the metal center. Metal complexes with facile access to oxidation states separated by four charge units, required for two subsequent oxidations, are rare. Non-oxidative methods to perform C-H <b>bond</b> activation or <b>C-O</b> <b>bond</b> <b>formation</b> must be pursued in order for methane to methanol to become a viable strategy. In this dissertation studies on redox and non-redox methods for both C-H activation and <b>C-O</b> <b>bond</b> <b>formation</b> are discussed. In the early chapters <b>C-O</b> <b>bond</b> <b>formation</b> in the form of reductive functionalization is modeled. Polypyridine ligated rhodium complexes were studied computationally to determine the properties that would promote reductive functionalization. These principles were then tested by designing an experimental complex that could form <b>C-O</b> <b>bonds.</b> This complex was then shown to also work in acidic media, a critical aspect for product stabilization. In the later chapters, non-oxidative C-H activation is discussed with Ir complexes. Both sigma bond metathesis and concerted metalation deprotonation were investigated. For the former, the mechanism for an experimentally known complex was elucidated and for the latter the controlling factors for a proposed catalyst were explored...|$|R

The first part is focused on studies of N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) palladium(IV) intermediates, which are {{involved}} in oxidative addition mediated C-C, and <b>C-O</b> <b>bond</b> <b>formation</b> processes as well as in C-Cl bond forming reactions via a reductive elimination process. Bis-NHC-Pd(II) complexes have been reported as effective catalysts to mediate direct conversion of methane into methanol. However, a H-D exchange study revealed that the bis-NHC-Pd(II) complexes are not the active species responsible for the C-H bond activation reaction. This unexpected result implies that the high oxidation state bis-NHC-Pd(IV) species may be the real catalyst! The oxidative addition of methyl iodide to the bis-NHC-Pd(II) -Me 2 complex led to the successful observation of the formation of a transient trimethyl bis-NHC-Pd(IV) intermediate by both 1 H-NMR and 13 C-NMR spectroscopy.

40|$|The {{reaction}} {{mechanism of the}} L-proline-catalyzed alpha-aminoxylation reaction between aldehyde and nitrosobenzene has been investigated using density functional theory (DFT) calculation. Our calculation results reveal following conclusions [1]. The first step that corresponds to the <b>formation</b> of <b>C-O</b> <b>bond,</b> is the stereocontrolling and rate-determining step [2]. Among four reaction channels, the syn-attack reaction channel is more favorable {{than that of the}} anti one, and the TS-ss channel dominates among the four channels for this reaction in the step of <b>C-O</b> <b>bond</b> <b>formation</b> [3]. The intermolecular hydrogen bond between the acidic hydrogen of L-proline and the N atom of the nitrosobenzene in an early stage of the process catalyzes very effectively the <b>C-O</b> <b>bond</b> <b>formation</b> by a large stabilization of the negative charge that is developing at the O atom along the electrophilic attack [4]. The effect of solvent decreases the activation energy, and also, the calculated energy barriers are decrease with the enhancement of dielectric constants for <b>C-O</b> <b>bond</b> <b>formation</b> step. These results are in good agreement with experiment, and allow us to explain the origin of the catalysis and stereoselectivity for L-proline-catalyzed alpha-aminoxylation of aldehyde reaction. The addition of H 2 O to substituted imine proline, intermolecular proton-transfer steps, and the L-proline elimination process were also studied in this paper...|$|R

40|$|The {{mechanism}} of Ir(I) -catalyzed double hydroalkoxylation of 4 -pentyn- 1 -ol with methanol {{to form cyclic}} acetals has been investigated with density functional theory calculations. Using a model [Ir(PyP΄) (CO) ₂] + catalyst (PyP΄ = 1 -[2 -phosphinoethyl]pyrazole) the key steps in the first hydroalkoxylation are shown to be (i) electrophilic activation of the alkyne at the cationic Ir(I) metal center; (ii) rate-limiting <b>C-O</b> <b>bond</b> <b>formation</b> via intramolecular nucleophilic attack by the pendant OH group at the C 4 position of the bound alkyne; and (iii) facile H⁺ transfer to form an Ir-bound cyclic vinyl ether intermediate. The key <b>C-O</b> <b>bond</b> forming cyclization step is greatly facilitated {{by the presence of}} an external H-bonded MeOH molecule that stabilizes the positive charge that develops at the hydroxyl proton of the bound alkyne. External MeOH also {{plays a key role in}} the H⁺ transfer step, for which a number of kinetically competitive pathways corresponding to either retention of the hydroxyl proton in the product or exchange with solvent were identified. The second hydroalkoxylation is initiated from the Ir-bound cyclic vinyl ether intermediate and depends on the ability of that species to access an Ir(I) -alkyl form in which the β-carbon carries a significant positive charge. Reversible <b>C-O</b> <b>bond</b> <b>formation</b> then occurs via nucleophilic attack of MeOH at the β-carbon and proceeds via a novel [3 + 2]-addition of the O-H bond over the {Ir-Cᵅ -Cᵝ } moiety. This forms an Ir(III) hydrido-alkyl species, from which reductive elimination yields the final O,O-acetal product. This final reductive elimination is the rate-limiting step within the second hydroalkoxylation component of the cycle. The Ir(I) -alkyl intermediate can also access a MeOH-mediated C-H activation at the Cˠ position that leads to exchange with external MeOH. This accounts for the experimentally observed H/D exchange at that position. 9 page(s...|$|R

The introductory Chapter {{provides an overview}} of recent advances in asymmetric heterofunctionalisation reactions of allenes. This includes intra- and inter-molecular reactions involving C-N and <b>C-O</b> <b>bond</b> <b>formations.</b> Chapter 2 begins by comparing the preparation of a γ-allenic alcohol by two different synthetic routes and its subsequent use in intramolecular hydroalkoxylation reactions using copper(II) and silver(I) salts. From this study, the ability of silver diphosphine complexes to facilitate enantioselective hydroalkoxylation reactions in a 5 -exo-trig fashion was discovered. Extensive reaction optimisation was undertaken, however only moderate ee’s and conversions were observed. In Chapter 3, the use of other metal Lewis acids to catalyse hydroalkoxylation reactions of γ-allenic alcohols is presented. DFT calculations undertaken by a colleague (Prof H. S. Rzepa) were used to rationalise the observed regioselectivities with silver(I), zinc(II), and tin(II) triflates. From DFT calculations, the metal counteranion was found to be intimately involved in the <b>C-O</b> <b>bond</b> <b>formation.</b> In the following two Chapters, the possibility of asymmetric synthesis by using chiral anionic ligands is discussed.

40|$|The {{mechanism}} of the reaction between nitrones and lithium ynolates has been studied using DFT methods at M 06 - 2 X/cc-pVTZ/PCM=THF level. After {{the formation of a}} starting complex, without energy barrier, in which the lithium atom is coordinated to both nitrone and ynolate, the reaction takes place in one single kinetic step through an only transition structure. However, the formation of C-C- and <b>C-O</b> <b>bonds</b> takes place sequentially through a typical two-stage one-step process. A combined study of non-covalent interactions (NCI) and electron localization function (ELF) of selected points along the IRC of the reaction confirmed that, in the transition structure, only the C-C bond is being formed in some extent whereas an electrostatic interaction is present between carbon and oxygen atoms previous to the <b>formation</b> of the <b>C-O</b> <b>bond.</b> Indeed, the <b>formation</b> of the second <b>C-O</b> <b>bond</b> only begins when the first C-C bond is completely formed without formation of any intermediate.

Curs: 2015 / 2016 In this work, the {{decomposition}} {{reaction of}} pyruvic acid has been studied, some mechanisms {{are based on}} the proposal that Gabriel da Silva presents in its theoretical study of this decomposition process. The study has been made from two viewpoints. The first one is an energetic and geometric analysis of the stationary points involved in the different pathways. The second one consists in a topological study of some mechanisms. The mechanisms proposed by Gabriel da Silva have been reproduced and similar geometric and energetic results have been found. The mechanism-A is the most favorable kinetically because the reactants have to pass through less energetic energy barriers to reach the products, in this case acetic acid and carbon monoxide. On the other hand, the mechanism-D is the most favorable thermodynamically because obtaining acetaldehyde has the most negative reaction free energy (- 12. 48 Kcal/mol). However, mechanism D has a high energy barrier (73. 2 Kcal/mol). Furthermore, two alternatives to mechanism A (mechanisms A’ and A’’) have been characterized. All three mechanisms give acetic acid and carbon monoxide as products. These new alternatives have been calculated at the same theoretical level as the previous proposed mechanism and the energetic and geometric study has been extended with a topological analysis. Gibbs free energies of the mechanism A are similar to the mechanism A’, there is only a small difference of 2. 21 kcal/mol in the first transition state, nevertheless, the energies of the other stationary points are the same in both mechanisms. These are stepwise mechanisms where the first transition state is associated to a hydrogen transfer between the alcohol and carbonyl groups and to a <b>C-O</b> <b>bond</b> <b>formation</b> that closes the epoxide ring. The difference between both mechanisms is the oxygen that forms the epoxide group, so both intermediates are enantiomers. In the second TS, the C-C and the other <b>C-O</b> <b>bond</b> of the epoxide ring are broken giving acetic acid and carbon monoxide. The geometric analysis reveals than in the first TS the hydrogen transfer in much more advanced than the <b>C-O</b> <b>bond</b> <b>formation.</b> In the same way, in the second TS the <b>C-O</b> <b>bond</b> distance is longer than the C-C one. 44 The description that emerges from the topologica...|$|R

40|$|A new and {{efficient}} method for {{the preparation of}} several imidazolium salts containing an ester group in the C 4 position of the aromatic ring through a retro-Claisen reaction pathway between a quinone derivative and several alcohols is described. This new organic transformation proceeds {{in the absence of}} a catalyst, but it is greatly catalyzed by different Lewis acids, especially with AgOAc at a very low catalyst loading and in very short reaction times. The process takes place by the nucleophilic attack of the carbonyl groups by the alcohol functionality, thus promoting a double C-C bond cleavage and C-H and <b>C-O</b> <b>bond</b> <b>formation.</b> This reaction represents the first example of this type between a quinone derivative and alcohols.

40|$|In two {{consecutive}} equilibria the compound (Cp*) (2) Zr(OMe) (2) undergoes insertion of CO 2 {{to form the}} mono- and bis-hemicarbonates. Both equilibria are exothermic but entropically disfavoured. Magnetisation transfer experiments gave kinetic data for the first equilibrium showing {{that the rate of}} insertion is overall second order with a rate constant of 3. 20 +/- 0. 12 M- 1 s(- 1), which is substantially higher than those reported for other early transition metal alkoxides, which are currently the best homogeneous catalysts for dimethyl carbonate formation from methanol and CO 2.

40|$|Kinetic {{studies on}} the {{oxidation}} of benzyl alcohol and substituted benzyl alcohols in benzene as the re-action medium have been studied by using potassium dichromate under phase transfer catalysis (PTC). The phase transfer catalysts (PT catalysts) used were tetrabutylammonium bromide (TBAB) and tetrabutylphosphonium bromide (TBPB). Benzyl alcohols were selectively oxidised to correspond-ing benzaldehydes in good yield (above 90 %). The order of reactivity among the studied benzyl alcohols is p-OCH 3 > p-CH 3 >-H> p-Cl. Plots of log k 2 versus Hammett's substituent constant (σ) {{has been found to}} be curve in shape and this suggests that there should be a continuous change in transition state with changes in substituent present in the substrate from electron donating to electron with-drawing. A suitable mechanism has been suggested in which the rate determining step involves both C-H <b>bond</b> cleavage and <b>C-O</b> <b>bond</b> <b>formations</b> in concerted manner. © 2014 BCREC UNDIP.

40|$|The {{synthesis}} of O-doped polyaromatic hydrocarbons, {{in which two}} polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon subunits are bridged through one or two O atoms, has been achieved. This includes high-yielding ring-closure key steps that, depending on the reaction conditions, yield the formation of either furanyl or pyranopyranyl linkages through intramolecular <b>C-O</b> <b>bond</b> <b>formation.</b> Comprehensive photophysical measurements in solution showed that these molecules feature exceptionally high emission yields and tunable absorption properties throughout the UV-vis spectral region. Electrochemical investigations showed that in all cases the O-annulation increases the electron donor capabilities by raising the HOMO energy level with the LUMO energy level being less affected. Moreover, third-order NLO measurements of solutions or thin films containing the dyes displayed very good second hyperpolarizibility values. Importantly, PMMA films containing the pyranopyranyl derivatives displayed weak linear absorption and NLO absorption compared to the nonlinearity and NLO refraction, respectively, revealing to be exceptional organic materials for photonic devices...|$|R
40|$|Oxygenation of C-H and C=C {{bonds of}} {{hydrocarbons}} with H 2 O 2 and O 2 {{is an important}} industrial method to convert mineral oil into useful chemicals. Despite their enormous economic impact, these reactions are still not fully understood. In the early 1970 s, the potential of Rh and Ir complexes for olefin oxygenation was investigated intensively. Simple inorganic salts of these metals proved to be rather useless for industrial application {{when compared with the}} traditional Wacker system. However, the appropriate choice of ligands allows the stepwise oxidation of olefins at Rh and Ir. These systems are therefore useful to study mechanistic details of substrate binding and <b>C-O</b> <b>bond</b> <b>formation</b> at the catalytic metal center. Insight from these model studies helps in understanding the catalytic reactions at these (and possibly other) metal centers. Further insight into the differences between the Rh system and traditional Wacker-type oxidation at Pd may lead to useful applications...|$|R
40|$|New and {{conclusive}} {{evidence has been}} obtained {{for the existence of}} cobalt(III) -carbene radicals that have been previously proposed as the key intermediates in the underlying mechanism of metalloradical cyclopropanation by cobalt(II) complexes of porphyrins. In the absence of olefin substrates, reaction of [Co(TPP) ] with ethyl styryldiazoacetate was found to generate the corresponding cobalt(III) -vinylcarbene radical that subsequently dimerizes via its γ-radical allylic resonance form to afford a dinuclear cobalt(III) porphyrin complex. X-ray structural analysis reveals a highly compact dimeric structure wherein the two metalloporphyrin units are arranged in a face-to-face fashion through a tetrasubstituted 1, 5 -hexadiene C 6 -bridge between the two Co(III) centers. The γ-radical allylic resonance form of the cobalt(III) -vinylcarbene radical intermediate could be effectively trapped by TEMPO via <b>C-O</b> <b>bond</b> <b>formation</b> to give a mononuclear cobalt(III) complex instead of the dimeric product.
