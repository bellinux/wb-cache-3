40|$|The penalty {{caused by}} {{incoherent}} crosstalk has been calculated and measured for both PIN and optically preamplified receivers. Measured and calculated penalties agree excellently, and {{they show that}} the penalty {{is not only a}} function of the total crosstalk power but also of the number of crosstalk signals among which the power is distributed. As an example, the penalty caused by a total relative crosstalk power of - 20 dB increases in the preamplified case from 2 dB to 4 dB when 6 instead of 1 crosstalk signals exist. As to the relation between the penalty in the PIN and the preamplified case, a rule of thumb is derived: The penalty in dB in the preamplified case is two times the penalty in the <b>PIN</b> <b>case.</b> Finally, the penalty calculations based on the exact pdf of the received optical power show that the often used Gaussian approximation is accurate within 1 / 4 dB if 6 or more crosstalk signals having a total relative power smaller than - 24 dB exist...|$|E

The LP 2951 has three additional features. The first is the Error Output {{that can be used}} to signal external circuitry of an out of regulation condition, or as a microprocessor power−on reset. The second feature allows the output voltage to be preset to 5. 0 V, 3. 3 V or 3. 0 V output (depending on the version) or programmed from 1. 25 V to 29 V. It consists of a pinned out resistor divider along with direct access to the Error Amplifier feedback input. The third feature is a Shutdown input that allows a logic level signal to turn−off or turn−on the regulator output.

40|$|Heat {{transfer}} to pins swimming in non-isothermal fluidic systems is theoretically analyzed. Four different cases are considered: [A] pins aligned longitudinally in flowing fluid having constant temperature gradient, [B] pins aligned transversely in flowing fluid flow with constant temperature gradient, [C] pins moving lon-gitudinally towards a heated surface, and [D] pins moving transversely towards the heated surface. The Ap-propriate unsteady energy transport equations are solved and closed form {{solutions for the}} fin temperatures are obtained. Accordingly, different performance indicators are calculated. It is found that heat {{transfer to}} the swimming pin increases as the pin thermal length, Peclet number and fluid temperature difference along the pin length increase. It decreases as fluid temperature index along the motion direction increases. Moreover, the swimming <b>pins</b> of <b>case</b> C are found to produce the maximum system effective thermal conductivity. In addition, <b>pins</b> of <b>case</b> B with thermal lengths above 11 produce system thermal conductivity independent on the thermal length. Meanwhile, <b>pins</b> of <b>case</b> A having thermal lengths above 10 produce system thermal conductivities less responsive to the thermal length.

To explore possible factors that could increase serum PSA level, we performed a retrospective, cross-sectional study on 805 consecutive patients in Sumber Waras and Dr. Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospitals from 1994 to 1997. Clinical manifestations were evaluated and prostate biopsies were performed if indicated. Complete histopathological data were only available in 82 BPH patients with no urinary retention from 1998 - 1999 and a thin section of paraffin blocks of BPH patients which still could be found from 1994 - 1999 was analyzed using flow cytometer to obtain the S-phase fraction as a parameter of proliferative activity, From 805 patients, 461 (57 %) presented with urinary retention {{and need to be}} catheteized. Catheteization significantly increased PSA level if compared to noncatheterized patients (16. 3 vs. 6, 8 ng/mL, p= 0, 000). Another data of 82 uncatheteized patients from 1998 - 1999 has revealed that 79 patients (96. 3 %) had chronic prostatitis and 19 (23. 2 %) showed the presence of prostatic-intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) with an increase of PSA level (5. 4 ng/mL). The S-phase fraction of BPH without <b>PIN</b> <b>cases</b> was significantly higher in cases with PSA > 4 ng/ml than patients with PSA ≤ 4 ng/ml (I 3. 1 % vs. 8. 9 %, p= 0, 008).

According to the classification by Gordon et al. [5], the mild loss of reduction in two cases of lateral entry group in our study suggest that lateral entry is biomechanically weaker. Although radiological and clinical union occurred in a similar time period without any residual deformity, the loss of both the range of motion and {{the carrying}} angle was greater in these two patients, compared to those without loss of reduction. In a recent analysis of the two techniques by Lee et al. [19], the loss of reduction in the lateral entry group was 0 – 11.8  %.

We analyzed needle core biopsies from 28 patients with PIN and 41 patients with adenocarcinoma. Neoplastic glands and those with PIN were analyzed on high power field (400 x) and classified in three groups according to the extent of clefting. Immunohistochemical staining was performed following Microwave Streptavidin ImmunoPeroxidase (MSIP) protocol on DAKO TechMate Horizon automated immunostainer. Periacinar retraction clefting was significantly more prominent in prostatic carcinoma compared to PIN (p< 0. 0001) and nonneoplastic glands (p< 0. 0001).

The prognostic factors currently identified for prostate carcinoma include preoperative serum PSA, TNM staging system, histological grade and surgical margin status and are composed of the clinically most important and useful parameters. However, all the markers studied have not been applied in clinical practice.

Our aim was to investigate the expression status of Insulin-Like Growth Factor II in benign prostate glands, high grade PIN and prostate adenocarcinoma, and to determine the role of Insulin-Like Growth Factor II in pathogenesis of prostate adenocarcinoma. Material and Method: A total of 70 prostate adenocarcinoma cases accompanied by high grade PIN and benign prostate glands were evaluated by immunohistochemistry for the expression of Insulin-Like Growth Factor II.

40|$|The {{benefits}} of using pin fin heat sinks with multiple perforations are investigated using complementary experimental and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) methods. An experimental heat sink with multiple perforations is designed and fabricated and parameter {{studies of the}} effect of perforated pin fin design on heat transfer and pressure drops across the heat sinks undertaken. Experimental data is found to agree well with predictions from a CFD model for the conjugate heat transfer into the cooling air stream. The validated CFD model is used to carry out a parametric study of the influence of the number and positioning of circular perforations, which shows that the Nusselt number increases monotonically with the number of pin perforations, while the pressure drop and fan power required to overcome the pressure drop all reduce monotonically. Pins with five perforations are shown to have a 11 % larger Nu than for corresponding solid <b>pin</b> <b>cases.</b> These benefits arise due to not only the increased surface area but also heat transfer enhancement near perforations through the formation of localised air jets. In contrast, the locations of the pin perforations are much less influential. When examined in the context of CPU cooling, a conjugate heat transfer analysis shows that improved heat transfer with pin perforations translates into significantly reduced processor case temperatures with the additional benefit of a reduction in the weight of the heat sink’s pins. To achieve these benefits care must be taken to ensure that pin perforations are aligned with the dominant flow direction and manufactured with a good quality surface finish...|$|R
