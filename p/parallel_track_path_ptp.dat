With Opposite Track Path (OTP), used on DVD-Video, the lower layer starts at the ID and the upper layer starts at the OD, where the other layer ends, they share one lead-in and one lead-out.

40|$|Abstract—A phase-clocked loop (PLL) is a {{closed-loop}} {{feedback control}} system which synchronizes its output signal in frequency {{as well as in}} phase with an input signal. The phase detector, the loop filter, and the voltage controlled oscillator are the key parts of almost all PLLs. Within the areas of power electronics and power systems, which are focused on in this paper, the PLLs typically employ a proportional-integral controller as the loop filter, resulting in a type- 2 control system (a control system of type-N has N poles at the origin in its open-loop transfer function). Recently, some {{attempts have been made to}} design type- 3 PLLs, either by employing a specific second-order controller as the loop filter, or by implementing two <b>parallel</b> <b>tracking</b> <b>paths</b> for the PLL. For this type of PLLs, however, the advantages and limitations are not clear at all, as the results reported in different literature are contradictory, and there is no detailed knowledge about their stability and dynamic characteristics. In this paper, different approaches to realize a type- 3 PLL are examined first. Then, a detailed study of dynamics and analysis of stability, followed by comprehensive parameters design guidelines for a typical type- 3 PLL are presented. Finally, to get insight into the advantages/limitations of this type of PLLs, the performance of a well-tuned type- 3 PLL is compared with a conventional synchronous reference frame PLL (which is a type- 2 PLL) through extensive experimental results and some theoretical discussions.

40|$|In {{this paper}} a new {{algorithm}} for multi-targets tracking for roadway environment is proposed. This new approach {{is based on}} two <b>parallel</b> <b>tracking</b> stages. Its objective is to improve associations between targets and tracks by avoiding wrong associations which can cause errors on <b>track’s</b> <b>path</b> determination. Another interesting point of the proposed approach {{lies in the fact}} that the two trackings stages are operated together only when association ambiguities are detected. Otherwise, only one tracking is used. This mecanism leads to save computational resources. This contribution comes after previous works achieved at the LIVIC (Laboratory on interactions between vehicles, road network and drivers) regarding to Multi-Hypothesis Tracking (MHT) using the Dempster-Shafer Theory. These previous works discussed the potential interest of considering at the same time multi-hypothesis solutions instead of mono-hypothesis ones. This new appoach is more focused on the identification of ambiguities, and runs simultaneously two tracking stages in order to solve these ambiguities thanks to multi-cirteria association rules. The paper will therefore explain quickly the basis of the MHT and then describe the Dual Trackings Ambiguities’ Solving (DTAS) algorithm. Eventually, a relevant case of study showing the interest of the DTAS will be discussed...|$|R
40|$|In road {{roughness}} literature different stochastic {{models of}} <b>parallel</b> road <b>tracks</b> are suggested. A new method is proposed {{to evaluate their}} accuracy, by comparison of measured <b>parallel</b> <b>tracks</b> and synthetic <b>parallel</b> <b>tracks,</b> realized from a stochastic model. A model is judged accurate if synthetic and measured roads induce a similar amount of fatigue damage to a vehicle. A lack-of-fit measure is assigned to the evaluated models, facilitating a quick and simple comparison. The uncertainty of the vehicle fatigue indicated for the measured profile is considered {{in the definition of}} the lack-of-fit measure. A bootstrap technique is applied to estimate the uncertainty.

40|$|The {{neutron stars}} in low-mass X-ray {{binaries}} (LMXBs) are usually {{thought to be}} weakly magnetized objects accreting matter from their low-mass companions {{in the form of}} a disk. Albeit weak as compared to those in young neutron-star systems, the neutron-star magnetospheres in LMXBs can play an important role in determining the correlations between spectral and temporal properties. <b>Parallel</b> <b>tracks</b> appearing in the plane of kilohertz (kHz) quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) frequency versus X-ray flux can be used as a tool to study the magnetosphere-disk interaction in neutron-star LMXBs. For dynamically important weak fields, the formation of a non-Keplerian magnetic boundary layer at the innermost disk truncated near the surface of the neutron star is highly likely. Such a boundary region may harbor oscillatory modes of frequencies in the kHz range. We generate <b>parallel</b> <b>tracks</b> using the boundary region model of kHz QPOs. We also present the direct application of our model to the reproduction of the observed <b>parallel</b> <b>tracks</b> of individual sources such as 4 U 1608 [...] 52, 4 U 1636 [...] 53, and Aql X- 1. We reveal how the radial width of the boundary layer must vary in the long-term flux evolution of each source to regenerate the <b>parallel</b> <b>tracks.</b> The run of the radial width looks similar for different sources and can be fitted by a generic model function describing the average steady behavior of the boundary region in the long term. The <b>parallel</b> <b>tracks</b> then correspond to the possible quasi-steady states the source can occupy around the average trend.
