50|$|The GLV {{device is}} built on a silicon wafer and {{consists}} of parallel rows of highly reflective micro-ribbons - ribbons of sizes of a few µm with a top layer of aluminium - suspended above an air gap that are configured such that alternate ribbons (active ribbons are interlaced with static ribbons) can be dynamically actuated. Individual electrical connections to each active ribbon electrode provide for independent actuation. The ribbons and the substrate are electrically conductive so that the deflection of the ribbon can be controlled in an analog manner: When the voltage of the active ribbons is set to ground potential, all ribbons are undeflected, and the device acts as a mirror so the incident light returns along the same path. When a voltage is applied between the ribbon and base conductor an electrical field is generated and deflects the active ribbon downward toward the substrate. This deflection can {{be as big as}} one-quarter wavelength hence creating diffraction effects on incident light that is reflected at an angle that is {{different from that of the}} incident light. The wavelength to diffract is determined by the spatial frequency of the ribbons. As this spatial frequency is determined by the <b>photolithographic</b> <b>mask</b> used to form the GLV device in the CMOS fabrication process, the departure angles can be very accurately controlled, which is useful for optical switching applications.|$|E
