5000|$|The mineral {{sections}} {{when not}} extinguished {{are not only}} bright but are colored and the colors they show depend on several factors, {{the most important of}} which is the strength of the double refraction. If all the sections are of the same thickness as is nearly true of well-made slides, the minerals with strongest double refraction yield the highest <b>polarization</b> <b>colors.</b> The order in which the colors are arranged in what is known as Newton's scale, the lowest being dark grey, then grey, white, yellow, orange, red, purple, blue and so on. The difference between the refractive indexes of the ordinary and the extraordinary ray in quartz is [...]009, and in a rock-section about 1/500 of an inch thick this mineral gives grey and white polarization colours; nepheline with weaker double refraction gives dark grey; augite on the other hand will give red and blue, while calcite with the stronger double refraction will appear pinkish or greenish white. All sections of the same mineral, however, will not have the same color; it was stated above that sections perpendicular to an optic axis will be nearly black, and, in general, the more nearly any section approaches this direction the lower its <b>polarization</b> <b>colors</b> will be. By taking the average, or the highest color given by any mineral, the relative value of its double refraction can be estimated; or if the thickness of the section be precisely known {{the difference between the two}} refractive indexes can be ascertained. If the slides be thick the colors will be on the whole higher than in thin slides.|$|E
5000|$|It {{is often}} {{important}} {{to find out}} whether of the two axes of elasticity (or vibration traces) in the section is that of greater elasticity (or lesser refractive index). The quartz wedge or selenite plate enables us to do this. Suppose a doubly refracting mineral section so placed that it is [...] "extinguished"; if now is rotated through 45 degrees it will be brightly illuminated. If the quartz wedge be passed across it so that the long axis of the wedge is parallel to the axis of elasticity in the section the <b>polarization</b> <b>colors</b> will rise or fall. If they rise the axes of greater elasticity in the two minerals are parallel; if they sink the axis of greater elasticity in the one is parallel to that of lesser elasticity in the other. In the latter case by pushing the wedge sufficiently far complete darkness or compensation will result. Selenite wedges, selenite plates, mica wedges and mica plates are also used for this purpose. A quartz wedge also may be calibrated by determining the amount of double refraction in all parts of its length. If now it be used to produce compensation or complete extinction in any doubly refracting mineral section, we can ascertain what is the strength of the double refraction of the section because it is obviously equal and opposite to that of a known part of the quartz wedge.|$|E

Tetrataenite has been identified optically in over 50 chondrites and mesosiderites, where it is comrnonly distributed as lG- 501,m-sized grains in contact with kamacite, troilite, taenite, and silicate.

40|$|Background: Lesions of odontogenic origin {{comprise}} the heterogeneous group ranging from hamartomatous proliferations, cysts to benign and malignant tumors. Interplay between the epithelium and connective tissue {{can be assumed}} to {{play a significant role}} in the pathogenesis of odontogenic cysts. Aims and Objectives: A study was taken up to show the role of picrosirius red (PSR) stain to demonstrate the fibers and also to assess the difference in the nature of the fibers (different color patterns) and to find out the role of it, if any in the pathogenesis and biological behavior of the commonly occurring odontogenic cysts. Materials and Methods: Collagen fibers of 30 cases of odontogenic cysts (10 radicular cysts, 10 odontogenic keratocysts (OKC′s), and 10 dentigerous cysts) were studied by staining the sections with PSR stain and examining them under bright field and polarizing microscope. Results: Sixty-seven percentage of the thin collagen fibers and 55 % of the thick fibers in radicular cyst showed green-yellow birefringence. Fifty-seven percentage of the thin collagen fibers and 15 % of the thick fibers in OKC showed green-yellow birefringence. Eighty-two percentage of the thin collagen fibers and 66 % of the thick fibers in dentigerous cysts showed green-yellow birefringence. Rest of the fibers showed orange-red birefringence. Statistical analysis with one-way ANOVA was significant with a P < 0. 01 only for thick fibers. Moreover, comparison of <b>polarization</b> <b>colors</b> of thick fibers of odontogenic cysts with duration of the lesion gave statistically significant results. Conclusion: The observations in the present study with respect to color profiles of the collagen fibers in the three commonly occurring odontogenic cysts possibly explain the biological behavior of the lesions. The predominant orange-red birefringence in OKC′s in comparison to radicular and dentigerous cysts suggests that OKC′s exhibit well organized and tightly packed fibers. This may possibly explain the reason for the poorer prognosis of OKC′s. It is suggested that though the epithelium plays an important role in the pathogenesis of these lesions, even stroma is likely to play an equally important role in the pathogenesis and biological behavior...|$|E
40|$|Polarized light {{microscopy}} (PLM) {{is a technique}} which employs the use of polarizing filters to obtain substantial optical property information about the material which is being observed. This information can be combined with other microscopy techniques to confirm or elucidate the identity of an unknown material, determine whether a particular contaminant is present (as with asbestos analysis), or to provide important {{information that can be}} used to refine a manufacturing or chemical process. PLM was the major microscopy technique in use for identification of materials for nearly a century since its introduction in 1834 by William Fox Talbot, as other techniques such as SEM (Scanning Electron Microscopy), FTIR (Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy), XPD (X-ray Powder Diffraction), and TEM (Transmission Electron Microscopy) had not yet been developed. Today, it is still the only technique approved by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for asbestos analysis, and is often the technique first applied for identification of unknown materials. PLM uses different configurations in order to determine different material properties. With each configuration additional clues can be gathered, leading to a conclusion of material identity. With no polarizing filter, the microscope can be used just as a stereo optical microscope, and view qualities such as morphology, size, and number of phases. With a single polarizing filter (single polars), additional properties can be established, such as pleochroism, individual refractive indices, and dispersion staining. With two polarizing filters (crossed polars), even more can be deduced: isotropy vs. anisotropy, extinction angle, birefringence/degree of birefringence, sign of elongation, and anomalous <b>polarization</b> <b>colors,</b> among others. With the use of PLM many of these properties can be determined in a matter of seconds, even for those who are not highly trained. McCrone, a leader in the field of polarized {{light microscopy}}, often advised, If you cant determine a specific optical property of a particle after two minutes, move onto another configuration. Since optical properties can be seen so very quickly and easily under polarized light, it is only necessary to spend a maximum of two minutes on a technique to determine a particular property, though often only a few seconds are required...|$|E

Dusts are made of small particles which are characterised by their size (radius), composition (matter), and structure (morphology, including porosity). In the present work, we {{address the question of}} the role of the dust particle porosity on light <b>polarization</b> and <b>color,</b> using Discrete Dipole Approximation (DDA) light scattering code. To answer this question, we developed an algorithm to generate solid particles of arbitrary values of porosity. In brief, the model considers a given homogeneous structure made of touching dipoles. The dipoles are randomly removed one by one, such that the remaining structure remains connected. We stop the removal process when the desired poros- ity is obtained. Then we study the optical properties of the porous particle. That way, we show how the proper value of the porosity affects the <b>polarization</b> and <b>color</b> of the light scattered by these porous particles.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{introduces}} {{a new twist}} on stereoscopic displays—one that has similarities to existing methods in that it utilizes both <b>polarization</b> and <b>color</b> to present different stereo 3 D perspectives to each eye, but by combining the use of polar-ization and color, it avoids weaknesses associated with previous methods. This new method is named Mixed <b>Polarization</b> 3 D. <b>Color</b> imbalance artifacts associated with anaglyph methods of 3 D are avoided by alternating the colors presented to each eye. Flicker, associated with polarization-sequential 3 D, or the need to increase the frame rate to at least 120 Hz to avoid this perceived flicker, is avoided in mixed polarization 3 D by presenting both eyes with 3 D information in every single frame. It is particularly aimed at use in scanned laser projectors where all three primary colors (R, G, B) are already polarized and simultaneously displayed. Like other polarization-based approaches, it {{requires the use of}} a polarization-preserving screen and inexpensive passive polariza-tion glasses.

40|$|Be stars exhibit {{variability}} for a {{great number}} of observables. Putting the pieces of the disk dynamics together is not an easy task and requires arduous modeling before achieving a good fit to the observational data. In order to guide the modeling process and make it more efficient, it is very instructive to investigate reference dynamical cases. This paper focuses on continuum polarimetric quantities and is the second of a series that aims to demonstrate the capacity of deriving the dynamical history and fundamental parameters of a classical Be star through follow-up of various observables. After a detailed study of the different opacities at play in the formation of polarized spectra, we investigate predictions of polarimetric observables in the continuum for different dynamical scenarios. Our models are based on a coupling of a hydrodynamic viscous decretion simulations in a disk and a three-dimensional non-LTE radiative transfer code. Through introduction of the <b>polarization</b> <b>color</b> diagram (PCD), we show that certain combinations of polarimetric observables exhibit features that are characteristic of a mass-loss history. This diagram also enables estimates of fundamental parameters such as the inclination angle, disk density scale, and the 3 ̆b 1 viscous diffusion parameter.

We expand on our pilot observational study of this phenomenon, and report the detailed analysis of a long-term (1989 - 2004) spectropolarimetric survey of 9 additional classical Be stars, including systems exhibiting evidence of partial disk-loss/disk-growth episodes as well as systems exhibiting long-term stable disks. After carefully characterizing and removing the interstellar polarization {{along the line of}} sight to each of these targets, we analyze their intrinsic polarization behavior. We find that many steady-state Be disks pause {{at the top of the}} PCD, as predicted by theory. We also observe sharp declines in the Balmer jump polarization for later spectral type, near edge-on steady-state disks, again as recently predicted by theory, likely caused when the base density of the disk is very high, and the outer region of the edge-on disk starts to self absorb a significant number of Balmer jump photons. The intrinsic V-band polarization and polarization position angle of γ Cas exhibits variations that seem to phase with the orbital period of a known one-armed density structure in this disk, similar to the theoretical predictions of Halonen & Jones. We also observe stochastic jumps in the intrinsic polarization across the Balmer jump of several known Be+sdO systems, and speculate that the thermal inflation of part of the outer region of these disks could be responsible for producing this observational phenomenon. Finally, we estimate the base densities of this sample of stars to be between ≈ 8 × 10 ^- 11 to ≈ 4 × 10 ^- 12 g cm^- 3 during quasi steady state periods given there maximum observed polarization.

Of specific interest to electrical engineers are long lines, electrochemical processes, dielectric <b>polarization,</b> <b>colored</b> noise, viscoelastic materials, and chaos. With the growing number of applications, it is important to establish a theory of control for these fractional-order systems, and for the potential use of fractional-order systems as feedback compensators. This topic is addressed in this paper. The first section discusses the control of fractional-order systems using a vector space representation, where initialization is included in the discussion. It should be noted that Bagley and Calico and Padovan and Sawicki both present a fractional state-space representation, which do not include the important historic effects. Incorporation of these effects based on the initialized fractional calculus is presented. The control methods presented in this paper are based on the initialized fractional order system theory. The second section presents an input-output approach.

Results of an ongoing survey of polarized starlight are analyzed with the goal of linking the interstellar magnetic field that shapes the heliosphere to the nearby field in interstellar space. New results for the direction of the nearby ISMF, based on a merit function that utilizes polarization position angles, identify several magnetic components. The dominant interstellar field, B_pol, is aligned with the direction L,B= 36. 2, 49. 0 (+/- 16. 0) degrees and is within 8 degrees of the IBEX Ribbon ISMF direction. Stars tracing B_pol have the same mean distance as stars that do not trace B_pol, but show weaker polarizations consistent with lower column densities of polarizing grains. The variations in the polarization position angle directions indicate a low level of magnetic turbulence. B_pol is found after excluding polarizations that trace a separate magnetic structure that apparently is due to interstellar dust deflected around the heliosphere. Local interstellar cloud velocities relative to the LSR increase with the angles between the LSR velocities and ISMF, indicating that the kinematics of local interstellar material is ordered by the ISMF. <b>Polarization</b> and <b>color</b> excess data are consistent with an extension of Loop I to the solar vicinity.

40|$|This Letter {{describes}} near-infrared polarimetry of the {{zodiacal light}} at 2. 2 micrometers, measured with the Diffuse Infrared Background Experiment (DIRBE) aboard the Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE) spacecraft. The polarization {{is due to}} scattering of sunlight. The polarization vector is perpendicular to the scattering plane, and its observed amplitude on the ecliptic equator at an elongation of 90 deg and ecliptic longitude of 10 deg declines from 12. 0 +/- 0. 4 % at 1. 25 micrometers to 8. 0 +/- 0. 6 % at 3. 5 micrometers (cf. 16 % in the visible); the principal source of uncertainty is photometric noise due to stars. The observed near-infrared colors at this location are redder than Solar, but at 3. 5 micrometers this is due {{at least in part}} to the thermal emission contribution from the interplanetary dust. Mie theory calculations show that both <b>polarizations</b> and <b>colors</b> are important in constraining models of interplanetary dust...|$|R
40|$|The planned {{space shuttle}} mission STS- 4 {{will use the}} Skylab flight spare ten-color (near UV to near IR) photopolarimeter with boresighted 16 mm camera. This 164 -hour mission will observe the zodiacal light to within {{approximately}} 20 deg of the sun (in {{and out of the}} ecliptic). The mission consists of several distinct phases: (1) tail-to-sun (TTS), belly to earth for 18 hours; (2) nose-to-sun, solar inertial for 79 hours; (3) bay-to-sun for 26 hours; and (4) passive thermal control for 37 hours. During the TTS phase, where most observations are scheduled, the instrument will scan back and forth in elevation at 4 deg/sec while the orbiter moves across the sky at its 4 deg/min orbital rate. The combined orbiter/instrument motion will result in a saw-tooth pattern of observations projected on the sky (between the 14 deg and 120 deg elevation limits) and will enable extensive measurements of the brightness, <b>polarization</b> and <b>color</b> of the background starlight to be made...|$|R
40|$|The typical {{extinction}} curve for the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), {{in contrast}} to that for the Galaxy, has no bump at 2175 ˚A and has a steeper rise into the far ultraviolet. For the Galaxy {{the interpretation of the}} extinction and, therefore, the dust content of the interstellar medium has been greatly assisted by measurements of the wavelength dependence of the polarization. To the present no such measurements existed for the SMC. Therefore, to further elucidate the dust properties in the SMC we have for the first time measured linear <b>polarization</b> in five <b>colors</b> in the optical region of the spectrum...|$|R
40|$|A {{technique}} for {{the identification of}} individual anisotropic grains in a heterogeneous and opaque material involves the observation of grain color in reflected light through crossed polarizers (<b>color</b> of <b>polarization).</b> Such <b>colors</b> are generally characteristic of particular phases. When grains of {{many members of the}} class of hole carrier cuprate superconductors are so viewed at room temperature with a 'daylight' source, a characteristic <b>color</b> of <b>polarization</b> is observed. This color was studied in many of these cuprate superconductors and a strong correlation was found between color and the existence of superconductivity. Two members were also examined of the electron cuprate superconductors and it was found that they possess the same <b>color</b> of <b>polarization</b> as the hole carrier cuprate superconductors so far examined. The commonality of the characteristic color regardless of charge carrier indicates that the presence of this color is independent of carrier type. The correlation of this color with the existence of superconductivity in the cuprate superconductors suggests that the origin of the color relates to the origin of superconductivity. Photometric techniques are also discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{elimination}} of the residual image problem which plagued previous Mariner imaging systems allowed photometry of moderately high quality {{to be carried out}} on Mercury by Mariner 10. The conclusions from the photometric analysis are as follows. To a surface resolution of 20 km, Mercury is covered with a dark fine-grained soil similar to the lunar regolith. No regions having anomalous <b>polarization</b> or <b>color</b> were discovered, which might have implied large amounts of metallic Fe or exposed bare rock. Photoclinometry suggests that the center of the Caloris Basin may be about 9 km below the outside rim. The heavily cratered plains have albedos of about 0. 17, somewhat brighter than the lunar highlands. The albedos of the darker smooth plains and the interiors of bright fresh craters are systematically higher than their lunar counterparts. One consistent interpretation of the color and albedo relationships is that the dark smooth plains resemble the low-Ti, low-Fe lunar maria and that the crust is generally low in Ti, metallic Fe, and Fe(3 +) ...|$|R
