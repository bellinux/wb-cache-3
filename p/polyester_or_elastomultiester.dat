5000|$|Windpants {{are similar}} to sweatpants but are lighter and shield the wearer from cold wind rather than insulate. Windpants are {{typically}} made of <b>polyester</b> <b>or</b> nylon, with a liner made of cotton <b>or</b> <b>polyester.</b> The nylon material's natural friction against both itself and human legs makes [...] "swooshing" [...] sounds during walking.

50|$|V-belts may be {{homogeneously}} rubber or polymer throughout, {{or there}} may be fibers embedded in the rubber or polymer for strength and reinforcement. The fibers may be of textile materials such as cotton, polyamide (such as Nylon) <b>or</b> <b>polyester</b> <b>or,</b> for greatest strength, of steel or aramid (such as Twaron or Kevlar).|$|R
50|$|Modern {{surfboards}} {{are made}} of polyurethane or polystyrene foam covered with layers of fiberglass cloth, and <b>polyester</b> <b>or</b> epoxy resin. The result is a light and strong surfboard that is buoyant and maneuverable. Recent developments in surfboard technology have included the use of carbon fiber and kevlar composites. Each year, approximately 400,000 surfboards are manufactured.|$|R
50|$|The fibre used to {{make the}} fabric is {{traditionally}} worsted wool, but may also be cotton, texturised <b>polyester,</b> <b>or</b> a blend. Gabardine is woven as a warp-faced steep or regular twill, with a prominent diagonal rib on the face and smooth surface on the back. Gabardine always has many more warp than weft yarns.|$|R
5000|$|... "The WDFPF offers both {{equipped}} and unequipped lifting. In the equipped division single ply bench shirts {{are allowed}} in <b>polyester</b> <b>or</b> denim. Canvas and open backed shirts are not allowed. Single ply lifting suits are allowed in polyester. Canvas and denim are not allowed. Briefs are not legal. Knee wraps are fine up to 2m".|$|R
50|$|The {{bodies are}} {{prevented}} from decay by {{a means of}} a rubberization process patented in the 1970s by anatomist Gunther von Hagens. The essence of the process is the replacement of water and fatty material in {{the cells of the}} body first by acetone and then by plastics, such as silicone rubber, <b>polyester</b> <b>or</b> epoxy resin.|$|R
50|$|Poplin is {{now made}} with wool, cotton, silk, rayon, <b>polyester</b> <b>or</b> {{a mixture of}} these. Being a plain under/over weave, if the weft and warp threads are of the same {{material}} and size, the effect is a plain woven surface with no ribbing. Shirts made from this material are easy to iron and do not wrinkle easily.|$|R
