30|$|A major {{financial}} institution in an OECD country donated two de-identified samplings of their data that were collected {{over the period}} between July 2014 and July 2015. The samples comprise demographic information, credit card transactions, money transfers, and electronic fund transfers (EFT) of over 100 thousand (Sample-A) and 60 thousand (Sample-B) customers. Sample-A and Sample-B contain in total roughly 45 millions and 22 millions of transactions, respectively. Both samples were drawn from a much larger sampling of 450 thousand customers who were located in a major metropolitan city, updated their home and work addresses since January 2012, and made at least one credit card transaction during the sampling period. Sample-A was drawn randomly from this larger set whereas Sample-B was drawn from the same set such that each customer has at least 10 credit card transactions, and in total around 60 % of all the credit card transactions were performed with point of sale (<b>POS)</b> <b>machines</b> of the bank donating the data. Bank officials reported that de-identification of Sample-A and B was done independently precluding determination {{of the number of}} customers contained by both of the samplings. Customers may prefer to use their credit cards on the <b>POS</b> <b>machines</b> of other banks. In that case, some part of the transaction information such as location cannot be collected by the bank issuing the credit card. The bank also donated monthly segmentation information for each customer.

30|$|In many {{developed}} countries, consumers added {{debit cards}} to their wallets during the 1980 s as devices to access cash at ATMs. At that time, banks aimed to move some front-desk customer services away from branches {{in order to}} increase efficiency and service. During 1990 s banks also aimed to foster the use of cards at the point of sale for purchase transactions as a source of fee income, installing POS card payment devices. As noted by Amromin and Chakravorti (2009), in most economies debit cards are first added—for the most part unknowingly—to consumers’ wallets as a device to access cash at ATMs. With the adoption of <b>POS</b> <b>machines</b> by merchants, debit cards can be alternatively used to make purchases. Hence, the final usage of debit cards will depend on consumers’ attitudes {{as well as on the}} availability of POS and ATMs.|$|R

40|$|The recent {{advances}} on information technology have made tremendous change on traditional banking. These days, {{people do not}} carry cash and prefer to use electronic devices such as point of sale system (POS) or PIN entry devices (PinPad) to do desirable transactions. These technologies could facilitate e-business and increase profitability in various industries including banking sector. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to investigate the effect of five new products namely ATM, <b>POS</b> <b>Machines,</b> PinPad machines, online and swift branches on banking performance indicators including return on assets (ROA), return on equities (ROE) and operating investment return (OIR). We use the information of 19 private and governmental banks, which were active in Iran over the period of 2005 - 2010. The study uses linear regression analysis as well as VAR technique to study the effects of the independent variables on bank performance indicators. The results indicate that while there are some weak and positive relationships between three technology indicators including POS, PinPad and online businesses and ROA as well as ROE, there is relatively strong and positive relationship between these three independent variables and OIR. In addition, while the results of VAR analysis have shown that any reduction on PinPad will reduce OIR but this reduction will disappear after approximately four periods...|$|R
30|$|However, recent {{monetary}} growth in India {{needs to be}} adjusted for inflation, which often reached double digits. In Table  6, we present the Wholesale Price Index (WPI) adjusted monetary values for 2016. Based on adjusted WPI, the aggregate monetary value has grown by 17.4 %, while the growth in per transaction amounts is around 1 %. This implies that, while more individuals are making more electronic transactions, the amounts they typically spend per transaction are stagnant. In fact, several show negative growth rates. The amounts withdrawn from ATMs per transaction have a positive growth rate (0.2 %), while the amount per transaction at POS have a negative growth rate (− 5.2 %) This clearly establishes that demand for currency in the system has not decreased, but other attractive payment avenues have compensated the demand for cash. The aggregate monetary transaction values, as well as per transaction amount, have grown significantly with mobile banking (126.6 % and 49.3 %, respectively). In comparison, the growth rate in India has outpaced that of the EU {{in the last two}} years (Table  1). First, for India, the number of ATM transactions as well as the monetary volume withdrawn has increased, whereas it has decreased in the EU, indicating a substitution of cash for the latter. However, the growth rates in terms of transactions, ATMs, or <b>POS</b> <b>machines</b> in India outweigh those of the EU. This is partly owing to the low base effect in India, but also due to systemic reasons. Second, the growth of cashless payments in India is primarily driven by mobile payments.|$|R
40|$|Food {{insecurity}} is {{a complex}} global problem. Approximately one in eight humans struggle daily with insufficient access to adequate nutrition. India accounts for the largest share of the world 2 ̆ 7 s food insecure, despite {{more than four decades}} of state subsidized and controlled food production, distribution and consumption through its public distribution system (PDS). Chhattisgarh is a key state representing the turnaround made possible through the implementation of administrative and technological innovations to improve transparency and efficiency in the PDS. ^ The present dissertation examines in detail possible reasons underlying improvements in the performance of the PDS in Chhattisgarh. The objectives of this dissertation were: (i) to identify stakeholders in the public distribution system, specifically those involved in its rice supply chain; (ii) to understand how rice supply chain stakeholders interpreted indicators of agri-food supply chain performance; (iii) to examine technology acceptance and adoption among key stakeholders involved in food distribution, who were adopting a novel, mandatory e-governance intervention for increasing transparency and efficiency of operations; (iv) to situate existing models theorizing technology acceptance in the context of public food distribution in Chhattisgarh, India by integrating existing and new variables into a technology acceptance model predicting both direct and indirect effects on stakeholder satisfaction with technology. ^ Objectives (i) and (ii) were achieved through a descriptive, exploratory case study was designed to generate and analyze observational, interview, document-based and archival data. The objective was to understand how empirically derived measures of agri-food supply chain performance assume relevance for stakeholders in the rice supply chain of Chhattisgarh 2 ̆ 7 s PDS. It was found that multiple stakeholders including farmers, the Chhattisgarh Marketing Federation (CGMARKFED), rice millers, the Chhattisgarh State Civil Supplies Corporation (CGSCSC), the Food Corporation of India (FCI), Fair Price Shops (FPSs), and beneficiaries, operating across {{the public and private sectors}} constitute the rice supply chain of Chhattisgarh. Stakeholders exhibit considerable variation from the literature with regard to their perception of key indicators for measuring agri-food supply chain performance. Specific performance indicators assume importance at different stages in the rice supply chain. Farmers and rice millers reported measuring flexibility and efficiency during procurement and distribution respectively. Whereas, flexibility and efficiency measures were not observed being measured during storage. Responsiveness was emphasized by state organizations responsible for procurement and storage, rice millers during processing, and fair price shops that are responsible for distributing food to beneficiaries. The quality of food remained a prime concern for all stakeholders across procurement, processing, storage, and, distribution. It is proposed that stakeholder needs may be better addressed by adapting performance indicators from the literature to better meet their context of use. ^ Objectives (iii) and (iv) were realized through the validation of a model drawing on the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) (cite) to predict the direct and indirect influences on the satisfaction of fair price shop (FPS) salesperson using smart card-based <b>POS</b> <b>machines</b> to distribute food to households in Chhattisgarh. It was found that the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology is a reliable and valid model explaining the adoption of technology by stakeholders in the PDS. In addition, several contextual factors including age, education level, experience with technology, and experience with operations were observed to moderate the impact of key UTAUT variables on salesperson satisfaction with smart card-based <b>POS</b> <b>machines.</b> In sum, the results discussed herein highlight the importance and need for continued research on the locally relevant methods and measures for technology adoption and performance measurement in agricultural supply chains. ...|$|R

5000|$|In Ireland, Laser, {{which was}} co-branded with Maestro, has been {{replaced}} by Visa Debit and Debit MasterCard. The Laser debit card has been phased out by all banks and ceased to operate from March 2014. Irish Laser cards carried Maestro co-branding from 2008 onwards. They were intended to be used with chip and PIN POS systems. The chip on the card was programmed with two applications, one for Laser and one for Maestro. POS transactions were normally processed over the Laser network in Ireland and the Maestro network when the card was used abroad. Some POS terminals prompted users to manually select Laser or Maestro before completing the transaction. Laser cards could be processed as Maestro in most POS terminals worldwide for chip and PIN or swipe and sign transactions (where still accepted). Internet and telephone-based retailers, however, needed to be set up specifically to accept Irish Laser/Maestro cards. Transactions made with these cards were often secured by MasterCard's SecureCode system to verify the cardholder's identity. These cards were usually multi-functional and operated as a debit card as well as an ATM Card which could be used for accessing ATMs. Some banks also allowed customers to use their cards to deposit or withdraw money over the counter or at An Post post offices using their debit card and PIN. Historically the cards often contained a Cheque guarantee card function indicated by a hologram. This scheme was shut down in 2011. Foreign-issued Maestro cards are still accepted in Ireland in ATMs and by many <b>POS</b> <b>machines.</b> However, acceptance of Visa and MasterCard debit/credit cards is more reliably universal at POS terminals.|$|R

Some state governments {{in the country and}} the federal government have ignorantly expected the Sanusi’s experiments to benefit their financial management for the economy and efficiency of the payment system, to manage government payment systems of all sorts including revenue generation.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} impact of {{newspaper}} publications about debit card skimming fraud on debit card usage in the Netherlands using daily information from January 1 st 2005 to December 31 st 2008. Time-series analyses are employed to assess the daily fluctuations in aggregate debit card usage. The results show that newspaper articles that somehow make mention of the phenomenon of skimming fraud significantly affect the number of debit card payments. The direction of the effect depends {{on the type of}} skimming fraud addressed. Newspaper articles on fraud at points-of-sale (<b>POS)</b> and ticket <b>machines</b> depress the number of debit card payments. News on ATM fraud, by contrast, has a positive effect on debit card payments. This indicates that the temporarily created fear for using the debit card at the ATM is not automatically translated into fear for using the debit card at the POS. Instead, ATMs and POS terminals are perceived as substitutes. Although significant, all media effects found are relatively small in comparison with other factors such as calendar and holiday effects and daily rainfall. Moreover, the effects only last for one day, with consumers immediately reverting back to their regular payment behaviour. This corresponds to earlier results found in other research fields and suggests that consumers 2 ̆ 019 confidence in the debit card is relatively sturdy and not easily affected.

40|$|In this thesis, three {{possible}} aspects of using linguistic (i. e. morpho-syntactic) knowledge for {{statistical machine translation}} are described: the treatment of syntactic differences between source and target language using source <b>POS</b> tags, statistical <b>machine</b> translation {{with a small amount}} of bilingual training data, and automatic error analysis of translation output. Reorderings in the source language based on the POS tags are systematically investigated: local reorderings of nouns and adjectives for the Spanish-English language pair and long-range reorderings of verbs for the German-English language pair. Both types of reorderings result in better performance of the translation system, local reordering being more important for the scarce training corpora. For such corpora, strategies for achieving an acceptable translation quality by applying appropriate morpho-syntactic transformations are exploited for three language pairs: Spanish-English, German-English and Serbian-English. Very scarce task-specific corpora as well as conventional dictionaries are used as bilingual training material. In addition to conventional dictionaries, the use of phrasal lexica is proposed and investigated. A framework for automatic analysis and classification of actual errors in translation output based on combining existing automatic evaluation measures with linguistic information is presented. Experiments on different types of corpora and various language pairs show that the results of automatic error analysis correlate very well with the results of human evaluation. The new metrics based on analysed error categories are used for comparison of different translation systems trained on various sizes of texts with and without morpho-syntactic transformations. For improving the quality of a statistical machine translation system by the use of morpho-syntactic information, the choice of the method and the significance of improvements strongly depend on the language pair, the translation direction and the nature of the corpus. Error analysis of the translation output is important in order to define weak points of the system and apply methods for improvement in the optimal way...|$|R
