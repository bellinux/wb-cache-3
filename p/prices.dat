The combined effect of declining <b>prices</b> of textiles and rising <b>prices</b> of livestock products produced dramatic improvements in the terms of trade, which rose 377% between 1810 and 1825 in local <b>prices.</b> Several governors waged campaigns against the natives to increase the available lands, from Juan Manuel de Rosas to Julio Argentino Roca.|$|E

5|$|Because of the {{long-term}} effects of inflation, notably the significant increase of movie theater ticket <b>prices,</b> the list unadjusted for inflation gives far more weight to later films. The unadjusted list, while commonly found in the press, is therefore largely meaningless for comparing films widely separated in time, as many films from earlier eras will never appear on a modern unadjusted list, despite achieving higher commercial success when adjusted for price increases. To compensate for the devaluation of the currency, some charts make adjustments for inflation, but not even this practice fully addresses the issue since ticket <b>prices</b> and inflation do not necessarily parallel one another. For example, in 1970, tickets cost $1.55 or about $6.68 in inflation-adjusted 2004 dollars; by 1980, <b>prices</b> had risen to about $2.69, a drop to $5.50 in inflation-adjusted 2004 dollars.
