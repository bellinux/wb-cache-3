Since such lesions do not result in any sensory deficits, shortcomings have been explained in terms of a lack of attentional processing, for which the parietal cortex plays a large role.

5|$|A simple model which predicts lyotropic phase {{transitions}} is the hard-rod model {{proposed by}} Lars Onsager. This theory considers the volume {{excluded from the}} center-of-mass of one idealized cylinder as it approaches another. Specifically, if the cylinders are oriented <b>parallel</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>another,</b> {{there is very little}} volume that is excluded from the center-of-mass of the approaching cylinder (it can come quite close to the other cylinder). If, however, the cylinders are at some angle to one another, then there is a large volume surrounding the cylinder which the approaching cylinder's center-of-mass cannot enter (due to the hard-rod repulsion between the two idealized objects). Thus, this angular arrangement sees a decrease in the net positional entropy of the approaching cylinder (there are fewer states available to it).|$|E
5|$|Marasmius sasicola {{produces}} colourless, ellipsoid basidiospores {{of between}} 8 and 10 by 4 to 6micrometres (μm). The spores have no ornamentation, are not amyloid and have thin cell walls. In his examinations, Takahashi did not observe any basidia, {{but he did}} describe the club-shaped basidioles (immature basidia) which measured from 18 to 26 by 6 to 10μm. The tightly packed cheilocystidia (cystidia {{on the edge of}} the gill) form a sterile edge to the gill, and there are no pleurocystidia (cystidia on the face of the gill). The pileipellis, the top layer of the cap, forms a hymeniderm, a cell structure reminiscent of the hymenium on the gills. This is made up of club-shaped cells measuring between 2 and 8 by 7 to 10μm, with reddish-brown, smooth cell walls up to 1μm thick.

The gill tissue is made of hyphae that project downward from the cap and arranged in a subparallel fashion, meaning that the hyphae are mostly <b>parallel</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>another</b> and are slightly intertwined.

40|$|Given that an extant {{comprehensive}} study of homosexuality and the twentieth century Irish novel has yet to produced, this thesis is an attempt at rectifying such a gap in research by way of close textual analysis of writing from {{the latter half of}} the century—that is, from 1960 - 2000. Analysis of seven novels by four male authors – John Broderick, Desmond Hogan, Colm Tóibín and Keith Ridgway – lead <b>to</b> <b>one</b> overarching feature common to all four writers becoming clear: the homosexual or queer is always dying or already ‘dead’. ‘Dead’ is placed in inverted commas here as it is not only biological death that characterises the fate of gay men in the aforementioned literature. In the first instance, such men are also always already ‘dead’—that is, by light of their disenfranchisement as homosexual or queer, they are, in socialized terms, examples of the ‘living’ dead. Secondly, biological death neither fully obliterates the queer body nor its disruptive influence. Consequently, one of the overarching ways in which I read queer death in the late twentieth century Irish novel is through the prism of its reparative ‘afterw(a) ord’. On the one hand, such readings are temporally based (that is, reading from a point beyond the death of the protagonist - or their ‘afterward’); while, on the other hand, such readings are stylistically premised (that is, reading or interpreting the narrative itself as an ‘afterword’). The current project thus constitutes an original contribution to knowledge by establishing variant ways of reading the contemporary Irish novel from the point of view of the queer ‘unliving’. In assessing such heterogeneous aspects of contemporary queer death, the project a) contributes to recent, largely Anglo-American-based literary theoretical research on the queer and the eschatological, and b) provides a more contemporized literary base upon which future research can uncover a continuum of Irish queer writing in the twentieth century, one concerned with writing prior to 1960 and not limited to writing my men, in which death and same-sex desire are at <b>parallel</b> angles <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>another...</b>|$|R

In previous studies we reported a method for the isolation of GTCs and showed that each ellipsoidal thread cell normally contains a single tapered thread which is uniquely coiled into a space-saving conformation and occupies most of the cell volume. Subsequently, the developing thread was found to consist mainly of intermediate filaments (IFs) aligned in <b>parallel</b> not only <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>another</b> but also <b>to</b> a far fewer number of interspersed microtubules (see accompanying paper). In the present report, urea extracts of GTCs were purified and characterized to establish the properties of thread components. One major (a) and two minor (ß, y) components prepared by anion exchange chromatography were shown to have similar apparent molecular weights of 63, 500 ± 500 daltons but different isoelectric pH values (a, 7. 56; ß, 5. 67; y, 5. 31). Although the amino acid content of a differed significantly from ß and y, each of the three was highest in Gly, relatively high in Glx, Ser, Thr, Asx, Ala, Val, and Leu, and relatively low in Cys/ 2 and Trp. The amino acid compositions of ß and y were very similar, and only ß showed evidence of carbohydrate...|$|R
