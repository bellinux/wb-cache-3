5|$|Abebe ran the 1963 Boston Marathon, {{finishing}} {{fifth in}} 2:24:43, {{the only time}} in his competitive career that he completed an international marathon without winning. He and countryman Mamo Wolde, who finished 12th, had run together on record <b>pace</b> <b>for</b> 18 miles, until cold winds and the hills in Newton caused both to fall back. The race was won by Belgium's Aurele Vandendriessche in a course record 2:18:58. Abebe returned to Ethiopia and did not compete in another marathon until 1964 in Addis Ababa. Abebe won that race in a time of 2:23:14.8.|$|E
5|$|Due to the NHL lockout, {{as well as}} rib {{and knee}} {{injuries}} sustained during the 2004 World Cup, Jovanovski was inactive during the 2004–05 season. When the NHL resumed play in 2005–06, Jovanovski was on <b>pace</b> <b>for</b> a career year, but his season was interrupted by groin, foot and abdominal injuries. He finished with 33 points in 44 games for a career-high 0.75 points-per-game average. The Canucks suffered from Jovanovski missing the final 27 {{games of the season}} and did not qualify for the 2006 playoffs. Following the 2005–06 season, Jovanovski did not receive a contract offer from the Canucks, subsequently becoming an unrestricted free agent. The decision to let him go was influenced by the re-signings of Daniel and Henrik Sedin, as well as the acquisition of goaltender Roberto Luongo, leaving no room on the team's salary cap to retain Jovanovski.|$|E
5|$|Early that month, the Stavka issued {{orders to}} Southwestern Strategic Direction {{headquarters}} for an offensive in the region, after the victories following the Rostov Strategic Offensive Operation and the Barvenkovo–Lozovaya Offensive Operation in the Donbas region. The forces of Marshal Semyon Timoshenko and Lieutenant General Kirill Moskalenko penetrated German positions {{along the northern}} Donets River, east of Kharkov. Fighting continued into April, with Moskalenko crossing the river and establishing a tenuous bridgehead at Izium. In the south, the Soviet 6th Army had limited success defending against German forces, which managed to keep a bridgehead of their own on the east bank of the river. Catching the attention of Stalin, it set the <b>pace</b> <b>for</b> the prelude to the eventual offensive intended to reach Pavlohrad and Sinelnikovo and eventually Kharkov and Poltava.|$|E

5|$|Taylor rebounded in {{the early}} stages of what many thought would be his final season in 1992. Through close to nine games Taylor was on <b>pace</b> <b>for</b> 10 sacks and the Giants were 5–4. However, a {{ruptured}} Achilles tendon suffered in a game on November 8, 1992 against Green Bay sidelined him for the final seven games, during which the team went 1–6. Before the injury Taylor had missed only four games due to injury in his 12-year career. Throughout the 1992 season, and the ensuing offseason, Taylor was noncommittal about his future, alternately saying he might retire, then later hinting he wanted a longer-term contract.|$|E
5|$|Although {{rain fell}} on Saturday morning, the track had dried by {{the start of}} the final free {{practice}} session. Lewis Hamilton again set the fastest time with 1:25.624, less than two-tenths of a second in front of teammate Rosberg, with Sebastian Vettel in third position close behind. The fastest times had been set on the super-soft tyre compound. However, Mercedes's advantage over Ferrari proved more significant, up to seven-tenths of a second on the harder soft compound, the tyre most likely {{to be used in the}} race. Toro Rosso confirmed their good <b>pace</b> <b>for</b> the weekend with fourth and sixth place for Carlos Sainz and Max Verstappen respectively, being about half a second quicker than their sister team, Red Bull Racing. A major incident occurred just seconds after the beginning of the practice session, when Rio Haryanto and Romain Grosjean collided in the pit lane. Both cars needed to equip new front wings and Haas also changed the floor on Grosjean's car. Haryanto was later issued a three-place grid penalty for the incident, as well as two penalty points added to his licence.|$|E

Young had been on <b>pace</b> <b>for</b> a perfect game through 5⅔ innings. Young also took a no-hitter into the eighth inning on May 30 against the Colorado Rockies as a prelude to his June performance. In that game, which marked the first time a pitcher took a no-hitter into the eighth inning during the 2006 season, he {{surrendered}} a double to Brad Hawpe, who had been a teammate in the 1997 Connie Mack World Series, on his first pitch of the eighth inning and 99th of the game. During Young's next start on June 4 at Pittsburgh, he did not allow a hit for the first 5⅓ innings, making him one of only two pitchers (Steve Trachsel – June 20–25, 2002) to have consecutive starts with at least five hitless innings since the 2000 season.|$|E

5|$|Again, the day's {{principal}} breakaway {{was given}} a large time gap. After , Andrey Amador, Davide Malacarne, Mathew Hayman, Fabian Wegmann and Jens Mouris had a lead of over 11 minutes. The parcours began to take its toll at this point, and as the chase ramped up in the peloton, the time gap fell precipitously. By the time the ascent of the Sasso Tetto began, Mouris was gapped off and lost {{more and more time}} as the day went on, eventually finishing 21 minutes behind the stage winner. Hayman and Wegmann kept the <b>pace</b> <b>for</b> a while, and Wegmann won the day's second climb, the Camerino at , but eventually only Amador and Malacarne were left out front. The second group on the road eventually reduced itself to just a select group of overall favorites and contenders. Amador attacked first on the finishing circuit, but Malacarne made the bridge. Instead of working together to stay away and let a two-up sprint decide the stage winner, Amador and Malacarne sat on one another's wheels and let their rapidly falling advantage dwindle even further. From the elite group of contenders, Pinotti put in an attack on an uphill section of the finishing circuit that effectively gapped off race leader Robert Gesink, who had used up all of his support riders at this point. Gesink finished 17 seconds back on the day, losing the race leadership.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND [...] In September 1990 {{a working}} {{party of the}} British Pacing and Electrophysiology Group {{recommended}} the routine use of physiological pacing systems in patients with bradycardia. An audit {{of the impact of}} these recommendations on pacemaker prescription in the Freeman Hospital between March 1990 and August 1991 has previously been reported. This paper considers the effect of that internal audit on subsequent pacemaker prescription from September 1991 to February 1993. PATIENTS AND METHODS [...] The records of 1228 patients who underwent first pacemaker implantation at the Freeman Hospital between March 1990 and February 1993 were audited retrospectively. The patient's age, indication <b>for</b> <b>pacing,</b> pacing mode, and cost of the generator and leads were recorded. The indications <b>for</b> <b>pacing</b> were sinus node dysfunction (24. 9 %) (including patients with coexistent sinus node dysfunction and atrioventricular block), atrioventricular block (57. 2 %), atrioventricular block and atrial fibrillation (12. 2 %), and carotid sinus syndrome (5. 7 %). There was an increase in carotid sinus syndrome (2. 7 % to 8. 1 %) between the two study periods but no other differences in the distribution of case mix or characteristics of patients. The cost of the working party's recommended optimal pacing mode was calculated from multiplication of the mean cost of the recommended unit over {{the second half of the}} study period by the number of patients who would have received that unit. RESULTS [...] Between March 1990 and August 1991 atrial <b>pacing</b> <b>for</b> sinus node dysfunction (AAI, AAIR, DDD, or DDDR) increased by 138 % (from 25. 0 % to 59. 6 %), mainly because of increased use of AAI mode. Physiological <b>pacing</b> <b>for</b> atrioventricular block (DDD or VVIR) increased by 41 % (from 17. 0 % to 24. 0 %), and VVIR <b>pacing</b> <b>for</b> atrioventricular block with atrial fibrillation increased by 111 % (from 10. 5 % to 22. 2 %). After the internal audit (that is, between September 1991 and February 1993), physiological <b>pacing</b> <b>for</b> atrioventricular block increased by a further 126 % (from 24. 0 % to 54. 2 %). Sixty three per cent of this increase was in the first six months after the internal audit. Pacemaker prescriptions in sinus node dysfunction and atrioventricular block with atrial fibrillation were unchanged (59. 6 % physiological <b>pacing</b> <b>for</b> sinus node dysfunction and 22. 2 % v 27. 3 % VVIR <b>pacing</b> <b>for</b> atrioventricular block with atrial fibrillation). These changes in practice were accompanied by an increase in the age of patients receiving physiological units. Costs of pacemaker hardware for the final six months of the audit (excluding carotid sinus syndrome) increased by 38 % over the costs that would have accrued had pacing policy remained the same as for the initial six month period before the circulation of the recommendations of the working party. Adoption of the guidelines of the working party in full would lead to a further 66 % increase in the costs of hardware. CONCLUSIONS [...] The principal effect of the recommendations of the working party alone was increased use of AAI <b>pacing</b> <b>for</b> sinus node dysfunction, with little change in the costs of hardware. The internal audit was followed by an increase in physiological <b>pacing</b> <b>for</b> atrioventricular block, and this has had important financial consequences. Internal audit was followed by closer adherence to the recommendations of the working party...|$|R

40|$|This article reviews controversies in cardiac pacing in four areas: {{methods to}} prevent {{unnecessary}} right ventricular pacing and optimal ventricular pacing {{sites in the}} bradycardia population, <b>pacing</b> <b>for</b> prevention of atrial fibrillation (AF), a novel <b>pacing</b> technique <b>for</b> the treatment of heart failure, and <b>pacing</b> <b>for</b> the treatment of sleep apnea. Frequent right ventricular pacing {{has been reported to}} increase the incidence of AF and congestive heart failure. However, many patients with pacemakers for bradycardia have intrinsic atrioventricular conduction most of the time. Optimal programming of pacemakers and new algorithms designed to reduce unnecessary ventricular pacing are discussed. <b>Pacing</b> algorithms <b>for</b> prevention of AF have generally been shown to be ineffective. Atrial antitachycardia pacing has been shown to reduce the burden of atrial tachyarrhythmias in selected patients. Cardiac contractility modulation has recently been reported to be a promising new approach to the treatment of heart failure. Some pacing techniques may be effective in the treatment of sleep apnea but larger, long-term clinical trials are required to demonstrate a significant clinical benefit. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|This article reviews {{developments}} in four areas: single- versus dual-chamber <b>pacing,</b> <b>pacing</b> <b>for</b> prevention of atrial fibrillation (AF), <b>pacing</b> <b>for</b> {{the treatment of}} neuromediated syncope, and pacing in patients with congestive heart failure. Large, randomized clinical trials comparing physiologic and ventricular pacing in different pacemaker populations have demonstrated that physiologic pacing does prevent AF but does not reduce cardiac mortality or stroke. The benefit for prevention of AF {{appears to be in}} patients with sinus node disease as the primary indication <b>for</b> <b>pacing.</b> Selective atrial <b>pacing</b> algorithms designed <b>for</b> the prevention of AF have not been shown to substantially reduce the overall burden of AF. Cardiac pacing has been shown to have a moderate benefit in the treatment of neuromediated syncope. Cardiac resynchronization therapy is emerging as a promising new treatment for heart failure.
