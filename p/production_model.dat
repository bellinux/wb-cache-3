40|$|Production and {{distribution}} needs a proper place in heterodox economics. It {{has recently been}} suggested that the construction of <b>production</b> <b>models</b> needs to be empirically grounded. Also it has been stated that empirically grounded <b>production</b> <b>models</b> must be circular <b>production</b> <b>models.</b> This argument then marginalizes the contributions of important economists in heterodox thought. The paper will argue that heterodox <b>production</b> <b>models</b> need not be perfectly circular to make important contributions for heterodox production theory. Furthermore, it will be argued that models which consist of elements of hierarchial structures of production put emphasis on out of equilibrium traverse processes and historical time. ...|$|R

The suspension was designed {{in accordance with the}} FIA Group C specifications.|$|E
5|$|Production {{models in}} {{development}} have included convertibles, crossovers, and dedicated hybrids. Under the F marque, Lexus plans to produce high-performance vehicles with its first expressions being the IS F and the LFA. Lexus officials have also discussed standard <b>production</b> <b>model</b> usage of varying platforms. The LS uses a dedicated platform, while the entry-level Lexus ES had {{been criticized for}} being too similar to the Toyota Camry, with which it shared platforms until its sixth generation, in both styling and powertrain design. The NÃ¼rburgring test track in Germany has also seen Lexus prototype testing.|$|E
5|$|The P-6 variant was {{the last}} <b>production</b> <b>model</b> of the He 111 P series. In 1940, the Ministry of Aviation {{abandoned}} further production of the P series in favour of the H versions, mostly because the P-series' Daimler-Benz engines were needed for Messerschmitt Bf 109 and Bf 110 fighter production. The remaining P-6s were redesignated P-6/R2s and used as heavy glider tugs. The most notable difference with previous variants was the upgraded DB 601N powerplants.|$|E

5|$|The first (and only) <b>production</b> <b>model</b> (serial number S5, named Graywolf) was loaned to NCAR as a {{demonstration}} system in May 1993. NCAR's version was configured with 4 processors and a 128MWord (64-bit words, 1GB) common memory. In service, the static RAM proved to be problematic. It was also discovered that the square root code contained a bug that resulted in 1 in 60 million calculations being wrong. Additionally, {{one of the four}} CPUs was not running reliably.|$|E
5|$|The <b>production</b> <b>model</b> {{utilised}} {{the same}} Alcan bonded honeycomb aluminium structure vehicle technology (ASVT) as the concept {{car for the}} chassis.

5|$|Abir's rubber {{gathering}} practices made it {{the most}} notorious of all the concession companies for human rights abuses in the Congo Free State. Abir was only involved with primary resource gathering and, despite being owned by European industrialists, operated in a style similar to warlords such as Tippu Tip. Abir was supported in its operations by the Free State which required the enormous profits generated to strengthen its control over the country during its formative years. The concession companies gave the Free State the time and revenue required to secure the Congo and to plan a long-term and more stable program of colonisation. Abir ultimately failed as its harvesting process valued high production over sustainability and it doomed to live out its own boom and bust cycle. Despite this the Abir <b>production</b> <b>model</b> {{was used by the}} French government as the basis for its concession system in the French Congo.|$|E

5|$|An {{experimental}} fire-control {{director was}} fitted {{in the forward}} spotting top and evaluated in May 1910. This electrically provided data to the turrets via pointers, which the turret crew were to follow. The director layer fired the guns simultaneously which aided in spotting the shell splashes and minimised {{the effects of the}} roll on the dispersion of the shells. The director was subsequently removed, but Superb had a <b>production</b> <b>model</b> installed by May 1915 and both Temeraire and Bellerophon received theirs by May 1916. The latter's director, however, was not fully installed by the date of the Battle of Jutland {{at the end of the}} month and she fought without it. Furthermore, they were fitted with Mark I Dreyer Fire-control Tables by early 1916 in the transmission stations. It combined the functions of the Dumaresq and the range clock.|$|E
5|$|The I-5 and the I-6 were {{virtually}} identical in performance, although the I-6 took 15 seconds {{to complete a}} full circle versus the 9.5 seconds of the I-5. Both aircraft were armed with two 7.62mm (0.3in) PV-1 machine guns, but the <b>production</b> <b>model</b> of the I-5 {{was expected to be}} armed with four, although this proved to impose too great a penalty to the I-5's performance. The exact reasons for the selection of the I-5 over the I-6, which was debated for a full year, are not known, but likely relate to both of these factors. Curiously, Polikarpov was not informed of the selection of the I-5 until his release in 1933 after his initial sentence of death had been commuted to ten years of imprisonment in a labor camp.|$|E
5|$|The {{exterior}} {{retained the}} aluminium body panels of the XJ220 concept, {{but for the}} production vehicles, Abbey Panels of Coventry were contracted to provide the exterior panels. The scissor doors were dropped for the <b>production</b> <b>model,</b> and significant redesign work was carried out on the design when the wheelbase and overall length of the car was altered. Geoff Lawson, Design Director at Jaguar took a greater interest {{in the car and}} insisted the design had to be seen to be a Jaguar if it was to be successful in promoting the company. Keith Helfet returned to undertake the necessary redesign work mandated by the change in the wheelbase, which was reduced by 200mm.|$|E

5|$|Under HCI's Integrated Programme, the Sabbatical Programme {{is offered}} whereby {{students}} from Secondary 1 to 4 go on one week sabbatical courses in each {{term in the}} first semester (Terms 1 and 2). The programme is unique in allowing {{the majority of the}} school populace to put aside formal curricular lessons for a week in pursuit of their passions or interests. Sabbaticals offered are of a wide variety, in categories as defined by the school: Arts & Aesthetics, Chinese Studies, Humanities, English & Literature, Leadership, Technology, Science and Math, Camps and Student Exchange; they are essentially courses for students to opt for, such as beginner guitar and songwriting lessons, professional music <b>production,</b> <b>Model</b> United Nations training camps, football friendlies with other schools, et cetera. Also, the school requires students to use the specifically designed Online Bidding System - the i-ComP - to organise their sabbatical plans. Students who accumulate demerit points as a result of various offences are penalised in their sabbatical bidding or are recommended for corrective work order.|$|E
5|$|The third mass <b>production</b> <b>model</b> of the He 111H was the H-16, {{entering}} {{production in}} late 1942. Armament was {{as on the}} H-11, with some differences. The 20mm MG FF cannon was deleted, as the H-16s were seldom employed on low-level missions, was replaced with a single MG 131 in a flexible installation in the nose (A-Stand). On some aircraft, designated He 111H-16/R1, the dorsal position {{was replaced by a}} Drehlafette DL 131 electrically powered turret, armed with a single MG 131. The two beam and the aft ventral positions were provided with MG 81Zs, as on the H-11. The two 1,000kW (1,340hp) Jumo 211 F-2 provided a maximum speed of 434km/h (270mph) at 6,000m (19,690ft); cruising speed was 390km/h (242mph), service ceiling was 8,500m (27,900ft).FunkgerÃ¤t (FuG) radio equipment. FuG 10P, FuG 16, FuBl Z and APZ 6 were fitted for communication and navigation at night, while some aircraft received the FuG 101a radio altimeter. The H-16 retained its eight ESAC internal bomb cells; four bomb cells, as on previous versions could be replaced by a fuel tank to increase range. ETC 2000 racks could be installed over the bomb cell openings for external weapons carriage. Empty weight was 6,900kg (15,210lb) and the aircraft weighed 14,000kg (30,860lb) fully loaded for take off. German factories built 1,155 H-16s between the end of 1942 and the end of 1943; in addition, 280 H-6s and 35 H-11s were updated to H-16 standard. An undetermined number of H variants were fitted with the FuG 200 Hohentwiel. The radar was adapted as an anti-shipping detector for day or night operations.|$|E
5|$|This was {{addressed}} in the major <b>production</b> <b>model,</b> the Do 17 Z-2. The Z-2 mounted the new 323P-1 version of the Fafnir with 746kW (1,000hp), which was specifically tuned to the performance needs of the Do 17 by decreasing supercharger power at lower altitudes and thus improving low-level performance. The increase in takeoff power allowed the bomb load to be increased from 500kg (1,102lb) to 1,000kg (2,200lb). However the combat range with a full 1,000kg (2,200lb) bomb load was a very short 330km (200mi). The armament was further upgraded by adding another pair of guns firing out of {{the sides of the}} upper part of the pod, but as the three guns were all fired by a single gunner, only one of them could be fired at a time. From May 1940, 422 Do 17 Z-2s flew with Kampfgeschwader 2, Kampfgeschwader 3, Kampfgeschwader 76 and Kampfgeschwader 77. The upgrades of the Z-2 had its overall weight increased from 17,600lbs to 17,920lbs (7,983 to 8128kg). After heavy losses of Do 17s during the Battle of Britain it was decided to replace the MG FF cannon with the more powerful MG 151/15. Losses had mounted in spite of an increase of up to eight machine guns in some Dorniers. The standard MG 15 machine guns were retained. These features were present in the next variant the Z-3.|$|E
