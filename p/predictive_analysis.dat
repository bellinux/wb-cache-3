In the United States, in most law schools students must learn legal writing; the courses focus on: (1) <b>predictive</b> <b>analysis,</b> i.e., an outcome-predicting memorandum (positive or negative) {{of a given}} action for the attorney's client; and (2) persuasive analysis, e.g., motions and briefs. Although not as widely taught in law schools, legal drafting courses exist; other types of legal writing concentrate upon writing appeals or on interdisciplinary aspects of persuasion.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. <b>Predictive</b> runtime <b>analysis</b> {{has been}} {{proposed}} to improve the effectiveness of concurrent program analysis and testing. By observing one execution trace of the running system, <b>predictive</b> runtime <b>analysis</b> extracts a causality relation among runtime events, which is then used as an abstract model {{of the program and}} checked against desired properties. This way, one can predict concurrency errors without actually hitting them and without re-executing the program. The quality of the extracted causality relation directly determines the effectiveness of <b>predictive</b> runtime <b>analysis.</b> This paper presents an efficient and sound approach to compute sliced causality and sliced atomicity. These significantly improve upon existing causalities: irrelevant causal relationships are removed using an apriori static analysis process based on control and data dependence, and on property relevance and atomicity analysis. The algorithms presented in this paper have been implemented and extensively evaluated. The results show that the proposed technique is effective and sound: we found the previously known concurrency bugs as well as some unknown errors in popular systems, like the Tomcat webserver and the Apache FTP server, without any false alarms. ...|$|R

40|$|<b>Predictive</b> error {{variance}} <b>analysis</b> attempts {{to determine how}} wrong predictions made by a calibrated model may be. <b>Predictive</b> {{error variance}} <b>analysis</b> is usually undertaken following calibration using {{a small number of}} parameters defined through a priori parsimony. In contrast, we introduce a method for investigating the potential error in predictions made by highly parameterized models calibrated using regularized inversion. Vecchia and Cooley (1987) describe a method of <b>predictive</b> error variance <b>analysis</b> that is constrained by calibration data. We extend this approach to include constraints on parameters that lie within the calibration null space. These constraints are determined by dividing parameter space into combinations of parameters for which estimates can be obtained and those for which they cannot. This enables the contribution to predictive error variance from parameterization simplifications required to solve the inverse problem to be quantified, in addition to the contribution from measurement noise. We also describe a novel technique that restricts the analysis to a strategically defined predictive solution subspace, enabling an approximate <b>predictive</b> error variance <b>analysis</b> to be completed efficiently. The method is illustrated using a synthetic and a real-world groundwater flow and transport model...|$|R

Pooling the group Lovariance matrices invol-;es th 3 so-called "linear " rule, generally preferred in <b>predictive</b> and descriptive <b>analysis.</b> Retaining separate group covariance matrices invokes the "quadratic " rule, resulting in a higher hit rate in PDA and a lower lambda in DDA. However, the quadratic rule is influenced by unique sampling error variance, making the generalizability of quadratic results suspect. (Contains 12 references.)
