The party would further seek to reduce unemployment by limiting the proportion of migrant work imported from EU member states, as well as attempt to lower Council Tax by scrapping the fiscal implications of the union's Landfill Directive. Independence from Europe claims that by abandoning the EU, and thus the cost of membership, the UK's national debt can be cleared. Domestic budgetary policies include the raising of <b>personal</b> <b>allowance</b> to £15,000, broad simplification of both personal and corporate tax and opposition to zero-hours contracts. In addition, the party condones the forced collection of tax from evaders and the nationalisation of private finance initiatives (PFIs).|$|E
25|$|The <b>personal</b> <b>allowance</b> is a {{standard}} deduction from ordinary income, meaning that it is given in all income (wages, pensions, capital and business income). Single parents and married couples where one spouse has a low income may be taxed in Class 2 and thus given double <b>personal</b> <b>allowance.</b> In 2010, the <b>personal</b> <b>allowance</b> was NOK 42,210 in Class 1 and NOK 84,420 in Class 2.|$|E

25|$|Various {{changes were}} also {{made to the}} tax system which benefited workers on low and middle incomes. Married couples with low incomes benefited from the {{increases}} in the single <b>personal</b> <b>allowance</b> and marriage allowance. In 1965, the regressive allowance for national insurance contributions was abolished and the single <b>personal</b> <b>allowance,</b> marriage allowance and wife's earned income relief were increased. These allowances were further increased in the tax years 1969–70 and 1970–71. Increases in the age exemption and dependant relative's income limits benefited the low-income elderly. In 1967, new tax concessions were introduced for widows.|$|E

2500|$|At {{this time}} Osborne {{expressed}} an interest in the ideas of [...] "tax simplification" [...] (including the idea of flat tax). He set up a [...] "Tax Reform Commission" [...] in October 2005 to investigate ideas for how to create a [...] "flatter, simpler" [...] tax system. The system then proposed would reduce the income tax rate to a flat 22%, and increase the <b>personal</b> <b>allowance</b> from £4,435 to between £10,000 and £15,500.

2500|$|Abune Takla Haymanot {{presided over}} the church during a tumult filled period of Ethiopian history. [...] The Derg {{launched}} a vicious and bloody campaign against its opponents known as the Ethiopian Red Terror. [...] Countless of people from every political, social, economic and religious grouping, were imprisoned, tortured, or killed, and thousands fled {{the country as a}} hard line Communist and officially atheist regime imposed itself on the ancient empire. [...] Later during his tenure, Ethiopia would fall victim to the worst famine in its recorded history when millions are believed to have been affected directly. [...] During these hard times, church attendance exploded to all time highs, and unlike the other Communist countries of the world, actually grew during this period. [...] Although his legitimacy had been called into question, Abune Takla Haymanot through his personal devoutness and dignity, would become the most popular of all the men to have sat on the Patriarchal throne in Ethiopia. [...] Upon his enthronement, he had refused to don the black robes traditional to high-ranking hierarchs of the Orthodox churches. [...] Instead he adopted robes that were bright yellow, the color of the bahitawi hermits, and a color which in Ethiopian tradition symbolized penance and suffering. [...] Indeed, the Patriarch spent the entire 11 years of his reign in almost constant penance. [...] He prayed constantly, refused to eat anything but the simplest boiled and roasted grains and beans, slept on the bare floor and wore the thinnest of sandals, in an act of constant self-mortification. [...] Every penny of his <b>personal</b> <b>allowance</b> was spent on educating a group of famine orphans that he was personally raising in the Patriarchate itself. [...] Although never directly confronting the communist government for fear of increasing the persecution of his flock, Patriarch Abune Takla Haymanot preached to his people to be strong and to pray, joining them in this endeavor with all his heart. [...] Eventually, the Derg realized that instead of having a pliant, easily manipulated country bumpkin, they were dealing with a formidable, deeply conservative, rigid and uncompromising man {{at the head of the}} church. [...] He increasingly refused to accept incursions on his office by the government appointed administrator, and eventually had the man removed from office.|$|E
