40|$|To {{study the}} effects of {{different}} plant density on seed yield and yield components of three spring rapeseed cultivars a factorial experiment based on a Randomized Complete Block Design with three replications and 9 treatments was carried out during 2011 in Qazvin, Iran. Each plot consisted of 4 rows, 6 m long with 60 cm between rows. Seed were sown by hand (without pre planting irrigation) on February 2. Application of fertilizers, herbicides, pesticides and irrigation regime in this experiment were processed as they are usually done in the region. Three rapeseed cultivars Hayola 401 ، RGS 003 and Sarigol with three plant density levels (60, 80 and 100 plant/m 2) were studied. At the end of growing period, traits like silique <b>number</b> <b>per</b> plant, seed <b>number</b> <b>per</b> silique and 1000 seed weight, seed yield and seed oil percent were measured. The results showed that plant density and cultivars affected silique <b>number</b> <b>per</b> plant, seed <b>number</b> <b>per</b> silique, 1000 seed weight and seed yield significantly. The effects of plant density by interaction on silique <b>number</b> <b>per</b> plant, seed <b>number</b> <b>per</b> silique and seed yield were also significant. Hayola 401 produced the highest silique <b>number</b> <b>per</b> plant, seed <b>number</b> <b>per</b> silique, 1000 seed weight and seed yield.

The effects of habitat complexity and food item size were experimentally tested on the foraging parameters and functional responses of the freshwater fish roach Rutilus rutilus. Habitat complexity was varied through the manipulation of substrate and turbidity, and food item size was varied by using fishmeal pellets in two sizes. As water turbidity and substrate complexity increased, the reaction distance and consumption rate (<b>per</b> <b>number)</b> significantly decreased. Increased food item size significantly decreased consumption rates (<b>per</b> <b>number)</b> but had no influence on any other foraging parameter. Analysis of the interactions between substrate complexity, turbidity and food item size revealed food item size had the greatest influence on consumption rate (<b>per</b> <b>number).</b> Turbidity had the least effect on all the foraging parameters tested. Across all experiments, the functional responses were best described by the Type II response, a relatively consistent finding for R. rutilus.

An understanding of the interrelationships between important agronomic traits and yield of winter wheat could help to improve breeding results. The objectives of this paper were to examine correlations between several winter wheat traits and their direct and indirect effects on kernel yield. Research work was conducted during two growing seasons in East Croatia (2005 / 06 and 2006 / 07) on 11 winter wheat genotypes.
