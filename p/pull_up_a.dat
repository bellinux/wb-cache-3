25|$|Of {{this first}} edifice, the gables of the transept, a single portal, the tower {{up until the}} {{uppermost}} corbel table and some pillars are all that remain. As noted above, {{the eastern part of}} the church was rebuilt during the early 13th century. The transept was doubled in size, a new choir added to the east of it and in the angle between the choir and the transept, two towers constructed. During this construction period, a new southern portal, still Romanesque in style, was sculpted. After an interval of a few years, a new reconstruction scheme began. The nave was now enlarged to become as wide as the transept, in effect transforming the church from a basilica to a hall church. Again, the models can be traced to western Germany. The superfluous space between the ceiling and roof was turned into a very large attic. In the easternmost vault of the church, constituting the ceiling of the choir, a round hole exists. Scholars believe that this hole was used during enactments of the story of the Passion of Christ, to <b>pull</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> wooden statue of Christ in order to illustrate his very concrete ascent to heaven.|$|E

25|$|In the past, {{sometime}} after the GX era, Jaden Yuki is attacked by evil versions of stolen monster cards in Venice, Italy, including Stardust Dragon. As Paradox prepares to kill Jaden, Yusei and the Crimson Dragon arrive and protect him. Jaden was pursuing Paradox, who stole his friends' cards. Yusei explains to Jaden {{the situation and}} they decide to work together, Jaden pulls out a computer and uses the Manjome foundation's database to <b>pull</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> article which says Paradox killed Pegasus with Stardust and other famous dragons. Suddenly Jaden's Neos card disappears like Stardust Dragon did, and this era starts to vanish as well. Yusei and Jaden travel back even further in time {{to try to prevent}} Pegasus's death. Years earlier, Maximillion Pegasus is holding a duel in Domino City, which Yugi Muto is attending with his grandfather. Paradox uses his newly acquired monsters to attack the event, killing Pegasus, Yugi's grandfather and several bystanders, but Yugi survives. Yusei and Jaden arrive and take Yugi with them 30 minutes back in time before Paradox's attack in order to stop him, as Pegasus' premature death would drastically change the history and future of the world and Duel Monsters forever, with the hope of ending Duel Monsters permanently. Jaden notices his Neos is back and proclaims that right now all their cards are safe from being destroyed by any alteration already done to time.|$|E

2500|$|Data storage became better {{organized}} {{after the}} development of relational database software that allowed data to be stored in different tables. [...] For example, a theoretical airline may have numerous tables such as: airplanes, employees, maintenance contractors, caterers, flights, airports, payments, tickets, etc. each containing a narrower set of more specific information than would a flat file, such as a spreadsheet. [...] These tables are related by common data fields called keys. (See: Relational model) Data can be retrieved in various specific configurations by posing a query without having to <b>pull</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> whole table. [...] This, for example, {{makes it easy to}} find a passenger's seat assignment by a variety of means such as ticket number or name, and provide only the queried information. [...] See: SQL ...|$|E
2500|$|The hand often blesses rulers from above, {{especially}} in Carolingian and Ottonian works, and coins. The hand may hold a wreath or crown over the ruler's head, or {{place it on}} the head. A posthumous coin of Constantine the Great (the [...] "deification issue") had shown the hand reaching down to <b>pull</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> veiled figure of Constantine in a quadriga, in a famously mixed message that combined pagan conventions, where an eagle drew deified emperors up to the heavens, with Christian iconography. From the late 4th century coins of Late Antique rulers such as Arcadius (and his empress), Galla Placidia and others show them being crowned by it – it was in fact mostly used for empresses, and often only appears on issues from the Eastern Empire. This theme is not then seen in Byzantine art until the late 10th century, when it appears in coins of John I Tzimisces (969–976), long after it was common in the West. In later Byzantine miniatures figures the hand is often replaced by a full figure of Christ (in these examples much smaller than the Emperor) placing a crown on the head.|$|E
