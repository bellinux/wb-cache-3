5|$|David Prentice, {{artist and}} one of the founder members of Birmingham's Ikon Gallery, has lived and worked in Malvern since 1990. He started <b>painting</b> <b>the</b> Malvern Hills when he retired in 1983.|$|E
5|$|Eakins {{made several}} on-site oil {{sketches}} and photographic studies before <b>painting</b> <b>The</b> Swimming Hole. It is unknown whether the photographs were taken before the oil sketches were produced {{or vice versa}} (or, indeed, whether they were created on the same day).|$|E
5|$|In antiquity, many {{infants with}} disabilities were either killed or abandoned. A number of {{historical}} pieces of art {{are believed to}} portray Down syndrome, including pottery from AD 500 from South America and the 16th-century <b>painting</b> <b>The</b> Adoration of the Christ Child.|$|E
50|$|Important {{painters}} given a sobriquet {{based on}} a name vase include for example <b>the</b> <b>Painter</b> of Berlin A 34, <b>the</b> Nessos <b>Painter,</b> <b>the</b> Andokides <b>Painter,</b> <b>the</b> Antimenes <b>Painter,</b> <b>the</b> Antiphon <b>Painter,</b> <b>the</b> Berlin <b>Painter,</b> <b>the</b> Bryn Mawr <b>Painter</b> and <b>the</b> Pistoxenos <b>Painter.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> Phiale <b>Painter</b> became <b>the</b> Achilles Painter's most {{prominent}} student after he assumed the Berlin Painter's workshop. Almost {{a dozen other}} recognizable painters passed through the Achilles Painter's workshop as well. Notable painters include <b>the</b> Westreenen <b>Painter,</b> <b>the</b> Persephone <b>Painter,</b> <b>the</b> Clio <b>Painter,</b> Loeb <b>Painter,</b> and <b>the</b> Dwarf <b>Painter.</b> <b>The</b> Kleophon <b>Painter,</b> <b>the</b> Sabouroff <b>Painter,</b> and <b>the</b> <b>Painter</b> of Munich 2335 all spent time at the workshop as well.|$|R
50|$|Several vase {{painters}} had specialised in <b>painting</b> Siana cups. <b>The</b> {{most important}} {{among them was}} <b>the</b> C <b>Painter.</b> Others include <b>the</b> <b>Painter</b> of Athens 553, <b>the</b> Heidelberg <b>Painter,</b> <b>the</b> <b>Painter</b> of Boston CA, <b>the</b> Kassandra <b>Painter,</b> <b>the</b> Sandal <b>Painter,</b> <b>the</b> Civico <b>Painter</b> and <b>the</b> Griffin-Bird <b>Painter.</b> At present, about 1,000 cups and fragments are known; a classification vital for their chronology and stylistic categorisation has been developed by Herman Brijder. A special type are so called Merrythought Cups, with a forked handle.|$|R
5|$|Paddington {{station was}} the subject of William Powell Frith's 1862 <b>painting</b> <b>The</b> Railway Station. The {{portrait}} was viewed by over 21,000 people (paying a shilling each) in the first seven weeks of it being publicly shown. The painting is now held in the Royal Holloway College.|$|E
5|$|The Quarrymen—John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Ken Brown—went to {{the club}} to arrange their first booking, to which Mona agreed, but said she needed to finish <b>painting</b> <b>the</b> club first. All four took up brushes and helped Mona to finish <b>painting</b> <b>the</b> walls with spiders, dragons, rainbows and stars. In {{addition}} to the four boys' artistic contributions, Cynthia Powell, later to become Cynthia Lennon, painted a silhouette of John on the wall, which can still be seen today. The group often played at The Casbah as other venues, like The Cavern Club, had a jazz-only policy at that time. The cellar—with its original decoration—still exists.|$|E
5|$|The {{distorted}} {{perspectives of}} anamorphosis have been explored in art since the sixteenth century, when Hans Holbein the Younger incorporated a severely distorted skull in his 1553 <b>painting</b> <b>The</b> Ambassadors. Many artists since then, including Escher, have {{make use of}} anamorphic tricks.|$|E
50|$|Unfortunately, none of {{the names}} of the artists have survived, so modern {{scholars}} have been obliged to give the recognizable artistic hands and workshops nicknames based on the subject matter of their works, museums which possess the works, or individuals who have distinguished the works from others. Some of the most famous of the Apulian vase painters at Taras are now called: <b>the</b> Iliupersis <b>Painter,</b> <b>the</b> Lycurgus <b>Painter,</b> <b>the</b> Gioia del Colle <b>Painter,</b> <b>the</b> Darius <b>Painter,</b> <b>the</b> Underworld <b>Painter,</b> and <b>the</b> White Sakkos <b>Painter,</b> among others.|$|R

50|$|The {{earliest}} {{representatives of}} the style worked in the workshop of the potter Myson between 480 and 450 BC. The most important artist of the style {{at that time was}} <b>the</b> Pan <b>Painter.</b> Also significant were <b>the</b> Pig <b>Painter,</b> <b>the</b> Leningrad <b>Painter</b> and <b>the</b> Agrigento <b>Painter.</b> <b>The</b> middle phase, between about 450 and 425 BC, is dominated by the Nausikaa-Hephaistos Group, comprising seven artists. Its leading and eponymous artists were <b>the</b> Nausikaa <b>Painter</b> and <b>the</b> Hephaistos <b>Painter.</b> <b>The</b> last important artists of the style, {{near the end of the}} 5th century, are <b>the</b> Academy <b>Painter</b> and <b>the</b> <b>Painter</b> of Athens 1183.|$|R
5|$|The {{exploits}} of the Brunswickers caught the British Victorian public's imagination: {{an example of}} this can be found in John Everett Millais's <b>painting</b> <b>The</b> Black Brunswicker. Completed in 1860, the painting depicts a Brunswicker in his black uniform bidding goodbye to an unnamed woman.|$|E
5|$|The oil <b>painting</b> <b>The</b> Carlile Family with Sir Justinian Isham in Richmond Park is held at Lamport Hall in Northamptonshire. It {{was painted}} by Joan Carlile (1600–1679) {{who lived at}} Petersham Lodge.|$|E
5|$|To restore sympathetically {{those areas}} where {{deterioration}} {{of one sort or}} another had obliterated details and caused loss of integrity to the whole, for example, filling a bad crack and <b>painting</b> <b>the</b> plaster in a colour matching the original.|$|E
50|$|Inside the church, Ferdinando Porta <b>painted</b> <b>the</b> St Joseph in Agonyand Pietro Maggi <b>painted</b> <b>the</b> Assumption of the Virgin in the choir.|$|R
50|$|In 1997, Wonnacott <b>painted</b> <b>the</b> British prime {{minister}} John Major. In 2000, he <b>painted</b> <b>the</b> British Royal Family in a 12-foot tall artwork.|$|R
5000|$|In 1985, Americo, Eva and A.B. <b>painted</b> <b>the</b> {{first in}} a series of large {{collaborative}} paintings, at 5 feet by 8 feet, combining the styles of all three painters, called [...] "Trilogy", a view of Central Park. The next collaborative work [...] "Spirit of Paris" [...] was unveiled at a private reception at Lawrence Ross Galleries in Beverly Hills in January 1986. Americo <b>painted</b> <b>the</b> right most one-third of <b>the</b> <b>painting,</b> while Eva <b>painted</b> <b>the</b> center third and A.B. <b>painted</b> <b>the</b> left most one-third of <b>the</b> <b>painting.</b> Each artist signed below the area of their work.|$|R
5|$|A fierce sky {{caught in}} the {{dichotomy}} between the setting sun and the crescent moon dominates {{more than a third}} of the <b>painting.</b> <b>The</b> rain-heavy clouds swirling ominously around each celestial entity are separated by a gulf of calmness, intensifying the contrast and infusing the heavens with an unearthly glow. Light from the sky spills onto the landscape: while the western continent and the Nile are bathed in the sun's light, the east and the Tower of Babel are cloaked in shadow.|$|E
5|$|A {{trail of}} {{peculiar}} footprints shows the path trodden {{by the woman}} on her pattens to avoid putting her good shoes {{in the snow and}} filth of the street. A small object hangs at her side, interpreted variously as a nutcracker or a pair of scissors {{in the form of a}} skeleton or a miniature portrait, hinting, perhaps, at a romantic disappointment. Although clearly a portrait in the <b>painting,</b> <b>the</b> object is indistinct in the prints from the engraving. Other parts of the scene are clearer in the print, however: in the background, a quack is selling his cureall medicine, and while in the <b>painting</b> <b>the</b> advertising board is little more than a transparent outline, in the print, Dr. Rock's name can be discerned inscribed on the board below the royal crest which suggests his medicine is produced by royal appointment. The salesman may be Rock himself. Hogarth's opinion of Rock is made clear in the penultimate plate of A Harlot's Progress where he is seen arguing over treatments with Dr Misaubin while Moll Hackabout dies unattended in the corner.|$|E
5|$|During {{this period}} Van Gogh {{mastered}} {{the use of}} light by subjugating shadows and <b>painting</b> <b>the</b> trees {{as if they are}} the source of light – almost in a sacred manner. Early the following year he painted another smaller group of orchards, including View of Arles, Flowering Orchards. Van Gogh was enthralled by the landscape and vegetation of the south of France, and often visited the farm gardens near Arles. In the vivid light of the Mediterranean climate his palette significantly brightened.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>painting</b> was {{probably}} commissioned by {{an important and}} wealthy patron; Gentileschi <b>painted</b> <b>the</b> blue sheets on <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> using two layers of lapis lazuli, an expensive material for artists to obtain. It is possible that a second artist was commissioned to <b>paint</b> <b>the</b> landscape at the top left of <b>the</b> <b>painting.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{process of}} {{restoring}} <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> began <b>the</b> same day. Following consultations with chemists, art restorers began washing {{the surface of}} <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> with water; they kept <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> in <b>the</b> vertical position, and sprayed water at <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> to prevent further degradation of <b>the</b> <b>painting.</b>|$|R
50|$|He was facile both {{in history}} and {{portrait}} paintings. Among his first works was a Marius besieged by the Cimbri. In 1822, he <b>painted</b> <b>the</b> Oath of the Horatii. In 1835, he <b>painted</b> <b>the</b> doomed Doge Marino Faliero. In 1836, Cain, Madonna Lia, and Torquato Tasso a SantAnna. In 1841, he <b>painted</b> <b>the</b> Death of Marco Botzaris.|$|R
5|$|Ghosh {{chose the}} guest {{house in which}} the protagonist stays after noticing it {{during his visit to}} a {{neighbouring}} hotel in April 2010. He booked it for 10 days for , and requested the guest-house employees to keep the shooting schedule a secret. Choosing a room with windows overlooking a busy road, he proceeded to give it an old-fashioned look by replacing the windows' designer grilles with old-fashioned wooden ones, and by <b>painting</b> <b>the</b> room with some rough patches.|$|E
5|$|Heidi Schultz of Schultz Art & Design {{served as}} the project's {{production}} manager. She created a pattern against the wall using Lawrence's digital design, then mixed the paint, completed the mural, and added a clear coating for protection. <b>Painting</b> <b>the</b> mural took about six weeks, and it was mostly finished by November 2013. Red Fox Vintage hosted a party to celebrate the work's completion on December 14. The mural took nearly two years to plan and complete, which was longer than expected.|$|E
5|$|However, {{shortly after}} {{returning}} to the French Riviera in 1929, Hunter suffered a severe breakdown, forcing his sister to bring him home to Scotland in September. He recovered, and began to paint a number of portraits of his friends, including one of Dr Tom Honeyman, the Director of the Glasgow Art Gallery and Museum from 1939 until 1954. Honeyman, at the time an art dealer, had assisted Hunter in developing his career, and <b>painting</b> <b>the</b> portrait {{may have been a}} gesture of thanks.|$|E
50|$|Solvent <b>paint</b> {{strippers}} penetrate <b>the</b> {{layers of}} <b>paint</b> and break <b>the</b> bond between <b>the</b> <b>paint</b> and <b>the</b> object by swelling <b>the</b> <b>paint.</b>|$|R
50|$|Regular Klaatu artist Ted Jones - {{who had not}} <b>painted</b> <b>the</b> {{cover for}} the group's {{previous}} album, Sir Army Suit - returned to <b>paint</b> <b>the</b> album cover.|$|R
50|$|In 1956, Heinz Kisters, a German {{businessman}} {{living in}} Switzerland, acquired <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> from <b>the</b> New York art dealers who had purchased <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> at <b>the</b> Christie's auction. When {{he died in}} 1977, <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> became <b>the</b> property of his widow, Gerlinda Kisters.|$|R
5|$|In 1850 {{he gave up}} {{his career}} in science and entered the Imperial Academy of Arts in Saint Petersburg. He studied in academy under the {{historical}} painter Pyotr Basin until 1857. He graduated from the academy in 1857 with a gold medal for his <b>painting</b> <b>The</b> Witch of Endor Calling Up the Spirit of the Prophet Samuel. According to Ge himself, during that period he was strongly influenced by Karl Briullov.|$|E
5|$|In 1889, Miloš's {{descendant}} King Alexander visited Jovanović at his Vienna {{studio and}} requested {{a painting of}} the revolt to commemorate its 75th anniversary. With his rise in stature, the artist had found himself producing numerous replicas of his earlier Orientalist works. According to biographer Nikola Kusovac, Jovanović grew bored with painting replicas and considered taking up a different genre. Alexander's request presented Jovanović {{with an opportunity to}} deviate from Orientalism and try his hand at history <b>painting.</b> <b>The</b> Takovo Uprising was his first historical composition.|$|E
5|$|In 1945 Moore {{accompanied}} the British 11th Armoured Division when they liberated the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in Germany. He {{spent three days}} sketching and <b>painting</b> <b>the</b> state of the camp, its prisoners and their captors, including Fritz Klein. It was suggested by one soldier that nobody would believe the portrayals, prompting Moore to also photograph the scenes as proof.|$|E
5000|$|He {{sometimes}} {{tries to}} explain: [...] "I <b>paint</b> <b>the</b> light. Not the physical light, a light that casts shadows. I <b>paint</b> <b>the</b> {{light in the}} shade. [...] " ...|$|R
5000|$|The Douthitt {{tapestry}} showroom at 286 Fifth Avenue {{was once}} one of the attractions for art lovers visiting New York. Work was collaborative, as described by a visitor in 1891: [...] "he employs one to <b>paint</b> <b>the</b> heads of cupids, or figures, another to <b>paint</b> <b>the</b> bodies, another to <b>paint</b> <b>the</b> drapery, and still another to <b>paint</b> <b>the</b> backgrounds, or cloud effects, and in this way, by combining the best work of a number of artists, he can produce works of art that are unapproachable in their perfection".|$|R
25|$|Celebrities {{contributed to}} the theater's decor. Xavier Cugat <b>painted</b> <b>the</b> trees and foliage between the pillars on the side walls. Keye Luke <b>painted</b> <b>the</b> Chinese murals in the lobby.|$|R
