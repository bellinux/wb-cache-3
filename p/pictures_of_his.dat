Discussing the photograph, Mulder tells Scully about Ted Serios, who was famous for making photos which showed what was in his mind. He takes <b>pictures</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> gloved hand using a camera found in Lefante's apartment, and they all appear {{the same as the}} one from the pharmacy. Mulder deduces that the kidnapper has been stalking his victims.|$|E
5|$|Still {{photographer}} Bhaskar takes <b>pictures</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> lover with a motorbike in the background.

Reading about the murder in a newspaper, Bhaskar shows Raghunath the pictures with the murderer's motorbike in the background. Raghunath investigates and learns that the owner has lent it to his friend.|$|E

5|$|For {{the scenery}} design, layout {{supervisor}} Rasoul Azadani took many <b>pictures</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> hometown of Isfahan, Iran for guidance. Other inspirations for design were Disney's animated films from the 1940s and 50s and the 1940 film The Thief of Bagdad. The coloring {{was done with}} the computerized CAPS process, and the color motifs were chosen according to the personality – the protagonists use light colors such as blue, the antagonists darker ones such as red and black, and Agrabah and its palace use the neutral color yellow. Computer animation was used for some elements of the film, such as the tiger entrance of the Cave of Wonders and the scene where Aladdin tries to escape the collapsing cave.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{information}} available on the allegations was released (officially or unofficially) by the prosecution and unchallenged by Jackson. Jackson was largely portrayed as guilty by the media. The media bias {{was evident in the}} use of sensational headlines to draw in readers and viewers when the content itself did not support the headline, the purchasing of stories of his alleged criminal activity, the purchasing of confidential leaked material from the police investigation, deliberately using <b>pictures</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> appearance at its worst, using headlines that strongly implied his guilt, and a general lack of objectivity.|$|E
5|$|On June 16, 2016, {{under the}} {{direction}} of Dr. Langer and Legion Group Arts, young Italian researcher Giovanni Rapazzini de Buzzaccarini discovered a long-lost early work by Brooks at the Vittoriale in Gardone. Brooks had copied (Pietro di Cristoforo Vannucci 1450-1523) Perugino's Portrait of a Young Man at the Uffizi when she was a penniless art student in Rome. She painted the man because she thought he resembled herself as a girl. She later gave the painting to D'Annunzio as a joke when she refused to become his lover. D'Annunzio was in the tasteless habit—Romaine thought—of hanging <b>pictures</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> mistresses in a rogue's gallery. Buzzaccarini found this painting in the music room.|$|E

5|$|At the wedding, Kelly Kapoor (Mindy Kaling) {{arrives with}} her husband Ravi (Sendhil Ramamurthy), where Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak) surprises them with a baby, his son Drake, that he had with a former girlfriend who then {{abandoned}} them both. Jim tells Dwight that under Schrute tradition, he {{is not allowed to}} be best man as he is younger than him. Jim surprises him with the arrival of Michael Scott (Steve Carell). The wedding proceeds in Schrute tradition with Michael as Dwight's new best man. At the reception, Michael shows Pam <b>pictures</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> kids with Holly Flax, and Pam notes that he is paying for two phones just to hold all the images. Ryan deliberately gives Drake an allergic reaction so that Ravi, a pediatrician, can attend and Ryan can steal Kelly away. Kevin tells Ravi that Ryan wanted him to keep Drake so that Ryan can have Kelly and the two can start a new life together. Ravi then gives Kevin the baby to give to Child Services before leaving, but Nellie, who has still been wanting a child, takes Drake instead.|$|E

25|$|Artists, {{cultural}} authorities, {{government officials}} and the Iranian people gathered {{to say goodbye to}} Kiarostami on 10 July, in an emotional funeral, six days after his death in France.

On 10 July 1613, he was paid £13.6s.8d. by the vice-chancellor of the University of Cambridge, [...] "in full satisfaction for Prince Charles his picture", for a full-length portrait which is still in the Cambridge University Library.|$|E
500|$|In 1989, {{the case}} of Tsutomu Miyazaki, [...] "The Otaku Murderer", brought the fandom, very negatively, to {{national}} attention. Miyazaki, who randomly chose and murdered four girls, had a collection of 5,763 video tapes, some containing anime and slasher films that were found interspersed with videos and <b>pictures</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> victims. Later that year, the contemporary knowledge magazine Bessatsu Takarajima dedicated its 104th issue {{to the topic of}} otaku. It was called [...] and delved into the subculture of otaku with 19 articles by otaku insiders, among them Akio Nakamori. This publication has been claimed by scholar Rudyard Pesimo to have popularized the term.|$|E

500|$|Meanwhile, Olivia's sister Rachel (Ari Graynor) and niece Ella (Lily Pilblad) come to visit.

She goes to search his house but accidentally runs into his wife and accomplice, Samantha (Trini Alvarado). Loeb tells his wife to kill Olivia, and after a struggle, Olivia fatally shoots Samantha. Olivia obtains the necessary evidence to capture Loeb and questions him about her abduction. She gets little information until she shows him <b>pictures</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> dead wife, as he was unaware she was killed. Loeb angrily tells Olivia about [...] "two sides" [...] and {{that he was trying to}} save her.|$|E
500|$|While the New York Native was {{printing}} several {{stories about}} the [...] "gay cancer" [...] beginning to make its way round the city, with detailed medical writing by Lawrence D. Mass, a gay physician and psychiatrist, the San Francisco gay press largely ignored the nascent epidemic. Campbell's interest in educational outreach and professional interest in gay sexual health combined to inspire him to raise awareness himself. As a result, in October 1981, the same month he was diagnosed, Campbell put <b>pictures</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> KS lesions {{in the window of}} the Star Pharmacy at 498 Castro Street, urging men with similar lesions to seek medical attention. In doing so, he created and displayed San Francisco's first AIDS poster.|$|E
