5|$|On 18 March 1994, six prisoners {{appeared}} in court {{on charges of}} escaping from custody during the second riot trial. Five of them <b>pleaded</b> <b>guilty</b> to escaping from custody on one occasion, and Mark Azzopardi <b>pleaded</b> <b>guilty</b> to escaping on two occasions. Each was sentenced to eighteen months imprisonment for escaping from Manchester Crown Court, and Azzopardi received an additional two-year sentence for escaping from the van transporting him from HM Prison Hull to the court. In July 1994, David Bowen was convicted of attempting to pervert the course of justice by attempting to influence {{the jury in the}} first riot trial, and was sentenced to three years imprisonment. Paul Taylor, who had already <b>pleaded</b> <b>guilty</b> to the same charge, also received a three-year sentence.|$|E

5|$|Wood {{pleaded not}} guilty to the murder of Danielle and instead entered a {{manslaughter}} plea {{on the grounds that they}} had agreed to a suicide pact. The prosecution did not accept the manslaughter plea and pursued a trial for the murder of Danielle. However, Wood <b>pleaded</b> <b>guilty</b> to the murder of Stephanie and the attempted murder of Christopher. He also <b>pleaded</b> <b>guilty</b> to stealing £84,000 from clients.|$|E

50|$|About 99% {{of people}} prosecuted under Operation Streamline <b>plead</b> <b>guilty.</b> According to the Washington Post, {{this is because}} those who <b>plead</b> <b>guilty</b> are likely to get {{substantially}} shorter prison terms than the theoretical maximum, whereas {{those who do not}} <b>plead</b> <b>guilty</b> are likely to get close to the maximum sentence.|$|R
50|$|In charge bargaining, {{defendants}} <b>plead</b> <b>guilty</b> to a {{less serious}} crime than the original charge. In count bargaining, they <b>plead</b> <b>guilty</b> to a subset of multiple original charges. In sentence bargaining, they <b>plead</b> <b>guilty</b> agreeing in advance what sentence will be given; however, this sentence can still be denied by the judge. In fact bargaining, defendants <b>plead</b> <b>guilty</b> but the prosecutor agrees to stipulate (i.e., to affirm or concede) certain facts that will affect how the defendant is punished under the sentencing guidelines.|$|R
5|$|Fastow and his wife, Lea, both <b>pleaded</b> <b>guilty</b> {{to charges}} against them. Fastow was {{initially}} charged with 98 counts of fraud, money laundering, insider trading, and conspiracy, among other crimes. Fastow <b>pleaded</b> <b>guilty</b> to two charges of conspiracy {{and was sentenced}} to ten years with no parole in a plea bargain to testify against Lay, Skilling, and Causey. Lea was indicted on six felony counts, but prosecutors later dismissed them in favor of a single misdemeanor tax charge. Lea was sentenced to one year for helping her husband hide income from the government.|$|E
5|$|Matthew Grant Webster, an 18-year-old {{who acted}} as a bouncer at the event, <b>pleaded</b> <b>guilty</b> to her murder {{and was sentenced to}} 20 years in prison with a 14-year non-parole period. He was {{released}} on parole in June 2004, after serving 14½ years. Guy Charles Wilson, the other bouncer and only other person aged over 18 at the party, <b>pleaded</b> <b>guilty</b> to assault; a third male (aged 15) <b>pleaded</b> <b>guilty</b> to having sex with a minor. The investigation of Leigh's murder proved controversial, however, as several people who admitted to various crimes, including assaulting Leigh, were never charged; nor was anyone ever charged with her sexual assault. Webster's confession did not match the forensic evidence. The murder investigation was reviewed by the New South Wales Crime Commission in 1996, and by the Police Integrity Commission in 1998, with the latter recommending the dismissal of the detective in charge of the investigation.|$|E
5|$|A copy of {{the film}} leaked onto {{peer-to-peer}} file sharing networks just hours after opening in theaters. The film was a time-stamped workprint, suggesting it {{may have come from}} within the industry rather than from someone who videotaped an advance screening. Eight people were later charged with copyright infringement and distributing material illegally. Documents filed by the Los Angeles District Attorney allege that a {{copy of the}} film was taken from an unnamed Californian post-production office by an employee, who later <b>pleaded</b> <b>guilty</b> to his charges. The illegal copy was passed among seven people until reaching an eighth party, who also <b>pleaded</b> <b>guilty</b> to uploading to an unnamed P2P network.|$|E
50|$|To {{satisfy the}} {{prejudice}} prong of Strickland, a defendant who <b>pleads</b> <b>guilty</b> must show that, but for counsel's deficient performance, {{he or she}} would not have <b>plead</b> <b>guilty.</b> In Padilla v. Kentucky (2010), the Court held that counsel's failure to inform an alien <b>pleading</b> <b>guilty</b> of the risk of deportation fell below the objective standard of the performance prong of Strickland and permitted an alien who would not have <b>plead</b> <b>guilty</b> but for such failure to withdraw his guilty plea.|$|R
5|$|To {{satisfy the}} {{prejudice}} prong of Strickland, a defendant who <b>pleads</b> <b>guilty</b> must {{show that there}} is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's deficient performance, he or she would not have <b>plead</b> <b>guilty.</b> In Padilla v. Kentucky (2010), the Court held that counsel's failure to inform an alien <b>pleading</b> <b>guilty</b> of the risk of deportation fell below the objective standard of the performance prong of Strickland and permitted an alien who would not have <b>plead</b> <b>guilty</b> but for such failure to withdraw his guilty plea.|$|R

Judge Breen sentenced Cowart to 14 years in prison on October 22, 2010. The U.S. Justice Department said that Cowart could have been sentenced to a maximum 75 years, and Cowart was originally to be sentenced on August 13.|$|E

5000|$|However, in an {{interview}} she gave in March 2005 to the Banja Luka Alternativna Television, she admitted she had <b>plead</b> <b>guilty</b> because she couldn't prove her innocence, as {{she was unable to}} find witnesses who would testify on her behalf. She repeated this in {{an interview}} for Swedish Vi magazine in January 2009. She claimed to have <b>plead</b> <b>guilty</b> {{in order to avoid the}} remaining charges against her, including genocide. Her <b>pleading</b> <b>guilty</b> led the Hague tribunal to lower her sentence and drop the remaining charges. [...] Plavšić would have likely have been sentenced to 20-25 years in prison if she had not <b>plead</b> <b>guilty</b> and all eight charges were taken into account.|$|R

50|$|Prosecutors {{should never}} {{go ahead with}} more charges than are {{necessary}} just to encourage a defendant to <b>plead</b> <b>guilty</b> to a few.

40|$|Undoubtedly most {{defendants}} who <b>plead</b> <b>guilty</b> (1) {{know the}} facts determining their criminal liability; and (2) are sincere when they confess their guilt in a guilty plea. In the balance of this column, though, we demonstrate that (1) some defendants <b>pleading</b> <b>guilty</b> lack such knowledge and sincerity and (2) we need critically to examine our assumptions about the knowledge and sincerity of defendants <b>pleading</b> <b>guilty.</b> Once we understand the knowledge and sincerity risks posed during guilty pleas, we can see how Brady disclosure in the guilty plea context would help reduce those risk...|$|R
