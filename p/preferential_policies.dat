25|$|In April 2016 the Traffic Management Bureau {{under the}} Ministry of Public Security {{announced}} {{the introduction of}} new green license plates to identify new energy vehicles, as opposed to the country's standard blue plates. The NEV plates include a Chinese character short for the provincial region where they are issued, and seven numbers and letters, compared to six on standard plates. The objective of the special plates is to facilitate police enforcement of the <b>preferential</b> <b>policies</b> that some local authorities apply to cleaner cars to help cut emissions and ease traffic. For example, central Beijing has in place a road space rationing scheme, a driving restriction regulation that bans conventional vehicles from entering the city for one day a week, but new energy vehicles are exempted from the restriction. Beijing also introduced a vehicle quota system in 2011, awarding new car licenses through a lottery, with a ceiling of 6 million units for 2017. New energy vehicles were placed in a special category where the odds of winning a license plate are much higher than conventional autos.|$|E

40|$|The CARIFORUM EPA {{initialled}} in December 2007 regulates several behind-the-border areas, including public procurement. The {{provisions of}} the agreement recognise that transparent competitive tendering is important for economic development and the special economic situation of the CARIFORUM countries. While these special circumstances are not defined, the text points to the CARIFORUM members' entitlement to Special and Differential Treatment (S&D). These dual objectives present particular reform challenges for government purchasing {{because it is a}} fertile environment for vested political, industrial and bureaucratic interests; all essential - but instinctively hostile - to reform. Thus, reform of public purchasing, either internally or externally, is difficult. Yet, state activities in developing countries tend to cover sectors as wide as education, commerce, health, infrastructure and defence. The price and quality of state purchases significantly effect economic development and social welfare. This assessment of the public procurement provisions in the CARIFORUM EPA is therefore based on the conviction that <b>preferential</b> procurement <b>policies</b> are only justifiable if: (i) they effectively meet explicit and sustainable development policies; (ii) the benefits of the <b>preferential</b> <b>policy</b> outweigh its costs; (iii) there is no reasonably available alternative measure with lower social costs; and (iv) that the <b>preferential</b> <b>policy</b> is implemented no longer than necessary to attain the development goals. As such, this analysis is more concerned with the need to create ‘policy lock-in' rather than ‘policy space'...|$|R

In the two following Parts, the methodological and theoretical background to the construction of quantitative trade models is developed. Part I I surveys the 11 theory of customs unions 11 • Economic rationale for the adop­ tion of <b>preferential</b> trade <b>policies</b> are sought for, under alternative frameworks characterized by different market imperfections. Part I I I surveys available methodologies that quantify the trade and welfare effects of <b>preferential</b> trade <b>policy</b> under two different headings: "residual" methods and "analytical" models of trade. The conclusions are based upon the results obtained with: - a gravity model, describing the geographical pattern of manufactured exports and imports, between 1971 and 1982. and a time-series model of demand functions, specified in a three-stage framework for the period 1961 / 80. The quantitative analysis yielded substantial export gains, with strong concentration 	on a few commodity groups. This pattern is very simi lar to that arising from EFTA membership, in the sixties., which suggests poor ability to diversify exports. On the import side, the Free Trade Agree· ment with the EEC produced significant trade reversion away from EFTA sources. However, the expected outcome of <b>preferential</b> <b>policy</b> was frus­ trated by the simultaneous adoption of non-tariff barriers, with a net trade eroding effect.

We study an economy with private and public sectors in which workers invest in imperfectly observable skills {{that are important to}} the private sector but not to the public sector. A law allows native majority workers to be employed in the public sector with positive probability while excluding the minority from it. We show that even when the public sector offers the highest wage rate, it is still possible that the discriminated group is, on average, economically more successful. The reason is that the <b>preferential</b> <b>policy</b> lowers the majority’s incentive to invest in imperfectly observable skills by exacerbating the informational free riding problem in the private sector labor market...|$|R
30|$|The primary {{impediment}} {{to the development}} of renewable energy is the absence of sufficient policies and regulations. Though the Renewable Energy Law has been implemented, from a general view, the procedural law is not detailed and lacks some incentives such as fiscal interest discount <b>policy,</b> <b>preferential</b> tax <b>policy</b> and R&D policy. This is for two main reasons. One is the absence of some corresponding mechanism for the policies, such as incomplete policy to support the development of solar energy, wind energy and biomass energy. The other is the poor coordination of management at all levels, which causes decentralization of funds and redundant construction, so the macro-control ability has been always weak.|$|R
