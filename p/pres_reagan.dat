5000|$|The Moscow Summit was {{a summit}} meeting between U.S. <b>Pres.</b> Ronald <b>Reagan</b> and General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union Mikhail Gorbachev. It {{was held on}} May 29, 1988 - June 3, 1988. Reagan and Gorbachev {{finalized}} the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF) after the U.S. Senate's ratification of the treaty in May 1988. Reagan and Gorbachev continued to discuss bilateral issues like Central America, Southern Africa, the Middle East and the pending withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan. Reagan and Gorbachev continued their discussions on human rights. The parties signed seven agreements on lesser issues such as student exchanges and fishing rights. A significant result was the updating of Soviet history books, which necessitated cancelling some history classes in Soviet secondary schools. [...] In the end, Reagan expressed satisfaction with the summit.|$|R
50|$|These new roadways {{were built}} during a twelve-year period from 1994 to early 2006. The massive project became the largest urban {{construction}} project ever undertaken in American history. Construction {{on the new}} I-93 segment was not without serious issues: a lengthy Federal environmental review pushed the start of construction back from approximately 1990, causing many inflationary increases; funding for the project {{was the subject of}} several political battles between <b>Pres.</b> Ronald <b>Reagan</b> and Rep. Thomas P. O'Neill, Jr. Major construction on the new roadway was done while maintaining the old roadway, a step that also greatly increased the cost of the project. The original Charles River crossing, named Scheme Z, was the object to great public outcry {{similar to that of the}} building of the original highway. The outcry eventually led to the replacement of Scheme Z with a newer, more sleek cable-stayed bridge and complementing exit for Cambridge, increasing the cost even more.|$|R

5000|$|Senator Charles Schumer (D-NY) asked Alito whether {{statements}} in his 1985 ‘Personal Qualifications Statement’ when applying {{to be an}} Assistant Attorney General under <b>Pres.</b> Ronald <b>Reagan</b> represented his views {{at the time and}} also whether they represent his views today. Alito gave ananswer about stare decisis and the process he would use to consider how he would decide issues that might come before him. Senator Schumer responded, stating that Alito had stated forthrightly that [...] "the Constitution does not protect a right to an abortion". Senator Schumer said that [...] "it's important that you (Alito) give an answer." [...] Alito replied that if a case involving abortion rights came up, he would use a judicial process. Senator Schumer rejoined ... "I'm not asking about a process;.... Do you still believe it?" [...] Senator Schumer remarked [...] "I'm not asking you about case law". Senator Schumer then asked whether the [...] "Constitution protects the right of free speech" [...] whereupon Alito agreed. Senator Schumer then compared that question with {{the question of whether the}} Constitution protects the right to an abortion. Senator Schumer then made an elliptical comment about hypothetical in-laws. Senator Schumer said that he didn't expect Alito to answer the abortion question. Senator Schumer mentioned the National League of Cities v. Usery case and how it was overruled by Garcia v. San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority and how Lawrence v. Texas overruled Bowers v. Hardwick and Brown v. Board of Education overruled Plessy v. Ferguson. So Alito agreed that stare decisis is not inviolate. Senator Schumer made allusions to Justice Clarence Thomas's views on stare decisis, which he claimed included a call for Buckley v. Valeo, Calder v. Bull and a long string of cases establishing Supreme Court precedent to be overturned.|$|R
