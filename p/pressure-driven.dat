All <b>pressure-driven</b> filtration processes including microfiltration requires a degree of pressure {{to be applied to}} the feed liquid stream as well as imposed electrical concerns. Other factors contributing to safety are dependent on parameters of the process.

The Lodge rubberlike liquid managed to explain most {{of what could be}} reliably measured at the time (other than non-constant shear viscosity) and also anticipated nonlinear behavior not reliably measured until years later, such as the Lodge-Meissner relation. In 1974, Lodge followed up Elastic Liquids with his second text, Body Tensor Fields in Continuum Mechanics (Academic Press, 1974). Lodge was an inventor and entrepreneur, designing and marketing the on-line Lodge Stressmeter, a device for making accurate measurements of shear normal stress differences using <b>pressure-driven</b> slit flow.|$|E

[...] In addition, the shallow waters are susceptible to wind and barometric <b>pressure-driven</b> tidal fluctuations.

In such models, damage is balanced by “healing”, or the temperature and <b>pressure-driven</b> dynamic recrystallization of smaller grains into larger ones. If the reduction of grain size (damage) is intensely localized in a stagnant lid, an incipient crack in the mantle can turn into a full-blown rift, initiating plate tectonics. Conversely, a high surface temperature will have more efficient lithospheric healing, which is another potential explanation for why Venus has a stagnant lid and Earth does not.|$|E

5000|$|Natural {{ventilation}} harnesses naturally available {{forces to}} supply and remove air in an enclosed space. There are {{three types of}} natural ventilation occurring in buildings: wind driven ventilation, <b>pressure-driven</b> flows, and stack ventilation. The pressures generated by 'the stack effect' rely upon the buoyancy of heated or rising air. Wind driven ventilation relies upon {{the force of the}} prevailing wind to pull and push air through the enclosed space as well as through breaches in the building’s envelope. Seoul University Professor Wonjun Kwon recently discovered a new way to ventilate large area of indoor space. The so-called [...] "air pump" [...] system uses pressure between inside and outside of rooms to push air out of a structure. (see Infiltration (HVAC)).|$|E
50|$|There are 3 main {{diffusion}} mechanisms, {{the first}} (b), Knudsen diffusion holds {{at very low}} pressures where lighter molecules can move across a membrane faster than heavy ones, in a material with reasonably large pores. The second (c), molecular sieving, is the case where the pores of the membrane {{are too small to}} let one component pass, a process which is typically not practical in gas applications, as the molecules are too small to design relevant pores. In these cases the movement of molecules is best described by <b>pressure-driven</b> convective flow through capillaries, which is quantified by Darcy’s Law. However, the more general model in gas applications is the solution-diffusion (d) where particles are first dissolved onto the membrane and then diffuse through it both at different rates. This model is employed when the pores in the polymer membrane appear and disappear faster relative to the movement of the particles.|$|E
50|$|Sintering happens {{naturally}} in mineral deposits or as a manufacturing process used with metals, ceramics, plastics, and other materials. The {{atoms in the}} materials diffuse across {{the boundaries of the}} particles, fusing the particles together and creating one solid piece. Because the sintering temperature does not have to reach the melting point of the material, sintering is often chosen as the shaping process for materials with extremely high melting points such as tungsten and molybdenum. The study of sintering in metallurgy powder-related processes is known as powder metallurgy. An example of sintering can be observed when ice cubes in a glass of water adhere to each other, which is driven by the temperature difference between the water and the ice. Examples of <b>pressure-driven</b> sintering are the compacting of snowfall to a glacier, or the forming of a hard snowball by pressing loose snow together.|$|E
50|$|In latitudes {{where there}} are continents, winds blowing on light surface water can simply pile up light water against these continents. But in the Southern Ocean, the {{momentum}} imparted to the surface waters cannot be offset in this way. There are different theories on how the Circumpolar Current balance the momentum imparted by the winds. The increasing eastward momentum imparted by the winds causes water parcels to drift outward from the axis of the Earth's rotation (in other words, northward) {{as a result of}} the Coriolis force. This northward Ekman transport is balanced by a southward, <b>pressure-driven</b> flow below the depths of the major ridge systems. Some theories connect these flows directly, implying that there is significant upwelling of dense deep waters within the Southern Ocean, transformation of these waters into light surface waters, and a transformation of waters in the opposite direction to the north. Such theories link the magnitude of the Circumpolar Current with the global thermohaline circulation, particularly the properties of the North Atlantic.|$|E
50|$|This is {{achieved}} by using the concept of factorization of the mean. This is a very fundamental concept widely accepted and used in shallow flow modelling, including the shallow water flow, granular avalanches, debris flows, flash flood, tsunami and other type geophysical mass flows. It is assumed that the average of a product is approximated by {{the product of the}} averages. This simplification and approximation has great contributions in depth averaging the mass and momentum balance equations and associated expressions in mass flow modellings. This allows, for example, approximating the velocities by their means. This is mainly based on the observed phenomena that in smooth gravity- or <b>pressure-driven</b> geophysical and industrial mass flows, the momentum transfer in the direction normal to the main flow direction is negligible. Or in other words, the aspect ratio (typical flow depth divided by typical flow extent) is very small, or to say equivalently, the flow depth is much smaller than a typical wave length (long wave approximation).|$|E
50|$|The {{compartmentalization}} of {{the channels}} facilitates {{not only the}} flow of air as a fluid which delivers cells and nutrients to the apical surface of the epithelium, but also allows for pressure differences to exist between the middle and side channels. During normal inspiration in a human’s respiratory cycle, intrapleural pressure decreases, triggering {{an expansion of the}} alveoli. As air is pulled into the lungs, alveolar epithelium and the coupled endothelium in the capillaries are stretched. Since a vacuum is connected to the side channels, a decrease in pressure will cause the middle channel to expand, thus stretching the porous membrane and subsequently, the entire alveolar-capillary interface. The <b>pressure-driven</b> dynamic motion behind the stretching of the membrane, also described as a cyclic mechanical strain (valued at approximately 10%), significantly increases the rate of nanoparticle translocation across the porous membrane, when compared to a static version of this device, and to a Transwell culture system.|$|E
50|$|Acoustic {{tweezers}} {{have been}} developed to achieve 3D focusing of cells/particles in microfluidics. A schematic of the standing surface acoustic wave (SSAW) focusing device is shown in Fig. 5. A pair of interdigital transducers (IDTs) are deposited on a piezoelectric substrate, and a microfluidic channel is bonded with the substrate and positioned between the two IDTs. Microparticle solutions are infused into the microfluidic channel by a <b>pressure-driven</b> flow. Once an RF signal is applied to both IDTs, two series of surface acoustic waves (SAW) propagate in opposite directions toward the particle suspension solution inside the microchannel. The constructive interference of the two SAWs results in the formation of a SSAW, as well as the periodic distribution of the pressure nodes (minimum pressure amplitude) and anti-nodes (maximum pressure amplitude) on the substrate. When the SSAW encounter the liquid medium inside the channel, leakage waves in the longitudinal mode are generated, causing pressure fluctuations in the medium. These pressure fluctuations result in acoustic radiation forces that act laterally (in the x-direction of Fig. 8) on the particles. As a result, the suspended particles inside the channel will be forced toward either the pressure nodes or antinodes, depending on the density and compressibility of the particles and the medium. When the channel width covers only one pressure node (or antinode), the particles will be trapped in that node and consequently, focusing is achieved.|$|E

40|$|Electrorheological fluids offer {{potential}} for developing rapidly actuated hydraulic devices where shear forces or <b>pressure-driven</b> flow are present. In this study, the Bingham yield stress of electrorheological fluids with different particle volume fractions is investigated experimentally in wall-driven and <b>pressure-driven</b> flow modes using measurements in a parallel-plate rheometer and a microfluidic channel, respectively. A modified Krieger-Dougherty {{model can be}} used to describe the effects of the particle volume fraction on the yield stress and is in good agreement with the viscometric data. However, significant yield hardening in <b>pressure-driven</b> channel flow is observed and attributed to an increase and eventual saturation of the particle volume fraction in the channel.

The concept of surface roughness-viscosity model is used to account the effect of surface roughness. The pluglike velocity profile for electro-osmotic flow and the parabolic velocity profile for <b>pressure-driven</b> flow with delay in attaining the centerline velocity are observed. It is found that for electro-osmotic flow, the deviation in velocity profile from a flow in a smooth channel occurs near the wall, whereas in <b>pressure-driven</b> flow, such deviation is dominant in the core region.

40|$|Flame {{development}} in a statistically stationary and uniform, planar, one-dimensional turbulent flow is theoretically studied. A generalized balance equation for the mean combustion progress variable, which includes turbulent diffusion and <b>pressure-driven</b> transport terms, {{as well as the}} mean rate of product creation, is introduced and analyzed by invoking the sole assumption of a self-similar flame structure, well-supported by numerous experiments. The assumption offers the opportunity to simplify the problem by splitting the aforementioned partial differential equation into two ordinary differential equations, which separately model spatial variations of the progress variable and time variations of flame speed and thickness. The self-similar profile of the progress variable, obtained in numerous experiments, is theoretically predicted. Closures of the normalized <b>pressure-driven</b> transport term and mean rate of product creation are obtained. The closed balance equation shows that turbulent diffusion dominates during the initial stage of flame development, followed by the transition to counter-gradient transport in a sufficiently developed flame. A criterion of the transition is derived. The transition is promoted by the heat release and <b>pressure-driven</b> transport. Fully-developed mean flame brush thickness and speed are shown to decrease when either density ratio or <b>pressure-driven</b> transport increases. Solutions {{for the development of the}} thickness are obtained. The development is accelerated by the <b>pressure-driven</b> transport and heat release...|$|E
40|$|Properties of {{solutions}} of a generalized normalized balance equation for the Favre-averaged combustion progress variable are numerically {{studied in the}} simplest case of a statistically planar, one-dimensional, stationary and uniform flow of unburned mixture. The focus {{is placed on the}} dependence of the solutions on <b>pressure-driven</b> transport for several closures of the mean rate of product creation. The results show that: (1) The flame structure is self-similar if the <b>pressure-driven</b> transport is sufficiently strong, but the self-similarity can be also obtained even for zero <b>pressure-driven</b> transport by using a particular closure of the mean rate of product creation; (2) Both burning velocity and flame thickness decrease if the <b>pressure-driven</b> transport increases and this effect can be reduced to a decrease in the asymptotically fully-developed quantities. An analysis of a more general progress variable balance equation, performed by invoking the sole assumption of the self-similarity of the flame structure, quantitatively confirms many numerical results, in particular, (1) the profile of the progress variable, (2) the scaling of the asymptotically fully-developed flame brush thickness and burning velocity, and (3) the development of the flame brush thickness and burning velocity in the cases of weak and strong <b>pressure-driven</b> transport. The analysis straightforwardly shows that the above general balance equation may be reduced to the Zimont equation with modified diffusivity provided that the flame structure is self-similar...|$|E

These equations of motion are used to develop an equation for the <b>pressure-driven</b> flow of water.
