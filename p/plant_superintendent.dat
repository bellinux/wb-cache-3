Many of the layoffs in Detroit's auto industry, including Nitz's in 1979, had been due to the increasing market share of Japanese automakers, particularly due to Chrysler's increased sales of captively-imported Mitsubishi models rebadged and sold under the Dodge and now-defunct Plymouth brands, leading to allegations that Vincent Chin received racially charged comments attributing to the layoffs while being beaten.|$|E

40|$|Municipal {{wastewater}} treatment plants are among {{the main source of}} discharges of pollutants to the environment. How well these plants are managed and perform can {{have a significant impact on}} the ambient quality of the environment. The focus of this research is on the performance of public sector managers as compared to that of private sector managers. The central question is whether or not the approach of public sector managers to achieving emission reductions is one of cost minimization. In the theoretical literature this question receives conflicting answers: some models predict cost-minimization, whereas others predict that public sector managers will attempt to do more than what is required by emission standards. An examination of the actual performance of {{wastewater treatment}} plants in many jurisdictions in Canada and the U. S. supports the latter theory. For example, consistently over time, not only did virtually all Ontario municipal treatment plants emitting to Lake Erie and Lake Ontario comply with the existing emission standards for Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD), Suspended Solids (SS) and Phosphorus, but most performed considerably better than what was required. This observed phenomenon may be called “voluntary overcompliance”. Findings based on interviews with municipal treatment <b>plant</b> <b>superintendents,</b> recently retired <b>plant</b> <b>superintendents,</b> <b>plant</b> chemists, and other industry officials, clearly indicate that public sector managers have a various of different rationales for overcompliance. Can private sector managers be expected to do the same, or do they yield to pressures to reduce cost a the expense of the environmental quality? Does it make a difference whether or not the variable costs for electricity, chemicals and sludge disposal are pass through costs to the municipalities? And apart from the question of effluent quality, what are the major advantages and drawbacks of contracting? These questions will be answered by the results of a nationwide survey of over 100 contract operations in the United States.

In comparison to the standard, significantly less or more time was spent on specific categories of duties than experts recommended. Supervision of teachers and improvement of instruction, teaching, public relations, professional meetings and transportation consumed less time than both authorities and principals proposed, whereas office routines, administration of the <b>plant,</b> business management, <b>superintendent</b> 2 ̆ 7 s conferences and cafeteria received more time. Greater percentages of time were spent on subroles in the inter personal and informational clusters than on decisional matters, and when his time-on-task activities were matched with the paradigm, a sizable portion of his time was spent on monitorial and figurehead functions with relatively little time being given to leadership and decisional functions. The results of a questionnaire submitted to peers to rank activities in terms of urgency and importance indicated that as much was devoted to activities considered to be not urgent, not important as to activities considered important and urgent. The study implies that a principal must learn how to control the administrative day, so that he may spend more time on tasks of high priority. It is also clear that when the principal 2 ̆ 7 s activities are placed in the framework of Mintzberg 2 ̆ 7 s structure, a new dimension of understanding and appreciation for his role in school settings emerges.
