6000|$|He then {{arranged}} with Darius the plans {{which he had}} formed, so far as he needed the co-operation of the king in the execution of them. If he could gain a partial command in the Babylonian army, he {{was to make a}} sally from the city gates on a certain day, and attack a portion of the Persian army, which Darius was to leave <b>purposely</b> <b>exposed,</b> in order that he might gain credit with the Babylonians by destroying them. From this he supposed that the confidence which the Babylonians would repose in him would increase, and he might consequently receive a greater command. Thus he might, by acting in concert with Darius without, gradually gain such an ascendency within the city as finally to have power to open the gates and let the besiegers in. Darius was to station a detachment of a thousand men near a certain gate, leaving them imperfectly armed, on the tenth day after Zopyrus entered the city. These Zopyrus was to destroy. Seven days afterward, two thousand more were to be stationed in a similar manner at another point; and these were also to be destroyed by a second sally. Twenty days after this, four thousand more were to be similarly exposed. Thus seven thousand innocent and defenseless men would be slaughtered, but that, as Zopyrus said, would be [...] "of no consequence." [...] The lives of men were estimated by heroes and conquerors in those days only at their numerical value in swelling the army roll.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Microelectronic {{circuits}} exhibit increasing {{variations in}} performance, power consumption, and reliability parameters across the manufactured parts and across {{use of these}} parts over time in the field. These variations have led to increasing use of overdesign and guardbands in design and test to ensure yield and reliability {{with respect to a}} rigid set of datasheet specifications. This paper explores the possibility of constructing computing machines that <b>purposely</b> <b>expose</b> hardware variations to various layers of the system stack including software. This leads to the vision of underdesigned hardware that utilizes a software stack that opportunistically adapts to a sensed or modeled hardware. The envisioned Underdesigned and Opportunistic Computing (UnO) machines face a number of challenges related to the sensing infrastructure and software interfaces that can effectively utilize the sensory data. In this paper, we outline specific sensing mechanisms that we have developed and their potential use in building UnO machines. I...|$|R

5000|$|She {{was born}} on 29 July 1982 in Sta. Cruz Manila, Philippines. Both of her parents are professors and artists. Her father is the late noted painter Ibarra Dela Rosa. He was an art educator, a poet and a philosopher. As a painter, he was so prolific. He had a total of 80 solo {{exhibitions}} both in the Philippines and abroad {{at the time of}} his demise. Her mother, Ethel Dimacuha was a humanities professor at noted universities in Manila. She had also several solo exhibitions in different Manila galleries. At first, Camille's father did not want her to pursue becoming a visual artist like him because perhaps he is aware of the then pathetic plight of artists, without a single stable job. He did not teach her how to paint; did not even <b>purposely</b> <b>exposed</b> her to the art world he circulated in. But after her father's demise in 1998, she taught herself how to paint, and pursued her own artistic vision and then used her father's style and previous paintings as an inspiration.

Because of her natural born talent and artistic skills when it comes to painting Impressionism, an article by Cid Reyes renowned her as the [...] "Youngest impressionist painter in the Philippines" [...] during her time.|$|E
40|$|The supermolecular {{building}} layer (SBL) {{approach was}} employed to deliberately synthesize five novel metal–organic frameworks (1 – 5) with an exposed array of amide or amine functionalities within their pore system. The ability to decorate the pores with nitrogen donor moieties offers potential to evaluate/elucidate the structure–adsorption property relationship. Two MOF platforms, eea-MOF and rtl-MOF, based on pillaring of kgm-a or sql-a layers with heterofunctional 3 -connected organic building blocks were targeted and constructed to <b>purposely</b> introduce and <b>expose</b> the desired amide or amine functionalities. Interestingly, gas adsorption properties of eea-MOF- 4 (1) and eea-MOF- 5 (2) showed that by simply altering the nitrogen donor position within the ligand, {{it is possible to}} relatively reduce the pore size of the related eea-MOF material and subsequently increase the associated CO 2 uptake. The slightly confined pore space in 2, relative to 1, has enabled an enhancement of the pore local charge density and thus the observed relative increase in the CO 2 and H 2 isosteric heat of adsorption (Qst). In addition, light hydrocarbon adsorption studies revealed that 2 is more selective toward C 2 H 6 and C 3 H 8 over CH 4 than 1, as exemplified for C 2 H 6 : CH 4 (5 : 95) or C 3 H 8 : CH 4 (5 : 95) binary gas mixtures...|$|R
40|$|Beginning {{with the}} {{juvenile}} essay on Proust, {{the theme of}} memory (and forgetting) has a prominent place in nearly all Beckett’s works. However, the attentive and skilled use of technology allows the author to explore more efficiently and at a greater extent memory’s dimensions and procedures in the works thought for, or making use of, the media. Especially in the plays exploiting electro-acoustic technologies, the essential metaphor of memory {{as a way of}} recording and archiving (voluntarily or involuntarily) the past, coincides with the plays performing practices. The use of a tape recorder in Krapp’s Last Tapes and of a radio recording control panel in radio plays such as Embers and Rough for Radio II allows Beckett to dis-member the black box of re-membering in search of the mechanisms which govern its procedures and of the mnestic traces left and, voluntarily or involuntarily, recovered by the subject. Among them, one is made aware of the essential difference between the voices (and sounds) purposely transcripted on consciousness tapes as under an autobiographical project-driven dictate, and the traces which make tracks dirty with imperceptible but obsessing silences, humming and buzzing: non filtered and non homogenized data discontinuously revealing the perturbing content of the forgotten. In addition, thanks to the oral/aural medium (recorded and/or broadcast voices) and its functioning, not only is the presence/absence aporia of the incorporeal technological sound – which can pre-exist, coexist or survive his/her owner’s body – <b>purposely</b> exploited to <b>expose</b> the presence/absence aporia of memories - mnestic traces of what was and is no more, but also the fragmentary and discontinuous essence of the self, in the totally subjective intermittence between (the transmission of) memory and its more or less aware deletion, is efficaciously dramatized...|$|R

While being neutral to small parallel shifts of the yield curve, a butterfly is <b>purposely</b> <b>exposed</b> to specific bets on particular changes of the yield curve. There exist four different types of butterflies, the cash-and $duration neutral weighting butterfly, the fifty-fifty weighting regression, the regression weighting butterfly and the maturity weighting butterfly. In this paper, we show that they generate a positive pay-off when the particular flattening or steepening move of the yield curve they were structured for capturing occurs. We also argue that one suitable way to detect the opportunity to enter a specific butterfly is to use spread indicators. Finally, we show that the curvature $duration obtained from the Nelson and Siegel (1987) model ca...|$|E
40|$|Purpose This study {{aimed to}} {{demonstrate}} highlighting the urethra during surgery {{through the use}} of two different methods: a new near infra-red fluorophore IRDye 800 BK; and of indocyanine green (ICG) mixed with silicone. Method Male cadavers from the department of anatomy at the University of Oxford were used to visualise the urethra during near-infrared fluorescence excitation. To assess IRDye 800 BK, a perineal incision was utilised after infiltrating the urethra directly with an IRDye 800 BK solution mixed with Instillagel. ICG-silicone was assessed when the urethra was <b>purposely</b> <b>exposed</b> as part of a simulated transanal total mesorectal (TaTME) dissection. ICG was previously mixed with ethanol and silicone and left to set in a Foley catheter. Fluorescence was visualised using an in-house manufactured fluorescence-enabled laparoscopic system. Results IRDye 800 BK demonstrated excellent penetration and visualisation of the urethra under fluorescence at an estimated tissue depth of 2 cm. An ICG-silicone catheter demonstrated excellent fluorescence without leaving any residual solution behind in the urethra after its removal. Conclusions IRDye 800 BK is a promising alternative to ICG in visualising the urethra using fluorescence imaging. Its depth of penetration may allow earlier detection of the urethra during surgery and thus prevent wrong plane surgery sooner. The newly described ICG-silicone method opens up the possibility of new technologies in this area of fluorescence guided surgery. </p...|$|E
