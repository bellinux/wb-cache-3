A total of 76 sample trees with a total number of 889 whorls and 3658 live branches were used to develop the outer <b>crown</b> <b>profile</b> model of the planted Pinus sylvestris var. mongolica trees in Heilongjiang Province, China. The power-exponential equation, modified Kozak equation, and simple polynomial equation were used and the model which showed the best performance {{was used as the}} basic model. The dummy variable approach was used to analyze the effect of stand age and stand density on the <b>crown</b> <b>profile.</b> Quantile regression for linear mixed-effects model, where the correlations between the series measurements on the same subject were considered, was used to model the outer <b>crown</b> <b>profile.</b> The results indicated that the power-exponential equation had the smallest error and was used as the basic model. Based on the dummy variable approach, stand age and stand density showed significant effects on the <b>crown</b> <b>profile</b> on the whole. Thus, they were directly included into the linear form of the power-exponential equation by a natural logarithm transformation to develop the quantile regression for the linear mixed-effects model. The 0. 95 th quantile regression model performed best in modeling the outer <b>crown</b> <b>profile</b> when compared to other quantiles. The prediction accuracy of the 0. 95 th quantile regression model by adding the random effects increased when compared to the quantile regression without random effect. The quantile regression for the linear mixed-effects model also showed an excellent performance in the largest crown radius prediction when compared to the quantile regression model. From suppressed trees to dominant trees, the crown radius increased, with tree size increasing for the same stand age and stand density increases. The crown radius of the suppressed trees from 21 to 40 year stands was the largest and the smallest was from older (> 40 years) stands. The crown radius for both the intermediate and dominant trees from 21 to 40 year stands were similar and were larger than the younger (10 – 20 years) stands. The crown radius increased with tree size when the stand variables were constant. Furthermore, the crown radius increased with the increase of stand age, decreased with increasing stand density, and decreased with increased ratio of tree height to diameter at the breast height (HD) for trees with the same tree variables. Stand density had a weaker effect on the <b>crown</b> <b>profile</b> when compared to the HD.

40|$|A {{hot rolled}} strip {{produced}} by any integrated steel plant would require satisfying some stringent requirements of its surface <b>profile.</b> <b>Crown</b> and Flatness are two industrially accepted quantifiers {{that relate to the}} geometric tolerances in the rolled strips. This study attempts to regulate both crown and flatness within an acceptable limit, satisfying more than one objective at a time. Mathematically, this leads to a multi-objective optimization problem where the solution is no longer unique and a family of equally feasible solutions leads to the so called Pareto-Front, where each member is simply as good as the others. To implement this concept in the present context, one needs to realize that the surface deformation, which is ultimately imparted to the rolled sheets, comes from more than one source. The wear of the rolls, their thermal expansion, bending, and also deformation, contribute significantly towards the crown and flatness that is ultimately observed. During this study a detailed mathematical model has been worked out for this process incorporating all of these phenomena. Computation for the Pareto-optimality has been carried out using different forms of biologically inspired Genetic Algorithms, often integrated with an Ant Colony Optimization Scheme. Ultimately the model has been fine tuned for the hot rolling practice in a major integrated steel plant and tested against their actual operational data...|$|R

50|$|Crown volumes can be {{measured}} {{as an extension of}} the basic crown spread measurement. One method is to map a network of points on the outer surface of the crown from various positions around the tree and plotted by map position and height. The crown itself can be subdivided into smaller segments and the volume of each segment calculated individually. For example, the crown could be subdivided into a series of disk-like slices by elevation, the volume of each disk calculated, and the total of all the disks are added together to determine crown volume. Frank developed a simpler method that requires measuring average crown spread, height of the crown from base to top, and matching the <b>crown</b> <b>profile</b> to best fit of a family of <b>crown</b> <b>profile</b> shapes.

Overall, thinned then MPB-attacked units had less fuel and lower crown fire potential than unthinned attacked units.

The roller profiles analyzed were flat, tapered end, aerospace, and fully crowned loaded against a flat raceway. Four rolling-element bearing life models were chosen for this analysis and compared. These were those of Weibull, Lundberg and Palmgren, Ioannides and Harris, and Zaretsky. The flat roller profile without edge loading has the longest predicted life.

The end tapered profile produced the highest lives but not significantly different than the aerospace <b>profile.</b> The fully <b>crowned</b> <b>profile</b> produces the lowest lives.
