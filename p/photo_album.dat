5|$|I {{wanted it}} to be almost like a <b>photo</b> <b>album,</b> so every single scene is kind of like a picture that you're kind of looking into our relationship. So it is a 1920s vibe, it's black and white, very high fashion—you know, you'll see me very dapper in 1920s, Frank Sinatra-ish. So you'll see the cars from that era, you'll {{definitely}} feel the vibe of the house having that 1920s vibe as well. So it's very different and very intimate, and it's not a lot of dancing—it's more personal.|$|E

5|$|Scully and Doggett {{arrive at}} the crime scene in Idaho and meet Detective Yale Abbott. He says they are less sure that the bites were made by a human and draws their {{attention}} to the strange footprint, believing that wild animals fed on the bodies after the fact. Scully points out {{that there is only one}} footprint, which looks ominously human, and that if it were left by an animal there would be more footprints leading to the bodies. Scully and Doggett check out the house and find prints leading upstairs and into the attic. Inside, Scully and Doggett find the missing fingers of the undertaker. They look like they have been regurgitated by something and the claw marks in the attic suggest something was hanging from the rafters. Meanwhile, elderly Mrs. McKesson is killed in her attic while looking at a <b>photo</b> <b>album.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Doctor, suspecting {{that the}} {{wardrobe}} contains the evil George fears, opens {{it to find}} its contents are simply clothes and toys, including a doll house. The Doctor suddenly recalls from Alex's <b>photo</b> <b>album</b> that Claire did not appear pregnant in {{the weeks leading up}} to George's supposed birth, causing Alex to remember the fact that Claire was unable to have children. The Doctor asserts that George is a Tenza child, an empathic alien who took on the form of Alex and Claire's desired child through a perception filter, and has the ability to literally lock away his fears in the wardrobe. George begins to panic from this revelation and the Doctor and Alex are pulled into the wardrobe, joining Rory in the dollhouse. As the dolls descend on the three, the Doctor calls out to George to face his fears; George is able to open the wardrobe and appears in the dollhouse, but the dolls turn to advance on him. The Doctor realises that George is still frightened that Alex and Claire plan to send him away, having mistakenly interpreted a conversation they had earlier that night; Alex rushes through the dolls to embrace George as his son. They all soon find themselves back at the estate, restored to normal. Claire returns the next morning to find George no longer scared while Alex and the Doctor make him breakfast. After being thanked, the Doctor rejoins his companions to set off for their next adventure.|$|E

40|$|All {{the major}} modernist women, H. D., Dorothy Richardson and Virginia Woolf owned the ‘vest-pocket’ Kodak, were {{prolific}} photographers and created visual theories {{aware that this}} new technology offered a new visual aesthetic. The chapter argues that {{an evaluation of the}} margins – <b>photo</b> <b>albums</b> as well as image/texts like Woolf’s Three Guineas - is crucial to rethinking modernist aesthetics by recovering feminine meanings from hitherto ‘invisible’ art. There are over one thousand un-catalogued photographs taken by Virginia and her husband Leonard Woolf, many in <b>photo</b> <b>albums</b> mounted by Woolf. While there are essays about Woolf’s visual aesthetics, most essays discuss the role of the visual in Woolf’s writings rather than examine Woolf’s domestic photographs as artefacts in themselves. The <b>photo</b> <b>albums</b> unusual visual sequences represent a fascinating psychobiography, in particular revealing Woolf’s identification with her dead mother...|$|R
