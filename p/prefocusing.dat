The device consists of <b>prefocusing</b> region and sorting region with great {{potential to be}} integrated into advanced lab-on-a-chip bioanalysis devices. Particles or cells can be focused in the <b>prefocusing</b> region and then sorted in the sorting region. The DEP-active hydrophoretic sorting is not only based on size but also on dielectric properties of the particles or cells of interest without any labelling. A mixture of 3 and 10 um particles were sorted and collected from corresponding outlets with high separation efficiency. According to the different dielectric properties of viable and nonviable Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells at the medium conductivity of 0. 03 S/m, the viable CHO cells were focused well and sorted from cell sample with a high purity...|$|E
40|$|The {{field of}} cytometry {{has grown in}} scope and {{importance}} ever since the early 20 th century with leaps in technology introducing the Coulter counter and the flow cytometer. Cytometry methods have brought about a revolution for the medical and biotechnology industry by providing fast and accurate analysis of cell and particle suspensions. Recent developments in the field aim at improving current cytometers and to provide miniaturized low-cost cytometry systems for point-of-care clinical diagnostics or research. In an attempt to address the need for particle positioning which is important for both impedance and optically based cytometers we present a microfluidic system which precisely positions cells and particles, using acoustic forces and subsequently performs measurements using an integrated and simple planar electrode Coulter-type impedance cytometer {{without the need for}} sheath flows. Data is presented to show how the acoustic method improves the accuracy of the impedance cytometer when <b>prefocusing</b> is employed to particles and cells (diluted whole blood). Confocal imaging and simulations support the findings and provide the basis for further improvements. The acoustophoretic <b>prefocusing</b> technique opens a path towards small, low cost cytometers while also providing an easy way to improve current systems...|$|E

It is shown in our experiments that the diameter, length, stability, and interaction for the two cases can be quite different. The filaments formed by <b>prefocused</b> beam indicate dynamic spatial evolution with higher laser intensity and electron density. They have a typical diameter of 100 mu m are of shorter length. In the free propagation case, the filaments exhibit interesting properties such as hundred-meter propagation distance and mm-size diameter.

40|$|The {{reduction}} in the focal depth of field that occurs {{through the use of}} larger apertures in aberration-corrected STEM allows three-dimensional information to be retrieved by optical depth sectioning. This paper explores depth sectioning in zone-axis crystals using Bloch wave calculations. By decomposing the calculation into the contribution from individual states and from individual partial plane waves in the convergent cone of illumination, we explain the form of the electron intensity in the crystal as a function of depth. Two separate effects are found that can cause the intensity maximum to deviate from that of the expected defocus value. Firstly it is found that the unbound, high angle excited states give rise to a behaviour {{similar to that of the}} probe focusing in the vacuum, but with a <b>prefocusing</b> effect due to the lensing effect of the potential of the atomic column. Superimposed upon this prefocused peak is an oscillation due to interference between the channelling 1 s state and the rest of the wavefunction. This oscillation can actually prevent an intensity maximum being formed at certain depths in the crystal, and will complicate the interpretation of optical sectioning data...|$|E
40|$|Standard {{synthetic}} aperture radar (SAR) processing algorithms use analytically derived transfer functions in the 2 -D frequency and range/Doppler domains. These rely on the assumption of hyperbolic range histories of monostatic SARs with straight flight paths. For bistatic SARs, the range histories are no longer hyperbolic, and simple analytic transforms do not exist. This paper offers two solutions for bistatic SAR data processing under the restriction of quasi-stationarity, i. e., sufficiently equal velocity vectors of transmitter and receiver. 1) Moderately bistatic configurations can be handled satisfactorily by using hyperbolic range functions with a modified velocity parameter, which is a solution already well known for the accommodation of curved orbits in the monostatic case. This “equivalent velocity” approach is shown to be of surprising range of validity even for pronounced bistatic situations. It {{is not to be}} confused with the “equivalent monostatic flight path” approximation, which is shown to be inapplicable for any practical case. 2) With increasing separation of transmitter and receiver, the equivalent velocity approximation deteriorates. To cope with extreme bistatic configurations, a general approach named “NuSAR” is proposed, where the involved transfer functions are replaced by numerically computed ones. This paper describes how the transfer functions are computed from the given orbits and the shape of the Earth surface. In any of these two cases, the bistatic SAR data can be processed by standard SAR processors; only the conventional transfer functions need to be replaced. Neither are there time-domain <b>prefocusing</b> or postfocusing steps required nor complicated mathematical expansions involved. The presented algorithms are also applicable to very high resolution wide-swath (or squinted) SARs on curved orbits...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn {{this article}} we wish {{to report on the}} {{commissioning}} of the SU 5 undulator-based beamline, whose primary scientific goal deals with high-resolution spectroscopy and photon-induced dynamics in the vacuum ultraviolet range on dilute species. In order to achieve such a scientific program, we have conceived an original optical design, centered around a 6. 65 m off-plane Eagle monochromator equipped with two gratings (2400 and 4300 l/mm) illuminated by an astigmatic <b>prefocusing</b> optical system. The different components of the actual beamline, such as the optical elements, their holders/manipulators and the monochromator are described, with a special emphasis on critical aspects such as the mechanical resolution and stability, the vibrations limitations, and the thermal stability. Then, a spectral calibration procedure of the monochromator is described, followed by the presentation of the measured performances of the beamline in terms of ultimate resolution and flux. Owing to a gas phase ion yield experiment on rare gases, {{we have been able to}} measure a raw linewidth of 184 µeV at 21. 61 eV (18 s line of Ne) corresponding to a resolving power of 117 000 and a raw (respectively, lifetime-deconvoluted) linewidth of 119 µeV (respectively, 76 µeV) at 15. 82 eV (13 s line of Ar) corresponding to a raw resolving power of 133 000 (respectively, 208 000). The ultimate targeted 105 resolving power is therefore observed on most of the VUV range, which corresponds to an unprecedented performance. The measured photon flux in a 1 / 50 000 bandwidth is in reasonable agreement with the expected values lying in the 1010 – 109 photon/s range over the VUV range. These very satisfactory performances, with a slit-limited resolution down to about 15 µm slits aperture, are due to the special care which has been paid at both the conception and construction stages concerning critical issues such as the optical and mechanical design, the vibrations, the driving/encoding system, and the slope errors of the gratings...|$|E

40|$|It {{is shown}} that the limited-diffraction Bessel beam of order zero can be {{generated}} by a transducer with equal-area division of elements and with a fixed <b>prefocus,</b> i. e. conventional transducers used in medical imaging equipment.

40|$|Bessel and conical {{beams and}} {{approximation}} with annular arrays Abstract — The Bessel beam {{is one of}} the relatively new limiteddiffraction beams that have been discovered. It is compared with the conical transducer which also gives an approximate limited-diffraction solution to the wave equation. It is shown that the conical transducer’s field deviates from the predicted field in the nearfield, where it is wider. Therefore the Bessel beam is better for use in a hybrid system where a limited-diffraction beam is used for transmission and a dynamically focused beam for reception. It is also shown that the limited-diffraction Bessel beam of order zero can be excited on an annular transducer with equal-area division of elements and with a fixed <b>prefocus,</b> i. e. conventional transducers used in commercial medical imaging equipment. The element division implies that the scaling parameter must be chosen to contain the first lobe of the Bessel function in the first element. In addition, the <b>prefocus</b> must be such that the array is steerable to infinite depth with minor loss. Even when the Bessel beam yields a larger depth of field than that of an unfocused transducer, we show that it has the advantage of a narrower beam. Simulated examples are shown where the approximate Bessel beam compares favorably with a spherically focused beam with a fixed focus, an unfocused beam, and a conical transducer. I...|$|R

40|$|A method using subapertures {{that are}} <b>prefocused</b> {{near the middle}} of the region of {{interest}} is proposed as a substitute for composite focusing commonly used in abdominal ultrasound imaging. In that method M transmit zones are stitched together in order to achieve close to dynamic transmit focusing. The depth of focus of each zone is proportional to the inverse square of the aperture D, and the focused region is approximately M times that. In the proposed method, the aperture is divided into non-overlapping subapertures of size D/N. Each subaperture transmits a pre-focused beam with dynamic focusing on the full aperture on reception. Data from the subapertures is combined using synthetic aperture processing. The depth of focus for each subaperture is N*N times that of the full aperture. Thus the equivalent of composite focusing with M=N*N zones is achieved with N subapertures. Thus a framerate increase of N is achieved. In addition to the increase in framerate, the focusing is of more uni [...] ...|$|R
40|$|In this work, invoking join {{asymmetric}} ac polarization using double half-quadrupole electrodes in a symmetric arrangement, we {{demonstrate a}} head-on ac electro-osmotic streaming capable of focusing and trapping DNA molecules efficiently. This is manifested by {{the observation that}} picomolar DNA molecules can be trapped into a large crosslike spot with at least {{an order of magnitude}} concentration enhancement within just half a minute. We identify that the phenomenon is a combined result of the formation of two <b>prefocused</b> DNA jets flowing toward each other, dipole-induced attraction between focused DNA molecules, and dielectrophoretic trap on the spot. With an additional horizontal pumping, we observe that the trap can transform into a peculiar pitchfork streaming capable of continuous collection and long-distance transport of concentrated DNA molecules. We also show that the same electrode design can be used to direct assembly of submicrometer particles.

40|$|Object-substitution masking (OSM) {{occurs when}} a mask, such as four dots that {{surround}} a brief target item, onsets simultaneously with the target and offsets a short time after the target, rather than simultaneously with it. OSM is a reduction in accuracy of reporting the target with the temporally trailing mask, compared with the simultaneously offsetting mask. It has been thought that OSM occurs only if attention cannot be rapidly focused, or <b>prefocused,</b> on the target location. One line of evidence for this is a reported interaction between target display set size and {{the duration of the}} trailing mask. We analyze the evidence for this interaction and suggest it occurs only as an artifact of data being compressed by a ceiling effect. We report six experiments that support this interpretation by showing that the interaction is always absent unless a ceiling effect is induced. We go on to analyze other evidence to support the notion that attention modulates OSM, and argue that in each case, the data either reflect a ceiling effect or can be explained in another way. Our data and our analyses of the existing literature have strong implications for how OSM should be conceptualized. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} investigates how focus is phonetically {{realized}} in declarative sentences in American English. The {{goal is to}} test the hypotheses that, (a) focus is manifested in parallel rather than in alternation with other intonational functions, and (b) every syllable in a sentence {{is associated with a}} local pitch target. Eight native speakers of American English recorded short declarative sentences with narrow focus at different locations or without any narrow focus. Detailed f 0 analyses reveal that a narrow focus is realized by expanding the pitch range of the on-focus stressed syllables, suppressing the pitch range of postfocus syllables, and leaving the pitch range of <b>prefocus</b> syllables largely intact. Focus is not found, however, to determine {{the presence or absence of}} f 0 peaks. Data analyses also reveal evidence for the presence of a local pitch target in every syllable. These findings are incompatible with conventional theories of English intonation. As an alternative, the Parallel Encoding and Target Approximation (PENTA) model is considered. The model defines and organizes the intonational components in terms of function rather than form. It also assumes target approximation rather than interpolation as the basic articulatory mechanism of f 0 contour generation. It is argued that the approach used in the PENTA model, which takes account of both communicative functions and articulatory implementation, may provide a coherent account o...|$|R

40|$|Hard x-ray free-electron lasers are novel {{sources of}} {{coherent}} x-rays with unprecedented brightness and very short pulses. The radiation from these sources enables {{a wide range}} of new experiments that were not possible with previous x-ray sources. Many of these experiments require the possibility to focus the intense x-ray beam onto small samples. This Thesis investigates the possibility to use diffractive zone plate optics to focus the radiation from hard x-ray free-electron lasers. The challenge for any optical element at free-electron laser sources is that the intensity in a single short pulses is high enough to potentially damage the optics. This is especially troublesome for zone plates, which are typically made of high Z elements that absorb {{a large part of the}} incident radiation. The first part of the Thesis is dedicated to simulations, where the temperature behavior of zone plates exposed to hard x-ray free-electron laser radiation is investigated. It is found that the temperature increase in a single pulse is several hundred Kelvin but still below the melting point of classical zone plate materials, such as gold, tungsten, and iridium. Even though the temperature increases are not high enough to melt a zone plate it is possible that stresses and strains caused by thermal expansion can damage the zone plate. This is first investigated in an experiment where tungsten gratings on diamond substrates are heated to high temperatures by a pulsed visible laser. It is found that the gratings are not damaged by the expected temperature fluctuations at free-electron lasers. Finally, a set of tungsten zone plates are tested at the Linac Coherent Light Source where they are exposed to a large number of pulses at varying fluence levels in a <b>prefocused</b> beam. Damage is only observed at fluence levels above those typically found in an unfocused x-ray free-electron laser beam. At higher fluences an alternative is to use a diamond zone plate, which has significantly less absorption and should be able to survive much higher fluence. Damage in diamond structures is investigated during the same experiment, but due to a remaining tungsten etch mask on top of the diamond the results are difficult to interpret. Additionally, we also demonstrate how the classical Ronchi test can be used to measure aberrations in focusing optics at an x-ray free-electron laser in a single pulse. The main result of this Thesis is that tungsten zone plates on diamond substrates can be used at hard x-ray free-electron laser sources. QC 20130514 </p...|$|R
