50|$|Before {{discussing}} the list, let's make the following observation. In {{the case of}} infinitely running systems, one is often interested in whether certain behavior is repeated infinitely often. For example, if a network card receives infinitely many <b>ping</b> <b>requests,</b> then it may fail to respond {{to some of the}} requests but should respond to an infinite subset of received <b>ping</b> <b>requests.</b> This motivates the following definition: For any run ρ, let Inf(ρ) be the set of states that occur infinitely often in ρ. This notion of certain states being visited infinitely often will be helpful in defining the following acceptance conditions.|$|R
30|$|Failure sensor: {{checks the}} status (available or failed) of {{secondary}} servers. It sends <b>ping</b> <b>requests</b> to each secondary server periodically (typically, every 20 seconds). If the server does not respond, the server status {{will be changed}} to fail.|$|R
40|$|This {{document}} {{defines a}} means of remotely initiating Multiprotocol Label Switched Protocol (MPLS) Pings on Label Switched Paths. An MPLS Proxy <b>Ping</b> <b>Request</b> is sent to any Label Switching Router along a Label Switched Path. The primary motivations for this facility are first {{to limit the number}} of messages and related processing when using LSP Ping in large Point-to-Multipoint LSPs, and second to enable tracing from leaf to leaf (or root).

30|$|The {{design of}} the {{mechanism}} {{is based on the}} PubSubHubbub protocol [16], or Hubbub for short, which introduces a special entity called hub into the traditional publish/subscribe communication model. In Hubbub, once that a consumer makes its first request for a provider's resource, the response representation contains a link pointing to the hub service used by the provider to advertise resource updates; consumers interested in receiving notifications for that particular resource must send a subscription request to the linked hub. The hub stores a local copy of the representation that will be updated after it receives a <b>ping</b> <b>request</b> from the provider notifying him that new data is available. If this does not happen within a certain time window, the hub requests the resource by itself and updates its local copy; whenever the resource is updated, the hub notifies each of the subscribers which can then request the hub's updated representation.|$|E
50|$|Broadcasting may {{be abused}} {{to perform a}} type of DoS-attack known as a Smurf attack. The {{attacker}} sends fake <b>ping</b> <b>requests</b> with the source IP-address of the victim computer. The victim computer is flooded by the replies from all computers in the domain.|$|R
5000|$|An ICMP tunnel [...] (also {{known as}} ICMPTX) {{establishes}} a covert connection between two remote computers (a client and proxy), using ICMP echo requests and reply packets. An {{example of this}} technique is tunneling complete TCP traffic over <b>ping</b> <b>requests</b> and replies.|$|R

50|$|In early {{implementations}} of TCP/IP, this bug is easy {{to exploit}} and can affect {{a wide variety of}} systems including Unix, Linux, Mac, Windows, and peripheral devices. As systems began filtering out pings of death through firewalls and other detection methods, a different kind of ping attack known as ping flooding later appeared, which floods the victim with so many <b>ping</b> <b>requests</b> that normal traffic fails to reach the system (a basic denial-of-service attack).|$|R
40|$|Oftentimes during special <b>ping</b> <b>requests</b> or {{protocol}} tests routers {{take much}} longer to process ip packets with set ip options than to process packets without options. This {{research was conducted}} {{in order to find}} out the average processing time discrepancy between those two types of ip packets and thus to come to a conclusion about the usability of ip packets with options. Even though the packets with options tend to be processed slower than the packets without options, this study shows that this delay is not as significant as sporadic measurements might indicate...|$|R

5000|$|On 28 April 2001, IPoAC was {{actually}} {{implemented by the}} Bergen Linux user group, under the name CPIP (for [...] "Carrier Pigeon Internet Protocol"). They sent nine packets over a distance of approximately five kilometers (three miles), each carried by an individual pigeon and containing one <b>ping</b> (ICMP Echo <b>Request),</b> and received four responses.|$|R
50|$|The DDMa {{component}} (Discovery and Dependency mapping Advanced) of UCMDB {{works by}} scanning ranges of IP addresses within pre-set probe IP ranges, using <b>ping,</b> ICMP echo <b>requests</b> and Nmap to locate live IP addresses and open ports, and IP address harvesting techniques by querying ARP/Cache tables of level 3 network devices. Resulting current IP addresses are then translated into CI's which function as input for higher (deeper) level discovery. The pyramid model makes sure only relevant sources are being queried, resulting in lower network and node load.|$|R
50|$|An {{example is}} sending a <b>ping</b> (ICMP echo <b>request)</b> with the wrong MAC address but the right IP address. If an adapter is {{operating}} in normal mode, it will drop this frame, and the IP stack never sees or responds to it. If the adapter is in promiscuous mode, the frame will be passed on, and the IP stack on the machine (to which a MAC address has no meaning) will respond as it would to any other ping. The sniffer can prevent this by configuring his or her firewall to block ICMP traffic.|$|R
50|$|In some cases, a {{broadcast}} storm can be instigated {{for the purpose}} of a denial of service (DOS) using one of the packet amplification attacks, such as the smurf attack or fraggle attack, where smurf sends a large amount of ICMP Echo <b>Requests</b> (<b>ping)</b> traffic to {{a broadcast}} address, with each ICMP Echo packet containing the spoof source address of the victim host. When the spoofed packet arrives at the destination network, all hosts on the network reply to the spoofed address. The initial Echo Request is multiplied by the number of hosts on the network. This generates a storm of replies to the victim host tying up network bandwidth, using up CPU resources or possibly crashing the victim.|$|R
50|$|Teredo servers {{can also}} {{transmit}} ICMPv6 packet from Teredo clients toward the IPv6 Internet. In practice, when a Teredo client wants to contact a native IPv6 node, it must locate the corresponding Teredo relay, i.e., to which public IPv4 and UDP port number to send encapsulated IPv6 packets. To do that, the client crafts an ICMPv6 Echo <b>Request</b> (<b>ping)</b> toward the IPv6 node, and sends it through its configured Teredo server. The Teredo server de-capsulates the ping onto the IPv6 Internet, {{so that the}} ping should eventually reach the IPv6 node. The IPv6 node should then reply with an ICMPv6 Echo Reply, as mandated by RFC 2460. This reply packet is routed to the closest Teredo relay, which — finally — tries to contact the Teredo client.|$|R
5000|$|In {{order to}} avoid {{licensing}} Hayes's patent, some manufacturers implemented the escape sequence without the time guard interval (Time Independent Escape Sequence (TIES)). This had a major denial of service security implication in that {{it would lead to}} the modem hanging up the connection should the computer ever try to transmit the byte sequence [...] "+++ATH0" [...] in data mode. For any computer connected to the Internet through such a modem, this could be easily exploited by sending it a <b>ping</b> of death <b>request</b> containing the sequence [...] "+++ATH0" [...] in the payload. The computer operating system would automatically try to reply the sender with the same payload, immediately disconnecting itself from the Internet, as the modem would interpret the ICMP packet's data payload as a Hayes command. The same error would also trigger if, for example, the user of the computer ever tried to send an e-mail containing the aforementioned string.|$|R
40|$|Measuring and {{monitoring}} network RTT (round-trip time) {{is important for}} multiple reasons: it allows network operators and end users to understand their network performance and help optimize their environment, and it helps businesses understand the responsiveness of their services to sections of their user base. Measuring network RTT is also important for TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) stacks to help optimize bandwidth usage. TCP stacks on end hosts optimize for high performance by passively measuring network RTTs using widely deployed TCP timestamp options carried in TCP headers. This information, if utilized, carries some dis tinct operational advantages for servic es and applications: hosts {{do not need to}} launch out-of-band ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) echo <b>requests</b> (<b>pings),</b> nor do they need to embed tim ing information in application traffic. Instead, hosts can passively measure RTT representative of full-path network latency experienced by TCP traffic. Understanding network delay is key to understanding some important aspects of network performance. The time taken to traverse the network be tween two hosts affects how responsive services are, and it affects the effective bandwidth available to end hosts. Mea suring this information passively on servers can help provide a fine-grained indication of service responsiveness from th...|$|R
