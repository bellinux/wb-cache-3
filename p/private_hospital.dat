40|$|In this paper, {{trends in}} {{hospital}} service provision are measured using {{data on the}} numbers and nature of hospitals, on hospital expenditure and on hospital activity over recent years. The number of public acute care hospitals was fairly stable, however, bed numbers decreased. Hospital numbers rose for <b>private</b> <b>hospitals,</b> as did numbers of beds, particularly for group for-profit <b>private</b> <b>hospitals.</b> Recurrent health expenditure on hospitals {{as a proportion of}} all recurrent health expenditure fell, although it rose for <b>private</b> <b>hospitals,</b> and real increases in expenditure occurred for both public acute and <b>private</b> <b>hospitals.</b> Population rates for separations and patient days rose for <b>private</b> <b>hospitals</b> and were stable and fell, respectively, for public acute hospitals. Average length of stay decreased for both public acute and <b>private</b> <b>hospitals,</b> with increasing numbers of separations occurring on a same day basis. Increasing proportions of procedures were undertaken during same day stays, and in <b>private</b> <b>hospitals.</b> Separation rates varied geographically, with highest rates overall, and for public hospitals and overnight separations, for patients resident in remote centres and other remote areas. Highest rates for <b>private</b> <b>hospitals</b> were for patients resident in capital cities, other metropolitan centres and large rural centres...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. As it is known, {{following}} health reforms {{realized in}} Turkey {{over the course}} of last several years the patients, who have social security, have started to benefit from <b>private</b> <b>hospitals.</b> How they are satisfied from the services given by <b>private</b> <b>hospitals</b> thus becomes an important issue. It is evident {{that more than half of}} <b>private</b> <b>hospitals</b> along the country are found in Istanbul. This leads, eventually, to a high level of competition among <b>private</b> <b>hospitals</b> in the level of Istanbul. It is a matter of fact that the customer satisfaction plays important role in the competition among <b>private</b> <b>hospitals</b> more than ever before in this city.

5|$|Oxford United had no regular {{home until}} 1913, {{switching}} between the Quarry Recreation Ground, Wootten's Field, Sandy Lane and Britannia Field, all in Headington. In 1913 {{they were able}} to purchase Wootten's Field on London Road, however, this was redeveloped in 1920 before a stadium could be built. Having purchased the Sandy Lane site, the club developed and played at the Manor Ground between 1925 and 2001. The ground was originally shared with Headington Cricket Club until 1949, when they moved to Cowley Barracks. The capacity at closure was 9,500, but hosted United's record crowd of 22,750 against Preston North End in an FA Cup sixth-round match on 29 February 1964. The four stands were named after the roads they were positioned on: The North, East, South and West stands were called Cuckoo Lane, Osler Road, London Road and Beech Road respectively. In the 1990s, the Taylor Report was published calling for the improvement of football stadiums. The Manor Ground's terracing was becoming redundant and redeveloping the ground was too costly, so the club decided to move to a purpose-built all-seater stadium {{on the outskirts of the}} city, costing in the region of £15 million. Construction work began in the early part of 1997, but was suspended later that year due to the club's financial problems. Construction of the new stadium resumed in 1999 following a takeover deal and the last league match at the Manor on 1 May 2001 saw a 1–1 draw with Port Vale. The site was sold for £12 million and the stadium was later demolished. The land is now occupied by a <b>private</b> <b>hospital.</b>|$|E
