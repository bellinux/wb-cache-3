Historically, {{the duties of the}} <b>president</b> <b>have</b> been both formal and social. The Cruelty to Animals Act 1876 left the president {{as one of the few}} individuals capable of certifying that a particular experiment on an animal was justified. In addition, the president is to act as the government's chief (albeit informal) advisor on scientific matters. Yet another task is that of entertaining distinguished foreign guests and scientists.|$|E

5|$|The Presidential Council for Minority Rights (PCMR) is a non-elected {{government}} body in Singapore established in 1970, the main function {{of which is}} to scrutinize most of the bills passed by Parliament to ensure that they do not discriminate against any racial or religious community. If the Council feels that any provision in a bill amounts to a differentiating measure, it will report its findings to Parliament and refer the bill back to Parliament for reconsideration. The Council also examines subsidiary legislation and statutes in force on 9 January 1970. One member of the PCMR is nominated by the Chairman to the Presidential Elections Committee, which is empowered to ensure that candidates for the office of <b>President</b> <b>have</b> the qualifications required by the Constitution. The President also appoints and dismisses the chairman and members of the Presidential Council for Religious Harmony ("PCRH"), established by the , on the advice of the PCMR, and the PCMR is responsible for determining whether PCRH members who are not representatives of major religions in Singapore have distinguished themselves in public service or community relations in Singapore.|$|E

25|$|After careful consideration, {{including}} {{a review of}} my recommendation, the <b>President</b> <b>has</b> concluded that given a number of factors, {{including a}} documented history of discrimination, classifications based on sexual orientation {{should be subject to}} a more heightened standard of scrutiny. The <b>President</b> <b>has</b> also concluded that Section 3 of DOMA, as applied to legally married same-sex couples, fails to meet that standard and is therefore unconstitutional.

25|$|During the Sri Lankan Civil War, {{multiple}} Human Rights Organizations {{have reported}} cases of rape, violence and disappearance {{of women in the}} 1990s, claiming to be committed by security forces. Amnesty International, for instance, believes that these actions might have been just a fraction of a widespread violence, claiming that many women have avoided giving testimony about the forces' treatment. Government officials, including the <b>president,</b> <b>have</b> denied the claims and agreed to co-operate with the investigations and prosecute whomever they find guilty. The UN Special Rapporteur, on the other hand, have reported that individual investigations and proceedings relating to these cases have started at the local magistrates courts.|$|E
25|$|By this time, Maeser {{had to be}} {{replaced}} as president by the Board of Trustees. He had been called to oversee the entire LDS education program, {{and was unable to}} do both jobs. The Board's initial choice was the twenty-seven-year-old James E. Talmage, but before they could extend the invitation, he was hired by LDS College in Salt Lake City. They instead chose a recent graduate of the University of Michigan, Benjamin Cluff, Jr.. Cluff's methods as <b>president</b> <b>have</b> been described as nearly opposite those of Maeser. Maeser was insular and conservative in his teaching methods. He kept his teachings well within the LDS world, and adhered to classical education standards. Cluff was more open to new ideas and methods. He also believed that the world outside Mormonism had a lot to offer the school.|$|E
500|$|Kennedy was a stalwart backer of President Clinton {{during the}} 1998 Lewinsky scandal, often trying to cheer up the {{president}} {{when he was}} gloomiest and getting him to add past Kennedy staffer Greg Craig to his defense team, which helped improve the president's fortunes. In the trial after the 1999 impeachment of Bill Clinton, Kennedy voted to acquit Clinton on both charges, saying [...] "Republicans in the House of Representatives, in their partisan vendetta against the <b>President,</b> <b>have</b> wielded the impeachment power in precisely the way the framers rejected, recklessly and without regard for the Constitution or {{the will of the}} American people." ...|$|E

[...] Coolidge was aware of his stiff reputation; indeed, he cultivated it. [...] "I think the American people want a solemn ass as a President," [...] he once told Ethel Barrymore, [...] "and I think I will go along with them." [...] Some historians would later suggest that Coolidge's image was created deliberately as a campaign tactic, while others believe his withdrawn and quiet behavior to be natural, deepening {{after the death of his}} son in 1924.|$|E

2500|$|In the {{instance}} {{when the}} Presidency and both Houses of Congress {{are controlled by}} one party, the Speaker normally assumes a lower profile and defers to the President. For that situation the House Minority Leader can {{play the role of}} a de facto [...] "leader of the opposition", often more so than the Senate Minority Leader, due to the more partisan nature of the House and the greater role of leadership.

2500|$|The {{constitutional}} [...] "national intervention" [...] and [...] "state of siege" [...] {{powers of}} the <b>president</b> <b>have</b> been invoked frequently. The first of these powers was designed to [...] "guarantee the republican form of government in the provinces." [...] Since {{the adoption of the}} 1853 constitution, the federal government has intervened over 200 times, mostly by presidential decree. Under this authority, provincial and municipal offices may be declared vacant, appointments annulled, and local elections supervised. Between 1966 and 1973, all local legislatures were dissolved and provincial governors were appointed by the new president. A restoration of provincial and municipal government followed the return to constitutional government in 1973. After the March 1976 coup, the federal government again intervened to remove all provincial governors and impose direct military rule over all municipalities. Since 1983, representative local government has been in force again.|$|E
2500|$|Several glowing appraisals of Lee's {{tenure as}} college <b>president</b> <b>have</b> survived, {{depicting}} {{the dignity and}} respect he commanded among all. Previously, most students had been obliged to occupy the campus dormitories, while only the most mature were allowed to live off-campus. Lee quickly reversed this rule, requiring most students to board off-campus, and allowing only the most mature {{to live in the}} dorms as a mark of privilege; the results of this policy were considered a success. A typical account by a professor there states that [...] "the students fairly worshipped him, and deeply dreaded his displeasure; yet so kind, affable, and gentle was he toward them that all loved to approach him. ... No student would have dared to violate General Lee's expressed wish or appeal; if he had done so, the students themselves would have driven him from the college." ...|$|E

2500|$|Indians in {{the eastern}} lowland {{department}} of Santa Cruz have also become active in the recent disputes over nationalization of the gas and oil industry. They are composed of indigenous {{groups such as the}} Guaraní, Ayoreo, Chiquitano and the Guyarayos, as opposed to the highland Indians (Aymara and Quechua). They have been active in recent land disputes and the main organization representing this faction is known as the [...] "Confederacion de pueblos indigenas de Bolivia" [...] (CIDOB). The CIDOB after initially offering support to MAS, the party of Bolivia's new <b>president,</b> <b>have</b> come to believe that they were deceived by the Bolivian government. [...] The MAS, which is based in the highlands, is no more willing to grant them voice than the previous governments whose power was also based from the highlands. Another smaller more radical group called the [...] "Landless Peasant Movement" [...] (MST) which is somewhat similar to the Landless Workers' Movement in Brazil, and is composed mainly of immigrants from {{the western part of the}} country. Recently, Guaraní Indians from this group have taken oil fields run by Spain's Repsol YPF and the United Kingdom's BP and have forced them to stop production.|$|E

How many people in the Congress of the United States do you think are anti-American? You've already suspected Barack Obama, is he alone or are there others?" [...] Bachmann answered, [...] "What I would say is that the news media should do a penetrating exposé and take a look... I wish they would...
