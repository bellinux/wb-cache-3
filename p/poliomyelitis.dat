5|$|A rare {{condition}} {{with a similar}} presentation, nonpoliovirus <b>poliomyelitis,</b> may result from infections with nonpoliovirus enteroviruses.|$|E
5|$|As a {{precaution}} against infection, public swimming pools were often closed in affected areas during <b>poliomyelitis</b> epidemics.|$|E
5|$|Because {{the oral}} polio vaccine is inexpensive, easy to administer, and {{produces}} excellent immunity in the intestine (which helps prevent infection with wild virus in areas where it is endemic), {{it has been the}} vaccine of choice for controlling <b>poliomyelitis</b> in many countries. On very rare occasions (about one case per 750,000 vaccine recipients), the attenuated virus in the {{oral polio vaccine}} reverts into a form that can paralyze. Most industrialized countries have switched to inactivated polio vaccine, which cannot revert, either as the sole vaccine against <b>poliomyelitis</b> or in combination with oral polio vaccine.|$|E
5|$|Many {{cases of}} <b>poliomyelitis</b> result in only {{temporary}} paralysis. Nerve impulses {{return to the}} formerly paralyzed muscle within a month, and recovery is usually complete in six to eight months. The neurophysiological processes involved in recovery following acute paralytic <b>poliomyelitis</b> are quite effective; muscles are able to retain normal strength even if half the original motor neurons have been lost. Paralysis remaining after one year {{is likely to be}} permanent, although modest recoveries of muscle strength are possible 12 to 18 months after infection.|$|E
5|$|Poliovirus, the causative {{agent of}} <b>poliomyelitis</b> (commonly known as polio), {{is a human}} {{enterovirus}} {{and member of the}} family of Picornaviridae.|$|E
5|$|This {{is a list}} of notable {{people who}} have survived the {{infectious}} disease <b>poliomyelitis.</b> <b>Poliomyelitis</b> (often simply called polio) is an acute viral infection that involves the gastrointestinal tract and occasionally the central nervous system. Poliovirus is acquired by faecal-oral or oral transmission. Prior to the introduction of a vaccine in 1955, infection was common, with epidemics during the summer and autumn of temperate countries. An eradication programme has reduced the number of reported polio cases worldwide by more than 99% since the mid-1980s. Most infections are asymptomatic; a small number cause a minor illness that is indistinguishable from many other viral illnesses; less than 1% result in acute flaccid paralysis. The extent of paralysis varies from part of a limb to quadriplegia and respiratory failure. The latter was often treated with an iron lung until, it was hoped, the patient recovered. Around 30–40 years after contracting paralytic <b>poliomyelitis,</b> about 25–40% of cases lead to post-polio syndrome. Symptoms include muscle pain, further weakening of muscles and paralysis.|$|E
5|$|Although {{humans are}} the only known natural hosts of poliovirus, monkeys can be {{experimentally}} infected and they have long been used to study poliovirus. In 1990–91, a small animal model of <b>poliomyelitis</b> was developed by two laboratories. Mice were engineered to express a human receptor to poliovirus (hPVR).|$|E
5|$|In 1929 Rhoads {{joined the}} staff of the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research, now Rockefeller University, where he worked for Simon Flexner. He was also staff {{pathologist}} at Rockefeller Hospital. His early research interests included hematology and <b>poliomyelitis.</b> He worked at Rockefeller until 1939.|$|E
5|$|On 27 March 2014 the WHO {{announced}} {{the eradication of}} <b>poliomyelitis</b> in the South-East Asia Region, which includes eleven countries: Bangladesh, Bhutan, North Korea, India, Indonesia, Maldives, Myanmar, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Timor-Leste. With the addition of this region, 80 per cent of the world population lives in polio-free regions.|$|E
5|$|Paralytic <b>poliomyelitis</b> may be {{clinically}} suspected {{in individuals}} experiencing acute onset of flaccid paralysis {{in one or}} more limbs with decreased or absent tendon reflexes in the affected limbs that cannot be attributed to another apparent cause, and without sensory or cognitive loss.|$|E
5|$|The Leigh Hospital Board bought Damhouse in 1893 {{for use as}} a {{sanatorium}} {{dealing with}} cases of diphtheria, scarlet fever and, in 1947, <b>poliomyelitis.</b> Two bombs fell close to the hospital during the Second World War. It became a general hospital in 1948 dealing with chronically ill and geriatric patients and closed in 1994.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of two polio vaccines {{led to the}} first modern mass inoculations. The last cases of paralytic <b>poliomyelitis</b> caused by endemic transmission of wild virus in the United States occurred in 1979, with an outbreak among the Amish in several Midwest states.|$|E
5|$|Hence, {{weakness}} of shrug {{on one side}} and head-turning on the other side may indicate damage to the accessory nerve {{on the side of the}} shrug weakness, or damage along the nerve pathway at the other side of the brain. Causes of damage may include trauma, surgery, tumours, and compression at the jugular foramen. Weakness in both muscles may point to a more general disease process such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Guillain-Barre syndrome or <b>poliomyelitis.</b>|$|E
5|$|In around 1 {{percent of}} infections, {{poliovirus}} spreads along certain nerve fiber pathways, preferentially replicating in and destroying motor neurons within the spinal cord, brain stem, or motor cortex. This {{leads to the}} development of paralytic <b>poliomyelitis,</b> the various forms of which (spinal, bulbar, and bulbospinal) vary only with the amount of neuronal damage and inflammation that occurs, and the region of the CNS affected.|$|E
5|$|Polio {{vaccines}} are vaccines used {{to prevent}} <b>poliomyelitis</b> (polio). There are two types: one that uses inactivated poliovirus and is given by injection (IPV), and one that uses weakened poliovirus and is given by mouth (OPV). The World Health Organization recommends all children be fully vaccinated against polio. The two vaccines have eliminated polio {{from most of the}} world, and reduced the number of cases reported each year from an estimated 350,000 in 1988 to 37 in 2016.|$|E
5|$|The inactivated polio {{vaccines}} {{are very}} safe. Mild redness or pain may {{occur at the}} site of injection. Oral polio vaccines cause about three cases of vaccine-associated paralytic <b>poliomyelitis</b> per million doses given. This compares with one in two hundred who are paralysed following a polio infection. Both are generally safe to give during pregnancy and in those who have HIV/AIDS but are otherwise well.|$|E
5|$|Cerebrospinal fluid envelops {{the brain}} and the spine, and lumbar {{puncture}} or spinal tap is the removal of {{a small amount of}} fluid using a needle inserted between the lumbar vertebrae. Characteristic findings in Guillain–Barré syndrome are an elevated protein level, usually greater than 0.55g/L, and fewer than 10 white blood cells per cubic millimeter of fluid ("albuminocytological dissociation"). This combination distinguishes Guillain–Barré syndrome from other conditions (such as lymphoma and <b>poliomyelitis)</b> in which both the protein and the cell count are elevated. Elevated CSF protein levels are found in approximately 50% of patients in the first 3 days after onset of weakness, which increases to 80% after the first week.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{widespread}} use of poliovirus vaccine in the mid-1950s, the incidence of <b>poliomyelitis</b> declined dramatically in many industrialized countries. A global effort to eradicate polio began in 1988, led by the World Health Organization, UNICEF, and The Rotary Foundation. These efforts have reduced the number of annual diagnosed cases by 99.9 percent; from an estimated 350,000 cases in 1988 to a low of 483 cases in 2001, after which it remained at a level of about 1,000 - 2000 cases per year for a number of years. In 2015, cases decreased to 98 and further decreased in 2016 to 37 wild cases and 5 circulating vaccine-derived cases.|$|E
5|$|In 1871, the German surgeon Friedrich Trendelenburg (1844–1924) {{published}} a paper describing {{the first successful}} elective human tracheotomy to be performed {{for the purpose of}} administration of general anesthesia. In 1888, Sir Morell Mackenzie (1837–1892) {{published a}} book discussing the indications for tracheotomy. In the early 20th century, tracheotomy became a life-saving treatment for patients afflicted with paralytic <b>poliomyelitis</b> who required mechanical ventilation. In 1909, Philadelphia laryngologist Chevalier Jackson (1865–1958) described a technique for tracheotomy that is used to this day.|$|E
5|$|In 1961, type 1 and 2 {{monovalent}} oral poliovirus vaccine (MOPV) was licensed, and in 1962, type 3 MOPV was licensed. In 1963, trivalent OPV (TOPV) was licensed, {{and became}} the vaccine of choice in the United States and most other countries of the world, largely replacing the inactivated polio vaccine. A second wave of mass immunizations led to a further dramatic {{decline in the number}} of polio cases. Between 1962 and 1965 about 100 million Americans (roughly 56% of the population at that time) received the Sabin vaccine. The result was a substantial reduction in the number of <b>poliomyelitis</b> cases, even from the much reduced levels following the introduction of the Salk vaccine.|$|E
5|$|In mid-1921, Howe was vacationing {{with the}} Roosevelts at Campobello Island when Franklin {{began to run}} a high fever and {{reported}} paralysis in his legs. A doctor was sent for, and Roosevelt was diagnosed with <b>poliomyelitis.</b> Howe remained by Roosevelt's bedside throughout {{the early days of}} his illness, cheering him up, tending to his needs, and even changing his bedpans. By September of that year, Howe had been formally invited to join the Roosevelt household, and began visiting his own family only on weekends.|$|E
5|$|<b>Poliomyelitis</b> {{has existed}} for {{thousands}} of years, with depictions of the disease in ancient art. The disease was first recognized as a distinct condition by Michael Underwood in 1789 and {{the virus that causes}} it was first identified in 1908 by Karl Landsteiner. Major outbreaks started to occur in the late 19th century in Europe and the United States. In the 20th century it {{became one of the most}} worrying childhood diseases in these areas. The first polio vaccine was developed in the 1950s by Jonas Salk. It is hoped that vaccination efforts and early detection of cases will result in global eradication of the disease by 2018.|$|E
5|$|<b>Poliomyelitis</b> is {{a disease}} of the central nervous system. However, CD155 is {{believed}} to be present on the surface of most or all human cells. Therefore, receptor expression does not explain why poliovirus preferentially infects certain tissues. This suggests that tissue tropism is determined after cellular infection. Recent work has suggested that the type I interferon response (specifically that of interferon alpha and beta) is an important factor that defines which types of cells support poliovirus replication. In mice expressing CD155 (through genetic engineering) but lacking the type I interferon receptor, poliovirus not only replicates in an expanded repertoire of tissue types, but these mice are also able to be infected orally with the virus.|$|E
5|$|Unlike normal mice, {{transgenic}} poliovirus receptor (TgPVR) mice {{are susceptible}} to poliovirus injected intravenously or intramuscularly, and when injected directly into the spinal cord or the brain. Upon infection, TgPVR mice show signs of paralysis that resemble those of <b>poliomyelitis</b> in humans and monkeys, and the central nervous systems of paralyzed mice are histocytochemically {{similar to those of}} humans and monkeys. This mouse model of human poliovirus infection has proven to be an invaluable tool in understanding poliovirus biology and pathogenicity.|$|E
5|$|Although {{poliovirus}} transmission {{has been}} interrupted {{in much of}} the world, transmission of wild poliovirus does continue and creates an ongoing risk for the importation of wild poliovirus into previously polio-free regions. If importations of poliovirus occur, outbreaks of <b>poliomyelitis</b> may develop, especially in areas with low vaccination coverage and poor sanitation. As a result, high levels of vaccination coverage must be maintained. In November 2013, the World Health Organization announced a polio outbreak in Syria. In response, the Armenian government put out a notice asking Syrian Armenians under age 15 to get the polio vaccine. As of 2014, polio virus has spread out to ten countries mainly in Africa, Asia and the Middle East with Pakistan, Syria and Cameroon advising vaccinations to outbound travelers.|$|E
5|$|Louis Pasteur and Edward Jenner {{were the}} first to develop {{vaccines}} to protect against viral infections. The nature of viruses remained unknown until the invention of the electron microscope in the 1930s, when the science of virology gained momentum. In the 20th century many diseases both old and new were found to be caused by viruses. There were epidemics of <b>poliomyelitis</b> that were only controlled following the development of a vaccine in the 1950s. HIV {{is one of the most}} pathogenic new viruses to have emerged in centuries. Although scientific interest in them arose because of the diseases they cause, most viruses are beneficial. They drive evolution by transferring genes across species, play important roles in ecosystems and are essential to life.|$|E
5|$|<b>Poliomyelitis</b> {{is caused}} by {{infection}} {{with a member of}} the genus Enterovirus known as poliovirus (PV). This group of RNA viruses colonize the gastrointestinal tract — specifically the oropharynx and the intestine. The incubation time (to the first signs and symptoms) ranges from three to 35 days, with a more common span of six to 20 days. PV infects and causes disease in humans alone. Its structure is very simple, composed of a single (+) sense RNA genome enclosed in a protein shell called a capsid. In addition to protecting the virus’s genetic material, the capsid proteins enable poliovirus to infect certain types of cells. Three serotypes of poliovirus have been identified—poliovirus type 1 (PV1), type 2 (PV2), and type 3 (PV3)—each with a slightly different capsid protein. All three are extremely virulent and produce the same disease symptoms. PV1 is the most commonly encountered form, and the one most closely associated with paralysis.|$|E
5|$|<b>Poliomyelitis</b> {{is highly}} {{contagious}} via the fecal-oral (intestinal source) and the oral-oral (oropharyngeal source) routes. In endemic areas, wild polioviruses can infect {{virtually the entire}} human population. It is seasonal in temperate climates, with peak transmission occurring in summer and autumn. These seasonal differences are far less pronounced in tropical areas. The time between first exposure and first symptoms, known as the incubation period, is usually 6 to 20days, with a maximum range of 3 to 35days. Virus particles are excreted in the feces for several weeks following initial infection. The disease is transmitted primarily via the fecal-oral route, by ingesting contaminated food or water. It is occasionally transmitted via the oral-oral route, a mode especially visible in areas with good sanitation and hygiene. Polio is most infectious between 7 and 10 days {{before and after the}} appearance of symptoms, but transmission is possible as long as the virus remains in the saliva or feces.|$|E
5|$|Some {{cases may}} be {{triggered}} by the influenza virus and potentially influenza vaccine. An increased incidence of Guillain–Barré syndrome followed influenza immunization that followed the 1976 swine flu outbreak (H1N1A/NJ/76); 8.8 cases per million recipients developed the complication. Since then, close monitoring of cases attributable to vaccination has demonstrated that influenza itself can induce GBS. Small increases in incidence have been observed in subsequent vaccination campaigns, {{but not to the}} same extent. The 2009 flu pandemic vaccine (against pandemic swine flu virus H1N1/PDM09) did not cause a significant increase in cases. It is considered that the benefits of vaccination in preventing influenza outweigh the small risks of GBS after vaccination. Even those who have previously experienced Guillain–Barré syndrome are considered safe to receive the vaccine in the future. Other vaccines, such as those against <b>poliomyelitis,</b> tetanus or measles, have not been associated with a risk of GBS.|$|E
5|$|Spinal polio, {{the most}} common form of paralytic <b>poliomyelitis,</b> results from viral {{invasion}} of the motor neurons of the anterior horn cells, or the ventral (front) grey matter section in the spinal column, which are responsible for movement of the muscles, including those of the trunk, limbs, and the intercostal muscles. Virus invasion causes inflammation of the nerve cells, leading to damage or destruction of motor neuron ganglia. When spinal neurons die, Wallerian degeneration takes place, leading to weakness of those muscles formerly innervated by the now-dead neurons. With the destruction of nerve cells, the muscles no longer receive signals from the brain or spinal cord; without nerve stimulation, the muscles atrophy, becoming weak, floppy and poorly controlled, and finally completely paralyzed. Maximum paralysis progresses rapidly (two to four days), and usually involves fever and muscle pain. Deep tendon reflexes are also affected, and are typically absent or diminished; sensation (the ability to feel) in the paralyzed limbs, however, is not affected.|$|E
5|$|The first {{polio vaccine}} was the inactivated polio vaccine. It was {{developed}} by Jonas Salk and came into use in 1955. The oral polio vaccine {{was developed by}} Albert Sabin and came into commercial use in 1961. They are on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, {{the most effective and}} safe medicines needed in a health system. Clinical disease, including paralysis, caused by vaccine-derived poliovirus (VDPV) is indistinguishable from that caused by wild polioviruses. This is believed to be a rare event, but outbreaks of vaccine-associated paralytic <b>poliomyelitis</b> (VAPP), caused by a circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV), have been reported, and tend to occur in areas of low coverage by OPV, presumably because the OPV is itself protective against the related outbreak strain.|$|E
5|$|During {{the race}} to develop an oral polio vaccine several large scale human trials were undertaken. By 1958, the National Institutes of Health had {{determined}} that OPV produced using the Sabin strains were the safest. Between 1957 and 1960, however, Hilary Koprowski continued to administer his vaccine around the world. In Africa, the vaccines were administered to roughly one {{million people in the}} Belgian territories (now the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Rwanda and Burundi). The results of these human trials have been controversial, and unfounded accusations in the 1990s arose that the vaccine had created the conditions necessary for transmission of SIV from chimpanzees to humans, causing HIV/AIDS. These hypotheses have, however, have been conclusively refuted. By 2004, cases of <b>poliomyelitis</b> in Africa had been reduced to just a small number of isolated regions in the western portion of the continent, with sporadic cases elsewhere. Recent local opposition to vaccination campaigns have evolved due to lack of adequate information, often relating to fears that the vaccine might induce sterility. The disease has since resurged in Nigeria and in several other African nations without necessary information, which epidemiologists believe is due to refusals by certain local populations to allow their children to receive the polio vaccine.|$|E
5|$|Insects {{have been}} used medicinally in {{cultures}} around the world, often according to the Doctrine of Signatures. Thus, the femurs of grasshoppers, which were said to resemble the human liver, were used to treat liver ailments by the indigenous peoples of Mexico. The doctrine was applied in both Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) and in Ayurveda. TCM uses arthropods for various purposes; for example, centipede is used to treat tetanus, seizures, and convulsions, while the Chinese Black Mountain Ant, Polyrhachis vicina, {{is used as a}} cure all, especially by the elderly, and extracts have been examined as a possible anti-cancer agent. Ayurveda uses insects such as Termite for conditions such as ulcers, rheumatic diseases, anaemia, and pain. The Jatropha leaf miner's larvae are used boiled to induce lactation, reduce fever, and soothe the gastrointestinal tract. In contrast, the traditional insect medicine of Africa is local and unformalised. The indigenous peoples of Central America used a wide variety of insects medicinally. Mayans used Army ant soldiers as living sutures. The venom of the Red harvester ant was used to cure rheumatism, arthritis, and <b>poliomyelitis</b> via the immune reaction produced by its sting. Boiled silkworm pupae were taken to treat apoplexy, aphasy, bronchitis, pneumonia, convulsions, haemorrhages, and frequent urination.|$|E
5|$|<b>Poliomyelitis,</b> {{often called}} polio or {{infantile}} paralysis, is an infectious disease {{caused by the}} poliovirus. In about 0.5 percent of cases there is muscle weakness resulting in an inability to move. This can occur over {{a few hours to}} a few days. The weakness most often involves the legs but may less commonly involve the muscles of the head, neck and diaphragm. Many but not all people fully recover. In those with muscle weakness about 2 to 5 percent of children and 15 to 30 percent of adults die. Another 25 percent of people have minor symptoms such as fever and a sore throat and up to 5 percent have headache, neck stiffness and pains in the arms and legs. These people are usually back to normal within one or two weeks. In up to 70 percent of infections there are no symptoms. Years after recovery post-polio syndrome may occur, with a slow development of muscle weakness similar to that which the person had during the initial infection.|$|E
25|$|Epidemic neuromyasthenia: a {{term used}} for {{outbreaks}} with symptoms resembling <b>poliomyelitis.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Ministers {{for health}} of Niger, Nigeria, Egypt, Burkina Faso, Côte d'Ivoire, the Central African Republic, Sudan and Chad met on 13 January 2005 in Geneva in the {{headquarters}} of the World Health Organization. They decided to organize a series of vaccination campaigns against <b>poliomyelitis</b> and to reinforce epidemiologic monitoring. In 2004, the number of African children infected by <b>poliomyelitis</b> doubled to 1.037.|$|E
