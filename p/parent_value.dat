50|$|In Kenya, {{there is}} an {{organism}} called septoria tritici blotch (STB) that diminishes yield in wheat crop. The parent species of wheat had little resistance toward STB, but the hybrid species due to transgressive segregation showed a higher resistance toward STB and therefore a higher fitness. You can create a higher resistance to STB by crossing genes together that are efficient. In result, out of 36 crosses there were 31 that showed a higher mean fitness than the control, <b>parent</b> <b>value.</b> These 31 crosses indicate a higher resistance to STB. The crosses used were from other commercial wheat's that were high yielding which is advantageous {{because there is a}} lower chance of deleterious (unwanted traits) appearing and therefore an increase in beneficial traits. Transgressive segregation {{has been found to be}} useful to create a resistance toward this organism in order to increase the yield of wheat crop.|$|E
40|$|Purpose - Brand {{extension}} {{attitude is}} a key antecedent of consumers' reciprocal evaluations of parent brand equity. Traditionally, the link from brand extension attitude to change in parent brand equity is modeled as a direct path, potentially obfuscating any underlying processes. The current research aims to propose {{that the impact of}} brand extension attitude on change in parent brand equity materializes via change in <b>parent</b> <b>value</b> equity perceptions of a parent brand. Design/methodology/approach - A conceptual model is developed, positioning change in <b>parent</b> <b>value</b> equity as a mediator of the effect of brand extension attitude. The model is estimated on a sample of 888 Australian consumers using a cross-sectional self-administered survey. Drawing upon actual industry dynamics, a hypothetical scenario of Australian supermarkets extending into the banking sector is used as stimulus. Findings - The research model demonstrates acceptable fit to data, confirming most hypotheses. Change in <b>parent</b> <b>value</b> equity mediates the effect of brand extension attitude on change in parent brand equity. Rival model comparisons, however, reveal that a partial mediation scenario better represents feedback effects. The research model is suitably modified to include an additional path. Practical implications - The current study broadens the scope of brand extension feedback effects from parent brand equity to additionally include <b>parent</b> <b>value</b> equity. Practitioners can now envision brand extensions as simultaneously impacting multiple facets of a parent brand, not previously considered. Originality/value - The current research explicates an underlying process of how consumers' extension-derived attitudes are converted into revised parent brand equity evaluations. Such an insight is novel in the literature. No Full Tex...|$|E

40|$|Intergenerational value {{transmission}} {{plays an}} important role in child socialization. Although much research has been done on parent to child value teaching, there is little research on grandparent to grandchild value teaching. The purpose of this study was to explore parent and grandparent value teaching and how it relates to young adult generativity, identity development, and adjustment. This study involved 100 young adults, between the ages of 25 to 29 with a mean age of 26, taken from a longitudinal sample of participants in 2006. Participants were asked to tell parent and grandparent value teaching stories, in which they described a time that their parents and grandparents taught them the importance of a value. These stories were coded for story presence, degree of interactiveness, whether the parent or grandparent served as a positive or negative model of the chosen value, and the use of parent or grandparent quoted voice. Participants completed questionnaire measures of generativity and identity, and measures of loneliness, trust, and dispositional optimism, which are standard measures of adjustment. All participants were able to recount a <b>parent</b> <b>value</b> teaching story, and the majority of participants were able to recount a grandparent value teaching story. The results indicated that young adult grandparent to grandchild value socialization was done mostly by grandmothers, and the value tended to be taught indirectly. <b>Parent</b> <b>value</b> socialization appears to be shared between parents and taught by direct interaction. Furthermore, being able to tell a grandparent value teaching story positively predicted young adult generativity, and negatively predicted young adult loneliness. The construal of a parent as a positive model of the chosen value positively predicted young adult dispositional optimism. Finally, telling an interactive grandparent value teaching story positively predicted young adult generativity.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to better {{understand}} value development in an emerging adult, college student population, and to further define, identify and clarify family characteristics that influence values. Theories have sought to examine the developmental influences in emerging adulthood, but little research exists examining the role of the family, particularly in regards to value development. The current study reviewed the literature on emerging adulthood, values, and self-determination theory with attention to family influence. Questions addressed in this study included: 1) are perceived <b>parent</b> <b>values</b> predictors of emerging adult values, 2) will the quality of communication between parents and emerging adults and the presence of an emotionally supportive relationship with both mother and father moderate the relationship between the perception of <b>parent</b> <b>values</b> and emerging adult values, and 3) does the family environment influence the types of values emerging adults perceive to be important to their parents? For this purpose, 200 college students completed 5 different self-report questionnaires measuring the constructs of <b>values,</b> perceived <b>parent</b> <b>values,</b> family environment variables, family communication variables, and quality of relationship with both father and mother. Parents of college students completed a self-report questionnaire measuring their socialization values for their children and a questionnaire measuring family communication; however, the small number of parent responses prevented the data from being used in statistical tests. Multiple regression analyses indicated that perceived <b>parent</b> <b>values</b> predicted emerging adult values. Moderation analyses showed that family communication and the quality of the relationship with father and mother did not strengthen the relationship between perceived <b>parent</b> <b>values</b> and emerging adult values. Lastly, a warm family environment and family activities were significantly related to how important emerging adults’ perceived intrinsic values to be to both their father and mother. Family structure was significantly positively correlated the importance emerging adults’ perceived their fathers to place on extrinsic values, but not their mothers.

40|$|Thesis (Ed. D.) [...] Boston UniversityDespite {{evidence}} {{in the field of}} early childhood education that play has {{an important role in the}} lives of young children, child-initiated play is disappearing from preschool (Alliance for Childhood, 2009; Hirsh-Pasek, Golinkoff, Berk & Singer, 2009; Singer, Golinkoff & Hirsh-Pasek, 2006; Singer, Singer, D'Agostino & DeLong, 2006). The National Research Council (2001) suggested that the departure of play from early childhood curricula could be due to the fact that play is not considered to have educational value. However, little is known about the value parents place on the role of play in their child's education. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate parents' value of play, learning, and development in preschool. The <b>Parent</b> <b>Value</b> of Preschool Activity (PVPA) survey was designed for this study to measure parents' values. The instrument development process utilized the feedback of identified experts who contributed to an expert review, and parents who participated in an understandability study. Evidence suggested that the PVPA survey is valid and reliable. The PVPA survey (n= 94) and an interview protocol (n= 6) were used to analyze the variance of parent values. Parents categorized all PVPA survey items as both play and learning and also categorized all items as cognitive. However, data suggested that although parents consider cognitive learning and development important in preschool, social learning and development is the most valued. Importantly, parents were found to have a rich understanding of the complex relationship between play, learning, and development and could therefore provide an influential voice in support of play in preschool. Evidence collected also revealed that there was a significant difference between mothers' value of play and fathers' value of play. More information could be provided to parents as to how play activities and experiences are integrated into children's cognitive, physical, social, and emotional learning and development. Finally, the field of early childhood education should recognize that parents highly value play, learning, and development in preschool and should therefore provide another voice to support that play has a prominent place in early childhood curricula...|$|E

Authors: Tracey Ledoux, PhD, RD 1, 2, Kathy Watson, PhD 2, Janice Baranowski, MPH, RD 2, 2 ̆ 6 Tom Baranowski, PhD 2 Affiliations: 1 Health and Human Performance Department, University of Houston; Children’s Nutrition Research Center, USDA/ARS, Baylor College of Medicine. Purpose: To {{test the}} moderating effect of <b>parent</b> <b>value</b> for health (PVH) and {{mediating}} effects {{of fruit and}} vegetable (FV) availability, FV accessibility, child asking behavior (CAB), and FV preference changes {{on the relationship between}} program dose and change in FV consumption from an intervention that increased FV consumption among middle school aged Boy Scouts. Methods: 233 10 - 14 year old Boy Scouts were recruited from 42 troops randomly assigned to intervention or control. Intervention: Weekly troop meetings and Internet activities over 9 -weeks aimed at increasing home FV availability and accessibility through CAB; increasing FV preference through troop taste testings and recipe preparation homework assignments completed with parents. Control: “mirror image” physical activity intervention (Jago et al., 2006). Measures: FV consumption and preference collected pre and post by the Scout; FV availability, FV accessibility, CAB, and PVH were collected post by the parent. Number of recipes prepared, website log-on rate, and number of meetings attended created a program dose factor score. Statistical Analyses: Mediation and moderation were tested with structural equation modeling (SEM) to assess goodness of fit of two models (Model 1 : change in F consumption, and Model 2 : change in V consumption) among two groups (Scouts with parents of low PVH and those with parents of high PVH). Results: Model 1, X 2 (N= 233, df= 20) = 21. 99; p=. 34; CFI=. 99, RMSEA=. 03, and Model 2, X 2 (N= 233, df= 20) = 19. 41; p=. 50; CFI= 1. 00; RMSEA= 3 ̆c. 001, demonstrated good fit for the data. Weak evidence PVH moderated the program dose and change in F consumption (Model 1) and V consumption (Model 2) relationships. Model 1 : In the high PVH group, program dose was related to CAB (r=. 19), and accessibility (r =-. 24) and preferences (r=. 32) were related to change in F consumption; in the low PVH group, preference only was related to change in F consumption (r=. 24). Model 2 : In the high PVH group, program dose was related to CAB (r=. 19), and preferences were related to change in V consumption (r=. 35); in the low PVH group, preferences only were related to change in V consumption (r=. 25). No relationship between dose and change in F or V consumption. Conclusions: PVH may moderate effects of intervention dose on change in FV intake; however, more research is needed with larger samples. Associations were detected among variables in each model, suggesting possible mechanisms for change of FV intake; however, no variables served as mediators between intervention dose and change in F or V intake leaving questions about how the intervention led to changes in FV intake.

It seeks to determine the interrelationships between conservative Protestant <b>Parent</b> <b>Values</b> (<b>Parent</b> Rural <b>Values</b> and <b>Parent</b> Religiosity), Parent Involvement, and Student Outcomes. For the mixed-methods study, mail-administered Parent and Student Surveys provide quantitative data. Interviews, document analysis, and participant-observer field notes are utilized to supplement statistical findings. Ten Research Questions reflect Demographic Factors (Socioeconomic Status, Family Structure, and Specifically Designed Instruction), Independent Variables (<b>Parent</b> <b>Values</b> [...] Rural <b>Values</b> and <b>Parent</b> Religiosity), Mediating Factor (Parent Involvement), and the Dependent Variable (Student Outcome). Rural Values constructs include Anti-Intellectualism, Conservatism/Traditionalism, Ethnocentrism, Good Old Boy, and Stewardship of Earth. Religiosity constructs are Belief, Ritual, Experience, Primary Affiliation, and Affiliation Bond. Parent Involvement constructs are Belief and Action. GPA measures Student Outcomes. Quantitative results include descriptive statistics reported for a small N (38). Psychometric analyses reduce the number of variables because fo the small N and optimal scales yield Parent and Student Combined responses for nine of twelve scales. The separate constructs are then combined to produce a final set of scales for regressions: a reduced set of five Rural <b>Values,</b> one composite <b>Parent</b> Religiosity variable, and one Parent Involvement variable.

We conclude that if <b>parents</b> strongly <b>value</b> children, giving monetary aid produces more children and yields higher welfare. This positive welfare effect dominates an indirect negative welfare effect due to a lower growth rate. But, if <b>parents</b> <b>value</b> the quality of their children (health status), they achieve greater utility by inkind aid, which also lowers fertility and augments economic growth. ...|$|R
40|$|Bivoltine Silkworm hybrids are {{expected}} to possess additional plasticity to buffer against deleterious effects of highly fluctuating ambient conditions in tropical country like India. The phenomenon of Heterosis and its utility in silkworm breeding studies are widely popular and the estimates of heterosis over mid and better <b>parent</b> <b>values</b> are immensely useful in measuring the genetic potential of any silkworm combination. The present study was undertaken in which three-way cross hybrid combinations were made by using recently evolved promising bivoltine breeds, to know the rearing performance {{and the extent of}} hybrid vigour estimates in these three-way hybrid crosses. The extent of heterosis in 13 important economic traits was studied in 21 (OxO) xD three-way cross hybrids produced from oval and dumbbell bivoltine groups. Utilizing 6 oval and 6 dumbbell bivoltine breeds developed in a breeding study, fifteen OxO foundation crosses were made in a selective mode. The pre-cocoon, cocoon and post cocoon performance in different seasons and estimation of heterosis was taken up with three-way cross hybrids to estimate heterosis over mid and better <b>parent</b> <b>values.</b> The study reveals that out of total 21 hybrids studied, 6 (OxO) xD hybrids have exhibited significant rearing and reeling performance with desirable manifestation o...|$|R
40|$|Chinese {{parenting}} {{has received}} considerable attention from researchers around the globe. The {{aim of this}} study was to conduct a systematic review of the scholarly literature on Chinese parenting to determine how it has been conceptualized in the English language literature. A search of relevant keywords in electronic databases and reference lists of publications was conducted, followed by a narrative synthesis of the findings. Results show that the existing literature focused on the following six interrelated topics/themes: (i) different aspects/components of Chinese <b>parenting</b> (beliefs, <b>values,</b> practices and goals); (ii) relationships among parenting components; (iii) comparisons between Chinese and non-Chinese parents; (iv) parenting and child outcomes; (v) parenting styles; and (vi) factors that influence Chinese parenting. In general, existing studies examined Chinese parenting through describing <b>parenting</b> <b>values,</b> beliefs, practices and styles, and investigating the interrelationships between goals, practices and child outcomes. Implications and limitations of the review are discussed. published_or_final_versionEducationMasterMaster of Educatio...|$|R
