5|$|Future <b>projects</b> <b>will</b> {{result in}} {{numerous}} changes. A full interchange will be constructed between Wellington County Road34 and Maltby Road; the intersection {{with the former}} will become an overpass while the latter will be closed, with Maltby Road terminating at a cul-de-sac {{on both sides of}} the expressway. Further north, a partial-access diamond interchange will be built at Downey Road/ Kortright Road West, with ramps from the northbound lanes and to the southbound lanes and the crossroad run beneath the expressway.|$|E
5|$|Historically, many {{prospective}} Australian uranium mines {{have been}} constrained by active antinuclear opposition, but state governments have now approved mine development in Western Australia and Queensland. But {{it is unlikely}} that any new <b>projects</b> <b>will</b> enter active development until the market improves. As of 2013 uranium prices are very low. Cameco placed the Kintyre project on hold until market prices improve and Paladin has stated that its project proposals (Bigrlyi, Angela/Pamela, Manyingee, Oobagooma, and Valhalla/Skal) need higher uranium market prices before they can proceed. Toro wants to take the Wiluna proposal to the development phase, but has not been successful in attracting equity investors. When market prices go up again, so that mine development is justified, most projects would need at least five years to proceed to production.|$|E
5|$|Western Australia has a {{significant}} share of the Australia's uranium reserves, but between 2002 and 2008, a statewide ban on uranium mining was in force. The ban was lifted when the Liberal Party was voted into power in the state and, as of 2010, many companies are exploring for uranium in Western Australia. One of the industry's major players, the mining company BHP Billiton, planned to develop the Yeelirrie uranium project in a 17billion dollar project. Two other projects in Western Australia are further advanced then BHP's Yeelirrie, these being the Lake Way uranium project, which is pursued by Toro Energy, and the Lake Maitland uranium project, pursued by Mega Uranium. But {{it is unlikely that}} any new <b>projects</b> <b>will</b> enter active development until the market improves. As of 2013 uranium prices are very low.|$|E

40|$|This <b>project</b> <b>will</b> {{build on}} the {{previous}} work by Mark Harman and Shin Yoo on Pareto Efficient Test Case Selection pertaining to two objective formulation. It will introduce the concept of Pareto Efficient Test Case selection {{and the benefits of}} this approach. This <b>project</b> <b>will</b> illustrate the benefits of Pareto efficient test case selection with empirical studies of two objective formulations. Shin Yoo and Mark Harman used multiple objectives such as code coverage, past fault-detection history and execution cost, and constructed a group of non-dominating, equivalently optimal test case subsets. This <b>project</b> <b>will</b> develop on the code coverage and execution cost objectives. This <b>project</b> <b>will</b> consider a wider range of software artifacts with different meta-heuristic multi-objective optimization techniques. Also, a new evolutionary algorithm will be developed. The artifacts have been obtained from SIR – a software archive. The programs in the <b>project</b> <b>will</b> be developed in C language...|$|R

25|$|Houston {{is home to}} the Johnson Space Center, NASA's largest {{research}} and development facility, employing nearly 3,000 federal civil service workers and more than 14,000 contract personnel. Program offices for Project Constellation, Orion, and other new space vehicle <b>projects</b> <b>will</b> create new jobs at the center. The city's burgeoning aerospace industry heralded its second growth spurt, which solidified with the 1973 oil crisis. The majority of the contractor work force related to the <b>projects</b> <b>will</b> also be located at the center. Texas Governor Rick Perry recently announced a $7.5 million Texas Enterprise Fund (TEF) grant to Lockheed Martin, which will bring about 1,000 jobs to the Houston area. The grant ensures that Lockheed Martin will create these jobs in the Houston area after they earned a multibillion-dollar contract from NASA to build the Orion Crew Exploration Vehicle. Houston is also home to the United Space Alliance, which employs well over 10,000 people.|$|E
25|$|Economics {{professor}} Robert Pollin {{has influenced}} the national discussion {{about how best}} to stimulate the US economy and promote sustainability. He and colleagues at the Political Economy Research Institute have developed a plan for national recovery that shows, for example, that investing in clean energy (wind power, solar, and biofuels) will create about three times as many good-paying jobs than conventional <b>projects</b> <b>will,</b> while reducing greenhouse gas emissions and dependence on foreign oil.|$|E
25|$|In Australia, {{geothermal}} energy {{is a natural}} resource which is not utilised {{as a form of}} energy. However, there are known and potential locations near the centre of the country in which geothermal activity is detectable. Exploratory geothermal wells have been drilled to test for the presence of high temperature geothermal activity and such high levels were detected. As a result, <b>projects</b> <b>will</b> eventuate in the coming years and more exploration is expected at potential locations.|$|E

25|$|It {{is not yet}} known {{if these}} two {{separate}} <b>projects</b> <b>will</b> connect at any point, {{although there have been}} calls for some form of connection between the two routes. In June 2008 Conor Murphy, Minister for Regional Development, announced {{that there will be a}} study into the feasibility of connecting the A5 and A6. Should it proceed, the scheme would most likely run from Drumahoe to south of Prehen along the south east of the City.|$|E
25|$|Choosing between {{investment}} <b>projects</b> <b>will</b> {{be based}} upon several inter-related criteria. (1) Corporate management seeks to maximize {{the value of the}} firm by investing in projects which yield a positive net present value when valued using an appropriate discount rate in consideration of risk. (2) These projects must also be financed appropriately. (3) If no growth is possible by the company and excess cash surplus is not needed to the firm, then financial theory suggests that management should return {{some or all of the}} excess cash to shareholders (i.e., distribution via dividends).|$|E
25|$|The <b>projects</b> <b>will</b> {{allow the}} {{university}} to receive 15 percent of their purchased energy from these renewable energy resources. Also in 2010, the university's dining hall, Ellicott Dining Hall, installed solar panels which would provide up to 30 percent of the energy for water heating in the dining hall. To do this the university installed 20 panels with 3 solar storage tanks, pumps, temperature sensors, and controls. The system will increasingly provide more of the dining hall's water needs due to the storage tanks.|$|E

To do this the <b>project</b> <b>will</b> review previous and existing Energy Savings Performance Contracts. Further, this <b>project</b> <b>will</b> conduct a cost-benefit analysis of conventional power versus emerging photovoltaic energy for the Army’s Fort Bliss in El Paso, TX. The <b>project</b> <b>will</b> also analyze energy demands based on a new force alignment at Fort Bliss {{in accordance with the}} recent Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) findings.

25|$|Some analysts pointed that India's growing {{trade with}} other Asian countries, {{especially}} China, will {{help reduce the}} negative impact of the crisis. Analysts also said that India's high domestic demand and large infrastructure <b>projects</b> <b>will</b> act as a buffer reducing the impact of the global downturn on its economy. Economists argued that India's financial system is relatively insulated and its banks do not have significant exposure to subprime mortgage. In an editorial, the New York Times praised the strong regulations placed on the Indian banking system by the Reserve Bank of India.|$|E
25|$|Consider {{this matter}} in the context that natural gas {{producers}} generally buy mineral rights from the Crown but must negotiate surface access and other land rights with their neighbours. In this environment, the chances are high that some <b>projects</b> <b>will</b> face delays {{as a result of}} public hearings - for example, as Shell and the other contenders did at the Caroline hearing. After all, those with an interest in a single land use decision could include petroleum producers, Aboriginal communities, landowners, farmers, ranchers, loggers, trappers, campers, sports and environmental groups, and others. Many conflicting interests need to be resolved.|$|E
