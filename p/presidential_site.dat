50|$|Radwaniyah Palace (also {{known as}} Al Radwaniyah Presidential Complex) is a palace in Baghdad, Iraq, which {{functioned as a}} presidential resort for the late Iraqi Dictator Saddam Hussein until it {{was taken over by}} {{coalition}} forces during the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Inside it was decorated with marble, luxury furniture and monuments dedicated to Saddam. Located in western Baghdad, Radwaniyah Palace was the main <b>presidential</b> <b>site</b> for Saddam and was a typical <b>Presidential</b> <b>site.</b> It is bordered on the north by Qasr Tall Mihl and Al Urdun (Jordan) Street; on the south by sparse, outlying neighborhoods; on the east by suburbs Al 'Amiriyah and Hayy al-Furat; and on the west by Baghdad International Airport. High walls surround the former resort; watchtowers contribute to more readily maintaining surveillance and security for the site.|$|E

50|$|The Benjamin Harrison <b>Presidential</b> <b>Site,</b> {{previously}} {{known as}} the Benjamin Harrison Home, was {{the home of the}} Twenty-third President of the United States, Benjamin Harrison. It is in the Old Northside Historic District of Indianapolis, Indiana. Harrison had the sixteen-room house with its red brick exterior built in the 1870s. It was from the front porch of the house that Harrison instituted his famous Front Porch Campaign in the 1888 United States Presidential Campaign, often speaking to crowds on the street. In 1896, Harrison renovated the house and added electricity. He died there in a second story bedroom in 1901. Today it is owned by the Arthur Jordan Foundation and operated as a museum to the former president by the Benjamin Harrison Foundation.|$|E
50|$|Warren G. and Florence Kling HomeA {{national}} <b>presidential</b> <b>site,</b> the Harding Home was {{the residence}} of Warren G. Harding, twenty-ninth president of the United States. Harding and his future wife, Florence, designed the Queen Anne Style house in 1890, a year before their marriage. They were married {{in the home and}} lived there for 30 years before his election to the presidency. Like James A. Garfield, an earlier U.S. president from Ohio, Harding conducted his election campaign mainly from the house's expansive front porch. During the 3 month front porch campaign, over 600,000 people traveled to the Harding Home to listen to the candidate speak. Harding paid $1,000 dollars to have a Sears catalog house built behind his home so newspaper reporters had workspace to type their stories. The press house is also open to the public. The site is being expanded to include a Presidential Center for Harding, expected to be opened in 2020, the 100th anniversary of Harding's election to the Presidency.|$|E
5000|$|To {{make the}} primary mission of WMD search more manageable, ISG was operationally divided up into several sectors {{each with its}} own Sector Control Point. The three sectors were North, Baghdad and South, with Sector Control Point-Baghdad (also known as SCP-B or [...] "skip bee") being the primary and largest. The bulk of the ISG staff and SCP-B were located on Camp Slayer at the former Al Radwaniyah <b>Presidential</b> <b>Site</b> on Baghdad International Airport in western Baghdad. One of the major {{supporting}} elements of the ISG was the Combined Media Processing Center (CMPC). It consisted of four components, CMPC-Main (CMPC-M) at Camp Al Sayliyah, Qatar, CMPC-Baghdad (CMPC-B) located on Camp Slayer, as well as CMPC-North (CMPC-N), and CMPC-South (CMPC-S). The initial nucleus of the CMPC were drawn from DIA document exploitation personnel. By the summer of 2004, the CMPC had grown to over four hundred mostly civilian document and media processors and linguists/translators living and working primarily in CMPC-M at Camp Al Sayliyah, Qatar, and CMPC-B at Camp Slayer in Iraq.|$|E
50|$|DIA {{started the}} year 1997 with the {{groundbreaking}} ceremony {{for the new}} Missile and Space Intelligence Command facility on January 26 at Redstone Arsenal, Alabama. Mission enlargement and operational support defined 1997, as DIA provided analysis and information around the clock to military operations in Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Saddam Hussein's efforts to block UN inspection teams from <b>presidential</b> <b>sites</b> in October 1997 led to a buildup of U.S. and allied forces in the Persian Gulf. On March 13, 1997, U.S. military forces were used to evacuate certain U.S. Government employees and private American citizens from Tirana, Albania (Operation Silver Wake). In March 1997 a standby evacuation force of U.S. military personnel had been deployed to Congo and Gabon to provide enhanced security and to be available for any necessary evacuation operations. In May 1997, U.S. military personnel were deployed to Freetown, Sierra Leone, to prepare for and undertake the evacuation of certain U.S. government employees and private American citizens. In July 1997, {{in an effort to}} ensure the security of American citizens in Cambodia during a period of domestic conflict there, a Task Force of about 550 U.S. military personnel were deployed at Utapao Air Base in Thailand for possible evacuations. Other smaller operations were also ongoing during 1997, all of which DIA responded to in some way.|$|R

40|$|In July 2003, the Italian {{government}} enacted Presidential Decree 222 / 03 {{in order}} to provide more stringent rules for project documentation used to coordinate the health and safety management of workers employed on work <b>sites.</b> <b>Presidential</b> Decree 222 / 03 further defines the two main documents for site safety management: the Health and Safety Coordination Plan (H&SCP) prepared by the client and the Safety Operating Plan (SOP) submitted by the contractor. This paper examines interrelations that this addition to regulations brings to the complex system of safety management specific to the construction industry. In particular, it illustrates the quantification and payment of safety costs and implications of safety management on the work site, also by means of a case study. Legislation has established that the costs required to satisfy measures detailed in the safety plan must be calculated at safety design stage. In Italy the requirement to prepare a Health and Safety Coordination Plan (H&SCP) necessarily involves a number of enterprises. It is therefore necessary to identify at project design stage the correct division of works among the various enterprises {{in order to}} calculate the safety costs of each...|$|R
2500|$|The grave {{design process}} was placed under tight secrecy. An {{extensive}} research project {{was conducted in}} which hundreds of famous tombs (such as the Mausoleum of Halicarnassus and Grant's Tomb) {{as well as all}} existing <b>presidential</b> burial <b>sites.</b> Warnecke discussed design concepts with more than 40 architects, sculptors, painters, landscape architects, stonemasons, calligraphers, and liturgical experts—including the sculptor Isamu Noguchi, architectural model maker Theodore Conrad, and the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts. Noguchi counseled Warnecke to add a large sculptural cross to the site and to eliminate the eternal flame (which he felt was kitschy). Warnecke consulted with Mrs. Kennedy about the design of the grave many times over the following year. Hundreds of architectural drawings and models were produced to explore design ideas. On April 6, 1964, Warnecke sent a memorandum to Mrs. Kennedy in which he outlined his desire to retain the eternal flame as the centerpiece of the burial site and to keep the site's design as simple as possible. In the course of the research and conceptualization effort, Warnecke considered the appropriateness of structures or memorials at the site (such as crosses, shafts, pavilions, etc.), the history of Arlington National Cemetery, the vista, and how to handle ceremonies at the site. By August 1964, Warnecke and his assistants had written a 76-page research report which concluded that the gravesite was not a memorial nor monument, but a grave. [...] "This particular hillside, this flame, this man and this point in history must be synthesized in one statement that has distinctive character of its own. We must avoid adding elements that in later decades might become superficial and detract from the deeds of the man," [...] Warnecke wrote For some time {{in the spring and summer}} of 1964, the design process appeared to slow as Warnecke and his associates struggled to design the actual graves. But in the summer of 1964 Sargent Shriver, President Kennedy's brother-in-law, forcefully told Warnecke that [...] "There must be something there when we get there." [...] This spurred the design effort forward. In the late summer and early fall, Warnecke considered massive headstones, a sarcophagus, a sunken tomb, a raised tomb, and sculpture to mark the graves. Very late in the design process, two abstract sculptures were designed but ultimately rejected.|$|R
