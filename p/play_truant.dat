500|$|On April's fourteenth birthday, Marion, her adoptive mother, {{gives her}} earrings, not the mobile phone she wanted. They argue, and April leaves for school. After lying to her friends, {{claiming}} {{she has a}} phone {{and is going to}} the dentist's, April chooses to <b>play</b> <b>truant.</b> While at work at a stately home, Marion hears that April has not arrived at school. She talks to her friend and colleague Elliot, who unsuccessfully tries to dissuade her from leaving. April visits the home of Pat Williams, who cared for her as a baby. Pat remembers April and gives her a newspaper cutting telling the story of her discovery as a baby in a dustbin behind a pizza parlour. In a flashback, a young April is seen living with Janet and Daniel Johnson. The Johnsons' relationship is an abusive one, leading to Janet's suicide. Meanwhile, Marion goes to April's school, where she talks to April's friends, and realises that they were lied to. April then leaves Pat's home, and travels alone to Janet's grave. Marion continues to search, and, in a shopping centre, meets Elliot, who has joined her. April then visits the now abandoned Sunnyholme Children's Home, where she lived when she was younger. In a flashback, an eight-year-old April lives at the Sunnyholme. Cared for by a woman named Mo, April befriends an older girl called Gina and is introduced to Pearl, a girl of her age. Pearl behaves in front of Mo, but actually bullies April. Gina wakes April one night to involve her in a burglary, and, later, Pearl attacks April, holding her head under water, and then tears up April's beloved paper dolls. April confronts Pearl, who she pushes down a flight of stairs, and is reprimanded by Mo. A voice-over from 14-year-old April says Gina was then [...] "moved on", and, eventually, April is also moved on.|$|E

As a boy, Goh studied in the local town school and {{primarily}} taught in Dutch language. But he was active and mischievous child who often <b>played</b> <b>truant</b> from school and indulge in cock fighting.

60|$|On the two bright mornings of {{the week}} he wanted to <b>play</b> <b>truant</b> from the office, to be off with Ruth over the hills and far away. Both mornings there came to him a picture of Gertie, wanting to slip out and play like Ruth, but having no chance. He felt guilty because he had never bidden Gertie come tramping, and guiltily he {{recalled}} that it was with her that the boy Carl had gone to seek-our-fortunes. He told himself {{that he had been}} depending upon Gertie for the bread-and-butter of friendship, and begging for the opportunity to give the stranger, Ruth Winslow, dainties of which she already had too much.|$|E

[292] Two of his eclogues, as I have said, {{are from}} Marot, and his [...] {{earliest}} known verses are translations from Bellay, a poet who was [...] charming whenever {{he had the}} courage to <b>play</b> <b>truant</b> from a bad [...] school. We must not suppose that an analysis of the literature of the [...] demi-monde will give us all the elements of the French character. [...] It has been both grave and profound; nay, it has even contrived to be [...] wise and lively at the same time, a combination so incomprehensible [...] by the Teutonic races that they have labelled it levity. It puts them [...] out as nature did Fuseli.|$|E

60|$|To do the varlet justice, too, he was {{strongly}} {{attached to his}} parent. He would not willingly have given her pain on any account; {{and when he had}} been doing wrong, it was but for him to catch his poor mother's eye fixed wistfully and sorrowfully upon him, to fill his heart with bitterness and contrition. But he was a heedless youngster, and could not, for the life of him, resist any new temptation to fun and mischief. Though quick at his learning, whenever he could be brought to apply himself, yet he was always prone to be led away by idle company, and would <b>play</b> <b>truant</b> to hunt after birds'-nests, to rob orchards, or to swim in the Hudson.|$|E

6000|$|He {{was rather}} {{taken aback by}} this {{unexpected}} permission to <b>play</b> <b>truant,</b> and somehow it seemed to lessen his desire to go. He did not understand why, but Mrs. Jo did, and, knowing the natural perversity of the human mind, counted on it to help her now. She felt instinctively that the more the boy was restrained the more he would fret against it; but leave him free, and the mere sense of liberty would content him, joined to the knowledge that his presence was dear to those whom he loved best. It was a little experiment, but it succeeded, for Dan stood silent a moment, unconsciously picking the fan to pieces and turning the matter over in his mind. He felt that she appealed to his heart and his honor, and owned that he understood it by saying presently, {{with a mixture of}} regret and resolution in his face, ...|$|E
60|$|MY boy had not a {{great deal}} to do with schools after his docile childhood. When he began to run wild with the other boys he {{preferred}} their savage freedom; and he got out of going to school by most of the devices they used. He had never quite the hardihood to <b>play</b> <b>truant,</b> but he was subject to sudden attacks of sickness, which came on about school-time and went off towards the middle of the forenoon or afternoon in a very strange manner. I suppose that such complaints are unknown at the present time, but the Young People's fathers can tell them how much suffering they used to cause among boys. At the age when my boy was beginning to outgrow them he was taken into his father's printing-office, and he completed his recovery and his education there. But all through the years when he lived in the Boy's Town he had intervals of schooling, which broke in upon the swimming and the skating, of course, but were not altogether unpleasant or unprofitable.|$|E
60|$|The just Aristides {{had begun}} that {{morning with a}} serious error. Loitering {{on his way to}} school, {{occasionally}} stopping to inspect the footprints of probable bears, or indulging in cheerful badinage with the tunnel men,--to whom the apparition of a short-legged boy weighed down by a preternaturally large satchel was an object of boisterous solicitude,--Aristides suddenly found that he was {{an hour and a half}} too late for school. Whether this circumstance was purely accidental or not is a question of some uncertainty, for Aristides, on finding himself occupying this criminal position, at once resolved to <b>play</b> <b>truant.</b> I shall not stop to inquire by what system of logic this result presented itself to that just youth as a consistent deduction, or whether some indistinct apprehension of another and a better world beyond the settlement, where there were no schools and blackberries were plenty, had not influenced him in taking this fatal step. Enough that he entered on his rash career by instantly eating the dinner which he carried with him, and having propitiated that terrible god whose seat is every small boy's stomach, with a feeling of inexpressible guiltiness creeping over him, he turned his back upon the schoolhouse and ran into the woods.|$|E
