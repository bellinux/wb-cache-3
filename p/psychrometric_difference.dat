40|$|There the thermo-physical {{processes}} in the semiconductor thermocouple sensors of air humudity have been studied in view to the improvement of their operating characteristics and {{to the creation of}} sensors without tne moistening system. The dependence of <b>psychrometric</b> <b>difference</b> of air temperatures on the thermo-physical, structural and mode factors of semiconductor thermocouple micromodules has been ascertained. The correction factor of psychrometric formula has been obtained. The sensors of air humidity without the moistening system have been developed and have been introduced. The sensors may be used for control over the temperature-humidity characteristics of airAvailable from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|E
