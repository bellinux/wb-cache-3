40|$|Analysis of the {{structure}} of <b>procedures</b> <b>is</b> central to the foundations of problem soling. In this paper we explore three principle means for teaching procedures: telling, canned loops, and procedural abstraction. The most straightforward way to teach a <b>procedure</b> <b>is</b> by telling how to accomplish it in a high level goal-oriented language. In the method of canned loops the control structure that is needed for the <b>procedure</b> <b>is</b> supposed and the <b>procedure</b> <b>is</b> deduced. In the method of procedural abstraction the <b>procedure</b> <b>is</b> abstracted from protocols of the procedure on examples...|$|R
40|$|Abstract In {{this paper}} the {{mathematical}} logic behind a hierarchical planning <b>procedure</b> <b>is</b> discussed. The planning <b>procedure</b> <b>is</b> used to derive production volumes of consumer products. The {{essence of the}} planning <b>procedure</b> <b>is</b> that first a commitment is made concerning the production volume {{for a family of}} similar products and in a second stage the committed production volume is allocated among the products within the product family. A computationally attractive <b>procedure</b> <b>is</b> developed to compute the aggregate production volume and the allocated quantities, such that some target customer service level <b>is</b> achieved. The <b>procedure</b> <b>is</b> based on a combination of exact reasoning, approximation schemes and empirical findings. Numerical results showing the excellent performance of the <b>procedure</b> <b>are</b> included...|$|R

5|$|According to Article 142 of the Turkish Constitution, the organisation, {{duties and}} {{jurisdiction}} of the courts, their functions and the trial <b>procedures</b> <b>are</b> regulated by law. In line with the aforementioned article of the Turkish Constitution and related laws, the court system in Turkey can be classified under three main categories; which are the Judicial Courts, Administrative Courts and Military Courts. Each category includes first instance courts and high courts. In addition, the Court of Jurisdictional Disputes rules on cases that cannot be classified readily as falling within the purview of one court system.|$|E
5|$|Many {{brachytherapy}} <b>procedures</b> <b>are</b> {{performed on}} an outpatient basis. This convenience {{may be particularly}} relevant for patients who have to work, older patients, or patients who live some distance from treatment centres, {{to ensure that they}} have access to radiotherapy treatment and adhere to treatment plans. Shorter treatment times and outpatient procedures can also help improve the efficiency of radiotherapy clinics.|$|E

5|$|Phase {{contrast}} and {{differential interference contrast}} (DIC) microscopy are important tools in biology and medicine. Most animal cells and single-celled organisms have very little color, and their intracellular organelles are almost totally invisible under simple bright field illumination. These structures can be made visible by staining the specimens, but staining <b>procedures</b> <b>are</b> time-consuming and kill the cells. As seen in Figs.24 and25, phase {{contrast and}} DIC microscopes allow unstained, living cells to be studied. DIC also has non-biological applications, for example {{in the analysis of}} planar silicon semiconductor processing.|$|E
5|$|The {{procedures}} used for decompression {{depend on the}} mode of diving, the available equipment, the site and environment and the actual dive profile. Standardized procedures have been developed that provide an acceptable level of risk in appropriate circumstances. Different sets of <b>procedures</b> <b>are</b> used by commercial, military, scientific and recreational divers, though there is considerable overlap where similar equipment is used, and some concepts are common to all decompression procedures.|$|E

5|$|A {{preventative}} procedure (thoracotomy or thoracoscopy with pleurodesis) may be recommended {{after an}} episode of pneumothorax, with the intention to prevent recurrence. Evidence on the most effective treatment is still conflicting in some areas, and there is variation between treatments available in Europe and the US. Not all episodes of pneumothorax require such interventions; the decision depends largely on estimation {{of the risk of}} recurrence. These <b>procedures</b> <b>are</b> often recommended after the occurrence of a second pneumothorax. Surgery may need to be considered if someone has experienced pneumothorax on both sides ("bilateral"), sequential episodes that involve both sides, or if an episode was associated with pregnancy.|$|E
5|$|Decompression may be {{continuous}} or staged, {{where the}} ascent {{is interrupted by}} stops at regular depth intervals, but the entire ascent {{is part of the}} decompression, and ascent rate can be critical to harmless elimination of inert gas. What is commonly known as no-decompression diving, or more accurately no-stop decompression, relies on limiting ascent rate for avoidance of excessive bubble formation. Staged decompression may include deep stops depending on the theoretical model used for calculating the ascent schedule. Omission of decompression theoretically required for a dive profile exposes the diver to significantly higher risk of symptomatic decompression sickness, and in severe cases, serious injury or death. The risk is related to the severity of exposure and the level of supersaturation of tissues in the diver. Procedures for emergency management of omitted decompression and symptomatic decompression sickness have been published. These <b>procedures</b> <b>are</b> generally effective, but vary in effectiveness from case to case.|$|E
5|$|Mercury {{and most}} of its {{compounds}} are extremely toxic and must be handled with care; in cases of spills involving mercury (such as from certain thermometers or fluorescent light bulbs), specific cleaning <b>procedures</b> <b>are</b> used to avoid exposure and contain the spill. Protocols call for physically merging smaller droplets on hard surfaces, combining them into a single larger pool for easier removal with an eyedropper, or for gently pushing the spill into a disposable container. Vacuum cleaners and brooms cause greater dispersal of the mercury and should not be used. Afterwards, fine sulfur, zinc, or some other powder that readily forms an amalgam (alloy) with mercury at ordinary temperatures is sprinkled over the area before itself being collected and properly disposed of. Cleaning porous surfaces and clothing is not effective at removing all traces of mercury and it is therefore advised to discard these kinds of items should they be exposed to a mercury spill.|$|E

5|$|The above <b>procedures</b> <b>are</b> not {{sufficient}} to cause an Act of Tynwald to come into full force of law. By ancient custom, an Act did not come into force until it had been promulgated at an open-air sitting of the Tynwald, historically held on Tynwald Hill at St John's on St John's Day (24 June), but, since {{the adoption of the}} Gregorian calendar in 1753, on 5 July (or on the following Monday if 5 July is a Saturday or Sunday). Promulgation originally consisted of the reading of the Act in English and Manx; but after 1865 the reading of the title of the Act and a summary of each section was sufficient. This was reduced in 1895 to the titles and a memorandum of the object and purport of the Act, and since 1988 only the short title and a summary of the long title have been read.|$|E
5|$|The {{few other}} areas that operate the special {{legislative}} <b>procedures</b> <b>are</b> justice & home affairs, budget and taxation and {{certain aspects of}} other policy areas: such as the fiscal aspects of environmental policy. In these areas, the Council or Parliament decide law alone. The procedure used also depends upon which type of institutional act is being used. The strongest act is a regulation, an act or law which is directly applicable in its entirety. Then there are directives which bind members to certain goals which they must achieve, but they do this through their own laws and hence have room to manoeuvre in deciding upon them. A decision is an instrument which is focused at a particular person or group and is directly applicable. Institutions may also issue recommendations and opinions which are merely non-binding declarations.|$|E
