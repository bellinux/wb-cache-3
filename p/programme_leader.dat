40|$|This paper empirically {{examines}} the pivotal role of degree <b>programme</b> <b>leaders</b> as change agents in higher education. <b>Programme</b> <b>leaders</b> {{are responsible for}} managing whole degree programmes, including a complex combination of curriculum, administrative and staff coordination roles. The paper analyses responses from 176 <b>programme</b> <b>leaders</b> in three multi-campus Australian universities, investigating their role conceptions, sources of role stress, and institutional factors influencing role enactment. Challenges of leading academic programmes in multi-campus university settings were also explored. The majority of respondents found the role rewarding, yet expressed frustration {{at the lack of}} role clarity and recognition, accompanied by high administrative burdens. The paper explores the significance of these boundary-spanning roles that combine academic and administrative functions, leaving many incumbents uncertain about their role identity and its contribution to future career paths. Implications for supporting <b>programme</b> <b>leaders</b> to achieve a balance between managing information and engaging in wise, strategic thinking are explored.

Using attribution theory, the article suggests that this lack of understanding may contribute to further attrition and calls for further research on the topic. [URL]...|$|R

40|$|By {{investigating}} the factors facilitating and hindering {{a small scale}} educational change, this study highlights the crucial role of leadership in designing and implementing an educational change at a transnational university in Vietnam. During its initiation stage, the <b>programme</b> <b>leaders</b> seemed to fail to (1) set up a clear schedule for changing, (2) assist external advisory groups in providing training sessions and (3) clarify the responsibilities of external advisory groups. At the implementation stage, <b>programme</b> <b>leaders</b> and teachers {{were less likely to}} (1) develop the collective knowledge and understandings required for ongoing instructional improvement, (2) adjust the teaching quality control system and (3) cooperate with advisory groups. The lessons that can be learned include (1) mutual trust between stakeholders is vital to its successful implementation as it may determine the level of efforts stakeholders would make, (2) preparations should include clarifying stakeholders&# 039; responsibilities and the accountability system and (3) the external advisory groups need to be properly managed {{from the very beginning of}} the change...|$|R

40|$|The article {{sets out}} to explore how PhD <b>programme</b> <b>leaders</b> in South Africa view {{the purpose of the}} PhD, and how their views shape their {{responses}} to recent policies with regard to the PhD. If refers in particular to the vision of the Department of Science and Technology for a five-fold {{increase in the number of}} PhD graduates by 2018, and to the drive to achieve racial and gender equity as part of the transition to democracy. The article is based on interviews with leaders of 16 doctoral programmes in nine top PhD-awarding South African universities, representing a range of disciplines. The data indicate that there is a strong predisposition among PhD <b>programme</b> <b>leaders</b> to perceive the doctorate largely as an academic pursuit. At the same time, some tentative changes are being seen ‘on the ground’ in response to the needs of industry and business, to the various policies, and to a diverse student cohort. It seems that the PhD attempts to serve several purposes within the single structure provided by the Higher Education Qualification Framework, sometimes in tense associations. Going forward, the article discusses two policy options available to South Africa. [URL]...|$|R

40|$|Purpose:- To {{confirm the}} entry {{standards}} of specialist MSc programmes within Engineering {{and provide a}} diagnostic test that will determine if a prospective student has the underpinning knowledge to facilitate success on the programme. Design/Methodology/Approach:- The entry standards for the specialist programmes within Engineering were benchmarked against the competitor set used in the Corporate Strategy to identify any significant differences or practices. The entry test was developed by discussion with the <b>programme</b> <b>leaders</b> at Northumbria. Its suitability was tested on Northumbria final year undergraduate (UG) students and compared with their degree award. The results from UG and post graduate (PG) students provided data that was analysed to confirm the <b>programme</b> <b>leader’s</b> expectations. The test was then given to new MSc students and analysis carried out to compare how well they progressed on the programme. Findings:- There are no major differences in the academic entry criterion specified within the benchmark group, however English requirements do differ. The Northumbria undergraduate students that passed the test graduated at upper second class level or higher. Both graduating UG and incoming PG students had similar levels of knowledge. There is moderate correlation which is statistically significant, between the entry test and the postgraduate results. Originality/value:- This model will help enrol more appropriate students and improve the retention, progression, completion and performance of International students {{as stated in the}} Corporate Strategy. This model could be adopted by any School or Institution offering specialist PGT programmes...|$|R
