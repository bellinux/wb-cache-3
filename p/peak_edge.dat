40|$|A {{detailed}} {{history of}} drought {{variability in the}} Colorado River Basin for the last half millennium was obtained using tree ring-widths of precipitation sensitive trees as a proxy record of past climatic conditions. A one-dimensional edge detection filter was applied to standardized ring-width indices to identify years with rapid change in ring-width magnitude that may reflect changes in state. Both standardized indices and edge detection outputs were mapped to analyze how the spatial pattern of drought changes over time. A Principal Components Analysis was performed for both the mapped index and edge detection outputs {{to determine whether there}} were specific patterns within the data. This data analysis identified repeating spatial patterns between each of the identified drought periods during drought onset, with the first principal component of the edge detection accounting for 60 % {{of the variance in the}} edge data. A temporal mapping of principal component loadings suggests that the Pacific Decadal Oscillation and the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation play a significant role in forcing drought onset patterns. Superposed Epoch Analysis and a species-sensitivity analysis revealed that there are differences that exist between the droughts, including variation in the timing of the peak index year relative to the onset of drought (<b>peak</b> <b>edge</b> year), in magnitude of drought response, and in the migration patterns of drought onset, making it difficult to classify the droughts. The edge detection filter was found to be successful in identifying periods of drought onset, illustrating drought onset, and capturing migration of drought areas. The Principal Component Analysis loading patterns suggest that there are specific regions within the Colorado River Basin that vary synchronously during drought onset. Having a better understanding of these repeating regional variations in the Colorado River Basin will lead to improved drought predictability, and aid in water management in the region.

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{highlights}} the experimental {{research of the}} author regarding the implementation of spiral bevel gears with curved teeth, teeth which have a decreasing depth of the tooth. The subject {{of this paper is}} the process of toothing a gear with the use of cutting tools designed and made by the author. The knives have the side and <b>peak</b> <b>edges</b> generated according to an involute spiral. The proposed solution for the side and peak surface coincidental grinding is based on a key property of cylindrical helicoids of constant pace which states that the common screw axis is affine-invariant to the rototranslation of either helicoid. The exploitation of this property for achieving active helical edges ensures the conservation of the shape of the cutting tool’s edges, and consequently of its profile. The results obtained with these cutting tools in the processing of the gear are being presented. ...|$|R

Both SEM and TEM {{can be used to}} visualize the location, size, and morphology of the nanoparticles, while UV-vis spectroscopy can be used to confirm the metallic nature, size and aggregation level. Energy dispersive analysis of X-ray is used to determine elemental composition, and X-ray diffraction is used to determine chemical composition and crystallographic structure. UV-Vis absorption peaks for silver, gold, and cadmium sulfide nanoparticles can vary depending on particle size: 25-50 nm silver particles peak ca. 415 nm, gold nanoparticles 30-40 nm peak ca. 450 nm, while a cadmium sulfide absorption edge ca. 450 is indicative of quantum size particles.

50|$|Early {{types of}} system memory (RAM), such as SDRAM, {{transmitted}} data on only the rising {{edge of the}} clock signal.

40|$|We {{present the}} {{experimental}} ELNES spectra of the Cr-L 2, 3 and O-K edges in three high pressure synthesized perovskites, ACrO 3 (A = Ca, Sr and Pb). A {{comparison of the}} experimental spectra against the theoretical calculations shows {{the influence of the}} A cation in the features of the spectrum. The Cr-L 2, 3 multiplet structure of these perovskites shows similar integrated intensity ratio (IL 3 /IL 2) between them and with the CrO 2, implying that all of them are indeed composed by Cr 4 +. But the O-K pre-edge observed in CrO 2, typical of its d 3 L character (L-ligand hole), is not present in these perovskites. The effect of the A cation manifests itself in the O-K edge.

30|$|Firstly, it {{is easily}} {{understood}} that for diamond coated specimens {{with a certain}} high initial surface roughness, {{the reduction of the}} Ra value is more significant at the initial stage of AFM, mainly owing to the high material removal efficiency caused by the diamond particles in the paste on distinct <b>peaks,</b> <b>edges</b> and convex of as-synthesized diamond grains. With the surface smoothing, the polishing efficiency gradually decreases and approaches zero, indicating that the further polishing is impossible. There is a threshold of the attainable Ra value for any diamond coated milling cutter, which is about 68 ‒ 77 nm for the nano-sized film surfaces that is close to Ra values of R-WC and F-WC specimens. Nevertheless, such the threshold is as high as 115 ‒ 126 nm for micro-sized film surfaces. Moreover, the threshold for the BDMCD film (121 nm on average) is lower than that for the UMCD one (125 nm on average), and the threshold for the BDM-UFGCD film (75 nm on average) is relatively higher than those for the single-layer UFGD film (72 nm on average) or BDFGD film (72 nm on average). In addition, because there is no obvious difference between the features of the same diamond films deposited on the rake and flank faces, such the thresholds for both the faces of the same diamond coated milling cutter are totally the same.|$|R

We used the class of 1 -D images defined by Morrone and Burr in which the amplitude spectrum is that of a (partially blurred) square-wave and all Fourier components have a common phase. Observers used a cursor to mark where bars and edges were seen for different test phases (Experiment 1) or judged the spatial alignment of contours that had different phases (e. g. 0 ° and 45 °; Experiment 2).

Using a two-tone stimulus, the excitatory and inhibitory portions of the response areas were determined and then parameterized {{in terms of an}} asymmetry index. The index measures the balance of excitatory and inhibitory influences around the best frequency (BF). The sensitivity of responses to the direction of a frequency-modulated (FM) tone was tested and found to correlate strongly with the asymmetry index of the response areas. Specifically, cells with strong inhibition from frequencies above (below) the BF preferred upward (downward) sweeps. Responses to spectrally shaped noise were also consistent with the asymmetry of the response areas: cells that were strongly inhibited by frequencies higher than the BF responded best to stimuli that contained least spectral energy above the BF. In a local region, most cells exhibited similar response area types and other response features. the distribution of the asymmetry index values along the isofrequency planes revealed systematic changes in the symmetry of the response areas. At the center, response areas with narrow and symmetric inhibitory sidebands predominated. These gave way to asymmetric inhibition, with high frequency inhibition (relative to the BF) becoming more effective caudally, and low frequency inhibition more effective rostrally. These response types tended to cluster along repeated bands that paralleled the tonotopic asix. One functionaly implication of the response area organization is that cortical responses encode the locally averaged gradient of the acoustic spectrum by their differential distribution along the isofrequency planes. This enhances the representation of such features as the symmetry of spectral <b>peaks,</b> <b>edges,</b> and the spectral envelope.
