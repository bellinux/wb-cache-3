The need for the Lim-Flex hybrid arose in 2000 out of a perceived need by North American commercial cattle breeders for hybrid bulls that would assist in achieving end-product targets.|$|E

5|$|As {{part of the}} contest's graphic design, special postcards were {{commissioned}} by the Danish host broadcaster DR to introduce each of the <b>participating</b> <b>countries</b> before the acts took to the stage. For the 2014 contest the contestants were asked to take a photo of their country's flag, made in a creative way. Austria's postcard {{was the first to}} be filmed by DR, and was shot at the Schönbrunn Palace in Vienna featuring Wurst and her stylist Tamara Mascara creating the Austrian flag out of 70 baroque-style dresses.|$|E

The entries were evaluated both by a jury {{and according to the}} votes by visitors to the competition website.

Initially a local competition was held in the <b>participating</b> <b>countries</b> prior to the international final competition.|$|E

5|$|The {{currency}} {{was introduced}} in non-physical form (traveller's cheques, electronic transfers, banking, etc.) at midnight on 1 January 1999, when the national currencies of <b>participating</b> <b>countries</b> (the eurozone) ceased to exist independently. Their exchange rates were locked at fixed rates against each other. The euro thus became the successor to the European Currency Unit (ECU). The notes and coins for the old currencies, however, continued {{to be used as}} legal tender until new euro notes and coins were introduced on 1 January 2002.|$|E
5|$|Troll Airfield {{was opened}} on 11 February 2005 by Queen Sonja of Norway {{and the new}} {{research}} station the following day. At first, Antonov An-2, DHC-6/300 Twin Otters, Dorniers 228 and smaller aircraft {{were used for the}} services. Later, two Basler BT-67, operated by Antarctic Logistics Centre International, were taken into use. The cooperation has resulted in the availability of larger aircraft more suited for research, through coordinated search and rescue operations between the <b>participating</b> <b>countries.</b> On 19 January 2008, the airfield was visited by Norwegian Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg.|$|E
5|$|Asia League {{was created}} {{primarily}} {{for the development of}} hockey in Asia. The league allows teams to hire a small number of imports to play on the team in order to even out strength as well as increase the level of competitiveness in the league. Playing against more skilled foreign players will allow players from the <b>participating</b> <b>countries</b> to increase their skills and benefit from having some more experienced players on their teams. China is allowed the most imports while the experienced Japanese teams are allowed the fewest. As part of some sponsorship deals China was provided western players from the San Jose Sharks, and the two Chinese teams were provided Swedish players when the Nordic Vikings were active in the league.|$|E

5|$|Since 2008 {{the winning}} entry of each contest has been decided by {{a mixture of}} televoting and {{national}} juries, each counting for {{fifty percent of the}} points awarded by each country. The winners of all previous contests had been decided exclusively by televoting. The ten entries that have received the most votes in each country are awarded points ranging from one to eight, then ten and twelve. These points are then announced live during the programme by a spokesperson representing the participating country (who, like the participants, is aged between ten and fifteen). Once all <b>participating</b> <b>countries</b> have announced their results, the country that has received the most points is declared the winner of that year's contest.|$|E
5|$|Sophisticated counterfeits {{have been}} found in several Asian {{countries}} such as Cambodia, China, Indonesia, Laos, Thailand, and Vietnam, and are an important cause of avoidable death in those countries. The WHO said that studies indicate that up to 40% of artesunate-based malaria medications are counterfeit, especially in the Greater Mekong region and have established a rapid alert system to enable information about counterfeit drugs to be rapidly reported to the relevant authorities in <b>participating</b> <b>countries.</b> There is no reliable way for doctors or lay people to detect counterfeit drugs without help from a laboratory. Companies are attempting to combat the persistence of counterfeit drugs by using new technology to provide security from source to distribution.|$|E
5|$|The 1974 Asian Games (officially {{known as}} the Seventh Asian Games) was a multi-sport event held in Tehran, Iran from September 1, 1974, to September 16, 1974. This {{was the first time}} that Asian Games were celebrated in any Middle East country. A total of 3,010athletes {{selected}} from 25 Asian National Olympic Committees participated in 16 sports divided into 202 events. The number of <b>participating</b> <b>countries</b> was the greatest in Asian Games history, eighteen nations competed in Bangkok, host of the 1970 Asian Games. Fencing, gymnastics (artistic) and women's basketball were included for the first time; while sailing—which made its debut in the previous Asian Games—was not included, however since 1978, sailing is a part of the Asian Games sports.|$|E

5|$|The common {{thresher}} {{is widely}} caught by offshore longline and pelagic gillnet fisheries, {{especially in the}} northwestern Indian Ocean, the western, central, and eastern Pacific, and the North Atlantic. <b>Participating</b> <b>countries</b> include the former USSR, Japan, Taiwan, Spain, the United States, Brazil, Uruguay, and Mexico. The meat is highly prized for human consumption cooked, dried and salted, or smoked. In addition, their skin is made into leather, their liver oil is processed for vitamins, and their fins are used for shark fin soup. The United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) reported a worldwide common thresher take of 411 metric tons in 2006.|$|E
5|$|The {{draw that}} {{determined}} the semi-final running order {{was held on}} 25 January 2012 at the Buta Palace. The <b>participating</b> <b>countries,</b> excluding the automatic finalists (Azerbaijan, France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom), were split into six pots, based upon how those countries voted in past contests. From these pots, half (or as close to half as possible) competed in the first semi-final on 22 May 2012. The other half in that particular pot competed in the second semi-final on 24 May 2012. This draw also acted as an approximate running order, {{in order for the}} delegations from the countries to know when their rehearsals would commence and determine which semi-final the automatic finalists would be allowed to vote in.|$|E
5|$|The organising {{committee}} {{paid for}} all costs incurred in Australia to <b>participating</b> <b>countries.</b> They were only {{required to pay}} their transport and stop over costs to and from Australia. Other Australian States were consulted and requested to provide funding of £9,250. The specific state funding quotas were: Victoria £2,500, New South Wales £2,500, Western Australia £2,600, Queensland £1,000 and South Australia £450. There was a concern as to not impact on the fund raising required by the Commonwealth Games appeal. Several reports of the Games highlight the importance of large spectator attendance and 'passing the hat' around in the fund raising efforts. The total cost at the Games was £11,717 with a surplus of £2,089.|$|E
