5|$|As he {{had when}} he {{directed}} The Wrath of Khan, Meyer attempted to modify the look of Star Trek to fit his vision. Cinematographer Hiro Narita's previous work had been on effects films such as The Rocketeer, where he had {{time and money to}} make a lavish period fantasy; with The Undiscovered Country, he was constantly under time and budgetary pressures. Though Narita confessed that he knew nothing about Star Trek, Meyer replied {{that he did not want}} him to have any <b>preconceived</b> <b>notions</b> about the look of the series.|$|E
5|$|Oscar Hammerstein's {{commitment}} to idealizing and encouraging tolerance theatrically started with his libretto to Show Boat. It {{can be seen}} in his later works, many of which were set to music by Richard Rodgers. Carmen Jones is an attempt to present a modern version of the classic French opera through the experiences of African Americans during wartime, and South Pacific explores interracial marriage and prejudice. Finally, The King andI deals with different cultures' <b>preconceived</b> <b>notions</b> regarding each other and the possibility for cultural inclusiveness in societies.|$|E
5|$|Masashi Kishimoto {{developed}} {{the concept of}} jutsu in order to explain the superhuman feats that ninja performed in the Naruto series. He intended the design for the ninja in Naruto to dispel <b>preconceived</b> <b>notions</b> about ninja popularized by other manga and to bring an original take to the presentation of ninja in manga. The use of hand seals substitutes for the incantations for magic found in other sources, and {{was based on the}} motions of ninja in various role-playing games. The hand seals are based upon the characters of the Chinese zodiac, which is a longstanding tradition in Japan, and Kishimoto used them specifically to draw upon that tradition.|$|E
40|$|Today most {{universities}} are using course evaluations. However, course evaluations are often discussed and questioned. This paper {{reports on a}} survey where we aim at finding out (1) if students have a <b>preconceived</b> <b>notion</b> of a course, (2) if course evaluation scores can be predicted early in a course, (3) if exam throughput impacts course evaluation, and (4) if web-based evaluation reflects the general opinion from students. The results from the study indicate that students do not let <b>preconceived</b> <b>notion</b> impact nor does exam throughput matter to course evaluation. Further, the final web-based results seem to correlate with opinion of students attending lectures. However, the evaluation grades tend to be defined early in the course; hence first impression lasts...|$|R

5|$|Homer ignores {{his studies}} and instead focuses on his <b>preconceived</b> <b>notions</b> of college life through {{adolescent}} movies and TV shows, {{such as the}} fictional The School of Hard Knockers, which stereotype college life as pranks, partying and rigid deans. He also insults the college dean, Dean Peterson, believing {{him to be a}} crusty, conservative administrator. In reality, Peterson relates well with the students and is relatively young. Homer acts like a know-it-all in class and is asked to demonstrate how a proton accelerator operates; consequently, he causes a nuclear meltdown in class. Dean Peterson takes him aside and recommends hiring a tutor. The tutors turn out to be three computer nerds named Benjamin, Doug, and Gary. The trio try to help Homer understand the material from his physics course, but he refuses to cooperate. Instead, he is determined to help them gain a social life by pulling a prank on rival college Springfield A University. The prank involves kidnapping the other school's mascot, a pig named Sir Oinks-a-lot. However, Homer causes the pig to become very ill after feeding it malt liquor, and Benjamin, Doug, and Gary are blamed for the incident.|$|E
25|$|According to Arshak Safrastian, the Medes and Scythians {{mentioned}} in classical Greek literature existed only as <b>preconceived</b> <b>notions.</b> Equating the Carduchi with the Gutians, {{he adds that}} the moment the Ten Thousand began to skirt the lower slopes of the Hamrin Mountains, they were {{in contact with the}} tribes of Gutium which are presented here as Medes or Scythians.|$|E
25|$|My {{assessment}} {{is that your}} profession, to some extent, has strayed from these ethical standards and allowed external agendas to manipulate what the American public sees on TV, what they read in our newspapers and what they see on the web.

5000|$|The self-effacing Fentress (one of his noted design {{principles}} {{is simply}} “restrain the ego”) {{has developed a}} personal discipline he calls the “Patient Search”. He has said of the process; “I don’t begin with a <b>preconceived</b> <b>notion</b> of what the building needs to be - {{it is not a}} sculpture. I patiently search, walk the site, study the culture, follow our process until I find a seam somewhere, crack it open and discover the art inside.” Asked about his philosophical approach, Fentress once indicated; “My philosophy is ultimately…pragmatism”.(See “Curt Fentress” biographical entry) It has been pointed out that Fentress’ practical concerns with the “curbside to airside” customer experience has been a key to the success of his airport work."I don’t begin with a <b>preconceived</b> <b>notion</b> of what a building should be - it is not a sculpture.

25|$|Another {{approach}} to humanistic counseling and therapy is Gestalt therapy, which puts {{a focus on}} the here and now, especially as an opportunity to look past any <b>preconceived</b> <b>notions</b> and focus on how the present is affected by the past. Role playing also plays a large role in Gestalt therapy and allows for a true expression of feelings that may not have been shared in other circumstances. In Gestalt therapy, non-verbal cues are an important indicator of how the client may actually be feeling, despite the feelings expressed.|$|E
25|$|The {{fact that}} the Polish Jewish {{community}} was destroyed during World War II, coupled with stories about Polish collaborators, has contributed, especially among Israelis and American Jews, to a lingering stereotype that the Polish population has been passive in regard to, or even supportive of, Jewish suffering. However, modern scholarship has not validated the claim that Polish antisemitism was irredeemable or different from contemporary Western antisemitism; it has also found that such claims are among the stereotypes that comprise anti-Polonism. The presenting of selective {{evidence in support of}} <b>preconceived</b> <b>notions</b> have led some popular press to draw overly simplistic and often misleading conclusions regarding the role played by Poles {{at the time of the}} Holocaust.|$|E
25|$|In these {{double-blind}} experiments, {{neither the}} participants nor the researchers know which participants {{belong to the}} control group, nor the test group. Only after all data have been recorded (and, in some cases, analyzed) do the researchers learn which participants were which. Performing an experiment in double-blind fashion can greatly lessen the power of <b>preconceived</b> <b>notions</b> or physical cues (e.g., the placebo effect, observer bias, experimenter's bias) to distort the results (by making researchers or participants behave differently from in everyday life). Random assignment of test subjects to the experimental and control groups is {{a critical part of}} any double-blind research design. The key that identifies the subjects and which group they belonged to is kept by a third party, and is not revealed to the researchers until the study is over.|$|E

500|$|The first Danish {{reviews of}} Andersen's 1835 tales {{appeared}} in 1836, and were hostile. Critics disliked the informal, chatty style, {{and the lack}} of morals, and offered Andersen no encouragement.

He was told he [...] "lacked the usual form of that kind of poetry... and would not study models".

30|$|A {{commonly}} <b>preconceived</b> <b>notion</b> of {{a positive}} wetland size-amphibian abundance relationship may carry more weight than it should, at least for R. aurora. Currently, no research indicates a positive association between R. aurora occurrence or abundance with wetland size.

The book received grudgingly positive reviews, and was a financial success—"remarkably so for a volume of short stories", according to Hamilton. Nine Stories spent three months on the New York Times Bestseller list. Already tightening his grip on publicity, though, Salinger refused to allow publishers of the collection to depict his characters in dust jacket illustrations, lest readers form <b>preconceived</b> <b>notions</b> of them.|$|E
