[...] U.S. 16 is the same aperture as 16, but apertures that are larger or smaller by a full stop use doubling or halving of the U.S. number, for example 11 is U.S. 8 and 8 is U.S. 4. The exposure time required is directly proportional to the U.S. number. [...] Eastman Kodak used U.S. stops on many of their cameras {{at least in the}} 1920s.|$|E

[...] In the first Joint Exhibition, held in New York City in 1887, Joseph Prince Loud and HoraceA. Latimer received the Boston club's only diplomas. In the third Joint Exhibition in Philadelphia in 1889, Boston was represented by WilfredA. French; Horace Latimer, the club's only award winner; and William Garrison Reed. [...] Starting with the fourth Joint Exhibition in New York City in 1891, collaborative preparation ended and each club individually ran the exhibition in the city {{in which it was}} held. In the 1891 exhibition Latimer exhibited the most prints from the Boston club.

50|$|The Royal <b>Photographic</b> <b>Society</b> <b>of</b> Great Britain, {{commonly}} known as the Royal Photographic Society (RPS), is one of the world's oldest photographic societies. It was founded in London, England in 1853 as The <b>Photographic</b> <b>Society</b> <b>of</b> London with the objective of promoting the art and science of photography, and in 1854 received Royal patronage from Queen Victoria and Prince Albert. A change to the society's name to reflect the Royal patronage was, however, not considered expedient at the time. In 1874 it was renamed the <b>Photographic</b> <b>Society</b> <b>of</b> Great Britain, and from 1894 it became known as The Royal <b>Photographic</b> <b>Society</b> <b>of</b> Great Britain. A registered charity since 1962, in July 2004, The Royal <b>Photographic</b> <b>Society</b> <b>of</b> Great Britain was granted a Royal charter recognising its eminence in the field of photography as a learned society. For most of its history the Society was based at various premises in London. It moved to Bath in 1979, and since 2004 its headquarters has been at Fenton House in Bath, England.
