Expectations about high export intensities of rationalized manufacturers and <b>product</b> <b>mandate</b> subsidiaries are confirmed, as well as the negative association between miniature replicas and exports. A crucial finding is the negative relationship between value-added scope (measured by autonomy and specialized capabilities) and export intensity.

40|$|This paper {{summarizes}} {{the results of}} in-depth case studies of international R&D management in four Swedish multinational corporations. The results suggest that foreign volumes and shares of R&D expenditures are rapidly increasing. Through a rapidly increasing number of foreign acquisitions, foreign R&D laboratories have been added. As part of international rationalization of production, foreign units have been given global <b>product</b> <b>mandates</b> with responsibility both for manufacturing and R&D. In maturing foreign subsidiaries, routine technical activities have often evolved into proper R&D. Tight labour market conditions for engineers in Sweden have made it increasingly necessary to exploit existing technical capacity, regardless of location. Concurrently, companies face new pressures for international coordination and control of R&D. Coordination is required to reduce product differentiation, to facilitate technology transfer and to ensure the technical and market compatibility of products and components developed at different locations but sold as part of total systems. Drawing on the experience in the four investigated companies, the paper discusses how systems and procedures can be developed to meet the need for coordinated international R&D management...|$|R

The growing knowledge-intensity of production reflected in the role of design, research and development, marketing, management and advertising in the growth strategy of the firm, has had numerous consequences for the nature of competition amongst firms and for the internationalization of production. As increased knowledge-intensity of production gave rise to ever more rapid technological change in industry, the need for greater flexibility in production and labour processes became acute, more so as the global economic crisis deepened and competition from newly industrializing countries rose. Automation and sub-contracting were important new strategies. So too was the segmentation and delocalization of production processes to cheap labour countries in the Third World and Eastern Europe. More recently, as the costs and risks involved in R&D escalated, large corporations have also begun to decentralize knowledge production itself by funding research and development activities outside the MNC, and by internationalizing knowledge production itself through the establishment of research laboratories abroad or the implementation of a System of world <b>product</b> <b>mandates</b> for selected manufacturing subsidiaries...|$|R

In the European Union (EU) this regulation envisions the "co-existence" of GM food with conventional and quality-enhanced <b>products,</b> <b>mandates</b> the labelling and traceability of GM products, and allows only a stringent adventitious presence of GM content in other products. All these elements are brought together within a partial equilibrium model of the EU agricultural food sector. The model comprises conventional, GM and organic food. Demand is modelled in a novel fashion, whereby organic and conventional products are treated as horizontally differentiated but GM products are vertically differentiated (weakly inferior) relative to conventional ones. Supply accounts explicitly for the land constraint at the sector level and for the need for additional resources to produce organic food. Model calibration and simulation allow insights into the qualitative and quantitative effects of the large-scale introduction of GM products in the EU market. We find that the introduction of GM food reduces overall EU welfare, mostly because of the associated need for costly segregation of non-GM products, but the producers of quality-enhanced products actually benefit. biotechnology, differentiated demand, genetically modified crops, identity preservation, innovation, welfare. ...|$|R

40|$|This is an {{empirical}} study of initiatives in the subsidiaries of multinational corporations. An initiative is the subsidiary-driven {{creation of a}} value-adding activity. While previous {{research has focused on}} the 2 ̆ 2 world <b>product</b> <b>mandates</b> 2 ̆ 2 earned as a result of initiatives, or the corporate systems that facilitate subsidiary initiatives, this study is concerned with the internal processes that actively drive subsidiary initiatives. This issue is of vital importance to subsidiary managers who {{are looking for ways to}} enhance their value-added role in the corporation: it also has substantial implications for corporate strategy and for theoretical models of multinational management and entrepreneurship.;Two research questions drove this research: 2 ̆ 2 What forms do subsidiary initiatives take? 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 What is the initiative process? 2 ̆ 2 The research was undertaken using an inductive approach, building knowledge from an iterative combination of empirical evidence and theory. A total of 39 initiatives from six Canadian subsidiaries of U. S. multinational corporations formed the final sample. Data was gathered through over 100 personal interviews, but also from two questionnaires and archival and secondary sources.;There were two key findings. First, four distinct types of subsidiary initiatives were identified, labelled 2 ̆ 2 reconfiguration 2 ̆ 2, 2 ̆ 2 local market 2 ̆ 2, 2 ̆ 2 competitive bid 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 mandate extension 2 ̆ 2. These four types were empirically validated, and conceptualized in terms of the market opportunities they tapped into. Second, the initiative process was analyzed in depth, and found to consist of four phases representing the increasing viability of the initiative. The process was found to be strongly influenced by the organizational context of the subsidiary, as predicted by Burgelman 2 ̆ 7 s model of corporate venturing. The key contribution, however, is the observation that the internally-defined subsidiary context is a more critical driver of initiative than the externally-defined corporate context.;The implication for the management of multinational subsidiaries is that the assignment of subsidiary roles has limitations, because it assumes the opportunity set of the subsidiary can be prejudged and better understood from the centre than the periphery. Subsidiaries should have sufficient slack that opportunities can be identified and developed; and they should attempt to build an internal management context to foster the entrepreneurial spirit.

Government regulation of pharmaceutical product quality started in 19061 and has evolved into a stringent system of premarket controls over new drug development and introduction. Several recent studies have examined the effects of these regulatory controls on the costs and development periods for new drug entities, the quantity of drug innovation, and delays in new drug therapies available to consumers. 2 Government laws and regulations indirectly affect the innovation process through the distribution and marketing of pharmaceuticals.

40|$|The paper {{investigates the}} {{determinants}} of the sourcing patterns of foreign-owned multinational subsidiaries in a cross-country European setting. Sourcing decisions (namely, buying locally versus internationally) represent a highly relevant theme for regional and national host economies, given the potential impact these decisions can have on indigenous industrial systems. The subject under analysis attracts considerable attention in regional economics, {{given the importance of}} multinationals 2 ̆ 019 local linkages in generating externalities and technology spillovers and in supporting industrial agglomeration. Additionally, a concern with growing import levels exists, since the globalization of supply chains is creating major competitive pressures for local suppliers, as companies explore global sourcing options. Inter-firm linkages between multinationals and host country suppliers are investigated. The paper is structured as follows: firstly, a thorough literature review on local sourcing, spillovers and regional impact of multinational enterprises is offered. Then, the paper puts forward a general framework of the factors influencing the choice between international and local sourcing, and formulates hypotheses (based on that conceptual framework), on subsidiary roles/characteristics (such as subsidiary age, whether subsidiary was established before or after host country EU integration, entry mode, subsidiary size) and country (home and host) and industry characteristics. Subsequently, an econometric analysis of the main determinants of sourcing decisions is conducted. The empirical setting is multi-country, EU-based. Data result from a large-scale survey of the main foreign-owned subsidiaries in four EU countries (Ireland, Portugal, Spain and the UK). The main contributions of the paper lie in an improved understanding of the influence of foreign-owned subsidiary strategies and economic integration in sourcing patterns, topics on which little research exists. Important conclusions are drawn on the scope to increase local sourcing through policy intervention at national and regional levels. Major findings concern the impact of subsidiary roles and economic integration on sourcing patterns. Regional and global integration are leading to a greater import-orientation among MNE subsidiaries, including high value-added <b>Product</b> <b>Mandate</b> subsidiaries which are assumed to be strongly embedded within host economies. It was found that economic integration (along with age of subsidiary) has a significant impact on sourcing patterns, meaning that subsidiaries established after their host countries 2 ̆ 019 EU accession are less embedded via sourcing; and that subsidiaries in global industries buy less locally, as well as subsidiaries located in small EU economies (that have lower supplying capabilities as the local industry is less diversified). Our results did not find a significant association of subsidiary size, home country and entry mode with the import propensity of the multinational subsidiaries surveyed. This research confirms the significant body of evidence that multinationals have seldom developed extensive input linkages with their host economy, and strengthens the conclusion of previous authors that the potential for local linkages is now significantly reduced as compared with the past. The results cast serious doubts on the effectiveness of traditional criteria for investment attraction; and confirm that stimulating local sourcing is problematic.
