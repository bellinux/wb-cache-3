40|$|The thesis aims {{to draw a}} {{comparative}} picture of some basic features {{of the public sector}} labour market in six important and representative European economies (France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Sweden, UK). Particular attention is drawn upon the current state of earning gaps (public vs. private; female vs. male). Relying upon Eurostat data from the 2006 and 2010 Structure of Earnings Survey, the Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition was applied to various subsets of the workforce. Issues of comparability are emphasized, by poising civil servants against their appropriate counterpart: employees from large private firms, by considering jobs and professional figures within the same sectors (basically NACE’s <b>P</b> (<b>Education),</b> Q (Human health and social work activities), and local utilities), and by considering workers characterized by similar levels of education. Finally, the analysis extends to monthly earnings (going beyond the usually considered hourly earnings). We find a public wage premium for monthly earnings only in UK and Spain, while the usual positive public wage premium is found with hourly earnings also in Italy. Generally, less educated employees working in the public sector fare better (in terms of premium) than their more educated colleagues. As for gender pay discrimination, it exists (against females) both in the public and the private sector, with female civil servants being less discriminated than their private counterparts in Italy, Germany and Spain...|$|E
30|$|As regards {{sources of}} micro data, {{we use the}} “European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions” (EU-SILC) survey, given its {{cross-country}} comparability, data availability for the pre- and post-crisis periods (2004 – 2012), {{and the fact that}} it covers most of European Union countries. Our sample includes all EU 28 countries (with the exception of Bulgaria, Malta, Romania, Finland, and Croatia), as well as Norway and Iceland. The distinction between public and private sector employment is based on NACE (Statistical Classification of Economic Activities), Rev. 2. The most recent data refers to the 2013 EU-SILC wave, which includes employment and earnings information pertaining to 2012. In this framework, as it is standard in the literature, the “government sector” is an approximation based on either the aggregation of the O (Public Administration and Defense, Compulsory Social Security), <b>P</b> (<b>Education),</b> and Q (Health and social work) sectors of the NACE classification (broad definition), or only the O sector (restricted definition). With the EU-SILC database, it is not possible to separate public employees from private sector employees in any of the sectors, being this particularly relevant for activities P and Q, where private providers are more prevalent. 14 In the case of EU-SILC data, the definition of “wages per employee” is computed based on the individual gross monthly earnings (including only monetary earnings and excluding financial income from investments, assets, savings, stocks, and shares) before netting out taxes and social contributions and the number of hours worked per week in the main job. Note also that the self-employed are excluded from the analysis.|$|E
40|$|Sorry, {{the full}} text of this article is not {{available}} in Huskie Commons. Please click on the alternative location to access it. 300 <b>p.</b> <b>Education</b> for peace has centered around the shaping of a global world order characterized by peace and social justice. This historical study of peace education examined the interrelationships of concepts, culture, and curricula in America from 1828 to 1983 through analysis of primary source materials and the writings of educators. Major factors emerged: (1) Journals of the peace societies in the nineteenth century revealed an awareness of the potential for peace education. Separate societies for students and then women were organized. (2) Educators believed that peace education could bring about a transformation in the individual and society. Special focus was on an organization, the American School Peace League (1909 - 1916), which included the publication of curriculum guides. (3) Peace education included an international strand, launched as world citizenship or international friendship in the thirties and forties, refined as world affairs in the sixties, and expanded into global or world order education in the seventies and eighties. (4) Concern for law and order in the international arena was a primary motive for peace educators in the nineteenth century, especially Lucia and Edwin Mead. In the twentieth century, nonviolence as a process shaped world order education. (5) Concern for the child in the writings of educators such as Maria Montessori and Elise Boulding provided a rationale for peace education, the child and his future as a cornerstone for peace. (6) Peace education in the eighties included community education, nulcear war or disarmament education, and global education. (7) Quaker education as a persistent force in peace education was recognized. The following recommendations were made: (1) the development of a long-range plan with a commission of representatives from private, public, and religious organizations to study methods for integration into the public school curriculum; (2) the development of a curriculum balanced between a peace-through-strength defense policy and nuclear disarmament; (3) the integration of the principles of peace education into social studies and history textbooks; and (4) the inclusion of the writings of peace educators in children's literature and language arts textbooks...|$|E
