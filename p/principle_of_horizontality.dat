50|$|Accurate description, mapping, and {{sampling}} for laboratory {{analysis of}} outcrops made possible {{all of the}} geologic sciences {{and the development of}} fundamental geologic laws such as the law <b>of</b> superposition, the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> original <b>horizontality,</b> <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> lateral continuity, and the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> faunal succession.|$|R
50|$|Catholic priest Nicholas Steno {{established}} the theoretical basis for stratigraphy when he introduced the law <b>of</b> superposition, the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> original <b>horizontality</b> and the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> lateral continuity in a 1669 {{work on the}} fossilization of organic remains in layers of sediment.|$|R
25|$|The <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> {{original}} <b>horizontality</b> {{states that}} the deposition of sediments occurs as essentially horizontal beds. Observation of modern marine and non-marine sediments {{in a wide variety}} of environments supports this generalization (although cross-bedding is inclined, the overall orientation of cross-bedded units is horizontal).|$|R
5000|$|The <b>Principle</b> <b>of</b> Original <b>Horizontality</b> {{states that}} layers of {{sediment}} are originally deposited horizontally under {{the action of}} gravity [...] It is a relative dating technique. The principle {{is important to the}} analysis of folded and tilted strata. It was first proposed by the Danish geological pioneer Nicholas Steno (1638-1686).|$|R
5000|$|Folding in sediments is {{analysed}} {{with the}} <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> original <b>horizontality,</b> {{which states that}} sediments are deposited at their angle of repose which, for most types of sediment, is essentially horizontal. Thus, when the younging direction is known, the rocks can be [...] "unfolded" [...] and interpreted according to the contained sedimentary information.|$|R
50|$|Similarly, sediments may {{drape over}} a {{pre-existing}} inclined surface: these sediments are usually deposited conformably to the pre-existing surface. Also sedimentary beds may pinch out along strike, implying that slight angles existed during their deposition. Thus the <b>Principle</b> <b>of</b> Original <b>Horizontality</b> is widely, but not universally, applicable {{in the study}} of sedimentology, stratigraphy and structural geology.|$|R
50|$|There are {{a number}} <b>of</b> <b>principles</b> {{that are used to}} explain the {{appearance}} of stratum. When an igneous rock cuts across a formation of sedimentary rock, then we can say that the igneous intrusion is younger than the sedimentary rock. The <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> superposition states that a sedimentary rock layer in a tectonically undisturbed stratum is younger than the one beneath and older than the one above it. The <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> original <b>horizontality</b> states that the deposition of sediments occurs as essentially horizontal beds.|$|R
50|$|According to Steno's <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> {{original}} <b>horizontality,</b> {{sedimentary rocks}} are normally deposited as horizontal layers. When tectonic movement occurs sedimentary layers can be tilted. under such circumstances, the sedimentary planes {{will have a}} dip (an angle with a horizontal reference plane). When new sedimentary layers are deposited on top of tilted ones, they will have an angle with the older ones, a structure which is called an angular unconformity. Any angular unconformity is prove that a tectonic phase took place between the deposition of the layers below {{and on top of}} it.|$|R
5000|$|As one of Steno's Laws, the <b>Principle</b> <b>of</b> Original <b>Horizontality</b> served well in {{the nascent}} days of {{geological}} science. However, it is now known that not all sedimentary layers are deposited purely horizontally. For instance, coarser grained sediments such as sand may be deposited at angles of up to 15 degrees, held up by the internal friction between grains which prevents them slumping to a lower angle without additional reworking or effort. This {{is known as the}} angle of repose, and a prime example is the surface of sand dunes.|$|R

50|$|The <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> {{original}} <b>horizontality</b> {{states that}} any archaeological layer deposited in an unconsolidated form will tend towards a horizontal deposition. Strata which are found with tilted surfaces were so originally deposited, or lie {{in conformity with}} the contours of a pre-existing basin <b>of</b> deposition. The <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> lateral continuity states that any archaeological deposit, as originally laid down, will be bounded by {{the edge of the}} basin of deposition, or will thin down to a feather edge. Therefore, if any edge of the deposit is exposed in a vertical plane view, a part of its original extent must have been removed by excavation or erosion: its continuity must be sought, or its absence explained.|$|R

50|$|Graded bedding is a sorting of {{particles}} according to clast {{size and shape}} on a lithified horizontal plane. The term is an explanation as to how a geologic profile was formed. Stratification on a lateral plane is the physical result of active depositing of different size materials. Density and gravity forces in the downward movement of these materials in a confined system {{will result in a}} separating of the detritus settling with respect to size. This will result in less dense, higher porosity clasts at the top and denser, less porous clasts consolidated on the bottom, in what is called normal grading. Inversely graded beds are composed of large clasts on the top, with smaller clasts on the bottom. Grades of the bedding material are determined by precipitation of solid components compared to the viscosity of the medium in which the particles will precipitate from. Steno’s <b>Principle</b> <b>of</b> Original <b>Horizontality</b> explains that rock layers form in horizontal layers over an underdetermined time scale and depth. Nicholas Steno first published his hypothesis in 1669 after recognizing that fossils were preserved in layers of rock (strata).|$|R

40|$|Abstract: We {{discuss some}} aspects of the topological {{features}} of a non-interacting two (1 + 1) -dimensional Abelian gauge theory in the framework of superfield formalism. This theory is described by a BRST invariant Lagrangian density in the Feynman gauge. We express the local and continuous symmetries, Lagrangian density, topological invariants and symmetric energy momentum tensor of this theory in the language of superfields by exploiting the nilpotent (anti-) BRST- and (anti-) co-BRST symmetries. In particular, the Lagrangian density and symmetric energy momentum tensor of this topological theory {{turn out to be the}} sum of terms that geometrically correspond to the translations of some local superfields along the Grassmannian directions of the four (2 + 2) -dimensional supermanifold. In this interpretation, the (anti-) BRST- and (anti-) co-BRST symmetries, that emerge after the imposition of the (analogue <b>of)</b> <b>horizontality</b> condition(s), play a very important role...|$|R
