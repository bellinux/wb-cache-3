Field measurements and theoretical modelling tested against and driven by the field data were carried out. The field data were collected during several field campaigns comprising a multi-bar coastal zone.

These velocities occurred even during almost <b>perpendicular</b> wave <b>incidence.</b> On a second front, the cross-shore currents were found to be much depth-variable, with the velocities sometimes directed seawards at the bar crest and landwards at the bar trough. The phase-resolving sediment transport computations incorporated a three-layer model with the bedload layer based on the water-soil mixture theory and two sub-layers of suspended load. This sediment transport model was nested in the phase-averaged modelling framework of hydrodynamics. Sea bed changes were calculated from spatial variability of the net sand transport rate.

40|$|This report {{describes}} {{a method for}} measuring the reflection coefficient in situ for <b>perpendicular</b> sound <b>incidence.</b> The impulse response is measured {{in front of a}} surface. In this experiment the surface is an outdoor building facade. A freefield impulse response is subtracted from the measured impulse response, canceling the direct impulse in the measured response. This results in an impulse response for the reflected sound. To avoid parasitic reflections, the reflected impulse response is multiplied with a time window of suitable size. The frequency response of the direct and reflected impulse response is obtained by fast Fourier transform of the windowed time signals. The reflection coefficient is calculated by dividing the absolute value of the frequency response of the reflected signal with the absolute value of the frequency response of the freefield signal. The absorption coefficient is found by subtracting the reflection coefficient from one, and average over the desired frequency bands. Here one third octave frequency bands are used. The method proves to be valid for measuring the reflection coefficient of building facades in a frequency range from 250 Hz to 2500 Hz.
