40|$|Objectives: Besifloxacin {{is a new}} {{fluoroquinolone}} {{in development}} for ocular use. We investigated {{its mode of action}} and resistance in two major ocular pathogens, Streptococcus <b>pneumoniae</b> <b>and</b> Staphylococcus aureus, and in the reference species Escherichia coli. Methods: Primary and secondary targets of besifloxacin were evaluated by: (i) mutant selection experi-ments; (ii) MIC testing of defined topoisomerase mutants; and (iii) inhibition and cleavable complex assays with purified S. <b>pneumoniae</b> <b>and</b> E. coli DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV enzymes. Results: Enzyme assays showed similar besifloxacin activity against S. <b>pneumoniae</b> gyrase <b>and</b> topoi-somerase IV, with IC 50 and CC 25 of 2. 5 and 1 mM, respectively. In contrast to ciprofloxacin and moxi-floxacin, besifloxacin was equally potent against both S. <b>pneumoniae</b> <b>and</b> E. coli gyrases. DNA gyrase was the primary target in all three species, with substitutions observed at positions 81, 83 and 87 in GyrA and 426 and 466 in GyrB (E. coli numbering). Topoisomerase IV was the secondary target. Notably, resistant mutants were not recovered at 4 -fold besifloxacin MICs for S. aureus <b>and</b> S. <b>pneumoniae,</b> <b>and</b> S. aureus topoisomerase mutants were only obtained after serial passage in liquid medium. Besifloxacin MICs were similarly affected by parC or gyrA mutations in S. aureus <b>and</b> S. <b>pneumoniae</b> <b>and</b> remained below 1 mg/L in gyrA–parC double mutants...|$|R
