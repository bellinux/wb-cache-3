The coating media contain different active and binding agents, composed of organic and anorganic components. The coating is heated and pyrolysed during the hardening process. The investigations of the emitted reaction products were carried out with two alkyde resin paints selected with respect to superior infrared absorption. Aerosol and organic emission products were sampled by means of filters and absorption media during laser processing and subsequently analysed. In addition the pyrolysis was simulated and the emitted organic products were immediately analysed by a GC/MS-system.

The {{idea of using}} microwaves for process intensification is that the direct heating of the reactants with microwaves can lead to fast and homogeneous heating to reduces the energy consumption and give each molecule the same processing experience. Two poly-esterification reaction systems were studied: first was maleic- and <b>phthalic</b> <b>anhydrides</b> with propylene glycol, and second maleic anhydride with hexamethylene glycol. Experiments were conducted in different microwave applicators, as CEM Discover, CEM MARS and Sairem INTL, {{as well as with}} conventional heating (oil bath and with an electric heating mantle). The hypothesis was that microwaves can accelerate reaction rates, increase conversion, improve the end product quality and quantity and save energy. Conversion, reaction time, molecular weight and polymer structure, and the quantity of by-products (i. e. water) obtained from different microwave applicatorswere compared with conventional heating. Comparison of power consumption of microwave reactor systems with two different types of applicators, multimode cavity and internal transmission line technology, to conventionally heated reactor was made and presented. Different reaction vessel sizes (1 and 2 liters) were used to investigate whether this can improve the removal of the by-product. The reaction was performed under nitrogen atmosphere or under vacuum at the time when water is produced in order to increase water removal. Different catalysts were tested to discover which catalyst has the best influence on the reaction, and to see, specifically, the difference in performance between microwave heating and conventional heating. Forced cooling of the reactor vessel was used so higher power levels could be applied without increasing the bulk temperature in the reactor.

40|$|The Rhodium catalyzed maleinisation of {{monounsaturated}} {{fatty acids}} leads to cyclic 3, 6 -disubstituted- 1, 2, 3, 6 -tetrahydro-phthalic acid derivatives and acyclic maleinated byproducts, which {{are similar to}} the products formed by Ene-reaction. Two different catalysts, RhCl 3 (H 2 O) 3 and Rh(OAc) 2, were investigated. It was found that Rh(OAc) 2 shows a higher selectivity toward the cyclic products as well as higher conversions compared to RhCl 3 (H 2 O) 3. Furthermore it was observed that the double bond configuration of the fatty acid influences the yields and the product composition of the maleinated products. The Rh(OAc) 2 -catalysis leads mainly to the cyclic THPAs. If the cis-configurated oleic acid is used, one cyclic main product is formed, whereas the trans-configurated elaidic acid leads to three different isomers. Furthermore a decrease of the overall yield of the maleinated products was observed for elaidic acid, compared to oleic acid. In contrast to that, the RhCl 3 (H 2 O) 3 -catalyst tends to result favorably {{in the formation of the}} acyclic products. If oleic acid is used, the formation of two different constitutional syn-isomers was observed. In addition to that the maleinisation of elaidic acid gives also the anti-form, so that four different products could be detected by NMR-experiments. Practical applications: Fatty acid based 3, 6 -disubstituted- 1, 2, 3, 6 -tetrahydro-phthalic acid (THPA) derivatives are promising monomers for polycondensation processes. The substructure of the six-membered carbon ring is of great interest for the hardness of the resulting polyesters. The mentioned THPA derivatives are commonly synthesized via Diels-Alder reaction of conjugated fatty acids and maleic anhydride. The main disadvantage of this synthesis route is caused by monounsaturation of many natural fatty acids, e. g., oleic acid, or by the non-conjugation of the most natural fatty acids, e. g., linoleic acid which requires a further step for conjugation. The Rh-catalyzed maleinisation enables the synthesis of such cyclic structures using monounsaturated fatty acids, e. g., oleic acid. The resulting THPAs are considered to be biobased substitutes with good prospects, e. g., for <b>phthalic</b> acid <b>anhydride,</b> trimellitic acid and their di-, tetra-, or hexahydro-derivatives, which are commonly used in polycondensation processes. These fatty acid based THPAs may open the door towards new advanced biobased products, e. g., for lacquers and coatings...|$|R
