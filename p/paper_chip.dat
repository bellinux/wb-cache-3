As {{machining}} technology develops toward the unmanned and automated system, {{the prediction of}} chip breaking is considered increasingly important, especially in continuous machining such as in cutting aluminum alloys. In this <b>paper,</b> <b>chip</b> breakers with different parameters are designed to produce chips that can be evacuated easily and reliably from the working zone. The formulation of chip up-curl radius is constructed through analyzing the chips subject to chip breaker. The predictive model of chip breaking is developed based on chip breaking conditions. Chip breaking strain is obtained by using backward-deducing method and cutting experiments. In order to verify the model, PCD tools with chip breakers are used to cut LY 12, chip breaking areas are compared with those obtained from the predictive model. Results show the chip breaking predictive model is reasonable...|$|E

40|$|Microfluidic is a {{relatively}} new but highly interdisciplinary research area. The most obvious advantages of microfluidic are small sample requirement and fluidic flow in micro channels. As a platform, microfluidic is commonly used to carry out many physical, chemical and biological experiments. In medical diagnostics, especially point of care test, microfluidic has a great potential to become a powerful tool. As a relative new research area, the development microfluidic has last for more than ten years without any indication of decadency. Researches on how to fabricate reliable microfluidic devices with multiple functions never stop. With new functional materials introduced into this area, new method invented in microfluidic chip fabrication, more complex structural microfluidic devices integrated with more and more complicated functions integrated spring up like mushrooms. In this thesis, a new fabrication method and three new functional materials are introduced. Laser cutting technology provides many advantages such as fast, low cost, simplicity, lower expertise requirement, and multiple-material compatibility. It has been wildly used in industrial fabrications. With the invention of high-precision laser cutting machines, implement of this technology into microfluidic devices fabrication largely could largely shorten the fabrication time and lower the cost of researches.

Wax chip could be wildly used in experiments which concerning about the effect on bioactive molecules. Furthermore, wax chip adopts a reverse thermal bonding technology which offers a fast way to realize 3 dimensional structures with electrodes integrated.

AZ 91 D magnesium alloy was refined by Er and its microstructural evolution was investigated during semi-solid isothermal treatment. The results show that Er can improve the feature of cast structure and decrease the grain size. Moreover, the γ-Mg 17 Al 12 phase is well refined and disperses in the α-Mg matrix. A semisolid microstructure with small and spheroidal primary particles can be obtained after partially remelting. With increasing heating temperature, the dissolution of eutectic Mg 17 Al 12 phase first took place, resulting in the primary dendritic grains coarsening into interconnected non-dendritic grains. With heating continuously, the residual interdendritic γ-Mg 17 Al 12 {{at the edges of}} the primary grains melted in succession and the primary grains separated into small polygon grains. During the semi-solid isothermal treatment, the amount of liquid increased until the solid-liquid system reached its equilibrium state.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis project is to {{demonstrate}} and evaluate an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) on a paper microfluidic device platform. The integration of ELISA technology onto paper microfluidic chips allows for a quantitative detection of stroke biomarkers, such as glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). Dye experiments were performed to confirm fluid connectivity throughout the 3 D chips. Several chip and housing designs were fabricated to determine an optimal design for the microfluidic device. Once this design was finalized, development time testing was performed. The results confirmed that the paper microfluidic device could successfully route fluid throughout its channels at a reasonable rate. For the biochemistry portion of this thesis project, antibodies were selected to target the intended stroke biomarker: GFAP.

40|$|Machining along {{continuous}} circular tool-path trajectories avoids tool stoppage {{and even}} feed rate variation. This helps particularly in high-speed milling {{by reducing the}} effect of the machine tool mechanical structure and cutting process dynamics. With the increase in popularity of this machining concept, the need for detailed study of a valid chip formation in circular end milling is becoming necessary for accurate kinematic and dynamic modeling of the cutting process. In this <b>paper,</b> <b>chip</b> formation during circular end milling is studied with a major focus on feed per tooth and undeformed chip thickness along with their analytical derivations and numerical solutions. At first, the difference in the feed per tooth formulation for end milling along linear and circular tool-path trajectories is presented. In the next step, valid formulation of the undeformed chip thickness in circular end milling is derived by considering an epitrochoidal tooth trajectory {{with a wide range of}} the tool-path radius. The complex transcendental equations encountered in the derivation are dealt with, by a case-based approach to obtain closed-form analytical solutions. The analytical solutions of undeformed chip thickness are validated with results of numerical simulations of tool and tooth trajectories for circular end milling and also compared to the linear end milling. The close resemblance between analytical and numerical calculations of the undeformed chip thickness in circular end milling suggests validity of the proposed analytical formulations. As a case study, the cutting forces in circular end milling are calculated based on the derived chip thickness formulations and an existing mechanistic model. The calculation results reiterate the need of taking into account adjusted feed per tooth and valid chip thickness formulations in circular end milling, especially for small tool-path radii, for more realistic process modeling.
