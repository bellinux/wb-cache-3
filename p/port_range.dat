40|$|Abstract—As the IPv 4 address pool {{is being}} exhausted, it becomes urgent {{to find a}} way to migrate IPv 4 network {{architectures}} to IPv 6, or to reduce the use of IPv 4 addresses. In this paper, we discuss a strategy known as “Address + Port ” translation, which consists in several users sharing the same IPv 4 address and being distinguished by a range of port numbers. Of critical importance for the feasibility of such a mechanism is the knowledge of the minimum number of ports to allocate to users so that no service degradation is perceived. To that extent, we analyse the port consumption of the most port-consuming Internet applications, web browsing, and present some aggregate port consumption curves for the student population of our campus. Our results suggest that a <b>port</b> <b>range</b> of 1000 ports is totally transparent to users (which would allow to share a single IPv 4 address among 64 users), while 400 ports (i. e., 150 users per address) is sufficient for most of users. Finally, the number of users per address could be further improved by benefiting from statistical multiplexing, i. e., using dynamical instead of fixed <b>port</b> <b>range</b> allocation...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis study {{discusses}} the structural changes in port cargo flow distribution in Asia and traffic inequality in Asian container port systems, by conducting an inequality decomposition {{analysis of the}} Gini index. Specifically, port systems considered here comprise 229 container ports, which were classified into fifteen port ranges according to their geographic locations and annual port container traffic data from 1980 to 2009. The results confirmed the trend of shrinking inequality all in all. Progress in port development in Asia allowed us to confirm similar trends for each <b>port</b> <b>range</b> from a time series estimation. The result also revealed the trend of expanding inequality between pairs of port ranges, {{such as those of}} China and Southeast Asia. The following structural changes were observed: (a) the trend of shrinking inequality within/between port ranges due to regional port developments in Japan, (b) the trend of slightly shrinking inequality within/between port ranges in South Korea and Taiwan due to policy-concentrated investments at limited container ports, and (c) the changes in the center of gravity of container movements and inter-port competition within Chinese and Southeast Asian <b>port</b> <b>range</b> groups, owing to the increase in container handling volumes at all ports for specific port ranges. As a result, the comparative differences in the pace of economic growth and port investments in Asia have produced changes in inequalities...|$|E

Besides an improved insight in the spatial structure of the hinterland, this analysis can deliver a set of areas which can be used in economic models.
