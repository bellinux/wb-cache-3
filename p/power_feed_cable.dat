High quality, high growth rate epitaxy silicon {{can be obtained}} at low temperature using VHF PECVD. The major source of the film uniformity appears to be voltage distribution across the plasma electrode, and the uniformity could be improved by using double symmetric <b>power</b> <b>feed</b> using shielded <b>cable.</b> Use of double symmetric <b>power</b> <b>feed</b> around {{the center of the}} plasma electrode greatly reduced the voltage non-uniformity, and the shielded cables made stable power transport.

40|$|In motor {{vehicles}} {{the power and}} information are distributed by their own separate wiresand the amount of wires over the past decades has increased tremendously due to theever increasing electronics onboard. Solely the average weight of the wires has increasedfrom 4 to 91 kg over the last 50 years and it is therefore clear that a remedy to theever increasing wiring is needed. A possible solution to this could be to introducepower line communication (PLC) onboard a vehicle. The PLC aims at overlaying theinformation {{on top of the}} already existing <b>power</b> <b>feed</b> <b>cables</b> and thus eliminating theneed of dedicated wires for communication purposes. The PLC solution would thussimplify the wiring network to a bare minimum, since no additional wires besides thepower cables are needed. During this thesis work the PLC technology was studied as a possible cost and qualityreform of the powertrain sensor network, where it could be used to both reduce the costof wires and increase the system reliability. A theoretical background study was rst performed to investigate the limitations andpossibilities of the PLC implemented in a vehicle, and the PLC technology was alsotested upon the DC-lines of an e 6 Volvo FMX truck, between the post catalytic NOxsensor and the ACM with two CAN protocol based PLC modems. The throughput, noiseand the scalar voltage gain was measured in this link with the ignition key at dierentpositions to test dierent modes of operations. It was shown that this particular link hada clear low pass characteristics with severe voltage attenuation without any signicantdierence caused by the dierent modes of operation. The severe characteristics of thelink did result into a fault connement mode of the CAN based PLC modems wheretheir communication capabilities were inhibited, which shows that at least with thisparticular link, reliable communication was not possible with the equipment at hand. Short EMC measurements were also carried out regarding the radiated emissions. Theresults showed that the PLC technology implemented in the existing wiring architecturecould be a possible cause of EMC problems if no counter actions are been taken intoaccount. Some of the economical aspects were also investigated, but most of the results were leftas hypothetical assumptions. A detailed cost saving analysis was nevertheless made onthe EATS-wire harness where the savings were estimated to be 1 e. It is the hope thatthese calculations {{could be used as a}} sounding board for future PLC wire harness costanalysis...|$|R

40|$|The {{telecommunication}} engineering {{field is}} playing {{a big role in}} the technology revolution, with most new technologies, smart phones and computers etc requiring 3 G internet connection to be constantly in communication worldwide. A high spectral efficiency spectrum and maximising the number of users and transmission rate within a frequency band are the most critical design objectives and challenge to improve the reliability and performance of wireless communications systems. The use of the Extremely Low Frequency (ELF) band has largely been confined to submerged submarine communications and its application to civilian data transmission has been neglected. ELF signals propagate through the ground itself using earth rods for long distances without regeneration compared to Radio Frequency (RF). There are two major noise sources in the ELF band, namely flicker noise (1 /f) and 50 Hz radiation of <b>power</b> <b>feed</b> <b>cables</b> underground. This thesis has described the theoretical aspects of adopting the ELF band and the ground itself as transmission medium in a communication link based on Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplex (OFDM scheme. The use of 16 -Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (16 -QAM) and OFDM in ELF link enhances the transmission capacity at such low frequencies and reduces the multi-path interference. The link could handle at least 1000 bit/s (bps) and replace the complexity and reduces the power needed for RF link in some applications. This thesis investigated the practical implementations of Binary Amplitude Shift Keying(BASK), 8 -Phase Shift Keying (8 -PSK) and 16 -QAM with 20 Hz carrier and a data rate of 4 symbols/s from context to practice using Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). The highly flexible nature of FPGAs allows the systems designers to integrate any signal processing function. FPGAs replace the use of Digital Signal Processing (DSP) processors in many applications. Very high speed circuit Hardware Description Language (VHDL) language, Matlab, Altera DSP Builder and Altera Quartus II were used to design the ELF link. A thorough literature review showed that demodulating phase data is generally performed using carrier recovery. The current technology generally incorporates a complex mathematics ‘tan’ function and Costas loop to detect the phase changes of the 8 -PSK and 16 -QAM signals. The 8 -PSK and 16 -QAM are widely used in Wide-band Code Division Multiple Access (WCDMA), High-Speed Download Packet Access (HSDPA), World wide Inter-operability for Microwave Access (WiMAX) and Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) Broadband wireless access technologies. Alternative method has been proposed to use cross correlation to detect the phase modulated data. Patent literature review showed {{that there is no such}} patent or known prior art related to the proposed technique. This novel technique does not extract the carrier for demodulation purposes and offer improved phase detection performance as well as superior resistance to Additive-White-Gaussian-Noise (AWGN) compared to a carrier recovery scheme operating at low Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR). The proposed demodulation scheme significantly reduces the implementation resources to demodulate 8 -PSK and 16 -QAM. As a consequent, this technique will yield cost reduction in products using 8 -PSK and 16 -QAM demodulators, namely Broadband internet and Digital TV. Furthermore, the cross correlations would have potential impacts on the development of ELF link using OFDM scheme that would require significantly less resources compared to recent OFDM systems...|$|R
40|$|Pulsewidth {{modulated}} (PWM) inverters {{are one of}} {{the major}} causes of motor bearing failure in inverter-motor drive systems. The new switching devices, such as the IGBT’s, characterized by high switching frequencies and faster switching times, on one side have increased the efficiency, performance and controllability of adjustable speed drives but, on the other side, have brought some relevant drawbacks. In fact, the output voltage from the inverter is not purely sinusoidal and, in particular, steep front pulses can be generated in correspondence to the commutations of switching devices. The presence of high frequency harmonics causes an uneven voltage distribution along motor windings, producing critical stresses on the motor electrical insulation; furthermore the steep pulses can excite the capacitive coupling between the stator and the rotor, resulting in shaft voltages. The latter may cause the breakdown of the lubricating film in the bearings, and the associated electric discharge machining (EDM) currents can damage the bearing and reduce its lifetime. For design purposes it seems of major importance to predict the electrical stresses on the lubricating film of rolling bearings. The present paper is dedicated to the presentation of results of numerical simulations carried out on a traction motor obtained by implementing a Multiconductor Transmission Line (MTL) model of the overall system composed of the <b>power</b> voltage, the <b>feeding</b> <b>cable,</b> the motor stator winding, the rotor shaft and the bearings.

40|$|In this article, {{the design}} of a ultra-wideband (UWB) {{monopole}} antenna with coplanar-waveguide (CPW) -coupled-fed is presented. The antenna is composed of a trapezium patch with a CPW-fed printed {{on one side of the}} substrate and an elliptical radiator on the other side. By simply cutting slits on the radiation patch, a single, dual, and triple band notched characteristics can be achieved. Parametric studies on the antenna and slits are carried out by computer simulation. Results show that the notch frequencies can be set by using dimensions of the slits. The antennas are designed and optimized using computer simulation. For verification, the antennas with single and dual band-notched characteristics are fabricated and measured.
