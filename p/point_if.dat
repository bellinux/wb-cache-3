5|$|A level ends {{when all}} of the point-scoring objects are gone - either lost down the drain, cleaned by sponges/brushes, eaten by roaches, or absorbed by the bubble. At this <b>point,</b> <b>if</b> the bubble is large enough to have a {{complete}} face, the player moves on to the next level; otherwise, one life is lost and the level must be replayed. In addition, whenever the bubble has a face, the drain flashes green, giving the player a chance to enter it and skip the next level. Entering the drain while the bubble is too small costs one life.|$|E
5|$|Diagnostic imaging by CT scan and MRI is {{recommended}} after a first non-febrile seizure to detect structural problems {{in and around}} the brain. MRI is generally a better imaging test except when bleeding is suspected, for which CT is more sensitive and more easily available. If someone attends the emergency room with a seizure but returns to normal quickly, imaging tests may be done at a later <b>point.</b> <b>If</b> a person has a previous diagnosis of epilepsy with previous imaging, repeating the imaging is usually not needed even if there are subsequent seizures.|$|E

5|$|On 24 April 1854 a capsized ship's boat {{bearing the}} name Bella was {{discovered}} off the Brazilian coast, together with some wreckage but no personnel, and the ship's loss with all hands was assumed. The Tichborne family were told in June that Roger must be presumed lost, though they retained a faint hope, fed by rumours, that another ship {{had picked up}} survivors and taken them to Australia. Sir James Tichborne died in June 1862, at which <b>point,</b> <b>if</b> he was alive, Roger became the 11th baronet. As he was by then presumed dead, the title passed to his younger brother Alfred, whose financial recklessness rapidly brought about his near-bankruptcy. Tichborne Park was vacated and leased to tenants.|$|E
5|$|Escaping {{the castle}} is made {{difficult}} by shadow creatures {{sent by the}} Queen. These creatures attempt to drag Yorda into black vortexes if Ico leaves her {{for any length of}} time, or if she is in certain areas of the castle. Ico can dispel these shadows using a stick or sword and pull Yorda free if she is drawn into a vortex. While the shadow creatures cannot harm Ico, the game is over if Yorda becomes fully engulfed in a vortex; the player restarts from a save point. The player will also restart from a save <b>point</b> <b>if</b> Ico falls from a large height. Save points in the game are represented by stone benches that Ico and Yorda rest on as the player saves the game. In European and Japanese releases of the game, upon completion of the game, the player has the opportunity to restart the game in a local co-operative two-player mode, where the second player plays as Yorda, still under the same limitations as the computer-controlled version of the character.|$|E
50|$|On the Spot - One {{player is}} chosen {{to answer a}} question. Then, after being shown a vague subject for the question, the other players vote on whether they think the main player will get the answer right. The answerer then scores more <b>points</b> <b>if</b> they answer against how the other players thought they would. The other players then win the <b>points</b> <b>if</b> they are right, and lose the <b>points</b> <b>if</b> they are wrong.|$|R

5|$|Howard {{immediately}} sent messengers {{to summon}} reinforcements from the III Corps (Maj. Gen. Daniel E. Sickles) and the XII Corps (Maj. Gen. Henry W. Slocum). Howard's first XI Corps division to arrive, under Maj. Gen. Carl Schurz, was sent north {{to take a}} position on Oak Ridge and link up with the right of the I Corps. (The division was commanded temporarily by Brig. Gen. Alexander Schimmelfennig while Schurz filled in for Howard as XI Corps commander.) The division of Brig. Gen. Francis C. Barlow was placed on Schurz's right to support him. The third division to arrive, under Brig. Gen. Adolph von Steinwehr, was placed on Cemetery Hill along with two batteries of artillery to hold the hill as a rallying <b>point</b> <b>if</b> the Union troops could not hold their positions; this placement on the hill corresponded with orders sent earlier in the day to Howard by Reynolds just before he was killed.|$|E
5|$|Katarn {{retrieves}} the Valley's {{location and}} travels with Rebel Alliance agent and close friend Jan Ors to Ruusan, the planet {{on which the}} Valley is located. Jerec captures Ors and offers Katarn the choice to execute her or die. The decision Katarn makes here depends on the player's actions within the game up to this <b>point.</b> <b>If</b> Katarn has remained true to the light path he spares Ors, but if he has fallen {{to the dark side}} he kills her. With both paths, Katarn has a final confrontation with Jerec in the Valley of the Jedi's core. If the player chose the light side, the game concludes with Katarn being reunited with Ors and carving a monument to Rahn and his dead father; if the player chose the dark path, the game ends with Katarn becoming the new Emperor.|$|E
5|$|Philip {{probably}} also campaigned in Thrace in late 352 BC, possibly {{after returning to}} Macedon from Thessaly. At this <b>point,</b> <b>if</b> not before, Philip defeated Amadokos and subjugated him, and possibly also expelled Cetriporis from his client kingship. During the campaign, Philip's army reached deep into Kersebleptes' territory and laid siege to the fortress of Heraion Teichos located somewhere near Perinthos, {{on the coast of}} the Propontis (although Buckler places this siege in 353 BC). On learning of the siege, the Athenians voted to dispatch 40 triremes to oppose Philip. However, they then heard that Philip had died (or had been taken ill), so the relief mission never actually sailed. It seems clear that Philip did fall ill during the campaign, but exactly how the campaign ended is unclear. It was probably at this time that Philip took Kersebleptes' son as a hostage to Pella, effectively ending Kersebleptes' freedom of action.|$|E

5|$|Six teams {{competed for}} the T20 title {{which took place}} between 30 July and 21 August 2016. The six teams played each other once in a round robin format; {{followed}} by a finals day at the County Cricket Ground, Chelmsford. The team that finished top of the table during the group stage qualified directly for the final, while the teams in second and third qualified for a semi-final. Both the semi-final and the final were played {{on the same day}} at the same ground. This was a change in format from the original proposal, in which the top four team qualified for the semi-finals. During the group stage, teams scored two points for a win, but gained an additional bonus <b>point</b> <b>if</b> they scored at a run rate 1.25 or more times that of their opponent.|$|E
5|$|The golden point, {{a sudden}} death {{overtime}} system, {{is used to}} resolve drawn rugby league matches in the National Rugby League, Australasia's top competition in the sport. The term is borrowed from the golden goal system formerly employed in association football (soccer). The golden point is used to determine a winner when scores are level {{at the end of}} regular time. Prior to its introduction into the National Rugby League competition {{at the beginning of the}} 2003 season, normal season games were left as draws; in finals matches, 20 minutes extra time ensued (10 minutes each way), with a replay in the event of a draw. If the scores are level at the end of 80 minutes, 5 minutes are played, the teams swap ends with no break, and a further 5 minutes are played. Any score (try, penalty goal, or field goal) in this 10-minute period secures a win for the scoring team, and the game ends at that <b>point.</b> <b>If</b> the scoring event is a try, no conversion is attempted. If no further scoring occurs, the game is drawn and each team receives one competition point.|$|E
5|$|There {{are three}} PvP modes in Vainglory: Standard, {{in which the}} whole map is available, Battle Royale, in which {{progression}} is faster and the battle is limited only to the lane, and Blitz, in which players must gain the most number of points or reach the 15 point score cap in 5 minutes by taking down turrets and killing off Crystal Sentries or the Gold Miner which gives three points each, or by killing other players which gives one <b>point.</b> <b>If</b> a Blitz match were to ever be tied by the 5 minute mark, then {{the first team to}} score the first point in overtime wins. Players can play ranked Standard games to increase their in-game ranking, or casual Standard games, in which their rank is not affected. In the game client, ranked play duration is listed as 25 minutes, whereas casual play is 20 minutes.|$|E

50|$|The Ford Sporting League was a {{short-lived}} reward scheme {{sponsored by the}} Ford Motor Company. Its only season was that of 1970-71. Clubs were awarded a point for every goal scored at home and two points for every goal scored away, but lost 5 <b>points</b> <b>if</b> a player was booked and 10 <b>points</b> <b>if</b> a player was sent off.|$|R
25|$|Dix: If the 9 wins a trick, it {{is worth}} 1 <b>point.</b> <b>If</b> the 9 wins a trick {{with at least one}} other Spade in play, worth 5 points. If the 9 wins a Spade-led trick, {{it is worth}} 10 points. This is {{borrowed}} from Pinochle where in the melding phase, a 9 of trumps is worth 10 points.|$|E
25|$|For example, {{starting}} {{with just two}} distinct points, we can create a line or either of two circles (in turn, using each point as centre and passing through the other <b>point).</b> <b>If</b> we draw both circles, two new points are created at their intersections. Drawing lines between the two original points and one of these new points completes {{the construction of an}} equilateral triangle.|$|E
25|$|The {{most basic}} type of {{convergence}} for {{a sequence of}} functions (in particular, it does not assume any topological structure on {{the domain of the}} functions) is pointwise convergence. It is defined as convergence of the sequence of values of the functions at every <b>point.</b> <b>If</b> the functions take their values in a uniform space, then one can define pointwise Cauchy convergence, uniform convergence, and uniform Cauchy convergence of the sequence.|$|E
50|$|In rubber bridge, a {{partnership}} wins one game {{once it has}} accumulated 100 contract points; excess contract points do not carry over to the next game. A partnership that wins two games wins the rubber, receiving a bonus of 500 <b>points</b> <b>if</b> the opposing side is not vulnerable, and 700 <b>points</b> <b>if</b> the opposing side is vulnerable.|$|R
50|$|The {{points are}} counted after all cards have been played. The play is to 12 points. To win, the {{partnership}} must get exactly twelve <b>points.</b> <b>If</b> the partnership gets more, {{they go down}} to seven <b>points.</b> <b>If</b> the team got no tricks in a hand, the team goes to Porvoo, loses all their points from the previous hands.|$|R
50|$|When a game ends, {{the score}} {{is based on the}} number of squares in each player's pieces on the board (e.g. a tetromino is worth 4 <b>points).</b> <b>If</b> a player played all of his or her pieces, he or she gets a bonus score of +20 <b>points</b> <b>if</b> the last piece played was a monomino, +15 points otherwise.|$|R
