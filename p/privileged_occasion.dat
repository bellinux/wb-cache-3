50|$|The {{symposium}} (plural: symposia) in the Macedonian {{and wider}} Greek realm was a banquet for the nobility and <b>privileged</b> class, an <b>occasion</b> for feasting, drinking, entertainment, and sometimes philosophical discussion. The hetairoi, leading {{members of the}} Macedonian aristocracy, were expected to attend such feasts with their king. They were also expected to accompany him on royal hunts for the acquisition of game meat {{as well as for}} sport. Symposia had several functions, amongst which was providing relief from the hardship of battle and marching. Symposia were Greek traditions since Homeric times, providing a venue for interaction amongst Macedonian elites. An ethos of egalitarianism surrounded symposia, allowing all male elites to express ideas and concerns, although built-up rivalries and excessive drinking often led to quarrels, fighting and even murder. The degree of extravagance and propensity for violence set Macedonian symposia apart from classical Greek symposia. Like symposia, hunting was another focus of elite activity, and it remained popular throughout Macedonia's history. Young men participating in symposia were only allowed to recline after having killed their first wild boar.|$|R

50|$|However tyrannical Strafford's earlier conduct {{may have}} been, his offence {{was outside the}} {{definition}} of high treason. Although a flood of complaints poured in from Ireland, and Strafford's many enemies there were happy to testify against him, {{none of them could}} point to any act which was treasonable, as opposed to high-handed. The copy of rough notes of Strafford's speech in the committee of the council obtained from Sir Henry Vane the Younger, were validated by councillors who had been present on the occasion, including Henry Vane the Elder who did ultimately corroborate them (but nearly disowned his own son for having found and leaked them in the first place), and partially by Algernon Percy, Earl of Northumberland. This was not evidence which would convict in a court of law, and all parties knew this. Strafford's words, particularly the crucial phrase this kingdom, had to be arbitrarily interpreted as referring to the subjection of England and not of Scotland, and were also spoken on a <b>privileged</b> <b>occasion.</b> Strafford took full advantage of the weak points in his attack on the evidence collected. Over and over Strafford pointed to the fundamental weakness in the prosecution: how could it be treason to carry out the King's wishes? The lords, his judges, were influenced in his favour. The impeachment failed on 10 April 1641.|$|E
40|$|Aims: To {{describe}} a regional organization for assessing {{and improving the}} hospital therapeutic patient education programs in terms of involving all stakeholders, setting up an structured process, tools of evaluation and methods of implementation; to present the first outputs. Methods: Design of assessment guidelines and tools based on the Haute Autorité de santé and Institut national de prévention et d’éducation pour la santé 2007 national report. Auto-evaluations and external evaluations by the regional team of therapeutic education programs selected by the working group; textual analysis of these evaluations. Results: 41 auto-evaluated programs including seven with an external complementary evaluation. The five lessons of these first evaluations are: 1) Hospital directions can hardly identify their own programs of therapeutic education, 2) the organization of therapeutic education is emerging in this health care institutions, 3) the therapeutic activity of education is badly identified leading services to consider the whole of medical staff as professionals of therapeutic education, 4) the educational diagnosis is the weakest issue, 5) the external evaluation of the programs is recognized like legitimateby professionals. Conclusion: Following steps are to make this organization sustainable and to refine methods and tools; operationally, the regional team will continue into 2008 external evaluations and will set up the follow-up of the improvements. This topic is a <b>privileged</b> <b>occasion</b> ofjoint work between liberal and hospital medicine...|$|E
