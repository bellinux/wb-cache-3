40|$|We {{introduce}} {{a new class of}} <b>policies</b> for stochastic project scheduling with resource constraints, the linear preselective <b>policies.</b> They combine the benefits of two known classes of scheduling <b>policies</b> for stochastic and deterministic scheduling, viz. priority <b>policies</b> and preselective <b>policies.</b> Priority <b>policies</b> solve resource conflicts by means of a priority list (list scheduling). They have several computational benefits but suffer from the well-known Graham anomalies. On the other hand, preselective <b>policies</b> possess favorable properties such as continuity and monotonicity and thus avoid these anomalies, but computing optimal such <b>policies</b> requires excessive computation time. The new class of linear preselective <b>policies</b> is a subclass of the class of preselective <b>policies.</b> Like priority <b>policies,</b> linear preselective <b>policies</b> use priority lists for their definition. They thus inherit all favorable properties of preselective <b>policies</b> but are far better computationally tractable. We st [...] ...|$|R
