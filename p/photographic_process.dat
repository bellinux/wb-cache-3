25|$|Two very {{important}} daguerreotypes (an early <b>photographic</b> <b>process)</b> were purchased in the 1990s. The first was of African American abolitionist and former slave Frederick Douglass, acquired in 1990. It {{is one of}} only four daguerreotypes of Douglass known to exist. That year, the number of images in the museum's photography collection reached 8,500 objects. Six years later, the NPG obtained for $115,000 the earliest known daguerreotype of abolitionist John Brown, whose 1859 raid on Harpers Ferry helped sparked the Civil War. The portrait was created by African American photographer Augustus Washington.|$|E

25|$|Confederate Lieutenant Robert M. Smith was {{captured}} and imprisoned at Johnson's Island, Ohio. He {{is unique in}} {{that he was able}} to secretly construct a wet-plate camera using a pine box, pocket knife, tin can, and spyglass lens. Smith acquired chemicals from the prison hospital to use for the <b>photographic</b> <b>process.</b> He used the camera clandestinely to photograph other prisoners at the gable end of the attic of cell block four. No other prison had an on-site photographer providing images for the imprisoned to send home. His contribution is well presented in David R. Bush's I Fear I Shall Never Leave This Island: Life in a Civil War Prison (2011).|$|E
500|$|Ben-Hur was {{nominated}} for 12 Academy Awards and won an unprecedented 11. , only Titanic in 1998 and [...] in 2004 have matched the film's wins. The lone category where Ben-Hur did not win was for Best Adapted Screenplay (losing to Room at the Top), and most observers attributed this to {{the controversy over the}} writing credit. MGM and Panavision shared a special technical Oscar in March 1960 for developing the Camera 65 <b>photographic</b> <b>process.</b>|$|E
500|$|Despite {{its initial}} {{rejection}} by critics, Hope proved immediately popular with {{many in the}} then-influential Aesthetic Movement, who considered beauty {{the primary purpose of}} art. Watts, who saw art as a medium for moral messages, strongly disliked the doctrine of [...] "art for art's sake", but the followers of Aestheticism greatly admired Watts's use of colour and symbolism in Hope. Soon after its exhibition poems based on the image began to be published, and platinotype reproductions—at the time the <b>photographic</b> <b>process</b> best able to capture subtle variations in tone—became popular. The first platinotype reproductions of Hope were produced by Henry Herschel Hay Cameron, son of Watts's close friend Julia Margaret Cameron.|$|E

2500|$|Now {{that some}} of the theory has been presented, the actual {{mechanism}} of the <b>photographic</b> <b>process</b> can now be discussed. To summarize, as a photographic film is subjected to an image, photons incident on the grain produce electrons which interact to yield silver metal. More photons hitting a particular grain will produce a larger concentration of silver atoms, containing between 5 and 50 silver atoms (out of ~1012 atoms), depending on the sensitivity of the emulsion. The film now has a concentration gradient of silver atom specks based upon varying intensity light across its area, producing an invisible [...] "latent image".|$|E
2500|$|Steichen {{took the}} {{photograph}} in Mamaroneck, New York near {{the home of}} his friend, art critic Charles Caffin. [...] The photo features a wooded area and pond, with moonlight appearing between the trees and reflecting on the pond. [...] While the print appears to be a color photograph, the first true color <b>photographic</b> <b>process,</b> the autochrome process, was not available until 1907. Steichen created the impression of color by manually applying layers of light-sensitive gums to the paper. Only three known versions of the Pond—Moonlight are still in existence and, {{as a result of the}} hand-layering of the gums, each is unique. In addition to the auctioned print, the other two versions are held in museum collections. The extraordinary sale price of the print is, in part, attributable to its one-of-a-kind character and to its rarity.|$|E

60|$|The {{composite}} portraits {{that will}} next be exhibited {{are made by}} the <b>photographic</b> <b>process,</b> and it will now be understood that they are truly composite, notwithstanding their definition and apparent individuality. Attention is, however, first directed to a convenient instrument not more than 18 inches in length, which is, in fact, a photographic camera with six converging lenses and an attached screen, on which six pictures can be adjusted and brilliantly illuminated by artificial light. The effect of their optical combination can thus be easily studied; any errors of adjustment can be rectified, and the composite may be photographed at once.|$|E

60|$|Since {{my address}} was published, I have caused trials to be made, and have found, {{as a matter}} of fact, that the <b>photographic</b> <b>process</b> of which I there spoke enables us to obtain with {{mechanical}} precision a generalised picture; one that represents no man in particular, but portrays an imaginary figure possessing the average features of any given group of men. These ideal faces have a surprising air of reality. Nobody who glanced at one of {{them for the first time}} would doubt its being the likeness of a living person, yet, as I have said, it is no such thing; it is the portrait of a type and not of an individual.|$|E
60|$|The {{next step}} is to compare this {{portrait}} of two brothers and their sister which has been composed by optical means before the eyes of the audience, and concerning the truthfulness of which there can be no doubt, with a photographic composite of the same group. The latter is now placed in a fourth magic-lantern with a brighter light behind it, and its image is thrown on the screen {{by the side of the}} composite produced by direct optical superposition. It will be observed that the two processes lead to almost exactly the same result, and therefore the fairness of the <b>photographic</b> <b>process</b> may be taken for granted. However, two other comparisons will be made for the sake of verification, namely, between the optical and photographic composites of two children, and again between those of two Roman contadini.|$|E
