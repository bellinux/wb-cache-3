40|$|In {{embedded}} applications, the miniaturization of circuitry and functionality provides {{many benefits}} {{to both the}} producer and consumer. However, the benefits gained from miniaturization is not without penalty, as the environmental influences may be great enough to introduce system failures in new or different modes and effects;Of particular interest within this research {{is the effect of}} fault transients in reduced geometries of <b>printed</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>card</b> interconnect, commonly referred to as fine pitch laminate interconnect. Whereas larger geometries of conductor trace width and spacing may have been immune to circuit failure at a given fault input, the reduction of the trace geometry may introduce failures as the insulating effect of the dielectric is compromised to the point where arcing occurs;To address this concern, a circuit card was designed with fine pitch laminate features in microstrip, embedded microstrip, and stripline constructions. Various trace widths and separations were tested for structural integrity (presence of arcing or fusing) at voltage extremes defined in avionics standard. The specific trace widths in the test were 4 mils, 6 mils, 8 mils, and 12 mils, with the trace separation in each case equal to the trace widths. The results of the tests and methods to artificially improve the integrity of the interconnect are documented, providing a clear region of reliable operation to the designers and the engineering community;Finally, the construction of the interconnect and the results from the test were combined to create an empirical model for circuit analysis. Created for the Saber simulator, but readily adaptable to Spice, this model will describe high-speed operation of a propagating signal before breakdown, and uses data from the experiment to calculate threshold values for the arcing breakdown. The values for the breakdown voltages are correlated to the experimental data using statistical methods of weighted linear regression and hypothesis testing...|$|E
40|$|The {{lithium lens}} in the {{antiproton}} source target vault {{is protected by}} an interlock system, which is located in relay racks R 5 and R 6 near {{the southwest corner of}} the Target Hall (building APO). The interlock system consists of crates of commercial signal conditioner and alarm modules built by Acromag, Inc and interlock Master Modules built by Fermilab: Twenty analog signals from the lens/transformer, power supply, and cooling water system are buffered with signal conditioners (amplifiers), which are located in creates R 5 C and R 5 E. The signals and conditioner assignments are listed in Table 1. Interconnection details are shown in Figure 1. Thermocouple signals come into the conditioners directly from the vault or water system via 12 -pair multiconductor thermocouple extension cables. All other signals pass through a master connection panel on the east end of rack R 6. Water flow signals are AC voltages which must be converted by electronics in crate D 2 B to DC voltages before entering their signal conditioners. Each conditioner drives two parallel outputs. One output goes to a Multiplexed Analog to Digital Converter (MADC 25), which is located in R 5 D. This voltage output is read by the accelerator control network (ACNET) and can be displayed at any control console on parameter page P 46. The other voltage output is connected to an alarm module. Thirteen analog signals are processed by alarm modules, which are located in crates R 6 B and R 6 C. Alarm connection details are shown in Figure 2. Each alarm module contains two DPDT relays, one for an upper limit and one for a lower limit. The relays are latching, so that once an input has passed outside a limit, that limit relay remains in the tripped condition until an operator issues a reset pulse. The reset may be generated locally with a pushbutton on the appropriate interlock master module or remotely from controls parameter page P 46 via ACNET. Alarm settings are summarized in engineering units in Table 1, and actual comparitor voltage settings are listed in Figure 2. Each alarm crate contains 10 module slots and is wired as shown in Figure 3, except for the water conductivity slot, which is wired to a separate interlock chain output. Normally open contacts are used for interlock chains, while normally closed contacts provide status bits. The interlock chain outputs are connected to Interlock Master Modules located in D 5 C. Status bits are read into ACNET through a multiplexer in R 4 A, and can be displayed on parameter page S 40. Any alarm slot may be bypassed by inserting a 'dummy' <b>printed</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>card</b> in place of a module. Each interlock master module sums 5 inputs and provides 3 reed relay contact closure outputs. A circuit schematic is shown in Figure 4. Input 1 requires + 5 volts, and directly energizes an interlock chain relay. Input 2 and 3 require TTL logic levels, and inputs 4 and 5 require and external contact closure. Internal switches select which inputs are active Interlock master interconnections are shown in Figure 5. The lens uses two masters, one for water conductivity and the other for all interlocked conditions. The Conductivity Master controls the lens water purging system and also energizes one input of the General Master. The General Master provides the external interlock for the pulsed power supply. If lithium comes into contact with the cooling water, the conductivity master will trip. Output 2 of the Master shuts off the water circulating pump and initiates purging hardware, which isolates the lens from the water supply and allows inert gas to force remaining water from the lens into a reservoir located in the vault. Output 1 of the Master, which is connected to input 4 of the lens General Master, causes the General Master to trip and disable the pulsed power supply. All other lens alarm conditions (except conductivity) enter input 1 and 2 of the Lens General Master. An alarm condition from these inputs will disable the pulsed power supply, but the water system will remain on. Each interlock master has a manual Emergency Stop pushbutton (red) on its front panel. The pushbutton has alternating action, one push enabling the interlock master, the next push opening the interlock chain. all interlock masters are connected to an audible trip alarm module located in R 5 E- 6...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to analyze the effects of impact loading on electronic component failure. A standard fiberglass composite <b>printed</b> <b>circuit</b> board (PCB) <b>card</b> was used in two impact tests. The first test consisted of a PCB card with four adhered strain gauges, which were mounted inside an aluminum box fabricated for testing. Impact testing was conducted with weights ranging from 0 to 30 lb., and the corresponding strain values were recorded. For the second set of impact tests, a new <b>circuit</b> <b>card</b> was mounted inside the aluminum box. The new <b>circuit</b> <b>card</b> maintained the same dimensions, but no strain gauges were attached. Solder joints were placed at nine different locations on the card, and testing was conducted to determine the impact load at solder joint failure. Both visual and resistance inspections were conducted after each impact. After seven drop tests were conducted, no failure had been detected. This lack of failure was attributed to the rigidity and substantial nature of the aluminum box used in testing. Upon completion of both impact tests, two Finite Element Method (FEM) models were built. The first FEM model represented a scaled version of the PCB card, four solder joints, and a silicon computer chip. Strain data from the PCB card testing was input into the model, and a corresponding solder joint strain was calculated. The second FEM model was a full-scale version of the aluminum box and mounted <b>circuit</b> <b>card.</b> A force was applied to the box, and the various stains were recorded on the PCB card. The collection of this data has helped to establish a valuable relationship between the strains in PCB cards and solder joints, and it will increase the understanding of electronic component failure under impact loading conditions.
