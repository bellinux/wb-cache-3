5|$|The French Revolution was {{integral}} {{to the expansion of}} French cuisine, because it abolished the guild system. This meant anyone could now produce and sell any culinary item he wished. Marie-Antoine Carême was born in 1784, five years before the Revolution. He spent his younger years working at a <b>pâtisserie</b> until he was discovered by Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord, who would later cook for Napoleon Bonaparte. Prior to his employment with Talleyrand, Carême had become known for his pièces montées, which were extravagant constructions of pastry and sugar architecture.|$|E
5|$|Michel {{was awarded}} the Meilleur Ouvrier de France en <b>Pâtisserie</b> in 1976. He {{is a member of}} several orders in France. In 1987, he was {{inducted}} into the National Order of Merit as a Chevalier (knight), and into the Mérite agricole as an officer. In 1990 he was made a Chevalier in the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, and in 2004 the Legion of Honour followed. Outside France he was made an honorary Officer of the Order of the British Empire in 2002 and was made an honorary Doctor of Culinary Arts by the University of Rhode Island in the same year.|$|E
5|$|Michel's {{older brother}} Albert had already become a patissier (pastry chef), and Roux {{followed}} him into this field {{at the age of}} fourteen. He became an apprentice to Camille Loyal in Belleville, working seventy-hour weeks. Michel's tasks at the <b>pâtisserie</b> included making up to sixty Galette des Rois over the course of three days for Epiphany. Albert found Michel further employment as his apprenticeship ended. As Albert was working at the British Embassy in Paris as a sous chef, Michel joined him there as the pastry chef for the Embassy. He moved on from there to become a chef in Philippe de Rothschild's service, while Albert moved to England to work there. Between 1960 and 1962, Michel served his French National Service. He was first stationed at the Palace of Versailles, but was later posted overseas in Béchar, Algeria. He was awarded the Médaille commémorative des opérations de sécurité et de maintien de l'ordre en Afrique du Nord.|$|E
25|$|In 1998, {{burned out}} from the hectic pace, Iuzzini took {{a break from the}} kitchen to travel the world. He visited Hong Kong, Australia and Italy. In France he studied pastry {{technique}} while staging at several of the country's finest patisseries including Ladurée in Paris, École du Grand Chocolat et <b>Patisserie</b> in Tain l’Hermitage, and <b>Patisserie</b> Chereau in Nice, as well as the Hotel Paris in Monte Carlo. After eight months around the world, he returned to New York to work for chef/owner Daniel Boulud, opening Café Boulud and the new Daniel as Executive Sous Chef. In 2001 Boulud promoted the 26-year-old Iuzzini to Executive Pastry Chef.|$|E

25|$|A {{key factor}} {{in the success of}} Italian cuisine is its heavy {{reliance}} on traditional products; Italy has the most traditional specialities protected under EU law. Cheese, cold cuts and wine are a major part of Italian cuisine, with many regional declinations and Protected Designation of Origin or Protected Geographical Indication labels, and along with coffee (especially espresso) make up {{a very important part of}} the Italian gastronomic culture. Desserts have a long tradition of merging local flavours such as citrus fruits, pistachio and almonds with sweet cheeses like mascarpone and ricotta or exotic tastes as cocoa, vanilla and cinnamon. Gelato, tiramisù and cassata are among the most famous examples of Italian desserts, cakes and <b>patisserie.</b>|$|E
25|$|Thus, Beyoğlu {{was one of}} {{the first}} parts of İstanbul to have {{telephone}} lines, electricity, trams, municipal government and even an underground railway, the Tünel, inaugurated in 1875 as the world's second subway line (after London's Underground) to carry the people of Pera up and down from the port of Galata and the nearby business and banking district of Karaköy, where the Bankalar Caddesi (Banks Street), the financial center of the Ottoman Empire, is located. The theatre, cinema, <b>patisserie</b> and café culture that still remains strong in Beyoğlu dates from this late Ottoman period. Shops like İnci, famous for its chocolate mousse and profiteroles, predate the founding of the republic and survived until recently.|$|E
25|$|During his externship at the Culinary Institute of America, Iuzzini {{worked with}} pastry chef Lincoln Carson at Luxe, now Corporate Pastry Chef for Michael Mina's Mina Group {{restaurant}} management company. Carson, who had formerly worked for Francois Payard at Le Bernadin in Midtown Manhattan, coaxed Iuzzini to visit Payard, now {{working at the}} original Daniel on Manhattan's Upper East Side. After spending a day with Payard, Iuzzini was offered a job as pastry chef at Daniel, which he accepted, working weekends until graduation. During the next {{three and a half}} years, he mastered all dessert stations and became Payard's close assistant. When Payard opened his renowned Payard <b>Pâtisserie</b> and Bistro in 1997, Iuzzini was selected as sous chef, while continuing to work at Daniel.|$|E
25|$|A new green {{corporate}} logo which was capitalised as ASDA was also introduced. EPOS barcode scanning checkouts were introduced into refurbished and newly built stores from 1985, {{but it was}} not until 1994, that all stores had updated their IT systems to offer this technology. More upmarket and tastefully decorated stores with soft pastel colour tones, suspended ceilings and zoned areas were built, and introduced to older revamped stores. More specialist fresh food counters such as fresh fish, pizza bars, salad bars, and <b>patisserie</b> counters were brought in to entice more wealthier shoppers. Softer lighting was introduced to stores along with the launch of Asda own-label products in 1986, centralised distribution depots by 1989, and by the end of the decade the 'Asdale'-named clothing range was replaced by the clothing ranges from the newly formed George Davies partnership with Asda. Davies was an experienced and successful entrepreneur who had founded the Next clothing chain of retail stores. These changes were initially positive for the company, but they came at a cost.|$|E

2500|$|Brussels waffles are {{prepared}} with an egg-white-leavened or yeast-leavened batter, traditionally an ale yeast; occasionally {{both types of}} leavening are used together. They are lighter, crisper and have larger pockets compared to other European waffle varieties, and are easy to differentiate from Liège Waffles by their rectangular sides. In Belgium, most waffles are served warm by street vendors and dusted with confectioner's sugar, though in tourist areas they might be topped with whipped cream, soft fruit or chocolate spread. Variants of the Brussels waffles – with whipped and folded egg whites cooked in large rectangular forms – date from the 18th century. However, the oldest recognized reference to [...] "Gaufres de Bruxelles" [...] (Brussels Waffles) by name is attributed from 1842/43 to Florian Dacher, a Swiss baker in Ghent, Belgium, who had previously worked under pastry chefs in central Brussels. Philippe Cauderlier would later publish Dacher's recipe in the 1874 edition of his recipe book [...] "La <b>Pâtisserie</b> et la Confiture". Maximilien Consael, another Ghent chef, had claimed to have invented the waffles in 1839, though there's no written record of him either naming or selling the waffles until his participation in the 1856 Brussels Fair. It {{should be noted that}} neither man created the recipe; they simply popularized and formalized an existing recipe as the Brussels waffle.|$|E
2500|$|The {{new design}} {{features}} a Thames Foyer with a winter garden gazebo under a stained-glass cupola with natural light, {{which is the}} venue for late-night dining and the hotel's famous afternoon tea. The glass dome had been covered since World War II. A new teashop and <b>patisserie</b> is called Savoy Tea, and a glass-enclosed fitness gallery with rooftop swimming pool, gym and spa are located above the Savoy Theatre. The new Beaufort Bar has an Art Deco interior of jet-black and gold and offers nightly cabaret. The River Restaurant (now renamed Kaspar's), facing the Thames, is also decorated in the Art Deco style, but the American Bar is nearly unchanged. The rooms are decorated in period styles harmonised with the adjacent hallways, and they retain built-in wardrobes and bedroom cabinets. The decor is Edwardian on the Thames river side and Art Deco on the Strand side. Butler service was also reintroduced to the hotel. Gordon Ramsay manages the Savoy Grill with Stuart Gillies as Chef Director and Andy Cook as Head Chef. In {{a nod to the}} hotel's origins, six private dining rooms are named after Gilbert and Sullivan operas. [...] The hotel contains a small museum next to the American Bar, open to the public, with a revolving exhibition of items from the hotel's archives. A motor launch is available to take small parties from the Savoy Pier in front of the hotel for champagne river tours.|$|E
