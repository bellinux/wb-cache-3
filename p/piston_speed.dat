25|$|MotoGP-class {{motorcycles}} are {{not restricted}} to any specific engine configuration. However, the number of cylinders employed in the engine determines the motorcycle's permitted minimum weight; {{the weight of the}} extra cylinders acts as a form of handicap. This is necessary because, for a given capacity, an engine with more cylinders is capable of producing more power. If comparable bore to stroke ratios are employed, an engine with more cylinders will have a greater piston area and a shorter stroke. The increased piston area permits an increase in the total valve area, allowing more air and fuel to be drawn into the engine, and the shorter stroke permits higher revs at the same <b>piston</b> <b>speed,</b> allowing the engine to pump still more air and fuel with the potential to produce more power, but with more fuel consumption too. In 2004 motorcycles were entered with three-, four-and five-cylinder configurations. A six-cylinder engine was proposed by Blata, but it did not reach the MotoGP grids. Presently four-cylinder engines appear to offer the best compromise between weight, power, and fuel consumption as all competitors in the 2009 series use this solution in either 'V' or in-line configuration.|$|E

2500|$|The usual {{arrangement}} on {{a compound}} engine {{is that the}} steam is first expanded {{in one or two}} high-pressure (HP) cylinder(s), then having given up heat and losing pressure, it exhausts into a larger-volume low-pressure (LP) cylinder, (or two, - or more), thus extending the cycle. Thus the cylinders can be said to work in [...] "series" [...] as opposed to the normal arrangement of a simple-expansion locomotive where they work in [...] "parallel", the steam being expanded just once in any one cylinder. In order to balance piston thrusts of a compound, the HP:LP cylinder volume ratio has to be carefully determined, usually by increasing the LP cylinder diameter and/or by lengthening the stroke. [...] In non-condensing engines, the HP:LP volume ratio is usually 1:2¼. [...] On geared locomotives, cylinder volumes can be kept more or less identical by increasing LP <b>piston</b> <b>speed.</b> [...] Strictly speaking compound only stands for double-expansion, but the term is loosely applied to any multiple-expansion engine. The instances where railway locomotives have employed triple-expansion with steam going from high-pressure (HP) cylinder, to medium-pressure (MP) cylinder and finally to a low-pressure (LP) one are rare, but triple-expansion engines were very common in steamships in the late 19th/early 20th centuries.|$|E

40|$|Experimental {{measurements}} and theoretical calculations {{were made on}} an aircraft-type, single cylinder engine, {{in order to determine}} the physical nature of the inlet process, especially at high <b>piston</b> <b>speeds.</b> The engine was run at speeds from 1, 500 to 2, 600 r. p. m. (mean <b>piston</b> <b>speeds</b> of 1, 370 to 2, 380 feet per minute). Measurements were made of the cylinder pressure during the inlet stroke and of the power output and volumetric efficiency. Measurements were also made, with the engine not running, to determine the resistance and mass of air in the inlet valve port at various crank angles. Results of analysis indicate that mass has an appreciable effect, but friction plays the major part in restricting flow. The observed fact that the volumetric efficiency is considerably less than 100 percent is attributed to thermal effects. An estimate was made of the magnitude of these effects in the present case, and their general nature is discussed...|$|R
2500|$|Mallards {{world record}} {{has never been}} officially {{exceeded}} by a steam locomotive, though the German Class 05 was at least very close: in 1936, two years before Mallards run, 05002 had reached 200.4km/h (124.5mph) between Hamburg and Berlin. Stoke Bank is long, straight and slightly downhill, whereas the 1936 run of 05002 took place on a horizontal stretch of track. Unlike world records for cars and aircraft, there is no requirement {{for an average of}} two runs in both directions, and assistance from gradient or wind has always been acceptable in rail speed records. Also, unlike Mallard, 05002 survived the attempt undamaged: on the other hand, its train was only four coaches long (197 tons), whereas Mallards train was seven coaches (240 tons). In terms of rival claims, Gresley and the LNER had just one serious attempt at the record, which was far from a perfect run with a [...] permanent way check just North of Grantham. Despite this a record was set. Gresley planned to have another attempt in September 1939, but this was prevented by the outbreak of World War II. Before the record run on 3 July 1938, it was calculated that [...] was possible, and in fact Driver Duddington and LNER Inspector Sid Jenkins both said they might well have achieved this figure had they not had to slow for the Essendine junctions. It is very possible that around 1946, the American Pennsylvania Railroad's T1 class duplex steam locomotive could have attained faster operational speeds than Mallard. However, such claims were not officially verified, thus Mallard continues to hold the official record. The LNER A4 and PRR T1 classes had the same piston stroke and driving wheel diameter, which gave both locomotives the same <b>piston</b> <b>speed</b> for the same track speed.|$|E

50|$|The first marine {{steam engines}} drove paddlewheels. Paddles require a {{relatively}} high axle, that often also forms the crankshaft. For stability the main weight of the engine, i.e. its cylinder, is mounted low down. Later engines drove single screw propellers. These now required a low-mounted drive, but still benefited from the stability effect of a low-set engine. Such early engines, constrained by the technology of the time, worked at low boiler pressures and slow <b>piston</b> <b>speeds.</b> Together with the short piston stroke constrained by lack of space for the engine, these early engines required large diameter pistons {{in order to develop}} enough power.|$|R

A melt flow two-dimensional numerical simulation using a Lagrangian solver, FLOWSOLVE, and an 11 -mode Pom-Pom model satisfactorily matched experimental pressure difference and birefringence fringe distribution for the flow. An algorithm to calculate the specific work accumulated by each fluid element in the complex flow field was implemented within FLOWSOLVE and a method was proposed to estimate the critical specific work for the onset of visible oriented FIC.

40|$|The smoke-wire {{method was}} used to {{visualize}} an oscillating air flow in a gas spring. A harmonic pressure gradient was produced inside of a cylindrical, plexiglas test section by a compressor piston.

It was determined that the smoke-wire technique was not the best method for introducing a photographable tracer into the oscillating air flow, even at very low <b>piston</b> <b>speeds.</b> This was due both to the turbulence of the flow and to the small volume of smoke produced by the wire.

50|$|The {{emphasis}} on long strokes, {{combined with the}} nature of British roads in the pre-motorway era, meant that British engines tended to deliver strong low- and mid-range torque for their size but have low maximum speeds.

Many smaller British cars did not cope well with sustained cruising at 60 mph or more, which led to reliability problems when the vehicles were exported to other markets, especially the United States. Cars such as the Austin A40, the Morris Minor and the Hillman Minx all achieved notable sales in the USA in the late 1940s (after the RAC Horsepower formula had been withdrawn but when car designs were still influenced by it) until the short service life of the engines when asked to routinely drive long distances at freeway speeds became clear.

In the ever increasing demand to increase the efficiency and to decrease the emission levels of the internal combustion engines an attempt is made in this thesis work to increase the fuel efficiency. There are many ways to increase the fuel efficiency like varying compression ratio, downsizing, down speeding, advanced combustion concepts (PCCI, HCCI) etc. but each of the mentioned method comes with challenges. In this thesis work an effort is made to study downspeeding by means of extensive simulation using commercial software GT-Power. By down speeding, the engine is made to run at low speeds and with high torques. For the same power the engine is operated at higher specific load (BMEP) which results in higher efficiency and reduced fuel consumption (BSFC). The reasons for increased fuel efficiency are reduced engine friction due to low <b>piston</b> <b>speeds,</b> reduced relative heat transfer and increased thermodynamic efficiency.
