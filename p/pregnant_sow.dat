2500|$|Ceres was {{credited}} {{with the discovery of}} spelt wheat (Latin far), the yoking of oxen and ploughing, the sowing, protection and nourishing of the young seed, and the gift of agriculture to humankind; before this, it was said, man had subsisted on acorns, and wandered without settlement or laws. She had the power to fertilise, multiply and fructify plant and animal seed, and her laws and rites protected all activities of the agricultural cycle. In January, Ceres was offered spelt wheat and a <b>pregnant</b> <b>sow,</b> along with the earth-goddess Tellus, at the movable Feriae Sementivae. This was almost certainly held before the annual sowing of grain. The divine portion of sacrifice was the entrails (exta) presented in an earthenware pot (olla). In a rural context, Cato the Elder describes the offer to Ceres of a porca praecidanea (a pig, offered before the sowing). Before the harvest, she was offered a propitiary grain sample (praemetium). Ovid tells that Ceres [...] "is content with little, provided that her offerings are casta" [...] (pure).|$|E

The lowest prevalence of abnormal gait in finishing pigs occurred in pigs housed outdoors (3. 4 vs 19. 7 % in indoor-housed finishing pigs) however, the difference was not significant because only three farms in the study housed finishing pigs outdoors. In indoor-housed finishing pigs, there was an increased risk of abnormal gait in pigs housed on solid concrete floors with sparse bedding, partly-slatted floors or fully-slatted floors compared with those housed on solid concrete floors with deep bedding in all areas. However, there were no significant associations between floor type and abnormal gait in gilts. There was an increased risk of abnormal gait associated with increasing callus, bursitis and capped hock score on the limbs of finishing pigs. This might have occurred because limb lesions cause discomfort or because lame pigs spend more time lying and this increases the risk of limb lesions developing...|$|R

Investigation behavior was clearly shown in B pens (67 %) compared with A (52 %) in the first and last weeks of gestation; a high incidence of positive social interactions was recorded in A pens (21 %). Number of sows with lameness was higher in A pens (3, 9 %) compared with B pens (1, 7 %), and the skin lesions of 4, 5 % in B pens. All indicators monitored have recorded changes in both pen types.

The aim {{of the study was}} to give an overview of legs and claws condition and the presence of lameness in sows at one industrial farm. Total 130 animals (90 dry i. e. pregnant and 40 lactating sows) were observed. The occurrence of leg joints swellings, than claws condition (toes length, dew claw condition, cracked wall) and lameness (in animals in group boxes) were visually recorded and then classified according to the appropriate protocols. Findings proved the occurrence of one or more of examined conditions in 40 % of <b>pregnant</b> <b>sows</b> and in 45 % sows in lactation. In more than 20 % of <b>pregnant</b> <b>sows</b> lameness was presented. There was statistically significant positive correlation between the occurrence of lameness and leg swellings and between lameness and claw condition in <b>pregnant</b> <b>sows</b> (in both cases p< 0. 0001).

Therefore the aim of this project was to investigate the effect of increasing dietary fibre levels and providing access to a foraging substrate on the welfare of sows housed in dynamic and static groups. To achieve this a review paper was compiled and three experiments were conducted. The aim of the review paper was to assess the effectiveness of increasing dietary fibre levels on the welfare of <b>pregnant</b> <b>sows.</b> Previous research found that increasing dietary fibre levels decrease activity levels and the performance of stereotypic behaviour, and increase resting behaviour. However, high fibre diets do not appear to reduce aggression between group-housed <b>pregnant</b> <b>sows.</b> The research clearly showed that the effectiveness of high fibre diets is influenced by the source of fibre, with soluble fibres being more effective in reducing stereotypic behaviours than insoluble fibres. However the optimum fibrous ingredient, or combination of ingredients, and the optimum dietary inclusion rate for these ingredients remains unclear...|$|R
