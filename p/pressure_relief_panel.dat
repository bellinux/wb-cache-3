40|$|A {{combustion}} test tunnel designed for continuous operation to 2000 K was assembled. Flow {{quality of a}} Mach 2 nozzle for use with this tunnel was examined using an array of impact probes. The performance of gas shields used to protect optical windows was examined using both shadowgraphs and planar laser induced iodine fluorescence. High speed videography was used to aid in design of <b>pressure</b> <b>relief</b> <b>panels</b> related to hydrogen {{combustion test}}ing safety...|$|R
40|$|An {{accident}} {{scenario in}} the Canadian Pressurized Heavy Water Reactor (CANDU) {{in which the}} flow in one channel is reduced due to an inlet feeder break is considered. Different break sizes are studied and radioactivity released to the atmosphere (1311 and Xe + Kr) in each case is estimated using AECL Computer Codes FIREBIRD, PRESCON, HOTSPOT and CURIES. (The channel with the maximum power of Pickering - B generating station {{was used in the}} analysis as an upper limit best esti-mate). Six break sizes were used in the analysis of discharge rates. These were 6. 45, 10. 97, 12. 26, 12. 9, 14. 2 and 25. 8 cm 2. Only 10. 97 and 12. 9 cm 2 sizes were for further analysis. The activity released from breaks of smaller size than stagnation were found to cause more activity released because the discharge rate of steam from these breaks is less and therefore the building overpres-sure period is longer. That is before the dampers open to <b>relief</b> the <b>pressure</b> to the containment, the fuel would have spent longer time at high temperature, and thus more than the free activity of the channel is released to containment. Both cases of intact (single failure) and impaired;Jual failure) containment are analysed. The activity released to the atmosphere in the event of single failure was estimated to be below the permissible regulat-ory limit. For dual failure (feeder break plus containment impairment), it exceeds this limit. This indicates that unless established means other than the high reactor building pressure signal are employed to open the <b>pressure</b> <b>relief</b> <b>panels</b> and <b>relief</b> the reactor building pressure to containment, the radioactivity released to the atmosphere in the case of dual failure would be more than the permissible limit if such an accident should take place...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn {{this paper}} {{we examine the}} {{trade-offs}} of using or not using pressure-relief {{for a number of}} representative model aquifers. We show that <b>pressure</b> <b>relief</b> increases injectivity {{and the degree to which}} it increases injection rates depends on formation characteristics. The net economic benefit of <b>pressure</b> <b>relief</b> depends on the costs of the scheme and the degree of improvement in the CO 2 injection rates. Where there is only a slight increase in injectivity, <b>pressure</b> <b>relief</b> results in higher costs. However, when there are greater increases in injectivity, <b>pressure</b> <b>relief</b> is of significant net economic benefit. For the cases we examine, the costs of CO 2 injection are 1. 7 to 0. 1 times those without <b>pressure</b> <b>relief...</b>|$|R

40|$|From {{a safety}} standpoint, {{regardless}} of plant or facility type, {{the most important}} pieces of equipment are the <b>pressure</b> <b>relief</b> devices. The most critical characteristics of a <b>pressure</b> <b>relief</b> device are its set pressure and the related relieving capacity. The Set Pressure of a <b>pressure</b> <b>relief</b> device is defined as that value of increasing inlet static pressure at which the discharge becomes continuous (ASME PTC 25 - 1994, Performance Test Codes). To preclude an unsafe overpressure situation, the set pressure of the <b>pressure</b> <b>relief</b> device must not exceed the {{maximum allowable working pressure}} of the equipment or system being protected. Because of testing facility limitations, size or <b>pressure,</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>relief</b> valves intended for elevated temperature service are often set using ambient temperature air. Adjustments are made to the ambient valve opening pressures to compensate for the temperature differences. The extent of the adjustments to the <b>pressure</b> <b>relief</b> valve set <b>pressure</b> is important to ensure the valve will provide the required overpressure protection at the elevated in-service temperature...|$|R
