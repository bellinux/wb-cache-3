5|$|Terrain <b>played</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> {{operations}} around Narva. The elevation {{above sea}} level rarely rises above 100 meters {{in the area and}} the land is cut by numerous waterways, including the Narva and Plyussa Rivers. The bulk of the land in the region is forested and large swamps inundate areas of low elevation. The effect of the terrain on operations was one of channelization; because of the swamps, only certain areas were suitable for large-scale troop movement.|$|E
5|$|The other Great Powers {{immediately}} {{rejected the}} treaty {{out of fear}} that such a large country in the Balkans might threaten their interests.
