50|$|A recent {{controversy}} {{concerns the}} 2003 purchase by one {{organization of the}} UNPA's entire <b>postal</b> <b>archive,</b> including original artwork and artist's proofs.

However, there have been serious allegations that improper procedures approving the sale were followed. Also, resale of items at several times their initial values have apparently occurred, thus raising more questions about the entire matter. As of 2006 the issue remains under internal UN investigation.|$|R
