5000|$|Born in Pimlico, London, Elen {{had worked}} as a barman and a draper's {{assistant}} and had <b>packed</b> <b>eggs</b> <b>for</b> the Co-op before becoming a singer. He began busking at an early age and found a position singing in a minstrel troupe. His solo success began in 1891 when he started performing in public houses, singing songs {{in a manner similar to}} many cockney fruit sellers and ironmongers of the time, known as costermongers. Because of this, he became known as a [...] "coster comedian". For the stage persona he had created, Elen dressed in a coster uniform of striped jersey, peaked cap turned towards one ear and a short clay pipe in the side of his mouth. His characters adopted a persona of being constantly bad tempered and pugnacious. In 1907 he starred in a short film called Wait Till the Work Comes Round.|$|R

40|$|The {{difference}} between progeny from selected and unselected parents (T) was experimentally partitioned into net genetic change (GA), temporary favorable epistatic combinations (GEP) and egg-transmitted maternal environment (M) in two strains of Leghorns selected over 14 years <b>for</b> early pure-strain <b>egg</b> production. Differences among progeny from selected sires and dams, selected sires only, selected dams only, unselected sires and dams and the parental generation were equated to expected GA, GEP and M responses for each trait. Total response was 3. 3 % <b>for</b> early <b>egg</b> number, 3. 7 % <b>for</b> total <b>egg</b> number, 0. 5 % <b>for</b> <b>egg</b> weight, 3. 8 % <b>for</b> early <b>egg</b> mass and 4. 2 % <b>for</b> total <b>egg</b> mass. Among progeny that survived the test period and were {{judged to be}} normal, total response was 2. 6 % for total number of eggs, 3. 0 % <b>for</b> early <b>egg</b> mass and 3. 1 % <b>for</b> total <b>egg</b> mass. The percentage of T attributed to GA was 9 % <b>for</b> early <b>egg</b> number, 24 % <b>for</b> total <b>egg</b> number, 43 % <b>for</b> early <b>egg</b> mass and 47 % <b>for</b> total <b>egg</b> mass; but 52 % <b>for</b> total <b>egg</b> number, 98 % <b>for</b> early <b>egg</b> mass and 71 % <b>for</b> total <b>egg</b> mass of normal survivors. Temporary maternal selection responses (M) were (1) positive <b>for</b> number of <b>eggs</b> and egg masses, (2) greater for all progeny than for normal survivors, and (3) increased with progeny age. The results suggest that M was caused by reduced egg-transmitted disease. Epistatic selection response was positive for earlier sexual maturity and <b>for</b> number of <b>eggs,</b> but negative <b>for</b> <b>egg</b> weight and thus was small <b>for</b> <b>egg</b> masses. Temporary epistatic and maternal responses can explain overestimation of additive genetic response from offspring-parent regression or from replicated single-generation selection and apparent superiority of mass selection over family or combined selection...|$|R

40|$|Capital {{breeding}} {{refers to}} a strategy in which birds use body stores <b>for</b> <b>egg</b> formation, whereas income breeders obtain all resources <b>for</b> <b>egg</b> formation at breeding sites. Capital breeding should occur more in large-bodied species because the relative cost of carrying stores <b>for</b> <b>egg</b> formation becomes smaller with increasing body size. Based on a comparison between stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen in potential prey at wintering sites and eggs, we examined whether greater flamingos use nutrients stored {{earlier in the year}} <b>for</b> <b>egg</b> production. Our results suggest that the greater flamingo is a partial income breeder, since prey <b>for</b> <b>egg</b> formation were obtained both in overwintering sites and at the breeding site. This may be because there are selective pressures for nesting females to lay soon after arriving at the breeding site, which may be facilitated by arriving at the breeding site with developed ovarian follicles. © 2011 The Authors.

40|$|The heat-resistance {{characteristics}} of Salmonella typhimurium Tm- 1, a reference strain in the stationary phase of growth, were determined at several {{temperatures in the}} major types of products produced by the egg industry. The time required to kill 90 % of the population (D value) at a given temperature in specific egg products was as follows: at 60 C (140 F), D = 0. 27 min for whole egg; D = 0. 60 min <b>for</b> whole <b>egg</b> plus 10 % sucrose; D = 1. 0 min for fortified whole egg; D = 0. 20 min <b>for</b> <b>egg</b> white (pH 7. 3), stabilized with aluminum; D = 0. 40 min <b>for</b> <b>egg</b> yolk; D = 4. 0 min <b>for</b> <b>egg</b> yolk plus 10 % sucrose; D = 5. 1 min <b>for</b> <b>egg</b> yolk plus 10 % NaCl; D = 1. 0 min <b>for</b> scrambled <b>egg</b> mix; at 55 C (131 F), D = 0. 55 min <b>for</b> <b>egg</b> white (pH 9. 2); D = 1. 2 min <b>for</b> <b>egg</b> white (pH 9. 2) plus 10 % sucrose. The average Z value (number of degrees, either centigrade or fahrenheit, for a thermal destruction time curve to traverse one logarithmic cycle) was 4. 6 C (8. 3 F) with a range from 4. 2 to 5. 3 C. Supplementation with 10 % sucrose appeared to have a severalfold greater effect on the heat stabilization of egg white proteins than on S. typhimurium Tm- 1.
