40|$|Internationally, the {{delivery}} of vocational education and training is being challenged by increasing skills shortages in certain industries and/or rapidly changing skill requirements. To respond to this challenge, rigid and centralised state bureaucracies are increasingly adopting partnerships between schools and industry as a strategy to encourage school-to-work transition programmes to address the local labour market demand. Drawing on experiences in Australia, this paper reports on {{a case study of}} government led partnerships between schools and industry. The Queensland Gateway to industry schools initiative currently involves over 120 schools. The study investigated how two commonly used <b>partnership</b> <b>principles</b> were understood by the Gateway to industry partners. Twelve school–industry partnerships from four industry sectors were analysed in terms of the principles of ‘efficiency’ and ‘effectiveness’ derived from the public–private partnership literature. The study found that some evidence of partnership activities associated with efficiency and effectiveness may be assigned to Gateway schools projects. However, little evidence was found that the above underlying principles were addressed systematically. Some of these partnerships were tenuously facilitated by individuals who had limited infrastructure or strategic support. Implications are that industry–school partnership stakeholders would benefit from applying <b>partnership</b> <b>principles</b> regarding implementation and management to ensure the sustainability of partnerships...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} the so-called political rationale of the European Union’s (EU) regional {{policy in the}} context of the forthcoming eastern enlargement. The political rationale emphasises a particular type of organisation, involving multiple layers of governance and actors. This organisation is considered important in effectively reducing regional disparities. Regarding the great amount of EU regional funding the candidate states in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) are expected to receive upon accession, capable institutions and structures for handling these funds are vital. Also, it is a crucial part of the EU’s accession criteria. By using Hungary and the implementation of the <b>partnership</b> <b>principle</b> as a case study, the process of preparing for the regional funds in CEE is investigated in-depth. A policy analysis of the cohesion between EU policy objectives and the Hungarian implementation process of the <b>partnership</b> <b>principle</b> serves as the overall basis for the analysis. In order to analyse and understand the implementation process, Historical Institutionalism (HI) is applied as a theoretical framework. It contributes by assessing the factors affecting the implementation process and thus, policy coherence. A triangulation of data consisting of interviews with Hungarian officials and EU Member State experts involved in the implementation of partnership practices, primary and secondary texts as well as basic statistics is made against the propositions formulated through HI. In turn, a number of analytical findings have been discovered. Firstly, the policy process is seen as highly constrained by formal and informal institutional factors, created by historical policy legacies. These have shaped the goals and preferences of the actors involved and have also privileged certain groups over others. In turn, path-dependency is noticed. Secondly, this has made policy cohesion rather weak, with certain short-term requirements being fulfilled but with a lack of more in-depth, long-term measures. Thus, there is a mismatch between the EU and the Hungarian regional policy organisation. Thirdly, although the formal institutional mechanisms for change are rather rigid, indications of informal mechanisms providing possibilities of institutional change were found, with some actors adapting to the EU enlargement context. This could lead to partnership practises gradually infiltrating some ofthe institutional and organizational features and in turn, become strengthened through the multi-level governance structure of the EU. Yet, implementation of the <b>partnership</b> <b>principle</b> is identified as a long and open process, with the real challenges arriving as Hungary enters the E...|$|E
40|$|The <b>partnership</b> <b>principle</b> in the European Union {{has often}} been {{examined}} {{in the context of}} the emergence of a multilevel type of governance. Recently, a number of studies have focused on the implementation of the European Cohesion Policy in the new member states. They have listed the numerous obstacles to its functioning effectively. However, given the shortfalls, they were not in the position to question the entire range of effects of partnership when it does indeed work. Complementary to this approach, this paper starts from the example of a best-practice, looking at the concrete results of the use of partnership to ensure a place-based approach to regional policies. It uses the example of the East-German Land of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, a NUTS II region that benefits from structural funding under the convergence objective. After a brief description of how the <b>partnership</b> <b>principle</b> works on the ground, it examines the conditions of its success. It then analyses its contribution to “good governance”. Lastly, it examines whether this form of partnership rises to the challenge of implementing a place-based approach as defined in the Barca Report. It argues that it neither offers all individuals a chance to become informed and contribute their knowledge or express their preferences about the delivery of projects, which involve the very technical issues of regional development and the disbursement of the structural funds. Nor does it allow control and pressure on policy makers by the citizen. The findings show that, as a consequence, the kind of policies promoted fail to fulfil both the objectives of efficiency and equity...|$|E

40|$|Poland’s {{experience}} from 20 years ago {{shows that the}} labour system not only {{is determined by the}} prevailing economic, social and political system, but also conversely, any changes within it affect the global system. It is therefore recommendable to take more interest in labour system in the area of labour law study and social policy. The notion of labour law system, although already known in the beginnings o f the 20 th c. and currently applied in the social study by the Catholic Church, tends to be understood in a variety of ways. Therefore, the author proposes two definitions of the term, one narrower denoting the work relations within a company and one broader denoting also collective work relations and their axiological assumptions on all levels as well as the relations serving them. First, the author delineates the changes in the labour system in Poland since 1918, focusing upon the labour world’s struggle for the recognition of employee’s status as fi subject in the labour process both under socialist realism and now, until trade unions accepted the social <b>partnership</b> <b>principle</b> as the basic principle fundamental for the labour system, and on to the present time when trade unions have lost their influence and significance. The author then proposes to give all work crews the right to elect organs representing them, authorized to cooperate with the employer on matters related with the employees; the author also suggests that employers’ organisations should be given the same conditions of representing their interests as those granted to trade unions. The two above proposed solutions must be applied because the Constitution of the Republic of Poland recognizes the social <b>partnership</b> <b>principle</b> as fundamental for the social and economic system, which can only be sound and effective if the two above postulates are fulfilled...|$|E

In the context of the EU Structural Funds, greater partnership working between the Commission, the member states and authorities at national, regional and local levels has been encouraged in both {{the development and implementation of}} its programmes (see regulation (EEC) 2052 / 88) 2. This approach is seen by the European Commission as a means of improving the effectiveness of the Structural Funds in reducing social and economic disparities through the inclusion of actors deemed to be most familiar with the problems and priorities of targeted areas (see Thielemann, 1999, 6; Bache and Jones, 2000, 1). The requirement to adopt this approach was initially formalised through the introduction of the EU <b>partnership</b> <b>principle</b> in the 1988 structural fund reforms...|$|E

40|$|The <b>partnership</b> <b>principle</b> {{is one of}} {{four basic}} {{principles}} that governs work with the EU Structural Funds. The principle is supposed to foster a greater involvement of different regional actors in the regional development. This involvement in turn is expected to improve the conditions for growth in the region. This is an analysis of the interpretation of the <b>partnership</b> <b>principle</b> in two regions that belonged to a Regional Objective during the years 1995 - 1999; Gävleborg in Sweden and South Ostrobothnia in Finland. This is studied through an examination of the actors involved in each different phase of the programme. The analysis is based on qualitative interviews performed in both regions. Differences between the countries regarding their regional governance explain some of the different solutions to administrate the programme. Traditions and policies of governance also influenced how the programme was to be implemented. The national rules and regulations and the traditional practices on both national and regional level how to deal with issues regarding development policy largely affected participation in the Regional Objective programme and also determined to a great extent which actors got a role in the implementation of the programme. The programmes in both regions were to be dominated by the regional actors that already previously had a given position in the regional development sphere. Even though the <b>partnership</b> <b>principle</b> especially strives for the involvement of the private and the third sector in the programme the public sector actors had by far the largest part; they created most projects, financed these and also decided on the EU-financing. The co-operation in the partnership forums mostly only concerned the public authorities and the dialogue with the other sectors of society was laconic. The analysis also points at some obstacles that serve as explanations why some, especially smaller actors, found it difficult to participate; the work concerning the Structural Funds developed to a large degree into a world of its own {{and to be able to}} take part in this inner circle a great deal of specialist knowledge of terminology and of the regulations of the Funds was required. This distanced potential actors from participating in the programme. The greatest differences concerning participation between the two regions were that the municipalities in Gävleborg in Sweden had a much larger role in the programme in comparison with the sub-regions in Finland; in South Ostrobothnia, on the other hand, a larger number of different organisations, not necessarily public ones, were involved in the creating of projects.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to provide an insight of Islamic {{securitization}} based on sukuk structures. Design/methodology/approach – Descriptive, analytical, and comparative analyses are used to discuss the risk-sharing behaviour in Islamic securitization through different structures of mudharabah and musharakah sukuk derived from asset securitization. Findings – The paper reveals that although sukuk are structured in a similar way to conventional asset-backed securities, they can have significantly different underlying structures, provisions and shariah-compliant. In particular, it prohibits the receipt and payment of interest and stipulates that income must be derived from an underlying real business risk rather than as a guaranteed return from interest. With regards to sukuk securitization, an asset is one of the vital elements that should exist as an evidence to support the process and make it permissible in Islam. In terms of Islamic securitization mechanism, it can be divided into two principles, namely, debt based and partnership. This paper further emphasizes that sukuk structures based on <b>partnership</b> <b>principle</b> is regarded as risk sharing rather than risk shifting, where it works by combining risk-exposures in such a way that they offset one another to some degree. Accordingly, overall risk will be less than total risks on individual basis. Practical implications – This paper has important implication for the understanding of risk management practices particularly in structuring sukuk. Banks as originators and special purpose vehicles (SPV) as issuers, might consider more sukuk on partnership principles since it directed towards risk-sharing concept that could lead to increase mobilization of savings and investment. As for the investors or sukuk holders, the <b>partnership</b> <b>principle</b> could generate the wealth creation, which to be shared between both investors (fund providers) and issuers (fund users), while both bear the risks involved and the resulting loss. Originality/value – The paper will fill the gap in the existing literature of Islamic finance by showing that Islamic securitization via sukuk is a viable source of funds that could help stabilize the securities market, and as solution to the current subprime mortgages financial crisis.

The sustainable evolution of an emergent economy could be framed in a corporate model, highlighting one of the ideas Joseph Schumpeter rounded in his academic research, the idea that a corporate model can better protect a nation, region or state union by decreasing the need of an intervention through government action and only by maintaining a connection between market ’ needs and the private sector, having as result a smoother demand cyclicity.

However, mismatched expectations and gaps in the way industry partners (IPs) are supported during these work placements can place these high-stake alliances at risk.
