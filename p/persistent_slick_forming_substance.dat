For the crude oil experiments, microwave radiometric measurements at 1. 43, 2. 65, 22, and 31 GHz are reported, along with the variable incidence angle scattering measurements at 13. 9 GHz. For these experiments, unusual depressions in the L-band brightness temperature were observed, possibly related to dispersants applied to the crude oil. Similar depressions, but with much larger values, were observed over the oleyl alcohol monomolecular slicks. Images obtained at 31 and 22 GHz were used to infer oil volume, yielding values which bound the known amounts spilled.

40|$|A field {{experiment}} {{was performed to}} determine the effects of using humic acid with irrigation on quantitative and qualitative yield traits of sugar beet grown on calcareous soils in Esfaraen, located in the North-East of Iran. Treatments consisted of three levels of humic acid concentration (zero or control, 2. 5 and 5 L ha - 1) and the number of applications (once 45 days after planting; twice, 45 and 75 days after planting; three times, respectively 45, 75 and 105 days after planting). The effect of the two experimental factors on sugar beet yield traits such as the content of sucrose, refined sugar, molasses <b>forming</b> <b>substances,</b> root yield and refined sugar yield were evaluated. The results proved the existence of a significant interaction between humic acid concentration and the number of applications on all parameters under study. The application of humic acid caused a significant increase of sucrose, refined sugar, root yield and refined sugar yield and a reduction in molasses <b>forming</b> <b>substances</b> content, compared to the control. The increased amount of sucrose and refined sugar content in all applications in concentration of 2. 5 L ha - 1 humic acid was more than with 5 L ha - 1. Similarly, the content of molasses <b>forming</b> <b>substances</b> showed more reduction in 2. 5 L ha - 1 than in 5 L ha - 1 treatment. However, the results revealed that the highest root yield and refined sugar yield, as the main qualitative and quantitative parameters of sugar beet yield, were achieved by three times application of 5 L ha - 1 that had 24 and 37 % increase compared to control. </p...|$|R

40|$|The thesis {{presents}} {{a survey of}} understanding of physical <b>forms</b> of <b>substance</b> and of water circulation in nature among the pupils of the seventh grade of primary school.

Furthermore, the theoretical part of the thesis gives an overview of selected school textbooks and curricula of subjects Environmental Education, Natural Science and Technology and Natural Sciences from the first to the seventh grade of primary school. The empirical part presents the results of the tests analysis and the interpretation of results {{from the point of view}} of understanding of chemical concepts. The main purpose of the thesis was to determine the understanding of the concepts related to the physical forms of water, transitions between physical forms at the submicroscopic level, presentation of chemical concepts and understanding of the process of water circulation among pupils of the seventh grade of primary school. An adapted written test was prepared for the purpose of the survey, which covered the key chemical concepts related to the teaching content of physical <b>forms</b> of <b>substance,</b> transitions between physical <b>forms</b> of <b>substance</b> and water circulation in nature. 228 pupils of the seventh class of elementary schools from Ljubljana and its surroundings participated in the survey. The results of the survey indicate that the tested pupils of the seventh grade of primary schools do not have any difficulties in identifying the physical <b>forms</b> of <b>substance</b> at the submicroscopic level. The problems occur in the understanding of submicroscopic presentations of the condensation, evaporation and melting process. More than half of the tested pupils did not recognize the phase transition between liquid and gaseous <b>form</b> of <b>substance</b> based on the submicroscopic distribution of substance particles. The pupils also have difficulties understanding the chemical concepts related to the process of water circulation in nature, but they are familiar with the process...|$|R
