25|$|The Eta Aquariids are {{the strongest}} meteor shower {{radiating}} from Aquarius. It peaks between 5 and 6 May with {{a rate of}} approximately 35 meteors per hour. Originally discovered by Chinese astronomers in 401, Eta Aquariids can be seen coming from the Water Jar beginning on April 21 and as late as May 12. The parent body of the shower is Halley's Comet, a <b>periodic</b> <b>comet.</b> Fireballs are common shortly after the peak, approximately between May 9 and May 11. The normal meteors appear to have yellow trails.|$|E
25|$|In 1978, Slovak {{astronomer}} Ľubor Kresák {{suggested that}} the body was a fragment of Comet Encke. This is a <b>periodic</b> <b>comet</b> with an extremely short period of 3 years that stays entirely within the orbit of Jupiter. It is also responsible for the Beta Taurids, an annual meteor shower with a maximum activity around 28–29 June. The Tunguska event coincided with the peak activity of that shower, and the approximate trajectory of the Tunguska object is consistent with what would be expected from a fragment of Comet Encke. It is now known that bodies of this kind explode at frequent intervals tens to hundreds of kilometres above the ground. Military satellites have been observing these explosions for decades.|$|E
