As the sea level changed following the Pliocene era, vegetation was laid down which was later converted into peat. The <b>peak</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> peat formation took place in swamp conditions around 6,000years ago, although in some areas it continued into medieval times.|$|E

5|$|August 10, 1976– Prior to {{the arrival}} of Hurricane Belle from the south, 250,000 {{evacuate}} from the shore during the <b>peak</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tourist season.

In addition, the hurricane causes a storm surge of 8.85feet (2.70m) in Atlantic City. However, damage is less than expected, and no deaths occur.|$|E

Since then the limited demand coupled with steady production keeps the price at its 20-year average.|$|E
