40|$|The MAX {{phase is}} a group of layered ternary compounds, which has {{combined}} properties of metals and ceramics. Like metals they are ductile, readily machinable, relatively soft, good thermal and electrical conductive and has good damage tolerance. Li ke ceramics they have good high temperature strength, high elastic modulus and good oxidation and corrosion resistance. Cr 2 AlC {{is one of the most}} promising candidate in the MAX phase group. Due to its unique combination of properties, it has potential appl ications for diverse field of applications, especially as high temperature materials and protective coatings, etc. Since last two decades, a lot of research has been carried out on synthesis, sintering and property evolution, but commercial exploitation of these materials is still limited. Recent reports on MAX phases revealed the importance of powder production and development of sintering methods. Producing Cr 2 AlC powders with high purity, has been a major challenge; whereas reaction kinetics and thermody namics have been rarely explored. Moreover, understanding the sintering mechanism in multi - element system is difficult, whereas identification of a particular element which would be controlling the sintering is still a major challenge. The present investig ation has been initiated with three major objectives: i) to synthesize the high purity ultrafine Cr 2 AlC powders through mechanically activated synthesis route, ii) to study the reaction kinetics and thermodynamic aspects of Cr 2 AlC formation, and iii) to de termine the sintering mechanisms of Cr 2 AlC powders. Powder synthesis was done in three stages: firstly, CrC x (x = 0. 5) powder was prepared from Cr and C (graphite) at 1100 ºC. CrC x powder consists mainly two types of carbides, Cr 7 C 3 and Cr 3 C 2 phases in eq uimolar ratio, as represented by a chemical reaction: 10 Cr + 5 C  Cr 7 C 3 + Cr 3 C 2. Secondly, these synthesized CrC x powders were milled for 15 and 30 h using high energy planetary ball mill, with the aim of <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> <b>refining</b> and increasing the chemical reactivity of the powder. Finally, these mechanically activated carbide powders were reacted with pure Al powders at various temperatures. The formation reaction can be represented as: Cr 7 C 3 + Cr 3 C 2 + 5 Al  5 Cr 2 AlC. Milling energies (during milling of chro mium carbide powders) were estimated for 15 h and 30 h duration as 1. 6 kJ/g and 3. 2 kJ/g respectively. Effect of mechanical activation (i. e., milling durations) of chromium carbide powders on the reaction with pure Al powder was clearly noticed. Nearly pur e Cr 2 AlC powders with xii submicron particles (below 400 nm) were produced at 800  C, using 15 h milled carbides. Little excess amount (about 0. 4 mol) of Al was required to achieve very high purity Cr 2 AlC phase. DSC technique was employed to assess the thermod ynamic factors for Cr 2 AlC formation. Cr 2 AlC formation reaction was exothermic in nature, which occurred as soon as aluminium started melting. Changes in enthalpy of reaction was found from - 53 kJ/mol (for 15 h milled) to - 66 kJ/mol (for 30 h milled). The G ibb’s free energy of reaction was found to become more negative with increasing milling time; it changed from - 107 kJ/mol to - 139 kJ/mol, when milling was increased from 15 h to 30 h. This has enabled the conversion at relatively lower temperature of about 700 °C. Reaction kinetics was analysed through the activation energies of 366 - 369 kJ/mol and 315 - 316 kJ/mol for Cr 2 AlC formation from 15 h and 30 h milled carbides respectively. The Cr 2 AlC powder produced at 800 ºC using 15 h milled reactants, was subjec ted to further sintering studies. Green compacts (of about 61...|$|E

To understand how wood flour and fiber characteristics influence the mechanical properties of polypro-pylene composites, we first investigated the effect of different sizes of wood flour particles on the mechanical properties of wood-flour-filled polypropylene composites. We then compared the properties of wood-flour-filled composites to those of composites reinforced with refined wood fiber. We also studied the effect of a maleated polypropylene coupling agent on composite properties. Wood flour particles (35, 70, 120, and 235 mesh) were compounded at 40 % by weight with polypropylene. Increases in tensile and flexural strength and modulus of the wood flour composites were found to correspond with increases in aspect ratio. Notched impact energy increased with increasing <b>particle</b> <b>size,</b> whereas unnotched impact energy decreased with increasing <b>particle</b> <b>size.</b> <b>Refined</b> wood fiber and 40 -mesh wood flour was compounded at 20 % and 40 % by weight with polypropylene. Wood fiber resulted in higher strengths at both filler levels and higher moduli at the 40 % level compared to the strength properties of wood flour composites. The higher aspect ratio of the wood fiber had little effect on impact energy. The maleated polypropylene coupling agent caused greater strength increases in wood fiber composites than in wood flour composites. The coupling agent did not significantly 1 affect tensile or flexural moduli. Our results clearly support the use of higher aspect ratio wood fibers and coupling agents for increasing the strength of wood/plastic composites...|$|R

40|$|The <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> {{distribution}} and mean <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> {{are the most}} important characteristics in particulate or powder technology. Various approaches have been used to measure <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> distributions. For solid-liquid systems, the <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> distributions have been measured by the Stokes diameter. The Andreasen pipette method, sedimentation balance method, centrifugal sedimentation method, etc. have been used to measure the <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> distribution in suspensions. These methods measure the migration velocities of particles in solution, and then <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> is calculated using Stokes formula. However, all these methods are time consuming and require special skills. On the other hand, a different principle can be used to analyze the <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> distribution through microscopy, laser diffraction/scattering method, and a Coulter counter method. These methods require numerous samples to accurately determine the <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> distribution. Although the laser diffraction/scattering and Coulter counter methods produce highly accurate results within a shorter time, they require extremely expensive equipment. Hence, a simple and cost effective method to determine the <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> distribution is highly demanded. The investigation of <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> distributions by the buoyancy weighing-bar method which is a novel method in <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> distribution measurement have been done for several samples particles of Japan Industrial Standard (Test Powders 1 and Test Powders 2), Sumitomo 3 M (glass beads K 1, K 37, S 60 HS), polystyrene beads (spherical), nylon beads (cylindrical), etc. The influence of solid concentration, influence of shape and size of weighing bar and influence of vessel size also had been investigated in <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> distribution measurement by the buoyancy weighing-bar method. The result data obtained by the buoyancy weighing-bar method were comparable with the others <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> analyzer, such as sedimentation balance method, Andreasen pipette method, Coulter counter method, microscopy and the laser diffraction/scattering method. The buoyancy weighing-bar method is suitable for measuring the settling <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> {{distribution and}} the floating <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> distribution. The buoyancy weighing-bar method could be used to measure the <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> distribution in Stokes region and in Allen region. The <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> distribution obtained by the buoyancy weighing-bar method could be used to estimate the smaller <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> by using the Rosin-Rammler distribution. Theory was rediscussed and the new mean <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> was defined. Beside, the buoyancy weighing-bar method could be used to determine the mean <b>particle</b> <b>sizes</b> for a ternary mixture and multi-component particles in a short time. This ability is very useful in the powder industry.

The process variables include temperature and pressure of the CO 2, agitation rate, CO 2 flow rate, drug solution flow rate, and drug solution temperature. The effect of drug solution composition was examined by adjusting the drug concentration, by using different carrier solvents, and by comparing six different steroids after precipitation from tetrahydrofuran. Carrier solvents were chosen based on their dielectric constant and vapor pressure. ^ Results show that yield and level of residual carrier solvent are not affected by the process variables examined in this study, while <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> and <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> distribution are most dependent upon adequate dispersion of the drug solution into the supercritical fluid.

In general, physical properties of cement board had completed the standard JIS A 5417 - 1992, both cement board <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> 20 mesh and 40 mesh. Physical properties of cement board using <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> of 40 mesh better than cement board using <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> of 20 mesh. MOR value of cement board using <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> of 20 mesh had met standard while the value of MOE did not complete the standard. Internal bond and screw holding strenght did not require in standard JIS A 5417 - 1992.

40|$|Flour <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> {{distribution}} {{is a major}} factor affecting the milling behaviour in common wheats (Triticum aestivum L.). This study evaluated a new method to evaluate the milling behaviour of Japanese wheat varieties, and determine the relationship between flour yield and median flour <b>particle</b> <b>size.</b> To investigate the higher flour yielding varieties in Japanese wheats, the flour yield of one hundred sixty-five Japanese common wheat varieties were investigated in relation to median and mean flour <b>particle</b> <b>size,</b> and also, the flour <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> distribution patterns as determined by laser diffraction. The results showed that hard and soft wheat varieties differed in median flour <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> and <b>particle</b> distribution patterns. Eighty percent of the Japanese wheat varieties had soft or medium-soft <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> distribution patterns. Also, flour yield was most strongly associated with the median flour <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> in the flour samples. These results indicate the potential to develop a flour yield evaluation method in Japanese udon-noodle wheat varieties using laser diffraction methods, and that median flour <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> analysis could be a useful indicator in flour quality for udon-noodle wheat breeding and evaluation...|$|R
40|$|AbstractTest of <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> {{distributions}} {{are carried}} out by using the TSI 3090 EEPSTM <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> spectrometer and a two- stage dilution system on a high-pressure common rail diesel engine. Analysis of the <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> distributions reveals the physical and chemical characteristics of the biodiesel fuels. The results show that <b>sizes</b> of <b>particle</b> emissions are mostly below 300 nm. <b>Particle</b> <b>size</b> of biodiesel fuel is a bimodal distribution {{with the number of}} the nucleation mode accounting for more than 60 % of the total particles. With the proportion increase of biodiesel, the number of particles in nucleation mode increases while the accumulation mode <b>particles</b> with a <b>size</b> > 50 nm decreases and the peak area shifts to the small <b>particle</b> <b>size.</b> <b>Particle</b> <b>size</b> distributions of the petroleum diesel show a single peak between 50 ∼ 100 nm region and majority of the particles shows accumulation mode.

40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Particle</b> <b>size</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} properties affecting the driftability and behaviour of dust particles abraded from pesticide dressed seeds during sowing. Three <b>particle</b> <b>sizing</b> techniques were used determine the <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> distribution of dust abraded fromseeds fromsix different species. RESULTS: Important differences in dust <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> distribution between species were observed with the finest dust for rapeseed and the coarsest dust for barley. Wet laser diffraction and sonic sieving <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> results correlated well while micro-CT is able to deliver three-dimensional information and additional physical particle properties (shape, porosity). CONCLUSION: All <b>particle</b> <b>sizing</b> techniques have their (dis) advantages and none of them is able to perfectly describe the real size distribution of non-spherical <b>particles.</b> The <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> information gathered can be used in dust drift prediction models, risk assessment tools and will help to better understand the dust drift phenomenon. status: publishe...|$|R
30|$|There is a {{relation}} between the <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> and the plasmon peak, as the particles became larger when the plasmon peak shifts to longer wavelengths. Values for Ag <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> and plasmon maxima that were reported with Solomon et al. (2007) indicated that UV spectra were in lower wavelengths (384 – 414), with 10 - to 14 -nm <b>particle</b> <b>size.</b> Nair and Pradeep (2003) revealed that UV spectra at 438  nm wavelength gave <b>particle</b> <b>sizes</b> of 60 – 80  nm. Obtained results indicated that lower wavelengths of UV spectra at 383  nm recorded <b>particle</b> <b>sizes</b> at 1 – 25  nm at 28  °C.|$|R
