40|$|Abstract: At {{the present}} time, {{the most widely}} used machine for seed and oilseed {{planting}} is a seed drill with a roller-type-metering device. Due to nonuniform spacing of seeds along the rows and lack of control on planting depth, this machine aggravates the growth related problems and degrades the quality of a sensitive crop such as oilseed rape. To solve the above-mentioned problems, an attempt was made to develop a <b>precision</b> <b>seed</b> <b>drill</b> with a roller-type-metering device and a depth control system. Some of the design parameters affecting the uniformity of seed distribution were studied from the view point of roller and brush geometry. Computer software packages were used to design the machine and simulate its operational performance. In the laboratory test, {{it was found that the}} <b>precision</b> <b>seed</b> <b>drill</b> performed satisfactorily and its speed and vibration did not affect the performance of metering system significantly. In the field test, a uniform distribution of seed with a reasonable spacing along the row planting was achieved and seed scattering was found to be within an acceptable range.

40|$|In {{view of the}} {{development}} of various technological alternatives in precision seed drilling, it has become a matter of research whether there are clear criteria for {{the success or failure of}} technological innovations. Around the turn to the 20 th century, two very different <b>precision</b> <b>seed</b> <b>drill</b> methods were developed almost at the same time. Band seeding made it possible to achieve nearly perfect single grain sowing. For this purpose, individual, equally spaced seeds were embedded into bands of paper or cotton. In the field, these seed tapes were then unreeled from large drums. The pneumatic system proposed in 1897, by contrast, introduced grain singling using a vacuum for the first time. Although band seeding presented a satisfactory technological solution, it was never widely applied. Pneumatic systems, on the other hand, took long to catch on and only started to be successful in the late 1960 s. Up to then, these innovative systems had to be considered as failures. Changing the period under review, however, may completely reverse the assessment of whether an innovation is a success or a failure...|$|E
40|$|The MASTER-project aims at {{quantifying}} {{the dust}} drift risk from seed drillers and developing drift reduction measures and innovations in sowing techniques using an integrated experimental and modelling approach. A {{computational fluid dynamics}} (CFD) model was developed that calculates the airflow and dust particle movement around the machine. To this end, the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations are solved around the 3 D geometry of seed drillers to obtain the airflow field {{as a result of}} the airjet(s) emitted from the fan exhaust of the pneumatic machines. In addition, the track of dust particles is calculated from the emission sources on the machine into the surrounding air using a Lagrangian tracking procedure of representative dust particles. In this contribution, the model is used to calculate the dust emission, distribution and deposition around static drillers operated in a closed environment. The pneumatic drills chosen were: an overpressure based pneumatic bulk drilling machine (Kuhn Venta nc 3000) and a vacuum based <b>precision</b> <b>seed</b> <b>drill</b> with and without deflectors (Gaspardo ST Stella 300). The machine and dust characteristics were measured and are presented in separate contributions. The measured properties of the emitted dust particles (particle size distribution, density and shape) and the airflow characteristics from the machine (fan outlet direction, air velocity magnitude at outlet) were used in the CFD model as inputs, while the machine and tractor geometry were obtained from CAD drawings. The CFD model predicted the behavior of the dust particles around the static machines. The dust cloud was calculated for a representative number of 10 000 particles from the measured size distribution. The air velocity magnitude and direction and the particle density, size and shape affected the dust distribution around the different machines. The model predictions were validated with measurements of the 3 D airflow pattern dust sampling around the machines during dedicated trials with tracer coated seeds. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|The {{main goal}} of sowing is the {{distribution}} of seeds at an optimal depth with adequate seed spacings. The results of the optimal sowing, in both horizontal and vertical directions, are better germination and sprouting, as well as increased yield and reduced influence of plants on each other’s space for growing, regarding the available light, nutrients and moisture. Quality of horizontal and vertical seed distribution {{is influenced by the}} distance between rows, sowing depth, pre-sowing preparation, <b>seed</b> <b>drill,</b> <b>seeding</b> mechanism, sowing density, and operator’s skills. The arithmetic mean of spacing (Am), standard deviation for spacings between the plants (SD) and coefficient of variation (CV) are usually used for representation of sowing evenness. Assuming that the seeds are of good germination quality, the yield is directly dependent on the sowing quality and organization of plants per unit of surface area. A well prepared plot was sown with 20 corn seed hybrids from different FAO maturity groups. The sowing was performed with <b>precision</b> pneumatic <b>seed</b> <b>drill</b> INO Becker Aeromat 2, which ejects individual seeds by using the overpressure. After sprouting, no statistically {{significant differences were found between}} the sowing of hybrids from different FAO maturity groups and their characteristics. When the yield is concerned, biological characteristics of hybrids are much more influential than the quality of sowing. This is true only if the tractor implement for wide row planting is properly adjusted...|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} plant spacing on size, shape, {{uniformity}} and yield of onion bulbs; including ware (35 - 85 mm) and pickling (25 - 45 mm) grades; were {{studied at the}} Vegetable Research Station during 1980 - 82. The study first examined the effect of plant density at a constant rectangularity of 1 : 1. Seed was hand-sown at 178, 400, 625, 816, 1111 and 1600 plants m- 2 (cv. White Spanish) in 1980 and 51, 69, 83, 100, 178 and 400 plants m- 2 (cv. Pukekohe Longkeeper) in 1981. Total, ware and pickling bulb yields followed parabolic relationships with plant density and were highest at 420, 148 and 666 plants m- 2 respectively. Increases in plant density reduced plant size, mean bulb weight, plant fresh and dry weights, number of leaves, cumulative leaf length, time to maturity {{and the proportion of}} round bulbs, but did not affect the soluble solids content, bulb ratio or percentage dry matter per plant. Density had no effect on bulb uniformity but could be used to determine the distribution of size grades within the crop. The second part of the study examined the effect of plant arrangement at a constant density. Seed (cv. White Spanish) was hand-sown at densities of 178, 400, 625 and 816 plants m- 2 and rectangularities of 1 : 1, 2 : 1, 1 : 2, 4 : 1, 1 : 4 and 16 : 1. Plant arrangement had no significant effect on total bulb yield, mean bulb size or bulb uniformity but altered bulb shape. Yield and number of round bulbs decreased as rectangularity increased. However, the response of onion bulbs to plant arrangement decreased as plant density increased. The final part of the study examined the effect of plant arrangement in a direct-drilled crop. Seed (cv. Pukekohe Longkeeper) was sown with a Stanhay (<b>precision)</b> <b>seed</b> <b>drill</b> at. a constant density and at rectangularities from 1. 25 : 1 to 20 : 1 in 1981 and 1. 08 : 1 to 14 : 1 in 1982. The response of onion bulbs to plant arrangement was more. dramatic for direct-drilled crops than hand-sown crops. Total and round bulb yields decreased as rectangularity increased. The practical implications of these results are discussed. Restricted Access: University of Melbourne Staff and Students Onl...|$|E

5000|$|A <b>seed</b> <b>drill</b> is {{a device}} that sows the seeds for crops by {{metering}} out the individual seeds, positioning them in the soil, and covering them to a certain average depth.
