40|$|This {{paper is}} in closed access. Introduction: Taiwan is not {{particularly}} {{well known in the}} world of international sport. However, the relationship between sport and politics in Taiwan is unusual, if not unique. Successive governments have recognized the potential of international sporting success to enhance the country’s global image not least because other such avenues are partially closed {{as a consequence of the}} troubled diplomatic relations between Taiwan and the People’s Republic of China (PRC). Within this context, taekwondo is one of few sports in which Taiwan consistently achieves remarkable performances on the international stage. Therefore, it is the political value attached to sporting success that makes taekwondo development strategies in Taiwan of considerable interest. The main aim of this study is to analyze the policy (or policies) used to produce elite taekwondo performers in Taiwan by focusing on the relationships between the national governing body (NGB) – the Chinese Taipei Taekwondo Association (CTTA) – and the government, and on key areas of elite sports development. Method: This study adopted a qualitative research approach, drawing upon a series of interviews with 9 governmental officials, 2 legislators, 3 members of staff from interest groups, 2 sports journalists, 2 sports academics and 2 national taekwondo coaches and with analysis based on the Advocacy Coalition Framework (ACF), this study explores the development policy of taekwondo at the elite level in Taiwan. Empirical data gathered from semi-structured interviews and documentary materials are analyzed using the ACF. Results: This study illustrated the relationships that exist between the CTTA and other organizations, including governmental agencies and NGBs as well as located the elite development of taekwondo in five separate domains including (a) the development of elite level facilities, (b) the identification of sporting talent and the development system, (c) the provision of domestic and international competition opportunities for elite athletes, (d) the development system for coaches, the <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> <b>coaches</b> and of sports sciences, and (e) the emergence of full-time athletes. Conclusion: The policy of developing taekwondo at the elite level in Taiwan has been examined in this study. By adopting the ACF, what resources and strategies the CTTA possesses and adopts to deliver its belief system to government and what external factors influence the taekwondo policy-making process have been presented within the discussion. In certain respects, the policy approach taken towards elite development of taekwondo is comparable to that adopted for other sports in Taiwan. However, this study has highlighted the specificities of taekwondo policy-making as well as areas of overlap. Studies that compare elite sport development across the whole range of sports are certainly of value. However, it is argued that they are at their most valuable when detailed studies of individual sports have first been undertaken, informed by various conceptual tools, amongst them the ACF...|$|E

40|$|In recent years, the <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> formal <b>coach</b> {{education}} has been regarded as a crucial mechanism for endorsing sports coaching and facilitating sports coaching practitioners’ professional development and competency. As a result, {{there has been a}} noticeable increase in the number <b>of</b> sports <b>coaching</b> research scholars investigating formal coach education. Previous research however has recognised that formal coach {{education has}} had a limited impact on learning and professional development. In addition, the research surrounding females in sports coaching, and in particular their experiences <b>of</b> formal <b>coach</b> education, is limited. It is considered an under-researched area, and currently it is unclear why females are under-represented in formal coach education courses. This thesis therefore aims to explore gendered issues associated with the complexities of the Football Association’s formal coach education process, and the issues associated with female football coaching practitioners’ attending coach education courses. The sports coaches who participated in this work were recruited via purposeful sampling procedures, and importantly demonstrated characteristics which resonated with the aims of this research study. The research study was separated into a four-phase, sequential, exploratory method design, which included a series of in-depth, one-to-one semi-structured interviews. Data were analysed utilising a thematic analysis approach, and aligned with a Bourdieun and feminist theoretical framework. The findings revealed a range of contexts and challenges for female coaches undertaking formal coach education. Specifically, high levels of gender discrimination, inappropriate cultural practices, and sexual impropriety were recorded. These insights are discussed in line with the Bourdieun notions of social acceptance, symbolic language and violence. In conclusion, it is argued that the attrition levels <b>of</b> the sports <b>coaching</b> practitioners’ have indeed been affected, and could well continue to be, unless change occurs. Hopefully, the recommendations provided could {{go a long way to}} enhancing the future <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> formal <b>coach</b> education...|$|R

40|$|The {{developmental}} pathways <b>of</b> elite sports <b>coaches</b> {{have received}} considerable amounts of enquiry {{within the field}} <b>of</b> <b>coach</b> education. These studies, however, have principally been situated within psychological disciplines focusing on cognitive development. In so doing, it has been identified that tacit knowledge acquired at the subconscious level can significantly inform subsequent coaching practices. Such findings have inferred to socialisation processes {{within the field of}} elite sport as an elite athlete significantly contribute towards individuals acquiring and developing coaching knowledge to perform at an elite level. Nevertheless, this is an area which has not been fully investigated, and therefore remains the core aim of the present paper. A total of 15 elite male players (5 -soccer; 10 -rugby union) competing in England were individually interviewed via two waves of data collection over a 10 - 12 month period. A qualitative longitudinal cohort research design was employed to enable the researcher to ‘follow’ the participants during the process of them ‘becoming’ elite soccer or rugby union coaches. Subsequently, both retrospective and prospective questions on ‘becoming’ an elite coach were integrating into the interview schedules, designed to stimulate reflexive accounts on how socio-cultural mechanisms contoured coach development. Data were retroductively analysed. Identified themes drew upon Bourdieusian concepts of habitus and hexis. Results identified the significance of agents embodying particular values and beliefs engendered from professional clubs. The embodiment of structural values and beliefs was collectively termed as ‘coaching philosophy’. Becoming aware of their own subconscious values tied to their ‘coaching philosophies’ was identified as pivotal in securing the participants’ confidence in negotiating an adapted identity from an elite athlete to that <b>of</b> an elite <b>coach.</b> The paper discusses how such findings can enhance the <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> <b>coach</b> education for increasing agency reflexivity on consciously learning and then embodying the values required for ‘becoming’ an elite coach...|$|R

This study investigates how coaching is realised in terms of learning: What kinds of learning ideals pervade QI coaching, and how is support for learning realised, given the prevailing conditions in a contemporary healthcare system? For the purpose of this case study, a group <b>of</b> <b>coaches</b> exchanged experiences about their pedagogic roles and the strategies that they employed, on four occasions, over a period of 4 months. The conversations were filmed and then analysed, using critical discourse analysis as an analytic framework. Three parallel styles <b>of</b> <b>coaching</b> were identified, which were symbolised by (1) a pointing, (2) a bypassing and (3) a guiding discourse. No persistent dominance of any one of the discourses was found, which suggests that there exists an ever-present tension between the pointing and guiding pedagogies <b>of</b> <b>coaching</b> activities. The findings indicate that QI coaching in healthcare is more complex than previous conceptualisations <b>of</b> <b>coaching.</b> Additionally, the findings present a new, ‘bypassing’ coaching style which the coaches themselves were not fully aware of...|$|R
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy <b>of</b> Loughborough University. <b>Coach</b> learning is a complex process of which we have relatively little appreciation. Existing knowledge is largely fragmented and has tended to lack conceptual clarity and theoretical depth of understanding. This investigation sought to build on existing understanding by adding to a limited body of information about knowledge structures, learning situations, motives and deterrents to learning, and means <b>of</b> enhancing the <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> <b>coach</b> education. Data were derived from 90 UK practitioners (82 males & 8 females), comprising a range of sports (n = 8), who had accumulated on average 23 years <b>of</b> <b>coaching</b> experience (ranging from 3 - 50 years). Semi-structured {{interviews were conducted with}} 16 elite performance <b>coaches.</b> 74 practitioners <b>of</b> a diverse range <b>of</b> <b>coaching</b> levels completed open-ended questionnaires. All of the data were subjected to inductive content analysis. A number of theoretical `hooks' were utilised within the analysis process to help make sense of the findings. Analysis of the findings demonstrated that: (1) while it was possible to compartmentalise the coaches' knowledge structures (i. e., Ologies, Pedagogy, and Sport Specific), coaching practice likely requires integrated understanding; (2) the coaches under investigation learnt in formal, nonformal, and informal situations; (3) the participants' learning endeavours were largely driven by an internal desire to actualise their coaching potential; (4) dispositional, institutional, and situational barriers were shown to deter these practitioners from further coach learning participation; and (5) these practitioners were pragmatic learners who desired relevant and usable knowledge. Exploration of the coaches' educational experiences, and perceptions about optimal provision, revealed that they wanted more active learning opportunities (i. e., observations, group discussions, practical experiences, and mentoring schemes). Collectively, the results of this investigation built upon previous understanding <b>of</b> <b>coach</b> learning. They highlighted the significance and underresearched link between the types <b>of</b> knowledge these <b>coaches</b> had acquired, what drove their continued learning engagement, and how these factors had influenced their actual and preferred learning approaches. These findings, therefore, not only contributed towards a greater understanding <b>of</b> how <b>coaches</b> learn, but what needs to be considered if the ongoing development <b>of</b> <b>coaching</b> practitioners is to be better supported. Continued exploration of these factors is required if greater depth of understanding is to evolve...|$|R
40|$|A thesis {{submitted}} to the University of Bedfordshire, in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor <b>of</b> PhilosophyCounselling and <b>coaching</b> use specialised skills to help individuals address problems and make a positive change (Egan, 2010). Whilst sharing many commonalities with counselling, the coaching industry has endeavoured to define boundaries between the helping approaches to establish discrete areas of practice. However, rather than observe theoretical boundaries, many coaches rely on personal experience to idiosyncratically define boundaries in practice (Maxwell, 2009; Price 2009). The reliance on experience to inform practice judgements has significant implications for novice coaches. Without the advantage of contextual knowledge to assist with identifying boundaries, {{it is important that}} newly trained <b>coaches</b> are aware <b>of</b> working within their competency to ensure good practice. To investigate whether clear boundaries could be identified, a mixed-methods approach was used to explore novice coaches’ and experienced coaches’ and counsellors’ experiences of working with the boundaries between the helping approaches. Study one incorporated a survey and Interpretative phenomenological analysis of interview transcripts to investigate novice coaches’ perceptions of boundaries. Study two utilised a survey design to gain a broad understanding of experienced counsellors’ and coaches’ perspectives, while Study three involved an in-depth analysis of the experiences <b>of</b> 20 <b>coaches</b> and counsellors working with boundaries between coaching and counselling in practice. Findings from the first study indicated novices’ confusion and inconsistencies when identifying the differences between the approaches. The results suggested that newly trained coaches may work beyond their competencies when working with mental health problems in practice. Results from studies with experienced practitioners indicated that there is a large overlap between the helping approaches and identified different ways of working with boundaries. Some practitioners were adamant that boundaries should be preserved between coaching and counselling. However, a third of practitioners surveyed indicated that integrating approaches would be beneficial to meet the clients’ needs. The thesis illustrates practitioners’ concerns relating to the content and <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> <b>coach</b> training programmes and offers recommendations that aim to encourage a review of minimum standards in coach education. In addition, collaboration between coaching and counselling professional bodies is suggested to establish ethical guidelines for coaches and counsellors who wish to blend coaching and counselling practice...|$|R

40|$|This chapter {{provides}} a {{detailed discussion of}} the evidence on housing and mortgage lending discrimination, {{as well as the}} potential impacts of such discrimination on minority outcomes like homeownership and neighborhood environment. The paper begins by discussing conceptual issues surrounding empirical analyses of discrimination including explanations for why discrimination takes place, defining different forms of discrimination, and the appropriate interpretation of observed racial and ethnic differences in treatment or outcomes. Next, the paper reviews evidence on housing market discrimination starting with evidence of segregation and price differences in the housing market and followed by direct evidence of discrimination by real estate agents in paired testing studies. Finally, mortgage market discrimination and barriers in access to mortgage credit are discussed. This discussion begins with an assessment of the role credit barriers play in explaining racial and ethnic differences in homeownership and follows with discussions of analyses of underwriting and the price of credit based on administrative and private sector data sources including analyses of the subprime market. The paper concludes that housing discrimination has declined especially in the market for owner-occupied housing and does not appear to play a large role in limiting the neighborhood choices of minority households or the concentration of minorities into central cities. On the other hand, the patterns of racial centralization and lower home ownership rates of African-Americans appear to be related to each other, and lower minority homeownership rates are in part attributable to barriers in the market for mortgage credit. The paper presents considerable evidence of racial and ethnic differences in mortgage underwriting, as well as additional evidence suggesting these differences may be attributable to differential <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> <b>coaching,</b> assistance, and support by loan officers. At this point, innovation in loan products, the shift towards risk based pricing, and growth of the subprime market have not mitigated the role credit barriers play in explaining racial and ethnic differences in homeownership. Further, the growth of the subprime lending industry appears to have segmented the mortgage market in terms of geography leading to increased costs of relying on local/neighborhood sources of mortgage credit and affecting the integrity of many low-income minority neighborhoods through increased foreclosure rates.

This pitched Stagecoach in fierce and direct competition from Scottish Citylink, a company Stagecoach ironically operated vehicles for under a franchise agreement. Stagecoach continued to use the distinctive M8 Motorvator brand on this route, with vehicles wearing a red and off-white livery, and was operated by Stagecoach Glasgow Ltd. Some seats on the Motorvator service were available for purchase through the low-cost Stagecoach subsidiary Megabus. Both companies offered fast, frequent and affordable express services along the M8 motorway corridor between the two Scottish cities, a situation that continued until 13 September 2005. On that date, Stagecoach and Citylink parent company ComfortDelGro announced a joint venture in the <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> express <b>coach</b> services in Scotland.
