[...] The album title was changed at the last minute, first to a self-titled album and then to Vs., a nod to the general theme of conflict present in most of the songs on the album. Regarding the title Vs., Vedder said, [...] "They were writing all these articles... Our band against somebody else's band. What the hell are they talking about?

Having apparently awoken from her coma, Cordelia reunites with Angel Investigations, who she discovers have taken over Wolfram & Hart since their defeat of Jasmine. She chastises Angel for accepting W's [...] "deal with the devil", and reminds him of his true mission and higher calling. Together, they face and defeat their old enemy Lindsey McDonald (Christian Kane), who had been impersonating Doyle in an attempt to destroy Angel. In the episode's closing moments, Cordelia reiterates to Angel that she loves him and kisses him, shortly before he receives a phone call reporting that Cordelia died that morning. When Angel turns around, Cordelia is gone. It is later revealed that this encounter—the <b>Powers</b> <b>That</b> <b>Be</b> repaying their debt to Cordelia—allowed Cordelia to pass one last vision over to Angel, giving him the knowledge he needs to bring down the Circle of the Black Thorn.|$|E
500|$|Steven Lisberger stated on October 28, 2010, {{before the}} film's release, that a sequel was in {{planning}} and that Adam Horowitz and Edward Kitsis, screenwriters for Tron: Legacy, were {{in the early stages}} of producing a script for the new film. Perry Nemiroff of Cinema Blend speculated that Tron 3 could be the first installment in a new trilogy. On January 13, 2011, Ain't It Cool News reported that the film was close to having its sequel announced as part of Disney's plan for Tron future. On January 21, 2011, Tron-Sector reported an unsourced rumor that a sequel to Tron: Legacy had been green-lit and a teaser trailer would debut on the DVD and Blu-ray Disc releases of Tron and Tron: Legacy. Harry Knowles reported on the teaser, calling it a [...] "DVD Extra" [...] and noting that it had been filmed before Thanksgiving (i.e. before November 2010). On April 8, 2011, director Joseph Kosinski talked about the sequel: [...] "We're working on the story right now. Once we get a script we're all really happy with, we'll take it to the <b>powers</b> <b>that</b> <b>be</b> and see if we can go back to the grid. I think we will pick up with where Tron: Legacy left off with Sam and Quorra in the real world and what does that mean and the possibilities it opens up for the next chapter. It's that relationship between the two of them that's the next step." [...] On March 31, Kosinski said that the film's script was expected to be finished in two weeks and its working title is Tr3n.|$|E
500|$|Angel season four {{played with}} audience's {{expectations}} of the now heroic Cordelia by revealing her to be the season's Big Bad; it was later established that Cordelia had been possessed by a manipulative deity called Jasmine. The storyline was controversial with fans, and Carpenter has admitted hating how a possessed Cordelia seduced Angel's teenage son. Carpenter has said, [...] "I'm in denial about that whole storyline. It was creepy." [...] She tried to keep a positive attitude about the situation, though; [...] director Terrence O'Hara commented that he thought Carpenter had [...] "a lot of fun" [...] playing a manipulative Cordelia in the episode [...] "Orpheus" [...] because she enjoyed coming up with Cordelia's new [...] "schizophrenic madwoman" [...] characterization. David Boreanaz was also unsettled by the incestuous pairing. At a [...] 2004 convention he admitted that the season four storyline [...] "freaked him out." [...] The episode [...] "Inside Out" [...] saw the height of this inversion of Cordelia's character, where she is seen urging Connor to murder an innocent girl in order to expedite {{the birth of the}} child they conceived together. In an effort to stop Connor, the <b>Powers</b> <b>That</b> <b>Be</b> send the spirit of Connor's mother Darla (Julie Benz) to convince him not to go through with it. The episode sees Carpenter dressed in black, while Benz appears in heavenly white as she becomes the voice of reason and morality. Steven S. DeKnight, who wrote and directed the episode, felt this was a brilliant role-reversal for both actresses as Carpenter is accustomed to playing the benevolent Cordelia where Darla is normally seen as a sinister vampire. Much of season four's storyline had to be adjusted due to Carpenter's real-life pregnancy; after Cordelia gives birth to Jasmine in the episode [...] "Inside Out" [...] she is left in a coma {{for the remainder of the}} fourth season. Crusie discusses what she felt were the flaws in the execution of the fourth season, It's that she betrays the man she trusts above all others and who trusts her absolutely; it's that she seduces a boy she once diapered; it's that she dresses like a drag queen and talks like a Dynasty reject. It's that she's not Cordy, and what might have been fun to watch had we been let into the secret before the Beastmaster seduced Connor becomes the extended rape and death of a much-beloved character.|$|E

500|$|Thom Brennaman {{immediately}} {{hailed the}} game {{as one of the}} greatest upsets in the history of sports; Charissa Thompson told coach Jerry Moore that it was [...] "one of the greatest upsets in college football history." [...] Many media outlets described it as one of, if not the greatest, upsets in the history of college football. The win marked the first time an FCS team had beaten a ranked FBS program. [...] Dan Wetzel of Yahoo! Sports wrote that: [...] "This game was supposed to be the prime example of what had gone wrong in money hungry college football. The <b>powers</b> <b>that</b> <b>be</b> had expanded the season a couple years back, adding an extra game so big schools could bring in cream-puff opponents while collecting millions in revenue. Michigan had never played a I-AA opponent in its history. Now we know why, the Wolverines were ducking them. Instead of an easy tune-up for Michigan, Appalachian State leaves with its most profound victory ever and a check for $400,000 that was supposed to be their pay for getting punished." [...] Sports Illustrated writer Stewart Mandel wrote that he felt [...] "utterly unqualified" [...] to put the game into perspective, and said [...] "there's no logical reason whatsoever this should have happened. But it did. And it wasn't the slightest bit fluky." [...] He also expressed disappointment that he would not be able to vote for the Mountaineers in his AP Poll ballot, explaining that [...] "it may well turn out that Michigan was grossly overrated, but all I know is this: There will not be 25 other teams that accomplish more this opening weekend than Appalachian State did Saturday. There won't even be five." [...] Pat Forde of ESPN.com called it [...] "the most astonishing college football result I can remember," [...] saying that [...] "we'll still be talking about it a few decades from now. Especially in the locker rooms of every huge underdog, where they'll say, 'If Appalachian State can beat Michigan, why can't we shock the world, too?.'" [...] He felt the upset was particularly impressive because upsets of such a magnitude do not happen often in college football. The New York Times writer Viv Bernstein called the game [...] "one of the biggest upsets in college football history" [...] and called it [...] "a stunning upset by any measure." [...] The game was the lead story on SportsCenter and was the cover story for the following week's edition of Sports Illustrated; Appalachian State wide receiver Dexter Jackson was featured on the cover, which has the headline [...] "Alltime Upset: Appalachian State Stuns No. 5 Michigan." ...|$|E
