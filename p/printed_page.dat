Also like Bülow, he began giving recitals devoted entirely to the work of one composer. In 1879, he began giving all-Liszt recitals, and in 1883 he experimented with an all-Beethoven recital.|$|E

50|$|In {{order for}} the pages {{to come out in}} the correct order, the {{printers}} would have to properly lay out the pages of type in the printing press. For example, to print two leaves in folio containing pages 1 through 4, the printer would <b>print</b> <b>pages</b> 1 and 4 {{on one side of the}} sheet and, after that has dried, <b>print</b> <b>pages</b> 2 and 3 on the other side. If a printer was printing a folio in 8s, as described above, he would have to <b>print</b> <b>pages</b> 1 and 16 on one side of a leaf with pages 2 and 15 on the other side of that leaf, etc. The arrangement of the pages of type in the press is referred to as the imposition and there are a number of methods of imposing pages for the various formats, some of which involve cutting the <b>printed</b> <b>pages</b> before binding.|$|R

25|$|In 1941, IBM {{announced}} the Electromatic Model 04 electric typewriter, featuring the revolutionary concept of proportional spacing. By assigning varied rather than uniform spacing to different sized characters, the Type 4 recreated {{the appearance of}} a <b>printed</b> <b>page,</b> an effect that was further enhanced by a typewriter ribbon innovation that produced clearer, sharper words on the page. The proportional spacing feature became a staple of the IBM Executive series typewriters.|$|E

25|$|A {{native of}} London, Margery Winifred Williams {{was born to}} {{successful}} and accomplished parents. The second daughter of a noted barrister and a renowned classical scholar, {{she and her sister}} were encouraged by her father, whom she remembered as a deeply loving and caring parent, to read and use their imaginations. Writing about her childhood many years later, she recalled how vividly her father described characters from various books and the infinite world of knowledge and adventure that lay on the <b>printed</b> <b>page.</b> She noted that the desire to read, which soon transformed into a need to write, was a legacy from her father that would be hers for a lifetime.|$|E
25|$|The then current {{theory of}} colour held that white light was elementary, and that colours arose from {{mixtures}} {{of light and}} dark. Newton criticised this theory by noting that in that case a <b>printed</b> <b>page,</b> with its juxtaposition of light and dark, would look coloured. In folio 122 he recorded {{for the first time}} his notion that white light is heterogeneous and colour arise, not through the modification of a homogeneous white light, but from the separation of this mixture into its components. Newton also mentions Hooke's theory of colour, including his idea that it is a wave. Newton dismisses this theory with the remark that then light should bend around edges of objects as sounds does.|$|E

500|$|According to Professor John Meisel, {{who wrote}} a book about the 1957 campaign, Diefenbaker's {{speaking}} style was [...] "reminiscent of the fiery orators so popular in the nineteenth century. Indeed, Mr. Diefenbaker's oratory has been likened to that of the revivalist preacher." [...] As a new face on the national scene given to outspoken attacks on the government, he began to attract unexpectedly large crowds early in the campaign. When reduced to the written word, however, Diefenbaker's rhetoric sometimes proved to be without much meaning. According to journalist and author Peter C. Newman, [...] "On the <b>printed</b> <b>page,</b> it makes little sense. But from the platform, its effect was far different."
