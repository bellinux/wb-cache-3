The first part of the thesis {{presents and}} investigates a new family of carrier lock detectors. These detectors are self-normalizing, i. e., they are independent of the AGC (Automatic Gain Control) circuit parameters.

The first family of <b>phase</b> <b>detectors</b> is self-normalizing (i. e., the <b>phase</b> <b>detectors</b> are independent from the AGC). The second family of <b>phase</b> <b>detectors</b> is based on an adaptive structure that achieves not only independence vis-à-vis the AGC, but rather also independence from the SNR (Signal-to-Noise Ratio), hence potentially allowing the carrier synchronization circuit to operate optimally at all SNRs. In the third part of the thesis, two new families of SNR estimators are presented. The first family of SNR estimators requires that the carrier synchronization PLL (Phase Lock Loop) be locked in order to function. The second family of SNR estimators is mor...|$|R

25|$|A <b>phase</b> <b>detector</b> compares two input {{signals and}} {{produces}} an error signal which {{is proportional to}} their phase difference. The error signal is then low-pass filtered and used to drive a VCO which creates an output phase. The output is fed through an optional divider back to the input of the system, producing a negative feedback loop. If the output phase drifts, the error signal will increase, driving the VCO phase {{in the opposite direction}} so as to reduce the error.Thus the output phase is locked to the phase at the other input.

2500|$|A {{phase-locked loop}} or {{phase lock loop}} {{abbreviated}} as PLL is a control system that generates an output signal whose phase {{is related to the}} phase of an input signal. [...] There are several different types; the simplest is an electronic circuit consisting of a variable frequency oscillator and a <b>phase</b> <b>detector</b> in a feedback loop. [...] The oscillator generates a periodic signal, and the <b>phase</b> <b>detector</b> compares the phase of that signal with the phase of the input periodic signal, adjusting the oscillator to keep the phases matched.|$|E
2500|$|The {{oscillator}} {{generates a}} periodic output signal. Assume that initially the oscillator is at {{nearly the same}} frequency as the reference signal. If the phase from the oscillator falls behind that of the reference, the <b>phase</b> <b>detector</b> changes the control voltage of the oscillator so that it speeds up. [...] Likewise, if the phase creeps ahead of the reference, the <b>phase</b> <b>detector</b> changes the control voltage {{to slow down the}} oscillator. [...] Since initially the oscillator may be far from the reference frequency, practical phase detectors may also respond to frequency differences, so as to increase the lock-in range of allowable inputs.|$|E
2500|$|The second common {{consideration}} is limiting {{the amount of}} reference frequency energy (ripple) appearing at the <b>phase</b> <b>detector</b> output that is then applied to the VCO control input.

2500|$|A bang-bang {{charge pump}} <b>phase</b> <b>{{detector}}</b> must {{always have a}} dead band where the phases of inputs are close enough that the detector detects no phase error. For this reason, bang-bang phase detectors [...] are associated with significant minimum peak-to-peak jitter, because of drift within the dead band. However these types, having outputs consisting of very narrow pulses at lock, are very useful for applications requiring very low VCO spurious outputs. [...] The narrow pulses contain very little energy and are easy to filter out of the VCO control voltage. [...] This results in low VCO control line ripple and therefore low FM sidebands on the VCO.|$|E
2500|$|For instance, the {{frequency}} mixer produces harmonics that adds complexity in applications where spectral {{purity of the}} VCO signal is important. [...] The resulting unwanted (spurious) sidebands, also called [...] "reference spurs" [...] can dominate the filter requirements and reduce the capture range well below and/or increase the lock time beyond the requirements. [...] In these applications the more complex digital phase detectors are used which do not have as severe a reference spur component on their output. Also, when in lock, the steady-state phase difference at the inputs using this type of <b>phase</b> <b>detector</b> is near 90 degrees.
