50|$|Eligibility {{for access}} to <b>preserved</b> <b>benefits</b> depends on a worker's {{preservation}} age. The Howard Liberal Government announced changes in 1997 to the superannuation system designed to induce Australians {{to stay in the}} workforce {{for a longer period of}} time, delaying the effect of population ageing. Previously, any Australian could access their <b>preserved</b> <b>benefits</b> once they reached 55 years of age. However, after legislation was passed in 1999, an employee's preservation age depends on their date of birth.|$|E
50|$|As superannuation {{is money}} {{invested}} for a person's retirement, strict government rules prevent early access to <b>preserved</b> <b>benefits</b> except in very limited and restricted circumstances, including severe financial hardship or on compassionate grounds, such as for medical treatment not available through Medicare.|$|E
50|$|<b>Preserved</b> <b>{{benefits}}</b> are {{benefits that}} must be retained in a superannuation fund until the employee's 'preservation age'. Currently, all workers must wait until they are at least 55 before they may access these funds. The actual preservation age varies depending on the date of birth of the employee. All contributions made after 1 July 1999 fall into this category.|$|E

Preoperative ultrasound findings {{allowed us to}} such surgery. Intraoperative frozen sectioning showed the benign nature of the lesion, consistent with the final histologic examination. For aesthetic, cosmetic, psychologic and fertility <b>preserving</b> <b>benefits,</b> treatment selection of testis sparing surgery in some testicular masses should be carried out according to clinical, radiological and frozen section findings...|$|R

Federal Conferences held twice yearly to determine SCOA policy and strategy. Each state {{is represented by}} a councillor from that state. State-branch executive committees provide support for members within each state. A Federal executive, based in Canberra, carries out the day-to-day activities of the organisation.

40|$|The Commission {{was asked}} to review the National Third Party Access Regime for Natural Gas Pipelines. The review sought to assess the {{benefits}} and costs of the Regime, including its effects on investment. The Commission’s preliminary findings were released for public comment in December 2003 and its final report was submitted to the Government in June 2004. The Commission confirmed its initial finding that, while access regulation is required, the current cost-based price regulation had significant drawbacks and put forward proposals to reduce regulatory costs while <b>preserving</b> <b>benefits.</b> The Commission’s key finding in the final report is the proposed addition of a less costly, monitoring option.

40|$|Noncitizens {{lawfully}} {{residing in}} the United States are considered a “discrete and insular minority” in equal protection jurisprudence. Foreclosed from meaningful political participation because of an inability to vote, this population is frequently the target of budget cuts in an economic downturn when legislators struggle to <b>preserve</b> <b>benefits</b> for their voting constituents. Recently, Massachusetts and New Jersey dealt with looming deficits by eliminating many legal permanent residents’ eligibility for state-funded health insurance programs. Each state relied on provisions in the 1996 Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act, federal legislation that purports to allow individual states to discriminate against legal immigrants in state-funded social welfare programs. This Note concludes that states like Massachusetts and New Jersey cannot adopt a federal classification scheme excluding newly arrived legal immigrants from their respective state-funded healthcare programs without running afoul of the Equal Protection Clause. First, Massachusetts and New Jersey’s state-funded healthcare programs are unrelated to, and thus not justified by, federal immigration policy. Second, federal legislation cannot authorize individual states to circumvent strict scrutiny review by the courts. Moreover, it is economically unwise for a state to exclude its “citizens in waiting” from cost-effective, accessible healthcare, despite the federal government’s decision to do so...|$|R
