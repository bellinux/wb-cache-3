We found that these two proteins distribute differently on ammonium sulfate fractionation of uterine cytosol. Preparative cellulose acetate electrophoresis afforded complete (greater than 99. 9 %) separation of <b>phosphoprotein</b> phosphatase activity from the induced protein. The specific activity of <b>phosphoprotein</b> phosphatase in uterine cytosol was unchanged 1, 4, 12, or 24 hr after estradiol administration.

To study the effect of passage, cell cultures were measured for amount of the 54 -kDa <b>phosphoprotein</b> at the 2 nd and 12 th passages. In the absence of any transforming agent, the amount of endogenous 54 -kDa <b>phosphoprotein</b> in early pre-crisis mouse cells varied in a strain-specific way.

25|$|It {{has been}} shown that osteopontin and bone sialoprotein, bone matrix <b>phosphoproteins,</b> are highly {{efficient}} in vitro TRAP substrates, which bind to osteoclasts when phosphorylated. Upon partial dephosphorylation, both osteopontin and bone sialoprotein are incapable of binding to osteoclasts.

Odontoblasts increase in size, eliminating the availability of any extracellular resources to contribute to an organic matrix for mineralization.

40|$|The {{effect of}} calmodulin on the {{formation}} and decomposition of the Ca 2 +-dependent <b>phosphoprotein</b> intermediate of the (Mg 2 + + Ca 2 +) -dependent ATPase in erythrocyte membranes was investigated. In the presence of 60 microM-Ca 2 + and 25 microM-MgCl 2, calmodulin (0. 5 - 1. 5 microgram) did not alter the steady-state concentration of the <b>phosphoprotein,</b> but increased its rate of decomposition. Higher calmodulin concentrations significantly decreased the steady-state concentration of <b>phosphoprotein.</b> Calmodulin (0. 5 - 1. 7 microgram) increased Ca 2 +-transport ATPase activity by increasing the turnover rate of its <b>phosphoprotein</b> intermediate. Increasing the MgCl 2 concentration from 25 microM to 250 microM increased the (Mg 2 + + Ca 2 +) -dependent ATPase activity, but decreased the concentration of the <b>phosphoprotein</b> intermediate. Similarly to calmodulin, MgCl 2 increased the turnover rate of the Ca 2 +-transport ATPase complex (about 3 -fold). At the higher MgCl 2 concentration calmodulin did not further affect the decomposition of the <b>phosphoprotein</b> intermediate. It was concluded that both calmodulin and MgCl 2 increase the turnover of the Ca 2 +-pump by enhancing the decomposition of the Ca 2 +-dependent <b>phosphoprotein</b> intermediate...|$|R
40|$|Experiments were {{designed}} to produce and characterize a polyclonal antibody directed against mouse dentine <b>phosphoprotein,</b> the major non-collagenous protein of the dentine extracellular matrix. Dental extracellular matrix proteins from 2 -day-postnatal Swiss-Webster-mouse tooth organs were extracted with 0. 5 M-acetic acid, followed by 4 M-guanidinium chloride/ 0. 5 M-EDTA. Mouse dentine <b>phosphoprotein</b> yields were further increased by precipitation with 1 M-CaCl 2. Final purification was achieved by excising and eluting dentine <b>phosphoprotein</b> polypeptide bands from preparative sodium dodecyl sulphate/urea/polyacrylamide gels. Mouse dentine <b>phosphoprotein</b> is a single component of approx. 72 kDa and has a characteristic amino acid composition of 33 % aspartic acid and 55 % serine/phosphoserine. A polyclonal antibody was raised in rabbits against purified mouse dentine <b>phosphoprotein</b> and was shown to be monospecific by enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent, dot-immunobinding and 'Western transfer' assays. This antibody was used to detect the expression and localization of dentine <b>phosphoprotein</b> in 1 -day-postnatal mouse tooth organs. This antigen was localized intracellularly within the monolayer of odontoblasts, which line {{the perimeter of the}} dental papilla mesenchyme, and within the odontoblastic cell processes, which traverse the predentine matrix.

The influence of the measles virus <b>phosphoprotein</b> on nucleocapsid assembly has been studied using a vaccinia virus recombinant encoding both the nucleoprotein and the <b>phosphoprotein.</b> Infection of cells with the virus recombinant resulted {{in the formation of}} cytoplasmic inclusions in which the nucleoprotein and the <b>phosphoprotein</b> colocalized. Electron microscopic examination suggested that these inclusions contained characteristic nucleocapsid filaments. The buoyant density of nucleocapsids assembled {{in the presence of the}} <b>phosphoprotein</b> was found to be slightly higher than that of nucleocapsids assembled in its absence. Furthermore, the <b>phosphoprotein</b> partially inhibited the formation of nucleocapsids, a process which was extremely efficient when the nucleoprotein was expressed alone.

This study compared {{the location and}} gene and protein expression of secreted <b>phosphoprotein</b> 1 in placental and uterine tissues supplying a normally sized and the smallest fetus carried by hyperprolific Large White and Meishan gilts on Days 41 - 42 of pregnancy. Immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization showed that the protein and gene encoding secreted <b>phosphoprotein</b> 1 were located in the glandular and luminal epithelium of the endometrium and in the placenta. Secreted <b>phosphoprotein</b> 1 protein levels were higher in glandular epithelium, luminal epithelium, and placenta from Meishan gilts compared to corresponding tissues from hyperprolific Large White gilts. Reverse transcription quantitative PCR demonstrated secreted <b>phosphoprotein</b> 1 mRNA levels were higher in endometrium, but not placenta, from Meishan compared to hyperprolific Large White gilts. In hyperprolific Large White gilts, secreted <b>phosphoprotein</b> 1 protein levels were higher in glandular epithelium and placenta surrounding small fetuses than corresponding tissues supplying normal-sized fetuses. Similarly, in Meishan gilts, secreted <b>phosphoprotein</b> 1 protein levels were higher in luminal epithelium surrounding small compared to normal-sized fetuses. Within hyperprolific Large White, but not Meishan, gilts secreted <b>phosphoprotein</b> 1 mRNA was higher in endometrium surrounding the normal-sized fetus than the control fetus. The contradictory relationship between fetal size and secreted <b>phosphoprotein</b> 1 protein and mRNA in the hyperprolific Large White is intriguing and may reflect breed differences in posttranslational modification.

40|$|A 47 kDa <b>phosphoprotein</b> is {{involved}} in the respiratory-burst oxidase of phagocytic cells. After stimulation of neutrophils with phorbol myristate acetate, this <b>phosphoprotein</b> was identified in both the cytosol and membranes.

Dose-response curves for accumulation of <b>phosphoprotein</b> in the two sites were very similar, whereas the detection of the <b>phosphoprotein</b> in the cytosol preceded that in the membranes. The membrane-associated 47 kDa <b>phosphoprotein</b> was absent from the neutrophils of patients with X-chromosome-linked chronic granulomatous disease, which lack cytochrome b- 245, and intermediate levels were detected in the membranes of their heterozygote carrier mothers. Activation of the neutrophil oxidase system appears to be dependent upon phosphorylation of the cytosolic 47 kDa protein and its association with cytochrome b- 245 in the membranes.

50|$|While phosphoproteomics {{has greatly}} {{expanded}} {{knowledge about the}} numbers and types of <b>phosphoproteins,</b> along with their role in signaling networks, there are still several limitations to these techniques. To begin with, isolation methods such as anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies do not distinguish between isolating tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins and proteins associated with tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins. Therefore, even though phosphorylation dependent protein-protein interactions are very important, {{it is important to}} remember that a protein detected by this method is not necessarily a direct substrate of any tyrosine kinase. Only by digesting the samples before immunoprecipitation can isolation of only <b>phosphoproteins</b> and temporal profiles of individual phosphorylation sites be produced. Another limitation is that some relevant proteins will likely be missed since no extraction condition is all encompassing. It is possible that proteins with low stoichiometry of phosphorylation, in very low abundance, or phosphorylated as a target for rapid degradation will be lost. Bioinformatics analyses of low-throughput phosphorylation data together with high-throughput phosphoproteomics data (based mostly on MS/MS) estimate that current high-throughput protocols, after several repetitions are capable of capturing 70% to 95% of total <b>phosphoproteins,</b> but only 40% to 60% of total phosphorylation sites.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Wnt 3 a stimulates {{cellular}} trafficking of key signaling elements (e. g., Axin, Dishevelled- 2, β-catenin, and {{glycogen synthase}} kinase- 3 β) and primitive endoderm formation in mouse F 9 embryonic teratocarcinoma cells. Results The role of <b>phosphoprotein</b> phosphatase- 2 A in signaling of the Wnt/β-catenin/Lef-Tcf-sensitive gene activation pathway was investigated. Wnt 3 a action attenuates <b>phosphoprotein</b> phosphatase- 2 A activity and stimulates the Lef/Tcf-sensitive gene transcription. Inhibiting <b>phosphoprotein</b> phosphatase- 2 A by okadaic acid, by treatment with siRNA (targeting the C-subunit of the enzyme), or by expression of SV 40 small t antigen mimics Wnt 3 a action, increasing the cellular abundance of Axin and phospho-glycogen synthase kinase- 3 β {{as well as}} the trafficking of signaling elements in the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. Although mimicking effects of Wnt 3 a on the cellular abundance and trafficking of key signaling elements in the Wnt canonical pathway, suppression of phosphatase- 2 A alone did not provoke activation of the Lef/Tcf-sensitive transcriptional response, but did potentiate its activation by Wnt 3 a. <b>Phosphoprotein</b> phosphatase- 2 A and the scaffold <b>phosphoprotein</b> Dishevelled- 2 display similarities in cellular trafficking in response to either Wnt 3 a or suppression of the phosphatase. A docking site for <b>phosphoprotein</b> phosphatase- 2 A in the DEP domain of Dishevelled- 2 was identified. Conclusion In current study, we showed new roles of <b>phosphoprotein</b> phosphatase- 2 A in Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway: effect on protein expression, effect on protein trafficking, retention of molecules in subcellular compartments, and regulation of enzymatic activity of several key players. Docking of <b>phosphoprotein</b> phosphatase- 2 A by Dishevelled- 2 suppresses phosphatase activity and explains in part the central role of this phosphatase in the counterregulation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. </p...|$|R
