In most systems, a <b>parent</b> <b>process</b> can create an independently executing child process.

50|$|Under Unix and Unix-like {{operating}} systems, {{a process}} is started when its <b>parent</b> <b>process</b> executes a fork system call. The <b>parent</b> <b>process</b> may then {{wait for the}} child process to terminate, or may continue execution (possibly forking off other child processes). When the child process terminates ("dies"), either normally by calling exit, or abnormally due to a fatal error or signal (e.g., SIGTERM, SIGINT, SIGKILL), an exit status is returned to the operating system and a SIGCHLD signal {{is sent to the}} <b>parent</b> <b>process.</b> The exit status can then be retrieved by the <b>parent</b> <b>process</b> via the wait system call.|$|E
5000|$|Process {{creation}} in UNIX and Linux are done through fork (...) or clone (...) system calls. There are several steps involved in process creation.

40|$|Prospective {{associations}} of mothersâ€™ <b>parenting</b> <b>processes,</b> youth disclosure, and youth problem behavior {{were examined in}} a longitudinal design following 244 adolescent sibling dyads over a 3 -year period. For both siblings, authoritative parenting was positively associated with youth disclosure and was negatively related to problem behavior, and coercive parenting was negatively associated with youth disclosure and {{was positively related to}} problem behavior. When the influence of older sibling problem behavior on younger sibling problem behavior was modeled, younger sibling disclosure accounted for the relationship of maternal <b>parenting</b> <b>processes</b> to problem behavior. Findings indicate the important role of sibling influence in the development of problem behavior, contextualizing the relative roles of maternal parenting and youth disclosure in the transmission of risk.

50|$|Threads {{were born}} {{from the idea}} that the most {{efficient}} way for cooperating processes to exchange data would be to share their entire memory space.

Threads are described as lightweight processes because switching between threads does not involve changing the memory context.|$|R
50|$|In a {{strictly}} technical sense, a Unix-like system {{process is a}} daemon when its <b>parent</b> <b>process</b> terminates and the daemon is assigned the init process (process number 1) as its <b>parent</b> <b>process</b> and has no controlling terminal.

50|$|Some {{operating}} systems handle a child process whose <b>parent</b> <b>process</b> has terminated {{in a special}} manner. Such an orphan process becomes a child of a special root process, which then waits for the child process to terminate. Likewise, a similar strategy is used {{to deal with a}} zombie process, which is a child process that has terminated but whose exit status is ignored by its <b>parent</b> <b>process.</b> Such a process becomes the child of a special <b>parent</b> <b>process,</b> which retrieves the child's exit status and allows the operating system to complete the termination of the dead process.

30|$|The {{possible}} mediating role {{of parenting}} {{should be examined}} in future studies. Although we did not assess aspects of parenting in our study, evidence is available suggesting that parental impulsivity contributes to child weight status through <b>parenting</b> <b>processes.</b> <b>Parents</b> can play {{a pivotal role in}} influencing their childâ€™s BMI through their personality characteristics, {{and the way in which}} their personality is translated into parenting. Findings from a meta-analytic review on associations between the major personality factors and parenting showed that effect sizes were significant and robust (Prinzie et al. 2009), in line with the notion that personality affects parenting. This finding has been confirmed in more recent studies (e.g., De Haan et al. 2012; Sleddens et al. 2014). For example, De Haan et al. (2012) reported that the temperamental traits of agreeableness and extraversion were important predictors of parental over-reactivity and warmth. Sleddens et al. (2014) showed that parenting constructs such as nurturance, structure and behavioral control were positively correlated with the temperamental traits of extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness and openness to experience. Parenting constructs such as coercively controlling and overprotecting home environments were positively related to parental neuroticism. Since multiple studies have shown that an authoritative parenting style is associated with healthier child outcomes, including lower BMI values (Sleddens et al. 2011; Pinquart 2014), it is likely that parental impulsivity contributes to child weight status through <b>parenting</b> <b>processes.</b>|$|R

40|$|We study {{generalised}} {{anomalous diffusion}} processes whose diffusion coefficient D(x,t) âˆ¼ D_ 0 |x|^Î±t^Î² depends {{on both the}} position x of the test particle and the process time t. This process thus combines the features of scaled Brownian motion and heterogeneous diffusion <b>parent</b> <b>processes.</b> We compute the ensemble and time averaged mean squared displacements of this generalised diffusion process. The scaling exponent of the ensemble averaged mean squared displacement is shown to be {{the product of the}} critical exponents of the <b>parent</b> <b>processes,</b> and describes both subdiffusive and superdiffusive systems. We quantify the amplitude fluctuations of the time averaged mean squared displacement as function of the length of the time series and the lag time. In particular, we observe a weak ergodicity breaking of this generalised diffusion process: even in the long time limit the ensemble and time averaged mean squared displacements are strictly disparate. When we start to observe this process some time after its initiation we observe distinct features of ageing. We derive a universal ageing factor for the time averaged mean squared displacement containing all information on the ageing time and the measurement time. External confinement is shown to alter the magnitudes and statistics of the ensemble and time averaged mean squared displacements. Comment: 19 pages, 10 figures, IOPLaTe...|$|R

30|$|An {{intimate}} relationship based on mutual understanding and consideration {{is crucial in}} the intergenerational parenting coalition {{but it is difficult}} to establish, especially in families where the coalition is formed between young mothers and their in-laws who did not have strong emotional connection before living together. In the initial stage, conflicts often occur between the young mother and her in-laws due to differences in lifestyle, habits, and even the way of speaking. To avoid conflicts, some families adopted a distancing approach.
