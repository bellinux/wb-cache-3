At that time, 32 patients (32. 7 %) were receiving <b>pinacidil</b> only, 12. 5 mg twice daily; 20 patients (20. 4 %) were receiving <b>pinacidil</b> 25 mg twice daily; and 46 patients (46. 9 %) were receiving <b>pinacidil</b> and HCTZ twice daily. HCTZ was added for incomplete blood pressure control in 15 patients (32. 6 %) and for peripheral edema in 31 patients (67. 4 %). The addition of HCTZ to <b>pinacidil</b> reduced the incidence of edema from 65. 4 % to 15. 2 %. The results of this study suggest that <b>pinacidil</b> was associated with a significant reduction in systolic and diastolic blood pressures in patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension.

The following interventions were applied in the control and during intracoronary infusions of glibenclamide alone or glibenclamide plus <b>pinacidil</b> : 1) intravenous infusion of isoproternol (0. 125 Œºg/kg/min), 2) aortic constriction to raise the mean aortic pressure by 30 %. The slope of the regression line of coronary conductance of mycardial oxygen consumption was significantly decreased with glibenclamide (p< 0. 05), but returned to the baseline with <b>pinacidil,</b> both during isoproterenol infunsion and aortic constriction. Reactive hyperemia following a 20 -sec coronary occlusion was also attennuated with glibenclamide and recovered with <b>pinacidil.</b> These findings suggest that the KATP channel regulates coronary artery tonus during the increase in myocardial oxygen consumption and transient myocardial ischemia...|$|E
40|$|AbstractPurposeGlaucoma is {{characterized}} by increased intraocular pressure (IOP). The effect of nicorandil and <b>pinacidil</b> on IOP in experimentally induced acute and chronic models of glaucoma and the mechanism of action involved were studied. MethodsNew Zealand white rabbits {{were used for the}} study. After the measurement of IOP, nicorandil (1 %), <b>pinacidil</b> (1 %), and pilocarpine as standard (1 %) were instilled topically into the left eye. The other eye served as control. Dextrose (5 %) was used to induce acute glaucoma. IOP changes were recorded every 15 minutes until the pressure became normal. Freshly prepared Œ±-chymotrypsin solution was introduced in the posterior chamber to induce chronic glaucoma. Rabbits with ocular hypertension were selected for the study. Similar drug solutions were used to study the effect on IOP. Glibenclamide, pilocarpine, and indomethacin (1 %) were used to study the mechanism of action of both drugs. The IOPs were measured just prior to drug instillation and at suitable time intervals using a tonometer. ResultsPretreatment with topical nicorandil and <b>pinacidil</b> significantly lowered the rise in IOP in the acute model. Nicorandil and <b>pinacidil</b> initially caused rise in IOP for 15 ‚Äì 30 minutes in chronic glaucoma. This was followed by reduction in IOP. Pretreatment with indomethacin and pilocarpine did not modify the effect of nicorandil and <b>pinacidil</b> on IOP. Pretreatment with glibenclamide blocked IOP from the lowering effect of nicorandil and <b>pinacidil.</b> ConclusionThe oculohypotensive effect shown by these drugs appears to be attributable to enhancement of the aqueous humor outflow. This effect is perhaps mediated through potassium channels...|$|E

Methods: Twenty-four rabbit hearts {{were randomly assigned to}} receive 1 of 3 preservation solutions in a crystalloid-perfused Langendorff model: (1) prototype solution containing a 0. 5 mmol/L concentration of <b>pinacidil,</b> (2) prototype solution without <b>pinacidil</b> as control, and (3) University of Wisconsin solution. Thirty minutes of initial perfusion preceded baseline data acquisition. Data comprised left ventricle pressure-volume curves generated by inflating an intraventricular latex balloon. After cardioplegic administration, hearts underwent 4 hours of hypothermic storage, followed by 60 minutes of reperfusion and postischemic data acquisition. Results: Postischemic developed pressure was better preserved by <b>pinacidil</b> solution (92. 4 % ¬± 4. 5 %) than by the control (74. 9 % ¬± 3. 4 %, P =. 01) and University of Wisconsin solutions (66. 7 % ¬± 5. 1 %, P =. 001). Diastolic negative dP/dT was better preserved by <b>pinacidil</b> solution (104. 4 % ¬± 10. 2 %) than by the control (80. 2 % ¬± 4. 2 %, P =. 034) and University of Wisconsin solutions (71. 7 % ¬± 7. 0 %, P =. 015). Diastolic compliance, expressed as baseline/postischemic diastolic slope ratios, was more poorly preserved by University of Wisconsin solution (0. 67 ¬± 0. 07) than by the <b>pinacidil</b> (0. 88 ¬± 0. 05, P =. 041) and control solutions (0. 87 ¬± 0. 05, P =. 021).

40|$|AbstractObjectives: The {{superiority of}} hyperpolarized arrest with {{adenosine}} triphosphate‚Äìsensitive potassium channel openers over standard hyperkalemic depolarizing cardioplegia during normothermic ischemia has been documented. This {{study examined the}} hypothesis that <b>pinacidil</b> would provide superior protection in a more clinically relevant model of an acutely injured heart and hypothermic cardioplegic arrest. Methods: In a blood-perfused, parabiotic, rabbit heart Langendorff model, hearts underwent 15 minutes of unprotected global normothermic ischemia before the administration of 50 ml of cardioplegic solution at 4 ¬∞ C, followed by 50 minutes of hypothermic (15 ¬∞ C) ischemia and 30 minutes of reperfusion. The cardioplegic solutions administered consisted of Krebs-Henseleit solution alone (N = 6), Krebs-Henseleit solution with <b>pinacidil</b> (50 Œºmol/L; N = 10), Krebs-Henseleit solution with <b>pinacidil</b> (50 Œºmol/L) and glibenclamide (a potassium channel blocker, 10 Œºmol/L; N = 8), or St. Thomas' Hospital solution (N = 8). The percent recovery of developed pressure, linear diastolic pressure-volume relationships, and coronary blood flow were compared. Results: The percent recovery of developed pressure was 32. 8 % ¬± 2. 8 %, 43. 0 % ¬± 4. 3 %, 46. 5 % ¬± 2. 2 %, and 49. 3 % ¬± 2. 7 % for the Krebs-Henseleit, the Krebs-Henseleit with <b>pinacidil</b> and glibenclamide, the St. Thomas' Hospital, and the Krebs-Henseleit with <b>pinacidil</b> groups, respectively. No hearts had ventricular fibrillation on reperfusion. Conclusions: During hypothermic hyperpolarized arrest, as opposed to normothermic ischemia as in our previous studies, there was neither an increased incidence of ventricular fibrillation nor prolonged electrical activity when compared with results during traditional hyperkalemic arrest. Myocardial protection by St. Thomas' Hospital solution and <b>pinacidil</b> was superior (p = 0. 009) to that with Krebs-Henseleit solution alone.

40|$|Background. <b>Pinacidil</b> {{is known}} to augment a time-independent outward current in cardiac tissues by {{activating}} the ATP-regulated potassium channels. Activation of this current, IK. ATP, {{is thought to be}} responsible for increased potassium permeability in ischemia. The contribution of IK. ATP activation to arrhythmogenesis and the role of activation of this current in suppression of arrhythmias are areas of great interest and debate. Because electrical depression attending myocardial ischemia is more accentu-ated in ventricular epicardium than in endocardium, we endeavored to contrast the effects of pinacidil-induced IK. ATP activation on the electrophysiology of canine ventricular epicardium and endocardium. Methods and Results. Standard microelectrode techniques were used. <b>Pinacidil</b> (1 to 5 umol/L) produced a marked dispersion of repolarization and refractoriness in isolated canine ventricular epicardium as well as between epicardium and endocardium. In endocardium, <b>pinacidil</b> abbreviated action potential duration (APD, 0) and refractoriness by 8. 0 ¬± 2. 3 %. In epicardium, the effects of <b>pinacidil</b> were nonhomo-geneous. At some sites, <b>pinacidil</b> induced an all-or-none repolarization at the end of phase 1 of the action potential, resulting in 55. 5 ¬± 8. 7 % abbreviation ofAPD, 0 and refractoriness.

40|$|The {{effects of}} K+ channel opener, <b>pinacidil</b> on contractions {{provoked}} by contraction-stimulating KCl were investigated on isolated uterus of non-pregnant rats in oestrus. <b>Pinacidil</b> produced a more potent inhibition of 20 mM KCl-elicited contractions (pD 2 = 6. 57 ŒºM) than of 40 or 80 mMKCl-elicited contractions (pD 2 = 5. 11 and 5. 19 ŒºM, respectively). Glibenclamide, a selective blocker of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) -sensitive K+ (KATP) channels, antagonized the pinacidil-induced inhibition of contractions elicited by 20 mM KCl {{in a competitive}} manner. However, the pinacidil-induced inhibition of contractions provoked by 40 and 80 mM KCl glibenclamide was unable to prevent them. <b>Pinacidil</b> ability to completely relax the non-pregnant uterus pre-contracted with K+-rich solution suggests that K+ channelindependent mechanism(s) also plays a part in its relaxant effect...|$|E
40|$|The {{classical}} ATP sensitive K+ (KATP) {{channels are}} composed of a sulphonylurea receptor (SUR) and an inward rectifying K+ channel subunit (BIR/Kir 6. 2). They are the targets of vasorelaxant agents called K+ channel openers, such as <b>pinacidil</b> and nicorandil. In order to examine the tissue selectivity of <b>pinacidil</b> and nicorandil, in vitro, we compared {{the effects of these}} agents on cardiac type (SUR 2 A/Kir 6. 2) and vascular smooth muscle type (SUR 2 B/Kir 6. 2) of the KATP channels heterologously expressed in HEK 293 T cells, a human embryonic kidney cell line, by using the patch-clamp method. In the cell-attached recordings (145 [*]mM K+ in the pipette), <b>pinacidil</b> and nicorandil activated a weakly inwardly-rectifying, glibenclamide-sensitive 80 [*]pS K+ channel in both the transfected cells. In the whole-cell configuration, <b>pinacidil</b> showed a similar potency in activating the SUR 2 B/Kir 6. 2 and SUR 2 A/Kir 6. 2 channels (EC 50 of ‚àº 2 and ‚àº 10 [*]ŒºM, respectively). On the other hand, nicorandil activated the SUR 2 B/Kir 6. 2 channel > 100 times more potently than the SUR 2 A/Kir 6. 2 (EC 50 of ‚àº 10 [*]ŒºM and > 500 [*]ŒºM, respectively). Thus, nicorandil, but not <b>pinacidil,</b> preferentially activates the KATP channels containing SUR 2 B.
