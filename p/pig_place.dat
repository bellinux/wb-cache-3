40|$|This {{case study}} {{demonstrates}} the economic value of using an early-warning tool to detect respiratory diseases {{on a commercial}} pig fattening farm. The early-warning tool used is the SOMO® respiratory distress monitor developed by SoundTalks NV, which automatically and continuously calculates a respiratory distress index and raises an alarm when respiratory problems occur in a pig building. During the experiments on a pig fattening farm in the Netherlands, SOMO devices were installed in 4 identical compartments, each containing 72 pigs, and recordings were made {{for the duration of}} the fattening round. The study was blinded, in that output of SOMO system were analysed retrospectively by the authors, i. e. the farmer was not given access to the warnings during the trial. The management decisions taken by the farmer were done the normal way, and treatment decisions were made in consultation with his veterinarian. During the study 2 compartments of pigs contracted respiratory illness, resulting in antibiotic treatment by the veterinarian. Results showed that the SOMO respiratory distress monitor gave a warning 14 days before the farmer noticed the problem in one compartment and 4 days in the other. The subsequent economic analysis showed that early detection using the SOMO system has the potential to increase the margin of income over feed cost by 10. 7 € per <b>pig</b> <b>place</b> per year in the batch affected by respiratory problems. Compensating for the fact that not all batches are affected by respiratory problems, on average for this farm, early detection can increase the margin of income over feed cost by 6. 5 € per <b>pig</b> <b>place</b> per year. status: accepte...|$|E

In total, 310 batches from 244 grower-finishing farms, consisting of 454 855 Pietrain sired pigs in six Spanish pig companies were used. Data collection consisted of a survey on management practices (season of placement, split-sex by pens, number of pig origins, water source in the farm, initial or final BW) and facilities (floor, feeder, ventilation or number of animals placed) during 2008 and 2009. Results indicated that batches of <b>pigs</b> <b>placed</b> between January and March had higher TFI (P= 0. 006), FCR (P= 0. 005) and MORT (P= 0. 03) than those placed between July and September. Moreover, batches of <b>pigs</b> <b>placed</b> between April and June had lower MORT (P= 0. 003) than those placed between January and March. Batches which had split-sex pens had lower TFI (P= 0. 001) and better FCR (P< 0. 001) than those with mixed-sex in pens; pigs fed with a single-space feeder with incorporated drinker also had the lowest TFI (P< 0. 001) and best FCR (P< 0. 001) in comparison to single and multi-space feeders without a drinker. <b>Pigs</b> <b>placed</b> in pens with < 50 % slatted floors presented an improvement in FCR (P< 0. 05) than pens with 50 % or more slatted floors. Batches filled with pigs from multiple origins had higher MORT (P< 0. 001) than those from a single origin. Pigs housed in barns that performed manual ventilation control presented higher MORT (P< 0. 001) in comparison to automatic ventilation. The regression analysis also indicated that pigs which entered to grower-finisher facilities with higher initial BW had lower MORT (P< 0. 05) and finally pigs which were sent to slaughterhouse with a higher final BW presented higher TFI (P< 0. 001). The variables selected for each dependent variable explained 61. 9 %, 24. 8 % and 20. 4 % of the total variability for TFI, FCR and MORT, respectively.

Handling of the manure and reducing emissions {{have to be taken}} into account in the design of pig facilities, so the called integrated pig facilities are being developed in which the energy in the exhaust air can be used to evaporate water from liquid manure. The objective of this research was to link an existing dynamic simulation model for indoor climate calculation to a newly developed simulation model for manure evaporation, allowing annualised calculation of evaporation. The physical processes that occur in the liquid manure evaporator were described in a dynamic simulation model. This model was validated with experiments carried out in a laboratory facility. This model underestimated the evaporation with an average of 15 · 4 %. Some explanations were given. Model calculation of the evaporation at annual basis shows that per fattening <b>pig</b> <b>place</b> 0 · 38 to 0 · 41 m 3 liquid manure per year can be evaporated. To increase the evaporation level, thermal energy can be added. The linking of two simulation models was successful.

40|$|Pig growth {{simulation}} models {{are used to}} determine feeding strategies that improve profitability on commercial farms. For a given farm, the number of diets fed, their energy, amino acid content, the quantity fed and the diet period can vary, thus giving {{a very large number}} of possible feeding strategies (F, as many as 10 ⁵⁰). Adding nonlinear optimisation methods to a growth model allows us to find an Fyielding the maximum for a given objective function, usually the gross margin per pig or per <b>pig</b> <b>place</b> and year. Our simulation program links a linear program for a least-cost diet formulation, a stochastic pig growth model and a genetic algorithm (GA) to find the Fgiving a best solution. When finding Ffor maximum profitability, the gross margin obtained by the GA is higher than that found by random search or by feeding pigs to their maximal lean growth. In the growth model, pig genotypes are characterised by the maximal protein deposition potential (Pdmax), minimum lipid to protein ratio (MinLP) and the energy intake potential (p). In the model, variances and covariances of these quantities are used to grow a population of pigs instead of a single pig. A simulation study was conducted to investigate how different pig genotypes and different relative economic weightings for gross margin and nitrogen excretion affect the nitrogen retention and profitability. It was found that a large increase in nitrogen retention can be achieved through diet optimisation before profitability is compromised and that a lean genotype will have better nitrogen retention. Adding stochasticity to the model for a given population size showed that as the variances increase the variability in gross margin increases and with unchanging variances, the variability in gross margin decreases as the population size increases. Overall, using a feeding schedule which maximises gross margin for a single pig within a population of pigs results in a lower gross margin. 8 page(s...|$|E
40|$|Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome (PRRS) infections play an {{important}} role in Porcine Respiratory Disease Complex (PRDC). The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of implementing a PRRS MLV vaccine, as an aid to control PRDC, on the antibiotic use in piglets and fatteners. The study was performed in a wean-to-finish farm. Piglets were vaccinated upon arrival. In 2012, piglets were only vaccinated against Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae (M. hyo) with Ingelvac MycoFLEX®. As from 2013, Ingelvac® PRRS MLV was applied at the same time as the Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae (M. hyo) vaccine, at the other side of the neck. The reason for implementing the PRRS MLV vaccine were PRDC problems occurring at the end of 2012, including cough and poor performance in the nursery and fattening period. Presence of the PRRS virus was confirmed by serology. A retrospective analysis of the antibiotic use and costs was performed over a 1 -year-period before implementation of PRRS vaccination, an intermediate period of 6 months (PRRS vaccinated and non-vaccinated pigs were present) and a period of 1 year in which only PRRS vaccinated pigs were present on the farm. In the period before PRRS vaccination, 18. 56 g active substance/pig place/year was used, equal to an average of 29. 3 daily doses/animal year. In the transition period, the antibiotic consumption equalled 20. 82 g active substance/pig place/year or 33. 6 daily doses/animal year. In the period after the PRRS vaccine implementation, 12. 04 g active substance/pig place/year or 13. 5 daily doses/animal year was used. The antibiotic costs equalled respectively 3. 40 €, 4. 35 €, 1. 85 € per <b>pig</b> <b>place</b> per year in the 3 subsequent periods. Antibiotic use expressed in daily doses/animal year was reduced by 53. 9 % and antibiotic costs by 45. 6 % after implementation of PRRS vaccination compared to the period before PRRS vaccination.

40|$|SUMMARY An {{interdisciplinary}} research program on organic pig production, EKOPIG, was financed by FORMAS and by SLU. Part IV of EKOPIG {{was carried out}} at SLU-Alnarp and emphasis was on housing systems for organic growing-finishing pigs. In this part, an animal house for organic growing-finishing pigs was built. The planning and construction of the building is described in this report. When planning {{the design of the}} animal house, a number of principles were taken into consideration. Among others, the pigs should be easy to control and monitor. It should also be easy to control feeding and production, to weigh the pigs, and to send them to slaughter. The labour requirement should be minimized by using automatic manure and feeding systems. The building construction should be simple, uninsulated, and self-ventilating, and to a major extent be constructed of locally available wooden material. In addition, dung contact between the animal groups should be avoided [...] The house had room for 128 growing-finishing pigs distributed into 8 pens of 16 pigs each (Figure 8). There were two different pen types, of which one had deep straw bedding (Figure 15), and the other had slanted floors and the “straw-flow” system (Figures 12 and 16). The pens were designed according to the EU and KRAV regulations (with or without letting the animals go outside). The total pen area was 1. 5 m 2 per pig inside and 1 m 2 per pig outside on the concrete area. The building was constructed at JBT’s research farm for pig studies at Odarslöv, and had bearing outer walls and framework roof trusses. The animal house was located near the existing manure container (Figures 1 and 2). The concrete floor was poured on location (Figure 3) upon which walls were built up of cavity cement blocks. The sides of the dung channel and the wall towards the animal area were also built of cavity cement blocks (Figure 4). The lower section of the wall was built of lightclinker blocks which were plastered on both sides, and above this section the wall was made of a wooden frame covered with wood panels (Figure 5). The roof consisted of cement fiber plates (Figure 6). There was natural ventilation due to the wooden slats on the walls and an open roof ridge with transparent covering. The roof ridge was furnished with a wind shield and was solid the first 4 m from each gable. The pen with the straw flow system had a lying area which was covered and a floor profile slanting to the dung channel (Figure 16). All the pens were placed in a row with openings towards the north (Figure 13) facing the concrete area and pasturage. An inspection passage was placed along one of the outside walls (Figure 9). The concrete outside lying area had the same design for all of the pens (Figure 14). The floor profile for the pens and concrete areas are shown in Figures 10 and 11. The pigs were fed using an automatic dry feed system (Figure 18) in transverse troughs (Figure 17), and over the troughs water pipes with nose valves were placed so the pigs had the possibility of wetting the feed. Roughage was distributed in containers placed in the concrete area on the stable walls (Figures 19 and 20). The pigs had free access to water via a water cup located in the dung alley (Figure 21). The water installations were protected from frost using an electric heating cable inserted in the water pipes in the animal house. Ordinary straw was used as bedding and it was handled in the form of big bales transported into the house using a tractor with a front loader (Figure 22). The dung from the animal house was managed both as solid and liquid manure. The pens with deep straw bedding were cleaned using a front loader once per batch, and the dung transported to an area for solid dung located near the animal house. The pens which had slanted floors were kept clean via the activity of the animals. Straw was distributed to the lying area and much of the straw carried out to the pen floor. Due to the animals’ activity it ended up in the dung area (10 % slant) {{at the lower end of}} the pen. There it was mixed with the dung and pressed down by the pigs through an opening between the floor and the pen wall (Figure 23). A dung alley/channel with concrete slats connected all the pens (Figure 24), and it was scraped daily using a cable driven scraper (Figure 25). The dung was moved to a pump well and then pumped over to a storage container. The manure was mixed before pumping by pumping it around (Figure 7) the dung channel on the outside area. During the planning phase for the animal house, many calculations for the use of feed, water, straw and as well as the quantities of dung and urine which would be produced were carried out (Table 1) An estimation of the building costs was carried out with the help of the data for cost estimation for farm production buildings obtained from the Swedish Board of Agriculture (Table 8). The present calculation was based on the prices for 2002, and the estimated cost for the animal house was 1, 465, 000 SKK, or 11, 450 SKK per <b>pig</b> <b>place.</b> The building area per pig was 3. 9 m 2 including the service areas. The cost of the manure containers and straw storage was not included in this estimation. The size of the pasture areas was calculated and consideration was taken to the recommendations for maximum nitrogen and phosphorus loading (Tables 2 – 5) per ha for pigs on pasture. An estimation was made of the amount of the produced manure which would remain in the house or be on the outside areas. For 4 of the 8 pens (Figure 26) fenced lots were made (Figure 28) which the pigs had access to in the summer months. Special transport alleys (Figure 27) out to these lots were also built to maintain a good longevity for these hard used areas. The pasture lots were established with a wide range of grasses (Table 6) which were completed later with more diverse species (Table 7) ...|$|E
