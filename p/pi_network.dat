The combination of the 180 degree phase shift (i.e. inverting gain) from the <b>pi</b> <b>network,</b> and the negative gain from the inverter, results in a positive loop gain (positive feedback), making the bias point set by R1 unstable and leading to oscillation.|$|E

This paper reviews the theoretical lower limit on the required number of matching states to match VSWR ranges and then presents an analysis of hardware implementations to actually implement a suitable switchable matching network. A number of matching network topologies are analyzed: <b>PI</b> <b>networks,</b> loaded transmission lines, branch line coupler based circuits, single circulators and cascaded circulators. In our investigation only narrow-band applications are targeted. For the various circuit implementations the required number of matching states for each hardware implementation is compared to the theoretical minimum number of states required for the same matching in order to benchmark their hardware implementation overhead. It appears that a matching network using cascaded circulators is the closest to the theoretical optimum for networks with a relatively low number of states: this type of matching network was implemented and analyzed in more detail...|$|R
40|$|In this work, {{the concept}} of {{mechanically}} adjustable MR receiver coil arrays is proposed and implemented for the specific case of human wrist imaging. An eight-channel wrist array for proton MRI at 3 Tesla was constructed and evaluated. The array adjusts to the individual anatomy by a mechanism that fits a configuration of flexible coil elements closely around the wrist. With such adjustability, {{it is challenging to}} ensure robust electrical behavior and signal-to-noise (SNR) performance. These requirements are met by preamplifier decoupling and a suitable matching strategy based on <b>pi</b> <b>networks</b> that render the coil responses robust against changes in tuning, loading and mutual coupling. The robustness of the resulting SNR yield was studied by varying the effective coil matching over a wide range in a phantom imaging experiment. While SNR variation of up to 25 % was observed at the surface of the phantom the SNR was essentially constant in the critical center region. A second SNR study in wrist phantoms of different sizes confirmed the benefits of bringing the coil elements very close, up to 3 mm, to the individual target volume. These findings were supported by initial in vivo imaging, exploiting high-sensitivity detection for highly resolved structural imaging. Copyright 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc...|$|R

50|$|The {{majority}} of modern transmitting equipment {{is designed to}} operate with a resistive load fed via coaxial cable of a particular characteristic impedance, often 50 ohms. To connect the power stage of the transmitter to this coaxial cable transmission line a matching network is required. For solid state transmitters this is typically a broadband transformer which steps up the low impedance of the output devices to 50 ohms. A tube transmitter will contain a tuned output network, most commonly a <b>PI</b> <b>network,</b> that steps the load impedance which the tube requires down to 50 ohms. In each case the power producing devices will not transfer power efficiently if the network is detuned or badly designed or if the antenna presents other than 50 ohms at the transmitter output. Commonly an SWR meter and/or directional wattmeter are used to check {{the extent of the}} match between the aerial system and the transmitter via the transmission line (feeder). A directional wattmeter indicates forward power, reflected power, and often SWR as well. Each transmitter will specify a maximum allowable mismatch based on efficiency, distortion, and possible damage to the transmitter.

40|$|With data {{transfer}} rates and clock frequencies ever increasing and encroaching on radio frequencies, {{the need for}} EMI filters has increased dramatically. At the same time, the portability of electronic devices such as PDAs, laptop computers, MP 3 players and so on, {{the need to protect}} those devices from ESD has also increased because use of peripheral interfaces. Some time ago these two functions were independent of each other with discrete components making the EMI filter and a separate device to provide the ESD protection. As consumer electronics continue to get smaller, the ESD and EMI filter functions were gradually integrated together. For ESD protection, a TVS diode would typically be used. TVS diodes are nothing more than Zener diodes that have been modified to handle large currents for very brief periods of time while “clamping ” at some voltage slightly over the peak operating voltage. A TVS diode with a clamping voltage of 6. 0 V would be used in applications where the maximum operating voltage was 3. 3 V. There is a limit however, to the TVS’s ability to clamp. That is a given TVS can only dissipate so much power in those short periods of time. A way to improve this is to increase the size of the TVS. A larger device can handle more current than a similar but smaller device, but at a cost, more capacitance. EMI filters have in the past been RC or LC <b>pi</b> <b>networks</b> using individual surface mount components. One of the main problems with using discrete components is that there are parasitics that can negatively affect the performance of the filter.

In the transmit mode, TX B+ {{is applied to the}} circuit to bias the diodes “on”. The shunt diode (CR 161) shorts out the receiver port, and the <b>pi</b> <b>network,</b> which oper-ates as a quarter wave transmission line, transforms the low impedance of the shunt diode to a high imped-ance at the input of the harmonic filter. In the receive mode, the diodes are both off, and hence, there exists a low attenuation path between the antenna and receiver ports. The harmonic filter consists of part of C 122, L 121, and C 123. This filter attenuates the harmonic of the module to a level better than- 55 dBc. To optimize the transmitter and receiver performance into the antenna, a network is used to match the antenna’s impedance to the harmonic filter. The net-work is made up of C 125 and L 122. The power control circuit consists of the networks associated with U 151, Q 151, Q 155, and U 111. U 111 is a directional coupler which detects the forward power of the power module U 101.

40|$|Background: Scientists in {{pharmaceutical}} as well {{as academic}} research work together to solve the challenging puzzle from the basic causes of disease {{at the level of}} genes, proteins and cells up to a marketed new drug. Analyses of mode of action (MoA) of new chemical entities (NCEs) are a very important step in the development of new drugs. One distinguishes between effects induced by modulating the compounds’ actual target protein (on-target effects) and effects induced by additional, possibly unknown targets (off-target effects). Quite often knowledge about either of these effects is limited. Since MoA is mainly triggered by the interplay of proteins or signaling cascades, investigating the change and subsequent influence of the changed molecules in a protein interaction (<b>PI)</b> <b>network</b> is a promising initial step to further analyses. As more and more data from diverse sources becomes available, the integration of this knowledge is important for generating a deeper insight into biology. In addition, expression experiments based on disease tissue and/or compound treatment are frequently conducted to get insight into transcriptional changes that could explain compounds’ MoA. Status quo: MoA could be analyzed by investigating those parts of a <b>PI</b> <b>network</b> that show changes based on compound treatment. Mathematical or graph theoretical in silico methods to identify interesting parts of a network based on different criteria are widely used. Criteria range from detection of highly connected subgraphs to subgraphs maximizing weights assigned to parts of the network under investigation. These methods can be transferred to biology and can be used to, e. g. identify condition responsive subnetworks on various types of molecular networks. Present questions addressed mainly focus on the detection of subnetworks enriched in information from functional genomics, e. g. differentially expressed genes. They neglect the existence of distance regulatory functions on the post-transcriptional {{as well as}} post-translational level like miRNA interference or protein phosphorylation. Further, available methods usually detect relatively large modules. It is easily possible that more processes, i. e. the on- and several off-target effects, are covered by one larger module. Thus, the individual effects are difficult to detect and interpret. To be able to derive individual effects, it is necessary to reveal small modules that are related to the individual effects present in the biological system under investigation. Methods & Results: In this work, I made use of a gene expression data set investigating the inhibition of the TGF-beta signaling pathway by different compounds targeting TGF-betaR 1. To gain a sound basis for follow-up analyses, different aspects of how to select the best suited normalization procedure for the underlying expression data are proposed {{in the first part of}} this thesis. To analyze compounds’ MoA, I propose a method that weights interactions between proteins based on different kinds of evidence. In this method, the relevance of the proteins is based on the biological relatedness to other possibly not deregulated protein coding genes. Thereby, analyses are expanded beyond transcriptional deregulation. To elucidate the biological relatedness, information on molecular function, biological processes and cellular compartment, information on transcription factor binding sites and literature-based confidence scores are integrated for weighting the edges between proteins. To transfer the network into the biological context of interest, expression experiments are used as anchoring points for the analyses. Further, I introduce modEx, a method to extract small modules out of a weighted protein interaction network. Modules extracted using modEx reflect the individual effects present in the biological system under investigation. For the expression data set used, the proposed edge scoring is shown to be superior to the widely accepted STRING scoring. Furthermore, modEx extracts modules that represent the underlying mechanism better than jActiveModule, a commonly used subgraph extraction method. These newly proposed approaches are applied to elucidate the MoA, i. e. the on- as well as off-target effects, of compounds. They are shown to grant a more focused view on the effects of compounds than current state-of-the-art methods applied for the analysis of gene expression data...|$|E
