60|$|Hetty still <b>pursed</b> <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> up, {{and when}} she spoke again she {{somewhat}} astonished Ingleby.|$|E
60|$|Branwen <b>pursed</b> <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> {{into the}} form of an O and opened her eyes wide.|$|E
60|$|Stephen hesitated, {{uncertain}} whether to laugh, until he chanced {{to look at}} Virginia. She had <b>pursed</b> <b>her</b> <b>lips.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Let them restore {{him ever}} so much, {{he would never}} be {{anything}} to me, mamma." [...] Then Mrs. Mountjoy would only shake <b>her</b> head and <b>purse</b> <b>her</b> <b>lips.</b>|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Adams <b>pursed</b> <b>her</b> <b>lip</b> {{and shook}} <b>her</b> head. But then {{as she stood}} at the casement, the girl beneath looked smilingly up at her and beckoned to her with a merry gesture to open the window.|$|R
6000|$|... [The PARLOUR MAID and FROST go out. ENID <b>pursing</b> <b>her</b> <b>lips,</b> sits [...] at {{the little}} table, taking up the baby's frock. The [...] PARLOURMAID ushers in MADGE THOMAS and goes out; MADGE stands by [...] the door.] ...|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Kingdom <b>pursed</b> <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> {{together}} {{to suppress the}} words {{she was afraid to}} utter, and rang the bell.|$|E
6000|$|Pity {{seized on}} Frances Freeland for these little derelicts, whose heads and pinafores and faces were so clean. She <b>pursed</b> <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> very tight and said: ...|$|E
60|$|And looking {{straight}} down her pretty nose, dainty Lady Alicia Wrenford <b>pursed</b> <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> {{and put on}} the starchy airs of a soured matron of forty.|$|E
60|$|The landlady tossed <b>her</b> head, and <b>pursed</b> up <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> disparagingly.|$|R
6000|$|RAINA. Don't {{leave my}} mother, Louka, whilst the {{soldiers}} are here. (Louka glances at Raina, at the ottoman, at the curtain; then <b>purses</b> <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> secretively, laughs to herself, and goes out. Raina follows her to the door, shuts it behind her with a slam, and locks it violently. The man immediately steps {{out from behind the}} curtain, sheathing his sabre, and dismissing the danger from his mind in a businesslike way.) ...|$|R
60|$|Diana <b>pursed</b> up <b>her</b> <b>lips,</b> put <b>her</b> black head on {{one side}} critically, and finally {{pronounced}} {{in favor of the}} beads, which were thereupon tied around Anne's slim milk-white throat.|$|R
6000|$|Old Heythorp took up {{the long}} green glass, drained it, and {{repressing}} fumes and emotion went on with his partridge. His daughter <b>pursed</b> <b>her</b> <b>lips,</b> {{took a sip of}} water, and said: ...|$|E
6000|$|Miss Schuyler <b>pursed</b> <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> reflectively. [...] "Well," [...] she said, [...] "he's not New York. Quite {{a good-looking}} man, {{with a good}} deal in him, but I'd {{like to see him}} on horseback. Been in the cavalry? You're fond of them, you know." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You wouldn't credit how he bites. 'E's nobbut two teeth, {{but they}} like six needles." [...] She drew her brows {{together}} and <b>pursed</b> <b>her</b> <b>lips,</b> {{saying to the}} child, [...] "Naughty lad, naughty lad! Tha' shanna hae it, no, not if ter bites thy mother like that." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{tall woman}} drew up her angular {{shoulders}} and <b>pursed</b> up <b>her</b> thin <b>lips.</b>|$|R
60|$|During this conversation, Mrs Nickleby had {{regarded}} {{the man with}} a severe and steadfast look. She now heaved a profound sigh, and <b>pursing</b> up <b>her</b> <b>lips,</b> shook <b>her</b> head in a slow and doubtful manner.|$|R
60|$|Bad as {{the state}} of matters was, however, it was not quite so bad as that. The poor girl's first act was to burst into a hysterical fit of laughter--so wonderfully {{constituted}} are some female minds--and she followed that up with an equally hysterical fit of weeping. But to do her justice, the fits did not last above half a minute. Then she suddenly stopped, dried her eyes, jumped up, and, <b>pursing</b> <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> and knitting <b>her</b> brows, ran to her friend, whom she found just returning {{to a state of}} consciousness.|$|R
6000|$|Hetty <b>pursed</b> <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> up reflectively. [...] "Well, why shouldn't he be? It's a {{pleasure}} to see a man of that kind. There are so few of them. Still, I'll try to go a little further. Of course, he's clever. At least, everybody says so, but there's something wanting. I think he's weak." ...|$|E
60|$|She {{looked from}} Macphail to his wife, {{standing}} helplessly {{in different parts}} of the room, like lost souls, and she <b>pursed</b> <b>her</b> <b>lips.</b> She saw that she must take them in hand. Feckless people like that made her impatient, but her hands itched to put everything in the order which came so naturally to her.|$|E
6000|$|Winifred <b>pursed</b> <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> up. [...] "I {{understood}} you {{met him at}} the Grange, and {{you were}} only there for a few weeks once a year. After all, that isn't a very great deal. It seems {{he fell in love with}} you, which is, perhaps, comprehensible. What I don't quite know the reason for is why you fell in love with him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'We shall {{end in the}} work'ouse if {{this goes}} on,' muttered Mrs Clinton, and she <b>pursed</b> up <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> more tightly than ever, {{thinking}} of the explanation she meant to have when her mate came home.|$|R
6000|$|Mrs Gamp {{shook her}} head mysteriously, and <b>pursed</b> up <b>her</b> <b>lips.</b> 'There's fevers of the mind,' she said, 'as well as body. You may take your slime drafts till you flies into the air with efferwescence; but you won't cure that.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Grandma and I {{have been}} alone {{for nearly a}} week; David went off on business; but he's back now and--oh, my goodness! I forgot: I'm not to tell a soul yet;" [...] and Kitty <b>pursed</b> up <b>her</b> <b>lips,</b> looking quite oppressed with some great secret.|$|R
6000|$|... "What's the use o' your {{religion}} {{when it comes}} to this? What sort of religion is in the hearts of these," [...] (she <b>pursed</b> <b>her</b> <b>lips,</b> and paused for an expressive word, but found none), [...] "these rich folk in their silks and satins and broadcloth, with more than they can use, an' feedin' their pampered cats and dogs on what would be wealth to the likes o' me! Religion! bah!" ...|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Otter, who did {{not like}} Clutton, <b>pursed</b> <b>her</b> <b>lips.</b> She did not see {{anything}} out of the way in his work. Foinet sat down and went into technical details. Mrs. Otter grew rather tired of standing. Clutton did not say anything, but nodded now and then, and Foinet felt with satisfaction that he grasped what he said and the reasons of it; most of them listened to him, but it was clear they never understood. Then Foinet got up and came to Philip.|$|E
60|$|A little {{sensation}} followed {{upon his}} words. Miss Ellicot <b>pursed</b> <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> and sat {{a little more}} upright. The lady whose husband had been Mayor of Hartlepool looked at Anna and sniffed. Mrs. White became conscious of a distinct sense of uneasiness, and showed it in her face. She was obliged, as she explained continually to every one who cared to listen, to be so very particular. On the other hand {{the two young men}} who sat on either side of Anna were already throwing murderous glances at the newcomer.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, not {{to myself}} {{or to any}} other person here." [...] Then she was silent; and Miss Altifiorla, <b>pursing</b> up <b>her</b> <b>lips,</b> bethought herself whether the demands made upon her {{friendship}} were not too heavy. But there still remained five days of the visit.|$|R
6000|$|... "She's a good girl," [...] {{he said at}} length. [...] "There is a likeness?"--he {{nodded his}} head at the {{photograph}} of Theresa and sighed. Helen looked at Theresa <b>pursing</b> up <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> before the Cockney photographer. It suggested her in an absurd human way, and she felt an intense desire to share some joke.|$|R
5000|$|Both {{performances}} of [...] "Go Limp" [...] involve {{interaction between the}} artist and her audience. Simone speeds up or slows down her playing at moments when the audience is invited to laugh, provides frequent asides remarking on the song’s absurdity, “forgets” the song’s verses, and offers {{a wide range of}} gestural cues: gazing off into the distance, <b>pursing</b> <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> to conceal a smile, holding back a laugh with tensed shoulders, casting a knowing look to the band, hiding her face in awkwardness, or leaning back in laughter. Notably, Simone forgets a verse in both the In Concert and the 1965 the Netherlands' recordings, and in each case cues this moment with the question “I told you about momma, didn’t I?".|$|R
6000|$|Jacinta <b>pursed</b> <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> as {{she looked}} at him with an {{assumption}} of severity, but she proceeded. [...] "Now, I had arranged for Mrs. Hatherly and Muriel to spend the winter in Grand Canary, but she has heard of a doctor in one of the hotels at Madeira, and is bent on going there. There is, of course, nothing the matter with her; but if she approves of the doctor in question it is very probable that she will stay in that hotel until the spring. Still, she is changeable, and if she doesn't go at once it is possible that she will not go at all. The Madeira boat leaves Las Palmas about half an hour after we get there, and I don't want Mrs. Hatherly and Muriel to catch her. Muriel doesn't want to, either." ...|$|E
60|$|Poor Jo {{would gladly}} have gone under the table, as one thing after another was tasted and left, while Amy giggled, Meg looked distressed, Miss Crocker <b>pursed</b> <b>her</b> <b>lips,</b> and Laurie talked and laughed {{with all his}} might to give a cheerful tone to the festive scene. Jo's one strong point was the fruit, for she had sugared it well, and had a pitcher of rich cream to eat with it. Her hot cheeks cooled a trifle, and she drew a long breath as the pretty glass plates went round, and {{everyone}} looked graciously at the little rosy islands floating in a sea of cream. Miss Crocker tasted first, made a wry face, and drank some water hastily. Jo, who refused, thinking there might not be enough, for they dwindled sadly after the picking over, glanced at Laurie, but he was eating away manfully, though there was a slight pucker about his mouth and he kept his eye fixed on his plate. Amy, who was fond of delicate fare, took a heaping spoonful, choked, hid her face in her napkin, and left the table precipitately.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{wish you}} to believe, Miss O'Mahony, that my {{attachment}} {{to you is}} most devoted." [...] She <b>pursed</b> <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> together and looked straight {{out of her eyes}} at the wall opposite. [...] "We belong to the same class of life, and our careers lie in the same groove." [...] Hereupon she crossed her hands before her on her lap, while her father sat speculating whether she might not have done better to come out on the comic stage. [...] "I wish you to believe that I am quite sincere in the expression which I make of a most ardent affection." [...] Here again he slapped his waistcoat and threw himself into an attitude. He was by no means an ill-looking man, and though he was forty years old, he {{did not appear to be}} so much. He had been a public singer all his life, and was known by Rachel to have been connected for many years with theatres both in London and New York. She had heard many stories as to his amorous adventures, but knew nothing against his character in money matters. He had, in truth, always behaved well to her in whatever pecuniary transactions there had been between them. But he had ventured to make love to her, and had done so in a manner which had altogether disgusted her. She now waited till he paused for a moment in his eloquence, and then she spoke a word.|$|E
60|$|They {{said nothing}} more until they {{approached}} the Range, and as they drove by the outbuildings Agatha glanced about her curiously. It {{occurred to her that}} the homestead did not look quite the same as it had done when Wyllard had been there. A waggon stood near the strawpile without one wheel. A door of the barn hung awkwardly open in a manner which suggested that it needed mending, and the snow had blown inside the building. There was a gap in the side of one sod and pole structure which should evidently have been repaired, and all this and several other things she noticed jarred upon her. They suggested slackness and indifference. Then she saw Mrs. Hastings <b>purse</b> <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> up.|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] she said, relieved, but it {{was some}} time before the desire to write came back to her. Then she told him [...] "The letter is to a woman that was gey cruel to me," [...] adding, with a complacent <b>pursing</b> of <b>her</b> <b>lips,</b> the curious remark, [...] "That's the kind I like to write to best." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am sure," [...] {{said the}} Comtesse, <b>pursing</b> up <b>her</b> thin <b>lips,</b> [...] "that if this Chauvelin wishes to do us mischief, {{he will find}} a {{faithful}} ally in Lady Blakeney." ...|$|R
