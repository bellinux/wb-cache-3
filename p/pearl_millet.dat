Staple foods of Indian cuisine include <b>pearl</b> <b>millet</b> (bājra), rice, whole-wheat flour (aṭṭa), and a variety of lentils, such as masoor (most often red lentils), toor (pigeon peas), urad (black gram), and mong (mung beans). Lentils may be used whole, dehusked—for example, dhuli moong or dhuli urad—or split. Split lentils, or dal, are used extensively. The spice trade between India and Europe is often cited by historians as the primary catalyst for Europe's Age of Discovery.|$|E
5|$|Over 48% of South India's {{population}} {{is engaged in}} agriculture, which is largely dependent on seasonal monsoons. Some of the main crops cultivated in South India include paddy, sorghum, <b>pearl</b> <b>millet,</b> pulses, sugarcane, cotton, chilli and ragi. Areca, coffee, tea, rubber and spices are cultivated on the hilly regions. The staple food is rice; the delta regions of Godavari, Krishna and Kaveri are amongst the top rice producing areas in the country. Frequent droughts have left farmers debt-ridden, forcing them to sell their livestock and sometimes to commit suicide. The region accounts for 92% of the total Coffee production in India. South India is also a major producer of cotton, tea, rubber, turmeric, mangoes and spices. Other major agriculture related produce include silk and poultry.|$|E

40|$|Cue: The {{most obvious}} sign {{of climate change}} in {{southern}} Africa has been the greater frequency of drought. In the past, farmers might expect to get a year of poor rainfall once every five years. Now it seems that droughts are occurring on average once every two years, and this is having a major impact both on the production of food crops {{and the availability of}} feed for livestock. In Zimbabwe, the Matopos research station is engaged in agricultural research to benefit smallholder crop and livestock farmers. The researchers understand well the challenges that the changes in climate are bringing, and have developed several technologies to try to address them. To find out more about these technologies, Sylvia Jiyane spoke to two scientists based at the station. The first was Chrispen Ndebele. IN:		?We have had problems? OUT:		?. shortages in the communal areas. ? DUR?N	 3 ? 54 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Daniel Nkomboni describing some of the new technologies being tested at the Matopos research station in Zimbabwe to help farmers cope with climate change. Transcript Ndebele	We have had problems vis-…-vis the availability of sufficient rainfall in the smallholder sector. So research has really tried to intervene to help the smallholder farmer to survive. And in this aspect we look at giving the smallholder farmer legumes which are early maturing - plus or minus 60 days to maturity; that?s one way to try to address the situation. You grow a crop that will mature in a very small space of time, even though you have got insufficient moisture, you still get something out of it. And at the same time, we have been trying to push small grains, like sorghums and <b>pearl</b> <b>millets.</b> These tend to do well even in marginal rainfall areas. And {{at the same time we}} are looking at some drought tolerant crops like sweet potatoes. We are looking at storage aspects, trying to enhance traditional storage systems, with the hope that some farmers could be irrigating, and then those who do not irrigate, but depend solely on dryland production, could buy sweet potatoes and then store them, so that that could cushion them until such time that their subsequent crop is ready for harvesting. Jiyane		And your research station happens to be in the driest part of the country, which is Region 4 and part of 5. What is research also doing in as far as identifying cropping systems for smallholder farmers? Ndebele	One of the aspects is looking at intercropping; intercropping small grains with legumes. To make sure that the farmer has both the cereal for his carbohydrate needs, and then the legume for the protein needs for the family. Jiyane	The climatic changes do not also spare the livestock side, and with me in the programme is Mr. Daniel Nkomboni who is a higher research technician of the livestock nutrition department of Matopos research unit. He is also going to comment on these climatic changes, how they affect livestock. Nkomboni	Rangelands and pastures have declined in quality and quantity due to the climate change. Matopos research station has come up with technologies which help farmers to ease the feed shortages. Forages have been improved so at to suit the local climate. Drought tolerant forages like bana grass and sweet sorghums are grown and then mixed with legumes to produce silage. The other strategy which the research station has adopted is breeding. Farmers are encouraged to conserve the indigenous livestock, because they can actually adapt to the harsh conditions which are caused by climate change. Matopos research station has actually gone into the conservation of indigenous breeds, namely the Tuli and the Nkone cattle. After conserving these breeds, the research station goes out on outreach programmes to farmers, and distributes the heifers, so that they can actually cross-breed these animals with exotic breeds which they have, so as to get the hardiness of the indigenous breeds. And then there is research which is going on on cactus, as an alternative feed for livestock. Spineless species of cactus have been identified, and this research we think is going to go along way in alleviating the food shortages in the communal areas. End of track. A crops specialist and a livestock specialist from the Matopos research station describe technologies being developed to support smallholder farmers experiencing drough...|$|R

Among the millets of the world, ragi ranks fourth after the Pennisetums, or <b>pearl</b> millet; foxtail <b>millet,</b> Setaria itatica, and Panicum miliaceum or proso millet.

40|$|Southern Africa {{smallholder}} farmers {{continue to}} be the most affected by the challenges of climate change and variability. The variability of climate demands the use of a variety of agronomic strategies and crop choices. Traditional drought tolerant cereal crops such as sorghum and millets are often chosen when drought seasons are anticipated. However, there are certain crops, originating elsewhere, that could help the smallholder farmers increase diversity of crops that can be grown in changed climates. Trials were conducted to test a basket of known and introduced climate smart crops in the field. The cereal crops tested were maize, sorghum, <b>pearl</b> and finger <b>millet,</b> and legumes: tepary bean (Phaseolus acutifolias), cowpea (Vigna unguiculata), Bambara nut (Vigna subterranea), groundnut (Arachis hypogaea) and pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan. A second experiment was conducted {{to determine the effects of}} inorganic fertilizer and rhizobium inoculation on the growth and grain yield of field grown tepary bean. Both experiments were laid out in a randomized complete block design with three replications. Due to drought conditions during the growing season, cereal crops could not produce grain yield, as there was no grain filling. Despite this, cereal biomass was 5 t ha- 1 for maize, followed by sorghum (1. 3 t ha- 1) and millet (1. 2 t ha- 1). Legume crops produced grain with cowpea yielding 568. 1 kg ha- 1 of grain, followed by tepary bean (245. 9 kg ha- 1) and common bean (227 kg ha- 1). This is important for food, nutrition and health security of smallholder communities. Tepary bean inoculated with rhizobium and had fertilizer applied produced higher grain yield than those without fertilizer or rhizobium inoculant (P£ 0. 05). In conclusion, resource poor farmers, affected by drought effects of climate change, can adopt both cereals and legumes climate smart crops, in order to create food and nutritional security. This is crucial for food and nutritional security of vulnerable households affected by climate change and variability...|$|R

40|$|Seven millet {{varieties}} {{grown in}} Sri Lanka (proso, foxtail, finger (Ravi), finger (local), kodo, and little) and India (pearl) {{were used in}} this study. Soluble and bound phenolics obtained by solvent extraction were used to evaluate antioxidant, DNA scission and enzyme inhibitory and antiproliferative activities by several chemical and biological methods. Distribution of phenolics and their antioxidant activity was assessed in dehulled grains and hulls separated by air classification. Phenolic compounds in free, soluble conjugates and insoluble bound fractions were identified and quantified. In addition, accessibility of phenolics in the digestive tract was determined using a simulated in vitro digestion model and colonic fermentation. The contents of total phenolics (TPC),total flavonoids (TFC) and proanthocyanidins (PC) as well as scavenging activities of test compounds were evaluated using superoxide, hydroxyl, peroxyl, 2, 2 -diphenyl-l-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical, H₂O₂, and singlet oxygen. Different concentrations of extract {{were used to determine}} their IC₅₀ values. In addition, the ferrous chelating and reducing activities of extracts were measured. The highest phenolic content of soluble phenolics of millet grains was obtained with 70 % (v/v) acetone for 25 minutes under reflux conditions. The TPC of soluble and insoluble bound phenolic fractions of millet varieties were 7. 2 - 32. 4 and 2. 2 - 81. 6 μmol ferulic acid eq/g defatted meal, respectively. This demonstrates that bound phenolics are important contributors to antioxidant potential of millets. Kodo millet showed the highest soluble phenolic content followed by finger (local), finger (Ravi), little, foxtail, <b>pearl</b> and proso <b>millets.</b> Millets with dark brown pigmented testa and pericarp possessed a higher soluble phenolic content than those with white or yellow testa and pericarp. The TFC of soluble and insoluble extracts were 1. 2 - 33. 7 and 0. 3 - 4. 5 μmol catechin eq (CE) /g defatted meal, respectively. The soluble extracts of finger (local) millet had the highest PC (311. 28 μmol CE/g defatted meal). All varieties exhibited effective radical, H₂O₂ and singlet oxygen inhibition, reducing activity as well as ferrous ion chelating power which varied according to the assay employed and the variety used. Several hydroxybenzoic and hydroxycinnamic acids and flavonoids were identified and quantified by HPLC analysis. In general, ferulic and ρ-coumaric were found to be the major phenolic acids followed by protocatechuic, caffeic, sinapic, ρ-hydroxybenzoic, gentisic, and vanillic acids and their contents depended on the variety and the form present in the grain matrix. Flavonoids identified were flavones, flavan- 3 -ol monomers and dimers, and flavanonols. All seven varieties effectively inhibited oxidation in a pork model system, and stripped corn oil. At a concentration of 0. 5 mg/ml all extracts inhibited oxidation by 16 - 88 % in the linoleic acid emulsion system. All phenolic extracts inhibited Cu (II) -induced human LDL and liposome oxidation and DNA scission. Millet extracts at 0. 05 mg/mL inhibited LDL cholesterol oxidation by 1 - 41 % and exhibited a dose-dependent inhibition of DNA scission. The antiprolifeative studies showed that kodo millet extract inhibited HT- 29 cells proliferation in the range of 75 - 100 % after 4 days of incubation. The hulls from dehulled millets had higher TPC and antioxidant activity compared to their whole, dehulled and cooked grain counterparts. The phenolic extracts of dehulled millet grains, following in vitro enzymic digestion under simulated gastrointestinal conditions and colonic fermentation, showed effective antioxidant activity and were accessible under physiological conditions...|$|R
40|$|It was {{the wicked}} uncle of Aladdin, in the Tales of the Arabian Nights, who offered 'new lamps for old'. He {{wanted to find}} an ancient magic lamp that could give him access to a hoard of {{treasure}} for his own personal use. When agricultural developers talk about 'new' crops, the crops they are thinking about are also not really new but they hope that these crops will lead to far wider prosperity and wealth for farmers, rural communities and even national economies. Throughout history, thousands of species of plants {{have been used by}} man for food but only a few, perhaps 150 or so, have been commercially cultivated. Most people in the world today derive the bulk of their food needs from about twenty plant species - cereals, roots, legumes, sugar cane and sugar beet, coconuts and bananas. This means that plant breeding, crop protection and the development of processing technology have all focused on a handful of major cash crops. This has had a self-perpetuating effect and, by and large, plant species that do not fall within this category are still largely under-exploited; while such minority crops may be highly valued locally as part of a complex farming system, they are not perceived by growers or traders to have commercial potential. This is partly because European food habits have nowadays become fashionable in the tropics, just as heavy denim jeans have also become fashionable. While the trend towards fewer crop varieties is recognized and understood, is it {{in the best interests of}} food security, let alone economic prosperity? There are always risks associated with monoculture, whether from a disease or pest infestation or a collapse in world prices and it is, in any case, hard to make a commercial success of the high volume, low value products upon which ACP economies have traditionally come to depend. A diversified range of high or added value products is economically more attractive, but it has to be admitted that markets for new products are hard to develop. In fact a niche market may be almost as difficult to find as Aladdin's lamp. Plants with potential ACP countries, however, have their own treasures: attractive, nutritious fruit, for example, or plants which may contain compounds of interest to the pharmaceutical industry Agronomic conditions in ACP countries may also be suitable for growing indigenous or exotic crops, oilseeds in particular, that are of value to the plastics and related chemical industries. In Eritrea, for example, vernonia (Vernonia galamensis) is now being commercially cultivated. The plant occurs naturally in West and East Africa, and the seed from its thistle-like flower heads contains 40 % oil. Seed yields of 1. 5 t/ha can be obtained. Vernonia oil can be used as a plasticizer-stabilizer for polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and it can also be combined with polystyrene to form unique plastics. Not surprisingly, it commands a high price. The nuts of the shea tree (Vitellaria paradoxa syn. Butyrospermum paradoxum), which grows naturally from eastern Senegal to north-west Uganda, have long been an important domestic and export crop. But, because the trees are wild, the yield and quality of the nuts are highly variable, limiting their industrial value, and yet shea butter is now more widely permitted for use in Europe as a substitute for cocoa butter in chocolate and could, therefore, find a larger market. Furthermore, it has unique medical properties that could make it commercially attractive to the pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries. Research to select trees for faster growth, earlier fruiting and consistent high quality and yields could stimulate commercial exploitation. Another tree that is proving a commercial success is masuku (Uapaca kirkiana). The fruit is eaten fresh or processed into juices, squashes, jams and jellies; in city supermarkets in Malawi and Zambia, commercially produced wine made from masuku is on sale and the fruit is also used to make beer and gin. The tree, which is indigenous to tropical Africa, grows in symbiotic relationship with edible mushrooms for which there is also an export market. Like the shea tree there is considerable potential for domesticating what is still a wild species. 'New' fruits have been successfully introduced into ACP countries with significant tourist industries - Seychelles, Mauritius and Pacific and Caribbean countries, for example. Following market testing with visiting consumers, many of these fruits have now found an export market, following the holidaymakers back home. New processing equals new products New processing techniques could revitalize and add considerable value to traditional subsistence crops. Increasing numbers of city dwellers and women at work require foods that are quick and easy to prepare, and there is a growing market for convenience foods which at present is being largely filled by wheat and maize products. If sorghum and millets could be popped, puffed or flaked, rural and urban populations would derive considerable benefit. Popping is a relatively simple technique and requires less investment than puffing or flaking, but all these processes could be used to swell the small grains of <b>pearl</b> and finger <b>millet,</b> sorghum, fonio etc. and improve their taste while making a ready-to-eat, convenience food product with a high added value. The commercial development of new crops and new products requires investment, but industry is reluctant to invest in an untried market, particularly if new processing technology has to be developed. Even on farm, or at farmers' cooperative level, small-scale machinery must be able to provide a return on investment. This will usually require it to be multi-purpose and to be of use for longer than just one harvesting season. If new crops are introduced it should be because they fit in with the existing farming system, or because they will grow on marginal land; and as far as possible, their introduction should minimize rather than increase risk. This lower-risk potential will often pave the way for eventual commercialization. It was the wicked uncle of Aladdin, in the Tales of the Arabian Nights, who offered 'new lamps for old'.
