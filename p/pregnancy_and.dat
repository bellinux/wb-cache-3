5|$|Cameroon {{has one of}} {{the highest}} school {{attendance}} rates in Africa. Girls attend school less regularly than boys do because of cultural attitudes, domestic duties, early marriage, <b>pregnancy,</b> <b>and</b> sexual harassment. Although attendance rates are higher in the south, a disproportionate number of teachers are stationed there, leaving northern schools chronically understaffed.|$|E
5|$|Fishers are {{generally}} crepuscular, being most active {{at dawn and}} dusk. They are active year-round. Fishers are solitary, associating with other fishers only for mating purposes. Males become more active during mating season. Females are least active during <b>pregnancy</b> <b>and</b> gradually increase activity after birth of their kits.|$|E
5|$|Metformin is safe in <b>pregnancy</b> <b>and</b> {{women with}} gestational {{diabetes}} treated with metformin have less weight gain during pregnancy than those treated with insulin. Babies born to women treated with metformin {{have been found}} to develop less visceral fat, making them less prone to insulin resistance in later life.|$|E

5|$|Several {{risk factors}} have been {{proposed}} and {{are the subject of}} ongoing research. Due to characteristic early onset many studies have focused on parental factors around conception and during gestation. Factors investigated have included occupation (i.e. exposure to chemicals in specific industries), smoking, alcohol consumption, use of medicinal drugs during <b>pregnancy</b> <b>and</b> birth factors; however, results have been inconclusive.|$|E
5|$|The areolar glands {{are in the}} areola that {{surrounds}} the nipple in the female breast. These glands secrete an oily fluid that lubricates the nipple, and also secrete volatile compounds that are thought {{to serve as an}} olfactory stimulus for the newborn. During <b>pregnancy</b> <b>and</b> lactation these glands, also called Montgomery's glands, become enlarged.|$|E
5|$|The use of {{metformin}} {{during all}} parts of pregnancy is controversial. One review found that when taken during pregnancy it reduces the number of complications during <b>pregnancy</b> <b>and</b> {{does not appear to}} cause developmental delays.

5|$|As {{measured}} on women undergoing in vitro fertilization, a longer menstrual cycle length {{is associated with}} higher <b>pregnancy</b> <b>and</b> delivery rates, even after age adjustment. Delivery rates after IVF have been estimated to be almost doubled for women with a menstrual cycle length of more than 34 days compared with women with a menstrual cycle length shorter than 26 days. A longer menstrual cycle length is also significantly associated with better ovarian response to gonadotropin stimulation and embryo quality.|$|E

5|$|Between 1973 and 1977, in New York and New Jersey, Shakur {{was indicted}} ten times, {{resulting}} in seven different criminal trials. Shakur {{was charged with}} two bank robberies, the kidnapping of a Brooklyn heroin dealer, the attempted murder of two Queens police officers stemming from a January 23, 1973 failed ambush, and eight other felonies related to the Turnpike shootout. Of these trials, three resulted in acquittals, one in a hung jury, one in a change of venue, one in a mistrial due to <b>pregnancy,</b> <b>and</b> one in a conviction; three indictments were dismissed without trial.|$|E
5|$|Domestic sheep are {{sometimes}} used in medical research, particularly for researching cardiovascular physiology, {{in areas such}} as hypertension and heart failure. Pregnant sheep are also a useful model for human <b>pregnancy,</b> <b>and</b> have been used to investigate the effects on fetal development of malnutrition and hypoxia. In behavioral sciences, sheep have been used in isolated cases for the study of facial recognition, as their mental process of recognition is qualitatively similar to humans.|$|E

When Reilly sacrifices himself to save Parker (and immediately deteriorates on death as all clones do), Parker realises {{he is actually}} the original. During this same period, Osborn {{may or may not}} have been responsible for the murder or abduction of Peter's newborn daughter, after one of his allies apparently prematurely induces Mary Jane's <b>pregnancy</b> <b>and</b> the stillbirth of the baby.|$|E
5|$|In 1965, two poor Singaporean {{children}}, Chew Kiat Kun (Shawn Lee) and {{his younger}} sister Seow Fang (Megan Zheng) live with their mother (Xiang Yun) who is late in her third <b>pregnancy</b> <b>and</b> their father (Huang Wenyong) who is in debt to a local rice merchant.

5|$|In {{addition}} to death occurring in <b>pregnancy</b> <b>and</b> childbirth, pregnancy {{can result in}} many non-fatal health problems including obstetrical fistulae, ectopic pregnancy, preterm labor, gestational diabetes, hyperemesis gravidarum, hypertensive states including preeclampsia, and anemia. Globally, complications of pregnancy vastly outway maternal deaths, with an estimated 9.5 million cases of pregnancy-related illness and 1.4 million near-misses (survival from severe life-threatening complications). Complications of pregnancy may be physical, mental, economic and social. It is estimated that 10–20 million women will develop physical or mental disability every year, resulting from complications of pregnancy or inadequate care. Consequently, international agencies have developed standards for obstetric care.|$|E

30|$|Aim: The {{incidence}} of ectopic gestation is approximately 20 per 1, 000 <b>pregnancies</b> <b>and</b> the complications {{related to this}} disorder are the leading causes of pregnancy-related deaths during the first trimester.

The aim {{of this study was to}} review our experience of this rare form of pregnancy.|$|R

5|$|More {{is known}} about the role of Athenian {{children}} in religion than about any other aspect of their lives, and they seem to have played a prominent role in religious ceremonies.
