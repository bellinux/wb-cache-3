This method has its origin in the spin-locking technique developed in NMR.

The amplitude of the locked polarization can be as large as half of the first maximum of the nutation signal, i. e., of the polarization bump just after the <b>pulse</b> <b>switch</b> on. Decay of the locked polarization is caused by the T- 2 mu dephasing or by the dephasing of the in-phase component of polarization. [S 1050 - 2947 (99) 08205 - 0]status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|The {{backbone}} of any military operation is the Army. However {{for an international}} war, a Navy {{is essential for the}} security of the sea and for the resupply of land operations. Both services can only be successful if the Air Force has control over the skies in the areas in which they operate. In the WWI the Air Force had a minor role. Telecommunications was developed during this time and in a few cases it played a decisive role. In WWII radar was able to find and locate the enemy and navigation systems existed that allowed aircraft to operate over friendly and enemy territory without visual aids over long range. This development took place at a breath taking speed from the Ultra High Frequency, UHF to the centimeter wave length. The decisive advantage and superiority for the Air Force or the Navy depended on who had the better radar and UHF technology. 0. 0 Aviation Radio and Radar Technology Before World War II From the very beginning radar technology was of great importance for aviation. In spite of this fact, the radar equipment of airplanes before World War II was rather modest compared with the progress achieved during the war. 1. 0 Long-Wave to Short-Wave Radiotelegraphy In the beginning, when communication took place only via telegraphy, long- and short-wave transmitting and receiving radios were used. 2. 0 VHF Radiotelephony Later VHF radios were added, which made communication without trained radio operators possible. 3. 0 On-Board Direction Finding A loop antenna served as a navigational aid for airplanes. This system combined with the on-board receiver made it possible to take a rudimentary bearing on radio stations and later on UHF direction beacons. Later a special receiver was developed that together with an auxiliary antenna enabled lateral location finding. In Germany another direction-finding receiver was developed {{that at the same time}} could <b>pulse</b> <b>switch</b> the phase of the auxiliary antenna and the output voltage so that an unambiguous bearing accuracy similar to the minimum bearing could be achieved without switching to minimum input voltage.

40|$|Newly designed, {{high-power}} silicon gate turn-off thyristors {{are being}} evaluated {{to satisfy the}} U. S. Army’s need for compact, lightweight <b>pulse</b> <b>switches.</b> Following the successful demonstration of a 3. 5 cm 2 silicon Super-GTO, Silicon Power Corporation re-designed the emitter layout and increased the device footprint to create a switch optimized for use in high-current, wide-pulse applications. The 7 cm 2 silicon “Stitch ” Super-GTO was developed to block 7 kV. The 2 x increase in die size actually results in a 2. 5 x increase in active area because a portion of chip area that was previously taken up by perimeter high voltage termination is now used for conduction. The Super-GTOs were evaluated at the Army Research Laboratory in a low-inductance pulse-forming network. Pulse current was successfully stepped up as high as 35 kA, corresponding to a current density of 5 kA/cm 2 over the chip’s footprint. This corresponds to 7 kA/cm 2 over the active emitter area, when the edge termination is excluded. Compared to Silicon Power’s original device, the new larger component conducted 40 % higher current density. The 35 kA current pulse had a width of 125 μs and an I 2 t of 9. 2 x 104 A 2 s. The 10 - 90 % rise of the current pulse was 2. 4 kA/μs, and the maximum on-state forward conduction drop was 28 V.
