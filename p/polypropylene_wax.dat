Although {{the influence of}} the addition of microcrystalline and Fischer-Tropsch waxes on the properties of ethylene-co-vinyl acetate (EVA) hot melts has been studied, the addition of <b>polypropylene</b> <b>wax</b> has not been considered yet. In this study, different polypropylene waxes (<b>polypropylene</b> <b>wax</b> – PP, – maleic anhydride grafted <b>polypropylene</b> <b>wax</b> – PPMA – copolymer of polypropylene and 10. 9 [*]wt. % polyethylene wax – PP-E) were added to EVA hot melts and they were characterized by Brookfield viscosity, softening point measurement, differential scanning calorimetry, thermal gravimetric analysis, dynamic mechanical thermal analysis, plate–plate rheology, tack, and single-lap shear adhesion. The viscosities of EVA hot melts containing polypropylene waxes were relatively high, the highest viscosity corresponded to the formulation containing PP-E wax which also showed pseudoplasticity. The change in viscoelastic properties (i. e., from dominantly viscous to dominantly elastic) was produced at lower temperature in EVA hot melt containing PP-E wax, this adhesive exhibited the highest tack. On the other hand, the addition of acrylic PPMA wax increased the adhesion of EVA hot melt but lower tack was obtained. Finally, the PP-E wax was more compatible with EVA copolymer than the other polypropylene waxes...|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn the {{applications}} of powder injection moulding (PIM), the metallic powders {{are the most}} popular material. In our study, three metallic powders with different compositions, particle shapes and particle sizes have been selected as the test materials to produce micro-structured parts using injection moulding process. The combination of three binders (<b>polypropylene,</b> paraffin <b>waxes</b> and stearic acid) with a constant and adapted formulation has been chosen as a binder system. The mixtures obtained by mixing the metallic powders and the binder system with solid loadings ranging from 56 to 64 vol. % have been used as the feedstocks for the next injection moulding. The viscosity of mixture increased with increasing solid loading. These feedstocks were injected using the same injection moulding conditions in the metallic mould structured with pyramidal shape manufactured using electro-erosion machining. The debinding and sintering process have been carried out at different temperatures to eliminate the binders in the injected replica and obtain the final metallic die mould. To analyse the physical properties evolution of the die mould manufactured by PIM and the influence factors (powder nuance, solid loading and sintering conditions), the shrinkage rate, density, roughness of surface, Vickers hardness and mass losses in metallic mould cavities were investigated. The experimental results demonstrate that properly microstructured parts can be obtained using the process chain of injection, debinding and sintering with metallic powders...|$|R

40|$|Purging {{compounds}} {{allow for}} rapid colour and material changes in plastics converting machines. They have both a cleaning and a purging action. The cleaning action {{refers to the}} removal of contaminants, e. g. carbon deposits, from the die, barrel and extruder-screw surfaces. This mechanism relies on conventional detergency in combination with high wall shear stresses. The purging action refers to the observed narrowing in the residence time distribution and is less well understood. The action of a purge compound may encompass both the cleaning and purging mechanisms {{in order to achieve}} the desired effect. In industry the effectiveness of a purge is determined by a visual observation of the extrudate. Therefore, a scientific method was required to quantitatively determine the efficiency of each purging mechanism under a set of fixed experimental conditions. In this study, a method was developed using a laboratory film-blower, which made use of a phthalocyanine blue pigment to impart colour to the film produced. The method was used to test the efficiency of various commercial purge compounds in switching the colour of film from blue to clear. The analysis was achieved by measuring the residual pigment concentration in the blue polymer film using a UV -Visible spectrophotometer. Commercial purge compounds function by means of various mechanisms such as filler abrasion, solvent dissolution, the dislodging of deposits with the aid of surfactants, etc. This study also considered the use of slip additives as an additional purging mechanism. In proposing that slip additives can contribute to a purging action, several slip additives where tested in polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP) and acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS). The slip additives <b>polypropylene</b> <b>wax</b> and polyamide showed {{a significant increase in the}} MFI of PE whereas the additives polar wax and polyamide exhibited a slight increase in MFI of PP. Three additives, namely, polyamide, <b>polypropylene</b> <b>wax</b> and polar wax had showed noticeable improvement on the MFI of ABS. The slip additives that showed a significant improvement in polyethylene were tested together with six different commercial purge compounds. These compounds were tested for their colour change efficiency using polyethylene and switching from blue to clear in a laboratory film blower. It was found that the slip mechanism contributes very little to the purging action. Polymeric materials tend to adhere to hot metal surfaces. When the material continues to adhere to the metal after cooling down, cleaning of the processing equipment becomes very difficult. A purge manufactured by the CSIR, Pretoria, exhibited this problem. This study also covers an investigation into overcoming the adhesion problem of this purging compound. Dissertation (MSc (Chemistry)) [...] University of Pretoria, 2006. Chemistryunrestricte...|$|E

40|$|A Ceramic Injection Moulding {{process has}} been used for the {{manufacturing}} of Ni-Zn Ferrite parts. The binder was based on a combination of <b>polypropylene</b> and paraffin <b>wax.</b> Different feedstocks were prepared in order to check the effect of stearic acid. Rheology of feedstocks was evaluated using a capillary rheometer over a temperature range of 160 - 170 - 180 C and a shear-rate range of 100 - 3000 s- 1. All the feedstocks presents pseudoplastic behaviour and an important decrease of the viscosity occur when the SA is added. However, different amount of SA has not effect in this property over the shear-rate range tested. Two different debinding cycles was optimized, by means of thermogravimetric analysis.

Final densities and magnetic properties are compared with those obtained by uniaxial compacted parts. ...|$|R
40|$|Metal {{injection}} molding (MIM) {{with the space}} holder technique is {{becoming one of the}} important fabrication methods for a net-shape production of micro-sized, porous, complex-shaped metal parts. For a successful {{injection molding}} step, rheological behavior of MIM feedstock is essential, which includes peculiar characteristics, such as a wall slip phenomenon. SUS 316 L stainless steel powder, binder systems (paraffin <b>wax,</b> <b>polypropylene,</b> polyethylene, stearic acid) and three different sizes of spherically-shaped polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) as a space-holder were used for this study. The porosity was controlled by varying the volume fraction of the space holder and a total of six different feedstocks were prepared. Rheological characteristics of the feedstock was investigated, especially on viscosities, including wall slip quantification by using a capillary rheometer. By thermogravimetric analysis, the debinding process for completely removing the space holder was proposed.

40|$|The {{objective}} of the current work was to establish a viable manufacturing technology for 1 - 3 piezoelectric ceramic/polymer composites, capable of meeting the high volume production requirements. To this end, an extensive development and fabrication programme has been successfully completed, which demonstrates the feasibility of the injection moulding process as a potential fabrication route. The technology will make available to the MOD {{a new generation of}} low-cost transducers tailored to perform in the frequency range suitable for underwater applications. The piezoelectric ceramic used throughout this study was PZT- 5 H. During the course of the investigation two types of feedstock formulation were evaluated. The first employed a binder system developed in-house based on <b>polypropylene,</b> microcrystalline <b>wax</b> and stearic acid. The second formulation employed a commercial binder system designed specifically for ceramic/metal injection moulding. In the case of the 'in-house' binder, two formulations were prepared with approximately 62 % by volume PZT- 5 H but with differing ratios of <b>polypropylene</b> to microcrystalline <b>wax.</b> Three formulations were prepared with the 'commercial' binder system containing approximately 55 %, 58 % and 60 % by volume PZT- 5 H respectively. Compounding by twin screw extrusion produced a feedstock consisting of discrete particles of PZT- 5 H, approximately 0. 5 ?m in diameter, homogeneously distributed within the organic binder. All formulations displayed shear thinning behaviour when evaluated by capillary rheometry and had shear viscosities below 1000 Pa s at a shear rate of 100 s- 1 Further, all formulations displayed tension thinning behaviour-and were characterised as viscoelastic. Attempts to produce an acceptable 1 - 3 preform moulding from feedstock based on the in-house binder system were unsuccessful. It was necessary to reduce the ceramic loading to 30 % by volume before a complete 1 - 3 preform could be moulded. The failure to mould preforms from the in-house formulation was attributed to its high elongational viscosity. It was therefore concluded that an elongational viscosity of 30 kPa s at a tensile strain rate of 58 S- 1 is undesirable for moulding this particular component. Satisfactory conditions were established for the production of 1 - 3 preform mouldings from the commercial feedstock formulation containing 58 % by volume PZT- 5 H. Optimisation of the injection rate and hold pressure was possible by investigating the variation in pillar-density across the 1 - 3 preform mouldings. Satisfactory heating schedules for both the binder removal and sintering stages were established. Microstructural characterisation of sintered pillars revealed grain sizes ranging from 2 to 7 ?. m in diameter. Orientation effects in the sintered microstructure were not apparent in samples moulded at different injection rates. The addition of cover plates to poled composites containing epoxy resin was found to increase the hydrophone figure of merit (HFOM) by an order of magnitude. HFOM values measured during the present work for injection moulded 1 - 3 composites are comparable with similar composites fabricated by the dice-and-fill technique...|$|R
40|$|Aiming at the {{fabrication}} of microtubular anode-supports for Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC) applications, this contribution {{deals with the}} production of Ni-YSZ thin-walled tubes (< 1 mm thickness) via Powder Extrusion Moulding (PEM). The overall method has been optimized {{with an emphasis on}} the effect of NiO particle size using two commercial NiO powders with mean sizes of 0. 7 and 8 μm. A thermoplastic binder system based on <b>polypropylene</b> (PP), paraffin <b>wax</b> (PW) and stearic acid (SA) in volume ratios of 50, 46 and 4, respectively, was used along with corn starch as a pore forming agent. Different feedstocks with solid loadings varying from 45 to 65 vol% were processed and characterized to determine the optimal formulation. Typically, the mixtures exhibited a pseudoplastic behaviour from 100 to 1000 s. Feedstocks with finer NiO particles had the most balanced properties for PEM purposes and an optimal powder volume content of 65 vol% was established. After extrusion and debinding steps, defect-free and constant cross-section tubes with 15 mm of length and 4 mm of nominal diameter were obtained. The final microstructure and DC conductivity were found to be closely linked to the NiO particle size, yielding a higher degree of open porosity and a better performance when using finer NiO powder. Based on this study, the packing mechanism was found to be likely limited by the contribution of steric hindrances when dissimilar and coarse powders are mixed, which may play a decisive role in order to set tailored formulations.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. In this study polypropylene was modified by a range of talc (Mg 3 (OH) 2 Si 4 OlO) fillers. Three different types of surface modifiers were also used, two types of silanes (octyltriethoxysilane and y-aminopropyltriethoxysilane) and maleic anhydride modified <b>polypropylene</b> plus polyethylene <b>wax</b> as an external lubricant. A series of compounds were prepared in an APV twin screw compounder, based on talc addition level, morphology, particle size, surface coatings and coupling agents. The study showed that addition of talc to PP increases the shear viscosity and the blend system generally follows the power law in the shear rate range studied. The experimental values obtained with talc-filled PP were compared with theoretical data obtained from the Maron-Pierce type equation. It was found that theory predicts a higher value of relative viscosity for some talc fillers. A model equation is proposed for talc-filled PP that predicts accurately relative viscosity of the compound for different volume fractions of talc filler. PP-filled with talc having predominantly acicular particles (high surface area), shows a highest shear viscosity values, since high surface area fillers tend to increase the occluded polymer increasing the effective filler volume.

Wall slip for unfilled PP was consistently evident. The slip velocity increases systematically with shear stress, but there is a critical value below which slip velocity was negligible. Addition of talc decreased the slip velocity at a given stress. A mechanism of slip has been proposed whereby a 'slip layer' on the die surface provides a sharp, low energy interface over which, at sufficiently high shear stress, the fluid PP can slip. A new empirical model has been proposed to predict the slip velocity of filled PP, as a function of talc volume fraction. PP filled with 10...|$|R
40|$|A moldagem por injeção de pós cerâmicos tem se tornado um processo altamente atrativo por aliar a versatilidade e a produtividade da moldagem por injeção convencional às propriedades inerentes aos materiais cerâmicos. A remoção do ligante, usado como veículo orgânico nesse processo, é uma das etapas críticas para a produção de peças cerâmicas sem defeitos. Neste trabalho avaliou-se a influência da geometria das peças injetadas na remoção do ligante, tanto por imersão em solvente como por decomposição térmica. Alumina em pó foi misturada fisicamente a um ligante composto por polipropileno [PP], parafina [PW] e ácido esteárico [AE]. As peças com diferentes geometrias foram mantidas imersas em hexano, secas sob vácuo e acompanhada a variação de massa devido à solubilização do PW e AE. A determinação da porosidade das peças, realizada por meio das isotermas de adsorção/desorção de nitrogênio, mostrou um aumento de porosidade de 0, 5 % volume para aproximadamente 20 % volume após a imersão em solvente. A remoção térmica do PP remanescente produziu hidrocarbonetos alifáticos e compostos insaturados, determinados e quantificados por espectroscopia de infravermelho, que permearam a estrutura porosa da peça. A geometria das peças tem grande influência na remoção do ligante, podendo afetar não só a qualidade do produto final, mas também as etapas subseqüentes do processo. Powder {{injection}} molding [PIM] has become highly attractive as it combines the versatility and productivity of conventional {{injection molding}} processes with the intrinsic properties of metallic and ceramic materials. The removal of organic binder, used as vehicles during the process, {{is one of}} the most critical stages in the production of ceramic devices in this process.
