Making full use of his equipment, Hedges was also able to equalize precisely the live sound from his instruments within the concert hall {{in which he was}} performing. He used state-of-the-art equipment such as Sunrise magnetic soundhole pickups, the <b>piezo-crystal</b> F.R.A.P. (Flat Response Audio Pickup) and later, Trance Audio soundboard transducers.|$|E
5000|$|Several guitar manufacturers, such as Godin, offer guitar {{models with}} an {{integrated}} [...] "RMC hexaphonic pickup and preamp system" [...] that {{is compatible with}} Roland guitar-synth hardware. The RMC pickup system uses a <b>piezo-crystal</b> pickup device built into the saddles of the guitar bridge. This piezo-pickup conducts the vibrations of the strings as a piezo-acoustic signal that can be converted into a (13-pin) hexaphonic synth signal. This setup {{can be found in}} the xtSA and the LGX models.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis {{is a novel}} {{technique}} for distributed temperature measurements, using single robust ultrasonic wire or strip-like waveguides, special embodiments {{in the form of}} Helical or Spiral configurations that can cover large area/volume in enclosed regions. Such distributed temperature sensing has low cost applications in the long term monitoring critical enclosures such as containment vessels, flue gas stacks, furnaces, underground storage tanks, buildings for fire, etc. The range of temperatures that can be measured are from very low to elevated temperatures. The transduction is performed using Piezo-electric crystals that are bonded to one end of the waveguide which acts as both transmitter and receivers. The wires will have periodic reflector embodiments (bends, gratings, etc.) that allow reflections of an input ultrasonic wave, in a pulse echo mode, back to the crystal. Using the time of fight (TOF) variations at the multiple predefined reflector locations, the measured temperatures are mapped with multiple thermocouples. Using either the L(0, 1) or the T(0, 1) modes, or simultaneously, measurements other than temperature may also be included. This paper will describe the demonstration of this technology using a 0. 5 MHz longitudinal <b>piezo-crystal</b> for transmitting and receiving the L (0, 1) mode through the special form of waveguide at various temperatures zones...|$|E

The methods for design of nucleus symbols in the systems of the integral equations on the electroelasticity, methods for distinguishment of the fields in the volumetric, surface and channel waves and corresponding power flows have been developed; the amplitude and energetical directions patterns, power balances of the concentrated and distributed surface sources for Y-section of the lithium niobate (half-space, layer) and also diffraction distortion of the surface wave beam have been considered.

40|$|Wire saw {{process is}} widely used to slice many ceramic {{crystals}} that are utilized {{in a wide range}} of engineering applications ranging from silicon wafers in microelectronics and photovoltaic industries to <b>piezo-crystals</b> for actuators and sonar detectors. The process has a higher yield, lower kerf loss and lower surface damage with respect to inner diameter saw. The wire saw process allows higher diameter and thinner wafer cutting. The process is also used in cutting almost all brittle materials including; ultra-hard carbides, high density or foam ceramics, glasses, sapphire and rocks. Wire saw process represents 30 % of the total silicon wafer production cost which directly affects the industry. There is a need to optimize the process by developing models relating process parameters to the out puts.;In this work, we have conducted parametric experimental study on a model wire saw to correlate the process parameters to quality of the machined surface. An automated single wire machine that can allow the variation of the down feed speed, wire speed and wire tension is utilized. Detailed analysis of the cut surface topology is carried out using surface profilomtry and SEM imaging. The detailed parametric study is rationalized in several models that describe the relation between the process parameters and the process induced surface damage. The developed correlation is used to explore the limits of the design space and aid in planning and optimization of the process performance...|$|R
40|$|The {{radiation}} from a Mössbauer source of 57 Co in a copper matrix is frequency-modulated by vibrating the source with a quartz <b>piezo-crystal</b> {{driven by an}} oscillator. If the radiation passes through a resonant absorber (a "filter"), a time structure containing the oscillator frequency and its harmonics appears in the resulting counting rate. It may be seen by sorting the time of each count {{with respect to the}} cross-over time of a subharmonic of the oscillator. These quantum beats are caused by interferences between the frequency components of the photon amplitude, and vanish unless there is some alteration of relative phase or amplitude of the original radiation by the filter. The harmonic constitution of the beats is a sensitive function of the relative shift of source and filter and may be used as a sensitive probe of small shifts. This is demonstrated by measuring the temperature shift in 57 Fe-Be. If a velocity spectrum is made with counts collected during only a part of the vibration cycle, prominent dispersion effects are seen, with counting rates higher than background in some portions of the spectrum. A classical optical theory of the phenomenon is presented in summary. It explains the beats, the dispersion effects, and the sensitivity of the harmonic ratios to relative shifts...|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} electro-optical constructions {{in which}} the Casimir force is modulated in opposition to <b>piezo-crystal</b> elasticity, as in a stack of alternating tunably conductive and piezo layers. Adjacent tunably conducting layers tuned to conduct, attract by the Casimir force compressing the intermediate piezo, but when subsequently detuned to insulate, sandwiched piezo layers expand elastically to restore their original dimension. In each cycle some electrical energy is made available from the quantum zero point (zp). We estimate that the maximum power that could be derived at semiconductor THz modulation rates is megawatts/cm 3. Similarly a permittivity wave generated by a THz acoustic wave in a single crystal by the acousto-optic effect produces multiple coherent Casimir wave mode overtones and a bulk mode. We model the Casimir effect in a sinusoidally graded medium finding it to be very enhanced over what is found in a multilayer stack for the equivalent permittivity contrast, and more slowly decreasing with scale, going as the wavelength 1 /λ 2. Acoustic waves give comparable theoretical power levels of MW/cm 3 below normal crystal damage thresholds. Piezo thermodynamic relations give conditions for effective coupling of the Casimir bulk mode to an external electrical load. Casimir wave modes may exchange energy with the main acoustic wave too, which may partially account for THz attenuation seen in materials. We outline feasibility issues for building a practical crystal power generator. Comment: 36 pages, 14 figure...|$|E
