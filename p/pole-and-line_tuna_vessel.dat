40|$|Tropical tuna {{fisheries}} {{are among}} the largest worldwide, with some having significant bycatch issues. However, <b>pole-and-line</b> <b>tuna</b> fisheries are widely believed to have low bycatch rates, although these have rarely been quantified. The Maldives has an important pole-and-line fishery, targeting skipjack tuna (Katsuwonus pelamis). In the Maldives, 106 <b>pole-and-line</b> <b>tuna</b> fishing days were observed between August 2014 and November 2015. During 161 fishing events, tuna catches amounted to 147 t: 72 % by weight was skipjack, 25 % yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares) and 3 % other tunas. Bycatch (all non-tuna species caught plus all tuna discards) amounted to 951 kg (0. 65 % of total tuna catch). Most of the bycatch (95 %) was utilized, and some bycatch was released alive, so dead discards were particularly low (0. 02 % of total tuna catch, or 22 kg per 100 t). Rainbow runner (Elagatis bipinnulata) and dolphinfish (Coryphaena hippurus) together constituted 93 % of the bycatch. Live releases included small numbers of silky sharks (Carcharhinus falciformis) and seabirds (noddies, Anous tenuirostris and A. stolidus). <b>Pole-and-line</b> <b>tuna</b> fishing was conducted on free schools and schools associated with various objects (Maldivian anchored fish aggregating devices [aFADs], drifting FADs from western Indian Ocean purse seine fisheries, other drifting objects and seamounts). Free school catches typically included {{a high proportion of}} large skipjack and significantly less bycatch. Associated schools produced more variable tuna catches and higher bycatch rates. Fishing trips in the south had significantly lower bycatch rates than those in the north. This study is the first to quantify bycatch rates in the Maldives <b>pole-and-line</b> <b>tuna</b> fishery and the influence of school association on catch composition. Ratio estimator methods suggest roughly 552. 6 t of bycatch and 27. 9 t of discards are caught annually in the fishery (based on 2015 national catch), much less than other Indian Ocean tuna fisheries, e. g. gillnet, purse-seine, and longline...|$|R
40|$|Common {{dolphins}} (Delphinus delphis) {{are responsible}} for the large majority of interactions with the <b>pole-and-line</b> <b>tuna</b> fishery in the Azores but the underlying drivers remain poorly understood. In this study we investigate the influence of various environmental and fisheries-related factors in promoting the interaction of common dolphins with this fishery and estimate the resultant catch losses. We analysed 15 years of fishery and cetacean interaction data (1998 - 2012) collected by observers placed aboard <b>tuna</b> fishing <b>vessels.</b> Dolphins interacted in less than 3 % of the fishing events observed during the study period. The probability of dolphin interaction varied significantly between years with no evident trend over time. Generalized additive modeling results suggest that fishing duration, sea surface temperature and prey abundance in the region were the most important factors explaining common dolphin interaction. Dolphin interaction had no impact on the catches of albacore, skipjack and yellowfin tuna but resulted in significantly lower catches of bigeye tuna, with a predicted median annual loss of 13. 5 % in the number of fish captured. However, impact on bigeye catches varied considerably both by year and fishing area. Our work shows that rates of common dolphin interaction with the <b>pole-and-line</b> <b>tuna</b> fishery in the Azores are low and showed no signs of increase over the study period. Although overall economic impact was low, the interaction may lead to significant losses in some years. These findings emphasize the need for continued monitoring and for further research into the consequences and economic viability of potential mitigation measures...|$|R

40|$|A {{review is}} given of current {{information}} concerning small pelagic fishes exploited for tuna bait in the South Pacific. These fishes are usually caught over or near coral reefs using light attraction and lift nets. The {{most common and}} widespread species are anchovies (Engraulidae), sprats (Clupeidae), silversides (Atherinidae), and herrings (Clupeidae). Recorded yields ranged from 0. 5 to 2. 6 t/km 2, and methods are described to estimate potential yields empirically {{in the absence of}} catch data. Environmental effects on small pelagic fish production are discussed, and evidence is presented to suggest that rainfall markedly affects stolephorid anchovy production. Some species of small pelagic fish, such as Selar spp., Decapterus spp., and Herklotsichthys sp., have been fished traditionally by artisanal fishermen, but anchovy and sprat stocks were probably unexploited prior to <b>pole-and-line</b> <b>tuna</b> fishing in the South Pacific...|$|R

In 1965, the Outer Fishing Harbour {{was constructed}} for bigger industrial vessels such as trawlers, <b>tuna</b> <b>vessels,</b> and deep-sea carriers. The trawlers operating in the area are 30-45 m long and are able to land 55-65 tonnes of fish (usually redfish and club and scad mackerel) per fishing trip.

40|$|The Maldivian <b>pole-and-line</b> <b>tuna</b> fishery {{has been}} in {{existence}} for hundreds of years. The sailing fleet underwent mechanization in the 1970 s. By mid 1980 s the purpose-built second generation vessels that replaced the converted sailing vessels increased the catch by threefold. However, further rapid increase in catch was slow until late 1990 s with third generation fibreglass (FRP) vessels joining the fleet. Catches then doubled from 1996 to 2006. Private sector investments in post-harvest sector are driving the most recent phase of fishery expansion. These include the additional collection and storage facilities, tuna canneries and the rapidly growing fresh tuna export business. Total reported tuna catches at present are 170, 000 mt of which 80 % is skipjack tuna (Katsuwonus pelamis) followed by yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares). Other coastal varieties, frigate tuna (Auxis thazard) and kawakawa (Euthynnus affinis) are caught in small quantities, < 5 % at present.

40|$|Studies {{have shown}} that the whale shark (Rhincodon typus), a {{vulnerable}} large filter feeder, seasonally aggregates at highly productive coastal sites and that individuals can perform large, trans-boundary migrations to reach these locations. Yet, the whereabouts of the whale shark when absent from these sites and the potential oceanographic and biological drivers involved in shaping their present and future habitat use, including that located at the fringes of their suitable oceanic habitat, are largely unknown. We analysed a 16 -year (1998 - 2013) observer dataset from the <b>pole-and-line</b> <b>tuna</b> fishery across the Azores (mid-North Atlantic) and used GAM models to investigate the spatial and temporal patterns of whale shark occurrence in relation to oceanographic features. Across this period, the whale shark became a regular summer visitor to the archipelago after a sharp increase in sighting frequency seen in 2008. We found that SST helps predicting their occurrence in the region associated to the position of the seasonal 22 °C isotherm, showing that the Azores are at a thermal boundary for this species and providing an explanation for the post 2007 increase. Within the region, whale shark detections were also higher in areas of increased bathymetric slope and closer to the seamounts, coinciding with higher chl-a biomass, a behaviour most probably associated to increased feeding opportunities. They also showed a tendency to be clustered around the southernmost island of Santa Maria. This study shows that the region integrates the oceanic habitat of adult whale shark and suggests that an increase in its relative importance for the Atlantic population might be expected in face of climate change...|$|R

40|$|Abstract only. Tuna {{fishery is}} the main one, in quantity, for both Azores and Madeira Atlantic islands and for Azores it is decisive for the {{survival}} of the local tuna canning industry. The main catches are from skipjack and bigeye tuna species, the last one with TAC restrictions. From a strategic perspective it is important to take in account not only the state of the stocks and the level of the catches but also the technical characteristics of the fleet and the socioeconomic dimensions of the value chain. Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) was used to calculate the technical and scale efficiencies of the tuna fleet, both in cross sectional and longitudinal studies. While the type of boats, the technology, the seasonal production pattern and the fishing areas are similar, there are large differences penalizing the Azores fleet that increases when landings are price valued. The results show the reasons why, that are mainly, for the quantity landings, the scale effect and, for the value landings, the market power of the canning industry. A systemic analysis is then used to integrate different dimensions of the value chain, from the fisheries to the canning industry exports. Since the canned tuna global market is highly concentrated the important local industry press the landings price, so the <b>tuna</b> <b>vessels</b> needs to enlarge its seasonal and spatial production frame to survive...|$|R
40|$|The tuna {{industry}} in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean (WCPO) {{is one of the}} largest and most valuable fisheries in the world. Since the 1980 s, Pacific island countries have used licensing agreements with foreign fishing interests [...] known as access agreements [...] to earn tuna-related revenue and control the environmental impacts of fishing, with only minimal success. To date, there has been little work detailing the structure of access agreements and assessing how this structure relates to economic and environmental outcomes in the sector. This article helps to fill this gap by providing an overview of various access structures and a detailed empirical assessment of how these structures are applied in access agreements between Pacific island countries and the major foreign fishing interests active in the WCPO. This analysis is placed in the context of evolving regional fisheries management structures. The study reveals that while there is no uniform formula for access agreements, each structure is subject to distinct political, economic and environmental considerations that influence outcomes for Pacific island countries. As Pacific island countries develop the mechanism to allocate fishing rights under the new Vessel Day Scheme, drawing on their long history with access agreements will assist efforts to use access to achieve policy objectives. Improved transparency will enable Pacific island countries to identify successes and problems and adapt the Vessel Day Scheme allocation mechanisms accordingly.
