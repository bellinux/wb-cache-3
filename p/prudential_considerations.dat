Recent research shows that <b>prudential</b> <b>consideration</b> needs {{to be given to}} take the advantages of GPUs while avoiding the deficiency. In this paper, the impact of GPU acceleration to implicit integrators and explicit integrators in transient stability is investigated. It is illustrated that implicit integrators, although more numerical stable than explicit ones, are not suitable for GPU acceleration. As a tradeoff between numerical stability and efficiency, an explicit 4 th order Runge-Kutta integration algorithm is implemented for transient stability simulation based on hybrid CPU-GPU architecture. The differential equations of dynamic components are evaluated in GPU, while the linear network equations are solved in CPU using sparse direct solver. Simulation on IEEE 22 -bus power system with 6 generators is reported to validate the feasibility of the proposed method. published_or_final_versio...|$|R

At length, little Pyrrhus, who was all the while lying at his feet, began to creep closer toward him; and, finally, taking hold of the king's robe, he began to climb up by it, and attempted to get into his lap, looking up into the king's face, at the same time, with a countenance in which the expression of confidence and hope was mingled with a certain instinctive infantile fear. The heart of the king was so touched by this mute appeal, that he took the child up in his arms, dismissed at once all <b>prudential</b> <b>considerations</b> from his mind, and, in the end, delivered the boy to the queen, Beroa, directing her to bring him up with her own children.|$|E

40|$|Early modern {{political}} thought transformed toleration from a <b>prudential</b> <b>consideration</b> into a moral obligation. Three questions {{need to be}} answered by any explanation of this transition: Did religious toleration really become an obligation {{of the state in}} this period? If this was the case, how could tolerating heresy and idolatry possibly become a moral duty to Christians? How could Europeans both condemn practices as idolatrous and immoral, and yet insist that these practices ought to be tolerated? To answer these questions, the article shows how the early policy of toleration in British India was constituted by a Protestant theological framework. Toleration turned into a moral obligation, it is argued, because the Reformation had identified liberty in the religious realm as God’s will for humanity. This gave rise to a dynamic in which Christian states and churches were continuously challenged for their violations of religious liberty. The principle of toleration developed as a part of this dynamic...|$|R
60|$|The {{common people}} had, {{throughout}} the day, toiled and struggled at football; the nobles and gentry had fought cocks, and hearkened to the wanton {{music of the}} minstrel; while the citizens had gorged themselves upon pancakes fried in lard, and brose, or brewis--the fat broth, that is, in which salted beef had been boiled, poured upon highly toasted oatmeal, a dish which even now is not ungrateful to simple, old fashioned Scottish palates. These were all exercises and festive dishes proper to the holiday. It was no less a solemnity of the evening that the devout Catholic should drink as much good ale and wine as he had means to procure; and, if young and able, that he should dance at the ring, or figure among the morrice dancers, who, {{in the city of}} Perth, as elsewhere, wore a peculiarly fantastic garb, and distinguished themselves by their address and activity. All this gaiety took place under the <b>prudential</b> <b>consideration</b> that the long term of Lent, now approaching, with its fasts and deprivations, rendered it wise for mortals to cram as much idle and sensual indulgence as they could into the brief space which intervened before its commencement.|$|R
60|$|During {{the period}} of King Charles's days of {{adversity}} he made many fruitless attempts to obtain a wife. He was rejected by all the young ladies to whom he made proposals. Marriages in that grade of society are almost always mere transactions of business, being governed altogether by political and <b>prudential</b> <b>considerations.</b> In all Charles's proposals he was aiming simply at strengthening his own position {{by means of the}} wealth or family influence of the bride, supposing as he did that the honor of being even nominally a queen would be a sufficient equivalent to the lady. The ladies themselves, however, to whom he addressed himself, or their friends, thought that the prospect of his being really restored to his throne was very remote and uncertain, and, in the mean time, the empty name of queen was not worth as much as a rich and powerful heiress, by becoming his bride, would have to pay for it.|$|E

Indeed, considerable portions still remain wholly unexplored; and there is doubt as to the actual existence of certain shoals, and reefs, and small clusters of islands vaguely laid down in the charts. The mere circumstance, therefore, of a ship like ours penetrating into these regions, was sufficient to cause any reflecting mind to feel at least a little uneasy. For my own part, the many stories I had heard of ships striking at midnight upon unknown rocks, with all sail set, and a slumbering crew, often recurred to me, especially, as from the absence of discipline, and our being so shorthanded, the watches at night were careless in the extreme.|$|E
6000|$|I {{proceed to}} inquire on what {{principle}} the House of Lords deals with Liberal measures. The right hon.

Are they even a sieve, a strainer, to stop legislation if it should reveal an undue or undesirable degree of Radicalism or Socialism? Are they the complementary critic--the critic who sees all the things which the ordinary man does not see? No one can maintain it. The attitude which the House of Lords adopts towards Liberal measures is purely tactical. When they returned to their [...] "gilded Chamber" [...] after the general election they found on the Woolsack and on the Treasury Bench a Lord Chancellor and a Government with which they were not familiar. When their eyes fell upon those objects, there was a light in them which meant one thing--murder; murder tempered, no doubt, by those <b>prudential</b> <b>considerations</b> which always restrain persons from acts which are contrary to the general feeling of the society in which they live. But their attitude towards the present Government has from the beginning been to select the best and most convenient opportunity of humiliating and discrediting them, and finally of banishing them from power.|$|E

60|$|Colonel Desborough acquitted {{his right}} honourable and {{excellent}} cousin and kinsman of all species of unkindness; Master Bletson discovered, that {{the interest of}} the state was trebly concerned in the good administration of Windsor more than in that of Woodstock. As for Harrison, he exclaimed, without disguise or hesitation, that the gleaning of the grapes of Windsor was better than the vintage of Woodstock. Thus speaking, the glance of his dark eye expressed as much triumph in the proposed earthly advantage, as if it had not been, according to his vain persuasion, to be shortly exchanged for his share in the general reign of the Millennium. His delight, in short, resembled the joy of an eagle, who preys upon a lamb in the evening with not the less relish, because she descries in the distant landscape an hundred thousand men about to join battle with daybreak, and to give her an endless feast on the hearts and lifeblood of the valiant. Yet though all agreed that they would be obedient to the General's pleasure in this matter, Bletson proposed, as a precautionary measure, in which all agreed, that they should take up their abode for some time in the town of Woodstock, to wait for their new commissions respecting Windsor; and this upon the <b>prudential</b> <b>consideration,</b> that it was best not to slip one knot until another was first tied.|$|R

60|$|This prudent personage {{winked at}} much, and avoided giving {{opportunity}} for farther offence, by requesting little of Roland Graeme beyond {{the degree of}} attention which he was himself disposed to pay; rightly conjecturing, that however lowly the place which the youth might hold in the favour of the Knight of Avenel, still to make an evil report of him would make {{an enemy of the}} Lady, without securing the favour of her husband. With these <b>prudential</b> <b>considerations,</b> and doubtless not without an eye to his own ease and convenience, he taught the boy as much, and only as much, as he chose to learn, readily admitting whatever apology it pleased his pupil to allege in excuse for idleness or negligence. As the other persons in the castle, to whom such tasks were delegated, readily imitated the prudential conduct of the major-domo, there was little control used towards Roland Graeme, who, of course, learned no more than what a very active mind, and a total impatience of absolute idleness led him to acquire upon his own account, and by dint of his own exertions. The latter were especially earnest, when the Lady herself condescended to be his tutress, or to examine his progress.|$|E

His face reddened and he twitched his reins angrily; but the next second <b>prudential</b> <b>considerations</b> checked him. He looked uneasily at Anne, as she walked steadily on, glancing neither to the right nor to the left. Had she heard Corcoran's unmistakable offer and his own too plain acceptance of it? Confound Corcoran! If he couldn't put his meaning into less dangerous phrases he'd get into trouble some of these long-come-shorts. And confound redheaded school-ma'ams with a habit of popping out of beechwoods where they had no business to be. If Anne had heard, Judson Parker, measuring her corn in his own half bushel, as the country saying went, and cheating himself thereby, as such people generally do, believed that she would tell it far and wide. Now, Judson Parker, as has been seen, was not overly regardful of public opinion; but {{to be known as}} having accepted a bribe would be a nasty thing; and if it ever reached Isaac Spencer's ears farewell forever to all hope of winning Louisa Jane with her comfortable prospects as the heiress of a well-to-do farmer. Judson Parker knew that Mr. Spencer looked somewhat askance at him as it was; he could not afford to take any risks.|$|E

Though naturally cold and calculating, William Ferrars, like most of us, had a vein of romance in his being, and it asserted itself. There was a Miss Carey, who suddenly became the beauty of the season. She was an orphan, and reputed to be no inconsiderable heiress, and was introduced to the world by an aunt who was a duchess, and who meant that her niece should be the same. Everybody talked about them, and they went everywhere--among other places to the House of Commons, where Miss Carey, spying the senators from the old ventilator in the ceiling of St. Stephen's Chapel, dropped in her excitement her opera-glass, which fell at the feet of Mr. Under-Secretary Ferrars. He hastened to restore it to its beautiful owner, whom he found accompanied by several of his friends, and he was not only thanked, but invited to remain with them; and the next day he called, and he called very often afterwards, and many other things happened, and at the end of July the beauty of the season was married not to a Duke, but to a rising man, who Zenobia, who at first disapproved of the match--for Zenobia never liked her male friends to marry--was sure would one day be Prime Minister of England.|$|E
40|$|This {{article has}} two {{significant}} goals. First, it addresses the circuit {{split on the}} proper test for standing in false advertising claims under section 43 (a) of the Lanham Act. With slight modification, courts should adopt the reasonable interest test as articulated in two recent opinions authored by Justice Alito while {{he was sitting on}} the Third Circuit of Appeals, Second, this article proposes similar <b>prudential</b> standing <b>considerations,</b> along with proposed legislative amendments, for state deceptive trade laws. This section of the article focuses primarily on Arkansas law, but the proposals set forth can be applied to other jurisdictions. The linking theme throughout this article is that unfair competition laws achieve optimal levels of accurate information in the market. False advertising and state deceptive trade practices laws are two such laws that should be applied to secure these optimal levels in the market. This article demonstrates why prudential standing measures will ensure proper enforcement of the Lanham Act and state deceptive trade practices laws to promote optimal levels of accurate information in the market. To accomplish this task, it is necessary to explore the origin and the development of both laws. Part I presents an overview of false advertising under section 43 (a) of the Lanham Act. Part II discusses the legislative history and case law interpretation of section 43 (a). Part III analyzes the reasonable interest test to evaluate prudential standing for false advertising. Part IV presents the relationship of false advertising law and state deceptive trade practices laws. Part V discusses Arkansas laws affecting false advertising and makes suggestions to incorporate prudential standing measures for deceptive trade practices claims into Arkansas law. By adopting these measures, courts can apply the Lanham Act and deceptive trade practice laws to secure optimal levels of accurate information in the marketplace and avoid the anticompetitive effects caused by over enforcement...|$|R

40|$|This chapter {{tries to}} shift the {{contrast}} of debates between 'scholasticii' and 'politici' away from conceptualizing {{it in terms of}} theology vs. rationalism, since in a way both share a modern, rationalist outlook: It is argued that the practice of politics is recognized by both Machiavelli and his scholastic counterpart Girolamo Savonarola as deeply characterised by <b>prudential</b> and "realist" <b>considerations.</b> The main difference seems to be the conceptualizing of one's own historical situation, of the eventual success of one's own practice and of societal development in terms either of a teleological framework or of radical contingency. Put this way, the same arguments that allow Machiavelli {{to move away from the}} former framework then cast doubts also on the possibilities of a rational political theory, in the sense of transparent and certain knowledge and understanding. The chapter draws on Claude Lefort's interpretation of Machiavelli in order to highlight a radically immanentist perspective in the 'Principe'. The Machiavellian approach involves a distinct methodological perspective on politics, on power, and on history that is contrasted with a rationalist paradigm that is prominent in political theory, but has been sharply criticized already by Machiavelli himself...|$|R
60|$|Mr. Vincy's answer {{consisted}} chiefly in {{a demand}} that Lydgate should insure his life--a demand immediately conceded. This was a delightfully reassuring idea supposing that Lydgate died, {{but in the}} mean time not a self-supporting idea. However, it seemed to make everything comfortable about Rosamond's marriage; and the necessary purchases went on with much spirit. Not without <b>prudential</b> <b>considerations,</b> however. A bride (who is going to visit at a baronet's) must have a few first-rate pocket-handkerchiefs; but beyond the absolutely necessary half-dozen, Rosamond contented herself without the very highest style of embroidery and Valenciennes. Lydgate also, finding that his sum of eight hundred pounds had been considerably reduced since {{he had come to}} Middlemarch, restrained his inclination for some plate of an old pattern which was shown to him when he went into Kibble's establishment at Brassing to buy forks and spoons. He was too proud to act as if he presupposed that Mr. Vincy would advance money to provide furniture; and though, since it would not be necessary to pay for everything at once, some bills would be left standing over, he did not waste time in conjecturing how much his father-in-law would give in the form of dowry, to make payment easy. He was {{not going to do anything}} extravagant, but the requisite things must be bought, and it would be bad economy to buy them of a poor quality. All these matters were by the bye. Lydgate foresaw that science and his profession were the objects he should alone pursue enthusiastically; but he could not imagine himself pursuing them in such a home as Wrench had--the doors all open, the oil-cloth worn, the children in soiled pinafores, and lunch lingering in the form of bones, black-handled knives, and willow-pattern. But Wrench had a wretched lymphatic wife who made a mummy of herself indoors in a large shawl; and he must have altogether begun with an ill-chosen domestic apparatus.|$|E
60|$|It {{is indeed}} deplorable, that our Generals, from this infirmity, or {{from any other}} cause, did not assume that lofty deportment which the {{character}} and relative strength of the two armies authorized them, {{and the nature of}} the service upon which they were sent, enjoined them to assume;--that they were in such haste to treat--that, with such an enemy (let me say at once,) and in such circumstances, they should have treated at all. Is it possible that they could ever have asked themselves who that enemy was, how he came into that country, and what he had done there? From the manifesto of the Portugueze government, issued at Rio Janeiro, and from other official papers, they might have learned, what was notorious to all Europe, that this body of men commissioned by Bonaparte, in the time of profound peace, without a declaration of war, had invaded Portugal under the command of Junot, who had perfidiously entered the country, as the General of a friendly and allied Power, assuring the people, as he advanced, that he came to protect their Sovereign against an invasion of the English; and that, when in this manner he had entered a peaceable kingdom, which offered no resistance, and had expelled its lawful Sovereign, he wrung from it unheard-of contributions, ravaged it, cursed it with domestic pillage and open sacrilege; and that, when this unoffending people, unable to endure any longer, rose up against the tyrant, he had given their towns and villages to the flames, and put the whole country, thus resisting, under military execution.--Setting aside all natural sympathy with the Portugueze and Spanish nations, and all <b>prudential</b> <b>considerations</b> of regard or respect for their feelings towards these men, and for their expectations concerning the manner in which they ought to be dealt with, it is plain that the French had forfeited by their crimes all right to those privileges, or to those modes of intercourse, which one army may demand from another according to the laws of war. They were not soldiers in any thing but the power of soldiers, and the outward frame of an army. During their occupation of Portugal, the laws and customs of war had never been referred to by them, but as a plea for some enormity, to the aggravated oppression of that unhappy country! Pillage, sacrilege, and murder--sweeping murder and individual assassination, had been proved against them by voices from every quarter. They had outlawed themselves by their offences from membership in the community of war, and from every species of community acknowledged by reason. But even, should any one be so insensible as to question this, he will not at all events deny, that the French ought to have been dealt with as having put on a double character. For surely they never considered themselves merely as an army. They had dissolved the established authorities of Portugal, and had usurped the civil power of the government; and it was in this compound capacity, under this twofold monstrous shape, that they had exercised, over the religion and property of the country, the most grievous oppressions. What then remained to protect them but their power?--Right they had none,--and power! it is a mortifying consideration, but I will ask if Bonaparte, (nor do I mean in the question to imply any thing to his honour,) had been in the place of Sir Hew Dalrymple, what would he have thought of their power?--Yet before this shadow the solid substance of justice melted away.|$|E

40|$|This article {{examines}} {{the debate over the}} constitutionalization of shari’a in post-authoritarian Arab regimes. A shari’a clause would empower judges to review the validity of legislation on the basis of Islamic law. Thus, it raises {{for the first time the}} potential counter-majoritarian effect of judicial intervention. This {{article examines}} the conceptualist-style approach to the question of Islam and democratic constitutionalism. Such an approach, which has hitherto dominated the debate, seeks to show the compatibility of Islam and democracy, or the lack thereof, on the basis of conceptual analysis of abstract concepts like Islam and democracy. The article maps and evaluates the different discursive moves that moderate Islamists, Salafis, and secularists deploy in this debate. Comparing the debates to the U. S. constitutional debates between originalists and living constitutionalists, I show the unacknowledged methodological similarities between the opposing camps. I argue that the contestability of the basic concepts on which the debate is based shows the futility of the conceptualist debate. Furthermore, ignoring contestability, fleeing to abstraction, and falling prey to formalism produce bad normative effects that are detrimental to the debate. Ultimately, I seek to advance a different kind of conversation: a pragmatic, consequentialist-style analysis that takes into <b>consideration</b> <b>prudential</b> and normative arguments for or against the inclusion of shari’a law in the emerging Arab constitutional orders...|$|R

This paper presents a macroprudential tabletop exercise that was aimed at confronting Federal Reserve Bank Presidents with a plausible, albeit hypothetical, macro-financial scenario that would lend itself to macroprudential considerations. In the tabletop exercise, the primary macroprudential objective was to reduce the likelihood and severity of possible future financial disruptions associated with the unwinding of the hypothetical overheating scenario. The scenario provided a path for key macroeconomic and financial variables that were assumed to be observed through 2016 :Q 4, as well as the corresponding hypothetical projections for the interval from 2017 :Q 1 to 2018 :Q 4. <b>Prudential</b> tools under <b>consideration</b> included capital-based tools such as the leverage ratios, countercyclical capital buffer, and sectoral capital requirements; liquidity-based tools such as the liquidity coverage and net stable funding ratios; credit-based tools such as caps on loan-to-value ratios and margins; capital and liquidity stress testing; and supervisory guidance and moral suasion. In addition, participants were asked to consider using monetary policy tools for financial stability purposes. This paper presents the hypothetical macro-financial scenario, the set of macroprudential tools, and their transmission mechanism, as well as an account of the participants' assessment of vulnerabilities and potential policy actions under the scenario.

Because Yoo’s arguments on the treaty power raise questions of methodological consistency, he is susceptible to the criticism that his arguments are motivated more by <b>prudential</b> and policy <b>considerations</b> than by fidelity to constitutional text, structure and history. The Essay concludes that, while the constitutional text, structure and history are clear and consistent and support Irons’ arguments fovoring congressional war powers, the Constitution provides little guidance on how the treaty power should operate. Yoo’s view that treaties do not bind the President finds no support in constitutional text or structure. This Essay offers a structural interpretation of the constitutional treaty power different from Yoo’s that would promote U. S. participation in multilateral treaty regimes that foster security and the rule of law...|$|R
40|$|Stare decisis {{has been}} called many things, among them a {{principle}} of policy, a series of <b>prudential</b> and pragmatic <b>considerations,</b> and simply the preferred course. Often overlooked {{is the fact that}} stare decisis is also a judicial doctrine, an analytical system used to guide the rules of decision for resolving concrete disputes that come before the courts. This Article examines stare decisis as applied by the U. S. Supreme Court, our nation’s highest doctrinal authority. A review of the Court’s jurisprudence yields two principal lessons about the modern doctrine of stare decisis. First, the doctrine is comprised largely of malleable factors that carry neither independent meaning nor predictive force. Second, most of the factors that populate the doctrine are best understood as evincing, either explicitly or implicitly, a driving concern with the reliance interests that could be upset by the decision to overrule a given precedent. When stare decisis is reconceptualized in terms of these reliance implications, there emerges a blueprint for doctrinal reform. In short, this Article suggests that the Court should begin by clearing away the distracting, indirect proxies for reliance that dominate the current jurisprudence. In their stead, the Court should construct a new framework that focuses directly, rigorously, and systematically on the fundamental reliance considerations themselves. Such an undertaking, it must be acknowledged, will present significant challenges. But embracing those challenges is necessary if we hope to move toward a doctrine of stare decisis that delivers on its longstanding promise to promote stability, coherence, and the rule of law...|$|R
40|$|The author {{analyzes}} the scholarly {{debate over the}} legitimacy of the institution of judicial review. He suggests that, as a reaction to unjustified criticism of the institution, defenders of judicial review have articulated propositions which advance constitutional jurisprudence beyond the issue of legitimacy. He argues {{that the time has come}} for courts to de-emphasize <b>prudential</b> <b>considerations</b> and to concentrate on the substantive correctness of their decisions and on the standards of review which the courts employ...|$|E
