25|$|The {{memorial}} also {{opened its}} grounds to archeological digs in 1994. Estimates of human occupation on Shooter's Hill go {{back as far}} as 3,000 BC. Shooter's Hill had been occupied by Native Americans, a mansion (in the 1830s and 1840s), a log cabin, Fort Ellsworth, a reservoir for the city's fresh water system, a park for outdoor dancing, and the Alexandria Golf Course among many others. Alexandria city archeologists used ground-penetrating radar to help identify sites of interest on Shooter's Hill, including a brick foundation wall. In the dig's first three seasons, a stone ax, pieces of ceramic pots, Civil War ammunition, various kinds of colored glass, a <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>jewelry</b> shaped like a scarab, a Colonial-era mug imported from England, Native American spear points, a silver-plated spoon, a stoneware jar, and the bisque heads of dolls manufactured in Germany were found. In 2002, the memorial opened an exhibit designed to showcase some of the archeological evidence unearthed on the memorial grounds.|$|E

500|$|Gates {{maintained}} a {{suite at the}} Waldorf-Astoria of New City from 1894 onwards. Though he paid US$30,000 yearly for it, his visits pained the hotel's manager, George Boldt, at times. [...] Gates and his guests were often loud and boisterous. [...] He had a private entrance and elevator, but Gates {{had a habit of}} banging on the elevator doors and shouting for service. Boldt instructed his elevator operators to take their time when serving his floor, as it allowed Gates to make as much noise as he wished for a few minutes. Gates' suite was often home to high-stakes poker parties and Baccarat games. Many poker games began on the train from Chicago to New York and were continued at the Waldorf. One poker game lasted for five days and nights; when it was done at least US$2 million had changed hands. Dellora Gates had long since resigned herself to her husband's all-night poker games, but many times became upset about them. [...] Gates made it a practice to keep some unset diamonds in his vest pocket for the times when Dellora became angry about the late hours at cards. He would then present a gem to his wife, who would suddenly forget her anger with him. [...] Dellora would take the diamond to Tiffany & Co. to be set in a <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>jewelry</b> of her choice.|$|E
500|$|Several Yogo sapphires {{are kept}} at the Smithsonian Institution. The {{earliest}} donations were {{noted in the}} museum's annual report on June 30, 1899, when the institution reported that Dr. L. T. Chamberlain gave them two cut Yogos and 21 other sapphires for their Dr. Isaac Lea gem and mineral collection. The record-setting [...] cut Yogo is also held by the Smithsonian. In 2006, gemologist Robert Kane of Fine Gems International in Helena, which has the world's largest selection of Montana sapphires, donated 333 Montana sapphires, weighing a total of , to the Smithsonian's Gem and Mineral Collection, along with 98.48grams of 18K yellow gold {{for the creation of}} a <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>jewelry.</b> A representative of the Smithsonian asked Paula Crevoshay, a jewelry designer from Albuquerque, New Mexico, to create a piece of finished jewelry from these gems. Crevoshay felt that a butterfly motif would best represent America's natural beauty, honor her mother's love of butterflies, and display the wide range of colors found in Montana sapphires. Crevoshay named the brooch [...] "Conchita" [...] in honor of her mother; it is also referred to as the [...] "Sapphire Butterfly Brooch", [...] "Conchita Sapphire Butterfly", and the [...] "Montana Butterfly Brooch". Two of the sapphires used are cabochon cut and the rest are brilliant cut. The majority are from the Rock Creek deposit. The largest one, however, is a blue Yogo used for the butterfly's head. Other sapphires used included yellow, purple, pink, and orange gems. Crevoshay completed the brooch in 2007; she and Kane presented the finished brooch to Smithsonian curator Jeffrey Post on May 7, 2007, in Washington, DC.|$|E

500|$|In the {{earliest}} years of Yogo sapphire mining, before Yogos achieved their own reputation, Oriental sapphires {{were sold in}} Montana with claims they were Yogos, while in Europe, Yogos were sold as Oriental sapphires. However, Yogos became notable in their own right. Paulding Farnham (1859–1927) used Yogos in several jewelry pieces he designed for the 1900 Exposition Universelle in Paris, where Yogo sapphires received a silver medal among all gems for color and clarity. An entry of uncut loose Yogo sapphires also won a bronze medal at the 1904 Louisiana Purchase Exposition in St. Louis, Missouri. Farnham was {{the creator of the}} most elaborate <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>jewelry</b> ever made with Yogos, the life-size Tiffany Iris Brooch, a brooch ornament, which contains 120 Yogo sapphires set in platinum, and sold on March 17, 1900, for $6,906.84. In 1923, First Lady Florence Harding was given an [...] "all Montana" [...] ring made from a Yogo sapphire and Montana gold. In 1952, Gadsden gave cut Yogos to President Harry Truman, his wife Bess, and their daughter Margaret. Many Yogos were also sold in Europe, as some Yogo mining was conducted by British interests. Yogos may have been in the personal collections of some members of the British royal family in the 1910s, but promotional claims that Yogos are in any of the crown jewels of England cannot be conclusively proven or disproven. Claims that the gem in the engagement ring of Lady Diana Spencer and Kate Middleton is a Yogo are dubious; the gem is thought to be of Sri Lankan origin. Its size also indicates it is unlikely to be a Yogo; the sapphire is large, most often reported as being [...] in size, though it has also been described as [...] and even , however, the latter number is the karat purity of the gold setting. The story that the gem is a Yogo can be traced to a 1984 Los Angeles Times article that described the ring as a [...] sapphire, and quoted Intergem president Dennis Brown's claim that the gem may have come from a British-owned Yogo mine.|$|E

Over time, she begins to remember what caused her current predicament. 500 years before the incident that caused Bayonetta's memory loss, there were two factions preserving the balance between darkness and light in the world: the Umbra Witches, who are followers of darkness, and their counterparts, the Lumen Sages, who are followers of light. [...] The factions shared two distinct treasures, the 'Eyes of the World' (separately named the 'Left Eye' and the 'Right Eye') which they used to oversee the just passage of time.
