The Asian financial crisis swept the region when it was least expected and left seemingly irreparable effect on the economies. As financial intermediaries of the economy, the banking industry was significantly affected by the crisis. Non <b>performing</b> <b>Loans</b> (NPLs) began to rise as deteriorating finances of distressed borrowers and soaring interest rates impaired borrowers' ability to service loan. In addition, the collapse of financial and property asset values substantially reduced the value of the collateral for many bank loans. As a result, most financial institutions experienced erosion in profits. The financial institutions" capital base was affected by increased losses from loan defaults, requiring them to seek re-capitalization. Evaluation of bank performance is important for all parties including depositors, bank managers and regulators.
