50|$|The {{general case}} {{is known as}} a period lattice. If the vectors p and q {{generate}} the lattice, instead of p and q we can also take <b>p</b> and <b>p-q,</b> etc. In general in 2D, we can take a p + b q and c p + d q for integers a,b, c and d such that ad-bc is 1 or -1. This ensures that p and q themselves are integer linear combinations of the other two vectors. Each pair p, q defines a parallelogram, all with the same area, the magnitude of the cross product. One parallelogram fully defines the whole object. Without further symmetry, this parallelogram is a fundamental parallelogram.|$|R

Premedication included sedatives for all patients and the group 2 received their usual cardiovascular treatment one hour before operation. A standardized protocol of monitoring and anesthesia was followed in the operating room. 12 lead electrocardiograms (ECG) were obtained before and after induction of anesthesia, every 10 minutes during pneumoperitoneum, after the peritoneal desufflation and after extubation.

The analysis was perfomed postoperatively. Results. During pneumoperitoneum a deviation of cardiac electrical axis to the left was observed. There were no marked changes in duration of <b>P</b> wave, <b>P-Q</b> interval, and QRS complex. Following abdominal insufflation a tendency to flattening of T wave was observed returning to the initial position after desufflation. No significant dislocation of ST segment was recorded. Conclusions. The pneumoperitoneum induced changes of cardiac electrical axis can affect the interpretation of ECG seen on a cardiac monitor during anesthesia. Pneumoperitoneum does not pose patients with moderate ischemic heart disease at additional risk of developing myocardial ischemia...|$|R
40|$|In {{recent years}} {{genome-wide}} scans and association studies for schizophrenia susceptibility genes have been published. Some have yielded significant positive findings, {{but there is}} disagreement between studies concerning their location. No mutation in any gene has yet been found. Since schizophrenia is a complex disorder, a study with sufficient power to detect a locus with small or moderate gene effect is necessary. We have thus conducted a genome-wide scan of 382 sibling pairs each with a diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. Three hundred ninety-six highly polymorphic markers spaced approximately 10 cM apart were genotyped in all individuals. Multipoint non-parametric linkage analysis was performed using MAPMAKER/SIBS to evaluate regions of the genome demonstrating increased allele sharing among affected sibling pairs as measured by a lod score. Two regions were found with multipoint maximum lod scores significant or suggestive of linkage. The highest results occurred on chromosome 10 p 15 -p 13 (peak lod score of 3. 60 at D 10 S 189) and the centromeric region of chromosome 2 (peak lod score = 2. 99 at marker D 2 S 139).

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Some {{genome-wide}} scans and association {{studies for}} schizophrenia susceptibility genes have yielded significant positive findings, {{but there is}} disagreement between studies on their locations, and no mutation has yet been found in any gene. Since schizophrenia is a complex disorder, a study with sufficient power to detect a locus with a small or moderate gene effect is necessary. METHOD: In a genome-wide scan of 382 sibling pairs with a diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, 396 highly polymorphic markers spaced approximately 10 centimorgans apart throughout the genome were genotyped in all individuals. Multipoint nonparametric linkage analysis was performed to evaluate regions of the genome demonstrating increased allele sharing, as measured by a lod score. RESULTS: Two regions with multipoint maximum lod scores suggesting linkage were found. The highest lod scores occurred on chromosome 10 p 15 -p 13 (peak lod score of 3. 60 at marker D 10 S 189) and the centromeric region of chromosome 2 (peak lod score of 2. 99 at marker D 2 S 139). In addition, a maximum lod score of 2. 00 was observed with marker D 22 S 283 on chromosome 22 q 12, which showed evidence of an imprinting effect, whereby an excess sharing of maternal, but not paternal, alleles was present. No evidence of linkage was obtained at several locations identified in previous studies, including chromosomes 1 q, 4 <b>p,</b> 5 <b>p-q,</b> 6 <b>p,</b> 8 p, 13 q, 15 p, and 18 p.

40|$|Rab/Ypt GTPases are key {{regulators}} of membrane {{trafficking and}} together with SNARE proteins mediate selective fusion of vesicles with target compartments. A family of GTPase-activating enzymes (GAPs) specific for Rab/Ypt GTPases has been discovered, but {{little is known}} about their function and substrate specificity in vivo. Here we show that the GAP activity of Gyp 1 p, a yeast member of this family, is specifically required for recycling of the SNARE Snc 1 p and the membrane dye FM 4 - 64, implying that inactivation of a Rab/Ypt GTPase may be necessary for recycling of membrane material. Interestingly, recycling of GFP-Snc 1 p in gyp 1 Δ cells is partially restored by reducing the activity of Ypt 1 p. Moreover, GFP-Snc 1 p accumulated intracellularly in wild-type cells expressing a GTP-locked, mutant form of Ypt 1 <b>p</b> (Ypt 1 <b>p-Q</b> 67 L), suggesting that GTP hydrolysis of Ypt 1 p is essential for recycling. Ypt 6 p is known to be required for the fusion of recycling vesicles to the late Golgi compartment. Interestingly, the deletions of GYP 1 and YPT 6 were synthetic lethal, raising the possibility that at least two distinct pathways are involved in recycling of membrane material...|$|R

Electrocardiographic recordings {{were carried out}} using an electrocardiograph with a deflection of 10 mm/mV and a paper speed of 25 mm/sec. Recordings were conducted under the following experimental conditions: at rest, after warm up, after a jumping trial, and 15 and 30 minutes {{after the end of}} the trial. Significant reductions were observed in the duration of the P wave, of the P-Q interval, and of the R-R intervals immediately after the test. Significant elevations were observed immediately after the test in the range of the T and P waves of the heart rate. The observed changes can be attributed mainly to increase of the sympathetic tone connected with increase of heart rate necessary to satisfy the elevation of the cardiac range. These results are useful to plan and monitor specific training programmes.
