5|$|Carl von Sickingen {{researched}} <b>platinum</b> {{extensively in}} 1772. He {{succeeded in making}} malleable <b>platinum</b> by alloying it with gold, dissolving the alloy in hot aqua regia, precipitating the <b>platinum</b> with ammonium chloride, igniting the ammonium chloroplatinate, and hammering the resulting finely divided <b>platinum</b> to make it cohere. Franz Karl Achard made the first <b>platinum</b> crucible in 1784. He worked with the <b>platinum</b> by fusing it with arsenic, then later volatilizing the arsenic.|$|E
5|$|If pure <b>platinum</b> {{is found}} in placer {{deposits}} or other ores, it is isolated from them by various methods of subtracting impurities. Because <b>platinum</b> is significantly denser than many of its impurities, the lighter impurities can be removed by simply floating them away in a liquid. <b>Platinum</b> is paramagnetic, whereas nickel and iron are both ferromagnetic. These two impurities are thus removed by running an electromagnet over the mixture. Because <b>platinum</b> has a higher melting point than most other substances, many impurities can be burned or melted away without melting the <b>platinum.</b> Finally, <b>platinum</b> is resistant to hydrochloric and sulfuric acids, whereas other substances are readily attacked by them. Metal impurities can be removed by stirring the mixture in {{either of the two}} acids and recovering the remaining <b>platinum.</b>|$|E
5|$|In the laboratory, <b>platinum</b> wire is {{used for}} electrodes; <b>platinum</b> pans and {{supports}} are used in thermogravimetric analysis because of the stringent requirements of chemical inertness upon heating to high temperatures (~1000°C). <b>Platinum</b> is used as an alloying agent for various metal products, including fine wires, noncorrosive laboratory containers, medical instruments, dental prostheses, electrical contacts, and thermocouples. Platinum-cobalt, an alloy of roughly three parts <b>platinum</b> and one part cobalt, is used to make relatively strong permanent magnets. Platinum-based anodes are used in ships, pipelines, and steel piers.|$|E
5|$|In the platinotype {{printing}} process, photographers make fine-art black-and-white prints using <b>platinum</b> or palladium salts. Often {{used with}} <b>platinum,</b> palladium provides {{an alternative to}} silver.|$|E
5|$|Internationally, {{the album}} reached {{number one in}} Australia, where it was {{certified}} double <b>platinum</b> by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA), and South Africa. In Canada, it entered the top five and was certified <b>platinum.</b> The album peaked at number four in the United Kingdom, receiving a <b>platinum</b> certification. It also entered the top ten of Japan and New Zealand, where it was certified double <b>platinum</b> and gold. It reached the top twenty-five of Sweden, {{as well as the}} top thirty in the Netherlands and Germany. It also received gold certifications in Switzerland and Hong Kong. As of 2014, it has been estimated to sell 12 million copies worldwide. The Rhythm Nation 1814 video compilation and its reissue were each certified double <b>platinum</b> in United States.|$|E
5|$|Janet {{was first}} {{certified}} gold by the RIAA on August 8, 1993 denoting 500,000 units shipped within the United States. The same day, the album's certification {{was raised to}} 3× <b>platinum,</b> denoting 3,000,000 units shipped. On November 17, 1993, Janet received 4× <b>platinum</b> certification and was later awarded 5× <b>platinum</b> on December 17, 1993. The following year on April 12, 1994, the album was certified 6× <b>platinum.</b> It was the second best selling album of 1993 in United States with 4.3 million copies sold. Within seven months of release the album had sold over ten million copies worldwide. Other certifications include a Double Gold certification in Finland, a 2× <b>Platinum</b> certification in the UK And Australia, a <b>Platinum</b> in New Zealand and a Gold certification in Norway.|$|E
5|$|One {{suitable}} {{method for}} purification for the raw <b>platinum,</b> which contains <b>platinum,</b> gold, {{and the other}} platinum-group metals, is to process it with aqua regia, in which palladium, gold and <b>platinum</b> are dissolved, whereas osmium, iridium, ruthenium and rhodium stay unreacted. The gold is precipitated {{by the addition of}} iron(II) chloride and after filtering off the gold, the <b>platinum</b> is precipitated as ammonium chloroplatinate by the addition of ammonium chloride. Ammonium chloroplatinate can be converted to <b>platinum</b> by heating. Unprecipitated hexachloroplatinate(IV) may be reduced with elemental zinc, and a similar method is suitable for small scale recovery of <b>platinum</b> from laboratory residues. Mining and refining <b>platinum</b> has environmental impacts.|$|E
5|$|<b>Platinum</b> is an {{extremely}} rare metal, occurring at a concentration of only 0.005 ppm in Earth's crust. It is sometimes mistaken for silver. <b>Platinum</b> is often found chemically uncombined as native <b>platinum</b> and as alloy with the other platinum-group metals and iron mostly. Most often the native <b>platinum</b> is found in secondary deposits in alluvial deposits. The alluvial deposits used by pre-Columbian people in the Chocó Department, Colombia are still a source for platinum-group metals. Another large alluvial deposit is in the Ural Mountains, Russia, {{and it is still}} mined.|$|E
5|$|<b>Platinum</b> {{is used in}} {{catalytic}} converters, laboratory equipment, {{electrical contacts}} and electrodes, <b>platinum</b> resistance thermometers, dentistry equipment, and jewelry. Being a heavy metal, it leads to health problems upon exposure to its salts; but due to its corrosion resistance, metallic <b>platinum</b> has not been linked to adverse health effects. Compounds containing <b>platinum,</b> such as cisplatin, oxaliplatin and carboplatin, are applied in chemotherapy against certain types of cancer.|$|E
5|$|The Division Bell was {{released}} in the UK by EMI Records on 28 March 1994, and in the US on 4 April, and went straight to #1 in both countries. The Division Bell was certified silver and gold in the UK on 1 April 1994, <b>platinum</b> a month later and 2x <b>platinum</b> on 1 October. In the US, it was certified gold and double <b>platinum</b> on 6 June 1994, and triple <b>platinum</b> on 29 January 1999.|$|E
5|$|The {{album was}} also {{successful}} in Spanish-speaking countries. It was certified triple <b>platinum</b> in Paraguay and Uruguay {{as well as}} in Central America; double <b>platinum</b> in Bolivia, Colombia, Peru, Spain and Venezuela, and <b>platinum</b> in Ecuador. In Brazil, Segundo Romance was certified gold for sales of 50,000 copies. The album reached number one on the Chilean album charts, and was certified sextuple <b>platinum</b> for shipping 150,000 copies. In Argentina, it was certified 11 <b>platinum</b> and later received a diamond award for sales of 500,000 copies. By 1995, Segundo Romance had sold over four million copies worldwide.|$|E
5|$|The {{discovery}} of iridium is intertwined {{with that of}} <b>platinum</b> and the other metals of the <b>platinum</b> group. Native <b>platinum</b> used by ancient Ethiopians and by South American cultures always contained {{a small amount of}} the other <b>platinum</b> group metals, including iridium. <b>Platinum</b> reached Europe as platina ("silverette"), found in the 17th century by the Spanish conquerors in a region today known as the department of Chocó in Colombia. The discovery that this metal was not an alloy of known elements, but instead a distinct new element, did not occur until 1748.|$|E
5|$|Though {{naturally}} occurring <b>platinum</b> alloys containing all six platinum-group metals {{were used for}} a long time by pre-Columbian Americans and known as a material to European chemists from the mid-16th century, not until the mid-18th century was <b>platinum</b> identified as a pure element. That natural <b>platinum</b> contained palladium, rhodium, osmium and iridium was discovered {{in the first decade of}} the 19th century. <b>Platinum</b> in alluvial sands of Russian rivers gave access to raw material for use in plates and medals and for the minting of ruble coins, starting in 1828. Residues from <b>platinum</b> production for coinage were available in the Russian Empire, and therefore most of the research on them was done in Eastern Europe.|$|E
5|$|Zooropa is {{certified}} 2× <b>Platinum</b> in the US by the Recording Industry Association of America, 3× <b>Platinum</b> in Australia, <b>Platinum</b> in the UK, and 4× <b>Platinum</b> in both New Zealand and Canada. To date, it {{has sold}} more than 7million copies.|$|E
5|$|A New Day Has Come {{became a}} {{commercial}} success {{throughout the world}} and entered number one in more than seventeen countries. It has sold 3.3 million units in the United States and was certified three-times <b>Platinum</b> by the RIAA. In Canada, after shipping 600,000 copies, the album was certified six-times <b>Platinum.</b> The IFPI certified it three-times <b>Platinum</b> for selling three million units in Europe. Overall, A New Day Has Come has sold twelve million copies worldwide.|$|E
5|$|Adentro became Arjona's fifth {{consecutive}} {{album to}} reach the top ten on the US Billboard Top Latin Albums chart, peaking at number three. On the Latin Pop Albums chart, it attained a peak of number two. Adentro was certified two times <b>Platinum</b> in Mexico, five times <b>Platinum</b> in Argentina and two times <b>Platinum</b> (Latin) in the United States. As of February 2006, the album has sold more than one million copies worldwide.|$|E
5|$|Archaeologists have {{discovered}} traces of <b>platinum</b> {{in the gold}} used in ancient Egyptian tombs and hieroglyphs as early as 1200 BC. However, the extent of early Egyptians' knowledge of the metal is unclear. It is quite possible they did not recognize there was <b>platinum</b> in their gold.|$|E
5|$|By February 1998, OK Computer {{had sold}} {{at least half}} a million copies in the UK and 2 million worldwide. At least 1.4 million copies have since been sold in the US, 3 million across Europe and 4.5 million worldwide. It has been {{certified}} triple <b>platinum</b> in the UK and double <b>platinum</b> in the US, in addition to certifications in other markets.|$|E
5|$|Corrosion {{and heat}} {{resistance}} makes iridium an important alloying agent. Certain long-life aircraft engine parts {{are made of}} an iridium alloy, and an iridium–titanium alloy is used for deep-water pipes because of its corrosion resistance. Iridium is also used as a hardening agent in <b>platinum</b> alloys. The Vickers hardness of pure <b>platinum</b> is 56HV, whereas <b>platinum</b> with 50% of iridium can reach over 500HV.|$|E
5|$|Darmstadtium is {{the eighth}} {{member of the}} 6d series of {{transition}} metals. Since copernicium (element 112) {{has been shown to}} be a transition metal, it is expected that all the elements from 104 to 112 would continue a fourth transition metal series, with darmstadtium as part of the <b>platinum</b> group metals and a noble metal. Calculations on its ionization potentials and atomic and ionic radii are similar to that of its lighter homologue <b>platinum,</b> thus implying that darmstadtium's basic properties will resemble those of the other group 10 elements, nickel, palladium, and <b>platinum.</b>|$|E
5|$|Disasterpieces {{peaked at}} number 3 in the Billboard Top Music Videos chart {{and rose to}} number 1 in Finland. On January 6, 2003 the RIAA {{certified}} Disasterpieces <b>platinum</b> in the United States, and it was declared quadruple <b>platinum</b> on November 18, 2005.|$|E
5|$|Hexachloroplatinic acid {{mentioned}} above {{is probably the}} most important <b>platinum</b> compound, as it serves as the precursor for many other <b>platinum</b> compounds. By itself, it has various applications in photography, zinc etchings, indelible ink, plating, mirrors, porcelain coloring, and as a catalyst.|$|E
5|$|His {{historical}} {{account of}} the expedition included a description of <b>platinum</b> as being neither separable nor calcinable. Ulloa also anticipated the discovery of <b>platinum</b> mines. After publishing the report in 1748, Ulloa did not continue to investigate the new metal. In 1758, {{he was sent to}} superintend mercury mining operations in Huancavelica.|$|E
