Prior to the May 1918 Battle of Sardarabad, which took <b>place</b> <b>just</b> miles away from the cathedral, the {{civilian}} and military leadership of Armenia suggested Catholicos Gevorg (George) V to leave for Byurakan for security purposes, but he refused. The Armenian forces eventually repelled the Turkish offensive and set the foundation of the First Republic of Armenia.|$|E

5|$|Jimmy Nicholl of Raith Rovers was {{appointed}} as McCarthy's replacement, {{but could not}} reverse the slump in form which saw Millwall relegated {{at the end of}} the 1995–96 season in 22nd <b>place.</b> <b>Just</b> five months earlier they had been top of Division One, but now Millwall found themselves in the third tier for the 1996–97 season. The club experienced severe financial difficulties that resulted in them being placed in financial administration for a short time. Nicholl was relieved of his duties and John Docherty returned on a short-term basis to stabilise the club.|$|E

External productions are also occasionally held in NYU's facilities. The largest performance accommodations at NYU are the Skirball Center for Performing Arts (850 seats) at 566 LaGuardia <b>Place,</b> <b>just</b> south of Washington Square South, and the Eisner-Lubin Auditorium (560 seats) in the Kimmel Center.

The episode's production took <b>place</b> <b>just</b> a week before David Duchovny's wedding, with his fiancée Téa Leoni visiting the set during filming. The first cut of the episode was twelve minutes too long, resulting {{in some of the}} scenes in the mountains being removed.

5|$|To elevate {{his son to}} Mary's rank, Emperor Charles V ceded to Philip {{the crown}} of Naples {{as well as his}} claim to the Kingdom of Jerusalem. Therefore, Mary became Queen of Naples and titular Queen of Jerusalem upon marriage.

Philip could not speak English, and so they spoke in a mixture of Spanish, French, and Latin.|$|E
5|$|Arab historians {{argue that}} Israel {{had entered the}} Battle of Karameh with too much confidence, since it took <b>place</b> <b>just</b> after Israel had {{defeated}} the Arabs in the 1967 Six-Day War. The size of the Israeli forces entering Karameh made the Jordanians assume that Israel was also planning to occupy the eastern bank of the Jordan River, including the Balqa Governorate, {{in order to create}} a Golan Heights similar situation so as to be used a bargaining chip. Jordanians claim that Moshe Dayan invited Israeli journalists on the previous day for lunch in western Jordan after occupying it.|$|E

5|$|Continuing west, the Meadowbrook State Parkway enters exitM2, a {{cloverleaf}} interchange with Zeckendorf Boulevard (unsigned CR260) {{adjacent to}} nearby Roosevelt Field Mall. Both directions of Zeckendorf Boulevard are accessible southbound, with exitM2E using part of Dibblee Drive; the northbound {{direction of the}} parkway has only one exit, exitM2W for Zeckendorf Boulevard westbound. Past the cloverleaf, the parkway winds back to the northwest as it approaches exitM1, a partial cloverleaf interchange with Old Country Road (unsigned CR25) {{on the border between}} the towns of Hempstead and North Hempstead. The Meadowbrook Parkway continues northwest across Old Country Road into North Hempstead, passing under the Long Island Rail Road's Main Line as it traverses the village of Carle <b>Place.</b> <b>Just</b> north of the community, the Meadowbrook reaches exit31A of the Northern State Parkway, a semi-directional T interchange that serves as {{the north end of the}} Meadowbrook State Parkway.|$|E
5|$|Hamilton {{took his}} fifth win {{of the season}} when he crossed {{the line at the}} end of the 56th lap, almost 15seconds ahead of the second-placed Massa. Räikkönen took third ahead of Alonso. Heidfeld managed to jump from ninth on the grid to finish in fifth <b>place,</b> <b>just</b> ahead of his {{teammate}} Kubica, who climbed from eleventh on the grid. A one-stop pit strategy worked well for Glock as he finished seventh; Piquet took eighth. Vettel, Coulthard, Barrichello and Nakajima took the next four places; Bourdais recovered from his early contact with Trulli to take 13th. Webber's initial success with a two-stop strategy faded as he finished 14th. Rosberg took 15th, ahead of Button and Fisichella. Trulli, Sutil and Kovalainen were the three retirements from the 56lap race.|$|E
5|$|Michigans keel {{was laid}} down on 17 December 1906, {{one day before}} South Carolina. After the initial {{construction}} periods, the ships were launched on 26 May and 11 July 1908 (respectively). Michigan was {{slightly more than half}} complete when launched, and the ship was christened by Carol Newberry, the daughter of Assistant Secretary of the Navy Truman Handy Newberry. The warship was billed as epoch-making, and the spectacle drew many prominent individuals, including the governor and lieutenant-governor of Michigan, the governor of New Jersey, the mayor of Detroit, and the secretary of the Interior Department, along with many naval admirals and constructors. Like its sister ship, South Carolina was just over halfway completed when it was launched. The accompanying ceremony took <b>place</b> <b>just</b> after noon and was attended by many notable residents of the state of South Carolina, including Governor Martin Frederick Ansel. His daughter Frederica christened the ship.|$|E

5|$|Qualifying {{got under}} way on Saturday {{afternoon}} with new rules in <b>place.</b> <b>Just</b> as in years before, the qualifying procedure was divided into three parts, with the first part (Q1) running for 16 minutes and {{the second and third}} parts (Q2 and Q3) being 15 and 14 minutes long respectively. All twenty-two cars contested the first part, with seven drivers eliminated from further contention in each of the first two parts of qualifying, leaving eight drivers to compete for pole position in Q3. However, in a change of rules, drivers were now eliminated during the session, with the slowest runner at a given point being taken out from contention every ninety seconds, beginning seven minutes into Q1, six minutes into Q2 and five minutes into Q3.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Romani has, however, been {{surrounded}} with controversy and criticism. It {{has been suggested}} that, like {{the attack on the}} Suez Canal in 1915, it was merely a raid to disrupt maritime traffic rather than a determined attempt to gain control of the canal. That the Ottoman Empire's intention was to strongly occupy Romani and Kantara is supported by preparations in the southern territory of Palestine adjacent to, and extending into, the Sinai. These included extending the Palestine railway system to Wadi El Arish, with a good motor road beside the railway. Cisterns and other works were constructed along this route to store water and at Wadi El Arish, enormous rock cut reservoirs were under construction in December 1916 when the Anzac Mounted Division reached that <b>place</b> <b>just</b> before the Battle of Magdhaba.|$|E
5|$|The Wars of the Roses {{broke out}} between the Lancastrians and Richard's Yorkist faction in the 1450s. Ludlow Castle did not find itself in the front-line {{of most of the}} conflict, instead acting as a safe retreat away from the main fighting. An {{exception}} to this was the Battle of Ludford Bridge which took <b>place</b> <b>just</b> outside the town of Ludlow in 1459, resulting in a largely bloodless victory for the Lancastrian Henry VI. After the battle, in a bid to break Richard's power over the region, Edmund de la Mare was placed in charge of the castle as constable, with John Talbot, the Earl of Shrewsbury, being given the wider lordship. Richard was killed in battle in 1460, and his son Edward seized the throne the following year, retaking control of Ludlow Castle and merging it with the property of the Crown.|$|E

5|$|The {{team had}} an {{excellent}} later {{half of the season}} in single-day races, attaining top-ten placings in all but one such race that they entered. This successful run started at the Clásica de San Sebastián. Both Schleck brothers were mentioned as possible pre-race contenders, and Fränk Schleck rode to sixth place on the day by finishing with the first chase pack back of solo winner Philippe Gilbert and second-placed Carlos Barredo. In August, Nizzolo continued his strong neo-pro season with a fifth place ride at the GP Ouest-France, finishing second-best from the peloton behind three attacking riders who took each podium <b>place</b> <b>just</b> ahead of them.|$|E
5|$|Under the 2006 pyramid reorganisations, a third-place {{finish in}} the Wessex League {{was good enough for}} {{promotion}} back to the Southern League, along with local rivals Winchester City and Thatcham Town. In their first season back, they finished in ninth <b>place,</b> <b>just</b> five points from the divisional playoffs. They were unable to build on this and struggled to a nineteenth-place {{finish in the}} following season, ultimately finishing 29points above relegation after Slough Town were reprieved following Halifax Town's expulsion from the Football Conference. Andover's home match against Uxbridge, played towards the end of that season, was the club's thousandth game in the Southern League.|$|E
5|$|By {{end of the}} 16th century Cassel {{had become}} a border town between France and the Spanish Netherlands. The French {{repeatedly}} fought with Spain and later the independent Dutch Republic {{for control of the}} town; in March 1645, Gaston, Duke of Orléans seized it but lost it again to the Spanish a few months later. In 1658 Turenne expelled two Irish regiments in the pay of the Spanish who were garrisoning Cassel. The French captured the town in July 1676 under Louis de Crevant, Duke of Humières and strengthened the castle. The following year, a third Battle of Cassel took <b>place</b> <b>just</b> west of the town on 11 April 1677 when a French army under François-Henri de Montmorency, duc de Luxembourg and Philippe I of Orléans defeated Dutch forces commanded by William III of Orange. The battle took place after King Louis XIV of France besieged the Dutch-held town of Saint-Omer during the Franco–Dutch War. William sent an army to relieve Saint-Omer but was defeated at the village of Zuytpeene just to the west of Cassel, losing 7-8,000 men killed or wounded and another 4,000 taken prisoner. Saint-Omer fell a week later.|$|E
