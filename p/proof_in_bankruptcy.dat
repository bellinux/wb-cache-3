40|$|This {{article is}} {{the first in a series}} of {{articles}} discussing the problem of conflicts of interest <b>in</b> <b>bankruptcy</b> cases.

State law ethics rules presume that the parties are always in static positions; <b>in</b> <b>bankruptcy</b> law, alliances shift all the time.

The WARN Act {{does not apply to}} a trustee <b>in</b> <b>bankruptcy</b> whose sole function is to close the business.|$|R

40|$|The paper {{investigates the}} effect of {{bankruptcy}} risk on firmsâ€™ financing decisions. More specifically, we analyze if a higher probability of bankruptcy reduces incentives for debt financing due to an increase <b>in</b> expected <b>bankruptcy</b> cost. We argue that an increase <b>in</b> <b>bankruptcy</b> risk affects financial decisions only when the probability of bankruptcy is sufficiently high. We therefore model a nonlinear relationship between changes <b>in</b> leverage and <b>bankruptcy</b> risk. Our findings show that an increase <b>in</b> <b>bankruptcy</b> risk has {{a negative impact on}} changes in leverage and the impact is clearly nonlinear...|$|R
