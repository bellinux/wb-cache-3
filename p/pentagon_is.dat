5|$|A monohedral tiling is a {{tessellation}} {{in which}} all tiles are congruent; it has only one prototile. A particularly interesting type of monohedral tessellation is the spiral monohedral tiling. The first spiral monohedral tiling was discovered by Heinz Voderberg in 1936; the Voderberg tiling has a unit tile that is a nonconvex enneagon. The Hirschhorn tiling, published by Michael D. Hirschhorn and D. C. Hunt in 1985, is a pentagon tiling using irregular pentagons: regular pentagons cannot tile the Euclidean plane as the internal angle of a regular <b>pentagon,</b> , <b>is</b> not a divisor of 2.|$|E

CBS News national security correspondent David Martin says the U.S. military build-up, which would include adding a second aircraft carrier to the one already in the Gulf, is being proposed as a response to what U.S. officials view as an increasingly provocative Iranian leadership.|$|E
25|$|The city centre, {{sometimes}} {{known as}} the <b>pentagon,</b> <b>is</b> surrounded by an inner ring road, the Small Ring (French: Petite Ceinture, Dutch: Kleine Ring), a sequence of boulevards formally numbered R20 or N0. These were built upon {{the site of the}} second set of city walls following their demolition. The metro line 2 runs under much of these. Since June 2015, a number of central boulevards inside the pentagon have become car-free, limiting transit traffic through the old city.|$|E

500|$|The diagram above {{shows the}} rhodium–carbon ( [...] inside pentagons on the left) and carbon–carbon ( [...] outside pentagons on the left) bond {{distances}} for both ligands, {{along with the}} bond angles ( [...] inside pentagons on the right) within each cyclopentadienyl ring. The atom labels used {{are the same as}} those shown in the crystal structure above. Within the unsubstituted cyclopentadienyl ligand, the carbon–carbon bond lengths vary between 1.35Å and 1.40Å and the internal bond angles vary between 107° and 109°. For comparison, the internal angle at each vertex of a regular <b>pentagon</b> <b>is</b> 108°. The rhodium–carbon bond lengths vary between 2.16Å and 2.18Å. These results are consistent with η5-coordination of the ligand to the metal centre. In the case of the substituted cyclopentadienyl ligand, there is somewhat greater variation: carbon–carbon bond lengths vary between 1.39Å and 1.48Å, the internal bond angles vary between 106° and 111°, and the rhodium–carbon bond lengths vary between 2.14Å and 2.20Å. The greater variation in the substituted ligand is attributed to the distortions necessary to relieve the steric strain imposed by neighbouring tert-butyl substituents; despite these variations, the data demonstrate that the substituted cyclopentadienyl is also η5-coordinated.|$|E
