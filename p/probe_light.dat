By fitting spectroscopic photo-reflectance data with the conventional third derivative functional form, a comprehensive set of interband transition energies, amplitudes, and widths may be obtained, providing an essentially complete {{characterization of the}} electronic properties of the sample of interest. However, owing {{to the need to}} keep the <b>probe</b> <b>light</b> intensity to a minimum and to the practical necessity of phase-locked detection, spectroscopic photo-reflectance measurements must be made sequentially, i.e. probe one wavelength at a time. This constraint limits the speed of spectroscopic photo-reflectance measurements, and coupled with the need for a careful fit procedure, renders spectroscopic photo-reflectance more suitable for analytical applications. Conversely, laser photo-reflectance employs a monochromatic light source, and hence is well suited for industrial applications. Moreover, in commonly encountered situations, the coherent wavefront of laser probe beam may be used to isolate the refractive component of the photo-reflectance signal, greatly simplifying the data analysis.|$|E

5000|$|Photo-reflectance is {{an optical}} {{technique}} for investigating {{the material and}} electronic properties of thin films. Photo-reflectance measures the change in reflectivity of a sample {{in response to the}} application of an amplitude modulated light beam. In general, a photo-reflectometer consists of an intensity modulated [...] "pump" [...] light beam used to modulate the reflectivity of the sample, a second [...] "probe" [...] light beam used to measure the reflectance of the sample, an optical system for directing the pump and probe beams to the sample, and for directing the reflected <b>probe</b> <b>light</b> onto a photodetector, and a signal processor to record the differential reflectance. The pump light is typically modulated at a known frequency so that a lock-in amplifier may be used to suppress unwanted noise, resulting in the ability to detect reflectance changes at the ppm level.|$|E
50|$|This {{method is}} typical of 'pulse-probe' experiments, where a pulsed laser is used to excite a molecule's {{electrons}} from their ground states to higher-energy excited states. A probing light source, typically a xenon arc lamp, is used to obtain an absorption spectrum of the compound at various times following its excitation. As the excited molecules absorb the <b>probe</b> <b>light,</b> they are further excited to even higher states. After passing through the sample, the unabsorbed light from the arc lamp continues to an avalanche photodiode array, and the data is processed to generate an absorption spectrum of the excited state. Since all the molecules in the sample will not undergo the same dynamics simultaneously, this experiment {{must be carried out}} many times, and the data must be averaged in order to generate spectrums with accurate intensities and peaks.

50|$|Ultrafast {{transient}} absorption can use {{almost any}} <b>probe</b> <b>light,</b> {{so long as}} the probe is of a pertinent wavelength or set of wavelengths. A monochromator and photomultiplier tube in place of the avalanche photodiode array, allows observation of a single probe wavelength, and thus allows probing of the decay kinetics of the excited species. The purpose of this setup is to take kinetic measurements of species that are otherwise nonradiative, and specifically it is useful for observing species that have short-lived and non-phosphorescent populations within the triplet manifold as part of their decay path. It {{should be noted that the}} pulsed laser in this setup is used both as a primary excitation source, and a clock signal for the ultrafast measurements. Although laborious and time-consuming, the monochromator position may also be shifted to allow absorbance decay profiles to be constructed, ultimately to the same effect as the above method.|$|E

5000|$|Photo-reflectance is a {{particularly}} convenient type of modulation spectroscopy, {{as it may be}} performed at room temperature and only requires the sample have a reflecting surface. [...] It is an established tool for non-contact determination of material and electronic properties of semiconductor films. In photo-reflectance, a pump laser beam is used to modulate the free charge density in a semiconductor sample (via photo-injection), thereby modulating one or more physical quantities (e.g. the internal electric field). The measured signal ΔR is the change in amplitude of the reflected <b>probe</b> <b>light</b> as the intensity modulated pump radiation interacts with the sample. The normalized signal is ΔR/R, i.e. the pump-induced change in reflectance (AC) divided by the baseline reflectance (DC).

50|$|The {{output of}} the laser is split into pump and probe beams by a {{half-wave}} plate followed by a polarizing beam splitter leading to a cross-polarized pump and probe. The pump beam is modulated {{on the order of}} a few megahertz by an acousto-optic or electro-optic modulator and focused onto the sample with a lens. The probe is directed into an optical delay line. The probe beam is then focused with a lens onto the same spot on the sample as the probe. Both pump and probe have a spot size on the order of 10-50 μm. The reflected <b>probe</b> <b>light</b> is input to a high bandwidth photodetector. The output is fed into a lock-in amplifier whose reference signal has the same frequency used to modulate the pump. The voltage output from the lock-in will be proportional to ΔR.

We have found a critical stopping condition for the MC-light fields where the group velocity of light should reduce down to zero. Semiclassical dynamics and behavior of specific quantum correlations of the MC-light fields have been studied in detail for particular initial quantum states of the probe pulse. The stationary MC-field dynamics are treated in terms of dark MC-polariton states constructed for the studied multi-wave mixing processes.
