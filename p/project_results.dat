Patrol efforts (measured by total {{time spent on}} patrols and distance of foot patrols) in the two protected areas where the project started first (Kedrovaya Pad - Leopardovii and Lazovsky protected areas) have increased substantially. This was established by comparing the patrol data of the 1st quarter of 2011 with the 1st quarter of 2012. Patrol law enforcement results (confiscated fire arms, citations for poaching and other violations as well as fines) have also increased markedly (this was established {{by comparing the results}} of the two protected areas in 2011 to previous years).|$|E

The findings indicate that heavy metals such as mercury, arsenic, and lead, {{have been identified in}} the coastal zone of the Caribbean Sea. Analysis of toxic metals and hydrocarbons is based on the investigation of coastal sediments that have accumulated less than 50 meters deep during the last hundred and fifty years.

40|$|This {{report is}} {{a summary of}} the {{renewable}} energy projects installed throughout Texas after the year 2000. The collection of these projects was done in response to the Energy System Laboratory?s requirement to fulfill its obligations for Senate Bill 5 (SB 5). The renewable energy projects researched and presented herein include: solar photovoltaic, solar thermal, hydroelectric, geothermal, and landfill gas-fired power plants. However, information on wind energy farms has been omitted in this report {{due to the fact that}} a more complete ESL report on this subject has already been prepared, ESL-TR- 06 - 08 - 01. In addition to locating these projects, SB 5 required the calculation of reduced NOx emissions. To accomplish this, the Energy Systems Laboratory (ESL) at Texas A&M University developed ?eCalc? in 2004 [...] a web-based Emissions Reduction Calculator. This program is able to calculate weather-normalized NOx emissions estimates for energy efficiency and renewable sources projects, such as solar photovoltaic, solar thermal, and wind. Annual energy savings from renewable <b>projects</b> <b>resulted</b> in the following: ? Solar photovoltaic <b>projects</b> <b>resulted</b> in energy savings of 424. 18 MWh/yr and a reduction of 0. 28 tons of NOx/year. ? Solar thermal <b>projects</b> <b>resulted</b> in energy savings of 332. 88 MWh/yr and a reduction of 0. 26 tons of NOx/year. The peak ozone season day (OSD) NOx reductions were calculated to be: ? Solar photovoltaic <b>projects</b> <b>resulted</b> in savings of 1. 29 MWh/day. ? Solar thermal <b>projects</b> <b>resulted</b> in savings equivalent to 0. 94 MWh/day. The emissions reduction values for hydroelectric and geothermal projects are not presented here since there is no methodology in place at this time to obtain these values...|$|R
