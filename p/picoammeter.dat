Other instruments—essentially similar, but with higher sensitivity—are used for accurate measurements of very small or very large quantities. These include nanovoltmeters, electrometers (for very low currents, and voltages with very high source resistance, such as one teraohm) and <b>picoammeters.</b> Accessories for more typical multimeters permit some of these measurements, as well.

Today, the design has been modified into a tubular electrode, {{commonly referred to as}} a collector plate. The ions thus are attracted to the collector plate and upon hitting the plate, induce a current. This current is measured with a high-impedance <b>picoammeter</b> and fed into an integrator.

40|$|Early {{attempts}} were made four and five decades ago to measure electron-stimulated electron emissions of insulators. These studies were subject to errors associated with poor vacuum system contamination, inadequate material surface control, and crude detection setups. Electron yields of insulators are difficult to measure since incident electron sources will impart surface and bulk charges that cannot easily be dissipated, that in turn affect electron emissions. By using short-duration, low-current electron pulses, these charging effects can be minimized. Additionally, the insulator can be neutralized periodically to return the surface to its original uncharged state. At Utah State University, we have improved upon previous insulator measurements using ultra-high vacuum technology, a fully-enclosed hemispherical detection system, pulsed electron sources, compact low energy electron neutralization sources, and fast-response low-noise <b>picoammeters.</b> Data will be presented on insulator surface potential evolution {{as a function of}} electron fluence, as well as neutralized-insulator electron yields...|$|R

The Ultrastable Low-noise Current Amplifier (ULCA) is a novel high-precision amperemeter for direct current measurements in the pA range, developed at PTB. Its amplifier stages, based on resistor networks and op-amps, can be calibrated traceably with a cryogenic current comparator (CCC) system. We compare the results from both independent calibration routes for two different ULCA prototypes. We find agreement between both methods at an uncertainty level below 10 microA/A, limited by the uncertainty of the currents generated with the capacitor charging method.

40|$|The {{main issue}} {{concerning}} metal oxide (MOX) gas sensors is mostly {{related to the}} wide range of resistive values that the sensors can show. In addition, some sensors could have baseline resistive values up to tens of gigohms. To avoid the use of expensive <b>picoammeters</b> or the use of circuits adopting scaling factors, different solutions have recently been proposed, exploiting the resistance-to-time conversion (RTC) technique. They show good linearity and are suitable for the integration in a chip together with the elaboration unit, but they may require long measurement time (tens of seconds) if high resistance values need to be estimated. In addition, they may suffer the influence of a sensor parasitic capacitance, in parallel with the resistive component. In this paper, a new method is proposed to reduce the measuring time, keeping the advantages offered by the RTC approach and including a parasitic capacitance estimation feature. Particularly, an effective architecture, based on moving thresholds, has been proposed, simulated, and experimentally tested with commercial resistors (values between 1 MOhm and 100 GOhm) and capacitors (values between 1 and 47 pF). Finally, a fast sensor transient, due to a rapid change in the heating power, has been acquired with the proposed instrument and compared with a similar transient analyzed with a classical RTC approach. This test has shown the applicability of the interface for solutions requiring detailed information of the sensor response, such as the characterization of new sensors (e. g., nanowires) or the behavior analysis during nonstandard thermal profiles...|$|R
