Throat, nasal, and fecal swabs were screened for resistant microorganisms on agar containing selected antimicrobial agents. Nasopharyngeal carriage of Staphylococcus aureus was significantly more frequent in <b>pig</b> <b>farmers,</b> as was macrolide resistance of S. aureus from carriers. Nongroupable streptococci from the throat were more resistant to the penicillins in <b>pig</b> <b>farmers.</b> The intestinal isolation of enterococci resistant to erythromycin or vancomycin was not significantly higher in <b>pig</b> <b>farmers</b> in contrast to that of enterobacteria resistant to nalidixic acid, chloramphenicol, tetracycline, and streptomycin.

On 6 th April Dutch <b>pig</b> <b>farmers</b> were given the possibility to submit blood samples directly via their veterinary practitioner to the National Reference Laboratory for CSF if their pigs had nonspecific clinical symptoms or if pigs were being treated with antibiotics. The pig farm was not quarantined and was not visited by the veterinary authorities. Over a period of 9 weeks 156 <b>pig</b> <b>farmers</b> submitted whole blood samples via 50 different veterinary practices. All samples tested negative in the PCR test.

The main results indicated that <b>pig</b> <b>farmers</b> (72 %) would use this type of exclusion diagnostics sooner than that they would approach the veterinary authorities (practitioners: 86 %). Moreover the respondents considered the fact that the farm was not quarantined immediately to be an advantage (<b>pig</b> <b>farmers,</b> 79 %; practitioners, 88 %). 32 percent of the <b>pig</b> <b>farmers</b> were not aware that they were required to submit blood samples if pigs were being treated with antibiotics (practitioners: 11 %). The majority of <b>pig</b> <b>farmers</b> and practitioners were not satisfied with the current distribution of the costs involved: in their opinion the costs of the PCR test, the costs of the veterinary practitioner and the costs for shipping the samples to the reference laboratory should be paid out of the Animal Health Fund (50 % government and 50 % industry) or by the government. If the current distribution of the costs is not changed, a large proportion of the <b>pig</b> <b>farmers</b> indicated that they would not use this form of exclusion diagnostics for CSF in the future. <b>Pig</b> <b>farmers</b> appeared to have a rather limited knowledge of the clinical signs of CSF: 33 % of the <b>pig</b> <b>farmers</b> could mention maximally three clinical signs of CSF and 7 % could not mention a single clinical sign of CSF and said they were entirely dependent on the practitioners' ability to judge a CSF-suspect situation...|$|R

30|$|Large <b>pig</b> <b>farmers</b> {{exhibited}} strong {{disagreement over}} the producer price as a membership benefit.

40|$|Carriage of animal-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) clonal complex 398 (CC 398) {{is common}} among <b>pig</b> <b>farmers.</b> This study was {{conducted}} (i) to investigate whether <b>pig</b> <b>farmers</b> are colonized with pig-specific S. aureus genotypes other than CC 398 and (ii) to survey antimicrobial resistance of S. aureus isolates from <b>pigs</b> and <b>pig</b> <b>farmers.</b> Forty-eight S. aureus isolates from <b>pig</b> <b>farmers</b> and veterinarians and 130 isolates from pigs collected in Western Switzerland were genotyped by spa typing and amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP). Antimicrobial resistance profiles were determined for representative sample of the isolates. The data obtained earlier on healthy S. aureus carriers without exposure to agriculture were used for comparison. The genotype composition of S. aureus isolates from <b>pig</b> <b>farmers</b> and veterinarians was similar to isolates from pigs with predominant AFLP clusters CC 398, CC 9, and CC 49. The resistance to tetracycline and macrolides (clarithromycin) was common among the isolates from farmers and veterinarians (52 and 21 %, respectively) and similar to resistance levels in isolates from pigs (39 and 23 %, respectively). This was in contrast to isolates from persons without contact with agriculture, where no (0 / 128) isolates were resistant to tetracycline and 3 % of the isolates were resistant to clarithromycin. MRSA CC 398 was isolated from pigs (n = 11) and <b>pig</b> <b>farmers</b> (n = 5). These data imply that zoonotic transmission of multidrug-resistant S. aureus from <b>pigs</b> to <b>farmers</b> is frequent, and well-known MRSA transmission merely represents {{the tip of the}} iceberg for this phenomenon.

Papuan <b>pig</b> <b>farmers</b> were represented by Jayapura, Biak, Ambai and Ansus(Serui), Mee(Nabire), Arfak(Manokwari) and Ayamaru(Sorong) tribes. Non-Papuan <b>pig</b> <b>farmers</b> identified with ethnic groups of Batak, Toraja, Manado and Flores. The highest numbers of pigs kept were by semi-penned <b>pig</b> <b>farmers,</b> followed by pen and restrained <b>pig</b> <b>farmers.</b> About two hours per day was devoted to work in the restrained, semi-penned and pen pig keeping systems, while less than 1. 5 hours per day was allocated by free-range <b>pig</b> <b>farmers.</b> In urban areas, feeding sources were kitchen and restaurant waste, and likewise crops and agriculture residues were in rural areas. Supplements and concentrates were used on a limited scale. Agricultural residues used were cassava, banana, taro, corn, grain and vegetable wastes.

However, when studying the four clusters of citizens with different attitudes toward sow husbandry, determined in a previous study, a variation in valuation of the moral values between the clusters of citizens and farmers came to the fore. This means that moral values are interpreted differently by groups of people when forming attitudes toward sow husbandry. The results of our study give an indication of which moral values are weighed differently between clusters of citizens and <b>pig</b> <b>farmers.</b> This information can be useful in future research on attitudes toward animal husbandry in order to understand why attitudes differ between groups of people.

40|$|African {{swine fever}} (ASF) is a notifiable, virulent swine disease, {{and is a}} major threat to animal health and trade for many European Union (EU) countries. Early {{detection}} of the introduction of ASF virus is of paramount importance to be able to limit the potential extent of outbreaks. However, the timely and accurate reporting of ASF primary cases strongly depends on how familiar <b>pig</b> <b>farmers</b> are with the clinical signs, and their motivation to report the disease. Here, an online questionnaire survey was conducted between December 2014 and April 2015 to investigate English pig farmers' knowledge and behaviour towards ASF in terms of clinical suspicion and reporting. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to identify factors influencing the two variables of interest: 1) farmers who "would immediately suspect ASF" if they observed clinical signs of fever, lethargy, reduced eating and high mortality on their farm and 2) farmers who "would immediately report ASF" if they suspected ASF on their farm. The questionnaire was completed by 109 <b>pig</b> <b>farmers.</b> Results indicate that <b>pig</b> <b>farmers</b> having poor knowledge about ASF clinical signs and limited concern about ASF compared with other pig diseases are less likely to consider the possibility of an outbreak of ASF on their farm. In addition, <b>pig</b> <b>farmers</b> lacking awareness of outbreaks in other countries, having a perception of the negative impact on them resulting from false positive reporting and the perceived complexity of reporting procedures are less likely to report an ASF suspicion. These findings indicate important areas for educational campaigns targeted at English <b>pig</b> <b>farmers</b> to focus on in an attempt to increase the likelihood of a rapid response {{in the event of an}} ASF outbreak...|$|R
