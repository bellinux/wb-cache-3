This would effectively raise levies on soybean exports from 35% to 44% {{at the time of}} the announcement. This new taxation scheme, proposed by Minister Martín Lousteau, led to a nationwide lockout by farming associations, with the aim of forcing the government to back down on new tax system. They were joined on 25 March by thousands of <b>pot-banging</b> demonstrators massed around the Buenos Aires Obelisk and the presidential palace.

500|$|Weeks {{before the}} explosion, several social {{networking}} sites had scheduled a country-wide cacerolazo (a <b>pot-banging</b> protest demonstration), known as 8A, against Kirchner for August 8. The websites had already conducted successful cacerolazos (8N and 18A). Despite the national mourning, the 8A protest went ahead as planned, with the added slogan [...] "No more pointless deaths". Candidate Ricardo Gil Lavedra thought the cacerolazo should have been canceled, as the campaigning was, but fellow candidate Rodolfo Terragno supported it. It was attended by fewer people than previous ones in Buenos Aires {{and the rest of}} the country. The demonstration in Rosario was not a cacerolazo, but a silent candlelight vigil attended by nearly a hundred people. There was a second demonstration in Rosario on August 22, proceeding from the National Flag Memorial to the headquarters of Litoral Gas.|$|E

5000|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{important}} emblem of media homophobia was Clarín, a popular, sensationalist and left-wing newspaper, which continuously published notes on homosexuals in a disparaging way, usually titrating with reports of crimes committed by [...] "colipatos", [...] "locas" [...] or [...] "yeguas" [...] as usually they called gay people. This homophobia conducted by the leftist press {{can be considered as}} an effect of the idealization of the prototype of man during the years of the Popular Unity, corresponding to the hard worker. Thus, the left visualizes manhood as the ideal of the revolution led by Salvador Allende, while the right took advantage of the image of femininity, visible in <b>pot-banging</b> demonstrations known as cacerolazos; homosexuality therefore was contrary to both conceptions, especially from the political left.|$|E
50|$|A {{number of}} cacerolazos, <b>pot-banging</b> protests, {{took place in}} several cities of Argentina on September 13 and November 8, 2012. The first, in September 13, was a {{national}} protest against {{the policies of the}} president Cristina Fernández de Kirchner. The protests generated significant repercussions in local politics.The second, on November 8 (known as 8N), was another much more massive protest in several cities in Argentina, including Buenos Aires, Córdoba, Rosario, Mendoza, Olivos, among many others throughout Greater Buenos Aires and other regions. There were also protests in Argentine embassies and consulates in cities such as New York, Miami, Madrid, Sydney, Bogotá, Santiago and Barcelona, among others. Its complaints were almost the same, but the difference in size was very big. The protests are considered not only a call to Kirchnerism, but also to the opposition, because {{they do not have a}} strong leader.|$|E

The obvious rejection of PJ decided to De la Rua to resign Parliament at 19.45 hours on 20 December 2001, when there was complete but only half of its constitutional mandate. The image of resigning President helicopter leaving the Casa Rosada, stuck forever in the memory of the Argentines. This also had as affected the political party of former president, losing most of the elections held to date, weakening the Radical against Peronism rising, that in the absence of its classic rival came to divide on two fronts. 56 57 ...|$|E
40|$|International audienceMock funerals, effigy parading, {{smearing}} {{with eggs}} and tomatoes, <b>pot-banging</b> and Carnival street theatre, arson and ransacking: all these seemingly archaic forms of action have been regular features of modern European protest, from the 19 th to the 21 st century. In a wide chronological and geographical framework, this book analyses the uses, meanings, functions and reactivations of folk imagery, behaviour and language in modern collective action. The authors examine {{the role of}} protest actors as diverse as peasants, liberal movements, nationalist and separatist parties, anarchists, workers, students, right-wing activists and the global justice movement. So-called traditional repertoires have long been described as residual and obsolete. This book challenges the conventional distinction between pre-industrial and post- 1789 forms of collective action, which continues to operate as a powerful dichotomy {{in the understanding of}} protest, and casts new light on rituals and symbolic performances that, albeit poorly understood and deciphered, are integral to our protest repertoire...|$|E
