5000|$|Prior to the 17 February declaration, the Czech Social Democratic Party and Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia {{signaled}} {{their opposition}} to recognizing any unilateral declaration by Kosovo. Shortly after the declaration they stayed true to their <b>pre-declaration</b> words, with the two parties proclaiming a similarity between Kosovo's declaration and the 1938 Munich Agreement. President Václav Klaus also sympathised with the Serbian side, saying that the Czech Republic [...] "must {{take into account the}} traditional friendly relations between the Czech and Serbian nations" [...] and that the Serbian nation [...] "has always sided with us in time of difficult historic trials".|$|E
50|$|The game can {{be played}} as one-off, or as a {{repetitive}} one, between the same or different sets of players, to distinguish between a general propensity to trust and trust within particular relationships. Several other variants of this game exist. Reversing rules lead to the game of distrust, <b>pre-declarations</b> {{can be used to}} establish intentions of players, while alterations to the distribution of gains can be used to manipulate perception of both players. The game can be also played by several players on the closed market, with or without information about reputation.|$|R
40|$|In {{the current}} market, {{extensive}} software development {{is taking place}} and the software industry is thriving. Major software giants have stated source code theft as {{a major threat to}} revenues. By inserting an identity-establishing watermark in the source code, a company can prove it's ownership over the source code. In this paper, we propose a watermarking scheme for C/C++ source codes by exploiting the language restrictions. If a function calls another function, the latter needs to be defined in the code before the former, unless one uses function <b>pre-declarations.</b> We embed the watermark in the code by imposing an ordering on the mutually independent functions by introducing bogus dependency. Removal of dependency by the attacker to erase the watermark requires extensive manual intervention thereby making the attack infeasible. The scheme is also secure against subtractive and additive attacks. Using our watermarking scheme, an n-bit watermark can be embedded in a program having n independent functions. The scheme is implemented on several sample codes and performance changes are analyzed. 4 page(s...|$|R
40|$|This thesis study {{arose from}} {{the need to develop}} a {{disaster}} plan for St John Southern Region. To facilitate this, a multiagency approach began in 1999 with all the emergency services, local authorities, regional councils, Ministry of Health and Ministry of Civil Defence and Emergency Management to prepare a predeclaration CDEM integrated response plan to link between routine emergencies and CDEM declarations. This planning process continues currently in 2006 under the guise of the Otago Southland Emergency Planning Group (OSEPG). Books, periodicals, emergency management articles sourced from both publishers, occurred from Massey University, the Police College Emergency Management collection and also Internet searches. The review was split between New Zealand authors and international authors. The review sought comparisons between integrated emergency management planning, interagency training considerations, response issues and incident management systems used to manage emergencies. These reviews allowed a comparison to research findings generated by this thesis. This thesis aims to develop policies to encourage integrated planning and response for predeclaration events. It also aims to demonstrate a process to integrate the response of diverse agencies and compares the Coordinated Incident Management System with the Otago Southland Emergency Planning Group planning and response arrangements. Information for the study was derived from developmental notes associated with the OSEPG, literature reviews and Internet comparative studies along with interviews with all the agencies participants associated with the OSEPG during the last seven years to obtain a comparative analysis. This thesis is not about the management of disasters, but is a planning emphasis for pre-CDEM events. A structure for integrated predeclaration planning is explained along with facets of the planning framework that has been operationalised in some sectors to integrate various levels of operational planning and response between some of the emergency services and rural communities. This thesis states that integrated planning and response as well as diversification of response resources at major incidents are advantageous to pre-CDEM declaration events. This thesis has demonstrated the worthiness of having planning processes for <b>pre-declaration</b> emergencies. Forums such as the OSEPG have proven it is possible to enhance the planning and response continuum between routine and declared emergencies i. e. <b>pre-declaration</b> emergencies...|$|E
40|$|By {{analyzing}} the literary piece Lope de Aguirre: Crónicas (1559 - 1561), by Mampel González and Escadell Tur (1981) {{we aim to}} verify this European conqueror profile that names the book. With the main focus on Aguirre, the six chronicles related in the book present the trajectory and the happenings in Pedro de Ursúa’s expedition, in 1560, {{in which he had}} the mission of finding the treasures of El Dorado. When he established a vital link with Peru region, Aguirre, in a letter do the Spanish Crown, denaturalizes himself from his domains, a fact that coincides with a <b>pre-declaration</b> of Independence of the American territory. Due to the course the expedition has taken, Aguirre is betrayed by his fellows, the ones who wrote texts full of convictions against the fragmented character. Based on that, this bibliographical investigation tries to recover Aguirre’s discursive image in the chronicles mentioned in order to, comparatively with the data from these chronicles, make reference to the historical novels like Daimón, by Abel Posse (1978) and Lope de Aguirre: Príncipe de la Libertad, by Miguel Otero Silva (1979) ...|$|E
