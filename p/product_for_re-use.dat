40|$|Many {{technologies}} {{currently available}} for nitrogen removal are {{not suitable for}} the treatment of mine and quarry wastewaters containing nitrogenous compounds, particularly in cold environments, due to high treatment costs or stringent operating parameters. A combination of geochemical sorption and electrochemical techniques is potentially most suitable {{for the treatment of}} large volumes of wastewater containing multiple nitrogenous compounds. Electrochemical processes utilizing enhanced ammonia stripping coupled with sorption techniques to pre-concentrate nitrogenous compounds potentially suits a large volume wastewater stream with low total nitrogen concentration, requires only low electrical potential for operation, and may result in an ammonium <b>product</b> <b>for</b> <b>re-use...</b>|$|E
40|$|This report decribes {{experiments}} with anaerobic digestation of champost and organic rest <b>products</b> <b>for</b> <b>re-use</b> in mushroom casing. The digestates {{will reduce the}} emission of carbon dioxide by peat use for casing and will {{reduce the number of}} transport movements. Both reductions serve the mushroom sector. Wageningen UR Greenhouse Horticulture is measuring the quality aspects of the digestates with standard methods used in the potting soil industry such as texture, organic matter and nutrient and ash content. In this report a literature review and measurements of digestates and casings are combined. The literature review lists critical values for amongst others salt, water and air content. It is argued values per unit volume are more informative on water and air distribution than values per unit weight. Extract indicate nutrient levels but only deliver an indirect indication of how plants or mushrooms experience their environment. Measurements indicate it is necessary to wash digestates thoroughly to arrive at EC values < 1. 0 dS/m. Stability and phytotoxicity of the end products are positive. Using the properties in a model for mixing various materials together did not deliver positive results until late in this project part. A second project part has started...|$|R
40|$|The NASA Glenn Research Center has {{constructed}} a closed-cycle hydrogen-oxygen PEM {{regenerative fuel cell}} (RFC) to explore its potential use as an energy storage device for a high altitude solar electric aircraft. Built up over the last 2 years from specialized hardware and off the shelf components the Glenn RFC is a complete "brassboard" energy storage system which includes all the equipment required to (1) absorb electrical power from an outside source and store it as pressurized hydrogen and oxygen and (2) make electrical power from the stored gases, saving the <b>product</b> water <b>for</b> <b>re-use</b> during the next cycle. It consists of a dedicated hydrogen-oxygen fuel cell stack and an electrolyzer stack, the interconnecting plumbing and valves, cooling pumps, water transfer pumps, gas recirculation pumps, phase separators, storage tanks for oxygen (O 2) and hydrogen (H 2), heat exchangers, isolation valves, pressure regulators, nitrogen purge provisions, instrumentation, and other components. It specific developmental functions include: (1) Test fuel cells and fuel cell components under repeated closed-cycle operation (nothing escapes; everything is used over and over again). (2) Simulate diurnal charge-discharge cycles (3) Observe long-term system performance and identify degradation and loss mechanisms. (4) Develop safe and convenient operation and control strategies leading to the successful development of mission-capable, flight-weight RFC's...|$|R
40|$|International audienceOlive husk (OH) quality, {{in respect}} of constituting {{particles}} characteristics (olive stones and pulp residues as result after pressing), represents an important issue. OH particles size class distribution and composition play, in fact, an important role for OH utilization as: organic amendment, bio-mass, food ingredient, plastic filler, abrasive, raw material in the cosmetic sector, dietary animal supplementation, etc.. OH is characterised by a strong variability according to olive characteristics and olive oil production process. Actually it does not exist any strategy able to quantify OH chemical-physical attributes versus its correct utilisation adopting simple, efficient and low costs analytical tools. Furthermore the possibility to perform its continuous monitoring, without any samples collection and analysis at laboratory scale, could strongly enhance OH utilization, with a great economic and environmental benefits. In this paper an analytical approach, based on HyperSpectral Imaging (HSI) is presented. HSI allows to perform, also on-line, a full quantification of OH characteristics {{in order to qualify}} this <b>product</b> <b>for</b> its further <b>re-use,</b> with particular reference as bio-mass.

Previous studies suggest {{that many of these}} medicines may be in a condition suitable <b>for</b> <b>re-use.</b> Methods All medicines returned over two months to participating community pharmacies and GP surgeries in Eastern Birmingham PCTwere assessed for type, quantity and value. A registered pharmacist assessed packs against set criteria to determine the suitability <b>for</b> possible <b>re-use.</b> Results Nine hundred and thirty-four return events were made from 910 patients, comprising 3765 items worth £ 33 608. Cardiovascular drugs (1003, 27 %) and those acting on the CNS (884, 24 %) were most prevalent. Returned packs had a median of 17 months remaining before expiry and one-quarter of packs (1248 out of 4291) were suitable <b>for</b> possible <b>re-use.</b> One-third of those suitable <b>for</b> <b>re-use</b> (476 out of 1248) contained drugs in the latest WHO Essential Drugs List.
