5|$|In 2014 Consumer Reports {{published}} {{results from}} a survey conducted with 19 secret shoppers that went to 85 dealerships in four states, making anonymous visits between December 2013 and March 2014. The secret shoppers asked a number of specific questions about cars to test the salespeople’s knowledge about electric cars. The consumer magazine decided to conduct the survey after several consumers who {{wanted to buy a}} plug-in car reported to the organization that some dealerships were steering them toward gasoline-powered models. The survey found that not all sales <b>people</b> <b>seemed</b> enthusiastic about making PEV sales; a few outright discouraged it, and even one dealer was reluctant to even show a plug-in model despite having one in stock. And many sales <b>people</b> <b>seemed</b> not to have a good understanding of electric-car tax breaks and other incentives or of charging needs and costs. Consumer Reports also found that when it came to answering basic questions, sales people at Chevrolet, Ford, and Nissan dealerships tended to be better informed than those at Honda and Toyota. The survey found that most of the Toyota dealerships visited recommended against buying a Prius Plug-in and suggested buying a standard Prius hybrid instead. Overall, the secret shoppers reported that only 13 dealers “discouraged sale of EV,” with seven of them being in New York. However, at 35 of the 85 dealerships visited, the secret shoppers said sales people recommended buying a gasoline-powered car instead.|$|E
25|$|In pre-Christian Rome and Greece, {{there had}} been some debate on which form of {{sexuality}} was preferable. While many <b>people</b> <b>seemed</b> to not oppose bisexuality, there were those who preferred to be exclusively heterosexual or homosexual. For example, a debate between homosexual and heterosexual love was included in Plutarch's Moralia.|$|E
25|$|Only {{one other}} notable event {{remained}} in the Indochina drama. In May 1975 Khmer Rouge forces boarded and captured {{the crew of the}} Mayaguez, an unarmed U.S.-registered freighter. The United States bombarded military and fuel installations on the Cambodian mainland while Marines landed by helicopter on an offshore island to rescue the crew. The 39 captives were retrieved, but the operation cost the lives of 41 U.S. military personnel. Nevertheless, the majority of the American <b>people</b> <b>seemed</b> to approve of the administration's decisive action.|$|E

25|$|This era saw the {{development}} of the new innovations in roller coasters that included extreme drops and speeds to thrill the riders. By the end of the First World War, <b>people</b> <b>seemed</b> to want an even more exciting entertainment, a need met by roller coasters. Although {{the development}} of the automobile provided people with more options for satisfying their entertainment needs, the amusement parks after the war continued to be successful, while urban amusement parks saw declining attendance. The 1920s is more properly known as the Golden Age of roller coasters, being the decade of frenetic building for these rides.|$|E
25|$|The {{album cover}} {{contributed to the}} image of Jones as a stylish beret-wearing beatnik. Jones had said the {{inspiration}} of it was from a photo of her father (an aspiring musician and waiter) in a similar pose, lighting a cigarette while sitting on a beach towel at a Chicago beach along Lake Michigan, near where the family lived. Although Donna Summer had already been wearing berets and singer-songwriter Joni Mitchell wore one for the album cover of her 1976 album Hejira, it was Jones Parisian-boho jazz sensibility that finally popularized it, propelling as a mainstay of hipster chic and (perhaps unintentionally) branding her image in the process. Despite Jones' beautiful looks and street gamine wildness, she would recall that <b>people</b> <b>seemed</b> to only recognize her in public when she was wearing the beret. The album cover photography and design was by Norman Seeff.|$|E

500|$|The {{episode was}} written under [...] "extreme pressure" [...] during the show's brief Christmas hiatus. Many critics have noted {{similarities}} between [...] "Monday" [...] and the 1993 comedy film Groundhog Day. Vince Gilligan and John Shiban, {{the writers of}} the episode, however, credit an episode of The Twilight Zone entitled [...] "Shadow Play" [...] (1961). Gilligan later noted: [...] "The funny thing about 'Monday' is <b>people</b> <b>seemed</b> to really like it a lot, but people always sorta [...] smiled and said you're sort of ripping off Groundhog Day aren't you? [...] And I'd say, we're not ripping off Groundhog Day, we're ripping off The Twilight Zone." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite Shatner's doubts, Nimoy and Bennett {{selected}} a time travel {{story in which}} the Enterprise crew encounters a problem {{that could only be}} fixed by something only available in the present day (the Star Trek characters' past). They considered ideas about violin makers and oil drillers, or a disease that had its cure destroyed with the rainforests. [...] "But the depiction of thousands of sick and dying <b>people</b> <b>seemed</b> rather gruesome for our light-hearted film, and the thought of our crew taking a 600-year round trip just to bring back a snail darter wasn't all that thrilling," [...] explained Nimoy. The director read a book on extinct animals and conceived the storyline that was eventually adopted. Nimoy hit upon the idea of humpback whales after talking with a friend—their song added mystery to the story, and their size added logistical challenges the heroes would have to overcome.|$|E

The day's political demonstration and the ubiquity of its news coverage provide background noise to Perowne's day, leading to him to ponder his relationship with these events. Christopher Hitchens {{pointed out that the}} novel is set on the [...] "actual day the whole of bien-pensant Britain moved into the streets to jeer at George Bush and Tony Blair" [...] and placed the novel as [...] "unapologetically anchored {{as it is in the}} material world and its several discontents". The Economist newspaper set the context as a [...] "world where terrorism and war make headlines, but also filter into the smallest corners of people's lives." [...] McEwan said himself, [...] "The march gathered not far from my house, and it bothered me that so many <b>people</b> <b>seemed</b> so thrilled to be there". The characterisation of Perowne as an intelligent, self-aware man: [...] "..a habitual observer of his own moods' [...] is given to reveries about his mental processes," [...] allows the author to explicitly set out this theme.|$|E

500|$|Carte's first London season, at the Prince's Theatre, 1919–20, {{featured}} ten of {{the thirteen}} extant Gilbert and Sullivan operas. [...] These included Princess Ida, which had its first London performances since the original production. [...] The new productions retained the text and music of the original 1870s and 1880s productions, and director J. M. Gordon preserved much of Gilbert's original direction. [...] As his parents had done, Carte licensed the operas to the J. C. Williamson company and to amateur companies, but he required all licensees to present them in approved productions that closely followed the libretto, score and D'Oyly Carte production stagings. [...] In an interview with The Times in 1922, Carte said that the Savoy [...] "tradition" [...] was an expression that was frequently misunderstood: [...] "It did {{not by any means}} imply any hidebound stage 'business' or an attempt to standardize the performances of artists so as to check their individual method of expression. [...] All that it implied, in his view, was the highest possible standard of production – with especial attention to clear enunciation.... Many <b>people</b> <b>seemed</b> to think that Gilbert believed in absolutely set methods but this was not by any means the case. [...] He did not hesitate to alter productions when they were revived." ...|$|E

Another suggested source for the abbreviation was Matsushita-Sony. However, according to Kazuhiko Nishi, the team used [...] "Machines with Software eXchangeability" [...] during its development. In 1985, Kazuhiko Nishi said that he named MSX after the MX missile.|$|E

2500|$|The Soviet {{government}} itself said very little publicly about {{the change in}} the law, and few <b>people</b> <b>seemed</b> to be aware that it existed. [...] In 1934, the British Communist Harry Whyte wrote a long letter to Stalin condemning the law, and its prejudicial motivations. [...] He laid out a Marxist position against the oppression of homosexuals, as a social minority, and compared homophobia to racism, xenophobia and sexism. While the letter was not formally replied to, Soviet cultural writer Maxim Gorky authored an article, published in both Pravda and Izvestia titled [...] "Proletarian Humanism", that seemed to reject Whyte's arguments point by point. He rejected the notion that homosexuals were a social minority, and argued that the Soviet Union, governed by [...] "manly proletariat", is obliged to persecute homosexuals to protect the youth from their corrupting effect. He also equated homosexuality with fascism, stating that destroying homosexuality would in turn destroy fascism. In 1936, Justice Commissar Nikolai Krylenko publicly stated that the anti-gay criminal law was aimed at the decadent and effete old ruling classes.|$|E
2500|$|After Goforth’s {{address the}} first morning an elder stood up before all the people and confessed to having embezzled church funds. The effect on the hearers was “instantaneous”. One person gave a [...] “piercing cry” then many, now in tears, began {{spontaneous}} prayer and confession. For three days these incidents continued. Goforth recorded, [...] "On the fourth morning an unusually large congregation had assembled. The <b>people</b> <b>seemed</b> tense, expectant… Just then the hymn ended, and I rose to speak. All through that address I was acutely conscious {{of the presence of}} God. Concluding, I said to the people: [...] "You may pray." [...] Immediately a man left his seat and, with bowed head and tears streaming down his cheeks, came up {{to the front of the}} church and stood facing the congregation. It was the elder who, two days before, had given vent to that awful cry. As if impelled by some power quite beyond himself, he cried out: [...] "I have committed adultery. I have tried three times to poison my wife." [...] Whereupon he tore off the golden bracelets on his wrist and the gold ring from his finger and placed them on the collection plate, saying: [...] "What have I, an elder of the Church, to do with these baubles?" [...] Then he took out his elder's card, tore it into pieces and threw the fragments on the floor. [...] "You people have my cards in your homes," [...] he cried. [...] "Kindly tear them up. I have disgraced the holy office. I herewith resign my eldership." [...] For several minutes after this striking testimony no one stirred. Then, one after another, the entire session rose and tendered their resignations. The general burden of their confession was: [...] "Though we have not sinned as our brother has, yet we, too, have sinned, and are unworthy to hold the sacred office any longer." [...] Then, the deacons one by one got up and resigned from their office. [...] "We, too, are unworthy," [...] they confessed. For days I had noticed how the floor in front of the native pastor was wet with tears. He now rose and in broken tones said, [...] "It is I who am to blame. If I had been what I ought to have been, this congregation would not be where it is to day. I'm not fit to be your pastor any longer. I, too, must resign." [...] Then there followed one of the most touching scenes that I have ever witnessed. From different parts of the congregation the cry was heard: [...] "It's all right, pastor. We appoint you to be our pastor." [...] The cry was taken up until it seemed as if every one was endeavouring to tell the broken man standing there on the platform that their faith and confidence in him had been completely restored. There followed a call for the elders to stand up; and as the penitent leaders stood in their places, with their heads bowed, the spontaneous vote of confidence was repeated, [...] "Elders, we appoint you to be our elders." [...] Then came the deacons' turn. [...] "Deacons, we appoint you to be our deacons." [...] Thus were harmony and trust restored. That evening the elder whose confession had had such a marked effect was remonstrated with by one of his friends. [...] "What made you go and disgrace yourself and your family like that?" [...] he was asked. [...] "Could I help it?" [...] he replied." ...|$|E
