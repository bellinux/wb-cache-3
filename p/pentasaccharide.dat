5|$|The archetypal {{example of}} this {{situation}} is antithrombin, which circulates in plasma in a partially inserted relatively inactive state. The primary specificity determining residue (the P1 arginine) points toward {{the body of the}} serpin and is unavailable to the protease. Upon binding a high-affinity <b>pentasaccharide</b> sequence within long-chain heparin, antithrombin undergoes a conformational change, RCL expulsion, and exposure of the P1 arginine. The heparin pentasaccharide-bound form of antithrombin is, thus, a more effective inhibitor of thrombin and factor Xa. Furthermore, both of these coagulation proteases also contain binding sites (called exosites) for heparin. Heparin, therefore, also acts as a template for binding of both protease and serpin, further dramatically accelerating the interaction between the two parties. After the initial interaction, the final serpin complex is formed and the heparin moiety is released. This interaction is physiologically important. For example, after injury to the blood vessel wall, heparin is exposed, and antithrombin is activated to control the clotting response. Understanding of the molecular basis of this interaction enabled the development of Fondaparinux, a synthetic form of Heparin <b>pentasaccharide</b> used as an anti-clotting drug.|$|E

40|$|We {{have shown}} that a Rhizobium meliloti strain overexpressing {{nodulation}} genes excreted high amounts {{of a family of}} N-acylated and 6 -O-sulfated N-acetyl-beta- 1, 4 -D-glucosamine penta-, tetra-, and trisaccharide Nod factors. Either a C(16 : 2) or a C(16 : 3) acyl chain is attached to the nonreducing end subunit, whereas the sulfate group is bound to the reducing glucosamine. One of the tetrasaccharides is identical to the previously described NodRm- 1 factor. The two <b>pentasaccharides</b> as well as NodRm- 1 were purified and tested for biological activity. In the root hair deformation assay the <b>pentasaccharides</b> show similar activities on the host plants Medicago sativa and Melilotus albus and on the non-host plant Vicia sativa at a dilution of up to 0. 01 - 0. 001 microM, in contrast to NodRm- 1, which displays a much higher specific activity for Medicago and Melilotus than for Vicia. The active concentration range of the <b>pentasaccharides</b> is more narrow on Medicago than on Melilotus and Vicia. In addition to root hair deformation, the different Nod factors were shown to induce nodule formation on M. sativa. We suggest that the production of a series of active signal molecules with different degrees of specificity might be important in controlling the symbiosis of R. meliloti with several different host plants or under different environmental conditions...|$|R
40|$|International audienceDue {{to their}} {{numerous}} biological properties, natural sulfated polysaccharides have attracted {{the interest of}} the food and pharmaceutical industries. Membrane processes were thought to be especially suitable for their production at industrial scale. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the effect of sodium chloride, often used as a preservative and a precipitation adjuvant, on the ultrafiltration of sulfated <b>pentasaccharides.</b> In pure water, results showed a complete retention of the polymers on membranes with molecular weight cut-off up to eight times the molecular weight of the studied <b>pentasaccharides.</b> When NaCl was added to a concentration of 0. 5 mol L- 1, retention rates decreased significantly (approximate to- 50 %). As no relevant modification of the molecules size was observed through hydrodynamic radius measurements, these variations of selectivity were fully attributed to the screening of membrane surface charges by the electrolyte. Therefore, optimising the ultrafiltration of charged molecules need absolutely exammining electrostatic interactions. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|AbstractA {{methodology}} {{to determine}} the linkage position of oligosaccharides is presented. In order to illustrate this technique, several oligosaccharides and disaccharides were ionized by electrospray and analyzed in a Paul trap mass spectrometer. Multiple stage tandem mass spectrometry experiments {{were used to determine}} linkage and structural information for the following four cobalt coordinated and singly charged ([M+Co−H]+) pentasaccharides: Lacto-N-fucopentaose I, II, III, and V. In order to differentiate between linkage positions, multiple low energy collision induced experiments with mass selected C type ions have been carried out in an ion trap mass spectrometer. Because of the coordination with cobalt, which directs the dissociation pathways, these C type ions undergo specific fragmentation reactions upon low energy collision induced dissociation. These dissociation pathways are unambiguously dependent on their linkage position, thus allowing differentiation between 1 → 2, 1 → 3, 1 → 4, and 1 → 6 linkage positions throughout the oligomers. Studies on various linked disaccharides and N-acetyl-disaccharides, which are smaller constituents of the <b>pentasaccharides,</b> were used to verify and confirm the results obtained from the <b>pentasaccharides...</b>|$|R
25|$|Upon binding to this <b>pentasaccharide</b> sequence, {{inhibition}} of protease activity is increased by heparin {{as a result}} of two distinct mechanisms. In one mechanism heparin stimulation of Factor IXa and Xa inhibition depends on a conformational change within antithrombin involving the reactive site loop and is thus allosteric. In another mechanism stimulation of thrombin inhibition depends on the formation of a ternary complex between AT-III, thrombin, and heparin.|$|E
25|$|The {{conformational}} change most relevant for Factor IXa and Xa inhibition involves the P14 and P15 amino acids within the N-terminal {{region of the}} reactive site loop (circled in Figure 4 model B). This region has been termed the hinge region. The {{conformational change}} within the hinge region in response to heparin binding results in the expulsion of P14 and P15 from {{the main body of}} the protein and it has been shown that by preventing this conformational change, increased Factor IXa and Xa inhibition does not occur. It is thought that the increased flexibility given to the reactive site loop as a result of the hinge region conformational change is a key factor in influencing increased Factor IXa and Xa inhibition. It has been calculated that in the absence of the <b>pentasaccharide</b> only one in every 400 Antithrombin molecules (0.25%) is in an active conformation with the P14 and P15 amino acids expelled.|$|E

40|$|Increasing {{knowledge}} on {{the function of}} the hemostatic system in vivo and limitations of currently available anticoagulant agents have {{led to the development of}} a new generation of anticoagulants. These new agents have a greater specificity towards activated coagulation pathways and factors and are presently being evaluated in clinical studies. The new generation anticoagulants include specific inhibitors of factor IIa (melagatran), factor Xa (<b>pentasaccharides),</b> and agents that interfere with tissue factor (TF) activity. A limitation of this new class of anticoagulants may be the lack of an appropriate strategy to reverse the effect if a bleeding event occurs. Recombinant factor VIIa (rFVIIa) is a potent prohemostatic agent and may represent an interesting option for consideration when an antidote is required. Indeed, rFVIIa has proven to be efficacious in the reversal of anticoagulant treatment with vitamin K antagonists. Studies in healthy subjects have also revealed that rFVIIa administration corrects coagulation time and can induce thrombin generation during anticoagulation with <b>pentasaccharides</b> or TF-inhibiting therapy. These results indicate that rFVIIa infusion results in a prohemostatic response in vivo in patients receiving treatment with factor Xa- or TF-specific anticoagulants. This suggests that rFVIIa may be a good candidate as an antidote for new anticoagulants in cases of (severe) bleeding or in patients scheduled for emergency surger...|$|R

The difference in dissociation constant {{between the two is}} threefold for the <b>pentasaccharide</b> shown in Figure 3 and greater than tenfold for full length heparin, with β-antithrombin having a higher affinity. The higher affinity of β-antithrombin is thought to be due to the increased rate at which subsequent conformational changes occur within the protein upon initial heparin binding. For α-antithrombin, the additional glycosylation at Asn-135 is not thought to interfere with initial heparin binding, but rather to inhibit any resulting conformational changes.|$|E

However, naturally occurring antibodies in human blood against the Galα 1 → 3 Gal antigen on pig endothelial cells lead to hyperacute or, if prevented, acute or delayed vascular rejection of the pig graft. The {{purpose of this study}} was therefore to evaluate synthetic oligosaccharides with terminal Galα 1 → 3 Gal to inhibit antigen-binding and cytotoxicity of anti-αGal antibodies against pig cells. Different oligosaccharides were synthesized chemically and by a combined chemico-enzymatic approach. These included monomeric di-, tri-, and <b>pentasaccharides,</b> a polyacrylamide-conjugate (PAA-Bdi), as well as di-, tetra-, and octamers of Galα 1 → 3 Gal. All were tested for inhibitory activity by anti-αGal ELISA and complement-dependent cytotoxicity tests. PAA-Bdi was the best inhibitor of binding as well as cytotoxicity of anti-αGal antibodies. Monomeric oligosaccharides efficiently prevented binding of anti-αGal IgG, but less well that of anti-αGal IgM, with tri- and <b>pentasaccharides</b> showing a better efficacy than the disaccharide. The two trisaccharides Galα 1 → 3 Galβ 1 → 4 GlcNAc and Galα 1 → 3 Galβ 1 → 3 GlcNAc were equally effective. Oligomers of Galα 1 → 3 Gal were more effective than monomers in blocking the binding of anti-αGal IgG. However, they could not block IgM binding, nor could they match the efficacy of PAA-Bdi. We conclude that oligosaccharides with terminal Galα 1 → 3 Gal, most effectively as PAA-conjugates, can prevent binding and cytotoxicity of human anti-αGal in vitro.
