40|$|ABSTRACTIn this study, {{the model}} tests were {{conducted}} on the short piles installed in sands under a horizontal <b>pullout</b> <b>load</b> to investigate their behavior characteristics. From the horizontal loading tests where dimensions of the pile diameter and length, and loading point were varied, the horizontal pullout resistance and the rotational and translational movement pattern of the pile were investigated. As a result, the horizontal pullout resistance of the pile embedded in sands was dependent on the pile length, diameter, loading point, etc. The ultimate horizontal <b>pullout</b> <b>load</b> tended to increase as the loading point (h/L) moved to the bottom {{from the top of}} the pile, regardless of the ratio between the pile length and diameter (L/D), reached the maximum value at the point of h/L = 0. 75, and decreased afterwards. When the horizontal <b>pullout</b> <b>load</b> acted on the upper part above the middle of the pile, the pile rotated clockwise and moved to the pullout direction, and the pivot point of the pile was located at 150 – 360 mm depth below the ground surface. On the other hand, when the horizontal <b>pullout</b> <b>load</b> acted on the lower part of the pile, the pile rotated counterclockwise and travelled horizontally, and the rotational angle was very small...|$|E

One of the best ways to reduce the environmental pollution is by recycling PET as a ringshaped PET (RPET) fiber in concrete. Therefore, it is appropriate to investigate the RPET fiber in term of pullout strength of RPET fiber concrete. A rotal of 30 cubes for the fiber pullout test were made with three embedded fiber length sizes, namely l 5 mm, 20 mm, and 25 mm. The RPET- 10 fiber exhibited the highest <b>pullout</b> <b>load</b> of 103. 6 % compared with RPET- 5 fiber at l 5 mm embedded length.

40|$|Background: The {{objective}} of this cadaveric study was to analyze the effects of iatrogenic pedicle perforations from screw misplacement on the mean pullout strength of lower thoracic and lumbar pedicle screws. We also investigated the effect of bone mineral density (BMD), diameter of pedicle screws, and the region of spine on the pullout strength of pedicle screws. Materials and Methods: Sixty fresh human cadaveric vertebrae (D 10 -L 2) were harvested. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan of vertebrae was done for BMD. Titanium pedicle screws of different diameters (5. 2 and 6. 2 mm) were inserted in the thoracic and lumbar segments after dividing the specimens into three groups: a) standard pedicle screw (no cortical perforation); b) screw with medial cortical perforation; and c) screw with lateral cortical perforation. Finally, <b>pullout</b> <b>load</b> of pedicle screws was recorded using INSTRON Universal Testing Machine. Results: Compared with standard placement, medially misplaced screws had 9. 4 % greater mean pullout strength and laterally misplaced screws had 47. 3 % lesser mean pullout strength. The pullout strength of the 6. 2 mm pedicle screws was 33 % {{greater than that of}} the 5. 2 mm pedicle screws. The <b>pullout</b> <b>load</b> of pedicle screws in lumbar vertebra was 13. 9 % greater than that in the thoracic vertebra (P = 0. 105), but it was not statistically significant. There {{was no significant difference between}} pullout loads of vertebra with different BMD (P = 0. 901). Conclusion: The mean pullout strength was less with lateral misplaced pedicle screws while medial misplaced pedicle screw had more pullout strength. The <b>pullout</b> <b>load</b> of 6. 2 mm screws was greater than that of 5. 2 mm pedicle screws. No significant correlation was found between bone mineral densities and the pullout strength of vertebra.

Experimental observations on the effect of tensile ductility on the microcracking damage and anchor pullout performance were used to verify the numerical model. Furthermore, the influence of several parameters, including tensile ductility, tensile strength, compressive strength and modulus of elasticity, on the anchor pullout behavior was clarified numerically. It was demonstrated that the intrinsic tensile ductility in ECC led to significant enhancement of load and displacement capacities.

In the present study, {{an investigation into the}} pullout behaviour of soil nail with circular discs along the shaft has been carried out by a three-dimensional finite element analysis using Abaqus/Explicit routine. A total of 67 simulations have been performed to accurately predict the pullout behaviour of soil nail. The soil nail under study has circular discs along its shaft varying in numbers from 1 to 4. The pullout of this soil nail in a pullout test box has been simulated with a constant overburden pressure of 20  kPa acting on the nail. The pullout load–displacement characteristics, stresses around soil nail and failure mechanism during pullout are studied. Variations of dimensionless factors such as normalised <b>pullout</b> <b>load</b> factor and bearing capacity factor have been obtained with different combinations of parameters in terms of relative disc spacing ratio, anchorage length ratio, embedment ratio, diameter ratio and displacement ratio.

40|$|The {{conventional}} grouted {{connections with}} corrugated aluminium sleeves {{have been used}} widely in precast concrete construction. The main problem of the conventional grouted sleeve connections {{is the need for}} long embedded lengths reinforcement rebars to achieve full continuity. There is a tendency for the long rebars to touch the sleeve wall and subsequently preventing penetration of grout around the rebar. Since the grout inside the sleeve cannot be inspected after installation, there is doubt that the main rebar is fully bonded. This study proposed a grouted spiral connection which can overcome the use of long embedded length of connected rebars. The main objective {{of this study was to}} investigate the effect of spiral confinement on the bond stress-slip relationship. The experimental program was carried out in two phases, Phase I and Phase II. In Phase I, a total of thirty-six spiral connections were subjected to increasing direct axial <b>pullout</b> <b>loads.</b> Then, in Phase II, a total of twelve beams comprising spiral connections were subjected to flexural <b>pullout</b> <b>loads.</b> Parameters considered in this study were pitch distance and diameter of spiral connections. The experimental results showed that the use of smaller pitch distance and spiral diameter resulted in higher bond strength. However, the spiral diameter had more dominant confinement effect such that it increased the bond strength of direct and flexural pullout tests very dramatically by 34. 5 % and 40 %, respectively. In addition, lower bond strength from the beam tests was reported as compared to the axial pullout tests. The bond strengths obtained from the flexural pullout tests were within the range of 0. 74 to 0. 79 times the bond strengths of the axial pullout tests.

40|$|Structures like buried pipelines, {{transmission}} {{towers and}} earth structures subjected to considerable vertical or horizontal pullout forces are usually supported by anchors. The anchors are helical or plate systems which require excavation and grout in their applications. During {{the last fifty}} years, many researchers focused on pullout capacity of anchors.

SHS is a new anchor system base {{on the state of the}} art of plate anchors that does not require grout and excavation in their applications. The experiments were conducted in a chamber box. Two sizes of SHS with the length 297 and 159 mm were used. For the 159 mm long SHS, an embedment ratio between 1 and 7 were employed. For the SHS of length 297 mm the embedment ratio used were between 1 to 4. Both SHS were tested in loose and dense sand.

40|$|STUDY DESIGN:: Cadaveric and biomechanical study. OBJECTIVE:: Assess {{the safety}} and pullout {{strength}} of medial, partial non-threaded thoracic pedicle screws compared to conventional screws. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA:: The perforation rate of pedicle screws has been reported as high as 41. Nerve injury and irritation can result from compression of malpositioned screw on neural structures. METHODS:: Ten fresh cadavers were studied. 5. 0 mm and 6. 0 mm screws were inserted from T 1 -T 6 and T 7 -T 12 respectively. Pedicle perforations and fractures were recorded upon screw insertion and final positioning (non-threaded portion facing medially) following a wide laminectomy. Pullout strength of novel and conventional screws were then tested using an Instron machine in an artificial bone substitute. RESULTS:: 240 thoracic pedicle screws were inserted. 88. 8 (213 screws) were fully contained during screw insertion. There were 5. 0 (12 screws) Grade 1 medial perforations and 6. 2 (15 screws) Grade 1 lateral perforations during screw insertion. Upon final positioning, 93. 8 (225 screws) were fully contained. All Grade 1 medial perforations, which occurred during insertion, were converted to Grade 0. No dural or nerve root injuries occurred. Pedicle split fractures were noted in 6. 7 (16 screws). The use of medial, partial non-threaded screws reduced the overall perforation rate from 11. 2 to 6. 2. The mean <b>pullout</b> <b>load</b> for the 5 mm fully threaded screw vs. medial, partial non-threaded was 1419. 3 NÂ± 106. 1 (1275. 8 - 1538. 8 N) and 1336. 6 NÂ± 44. 2 (1293. 0 - 1405. 1 N) respectively, whereas 6 mm <b>pullout</b> <b>load</b> averaged 2126. 0 NÂ± 134. 8 (1986. 3 - 2338. 3 N) and 2036. 5 NÂ± 210. 0 (1818. 4 - 2355. 9 N). The difference was not statistically significant. CONCLUSION:: The use of medial, partial non-threaded pedicle screws reduced the medial perforation rate from 5. 0 to 0; however, pullout strength was not significantly reduced. The use of this novel screw can potentially {{reduce the incidence of}} nerve injury or irritation following medial pedicle perforations...|$|E

40|$|Soil anchors are {{commonly}} used as foundation systems for structures requiring uplift resistance such as transmission towers, or for structures requiring lateral resistance, such as sheet pile walls. Anchors commonly {{have more than one}} plate or bearing element and therefore there is a complex interaction between adjacent plates due to overlapping stress zones.

However, no thorough numerical analyses have been performed to determine the ultimate <b>pullout</b> <b>loads</b> of multi-plate anchors. By far the majority of the research has been directed toward the tensile uplift behaviour of single anchors (only one plate).

40|$|AbstractGranular anchors (GAs) {{can resist}} pullout/uplift forces, {{compression}} forces and also provide ground improvement.

This paper describes a program of field testing and numerical modelling of the pullout resistance of GA installations in overconsolidated clay for the undrained (short term) condition. Pertinent modes of failure are identified for different column length to diameter (L/D) ratios. The applied <b>pullout</b> <b>load</b> is resisted in shaft capacity for short GAs or in end-bulging of the granular column for long GAs. In other words, the failure mode is dependent on the column L/D ratio.

30|$|The {{response}} of a buried pipe subjected to relative axial ground movement is investigated {{in this study}} using three-dimensional discrete element analysis. A discrete element model that is able to simulate the particulate nature of the granular material and the continuous nature of the pipe was developed. The micro-parameters of the model were calibrated using triaxial tests. The developed pipe–soil model was validated using experimental data and then {{used to calculate the}} pipe response to axial loading under varying soil conditions. A comparison was also made between the calculated response and the available closed-form solutions. Results indicated that, for pipes installed in dense sand, existing solutions may not properly account for the dilative behavior of the soil and hence underestimate the axial soil resistance. A parametric study was performed using the validated model to evaluate the factors controlling the axial soil resistance under these loading conditions. The contributing parameters are found to be the pipe diameter, burial depth, and soil properties. Results of the parametric study were used to develop an expression to estimate the earth pressure coefficient that reflects the dilative nature of the soil. An example is provided to illustrate the use of the proposed expression in estimating the maximum soil resistance to <b>pullout</b> <b>loading.</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} aims {{to the design}} of a finite-element model {{simulating}} accurately the pullout behaviour of cylindrical pedicle screws and predicting their pullout force. Three commercial pedicle screws, subjected to pure pullout from synthetic bone, were studied experimentally. The results were used for the design, calibration and validation of a finite-element model. Special attention was paid to the accurate simulation of the failure inside the host material under shear. For this purpose, a bilinear cohesive zone material model was adopted, controlling the mode-II debonding of neighbouring elements {{in the vicinity of the}} screw. Comparison between experimental and numerical results proved that the implementation of this approach can significantly enhance the accuracy of the numerical simulation of a screw's mechanical behaviour under pure <b>pullout</b> <b>loads.</b> The numerical model was used for the parametric study of various factors affecting the pullout performance of a cylindrical pedicle screw. It was concluded that the major parameter influencing the pullout force is the outer radius (increasing its value by 36 % increases the pullout force by 34 %). The influence of the purchase length of the screw is of similar quantitative nature. The respective dependence on the thread inclination, depth and pitch was significantly weaker. (C) 2009 IPEM.

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} results of load and {{resistance}} factor design (LRFD) calibration for pullout and yield limit states for steel grid reinforced soil walls owing to soil self-weight loading plus permanent uniform surcharge. The calibration method uses bias statistics to account for prediction accuracy of the underlying deterministic models for reinforcement <b>load,</b> <b>pullout</b> capacity and yield strength of the steel grids, and random variability in input parameters. A new revised pullout design model is proposed to improve pullout resistance prediction accuracy and to remove hidden dependency with calculated <b>pullout</b> resistance values. <b>Load</b> and resistance factors are proposed that give a uniform probability of failure of 1 % for both pullout and yield limit states. The approach adopted in this paper has application {{to a wide variety}} of other reinforced soil wall technologies...|$|R
