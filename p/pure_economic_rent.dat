40|$|In this paper, we {{analyze the}} dynamic {{behavior}} {{of employment and}} hours worked per worker in a stochastic general equilibrium model with a matching mechanism between vacancies and unemployed workers. The model is estimated for the U. S. using the Generalized Methods of Moments (GMM) estimation technique. An increase in government spending raises hours worked per worker, and crowds out private consumption due to a negative wealth effect. On the path converging towards the steady state, private consumption is below its long run average and increases, which implies that the interest rate is above its long run average and declines. The interest rate effect dominates the <b>pure</b> <b>economic</b> <b>rent</b> effect on the capital value of a hired worker to the firm, causing a reduction of job openings and consequently a decrease in employment. These results are contrasted with the predictions of a version of Burnside, Eichenbaum and Rebelo's (1993) labor hoarding model. Employment; Expenditures, Public; Econometric models...|$|E

The incentive effects of the transfer programs on provincial tax and spending policies are discussed. In particular, it is shown that equalization grants effectively compensate recipient governments {{for a portion of}} the deadweight loss associated with taxes, and consequently the grants may tend to increase the distortionary tax rates chosen by those governments. This may be the case even when equalization is confined to tax bases which are themselves non-distortionary, such as the taxation of <b>pure</b> <b>economic</b> <b>rents.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|According to Becker's (1957) {{theory of}} taste-based {{employer}} discrimination, <b>pure</b> <b>economic</b> <b>rents</b> {{are necessary for}} discrimination to be observed in the labor market. Increased competition and reduced rents {{in the market for}} final goods should therefore lead to reduced labor market discrimination. We look at the natural experiment represented by the Brazilian trade liberalization from the early 1990 s to study the effect of increased competition in the market for final goods on racial discrimination in the labor market. Changes in tariffs and initial employment structures are used to show that, in locations where there were relatively larger increases in exposure to foreign competition between 1990 and 1995, there were also relatively larger declines in the conditional racial wage gap between 1991 and 2000. As predicted by theory, the initial wage gap and its decline were more pronounced in regions with more employment in concentrated sectors. The effect of increased competition on the racial wage gap was not driven by changes in returns to productive attributes, in the structure of employment, or in other labor market outcomes. We find robust evidence of a negative effect of increased competition in the market for final goods on discrimination in the labor market...|$|R
40|$|Farm budgets {{based on}} survey data a r e used to {{calculate}} the net revenue for average irrigated and unirrigated farms for four tenure classes on the Milagro irrigation project, Ecuador. Differences in net revenues between irrigated and unirrigated farms within each tenure class are assumed to be the return to investment in irrigation capital, assuming homogeneity of all other production factors. The internal rate of return is calculated on investment in irrigation capital assuming returns to such an investment are the difference in net revenues between irrigated and unirrigated farms. Investment in such capital is found to be highly profitable assuming the opportunity cost of capital is 12 per cent. However, small size farms (minifundios) are relatively more profitable than larger farms. Also, the <b>pure</b> <b>economic</b> profit (<b>rent)</b> accruing to each hectar of land is determined. This is done by finding the water tariff that causes the internal rate of return to fall to 12 per cent and subtracting the current water tariff per hectar (S/. 200) from the maximum tariff. The difference is rent per hectar, which is greater for small farms than larger ones. However, when total land area by tenure class is considered, larger farms capture the greatest share of the <b>economic</b> <b>rent</b> from the project...|$|R

50|$|In {{regard to}} labor, <b>economic</b> <b>rent</b> {{can be created}} by the {{existence}} of guilds or labor unions (e.g., higher pay for workers, where political action creates a scarcity of such workers).

40|$|The {{consumer}} surplus and <b>economic</b> <b>rent</b> methods of resource valuation {{were applied to}} boating recreation in Utah. Total {{consumer surplus}} and <b>economic</b> <b>rent</b> values were estimated for twenty-four boating sites. These values incorporate the relationship existing between the variable use cost and the units of activity associated with the site. Data were collected by a mail survey directed to boaters during the 1973 boating season. Approximately 1, 408 questionnaires were analyzed. Additional {{data were collected from}} the Utah Division of Parks and Recreation. <b>Economic</b> <b>rent</b> and consumer surplus were compared by using a common mathematical model and empirical observation. The concepts of <b>economic</b> <b>rent</b> and consumer surplus were assumed to be consistent methods of resource valuation and that the models would yield equivalent values. Three stages of the calculation procedure were considered in analyzing the comparison of the two methodologies. In the first stage, the <b>economic</b> <b>rent</b> and consumer surplus values were compared and the <b>economic</b> <b>rent</b> estimate consistently exceeded the consumer surplus. In the second and third stages, the projected values for an origin visiting a site were compared with the total values for a site. This process did not demonstrate any unique relationship between the two resource valuation methodologies. The most significant factors contributing to the inconsistent relationship between <b>economic</b> <b>rent</b> and consumer surplus are using the number of trips in the <b>economic</b> <b>rent</b> model and the numbers of trips per capita in the consumer surplus model, the constant <b>economic</b> <b>rent</b> per trip, and the decline in the consumer surplus for an additional trip per capita; and the respective projection factors of the two models...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{is composed}} of five chapters that investigate the extent and role of <b>economic</b> <b>rent</b> in distribution contracts between manufacturers and dealers. Manufacturers often devise contractual mechanisms that enable downstream dealers to earn <b>economic</b> <b>rent.</b> One such mechanism is the two-stage ordering process with quantity discounts used by MNCs and local enterprises operating in China and elsewhere. Chapter 2 shows how, in theory, this ordering process enables manufacturers to determine indirectly the outcomes of downstream competition to be either Bertrand or Cournot, which in turn affects the <b>economic</b> <b>rent</b> earned by their dealers. In Chapter 3, I match the results of my theoretical model to the longitudinal data obtained from a leading Chinese manufacturer of a key computer accessory. I use the data to estimate unobserved final prices and thus the <b>economic</b> <b>rent</b> earned by each of its sixty dealers over a one-year period. I show empirically that the two-stage ordering process of this manufacturer leaves <b>economic</b> <b>rent</b> with its heterogeneous group of dealers. Chapter 4 looks at the role of <b>economic</b> <b>rent,</b> in conjunction with manufacturer’s supervisory effort, in enforcing desired yet non-contractible dealer marketing effort. Based on the institutional arrangements adopted by the computer accessory manufacturer, I find {{that the size of}} downstream <b>economic</b> <b>rent</b> and the manufacturer’s supervision intensity are used as complementary control instruments to induce non-contractible dealer marketing effort...|$|R

40|$|<b>Pure</b> <b>economic</b> loss is {{financial}} loss unaccompanied by damage or injury {{other than the}} defective building itself. The position of <b>pure</b> <b>economic</b> loss in the United Kingdom {{as well as its}} commonwealth counterparts has gone through a complicated process but has finally taken up their stands. What about the position of this difficult and complex area in Malaysia? Most commentators, writers, lawyers and judges generally said that Malaysia allowes <b>pure</b> <b>economic</b> loss. They use the case of Dr Abdul Hamid Abdul Rashid & Anor v Jurusan Malaysia Consultant and Majlis Perbandaran Ampang Jaya v. Steven Phoa to support their contention. The subject of Dr Hamid?s case was the rear portion of plaintiff?s bungalow collapsed and the plaintiff sued inter alia, the engineer and contractor. The recent Steven Phoa?s case has formed a part of a series of interconnected cases dealing with the Highland Towers saga which flowed from a catastrophic collapse of tower blocks of apartments on a hillside in Kuala Lumpur. It is proposed that the judgments of the two cases are uncertain and unclear as to the existence of <b>pure</b> <b>economic</b> loss.

50|$|Georgism is {{concerned}} with the distribution of <b>economic</b> <b>rent</b> caused by natural monopolies, pollution, and the control of commons, including title of ownership for natural resources and other contrived privileges (e.g., intellectual property).

Georgists argue that taxing <b>economic</b> <b>rent</b> is efficient, fair, and equitable. The main Georgist policy recommendation is a tax assessed on land value. Georgists argue that revenues from a land value tax (LVT) can be used to reduce or eliminate existing taxes (for example, on income, trade, or purchases) that are unfair and inefficient. Some Georgists also advocate for the return of surplus public revenue back to the people by means of a basic income or citizen's dividend.|$|R
