[3] proposed a topology called Flattened Butterfly (FBFLY) and exploited managing the <b>port</b> <b>rate</b> with FBFLY to save energy consumed by the DCN. The authors combined load prediction with link’s dynamic traffic range to ensure that each link has the appropriate link speed to satisfy the traffic load. The approach presented in [10] focused on saving energy by traffic merging with FBFLY. The authors presented {{the design of a}} hardware called traffic merge network, which merges traffic from multiple links prior to feeding the merged traffic to the switch. The merged traffic enters the switch through several ports which are assigned maximum <b>port</b> <b>rate,</b> and other ports are assigned lower <b>port</b> <b>rate.</b>|$|E

Number portability allows a user {{to keep her}} telephone number as she moves to another provider. Number portability has been adopted by more and more countries around the world. A number that has a new provider is called a ported number. Traversal of a call to a ported number may involve three different networks: the Originating Network where the call originates, the Donor Network who initially assigned the telephone number to the subscriber, and the Recipient Network that currently hosts the subscriber's number. Currently, there are four major schemes used for routing a call to ported numbers. As of now, there has been very little quantitative study on how these schemes perform {{as more and more}} numbers are ported since there has been an an increasing trend of more subscribers choosing number portability; therefore, employing a more stable and efficient routing scheme is important. In this paper, we present a simulation study of the four routing schemes for number portability and discuss their performances under various scenarios from a connection setup delay point of view. From the simulation results, we show that of the four schemes, the ACQ scheme shows more stable performance to the <b>ported</b> <b>rate,</b> and its performance is not much affected by the system load. However, at a low <b>ported</b> <b>rate,</b> other schemes can be reasonably competitive, particularly, from the total routing delay's perspective, the OR scheme shows better performance, because it has less external links and less facilities; while with a lower <b>ported</b> <b>rate,</b> the QoR scheme is less relatively affected by its components' service rate.

Furthermore, it can seamlessly recover from isolated cell losses within the core switch, as well as detect the loss of a certain number of consecutive cells belonging to the same subconnection.

From the study, we argue that, even though the homogeneity of services provided by the Mobile Network Operators (MNO) in Ghana do not provide appropriate incentives to enable subscribers to port out of a network and thus the initial recorded lower <b>porting</b> <b>rate,</b> the threat of porting has led to improved competition among operators resulting in lower tariffs, better services and improved Quality of Service (QoS) of the networks.

40|$|Scenario-aware {{dataflow}} (SADF) is {{a prominent}} tool for modeling {{and analysis of}} dynamic em-bedded dataflow applications. In SADF the application is represented as a finite collection of syn-chronous dataflow (SDF) graphs, each of which represents one possible application behaviour or scenario. A finite state machine (FSM) specifies the possible orders of scenario occurrences. The SADF model renders the tightest possible performance guarantees, but is limited by its finiteness. This means that from a practical point of view, it can only handle dynamic dataflow applications that are characterized by a reasonably sized set of possible behaviours or scenarios. In this paper we remove this limitation for a class of SADF graphs by means of SADF model parametrization in terms of graph <b>port</b> <b>rates</b> and actor execution times.

Among various switching technologies, micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) has proven itself as the leading choice for realizing large port count OXC switch fabrics. Although much effort have been reported on the development of large port count MEMS-based switch fabric, the reliability of the OXC systems must also be carefully considered in order to achieve a survivable optical network. In this thesis, our studies on the reliability issues in MEMS-based large scale OXC system focus on two parts: 1) lifetime and operational economic of switch fabric for different switch fabric architectures, and 2) connection availability as a function of switch fabric's <b>port</b> failure <b>rate.</b> For the first part, we discussed the two major arrangements for an switch fabric, which are the monolithic switch fabric and the modular switch fabric, and we compare several important reliability parameters between the two arrangements, including the average number of replacements, the average number of forced service interrupts and the operational economic of OXC system over its service lifespan. Connection availability is then investigated for unprotected and protected OXC systems. It is shown that by employing the protection scheme, connection availability can be significantly enhanced even at relative high <b>port</b> failure <b>rate</b> (> 5, 000 FIT). Finally, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a highly scalable 1 : 1 protection switching scheme for enhancing connection availability in MEMS-based OXC systems.
