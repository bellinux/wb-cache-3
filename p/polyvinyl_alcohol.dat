25|$|A rubbery polymer {{sometimes}} called Slime, Flubber, 'gluep' or 'glurch' (or erroneously called Silly Putty, {{which is based}} on silicone polymers), can be made by cross-linking <b>polyvinyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> with borax. Making flubber from polyvinyl acetate-based glues, such as Elmer's Glue, and borax is a common elementary-science demonstration.|$|E
25|$|Because PET is an {{excellent}} water and moisture barrier material, plastic bottles made from PET are widely used for soft drinks (see carbonation). For certain specialty bottles, such as those designated for beer containment, PET sandwiches an additional <b>polyvinyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> (PVOH) layer to further reduce its oxygen permeability.|$|E
25|$|However, {{there are}} {{possible}} drawbacks of SIR technology, such as leaching of the extractant or clogging of a fixed bed by attrition of the particles. These might be remedied by choosing the proper particle-extractant-system. This implies selecting a suitable extractant with low water solubility, which is sufficiently retained inside the pores, and selecting mechanically stable particles as a solid {{support for the}} extractant. Additionally, SIRs can be stabilized by coating them, as shown by D. Muraviev et al. As coating material, A. W. Trochimczuk et al. used <b>polyvinyl</b> <b>alcohol.</b>|$|E
25|$|Vinyl acetate {{polymers}} include polyvinyl acetate, <b>polyvinyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> and polyvinyl acetal; {{all come}} from reaction products of vinyl acetate. Some forms of acetates {{are known to be}} acidic and will do damage to an object with direct contact. Additionally, polyvinyl acetate mixtures tend to degrade in storage and release acetic acid, which in some cases can corrode lead. This compound's coloring ranges from clear/white to a soft yellow. As it ages, it will change to a deeper yellow. It can have a similar appearance to rubber adhesives but the difference is that PVA turns white when comes into contact with water. Warm water and acetone are typically used as solvents.|$|E
25|$|Most {{banknotes}} {{are made}} from cotton paper with a weight of 80 to 90grams per square meter. The cotton is sometimes mixed with linen, abaca, or other textile fibres. Generally, the paper used is different from ordinary paper: {{it is much more}} resilient, resists wear and tear (the average life of a banknote is two years), and also does not contain the usual agents that make ordinary paper glow slightly under ultraviolet light. Unlike most printing and writing paper, banknote paper is infused with <b>polyvinyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> or gelatin, instead of water, to give it extra strength. Early Chinese banknotes were printed on paper made of mulberry bark. Mitsumata (Edgeworthia chrysantha) and other fibers are used in Japanese banknote paper (a kind of Washi).|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} {{is the process}} that was used when rescuing frescoes in La Fenice, a Venetian opera house, but the same process {{can be used for}} similarly damaged frescoes. First, a protection and support bandage of cotton gauze and <b>polyvinyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> is applied. Difficult sections are removed with soft brushes and localized vacuuming. The other areas that are easier to remove (because they had been damaged by less water) are removed with a paper pulp compress saturated with bicarbonate of ammonia solutions and removed with deionized water. These sections are strengthened and reattached then cleansed with base exchange resin compresses and the wall and pictorial layer were strengthened with barium hydrate. The cracks and detachments are stopped with lime putty and injected with an epoxy resin loaded with micronized silica.|$|E
25|$|Uterine artery {{embolization}} (UAE) is a {{minimally invasive}} procedure for treatment of uterine fibroids. Under local anesthesia a catheter is introduced into the femoral artery at the groin and advanced under radiographic control into the uterine arterty. A mass of microspheres or <b>polyvinyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> (PVA) material (an embolus) is injected into the uterine arteries in order to block {{the flow of blood}} through those vessels. The restriction in blood supply usually results in significant reduction of fibroids and improvement of heavy bleeding tendency. The 2012 Cochrane review comparing hysterectomy and UAE did not find any major advantage for either procedure. While UAE is associated with shorter hospital stay and a more rapid return to normal daily activities, it was also associated with a higher risk for minor complications later on. There were no differences between UAE and hysterectomy with regards to major complications.|$|E

2500|$|A Polaroid {{polarizing}} filter functions similarly on an atomic scale to the wire-grid polarizer. [...] It was originally made of microscopic herapathite crystals. [...] Its current H-sheet form {{is made from}} <b>polyvinyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> (PVA) plastic with an iodine doping. [...] Stretching of the sheet during manufacture causes the PVA chains to align in one particular direction. [...] Valence electrons from the iodine dopant are able to move linearly along the polymer chains, but not transverse to them. [...] So incident light polarized parallel to the chains is absorbed by the sheet; light polarized perpendicularly to the chains is transmitted. The durability and practicality of Polaroid makes it {{the most common type}} of polarizer in use, for example for sunglasses, photographic filters, and liquid crystal displays. It is also much cheaper than other types of polarizer.|$|E
