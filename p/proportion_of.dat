Caversham also has nearly twice the average Otago <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> one-parent families (26.5%). Ownership of and access to home telecommunications (such as the internet) and to private motor vehicles is considerably lower than the Otago average.|$|E
5|$|Quantification of the <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> barbarian-born {{troops in}} the 4th-century army is highly speculative. Elton has {{undertaken}} the most {{detailed analysis of the}} meagre evidence. According to this analysis, {{about a quarter of the}} sample of army officers was barbarian-born in the period 350–400. Analysis by decade shows that this proportion did not increase over the period, or indeed in the early 5th century. The latter trend implies that the <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> barbarians in the lower ranks was not much greater, otherwise the <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> barbarian officers would have increased over time to reflect that.|$|E

30|$|During 80  days of cultivation, two {{flush of}} the {{mushroom}} were harvested. Yield and BE of mushroom production varied in different substrates. The highest mushroom yield (359  g/ 300 dry substrate) and BE (119 %) {{were obtained from}} the 50 % <b>proportions</b> <b>of</b> ramie stalk medium; however, yield and BE were not significantly different from the 40 % <b>proportions</b> <b>of</b> ramie stalk medium or from 60 % <b>proportions</b> <b>of</b> ramie stalk medium. 70 % <b>proportions</b> <b>of</b> ramie stalk in cultivation substrates of F. velutipes resulted in low mushroom production. The lowest yield was observed in the 98 % <b>proportions</b> <b>of</b> ramie stalk medium. The results suggested that inclusion of ramie stalk is clearly advantageous for production of F. velutipes in proportions ranging 10 – 50 %, especially in 50 % ramie stalk combination.|$|R
40|$|Children {{are more}} {{resistant}} to gingivitis than are adults. To determine possible differences in their periodontal floras, an experimental gingivitis study, identical in design to one reported earlier with young adults, was conducted with four 4 - to 6 -year-old children. The incidence of sites that developed gingival index scores of 2 in children was less {{than one-third of the}} incidence observed in adults. The composition of the flora of each child was statistically significantly different from that of any other child or adult. The floras of the children as a group were statistically significantly {{different from those of the}} adults. Children had 3 -fold greater <b>proportions</b> <b>of</b> Leptotrichia species, 2. 5 -fold greater <b>proportions</b> <b>of</b> Capnocytophaga species, 2. 3 -fold greater <b>proportions</b> <b>of</b> Selenomonas species, 2 -fold greater <b>proportions</b> <b>of</b> bacterial species that require formate and fumarate, and 1. 5 -fold greater <b>proportions</b> <b>of</b> Bacteroides species. Adults had greater <b>proportions</b> <b>of</b> Fusobacterium, Eubacterium, and Lactobacillus species. Fusobacterium nucleatum, Actinomyces WVa 963, Selenomonas D 04, and Treponema socranskii were predominant species that correlated with increasing gingival index scores in both children and adults...|$|R

On comparison with {{peripheral blood}} lymphocytes, significantly decreased <b>proportions</b> <b>of</b> T-cells and significantly increased <b>proportions</b> <b>of</b> B-cells were found in lymph nodes draining areas of diseased bowel. No differences were seen in the <b>proportions</b> <b>of</b> T- and B-cells from lymph nodes taken from apparently healthy bowel of the Crohn's patients and of four control subjects without inflammatory bowel disease, though these were different from those in the peripheral blood in both the Crohn's patients and control subjects...|$|R
5|$|Agriculture in Wales has in {{the past}} been {{a major part of the}} economy of Wales, a largely rural country that forms part of the United Kingdom. Wales is mountainous and has a mild, wet climate. This results in only a small <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> the land area being {{suitable}} for arable cropping, but grass for the grazing of livestock is present in abundance. As a <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> the national economy, the importance of agriculture has become much reduced; a high <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> the population now live in the towns and cities in the south of the country and tourism has become an important form of income in the countryside and on the coast. Arable cropping is limited to the flatter parts and elsewhere dairying and livestock farming predominate.|$|E

The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute has estimated that Australia's defence spending in 2015 was the 13th highest of any country in real terms.

5|$|Despite the {{expansion}} {{in the number of}} positions available to women and other changes which aim to encourage increased female recruitment and retention, the growth in the <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> female permanent defence personnel has been slow. In the 1989–1990 financial year women made up 11.4% of the ADF personnel. In the 2008–2009 financial year women occupied 13.5% of ADF positions. During the same period the <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> civilian positions filled by women in the Australian Defence Organisation increased from 30.8% to 42.8%.

The <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> women in the permanent force differs by service: 12.1% of members of the Army are female, compared to 19.1% of the RAN and 19.2% for the RAAF. In 2015 the ADF adopted targets to increase the <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> service personnel who are female by 2023: by this time it is planned that women will make up 25% of the RAN, 15% of the Army and 25% of the RAAF.|$|E
