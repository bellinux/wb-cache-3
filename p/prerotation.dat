The performance of the proposed system is compared to that of a 16 -ary DEQAM system using an RF predistorter.

40|$|Rotating stall, a {{phenomenon}} that causes flow instabilities and pressure hysteresis by propagating at some fraction of the impeller rotational speed, can occur in centrifugal impellers, mixed impellers, radial diffusers, or axial diffusers.

We focus {{on a series of}} preoroclinal Devonian-Carboniferous fore-arc basin rocks, which are aligned parallel to the oroclinal structure, and by examining structural domains, we test whether or not the magnetic fabric is consistent with the strain axes.

40|$|Two {{different}} measuring methods {{relating to}} the swirl/prerotation flow measuring at the impeller entrance or in the intake pipe of the radial turbomachine (pump) are given in the contribution. The <b>prerotation</b> flow appearance is {{as a result of}} the interaction between relative flows in the impeller channels and created back flow at the impeller entrance aye when pump operating out of impeller design point (part load operating, by flow rates smaller than the optimal). The goal of our contribution is in adequate measuring method estimating, taking into account to measure the global flow swirl and not some local eddy swirl flows that could appear as a consequence of some local flow disturbance. Therefore, two measuring methods – multiblade (ASB) and single blade (ASSB) anemometer are introduced, analyzed and compared. ASSB has advantages in its simple construction, simple use and in what is most important in the fact that is the entrance flow less disturbed with comparison with multiblade ASB system. That is important when some other flow properties are examined during measuring at the same time, for example the entrance or exit flow field measuring at the impeller entrance or exit diameter, respectively.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{considers}} vector communications through multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channels {{with a set}} {{of quality}} of service (QoS) requirements for the simultaneously established substreams. Linear transmit-receive processing (also termed linear precoder at the transmitter and linear equalizer at the receiver) is designed to satisfy the QoS constraints with minimum transmitted power (the exact conditions under which the problem becomes unfeasible are given). Although the original problem is a complicated nonconvex problem with matrix-valued variables, with the aid of majorization theory, we reformulate it as a simple convex optimization problem with scalar variables. We then propose a practical and efficient multilevel water-filling algorithm to optimally solve the problem for the general case of different QoS requirements. The optimal transmit-receive processing is shown to diagonalize the channel matrix only after a very specific <b>prerotation</b> of the data symbols. For situations in which the resulting transmit power is too large, we give the precise way to relax the QoS constraints {{in order to reduce the}} required power based on a perturbation analysis. We also propose a robust design under channel estimation errors that has an important interest for practical systems. Numerical results from simulations are given to support the mathematical development of the problem.

40|$|Lecturepg. 57 The {{designer}} of the centrifugal pump impellers requires knowledge of the velocity flow field entering the impeller for several reasons. These include an assurance that a reasonably uniform field exists, that the leading edge vane angles are matched to the flow field, and {{that the amount of}} <b>prerotation</b> affects the pump head. Some velocity distributions resulting from various inlet configurations can be calculated by various techniques. However, since these techniques assume mostly axisymmetric, nonviscous flow under ideal conditions, the real velocity distribution caused by side inlets truly remains unknown until an experimental program is instituted to probe the flow field and quantitatively describe the velocity distribution. The experimental technique of determining entrance flow fields of pumps having side inlets as opposed to axial inlets is described in this paper. The procedure of building models of the flow path preceding the impeller and testing these models with air as the working fluid is discussed. A description of how the flow field is probed with three-dimensional velocity probes to quantitatively ?map out? the full 360 degrees velocity flow field, as well as flow visualization procedures to qualitatively give insight into the flow patterns is described in detail.

40|$|International audienceHumans can remarkably adapt their motor {{behavior}} to novel environmental conditions, yet {{it remains unclear}} which factors enable us to transfer {{what we have learned}} with one limb to the other. Here we tested the hypothesis that interlimb transfer of sensorimotor adaptation is determined by environmental conditions but also by individual characteristics. We specifically examined the adaptation of unconstrained reaching movements to a novel Coriolis, velocity-dependent force field. Right-handed subjects sat {{at the center of a}} rotating platform and performed forward reaching movements with the upper limb toward flashed visual targets in <b>prerotation,</b> per-rotation (i. e., adaptation), and post- rotation tests. Here only the dominant arm was used during adaptation and interlimb transfer was assessed by comparing performance of the nondominant arm before and after dominant-arm adaptation. Vision and no-vision conditions did not significantly influence interlimb transfer of trajectory adaptation, which on average was significant but limited. We uncovered a substantial heterogeneity of interlimb transfer across subjects and found that interlimb transfer can be qualitatively and quantitatively predicted for each healthy young individual. A classifier showed that in our study, interlimb transfer could be predicted based on the subject's task performance, most notably motor variability during learning, and his or her laterality quotient. Positive correlations suggested that variability of motor performance and lateralization of arm movement control facilitate interlimb transfer. We further show that these individual characteristics can predict the presence and the magnitude of interlimb transfer of left-handers. Overall, this study suggests that individual characteristics shape the way the nervous system can generalize motor learning...|$|E
40|$|Planning {{of object}} {{manipulations}} {{is dependent on}} the ability to generate, store, and retrieve sensorimotor memories of previous actions associated with grasped objects. However, the sensorimotor memory representations linking object properties to the planning of grasp are not well understood. Here we use an object rotation task to gain insight into the mechanisms underlying the nature of these sensorimotor memories. We asked subjects to grasp a grip device with an asymmetrical center of mass (CM) anywhere on its vertical surfaces and lift it while minimizing object roll. After subjects learned to minimize object roll by generating a compensatory moment, they were asked to rotate the object 180 ° about a vertical axis and lift it again. The rotation resulted in changing the direction of external moment opposite to that experienced during the <b>prerotation</b> block. Anticipatory grasp control was quantified by measuring the compensatory moment generated at object lift onset by thumb and index finger forces through their respective application points. On the first postrotation trial, subjects failed to generate a compensatory moment to counter the external moment caused by the new CM location, thus resulting in a large object roll. Nevertheless, after several object rotations subjects reduced object roll on the initial postrotation trials by anticipating the new CM location through the modulation of digit placement but not tangential forces. The differential improvement in modulating these two variables supports the notion of independent memory representations of kinematics and kinetics and is discussed in relation to neural mechanisms underlying visuomotor transformations...|$|E
40|$|Power {{amplifiers}} (PAs) for microwave communications {{are generally}} the most power-hungry {{element of a}} transmitter. High linearity is required for modern digital communications standards, and often is achieved {{at the expense of}} efficiency. Outphasing architectures, which combine multiple nonlinear but efficient switching PAs into a system with an overall linear response, represent a promising strategy for breaking the efficiency/linearity tradeoff inherent to conventional PAs. This work explores methods for efficient PA design using outphasing techniques. Two aspects of outphasing design are considered. First, a wide-band phase modulator is introduced that uses a single current-steering digital to analog converter (DAC) structure and discrete clock <b>prerotation.</b> This topology takes advantage of specifications particular to outphasing architectures to reduce matching requirements as compared to a two-DAC phase modulator while providing wideband capability. The phase modulator is demonstrated in 65 -nm CMOS, operates over a carrier frequency range of 1. 2 - 4. 2 GHz and has a 12 -bit phase resolution and sample rate of 160 MSamples/second. The second technique is a novel four-way lossless power combiner and outphasing system which provides ideally lossless power combining along with resistive loading of switching power amplifiers over a wide output range. This work presents the first-ever demonstration of this system at microwave frequencies. Particular attention is paid to the microwave-specific aspects of implementation. A 60 -W GaN prototype demonstrates the outphasing and dynamic performance, which closely matches the expected performance despite the challenges of operating at microwave frequencies. by Taylor Wallis Barton.

40|$|Graduation date: 1976 One of {{the unique}} {{problems}} associated with salmon gillnet fishing is of preventing the fouling of the boat's propeller in the net and associated fishing gear. Presently, {{the solution to this}} problem has been the addition of a basket type propeller guard which may produce a drag increase of 50 percent on small planing boats. Recognizing the need for a greater understanding of the interrelationship of boat drag and engine power to the effect of propeller selection and propeller guard design, this study analytically models planing boat power performance including the experimentally determined effects of nozzle type propeller guard design. The model predicts the drag forces acting on a prismatic planing hull and existing data on marine propeller performance is incorporated in the model such that the propeller shaft speed and shaft power for a particular boat propeller combination can be predicted. The model will also optimize propeller diameter. Three variations of nozzle type propeller guards were tested on a 16 ft. planing boat. The guards were a commercially produced outboard motor propeller weed guard, a short (1 /D = 0. 275) flow accelerating nozzle and the nozzle equipped with <b>prerotation</b> vanes. Computer modeling the effect of the three nozzle guards on the performance of a hypothetical 11500 lb. planing boat with a 265 Hp engine predicted that the top speed of the boat (with an optimum diameter propeller) would be 34. 6 knots, with the weed guard 25. 5 knots (a speed loss of 26 percent), with the flow accelerating nozzle 32. 3 knots (seven percent loss) and the nozzle with vanes 27. 4 knots (21 percent loss). The validity of the model is demonstrated by a comparison of the predicted values of propeller shaft speed and boat top speed, with an open propeller and the weed guard, to the actual values observed in operation of the 16 ft. test boat. Shaft speed predictions were within five percent and boat top speed predictions were within about ten percent of actual observations...|$|E
40|$|When {{reaching}} {{movements are}} made during passive constant velocity body rotation, inertial Coriolis accelerations are generated that displace both movement paths and endpoints in their direction. These findings directly contradict equilibrium point theories of movement control. However, {{it has been}} argued that these movement errors relate to subjects sensing their body rotation through continuing vestibular activity and making corrective movements. In the present study, we evaluated the reaching movements of five labyrinthine-defective subjects (lacking both semicircular canal and otolith function) who cannot sense passive body rotation in the dark and five age-matched, normal control subjects. Each pointed 40 times in complete darkness to the location of a just extinguished visual target before, during, and after constant velocity rotation at 10 rpm in the center of a fully enclosed slow rotation room. All subjects, including the normal controls, always felt completely stationary when making their movements. During rotation, both groups initially showed large deviations of their movement paths and endpoints in the direction of the transient Coriolis forces generated by their movements. With additional per-rotation movements, both groups showed complete adaptation of movement curvature (restoration of straight-line reaches) during rotation. The labyrinthine-defective subjects, however, failed to regain fully accurate movement endpoints after 40 reaches, unlike the control subjects who did so within 11 reaches. Postrotation, both groups' movements initially had mirror image curvatures to their initial per-rotation reaches; the endpoint aftereffects were significantly different from <b>prerotation</b> baseline for the control subjects but not for the labyrinthine-defective subjects reflecting the smaller amount of endpoint adaptation they achieved during rotation. The labyrinthine-defective subjects' movements had significantly lower peak velocity, higher peak elevation, lower terminal velocity, and a more vertical touchdown than those of the control subjects. Thus the way their reaches terminated denied them the somatosensory contact cues necessary for full endpoint adaptation. These findings fully contradict equilibrium point theories of movement control. They emphasize the importance of contact cues in adaptive movement control and indicate that movement errors generated by Coriolis perturbations of limb movements reveal characteristics of motor planning and adaptation in both healthy and clinical populations...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To compare three {{different}} evaluative instruments and determine which {{is able to}} measure different aspects of medical student learning. Design: Student learning was evaluated by using written examinations, objective structured clinical examination, and patient simulator that used two clinical scenarios before and after a structured critical care elective, by using a crossover design. Participation: Twenty-four 4 th-yr {{students enrolled in the}} critical care medicine elective. Interventions: All students took a multiple-choice written examination; evaluated a live simulated critically ill patient, requested data from a nurse, and intervened as appropriate at different stations (objective structured clinical examination); and evaluated the computer-controlled patient simulator and intervened as appropriate. Measurements and Main Results: Students' knowledge was assessed by using a multiple-choice examination containing the same data incorporated into the other examinations. Student performance on the objective structured clinical examination was evaluated at five stations. Both objective structured clinical examination and simulator tests were videotaped for subsequent scores of responses, quality of responses, and response time. The videotapes were reviewed for specific behaviors by faculty masked to time of examination. Students were expected to perform the following: a) assess airway, breathing, and circulation; b) prepare a mannequin for intubation; c) provide appropriate ventilator settings; d) manage hypotension; and e) request, interpret, and provide appropriate intervention for pulmonary artery catheter data. Students were expected to perform identical behaviors during the simulator examination; however, the entire examination was performed on the whole-body computer-controlled mannequin. The primary outcome measure was the difference in examination scores before and after the rotation. The mean preelective scores were 77 ± 16 %, 47 ± 15 %, and 41 ± 14 % for the written examination, objective structured clinical examination, and simulator, respectively, compared with 89 ± 11 %, 76 ± 12 %, and 62 ± 15 % after the elective (p <. 0001). <b>Prerotation</b> scores for the written examination were significantly higher than the objective structured clinical examination or the simulator; postrotation scores were highest for the written examination and lowest for the simulator. Conclusion: Written examinations measure acquisition of knowledge but fail to predict if students can apply knowledge to problem solving, whereas both the objective structured clinical examination and the computer-controlled patient simulator can be used as effective performance evaluation tools...|$|E
40|$|Under {{the present}} effort an {{experiment}} rig has been constructed, an instrumentation package developed {{and a series}} of mean and rms velocity and pressure measurements made in a turbopump which modelled the first stage of the Space Shuttle Main Engine (SSME) High Pressure Fuel Turbopump. The rig was designed so as to allow initial experiments with a single configuration consisting of a bell-mouth inlet, a flight impeller, a vaneless diffuser and a volute. Allowance was made for components such as inlet guide vanes, exit guide vanes, downstream pumps, etc. to be added in future experiments. This flexibility will provide a clear baseline set of experiments and allow evaluation in later experiments of the effect of adding specific components upon the pump performance properties. The rotational speed of the impeller was varied between 4260 and 7680 rpm which covered the range of scaled SSME rotation speeds when due allowance is made for the differing stagnation temperature, model to full scale. The results at the inlet obtained with rotational speeds of 4260, 6084 and 7680 rpm showed that the axial velocity at the bell-mouth inlet remained roughly constant at 2. 2 of the bulk velocity at the exit of the turbopump {{near the center of the}} inlet, but it decreased rapidly with increasing radius at all three speeds. Reverse flow occurred at a radius greater than 0. 9 R for all three speeds and the maximum negative velocity reduced from 1. 3 of the bulk velocity at the exit of the turbopump at 4260 rpm to 0. 35 at 7680 rpm, suggesting that operating at a speed closer to the design condition of 8700 rpm improved the inlet characteristics. The reverse flow caused positive <b>prerotation</b> at the impeller inlet which was negligibly small near the center but reached 0. 7 of the impeller speed at the outer annulus. The results in the diffuser and the volute obtained at 7680 rpm show that the hub and shroud walls of the diffuser were characterized by regions of transient reverse flow with negative revolution-averaged velocity of 8 percent of the maximum forward revolution-averaged velocity at the center of the diffuser passage near the shroud wall...|$|E
