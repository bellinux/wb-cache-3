5|$|Fame {{does not}} last, however. Nestor {{is not as}} ambitious as his brother and desires {{nothing more than to}} own his own small club. He is in love with Delores, but lacks the passion he felt for his beloved Maria back home. Cesar, meantime, {{suppresses}} his true feelings, that a woman like Delores would actually be <b>perfect</b> <b>for</b> him. Cesar eventually reveals to Nestor that Maria left him for a Cuban mobster in exchange for cancelling a contract hit against Nestor.|$|E

The factory would create 700 jobs and up to 1,500 further jobs in the supply chain if built. He has said the site would be <b>perfect</b> <b>for</b> the factory because of its close proximity to NaREC and the site's existing deep dock facilities. The factory {{is likely to be}} built either in Blyth or on Humberside.|$|E
5|$|Nearly a {{year after}} the events of the movie, Elsa throws a {{birthday}} for Anna. However Anna discovers, through Elsa's continuous sneezing that Elsa has caught a cold. Despite trying to make the party <b>perfect</b> <b>for</b> her sister, Elsa's sneezes create tiny snowmen which try to take the cake for themselves, and she nearly falls off the clocktower due to her condition. Afterwards Anna takes Elsa to rest and feeds her soup, while Kristoff, Sven, and Olaf help transport the snowmen to Elsa's ice palace in the mountains.|$|E
5|$|Pre-production for Ruma Maida {{took three}} months. The {{characters}} were written without any particular actors in mind. Atiqah Hasiholan, {{who had previously}} starred in the Academy Award-submitted Jamila dan Sang Presiden (Jamila and the President, 2009), was cast as Maida. Yama Carlos, who played Sakera, was initially cast for another role but received the leading male role after a last-minute switch. The actor cast as Muchlisin, Frans Tumbuan, {{was the only one}} auditioned as Soeriaatmadja thought the role was <b>perfect</b> <b>for</b> him. Soeriaatmadja later recalled that, including extras, Ruma Maida had the largest cast of any film he had made to that point.|$|E

5|$|The Greek {{practice}} of grafting of their gods' names onto the planets {{was almost certainly}} borrowed from the Babylonians. The Babylonians named Phosphoros after their goddess of love, Ishtar; Pyroeis after their god of war, Nergal, Stilbon after their god of wisdom Nabu, and Phaethon after their chief god, Marduk. There are too many concordances between Greek and Babylonian naming conventions {{for them to have}} arisen separately. The translation was not <b>perfect.</b> <b>For</b> instance, the Babylonian Nergal was a god of war, and thus the Greeks identified him with Ares. Unlike Ares, Nergal was also god of pestilence and the underworld.|$|E
5|$|The {{album was}} {{recorded}} in three parts. First, Anderson recorded the music for Ashen. This was done in a wooden loft {{in the corner of}} the rehearsal space used by Azrael, of whom Anderson was, at the time, a member. Anderson has said that he does not remember how long this recording took him, as he slept there after finishing the work. He described that space as <b>perfect</b> <b>for</b> the recording, as there was nothing there to distract him.|$|E

5|$|Armand Assante and Antonio Banderas were Glimcher's ideal {{choices for}} the roles of Cesar and Nestor Castillo. Prior to The Mambo Kings, Assante had {{appeared}} {{in a number of}} films but had not yet broken out as a major star. Banderas, a Spanish actor, had moved to Los Angeles, California, hoping to make an international debut with his first English speaking role. Warner Bros., however, wanted to cast Jeremy Irons as Cesar and Ray Liotta as Nestor. Both actors had received critical acclaim for their performances in Reversal of Fortune and Goodfellas respectively, and the studio felt that they would appeal to a wider audience. Through a translator, Glimcher told Banderas to work on improving his English for one month before performing a screen test opposite Irons. The Spanish actor, lacking the ability to speak English, learned his lines phonetically. Despite Irons's excellent screen test, Glimcher thought he was wrong for the part and insisted on Assante; he thought the charm and seductiveness of Assante made him <b>perfect</b> <b>for</b> the role, and the studio eventually gave in.|$|E
5|$|At a party {{hosted by}} her mother, Lansbury met John van Druten, who had {{recently}} co-authored a script for Gaslight (1944), a mystery-thriller based on Patrick Hamilton's 1938 play, Gas Light. Set in Victorian London, the film was being directed by George Cukor, and starred Ingrid Bergman in the lead role of Paula Alquist, a woman being psychologically tormented by her husband. Van Druten suggested that Lansbury would be <b>perfect</b> <b>for</b> the role of Nancy Oliver, a conniving cockney maid; she was accepted for the part, although, since she was only 17, a social worker had to accompany her on the set. Obtaining an agent, Earl Kramer, she was signed to a seven-year contract with MGM, earning $500 a week and using her real name as her professional name. Upon release, Gaslight received mixed critical reviews, although Lansbury's role was widely praised; the film earned six Academy Award nominations, including one for Best Supporting Actress for Lansbury.|$|E
5|$|At first, {{the game}} was planned to be {{released}} for the Game Boy Color, but after the development team were shown the Game Boy Advance system's screen and footage of Mega Man Battle Network, Takumi felt that the Game Boy Advance would be <b>perfect</b> <b>for</b> Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney. The game {{was designed to be}} simple, as Takumi wanted it to be easy enough for even his mother to play. As it was less common at the time to use professional voice actors, the game's voice clips were provided by the development team: each staff member recorded every sample that was needed for the game, and then the best ones were used. Takumi used his privilege as a director to cast himself as Phoenix, however, while Edgeworth was voiced by Iwamoto, and von Karma by Sugimori.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} zero-error Slepian-Wolf coding for {{a special}} kind of correlated sources known as Hamming sources. Moreover, we focus on the design of codes with minimum redundancy (i. e., perfect codes). As shown in a prior work by Koulgi et al., the design of a <b>perfect</b> code <b>for</b> a general source is very difficult and in fact is NP-hard. In our recent work, we introduce a subset of <b>perfect</b> codes <b>for</b> Hamming sources known as Hamming Codes for Multiple Sources (HCMSs). In this work, we extend HCMSs to generalized HCMSs, which can be proved to include all <b>perfect</b> codes <b>for</b> Hamming sources. To prove our main result, we first show that any <b>perfect</b> code <b>for</b> a Hamming source with two terminals is equivalent to a Hamming code for asymmetric Slepian Wolf coding (c. f. Lemma 2). We then show that any multi-terminal (of more than two terminals) perfect code can be transformed to a <b>perfect</b> code <b>for</b> two terminals (c. f. Lemma 3) and to a perfect code with an asymmetric form (c. f. Lemma 4). Equipped with these results, we prove that every <b>perfect</b> Slepian-Wolf code <b>for</b> Hamming sources is equivalent to a generalized HCMS...|$|R

5|$|Bart and Milhouse {{convince}} Comic Book Guy {{to publish}} a comic book he wrote titled Everyman, in which the title character can absorb superpowers from the characters of comic book he touches. The comic becomes an instant hit, and many Hollywood studios become interested in making it into a movie. Comic Book Guy agrees to let Everyman become a movie, but only if he can pick the star. When Comic Book Guy sees Homer, he considers Homer <b>perfect</b> <b>for</b> the role, as he wants Everyman to be played by a middle-aged fat man. But the studio executives realize that audiences want a physically fit actor for the role, so they hire celebrity fitness trainer Lyle McCarthy to get Homer into shape. After a month, Homer becomes fit and the movie begins production.|$|E
5|$|Donaggio had no {{interest}} in making soundtracks for films at the time, but was introduced to Nicolas Roeg who decided to try him out and asked him to write something for the beginning of the film. Roeg was enthusiastic about the result but the London-based producers were resistant to hiring someone who had no background in films. The film's financiers were pleased with Donaggio's work and overruled the producers. As well as composing the score, Donaggio performed a substantial portion of it himself. The piano pieces were performed by Donaggio, {{despite the fact that he}} was not very accomplished at playing the piano. The piano pieces are usually associated with Christine in the film, and Roeg wanted them to have an innocent sound reminiscent of a little girl learning to play the piano. Donaggio claims that since he was not very good at playing the piano, the pieces had an unsure style to them, <b>perfect</b> <b>for</b> the effect they were trying to capture.|$|E
5|$|Dowding {{later wrote}} a memo {{considering}} several aircraft for the role, rejecting the Boulton Paul Defiant two-seat fighter {{due to its}} cramped rear turret area. He was sure the Bristol Beaufighter would be <b>perfect</b> <b>for</b> the role, {{but it would not}} be ready for some time. So he selected the Bristol Blenheim light bomber for the immediate term, sending two of the early prototypes to Martlesham Heath to be fitted with the radar from the Battles. Blenheim K7033 was fitted with the radar, while K7034 acted as the target. Both of these aircraft lost a propeller in flight but landed safely; K7033s propeller was never found, but K7034s was returned to Martlesham the next day by an irate farmer.|$|E

The Zeus site, known as the Kwajalein Test Site, was officially established on 1 October 1960.

The site took up a considerable amount of the empty land to {{the north side of the}} airfield. The launchers were located on the far southwestern corner of the island, with the Target Tracking Radars, Missile Tracking Radars (MTRs) and various control sites and generators running along the northern side of the airfield. The ZAR transmitter and receiver were some distance away, off the northeastern edge of the airfield.|$|E

I thought, 'The Great Seal of the President of the United States' would be <b>perfect</b> <b>for</b> the Ramones, with the eagle holding arrows—to symbolize strength and the aggression {{that would be used}} against whomever dares to attack us—and an olive branch, offered to those who want to be friendly. But we decided to change it a little bit. Instead of the olive branch, we had an apple tree branch, since the Ramones were American as apple pie. And since Johnny was such a baseball fanatic, we had the eagle hold a baseball bat instead of the 's arrows.|$|E

At the table-read for this episode, they had not cast the part yet and Daniels had Wilmore read for the role to fill in. After the read, producer Greg Daniels thought he was <b>perfect</b> <b>for</b> the role. However, because of stipulations with the Screen Actors Guild, producers still had to have Wilmore formally audition with other actors for the role. Daniels was also not sure where to use Mindy Kaling on screen in the series until the point came in this episode's script when Michael needed to be slapped by a minority. Her character in this episode, however, is far from the bubbly, chatty character that Kelly later becomes.|$|E
