40|$|Introduction. Start {{with the}} {{following}} elegant interval packing (IP) problem. Let random subintervals arrive at a service facility in a rate- Poisson stream; a random subinterval is simply the interval between two independent uniform random draws from [0; 1]. Place an arrival at time t immediately into service if it is disjoint {{from each of the}} subintervals, if any, being served at time t; otherwise, place it into a queue. When a subinterval completes service, at time t say, scan the queue in arrival order, <b>placing</b> <b>into</b> <b>service</b> each subinterval encountered that is disjoint from all subintervals already accepted for service at time t. Determine the stability condition under the assumption that service times are independent unit-mean exponentials. A little reflection shows that, since the midpoint 1 = 2 is the most "congested" point of [0...|$|E
40|$|An Orion Crew Module Service Module Structural Weight and Center of Gravity Simulator and a Vehicle Motion Simulator Hoist Structure for Orion Service Module Umbilical Testing were {{designed}} during a summer 2014 internship in Kennedy Space Centers Structures and Mechanisms Design Branch. The simulator is {{a structure that}} supports ballast, which will be integrated into an existing Orion mock-up to simulate the mass properties of the Exploration Mission- 1 flight vehicle in both fueled and unfueled states. The simulator mimics these configurations {{through the use of}} approximately 40, 000 lbf of steel and water ballast, and a steel support structure. Draining four water tanks, which house the water ballast, transitions the simulator from the fueled to unfueled mass properties. The Ground Systems Development and Operations organization will utilize the simulator to verify and validate equipment used to maneuver and transport the Orion spacecraft in its fueled and unfueled configurations. The second design comprises a cantilevered tripod hoist structure that provides the capability to position a large Orion Service Module Umbilical in proximity to the Vehicle Motion Simulator. The Ground Systems Development and Operations organization will utilize the Vehicle Motion Simulator, with the hoist structure attached, to test the Orion Service Module Umbilical for proper operation prior to installation on the Mobile Launcher. Overall, these two designs provide NASA engineers viable concepts worthy of fabricating and <b>placing</b> <b>into</b> <b>service</b> to prepare for the launch of Orion in 2017...|$|E

5000|$|An {{applicable}} convention, {{as presented}} in [...] of the United States Internal Revenue Code, is an assumption about when property is <b>placed</b> <b>into</b> <b>service.</b> It {{is used to}} determine when property depreciation begins. The purpose of applicable conventions is to simplify depreciation {{because they do not}} require a taxpayer to prove to the IRS when every piece of depreciable property was <b>placed</b> <b>into</b> <b>service.</b>|$|R
5000|$|There {{are three}} types of conventions. The first, the “half-year convention,” assumes that all {{property}} <b>placed</b> <b>into</b> <b>service,</b> or disposed of, during a taxable year was <b>placed</b> <b>into</b> <b>service,</b> or disposed of, at the midpoint of that year. (§ 168(d)(4)(A)) Section 168(d)(1) states that all taxpayers should use the half-year convention unless a different convention is specifically required by § 168(d)(2) or § 168(d)(3).|$|R

5000|$|For taxpayers, the half-year {{convention}} {{does not}} require knowledge or proof of the date on which depreciable property is placed in service. Depreciable property {{is assumed to be}} <b>placed</b> <b>into</b> <b>service</b> on July 1 of the year in which it is <b>placed</b> <b>into</b> <b>service.</b> The Internal Revenue Service is fond of the rule because without it, taxpayers would be tempted to buy property {{in the second half of}} the year and claim full depreciation deductions as if the property were used for the entire year. Taxpayers like the rule because it {{does not require}} them to keep track of or prove exactly when depreciable property was <b>placed</b> <b>into</b> <b>service.</b> Nonetheless, the IRS is wary of abuse of the half-year convention. Under § 168(d)(3) of the Federal Income Tax Code, if a taxpayer purchases a lot of depreciable assets in the last three months of the taxable year, they may be forced to use the less beneficial [...] "mid-quarter convention". This convention treats such property as <b>placed</b> <b>into</b> <b>service</b> in the midpoint of the last quarter of the taxable year. See § 168(d)(4)(c).|$|R
