50|$|The Sciara or Moscia Calabrese is an {{indigenous}} breed of domestic sheep from the <b>provinces</b> <b>of</b> <b>Catanzaro</b> and Cosenza, in Calabria in southern Italy.

50|$|Today Magliocco Dolce {{is found}} almost {{exclusively}} in Calabria though {{the exact number of}} plantings of the grape variety is hard to determine because for many years the grape was often confused and inter-planted in field blends with other varieties. Even in the official 2000 census, plantings of Magliocco Canino and Magliocco Dolce were counted together though ampelographers believe that most of the Calabrian plantings in the <b>provinces</b> <b>of</b> <b>Catanzaro,</b> Cosenza and Crotone of the 616 acres reported are Magliocco Dolce.|$|R

5000|$|The Rustica di Calabria or Sciara is an {{indigenous}} breed of domestic goat from Calabria in southern Italy. It is raised {{mostly in the}} <b>provinces</b> <b>of</b> <b>Catanzaro</b> and Cosenza. Although present in substantial numbers it has been little studied; its conservation status and origins remain unclear. It may {{have been influenced by}} the various goat breeds, including the Abyssinian goat, the Maltese and a type known as [...] "Tibetan", whose introduction to Calabria {{in the early twentieth century}} is documented.|$|R
5000|$|The Apulo-Calabrese is {{particularly}} {{associated with the}} <b>provinces</b> <b>of</b> <b>Catanzaro,</b> Cosenza and Reggio di Calabria, and with the area of Lagonegro in the <b>province</b> <b>of</b> Potenza. In the early 20th century, local sub-types from these areas were known as the Catanzarese, the Cosentina, the Reggitana and the Lagonegrese respectively; these types are now considered extinct. The Calabrese was the principal pig of the region; in the mid-1920s the population was recorded as 131,736. Numbers fell drastically after the Second World War, and in particular from the 1970s, following the introduction of faster-growing foreign breeds such as the British Yorkshire.|$|R
2500|$|The name Italia {{originally}} {{applied only}} to {{a part of what}} is now Southern Italy – according to Antiochus of Syracuse, the southern portion of the Bruttium peninsula (modern Calabria: <b>province</b> <b>of</b> Reggio, and part <b>of</b> the <b>provinces</b> <b>of</b> <b>Catanzaro</b> and Vibo Valentia). But by his time Oenotria and Italy had become synonymous, and the name also applied to most of Lucania as well. The Greeks gradually came to apply the name [...] "Italia" [...] to a larger region, but it was during the reign of Emperor Augustus (end of the 1st century BC) that the term was expanded to cover the entire peninsula until the Alps.|$|R

40|$|An endemic goiter {{study was}} carried out in a vast {{territory}} of the Calabria region, including the <b>provinces</b> <b>of</b> <b>Catanzaro</b> and Cosenza. About 50 % of 7231 school-children, aged between 6 and 12 years, examined in 34 villages, presented a thyroid enlargement. The high prevalence of goiter seems to be related to a moderate iodine deficiency intake indicated by a mild urinary iodine excretion (lower than 100 micrograms/g creatinine). In a few villages, in which a two year voluntary iodine prophylaxis {{was carried out}}, an increase in the urinary iodine excretion with a decreased goiter prevalence was observed. A slight increase in TT 3, FT 3 and TSH in one endemic area studied, compared to the control area, was also observed. These data suggest that an effective program of iodoprophylaxis is fundamental in this region as well...|$|R
5000|$|The first {{mention of}} a [...] "Magliocca" [...] grape dates to the late 15th century when it was {{documented}} growing in the Calabria region. However, which [...] "Magliocco" [...] grape this was is not yet known. Ampelographers have speculated that since the name Magliocco means [...] "tender knot" [...] in Greek that potentially Magliocco Dolce (or Magliocco Canino) could have originated in Greece. Additionally, Magliocco Dolce has been known under the synonym of Greco nero around the village of Lamezia Terme. However, DNA evidence in the early 21st century has {{cast doubt on the}} validity of that theory with it being far more likely that both grapes originated in southern Italy. The early synonym Arvino suggest that potentially Magliocco Dolce originated near Lago Arvo on the La Sila plateau that straddles the borders <b>of</b> the <b>provinces</b> <b>of</b> <b>Catanzaro,</b> Cosenza and Crotone in Calabria.|$|R

5000|$|The best {{available}} knowledge regarding {{the history of}} San Pietro Apostolo [...] indicates that it was founded by peasants who fled from Motta Santa Lucia after the earthquake of 1638. Moving to the interior, they asked asylum of Prince Cigala of Tiriolo, who allowed them to settle in the area which is today known as [...] "Colla Pagliara", {{in exchange for the}} payment of a modest head tax. They subsequently moved to a lower area which was more sheltered from the wind. It is said that a small statue of the apostle St. Peter was erected in these regions, and that the village was named accordingly. San Pietro Apostolo was administered by its neighbor Tiriolo {{until the end of the}} 18th century when it obtained its autonomy under law No. 14 of 19 January 1807. It was elevated to the status of a comune with the name of 'San Pietro a Tiriolo' and placed under the jurisdiction of what was then called Calabria Ulteriore, which consisted <b>of</b> the current <b>provinces</b> <b>of</b> <b>Catanzaro,</b> Crotone, Reggio Calabria and Vibo Valentia. On 4 May 1811 the comune was given the name of San Pietro Apostolo, attesting its separation from Tiriolo which remained, however, the administrative seat. Law No. 360 of 1 May 1816 transferred the village of San Pietro Apostolo with its 1992 inhabitants from the administration of Tiriolo to that of Gimigliano, and from the <b>province</b> <b>of</b> Calabria Ultra to the new <b>province</b> <b>of</b> Calabria Ultra Seconda (Catanzaro).|$|R
