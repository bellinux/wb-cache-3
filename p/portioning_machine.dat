Therefore the technique is best exploited when applied to encode the instruction set of core processors and microcontrollers, since components of these types are commonly used to execute fixed <b>portions</b> of <b>machine</b> code within embedded systems.

50|$|Magnetic {{particles}} (very {{similar to}} iron filings) {{are located in}} the powder cavity. When electricity is applied to the coil, the resulting magnetic flux tries to bind the particles together, almost like a magnetic particle slush. As the electric current is increased, the binding of the particles becomes stronger. The brake rotor passes through these bound particles. The output of the housing is rigidly attached to some <b>portion</b> of the <b>machine.</b> As the particles start to bind together, a resistant force is created on the rotor, slowing, and eventually stopping the output shaft.|$|R
40|$|Electrical energy {{consumption}} forms 99 % {{of the environmental}} impact of machining operations. Whilst replacing existing machineries for more energy efficient ones does not deem possible in short term, process planning for machining with {{energy consumption}} in mind is a more accessible solution. The effect of cutting parameters on power consumption in CNC milling of 6082 T 6 aluminum alloy was investigated in this paper. Mathematical models were developed to estimate the energy and power consumption in CNC milling machines. The analysis indicated that the two less studied parameters of axial and radial depth of cut have significant impact on the total energy consumption of machining processes. Increased axial and radial depth of cut not only increase material removal rate but also increase the <b>portion</b> of <b>machine</b> tool’s power consumption dedicated to material cutting. This study indicated that 82 % reduction in energy consumption can be achieved through precise selection of cutting parameters...|$|R

This was particularly useful when implementing a best two-out-of-three, a common logic circuit used in binary adders. Another possibility {{is to use the}} same core as the switching element in several different <b>portions</b> of the <b>machines</b> logic.

40|$|The {{radio-frequency}} (RF) {{system is}} the key element that generates electric fields for beam acceleration. To keep the system reliable, a highly sophisticated protection scheme is required, which also should be designed to ensure a good balance between beam availability and machine safety. Since RF systems are complex, incorporating high-voltage and high-power equipment, a good <b>portion</b> of <b>machine</b> downtime typically comes from RF systems. Equipment and component damage in RF systems results in long and expensive repairs. Protection of RF system hardware {{is one of the}} oldest machine protection concepts, dealing with the protection of individual high-power RF equipment from breakdowns. As beam power increases in modern accelerators, the protection of accelerating structures from beam-induced faults also becomes a critical aspect of protection schemes. In this article, an overview of the RF system is given, and selected topics of failure mechanisms and examples of protection requirements are introduced.

The NSNS is a fast pulse neutron source that would consist of a 1000 MeV H- linac, an accumulator ring, a neutron target, and an experimental area. Although the NSNS is to be built at Oak Ridge, the design responsibility is delegated to five US national laboratories, and the Los Alamos National Laboratory {{is responsible for the}} linac <b>portion</b> of this <b>machine,</b> from the output of the radio frequency quadrupole (RFQ) accelerator, to the entrance to the accumulator ring. In the baseline design, a total of fifty-nine klystrons are used to provide the rf power for a 1 -MW average power beam in the accumulator ring, and a 1. 04 ms pulse length, 6. 24 % duty factor beam in the linac. The frequencies chosen are 402. 5 MHz for the RFQ and drift tube linac (DTL) <b>portions</b> of the <b>machine,</b> and 805 MHz for the coupled-cavity DTL (CCDTL) and coupled cavity (CCL) portions of the linac. The baseline 805 MHz klystron is capable of 2. 5 -MW peak power into a flat load, and it contains a modulating anode. The backup 805 MHz klystron is cathode pulsed, and has a 5 -MW peak output power. The modulators for these two klystrons are vastly different. The challenges and compromises for the two klystrons and their associated modulators and RF systems are discussed.

40|$|Vibration {{and wear}} debris {{analyses}} {{are the two}} main conditions monitoring techniques for machinery maintenance and fault diagnosis. These two techniques have their unique advantages and disadvantages associated with the monitoring and fault diagnosis of machinery. When these techniques are conducted independently, only a <b>portion</b> of <b>machine</b> faults are typically diagnosed. However, practical experience has shown that integrating these two techniques in a machine condition monitoring program provides greater and more reliable information, bringing significant cost benefits to industry. The objective of this work is to investigate the correlation between vibration analysis and wear debris analysis. This was achieved by investigating different operating conditions of an experimental rig, consisting of a worm gearbox driven by an electric motor. The worm gearbox was initially run under normal operating conditions as a comparative test. A series of tests were then conducted corresponding to lack of proper lubrication, and with different contaminant particles added to the various lubricants. Oil samples and vibration data were regularly collected. Numerical data produced by wear debris analysis were compared with vibration spectra, in order to quantify {{the effectiveness of the}} two condition monitoring techniques. The results from this paper have given more understanding on the dependent and independent roles of vibration and wear debris analyses in predicting and diagnosing machine faults. ...|$|R
40|$|During {{the normal}} course of high energy storage ring operations, it is {{customary}} for blocks of time to be allotted to something called ``machine studies,`` or more simply, just ``studies. `` It is during these periods of time that observations and measurement of accelerator behavior are actually performed.

For the latter activity, a good <b>portion</b> of <b>machine</b> studies time is usually devoted to ``beam tuning`` activities: those standard measurements and adjustments required to recover good operations. Before continuing, please note that this paper is not intended to be comprehensive.

Many topics are discussed, some in more detail than others, and it is not the intention that the techniques described herein be applied verbatim to any existing accelerator.

This external weight must obviously be sufficient to overcome the friction and mechanical losses within the machine design even after the work <b>portion</b> of the <b>machine</b> cycle has been accomplished. In the example above of the dump truck, the weight of the dump body, now raised at an angle of 60 degrees but empty of the load, must be enough to force the unpressurized hydraulic fluid out of the cylinder and cause it to retract to the fully collapsed position.|$|R
