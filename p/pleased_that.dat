5|$|Grace {{may have}} felt <b>pleased</b> <b>that</b> he had got his man {{but he did not}} get his expenses, for Surrey refused to pay them.

5|$|Handley was {{replaced}} by former Denver Broncos head coach Dan Reeves, who led the Broncos to three Super Bowls in four years, one against the Giants. After his dismissal from the Broncos, Reeves took {{the unusual step of}} lobbying for the job. After being rebuffed by a number of candidates, George Young was <b>pleased</b> <b>that</b> someone with Reeves's credentials wanted the job.|$|E
60|$|Now when Peter said <b>please</b> <b>that</b> way, {{of course}} Old Mr. Toad couldn't resist him. Nobody could.|$|R

6000|$|... "You're a temptress, Leila. Will you let Nollie know, <b>please,</b> <b>that</b> we {{can take}} her back with us? Can you let her off to-morrow?" ...|$|R
5|$|The Daily News Soraya Roberts {{expressed}} {{relief that}} the writers were not gullible {{enough to have}} Karofsky end the episode by joining the glee club. Amy Reiter of the Los Angeles Times opined that Karofsky's character development was the best element of the episode, but found his conflicted emotions convoluted, and was <b>pleased</b> <b>that</b> he was victimized by the hockey team.|$|E
5|$|Also in the 1878 session, tax {{assessments}} for railroad property {{were raised}} to match {{those of other}} property. Agrarian interests were <b>pleased</b> <b>that</b> the legal interest rate was again lowered, now reaching the six percent they had proposed in the previous session. Non-economic reforms included the separation of Kentucky Agricultural and Mechanical College (later the University of Kentucky) from Kentucky University (later Transylvania University) {{and the establishment of}} a state board of health. Bills of local import again dominated the session, representing 90 percent of the acts and resolutions passed by the Assembly.|$|E
5|$|As Feodora grew older, various suitors were {{considered}} for marriage. The exiled Prince Peter Karađorđević, thirty-six years her senior, unsuccessfully requested {{her hand in}} marriage. Another potential candidate was her cousin Alfred, Hereditary Prince of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. In late 1897, Feodora became engaged to Prince Henry XXX of Reuss, and they married the following year, on 24 September 1898 in a Lutheran ceremony at Breslau. The groom was fifteen years older than his bride and a captain in a Brunswick regiment, but not wealthy or particularly high-ranked. Many in the family were shocked at the marriage, but the Dowager Empress was at least <b>pleased</b> <b>that</b> her granddaughter seemed happy with the match.|$|E
60|$|MRS GEORGE. Right, young man. You {{will tell}} her, <b>please,</b> <b>that</b> you love me: before everybody, mind, {{the very next}} time you see her.|$|R
6000|$|... "Exactly," [...] said Mr. Crump. [...] "And therefore, gentlemen, {{to get out}} of the difficulty, we'll presume, if you <b>please,</b> <b>that</b> {{the bill}} is paid." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I've {{been in the}} mountains, {{leading a}} pure life," [...] said my father. [...] "And we'll speak of nothing, if you <b>please,</b> <b>that's</b> gone by." ...|$|R
5|$|During his labors {{to sustain}} the {{provisional}} government, Johnson's lack of hearing from his family weighed heavily upon him. The only family member {{with whom he had}} contact was his son Madison ("Matty"), who had joined John Hunt Morgan's cavalry. Johnson admired and respected Morgan, and was <b>pleased</b> <b>that</b> his son had chosen to serve under him. In 1862, he requested by letter that his wife send their fifteen-year-old son Junius to serve in the Confederate Army. Despite Johnson's protestations that he would ensure his son's safety, his wife refused this request.|$|E
5|$|Handley was {{replaced}} by Dan Reeves, the successful former {{head coach of the}} Denver Broncos who led the Broncos to three Super Bowls in four years, one against the Giants. After his dismissal from the Broncos, Reeves took the unusual step of lobbying heavily for the job. Especially after being publicly rebuffed by a number of candidates, George Young was <b>pleased</b> <b>that</b> someone with Reeves's credentials wanted the job, and Reeves was hired as Giants head coach. He had been a finalist along with Perkins for the team's head coaching position in 1979, but Young went with Perkins at the time because he felt he knew him better from their days together with the Baltimore Colts.|$|E
5|$|In May 1861, Britain and France {{declared}} the South to be belligerents by international law, and their ships {{were entitled to}} {{the same rights as}} U.S.-flagged vessels to remain 24 hours in neutral ports. Nevertheless, Seward was <b>pleased</b> <b>that</b> both nations would not meet with Confederate commissioners or recognize the South as a nation. Britain did not challenge the Union blockade of Confederate ports, and Seward wrote that if Britain continued to avoid interfering in the war, he would not be overly sensitive to what wording they used to describe their policies.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, I could not," [...] {{answered}} Robinson. [...] "You {{may tell}} them that in the shop if you <b>please.</b> <b>That</b> will lie in your department." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'That {{would be}} the most {{tolerable}} way of doing it; but I would lay you anything you <b>please</b> <b>that</b> nothing but unmitigated Finch will content her.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "For goodness' sake, no more digressions," [...] she implored. [...] "Remember, <b>please,</b> <b>that</b> I {{play this}} game for the peace of mind of my tradespeople! I redouble!" ...|$|R
5|$|On August 20, Ford {{nominated}} former New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller to {{fill the}} vice presidency he had vacated. Rockefeller's top competitor had been George H. W. Bush. Rockefeller underwent extended hearings before Congress, which caused embarrassment when it was revealed he made large gifts to senior aides, such as Henry Kissinger. Although conservative Republicans were not <b>pleased</b> <b>that</b> Rockefeller was picked, most of them voted for his confirmation, and his nomination passed both the House and Senate. Some, including Barry Goldwater, voted against him.|$|E
5|$|Overall {{the attackers}} lost six bombers and 12 Bf 109s, some 12.5% of its strength. However, the British claimed 81 aircraft, 26 by the Duxford Wing. Zehbe's Dornier alone was claimed nine times. Among the German {{casualties}} {{that day was}} Rolf Heitsch and his flame throwing Dornier; the device had not been tested at high altitude and when used, squirted black oil over Holmes' windshield and {{attracted the attention of}} British fighters. Park would not have been <b>pleased</b> <b>that</b> despite being stripped of protection the small force of bombers lost only a quarter of its strength while surrounded by 100 fighters. Still, the operation had been a victory. Fighter Command lost 13 fighters, eight were claimed by JG 52.|$|E
5|$|The Lawton PD is {{especially}} <b>pleased</b> <b>that</b> “prominent crimes”, such as robbery and homicide have declined nearly 50%. Sergeants Stephanie Crawford and Tim Jenkins credit the marked improvement {{to not only}} the outstanding work of the LPD, {{but also to the}} involvement of Lawton’s citizens. One of the key contributing factors is local Neighborhood Watch groups, which act as the eyes and ears of the police department in the areas they represent. They also share tips on how to protect themselves with their neighbors at regular neighborhood meetings.|$|E
50|$|In closing {{he points}} out that it should be <b>pleasing</b> <b>that</b> the framers were able to put aside various {{differences}} and agree on a common form of government.|$|R
60|$|LESLIE. Admitted {{that you}} know more of life, sir; {{admitted}} (if you <b>please)</b> <b>that</b> the world is wicked; yet you do not lose trust in those you love.|$|R
6000|$|... "I beg {{you to be}} {{more careful}} in your speech," [...] said the Pumpkinhead, sharply. [...] "Remember, if you <b>please,</b> <b>that</b> it is my leg you are abusing." ...|$|R
5|$|The {{character}} of Brad Follmer {{was created in}} season nine to provide a love interest for Reyes, as the writers believed the audience needed {{to know more about}} her. However, Follmer's unresolved relationship with Reyes also served to heighten the conflict between Doggett and Follmer, as both men had feelings for her. Portraying actress Annabeth Gish was <b>pleased</b> <b>that</b> the relationship between her character and Scully was similar to that of two sisters, rather than Reyes serving as an antagonist to Scully.|$|E
5|$|After {{a dispute}} over stolen goods turns violent, Sobotka's son Ziggy is charged {{with the murder of}} one of the Greek's underlings. Sobotka himself is arrested for smuggling; he agrees to work with the detail to help his son, finally seeing his actions as a mistake. However, the Greek learns about this through his mole inside the FBI and has Sobotka killed. The {{investigation}} ends with the fourteen homicides solved but the perpetrator already dead. Several drug dealers and mid-level smuggling figures tied to the Greek are arrested, but he and his second-in-command escape uncharged and unidentified. The Major is <b>pleased</b> <b>that</b> Sobotka was arrested; the case is seen as a success by the commanding officers, but is viewed as a failure by the detail.|$|E
5|$|He visits Sumatra {{while the}} coastal forest of Nipa palms is flooded to a {{distance}} of several miles from the sea. The river houses at Palembang are built on rafts moored to piles, rising and falling with the tide. He admires the traditional houses of the villages, but had difficulty getting any food there, the people living entirely on rice through the rainy season. He discovers some new species of butterfly including Papilio memnon which occurs in different forms, some being Batesian mimics of Papilio coon. He admires the camouflage of a species of dead leaf butterfly, Kallima paralekta. He is <b>pleased</b> <b>that</b> one of his hunters brings him a male hornbill, shot at its nest hole while feeding the female.|$|E
6000|$|... "Say, if you <b>please,</b> <b>that</b> I {{will call}} again as soon after one o'clock as possible. I {{particularly}} {{wish to see}} Mrs. Lecount. My name is Miss Garth." ...|$|R
6000|$|She was silent. I {{have since}} learned why. It seems, if you <b>please,</b> <b>that</b> {{the very same}} remark {{had been made to}} her by that idiot Chevenix, upon me! ...|$|R
50|$|Pay {{attention}} <b>please</b> <b>that</b> {{cargo ship}} Шота Руставели (1925) was named in English Shota Rustavelli (double L), and passenger ship Шота Руставели (1968) had English name Shota Rustaveli (single L).|$|R
5|$|In {{addition}} {{to the use of}} visual effects, the closing sequence required ADR due to the sound of rain on the original filming. The visual effects were the director Dan Zeff's idea, and the writers were <b>pleased</b> <b>that</b> they were within budget. They also serve to tie the final shot to the opening shot of the episode, as both feature a raven. Scenes that were cut down in the editing process included the initial meeting between the witchfinders—Warren and Clarke—and Sir Andrew Pike, and a private discussion between Warren and Clarke after {{the first day of the}} trial. The extended versions of the scenes featured an explanation about the Devil being found in everyday objects and a discussion about the stages of torture respectively. Shearsmith expressed frustration that these extra scenes could not be included on the DVD release.|$|E
5|$|The Oakridge {{students}} are placed into learning groups named after animals. Gabrielle (Eva Longoria) initially suspects her daughter Juanita (Madison De La Garza), {{who is in}} the Leopards, is among the slow group, whereas Susan (Teri Hatcher) is <b>pleased</b> <b>that</b> her son M.J. (Mason Vale Cotton) is in the Giraffes, which she believes are advanced. This leads to competitive behavior between the two ladies. Eventually, by taking pictures of different students' homework and studying them, Gabrielle realizes the Leopards are actually advanced and the Giraffes are slow. When Susan realizes this, she confronts a teacher in public, and the secret code of the animal groups becomes widespread. While Susan and Gabrielle wait to talk to the principal, they both admit they got carried away and confess fears that they are letting their kids down.|$|E
5|$|The {{discovery}} and excavation of the Hoxne Hoard improved {{the relationship between}} the archaeological profession and the community of metal detectorists. Archaeologists were <b>pleased</b> <b>that</b> Lawes reported the find promptly and largely undisturbed, allowing a professional excavation. Metal detectorists noted that Lawes' efforts were appreciated by the archaeological profession. The 1996 Treasure Act is thought to have contributed to more hoards being made available to archaeologists. The act changed the law so that the owner of the land and the person who finds the hoard have a strong stake {{in the value of the}} discovery. The manner of the finding of the Hoxne Hoard by metal detector, and its widespread publicity, contributed to changing the previous system of common law for dealing with treasure trove into a statutory legal framework that takes into account technology such as metal detectors, provides incentives for treasure hunters to report finds, and considers the needs of museums and scholars.|$|E
60|$|But remember, dear reader, <b>please,</b> <b>that</b> {{there is}} not the {{slightest}} need for you to believe me, or even read me. Remember, it's just your own affair. Don't implicate me.|$|R
6000|$|... "All right," [...] said Mr. Bince, [...] "I {{suppose we}} shall see you Thursday, but just bear in mind, <b>please,</b> <b>that</b> you and I can work better {{together}} than at cross-purposes." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do you {{presume to}} {{threaten}} me?" [...] he said. [...] "Understand, if you <b>please,</b> <b>that</b> {{my mind is}} made up, and that nothing you can say or do will alter it." ...|$|R
