5|$|Wind figures {{prominently}} in several popular sports, including recreational hang gliding, hot air ballooning, kite flying, snowkiting, kite landboarding, kite surfing, paragliding, sailing, and windsurfing. In gliding, wind gradients {{just above the}} surface affect the takeoff and landing phases of flight of a glider. Wind gradient can have a noticeable effect on ground launches, also known as winch launches or wire launches. If the wind gradient is significant or sudden, or both, and the pilot maintains the same <b>pitch</b> <b>attitude,</b> the indicated airspeed will increase, possibly exceeding the maximum ground launch tow speed. The pilot must adjust the airspeed {{to deal with the}} effect of the gradient. When landing, wind shear is also a hazard, particularly when the winds are strong. As the glider descends through the wind gradient on final approach to landing, airspeed decreases while sink rate increases, and there is insufficient time to accelerate prior to ground contact. The pilot must anticipate the wind gradient and use a higher approach speed to compensate for it.|$|E

25|$|The Dutch Safety Board {{stated that}} the {{approach}} was not stabilized so the crew should have initiated a go around. The autopilot followed the glide slope while the autothrottle reduced thrust to idle due to a faulty radio altimeter showing an incorrect height. This caused the airspeed to drop and the <b>pitch</b> <b>attitude</b> to increase all unnoticed by the crew until the stick shaker activated. Prior to this, air traffic control caused the crew to intercept the glide slope from above and this obscured the erroneous autothrottle mode and increased the crew’s workload. The subsequent approach to stall recovery procedure was not executed properly, causing the aircraft to stall and crash.|$|E
25|$|During takeoff, {{both the}} ailerons and flaps are lowered, {{which is a}} {{relatively}} uncommon design approach but results in substantially elevated STOL performance. The flaps can be deployed to an extreme range, extending out at full to a 58 degree position; the flight manual notes that the full setting is recommended only for performing emergency landings. In the skies, the Beaver {{is relatively easy to}} handle, having been described as possessing light and comfortable controls; however, effective application of the rudder is necessitated in order to counteract adverse yaw. It should be flown with a relatively nose-low <b>pitch</b> <b>attitude</b> to maintain airspeed. Reportedly, the aircraft is very easy to land, even upon less calm water condition.|$|E
25|$|The {{flight crew}} did not acquire any visual ground {{references}} before the approach was started. The aircraft started its final descent for landing too early. The aircraft had descended to 280 feet above ground when the terrain awareness and warning system sounded in the cockpit. The captain ordered a go-around and the autopilot was turned off. The first officer put {{the nose of}} the aircraft up for 4 seconds and the thrust levers were set to go-around power. The aircraft pitched up to 12.3° nose up and the flight crew raised the landing gear and flaps. Shortly thereafter the co-pilot started making nose down inputs which caused the aircraft to pitch-attitude to reduce to 3.5° nose down. (The co-pilot could have been focused on the aircraft's speed, rather than its altitude.) The go-around <b>pitch</b> <b>attitude</b> was not maintained and the instructions from the flight director were not followed. (The report says that fatigue could {{have played a role in}} causing the first officer to focus solely on the airspeed.) The captain and the first officer were making inputs to the aircraft's side stick at the same time (although the dual inputs were not sufficient to trigger a dual-input warning). This action appears to be intended to provide assistance by the captain to fly the aircraft. This action led to confusion on who was flying the aircraft. The ground proximity warning system sounded as the aircraft lost more height and the co-pilot responded with a sharp nose-down input. Then the captain took control of the aircraft without warning, via the side stick priority button and maintained the nose-down input, while the first officer was simultaneously pulling back on his own side stick. Two seconds before impact with the ground the aircraft was at 180 feet. The captain was also pulling his side stick fully back, suggesting both pilots were aware of the aircraft's impending collision with the ground.|$|E

On 15 June 1994, Holland briefed the new wing commander, Colonel William Brooks, on the proposed flight plan. The demonstration profile—as briefed by Holland—included numerous violations of regulations, including steep bank angles, low-altitude passes, and steep pitch attitudes. Brooks ordered Holland not to exceed 45° bank angles or 25° <b>pitch</b> <b>attitude</b> during the demonstration. During the first practice session, on 17 June, Holland repeatedly violated these orders. Brooks witnessed this, but took no action.

40|$|The {{hovering}} {{flight of}} a {{micro air vehicle}} was investigated. Various flight control concepts, inspired by observation of insect and bird flight, were investigated in some detail. The concepts make use of flap frequency or phase between the flap and <b>pitch</b> <b>attitudes</b> of the wing to control the force magnitude. Tilt of the stroke plane or fuselage was used to vector the force. A flight control system was designed for each concept investigated. The investigation has revealed that the preferred control concept {{is one in which}} force vectoring is achieved by the fuselage tilt through a shift in the centre of gravity location while the force magnitude is controlled by the phase between <b>pitch</b> and flap <b>attitudes.</b> This has the advantage of reducing the vehicle weight {{while at the same time}} relaxing the demand of extremely high frequency actuators. The equations of motion based on a multi-body representation of a flapping wing micro air vehicle were derived and these form the basis for the SIMULINK flight simulation program used to carry out the above investigation. The aerodynamic model used for the simulation was obtained from force measurements with a flapping mechanism that allows the model wing to oscillate with two degrees of freedom (flap and pitch). During these measurements, the phase angle between the flap and pitch angles of the model wing was varied to determine the effects on the force magnitude and direction.

40|$|This work {{presents}} the mathematical modeling {{and analysis of}} helicopters towing submerged loads using long cables for sub-surface object detection when surface-based vessels cannot operate safely. A geometrically exact model of rotating beams is derived, and used to represent both the cable dynamics and rotor blade dynamics. Flight dynamics and trim conditions for an axially flexible straight cable and a curved cable are separately formulated for a general case of helical climbing turns, and used to cross-validate each other. In steady flight, the trim longitudinal dynamics of the submerged load produces down-forces from towed body fins, increasing the apparent weight of the tow system. Cable and towed body drag manifest as increases in the effective equivalent flat- plate area, necessitating excessive nose-down helicopter trim <b>pitch</b> <b>attitudes</b> (- 6 &# 9702;) and causing pilot discomfort. Excessive <b>pitch</b> <b>attitudes</b> can be avoided using aft offset of the helicopter tow point, or the deployment of longer cables in combination with pitching fins to regulate towed body depth. In steady level turning flight, cable and towed body drag result in the submerged load turning with a consistently smaller radius than the helicopter. Depth regulation in turning flight using pitching fins is less effective than in forward flight due to increased cable drag opposing larger down-forces. Analysis of linearized models showed that the helicopter frequency response to pilot inputs is unaffected {{by the addition of}} the cable and towed body above 1 rad/s. The low-frequency response magnitude reduces with increasing hydrodynamic drag on the cable and towed body, and is unaffected by cable structural properties due to over-damped stabilization from hydrodynamics. The swashplate inputs required to guide the towed body along a "tear-drop" shaped trajectory are obtained using a two-stage process. The motions of the tow point that guide the submerged load along the target path are obtained using an optimization process. The system target states are generated based on these tow point motions, and an LQR controller is used to guide the helicopter along its target path. Trim rotor inflows from the vortex wake model are obtained at the various equilibrium points used to construct helicopter target states, interpolated and applied as "delta" corrections to the dynamic inflow model. Blade elastic twist has a significant effect on rotor power predictions and the steady hub loads, while flap bending elasticity acts as a vibration absorber to attenuate the oscillatory component of hub rolling and pitching moments...|$|R
