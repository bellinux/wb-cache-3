40|$|The {{influence}} of aromatic sulfides on the kinetics and selectivity of hydrocarbon conversion by steam cracking and on <b>pyrolytic</b> <b>coke</b> formation {{was investigated in}} stainless steel tubular reactors with relatively large inner surface. The rate of decomposition of heptane (at 700 â€˜C, 100 kPa, and a mass ratio of steam to feed 3 :l) increased by 16 to 26 %, and the selectivity toward ethene decreased, if 0. 1 to 1. O % mass of dibenzyl sulfide, relative to heptane, was added. Addiiion of 1 % mass dibenzyl disulfide increased the decomposition rate of heptane by 8 %. Increasing amounts of the title compounds (0. 1, 0. 5 % mass) in the feed decreased coking up to 70 % in the pyrolysis of reformer raffinate at 820 OC, without steam. The decreased coking in turn caused an increased aromatic content in the liquid pyrolysis product mixtures. Based on the analytical results, obtained by capillary gas chromatography- mass spectrometry, reaction mechanisms are suggested...|$|E
40|$|The {{dispersed}} particle solution {{model of}} petroleum residua structure {{was used to}} develop predictors for <b>pyrolytic</b> <b>coke</b> formation. Coking Indexes were developed in prior years that measure how near a pyrolysis system is to coke formation during the coke formation induction period. These have been demonstrated to be universally applicable for residua regardless {{of the source of}} the material. Coking onset is coincidental with the destruction of the ordered structure and the formation of a multiphase system. The amount of coke initially formed appears to be a function of the free solvent volume of the original residua. In the current work, three-dimensional coke make predictability maps were developed at 400 C, 450 C, and 500 C (752 F, 842 F, and 932 F). These relate residence time and free solvent volume to the amount of coke formed at a particular pyrolysis temperature. Activation energies for two apparent types of zero-order coke formation reactions were estimated. The results provide a new tool for ranking residua, gauging proximity to coke formation, and predicting initial coke make tendencies...|$|E
