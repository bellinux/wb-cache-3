50|$|Chicago Federal Center Plaza, {{also known}} as Chicago Federal Plaza, unified three {{buildings}} of varying scales: the mid-rise Everett McKinley Dirksen Building, the high-rise John C. Kluczynski Building, and the single-story Post Office building. The complex’s plot area extends over two blocks; a one-block site, bounded by Jackson, Clark, Adams, and Dearborn streets, contains the Kluczynski Federal Building and U.S. Post Office Loop Station, while a parcel on an adjacent block to the east contains the Dirksen U.S. Courthouse. The structural framing of the buildings is formed of high-tensile bolted steel and concrete. The exterior curtain walls are defined by projecting steel I-beam mullions covered with flat black graphite paint, characteristic of Mies's designs. The balance of the curtain walls are of bronze-tinted glass <b>panes,</b> <b>framed</b> in shiny aluminum, and separated by steel spandrels, also covered with flat black graphite paint. The entire complex is organized on a 28-foot grid pattern subdivided into six 4-foot, 8-inch modules. This pattern extends from the granite-paved plaza into the ground-floor lobbies of the two tower buildings with the grid lines continuing vertically up the buildings and integrating each component of the complex.

40|$|Homes {{with single}} glazing {{represent}} {{a large majority}} of the New Zealand housing stock. With the recent changes to the NZ Building Code Clause H 1 Energy Efficiency, new homes require higher glazing thermal performance. This will lead to an increased need for cost effective methods to improve window thermal performance in existing single glazed homes without completely replacing the windows, which includes 'secondary' glazing. There are several secondary glazing options available including 'stick-on' plastic glazing as well as aluminium framed glass solutions that are installed inside the existing joinery. Secondary glazing is marketed as a cost effective alternative to insulated glazing units, providing both improved acoustic and thermal insulation to existing windows. There is little information regarding the in-use performance and cost benefits of secondary glazing in New Zealand. This thesis explores the efficacy of the secondary glazing products when installed in existing single <b>pane</b> <b>frames.</b> A guarded hotbox was used to make thermal resistance measurements on a typical single glazed aluminium window with timber reveal liner. Four common secondary glazing systems were retrofitted into the window - (1) thin plastic film; (2) magnetically-attached acrylic sheet; (3) aluminium framed secondary glazing; and (4) aluminium framed low emissivity (low-E) secondary glazing. Models of 'typical' New Zealand homes created in the ALF building thermal simulation programme were used to explore the heating energy savings and cost benefits provided by the different secondary glazing systems in a range of locations. Of the tested products, the low-E secondary glazing produces the largest cost-benefits. At current energy and material costs, secondary glazing was found to not be a financially viable solution in warmer climates such as Auckland. In cooler climates such as Christchurch and Dunedin, secondary glazing was found to be a cost effective retrofit alternative for existing single glazed home...|$|R

Due {{to the higher}} blade loading and higher tip speed of these propellers, noise levels of up to 150 dB are expected {{on the outside of}} the fuselage in the propeller plane. In this study the transmissibility of triple pane windows, designed to provide 69 dB noise transmission loss at the blade propeller frequency of 164 Hz, was experimentally investigated using insertion loss and three-dimensional intensity techniques. A modal analysis on the outer window panes was conducted to determine pane modal frequencies. Coherence and phase relation of outer <b>panes</b> and window <b>frame</b> were established to obtain double/triple wall and lump mass resonance frequencies. Double/triple wall resonances were found to degrade the transmission loss of the two windows.

Youth is the time of rash pledges. Had I taken a wrong turning I would have been lost; and if faithful to my pledge I might have remained lost for days, for weeks, have left perhaps my bones to be discovered bleaching in some blind alley of the Whitechapel district, as it had happened to lonely travellers lost in the bush.

The place I was bound to was not easy to find. It was one of those courts hidden away from the charted and navigable streets, lost among the thick growth of houses like a dark pool in the depths of a forest, approached by an inconspicuous archway as if by secret path; a Dickensian nook of London, that wonder city, the growth of which bears no sign of intelligent design, but many traces of freakishly sombre phantasy the Great Master knew so well how to bring out by the magic of his understanding love.

40|$|Circumferentially {{adhesive}} bonded glass <b>panes</b> in steel <b>frames</b> of facades {{can take over}} the structural function of steel braces for the stabilization of one-storey buildings. A system, built up of a steel frame, a single glass pane and a flexible {{adhesive bonded}} joint across the full thickness of the glass pane was subjected to a concentrated horizontal in-plane load at the top. Experiments with square glass pane sizes showed that the system had a very small inplane stiffness, a glass-steel contact at large horizontal in-plane loads and a good residual capacity. The parametric studies by means of finite element models only focused on the variation of the geometry of the glass pane. The behaviour of the system mainly depends on the stiffness of the adhesive bonded joint. At larger horizontal in-plane displacements, systems with rectangular glass pane sizes have two glass-steel contacts. The mechanic models well predict the in-plane stiffness of the system, the largest maximum principle stress and the maximum normal and shear stresses in the adhesive bonded joint. The horizontal in-plane load and the horizontal in-plane displacement at the top at the first glass-steel contact are also well predicted. The criteria are the limitation of the horizontal in-plane displacement at the top (serviceability) or the strain rate of the adhesive bonded joint (strength). To guarantee the stability of a building all glass panes in the facade have to be mobilized to transfer in-plane load...|$|R

During 1989 the company became a Public Limited Company and the innovation of inward-opening balcony glass <b>panes</b> without vertical <b>frames</b> was invented. During that particular year Parvekenikkarit Inc. was founded to conduct sales and installation in western and northern Finland, in addition to the Helsinki area. In the beginning of the nineties production was separated from sales and installation operations. As a result, Lumon Oy was established in 1991. In the course of 1996 the company launched new 21st century balcony glazing system and commenced the production of aluminum balustrades, glass terraces and additional panes for existing windows. At that time Lumon Inc. also inaugurated a new balcony glazing plant. The new plant enabled the company to start its own glass processing line: cutting, grinding, drilling, tempering. Since 2001, the company started to manufacture glass facades and aluminum doors and windows.

40|$|Glass panes {{structurally}} {{bonded to}} a steel framework {{can be used}} as a stability system for buildings. A system built up of a single glass <b>pane,</b> a steel <b>frame</b> and a glued joint is only loaded by a concentrated monotonic in-plane load at the top. Three glued joint types are defined, namely a flexible joint on the end, a two-sided and a one-sided rigid joint. A finite element model was developed and calibrated with the experiments followed by varying the geometry of the glass pane. The applied criteria are the strength of glass for failure and the restricted in-plane displacement at the top. The system with a flexible joint on the end can be characterized by small loads, large inplane displacements and small stiffnesses. The stiffness is the criterion. Systems with two-sided and one sided rigid joints can be characterized by larger loads, much smaller,in-plane displacements and larger stiffnesses. The strength of glass is the criterion and is located on the glass pane's surface in the vicinity of the glued joint which anchors the tensile diagonal of the glass pane. These tensile stresses increase by the different in stiffness of the glued joint (rigid) and the less shear stiffness of the bolts between beadwork and outside beam of the frame. However, the stress distribution in the glass pane as well as in the glued joint is unfavourable for systems with one-sided rigid joint. The two-sided rigid glued joint is a promising joint type based on the geometric parameters of the glass pane and the good residual capacity after the first cracks as observed in the experiments...|$|R

This inartificial edifice, exactly such as a child would build with cards, had a steep roof flagged with coarse grey stones instead of slates; a half-circular turret, battlemented, or, to use the appropriate phrase, bartizan'd on the top, served as a case for a narrow turnpike stair, by which an ascent was gained from storey to storey; and {{at the bottom of}} the said turret was a door studded with large-headed nails. There was no lobby {{at the bottom of the}} tower, and scarce a landing-place opposite to the doors which gave access to the apartments. One or two low and dilapidated outhouses, connected by a courtyard wall equally ruinous, surrounded the mansion. The court had been paved, but the flags being partly displaced and partly renewed, a gallant crop of docks and thistles sprung up between them, and the small garden, which opened by a postern through the wall, seemed not to be in a much more orderly condition. Over the low-arched gateway which led into the yard there was a carved stone, exhibiting some attempt at armorial bearings; and above the inner entrance hung, and had hung, for many years, the mouldering hatchment, which announced that umquhile Laurence Dumbie of Dumbiedikes had been gathered to his fathers in Newbattle kirkyard. The approach to this palace of pleasure was by a road formed by the rude fragments of stone gathered from the fields, and it was surrounded by ploughed, but unenclosed land. Upon a baulk, that is, an unploughed ridge of land interposed among the corn, the Laird's trusty palfrey was tethered by the head, and picking a meal of grass. The whole argued neglect and discomfort; the consequence, however, of idleness and indifference, not of poverty.|$|R
60|$|I had wished {{very much}} {{to have been able}} to tell you in this letter where we had taken our house, or where we were going to take it. We remain, however, in our usual state of {{conscious}} ignorance, although there is a good deal of talking and walking about a house in Wimpole Street--which, between ourselves, I am not very anxious to live in, on account of the gloominesses of that street, and of that part of the street, whose walls look so much like Newgate's turned inside out. I would rather go on, in my old way, inhabiting castles in the air than that particular house. Nevertheless, if it is decided upon, I dare say I shall contrive to be satisfied with it, and sleep and wake very much as I should in any other. It will certainly be a point gained to be settled somewhere, and I do so long to sit in my own armchair--strange as it will look out of my own room--and to read from my own books.... For our own particular parts, our healths continue good--none of us, I think, the worse for fog or wind. As to wind, we were almost elevated into the prerogative of pigs in the late storm. We could almost see it, and the feeling it might have been fatal to us. Bro and I were moralising about shipwrecks, in the dining-room, when down came the chimney through the skylight into the entrance passage. You may imagine the crashing effect of the bricks bounding from the staircase downwards, breaking the stone steps in the process, in addition to the falling in of twenty-four large <b>panes</b> of glass, <b>frames</b> and all. We were terrified out of all propriety, and there has been a dreadful calumny about Henrietta and me--that we had the hall door open for the purpose of going out into the street with our hair on end, if Bro had not encouraged us by shutting the door and locking it. I confess to opening the door, but deny the purpose of it--at least, maintain that I only meant to keep in reserve a way of escape, in case, as seemed probable, the whole house was on its way to the ground. Indeed, we should think much of the mercy of the escape. Bro had been on the staircase only five minutes before. Sarah the housemaid was actually there. She looked up accidentally and saw the nodding chimneys, and ran down into the drawing-room to papa, shrieking, but escaping with one graze of the hand from one brick. How did you fare in the wind? I never much imagined before that anything so true to nature as a real live storm could make itself heard in our streets. But it has come too surely, and carried away with it, besides our chimney, all that was left to us of the country, in the shape of the Kensington Garden trees. Now do write to me, dearest Mrs. Martin, and soon, and tell me all you can of your chances and mischances, and how Mr. Martin is getting on with the parish, and yourself with the parishioners. But you have more the name of living at Colwall than the thing. You seem to me to lead a far more wandering life than we, for all our homelessness and 'pilgrim shoon.' Why, you have been in Ireland since I last said a word to you, even upon paper....|$|R
