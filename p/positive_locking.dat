5000|$|A <b>positive</b> <b>locking</b> {{device is}} a device used in {{conjunction}} with a fastener in order to [...] lock the fastener. This means that the fastener cannot work loose from vibrations. The following is a list of <b>positive</b> <b>locking</b> devices: ...|$|E
50|$|As {{key length}} is the {{distance}} between two parallel surfaces, mostly for torque transmission by <b>positive</b> <b>locking</b> serve.|$|E
50|$|Safety wire or locking-wire {{is a type}} of <b>positive</b> <b>locking</b> {{device that}} {{prevents}} fasteners from loosening or falling out due to vibration and other forces. The presence of safety wiring may also serve to indicate that the fasteners have been properly tightened.|$|E
50|$|A form of {{transmission}} brake is commonly fitted to automatic transmissions. These brakes use a dog clutch or pawl system, rather than friction linings. They thus provide {{a simple and}} <b>positive</b> <b>lock</b> when stationary, but cannot (or at least, should not) be engaged when moving.|$|R
2500|$|The Lauda {{aircraft}} was traveling {{at a high}} speed when the thrust reversers deployed, causing the pilots to lose control of the aircraft. James R. Chiles, author of Inviting Disaster, said, [...] "the point here is not that a thorough test would have told the pilots Thomas J. Welch and Josef Thumer what to do. A thrust reverser deploying in flight {{might not have been}} survivable, anyway. But a thorough test would have informed the FAA and Boeing that thrust reversers deploying in midair was such a dangerous occurrence that Boeing needed to install a <b>positive</b> <b>lock</b> that would prevent such an event." [...] As a result of their findings during the investigation process of Lauda Flight 004, additional safety features such as mechanical <b>positive</b> <b>locks</b> were mandated to prevent thrust reverser deployment in flight.|$|R
40|$|Document {{describes}} nut allowing fastener inserted or {{removed from}} either side by simply sliding fastener in or out. Detents on each face of nut, when pushed in, ensure positive engagement of threads. Followed by conventional clockwise turning to lock and counterclockwise turning to unlock nut. Detents, when viewed, show whether nut in <b>positive</b> <b>lock...</b>|$|R
50|$|MC3 {{connectors}} {{have been}} largely superseded by MC4 connectors due to support being withdrawn by the National Electrical Code for solar applications. The MC3 connector does not incorporate a <b>positive</b> <b>locking</b> mechanism and can become disconnected while the solar panels are producing electricity causing dangerous arcing.|$|E
50|$|The front {{suspension}} features {{coil springs}} over a solid axle with trailing arms. The split rear axle {{is tied to}} a heavy-duty coil spring suspension. Cone-shaped passages {{in the rear of}} the hull allow for high individual vertical roadwheel travel. Both axles are fitted with <b>positive</b> <b>locking</b> differentials which provide improved traction by preventing one wheel spin-out.|$|E
50|$|The bolt or axle has one or {{two holes}} drilled through its {{threaded}} end. The nut is torqued properly and then, if the slot is not aligned with {{the hole in the}} fastener, the nut is rotated forward to the nearest slot. The nut is then secured with a split pin/cotter pin, R-clip or safety wire. It is a <b>positive</b> <b>locking</b> device.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, Saco {{addressed}} Navy Special Warfare requirements {{to develop a}} retrofit parts package for the machine gun. Called the M60E4, it was more reliable and durable than the M60E3, had a [...] "duckbill" [...] flash suppressor, and a shorter and thicker <b>positive</b> <b>lock</b> gas cylinder extension. NAVSPECWAR units began to receive it in late 1994, when it was designated the MK43 Mod 0.|$|R
40|$|In a {{hydraulic}} cylinder, the hub characteristic {{is divided into}} a high-speed rapid stroke with low dynamic effects followed by a working stroke performed at lower speed but with greater dynamic effect. This is obtained by forming the piston surface of the cylinder by two pistons of different cross-sections. The piston with the smaller cross-sectional area is shifted to the second piston in the axial direction and forms a <b>positive</b> <b>lock</b> with the second piston by means of automatically released interlocking elements...|$|R
25|$|The {{intermediate}} cars sit on type MD530 bogies {{with steel}} suspension and an axle base of 2500mm. New wheels have {{a diameter of}} 920mm. They are replaced when they reach a diameter of 860mm. The cars are coupled 900mm above the rails by a semi-automatic coupling that was designed specifically for the ICE1. It couples two brake pipes, two electric trainlines, cables and two fibre optic cables. The passage between two cars is 1.1m wide and 2.05m high. Unlike on the InterCityExperimental, they are not <b>positive</b> <b>locked</b> on the outside.|$|R
50|$|The tool {{is similar}} to a rotary table except that it is {{designed}} to be tilted as well as rotated and often allows <b>positive</b> <b>locking</b> at finer gradations of rotation, including through differential indexing. Most adjustable designs allow the head to be tilted from 10° below horizontal to 90° vertical, at which point the head is parallel with the machine table.|$|E
50|$|A Palnut is a {{locking device}} for nuts made of stamped sheet metal, {{and is a}} {{registered}} trademark. The palnut is screwed on the bolt {{on top of an}} ordinary nut, and has a series of protruding barbs that locks the nut in place when the nut is tightened. The Palnut itself is reusable. A Palnut should not be used as a substitute for a <b>positive</b> <b>locking</b> device such as a castellated nut or nuts with safety wire.|$|E
50|$|New models {{appeared}} {{over the}} years: the 35 II in 1946, the IIA in 1953, the IIB in 1960 and finally, the IIC in 1964. In 1982, the II-series was superseded by the Arriflex 35-3C model, having a IIC film transport movement, a swiveling viewfinder, a quartz-driven handgrip motor, a then-new Arri PL (<b>positive</b> <b>locking)</b> lens mount and a variable shutter. The 35-3C model {{was put into}} production to use up 150 sets of 35 IIC camera movement units still inventoried at the factory.|$|E
50|$|Normally, gas-operated or delayed-blowback {{mechanisms}} {{are used in}} automatic weapons of rifle calibre and larger because the chamber pressure in such weapons is very high. Therefore, if a simple blowback system (where there is no <b>positive</b> <b>lock</b> between the bolt and barrel) is used, the bolt may recoil and open the breech while the chamber pressure is still high, causing damage to the weapon and split cases (see blowback article for more information). To avoid this, simple blowback guns have to use low-powered cartridges or a very heavy bolt.|$|R
50|$|The {{intermediate}} cars sit on type MD 530 bogies {{with steel}} suspension and an axle base of 2500 mm. New wheels have {{a diameter of}} 920 mm. They are replaced when they reach a diameter of 860 mm. The cars are coupled 900 mm above the rails by a semi-automatic coupling that was designed specifically for the ICE 1.

5000|$|The Police Positive {{was made}} of carbon steel, and was {{finished}} with either a polished blued finish or nickel-plated. The First issue of the Police Positive ran from the revolver’s introduction in 1907 until 1927. Sporting Colt’s standard hard rubber grips, it was offered with barrel lengths of 2.5 (available only in [...]32 caliber), 4, 5, and 6 inches, and was chambered for the [...]32 Long Colt (it would also accept the [...]32 Short Colt), [...]32 Colt New Police, and [...]38 Colt New Police cartridges. Checkered Walnut grips became standard after 1923. The Second issue began in 1928 and ran until 1947, adding a somewhat heavier frame {{as well as a}} serrated topstrap to reduce sight glare, while retaining the wooden grips. Both of Colt's “New Police” rounds were actually slight redesigns of existing S&W cartridges, the [...]32 S&W Long and [...]38 S&W with the bullet noses flattened, as Colt resisted providing its main competitor with any free advertising. Colt's <b>Positive</b> <b>Lock</b> safety, the innovation responsible for the gun's introduction, functioned by preventing the firing pin from striking the primer of the cartridge unless the trigger was deliberately pulled. Intended to address deficiencies of earlier models such as the Single Action Army, the <b>Positive</b> <b>Lock</b> prevented an accidental discharge even if the hammer was struck or the pistol was dropped, allowing the revolver to be safely carried with all six chambers loaded. The revolver’s sights consisted of a half-moon blade front with a fixed iron open rear sight, which was a simple V-notch shaped groove milled into the revolver’s topstrap.|$|R
5000|$|The {{development}} of articulated locomotives {{was a major}} impetus to the {{development of}} power reverse systems, because these typically had two or even three sets of reverse gear, instead of just one on a simple locomotive. [...] The Baldwin Locomotive Works used the Ragonnet reversing gear, and other American builders generally abandoned <b>positive</b> <b>locking</b> features. In British use, locking cylinders remained in use. The Hadfield reversing gear, patented in 1950, was in most particulars a Ragonnet reversing gear with added locking cylinder.Most Beyer Garratt locomotives used the Hadfield system.|$|E
50|$|Other {{changes were}} implemented, some during the war, {{but not all}} M1917s {{received}} these updates. Beginning in 1938, the pivot in the top cover was replaced with a new one that would become standard on all M1919 series guns. While the World War I pattern top cover hinge pin {{appears to have been}} retained on most converted M1917s, the later production M1917A1s had a <b>positive</b> <b>locking</b> top cover hinge pin that allowed the top cover to remain open lessening the chance of it dropping closed on one's hands while working on the gun—this became the standard on all M1919 series guns.|$|E
50|$|One of many {{additional}} {{concerns is}} to prevent people in the crowd from snatching officers' side arms, which may be stolen or even used against the police. In a very heavy crowd, the officer {{may not be able}} to see who is responsible for snatching a weapon, and may not even notice that it has happened. For this reason, riot police may have holsters with <b>positive</b> <b>locking</b> mechanisms or other extra means of retention, if their agencies can afford such tools. However, this can be a trade-off that increases the amount of time needed to draw the sidearm in an emergency. Alternately, riot police may not carry sidearms at all.|$|E
50|$|Produced {{with fine}} carbon steel, the Positive Special {{featured}} Colt’s characteristic highly polished surfaces and was available with Colt's signature bright royal blued finish {{as well as}} a nickel-plated veneer. Built on Colt’s “D” frame, it was offered in four, five, and six inch barreled models, weighing a scant 23 ounces in the four inch. The Positive Special also incorporated Colt’s “Positive Lock” safety which preventing the firing pin from hitting the primer unless the trigger was deliberately pulled. Intended to address deficiencies of earlier models such as the Single Action Army, Colt's <b>Positive</b> <b>Lock</b> prevented an accidental discharge even if the lowered hammer was struck or the pistol was dropped, allowing the revolver to be safely carried with all six chambers loaded. The pistol’s sights consisted of a blade front with a fixed iron open rear sight, which was a simple V-notch shaped groove milled into the revolver’s topstrap.|$|R
5000|$|Various {{methods are}} used to attach the socket or {{accessory}} to the anvil, such as a spring-loaded pin that snaps into a matching hole in the socket, preventing the socket being removed until an object is used to depress the pin, a hog ring which holds the socket by friction or by snapping into indents machined into the socket, and a through-hole, where a pin is inserted completely through the socket and anvil, locking the socket on. Hog rings are used on most smaller tools, with though-hole used only on larger impact wrenches, typically ¾" [...] drive or greater. Pin retainers used to be more common, but seem to be being replaced by hog rings on most tools, {{despite the lack of}} a <b>positive</b> <b>lock.</b> ¼" [...] female hex drive is becoming increasingly popular for small impact wrenches, especially cordless electric versions, allowing them to fit standard screwdriver tips rather than sockets.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project was to {{demonstrate}} nonstructural hazard mitigation to the industrial community surrounding San Jose State University. A Materials Processing Laboratory which has {{a wide variety of}} experimental equipment was retrofitted in three phases. In Phase I the doors of all wall mounted cabinets were retrofitted with <b>positive</b> <b>lock</b> latches. Lighter equipment and computers placed on laboratory benches were restrained during Phase II. Equipment with low aspect ratios were placed on friction pads, whereas equipment with high aspect ratios were restrained to the countertop or the splash guard with adhesive joints. In Phase III the heavier floor mounted equipment had custom brackets fabricated from Grade A 36 steel flat bars and were anchored to the concrete slab floor with threaded rod anchors installed with a two-part adhesive. Replacement cost of equipment was compared to the mitigation cost. Future work on calculating benefit cost ratios (BCR) is planned. Tours will be provided for engineering students and industry personnel to demonstrate the various approaches to nonstructural hazard mitigation and its benefits...|$|R
5000|$|There is also [...] "an {{upstream}} connected {{frangible disc}} safety relief device" [...] {{located on the}} valve assembly which {{is also known as}} the [...] "tri-dimensional burst disk". This burst disk protects the user against a situation where the pressure in the bottle would increase with exposure to heat during a fire. It prevents unwanted failures somewhere else in the bottle. It is set to release at 7200 psi, or 400 °F. It is [...] "tri-dimensional" [...] in that, if it is activated, it would disperse the air from the bottle in three directions so as not to throw the user off his or her balance. The high pressure male coupling, included in high pressure bottle connections, is set to met the Compressed Gas Association Standards #346 and #347.Also included in the assembly are the dual-sided pressure gauge (which reads the cylinder pressure directly from the cylinder), elastomeric bumper (a protective, rubber like stop), and hangar plate (for <b>positive</b> <b>locking</b> attachment of the assembly to the backframe).|$|E
50|$|As steam {{locomotives}} replaced horses as {{the preferred}} means of power, they became optimised {{to run in}} only one direction for operational ease and to provide some weather protection. The resulting need to turn heavy locomotives required an engineering upgrade to the existing turnplate technology. Like earlier turnplates, most new turntables consisted of a circular pit in which a steel bridge rotated. The bridge was typically supported and balanced by the central pivot, to reduce the total load on the pivot and to allow easy turning. This was most often achieved by a steel rail running around {{the floor of the}} pit that supported the ends of the bridge when a locomotive entered or exited. The turntables had a <b>positive</b> <b>locking</b> mechanism to prevent undesired rotation and to align the bridge rails with the exit track. Rotation of the bridge could be accomplished manually (either by brute force or with a windlass system), by an external power source, or by the braking system of the locomotive itself, though this required a locomotive to be on the table for it to be rotated.|$|E

Joint combines zero backlash, <b>positive</b> <b>locking,</b> and centerline pivoting. Used in folding tool handles, portable antenna booms, {{and many other}} deployable structures...|$|E
50|$|The OTs-33 is a {{selective}} fire blowback-operated weapon firing the 9×18mm Makarov pistol cartridge; it can use {{both types of}} 9x18mm ammunition, the standard 57-N-181S and the more powerful 57-N-181SM round. The blowback operation incorporates a feature that separates the slide and barrel as they move to the rear during recoil; there is no <b>positive</b> <b>lock</b> between the slide and barrel as in other conventional designs. As the slide and barrel separate, the spent case is ejected and the slide is then forced back to the barrel by a spring action, chambering a fresh cartridge in the process. The barrel and slide continue to the rear together in recoil for another 5 mm {{before returning to the}} forward position. This feature improves the automatic fire accuracy, reduces felt recoil, and is responsible for slowing down the cyclic rate of fire, without using a sophisticated rate reducer mechanism such as the one employed in the APS pistol. This method of operation also allows the use of standard and higher power 9x18mm ammunition without using a locked breech action. To further reduce felt recoil and compensate for muzzle rise during firing, some propellant gases are diverted into a ported slide cavity that acts as a muzzle brake and compensator, deflecting the gases upward to stabilize the barrel.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. Direct {{contact and}} {{airborne}} transmission are established modes of microbial contamination of standard in-travenous (iv) assemblies such as piggyback and heparin lock. 1 - 17 In this study, 60 % {{of the standard}} iv assemblies inoc-ulated with Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) at the barrel of their exposed needle grew these organisms when cultured in a Soy Casein Digest Broth (SCDB). Also, 40 closed, <b>positive</b> <b>locking</b> iv assemblies (Click-Lock) were inoculated at possible contamination sites, and none of these assemblies grew S. aureus in a SCDB. These in vitro studies suggest that a closed, <b>positive</b> <b>locking</b> iv assembly such as the Click-Lock device may substantially reduce, and potentially prevent contamination of iv systems.

40|$|The NASA Lunar Electric Rover (LER) {{has been}} {{developed}} at Johnson Space Center as a next generation mobility platform. Based upon a twelve wheel omni-directional chassis with active suspension the LER introduces a number of novel capabilities for lunar exploration in both manned and unmanned scenarios. Besides being the primary vehicle for astronauts on the lunar surface, LER will perform tasks such as lunar regolith handling (to include dozing, grading, and excavation), equipment transport, and science operations. In an effort to support these additional tasks a team at the Kennedy Space Center has produced a universal attachment interface for LER known as the Quick Attach. The Quick Attach is a compact system that has been retro-fitted {{to the rear of}} the LER giving it the ability to dock and undock on the fly with various implements. The Quick Attach utilizes a two stage docking approach; the first is a mechanical mate which aligns and latches a passive set of hooks on an implement with an actuated cam surface on LER. The mechanical stage is tolerant to misalignment between the implement and the LER during docking and once the implement is captured a preload is applied to ensure a <b>positive</b> <b>lock.</b> The second stage is an umbilical connection which consists of a dust resistant enclosure housing a compliant mechanism that is optionally actuated to mate electrical and fluid connections for suitable implements. The Quick Attach system was designed with the largest foreseen input loads considered including excavation operations and large mass utility attachments. The Quick Attach system was demonstrated at the Desert Research And Technology Studies (D-RA TS) field test in Flagstaff, AZ along with the lightweight dozer blade LANCE. The LANCE blade is the first implement to utilize the Quick Attach interface and demonstrated the tolerance, speed, and strength of the system in a lunar analog environment...|$|R
5000|$|For {{some time}} Union Connector {{produced}} 2P&G connectors with a distinctive yellow cover that featured a locking tab {{in the ground}} pin that provided a <b>positive</b> mechanical <b>lock</b> to prevent accidental disengagement of the connectors. This design required special connectors on both {{the male and female}} side in order to work, meaning that all connectors in an installation would need to be replaced to see a real benefit to the locking feature. The expense of this proposition as well as the unpopularity of the connector itself among technicians led the locking feature to eventually be dropped, and locking connectors are no longer manufactured. The locking connectors that are still found occasionally in installations or spare parts bins are often referred to as [...] "Union Connectors", though the Union Connector brand now features only standard non-locking stage pin connectors.|$|R
