Walker; Mr. Sir, who is revealed to be a paroled criminal named Marion Sevillo; and Pendanski, who is a criminal impersonating a doctor, are arrested for their actions.

After seeing the couple kiss, Walker kills Sam and in retaliation, Kate kills the local sheriff and gains notoriety as a robber. With Sam dead, Green Lake dries up and the town is abandoned. Years later, the now bankrupt Walkers track down Kate and demand she hand over her treasure.

Eventually, Stanley carries the now ill Hector up the mountain where they find a wild field of onions and a source of water, helping them regain strength; at the same time, Stanley unknowingly fulfills his ancestor's promise to the fortune teller, Madame Zeroni and breaks the curse.

Tuonetar is delighted {{to offer him}} a golden goblet of beer, but when he looks closer he can see {{it is really a}} black poison made of frog spawn, young <b>poisonous</b> snakes, <b>lizards,</b> adders, and worms.

50|$|Broadcast 1 March 1984, {{the next}} {{instalment}} explores {{the world of}} deserts. It begins in the largest, the Sahara, where the highest land temperatures have been recorded. Rock paintings depict creatures such as giraffes and antelopes, suggesting {{that at one point}} there was enough vegetation to support them. Now, such life has all but disappeared, {{with the exception of the}} cypress, whose roots find water deep underground. Since the night brings low temperatures, many of the creatures that live there are nocturnal. They include fennec foxes, geckos, jerboas and caracals. A scorpion is shown fighting a black widow spider. During the day, the desert belongs to the reptiles, which rely on the sun to warm their bodies. The Sonoran Desert is home to the Gila monster, one of a few <b>poisonous</b> <b>lizards.</b> By mid-afternoon, it's so hot that even reptiles must escape the sun's rays. However, some birds have developed methods for keeping cool. The sandgrouse evaporates moisture by fluttering its throat, while the road runner also uses its tail as a parasol. Plants that are best adapted to the habitat are the creosote bush and cacti, of which the saguaro is one of the biggest. The nomadic Tuareg people cross the Sahara from one side to the other — but can't do so unaided. They rely on the camel for transportation, as much as it needs them to periodically dig for water. Despite this, it is one of the best adapted desert animals: it can go without water for ten times as long as a man.|$|R
50|$|A rise {{in tourism}} in Kuala Besar {{has led to}} the {{expansion}} of many different resorts and many options for snorkelers and divers alike. It is possible to get PADI certified at various locations and take advantage of the various wrecks and coral reefs. The Perhentian islands are home to numerous different species of monitor <b>lizards,</b> <b>poisonous</b> spiders, and geckos. In the water and on the coral reefs, sea turtles, clownfish, cuttlefish, blue spotted rays, and black tipped sharks swim freely among many others.|$|R
50|$|Dragonoid Soldier Jyaryu (2-49) are dragon-like warriors {{created by}} Ryuoon using {{his own blood}} and machinery. They wield swords and can summon {{hundreds}} of <b>poisonous</b> red <b>lizards</b> from their bodies. They are fewer in number {{when compared to the}} Curse, but more powerful. They are also capable of speech. Three piloted Dorudo before its destruction and all perished along with Dorudo. In Task 21, with Uchide's Mallet, Ryuoon made three of them grow to giant size. When the Boukengers formed Ultimate DaiBouken, he made them grow again, making them even twice the size of DaiBouken. However, Eiji reclaimed the Mallet for himself, and made Ultimate DaiBouken grow in size to even the odds. Ultimate DaiBouken's Ultimate Blaster finished two of the Jyaryu, and SirenBuilder, still normal size, jumped down the third's throat and finished it off from the inside. In Task 25, three Jyaryu made suggestions to Ryuoon for their kind's benefits after eating the Fruit of Knowledge. In the end, {{all but one of the}} Jyaryu were killed off in the ritual to create the last Wicked Dragon, or so it seemed. At the end of the final episode, two Jyaryu are seen battling Dark Shadow and the Boukengers for the Ru-Yi-Bang Precious to carry out their fallen leader's wishes. During the events of Kaizoku Sentai Gokaiger, the last remaining Jyaryu slaughtered a platoon of Zangyack soldiers before being destroyed in the process of reviving Ryuoon. The Jyaryu's design is based on Kyōryū Sentai Zyurangers Dragon Caesar.|$|R
