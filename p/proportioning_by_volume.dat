5000|$|In 1808 Gay-Lussac {{announced}} {{what was}} probably his single greatest achievement: {{from his own}} and others' experiments he deduced that gases at constant temperature and pressure combine in simple numerical <b>proportions</b> <b>by</b> <b>volume,</b> and the resulting product or products—if gases—also bear a simple <b>proportion</b> <b>by</b> <b>volume</b> to the volumes of the reactants. In other words, gases under equal conditions of temperature and pressure react {{with one another in}} volume ratios of small whole numbers. This conclusion subsequently became known as [...] "Gay-Lussac's law" [...] or the [...] "Law of Combining Volumes". With his fellow professor at the École Polytechnique, Louis Jacques Thénard, Gay-Lussac also participated in early electrochemical research, investigating the elements discovered by its means. Among other achievements, they decomposed boric acid by using fused potassium, thus discovering the element boron. The two also took part in contemporary debates that modified Lavoisier's definition of acids and furthered his program of analyzing organic compounds for their oxygen and hydrogen content.|$|R

In the form in which it was first enunciated, this hypothesis was incorrect--perhaps it is not exactly true in any form; but it is hardly too much to say that chemistry and molecular physics would never have advanced to their present condition unless it had been assumed to be true. Another immense service rendered by Dalton, as a corollary of the new atomic doctrine, was the creation of a system of symbolic notation, which not only made the nature of chemical compounds and processes easily intelligible and easy of recollection, but, by its very form, suggested new lines of inquiry. The atomic notation was as serviceable to chemistry as the binomial nomenclature and the classificatory schematism of Linnæus were to zoölogy and botany.|$|R

In the 1940 's Marshall explicitly addressed the volumetric percentages of air voids, Va, and {{of the degree of}} void saturation by asphalt, (VFA).

These various volumetric parameters have since formed a principal part of the Marshall design method and have, more recently been enshrined into the Superpave system. This paper seeks to revisit the definitions of the various volumetric parameters and their interrelationships. It develops an instructive and useful chart with which mixtures of different volumetric characteristics may be compared, and through trajectory analysis, reduced to a common basis.

40|$|Within the {{pharmaceutical}} industry there is current interest in the proximal colon as a site for drug delivery. Segmental contractions of the smooth colonic muscle are the most prevalent type; these promote the mixing of material within the lumen, which in turn aids absorption. Few physical or theoretical models {{have been developed to}} assist with the understanding of dosage form behaviour within the colon. We model the colon as a cylindrical pipe, whose boundary represents the circular muscle layer. Assuming the boundary is axisymmetric and that the contractions may be modelled by a standing wave of small amplitude, we employ a perturbation expansion to describe the behaviour of both one and two layer fluid flow using various rheological models. Utilising the results and Lagrangian particle tracking we create a model of drug delivery which analyses the <b>proportion,</b> <b>by</b> <b>volume,</b> of a drug reaching the colonic epithelium, discovering that the segmental contractions of the colon lead to effective mixing of the fluid. We investigate the results of varying the fluid rheology and contractile properties, finding that the amplitude of contraction has the largest effect on the proportion of particles absorbed. The results prove themselves robust to variation in contractile frequency, fluid viscosity and ratio between radius and wavelength, which is promising in terms of consistent drug delivery across a range of physiological states. ...|$|R

The findings revealed that the brake torque decreased by 9 % with 20 % CO 2 proportion in the mixture due to the decrease in the heating value of the mixture. At the same proportion of CO 2, the brake specific fuel consumption decreased by about 8. 5 % and the brake thermal efficiency increased by 9. 2 %.

This study evaluated {{the effect of adding}} GIC to MTA in terms of calcium release, an issue that has not been previously studied. Materials and methods: The study comprised four groups with five samples each: a control group of MTA alone and experimental groups I (1 MTA: 1 GIC), II (2 MTA: 1 GIC), and III (1 MTA: 2 GIC) based on the mixture of MTA and GIC powders in the respective <b>proportions</b> <b>by</b> <b>volume.</b> Calcium release from the samples was measured by atomic absorption spectrophotometry at 15  min, 6  h, 24  h, and 1  week after setting. The level of statistical significance was set at p <  0. 05. Results: Groups I (1 MTA: 1 GIC) and III (1 MTA: 2 GIC) released significantly less calcium than the control group at all time periods, except at 15  min for group I. Group II (2 MTA: 1 GIC) showed no significant difference in calcium release compared to the control at any time period. Group II exhibited greater calcium release than group I or III at all time periods, with significant differences between groups I and II at 1  week and between groups I and III at 24  h and 1  week. There were no statistical differences in calcium release between groups I and III. Conclusions: Adding GIC to improve the setting time and handling properties of the MTA powder can be detrimental to the calcium-releasing ability of the resultant mixture, depending on the proportion of GIC added. Adding MTA and GIC at a proportion of 2 : 1 <b>by</b> <b>volume</b> did not impact calcium release from the mixture. These findings should be verified through further clinical studies...|$|R

Wild-caught female Metapenaeus dalli Racek, 1957 from the Swan-Canning Estuary, Perth, Western Australia were used as a model species to compare the novel method to traditional techniques. Morphological analysis showed that ovarian development in M. dalli occurs in five stages: immature, early maturing, late maturing, mature, and post spawning, {{which is consistent with}} other penaeids. Analysis of key morphometric parameters of length and Gonad Somatic Index (GSI) showed that GSI provided the strongest discriminators of ovarian development. Oogenesis was similar to qualitative descriptions of other penaeid prawns and most-closely related to previous descriptions of Metapenaeus affinis Milne Edwards, 1837. Comparisons between the novel perimeter tracing and traditional single linear methods for measuring oocyte dimensions showed that greater precision was achieved by tracing.

40|$|Experimental {{studies have}} been carried out to compare the water {{permeability}} and chloride penetrability between lightweight aggregate concrete (LWAC) of different densities and normal weight concrete (NWC). Also, the influence of presoaking of lightweight aggregate prior to casting is presented. The lightweight and normal weight concrete had 28 -day compressive strength of ~ 40 - 50 MPa and had the same <b>proportion</b> of constituents <b>by</b> <b>volume.</b> The results show that the water permeability of the NWC is higher than that of LWAC, regardless of the density of the LWA used. For accelerated chloride penetration test, the chloride content in the first 20 mm from the surface varied slightly for the concrete with different aggregates. No definite trend was observed comparing different concretes. However, in the depth of more than 20 mm the chloride content for the concrete with different aggregates was similar. Due to the limited data available, no definite conclusion can be drawn in terms of the effect of the density and surface texture of lightweight aggregate on the water permeability and chloride penetration, and further study is needed...|$|R
30|$|The RCA {{concrete}} mixes, with a {{substitution of}} 23 % (S =  1) and 47 % (S =  2), <b>proportioned</b> <b>by</b> the EMV method, had strong resistance against the freeze-and-thaw action, being only less than 2 % {{lower than the}} companion mix, while the RCA concrete mix with a substitution of 47 %, <b>proportioned</b> <b>by</b> the conventional method, was 8 % higher than the companion mix. Conversely, in the RCA concrete mix with a substitution of 73 % (S =  3), <b>proportioned</b> <b>by</b> the modified EMV method, a reduction of 6 % in freeze-and-thaw resistance was observed {{in comparison to the}} RCA mix with a substitution of 47 %, <b>proportioned</b> <b>by</b> the conventional method. This was ascribed to too much reduction of the water, cement, and sand in comparison to the conventional mix.|$|R
