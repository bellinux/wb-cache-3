The ice contamination on the wings resulted in an aerodynamic stall and loss of control after lift-off. Contributing to the cause of the accident were the inappropriate procedures used by, and inadequate coordination between, the flight crew that led to a takeoff rotation at a lower than prescribed air speed.|$|E
500|$|Nazi pledges of nondiscrimination {{in sports}} proved {{inconsistent}} with their actions, {{such as the}} expulsion of Jews from sports clubs, and in September 1934, Brundage sailed for Germany to see for himself. He met with government officials and others, although he {{was not allowed to}} meet with Jewish sports leaders alone. When he returned, he reported, [...] "I was given <b>positive</b> <b>assurance</b> in writing... {{that there will be no}} discrimination against Jews. You can't ask more than that and I think the guarantee will be fulfilled." [...] Brundage's trip only increased the controversy over the question of US participation, with New York Congressman Emanuel Celler stating that Brundage [...] "had prejudged the situation before he sailed from America". Nevertheless, on September 26, 1934, after hearing a report from Brundage on conditions in Germany, the AOC voted to send a US team to Berlin.|$|E

40|$|Unlike today's {{reactive}} approaches, information ow based approaches {{can provide}} <b>positive</b> <b>assurances</b> about overall system integrity, and hence can defend against sophisticated malware. However, there hasn't been much success in applying information ow based tech-niques to desktop systems running modern COTS op-erating systems. This is, in part, {{due to the}} fact that a strict application of information ow policy can break existing applications and OS services. Another impor-tant factor is the diculty of policy development, which requires us to specify integrity labels for hundreds of thousands of objects on the system. This paper devel-ops a new approach for proactive integrity protection that overcomes these challenges by decoupling integrity labels from access policies. We then develop an analy-sis that can largely automate the generation of integrity labels and policies that preserve the usability of applica-tions in most cases. Evaluation of our prototype imple-mentation on a Linux desktop distribution shows that it does not break or inconvenience the use of most applica-tions, while stopping a variety of sophisticated malware attacks. 1...|$|R

But though confidence between them was, by this public discovery, restored to its proper state, it was not a subject on which either of them were fond of dwelling when alone. Elinor avoided it upon principle, as tending to fix still more upon her thoughts, by the too warm, too <b>positive</b> <b>assurances</b> of Marianne, that belief of Edward's continued affection for herself which she rather wished to do away; and Marianne's courage soon failed her, in trying to converse upon a topic which always left her more dissatisfied with herself than ever, by the comparison it necessarily produced between Elinor's conduct and her own.|$|R

40|$|The {{results of}} this study {{indicate}} significant differences in beliefs between auditors, users and preparers of prospective financial information, concerning forecast reliability and the role and responsibilities of auditors and management. Contrary to the usual published studies on expectation gap, it was found that auditors believe that forecasts are more reliable than users or preparers. Auditors also believe that they have a higher level of responsibility and accountability than is attributed to them by users or preparers. Beliefs were affected by the type of report issued by the auditor and subjects were able to discriminate between the level of <b>assurance</b> provided by <b>positive</b> and negative <b>assurance</b> opinions. However, based on the responses of shareholders, it appears that the negative assurance opinion on assumptions for an audit might confuse users and might not meet the demands of the market.

40|$|Objectives: This study {{aimed to}} {{determine}} the challenges encountered and strategies used by nurse preceptors to build effective professional relationships during the preceptorship of final year nursing students. Methods: This {{study was conducted in}} November 2012 at the College of Nursing in Sultan Qaboos University, Muscat, Oman. A qualitative research design consisting of focus group discussions was used to investigate the challenges that preceptors encounter and the strategies that they use to build effective relationships with preceptees. A total of 21 preceptors from Sultan Qaboos University Hospital participated in the study as part of a training workshop for nurse preceptors. The interviews were audio recorded, transcribed verbatim and thematically analysed. Results: The main challenges faced by preceptors included discrepancies in applying theory to practice; lack of trust; lack of time, and perceived lack of knowledge. The effective strategies identified by the preceptors to be used in building a healthy preceptor-preceptee relationship were proper orientation; effective communication; preparation for complex situations; appreciation and acknowledgment; <b>positive</b> feedback; <b>assurance</b> of support; spending time together; knowing preceptors personally; giving breaks, and encouraging self-commitment. Conclusion: Preceptors should be encouraged to identify challenges that hinder the building of effective relationships with preceptees early during their preceptorship. The incorporation of appropriate and evidenced-based strategies, such as those identified in this study, can transform the preceptorship experience into one that is fulfilling for both preceptors and preceptees. This may lead to greater job satisfaction, personal and professional growth as well as higher self-esteem levels for preceptors and the realisation of clinical objectives for preceptees...|$|R
