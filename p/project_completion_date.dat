25|$|A new {{interdisciplinary}} science {{building is}} currently in the planning stages. At a projected cost of $148 million, the new facility will house teaching labs, research labs, faculty offices, a dean's suite and interdisciplinary spaces totaling 160,000 gross square feet. The proposed project location is the southwest quadrant of campus north of Duncan Hall.

The new facility will be located on the main campus {{at the corner of}} 7th Street and San Carlos {{on the site of the}} old aquatic center, which was demolished in 2017.

50|$|CPM Total Float is {{measured}} by how much an activity may be delayed without delaying the <b>project</b> <b>completion</b> <b>date.</b> In GPM this is called float, with the distinction that it {{is measured}} with respect to planned dates rather than early dates. Thus, the GPM value of float plus drift is analogous to Total Float in CPM.|$|E
50|$|The World Trade Center Abu Dhabi is {{a complex}} of three skyscrapers, {{one of which is}} “supertall”, in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates.

50|$|To correct these problems, Earned Schedule theory {{represents}} {{the two measures}} SV and SPI in 2 separate domains: currency and time. They are named as SV($) and SPI($), to indicate they relate to currency; and SV(t) and SPI(t), to indicate they relate to time. A stated advantage of Earned Schedule methods is that no new data collection processes are required to implement and test Earned Schedule; it only requires updated formulas. Earned Schedule theory also provides updated formulas for predicting <b>project</b> <b>completion</b> <b>date,</b> using the time-based measures.|$|E
50|$|Another core idea {{is the use}} of the Monte Carlo {{method to}} predict <b>project</b> <b>completion</b> <b>dates.</b> This method evaluates how {{reliable}} previous estimates have been. Instead of a single <b>completion</b> <b>date,</b> the method results in multiple possible <b>completion</b> <b>dates,</b> each with an associated probability of being correct.|$|R

50|$|Just {{because a}} task {{is on the}} Critical Path all of the time, does not always mean that the task {{is going to be}} {{significant}} to the <b>project</b> <b>completion</b> <b>date.</b> For example a task that is only 1 day long is unlikely to affect the project finish but it can still have a 100% Criticality Index. To avoid this problem one must also measure the correlation between the duration of a task and the duration of the project. Spearman's Rank correlation or Pearson's Product Moment can be used to measure the correlation.|$|E
5000|$|The entire highway from Kathmandu to Bardibas via Dhulikhel had a <b>project</b> <b>completion</b> <b>date</b> of 2011, for a {{total of}} 158 km. It now is {{projected}} to be finished in March 2015 [...] The reasons for the delay include Japanese contractors lack of security for explosives, thus the road was created with manual labor, which later there was an admission that this was a mistake., as well as parliament gridlock. This alternate route will reduce the journey from Kathmandu to Bardibas and other cities east of Bardibas by at least 200 km.|$|E
50|$|By May 2013, with a newly {{installed}} Premier, {{the project}} was significantly reworked and renamed the Melbourne Rail Link under Premier Denis Napthine. The line would run from Southern Cross station to South Yarra station, with stations at Fishermans Bend (to be known as Montague Station) and Domain Interchange, with significant modifications made to the City Loop to allow for bi-directional running. Stations at Parkville and {{the northern and southern}} ends of the CBD were scrapped in favour of avoiding years of disruption along Swanston Street. Coupled with {{the project was}} the long-awaited plan to build a heavy rail link to Melbourne Airport, which would be subsequently incorporated into the newly reworked project. By this time, the <b>project</b> <b>completion</b> <b>date</b> had been extended to 2026 with no additional Federal Government funding allocation.

5000|$|In {{the spring}} of 1882, the Wisconsin State Legislature {{approved}} $200,000 for {{the extension of the}} Wisconsin State Capitol. An architectural competition was held and Jones was awarded the commission. In May of that year bids were sought, with a <b>project</b> <b>completion</b> <b>date</b> of January 1, 1884. Twice the project went out for bids only to exceed the $200,000 approved by the state legislature. Twice Jones was requested to revise the plans in order to bring down the bids. One of the revisions eliminated the octagonal towers and the lower ranks of iron columns were replaced with stone piers. Eventually the firm of Bentley and Nowlan were the successful bidders with a bid of $188,370. By late 1883 the north wing was all but completed. The south wing had some additional work to be structurally complete. On November 8th, at 1:40 pm the south wing collapsed, trapping and killing 8 workmen and injuring many others. Immediately after, Governor Jeremiah Rusk called together a group of specialist to determine the cause. The group was made up of A.C. Nash, a prominent architect from Ohio, Godfrey Ludwig, the superintendent of public buildings for Cincinnati Ohio, C.F. Struck architect from Minneapolis, and J.R. Willett an architect from Chicago. Their report placed the blame on substandard materials, specifically the cast iron columns. The day after the disaster, a coroner’s inquest was impaneled. That inquest was led by Dane County District Attorney Robert M. La Follette. [...] "The panel found Nowlan culpable of [...] "improperly and insufficiently" [...] repairing a fault in the second-story pier near the southeast corner of the extension, which they found to have contributed to the falling of the south wing. They also found D. R. Jones and a consulting Milwaukee architect, Henry C. Koch, guilty of negligence [...] "in designing the internal construction of the said south wing of the Capitol Extension without a due and proper regard for the safety during the erection [...] [...] [...]" ...|$|E
30|$|In {{reference}} to the project duration, the first criterion set is that the <b>project</b> <b>completion</b> <b>date</b> must be, as much as possible, equal to or earlier than the specified required <b>project</b> <b>completion</b> <b>date.</b> The required <b>project</b> <b>completion</b> <b>date</b> {{is up to the}} project manager to be specified and may depend on several considerations. This requirement is such that any project completion later than this has low value. Thus, the required <b>project</b> <b>completion</b> <b>date</b> serves as a limit or deadline on how late the completion of the project can be. In {{reference to}} the fluctuations in the daily resource requirements, the second criterion set is that the fluctuations in the daily resource requirements should be minimized. Thus, time and fluctuations in the daily resource requirement optimization should arrive at the set of shifting amount of activity that results in a valid <b>project</b> <b>completion</b> <b>date</b> and have the minimum fluctuations in the daily resource requirements.|$|E

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Program evaluation and review techniques (PERT) is an efficient tool for large project management. In actual project control decisions, classical PERT, which is based upon beta distribution, presents a few deficiencies. Generally speaking, classical PERT is explained as the probabilistic approach. On the other hand, activity times in the possibilistic approach such as fuzzy PERT are defined as fuzzy variables instead of random variables used in the traditional probabilistic approaches, which the classical PERT and Monte Carlo simulation. Through this study, we present one way of project scheduling using fuzzy PERT, and apply the possibilistic approach to addressing the uncertainty of a <b>project</b> <b>completion</b> <b>date.</b> Moreover, in fuzzy PERT, we find multiple possible critical paths through a case network, overcoming the shortcomings in the classical PERT, in which critical path is a single and deterministic path, and apply the concept in fuzzy set theory to risk assessment for a <b>project</b> <b>completion</b> <b>date.</b> In recent years, fuzzy PERT methods have been proposed based on possibility theory and fuzzy set theory and developed as an alternate approach to probability theory for quantifying the uncertainty related to activity times. This paper illustrates a straightforward approach for applying fuzzy calculations to address and assess project schedule uncertainty compared with the probabilistic approach, Monte Carlo method...|$|E
