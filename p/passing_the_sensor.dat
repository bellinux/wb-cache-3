40|$|After {{several years}} of {{research}} in winter road condition classification, an automated prototype has been tested. Classification is achieved with artificial neural networks {{based on data from}} either images of the road, acoustic signals of vehicles <b>passing</b> <b>the</b> <b>sensor,</b> or a combination of the two. Systems based on either images or signals give good results for some road condition classes, but the most reliable results are for the hybrid system. Hybrid results are reliable for icy, snowy, and wet road conditions but not for dry. Dry results can be improved with more representative training data and/or further integration with other RWIS sensors.

50|$|The {{combination}} of both approaches (acoustic and infrared) assists in overcoming each system's own limitations while improving the overall capability to eliminate false declarations of gunshots and/or ambiguous declaration locations. Even when these combined systems are employed, shots fired from far enough away will not be detected because the amount of gunshot signal (both acoustic and Infrared) eventually fades into the background signals. For acoustic systems that require the supersonic shock wave for location determination, the bullet must still be traveling at supersonic speed when it <b>passes</b> <b>the</b> <b>sensor,</b> and it must <b>pass</b> <b>the</b> <b>sensor</b> within <b>the</b> lateral span of the shock wave.

40|$|The {{development}} of streamwise-orientated disturbances at transition onset for zero-pressure gradient boundary layer flow {{under the influence}} of 1. 3 % freestream turbulence intensity is presented. The analysis concentrates on the {{development of}} turbulent spots and other coherent structures with the use of wavelet analysis. The turbulent spot structure is shown to change dramatically in shape, sign of perturbation velocity and energy content from the near wall region to the boundary layer edge. An increased number of turbulent structures are observed near the boundary layer edge, all with negative perturbation velocities, compared to those of positive perturbation velocity in the near wall region. The wavelet maps demonstrate some interesting features of turbulent spot development including regions of high frequency disturbance growth prior to the spot <b>passing</b> <b>the</b> <b>sensor.</b> Distributions of peak negative, peak positive and averaged perturbation velocities were obtained at three streamwise positions prior to transition onset. As transition onset approached the magnitude of the negative value far exceeded the positive and their relative positions within the boundary layer changed considerably. The results presented in this report give further insight into the physics of pre-transitional flow illustrating the influence of negative perturbation velocity in the transition process. Furthermore, the importance of peak instantaneous perturbations compared to averaged values is also demonstrated, a feature of the flow that computational techniques will have to model in order to accurately predict transition phenomena.

40|$|Traffic {{safety is}} a big concern of many modern societies. Every year, car {{accidents}} cause many injuries and fatalities. This has aected many car manufacturers and governments equally. While governments try {{to reduce the number}} of accidents by educating drivers or imposing regulations, car manufacturers have successfully incorporated diverse safety functions such as seat belts, anti-lock breaking systems, or airbags in their vehicles. Recent advances in communication technologies have given rise to new approaches for advancing vehicular safety even more: having vehicles and the road infrastructure communicating with each other will enable new safety systems that can also take the behavior of other road users into consideration. The information provided by the infrastructure stems from roadside sensors that continuously measure traffic and track vehicles. Parameters of interest are, among others, vehicle class or vehicle speed. Clearly, many sensors for estimating these parameters exist. However, these are often too limited, too expensive for maintenance, or not developed well enough in order to be deployed in large scale. For example, vision-based systems can provide very comprehensive information, as long as the line of sight is not obstructed and enough computational resources are available. On the other hand, miniaturized sensors are becoming more and more popular in conjunction with wireless sensor networks. This approach is also put forth in this work. The aim of the thesis is to examine the potential of using accelerometers mounted on the road surface for estimating parameters of vehicles <b>passing</b> <b>the</b> <b>sensor.</b> In the four research papers composing this thesis, it is shown that this novel approach is viable. First, the feasibility is analyzed based on measurements of real traffic and research challenges are identied. The two rst applications are derived from that: vehicle detection and wheelbase estimation, where the latter can only be achieved under the knowledge of a vehicle's speed. Then, the underlying mechanisms, namely wave propagation in the road is examined in a system identication framework. It is found that Lamb waves, that is, waves in a thin plate, are predominant and a model for describing this is proposed. Finally, an Extended Kalman Filter for vehicle tracking based on a moving constant force and the wave propagation model is proposed. As a result, estimations of the vehicle velocity and wheelbase are automatically obtained. It is indicated that future research should further rene the physical model of the source (vehicle) as well as the wave propagation and also improve the proposed Kalman Filter. Furthermore, there is still a lot of potential in exploiting other features of the measured signal.

Compared to existing inductive loop based traffic <b>sensors,</b> <b>the</b> new <b>sensor</b> is expected to provide increased reliability, easy installation and low maintenance costs. <b>The</b> <b>sensor</b> uses power only for wireless transmission and has ZERO idle power loss. Hence <b>the</b> <b>sensor</b> {{is expected to be}} extremely energy efficient.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{fundamentals of}} a new method for monitoring of technical condition demonstrated by blades of rotor machines during operation thereof. The method involves the diagnostic model expressed as a quotient of the amplitude amplification for the diagnostic signal y(t) that results from the blade impact and the signal x(t) produced by the blade surrounding when the blade tip approaches <b>the</b> <b>sensor,</b> divided by <b>the</b> amplitude amplification of these signals when the blade tip has already <b>passed</b> <b>the</b> <b>sensor</b> position and moves away.

50|$|The main subprocesses of sensor-based sorting are {{material}} conditioning, material presentation, detection, {{data processing}} and separation. Material conditioning includes all operations which prepare the particles for being detected by <b>the</b> <b>sensor.</b> All optical sensors need clean material {{to be able}} to detect optical characteristics. Conditioning includes screening and cleaning of the feed material. The aim of the material presentation is the isolation of the particles by creating a single particle layer with the densest surface cover possible without particles touching each other and enough distance to each other allowing for a selective detection and rejection of each single particle. There are two types of sensor-based sorters: the chute type and the belt type. For both types the first step in acceleration is spreading out the particles by a vibrating feeder followed by either a fast belt or a chute. On the belt type <b>the</b> <b>sensor</b> usually detects <b>the</b> particles horizontally while they <b>pass</b> it on <b>the</b> belt.

40|$|Recent {{developments}} {{have seen the}} introduction of multiple Eddy Current Sensors (ECS) into turbomachinery. These sensors employ an active magnetic field to monitor each blade as it <b>passes</b> <b>the</b> <b>sensor.</b> They generate an electrical signal proportional to the distance of a blade from <b>the</b> <b>sensor.</b> Existing algorithms extract two pieces of information from the ECS signature, signal magnitude and signal zero crossing time. The signal magnitude is used to find tip clearance, and the zero crossing time is used to estimate vibrational parameters {{over the course of}} multiple revolutions. These techniques fail to exploit the majority of the information contained in the ECS signal. In this research, a novel residue characterization algorithm was developed that processes the full ECS pulse to produce a residue. The residue is a speed independent representation of differences between a baseline ECS pulse and an experimental ECS pulse. A mathematical model of the relationship between blade displacement and residue was developed. Empirical data collected with the MIT spin pit were used to verify convergence of the model with the residue characterization algorithm. This strongly suggests blade vibration can be deduced using the residue characterization method with a single ECS sensor. by Eric D. Cohen. Thesis (M. Eng.)

The luminescence characteristics and the optimal conditions were investigated in detail. <b>The</b> gas <b>sensor</b> showed high selectivity for dimethyl ether at 620 nm and satisfying activity at 210 ℃ under the optimized conditions. The linear range of cataluminescence intensity versus concentration of dimethyl ether was 5 ~ 120 mg/m 3, and the detection limit (3 σ) was 3 mg/m 3. No or weak interference was observed while the foreign substances, such as formaldehyde, ammonia, ethanol, benzene, carbon monoxide and sulfur dioxide, were <b>passing</b> through <b>the</b> <b>sensor</b> under selected conditions. <b>The</b> gas <b>sensor</b> displayed good stability for continuously introducing dimethyl ether over 100 h, and allowed real-time monitoring of dimethyl ether in air...|$|R
