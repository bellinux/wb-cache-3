40|$|Simulating a {{human figure}} {{performing}} a task {{requires that the}} agent interact with objects in the environment in a realistic manner. In this paper we describe a system which directs task-level, general-purpose, object grasping for a simulated human agent. The Object Specific Reasoner (OSR) generates parameters for underspecified task-level instructions such as (<b>pickup</b> <b>jack</b> hammer). The Grasp behavior manages simultaneous motions of the joints in the hand, wrist and arm. When composed hierarchically, the OSR and the Grasp behavior interpret task-level commands to the animation system. These modules are implemented {{as part of the}} Jack project at the University of Pennsylvania...|$|E

5000|$|It has a 1972 Telecaster {{body with}} 2 humbucking pickups, one volume knob, a Fender neckplate, and a Telecaster Deluxe headstock. At first the Telecaster {{had only one}} pickup in the bridge, the Seymour Duncan SH-4 JB Humbucker. This model was first used during the tour for Sum 41's third album [...] "Chuck". A second pickup was later on, the Antiquity JB Model Humbucker but then was {{replaced}} by a Wide Range Humbucker pickup in the neck while leaving the bridge pickup the same. His current model is with Seymour Duncan and Wide Range <b>pickups.</b> The input <b>jack</b> is custom made onto the pickguard rather than a side input jack. The body is featured without the traditional pickup selector switch. The neck's tuning machines are Fender American Standard Series Tuning Machines. The guitar also features red X's that Whibley states [...] "Are there for good luck and design". Whibley uses a Get'm Get'm Sergeant guitar strap with chrome Schaller Strap Locks. There is only one color for the Telecaster Deluxe model (Black body with Black pickguard) but comes either black on black or Olympic White body with Black pickguard for the Squier models.|$|R
5000|$|The Gibson Robot Guitar (a.k.a. GOR) is a limited-edition self-tuning Gibson guitar, {{typically}} a Les Paul. The first run of limited edition Robot Guitars was exclusively {{made up of}} Les Paul bodies. Five different Gibson models were available (2008-2011, Robot X-plorer 2008-2012)) with Robot Guitar features: The Robot Les Paul Studio, Robot SG, Robot Flying V, Robot X-plorer, and a Robot Les Paul Junior. Developed by Chris Adams, its most notable feature is that it uses an onboard computer to automatically tune itself. This {{is not the first}} guitar to be able to tune itself, but it is regarded as the most modern, unique, and non-invasive self-tuning model available, because it does not employ cams or cantilevers throughout the body of the guitar. The non-limited edition SG and Les Paul Studio are available in a variety of finishes. The Flying V and Explorer are only available in metallic red. The price can range from about $1,000-$3,000 or more for custom options. In the case of the [...] "Original 1st Production" [...] Robot guitar the only finish available was Blue Silverburst nitrocellulose, a color which Gibson has stated will never be used on any other Gibson guitar (see photo to the right). The original Robot guitar also featured headstock and neck binding which are not standard on any current Les Paul Robot as well as a chrome truss rod cover with [...] "Robot Guitar" [...] engraved. The production version featured 22-fret rosewood-bound (standard finishes) or white-bound (metallic finishes) ebony fingerboard with figured acrylic tapezoid inlays, white-bound headstock with MOP Gibson logo and flowerpot inlay (metallic finishes) or unbound headstock with screened logo (standard finishes), three-per-side robotic Powerhead Locking tuners, tune-o-matic Powertune bridge, Powertune stop tailpiece, two chrome covered humbucker pickups (490R, 498T), four knobs (three normal, and one Master Control Knob that controls the robotic actions of the guitar), three-way <b>pickup</b> switch, Neutrik <b>jack</b> on side of guitar, chrome hardware.|$|R
