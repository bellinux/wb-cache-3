40|$|From {{a minimal}} set made of four scale factors defined at the liquid-gas {{critical}} {{point of a}} pure fluid, and one adjustable parameter which accounts for particle quantum effects, we demonstrate here a master singular behavior of the correlation length for the one-component fluid subclass, using an asymptotic scale dilatation of the physical fields. Such master behavior observed within the preasymtotic domain is in conformity with the renormalized Φ_d = 3 ^ 4 Field Theory predictions at large correlation length scale of the fluctuating order parameter, for the complete universality class of the symmetrical uniaxial 3 D-Ising-like systems. The following consequences are discussed: (i) A comparison between the critical state of pure fluids and the zero-temperature state leads to an intuitive analogy with the (Nerst) third law of thermo- dynamics, which authorizes specific master form for hyperscaling within the subclass of pure fluids; (ii) A master constant value of the non-dimensional critical entropy can exist for all the pure fluids at the short-ranged lengthscale of the molecular interaction.

The mean hole volume, vh, varies in PS between 105 Å 3 (27 [*]°C) and 220 Å 3 (190 [*]°C), and shows a systematic decrease with increasing AN content, at Tg from 121 Å 3 for PS to 102 (± 2) Å 3 for SAN 50.

30|$|This {{method is}} rooted in the {{differences}} of sonic wave speeds in various fluid phases. It is known that the denser the fluid is, the faster the sonic wave moves. Thus, it is expected that the phase transition (i.e., from liquid to solid, asphaltene precipitation, or from liquid to gas, gas liberation) could be detected from response of fluids to acoustic waves propagating through them. Using this technique, the onset of asphaltene precipitation pressure can be detected for a live oil system undergoing depressurization steps (Carrier et al. 2000). In ART for asphaltene onset precipitation measurement, the output response {{is in the form of}} resonance frequency. It is known that changes in sonic wave speed, which is associated with phase transition, influence resonance frequency and therefore acoustic response (Jamaluddin et al. 2002). This technique is schematically shown in Fig.  24. The main element of the setup is a HPHT cylindrical resonator. Acoustic wave is sent through the fluid in resonator via a transmitter which is located at the top end of the system. Response signals are detected in a receiver at the other end of the resonator. These responses pass through a low noise pre-amplifier and finally are processed through an analog to digital convertor. A data acquisition and recording system is used to control the whole setup, control the acoustic stimulation of transmitter, collect and record the operational variables such as <b>pressure,</b> <b>volume,</b> <b>temperature,</b> and response signals (Kabir and Jamaluddin 1999).|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the effectiveness of}} the CO 2 injection process at different periods during gas-condensate reservoir development. Taking a real gas-condensate reservoir located in China's east region as an example, first, we conducted experiments of constant composition expansion (CCE), constant volume depletion (CVD), saturation pressure determination, and single flash. Next, a series of water/CO 2 flooding experiments were been investigated, including water flooding at present pressure 15  MPa, CO 2 flooding at 25. 53  MPa, 15  MPa, which repents initial pressure and present pressure respectively. Finally, the core flooding numerical model was constructed using a generalized equation-of-state model reservoir simulator (GEM) to reveal miscible flooding mechanism and the seepage flow characteristics in the condensate gas reservoir with CO 2 injection. A desirable agreement achieved in experimental results and predicted <b>pressure</b> <b>volume</b> <b>temperature</b> (PVT) properties by the modified equation of state (EOS) in the CVD and CCE tests indicated that the proposed recombination method can successfully produce a fluid with the same phase behavior of initial reservoir fluid with an acceptable accuracy. The modeling results confirm the experimental results, and both methods indicate that significant productivity loss can occur in retrograde gas condensate reservoirs when the flowing bottom-hole pressure falls below dew point pressure. Moreover, the results show that CO 2 treatment can improve gas productivity by a factor of about 1. 39 compared with the water flooding mode. These results may help reservoir engineers and specialists to restore the lost productivity of gas condensate...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. New {{equations}} for {{calculating the}} Gas Deviation Factor (z) and the Compressibility of Nigerian Natural Gas have been developed. The equation for the Gas Deviation Factor was developed from {{a plot of}} the logarithm of the ratio of Pressure to Temperature versus the logarithm of {{the ratio of the}} Pressure to the Gas Deviation Factor [...] The plot gave a linear relationship that gave the Gas Deviation Factor equation. A differentiation of the Gas Deviation Factor equation produced the new equation for calculating the Gas Compressibility. Values from the new equation for calculating the Gas Deviation Factor were compared with experimental <b>Pressure,</b> <b>Volume,</b> <b>Temperature</b> (PVT) measurements and the following statistical measurements of accuracy were obtained: Average percent error of 3. 050, average absolute percent error of 3. 649 and standard deviation of 3. 910. Over 75 % data tested showed error less than 5 %. A big advantage of the new equations is that they are simple and do not require pseudo critical pressure and pseudo critical temperature needed to obtain z from the current popular equations of state used in the Oil Industry.

40|$|The {{subject of}} this thesis is {{modeling}} of the manufacturing process of high voltage power cables {{with the aim of}} predicting residual stresses and strains in the cable insulation. The studied material is cross-linked polyethylene (XLPE), which at room temperature is a semi-crystalline viscoelastic solid. Above the crystallization temperature the material exhibits a rubber type behavior due to the crosslinks. An extensive set of uniaxial tensile relaxation tests were used for the mechanical characterization of XLPE. These experiments were complemented by <b>pressure</b> <b>volume</b> <b>temperature</b> experiments as well as density and crystallinity measurements. Based on the experiments, initially a linear and later a non-linear viscoelastic power law model was formulated, incorporating temperature and crystallinity dependence. The non-linear model is based on the Schapery formulation. Evaluations of the model were performed with additional uniaxial experiments. These included comparisons between predicted stress responses and measured values during relaxation tests with transient temperature histories, during two step relaxation experiments and during uniaxial tests with constant strain rate loading. The initial modeling work focused on the prediction of residual stresses which develop during the cooling stage of the manufacturing process. As the constitutive model incorporates temperature and crystallinity dependence, the mechanical problem is coupled to the heat transfer and crystallization problems. Calculations were performed for a vertical manufacturing line. The effects of a viscoelastic material model are illustrated by a comparison to a stress state predicted by a thermo-elastic material model. A final study concerns the modeling of the residual strains in the insulation. It was found that strains originating at cross-linking of the molecules play a signifi- cant role for buildup of residual strains. Calculations are performed for the same vertical process line as before. Good agreement was found between predicted and experimentally obtained residual strains. Based on the residual strain state an estimate is made for the upper limit of shrink-back of the cable insulation. QC 20100915 </p...|$|E

40|$|As the {{conventional}} reservoirs decrease in discovering, producing and reserving, unconventional reservoirs are more remarkable {{in terms of}} discovering, development and having more reserve. More fields have been discovered where Barnett Shale and Bakken Shale are the most recently unconventional reservoir examples. Shale reservoirs are typically considered self-sourcing and have very low permeability ranging from 10 - 100 nanodarcies. Over the past few decades, numerous research projects and developments have been studied, but it seems {{there is still some}} contention and misunderstanding surrounding shale reservoirs. One of the largest shale in the United State is the Bakken Shale play. This study will describe the primary geologic characteristics, field development history, reservoir properties,and especially production trends, over the Bakken Shale play. Data are available for over hundred wells from different companies. Most production data come from the Production Data Application (HDPI) database and in the format of monthly production for oil, water and gas. Additional 95 well data including daily production rate, completion, <b>Pressure</b> <b>Volume</b> <b>Temperature</b> (PVT), pressure data are given from companies who sponsor for this research study. This study finds that there are three Types of well production trends in the Bakken formation. Each decline curve characteristic has an important meaning to the production trend of the Bakken Shale play. In the Type I production trend, the reservoir pressure drops below bubble point pressure and gas releasingout of the solution. With the Type II production trend, oil flows linearly from the matrix into the fracture system, either natural fracture or hydraulic fracture. Reservoir pressure is higher than the bubble point pressure during the producing time and oil flows as a single phase throughout the production period of the well. A Type III production trend typically has scattering production data from wells with a different Type of trend. It is difficult to study this Type of behavior because of scattering data, which leads to erroneous interpretation for the analysis. These production Types, especially Types I and II will give a new type curve matches for shale oil wells above or below the bubble point...|$|E
40|$|Space Station and {{satellite}} reservicing {{will require the}} ability to vent gas on orbit from liquid supply or storage tanks and to gage liquid quantity under microgravity conditions. In zero gravity, (zero-g) the vortex vent is capable of venting gas from a tank of liquid containing gas randomly distributed as bubbles. The concept uses a spinning impeller to create centrifugal force inside a vortex tube within a tank. This creates a gas pocket and forces the liquid through a venturi {{and back into the}} tank. Gas is then vented from the gas pocket through a liquid detector and then out through an exhaust port. If the liquid detector senses liquid in the vent line, the fluid is directed to the low-pressure port on the venturi and is returned to the tank. The advantages of this system is that it has no rotating seals and is compatible with most corrosive and cryogenic fluids. A prototype was designed and built at the NASA Johnson Space Center and flown on the KC- 135 zero-g aircraft. During these test flights, where microgravity conditions are obtained for up to 30 sec, the prototype demonstrated that less than 0. 10 percent of the volume of fluid vented was liquid when the tank was half full of liquid. The <b>pressure</b> <b>volume</b> <b>temperature</b> (PVT) gaging system is used in conjunction with the vortex vent to calculate the amount of liquid remaining in a tank under microgravity conditions. The PVT gaging system is used in conjunction with the vortex vent to gage liquid quantity in zero or low gravity. The system consists of a gas compressor, accumulator, and temperature and pressure instrumentation. To measure the liquid in a tank a small amount of gas is vented from the tank to the compressor and compressed into the accumulator. Pressure and temperature in the tank and accumulator are measured before and after the gas transfer occurs. Knowing the total volume of the tank, the volume of the accumulator, the volume of the intermediate lines, and initial and final pressures and temperatures, the mass of the gas leaving the tank is equated to the mass of the gas entering the accumulator. The volume of liquid remaining in the tank is calculated using the ideal gas law...|$|E
40|$|A {{critical}} {{issue in the}} development of gas condensate reservoirs is accurate prediction of well deliverability. In this investigation a procedure has been developed for accurate prediction of well production rates using semi-empirical approach. The use of state of the art fine grid numerical simulation is time consuming and computationally demanding, therefore not suitable for real time rapid production management decisions required on site. Development of accurate fit-for-purpose correlations for fluid property prediction below the saturation pressure was a major consideration to properly allow for retrograde condensation, complications of multiphase flow and mobility issues. Previous works are limited to use of experimentally measured <b>pressure,</b> <b>volume,</b> <b>temperature</b> (PVT) property data, together with static relative permeability correlations for simulation of well deliverability. To overcome the above limitations appropriate fluid property correlations required for prediction of well deliverability and dynamic three phase relative permeability correlation have been developed to enable forecasting of these properties at all the desired reservoir conditions The developed correlations include; condensate hybrid compressibility factor, viscosity, density, compositional pseudo-pressure, and dynamic three phase relative permeability. The study made use of published data bases of experimentally measured gas condensate PVT properties and three phase relative permeability data. The developed correlations have been implemented in both vertical and horizontal well models and parametric studies have been performed to determine the critical parameters that control productivity in gas condensate reservoirs, using specific case studies. The improved correlations showed superior performance over existing correlations on validation. The investigation has built on relevant literature to present an approach that modifies the black oil model for accurate well deliverability prediction for condensate reservoirs at conditions normally ignored by the conventional approach. The original contribution to knowledge and practice includes (i) the improved property correlations equations, (4. 44, 4. 47, 4. 66, 4. 69, 4. 75, 5. 21) and (ii) extension of gas rate equations, for condensate rate prediction in both vertical and horizontal wells. Standard industry software, the Eclipse compositional model, E- 300 has been used to validate the procedure. The results show higher well performance compared with the industry standard. The new procedure is able to model well deliverability with limited PVT and rock property data which is not possible with most available methods. It also makes possible evaluation of various enhanced hydrocarbon recovery techniques and optimisation of gas condensate recovery. Petroleum Technology Development Fund (PTDF) Nigeri...|$|E
