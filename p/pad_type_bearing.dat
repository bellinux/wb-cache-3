The bearing design is of the flexible <b>pad</b> <b>type.</b> <b>Bearing</b> design {{analyses were conducted to}} assure a stable rotor bearing system, along with possible improvement in bearing performance relative to the five shoe tilting pad journal bearing and taperland thrust bearing system. Performance characteristics of both the radial and thrust bearings were measured at different bearing loads, and compared with the predicted results. Comparison of the bearing performance parameters were also made with the five shoe tilting pad journal and taperland thrust bearing system. Performance parameters included lubricant temperature rise between the oil inlet and discharge, oil flow, frictional power loss, and bearing pad metal temperature. Rotor bearing stability characteristics were evaluated at different loads to assure and verify a stable rotor bearing configuration. Predicted rotor response was also compared with those obtained during the test. The test results showed that the flexible pad bearing system resulted in a lower oil temperature rise, and frictional power loss over the five shoe tilting pad journal and taperland thrust bearing system. The flexible pad rotor bearing system was also found to be stable, and that the observed peak response correlated well with prediction...|$|E

The existence of four isoforms of <b>PAD</b> (<b>types</b> I, II, III and IV) encoded by four different genes, which are distinct in their substrate specificities and tissue-specific expression, was reported in rodents. In the present study, starting from epidermis polyadenylated RNA, we cloned by reverse transcriptase-PCR a full-length cDNA encoding human <b>PAD</b> <b>type</b> I. The cDNA was 2711 bp in length and encoded a 663 -amino-acid sequence. The predicted protein shares 75 % identity with the rat <b>PAD</b> <b>type</b> I sequence, but displays only 50 - 57 % identity with the three other known human isoforms. We have described {{the organization of the}} human <b>PAD</b> <b>type</b> I gene on chromosome 1 p 36. A recombinant <b>PAD</b> <b>type</b> I was produced in Escherichia coli and shown to be enzymically active. Human <b>PAD</b> <b>type</b> I mRNAs were detected by reverse transcriptase-PCR not only in the epidermis, but also in various organs, including prostate, testis, placenta, spleen and thymus. In human epidermis extracts analysed by Western blotting, <b>PAD</b> <b>type</b> I was detected as a 70 kDa polypeptide, in agreement with its predicted molecular mass. As shown by immunohistochemistry, the enzyme was expressed in all the living layers of human epidermis, with the labelling being increased in the granular layer. This is the first description of the human <b>PAD</b> <b>type</b> I gene and the first demonstration of its expression in epidermis...|$|R

40|$|Citrullination {{preferentially}} proceeds in glomerular Bowman's capsule {{and increases}} in obstructive nephropathy. BackgroundPeptidylarginine deiminases (PADs) are a group of posttranslational modification enzymes that citrullinate (deiminate) protein arginine residues, yielding citrulline residues. Citrullination of arginine residues abolishes their positive charge, markedly altering their structure. We undertook this study to investigate the actions of PADs in the kidney. MethodsIn male rats, we ligated the unilateral ureter, then analyzed the obstructed and contralateral kidneys 1 week later. Controls were rats simultaneously given sham operations. In another experiment, we ligated unilateral ureters of eight rats, four of which received a ureter-bladder anastomosis 1 week later. These rats were subjected to histologic examinations 5 weeks after unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO). ResultsReverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) revealed that, of <b>PADs</b> (<b>type</b> I, II, III, and IV), only <b>PAD</b> <b>type</b> II was expressed in kidneys. Western blot study showed that <b>PAD</b> <b>type</b> II expression and citrullinated protein content increased greatly in kidneys that underwent unilateral ureteral ligation compared to that in contralateral or sham-operated kidneys. Immunohistochemical analyses revealed that <b>PAD</b> <b>type</b> II was preferentially expressed by parietal epithelial cells and that only in Bowman's capsule were proteins citrullinated. Additionally, these <b>PAD</b> <b>type</b> II and citrullinated proteins in obstructed nephropathy were significantly attenuated by {{the release of the}} obstruction. Proteome analysis revealed that one of citrullinated proteins in the kidney should be actin. ConclusionThis result indicates that <b>PAD</b> <b>type</b> II and citrullinated proteins are suitable markers of Bowman's capsule. Not only are these markers preferentially expressed in Bowman's capsules but their expression is also increased in damaged kidneys by UUO, features that promise the further clarification of kidney diseases...|$|R

40|$|Aims. We here {{investigated}} {{the association of}} different types of periampullary diverticula (PAD) with pancreaticobiliary disease and with technical success of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). Methods. A total of 850 consecutive patients who underwent their first ERCP were entered into a database. Of these patients, 161 patients (18. 9 %) had PAD and the age- and sex-matched control group comprised 483 patients. Results. PAD was correlated with common bile duct (CBD) stones (59. 6 % versus 35. 0 % in controls; P= 0. 008) and negatively correlated with periampullary malignancy (6. 8 % versus 21. 5 % in controls; P= 0. 004). The acute pancreatitis was more frequent (62. 5 %) in patients with <b>PAD</b> <b>type</b> 1 followed by <b>PAD</b> <b>type</b> 2 (28. 9 %, P= 0. 017) and type 3 (28. 0 %, P= 0. 006). No significant differences were observed in successful cannulation rate and post-ERCP complications among the 3 <b>types</b> of <b>PAD.</b> <b>Type</b> 1 <b>PAD</b> patients had less recurrence of CBD stones than did the patients who had type 2 or <b>type</b> 3 <b>PAD</b> (53. 8 % versus 85. 7 %; P= 0. 043). Conclusions. <b>PAD,</b> especially <b>type</b> 1 <b>PAD,</b> is associated with an increased acute pancreatitis as well as occurrence and recurrence of CBD stones.

40|$|Analysis of {{particle}} pitch angle distributions (PADs) {{has been used}} as a means to comprehend a multitude of different physical mechanisms that lead to flux variations in the Van Allen belts and also to particle precipitation into the upper atmosphere. In this work we developed a neural network-based data clustering methodology that automatically identifies distinct <b>PAD</b> <b>types</b> in an unsupervised way using particle flux data. One can promptly identify and locate three well-known <b>PAD</b> <b>types</b> in both time and radial distance, namely, 90 deg peaked, butterfly, and flattop distributions. In order to illustrate the applicability of our methodology, we used relativistic electron flux data from the whole month of November 2014, acquired from the Relativistic Electron-Proton Telescope instrument on board the Van Allen Probes, but it is emphasized that our approach can also be used with multiplatform spacecraft data. Our PAD classification results are in reasonably good agreement with those obtained by standard statistical fitting algorithms. The proposed methodology has a potential use for Van Allen belt's monitoring...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Recent data {{indicate}} that loss-of-function mutation in the gene encoding the facilitative glucose transporter GLUT 10 (SLC 2 A 10) causes arterial tortuosity syndrome via upregulation of the TGF-Î² pathway in the arterial wall, a mechanism possibly causing vascular changes in diabetes. Methods We genotyped 10 single nucleotide polymorphisms and one microsatellite spanning 34 kb across the SLC 2 A 10 gene in a prospective cohort of 372 diabetic patients. Their association {{with the development of}} peripheral arterial disease (<b>PAD)</b> in <b>type</b> 2 diabetic patients was analyzed. Results At baseline, several common SNPs of SLC 2 A 10 gene were associated with <b>PAD</b> in <b>type</b> 2 diabetic patients. A common haplotype was associated with higher risk of <b>PAD</b> in <b>type</b> 2 diabetic patients (haplotype frequency: 6. 3 %, P = 0. 03; odds ratio [OR]: 14. 5; 95 % confidence interval [CI]: 1. 3 - 160. 7) at baseline. Over an average follow-up period of 5. 7 years, carriers with the risk-conferring haplotype were more likely to develop PAD (P = 0. 007; hazard ratio: 6. 78; 95 % CI: 1. 66 - 27. 6) than were non-carriers. These associations remained significant after adjustment for other risk factors of PAD. Conclusion Our data demonstrate that genetic polymorphism of the SLC 2 A 10 gene is an independent risk factor for <b>PAD</b> in <b>type</b> 2 diabetes. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{spiral groove}} thrust bearing can be {{operated}} at the dynamic stable condition and furthermore {{can bring a}} large load capacity comparing with the other <b>type</b> of gas <b>bearing</b> such as the Rayleigh pad or the tilting <b>pad</b> <b>types.</b> Accordingly this <b>type</b> of gas <b>bearing</b> {{has been used as}} a practical one for a thrust gas bearing of rotary performance. Although the principle and its function have been studied much enough on their theoretical points, it is quite difficult at present to get the plentiful experimental data for practical design. In the spiral groove thrust bearing, when the pad which has the spiral groove on the surface rotates over the other surface, the air as lubricant can be introduced into the centre of the bearing along the centre line of the spiral groove (call it as pumping-in condition). Consequently the pressure can yield the load capacity to separate each surface, but if the depth of the groove is too much high to keep the air in it, the leakage of air will become larger and loose its load capacity. Thereupon the number of the grooves, a spiral angle, the depth of the groove and the bearing clearance are the main and important design factors to confine the ability. The present paper reports a few results which we could get from the experiments to determine the effect of the groove depth on the dynamic properties of the spiral groove thrust bearing. And we discuss also whether the experimental values agree well with the theoretical ones or not...|$|R

40|$|The {{investigation}} of water diffusion in polyurethane CMP pads via hydrogen-deuterium (H-D) exchange, measured by attenuated total reflectance/FT-IR (ATR/FT-IR), is reported. Significant {{differences in the}} kinetics of H-D exchange for a thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) pad and a conventional cross-linked polyurethane (PU) pad were found. These differences were attributed to the intrinsic chemical and physical differences between the polymeric materials constituting the pads that were characterized by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LCMS) and 1 H NMR spectroscopy. Extraction kinetics for low molecular weight compounds in the pads are reported. H-D exchange kinetics for both TPU and PU pads show a strong dependence on temperature and were unique to the specific <b>pad</b> <b>type.</b> <b>Pad</b> conditioning also influenced the kinetics. These findings suggest a re-organization of chain segments {{at or near the}} surface during pad conditioning.
