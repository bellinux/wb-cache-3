5|$|Culture {{techniques}} {{are designed to}} promote the growth and identify particular bacteria, while restricting {{the growth of the}} other bacteria in the sample. Often these {{techniques are}} designed for specific specimens; for example, a sputum sample will be treated to identify organisms that cause pneumonia, while stool specimens are cultured on selective media to identify organisms that cause diarrhoea, while preventing growth of non-pathogenic bacteria. Specimens that are normally sterile, such as blood, urine or spinal fluid, are cultured under conditions designed to grow all possible organisms. Once a <b>pathogenic</b> <b>organism</b> has been isolated, it can be further characterised by its morphology, growth patterns (such as aerobic or anaerobic growth), patterns of hemolysis, and staining.|$|E

In general, children swim more often, stay in the water longer, submerge their heads more often, and swallow more water.

50|$|Macroptilium atropurpureum is {{considered}} a pest plant under some local government law, including some small local governments in Australia. It has negative effects on native shrubs, grasses and young trees by smothering them under its dense vines and not allowing them enough sunlight or soil nutrients to grow. Macroptilium atropurpureum also has a few limitations which include its intolerance to poor water drainage, its declining nutritional value after continued grazing, and its susceptibility to leaf disease. In periods of heavy rainfall, Macroptilium atropurpureum is susceptible to '‘foliar blight’' (infection from a <b>pathogenic</b> <b>organism).</b>|$|E

This culture and sensitivity (C&S) process identifies the species of bacteria. Antibiotic sensitivities are then assessed on the bacterial isolate to inform clinicians with respect to appropriate antibiotics for treatment.|$|E

25|$|Disease {{caused by}} the feeding {{activity}} of dipteran flies is described here under Parasitic disease. Disease caused by small <b>pathogenic</b> <b>organisms</b> that pass from the flies to domestic animals is described here under Transmitted organisms; these organisms are often of numerous species thus only prominent examples are provided. Feeding by adult flies may cause irritation through to acute stress from painful bites, resulting in loss of grazing time and reduced gain in weight. Feeding by adult flies on the blood of their hosts exposes the hosts to <b>pathogenic</b> <b>organisms</b> that are infecting the fly, {{this can lead to}} acute disease of the host's blood and other organs. Feeding by adult flies using their sponging mouthparts can also expose the hosts to <b>pathogenic</b> <b>organisms</b> that have contaminated the mouthparts. Larvae of some flies are adapted to feed on the tissues of their host causing direct pathological damage to organs, this is known as myiasis.|$|R

50|$|The {{risks from}} waste {{leachate}} {{are due to}} its high organic contaminant concentrations and high concentration of ammonia. Pathogenic microorganisms that might be present in it are often cited as the most important, but <b>pathogenic</b> <b>organism</b> counts reduce rapidly with time in the landfill, so this only applies to the freshest leachate. Toxic substances may, however, be present in variable concentrations, and their presence {{is related to the}} nature of the waste deposited. Most landfills containing organic material will produce methane, some of which dissolves in the leachate. This could, in theory, be released in poorly ventilated areas in the treatment plant. All plants in Europe must now be assessed under the EU ATEX Directive and zoned where explosion risks are identified to prevent future accidents. The most important requirement is the prevention of the discharge of dissolved methane from untreated leachate into public sewers, and most sewage treatment authorities limit the permissible discharge concentration of dissolved methane to 0.14 mg/l, or 1/10 of the lower explosive limit. This entails methane stripping from the leachate.|$|E

25|$|Some of the brachyceran flies are {{important}} transmitters of <b>pathogenic</b> <b>organisms</b> through a route known as mechanical (or contaminative) transmission. These flies have complex cutting mouthparts {{that make a}} superficial wound in skin. Blood flowing into the wound is sponged up by the labella organ of the mouthparts (see photograph of Tabanus mouthparts). The flies tend to take small meals from many hosts at short intervals, to avoid the defensive actions of their hosts. Fresh blood on the labella may contaminate other hosts with <b>pathogenic</b> <b>organisms.</b> Many species of brachyceran flies such as the house-flies and blow-flies that do not feed on blood are also mechanical transmitters of <b>pathogenic</b> <b>organisms</b> by a contaminative route on their mouthparts used for sponging up wet nutritious secretions on skin of vertebrate animals. Usually the mechanical transmission of microbes by flies does not involve any developmental stage of the microorganism in the fly. However, some brachyceran flies, such {{as a group of}} species of Glossina genus {{are important}} biological transmitters, not mechanical.|$|R
