40|$|In aquatic systems, in-stream {{structures}} such as dams, weirs {{and road}} crossings can act as barriers to fish movement along waterways. There is a growing array of technological fish-pass solutions for the movement of fish across large {{structures such as}} weirs and dams. However, most existing weir structures lack dedicated fishways, and fish often {{have to rely on}} drowned conditions to move upstream. In order to assess the adequacy of a given or proposed weir for upstream fish passage under drowned conditions, it is necessary to determine, firstly, the hydraulic properties of the <b>drowned</b> <b>weir</b> with respect to the requirements of the fish community and, secondly, the duration and timing of drowning flows with respect to the hydrograph for the site and the likely timing of fish movements. This paper primarily addresses the first issue. A computer program has been developed and incorporated in a simple-to-operate spreadsheet for the determination of the hydraulic characteristics of a <b>drowned</b> <b>weir</b> which are important to fish movement. The program is based on a theoretical analysis of <b>drowned</b> <b>weirs</b> and subsequent extensive verification in laboratory experiments. Inputs to the program include site information comprising channel cross-section data, channel slope, and channel roughness, and weir information comprising weir height and the required minimum drowned depth over the weir for migrating fish passage. The program then calculates the flow rate at which the required level of drowning occurs, the velocity characteristics above the weir (including transverse distributions), and flow depths and velocities upstream and downstream of the weir. The paper discusses (briefly) the theoretical background of the program and its experimental verification. A case study is then presented that illustrates the use of the program in the field to assess fish passage opportunities at an existing weir and to develop a case for retrofitting a fishway. Some discussion is also provided on the contribution of a modelled drownout volume to the assessment of how significant a barrier a weir is to fish passage. It is shown that the program is an important new additional tool in the assessment of the adequacy of weir structures in providing for fish movement and informing associated fish passage solutions.

50|$|The main weir {{connects the}} second island to the {{opposite}} bank on the Kennington, Oxfordshire side. This is {{the location of the}} infamous Sandford Lasher, a treacherous weirpool where many have <b>drowned.</b> Another <b>weir</b> links the two lower islands.|$|R
50|$|In {{his book}} Atlantis of the West: The Case For Britain's Drowned Megalithic Civilization (2003), Paul Dunbavin {{argues that a}} large island once existed in the Irish Sea and that this island was Atlantis. He argues that this Neolithic civilization in Europe was <b>partially</b> <b>drowned</b> by rising sea levels caused by a comet impact that caused a pole shift and changed the earth's axis around 3100 BC. Such changes would be readily {{detectable}} to modern science, however, and Dunbavin's claims are considered pseudo-scientific at best within the scientific community.|$|R

5000|$|The pool {{below the}} weir, known as Sandford Lasher, has been notorious since the 19th century {{because of the}} number of {{individuals}} who have <b>drowned</b> there. <b>Weirs,</b> like the one at Sandford Lasher, generate powerful currents that can trap and hold a victim (and often attempted rescuers) underwater at the base of the structure; hence their reputation as [...] "drowning machines".|$|R
40|$|Currently, {{there is}} an {{increase}} of diversity {{in the design of}} complex hydraulic structures. Thus {{there is a need to}} establish adequate mathematical models and software with complete description of processes. These models should be focused on certain classes of problems, which statements may change during the simulation. So, in our opinion, so-called self-organizing simulation models are perspective, they adapt to changes in the operating practice of the objects that require rapid adjustments in the boundary conditions and the field of simulation.

60|$|While Chingatok was speaking, {{a gust of}} wind more furious {{than ever}} struck the hut and shook it to its foundations. At the same time a loud {{rumbling}} sound was heard outside. Most of the men leaped up, caught hold of spears or knives, and rushed out. Through the driving drift they could just see that the observatory, which was a flimsy structure, had been swept clean away, and that the more solid hut was following it. Even as they gazed they saw its roof caught up, and whirled off {{as if it had been}} a scroll of paper. The walls fell immediately after, and the stones rolled down the rocky cone with a loud rattling, which was <b>partially</b> <b>drowned</b> by the shrieking of the tempest.|$|R
60|$|No sooner was {{its voice}} heard upon the present {{occasion}} than the whole line was in motion. A wild cry of joy from the advancing batallions rent the air, and was then {{lost in the}} shrill clangour of the bagpipes, {{as the sound of}} these, in their turn, was <b>partially</b> <b>drowned</b> by the heavy tread of so many men put at once into motion. The banners glittered and shook as they moved forward, and the horse hastened to occupy their station as the advanced guard, and to push on reconnoitring parties to ascertain and report the motions of the enemy. They vanished from Waverley's eye as they wheeled round the base of Arthur's Seat, under the remarkable ridge of basaltic rocks which fronts the little lake of Duddingston.|$|R
500|$|On June 21, Patrick Macdonald of The Seattle Times criticized Jackson, stating, [...] "He {{may have}} lived a {{sheltered}} life, but {{there really is}} no excuse for using terms like 'Jew me' and 'kike' in a pop song, unless you make it clear you are denouncing such terms, and do so in an artful way." [...] Two days later, Jackson decided, despite the cost incurred, he would return to the studio and alter the offending wording on future copies of the album; [...] "Jew me" [...] and [...] "Kike me" [...] would be substituted with [...] "do me" [...] and [...] "strike me". The music video and some copies of the album still carry the original words, but with loud, abstract noises <b>partially</b> <b>drowning</b> them out. He reiterated his acceptance that the song was offensive to some. Spike Lee claimed {{there was some kind of}} double standard in the music industry. [...] "While the New York Times asserted the use of racial slurs in [...] "They Don't Care About Us", they were silent on other racial slurs in the album. [...] The Notorious B.I.G. says [...] "nigga" [...] on [...] "This Time Around," [...] another song on the HIStory album, but it did not attract media attention, as well as, many years before, use in lyrics of word [...] "nigger" [...] by John Lennon.|$|R

500|$|Reeves and Baker {{completed}} {{a third and}} final draft that was [...] "substantially toned down" [...] in content from the previous attempts. This version of the screenplay, which was filmed {{with only a few}} minor revisions during the production, was missing many of the more explicit moments of violence described in the first submitted drafts: the death spasms of the pre-credits hanging victim, Lowes getting stabbed fifteen times with a steel spike, and a sniper's victim somersaulting through the air and slamming into a tree. A sequence depicting the Battle of Naseby was to be filmed, during which a soldier's head was to be cut off on screen. Most significantly, the film's finale was completely altered. In the original ending, Stearne falls in with a group of gypsies and attempts to rape one of their women, who successfully fights off her attacker by plunging her thumbs into his eyes, blinding him. The gypsies then stake him to death. Marshall arrives and convinces the gypsies to assist him in ambushing Hopkins. Hopkins is viciously beaten by Marshall, who forces a [...] "confession" [...] out of the bloodied man. Marshall <b>partially</b> <b>drowns</b> Hopkins (whose thumbs have been tied to his feet), then finally hangs him. Tenser had previously expressed concerns regarding the scope of the Battle of Naseby sequence as well as the gypsy-ending, noting that these would both require the employment of additional groups of extras. He asked Reeves and Baker to remove the battle sequence and simplify the ending for the final draft.|$|R

Experiments were carried out in inclinable channel connected to the hydraulic circuit with a pump and storage tank at the Water Management Research Laboratory (LVV) of Institute of Water Structures at the Faculty of Civil Engineering in Brno University of Technology. Hydraulic inclinable channel has cross-section with dimensions of 0. 4 × 0. 4 m and length of 12. 5 m. The measured area has cross-section approximately 0. 2 m wide and 0. 4 m high and its length is 1 m.

40|$|The primary {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to understand the origin of the Belize Barrier Reef and the sequence stratigraphy of the mixed siliciclastic-carbonate system. The data used consisted of 1, 400 km of conventional multichannel seismic, 1, 300 km of single-channel high resolution seismic, and information from nine wells. Conventional seismic shows elongated NNE-SSW highs and lows (Camels Basin, Camels Hump-Turneffe atoll, Gladden Basin, Glovers atoll-Lighthouse Island). The thrusted block of Camels Hump formed from buttressing of the Maya Mountains against the moving Caribbean plate during the Paleocene. Its load generated Camels Basin, whereas Gladden and Turneffe Basins formed as pull-aparts. The transtension produced the Turneffe and the Glovers-Lighthouse alignments whose tops as well as Camels Hump's were covered by carbonate platforms during the late Eocene/Oligocene. These carbonates were <b>partially</b> <b>drowned</b> in the early/middle Miocene. During the middle/late Miocene, tectonic enhancement of Camels Hump and Glovers highs triggered the collapse of their margins, shedding mass flow deposits. The late Pliocene/early Pleistocene sea-level fall moved the shoreline along the eastern flank of Camels Hump and in the northern Camels Basin where longshore currents redistributed the sediments. The Belize Barrier Reef became established on top of these lowstand siliciclastic coastal deposits {{in the middle of the}} Brunhes Epoch (about 0. 45 Ma). Once the barrier reef was formed, it established the modern mixed siliciclastic-carbonate system. When sea-level dropped, about 120 m during the Last Glacial Maximum (18, 000 years ago), the reef built during the previous interglacial highstand was karstified. The shelf lagoon became a fluvial plain drained by two incised valley systems. The northern fluvial system deposited a lowstand delta at the mouth of the English Cay Channel. This delta was partially reworked by longshore currents. The rise of sea-level slowed at about - 65 to - 70 m, 11, 000 to 10, 000 years ago (Younger Dryas) and is documented by a landward-stepped delta. As sea-level rise resumed, the incised valleys became filled with fluvial to estuarine sediments and, then, buried under marine marls. Flooding at about 7, 000 years ago reactivated the reef...|$|R
40|$|The Maldive Archipelago in the {{equatorial}} Indian Ocean {{is only the}} uppermost {{part of a more}} than 3 -km thick carbonate platform. The Maldive platform contains a 50 Ma-long sedimentation record and has a relatively simple tectonic history. The interpretation of 6000 km of Shell 2 -D seismic data and information from two industry and three ODP wells was the basis for the reconstruction of the platform evolution and assessment of controls on platform development. The evolution of the Maldives platform was essentially twofold. During the first stage (Eocene-early Oligocene), tectonic control played the dominant role in the establishment and geographic distribution of shallow water carbonates. A series of shallow water carbonate platforms were formed in the early Eocene on basement highs separated by two deep, narrow, and continuous graben systems. The platforms aggraded and backstepped in the Eocene and early Oligocene in response to relative sea level rise driven mostly by tectonic subsidence. The second stage of the platform evolution (late Oligocene-Quaternary) was predominantly controlled by sea level fluctuations. A significant fall in sea level at the early-late Oligocene transition, with a magnitude possibly up to a 100 m, was recorded in the paleo-bathymetry of the Shell ARI- 1 well. In the late Oligocene and early Miocene, the platforms first aggraded, <b>partially</b> <b>drowned,</b> and later backstepped in response to a substantial long-term sea-level rise. At the end of the early Miocene, a series of aggrading flat top carbonate banks, a small remnant of the Eocene-Oligocene neritic carbonate system, were established {{on the periphery of the}} central basin, the predecessor of the modern Inner Sea of the Maldives. During the middle Miocene, the bank margins prograded for 10 [...] 15 km. The progradation was driven by five complete sea level cycles, with each cycle represented by a relative sea-level fall and a subsequent rise. The reconstructed late Oligocene-middle Miocene relative sea level history of the Maldives corresponds well with the newly-published ice-volume record based on the temperature-corrected benthic foraminifera oxygen isotope data. The late Oligocene-middle Miocene depositional geometries of the Maldive platform appear to have recorded eustatic sea-level fluctuations...|$|R

5000|$|Some critics—notably D. H. Lawrence—see {{the novel}} as {{a study of the}} way {{communities}} control their [...] In Egdon Heath, most people (particularly the women) look askance at the proud, unconventional Eustacia. Mrs. Yeobright considers her too odd and unreliable to be a suitable bride for her son, and Susan Nunsuch, who frankly believes her to be a witch, tries to protect her children from Eustacia's supposedly baleful influence by stabbing her with a stocking pin and later burning her in effigy. Clym at first laughs at such superstitions, but later embraces the majority opinion when he rejects his wife as a murderer and adulteress. In this view, Eustacia dies because she has internalised the community's values to the extent that, unable to escape Egdon without confirming her status as a fallen woman, she chooses suicide. She thereby ends her sorrows while at the same time—by <b>drowning</b> in the <b>weir</b> like any woman instead of floating, witchlike—she proves her essential innocence to the community.|$|R
50|$|Following his {{dismissal}} from a draper's shop, {{where his}} father had placed him as an apprentice, protagonist Alfred Polly (John Mills) {{finds it hard to}} find another position. When a telegram arrives informing him of his father's death, he returns to the family home. With a bequest of £500, Polly starts to consider his future; and a friend of his father's, Mr Johnsen (Edward Chapman), urges him to invest it in a shop - an idea that Polly hates. Whilst dawdling in the country on a newly-bought bicycle, Polly has a brief dalliance with a schoolgirl, Christabel (Sally Ann Howes); but later marries a cousin, Miriam Larkins (Betty Ann Davies). Fifteen years later, Polly and his wife are running a drapery in Fishbourne, and the marriage has descended to incessant arguments and bickering. While walking in the country, Polly decides to commit suicide but he also sets his shop ablaze {{in the hope that the}} insurance will assure Miriam's prosperity; he botches the arson job and, instead of killing himself, rescues an elderly neighbour and becomes a minor local celebrity. Still unhappy, Polly leaves Miriam and is hired by a rural innkeeper (Megs Jenkins) as handyman and ferryman; however, he soon realises that the position was open because the innkeeper's brother-in-law Jim (Finlay Currie) is a drunkard who chases any other man away from the inn. Polly clashes with Jim until the latter accidentally <b>drowns</b> in a <b>weir</b> when he is chasing Polly. Several years later, Polly returns to Fishbourne to find Miriam operating a tea-shop with her sister, in the belief that Polly has drowned, and he returns to his happier life at the inn.|$|R
40|$|Pedro Channel is the deepest, central-most seaway on the {{northern}} Nicaragua Rise. A revised bathymetric map illustrates a seafloor dissected by numerous canyons and gullies as well as portions of a drowned carbonate bank with keep-up bank morphology. The 3. 5 kHz echogram data interpretation in Pedro Channel indicates the banks provide both a line and point source of sediment to the channel floor. Concentric facies belts along the bank margins illustrate the line source concept. Localized zones of coarser-grained deposits at the bases of canyons along the bank margins depict the point source concept. The synthetic seismograms for ODP Site 1000 have low correlation coefficients (0. 321). Visual correlation of the synthetic seismogram with SCS data indicates a good correlation of seismic facies with various lithologic intervals. An interpretation of SCCS and MCS data reveals that periplatform sedimentation has dominated Pedro Channel from the early Miocene to recent. Dredge haul analysis suggests that a neritic carbonate bank <b>drowned</b> <b>partially</b> in the middle Oligocene and finally in the early Miocene. Erosion affects the edges of this drowned bank in the middle Miocene. Faults in Pedro Channel illustrate characteristics typical of sinistral strike-slip faults including vertical to sub-vertical faults, faults that splay upward, forced folds, and linear fault traces in map view. ODP Site 998 was selected over {{a small portion of}} the Cayman Rise on a small topographic high. Synthetic seismograms for ODP Site 998 have low correlation coefficients (0. 168). Despite the low correlation coefficients, turbidite-rich core intervals correlate with SCS intervals having low continuity seismic reflectors. The predominantly pelagic sedimentation at this Site results in a generally continuous seismic reflection character. ODP Site 1001 is located just north of the Hess Escarpment. Synthetic seismograms have low correlation coefficients (0. 335), but do permit correlation of SCS A" and B" horizons with an Eocene-Miocene unconformity and basaltic basement respectively. Hydrosweep data indicates that the Hess Escarpment is dissected by numerous canyons incising along faults. The northwest trending normal faults are suggestive of dextral strike-slip motion...|$|R
