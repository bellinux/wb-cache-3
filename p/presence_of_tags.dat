30|$|Consider {{a reader}} that interrogates {{a set of}} tags in its {{communication}} range by transmitting an UWB signal with a specific spreading code. For population estimation, it is reasonable to consider that tags share the same code. Considering that all tags backscatter in the same way, the estimation of the tag population is related to the analysis of the energy collected by the UWB receiver at the reader. Due to the different times of arrival (ToA) of the backscattered signals from nodes at different distances, the reader may be able to distinguish the <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> <b>tags</b> at different distances. The tag population estimate results in estimating the number of backscattered pulses, although the channel delay spread should be accounted for in a realistic propagation scenario. Using different codes on the tag side may improve the detection performance, while increasing complexity. The accuracy is measured in terms of maximum estimation error on the interrogation ranges, which returns an error on the number of tags actually present within a given range. In a next phase, assuming that a tag has been identified, by measuring the ToA of the backscattered signal, the reader is able to estimate the distance (ranging operation) and then provide an input to one or more algorithms for estimating the position of the tag.|$|E

Simultaneous TG/DSC analyses (STA) demonstrated their remarkable thermal stability, while variable-temperature XRPD experiments highlighted their high degree of ﬂexibility related to guest-induced ﬁt processes of the solvent molecules included in the channels. A structural isomer of the parent NiBDP was obtained with a sulfonate tagged ligand, H 2 BDP_SO 3 H.

40|$|The {{selection}} {{and production of}} scFvs from phage display synthetic antibody libraries are frequently delayed by the <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> amber (<b>TAG)</b> stop codons within the sequences corresponding to the variable CDRs.

40|$|AISI 316 / 316 L has {{traditionally}} been used in offshore topside environments when operating under low temperatures. It has been observed that the AISI 316 / 316 L piping suffer from severe attacks of pitting and crevice corrosion on external surfaces. It is therefore important to emphasise the comments within the statements that give the limitations {{on the use of}} the material. While temperature is the main parameter in the standards, there seem to be others, such as location, <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> <b>tags</b> and coating, which affect the initiation and propagation of pitting and crevice corrosion. This thesis discusses the various operating parameters that affect the susceptibility to pitting and crevice corrosion of AISI 316 / 316 L piping and proposes procedures for identifying piping that are most prone to attack, and calculations of the probability of failure of such piping. In the first part of the thesis, a literature survey of the parameters that affect the pitting and crevice corrosion of AISI 316 / 316 L in an offshore environment is presented. In the second part, a procedure for the identification of piping that is prone to pitting and crevice corrosion is presented. This procedure has been developed taking into consideration the parameters that are assumed to be important and suitable for use in RBI analysis. In the first step, the parameters that affect both pitting and crevice corrosion, that is, the chloride content due to the location of the pipe, coating and temperature, were considered to be the most important ones. In the second step, the possibility of crevice corrosion was assessed. In the third part, a procedure for assessing the possibility of pitting corrosion in the offshore topside environment based on the pitting potential was developed. The temperature of the external pipe surface was used to find the solubility of NaCl in water. The chloride concentration was used to determine the in order to find the possibility of pitting in the topside offshore environment. The last step was to develop a procedure for calculating the probability of failure of a pipe as a function of time. In this step, the functional life of the coating and the rate of pitting corrosion have been considered. </p...|$|E
40|$|A protein may perform various {{functions}} {{inside a}} cell through multiple signaling networks and help in fine-tuning cellular activities {{required to maintain}} complex physiology. A large number of proteins have been described that act as both stress response proteins as well as transcription factors in gene expression related to development. These functions {{may or may not}} be interlinked depending on the protein under consideration. For example, Sp 1 was initially described to act as a transcription factor regulating the expression of a large number of essential genes. Later, it was also implicated in DNA damage response and in recent studies, has been shown to be a substrate for ATM-kinase-mediated phosphorylation with kinetics comparable to H 2 AX. Deletion of Sp 1 sensitizes the cell to DNA damage induced by ionizing radiation. Like Sp 1, Atmin (or ASCIZ) is another such protein with roles in both stress response and development. Atmin defines an NBS 1 independent arm of ATM-kinase signaling under conditions of non-IR stress like hypotonic stress or oxidative stress. Studies from the knockout mouse work shows Atmin plays a crucial role in vivo as a regulator of organ development during embryonic growth that is independent of its function in stress response. However, analysis of its role in post-embryonic development has not been possible as murine mutants studied so far, are embryonic lethals. In this study, we have characterized an EP- insertion line EP(3) 3709 as dASCIZ mutant and used it to investigate the roles of the protein during post-embryonic stages of 3 rd larval instar and metamorphosis (equivalent of adult development in sexually mature humans). EP(3) 3709 homozygotes survived till the pupal phase but did not eclose as adult flies. Mutant pupae displayed impaired metamorphosis with majority of the population showing little or no morphogenesis of adult head, wings, legs and abdomen. Expression of key ecdysone inducible genes including Broad Complex was significantly reduced in the mutant pupae compared to WT controls. Disruption of dASCIZ also affects DNA synthesis and cell division in mutant brains resulting in small size than the WT counterparts. The mutant larvae displayed a more transparent appearance than the WT controls suggesting a possible reduction in fat tissue. The increased transparency of the mutant larvae coupled with a complete failure to eclose suggest possible fat body malfunction and energy deficits. The lethality associated with the EP(3) 3709 homozygotes could be rescued by ectopically expressing the transgenic reporter protein dASCIZ-HA-mCitrine by the Act 5 C-Gal 4 driver. This observation first established, EP(3) 3709 is a true mutant allele of dASCIZ. Second, it indicated, in absence of suitable antibodies capable of detecting endogenous dASCIZ, the behavior of the transgenic reporter protein dASCIZ-HA-mCitrine could be studied to predict the possible roles of the endogenous protein. Exploiting the <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> <b>tags</b> on the transgenic reporter protein (HA or Hemagglutinin in our case), the chromatin association property of dASCIZ-HA-mCitrine was analyzed by polytene chromosomes squash using anti-HA antibody. dASCIZ-HA-mCitrine localized braodly to the interbands regions of polytene chromosomes with an extensive overlap of signal with active RNApolII at multiple sites. In addition, dASCIZ-HA-mCitrine also showed a characteristic staining pattern in localization on polytene chromosomes before and after heat shock. Analysis of roles of dASCIZ in metamorphosis and in the preceding stage of 3 rd larval instar will give us a more holistic overview of its range of functions in a fruitfly model. Also our studies may help predict the involvement of its human counterpart in adult development. On a broader scale, an understanding of the pathways involved in the two seemingly independent branches of Atmin function, DNA damage response and development, using different mutants alleles in different model organisms will provide a more detailed picture about the regulation of proteins with dual functions in gene expression and the DNA damage response...|$|E

A amostra do experimento foi composta de 78 terceiros molares, sendo que 60 dentes foram divididos aleatoriamente em 6 grupos (n = 10) para o ensaio de microtração e 18 dentes adicionais (três dentes por grupo) foram utilizados para a análise da interface adesiva por meio da microscopia eletrônica de varredura (MEV). As variáveis de resposta quantitativas foram a resistência adesiva por meio do ensaio de microtração (Megapascal) e a classificação e cálculo dos valores percentuais dos tipos de fratura por meio de MEV. A análise estatística demonstrou que nos grupos NTC, o grupo Z 250 apresentou diferença estatisticamente significante com os demais grupos K e P 90, sendo estes semelhantes entre si. Após a realização da termociclagem observou diminuição nos valores de resistência nos grupos estudados, sendo que o grupo Z 250 apresentou diferença estatisticamente significante em comparação ao grupo K e P 90, que foram semelhantes entre si. A qualidade da interface adesiva por meio de MEV após o teste de microtração demonstrou que fraturas mistas foram prevalentes em todos os grupos avaliados. Em relação a interface adesiva, quando o sistema adesivo Clearfill SE Bond foi utilizado, pôde-se observar uma camada de adesivo espessa, camada híbrida e tags. No entanto, para o sistema adesivo P 90, não foi possível observar camada híbrida, tags e foram observadas fendas interfaciais tanto às 24 horas como após envelhecimento.

The sample {{of the study was}} composed by 78 third molars, 60 teeth were randomly divided into 6 groups (n = 10) for the microtensile testing and 18 additional teeth (three teeth per group) were used for the analysis of adhesive interface by means of scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The quantitative response variables were bond strengths to dentin through the microtensile test (Megapascal) and the classification and calculation of percentage values of theta peso fracture by SEM. Statistical analysis showed that the groups NTC, the Z 250 group showed a statistically significant difference with others groups K and P 90, which are similar to each other. After the performance of thermo cycling was observed decline in strength values of the studied groups, with the Z 250 group showed a statistically significant difference when compared to the K group and P 90, which were similar.

40|$|Resin luting {{agents are}} used to lute {{indirect}} restorations to hard tooth tissues. The luting procedure consists mostly of several tooth pretreatment steps as etching, priming and application of adhesive and only {{at the very end}} applying of a resin luting agent. Such a multi-step luting procedure with separate adhesive system is quite time-consuming and technique sensitive. Therefore, constant inquiry from the practitioners for the resin luting agents with simplified application procedure, have moved the manufacturers to develop self-adhesive resin cements which require no tooth tissue pretreatment anymore. Numerous in vitro and few in vivo studies of the first self adhesive resin cement RelyX Unicem showed adequate bond strengths to hard tooth tissues and acceptable short-term clinical performance. The complex chemistry and relatively high viscosity of self-adhesive resin cements challenges the ability of them to interact with hard tooth tissues. Moreover, they interact directly with a smear layer. So, it was the question whether self-adhesive resin cements are able to create similar micromorphological adhesion pattern to resin luting agents with separate adhesive systems. We tried to answer this question with the present SEM morphological investigation. It was the aim to analyze and compare the adhesive interfaces of a control resin luting agent with self-etching primer (Panavia F and ED Primer) and adhesive interfaces of self-adhesive resin cements (RelyX Unicem, RelyX Unicem 2 and Clearfil SA Cement). The task was to find out which morphological characteristics (tags, lateral tags, hybrid layer or interdiffusion zone, pores and other) could be found in the specimens of self-adhesive resin cements, compare them on native polished, demineralized/deproteinized and fractured specimens in low vacuum mode. It was the aim to find out whether the polymerization mode has the influence on the morphological findings. At least, to clear if the present LV SEM method can be considered as appropriate method for adhesive interface examinations. It was hypothesized that the self-adhesive resin cements would have only superficial interaction with smear layer without ability to form resinous tags. This could not be confirmed because a few specimens of RelyX Unicem 2 and Clearfil SA Cement revealed the <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> <b>tags</b> in dentinal tubules. However, the interdiffusion zone was thin and appeared irregularly even within one SARC’s specimen. This SEM morphological study confirmed quite a weak interaction of all three SARC’s with hard tooth tissues. The weak adhesion to enamel led to microgap formation along the adhesive interface. There were more failed specimens in SARC’s experimental group than in Panavia control group. In this aspect, RelyX Unicem 2 and Clearfil SA Cement performed worse than RelyX Unicem. The micromorphology of the adhesive interface of the control luting agent Panavia and its ED Primer appeared similar to that reported in the literature for resin luting agents with self-etching adhesive systems. A good material adhesion – low number of failed specimens, no microgap formation at enamel-Panavia adhesive interface, a distinct hybrid layer, tags and lateral tags were characteristic for a dentin-Panavia adhesive interface. The demineralization/deproteinization and fracturing of specimens revealed some characteristics extra like lateral tags and complemented the information obtained from polished specimens. It was hypothesized that auto-polymerization would enhance the deeper diffusion of the luting agents and thicker interdiffusion zone could be detected. Specimen examinations showed insignificant differences of morphological findings. Although, tags were found mostly in auto-curing mode, the supposed thicker interdiffusion zone in auto-polymerized self-adhesive resin cement specimens was not present. Possibly the tags in Clearfil SA Cement and RelyX Unicem 2 specimens could be formed there, where the dentinal tubules were free of smear plugs. By contrast, ED Primer of Panavia has modified the smear plugs allowing resin to infiltrate into dentinal tubules in both curing modes, however, without influence on the thickness of the hybrid layer. Using low vacuum SEM method it was possible to depict the characteristic adhesive interface of native, minimally prepared specimens. In particular, material contrast in LV SEM allowed features to be revealed such as the interdiffusion zone (hybrid layer) or tags. Self-adhesive resin cements have shown less typical micromophological characteristics at adhesive interface when compared to a control resin luting agent in the present study. It can be concluded that self-adhesive resin cements have predominantly chemical interaction with smear layer. Although, the bond strength of self-adhesive resin cements in vitro studies is acceptable, for lasting clinical performance a combination of chemical and micromechanical adhesion with a formation of tags and sufficient interdiffusion zone would be more trustworthy. ...|$|E

40|$|As {{a growing}} number of {{complementary}} transcripts, susceptible to exert various regulatory functions, are being found in eukaryotes, high throughput analytical methods are needed to investigate their expression in multiple biological samples. Serial Analysis of Gene Expression (SAGE), based on the enumeration of directionally reliable short cDNA sequences (<b>tags),</b> is capable <b>of</b> revealing antisense transcripts. We initially detected them by observing tags that mapped on to the reverse complement of known mRNAs. The <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> such <b>tags</b> in individual SAGE libraries suggested that SAGE datasets contain latent information on antisense transcripts. We raised a collection of virtua...|$|R
50|$|The {{production}} of lysosomal proteins suggests one method of lysosome sustainment. Lysosomal protein genes are transcribed in the nucleus. mRNA transcripts exit the nucleus into the cytosol, {{where they are}} translated by ribosomes. The nascent peptide chains are translocated into the rough endoplasmic reticulum, where they are modified. Upon exiting the endoplasmic reticulum and entering the Golgi apparatus via vesicular transport, a specific lysosomal tag, mannose 6-phosphate, {{is added to the}} peptides. The <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> these <b>tags</b> allow for binding to mannose 6-phosphate receptors in the Golgi apparatus, a phenomenon that is crucial for proper packaging into vesicles destined for the lysosomal system.|$|R

However, an intrinsic limitation <b>of</b> <b>tagging</b> is that the native function of the protein may be compromised or even abolished by the <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> the <b>tag.</b> Here we describe and characterize a set of small, innocuous protein tags (inntags) that we anticipate will find application {{in a variety of}} biological techniques. © 2015 Nature America, Inc.

50|$|Coded wire tags {{are used}} to track groups or {{individual}} fish for research and fishery management purposes. Commonly tagged species are coho, chinook, steelhead, chum, sockeye, and pink salmon. In Alaska, British Columbia, Washington, Oregon, and California, the adipose fin is removed from CWT tagged salmon as a visual indicator <b>of</b> the <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> the <b>tag.</b> However, in Washington the adipose fin is removed from nearly all hatchery salmon in mass marking programs to distinguish them from wild fish. In order to study the impacts of mark selective fisheries, where marked hatchery salmon are selected by fisheries rather than unmarked wild fish, some fish receive {{what is called a}} double index tag. In double index tagging, some hatchery fish are tagged with a CWT but do not have their adipose fin clipped. This means that the adipose fin clip cannot always be depended on as an indicator that a tag is there, since some fish with adipose fin clips will not actually have tags, and some fish with intact adipose fins will have tags. In places where mass marking or double index tagging is practiced, an electronic detector such as a wand or tunnel must be used to determine if a tag is present so the snout can be dissected to read the tag. Electronic tag detection is used in Washington, Oregon, and Idaho. Alaska and California depend on the adipose fin clip to indicate the <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> a <b>tag.</b>|$|R
40|$|Radio {{frequency}} identification (RFID) {{technology has}} been widely used in missing tag detection to reduce and avoid inventory shrinkage. In this application, promptly finding out the missing event is of paramount importance. However, existing missing tag detection protocols cannot efficiently handle the <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> a large number <b>of</b> unexpected <b>tags</b> whose IDs are not known to the reader, which shackles the time efficiency. To {{deal with the problem}} <b>of</b> detecting missing <b>tags</b> in the <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> unexpected <b>tags,</b> this paper introduces a two-phase Bloom filter-based missing tag detection protocol (BMTD). The proposed BMTD exploits Bloom filter in sequence to first deactivate the unexpected tags and then test the membership <b>of</b> the expected <b>tags,</b> thus dampening the interference from the unexpected tags and considerably reducing the detection time. Moreover, the theoretical analysis of the protocol parameters is performed to minimize the detection time of the proposed BMTD and achieve the required reliability simultaneously. Extensive experiments are then conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed BMTD. The results demonstrate that the proposed BMTD significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art solutions...|$|R

40|$|Ocean sunfishes, {{with their}} {{peculiar}} morphology, large size, and surface habits, are valuable assets in ecotourism destinations worldwide. This study investigates site fidelity and long-range movements of short ocean sunfish, Mola ramsayi (Giglioli 1883), at Punta Vicente Roca (PVR) off Isabela Island in the Galapagos Islands. Five individuals were tracked between 32 and 733 days using ultrasonic receivers and transmitters. Two of the 5 were also tracked with towed pop-off satellite tags. One travelled to the equatorial front covering 2700 [*]km in 53 days, with dive depths {{in the upper}} 360 [*]m at temperatures between 9. 2 °C and 22 °C. During its westward travel, dives extended to 1112 [*]m (the deepest depth yet recorded for Molidae) into temperatures ranging between 4. 5 °C and 23. 2 °C. The remaining four individuals demonstrated site fidelity to PVR and were detected at the site between 128 – 1361 times {{for a total of}} 3557 reports. Forty-eight percent of the reports occurred during daytime hours and 52 % after dark. Presumed cleaning session durations had a median of 15 minutes and a maximum of nearly 100 minutes. No other ultrasonic arrays around Galapagos or in the Eastern Pacific regional network recorded the <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> <b>tagged</b> individuals. These data are combined with tourist vessel sightings and submersible observations to confirm Punta Vicente Roca as an important sunfish hotspot...|$|R
