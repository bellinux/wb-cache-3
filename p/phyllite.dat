5|$|The tunnel {{runs through}} {{an area with}} complex and varied geology. It runs through two rock complexes, the Halsnøy Basement Rock on the Sveio side, and Hardangerfjord Cover Complex on the Stord side. Both were created during the {{creation}} of the Caledonian orogeny 500 million years ago. The Halsnøy Basement Rock consists of Precambrian rock with elements of gneiss of both sedimentary and magmatic origin. They range between granite gneiss to mylonite. In the area between the two complexes, there is some amount of gabbro. At the lowest point, the tunnel runs through a section of <b>phyllite,</b> which continues to be the dominant species until the tunnel reaches Otterøya. Below the island the tunnel reaches a section of greenstone, before it rises again through more <b>phyllite.</b>|$|E

The Geneva Spur is an anvil shaped rib of black rock named by the 1952 Swiss expedition. Fixed ropes assist climbers in scrambling over this snow-covered rock band. The Yellow Band is a section of interlayered marble, <b>phyllite,</b> and semischist, which also requires about 100 metres of rope for traversing it.|$|E

25|$|The {{area around}} Tanganga geologically forms {{part of the}} Santa Marta Supergroup with main rock types {{metamorphic}} rocks as <b>phyllites</b> and amphibolites. The <b>phyllites</b> are overlain by the Ciénaga Marble. The greenish <b>phyllites</b> are rich in phyllosilicates, amphiboles and large crystals of pyrite, while the amphibolites contain quartzite veins showing stockwork patterns surrounded by muscovite. The contact of the two metamorphic facies is located within Taganga.|$|R

25|$|The Ordovician turbidites, {{consisting}} of greywacke, feldspathic sandstone, micaceous siltstone, micaceous shale, chert, and <b>phyllite,</b> {{are very similar}} {{in all parts of}} the Tasman Orogen, including New Zealand and the Transantarctic Mountains. Detrital zircons from the turbidites have been isotopically dated with age ranges of 0.46 and 0.60 Gya, 1.0 and 1.2 Gya, and at ~1.8 Gya, ~2.2 Gya and ~2.7 Gya. These do not match the age of zircons from the interior of the Australian Shield, so the source of the sediments is from another continent. The other evidence from the Ordovician sediments are chemical composition indicates granitic source, with the absence of feldspar. Secondly the fine grained nature shows the sediments have been transported a long way from their ultimate, source, and could have been second cycle, derived from sedimentary rocks.|$|E
25|$|The Pittman Formation was {{described}} originally by Öpik in 1958 who named {{it after the}} Pittman Valley, southeast of Aranda, Australian Capital Territory. It is entirely of Ordovician age and about 800 metres thick near Canberra, but at Captains Flat it is over 1,200 metres thick. The lower levels are greywacke, exposed east of Queanbeyan and north are very thick and heavily overturned and thrusted. At Etheridge Creek, the type locality is a repeating pattern of sandstone, micaceous sandy shale, mudstone, black argillaceous and radiolarian chert. In the sandstone beds there are occurrences of graded bedding, clay pellets, and current bedding. Fossils of graptolites, radiolarians, conodonts, and occasionally brachiopods and sponges are found. The geological formation east of Queanbeyan {{used to be known}} as the Muriarra Formation. This alternates between sandstone with a high quartz content and mica, and <b>phyllite.</b> Radiolarian chert is found in the central section. The railway forms the border between Queanbeyan in NSW and Oaks Estate in the ACT. West of the Queanbeyan railway station is a cutting where folding has overturned the beds, with axes dipping to the east at 50 degrees. 300 metres of thickness is exposed in this cutting. Llanvirnian age (Pygodus serrus conodont zone). Fossils found include Phyllograptus anna, Trigonograptus ensiformus, Pterograptus, Didymograptus, Isograptus, Hallograptus from the Darriwillian age. Near the top of the formation are fossils Dicellograptus sextans, D divaricatus, D salopiensis, which are Gisbornian.|$|E

500|$|In 1924, {{there was}} a {{landslide}} at Høga, covering the area planned for the railway. The area was made of <b>phyllite</b> and was the geologically most unstable area on the route. The initial response was to plan for a tunnel past the area, but this was quickly rejected {{because of the high}} price. Instead, the line was moved further away from the mountain side. Other slides during construction included an avalanche near Store Reppa on 10 February 1925, which deposited up to [...] of earth. In April 1925, a [...] landslide took place above Berekvam.

40|$|The Meliata blueschists are {{subdivided}} into four groups which {{are characterized by}} different litholo-gies and metamorphic histories: (1) Marbles, intercalated with metabasalts and glaucophane-bearing <b>phyllites.</b> Phengite from this group metabasalts and <b>phyllites</b> records the Middle Jurassic age which is interpreted to date the high-pressure metamorphism; (2) Metabasites and micaschists, devoid of marbles contain relic muscovite and newly formed high-Si phengite. The relic muscovite gives Palaeozoic age; (3) Quartz <b>phyllites</b> indicate a polyphase evolution characterized by greenschist facies metamorphism followed by blueschist-facies over-print; the high-Si micas provide evidence of an early Middle Jurassic age of the high-pressure metamorphism; (4) Amphibolite-facies slices and blocks, overprinted by blueschist-facies metamorphism, represent old base-ment rocks. Lithological and metamorphic characteristics together with radiogenic ages of high-pressure micas indicate a subduction of a continental wedge prior to that of oceanic crust can be assumed...|$|R
40|$|The {{pressure}} {{character of}} the Alpine metamorphism in the {{some areas of the}} Gemericum, Veporicum and Meliaticum tectonic units was estimated by means of the b values of muscovites from greenschist facies metapelites. 124 selected samples of <b>phyllites</b> from three lithostratigraphic sequences were considered. The analytical results (tab. 1 : Figs. 2, 3, 4) demonstrate that the Alpine metamorphism in the central and inner Western Carpathians corresponds to the higher pressure range of the barrovian-type metamorphism. A metamorphic thermal gradient of approximately 10 °C/Km was consequently deduced (Fig. 5). A large data base concerning the b cell dimension of muscovite from Variscan <b>phyllites</b> of the Western Carpathians has been published recently for geobarometric purposes. Taking into consideration this data base, the new data shown in the present paper indicate that contrasting pressure characters are recorded in the Variscan vs. Alpine <b>phyllites</b> within the central and inner Western Carpathians...|$|R
50|$|A {{dividing}} line between strata of the Cambrian and Devonian periods runs north-west-south-east through the Hermitage and the quarries of the Pleines Roches above the Château Marcadet. To the north of this limit, the rock is early Cambrian (between 540 and 500 million years), characterised by clear or white quartzites, green shales, and grey <b>phyllites.</b> To the south, the Devonian rock is represented by grey schists, <b>phyllites</b> and quartzites. Schists and phyllades from this region are often calcareous. All these rocks were transformed by metamorphism and folded during two orogenies (Caledonian, then Variscan).|$|R
500|$|The Bømlafjord Tunnel (...) is a subsea {{road tunnel}} under Bømlafjorden which connects {{the island of}} Føyno in Stord to the {{mainland}} at Dalshovda in Sveio, Norway.

It carries three lanes of European Road E39 and {{is part of the}} Triangle Link, a fixed link which connects Sunnhordland to Haugaland. Plans for the tunnel arose in the 1980s; construction started in 1997 and the tunnel opened on 27 December 2000. The tunnel was built using the drilling and blasting method, with two teams building from each end. The tunnel runs through an area composed mostly of gneiss, <b>phyllite</b> and greenstone. The tunnel is the longest subsea tunnel in Norway and was the second-deepest in the world until 2008. It is still (2013) the deepest point on the E-road network.

500|$|Across the park, {{different}} ages of exposed rocks are seen. Stoneyfell quartzite, composed mostly of quartzite with sandstone and some siltstone, is the youngest. Woolshed flat shale is older and {{is composed of}} siltstone, dolomite and some sandstone. The oldest regular exposure is Montacute dolomite, which is a blue-grey dolomite with magnesite, siltstone and sandstone. Quarries {{in the south of}} the park have been mined for Stoneyfell Quartzite. This type of quartzite is a clean, white, feldsparthic quartzite with interbedded thin siltstone layers up to [...] thick occurring at gaps of [...] Ripple marks in this rock clearly indicate its shallow water origin. Next to Newman's Nursery is a quarry with grey to blue silicaceous dolomite used for road material. It contains traces of pyrite and is overlain by <b>phyllite.</b> Tea Tree Gully freestone, as found in the largest quarry in the park, is a feldsparthic sandstone bedded with quartzite. Decay of the feldspar has enabled it to be cut and dressed as a quality building stone. The Tea Tree Gully iron (or silver) mine lies in an iron-rich fault zone. The ore body is ironstone, 150m long, 50m wide and 30m thick (490ft by 160ft by 100ft). It is primarily limonite, detrital quartz and silica. It is thought to have been chemically deposited during the Paleogene and Neogene periods, 2mya to 66mya.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Study of {{metamorphic}} and {{igneous rocks}} from onshore and offshore Norway shows that quartz cathodoluminescence (CL) col-ors are not uniform in the examined lithologies. Neighboring quartz crystals in thin sections from granites and granodiorites may vary in color from blue or violet to brown, and neighboring quartz crystals in thin sections from <b>phyllites</b> range in color from yellow through brown to violet. Similarly, quartz CL colors in examined migmatites and gneisses vary between yellowish brown and violet brown in individual samples, although color variations are less striking {{than in the}} granites, granodiorites, and <b>phyllites.</b> Comparison of c-axis orientations and CL colors clearly indicates that the observed color variations are a function of crystallographic orientation in all the mentioned lithologies. This {{may be due to}} selective absorption of light along different crystallo-graphic directions, a phenomenon well known from spectroscopy. The observed color variations have important consequences for provenance studies, because variations in CL colors may be at least partly due to different crystallographic orientations. On the other hand, the crystal-lographic dependence of quartz CL may enable the provenance of quartz grains in a sandstone to be more precisely determined. A prom-ising observation in this respect is the different relationship between c-axis orientation and CL colors of quartz grains in <b>phyllites</b> and in higher-grade metamorphic rocks. In <b>phyllites</b> CL is yellowish when the c axes of the quartz grains are parallel to the plane of the thin section, whereas yellowish brown CL in quartz from the studied migmatites and gneisses occurs in crystals with the c axes at right angles to the plane of the thin section...|$|R
