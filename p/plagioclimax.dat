5000|$|... ==Frederic Clements's use of [...] "climax"== Clements {{described}} the successional {{development of an}} ecological communities comparable to the ontogenetic development of individual organisms. Clements suggested only comparisons to very simple organisms. Later ecologists developed this idea that the ecological community is a [...] "superorganism" [...] and even sometimes claimed that communities could be homologous to complex organisms and sought to define a single climax-type for each area. The English botanist Arthur Tansley developed this idea with the [...] "polyclimax" [...] — multiple steady-state end-points, determined by edaphic factors, in a given climatic zone. Clements had called these end-points other terms, not climaxes, and had thought they were not stable, because by definition climax vegetation is best-adapted to the climate of a given area. Henry Gleason's early challenges to Clements's organism simile, and other strategies of his for describing vegetation, were largely disregarded for several decades until substantially vindicated by research in the 1950s and 1960s (below). Meanwhile, climax theory was deeply incorporated in both theoretical ecology and in vegetation management. Clements's terms such as pre-climax, post-climax, <b>plagioclimax</b> and disclimax continued {{to be used to}} describe the many communities which persist in states that diverge from the climax ideal for a particular area.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{sustainability}} of traditional farming systems {{in many parts}} of Africa is threatened by losses in the variety of species, reduction in land, forest, soil and water resources under demographic pressure. Together with foreign influences these farming system are no longer in equilibrium with local culture and ecology and are therefore disintegrating {{due to the lack of}} local capacity to adjust to these changes. This has led to environmental degradation. The paper employs a combination of qualitative and quantitative techniques to: analyse the farming systems, assess the effect of cropping intensification on the climatic climax vegetation, and to establish the post-cultivation vegetation successions in fallows. It reports four crop fallow rotations: crop 3 years with 1 year bush fallow, crop 5 years with 1 - 2 year bush fallow, crop 10 years with 1 - 3 year bush fallow and continuous cropping. The post-cultivation successions present a <b>plagioclimax</b> dominated by Hyparhenia species with scattered shrubs maintained by cycles of cultivation and burning. The paper concludes that these shifting cultivation cycles involving cropping intensification and post cultivation savannization have deprived the farming system of its ecological benefits, that is, nutrient recycling through a long and mature fallow. The inability of the vegetation to reconstitute itself requires the development of farming systems that combine trees and crops in the field because of proven micro-ecological and ecological benefits. The paper therefore identifies the scope for the development of ecologically sustainable agro-ecosystems as a development path for shifting cultivation systems...|$|E
40|$|Large boulder grazing refugia {{permitted}} {{comparison of}} saxicolous bryophyte and lichen assemblages with those boulder tops accessible to red deer (Cervus elaphus) on a sporting estate in northwest Scotland. Plant succession was predicted to occur unchecked by grazing on {{the tops of}} these large boulders with cascading effects on bryophytes and lichens—assuming boulders had been in place over the same time period. Fifty pairs of boulders (one ≥ 2 m and the other accessible to red deer) were selected at random from various locations below north-facing crags. Percentage cover of each bryophyte and lichen species was estimated from three randomly placed quadrats on each boulder top. Due consideration was given to the influence of island biogeography theory in subsequent model simplification. Mean shrub cover and height, leaf-litter, bryophyte cover and bryophyte species richness were significantly higher within quadrats on large boulder tops that naturally excluded red deer. Lichen cover and lichen species richness were significantly higher on boulder tops accessible to red deer. Lichen cover was in a significant negative relationship with bryophyte cover, shrub cover and litter cover. Bryophyte cover showed a significant positive relationship with shrub height but there was an optimum shrub cover. Natural exclusion of red deer from the tops of large boulders has facilitated plant succession. The results suggest that grazing arrests the lithosere on boulder tops accessible to red deer at an early <b>plagioclimax</b> favouring saxicolous lichens. The results are relevant to situations where red deer might be excluded from boulder fields that hold lichen assemblages of conservation value...|$|E
30|$|In arid desert sandy areas, the crusted soils {{formed a}} compact {{protection}} film above the sand dunes, {{which have not}} only changed the water balance of the original soil-vegetation system, but also prevent soil CO 2 emissions into the atmosphere and induced a high CO 2 concentration around plant roots. Thus, based on the above results of the physio-ecological response to elevated root zone CO 2 of the two typical xerophytic shrubs, we could deduce that aside from soil water, elevated root zone CO 2 may be another key limiting factor that determines vegetation patterns in re-vegetated desert areas. As seen in Figures  1, 2, 3 and 4, for both vegetation types, plant growth or regeneration initially increased with increasing soil CO 2 concentration, but started retreating after they reached its maximum in spite of continued soil CO 2 concentration increasing. This conclusion has also verified by our previous results from long-term observation over 56  years of a sand-binding plantation in the Tengger desert that plant coverage increased from 10 to 35 % 10  years after the re-establishment of vegetation, and then coverage gradually declined to 10 % after 50  years (Li et al. 2004). CO 2 production rates were strongly affected by the inter- and intra-annual variability in rainfall, especially in arid desert areas (Huang et al. 2014). As a constant rainfall not only causes soil CO 2 accumulation but O 2 deficiency in roots, which in turn, does plants severe damage. The difference of species response to CO 2 concentration can cause changes {{in the relationship between}} interspecific competition. The WUE of A. ordosica was larger than C. korshinskii, and the difference of WUE of A. ordosica between different CO 2 concentrations was more smoothly, which indicated that A. ordosica was more tolerate to drought stress and root zone CO 2 variation when compared with C. korshinskii, so we may infer that the A. ordosica plant would be the dominant species in the vegetation succession. This hypothesis has also been verified by the recorded succession data and other results of sand-binding vegetation in the Shapotou area that A. ordosica may form a relatively stable climax community or <b>plagioclimax,</b> nearly 20  years later, and the originally planted shrubs such as C. korshinskii and H. scoparium will degrade and withdraw from the community (Li et al. 2004, 2013). The improvement of the soil surface in re-vegetated desert areas may elevate the root zone CO 2 concentration and so eliminated planted xerophytic shrubs. Thus, {{based on the results of}} this study, we can conclude that in the early stage of vegetation restoration, increased soil CO 2 concentrations through appropriate artificial methods such as planting grass patterns would be beneficial to plant growth, while minor human disturbances should be necessary in the latter to maintain the optimal CO 2 concentrations, these suggestions are effective in ensuring the stability and efficient management of desert ecosystems in future vegetation reconstructions in sandy areas. Overall, we have demonstrated that each plant has its own appropriate CO 2 concentrations, which could explain plant configuration or vegetation succession in re-vegetated sandy dunes. Although the ecological characteristics of two typical desert xerophytic shrubs were discussed in the present study, a mechanistic understanding of the physiological response of plants or the plant root system to elevated root zone CO 2 still required further research. And precipitation, as the sole source of water replenishment in the desert areas (Li et al. 2004), its influence on vegetation succession when combined with elevated CO 2 was still a challenge. Moreover, the CACE system employed in this study was simple and convenient for field operations, allowing for the easy simulation of the changes in other components (such as CH 4 or N 2 O) of the soil air and the influence of such changes on the plants.|$|E
