40|$|The mannose 6 -phosphate (Man 6 <b>P)</b> <b>recognition</b> marker in {{lysosomal}} proteins {{is known}} to be dephos- phorylated after the delivery of lysosomal proteins to the endosomeflysosome compartment. The rate of Man 6 <b>P</b> <b>recognition</b> marker inactivation depends on the cell type and lysosomal protein. In the present study we show that in BHK 21 cells, which rapidly dephosphorylate lysosomal proteins, the recognition marker is stable in the endosomal compartment, to which lysosomal enzymes such as arylsulfatase A are delivered during endocytosis at 20 °C. Dephosphorylation depends on the transfer of internalized lyso- somal enzymes from the 20 °C compartment to later compartments, most likely lysosomes. This transfer is sensitive to NH,CI and nocodazole. In vitro experiments identified purple acid phosphatase (uteroferrin) as a candidate for the lysosomal phosphatase catalyzing in vivo the dephosphorylation of Man 6 P recogni- tion marker.

In normal fibroblasts whose lysosomal enzymes contain Man 6 <b>P</b> <b>recognition</b> markers required for binding to the receptor, intracellular immunoreactive receptors were concentrated {{in one or two}} cisternae located {{on one side of the}} Golgi stack, in coated vesicles, and in lysosomes and endosomes.

Rather, they accumulate in coated vesicles concentrated at the presumptive sorting site in the Golgi complex.

40|$|To {{accomplish}} their degradative function lysosomes must {{be filled}} with specific proteins, which after being synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) have to be directed to the trans-Golgi network (TGN) for further processing and lysosomal targeting. The explanation of how lysosomal enzymes are accurately recognized and selected over many other proteins in the TGN relies on a small recognition marker, added exclusively to their N-linked oligosaccharides as they pass through the cis-Golgi: the mannose 6 -phosphate (M 6 P) group. Generation of the M 6 <b>P</b> <b>recognition</b> marker depends on a two-step reaction involving two different enzymes: UDP-N-acetylglucosamine 1 -phosphotransferase (GlcNAc-phosphotransferase) and -N-acetylglucosamine- 1 -phosphodiester  -N-acetylglucosaminidase (uncovering enzyme). GlcNAc-phosphotransferase catalyses the transfer of a GlcNAc- 1 -phosphate residue from UDP-GlcNAc to C 6 positions of selected mannoses in high-mannose type oligosaccharides of the hydrolases. Then, the uncovering enzyme removes the terminal GlcNAc, exposing the M 6 <b>P</b> <b>recognition</b> signal. At the TGN, the recognition signal allows the segregation of lysosomal hydrolases from all other types of proteins through selective binding to the M 6 P receptors: the cation-independent M 6 P receptor (CI-MPR) and/or the cation-dependent M 6 P receptor (CD-MPR). The produced clathrin-coated vesicles bud off from the TGN and fuse with late endosomes (LE). At the low pH of the LE, the hydrolases dissociate from the M 6 P receptors and the empty receptors are recycled to the Golgi for further rounds of transport. Impairments in this delivery/transport pathway may result in missorting of lysosomal enzymes, with consequent severe pathological condition. Additionally, the expression levels of M 6 P pathway functional components and of the recognition marker itself may have an influence on the efficacy of some therapeutic approaches. Here we will review the current knowledge {{on each of the}} major proteins involved in the M 6 P-dependent pathway, highlighting their involvement in disease.

Some of the initial events in the sorting of peroxisomal proteins have been elucidated. Peroxisomal matrix proteins are synthesized on free polyribosomes and are imported posttranslationally (for review see Lazarow and Fujiki, 1985). Import of peroxisomal matrix proteins requires both ATP and cytosolic factors (Imanaka et al., 1987; Wendland and Subramani, 1993), and recent evidence suggests that peroxisomal proteins can be imported in a folded state (McNew and Goodman, 1994; Glover et al., 1994; Walton et al., 1995; H~iusler et al., 1996).

The phosphotransferase is composed of six subunits (α 2, β 2, γ 2). The α- and β-subunits are catalytically active and encoded by a single gene, GNPTAB, whereas the γ-subunit encoded by GNPTG is proposed to recognize conformational structures common to lysosomal enzymes. Defects in GNPTG cause mucolipidosis type III gamma, which is characterized by missorting and cellular loss of lysosomal enzymes leading to lysosomal accumulation of storage material. Using plasmon resonance spectrometry, we showed that recombinant γ-subunit failed to bind the lysosomal enzyme arylsulfatase A. Additionally, the overexpression of the γ-subunit in COS 7 cells did not result in hypersecretion of newly synthesized lysosomal enzymes expected for competition for binding sites of the endogenous phosphotransferase complex. Analysis of fibroblasts exhibiting a novel mutation in GNPTG (c. 619 insT, p.

The vagueness of p leaves open {{what we have to}} think of <b>p.</b> <b>Recognition</b> that p is borderline amounts to be tolerant toward any of three following attitudes on p: 1) hesitant acceptance of p (positive view); 2) hesitant denial of p (negative view); 3) agnosticism about p (agnostic view). Let’s say that p is permissible when it is recognised that it is borderline. Permissibility is thus an attitudinal notion, though it is linked to the status of being borderline, {{it is not just the}} notion of borderliness but, rather, our characteristic attitudes to towards three possible dispositions towards borderline propositions- i. e. denial, acceptance and suspension of judgment. When p is borderline, we consider permissible having any of the three latter attitudes towards p. In the paper I scrutinize two main readings of permissibility. According to the first one- the excusatory conception- the tolerant attitude characteristic of permissibility is connected to the absence of epistemic blameworthiness. Whoever takes a view in borderline cases is not blameworthy of having overlooked some evidence since the fac...|$|E

30|$|With {{the policy}} paper of 1999, Kenya officially {{recognised}} the indigenous languages {{and provided a}} framework for incorporating them into the formal education system (Njoroge, [2008], <b>p.</b> 4). This <b>recognition</b> came decades after Ngugi wa Thiong'o's heated campaign for Kenyans (and other Africans) to exploit to the fullest the language and cultural resources at their disposal. We would like {{to pay tribute to}} the likes of Ngugi wa Thiong'o for the spirited fight they put up, sometimes at great personal cost, in favour of indigenous Kenyan languages.|$|R
5000|$|Bolter and Grusin {{contend that}} the process of {{remediation}} emphasizes that all media is, on one level, a poststructutalist ‘play of signs’ (<b>p.</b> 19). The <b>recognition</b> of these varying signs of influence differ across a spectrum, from ‘transparent’ remediations that clearly represent the previous media form, to aggressive forms that seek to disguise the role of their hypermediated practices in the name of providing the highest sense of immediacy. Bolter and Grusin broadly identify forms of remediation, across a spectrum, in the following five categorisations: ...|$|R
