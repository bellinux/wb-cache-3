40|$|A {{number of}} ^(15) N {{chemical}} shifts, determined at the natural-abundance {{level of the}} isotope, are reported for some secondary alkylamines, amides, ureas, urethanes, heterocycles, and miscellaneous compounds. Substituent chemical-shift parameters have been derived for secondary-alkylamine ^(15) N chemical shifts. The ^(15) N chemical shifts of secondary alkylamines appear to be potentially useful {{to determine the number}} of carbon atoms β to the nitrogen. Effects produced by differences in stereochemistry on the ^(15) N nmr spectra of di- 2 -butylamine and di- 2 -hexylamine have been detected.

40|$|The paper first validates the INTEGRATION {{model for}} {{estimating}} {{the capacity of}} weaving sections. Specifically, comparisons are made to field data and the Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) procedures. Subsequently, the paper presents a systematic analysis {{of the factors that}} potentially impact the capacity of freeway weaving sections, which include the length of the weaving section, the weaving ratio, the percentage of heavy vehicles, and the speed differential between freeway and ramp traffic. The study demonstrates some questionable capacity estimates by the CORSIM software and a gap acceptance procedure proposed in the literature. The study also demonstrates that the weaving ratio, which is the ratio of the lowest weaving volume to the total weaving volume, has {{a significant impact on the}} capacity of weaving sections. In addition, the study demonstrates that the length of weaving section has a larger impact on the capacity of weaving sections for short lengths and high traffic demands. Furthermore, the study demonstrates that there does not exist enough evidence to conclude that the speed differential between freeway and ramp traffic has a significant impact on weaving section capacities. Finally, the study demonstrates that the HCM <b>procedures</b> <b>for</b> <b>accounting</b> for heavy duty vehicle impacts on weaving section capacities appear to be reasonable...|$|E

40|$|In Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA), the {{two-stage}} {{method is}} a popular <b>procedure</b> <b>for</b> <b>accounting</b> <b>for</b> exogenous influences on efficiency. With the conventional two-stage method, a DEA is first conducted using only traditional (endogenous) inputs and outputs. Then, the first-stage DEA scores are regressed on the environmental/contextual (exogenous) inputs of interest. The regression outcomes are used to identify exogenous inputs that influence the first-stage DEA scores to a statistically significant degree, and to adjust DEA scores to <b>account</b> <b>for</b> these influences. Herein, it is demonstrated empirically that the conventional method exhibits substantial bias and low precision, with the degree of bias and precision affected by input variance and correlation. A reverse two-stage procedure that yields estimates without the bias and precision problems that compromise {{the validity of the}} conventional method's estimates is suggested. ...|$|R

40|$|The author {{presents}} {{a new approach}} for modeling the dynamics of collections of objects with internal structure. Based {{on the fact that}} the behavior of an individual in a population is modified by its knowledge of other individuals, a <b>procedure</b> <b>for</b> <b>accounting</b> <b>for</b> knowledge in a population of interacting objects is presented. It is assumed that each object has partial (or complete) knowledge of some (or all) other objects in the population. The dynamical equations for the objects are then modified to include the effects of this pairwise knowledge. This procedure has the effect of projecting out what the population will do from the much larger space of what it could do, i. e., filtering or smoothing the dynamics by replacing the complex detailed physical model with an effective model that produces the behavior of interest. The procedure therefore provides a minimalist approach for obtaining emergent collective behavior. The use of knowledge as a dynamical quantity, and its relationship to statistical mechanics, thermodynamics, information theory, and cognition microstructure are discussed...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} deal with mild {{deviations}} from the assumed parametric model, we propose a <b>procedure</b> <b>for</b> <b>accounting</b> <b>for</b> model uncertainty in the Bayesian framework. In particular, in the derivation of posterior distributions, we discuss the use of robust pseudo-likelihoods, which offer the advantage of preventing the effects caused by model misspecifications, i. e. when the underlying distribution lies in a neighborhood of the assumed model. The influence functions of posterior summaries, such as the posterior mean, are investigated as well as the asymptotic properties of robust posterior distributions. Although the use of a pseudo-likelihood cannot be considered orthodox in the Bayesian perspective, it is shown that, also through some illustrative examples, how a robust pseudo-likelihood, with the same asymptotic properties of a genuine likelihood, can be useful in the inferential process in order to prevent the effects caused by model misspecifications...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Propagation of {{regional}} seismic phases is {{highly dependent on}} path effects, {{but we have a}} limited understanding of these effects and no general <b>procedure</b> <b>for</b> <b>accounting</b> <b>for</b> path variation influence on regional waveforms. Thus, there is strong regional variability in the effectiveness {{of regional}} wave discriminants used to identify small earthquakes and nuclear explosions. Moti-vated by many observations of correlation between surface geology and regional phase behavior, we empirically explore the relationship between short-period regional and upper mantle distance signal energy and statistics of topography along different ravel paths using data for underground nuclear explosions at Semipalatinsk, Kazakhstan. We find strong linear correlations of the logarithmic rms amplitude ratio Sn/Lg (and to a lesser extent, P/Lg) with mean altitude, rms roughness, rms slope, and skewness of topography along the paths to receivers in Eurasia. This indicates that energy partitioning in the regional wave field is controlled by wave-guide structure and attenuation variations that are manifested in surface topography. This suggests that it is feasible in many cases to directly calibrate regional discriminants for path effects in terms of observable surface topography, as a surrogate for overall path properties. The relationships also help {{to understand the nature of}} regional phase propagation...|$|R

40|$|BackgroundSeveral {{efforts are}} under way to conduct quality-improvement {{initiatives}} in pediatric cardiology and cardiac surgery. Our goal was to develop an objective prioritization scheme for such initiatives based on encounter frequency and relative contribution of quality measures of morbidity (and associated variances), particularly in the setting of low mortality. MethodsWe identified patients in the Pediatric Health Information System in Risk Adjustment for Congenital Heart Surgery 1 category 1 to 6 for 32 pediatric cardiac surgical procedures conducted between 2003 and 2011 (n =  67, 550). These were examined for their overall contribution to mortality, intensive care unit and hospital lengths of stay (coefficient of variation and excess days), adverse events, and readmission rates. A ranking scheme was created {{on the basis of the}} outcome measures. Then we ordered the procedures across metrics to develop a prioritization scheme. ResultsObserved mortality rates were consistent with published rates. A few <b>procedures</b> <b>accounted</b> <b>for</b> significant variation in hospital and intensive care length of stay across the hospitals. Likewise, a few <b>procedures</b> <b>accounted</b> <b>for</b> most excess days of stay and readmission rates. Up to 60 % of the hospital stay was <b>accounted</b> <b>for</b> by intensive care unit stay. Although there was a linear relationship between adverse event rates and Risk Adjustment for Congenital Heart Surgery 1 categories, a few <b>procedures</b> once again <b>accounted</b> <b>for</b> disproportionate event rates within and across their respective Risk Adjustment for Congenital Heart Surgery 1 categories.

The optimal limit in the number of applications balances the trade-off between being unmatched and gaining a better match in the aggregate, and the benefit can be considerable if the graduates' preferences over the positions are not very correlated. Overall, we suggest a direction to improve the matching market for PhD candidates by improving the outcome of their matches and lowering the hiring costs for universities. matching markets; truncation; Gale-Shapley deferred acceptance; congested markets; PhD academic job market; PhD graduates; graduate preferences; university hiring costs...|$|R
