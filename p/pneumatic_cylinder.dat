40|$|A new {{mathematical}} model of friction for <b>pneumatic</b> <b>cylinders</b> XB Tran, HT Dao and KD Tran This paper focuses on investigating friction behaviors in pre-sliding state {{and developing a}} new {{mathematical model}} of friction for <b>pneumatic</b> <b>cylinders.</b> Using <b>pneumatic</b> <b>cylinders</b> with different sizes, an experimental setup is made to measure friction force–displacement characteristics in pre-sliding state under various conditions of applied force and pressures in the cylinder chambers. A new mathematical model of friction is proposed by incorporating a hysteresis function into the new modified LuGre model. The friction behaviors of the <b>pneumatic</b> <b>cylinders</b> in pre-sliding state are clarified and {{the usefulness of the}} proposed mathematical model is verified through various experimental results...|$|R

50|$|<b>Pneumatic</b> <b>cylinder(s)</b> (sometimes {{known as}} air cylinders) are {{mechanical}} devices which {{use the power}} of compressed gas to produce a force in a reciprocating linear motion.|$|R
5000|$|Sometimes, however, crank-balanced units {{can become}} prohibitively heavy {{due to the}} need for counterweights. Currently, Lufkin Industries offer [...] "air-balanced" [...] units, where {{counterbalance}} is provided by a <b>pneumatic</b> <b>cylinder</b> charged with air from a compressor, eliminating the need for counterweights.|$|E
50|$|Although {{pneumatic}} cylinders will vary in appearance, size and function, they generally fall {{into one of}} the specific categories shown below. However, there are also numerous other types of <b>pneumatic</b> <b>cylinder</b> available, many of which are designed to fulfill specific and specialized functions.|$|E
50|$|Because the {{operating}} fluid is a gas, leakage from a <b>pneumatic</b> <b>cylinder</b> will not drip out and contaminate the surroundings, making pneumatics more desirable where cleanliness is a requirement. For example, in the mechanical puppets of the Disney Tiki Room, pneumatics {{are used to}} prevent fluid from dripping onto people below the puppets.|$|E
5000|$|The first {{generation}} of LEGO Pneumatics ran from 1984 through 1988. This generation is characterised by single port <b>pneumatic</b> <b>cylinders</b> and the more complex plumbing including a three port distribution block with a pressure and vacuum outlet port. These pressure and vacuum lines ran to a switch to provide pressure for extension or vacuum for retraction of the <b>pneumatic</b> <b>cylinders.</b> These are often falsely compared to single acting hydraulic cylinders that require gravity to retract. The difference is that these units retract on the application of vacuum.|$|R

50|$|In 1987 an {{assisted}} {{chin and}} dip machine was launched under Gravitron name. The original Gravitron used a compressor, accumulator, and <b>pneumatic</b> <b>cylinder</b> to provide programmable assistance to an exerciser. The pneumatic Gravitron proved {{a little too}} complex to maintain for the typical health club and was later replaced with the Gravitron 2000 AT, a weight-stack version.|$|E
50|$|In general, {{based on}} the application, a <b>pneumatic</b> <b>{{cylinder}}</b> is usually a single acting cylinder, {{where there is a}} single port in the cylinder and were cylinder extension is done by compressed air and retraction by means of open coiled spring. In double acting cylinders two ports both extend and retract by means of compressed air.|$|E
5000|$|The {{train stop}} system {{comprises}} two basic components. One is the trip arm mechanism, {{mounted on the}} ground adjacent to the rail, which essentially consists of a spring-loaded arm connected to an electric motor (or <b>pneumatic</b> <b>cylinder</b> in electro-pneumatic systems). The other is the train-mounted trip cock, which is connected either directly or electrically to the train's braking system.|$|E
50|$|On smaller autoclaves, {{rotation}} of the locking ring is sometimes accomplished by manually operated geared devices. On larger ones, <b>pneumatic</b> or hydraulic <b>cylinders</b> are used. <b>Pneumatic</b> <b>cylinders</b> often provide jerky rotation, but they may sometimes be safer because they generally cannot move the door ring as readily when there is much pressure against the door.|$|R

40|$|The {{problem of}} control of force exerted by <b>pneumatic</b> <b>cylinders</b> on the {{environment}} is of interest in industrial automation and systems such as legged robots. In this paper, a sliding mode fuzzy force control algorithm is proposed for <b>pneumatic</b> <b>cylinders.</b> The environment {{is assumed to be}} “soft ” or compliant and modeled as a spring. The advantage of the new controller is that being based on fuzzy logic, knowledge of the cylinder dynamics or disturbances such as friction is not necessary. The control law implementation is based explicitly on contact force measurements. The proposed algorithm is simple, robust, and easy to implement. Results of experimental implementation are presented to illustrate the practical effectiveness of the new method...|$|R
50|$|Frequently, a Hall sensor is {{combined}} with threshold detection so that it acts as and is called a switch. Commonly seen in industrial applications such as the pictured <b>pneumatic</b> <b>cylinder,</b> they are also used in consumer equipment; for example some computer printers use them to detect missing paper and open covers. They {{can also be used}} in computer keyboards applications that require ultra-high reliability.|$|E
50|$|Liquid rheostats were {{sometimes}} used in large (thousands of kilowatts/horsepower) wound rotor motor drives, {{to control the}} rotor circuit resistance and so {{the speed of the}} motor. Electrode position could be adjusted with a small electrically operated winch or a <b>pneumatic</b> <b>cylinder.</b> A cooling pump and heat exchanger were provided to allow slip energy to be dissipated into process water or other water system.|$|E
5000|$|In PAMs {{the force}} {{is not only}} {{dependent}} on pressure but also on their state of inflation. This {{is one of the}} major advantages; the mathematical model that supports the PAMs functionality is a non-linear system, which makes them much easier [...] than conventional <b>pneumatic</b> <b>cylinder</b> actuators to control precisely. The relationship between force and extension in PAMs mirrors what is seen in the length-tension relationship in biological muscle systems.|$|E
5000|$|Beginning 2008, LEGO has {{released}} several sets with mechanical linear actuators, {{which are used}} for the same purpose as the <b>pneumatic</b> <b>cylinders,</b> {{but the fact that}} they can easily be extended to intermediate points means that they approximate hydraulic cylinders more closely.|$|R
30|$|To {{verify the}} {{feasibility}} of 5 -TET, the dynamic simulation of locomotion and manipulation were carried out. 5 -TET has a total of 18 DOFs, 18 <b>pneumatic</b> <b>cylinders</b> were used to drive the 18 prismatic joints, so that the spherical joints are passive joints.|$|R
30|$|An {{optimization}} method {{based on}} a developed GA is proposed to optimize the motion of binary control 5 -TET mechanism. The 5 -TET currently realizes its locomotion by executing at most 5 <b>pneumatic</b> <b>cylinders</b> between each two steps, rather than using multiple actuators as before.|$|R
50|$|A {{fluid power}} system has a pump {{driven by a}} prime mover (such as an {{electric}} motor or internal combustion engine) that converts mechanical energy into fluid energy, Pressurized fluid is controlled and directed by valves into an actuator device such as a hydraulic cylinder or <b>pneumatic</b> <b>cylinder,</b> to provide linear motion, or a hydraulic motor or pneumatic motor, to provide rotary motion or torque. Rotary motion may be continuous or confined to less than one revolution.|$|E
50|$|Automatic feed {{riveting}} machines {{include a}} hopper and feed track which automatically delivers and presents the rivet to the setting tools which overcomes {{the need for}} the operator to position the rivet. The downward force required to deform the rivet with an automatic riveting machine is created by a motor and flywheel combination, <b>pneumatic</b> <b>cylinder,</b> or hydraulic cylinder. Manual feed riveting machines usually have a mechanical lever to deliver the setting force from a foot pedal or hand lever.|$|E
50|$|Boosters may {{be driven}} by an {{electric}} motor, hydraulics, low or high pressure air or manually by a lever system. Those powered by compressed air are usually linear actuated systems, where a <b>pneumatic</b> <b>cylinder</b> directly drives the compression piston, often in a common housing, separated by a seal. A high pressure pneumatic drive arrangement may use the same pressure as the output pressure to drive the piston, and a low pressure drive will use a larger diameter piston to multiply the applied force.|$|E
