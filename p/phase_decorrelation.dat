40|$|AbstractIsodipole textures are {{pairs of}} texture {{ensembles}} whose autocorrelations, and hence power spectra, are equal. Examples of readily discriminable isodipole textures are well known. Such discriminations appear to require feature extraction, since the isodipole condition eliminates ensemble differences in spatial frequency content. We studied {{the effects of}} <b>phase</b> <b>decorrelation</b> on VEP indices of discrimination of isodipole texture pairs. <b>Phase</b> <b>decorrelation,</b> which ranged from 0. 125 π radians (slight randomization) to π radians (complete randomization), was introduced in two ways: by independent jittering of each spatial Fourier component, and by a product method, which preserved correlations among certain quadruples of spatial Fourier components, despite pairwise decorrelation. For the even/random isodipole texture pair, independent <b>phase</b> <b>decorrelation</b> greater than 0. 5 π radians markedly reduced VEP indices of texture discrimination for all check sizes, and eliminated them entirely for check sizes of 8 min or greater. However, the product method preserved texture discrimination signals even with complete pairwise randomization of spatial phases. For the triangle/random isodipole texture pair, both kinds of <b>phase</b> <b>decorrelation</b> eliminated VEP indices of texture discrimination. These results imply that isodipole texture discrimination is based on fundamentally local processing, and not on global Fourier amplitudes—since the phase manipulations which eliminate texture discrimination preserve the Fourier amplitudes. The dependence of the antisymmetric response component (the odd harmonics) on <b>phase</b> <b>decorrelation</b> and texture type {{is consistent with a}} previously proposed model for feature extraction, and leads to constraints on how texture processing is modulated by contrast. The limited contribution of global spectral characteristics for small checks is consistent with a previously identified breakdown in scale-invariant processing...|$|E

40|$|Experiments for the {{development}} of fusion power that are based on magnetic confinement deal with plasmas that inevitably contain energetic (non-thermal) particles. These particles come e. g. from fusion reactions or from external heating of the plasma. Ensembles of energetic ions can excite plasma waves in the Alfvén frequency range {{to such an extent that}} the resulting wave fields redistribute the energetic ions, and potentially eject them from the plasma. The redistribution of ions may cause a substantial reduction heating efficiency, and it may damage the inner walls and other components of the vessel. Understanding the dynamics of such instabilities is necessary to optimise the operation of fusion experiments and of future fusion power plants. A Monte Carlo model that describes the nonlinear wave-particle dynamics in a toroidal plasma has been developed to study the excitation of the abovementioned instabilities. A decorrelation of the wave-particle phase is added in order to model stochasticity of the system (e. g. due to collisions between particles). Based on the nonlinear description with added <b>phase</b> <b>decorrelation,</b> a quasilinear version of the model has been developed, where the <b>phase</b> <b>decorrelation</b> has been replaced by a quasilinear diffusion coefficient in particle energy. When the characteristic time scale for macroscopic <b>phase</b> <b>decorrelation</b> becomes similar to or shorter than the time scales of nonlinear wave-particle dynamics, the two descriptions quantitatively agree on a macroscopic level. The quasilinear model is typically less computationally demanding than the nonlinear model, since it has a lower dimensionality of phase space. In the presented studies, several effects on the macroscopic wave-particle dynamics by the presence of <b>phase</b> <b>decorrelation</b> have been theoretically and numerically analysed, e. g. effects on the growth and saturation of the wave amplitude, and on the so called frequency chirping events with associated hole-clump pair formation in particle phase space. Several effects coming from structures of the energy distribution of particles around the wave-particle resonance has also been studied. QC 20150330 </p...|$|E

40|$|Interferometric {{synthetic}} aperture radar (InSAR) {{has emerged as a}} powerful geodetic imaging technique in the past two decades, focused on the retrieval of deformation, topography and even meteorological measurements by the analysis of phase components of complex-valued radar data. The strength of this technique lies in its abilities of all-weather, day and night data acquisition, high measurement accuracy and wide spatial scale. Although vast successful applications have been achieved, conventional InSAR technique possesses several limitations (e. g. <b>decorrelation,</b> <b>phase</b> unwrapping error and atmospheric artefacts), which, in turn, have motivated the development of advanced multi-temporal InSAR (MTInSAR) analysis techniques. Fusion of MTInSAR imagery of the same area has led to a marked improvement in the reliability and accuracy of derived products (e. g. deformation) and has also been important for gleaning dynamic signals of deformation over a wide range of temporal scales.

This paper reports on the analysis of the impact of these two factors on the performance of DInSAR for monitoring ground deformation. Simulations were carried out prior to real data analyses. SAR data acquired using different operating frequencies, for example, X-, C- and L-band, from the TerraSAR-X, ERS- 1 / 2, ENVISAT, JERS- 1 and ALOS satellite missions, were examined.

40|$|We use {{interferometric}} {{synthetic aperture}} radar (InSAR) and Global Positioning System (GPS) observations to investigate static deformation due to the 1999 M_w 7. 1 Hector Mine earthquake, {{that occurred in the}} eastern California shear zone. Interferometric <b>decorrelation,</b> <b>phase,</b> and azimuth offset measurements indicate regions of surface and near-surface slip, which we use to constrain the geometry of surface rupture. The inferred geometry is spatially complex, with multiple strands. The southern third of the rupture zone consists of three subparallel segments extending about 20 km in length in a N 45 °W direction. The central segment is the simplest, with a single strand crossing the Bullion Mountains and a strike of N 10 °W. The northern third of the rupture zone is characterized by multiple splays, with directions subparallel to strikes in the southern and central. The average strike for the entire rupture is about N 30 °W. The interferograms indicate significant along-strike variations in strain which are consistent with variations in the ground-based slip measurements. Using a variable resolution data sampling routine to reduce the computational burden, we invert the InSAR and GPS data for the fault geometry and distribution of slip. We compare results from assuming an elastic half-space and a layered elastic space. Results from these two elastic models are similar, although the layered-space model predicts more slip at depth than does the half-space model. The layered model predicts a maximum coseismic slip of more than 5 m at a depth of 3 to 6 km. Contrary to preliminary reports, {{the northern part of the}} Hector Mine rupture accommodates the maximum slip. Our model predictions for the surface fault offset and total seismic moment agree with both field mapping results and recent seismic models.

40|$|Lava flows {{continue}} to move {{after they have been}} emplaced by flow mechanisms. This movement is largely vertical and can be detected using differential synthetic aperture radar (SAR) interferometry. There are three main components to this motion: (1) movement of surface scatterers, resulting in radar <b>phase</b> <b>decorrelation,</b> (2) measurable subsidence of the flow surface due to thermal contraction and clast repacking, and (3) time-dependent depression of the flow substrate. These effects act in proportion to the thickness of the lava flow and decay with time, although there is a time lag before the third component becomes significant. We explore these effects using SAR data from the ERS satellites over the Etna volcano, Sicily. <b>Phase</b> <b>decorrelation</b> on young, thick a’a lava flows persists for a few years and probably results from surface block rotations during flow contraction. Maximum measured subsidence rates of the 1991 – 1993 lava flow over a period of 70 days are about 0. 7 mm day− 1, but are potentially greater in areas of data decorrelation. These rates fall to < 2. 7 × 10 − 2 [*]mm day− 1 after about 20 years in flows about 50 m thick, sooner for thinner flows. Comparison with measured subsidence rates on Kilauean lava lakes suggests that thermal contraction only accounts for about one third of the observed subsidence. The remaining motion is thought to come from surface clast repacking during cooling and from creep mechanisms in the flow substrate. Measurements of postemplacement surface movement provide new constraints on the thermomechanical properties of lava flows and have cautionary implications for the interpretation of interferometric SAR data of volcanoes. © 2001 American Geophysical Union...|$|E

A unified model is presented demonstrating that, given the standard deviation and correlation length of sidewall roughness, radiation loss and backscattering depend only on {{the sensitivity of the}} mode effective index to the waveguide width, independently of the waveguide technology and shape.

The Allan variance was computed in $XY$ mode as well as in radial mode for detecting different types of behavior for different space-scales, {{in the same way as}} the different types of noise versus the integration time in the classical time and frequency application. We found that radial Allan variance is the more appropriate way to have an estimator insensitive to the spatial axis and we applied it on SAR data acquired over eastern Turkey for the period 2003 - 2011. Spatial Allan variance allowed us to well characterize noise features, classically found in InSAR such as <b>phase</b> <b>decorrelation</b> producing white noise or atmospheric delays, behaving like a random walk signal. We finally applied the spatial Allan variance to an InSAR time ser- es to detect when the geophysical signal, here the ground motion, emerges from the nois...|$|E

Consequently, the need for long-term operational monitoring systems exists. Traditional field-based measurements are point-based meaning that {{the full extent of}} deforming areas is poorly understood. Field-based techniques are also labour intensive if large areas are to be monitored on a regular basis. To overcome these limitations, this investigation considered traditional and advanced differential radar interferometry techniques for their ability to monitor large areas over time, remotely. An area known to be experiencing mining induced surface deformation was used as test case. The agricultural nature of the area implied that signal decorrelation effects were expected. Consequently, four sources of data, captured at three wavelengths by earth-orbiting satellites were obtained. This provided the opportunity to investigate different <b>phase</b> <b>decorrelation</b> effects on data from standard imaging platforms using real-world deformation phenomenon as test-case. The data were processed using standard dInSAR and polInSAR techniques. The deformation measurement results together with an analysis of parameters most detrimental to long-term monitoring were presented. The results revealed that, contrary to the hypothesis, polInSAR techniques did not provide an enhanced ability to monitor surface deformation compared to dInSAR techniques. Although significant improvements in coherence values were obtained, the spatial heterogeneity of phase measurements could not be improved. Consequently, polInSAR could not overcome ecorrelation associated with vegetation cover and evolving land surfaces. However, polarimetric information could be used to assess the scattering behaviour of the surface, thereby guiding the definition of optimal sensor configuration for long-term monitoring. Despite temporal and geometric decorrelation, the results presented demonstrated that mining-induced deformation could be measured and monitored using dInSAR techniques. Large areas could be monitored remotely and the areal extent of deforming areas could be assessed, effectively overcoming the limitations of field-based techniques. Consequently, guidelines for the optimal sensor configuration and image acquisition strategy for long-term operational monitoring of mining-induced surface deformation were provided...|$|E
40|$|The use of L-band InSAR {{data for}} observing the surface {{displacements}} caused by earthquakes {{can be very}} beneficial. The retrieved signal is generally more stable against temporal <b>phase</b> <b>decorrelation</b> with respect to C-band and X-band InSAR data, such that fault movements also in vegetated areas can be observed. Also, due to the longer wavelength, larger displacement gradients occurring particularly close to the ruptures can be measured. A serious draw back of L-band data {{on the other hand}} is that it more strongly reacts to heterogeneities in the ionosphere. The spatial variability of the electron content causes spatially long wavelength trends in the interferometric phase, distorts the surface deformation signal therefore impacts on the earthquake source analysis. A well-known example of the long-wavelength distortions are the ALOS- 1 InSAR observations of the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake. To mitigate the effect of ionospheric phase in the modelling of earthquake sources, a common procedure is to remove any obvious linear or quadratic trend in the displacement data that may have been caused by ionospheric phase delays. Additionally, remaining trends may be accounted for by including so-called ambiguity (or nuisance) parameters in the modelling. The introduced ionospheric distortion, however, is only approximated arbitrarily by such simple ramp functions with the true ionospheric phase screen unknown. As a consequence, either a remaining ionospheric signal may be mistaken for surface displacement or, the other way around, long-wavelength surface displacement may be attributed to ionospheric distortion and is removed. The bias introduced to the source modelling results by the assumption of linear or quadratic ionospheric effects is therefore unknown as well. We present a more informed and physics-based correction of the surface displacement data in earthquake source modelling by using a split-spectrum method to estimate the ionospheric phase screen superimposed to the interferogram. This method is based on the dispersive nature of the ionosphere and separates the ionospheric component of the interferometric phase from the non-dispersive component related to topography, ground motion, and tropospheric path delay. We study the ionospheric bias on the fault modelling results in a real-data case study of a non-complex earthquake rupture using the ionospheric phase screen estimations and the uninformed ramp removal in comparison. The test earthquake is the March 24 2011 Myanmar earthquake (Mw 6. 8), which is covered by ALOS- 1. Here, the coseismic interferograms of both ascending and descending tracks show significant ionospheric distortions. We use the standard formulations of rectangular dislocations in an elastic half-space and run fully non-linear optimizations of the first-order fault parameters. We complement the optimization with a Bayesian model parameter uncertainties estimation to quantify the modelling bias in source model estimation with arbitrarily trend-corrected L-band displacement data compared to the correction based on the estimated ionospheric phase screen.
