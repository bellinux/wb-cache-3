50|$|In 2001, the EPA placed new {{restrictions}} {{on the use of}} the organophosphates <b>phosmet</b> and azinphos-methyl to increase protection of agricultural workers. The crop uses reported at that time as being phased out in four years included those for almonds, tart cherries, cotton, cranberries, peaches, pistachios, and walnuts. The crops with time-limited registration included apples/crab apples, blueberries, sweet cherries, pears, pine seed orchards, brussels sprouts, cane berries, and the use of azinphos-methyl by nurseries for quarantine requirements. The labeled uses of <b>phosmet</b> include alfalfa, orchard crops (e.g. almonds, walnuts, apples, cherries), blueberries, citrus, grapes, ornamental trees (not for use in residential, park, or recreational areas) and nonbearing fruit trees, Christmas trees and conifers (tree farms), potatoes, and peas.

50|$|The Phillips Inquiry {{rejected}} the original organophosphate hypothesis because the BSE epidemic continued even after <b>phosmet</b> use had become minimal yet most importantly because the original theory did not comport with {{the differences in}} BSE incidence between Guernsey and Jersey (opposite from what the original theory predicted).|$|E

5000|$|One {{aspect of}} ongoing {{research}} has been {{an examination of the}} flawed official scientific reasoning during the UK BSE crisis.

The theory that BSE was caused by a reaction to the use of organophosphorus compounds (OPs) poured on cattle as systemic pesticides cannot be reconciled with the epidemiology and is not supported by research.

50|$|The {{treatments}} {{are carried out}} by spraying the olive trees with insecticides (dimethoate, deltamethrin, and <b>phosmet).</b> Dimethoate is commonly used for its effectiveness and relatively low cost. It may be preferable because it would leave few residues in olive oil, since it is water-soluble and would pass through the amurca. In the near future, legislative authorization for the withdrawal of use of dimethoate is to be implemented. Among the products with low impact, azadirachtin is a natural repellent extracted from {{the fruits of the}} neem tree. However, its effectiveness against the olive fruit fly has not yet been sufficiently tested. Among the organic insecticide literature, rotenone is also mentioned, but the use of this active ingredient, not readily available, must be authorized by established competent bodies after demonstrating the need for it.|$|E
5000|$|Purdey's {{interest}} in the disease was triggered when four cows he purchased for his farm developed the disease, though no animal raised on his farm ever contracted it. He also became aware of a fact also considered by the Philips Inquiry: [...] "1145. The practice in the UK of recycling animal protein as an ingredient of animal feed dates back to at least 1926. In the 1970s attention was directed within MAFF to the danger that this practice {{would result in the}} spread of infectious diseases. The diseases considered were those caused by conventional viral and bacterial organisms. No consideration appears to have been given to the risk that scrapie might be recycled in sheep, or even transmitted to other farm animals. This may seem surprising. The answer probably {{lies in the fact that}} half a century had elapsed without any indication that animal feed containing ovine protein was infecting sheep or any other animal." [...] Purdey published a number of papers in which he set down his belief that BSE was a transmissible disease that had an environmental cause. He suggested this cause might be <b>Phosmet,</b> a systemic organophosphate insecticide that was being spread along the spines of intensively farmed cows to eradicate warble fly. Purdey believed that the chemicals, derived from military nerve gases, disturbed the balance of metals in the animals' brains, namely reducing copper and increasing manganese, giving rise to the misfolded proteins called prions that are regarded as the cause of BSE. Through the High Court, he successfully challenged the British government's compulsory warble fly eradication program, which would have compelled him to treat his own cattle with the insecticide.|$|E

40|$|<b>Phosmet</b> is an {{organophosphate}} pesticide {{registered for}} control of insects {{on a variety of}} crops, mainly fruits and nuts, and for direct animal treatments to control pests on cattle, swine, and dogs. <b>Phosmet</b> is slightly to highly toxic to a variety of fish species and is very highly toxic to aquatic invertebrates. An ecological risk assessment that includes nontarget aquatic organisms was prepared by OPP’s Environmental Fate and Effects Division (EFED) in 1998, and an Interim Reregistration Eligibility Decision (IRED) was issued in October of 2001. That assessment identified overall concerns, except for alfalfa, for endangered fish and was the basis for this current, more site-specific assessment for Federally listed Pacific salmon and steelhead. A subsequent agreement between the <b>phosmet</b> registrant and the Agency resulted in voluntary cancellation of all products used in or around homes and pets, high-pressure hose use on cattle, and agricultural use on sweet corn and citrus. In addition, eight uses will be granted a timelimited registration for five years; application intervals and rates were also modified for many uses. In this assessment, OPP has determined that the use of <b>phosmet</b> in accordance with label conditions will have no effect on 13 salmon and steelhead Evolutionarily Significant Units (ESUs) and that <b>phosmet</b> may affect, but is not likely to adversely affect 13 ESUs.

Preliminary biodegradation experiments showed that the target molecule was not assimilated by activated sludge. The pre-treatment consisted of potentiostatic electrolysis (− 1. 3 V/SCE) in a flow cell. After only one pass (1 mL min− 1), cyclic voltammetry with a vitreous carbon electrode showed a total <b>phosmet</b> reduction in neutral medium confirmed by thin layer chromatography, which also highlighted the presence of several by-products.

Using a worstcase scenario approach, secondary exposure to three organophosphorus insecticides, (<b>phosmet,</b> azinphosmethyl and phosalone), two anticoagulant rodenticides, (chlorophacinone and diphacinone), and residues of previously applied organochlorines, particularly DDT and metabolites, was assessed. Exposure to PCBs and trace metals was also considered. Small mammal species preyed upon by Screech-owls were captured in orchards for residue analysis on a continual basis for persistent compounds or after insecticide and rodenticide applications. Beginning {{in the winter of}} 2000, 98 nest boxes were constructed and installed in woods inhabited by Screech-owls, adjacent to orchards. These boxes were then repeatedly inspected for pellets and prey remains. Estimated exposure of Screech-owls 0 - 60 hr post-application was 0. 641 mg/kg for <b>phosmet</b> and azinphosmethyl and 0. 401 mg/kg for phosalone. Exposure to <b>phosmet</b> at this level may warrant concern. The acute poison zinc phosphide is now the primary means of small mammal control in the study area and the possibility of exposure to anticoagulant rodenticides is diminishing.

In the state of Maine, lowbush blueberries are commercially managed and harvested each year to be marketed as either IQF (individually quick fiozen) or fiesh pack. Since IQF berries are processed at the field level, post-harvest treatments must be effective in ensuring crop quality and safety.

Omethoate, chloropyrifos-methyl and esfenvalerate were assessed as harmful {{and should not}} be sprayed. Mancozeb-efosite-Al mixture, diazinon, dicofol, bromopropylate, anziphos-ethyl and <b>phosmet</b> were assessed as moderately harmful. Fenitrothion, phosalone and manzcozeb were assessed as slightly harmful and some of them had delayed detrimental effect on the predatory mites. These pesticides can be used only cautiously in IPM programs. Sulphur, penconazole, trimorfamid and endosulfan were assessed as harmless and can be recommended for vineyards with T. pyriAvailable from STL Prague, CZ / NTK - National Technical LibrarySIGLECZCzech Republi...|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} {{compounds}} representing four major pesticide groups were tested for toxicity to beneficial insects representing four different insect orders: Coleoptera (Coccinellidae), Hemiptera (Anthocoridae), Hymenoptera (Aphelinidae), and Neuroptera (Chrysopidae). These materials included organophosphates (methidathion, esfenvalerate and <b>phosmet),</b> carbamates (carbofuran, methomyl and carbaryl), pyrethroids (bifenthrin, fenpropathrin, zeta-cypermethrin, cyfluthrin and permethrin) and the oxadiazine indoxacarb. Toxicity to coccinellid and lacewing species {{was assessed by}} treating 1 st instar larvae with the recommended field rate of commercial products, and two 10 fold dilutions of these materials, in topical spray applications. Adult Aphytis melinus Debach and 2 nd instar Orius insidiosus (Say) were exposed to leaf residues of the same concentrations for 24 h. ANOVA performed on composite survival indices derived from these data resolved significant differences among materials {{with respect to their}} overall toxicity to beneficial insects. Cyfluthrin, fenpropathrin and zeta-cypermethrin all increased the developmental time of the lacewing and one or more coccinellid species for larvae that survived topical applications. Bifenthrin increased developmental time for two coccinellid species and decreased it in a third. Indoxacarb (Avaunt® WG, DuPont Corp.) ranked highest overall for safety to beneficial insects, largely because of its low dermal toxicity to all species tested. Zeta-cypermethrin (Super Fury®, FMC Corporation) received the second best safety rating, largely because of its low toxicity as a leaf residue to A. melinus and O. insidiosus. <b>Phosmet</b> (Imidan® 70 W, Gowan Co.) and methidathion (Supracide® 25 W, Gowan Co.) ranked high for safety to coccinellid species, but compounds currently recommended for use in citrus such as fenpropathrin (Danitol® 2. 4 EC, Sumimoto Chem. Co.) and carbaryl (Sevin® XLR EC, Rhone Poulenc Ag. Co.) ranked very low for IPM-compatibility based on their relatively high toxicity to all species tested...|$|E
