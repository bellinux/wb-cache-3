50|$|In 1909, {{while working}} at Benz, he {{patented}} a <b>precombustion</b> <b>chamber</b> (DRP 230517, 14 March 1909) which made possible compact, lightweight diesel engines.|$|E
50|$|This chamber {{is located}} at the {{cylinder}} head and is connected to the engine cylinder by small holes. It occupies 40% of the total cylinder volume. During the compression stroke, air from the main cylinder enters the <b>precombustion</b> <b>chamber.</b> At this moment, fuel is injected into the <b>precombustion</b> <b>chamber</b> and combustion begins. Pressure increases and the fuel droplets are forced through the small holes into the main cylinder, resulting in a very good mix of the fuel and air. The bulk of the combustion actually takes place in the main cylinder. This type of combustion chamber has multi-fuel capability because the temperature of the prechamber vaporizes the fuel before the main combustion event occurs.|$|E
50|$|Prosper L'Orange (born 1 February 1876, Beirut; died 30 July 1939, Stuttgart) was a German {{engineer}} and inventor who pioneered the <b>precombustion</b> <b>chamber</b> (or prechamber), which made possible high-speed diesel engines {{that did not}} require an air compressor, and enabled them to be built small enough for use in road vehicles.|$|E
50|$|The F8x is the {{indirect}} injected Diesel version {{and has an}} 8-valve SOHC architecture, it uses <b>precombustion</b> <b>chambers</b> achieve the required air/fuel mixing.|$|R
5|$|One of {{the major}} {{applications}} of sintered silicon nitride is in automobile industry as a material for engine parts. Those include, in diesel engines, glowplugs for faster start-up; <b>precombustion</b> <b>chambers</b> (swirl chambers) for lower emissions, faster start-up and lower noise; turbocharger for reduced engine lag and emissions. In spark-ignition engines, silicon nitride is used for rocker arm pads for lower wear, turbocharger for lower inertia and less engine lag, and in exhaust gas control valves for increased acceleration. As examples of production levels, there is an estimated more than 300,000 sintered silicon nitride turbochargers made annually.|$|R
50|$|The OM 138 has one {{cylinder}} head {{for all four}} cylinders. The main part are the precombustion chambers. They are located in a 45° angle above the combustion chamber {{and placed in a}} bulge in the {{cylinder head}}. Like other early OM diesel engines, the OM 138 has a sieve for fuel spraying purposes between the main combustion chamber and <b>precombustion</b> <b>chamber.</b> The injection nozzles inject fuel into the precombustion chambers, they are mounted on the cylinder head and can be maintained with ease. The glowplugs are mounted underneath the injection nozzles and are easily accessible as well. On it′s <b>precombustion</b> <b>chamber</b> side, the cylinder head also has the pushrods necessary for the OHV valvetrain. The intake and outlet are at the opposite side; the intake manifold {{is a part of the}} cylinder head and located at it′s top.|$|E
50|$|Heavy duty {{gas engines}} may employ precombustion {{chambers}} in the cylinder head. A lean gas and air mixture is first highly compressed {{in the main}} chamber by the piston. A much richer, though much lesser volume gas/air mixture is introduced to the <b>precombustion</b> <b>chamber</b> and ignited by spark plug. The flame front spreads to the lean gas air mixture in the cylinder.|$|E
50|$|The <b>precombustion</b> <b>chamber</b> {{patented}} in 1909 by L'Orange {{connects to}} the engine cylinder via a restricted passage, or burner. In operation, a narrow cone of fuel is sprayed down towards the burner by the single orifice injector nozzle. At this time the technology did not exist to manufacture nozzles with multiple orifices and diesels used high pressure air to spray the fuel directly into the cylinder. L'Orange also discovered that indirect injection diesel engines ran more smoothly and quietly than direct injection engines. Use of a <b>precombustion</b> <b>chamber</b> also reduced stress on the engine's structure, {{so that it could}} be made less heavy than a direct injection engine. However, indirect injection engines require higher compression ratios, about 20:1, to compensate for the greater surface to volume ratio causing more heat loss from the cylinder charge. They are also more difficult to start when cold, therefore the precombustion chambers are fitted with electrically heated glowplugs.|$|E
50|$|The OM 138 is a {{naturally}} aspirated and water-cooled inline-four-cylinder diesel engine with <b>precombustion</b> <b>chamber</b> injection, wet sump lubrication and OHV valvetrain. It′s displacement is 2,54 l. The bore is 90 mm, the stroke 100 mm, {{this gives the}} OM 138 a high rotational speed of 3000 rpm as a car engine and 2800 rpm as a truck engine. The rated power is 33 kW (45 PS).|$|E
5000|$|The {{engine of}} the 401 is a car engine, type OM 636 VI. This engine is a {{water-cooled}} naturally aspirated straight-four-diesel with <b>precombustion</b> <b>chamber</b> injection, OHV-valvetrain and a displacement of 1767 cm3. Its standard power output is , this figure was reduced to [...] at 2350 min−1 for the Unimog. The OM 636 is mounted slightly inclined towards the rear, {{in the front of}} the Unimog. It has an electric starter.|$|E
5000|$|The OM616 was a 2.4 L (2404 cc) engine {{with power}} output of 65 hp (48 kW). In August 1978 the <b>precombustion</b> <b>chamber</b> was updated for more swirl and more {{efficient}} combustion. The new camshaft pushes the valves deeper so the air and smoke gases have less resistance. The engine capacity was lowered to (2399 cc) to satisfy engine displacement tax laws in Europe, but power output rose to 72 hp (54 kW).A similar technique power update around these time was also done on the OM615 and OM617.|$|E
5000|$|Because {{the heat}} and {{pressure}} of combustion is applied to one specific point on the piston as it exits the <b>precombustion</b> <b>chamber</b> or swirl chamber, such engines are less suited to high specific power outputs (such as turbocharging or tuning) than direct injection diesels. The increased temperature and pressure on {{one part of the}} piston crown causes uneven expansion which can lead to cracking, distortion or other damage due to improper use; use of [...] " [...] starting fluid" [...] (ether) is not recommended in glow plug, indirect injection systems, because explosive knock can occur, causing engine damage.|$|E
50|$|The OM 636 is a {{water-cooled}} inline-four-cylinder {{diesel engine}} with <b>precombustion</b> <b>chamber</b> injection, OHV valvetrain and wet sump lubrication. Both the cylinder {{head and the}} cylinder block are made of grey cast iron. Both the crankshaft, which is supported in three bearings, and the connection rods are forged. The pistons are made of a light metal alloy. In the cylinder head, the OM 636 has two overhead valves per cylinder. The camshaft is driven by gears, it also drives the injection pump. The inlet and the precombustion chambers are on the left engine side, the outlet, camshaft and injection pump are placed on the right engine side.|$|E
5000|$|This was {{introduced}} with the W123 series. It was originally 80 PS (79 hp/59 kW.) This engine {{had a few}} improvements over the [...]910, mainly in the air, fuel, and oil system, {{to adapt to the}} 123 chassis. In August 1979 the <b>precombustion</b> <b>chamber</b> was updated for more swirl and more efficient combustion. The new camshaft pushed the valves deeper so the air and exhaust gases had less resistance. By changing the bore to 90.9 mm, the engine capacity was lowered to 2998 cc to satisfy engine displacement tax laws in Europe, but power output rose to 88 PS (87 hp/65 kW). Torque remained at 172 Nm @ 2400 rpm.|$|E
5000|$|Initially, the {{water-cooled}} straight-six <b>precombustion</b> <b>chamber</b> {{diesel engine}} type OM 312 powered the Unimog 406. It has a displacement of [...] and produces roughly 48 kW @ 2,550 rpm. In 1964, this engine {{was replaced with}} the direct injected straight-six diesel OM 352 that was kept in production until 1989. The OM 352 displaces [...] and is naturally aspirated in the Unimog version, its power output figure was changed over the production period several times, however, the standard power output never exceeded 62 kW. The air-inlet {{is on the left}} hand side of the Unimog 406, a snorkel was a factory option. Depending on the gearbox, the Unimog 406 was equipped either with a single disc dry clutch (usually type G 280 KR) or a dual clutch.|$|E
5000|$|The Unimog 406 is an {{all-wheel drive}} truck made by Mercedes-Benz made from 1963 to 1989. It {{is part of}} the Unimog (Universal-Motor-Gerät) series that {{originated}} int he 1940s. A total of 37,069 units of the 406 were manufactured at Daimler-Benz AG's Mercedes-Benz-Werk Gaggenau. It was the first medium duty Unimog, having a larger wheelbase of [...] and more than twice the engine power of the Unimog 401. Unlike the initial Unimog, the 406 does not have a car engine but a high capacity truck engine. Several later Unimog versions were based on the 406. The 406 were made in 12 versions, including a closed-top two-door or four-door cab, an open-top Cabrio, and as a [...] "half" [...] Unimog OEM part of third-party vehicles, such as a road-rail vehicle capable of towing [...] During its production period, the 406 received several technical refinements. In 1964, the <b>precombustion</b> <b>chamber</b> diesel engine OM 312 was replaced with the direct injected OM 352. Disc brakes followed in 1973.|$|E

40|$|The work {{reported}} in this article investigates the influences of inlet boundary conditions on the <b>precombustion</b> <b>chamber</b> internal flow patterns, validated by experimental data. An axial fixed-vane swirling diffuser with 12 vanes of declining angle 20 ° {{is used for the}} primary air flow. For the swirling air flow inlet boundary condition specifications, two methods are compared employing the standard κ-ε turbulence model The conventional method is to specify the inlet velocities based on totally constant axial and tangential momentum fluxes. For the new method, the whole simulation domain is extended to the supply duct, and detailed air flows between the supply swirling diffuser and <b>precombustion</b> <b>chamber</b> are linked using the multigrid technique. Comparisons with experimental data reveal that the new method can more accurately predict turbulent airflows and mixing processes near the swirling diffuser, and consequently more accurately predict the size of the recirculation zone, and farther downstream velocities and air jet mass fractions.

40|$|Presented {{here are}} the results of {{performance}} tests made with a single-cylinder, four stroke cycle, compression-ignition engine. These tests were made on a <b>precombustion</b> <b>chamber</b> type of cylinder head designed to have air velocity and tangential air flow in both the chamber and cylinder. The performance was investigated for variable load and engine speed, type of fuel spray, valve opening pressure, injection period and, for the spherical chamber, position of the injection spray relative to the air flow. The pressure variations between the pear-shaped <b>precombustion</b> <b>chamber</b> and the cylinder for motoring and full load conditions were determined with a Farnboro electric indicator. The combustion chamber designs tested gave good mixing of a single compact fuel spray with the air, but did not control the ensuing combustion sufficiently. Relative to each other, the velocity of air flow was too high, the spray dispersion by injection too great, and the metering effect of the cylinder head passage insufficient.

40|$|In the {{previous}} work, it was confirmed {{that a small}} <b>precombustion</b> <b>chamber</b> four-cycle diesel engine was operated well by rape-seed oil only. For obtaining engine performance equal to that of gas oil, it is necessary to adapt the test engine to the physical and chemical characteristics of rape-seed oil fuel. In the present studies, the effects of nozzle hole dimensions, injection pressure, and injection fuel temperature on engine performance were examined. The results showed that engine performance characteristics were improved in a certain injection pressure by use of rape-seed oil fuel. ...|$|E

For the purpose of application of rape-seed oil to small diesel engines, a <b>precombustion</b> <b>chamber</b> four-cycle diesel engine was operated with gas oil and rape-seed oil as alternate fuels. Experimental variables included engine speed and power. The effects of these variables upon engine thermal efficiency, specific fuel consumption, charging efficiency, air-fuel ratio, exhaust gas temperature, and cylinder pressure was investigated. Engine performance characteristics for the rape-seed oil fuel were studied and compared with baseline values for normal diesel fuel operation. ...|$|E

For the calculation of the heat transfer in both main chamber and prechamber, a turbulence model is proposed. Inside the throat connecting the two chambers, heat exchange takes place between gas and walls.

40|$|Formaldehyde is an air toxic that is {{typically}} emitted from natural gas-fired internal combustion engines {{as a product}} of incomplete combustion. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulates air toxic emissions, including formaldehyde, from stationary reciprocating internal combustion engines. National air toxic standards are required under the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments. This work investigates the effect that hardware modifications, or retrofit technologies, have on formaldehyde emissions from a large bore natural gas engine.

40|$|Several {{investigations}} {{have been made}} on single-cylinder test engines to determine the performance characteristics of four types of combustion chambers designed for aircraft oil engines. Two of the combustion chambers studied were bulb-type precombustion chambers, the connecting orifice of one having been designed to produce high turbulence by tangential air flow in both the <b>precombustion</b> <b>chamber</b> and the cylinder. The other two were integral combustion chambers, one being dome-shaped and the other pent-roof shaped.

40|$|The {{combustion}} {{behavior of}} different hybrid rocket fuels has been analyzed {{in the frame}} of this research. Tests have been performed in a 2 D slab burner configuration with windows on two sides. Four different liquefying paraffin-based fuels, hydroxyl terminated polybutadiene (HTPB) and high-density polyethylene (HDPE) have been tested in combination with gaseous oxygen (GOX). Experimental high-speed video data have been analyzed manually and with the proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) technique. Application of POD enables the recognition of the main structures of the flow field and the combustion flame appearing in the video data. These results include spatial and temporal analysis of the structures. For liquefying fuels these spatial values relate to the wavelengths associated to the Kelvin Helmholtz Instability (KHI). A theoretical long-wave solution of the KHI problem shows good agreement with the experimental results. Distinct frequencies found in the POD analysis can be related to the <b>precombustion</b> <b>chamber</b> configuration which can lead to vortex shedding phenomena...|$|E
40|$|The {{clearance}} {{distribution in}} a <b>precombustion</b> <b>chamber</b> cylinder head was varied so {{that for a}} constant compression ratio of 13. 5 the spherical auxiliary chambers contained 20, 35, 50, and 70 per cent of the total clearance volume. Each chamber {{was connected to the}} cylinder by a single circular passage, flared at both ends, and of a cross-sectional area proportional to the chamber volume, thereby giving the same calculated air-flow velocity through each passage. Results of engine-performance tests are presented with variations of power, fuel consumption, explosion pressure, rate of pressure rise, ignition lag, heat loss to the cooling water, and motoring characteristics. For good performance the minimum auxiliary chamber volume, with the cylinder head design used, was 35 per cent of the total clearance volume; for larger volumes the performance improves but slightly. With the auxiliary chamber that contained 35 percent of the clearance volume there were obtained the lowest explosion pressures, medium rates of pressure rise, and slightly less than the maximum power. For all clearance distributions an increase in engine speed decreased the ignition lag in seconds and increased the rate of pressure rise...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a model for}} thermo-acoustic effects in a gas turbine combustor. A quarter-wavelength burner with rectangular cross-section has been built and studied from an experimental and theoretical perspective. It has a premixed methane-air flame, which is held by a bluff body, and spans {{the width of the}} burner. The flame is compact, i. e. its length is much smaller than that of the burner. The fundamental mode of the burner is unstable; its frequency and pressure distribution have been measured. The complex pressure reflection coefficients at the upstream and downstream end of the burner were also measured. For the theoretical considerations, we divide the burner into three regions (the cold pre-combustion chamber, the flame region and the hot outlet region), and assume one-dimensional acoustic wave propagation in each region. The acoustic pressure and velocity are assumed continuous across the interface between the <b>precombustion</b> <b>chamber</b> and flame region, and across the interface between the flame region and outlet region. The burner ends are modelled by the measured pressure reflection coefficients. The mean temperature is assumed to have the following profile: uniformly cold and uniformly hot in the pre-combustion chamber and outlet region, respectively, and rising continuously from cold to hot in the flame region. For comparison, a discontinuous temperature profile, jumping directly from cold to hot, is also considered. The eigenfrequencies are calculated, and the pressure distribution of the fundamental mode is predicted. There is excellent agreement with the experimental results. The exact profile of the mean temperature in the flame region is found to be unimportant. This study gives us an experimentally validated Green's function, which is a very useful tool for further theoretical studies...|$|E
40|$|This report {{documents}} the second year's effort towards a 3 -year program to develop micropilot ignition systems for existing pipeline compressor engines. In essence, all Phase II {{goals and objectives}} were met. We intend {{to proceed with the}} Phase III research plan, as set forth by the applicable Research Management Plan. The objective for Phase II was to further develop and optimize the micropilot ignition system for large bore, slow speed engines operating at low compression ratios. The primary elements of Micropilot Phase II were to evaluate the results for the 4 -cylinder system prototype developed for Phase I, then optimize this system to demonstrate the technology's readiness for the field demonstration phase. In all, there were twelve (12) tasks defined and executed to support objectives in a stepwise fashion. Task-specific approaches and results are documented in this report. Research activities for Micropilot Phase II were conducted with the understanding that the efforts are expected to result in a commercial product to capture and disseminate the efficiency and environmental benefits of this new technology. Commercially-available fuel injection products were identified and applied to the program where appropriate. Modifications to existing engine components were kept to a minimum. This approach will minimize the overall time-to-market requirements, while meeting performance and cost criteria. The optimized four-cylinder system data demonstrated significant progress compared to Phase I results, as well as traditional spark ignition systems. An extensive testing program at the EECL using the GMV- 4 test engine demonstrated that: (1) In general, the engine operated more stable fewer misfires and partial combustion events when using the 3 -hole injectors compared to the 5 -hole injectors used in Phase I. (2) The engine had, in general, a wider range of operation with the 3 -hole injectors. Minimum operational boost levels were approximately 5 ''Hg lower and the minimum pilot quantity that the engine would operate on was roughly cut in half. (3) A successful concept demonstration of engine lube oil pilot injection was performed where the minimum operational boost was reduced by another 5 ''Hg to a boost level of 3 ''Hg; this is, depending on altitude, in the range of boost levels of many blower and piston scavenged low BMEP engines. (4) Micropilot ignition compares very favorably to other ignitions systems. The performance of micropilot ignition with mechanical gas admission valves is very similar to the performance of <b>precombustion</b> <b>chamber</b> ignition with high pressure fuel injection. Compared to spark ignition with mechanical gas admission valves the lean limit of operation is extended by about 5 ''Hg. These laboratory results will be enhanced, demonstrated and commercialized by others, with management and support from CSU, during Phase III of the Micropilot Ignition program...|$|E
