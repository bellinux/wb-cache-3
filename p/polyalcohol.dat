It was found that in baths containing sorbitol or mannitol, the deposition current density (jd) was reduced, but in none of the baths was the initial deposition potential affected. SEM images of deposits revealed that the boric-sorbitol and boric-mannitol complexes refine the grain, even at high jd. XRD patterns of the ZnNi deposits produced at jd= 50 mAcm− 2, in ZnNi 1 bath and in ZnNi 1 bath contained sorbitol or mannitol, indicated that the films were formed mainly of Zn and γ 1 phases.

The present work is based on the analysis of these products using IATROSCAN TLC/FID analyzer. Glycols and saccharides have very close Rf values and so their peaks tend to merge. A number of solvent systems have been studied to get separation of <b>polyalcohols</b> and a novel solvent system CHCl 3 -MeOH (60 : 36) was found to give separate peaks of glucose, fructose and sucrose.

40|$|Dielectric {{relaxation}} spectroscopy {{of glass}} forming liquids normally exhibits a relaxation scenario {{that seems to}} be surprisingly general. However, the relaxation dynamics is more complicated for hydrogen bonded liquids. For instance, the dielectric response of monoalcohols is dominated by a mysterious Debye-like process at lower frequencies than the structural alpha-relaxation that is normally dominating the spectra of glass formers. For <b>polyalcohols</b> this process has been thought to be absent or possibly obscured by a strong contribution from conductivity and polarization effects at low frequencies. We here show that the Debye-like process, although much less prominent, is also present in the response of <b>polyalcohols.</b> It can be observed in the derivative of the real part of the susceptibility or directly in the imaginary part if the conductivity contribution is reduced by covering the upper electrode with a thin Teflon layer.

Binding of polysaccharide to non-encapsulated cryptococci occurred rapidly over a 30 -min period and was largely complete after 2 h. Bound, labeled polysaccharide was slowly eluted from Cryptococcus neoformans after the addition of unlabeled polysaccharide, indicating reversibility of binding. Non-encapsulated cryptococci bound polysaccharide in two ways. Specific binding to the yeast was saturable by ca. 82 ng of polysaccharide per 10 (6) yeast cells. Nonspecific binding also occurred which was not saturable under the conditions used in our experiments. Phagocytosis of the non-encapsulated yeast strain was inhibited when the specific binding was ca. 50 % saturated. Binding of polysaccharide to an encapsulated strain showed nonspecific, nonsaturable binding, but little specific binding occurred. Presumably the specific binding sites were saturated in the encapsulated strain. Polysaccharides obtained from a hypocapsular mutant (A 61) and a normally encapsulated strain competed effectively with labeled serotype D polysaccharide for binding sites on non-encapsulated cryptococci and had identical phagocytosis-inhibiting properties. Similarly, polysaccharides from all four cryptococcal serotypes competed effectively with labeled serotype D polysaccharide for binding sites on the non-encapsulated strain, and all four polysaccharides inhibited phagocytosis of non-encapsulated Cryptococcus neoformans.
