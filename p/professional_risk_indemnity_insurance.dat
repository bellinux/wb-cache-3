40|$|The {{relationships}} between audit failure, judicial fault-finding {{and the availability}} of professional <b>indemnity</b> <b>insurance</b> have been debated by legal and accounting writers in both academic and professional circles. This paper adds an historical perspective to the current literature by presenting a review of cases involving allegations of auditors’ negligence over a fifty year period starting with the first significant case involving the question of auditors’ duties. Amateur auditors who failed to carry out a proper audit could expect little sympathy in the professional press but when large law suits were brought against recognised accountants, the profession was forced to consider the risks of the consequences of adverse judicial decisions. It was not long before practitioners sought to manage those <b>risks</b> through <b>professional</b> <b>indemnity</b> <b>insurance.</b> However, we find no evidence that the availability of insurance increased auditors’ risk by opening the floodgates of litigation...|$|R

40|$|M. Tech. Architectural TechnologyThe {{research}} {{is focused on}} professional <b>indemnity</b> <b>insurance</b> for architects in Namibia. Professional <b>indemnity</b> <b>insurance</b> is not currently provided for in both the Architects' and Quantity Surveyors Act (Act 13 of 1979) of Namibia, or contracts used by architects in Namibia. The absence of professional <b>indemnity</b> <b>insurance</b> in contracts used by the Namibian built environment must be addressed, {{in order to create}} awareness of the risks involved in practising without professional <b>indemnity</b> <b>insurance.</b> This study will contribute to the knowledge of architectural practise in Namibia by emphasising the evident gaps in the existing contract data, namely the Architect's and Quantity Surveyor's Act (Act 13 of 1979) and the Client Architect Agreement of the Namibia Council for Architects and Quantity Surveyors. It is envisioned that passing a bill in parliament, making professional <b>indemnity</b> <b>insurance</b> compulsory for all registered professionals, will benefit the Namibian architectural environment. An applied research model is selected by implementing triangulation. The approach starts broadly in the architectural environment of Namibia, addressing issues of contracting and governing legislations, before focusing specifically on professional <b>indemnity</b> <b>insurance</b> and the need for it in the Namibian built environment...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Dental {{profession}} saw unprecedented {{change during}} the last century. Worldwide, patients have {{become more aware of}} their right-legal literacy including India. Aim: The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the awareness of the Consumer Protection Act, practice of informed consent (IC), and the utilization of dental <b>indemnity</b> <b>insurance</b> among dental practitioners in Bengaluru city. Materials and Methods: This cross-sectional study was carried out among 310 dental practitioners in Bengaluru city. A prevalidated self-administered 30 -item questionnaire was to assess the awareness about the Consumer Protection Act (CPA), knowledge and practice of IC, and utilization of professional <b>indemnity</b> <b>insurance</b> among practicing dentists. Results: There was an equal distribution between both the genders in the study. A total of 67 % of the study participants were aware about CPA and only 50 % of the participants responded that they had a practice of taking IC for every patient. Only 35 % of participants had dental <b>indemnity</b> <b>insurance.</b> Age and qualification positively correlated with awareness of the CPA (P = 0. 007); utilization of professional <b>indemnity</b> <b>insurance</b> is also associated with years of practice (P = 0. 002). Conclusion: Majority had awareness regarding CPA but practice of taking consent and utilization of professional <b>indemnity</b> <b>insurance</b> among dental practitioners were less than adequate...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the consequences of}} parallel trade on health care systems in a two-country model with a vertical distributor relationship. In particular, two cost-sharing systems - coinsurance and <b>indemnity</b> <b>insurance</b> - are compared with respect to changes in copayments and public health expenditure. Under both cost-sharing systems, parallel trade generates a price-decreasing competition effect in the destination country and a price-increasing double marginalization effect in the source country. In the destination country, copayments for patients decrease to a larger extent under <b>indemnity</b> <b>insurance,</b> whereas reductions of public health expenditure occur only under coinsurance. In the source country, copayments increase less under coinsurance, whereas health expenditure is reduced more under <b>indemnity</b> <b>insurance.</b> This illustrates that a harmonization of health care systems would not make sense...|$|R
