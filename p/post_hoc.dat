5|$|There {{have been}} critiques {{of the theory}} from several perspectives. Arguments include that it {{emphasizes}} justice {{to the exclusion of}} other moral values, such as caring; that there is such an overlap between stages that they should more properly be regarded as separate domains; or that evaluations of the reasons for moral choices are mostly <b>post</b> <b>hoc</b> rationalizations (by both decision makers and psychologists studying them) of essentially intuitive decisions.|$|E
5|$|Other {{psychologists have}} {{questioned}} the assumption that moral action is primarily a result of formal reasoning. Social intuitionists such as Jonathan Haidt, for example, argue that individuals often make moral judgments without weighing concerns such as fairness, law, human rights, or abstract ethical values. Thus the arguments analyzed by Kohlberg and other rationalist psychologists could be considered <b>post</b> <b>hoc</b> rationalizations of intuitive decisions; moral reasoning may be less relevant to moral action than Kohlberg's theory suggests.|$|E
5|$|This passage {{has often}} been {{interpreted}} as {{a reference to the}} benign policy instituted by Cyrus of allowing exiled peoples, such as the Jews, to return to their original homelands. The Cylinder's inscription has been linked with the reproduction in the Book of Ezra of two texts that are claimed to be edicts issued by Cyrus concerning the repatriation of the Jews and the reconstruction of the Temple in Jerusalem. The two edicts (one in Hebrew and one in Aramaic) are substantially different in content and tone, leading some historians to argue that one or both may be a <b>post</b> <b>hoc</b> fabrication. The question of their authenticity remains unresolved, though it is widely believed that they do reflect some sort of Persian royal policy, albeit perhaps not one that was couched in the terms given in the text of the biblical edicts.|$|E

25|$|In {{the theory}} of Galois cohomology of {{algebraic}} groups, some further points of view are introduced. They have explanatory value, in particular in relation with {{the theory of}} quadratic forms; but were {{for the most part}} <b>post</b> <b>hoc,</b> as far as the discovery of the phenomena is concerned. The first point is that quadratic forms over a field can be identified as a Galois , or twisted forms (torsors) of an orthogonal group. As an algebraic group, an orthogonal group is in general neither connected nor simply-connected; the latter point brings in the spin phenomena, while the former is related to the discriminant.|$|E
25|$|There are however {{problems}} with the shell model when an attempt is made to account for nuclear properties well away from closed shells. This has led to complex <b>post</b> <b>hoc</b> distortions of {{the shape of the}} potential well to fit experimental data, but the question remains whether these mathematical manipulations actually correspond to the spatial deformations in real nuclei. Problems with the shell model have led some to propose realistic two-body and three-body nuclear force effects involving nucleon clusters and then build the nucleus on this basis. Two such cluster models are the Close-Packed Spheron Model of Linus Pauling and the 2D Ising Model of MacGregor.|$|E
25|$|The {{mandatory}} {{nature of}} Harmelin's sentence {{also did not}} require setting it aside. First, as Scalia agreed, the Eighth Amendment did not require the trial court to allow Harmelin to present mitigating evidence. Second, if the Court were to set Harmelin's sentence aside, it would necessarily have to reject {{the judgment of the}} legislature, where the initial responsibility for making the substantive judgment about appropriate punishments rests. Third, Michigan's system did not entirely lack mechanisms for considering the individual circumstances of a particular defendant. Prosecutors have discretion in bringing charges, the governor has the power to grant clemency <b>post</b> <b>hoc,</b> and the legislature has the power to retroactively modify the sentence for all persons convicted of Harmelin's crime.|$|E
25|$|Before the {{publication}} of Dogs That Know When Their Owners Are Coming Home, Sheldrake invited Richard Wiseman, Matthew Smith, and Julie Milton to conduct an independent experimental study with the dog Jaytee. They concluded that their evidence did not support telepathy as {{an explanation for the}} dog's behaviour, and proposed possible alternative explanations for Sheldrake's conclusions, involving artefacts, bias resulting from experimental design, and <b>post</b> <b>hoc</b> analysis of unpublished data. The group observed that Sheldrake's observed patterns could easily arise if a dog were simply to do very little for a while, before visiting a window with increasing frequency the longer that its owner was absent, and that such behaviour would make sense for a dog awaiting its owner's return. Under this behaviour, the final measurement period, ending with the owner's return, would always contain the most time spent at the window. Sheldrake argued that the actual data in his own and in Wiseman's tests did not bear this out, and that the dog went to wait at the window sooner when his owner was returning from a short absence, and later after a long absence, with no tendency for Jaytee to go to the window early in the way that he did for shorter absences.|$|E

2500|$|In {{order to}} justify its remilitarization—which was also a {{violation}} of the 1925 Locarno Pact—a <b>post</b> <b>hoc</b> plebiscite (or referendum) was quickly called by Hitler for March 29 to [...] "ask the German people" [...] to both ratify the Rhineland’s occupation by the German Army, and to approve a single party list composed exclusively of Nazi candidates to sit in the new Reichstag.

2500|$|In Romer v. Evans, 517 U.S. 620, 633 (1996), the Court {{said that}} the {{government}} purpose must be [...] "independent and legitimate." [...] And in United States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 533 (1996), the Court said the government purpose [...] "must be genuine, not hypothesized or invented <b>post</b> <b>hoc</b> in response to litigation." [...] Thus, the Court made it clear that, in the scrutiny regime established in West Coast Hotel v.

2500|$|Stratification is {{sometimes}} introduced after the sampling phase {{in a process}} called [...] "poststratification". This approach is typically implemented {{due to a lack}} of prior knowledge of an appropriate stratifying variable or when the experimenter lacks the necessary information to create a stratifying variable during the sampling phase. Although the method is susceptible to the pitfalls of <b>post</b> <b>hoc</b> approaches, it can provide several benefits in the right situation. Implementation usually follows a simple random sample. In addition to allowing for stratification on an ancillary variable, poststratification can be used to implement weighting, which can improve the precision of a sample's estimates.|$|E

2500|$|Effective plasma levels vary {{depending}} on the medical indication. [...] For congestive heart failure, levels between 0.5 and 1.0ng/ml are recommended. [...] This recommendation is based on <b>post</b> <b>hoc</b> analysis of prospective trials, suggesting higher levels may be associated with increased mortality rates. [...] For heart rate control (atrial fibrillation), plasma levels are less defined and are generally titrated to a goal heart rate. Typically, digoxin levels are considered therapeutic for heart rate control between 0.5 and 2.0ng/ml (or 0.6 and 2.6 nmol/l). In suspected toxicity or ineffectiveness, digoxin levels should be monitored. Plasma potassium levels also need to be closely controlled (see side effects, below).|$|E
2500|$|Elevated {{levels of}} the {{lipoprotein}} fractions, LDL, IDL and VLDL are regarded as atherogenic (prone to cause atherosclerosis). Levels of these fractions, rather than the total cholesterol level, correlate with the extent and progress of atherosclerosis. Conversely, the total cholesterol can be within normal limits, yet be made up primarily of small LDL and small HDL particles, under which conditions atheroma growth rates would still be high. Recently, a <b>post</b> <b>hoc</b> analysis of the IDEAL and the EPIC prospective studies found an association between high levels of HDL cholesterol (adjusted for apolipoprotein A-I and apolipoprotein B) and increased risk of cardiovascular disease, casting doubt on the cardioprotective role of [...] "good cholesterol".|$|E
2500|$|According to Thomas, the Court's inquiry {{should have}} {{ended with the}} {{conclusion}} that the State's chosen method of notice by certified mail was reasonably calculated to inform Jones of proceedings affecting his property interest. He argued that this finding was [...] "reinforced by the well-established presumption that individuals, especially those owning property, act in their own interest." [...] The State was accordingly free to assume that the address it had on record was correct and up-to-date, or that he had left a caretaker at the house who would inform him of the notice. [...] Whether a method is reasonably calculated to give notice is furthermore determined at the time the notice is sent, a principle Thomas believed followed from Court precedent. He argued that the Court had abandoned this by basing its decision on information that was unavailable when notice was sent, and that all of its suggested reasonable methods were [...] "entirely the product of <b>post</b> <b>hoc</b> considerations." ...|$|E
2500|$|The term [...] "cargo cult" [...] {{has been}} used metaphorically to {{describe}} an attempt to recreate successful outcomes by replicating circumstances associated with those outcomes, although those circumstances are either unrelated to the causes of outcomes or insufficient to produce them by themselves. [...] In the former case, this is an instance of the <b>post</b> <b>hoc</b> ergo propter hoc fallacy. The metaphorical use of [...] "cargo cult" [...] was popularized by physicist Richard Feynman at a 1974 Caltech commencement speech, which later became a chapter in his book Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!, where he coined the phrase [...] "cargo cult science" [...] to describe activity that {{had some of the}} trappings of real science (such as publication in scientific journals) but lacked a basis in honest experimentation. Later the term cargo cult programming developed to describe computer software containing elements that are included because of successful utilization elsewhere, unnecessary for the task at hand.|$|E
2500|$|Marxism was {{the guiding}} {{philosophy}} throughout Stalin's adult life; according to Montefiore, it held a [...] "quasi-religious" [...] value for Stalin. During his early life, Marxism blended with Georgian nationalism as a core component of his outlook. In 1917, {{he wrote that}} [...] "there is dogmatic Marxism and there is creative Marxism. I stand on the ground of the latter". Volkogonov however believed that Stalin's Marxism was shaped by his [...] "dogmatic turn of mind", suggesting that this had been instilled in the Soviet leader during his education in religious institutions. According to scholar Robert Service, Stalin's [...] "few innovations in ideology were crude, dubious developments of Marxism". Some of these derived from political expediency rather than any sincere intellectual commitment; Stalin would often turn to ideology <b>post</b> <b>hoc</b> to justify his decisions. Stalin referred to himself as a praktik, meaning {{that he was more}} of a practical revolutionary than a theoretician.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are other}} {{elements}} {{to the book}} which are intriguing and mysterious. They require careful analysis, to piece together a likely sequence of {{events that led to}} production of the final version. Luckily Matthew is quite informative and open about the events occurring simultaneous to his writing, and that he found them to be of such considerable importance that not only did they distract his attention so he completely forgot about his book sitting with the printers, but they also had consequence for the relevancy of some of his ideas already committed to the page. In response to certain events, Matthew clearly added sections, marked by his introductory statements, such as, [...] "Since writing the above …", [...] "Since this volume went to press …", [...] "After the preceding parts of this volume had gone to press …", etc. This <b>post</b> <b>hoc</b> approach has created a distinctive halting flow and discontinuity between sections. The book is therefore structured in an unorthodox way, {{as a result of the}} iterative process in assembling the content, and the reviews reflect this confusion.|$|E
2500|$|Anthony Cekada, an {{assistant}} pastor of sedevacantist bishop Daniel Dolan, {{in his book}} Work of Human Hands, says that the Mass of Paul VI is invalid and moreover [...] strips down or removes completely every prayer in the Latin Rite which covers subjects such [...] as judgment, heaven and hell, Satan, et al., and suggests that their full-scale removal, if such were to happen, would contribute {{to a lack of}} self-discipline and eventual loss of faith and skepticism among Catholics, responding to the <b>post</b> <b>hoc</b> ergo propter hoc accusation above. He criticizes the Mass of Paul VI for what he calls its [...] "Protestantizations", such as referring to the service as a [...] "supper" [...] with a [...] "table" [...] and [...] "cup" [...] instead of a [...] "sacrifice" [...] with an [...] "altar" [...] and [...] "chalice", making the congregation, in his view, the center of worship instead of God, and so forth. He claims that the Mass of Paul VI uses a Modernist method of mixing traditional language with Protestant language to appeal to both sides, and thus falling into heresy, {{in the same way as}} the Church of England is said to be [...] "both Catholic and Reformed". The observation about the use of the word [...] "cup", rather than [...] "chalice", concerned only the English translation in use from 1973 to 2011, which employed both terms. [...] It does not concern the original Latin text of the Mass of Paul VI, translations into other languages, or the present English translation, which always uses the word [...] "chalice".|$|E

60|$|The most vulgar {{form of this}} fallacy is {{that which}} is {{commonly}} called <b>post</b> <b>hoc,</b> ergo propter hoc, or, cum hoc, ergo propter hoc. As when it was inferred that England owed her industrial pre-eminence to her restrictions on commerce; as when the old school of financiers, and some speculative writers, maintained that the national debt {{was one of the}} causes of national prosperity; as when the excellence of the Church, of the Houses of Lords and Commons, of the procedure of the law courts, etc., were inferred from the mere fact that the country had prospered under them. In such cases as these, if it can be rendered probable by other evidence that the supposed causes have some tendency to produce the effect ascribed to them, the fact of its having been produced, though only in one instance, is of some value as a verification by specific experience; but in itself it goes scarcely any way at all toward establishing such a tendency, since, admitting the effect, a hundred other antecedents could show an equally strong title of that kind to be considered as the cause.|$|E
50|$|In practice, <b>post</b> <b>hoc</b> {{analyses}} are usually concerned with finding patterns and/or relationships between subgroups of sampled populations {{that would otherwise}} remain undetected and undiscovered were a scientific community to rely strictly upon a priori statistical methods. <b>Post</b> <b>hoc</b> tests—also known as a posteriori tests—greatly expand the range and capability of methods {{that can be applied}} in exploratory research. <b>Post</b> <b>hoc</b> examination strengthens induction by limiting the probability that significant effects will seem to have been discovered between subgroups of a population when none actually exist.
