500|$|When it {{was seen}} that NVA forces were pouring through the gap unimpeded, the no-fire zone was reduced at 10:00p.m. that night, but not before the action {{generated}} considerable debate. One ranking adviser commented, [...] "When viewed in relation to all {{the events of the}} day, a worse decision could not have been made." [...] The 3rd ARVN had lost most of its artillery in the first two days of the offensive, and in fact had surrendered two of their batteries intact to the NVA.

Destructoid criticized the fourth game for its excessively-loud jumpscares and the breathing mechanic being too difficult and confusing for players. Despite this, it was praised by one reviewer at GameZebo for its intense environment and creepy sounds and graphics, {{as well as}} its jumpscares. It was also given a mixed review by PC Gamer, who called it [...] "another rivet in the series' steel-clad design which immortalized its Let's Play legacy in a few short months" [...] and [...] "certainly the scariest of the four [...] ", but also criticized the gameplay, saying that [...] "the humdrum repetition of the same sequence over and over... is too much of a chore to fully <b>pull</b> <b>me</b> in", as well as criticizing the game's lack of the series's signature camera system.|$|E

As she continues to chant about making love in apocalyptic circumstances, [...] "So when the world's at war / Let our love heal us all", she projects a universal [...] "all you need is love" [...] feeling, as noted by Jillian Mapes. In the second verse, Beyoncé sings, [...] "Hey! I don't know much about guns but I ... I've been shot by you", as she pushes the final word [...] "you" [...] up at a full octave. She then continues: [...] "Hey! And I don't know when I'm gonna die, but I hope that I'm gonna die by you / Hey! And I don't know much about fighting, but I, I know I will fight for you / Hey! Just when I ball up my fist, I realize that I'm laying right next to you". According to Thomas Conner of the Chicago Sun-Times, these lines are intended to show that love conquers all. The song ends with an intense electric guitar solo.|$|E

2500|$|In the 108th Congress, a {{preliminary}} Medicare vote passed 216–215, {{a vote on}} Head Start passed 217–216, a vote on school vouchers for Washington, D.C., passed 209-208, and [...] "Fast track", usually called [...] "trade promotion authority", passed by one vote as well.

One lobbyist said, [...] "I've had members <b>pull</b> <b>me</b> aside and ask me to talk to another member of Congress about a bill or amendment, but I've never been asked to work on a bill—at least like they are asking us to whip bills now."

2500|$|Craig Marks of Billboard {{said that}} along with [...] "California Gurls", the songs [...] "are {{textbook}} summer singles whose ingenious pop hooks and zillion-dollar drum tracks are stamped with Perry's knack for a memorable line and frothy, gum-snapping persona." [...] As of January 2015, Billboard also named [...] "Teenage Dream" [...] as the second best song of 2010s (so far). James Montgomery of MTV commented that [...] "Teenage Dream" [...] showed a [...] "definite change of pace for Perry. While it's still as saccharine sweet as her previous hits, there's also a rather, well, mature quality to it (despite the title)." [...] Amos Barshad of New York said, [...] "Right now, it's feeling a bit too earnest, and not nearly as catchy as the follow-up single from Perry's first album ('Hot n Cold,' most definitely still a jam). That said, we are now mentally preparing ourselves for its ubiquity." [...] Alyssa Rosenberg of The Atlantic dismissed the lyrics as [...] "simply annoying and incoherent" [...] and added that [...] "the hook and chorus aren't nearly compelling enough to <b>pull</b> <b>me</b> back into it." ...|$|E
