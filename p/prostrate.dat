5|$|For {{many years}} it was {{believed}} that Alkan met his death when a bookcase toppled over and fell on him as he reached for a volume of the Talmud from a high shelf. This tale, which was circulated by the pianist Isidor Philipp, is dismissed by Hugh Macdonald, who reports the discovery of a contemporary letter by one of his pupils explaining that Alkan had been found <b>prostrate</b> in his kitchen, under a porte-parapluie (a heavy coat/umbrella rack), after his concierge heard his moaning. He had possibly fainted, bringing it down on himself while grabbing out for support. He was reportedly carried to his bedroom and died later that evening. The story of the bookcase may have its roots in a legend told of Aryeh Leib ben Asher, rabbi of Metz, the town from which Alkan's family originated.|$|E

5|$|In Goa, Mohini is worshipped as Mahalasa or Mahalasa Narayani. She is the Kuladevi (family goddess) of many Hindus {{from western}} and {{southern}} India, including Goud Saraswat Brahmins, Karhade Brahmins, Daivajnas and Bhandaris. The chief temple of Mahalasa Narayani is at Mardol, Goa, though her temples also {{exist in the}} states of Karnataka, Kerala, Maharashtra, and Gujarat. Mahalasa has four hands, carrying a Trishula, a sword, a severed head, and a drinking bowl. She stands on a <b>prostrate</b> man or demon, as a tiger or lion licks blood dripping from the severed head. Goud Saraswat Brahmins as well as Vaishnavas from Goa and South Canara identify her with Mohini and call her Narayani and Rahu-matthani, the slayer of Rahu, as told in the Bhavishya Purana.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} form {{available}} in commercial nurseries is unimproved Banksia integrifolia subsp. integrifolia. It prefers a sunny aspect without exposure to frosts, and tolerates fairly heavy pruning. Seeds do not require any treatment, and take 5 to 6 weeks to germinate. Flowering begins at around four to six years from seed. The other subspecies are less well known in cultivation, but are obtainable. Cultivation is presumably similar to B.integrifolia subsp. integrifolia, except that B.integrifolia subsp. monticola may be assumed frost-tolerant. Dwarf forms of B.integrifolia are sometimes sold, and a registered <b>prostrate</b> cultivar, Banksia 'Roller Coaster', is available. The latter is a vigorous ground-hugging plant that can spread to 4 or 5 metres across yet remains only 50 centimetres high.|$|E
5|$|The temple priests {{perform the}} pooja (rituals) during festivals {{and on a}} daily basis. As at other Vishnu temples of Tamil Nadu, the priests belong to the Vaishnavaite community, a Brahmin sub-caste. The temple rituals are {{performed}} six times a day: Ushathkalam at 7 a.m., Kalasanthi at 8:00a.m., Uchikalam at 12:00p.m., Sayarakshai at 6:00p.m., Irandamkalam at 7:00p.m. and Ardha Jamam at 10:00p.m. Each ritual has three steps: alangaram (decoration), neivethanam (food offering) and deepa aradanai (waving of lamps) for both Pundarikakshan and Pankajavalli. During the last step of worship, nagaswaram (pipe instrument) and tavil (percussion instrument) are played, religious instructions in the Vedas (sacred text) are recited by priests, and worshippers <b>prostrate</b> themselves {{in front of the}} temple mast. There are weekly, monthly and fortnightly rituals performed in the temple.|$|E

5|$|Although no Chinese sources {{detail the}} event, Portuguese sources tell {{of how the}} Portuguese were summoned on the first and fifteenth days of each lunar month to ceremoniously <b>prostrate</b> {{themselves}} before a wall of the Forbidden City to seek another audience with the emperor. From Beijing, the Portuguese embassy heard reports that the emperor reached Tongzhou in January 1521 and had the rebel Prince of Ning executed there. The Portuguese embassy had also become aware that ambassadors from the exiled King of Malacca were sent to Beijing seeking assistance from the Chinese emperor in expelling the conquering Portuguese so that their king could be reinstalled there. The Portuguese also knew of two officials in the Censorate—Qiu Daolong and He Ao— who sent memorials to the throne that condemned the Portuguese conquest of Malacca and that their embassy should be rejected. There were also reports sent to Beijing by Canton officials stating that the Portuguese were bothersome foreigners who sought {{to build their own}} trading post.|$|E
5|$|Stowe {{was among}} several authors {{who wrote about}} Florida {{following}} the Civil War. By far, the majority were men who concentrated on hunting prospects, but the women who wrote about the region often used an adolescent narrator who was usually male as a device to describe their encounters with the novelty of what they saw. Stowe wrote simply as herself, something {{that may have been}} allowed because of her celebrity. Gene Burnett, author of Florida's Past: People and Events That Shaped the State writes: Harriet was probably never fully aware of how great had been her influence in advertising Florida to the country, turning it from an obscure down under tip on the map into a beckoning, lush, tropical paradise, to which tens of thousands would flock to help build a state over the following decades. She herself would doubtless have viewed it as a fitting Christian act to help restore a <b>prostrate,</b> defeated brotherland to its feet; Florida's first promoter was merely a Good Samaritan.|$|E
5|$|The {{cities where}} {{emperors}} lived frequently in this period—Milan, Trier, Arles, Sirmium, Serdica, Thessaloniki, Nicomedia and Antioch—were treated as alternate imperial seats, {{to the exclusion}} of Rome and its senatorial elite. A new style of ceremony was developed, emphasizing the distinction of the emperor from all other persons. The quasi-republican ideals of Augustus' primus inter pares were abandoned for all but the tetrarchs themselves. Diocletian took to wearing a gold crown and jewels, and forbade the use of purple cloth to all but the emperors. His subjects were required to <b>prostrate</b> themselves in his presence (adoratio); the most fortunate were allowed the privilege of kissing the hem of his robe (proskynesis, προσκύνησις). Circuses and basilicas were designed to keep the face of the emperor perpetually in view, and always in a seat of authority. The emperor became a figure of transcendent authority, a man beyond the grip of the masses. His every appearance was stage-managed. This style of presentation was not new—many of its elements were first seen in the reigns of Aurelian and Severus—but it was only under the tetrarchs that it was refined into an explicit system.|$|E

40|$|Autoregressive (AR) {{modeling}} involves {{selection of}} an appropriate model {{order and the}} estimation of model parameters from the available data. Spectral estimation is then carried out using the model parameter. This spectral analysis is chosen as an alternative method to FFT in analysis of brain wave. Muslims prayer, termed as "Salat" in the Arabic language is a worshipping act which encompasses both physical movement of the body as well as silent Quranic recitation through mind and soul. The various positions in Salat include standing, <b>prostrating,</b> bowing and sitting. <b>Prostrating</b> {{is one of the}} unique position in salat which is believed can promote a relaxation effect to human body. In this study, AR was used to analyze the EEG signals during salat on <b>prostrating</b> position. The result shows that <b>prostrating</b> during salat generated higher alpha relative power (RPÎ±) as compare with mimic prostration. This finding concludes that prostration, one unique position in salat may promote a remarkable relaxation state to human mind and body...|$|R
