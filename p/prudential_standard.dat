40|$|In {{this paper}} we address three questions: (1) Does global finance require a common <b>prudential</b> <b>standard?</b> (2) Does global finance require {{international}} cooperation in overseeing the system’s safety and soundness? And (3), does global finance require notification, cooperation and coordination of dynamic regulatory-policy adjustments? Our answer {{to the first question}} is that global finance does require a common <b>prudential</b> <b>standard,</b> defined as a level of required resilience, applied appropriately to all parts of the financial system. Without adoption of a common resilience standard, the international financial system will fragment and balkanize. In addressing the second question, we explain why shared, collective analysis is necessary to identify and mitigate stability-threatening shortfalls against that standard for resilience. This will be possible only with increased public and private transparency. Finally, we examine the daunting, but essential, task of implementing a dynamic prudential framework that maintains the system’s resilience even as its structure and risk-taking behaviors change. The policy implications of our analysis focus on the need for global agreement, implementation monitoring, information sharing and even, sometimes given damaging spillovers, collective regulatory responses to emerging threats...|$|E
40|$|As a G 20 member, China {{has been}} engaged in {{financial}} reform {{since the end of}} the global financial crisis. A core piece of this reform is Basel III, the new <b>prudential</b> <b>standard</b> issued by the Basel Committee. Rather than being merely compliant, China’s banking regulation is stricter than the global standard and being implemented ahead of the international timetable. Why is China voluntarily subjecting itself to tougher regulatory standards than the rest of the world? This article shows that low adjustment costs, factional politics, and, above all, an unusual alignment of domestic interests in the quest for international reputation are driving this phenomenon. The troubled institutional history of China’s financial system motivates all relevant stakeholders to seek external validation in order to address a credibility gap abroad, albeit for different reasons.

40|$|This {{submission}} {{relates to}} a single issue, but one which may potentially impact upon the survival of an individual financial institution, and importantly {{the stability of the}} financial system; that is, organisational disaster recovery planning. Please find attached, as part of this submission, my paper which puts forward the proposition that disruption to critical business operations of a financial institution from a natural, technical or physical disaster represents a negative externality that may seriously impact the overall stability of the banking system and financial system generally. It is argued that the level of organisational disaster recovery planning varies significantly between banks and as such is an uncompensated risk within the financial system. This conclusion is drawn from a detailed examination of bank disaster recovery practices conducted in 1994 by the writer. A survey of selected international bank supervisors of their practices for the regulation of organisational disaster recovery planning indicates a divergence of practices. Of note is the regulatory requirement within the United States of America for financial institutions to develop, test and maintain comprehensive disaster recovery plans. These must be signed-off annually by the board of directors, and are subject to audit by regulatory examiners.

Bond markets always played a smaller role and some people believe that the absence of large and robust local bond markets may have helped to cause the Asian crisis.

40|$|Economic policy {{reform that}} creates {{opportunities}} for new productive activities often shifts wealth from {{one set of}} agents toward another, creating reason for political pressure against the reform. The author explores how government financial guarantees secure the political support of the reform's"losers. "Governnment guarantees have two effects: 1) they will probably lead to a bailout of some firms'obligations to debtholders. This bailout must be financed by taxes on the cash flows from old and new projects, and tax collection involves a resource cost; 2) {{the existence of the}} guarantees distorts entrepreneurs'investment incentives by creating an incentive to invest in overly risky projects and not to invest in safe new projects. The author demonstrates that government guarantees on existing debt, combined with the use of junior secured debt to finance new projects, would mitigate the problem of underinvestment in safe projects and overinvestment in risky projects. The potentially positive role of government financial guarantees after economic reform does not imply that <b>prudential</b> banking <b>standards</b> fail to apply during a period of economic reform. If anything, <b>prudential</b> <b>standards</b> are more important during such a period.

40|$|Thesis (MBA) -University of Natal, Durban, 2004. The {{retirement}} fund industry {{has seen a}} number of scandals both locally and internationally recently. These have left the trustees, the custodians of the large sums of monies in {{retirement fund}}s, exposed to lawsuits. This is so because the fund members and retirees blame these trustees for negligence and lack of foresight in putting in place <b>prudential</b> <b>standards</b> by which their monies should be managed. These <b>prudential</b> <b>standards</b> are encompassed in corporate governance, as we will appreciate. Retirement fund governance is a subset of corporate governance; it is the {{mirror image of the}} corporate governance of a company, which consists of a set of relationships between company's management, board, shareholders and other stakeholders. The same principles that apply to business assets in general also apply to the management of pension assets. This study set out to ascertain whether or not retirement funds in South Africa do comply with the governance guidelines as set by the Financial Services Board (FSB). I selected a sample of 300 fund trustees but excluded the principal officers and tried to select an equal number from employee elected and employer appointed, a balance that proved to be extremely difficult to strike. The sample was randomly drawn using my colleagues for referrals as well as just calling a company asking for a principal officer who would refer me to the trustees. (I received a great deal of cooperation from the principal officers to this end). The participants represent a wide spectrum of industry sectors. They represent manufacturing, auto and motor industry, local government and a few from the financial services industry.

In December 2009, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (the Basel Committee) identified ineffective liquidity management as a key characteristic of the crisis and highlighted the lack of attention that liquidity risk received relative to other risks prior to the crisis.

40|$|International investors' enthusiasm {{with respect}} to growth {{prospects}} in Southeast Asia has been followed by panic. Both the outstanding economic performance of Southeast Asian economies {{and their ability to}} master adjustment challenges had led most observers of these economies to the conclusion that "Asia is different". In comparison with previous currency crises, the macroeconomic fundamentals (GDP growth, inflation, fiscal deficit, external indebtedness, domestic savings, export performance) in the Southeast Asian economies seemed to be consistent with the fixed or quasi-fixed exchange rate regimes. Even large current account deficits were not classified as "high risk" although the vulnerability of Southeast Asian countries had increased during the last decade due to a surge in capital inflows, a construction boom, the appreciation of the US dollar, and the liberalization of domestic financial markets without strict enforcement of <b>prudential</b> <b>standards.</b> Early signals of vulnerability should have warned domestic policymakers to take precautionary measures such as more exchange rate flexibility to end sterilization policies, higher marginal reserve requirements, and <b>prudential</b> <b>standards</b> for bank lending to reduce the risk exposure of banks. Some of these measures were taken in 1996, but apparently it was too little or too late. In the aftermath of the crisis, the enforcement of prudential rules in the financial sector and the clearing of bad debt figure high on the policy agenda. In order to help financial restructuring, fiscal and monetary policies should not be overly restrictive. The role of external assistance is ambiguous because of negative incentive effects. The currency crises in Asia boosted the amounts of emergency lending by the IMF and other countries, which may raise expectations that defaults will become cheaper in the future. Moreover, officially implemented early warning systems may easily produce the bad news which triggers exchange rate crises. All in all, Asia is not different from other regions. High current account deficits and real appreciation expose countries with fixed or quasi-fixed exchange rates and fragile domestic financial markets to the risk of a reversal of capital inflows. This mounting risk position can lead to a crisis when bad news arrives and domestic measures are delayed. Therefore, Asia could have learned from previous currency crises in Latin America and Europe: first, extreme solutions for the exchange rate regime (currency boards or a passive crawling peg with wide intervention bands) work best; second, deregulated goods and factor markets with strict prudential supervision (especially in the phase of financial liberalization) are necessary preconditions for a stable fixed exchange rate regime; third, development models with discretionary government interventions face difficult times since the globalization of goods and factor markets renders economic plans of today obsolete tomorrow.
