50|$|California, Florida {{and several}} other states in the US, {{concerned}} with public safety and the danger posed by counterfeit and diverted medicines, issued pedigree laws requiring participants in the value chain to demonstrate and document the ownership and custody history of medicines. Forced to handle complex serialisation and data gathering and formatting requirements, pharmaceutical manufacturers kicked their efforts into high gear spurring innovation in the industry. SAP responded with additional investment {{in the area that}} rendered a full solution for serialisation and track and trace which was rapidly adopted by leaders like Novartis, Cephalon, Roche, and many others. In addition, in 2007 SAP unveiled its Auto-ID Enterprise offering which allows companies to manage serialised data and events at the enterprise level and also at manufacturing, distribution, or retail nodes. The solution is compliant with the EPCGlobal’s EPCIS standard and provides a platform for enabling cross company collaborative applications like ePedigree, recall and deduction management, and <b>product</b> <b>tracking</b> and authentication.The US Department of Defense (DoD) has also seen the advantages that new technologies could bring to its own supply chain and maintenance operations. In 2005 the DoD issued serialisation and Auto-ID requirements -iUID program- covering many of its 43,000 suppliers. SAP quickly grasped the requirements and created a solution for its customers, such as Pratt and Whitney.Several other companies reaped the rewards offered by Real-World Aware technologies in other areas: chemical manufacturer BASF had deployed SAP Event Management to monitor ocean shipments - especially through unplanned events - and gain visibility and responsiveness in its transportation processes. When Hurricane Katrina hit New Orleans in 2005, BASF was able to quickly redirect in-transit shipments to safe ports and suffered minor disruption in its operations. British Petroleum worked with SAP Research to use a self-aware wireless mesh sensor network to prevent in real-time storage of dangerous combinations of chemical substances in the same facility. BP and SAP also worked in using RFID to enforce environmental, health and safety directives, for example automating real-time verification that a worker has taken the appropriate training and is wearing the mandatory equipment while working in a dangerous zone. On another project, SAP installed a “proof-of-presence” solution for Frankfurt Airport to ensure that the worker in charge of maintaining hard-to-reach assets was in fact physically present doing the work. Airbus and SAP worked together creating a solution that used RFID to more effectively manage the tools loaned to airlines for the maintenance of their planes.|$|E
40|$|In today’s knowledge-intensive and {{collaborative}} manufacturing industry, {{an effective and}} efficient <b>product</b> <b>tracking</b> and traceability ability which enables companies to capture, display, and retrieval the product information is crucial. A <b>product</b> <b>tracking</b> and traceability system which provides precise manufacturing information sharing among the players in a supply chain creates a competitive advantage for companies in manufacturing industry. The main functions of an online <b>product</b> <b>tracking</b> and traceability system are monitoring the status and location of any item by means of registered identification and delivering flow of information internally and externally (to clients); generating historical data that allows traceability of information, providing information concerning manufacturing activities on a shop floor for administrative practices such as product costing, work scheduling, purchasing, etc. As an online system, it accepts input directly from the area where it is created and returns the output directly to the area where it is required. An effective online <b>product</b> <b>tracking</b> and traceability system enables companies to improve productivity and to achieve desired level of quality. This study aims to examine the opportunities associated with <b>product</b> <b>tracking</b> and traceability systems and to develop an optimal online <b>product</b> <b>tracking</b> and traceability system solution method for implementation in EPM Technology Group, Formula 1 Car Component Manufacturer Company, through combination of business, manufacturing and information system disciplines with a comprehensive literature review. Throughout this study, the benefits of an online <b>product</b> <b>tracking</b> and traceability system for a manufacturing SME will be identified, the suitable system solutions that fit to the online <b>product</b> <b>tracking</b> and traceability system definition will be evaluated and the fundamental components of an online <b>product</b> <b>tracking</b> and traceability system will be determined. In order to achieve an optimal online <b>product</b> <b>tracking</b> and traceability system solution that allows EPM Technology Group to gain accurate and rapid product identification and to improve manufacturing process monitoring capabilities on their shop floor, the administrative and manufacturing activities in EPM Technology Group will be identified and analysed. Consequently, a solution method for developing a feasible and cost-effective system to satisfy core requirements of <b>product</b> <b>tracking</b> and traceability applications, requirements of AS/ 9100 quality management standard and expectations of EPM Technology Group will be proposed. This study is organised mainly into two major parts. First part will cover academic and industry literature review, which provides background information relevant to the <b>product</b> <b>tracking</b> and traceability studies, and descriptions of key terms and concepts of fundamentals of <b>product</b> <b>tracking</b> and traceability systems. Besides, methodology deployed in this study will be explained in the first part. Second part will {{be more interested in}} practical work including decision-making analyses about the components of online <b>product</b> <b>tracking</b> and traceability system solution. While developing most feasible solution in line with the operational and managerial context of a specific business, structured procedures and methods will be utilised for accurate decision-making about the main components of online <b>product</b> <b>tracking</b> and traceability systems which are product identification techniques/technology, software application modules and software provider. The selection criteria will be defined for making decision about each component. Plus, a simple conceptual design solution targeting to satisfy requirements and needs of EPM Technology Group will be presented by the end of second part. Finally, recommendation for future stages of EPM’s project will be given in last chapter of this study. As outcome of this dissertation project, ideal solution alternatives and recommendations for choosing optimal product identification technology and business information system applications for <b>product</b> <b>tracking</b> and traceability practices will be provided to EPM. All of the selection criteria for making decision about the online <b>product</b> <b>tracking</b> and traceability system components and selection procedure for choosing system software provider (vendor) {{can be used as a}} guideline for similar software and system sourcing practices in EPM Technology Group. Although the main topic of this study is concentrated on manufacturing processes, the managerial content of this study which examines various administrative practices will provide a gateway to EPM Technology Group to manage their future operations more effective and more efficient. More specifically, the EPM Technology Group management can use this study as a reference while establishing online <b>product</b> <b>tracking</b> and traceability system and co-operating with software providers...|$|E
