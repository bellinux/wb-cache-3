5|$|In 1893 {{at the age}} of 19, Goddard {{left her}} family and went to Paris. She {{extracted}} a meager allowance from her mother, took voice lessons, and for a time sang in a cabaret, before finding out she was pregnant and delivering a baby girl on February 17, 1887. She placed the infant in a convent for care, then travelled to Rome to study art. Goddard was the only female student in her life class, as it was unusual for women to work from nude models. She encountered what would now be called sexual harassment. When a fellow student left a book open on her stool with pornographic passages underlined, she <b>picked</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> hit him in the face with it, but he and his friends stalked her. She fled to Capri after he tried to force her to marry him.|$|E
5|$|The Browns next {{played the}} Buffalo Bisons in Buffalo, New York. Just over 30,000 people watched the game; while {{this was a}} lower total than the Browns' {{previous}} two games, it set a professional football attendance record in Buffalo. Playing in 80-degree heat, Browns quarterback Otto Graham threw two touchdowns {{in the first quarter}} to John Yonakor and Marion Motley. Cleveland scored for a third time in the first quarter when Cliff Lewis, substituting for Graham, pitched a lateral to Gaylon Smith, who ran it in for a touchdown. After neither team scored {{in the second and third}} quarters, the Browns added a fourth touchdown on Chet Adams' fumble return. Al Dekdebrun, Buffalo's second-string quarterback, fumbled at the Bisons' 34-yard line and Adams <b>picked</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> ran for a touchdown. The Bisons were held scoreless despite having more first downs than the Browns. The team played without its primary rushing threat, Steve Juzwik, who was sidelined with a pulled leg muscle.|$|E
25|$|CBS {{dropped the}} show after one season. ABC <b>picked</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> ran it {{for another five}} seasons, from October 2, 1958, to June 20, 1963. In his memoirs, Jerry Mathers states the move was the {{decision}} of the sponsor, Ralston Purina, who arranged a better deal with ABC than with CBS.|$|E

25|$|Chicago's first {{touchdown}} {{resulted on}} a New York punt attempt {{from their own}} 12, forcing Sean Landeta to make the kick three yards into his goal line. As Landeta dropped the ball to kick it, the wind altered the ball's descent and caused it to go {{off the side of}} his foot. As a result, the ball went right into the ground and bounced a short distance before reserve safety Shaun Gayle <b>picked</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> returned the -7 yard punt five yards for a touchdown. Gayle's run was the shortest punt return touchdown in NFL history.|$|E
25|$|In March 2011, {{during a}} game away at Zenit Saint Petersburg, a banana was held near Carlos {{by one of the}} fans as the footballer was taking part in a flag-raising ceremony. In June, in a match away at Krylia Sovetov Samara, Roberto Carlos {{received}} a pass from the goalkeeper and was about to pass it when a banana was thrown onto the pitch, landing nearby. The 38-year-old Brazilian <b>picked</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> threw it by the sidelines, walking off the field before the final whistle and raising two fingers at the stands, indicating this was the second such incident since March.|$|E

25|$|There {{are several}} legends {{to how the}} town of Modoc got its name. One of them said that a man {{travelling}} on the train threw out a cigar box containing the name Modoc, and that Henry Conley, {{one of the first}} settlers of the town, <b>picked</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> suggested to bystanders {{that it would be a}} good name for the town. Another theory is that Modoc was named after the Modoc people who were traditionally located in northern California. They became noted for their resistance to the US Army during the Modoc War, ending in 1873.|$|E
25|$|Indianapolis {{took the}} second half kickoff and stormed down the field, {{overcoming}} some blown plays along the way. During the drive, Trudeau was sacked for an 11-yard loss on second down and 11, but a defensive holding penalty negated the play and gave the Colts a first down. Later on, Dickerson fumbled the ball, but Trudeau <b>picked</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> threw a 15-yard first down completion to Bill Brooks. Eventually, Indianapolis reached the Browns 20-yard line, but linebacker Eddie Johnson hit Trudeau as he threw a pass, causing the ball to go straight {{up in the air}} where it was intercepted by Wright at the 14.|$|E
25|$|In the meantime, a less-well known New Zealand rugby union player, Albert Henry Baskerville (or Baskiville), {{was about}} to recruit a group of players for a {{professional}} tour of Great Britain. It is believed that Baskerville first {{became aware of the}} profits to be made from such a venture while he was working at the Wellington Post Office in 1906: a colleague had a coughing fit and dropped a British newspaper. Baskerville <b>picked</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> noticed a report about a Northern Union match that over 40,000 people had attended. Baskerville wrote to the NRFU asking if they would host a New Zealand touring party. George Smith learned of Baskerville's activities and they joined forces to recruit a team.|$|E

25|$|But Miami {{took the}} second half kickoff and nearly doubled their yardage, driving 60 yards in 10 plays, {{including}} receptions by O. J. McDuffie for gains of 11 and 27 yards. Marino, who completed only five of eight passes for 28 yards in the first half, completed all six of his passes for 55 yards on the drive and finished it with a 1-yard touchdown pass to Oronde Gadsden. On the ensuing kickoff, Rogers fumbled the ball, then <b>picked</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> returned it 85 yards for a touchdown, giving Seattle a 17–10 lead. After a few punts, Miami drove 32 yards in six plays, aided by two runs by Autry Denson for 28 yards, {{to set up a}} 50-yard field goal from Mare, cutting the score to 17–13.|$|E
25|$|LSU {{received}} {{the ball to}} start the third quarter. On the first drive, Cannon ran around the right side for 25 yards. The drive stalled at the Rice 40-yard line, however, and Cannon punted down to the one-inch line. The Owls were forced to punt soon after, and the ball landed at their own 35-yard line, where Cannon <b>picked</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> returned it 30 yards to the Rice five-yard line. Johnny Robinson scored on the next play with a run to the left side. Later in the third, Rice's Charles Knight intercepted a pass on the LSU 37-yard line. The Owls drove down the field and scored on the first play of the fourth quarter. Later in the fourth, Mel Branch of the Chinese Bandits intercepted a pass at the Rice 30-yard line. Nine plays later, Davis scored the final touchdown {{of the game and}} kicked the extra point.|$|E
25|$|In 2007, Stoltenberg {{went into}} more detail {{about how she}} {{started out as a}} drug addict, to TV {{journalist}} Tonje Steinsland–the second time her life as an addict {{was the subject of a}} television special. It started in 1991, when she was 27. She witnessed two drug addicts in a fight in a cafe in Oslo when something fell out of the pocket of one of them. She <b>picked</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> saw that it was heroin. Together with her boyfriend she went home and decided to snort the drug. For the next three years she was an intravenous drug user. By the end of the 1990s, she was close to dying. In the interview, Stoltenberg also tells of a boyfriend who subjected her to punishments, psychological terror and much fear, however, the heroin turned all of that into a feeling of freedom and made her perceive their relationship as simply wonderful, for a while.|$|E

25|$|On the Patriots' {{first drive}} {{of the second}} half, on 1st and 10 from their own 44-yard line, after a Brady lateral pass to Moss fell short, Moss <b>picked</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> threw it back to Brady, who then found Gaffney deep for a 56-yard touchdown. After another Steelers three-and-out, the Patriots' second {{possession}} of the half also went for a touchdown, as a 2-yard Welker reception capped a 10-play drive that included one run, a 4-yard Brady scramble. In the opening minutes of the fourth quarter, the Steelers moved {{the ball to the}} Patriots' 1-yard line, but failed to score on 3rd and goal and 4th and goal. The Patriots took the ball at their own 1-yard line and then began a 6-minute, 12 play drive, passing on every down. Using a no-huddle offense, Welker caught five straight passes to bring the Patriots to the Steelers' 36-yard line. Brady completed four more passes to set up first-and-goal from the Steelers' 10-yard line, but his next three passes were all incomplete, leading to a 28-yard Gostkowski field goal. The Steelers' next possession, a 13-play drive, ended in another failed fourth down conversion. After a Patriots punt, the Steelers ran the ball three times to give the Patriots their 13th win of the season; with the win, the Patriots improved to 13–0 and also clinched a first-round playoff bye.|$|E
