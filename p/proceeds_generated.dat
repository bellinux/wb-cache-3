500|$|Wenger sanctioned Wright's {{transfer}} to West Ham {{in the summer}} and made Anelka his first-choice striker ahead of the 1998–99 season. His decision not to bolster Arsenal's attack, coupled with Bergkamp's fear of flying, meant the club entered the Champions League with just one recognised striker. Their time in the competition was brief, making an exit at the group stage, with their domestic form being indifferent. Needing to strengthen their attacking options, Arsenal signed Nwankwo Kanu in January 1999, and his presence reinvigorated the team as they embarked on a run similar to last season. They finished second behind Manchester United however, losing their slender advantage once they lost their penultimate match. United also eliminated Arsenal in a FA Cup semi-final replay after extra time; Wenger afterwards said: [...] "it was a smashing game, and in the end, the luckiest won." [...] In August 1999, Anelka joined Real Madrid having threatened to strike if Arsenal did not grant him a move abroad. Wenger used a portion of the <b>proceeds</b> <b>generated</b> through the Anelka sale to fund the build of the Arsenal Training Centre, expressing his desire to establish a [...] "home away from Arsenal". He renewed his forward line by signing Davor Šuker from Real, and Thierry Henry, who joined after seven [...] "injury-interrupted" [...] months at Juventus for £11.5 million. It was Wenger's intention to partner Anelka with Henry, but the former's departure meant the plan was scrapped.|$|E

40|$|The {{deposition}} of human RT 112 cells in a patterned fashion onto glass substrates and subsequent imaging of {{the expression of}} the trans-membrane protein CD 44 have been studied using scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM). Patterns of RT 112 cells derived from a transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder could be deposited on amino-modified glass substrates by cytospinning. These were then treated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) labeled secondary antibodies to the trans-membrane protein CD 44. Expression of CD 44 protein by the cells directly leads to immobilisation of the labeled antibodies. The presence of the enzyme substrate (hydrogen peroxide) along with a hydroquinone mediator then allowed an enzymatic reaction to <b>proceed,</b> <b>generating</b> benzoquinone. Reduction of benzoquinone gave rise to positive feedback between the substrate and the SECM microelectrode tip. Control samples such as blank slides or slides not treated with HRP-labeled antibody showed negative feedback effects. Patterns of RT 112 cells could be assembled and their expression of the target protein imaged whereas control samples showed minimal activity...|$|R

2500|$|The 2006 ban {{on imports}} of Georgian wine to Russia, one of Georgia's biggest trading partners, and break of {{financial}} links {{was described by}} the IMF Mission as an [...] "external shock". In addition, Russia increased {{the price of gas}} for Georgia. Around the same time, the National Bank of Georgia stated that ongoing inflation in the country was mainly triggered by external reasons, including Russia’s economic embargo. The Georgian authorities expected that the current account deficit due to the embargo in 2007 would be financed by [...] "higher foreign exchange <b>proceeds</b> <b>generated</b> by the large inflow of foreign direct investment" [...] and an increase in tourist revenues. The country has also maintained a solid credit in international market securities. Georgia is becoming more integrated into the global trading network: its 2015 imports and exports account for 50% and 21% of GDP respectively. Georgia's main imports are fuels, vehicles, machinery and parts, grain and other foods, pharmaceuticals. Main exports are vehicles, ferro-alloys, fertilizers, nuts, scrap metal, gold, copper ores.|$|E
