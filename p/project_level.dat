40|$|Emerging economies have {{struggled}} {{hard to keep}} inflation low {{at the same time}} as facilitating high economic growth. These economies always attempt to execute strategic policy framework to curb inflation which in-turn affect the growth rate. This paper attempts to provide an overview of a monetary policy measure known as ‘Inflation Targeting Framework’ to target inflation at a <b>projected</b> <b>level</b> by manipulating other macroeconomic variables. The focus of the paper is to study inflationary situation in a vast and diverse emerging economy—India. Some parts of India are very affluent while others lack the basic amenities. This study, therefore, explores the implications of a strategic framework that is dynamic and flexible in nature and can be implemented with ease. The study empirically investigates the relationship between inflation and major economic aggregates. The findings show that inflation is highly correlated with interest rates, money supply, and real effective exchange rates. Thus, these variables can be adjusted to target inflation at a <b>projected</b> <b>level.</b> The outcome of this paper also provides suggestions for the implementation of a phase-wise flexible strategic policy framework...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{a brief overview}} of the generic forward projections that were undertaken using the reference case models for the 2011 assessments for bigeye, skipjack, and yellowfin tunas. These models were adopted by SC 7 for the provision of management advice. Similar methods were used as in previous years and the results are provided {{in the form of an}} excel spreadsheets with a separate worksheet for each species. Of particular interest from the projections is that maintenance of bigeye tuna catch and effort levels observed in the fishery in 2009 results in F/FMSY remaining high and is at a <b>projected</b> <b>level</b> of 1. 39 in 2021. However, for the scenario best approximating the reported catch and effort in the fishery in 2010, F/FMSY declines and is at a <b>projected</b> <b>level</b> of 0. 97 in 2021. For scenarios that mimic a total purse seine closure, there is a relatively small incremental reduction in F/FMSY compared to that achieved by a FAD closure. However, this comes at a cost of substantial reductions in total catch...|$|R
