25|$|The 101-unit townhouse {{social housing}} complex at Danzig Street and Morningside Avenue is called Morningside Coronation by TCHC and D-Block by residents. Toys and {{bicycles}} fill the tiny {{yards of the}} young families <b>packed</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> complex. Alcohol is prohibited in common areas without a special-occasion permit. There is a strict no-gun policy: anyone caught with a gun is turned over to police, and tenants caught housing someone with a gun are evicted.|$|E
25|$|Each {{photoreceptor}} cell {{consists of}} two main sections, the cell body and the rhabdomere. The cell body contains the nucleus, while the 100-μm-long rhabdomere {{is made up of}} toothbrush-like stacks of membrane called microvilli. Each microvillus is 1–2 μm in length and about 60 nm in diameter. The membrane of the rhabdomere is packed with about 100 million rhodopsin molecules, the visual protein that absorbs light. The rest of the visual proteins are also tightly <b>packed</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> microvillar space, leaving little room for cytoplasm.|$|E

Kangaroos coach Bob Fulton had named the young half {{as the team}} hooker, and he did indeed <b>pack</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> scrums.

25|$|Of great {{importance}} to the model building effort of Watson and Crick was Rosalind Franklin's understanding of basic chemistry, which indicated that the hydrophilic phosphate-containing backbones of the nucleotide chains of DNA should be positioned so as to interact with water molecules {{on the outside of}} the molecule while the hydrophobic bases should be <b>packed</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> core. Franklin shared this chemical knowledge with Watson and Crick when she pointed out to them that their first model (from 1951, with the phosphates inside) was obviously wrong.|$|E
25|$|The first {{match to}} be played at the Victoria Ground was a {{friendly}} against Talke Rangers on 28 March 1878; Stoke won 1–0 in front of 2,500 fans. The ground was originally an oval shape to cater for athletics, and this shape was retained for the next 30 years. Major development work began in the 1920s, and by 1930 the ground had lost its original shape. By 1935, the ground capacity was up to 50,000. A record crowd of 51,380 <b>packed</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Ground on 29 March 1937 to watch a league match against Arsenal.|$|E
25|$|Carbon {{itself is}} solid at {{case-hardening}} temperatures {{and so is}} immobile. Transport {{to the surface of}} the steel was as gaseous carbon monoxide, generated by the breakdown of the carburising compound and the oxygen <b>packed</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> sealed box. This takes place with pure carbon but too slowly to be workable. Although oxygen is required for this process it is re-circulated through the CO cycle and so can be carried out inside a sealed box. The sealing is necessary to stop the CO either leaking out or being oxidised to CO2 by excess outside air.|$|E

25|$|On October 22, 1840, Sister St. Théodore and her companions {{stepped from}} a {{carriage}} into {{the wilds of}} Saint Mary-of-the-Woods, Indiana, a small village in Vigo County a few miles northwest of Terre Haute. For several months, they lived <b>packed</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> small frontier farmhouse of the local Thralls family {{along with a few}} postulants that had been waiting for them when they arrived. With the founding of this new order separate from that in France, Guerin became known as Mother Theodore, the superior of the Sisters of Providence of Saint Mary-of-the-Woods.|$|E
25|$|The most {{simple way}} to make a dry-sand cores is in a dump core box, in which sand is <b>packed</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> box and scraped level with the top. A wood or metal plate is then placed over the box, and then the two are flipped over and the core segment falls out of the core box. The core segment is then baked or hardened. Multiple core {{segments}} are then hot glued together or attached by some other means. Any rough spots are filed or sanded down. Finally, the core is lightly coated with graphite, silica, or mica to give a smoother surface finish and greater resistance to heat.|$|E
25|$|Continuing his {{experiments}} in Brantford, Bell {{brought home a}} working model of his telephone. On August 3, 1876, from the telegraph office in Mount Pleasant five miles (eightkm) away from Brantford, Bell sent a tentative telegram indicating that he was ready. With curious onlookers <b>packed</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> office as witnesses, faint voices were heard replying. The following night, he amazed guests {{as well as his}} family when a message was received at the Bell home from Brantford, four miles (six km) distant, along an improvised wire strung up along telegraph lines and fences, and laid through a tunnel. This time, guests at the household distinctly heard people in Brantford reading and singing. These experiments clearly proved that the telephone could work over long distances.|$|E

25|$|On Saturday 7 April 1973, {{the opening}} round of the VFL season {{included}} a match held at Windy Hill between Essendon and Richmond, which became in effect a John Coleman memorial. Richmond defeated Essendon by 2 points that day, the decisive last goal of the game kicked by Richmond's Kevin Sheedy, who {{would go on to}} be Essendon's next premiership winning coach (1984) after Coleman. After a large funeral conducted at St Thomas' Church of England, in Mount Alexander Road, Moonee Ponds (the church in which he had married) by Archdeacon Randal Hugh Deasey (1916–) on Monday 9 April 1973, attended by many of Melbourne's sporting community, Coleman was cremated. 400 people <b>packed</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> church, and another 600 stood outside the church listening to the service broadcast over loudspeakers.|$|E
25|$|STS-126 {{included}} the Leonardo Multi-Purpose Logistics Module (MPLM) on its fifth spaceflight. Leonardo held over 14,000 pounds of supplies and equipment. Among the items <b>packed</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> MPLM were two new crew quarters racks, a second galley (kitchen) for the Destiny laboratory, a second Waste and Hygiene Compartment (WHC) rack (lavatory), the advanced Resistive Exercise Device (aRED), two water reclamation racks, spare hardware, and new experiments. Also included in Leonardo was the General Laboratory Active Cryogenic ISS Experiment Refrigerator, or GLACIER, a double locker cryogenic freezer for transporting and preserving science experiments. The shuttle also carried irradiated turkey, candied yams, stuffing and dessert {{for a special}} Thanksgiving meal at the station, {{as well as an}} Official Flight Kit with mementos for those who supported the astronauts and helped them complete their mission successfully.|$|E
25|$|The band {{returned}} half a {{year later}} and performed their most famous show to date at Paddington Town Hall, on 12 December 1977. Two thousand people supposedly <b>packed</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> venue, which was partially destroyed by crazed fans. After this show, the band moved their base of operations to London, and toured extensively in the UK and Europe, both headlining and as support for Sire label-mates The Flamin Groovies. Their overseas success was short-lived as Sire Records began having financial difficulties and were forced to drop Radio Birdman and many other bands from their label. A planned American tour with The Ramones, scheduled {{for the second half}} of 1978, was cancelled. In May 1978, they recorded their second album Living Eyes at Rockfield Studio in Wales. Unreleased by Sire, the tapes eventually were released in 1981, long after the band's 1978 break-up.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, {{the dynamic}} column method can be used. The {{particles}} are contacted with a solvent {{until they are}} completely soaked. This can be done prior or after <b>packing</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> column. <b>The</b> <b>packed</b> bed is then rinsed with the liquid extractant until inlet and outlet concentrations are the same. This approach is particularly interesting when particles are already packed in a column and shall be reused for a SIR application.|$|R

25|$|JPEG uses a lossy form of {{compression}} {{based on}} the discrete cosine transform (DCT). This mathematical operation converts each frame/field of the video source from the spatial (2D) domain into the frequency domain (a.k.a. transform domain). A perceptual model based loosely on the human psychovisual system discards high-frequency information, i.e. sharp transitions in intensity, and color hue. In the transform domain, the process of reducing information is called quantization. In simpler terms, quantization is a method for optimally reducing a large number scale (with different occurrences of each number) into a smaller one, and the transform-domain is a convenient representation of the image because the high-frequency coefficients, which contribute less to the overall picture than other coefficients, are characteristically small-values with high compressibility. The quantized coefficients are then sequenced and losslessly <b>packed</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> output bitstream. Nearly all software implementations of JPEG permit user control over the compression-ratio (as well as other optional parameters), allowing the user to trade off picture-quality for smaller file size. In embedded applications (such as miniDV, which uses a similar DCT-compression scheme), the parameters are pre-selected and fixed for the application.|$|E

The extensive amount of time it took to assemble and disassemble the stage interfered with the development of the schedule for the 2010 Major League Baseball season. U2 was also forced to reschedule what would have been their final Giants Stadium concert, when the NFL changed the start time of a New York Jets game, and load-out time from the concert {{a day and a half}} prior would have been insufficient.|$|E
