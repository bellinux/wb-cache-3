In 2006, Jared Leto created the cover art for , a compilation of live music that includes a Thirty Seconds to Mars song, which proceeds from the sales benefited The Nature Conservancy. During their Welcome to the Universe Tour, the group worked to develop strategies that would minimize fuel consumption to offset the impact that the tour would have had on the environment.|$|E
25|$|Experimental {{cognitive}} psychologists {{carry out}} research on reasoning behaviour. Such research may focus, for example, on how people perform on tests of reasoning such as intelligence or IQ tests, or on how well people's reasoning matches ideals set by logic (see, for example, the Wason test). Experiments examine how people make inferences from conditionals e.g., If A then B and how they make inferences about alternatives, e.g., A or else B. They test whether <b>people</b> <b>can</b> <b>make</b> valid deductions about spatial and temporal relations, e.g., A is {{to the left of}} B, or A happens after B, and about quantified assertions, e.g., All the A are B. Experiments investigate how people make inferences about factual situations, hypothetical possibilities, probabilities, and counterfactual situations.|$|E

And what's more, Their children are less likely to get higher education in order to get into higher class in their futures. It could lower the social class mobility to our self and so does our next generation. The major problem of first generation is about earning money for family because of housing inequality. It's hard to get a loan from bank and lots of bills to pay. They just worry how to survive to tomorrow. But for our children, they deserve a better future, but under housing inequality, they need more time and money to get the same education as who are not suffering from housing inequality. These makes them give up their education easily but {{this is the only way}} they can get into higher class in the future. Not so many of <b>people</b> <b>can</b> <b>make</b> it.|$|E

One common mistake <b>people</b> <b>can</b> <b>make</b> is thinking that the 2.0 16V (F7R) used in the Williams is simply a bored out 1.8 16V (F7P), whereas, in reality the large engine had different size valves, cams, stroked crank and engine oil cooler. Other differences between the Williams and the Clio 16S it is based on include a wider front track with wishbones similar, but {{not the same as the}} Renault 19, wider Speedline alloys, uprated (JC5) gearbox, bespoke four-to-one manifold, firmer suspension, and some cosmetic differences on the exterior and interior.|$|E
2500|$|In 1980, the Flat Earth Society accused NASA of faking the landings, {{arguing that}} they were staged by Hollywood with Walt Disney sponsorship, based on a script by Arthur C. Clarke and {{directed}} by Stanley Kubrick. Folklorist Linda Dégh suggests that writer-director Peter Hyams' 1978 film Capricorn One, which shows a hoaxed journey to Mars in a spacecraft that looks identical to the Apollo craft, might have given a boost to the hoax theory's popularity in the post-Vietnam War era. She notes that this happened during the post-Watergate era, when American citizens were inclined to distrust official accounts. Dégh writes: [...] "The mass media catapult these half-truths {{into a kind of}} twilight zone where <b>people</b> <b>can</b> <b>make</b> their guesses sound as truths. Mass media have a terrible impact on people who lack guidance."

2500|$|Ignoring the {{prevailing}} attitude, Civitans adopted {{service to the}} developmentally disabled as a major organizational emphasis in 1952. Their earliest efforts included workshops for special education teachers and daycamps for disabled children, {{all at a time}} when such training and programs were almost nonexistent. In the United States, the segregation of people with developmental disabilities wasn't widely questioned by academics or policy-makers until the 1969 publication of Wolf Wolfensberger's seminal work [...] "The Origin and Nature of Our Institutional Models", drawing on some of the ideas proposed by SG Howe 100 years earlier. This book posited that society characterizes people with disabilities as deviant, sub-human and burdens of charity, resulting in the adoption of that [...] "deviant" [...] role. Wolfensberger argued that this dehumanization, and the segregated institutions that result from it, ignored the potential productive contributions that all <b>people</b> <b>can</b> <b>make</b> to society. He pushed for a shift in policy and practice that recognized the human needs of [...] "retardates" [...] and provided the same basic human rights as {{for the rest of the}} population.|$|E

6000|$|My friends, {{these may}} seem deep words to some--doubtless they are, {{for they are}} {{the words of the}} Bible--so deep that plain, unlearned <b>people</b> <b>can</b> <b>make</b> no use of them, and draw no lesson from them. I do not think so. I think it is of endless use and endless {{importance}} to you how you think about Christ; and, therefore, how you think about these forty days between our Lord's resurrection and ascension. You may think of our Lord in two ways. You may think of Him as having gone very far away, millions of millions of miles into the sky, and not to return till the last day,-- and then, I do not say that you will weep and lament. There are not many who have that notion about our Lord, and yet love Him enough to weep and lament at the thought of His having gone away. But your religion, when it wakes up in you, will be a melancholy and terrifying one. I say, when it wakes up in you--for you will be tempted continually to let it go to sleep. There will come over you the feeling--God forgive us, does it not come over us all but too often?--Christ is far away. Does He see me? [...] Does He hear me? Will He find me out? Does it matter very much what I say and do now, provided I make my peace with Him before I die? And so will come over you not merely a carelessness about religious duties, about prayer, reading, church-going, but worse still, a carelessness about right and wrong. You will be in danger of caring little about controlling your passions, about speaking the truth, about being just and merciful to your fellow-men. And then, when your conscience wakes you up at times, and cries, Prepare to meet thy God! you will be terrified and anxious at the thought of judgment, and shrink from the thought of Christ's seeing you. My friends, that is a fearful state, though a very common one. What is it but a foretaste of that dreadful terror in which those who would not see in Christ their Lord and Saviour will call on the mountains to fall on them, and the hills to cover them, from Him that sitteth on the throne, and from the anger of the Lamb? ...|$|E
