40|$|The aim of {{the studies}} was to {{estimate}} the post-effect of bottom sediment addition to the substratum on lead uptaking by the plants under the conditions of pot experiments. Very acid soil and bottom sediment dredged from RoŜnów Reservoir were used for preparation of substrata. Bottom sediment share ranged between 0 and 16 % of substratum mass. Tested plants were grown in orders: maize (Zea mays L.) and horse bean (Vicia faba L., var. minor) as well as oat (Avena sativa L.) and lupine (Lupinus angustifolius L.). The <b>plants</b> were <b>harvested</b> for <b>green</b> mass. The content of Pb in mineralisats obtained from plant material was determined by ICP-AES method. The total quantity of Pb removed with yield of the plants depending on species {{and part of the}} plant was compared and changes affected by bottom sediment share in substratum as well as previous plant cultivation were estimated. Under the conditions of substratum contaminated by lead significantly higher amounts of Pb were accumulated in roots than in tops of the plant. In average, the highest Pb contents were determined in lupine roots and horse bean tops, while the lowest data were found in maize roots and tops. Considering total quantity of Pb, the highest amounts were removed with yield of maize, and the lowest with yield of horse bean. The Pb translocation coefficients (TC) (content in the tops versus content in the roots) as well as th...|$|R

40|$|Green tea (Camellia sinensis var. sinensis) is an {{established}} crop around the world. However, local {{factors in the}} development of the green tea industry in Australia meant that we needed to understand and manage quality changes in freshly <b>harvested</b> <b>green</b> tea before processing. Japanese-style green tea is processed (steamed and dried) as soon as possible after harvest. In this study we examined the effect of delaying processing at different storage temperatures and cooling rates. The results consistently showed that freshly <b>harvested</b> <b>green</b> tea shoots had a very high rate of respiration. Most of this energy is released as heat; hence high temperatures are generated by freshly <b>harvested</b> <b>green</b> tea shoots. Postharvest cooling is therefore essential to remove this respiration heat. In this study, different types of cooling were investigated. The results offer some potential for the short term storage of freshly harvested shoots. The effect of lower storage temperatures on leaf quality showed that the lower temperatures reduced the rate of deterioration in physical appearance of the shoots. The effect of the lower storage temperatures on green tea quality showed there were no differences between treatments as measured by the standard AF system using the near infra red (NIR) determination of the final green tea product. However, the quality of final tea will decline if excessive time and temperatures are experienced by freshly <b>harvested</b> <b>green</b> tea shoots before processing. The measurement of the individual components of green tea quality before processing showed that the lower storage temperature maintained the chemical composition of the harvested shoots within the first 24 hours of storage at 3 °C. But these quality attributes (total catechins and theanine content) declined by 48 hours storage indicating loss by oxidation and polymerisation. This short window of storage within the first 24 hours after harvest provides some opportunities for further investigation. These results confirm the necessity for adequate postharvest handling and logistics in <b>green</b> tea <b>harvesting</b> and processing...|$|R

Application of cow dung as organic fertilizer as the basal {{at a rate of}} 15, 000 kg / ha plus a dose of inorganic fertilizer (12 : 9 : 8 N:P:K) at a rate of 200 kg/ha after one month gave the highest DM yields compared to organic fertilizer only at the rate of 25, 000 kg/ha or inorganic fertilizer only at the rate of 400 kg/ha both as basal. The type of the fertilizer package used also affected the composition of leaves, stems and berries in plants. DM yields were low in <b>plants</b> <b>harvested</b> at 70 days.

40|$|Insufficient {{access to}} {{clean water and}} {{sanitation}} {{has become one of}} the most universal problems affecting human health in developing countries, water resources are facing high pollution rate due to improper management of wastewater. Ecological technologies such as constructed wetlands are promising innovative solutions for this universal problem. Constructed wetlands are engineered wastewater treatment systems that include treatment segments such as physical, chemical, and biological processes like in natural wetlands. <b>Plant</b> <b>harvesting</b> practice is one management strategy that can prevent these systems from clogging and loss of surface area, the effects of this management strategy need to be assessed related to the performance of wetlands. The aim of this thesis was to investigate the effects of <b>plants</b> <b>harvesting</b> on nutrients removal (N, P, and COD) in constructed wetlands. This is a literature review and experimental based thesis. The literature review involved reviewing 5 studies about effect of <b>harvesting</b> <b>plants</b> in constructed wetlands. The experiment part involved data analysis from 6 experimental wetlands, with 3 wetlands that have been harvested in 2015 and 2016, another 3 wetlands that have never been harvested. Results from literature review indicated that <b>plant</b> <b>harvesting</b> in wetland has a significant effect in nutrients removal. Experiment results indicated that there was significant difference between these wetlands in TN and NO 3 -N removed when the entire operation period was considered (P= 0. 005). But when each season was considered separately statistical differences were only observed during first summer after harvesting for TN removal. For NO 3 -N, differences between wetlands were observed in first summer and winter only. For summer, harvested wetland performed better than non-harvested wetland, but in winter non-harvested wetland performed better than harvested in terms of NO 3 -N removal. For winter, the reason to this could be that, some of plants parts decay and provided denitriﬁcation bacteria with a carbon source which accelerates denitrification process. According to this study, <b>plants</b> <b>harvesting</b> in wetland generally has a positive effect on nutrient removal such as TN, TP, COD, and BOD. Therefore, this practice could be recommended as the best wetland plants management to improve and maintain nutrient removal in constructed wetlands...|$|R
