25|$|The {{death of}} her only son Lance Reventlow in an air crash in 1972 sent Hutton {{into a state of}} despair. By this time, her fortune had diminished, due to her extreme generosity, {{including}} donating Winfield House to the United States government as a residence for its UK ambassador. Alleged questionable deals by her longtime lawyer, Graham Mattison, also ate away at her fortune. Eventually she began liquidating assets in order to raise funds to live, yet continued to spend money on strangers willing to <b>pay</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> attention to her. She spent her final years in Los Angeles, living at the Beverly Wilshire Hotel, where she died from a heart attack in May 1979, aged 66. One biographer wrote that, at her death, $3,500 was all that remained of her fortune, but some who actually knew her said that was not the case. She was interred in the Woolworth family mausoleum at Woodlawn Cemetery in The Bronx, New York.|$|E

In late 2006 / early 2007, the P2 was resurrected once again, with different platter [...] thicker than before at 22mm, and weightier.

After {{subtracting}} the personal exemption, the standard deduction and assuming no tax credits, then applying the 10% {{rate of the}} lowest bracket, the person ends up <b>paying</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> less than 4% of income in taxes.

500|$|The Earth's {{geothermal}} {{resources are}} theoretically {{more than adequate}} to supply humanity's energy needs, but {{only a very small}} fraction may be profitably exploited. Drilling and exploration for deep resources is very expensive. Forecasts for the future of geothermal power depend on assumptions about technology, energy prices, subsidies, plate boundary movement and interest rates. Pilot programs like EWEB's customer opt in Green Power Program show that customers would be willing to <b>pay</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more for a renewable energy source like geothermal. But as a result of government assisted research and industry experience, the cost of generating geothermal power has decreased by 25% over the past two decades. In 2001, geothermal energy costs between two and ten US cents per kWh.|$|E
500|$|Bennet cut {{her hair}} for the season, {{in order to}} further her character's {{transformation}} to the Daisy Johnson / Quake of the comics, while not cutting her hair as short as her comic counterpart. Bennet stated, [...] "The comic book version of Daisy Johnson has very short, Miley Cyrus-esque hair. We wanted to stay true to the comic book character fans love; I wanted to please them but also make sure there was still some movement and length and sexiness in the hair." [...] Bennet also received a new costume for the season, along with Quake's signature gauntlets. On the costume, Foley said, [...] "It's about strength. She feels very empowered in it....I wanted to stay true to some of the designs I saw in the comics. In the style lines, I wanted to <b>pay</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit of a tribute to [...] tactical ability from last season, but we also incorporated the Quake symbol into her gauntlets and {{on the back of her}} suit." [...] Legacy Effects created the gauntlets and utility belt, [...] "out of flexible materials painted to look like metal" [...] so as not to injure anyone during stunts.|$|E

60|$|One evening our hero, after <b>paying</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> unwonted {{attention}} to his toilet prepared to set out for Miss Millet's cottage.

Megan McArdle {{commented on the}} Title IX complaint in Bloomberg View saying, [...] "I don't find (Nungesser's) litany of complaints particularly compelling", and stated that she believed the gender discrimination claim was unlikely to succeed. McArdle concluded by suggesting that Nungesser may not have intended to win the suit or to silence Sulkowicz, but instead to [...] "force the media to <b>pay</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> attention to {{his side of the}} story, something that didn't happen during the many long months of Sulkowicz's campaign to name and shame him." [...] Slate columnist Nora Caplan-Bricker questioned whether the suit could succeed, noting that courts have previously dismissed similar suits in which men accused of sexual assault claimed that they were victims of gender discrimination.|$|E

The Common Law of Business Balance prohibits <b>paying</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> and getting <b>a</b> lot…it can’t be done.

Here in my opinion is the only imaginative prose-writer of the slightest value who has appeared among the English-speaking races for some years past.

Why is it that so many people are more comfortable self-medicating for conditions that exist only in advertisements, than they are simply taking their doctor's advice?

60|$|This is {{the system}} at all good hotels. If Reggie comes, of course he will <b>pay</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more: I cannot forget that {{he gave me a}} dressing-case. Sphinxes pay a hundred per cent more than any one else--they always did in Ancient Egypt.|$|E
