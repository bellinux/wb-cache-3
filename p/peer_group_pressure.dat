50|$|Several {{studies have}} shown that peer groups are {{powerful}} agents of risk behaviors in adolescence. Adolescents typically replace family with peers regarding social and leisure activities, and many problematic behaviors occur in the context of these groups. A study done in 2012 focused on adolescents’ engagement in risk behaviors. Participants completed a self-report measure of identity commitment, which explores values, beliefs, and aspirations, as well as a self-report that measures perceived <b>peer</b> <b>group</b> <b>pressure</b> and control. Both <b>peer</b> <b>group</b> <b>pressure</b> and control were positively related to risky behaviors. However, adolescents who were more committed to a personal identity had lower rates of risk behaviors. Overall, this study shows us that adolescent identity development may help prevent negative effects of peer pressure in high-risk adolescents.|$|E

Nonprestigious age-graded linguistic features tend to peak during adolescence “when <b>peer</b> <b>group</b> <b>pressure</b> not {{to conform to}} society’s norms is greatest” (Holmes 1992:184). The use of standard or prestige forms peaks {{between the ages of}} 30 and 55. When people reach middle age, they tend to follow societal norms more because that is when the societal pressure to conform is greatest. At this stage of life, people become more conservative and use the fewest vernacular forms.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{qualitative}} {{study was to investigate}} how the emotional wellbeing of female adolescents is influenced by constructions of femininity in a single-sex high school environment. From one single-sex high school, four young women aged 17 and 18 years of age and two teachers were asked {{to be a part of}} this study. A qualitative approach was used in this study to elicit thick description of participants’ constructions of femininity and emotional wellbeing. Underpinning this research is an interpretivist and social-constructivist methodology, whereby social-constructivist researchers attempt to build understanding of phenomena by accessing the meaning that participants assign to themselves through the experiences they have with the world around them. Qualitative data tools were therefore used, including semi-structured individual interviews and focus groups. Analysis of the data involved a qualitative strategy called thematic analysis. This enabled categories and themes to be taken from the data as they emerged. Key themes from this study demonstrated that the school curriculum, teachers, religious expectations, family experiences and <b>peer</b> <b>group</b> <b>pressures</b> directly influenced student feminine gender constructions. Alongside this, peer pressures to be feminine, negative perceptions of self body image, confusion of self and gender-identity, inadequate school health education and negative stigma surrounding mental and emotional health negatively affected student emotional wellbeing. From these results, various implications have emerged. First, single-sex schools and its teachers should work to eliminate gendered stereotypes that restrict young women’s interests and opportunities. Second, teachers and schools need to be aware of female peer dynamics and seek ways to facilitate healthy relationships and identity development of its students. Further, health education personnel should factor in female <b>peer</b> <b>group</b> dynamics when implementing emotional wellbeing programmes, curriculum and policy initiatives aimed at female adolescents. Finally, students need realistic and relevant health education that supports understandings and coping strategies for self-esteem, identity confusion and perceptions of body image. Health education also needs to promote a positive view of mental and emotional health and encourage the use of the school’s mental health service...|$|R

The present study aimed to investigate how parent and peer relationships impacts on adolescent materialism and wellbeing. A correlational design was employed, utilising standardised questionnaires, previously validated as appropriate tools for the topics and age of participants. Participants (N= 166) aged 13 - 15 were recruited from two secondary schools in South England. Adolescents completed measures of materialism, peer support, parental support, perceived <b>peer</b> <b>group</b> <b>pressure,</b> contingent self-worth and wellbeing. Parents (N= 47) of participants completed measures of materialism and parental support.

40|$|American {{high school}} {{students}} devote much less {{time and energy to}} their studies than the students of other nations. The cause of the lack of motivation is the lack of rewards for studying hard and for taking rigorous courses. This occurs for four reasons. First, the u. S. economy fails to give academic achievement its due reward in the labor market and rewards instead credentials that signify time spent, rather than competencies acquired. In most other countries credentials are more closely related to competencies obtained, so school achievement is a more important determinants of prestige and income as an adult than they are in the U. S. The second cause is the zero sum nature of academic competition and resulting peer pressure against studying hard. The most important signals of one 2 ̆ 7 s achievement [...] rank in class and GPA [...] are indicators of one 2 ̆ 7 s ranking relative to close friends not measures of performance on an absolute scale in the way a scout merit badge is. Since studying hard makes things worse for friends, the <b>peer</b> <b>group</b> <b>pressures</b> everyone to take it easy. The third reason is the almost total absence of school sponsored recognition of the academic achievements of students who are not {{at the very top of}} their class. Most students learn very early that they have no realistic chance of getting one of these prizes and their reaction is often to denigrate both the reward and the achievement it honors and to honor instead other forms of achievement [...] ego athletics, being cool, being popular [...] which offer them better chances of success. The fourth reason is the admissions criteria of the nation 2 ̆ 7 s better colleges and universities. In the United States these decisions are based almost entirely on (a) scores on the Scholastic Aptitude Test, a test which does not assess achievement in the science, history and math courses taken in high school and (b) high school class rank and GPA, a criterion that generates zero sum competition among classmates. In Japan and most of Europe, admission to the better universities and into the most selective programs of study are based largely on the student 2 ̆ 7 s performance on a battery of achievement exams taken at the end of secondary school (eg. 2 ̆ 2 A 2 ̆ 2 levels in the UK and the Baccalaureate in France).
