At that moment, Smith is said to have shouted, “My God, don’t shoot!” Reid pulled the trigger, but the hammer fell on a faulty cartridge. Reid tried to shoot again as Smith jerked his rifle from Reid’s desperate grasp and quickly moved it in the direction of Reid.|$|E
25|$|The {{most modern}} method of loading and {{unloading}} a revolver is {{by means of the}} swing out cylinder. The cylinder is mounted on a pivot that is parallel to the chambers, and the cylinder swings out and down (to the left in most cases). An extractor is fitted, operated by a rod projecting {{from the front of the}} cylinder assembly. When <b>pressed,</b> <b>it</b> will push all fired rounds free simultaneously (as in top break models, the travel is designed to not completely extract longer, unfired rounds). The cylinder may then be loaded, singly or again with a speedloader, closed, and latched in place.|$|E
