5|$|Whereas mechanical, {{electrical}} and electrochemical (supercapacitor) {{properties of the}} carbon nanotubes are well established and have immediate applications, the practical use of optical properties is yet unclear. The aforementioned tunability of properties is potentially useful in optics and <b>photonics.</b> In particular, light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and photo-detectors based on a single nanotube have been produced in the lab. Their unique feature is not the efficiency, which is yet relatively low, but the narrow selectivity in the wavelength of emission and detection of light {{and the possibility of}} its fine tuning through the nanotube structure. In addition, bolometer and optoelectronic memory devices have been realised on ensembles of single-walled carbon nanotubes.|$|E

The <b>photonic</b> bandgap delay apparatus also preferably has a <b>photonic</b> band edge transmission resonance bandwidth which is at least as wide as the bandwidth of the <b>photonic</b> signal such that a uniform delay is imparted over the entire bandwidth of the <b>photonic</b> signal. The microresonator also includes a microresonator cavity, typically defined by a pair of switchable mirrors, within which the <b>photonic</b> bandgap delay apparatus is disposed. By requiring the <b>photonic</b> signal to oscillate within the microresonator cavity so as to pass through the <b>photonic</b> bandgap delay apparatus several times, the microresonator can controllably impart an adjustable delay to the <b>photonic</b> signal...|$|R

30|$|<b>Photonic</b> quantum wells (PQWs) are a {{class of}} <b>photonic</b> crystal heterostructures that possess a {{distinct}} band structure. A PQW consists of a <b>photonic</b> well imbedded between two <b>photonic</b> barriers. The barriers are <b>photonic</b> crystals with band gaps that may be regarded as potential barriers for photons, whereas the <b>photonic</b> well consists of either a uniform dielectric material or another <b>photonic</b> crystal with a different band gap {{than that of the}} barrier. Due to the <b>photonic</b> band mismatch between the well and the barrier, photons become confined within the well and occupy quantized states. This so-called <b>photonic</b> confinement effect has been observed in both theoretical [11 – 15] and experimental [16, 17] studies and is analogous to the electronic confinement effect that occurs in semiconductor quantum wells.|$|R
