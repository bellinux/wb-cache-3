5|$|In the 1923 season, {{under the}} eye of the county's coach, James Iremonger, Larwood {{concentrated}} on building his physique and on learning bowling skills. He grew a few inches in height, although he remained short for a fast bowler, and under Iremonger's regime of diet and exercise he gained weight. Besides his <b>physical</b> <b>development,</b> he learned by incessant practice various bowling arts, among them accuracy in line and length, variation of pace and grip, and deviating the ball in the air to produce swing. That year he played intermittently for the county's Second XI, and in a match against Lancashire Seconds took 8 wickets for 44 runs.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1930s the Auxois reached {{the peak of}} its <b>physical</b> <b>development.</b> It was described, like the Ardennais and the Trait du Nord, as a born plowhorse, with a neck {{naturally}} held so low that the nose almost touched the ground. It was developed entirely for traction, and its conformation allowed it to move huge weights over short distances. At the same time, it became more popular than the Nivernais, and was considered a southern representation of the Ardennais breed. Merchants visiting Burgandy horse fairs appreciated the breed, and deemed its bay coloration better able to hide dirt {{than that of the}} light gray Percheron or black Nivernais. The peak populations and usage of the Auxois and other French draft horses was short due to the advent of mechanization in the 1960s.|$|E
40|$|The UK’s Urban Development Corporation property-led {{regeneration}} of the 1980 s and 1990 s {{has been}} widely criticised for its failure to leave an employment legacy for local communities. The trust placed in the jobs from major <b>physical</b> <b>developments</b> ‘trickling down’ to neighbouring deprived communities has been proved misguided. However, despite these past failings, there still remain regeneration projects based around major <b>physical</b> <b>developments</b> that proceed without an explicit employment legacy aim. To help address this, this paper revisits the lessons from 1980 s and 1990 s property-led regeneration policy and tests these against 13 local employment interventions linked to major <b>physical</b> <b>developments</b> across England and Scotland. In assessing whether the lessons remain valid, the paper identifies the practical steps taken to maximise the local employment legacy from the 13 major <b>physical</b> <b>developments,</b> which in turn will help to inform future interventions...|$|R

50|$|In {{severe cases}} of social {{deprivation}} or exclusion, children {{may not be}} exposed to normal social experiences. Language provides {{a good example of}} the importance of periods in development. If a child has limited exposure to language before a certain age, language is difficult or impossible to obtain. Social behaviours and certain <b>physical</b> <b>developments</b> also have critical periods, often resisting rehabilitation or later exposure to proper stimuli.|$|R
5|$|Juventus {{began the}} 1998–99 {{season with a}} 2–1 defeat in the 1998 Supercoppa Italiana {{at the hands of}} Lazio, {{although}} Del Piero was able to score from a penalty. On 8 November 1998, Del Piero picked up a serious knee injury in the final minutes of a 2–2 draw with Udinese; this kept him out of action {{for the remainder of the}} season, as he managed only 2 goals. The club struggled without him, finishing the league season in a disappointing sixth place. Juventus did manage to reach the semi-finals of the UEFA Champions League that season, however, losing out to eventual Champions Manchester United. Following his serious injury, Del Piero underwent a muscle strengthening regime in order to adapt to the increasingly more physical and athletic demands of twenty-first century football, which allowed him to compensate for the loss of some of his pace and agility. Due to his dramatic weight gain and <b>physical</b> <b>development</b> during this period, as well as the club's success during the mid to late 90s, Del Piero, along with several other Juventus players and staff members, was accused of being involved in illegal performance-enhancing drug abuse; after a lengthy investigation, the club, as well as its players and staff, was eventually cleared of all doping allegations in 2005.|$|E

40|$|During {{the last}} decade agile methods have been a vast success {{in the domain of}} {{software}} development.

The paper compares two cases from industry and education where agile methods are used in <b>physical</b> product <b>development.</b> The comparison between the cases is conducted within five thematic areas, which creates an overview of the challenges that may occur when implementing agile methods.
