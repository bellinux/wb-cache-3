25|$|The company's {{first major}} project was the Linasec in 1964. It was an {{electronic}} special purpose computer, designed to justify papertape {{for use on}} automated Linotype machines. It was developed under contract to Compugraphic, who manufactured <b>phototypesetters.</b> Compugraphic retained the rights to manufacture the Linasec without royalty. They exercised these rights, effectively forcing Wang out of the market.|$|R
50|$|Since most early {{phototypesetting}} machines {{can only}} create one column of type at a time, long galleys of type were pasted onto layout boards {{in order to}} create a full page of text for magazines and newsletters. Paste-up artists played an important role in creating production art. Later <b>phototypesetters</b> have multiple column features that allow the typesetter to save paste-up time.|$|R
5000|$|Much of the {{variance}} and incoherence of early newspapers was because last minute corrections were exclusively handled by typesetters. With photographic printing process, typesetting gave way to paste-up, whereby columns of type were printed by machines (<b>phototypesetters)</b> on high-resolution film for paste-up on photographed final prints. These prints in turn were [...] "shot to negative" [...] with a large format production camera [...] - directly to steel-emulsion photographic plates.|$|R

50|$|Advances in {{electronic}} typesetting {{programs such as}} ditroff (1979), TeX (1979), and LaTeX (1981-1983) obsoleted the C/A/T <b>phototypesetter.</b> C/A/T continued to be prevalent in many UNIX based documentation shops until high quality laser printers became prevalent.|$|E
40|$|We {{introduce}} an algorithm {{for color}} halftoning using stochastic screening. This algorithm has three distinguished features: it uses clustering, it performs error diffusion and it employes an adaptive criteria {{to change the}} cluster size according to the variation of the image color values. Therefore, the method incorporates features from the traditional amplitude modulated (AM) digital halftoning methods, along with {{the advantages of the}} frequency modulated (FM) techniques, recently introduced into the raster image processors of high resolution <b>phototypesetters...</b>|$|R
5000|$|Because early {{generations of}} <b>phototypesetters</b> could not change text size and font easily, many {{composing}} rooms and print shops had special machines designed to set display type or headlines. One such {{model is the}} PhotoTypositor, manufactured by Visual Graphics Corporation, which lets the user position each letter visually and thus retain complete control over kerning. Compugraphic's model 7200 uses the [...] "strobe-through-a-filmstrip-through-a-lens" [...] technology to expose letters and characters onto a thin strip of phototypesetting paper that is then developed by a photo processor.|$|R
50|$|The major {{advancement}} {{presented by}} the phototypesetting machines over the Linotype machine hot-type machines was the elimination of metal type, an intermediate step no longer required once offset printing became the norm. This cold-type technology {{could also be used}} in office environments where hot-metal machines (the Mergenthaler Linotype, the Harris Intertype and the Monotype) could not. The use of phototypesetting grew rapidly in the 1960s when software was developed to convert marked up copy, usually typed on paper tape, to the codes that controlled the <b>phototypesetters.</b>|$|R
50|$|Bell Labs {{purchased}} a C/A/T <b>phototypesetter</b> in 1973 for their engineers who were developing the UNIX operating system. C/A/T became {{the de facto}} standard for UNIX based typesetting. The early typesetting programs on general purpose computers displaced special purpose photocomposition systems.|$|E
50|$|Graphic Systems did {{not have}} the {{marketing}} capability to dominate the phototypesetting business. Singer Manufacturing Company around 1975 acquired the rights to market the hardware, including placing the Singer C/A/T logo on the products. Singer continued to support C/A/T systems until 1979. Graphic Systems was bought by Wang Laboratories in 1978. The <b>phototypesetter</b> was then known as Wang Graphic Systems C/A/T with continued support through the 1980s.|$|E

It includes displays of the 20th-century inventions, Higonnet and Moyroud's Lumitype-Photon <b>phototypesetter</b> and the BBR system of computer typesetting.|$|E
40|$|PostScript is the {{de facto}} {{standard}} Page Description Language produced by Adobe Systems Corporation and supported as a printer interface language by many manufacturers of laser printers and <b>phototypesetters.</b> This document provides an illustrated introduction to the major features of the language, it should contain enough information to enable potential users of PostScript {{to determine how much}} effort is required to perform a task they have in mind, and for some purposes it will serve as a programmer's guide to the language. It will never replace the Adobe Systems books, but then it's nowhere near as expensive...|$|R
2500|$|In the 1970s, Knuth {{described}} {{computer science}} as [...] "a totally new field {{with no real}} identity. And the standard of available publications was not that high.

[...] After producing the third volume of his series in 1976, he expressed such frustration with the nascent state of the then newly developed electronic publishing tools (especially those that provided input to <b>phototypesetters)</b> that he took time out to work on typesetting and created the TeX and Metafont tools. By 2013, the first three volumes and part one of volume four of his series had been published.

5000|$|When {{they needed}} a more {{flexible}} language, {{a new version of}} roff called nroff (newer [...] "roff") was written, which provided the basis for all future versions. When they got a Graphic Systems CAT <b>phototypesetter,</b> Ossanna modified nroff to support multiple fonts and proportional spacing. Dubbed troff, for typesetter roff, its sophisticated output amazed the typesetter manufacturer and confused peer reviewers, who thought that manuscripts using troff had been published before. As such, the name troff is pronounced [...] rather than *.|$|E
50|$|During the mid-1970s, Joseph Ossanna, {{working at}} Bell Laboratories, wrote the troff {{typesetting}} program {{to drive a}} Wang C/A/T <b>phototypesetter</b> owned by the Labs; it was later enhanced by Brian Kernighan to support output to different equipment, such as laser printers. While its use has fallen off, it is still included {{with a number of}} Unix and Unix-like systems, and has been used to typeset a number of high-profile technical and computer books. Some versions, as well as a GNU work-alike called groff, are now open source.|$|E
50|$|C/A/T is {{a highly}} {{addressable}} <b>phototypesetter</b> with full optics control from computer-generated data. This precise control of optics and image position made the interface to computer programs reasonably simple. Data is normally transmitted to the C/A/T by paper tape. Some companies created electronic replacements for the paper tape interface to accommodate direct connection to computer systems. C/A/T has no page layout and pagination capability. It is only a high resolution printer that puts high-resolution character images onto a photographic media. Page layout {{is determined by the}} typesetting software used to generate the paper tape.|$|E
40|$|In today’s digital computers, <b>phototypesetters</b> and printers, typographic fonts {{are mainly}} given by their outline {{descriptions}}. Outline descriptions alone {{do not provide}} any information about character parts like stems, serifs, shoulders, and bowls. But, {{in order to produce}} the best looking characters at a given size on a specific printer, non-linear operations must be applied to parts of the character shape. At low-resolution, grid-fitting of character outlines is required for generating nice and regular raster characters. For this reason, grid-titting rules called hints are added to the character description. Grid-fitting rules require as parameters certain characteristic points within the shape outlines. In {{order to be able to}} detect these characteristic points in any given input font, a topological model representing the essence of the shapes found in typographic Iatin typefaces is proposed. This model includes sufficient information for matching existing non-fancy outline fonts to the model description. For automatic hint generation. a table of applicable hints is added into the topological model description. After matching a given inpu (shape to the model, hints which can be applied to the shape of the given font are taken and added to its outline description. Furthermore, a structural description of individual letter shape parts using characteristic model points can be added to the model. Such a description provides knowledge about typographic structure elements like stems, serifs and bowls...|$|R
40|$|Adobe 2 ̆ 7 s newest {{page layout}} program, InDesign, {{includes}} a 2 ̆ 2 multi-line composing engine. 2 ̆ 2 This feature has been highlighted in presentations and preliminary literature {{about the program}} by Adobe. The claim being made by Adobe is that the multi-line composing method will produce visible improvements over traditional line-by-line justification methods, such as that employed by the current most-popular page layout program, QuarkXPress. Text produced using line-by-line justification methods tends to exhibit significant variances in interword spacing from one line to the next. Text often appears too loose or too tight in parts, and visual effects such as rivers of white space running through a column are often present. A multi-line method of justification should produce markedly better results, as interword spacing should be mostly consistent throughout an entire paragraph. The idea for a multi-line justification method {{is based on the}} hand-compositor 2 ̆ 7 s practice of resetting previous lines of text when a line cannot be acceptably justified on its own. This practice became very difficult {{with the arrival of the}} Linotype in 1886 and practically impossible with the Monotype in 1887. First- and second- generation <b>phototypesetters</b> also did not allow any form of multi-line justification. Only with the arrival of typographical technology to desktop systems has it again become possible to employ a multi-line justification method. Two notable programs that were able to perform multi-line justification before the arrival of InDesign are Donald Knuth 2 ̆ 7 s page description language, _fX, and the /zz-program, developed by Peter Karow and Hermann Zapf. InDesign 2 ̆ 7 s multi-line composition engine is in fact based on TX and the /zz-program, and it employs similar algorithms. Although there have been comparisons done between TeX or the /tz-program and line-by-line justification methods, there have been no extensive comparisons between InDesign 2 ̆ 7 s multi-linecomposing engine and a program using a line-by-line justification method, such as QuarkXPress. The hypothesis of this thesis, then, is that InDesign 2 ̆ 7 s multi-line justification method will indeed produce a significant improvement over the line-by-line justification method used by QuarkXPress. This hypothesis is tested through flowing text into three templates that are designed to be representative of a book layout, a newspaper layout, and an magazine layout. Identical versions of these templates were created in both InDesign and QuarkXPress 3. 32. A challenging, yet not extraordinary text was flowed into all templates. Wordspacing and hyphenation are evaluated...|$|R
50|$|When {{the team}} got a Graphic Systems CAT <b>phototypesetter</b> for making camera-ready copy of {{professional}} articles for publication and patent applications, Ossanna wrote {{a version of}} nroff that would drive it. It was dubbed troff, for typesetter roff. So it was that in 1973 he authored {{the first version of}} troff for Unix entirely written in PDP-11 assembly language. However, two years later, Ossanna re-wrote the code in the C programming language. He had planned another rewrite which was supposed to improve its usability but this work was taken over by Brian Kernighan.|$|E
5000|$|ATF {{produced}} type disks {{with all}} their popular type faces. These disks were concentric rings of fonts on a transparent plastic material in negative form. Usually these disks contained roman, italic and bold {{versions of the same}} face. There was even a disk with the only Canadian type design at the time, called [...] "Cartier". The ATF <b>Phototypesetter</b> was sold world wide—in Canada, Germany, Italy, Denmark, France, Belgium, England, etc. In Denmark, several newspapers were produced on ATF Phototypesetters by a company named [...] "Reprodan". As technology improved, ATF failed to keep pace and eventually the line was discontinued.|$|E
50|$|Early {{electronic}} typesetting {{programs were}} designed to drive phototypesetters, most notably the Graphic Systems CAT <b>phototypesetter</b> that troff was designed to provide input for. Though such programs still exist, their output is no longer targeted at any specific form of hardware.Some companies, such as TeleTypesetting Co. created software and hardware interfaces between personal computers like the Apple II and IBM PS/2 and phototypesetting machines which provided computers equipped with it the capability to connect to phototypesetting machines.With the start of desktop publishing software, Trout Computing in California introduced VepSet, which allows Xerox Ventura Publisher {{to be used as}} a front end and wrote a Compugraphic MCS disk with typesetting codes to reproduce the page layout.|$|E
50|$|Phototypesetting is {{a method}} of setting type, {{rendered}} obsolete with {{the popularity of the}} personal computer and desktop publishing software, that uses a photographic process to generate columns of type on a scroll of photographic paper. Typesetters use a machine called a <b>phototypesetter,</b> which quickly projects light through a film negative image of an individual character in a font, through a lens that magnifies or reduces the size of the character onto photographic paper, which is collected on a spool in a light-tight canister. The photographic paper or film is then fed into a processor, a machine that pulls the paper or film strip through two or three baths of chemicals, where it emerges ready for paste-up or film make-up.|$|E
50|$|Some later phototypesetters utilize a CRT {{to project}} the image of letters onto the {{photographic}} paper. This creates a sharper image, adds some flexibility in manipulating the type, and creates the ability to offer a continuous range of point sizes by eliminating film media and lenses. The Compugraphic MCS (Modular Composition System) with the 8400 typesetter {{is an example of}} a CRT <b>phototypesetter.</b> This machine loads digital fonts into memory from an 8-inch floppy disk. Additionally, the 8400 is able to set type-in point sizes between 5- and 120-point in 1/2-point increments. It is extremely fast and was one of the first output systems (the other was also a Compugraphic machine, the 8600) that is able to create camera-ready output with a maximum width of 12 inches.|$|E
5000|$|Ossanna's troff {{was written}} in PDP-11 {{assembly}} language and produced output specifically for the CAT <b>phototypesetter.</b> He rewrote it in C, although it was now 7000 lines of uncommented code and still dependent on the CAT. As the CAT became less common, and was no longer supported by the manufacturer, {{the need to make}} it support other devices became a priority. Ossanna died before this task was completed, so Brian Kernighan took on the task of rewriting troff. The newly rewritten version produced a device-independent code which was very easy for post-processors to read and translate to the appropriate printer codes. Also, this new version of troff (often called ditroff for device independent troff) had several extensions, which included drawing functions. [...] The program's documentation defines the output format of ditroff, which is used by many modern troff clones like GNU groff.|$|E
5000|$|A venture {{was made}} into {{photocomposition}} with the ATF Hadego Typesetter. Introduced in 1958, the first model was the [...] "A". Not many were produced because the character fit left much to be desired. The most common model was the [...] "B". Character fit was improved by employing the Friden Flexowriter [...] "Justowriter" [...] escape mechanism to six units. The last and most advanced model based on the Friden mechanism was the [...] "B-8", where an eighth unit {{was added to the}} escape mechanism by means of a series of electro-mechanical relays that could add the eighth unit to some wider characters, like capital [...] "M", without changing the basic mechanical escape mechanism of the model [...] "B". The last <b>phototypesetter</b> designed and produced by ATF was the Photocomp 20, so named because of its rated speed of twenty 11-pica newspaper lines per minute. It featured four stepper motors (1) to move the film across, (2) to move the type disk, (3) to advance the film to the next line, and (4) to set the size of one unit of escapement. Type disks contained four fonts, each including 17 pi characters. Its controller was the first ATF controller utilizing integrated circuits in place of relays. Circuitry was based on Motorola DTL integrated circuits. Machine styling of the Photocomp 20 was by Richard Arbib. Only 17 machines were sold: one in Vienna Austria, and the remainder in North America.|$|E
