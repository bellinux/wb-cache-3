6000|$|His {{claim to}} affirm having been rejected, Bradlaugh next desired to swear. The ministerial whip {{reported}} that the feeling against him in the House was uncontrollable. The Speaker held a council in his library with Mr. Gladstone, the law officers, the whip, {{and two or three}} other persons of authority and sense. He told them that if Bradlaugh had in the first instance come to take the oath, he should have allowed no intervention, but that the case was altered by the claimant’s open declaration that an oath was not binding on his conscience. A hostile motion was expected when Bradlaugh came to the table to be sworn, and the Speaker suggested that it should be met by the previous question, to be moved by Mr. Gladstone. Then the whip broke in with the assurance that the usual supporters of the government could not be relied upon. The Speaker went upstairs to dress, and on his return found that they had agreed on moving another select committee. He told them that he thought this a weak course, but if the previous question would be defeated, perhaps a committee could not be helped. Bradlaugh came to the table, and the hostile motion was made. Mr. Gladstone proposed his committee, and carried it by a good majority against the motion that Bradlaugh, being without religious belief, could not take an oath. The debate was warm, and the attacks on Bradlaugh were often gross. The Speaker honourably pointed out that such attacks on an elected member whose absence was enforced by their own order, were unfair and unbecoming, but the feelings of the House were too strong for him and too strong for chivalry. The opposition turned affairs to ignoble <b>party</b> <b>account,</b> and were not ashamed in their prints and elsewhere to level the charge of “open patronage of unbelief and Malthusianism, Bradlaugh and Blasphemy,” against a government that contained Gladstone, Bright, and Selborne, three of the most conspicuously devout men to be found in all England. One expression of faith used by a leader in the attack on Bradlaugh lived in Mr. Gladstone’s memory {{to the end of his}} days. “You know, Mr. Speaker,” cried the champion of orthodox creeds, “we all of us believe in a God of some sort or another.” That a man should consent to clothe the naked human soul in this truly singular and scanty remnant of spiritual apparel, was held to be the unalterable condition of fitness for a seat in parliament and the company of decent people. Well might Mr. Gladstone point out how vast a disparagement of Christianity, and of orthodox theism also, was here involved:— ...|$|E

Master data are the products, accounts and parties for which the business transactions are completed. The root cause problem stems from business unit and product line segmentation, in which the same customer will be serviced by different product lines, with redundant data being entered about the customer (a.k.a. party in the role of customer) and account in order to process the transaction. The redundancy of party and account data is compounded in the front to back office life cycle, where the authoritative single source for the <b>party,</b> <b>account</b> and product data is needed but is often once again redundantly entered or augmented.|$|E
50|$|Prior to the 2004 presidential election, Hedges was {{involved}} in a schism within the party stemming from alleged misuse of funds and mismanagement by Earl Dodge, the party's long-time face. Notably, Hedges and others claimed that Dodge sold the party's headquarters for $119,500 in 1999 with intent to build on his own property, but that Dodge instead kept the money for himself and moved the headquarters to a tool shed. Dodge countered by saying that he placed the funds in a separate <b>party</b> <b>account,</b> and argued that Hedges and others who had put forth the allegations were simply disgruntled with their position in the party. Nevertheless, Hedges and his faction formed the Concerns of the People (Prohibition) Party to counter Dodge, and nominated Washington anti-alcohol activist and preacher Gene Amondson for President. Both Dodge and Hedges claimed their parties were the authentic Prohibition Party. The split abruptly came to an end in 2007 after Dodge's death, and the reunified party again nominated Amondson for president for the 2008 election.|$|E

40|$|Social {{media has}} given {{politicians}} another platform to perform campaigning in. This essay {{has been a}} study on the relationships between politicians, social media, communicators and their mutual work behind what is published. Has this relatively new form of media channel affected the way that politicians market themselves online? How does the work behind the social media channels look, what strategies are planned behind the representation for the party leader to stand for an entire ideology with its values? The research questions of this study: - Do the strategic work from a communicator affect what is published on the politicians personal account and the official <b>party</b> <b>account,</b> and to what extent? - How do the communicators of Swedish political representatives use social media? Do they express their communication in a personalized manner or focus mainly on the professional part of their assignment? - What are the most important aspects in communicating through social media? A personalization within political campaigning has increased during the past time, much because of the new media channels working together with the traditional media channels, leaving not much to be hidden about the person that is the representative for the ideology at hand. Personalization does not mean what the person is but what qualities that this person shows. How much personalization is presented is dependent on the political climate that is in the country at hand, but this study focuses on the Swedish political climate, where personalization has become a more important part of campaigning, whether on social media or physical campaigning. Social media can not only work as a way of presenting a party leader or the ideology but as a mobilization factor for the followers of the political accounts. This can mean information of when a political representative are to hold a press conference or present an important message in a debate, to be able to lead followers to watch the representatives in more mediums than social media. In this study it has become clear that this differs between the different social media channels, as the strategies varies to the different target groups that are followers of the accounts. An important factor that has come up from doing this study is personal branding and branding in organizations. Since it is of great value that the representatives of the ideology perform all communication through the ground values of the party, this study has shown that the work of the communicators is of the most important value, to put a strategy together that will work as a ground for all campaigning in the party, no matter physical or online. This study has brought most theoretical focus on organizational branding, personalization and mobilization. This laid the ground for the interview questions that we created as a method of finding the results that best would answer our research questions. We interviewed eight respondents from seven different parties, that were hired either as communicators or media strategists with focus on social media channels and campaigning through them. The results showed both differences and similarities from the respondents. For example opinions differed in social media and its effect on the political climate, but they did all agree on the way that a strategy needs to be performed to best get a positive result of an online campaign. The study {{came to the conclusion that}} social media can improve the democratic participation from the people who use it, as it is an interactive media that reaches many big target groups, but that it is of importance to know that it needs to be combined with traditional ways of campaigning. The communicators all told that meeting people physically is of importance to succeed online as well...|$|E
