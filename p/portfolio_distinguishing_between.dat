We isolate exogenous variation in home equity and mortgages by using differences across housing markets in house prices and housing supply elasticities as instruments. Increases in property value (holding home equity constant) reduce stockholdings, while increases in home equity wealth (holding property value constant) raise stockholdings. The stock share of liquid wealth would rise by 1 percentage point— 6 % of the mean stock share—if a household were to spend 10 % less on its house, holding fixed wealth...|$|R

40|$|This {{presentation}} {{is based on}} two papers: “A Global Perspective on External Positions” and “The External Wealth of Nations Mark II: Revised and Extended Estimates of Foreign Assets and Liabilities, 1970 – 2004 ”. The former paper highlights the increased dispersion in net external positions in recent years, particularly among industrial countries. It provides a simple accounting framework that disentangles the factors driving the accumulation of external assets and liabilities (such as trade imbalances, investment income flows, and capital gains) for major external creditors and debtors. It also examines the factors driving the foreign asset portfolio of international investors, with a special focus on the weight of U. S. liabilities {{in the rest of}} the world’s stock of external assets. Finally, it relates the empirical evidence to the current debate about the roles of portfolio balance effects and exchange rate adjustment in shaping the external adjustment process. In the latter paper, we construct estimates of external assets and liabilities for 145 countries spanning the period 1970 - 2004. We describe our estimation methods and present key features of the data, at the country and the global level. We focus in particular on trends in net and gross external positions, and on the composition of international <b>portfolios,</b> <b>distinguishing</b> <b>between</b> foreign direct investment, portfolio equity investment, official reserves, and external debt. We document the increasing importance of equity financing and the improvement in the external position for emerging markets, and the differing pace of financial integration between advanced and developing economies.

40|$|We {{examine the}} role of money, {{allowing}} for three competing environments: the New Keynesian model with separable utility and static money demand; a non-separable utility variant with habit formation; and a version with adjustment costs for holding real balances. The last two variants imply forward-looking behavior of real money balances, as it is optimal for agents to allow their forecast of future interest rates to affect current <b>portfolio</b> decisions. We <b>distinguish</b> <b>between</b> these specifications by conducting a structural econometric analysis for the U. S. and the euro area. FIML estimates confirm the forward-looking character of money demand. Using these estimates we find that, in response to preference and technology shocks, real money balances are valuable in anticipating future variations in the natural interest rate.

40|$|This study covers {{considerable}} {{ground and}} touches {{on a range}} of issues in a rigorous investigation of the intraday and end-of-day behaviour of I JK stock index and interest rate futures contracts. Firstly, the paper uses S-minute data in an initial examination of the response of the Short Sterling, Long Gilt and FTSEI 00 to the release of macroeconomic announcements (assisted with the application of GMM). Secondly, in an analysis of intraday patterns in returns and volatility a GARCII(I,I) framework is employed, so that further inferences are made robust to time-varying variance. Finally, the paper draws upon some of the latest innovations in time series econometric modeling in an attempt to identify {{the extent to which the}} Short Sterling, Long Gilt and FTSE I 00 exhibit co-movement. The study finds evidence suggesting investors and <b>portfolio</b> managers <b>distinguish</b> <b>between</b> the information content of different items of news. The results also suggest some consistency of response to news in the interest rate and stock markets. The GARCH estimation shows variance to be highly dependent on past variance and volatility. Although the three variables appear to be bound by two cointegrating relationships, the tests for lead/lag relationships and relative degrees of exogeneity produced mixed results. In sum, the results should prove intuitively appealing...|$|R
40|$|Portfolio {{analyses}} {{are carried out}} so that strategical measures for particular objects (securities, fields of business, technologies, etc.) can be proposed to management. In the case of reengineering these objects are software (sub) systems which are to undergo modernization. Portfolio analyses have their origins {{in the management of}} securities and were later also used for strategical decision-making concerning the reengineering of computer systems. Typically, a two-dimensional four-field matrix is used for graphical representation of the analysis results, which has a series of disadvantages. For this reason we have developed the iterative portfolio procedure IPA which is fundamentally different from the conventional procedure in that representation is done using tables whose axes are marked with (sub) systems and reengineering measures rather than with assessment criteria. IPA is based on our general phase model for <b>portfolio</b> analyses which <b>distinguishes</b> <b>between</b> the three phases gatheri ng, consolidation and evaluation of information. With IPA, application systems are assessed {{on the basis of their}} distance from a postulated ideal state concerning the support of business processes, their cost-benefit ratio and the hardware and software technology they use by means of a large number og weighted criteria. The assessment values are entered in the tables, prioritized and made into graphics, for which a variety of company-specific strategies can be applied...|$|R
