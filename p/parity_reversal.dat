Although passive multimode devices including waveguides, couplers, and multiplexers {{have been demonstrated}} for broadband responses in momentum or frequency domains, collective switching of multimodes remains a challenge, due to the difficulty in imposing consistent dynamics on all eigenmodes. Here we overcome this limitation by realizing digital switching of spatially random waves, based on supersymmetric pairs of multimode potentials. We reveal that supersymmetric transformations of any parity-symmetric potential derive the <b>parity</b> <b>reversal</b> of all eigenmodes, which allows the complete isolation of random waves at the 'off' state. Building blocks for binary and many-valued logics are then demonstrated for random waves: a harmonic pair for binary switching of arbitrary wavefronts and a Pöschl-Teller pair for multi-level switching which implements the fuzzy membership function.

Since a manifold with only a Lorentzian metric can be temporally orientable, this is an odd sort of necessary connection between distinct existences.

Quantum behaviour seen in previous complex systems was found to be reproduced, along with other intriguing dynamics; and, although the results of the numerical simulations quickly lose accuracy within the time frame allocated for this study, it is hoped that the qualitative behaviour of the systems observed is interesting enough to prompt more detailed and extensive analysis. 1...|$|E

40|$|Over many decades, {{the word}} "double" has {{appeared}} in various contexts, at times seemingly unrelated. Several have some relation to mathematical physics. Recently, this has become particularly strking in DFT (double field theory). Two 'doubles' that are particularly relevant are double vector bundles and Drinfel'd doubles. The original Drinfel'd double occurred in the contexts of quantum groups and of Lie bialgebras. Quoting T. Voronov: "Double Lie algebroids arose in the works on double Lie groupoids and in connection with an analog for Lie bialgebroids of the classical Drinfel'd double of Lie bialgebras [...] . Suppose (A,A^*) is a Lie bialgebroid over a base M [...] . Mackenzie and Roytenberg suggested two different constructions based on the cotangent bundles T^*A and T^*Π A, respectively. Here Π is the fibre-wise <b>parity</b> <b>reversal</b> functor. " Although the approaches of Roytenberg and of Mackenzie look very different, Voronov establishes their equivalence. We have found Roytenberg's version to be quite congenial with our attempt to interpret the gauge algebra of DFT in terms of Poisson brackets on a suitable generalized Drinfel'd double. This double of a Lie bialgebroid (A,A^*) provides a framework to describe the differentials of A and A^* {{on an equal footing}} as Hamiltonian functions on an even symplectic supermanifold. A special choice of momenta explicates the double coordinates of DFT and shows their relation to the strong constraint determining the physical fields of double field theory. Comment: 24 page...|$|E

The main use of these maps will be to enable us to further constrain the lens model for the purposes of H-o determination.

Using a model of the lensing galaxy we have back-projected both of the images to the source plane and find that they agree well. However, there are small, but significant, differences which we suggest may arise from multi-path scattering in the interstellar medium (ISM) of the lensing galaxy. We also find an exponent of the radial mass distribution of beta approximate to 1. 04, in agreement with lens modelling of published 15 -GHz VLBI data.

40|$|The {{spectrum}} of the hydrogen atom has played a central part in fundamental physics in the past 200 years. Historical examples of its significance include the wavelength measurements of absorption lines in the solar spectrum by Fraunhofer, the identification of transition lines by Balmer, Lyman et al., the empirical description of allowed wavelengths by Rydberg, the quantum model of Bohr, the capability of quantum electrodynamics to precisely predict transition frequencies, and modern measurements of the 1 S– 2 S transition by Hänsch 1 to a precision of a few parts in 1015. Recently, we have achieved the technological advances {{to allow us to}} focus on antihydrogen—the antimatter equivalent of hydrogen 2, 3, 4. The Standard Model predicts that there should have been equal amounts of matter and antimatter in the primordial Universe after the Big Bang, but today’s Universe is observed to consist almost entirely of ordinary matter. This motivates physicists to carefully study antimatter, {{to see if there is}} a small asymmetry in the laws of physics that govern the two types of matter. In particular, the CPT (charge conjugation, <b>parity</b> <b>reversal,</b> time reversal) Theorem, a cornerstone of the Standard Model, requires that hydrogen and antihydrogen have the same spectrum. Here we report the observation of the 1 S– 2 S transition in magnetically trapped atoms of antihydrogen in the ALPHA- 2 apparatus at CERN. We determine that the frequency of the transition, driven by two photons from a laser at 243 [*]nm, is consistent with that expected for hydrogen in the same environment.
