30|$|The {{toxicity}} of waterproofing sprays {{is thought to}} be due to their content of water-repellents, such as fluoropolymers and silicon polymers, or of the solvent in which they are delivered (Picard et al. 2010). Among different repelling agents, fluoropolymers have been the most studied with regard to their toxicity following inhalation (Hays and Spiller 2014). An animal study in mice demonstrated that inhalation of fluoropolymers resulted in pulmonary collapse and pneumonia, probably by counteracting the surfactant action in the alveoli of the lung, whereas mice exposed to non-fluoropolymer-containing products showed less severe injury (Yamashita and Tanaka 1995). These findings suggest that the fluoropolymer water repellents in waterproofing sprays are responsible for causing the acute respiratory illness following inhalation. The primary structural changes after inhalation of waterproofing sprays in animals include alveolar type I cell necrosis and alveolar type II cell necrosis, with resultant impairment of surfactant secretion, direct counteraction of surfactant action, alveolar atelectasis and hemorrhage (Hays and Spiller 2014). A recent study reported developing an isolated perfused rat lung model to examine the potential of surface tension-active substances in waterproofing sprays to cause pulmonary collapse (Fischer et al. 2012). Other mechanisms of the {{toxicity of}} waterproofing sprays include an indirect and complex mechanism requiring metabolic activation with or without interaction with other factors, such as solvents (e.g., n-heptane, hexane <b>and</b> <b>petroleum</b> <b>distillates)</b> <b>and</b> smoking (Hays and Spiller 2014). The mist particle size and the emission rate have also been shown to influence the toxicity of waterproofing sprays (Hays and Spiller 2014; Yamashita et al. 1997).|$|R

40|$|Experimental and {{analytical}} {{studies have been}} carried out to better understand production mechanisms of heavy oil under steam injection with propane <b>and</b> <b>petroleum</b> <b>distillate</b> as steam additives. The studies have been conducted for heavy oil from San Ardo field (12 oAPI, 2800 cp at 53. 3 oC), under current reservoir conditions. The experiments consist of injecting pure steam, steam-propane, <b>and</b> steampetroleum <b>distillate</b> into a vertical cell containing a mixture of sand, water and San Ardo oil. The injection cell (68. 58 cm long with an ID of 7. 376 cm) is placed inside a vacuum jacket, set at the reservoir temperature of 53. 3 oC. Superheated steam at 230 oC is injected at 5. 5 ml/min (cold-water equivalent) simultaneously with propane or a petroleum distillate slug. The cell outlet pressure is maintained at 260 psig. Six runs were performed, two runs using pure steam, two steam-propane runs using 5 : 100 propane:steam mass ratio, <b>and</b> two steam-petroleum <b>distillate</b> runs using 5 : 100 petroleum distillate:steam mass ratio. We develop a simplified analytical model that describes steam front advancement and oil production for the 1 D displacement experiments. The model incorporates heat and material balance, fillup time and Darcy??????s law pertaining to the injection cell. The analytical model results are compared against the experimental data to verify the validity of the model. The main results of the study are as follows. First, experimental results indicate that compared to pure steam injection, oil production was accelerated by 30 % for 5 : 100 propane:steam injection and 38 % for 5 : 100 petroleum distillate:steam injection respectively. Second, steam injectivity with steam-propane <b>and</b> steam-petroleum <b>distillate</b> increases to 1. 4 and 1. 9 times respectively, compared with pure steam injection. Third, steam front advancement and oil production data are in good agreement with results based on the new analytical model. The analytical model indicates that the oil production acceleration observed is due to oil viscosity reduction resulting from the addition of propane <b>and</b> <b>petroleum</b> <b>distillate</b> to the steam. Oil viscosity at the initial temperature with pure steam injection is 2281 cp, which is reduced to 261 cp with steam-propane injection and 227 cp with steam-petroleum distillate injection...|$|R

30|$|So {{it is very}} {{meaningful}} to characterize the nitrogen compounds and the condensed aromatics in shale oil and figure out their influence on FCC process. The Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS) has largely been used to characterize petroleum {{at the molecular level}} [11]. Since electrospray ionization (ESI) has the advantage of easy to operate and high selectivity for polar species, it has been used in characterizing polar compounds in unconventional oil, <b>petroleum</b> <b>distillates</b> <b>and</b> crude oil fractions [12, 13, 14, 15]. Chen et al. [16] have characterized the nitrogen compounds in hydro-treated and untreated shale oil by ESI FT-ICR MS and reported that the N 1 species in Fushun shale oil are probably pyridine, indole, carbazole, benzocarbazole and their derivatives. However, besides nitrogen compounds, there are a large amount of condensed aromatics in shale oil. Gas chromatography and mass spectrometry (GC–MS) is often used to characterize condensed aromatics in oil samples since they cannot be ionized [17]. To some extent, there is still little detail information about the condensed aromatics and nitrogen compounds in shale oil. And the kinds of nitrogen compounds and condensed aromatics that are easily removed by acid–base neutralization and solvent extraction need to be further figured out.|$|R
