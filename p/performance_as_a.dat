Edward's contemporaries criticised his <b>performance</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> king, noting his failures in Scotland and the oppressive regime of his later years, although 19th-century academics later argued that the growth of parliamentary institutions during his reign was a positive development for England over the longer term. Debate has continued into the 21st century as to whether Edward was a lazy and incompetent king, or simply a reluctant and ultimately unsuccessful ruler.|$|E

5|$|Gert Fröbe as Auric Goldfinger: A wealthy, psychopathic man {{obsessed with}} gold. Orson Welles was {{considered}} as Goldfinger, but his financial demands were too high; Theodore Bikel auditioned for the role, but failed.

Fröbe, who spoke little English, said his lines phonetically, but was too slow. To redub him, {{he had to}} double the speed of his performance {{to get the right}} tempo. The only time his real voice is heard is during his meeting with members of the Mafia at Auric Stud. Bond is hidden below the model of Fort Knox whilst Fröbe's natural voice can be heard above.

5|$|He {{made his}} {{debut in the}} 1990 film En Kadhal Kanmani, which was {{followed}} by a series of small-budget Tamil, Malayalam and Telugu films in the 1990s, many of which went unnoticed. However, the success of Bala's tragedy film Sethu (1999), in which Vikram appeared as a rogue turned lover, started Vikram's successful career as an actor.

His appearance as an idealistic lawyer with multiple personality disorder in Shankar's blockbuster Anniyan (2005) also won critical acclaim, as did his appearance as a superhero in Kanthaswamy (2009). Vikram's portrayal of Veeraiya, a tribal leader inspired by the Ramayana character Ravana, in Mani Ratnam's Raavanan saw him secure further accolades, as did his appearance as a mentally challenged adult with the maturity of a six-year-old boy in Deiva Thirumagal (2011). He consequently appeared in multiple get-ups as a bodybuilder and a crippled hunchback, losing up to 35 kilograms for sequences, during the making of Shankar's romantic thriller I (2015) and won rave reviews from critics for his performance. It is currently the fifth highest-grossing Tamil film of all time.|$|E
