5000|$|The NRR now {{has some}} help. Fit testing devices {{on the market}} that will verify a proper fit of an HPD (hearing {{protection}} device). The fit of a hearing protector is very important, because if the HPD is not worn properly, the NRR becomes irrelevant. Products that will verify proper fit include: 3M EARFit Validation System, FitCheck, FitCheck Solo, INTEGRAfit, SafetyMeter, and VeriPro. Fit-test systems provide a Personal Attenuation Rating (PAR) that is currently dependent upon the company that manufactures the fit-testing system. Most fit test systems provide an A-weighted PAR, {{which means that the}} attenuation can be subtracted from the A-weighted noise exposure assessment of the employee or hearing protector user.

40|$|Noise Induced Hearing Loss through {{excessive}} {{noise pollution}} {{has become an}} epidemic, being the third most common illness worldwide. Racing car drivers and flag marshals exposed to noise in the motor sport environment are potentially susceptible to excessive noise exposure above the recommended National Standard for Occupational Noise [NOHSC: 1007 (2000) ]. This study measured the exposure to noise of flag marshals and selected racing car drivers, specifically within the cockpits of cars, during motor racing events at the Wanneroo Raceway in Western Australia. The effectiveness of currently used hearing protection devices were evaluated to determine the level of attenuation offered by the protectors and the <b>protected</b> <b>exposure</b> of the drivers and flag marshals. Analytical statistics were {{used to examine the}} dose-response relationship between identified factors that can be linked to hearing loss. Results were analyzed to identify the degree of noise exposure and whether the noise exposure was above the recommended Australian Standard of 85 dB(A). Results overall suggest that the motor sport environment is one with excessive noise levels and that drivers and flag marshals are exposed to levels that require the correct selection and use of hearing protection to reduce the <b>protected</b> <b>exposure</b> to below 85 dB(A) and preferably to 75 - 80 dB(A) if practicable. These results provide an advance in knowledge concerning noise exposure levels of racing car drivers and flag marshals during car racing events and provides a base line for further research. Recommendations are made for appropriate hearing protection for flag marshals and for racing car drivers in a variety of classes...|$|E
40|$|The {{attenuation}} {{performance of}} a hearing protector is used to estimate the <b>protected</b> <b>exposure</b> level of the user. The aim {{is to reduce the}} exposed level to an acceptable value. Users should expect the attenuation to fall within a reasonable range of values around a norm. However, an analysis of extensive test data indicates that there is a negative relationship between attenuation performance and the standard deviation. This result is deduced using a variation in the method of calculating a single number rating of attenuation that is more amenable to drawing statistical inferences. As performance is typically specified {{as a function of the}} mean attenuation minus one or two standard deviations from the mean to ensure that greater than 50 % of the wearer population are well protected, the implication of increasing standard deviation with decreasing attenuation found in this study means that a significant number of users are, in fact, experiencing over-protection. These users may be disinclined to use their hearing protectors because of an increased feeling of acoustic isolation. This problem is exacerbated in areas with lower noise levels. 10 page(s...|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 119 - 130) A {{description is}} given {{of some of}} the pressures, particularly the promulgation of federal occupational noise standards, which have prompted an expanding necessity and usage of hearing protection from industrial noise. The attenuated and non-acoustical properties of hearing protectors, specifically the insert type, are discussed in detail. Further, an analysis of the methods evaluating the degree of protection afforded by intra-aural devices is presented. It is suggested that current audiometric methods of assessing insert ear protector attenuation may not necessarily indicate the actual sound reduction provided under live industrial conditions. Finally, a study was conducted in which four workers were exposed to a monitored, high-intensity industrial noise source while wearing common, specified insert hearing protectors to determine if temporary auditory fatigue would develop from a given <b>protected</b> <b>exposure.</b> Following a 48 hour rest period, the procedure was repeated. While minimal temporary threshold shifts were observed subsequent to the protected noise exposure (TTS adjusted to 2 minutes post-exposure), insufficient data were generated from the noise exposure to quantitatively ascertain that the protectors provided adequate attenuation to preclude significant temporary aural fatigue. Limitations of the study and recommendations for further research are indicated...|$|E

Introduction: Ever since {{the history of the}} world began it has been woman’s mission to make and keep the home, to prepare women for future home-keeping, to train men for battle and, later in the stage of civilization, for statesmanship. Drummond says that development of the human race may by learned by a study of the “evolution of mothers. ” The innate mother love saw the need for protection of child life from the elements and, as a result, a primitive shelter was secured, first beneath a projecting rock, followed by hollowing out of the mountain sides and the construction of caves and hovels. After general shelter was secured it was necessary for individuals to be <b>protected,</b> <b>exposure</b> sometimes being necessary in times of storm. This condition suggested personal covering in the shape of leaves, or skins of animals. Thus each step in civilization is the direct outgrowth of the mother love which exhibits itself in surrounding the child that it may grow to manhood or womanhood. The growth of woman’s education has been slow. While men were trained in war and protection, the daughters were instructed in the care of the home and all its allied industries. At the same time there was inculcated the idea that marriage was the ultimate end to be gained. In order to afford entertainment women were instructed in such accomplishments as music and dancing. With this, as an entering wedge, commenced the education of women; advancing by stages until now women may secure an education equal and in the same classes with men. With the removal of many of the home industries to the manufacturing establishments, time has been given to pursue more advanced work...|$|E
