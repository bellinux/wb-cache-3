5|$|During the 17th and 18th centuries, the Cambodian empire {{had been}} in decline and Vietnamese people {{migrated}} south into the Mekong Delta, which was had previously been Khmer territory. Furthermore, Cambodia had been periodically invaded by both Vietnam and Siam. Cambodia lurched uneasily between both poles of domination as dictated by the internal strife of her two larger neighbors. In 1796, Ang Eng, a pro-Siamese king had died, leaving Ang Chan, {{who was born in}} 1791. When Gia Long unified Vietnam, Eng was given investiture by Siam in order to hold out Vietnamese influence, but in 1803, a Cambodian mission paid tribute to Vietnam in attempt to placate Gia Long, something that became an annual routine. In 1807, Ang Chan requested formal investiture as a vassal of Gia Long. Gia Long responded by sending an ambassador bearing the book of investiture, together with a seal of gilded silver. In 1812, Ang Chan refused a request from his brother Ang Snguon to share power, leading to a rebellion. Siam sent troops to support the rebel prince, hoping to enthrone him and wrest influence from Gia Long over Cambodia. In 1813, Gia Long responded by sending a large military contingent that forced the Siamese and Ang Snguon out of Cambodia. As a result, a Vietnamese garrison was <b>permanently</b> <b>installed</b> in the citadel at Phnom Penh, the Cambodian capital. Thereafter, Siam made no attempts to regain control of Cambodia during Gia Long's rule.|$|E

25|$|In {{his first}} season as Inter head coach, Mourinho won the Supercoppa Italiana, beating Roma on penalties, and {{finished}} top of Serie A. Inter, however, were eliminated 2–0 on aggregate by Manchester United in the first knock-out round of the Champions League, and he also failed to win the Coppa Italia, being defeated 3–1 on aggregate by Sampdoria in the semi-finals. As UEFA was beginning to push the larger clubs in top leagues to play more homegrown players, Mourinho regularly played 18-year-old Italian forward Mario Balotelli and promoted academy defender Davide Santon to the first team <b>permanently,</b> <b>installing</b> an Italian contingent into a team previously composed of mostly foreign players.

2500|$|The {{area around}} Marfa {{is known as}} a {{cultural}} center for contemporary artists and artisans. In 1971, Minimalist artist Donald Judd moved to Marfa from New York City. After renting summer houses for a few years, he bought two large hangars and some smaller buildings and began to <b>permanently</b> <b>install</b> his art. While this started with his building in New York, the buildings in Marfa allowed him to install his works on a larger scale. In 1976, he bought the first of two ranches that [...] became his primary places of residence, continuing a long love affair with the desert landscape surrounding Marfa. Later, with assistance from the Dia Art Foundation in New York, Judd acquired decommissioned Fort D.A. Russell, and began transforming the fort's buildings into art spaces in 1979. Judd's vision was to house large collections of individual artists' work on permanent display, as a sort of antimuseum. Judd believed the prevailing model of a museum, where art is shown for short periods of time, does not allow the viewer an understanding of the artist or their work as they intended.|$|R
40|$|Our {{understanding}} of hydrological and chemical processes at the catchment scale {{is limited by}} our capacity to record the full breadth of the information carried by river chemistry, {{both in terms of}} sampling frequency and precision. Here, we present a proof-of-concept study of a lab in the field called the River Lab (RL), based on the idea of <b>permanently</b> <b>installing</b> a suite of laboratory instruments in the field next to a river. Housed in a small shed, this set of instruments performs analyses at a frequency of one every 40  min for major dissolved species (Na +, K +, Mg 2 +, Ca 2 +, Cl −, SO 4 2 −, NO 3 −) through continuous sampling and filtration of the river water using automated ion chromatographs. The RL was deployed in the Orgeval Critical Zone Observatory, France for over a year of continuous analyses. Results show that the RL is able to capture long-term fine chemical variations with no drift and a precision significantly better than conventionally achieved in the laboratory (up to ± 0. 5...|$|R
25|$|A {{combination}} squat/Western toilet also exists, where a seat can be flipped {{down over}} a squat toilet, and the toilet {{can be used}} essentially {{the same way as}} the Western style. This hybrid seems to be common only in rural areas for the benefit of resident foreigners. Adapters that sit on top of the Japanese toilet to convert it to a functional sit-down toilet are much more common. There are also <b>permanently</b> <b>installed</b> extensions available to convert a squat toilet into a Western-style washlet. Inversely, there also exists a conversion platform available, that allows someone who prefers a squat toilet to raise himself up to the level of a Western toilet.|$|E
25|$|Non-integrated CFLs {{have the}} ballast <b>permanently</b> <b>installed</b> in the luminaire, and usually only the {{fluorescent}} tube is changed at its end of life. Since the ballasts {{are placed in}} the light fixture, they are larger and last longer compared to the integrated ones, and they don't {{need to be replaced}} when the tube reaches its end-of-life. Non-integrated CFL housings can be both more expensive and sophisticated. They have two types of tubes: a bi-pin tube designed for conventional ballast, and a quad-pin tube designed for an electronic ballast or a conventional ballast with an external starter. A bi-pin tube contains an integrated starter, which obviates the need for external heating pins but causes incompatibility with electronic ballasts.|$|E
