5|$|At {{about this}} time, Yūnagi {{detached}} from the Japanese column and reversed direction, perhaps because she {{lost sight of the}} other Japanese ships ahead of her, or <b>perhaps</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> ordered to provide a rearguard for Mikawa's force. One minute later, Japanese lookouts sighted a warship to port. This ship was the destroyer , heavily damaged the day before and now departing Guadalcanal independently for repairs in Australia. Whether Jarvis sighted the Japanese ships is unknown, since her radios had been destroyed. Furutaka launched torpedoes at Jarvis, which all missed. The Japanese ships passed as close to Jarvis as 1,100 meters, close enough for officers on Tenryū to look down onto the destroyer's decks without seeing any of her crew moving about. If Jarvis was aware of the Japanese ships passing by, she did not respond in any noticeable way.|$|E
2500|$|Reading {{the report}} of Tamar in [...] "She sat in the gate of Enaim," [...] Rabbi Alexander taught that Tamar went {{and sat at the}} {{entrance}} of the place of Abraham, the place to which all eyes ( [...] , einaim) look. Alternatively, Rav Hanin said in the name of Rav that there is a place called Enaim, and it is the same place mentioned in [...] when it speaks of [...] "Tappuah and Enam." [...] Alternatively, Rabbi Samuel bar Nahmani taught that the place is called Enaim because Tamar gave eyes ( [...] , einaim) to her words; that is, Tamar gave convincing replies to Judah's questions. When Judah solicited her, he asked her if she was a Gentile, and she replied that she was a convert. When Judah asked her if she was a married woman, she replied that she was unmarried. When Judah asked her if perhaps her father had accepted marriage proposals on her behalf betrothals (making her forbidden to Judah), she replied that she was an orphan. When Judah asked her if <b>perhaps</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> ritually unclean (because she was a menstruant, or niddah, and thus forbidden to Judah), she replied that she was clean..|$|E
60|$|TOPPING. [Immovably] Indeed, Miss. I thought <b>perhaps</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> {{about to}} be.|$|E
60|$|She {{stood the}} whole day long {{on the roof and}} waited; <b>perhaps</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> waiting there still.|$|R
6000|$|... "Is that all? He embarrasses her by his behavior, I suppose. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> {{afraid of}} his {{allowing}} his breeding to peep out." ...|$|R
6000|$|LADY BROCKLEHURST (at once suspicious). Why impossible? (LADY MARY cannot answer, or <b>perhaps</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> too proud.) Do {{you see why}} {{it should}} be impossible, my man? ...|$|R
60|$|She evaded the reproach; <b>perhaps</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> not {{conscious}} of it. It {{was the truth}} she wanted.|$|E
60|$|Next day I {{went to see}} her, but she was up in London, {{hovering}} {{round the}} cage of her son, no doubt. I heard from her, however, some days later, thanking me for coming, and saying {{he was out of}} danger. But she made no allusion to that evening visit. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> ashamed of it. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> demented when she came, and had no remembrance thereof.|$|E
60|$|Willard did {{not appear}} to be at all impatient. He had relapsed into a brown study, during which he let Miss Sally lock up the house. Then he walked silently home with her. Miss Sally was silent too. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> repenting her confidence--or <b>perhaps</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> {{thinking}} of her false lover. There was a pathetic droop to her lips, and her black eyes were sad and dreamy.|$|E
6000|$|Smee, much impressed, {{gazed at}} the bird as the nest was borne past, but the more {{suspicious}} Starkey said, 'If <b>she</b> <b>is</b> a mother, <b>perhaps</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> hanging about here to help Peter.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I think, by {{the course}} <b>she</b> <b>is</b> laying, that the Phantom {{is off to}} Southampton. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> going to meet {{somebody}} there. Anyhow, <b>she</b> <b>is</b> {{not likely to be}} back until we have started for Cowes." ...|$|R
6000|$|Charley nodded, {{and then}} said, {{with a great}} effort, 'The Indians have burnt the estancia; {{one of the men}} has escaped and brought the news. We know nothing more. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> carried off, not killed.' ...|$|R
60|$|Miss Minerva {{passed over}} this reply without notice. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> not {{a believer in}} the humility of musicians.|$|E
60|$|She {{tried to}} meet his eyes with a {{pleasant}} frankness, and <b>perhaps</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> franker than she meant to be.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, <b>perhaps</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> punished {{enough for}} both the {{characters}} she assumed," [...] Verrian said, {{with a smile that}} was not gay.|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{would be}} a prize worth having, Bob," [...] Jim Sankey said. [...] "I wonder what she has got on board? <b>Perhaps</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> like that craft you captured, choke-full of lead and silver, from Lima." ...|$|R
6000|$|Charley nodded, {{and then}} said, {{with a great}} effort, [...] "The Indians have burned the estancia; {{one of the men}} has escaped and brought the news. We know nothing more. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> carried off, not killed." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{noticed her}} eyes <b>perhaps.</b> <b>She</b> <b>is</b> the {{stepdaughter}} of that man Chaffery--a queer character, but indisputably mediumistic. It's odd the thing should have struck you. Curiously enough I myself have fancied <b>she</b> might <b>be</b> {{something of a}} psychic--judging from her face." ...|$|R
60|$|The thought {{struck him}} that <b>perhaps</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> in urgent need {{of money and}} {{could not afford to}} go away at that hour.|$|E
60|$|Against Mrs. Bellew {{she felt}} only {{a sort of}} vague and jealous aching; and this seemed strange even to herself--but, again, <b>perhaps</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> romantic.|$|E
60|$|It {{occurred}} to me that <b>perhaps</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> afraid that she too would be taken captive and eaten, but I kept my reflection to myself.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah!" [...] she murmured, [...] "I do {{not like}} to think of heartless women. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> not so cruel, after all. To me she seems only very, very sad. Tell me, Mr. Laverick, why did she send for you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{will be a}} {{great deal}} better for you to leave her alone," [...] replied Mrs. Easterfield. [...] "If she has any answer for you she will give it when <b>she</b> <b>is</b> ready. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> trying to make up her mind, and you may spoil all by intruding {{yourself}} upon her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Women {{have their}} fancies," [...] {{answered}} Brant, slowly; [...] "perhaps {{he has taken}} hers; <b>she</b> would not <b>be</b> the first who walked that plank. Or, <b>perhaps,</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> vexed with you for not speaking out ere this; for, man, not knowing what you <b>are,</b> how can <b>she</b> read your mind?" ...|$|R
60|$|In {{a minute}} {{he was by}} her side. She was caught, and <b>perhaps</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> not {{altogether}} sorry, especially as {{she had tried to}} get away.|$|E
6000|$|... "Van Brandt?" [...] I repeated. [...] "That {{sounds like}} a Dutch name. And yet you say she spoke like an Englishwoman. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> born in England." ...|$|E
6000|$|Miss Mary {{recognized}} at {{a glance}} the dubious mother of her anonymous pupil. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> disappointed, <b>perhaps</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> only fastidious; but as she coldly invited her to enter, she half-unconsciously settled her white cuffs and collar, and gathered closer her own chaste skirts. It was, perhaps, {{for this reason that}} the embarrassed stranger, after a moment's hesitation, left her gorgeous parasol open and sticking in the dust beside the door, and then sat down at the farther end of a long bench. Her voice was husky as she began: ...|$|E
50|$|In the 14th {{century the}} Manor {{passed to the}} Wake family. Alice, wife of Ralph de Wake, was tried and sentenced to be burned {{for the murder of}} her husband. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> the {{inspiration}} for the legendary White Lady, a ghostly figure said to haunt the parish.|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{as soon as}} we {{sat down}} Irene began to rub me the wrong way. I saw her cast a look at my new knitting-bag. All the girls have always said Irene was jealous-minded and I would never believe them before. But now I feel that <b>perhaps</b> <b>she</b> <b>is.</b>|$|R
6000|$|She {{has just}} [...] "put her gown on" [...] at Girton, <b>She</b> <b>is</b> learned in Latin and Greek, But lawn tennis she plays with a skirt on That the prudish remark with a shriek. In her accents, <b>perhaps,</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> weak (Ladies ARE, one observes with a sigh), But in Algebra--THERE she's unique, But her forte's to {{evaluate}} pi.|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps," [...] {{answered}} the Mother, shaking her grey head, [...] "or <b>perhaps</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> very unhappy, and {{came here to}} die. What does it matter? She is happy now." ...|$|E
6000|$|Poor little woman, <b>perhaps</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> thirsty, {{certainly}} she was bored, for Flippard was a wit. To see 'those two' in so unlikely a {{spot was}} quite a merciful 'pick-me-up.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We rather thought," [...] said I, {{glancing at}} Richard and Ada, who entreated {{me with their}} eyes to speak, [...] "that <b>perhaps</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> a little unmindful of her home." ...|$|E
60|$|Lady Grace sighed. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>she</b> had <b>been</b> {{a trifle}} too daring! <b>She</b> <b>was</b> willing enough, at any rate, {{to let the}} subject drift away.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes. <b>She</b> <b>is</b> {{getting better}} now, and <b>she</b> <b>is</b> very sorry {{not to come}} and see you; but <b>perhaps</b> <b>she</b> may <b>be</b> able before we go away." ...|$|R
60|$|It was Susy's voice, {{struggling}} into consciousness. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>she</b> had <b>been</b> instinctively {{conscious of}} the boy's sudden fears.|$|R
