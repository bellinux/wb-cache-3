The secondary objective is to examine perceptions of investment analysts regarding the importance of information items disclosed in interim reports for investment decision-making. Employing a disclosure-index framework, <b>a</b> list <b>of</b> 113 information items that are and could be disclosed was compiled and a mail questionnaire forwarded to investment analysts to determine the importance <b>of</b> the items. <b>A</b> cross-sectional disclosure model was developed {{to examine the relationship between}} interim disclosure and companyspecific and corporate governance attributes. The primary findings show that (1) investment analysts perceive information disclosed in interim reports as important for their investment decision-making and that there exists agreement between what companies disclose and what investment analysts perceive as importance items of disclosure, and (2) there are variations in the extent of interim disclosure and that both company-specific and corporate governance variables help explain these variations. The findings indicate that the extent of interim disclosure is positively related to company size, listing status, external auditor involvement, acquisition transactions, <b>payment</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> interim <b>dividend,</b> techMARK listing, and substantial institutional investors.

40|$|In 1998, the Australian Government {{appointed}} John Ralph {{to conduct}} <b>a</b> review <b>of</b> Australian business taxation. Under its terms of reference, the Review of Business Taxation (`the Review') {{was required to}} make recommendations regarding {{the design of the}} business tax system, ongoing policy-making, drafting of legislation and the administration <b>of</b> business taxation. <b>As</b> a preliminary step, the Review released <b>a</b> number <b>of</b> discussion papers. In the first <b>of</b> these, <b>A</b> Strong Foundation, the Review set out what it considered to be an appropriate design framework for business taxation, and identified three national taxation objectives that should provide `high level guidance for the design and operation of the business tax system'. One of these objectives was optimising economic growth. In particular, the Review indicated that: An internationally competitive economy will require, and be sustained by, efficient economic use of its resources. To that end, a vital precondition for international competitiveness 'vill be to ensure that the business tax system does not influence business decisions unnecessarily. The culmination of the work of the Review was the release <b>of</b> the report, <b>A</b> Tax System Redesigned: More Certain, Equitable and Durable (`the Ralph Report'), which set out the Review's final recommendations for business tax reform. The cornerstone of the new business tax system recommended in the Ralph Report was the so-called `consolidation regime', which would permit certain corporate groups to be treated as a single entity for tax purposes. This recommendation was accepted by the Government and enacted, and, as a result, since 1 July 2002 certain corporate groups have been able to choose to be treated as a single entity for tax purposes. To what extent does this consolidation regime comply with the original design framework put forward by the Review in A Strong Foundation? In particular, does it satisfy the `vital precondition' that it `does not influence business decisions unnecessarily'? In this thesis, I consider this issue by focusing on one particular business decision that could be affected by the consolidation regime; namely, the decision by a corporate group to dispose <b>of</b> <b>a</b> subsidiary (`the subsidiary disposal decision'). I examine {{the ways in which the}} consolidation regime might influence this decision, and assess the extent to which this renders the consolidation regime liable to the charge of influencing the subsidiary disposal decision unnecessarily. I focus on four examples of where the consolidation regime could affect the subsidiary disposal decision: the <b>payment</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> pre-sale <b>dividend</b> by the subsidiary (or `target'); a presale debt reconstruction in relation to the target; some particular cost base issues; and the liability, as between group members, to pay tax under the consolidation regime. I conclude that the consolidation regime influences the subsidiary disposal decision. I then suggest that, because that influence is difficult to justify having regard to the national tax objectives set in A Strong Foundation, the consolidation regime influences the subsidiary disposal decision `unnecessarily'.

5000|$|Repatriation of {{currency}} is when foreign currency is converted {{back to the}} currency of the home country. An example would be an American converting British pounds back to U.S. dollars. Repatriation also refers to the <b>payment</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>dividend</b> by a foreign corporation to a U.S. corporation. This happens often where the foreign corporation is considered a [...] "controlled foreign corporation" [...] (CFC), which means that more than 50% of the foreign corporation is owned by U.S. shareholders. Generally, foreign direct investment in CFC's are not taxed until a dividend is paid to the controlling U.S. parent company, and is thus repatriated. The foreign direct investment income of the CFC is taxed only by the country where it is incorporated until repatriation. At that time, income {{is subject to the}} (typically higher) U.S. tax rate minus the Foreign Tax Credits.

50|$|The ESCC {{operation}} hit stormy waters {{early in}} the 20th century. The investment {{that the company had}} to commit in forming the American Thread Company (ATCO) was much larger than originally estimated and returns were slow in materialising. The value of shares in the ESCC dropped sharply. An article in The Guardian newspaper in April 1902 noted that an extraordinary general meeting of the ESCC directors and shareholders was to take place on 23 April. The purposes of the meeting were to (1) discuss the company's position in regard to its management and finances, (2) to enquire into the reasons for the loss of share value and (3) take steps to reorganise the Company Board to protect the Company from issues arising from its holding in the American Thread Company. The shareholders were concerned that a large amount of ESCC money had been placed in a reserve fund for the purpose of paying a dividend to shareholders. The problem, {{from the point of view}} of most shareholders was that the directors of the mills in the USA that had been bought out to form the ATCO had all been issued with large numbers of ATCO and ESCC shares as part of the consolidation. The effect was that share value had been diluted. Solicitors and accountants working on behalf of the shareholders stated that the use of a reserve fund for the <b>payment</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>dividend</b> could be illegal under English law. Prior to this meeting, the ESCC Board consisted of 24 directors, all of whom were directors of the individual companies that had combined to form the holding in 1897 plus several directors of American companies. To improve management efficiency the meeting decided that the Board membership should be reduced to 12 with half of this number being ordinary shareholders unconnected with either the individual ESCC enterprises or the ATCO mills. From this point onwards, neither Ralph Bagley nor Benjamin Wright sat on the ESCC Board although they continued to own substantial share holdings in the ESCC.|$|E
40|$|Since {{regime change}} in Iraq, there has been ongoing {{violence}} in the state. Iraq’s natural resources have played a significant part in this violence: they have been poorly administered, are distributed {{in such a way}} as to feed into ethnic tensions, and there has been significant corruption. The paper will advocate two moves to improve the political and economic situation in Iraq. Firstly, the paper will argue for the <b>payment</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>dividend</b> to all Iraqi citizens, funded by the rent from Iraq’s natural resources. This will help to ameliorate the ongoing violence in Iraq and the ethnic tensions there, reduce the potential for corruption in the state, and ensure that Iraq’s natural resources are used to generate a significant income for their rightful owners: Iraq’s citizens. Secondly, the paper will argue that a relatively minimal Iraqi state should be funded through a land tax drawing on Iraq’s community values: this would offer an effective way to fund government, and incentivise Iraq’s government to build up the state’s communities and economy in order to increase its tax revenue.

40|$|United States Generally Accepted Accounting Practice ("US GAAP") {{generally}} requires {{taxes to}} be measured at the rate applicable to distributed profits, while International Financial Reporting Standards ("IFRS") requires the undistributed rate to be used. This current conflict between US GAAP and IFRS has particular relevance in South Africa, which has a dual tax' system as <b>a</b> result <b>of</b> Secondary Tax on Companies ("STC") being levied when a company distributes its profits. Currently, under US GAAP, South African companies {{would be required to}} raise a liability for the tax that would become payable' on the future distribution of profits, while under IFRS, this is only recognised when the profits are distributed. The objective of the study is, therefore, to consider the timing of the recognition <b>of</b> <b>a</b> liability for STC. The literature study has indicated strong arguments for both the recognition <b>of</b> <b>a</b> inability for STC prior to the declaration <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>dividend</b> and the non-recognition <b>of</b> <b>a</b> liability for STC prior to the dec 1 aration <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>dividend.</b> The empirical study, however, concluded that the recognition of ability prior to the declaration <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>dividend</b> is not appropriate, as <b>a</b> majority <b>of</b> the respondents believe that no "past event" has occurred and therefore the definition <b>of</b> <b>a</b> liability in terms of the IASB Framework is not satisfied.
