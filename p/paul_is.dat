2500|$|Goldtops, {{the first}} Les <b>Paul</b> model, <b>were</b> {{produced}} from 1952–1957. Early 1952 Les <b>Pauls</b> <b>were</b> not issued serial numbers, {{did not have}} bound fingerboards, and are considered by some as [...] "LP Model prototypes". However, later 1952 Les <b>Pauls</b> <b>were</b> issued serial numbers and also came with bound fingerboards. Interestingly, the design scheme {{of some of these}} early models varied. For instance, some early Les <b>Pauls</b> <b>were</b> fitted with black covered P90 pickups instead of the cream-colored plastic covers that are associated with this guitar. The weight and the tonal characteristics of the Goldtop Les <b>Paul</b> <b>were</b> largely due to the mahogany and maple construction.|$|R
5000|$|In 1796 von Kalb {{began her}} {{correspondence}} with Jean Paul. The primary interest was intellectual but Jean <b>Paul</b> <b>was</b> flattered and arranged {{to travel to}} Weimar to meet her in person. Even then their letters were initially cool, although Jean <b>Paul</b> <b>was</b> said to be [...] "magnetic", and he admired not only von Kalb's eyes but also [...] "her soul". Von Kalb's letters to Jean <b>Paul</b> <b>were</b> later published, containing their entreaties of love. Jean <b>Paul</b> <b>was</b> in two minds but he decided that she was [...] "too titanic, too heroic". They did not marry as Jean Paul might have indicated.|$|R

5|$|Nevertheless, Paul retains {{elements}} of a powerful and alert patriarch. The painting is set at a curious angle, so that although <b>Paul</b> <b>is</b> positioned low in the pictorial space, the viewer still looks upwards towards him as if in respect. He is dressed in full pomp, wearing wide fur-lined sleeves (a typical Venetian device to convey status), and his cape is laid across his upper body to suggest physical presence.|$|E

50|$|St. <b>Paul’s</b> <b>is</b> one of {{the oldest}} churches in Troy; the first Episcopal {{services}} were held in 1795. In 1804 St. <b>Paul’s</b> <b>was</b> incorporated and a brick church erected. This was replaced in 1827-28 with the current structure. The exterior is a close copy of Trinity Church, New Haven, Connecticut (1813-1816), designed by the architect Ithiel Town in the Gothic revival style. Indeed, due to changes in the original, St <b>Paul's</b> <b>is</b> closer to Trinity's original appearance than Trinity itself. Today, the exterior of St <b>Paul's</b> <b>is</b> remarkably unchanged, but the interior underwent complete redesign in the 1890s. Balconies had caused structural problems, and the Rector, Dr. Edgar Enos, convinced the church to fund a complete interior renovation by the Louis Comfort Tiffany Company.|$|R

While <b>Paul</b> <b>is</b> shown as old and frail, he is given a broad chest and cunning eyes that indicate his intelligence and guile. Ottavio is presented as cold and impervious, but this was probably a device to show his strength of character and conviction. Alessandro is favoured by his positioning closest to the Pope, yet x-ray analysis reveals he had originally stood {{to the left of}} the pope and was moved, probably on request by Alessandro himself, to a position where his hand was resting on the papal throne, indicating his claim on the papacy.|$|E

Stewie rejects the idea of bringing Snuggly Jeff back to life with a child's wish, calling it bad storytelling and comparing it to a plot hole in the film Contact.|$|E
