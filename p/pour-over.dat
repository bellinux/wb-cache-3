5000|$|More recently, however, {{a number}} of jurisdictions have {{recognized}} the validity of a <b>pour-over</b> will. In the jurisdictions in the U.S. which allow a <b>pour-over</b> will, testators do not usually put all of their assets into trusts for the reasons of liquidity, convenience, or simply {{because they did not}} get around to do so before they died. A <b>pour-over</b> clause in a will gives probate property to a trustee of the testator's separate trust and must be validated either under incorporation by reference by identifying the previously existing trust which the property will be poured into, or under the doctrine of acts of independent significance by referring to some act that has significance apart from disposing of probate assets, namely, the revocable living trust (inter vivos trust). The testator's property is subject to probate until such time as the <b>pour-over</b> clause is applied, and the estate assets [...] "pour" [...] into the trust. The trust instrument must be either in existence at the time when the will with the <b>pour-over</b> clause is executed, or executed concurrently with the will to be a valid <b>pour-over</b> gift. However, the trust need not be funded inter vivos. The <b>pour-over</b> clause protects property not previously placed in a trust by pouring it into the previously established trust through the vehicle of the will.|$|E

5000|$|Six {{names have}} been given to {{sections}} of the channel. [...] The turbulent water between the first drop and the first rock island is called Waschmaschine, or Washing Machine. Where the channel narrows and drops at the pedestrian bridge is Bogenbrücke, or Arch Bridge. It has a pair of hinged water deflectors to further narrow the channel, if desired. The rock island below the bridge is called Moby Dick, after the fictional whale. At the last of the hinged deflectors, on the left wall, the right half of the channel is a <b>pour-over.</b> The wave at the <b>pour-over</b> is called Korkenzieher, or Corkscrew. The turbulent right bend in the channel between there and the road bridge is Karussell, or Carousel. Another <b>pour-over</b> wave under the bridge, on the left side, is called Torpedowalze, or Torpedo Hole. After the road bridge, the course flattens out, and racers sprint to the finish line.|$|E

5000|$|A <b>pour-over</b> will is a {{testamentary}} device {{wherein the}} writer of a will creates a trust, and decrees in the will that the property {{in his or her}} estate {{at the time of his}} or her death shall be distributed to the Trustee of the trust. Such device was always void at English common law, because it was not deemed as a binding trust, in that the testator can change the disposition of the trust at any time and therefore essentially execute changes to the will without meeting the formalities required for the change.|$|E
50|$|Third wave coffee {{aspires to}} the highest form of culinary {{appreciation}} of coffee, so that one may appreciate subtleties of flavor, varietal, and growing region - similar to other complex consumable plant-derived products such as wine, tea, and chocolate. Distinctive features of third wave coffee include direct trade coffee, high-quality beans (see specialty coffee for scale), single-origin coffee (as opposed to blends), lighter roasts, and latte art. It also includes revivals of alternative methods of coffee preparation, such as vacuum coffee and <b>pour-over</b> brewing devices such as the Chemex and Hario V60.|$|E
50|$|Brewed {{coffee is}} made by pouring hot water onto ground coffee beans, then {{allowing}} to brew. There are several methods for doing this, including using a filter, a percolator, and a French press. Terms used for the resulting coffee often reflect the method used, such as drip brewed coffee, filtered coffee, <b>pour-over</b> coffee, or simply ground coffee. Water seeps through the ground coffee, absorbing its oils and essences, solely under gravity, then passes through {{the bottom of the}} filter. The used coffee grounds are retained in the filter with the liquid falling (dripping) into a collecting vessel such as a carafe or pot.|$|E
5000|$|Although not a {{universal}} mutation, many western {{interpretations of the}} dish add tomatoes to the sauce, thinning it slightly, enriching the flavour and deepening the red colour. This is especially common with ready made <b>pour-over</b> cooking sauces, {{such as those of}} the Patak brand, {{to the point where the}} dish may be considered tomato-based. This variation may instead have a similar origin to Tikka masala. Alternatively, this variation may instead be based on the Kashmiri practice of always cooking meat and tomatoes together whenever both are available, a mixture which may then have been used with the other ingredients to create a [...] "Tomatomeat" [...] Rogan Josh whose identity was then simplified in transit. The origin may also simply be a case of corner cutting, using relatively cheaper ingredients such as processed tomatoes, which wouldn't be as easily noticed in a hot, red sauce, to bulk out an otherwise more expensive dish of lamb, spices and aromatic chilis.|$|E

50|$|The put-in at (Tiemann Shut-ins) in Millstream Gardens Conservation Area, {{marks the}} {{beginning}} of a granite gorge with the river dropping 60 feet per mile. The whitewater action picks up immediately and continues through four major drops known as Big Drop, Cat's Paw, Double Drop, and Rickety-Rack. Throughout the lower St. Francis there are numerous play-spots with surfing waves/holes found everywhere. Downstream of Rickety-Rack, a high bluff can be seen on the right where Mud Creek enters on river right. The entrance of mud creek onto the Lower St. Francis {{is a good place to}} stretch you legs and take a small hike up the creek. The creek can be floated down at really high water, but an inner-tube would probably work best. After mud creek and a slow section, Turkey Creek enters on the left at Turkey Creek Picnic Area, part of the USFS Silver Mine Recreation Area. Following this the river bends to the right and is divided briefly by a forest of willow trees. This section contains some small happy white water and slightly higher levels can produce some small surfing waves. The left rout in the Willow jungle contains a small squeeze between two rocks. After the willows the river flows into a pool formed by the Silver Mines Dam, left over from long-ago mining activity. A breach blown in the left side of the dam provides a class II - II+ rapid at normal to moderate river levels. At higher levels when the river is near or over D bridge(6 ft), a dangerous hole forms, that just keeps getting bigger as the level rises. When the river is high enough for the entire dam to be covered (8 ft), the extremely hazardous <b>pour-over</b> is best if portaged around on river-right. When at lower levels, due to the large flat rocks bordering river left and the huge eddy one river right, the Dam is a very popular spot to stop and rest/eat/play. Downstream from the dam the only remaining rapids of note are Little Drop and Fat Man’s Squeeze. At levels below 5 ft, Little Drop makes for an amazing surfing hole/wave. The river continues fairly slow until the take-out at the low-water bridge in the USFS Silver Mines Recreation Area.|$|E
