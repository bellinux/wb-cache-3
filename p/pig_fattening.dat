40|$|In {{the case}} of some {{agricultural}} investments, often net cash flow changes its sign from positive to negative, many times during the project. It causes the problem of {{internal rate of return}} calculation, which is an important indicator of economic effectiveness of investments. That is, in such situations, internal rate of return cannot be used. To solve this problem, modified rate of return is applied. This paper aimed to describe this method in detail, and to show its calculation for investments in <b>pigs</b> <b>fattening.</b> By application of modified internal rate of return it is determined that <b>pigs</b> <b>fattening,</b> under assumed conditions, is economically justified. Also, authors calculated the upper limit of discount rate (cost of capital), to which investment in <b>pigs</b> <b>fattening</b> is economically justified.

Carcasses of <b>pigs</b> <b>fattened</b> under the montanheira system were slightly heavy (98, 38 vs 96, 13 kg), with significantly higher (P> 0, 01) dressing percentage (79, 55 % vs 78, 11 %), backfat thickness (6, 09 vs 5, 34 cm), percentage of fatty cuts (32, 06 % vs 30, 44 %) and weight (21, 92 vs 19, 77 kg) and percentage of adipose tissue (51, 65 % vs 47, 71 %). Percentage of lean cuts (50, 03 % vs 49, 07 %), bone cuts (19, 53 % vs 18, 87 %), weight (14, 91 vs 13, 77 kg) and percentage of lean (36, 04 % vs 32, 54 %), lean:bone (3, 21 vs 3, 01) and lean:fat (0, 76 vs 0, 63) ratios were significantly higher in pigs fed commercial feed. The content of ether extract in lean+fat was significantly higher (63, 7 % vs 60, 41 %), in <b>pigs</b> <b>fattened</b> under the montanheira system, while the content of crude protein (7, 57 % vs 8, 41 %) was significantly higher in pigs fed commercial feed.

The modern genotypes were superior to the old ones, all genotypes achieved significantly better results within the conventional environment and there were significant interactions between genotype and environment for all criteria of growth performance and carcass quality. The interactions were mainly caused by varying differences between organic and conventional environment within genotypes, but without a shift of the ranking order within environment between genotypes.

40|$|Farmers make {{decisions}} in a planning {{environment in which}} planning information is frequently imperfect and outcomes uncertain. Efficient planning systems must therefore be dynamic in nature. However, available systems which are capable of being directly applied to individual farms on a whole farm basis {{do not reflect the}} true nature of the planning environment. This study explores the nature of these problems through developing a dynamic planning system for <b>pig</b> <b>fattening.</b> The study considers the nature of the <b>pig</b> <b>fattening</b> problem and specifies the important factors that planning models must allow for representing the realistic planning environment. The features of currently available models are reviewed leading to a statement of the improvements required. A realistic model of <b>pig</b> <b>fattening</b> is developed and possible solution algorithms are considered. As the models require detailed pig growth information a simulation model designed to predict response from alternative feeding patterns was developed. The output from this model together with the output from a model which calculates growth distributions and posterior probabilities on potential growth provide some of the input data for a stochastic multi-period linear programming model of the problem. The remainder, feed cost information, is obtained from least cost models formulated to represent the features of the dynamic planning problem. With imperfect information, planning involves continual re-planning as new observations are made. Consequently only the solution to the first period of the model is likely to be implemented. To ensure that the first period decision set is optimal it is shown that a minimum number of periods must be included in the planning model. The minimum number is referred to as the planning horizon. Methods of determining a planning horizon are reviewed and it is concluded that available methods do not provide a general method for all planning situations. A method is developed for the <b>pig</b> <b>fattening</b> problem. Finally, a number of planning experiments were carried out to demonstrate the value of the planning models and systems developed. The results indicate the potential value of applying sophisticated planning methods to individual farms and provide a means to examine the condition under which detailed individual farm dynamic planning can be worthwhile...|$|E

The FEEDAP Panel considers that, since the additive has been demonstrated to be safe for piglets at the recommended dose, this conclusion can be extended to <b>pigs</b> for <b>fattening</b> and extrapolated to minor growing porcine species. Supplementation of diets for <b>pigs</b> for <b>fattening</b> with Avemix® XG 10 at the recommended dose (4 000 XU and 900 BGU/kg) resulted in a significantly higher body weight and daily weight gain in one trial and significantly improved feed to gain ratio in two trials.

Although {{it is well known that}} the prevalence of MRSA in pig farms is high, risk factors for the presence of MRSA in herds of <b>fattening</b> <b>pigs</b> are still poorly understood. The aim of this study was to evaluate available data from previous studies on MRSA in <b>fattening</b> <b>pigs</b> in a meta-analysis to answer the question: What are the factors associated with the occurrence of MRSA in <b>fattening</b> <b>pig</b> herds?The studies on MRSA in pigs that were identified by literature research were heterogeneous with respect to the risk factors investigated and the type of herds focused on. Therefore we decided to carry out a pooling analysis on herd level rather than a typical meta-analysis. Eligible herd data were identified based on the published literature and communication with the authors. The final data set covered 400 <b>fattening</b> <b>pig</b> herds from 10 different studies and 12 risk factors. The prevalence of MRSA in the 400 <b>fattening</b> <b>pig</b> herds was 53. 5 %. Data were analyzed using generalized estimating equations (GEE). The resulting multivariate model confirmed previously identified risk factors for MRSA in pig herds (herd size and herd type). It also identified further risk factors: group treatment of <b>fattening</b> <b>pigs</b> with antimicrobial drugs (OR= 1. 79) and housing <b>fattening</b> <b>pig</b> herds on at least partially slatted floors (OR= 2. 39) compared to plain floor.

40|$|Public {{interest}} in livestock farming is increasing, as is general criticism regarding {{the welfare of}} farm animals. In this context, husbandry systems for pigs especially are perceived very negatively. Despite rising concern for animal farming, most people lack detailed knowledge of modern agricultural production processes, as well as direct contact with agriculture. With regards to public demand for transparency of production quality and animal welfare standards, farmers and farmer associations in several countries have begun installing webcams in dairy, pig and poultry farming operations. Along with informational texts, pictures from webcams are publicly {{available on the internet}} and are used as a new type of communication tool aimed at increasing the acceptance of livestock farming by providing farming-specific information. However, there are currently no existing studies quantitatively investigating the effect of webcam pictures from stables and accompanying informational texts on the broader public. In a randomized between-subject experimental design, we presented two webcam pictures from conventional pig barns (<b>pig</b> <b>fattening</b> barn and sow farrowing pen) to the broader public, along with two different informational texts (one written directly by farmers and one neutrally written by the authors). Therefore, the objective {{of this study is to}} examine 1) if the attitude towards pig farming changes after having seen the webcam pictures, 2) if different informational texts alter the evaluation of webcam pictures, 3) if there are differences in the perception of webcam pictures of a <b>pig</b> <b>fattening</b> barn and a sow farrowing pen, and 4) how people evaluate the use of webcams as a public relations tool that can be used to provide transparency. It was determined that the majority of respondents display a more negative attitude after viewing the webcam pictures and informational texts, and this is especially true for participants reading the neutrally written texts. Further, the farrowing pen is evaluated substantially more negatively than the <b>pig</b> <b>fattening</b> pen. Regarding the overall evaluation of webcams, people seem to appreciate that farmers show real pictures from their stables, although a rather low {{interest in}} the usage of webcams in agriculture can be observed. Thus, although transparency may be enhanced through the use of webcams, our findings suggest that webcams generally do not show the desired effects on the public and are likely to be unable to improve the image of pig farming by simply providing information via pictures and texts. Finally, the application of webcams as a communication tool cannot be recommended, at least not for the husbandry systems investigated within this study...|$|E

Poultry and pig farming in Slovenia needs to undertake a large survey on the emission of aerial pollutants, since monitoring on this field is incomplete. Despite this, measurements of aerial emissions such as ammonia (NH 3), nitrous oxide (N 2 O) and carbon dioxide (CO 2) were monitored from representative poultry laying hen, pig weaning and <b>pig</b> <b>fattening</b> farms in Slovenia. Animal category, different technologies, stocking density and body mass variations significantly influenced the outcome emissions. NH 3, N 2 O and CO 2 concentrations in the ambiental air directly correlate (p< 0. 05) to variable air streams in stables and mostly exceed the known data from other investigations made in EU. From the hen production the calculated predictions of annual ammonia (28. 5 kg lu- 1 a- 1) and nitrous oxide emissions (102 kg lu- 1 a- 1) were higher (p< 0. 05) than <b>pig</b> <b>fattening</b> production (NH 3 2. 5 kg lu- 1 a- 1 N 2 O 58. 3 kg lu- 1 a- 1) or pig weaning production (NH 3 6. 4 kg lu- 1 a- 1 N 2 O 67 kg lu- 1 a- 1), still the carbon dioxide emissions were estimated as 21. 5 - 59 % higher in pig (fatteners 3960 kg lu- 1 a- 1) than in poultry production.

A large proportion of VRE isolates showed resistance to tetracycline (86. 5 %), erythromycin (61. 5 %), ampicillin (53. 8 %), chloramphenicol (34. 6 %) and ciprofloxacin (32. 7 %). Resistance to ampicillin was more prevalent in E.  gallinarum isolates than in E.  casseliflavus isolates. The {{results of this study}} indicate that VRE isolates of pigs are of the VanC phenotype and commonly exhibit multiple drug resistance. Different antimicrobial susceptibility is present between VanC species, while E.  gallinarum is less susceptible than E.  casseliflavus...|$|R
5000|$|The dehesa {{is derived}} from the Mediterranean forest ecosystem, {{consisting}} of pastureland featuring herbaceous species for grazing and tree species belonging to the genus Quercus (oak), such as the holm oak (Quercus ilex sp. ballota), although other tree species such as beech and pine trees may also be present. Oaks are protected and pruned to produce acorns, which the famous black Iberian pigs feed on in the fall during the montanera. Ham produced from Iberian <b>pigs</b> <b>fattened</b> with acorns and air-dried at high elevations is known as Jamón ibérico ("presunto ibérico", or [...] "pata negra" [...] in Portuguese), and sells for premium prices, especially if only acorns have been used for fattening.|$|R
