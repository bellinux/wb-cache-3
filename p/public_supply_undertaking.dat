40|$|A process-based {{methodology}} {{was used}} to compare the vulnerability of <b>public</b> <b>supply</b> wells tapping seven study areas in four hydrologically distinct regional aquifers to volatile organic compound (VOC) contamination. This method considers (1) contributing areas and travel times of groundwater flowpaths converging at individual supply wells, (2) the oxic and/or anoxic conditions encountered along each flowpath, and (3) the combined effects of hydrodynamic dispersion and contaminant- and oxic/anoxic-specific biodegradation. Contributing areas and travel times were assessed using particle tracks generated from calibrated regional groundwater flow models. These results were then used to estimate VOC concentrations relative to an unspecified initial concentration (C/C 0) at individual <b>public</b> <b>supply</b> wells. The results show that the vulnerability of <b>public</b> <b>supply</b> wells to VOC contamination varies widely between different regional aquifers. Low-recharge rates, long travel times, and the predominantly oxic conditions characteristic of Basin and Range aquifers in the western United States leads to lower vulnerability to VOCs, particularly to petroleum hydrocarbons such as benzene and toluene. On the other hand, high recharge rates and short residence times characteristic of the glacial aquifers of the eastern United States leads to greater vulnerability to VOCs. These differences lead to distinct patterns of C/C 0 values estimated for <b>public</b> <b>supply</b> wells characteristic of each aquifer, information that can be used by resource managers to develop monitoring plans based on relative vulnerability, to locate new <b>public</b> <b>supply</b> wells, or to make land-use management decisions...|$|R

40|$|The Master thesis {{analyses}} {{the development}} of <b>public</b> services <b>supply.</b> The recognition of the main development tendencies is especially important and has direct impact on decision – making and implementation. Although {{the development of}} <b>public</b> services <b>supply</b> is influenced {{by a variety of}} factors, public administration paradigms can be defined as the basic factor that determines fundamental changes within the entire system. In order to analyse the development of public services, it is important to raise the following question: how does the change of public administration paradigms influence the change of <b>public</b> services <b>supply?</b> The following aim has been raised: to reveal the development of <b>public</b> services <b>supply</b> in the context of public administration paradigms. These objectives have been set: 1. To discuss the concept of a public service and the system of <b>public</b> services <b>supply.</b> 2. To review the change of elements in the <b>public</b> services <b>supply</b> system {{in the context of the}} main public administration paradigms. 3. To carry out an analysis of the development of <b>public</b> services <b>supply</b> in Lithuania. Part one reveals the concept of public services and reviews the change of the <b>public</b> services <b>supply</b> system elements. Part two constructs methodology and describes the analysis of the development of <b>public</b> services <b>supply</b> in Lithuania. The analysis proves that the current <b>public</b> services <b>supply</b> system displays all three public administration paradigms features. However, it can be said that the elements of the new public management paradigm are prevailing. According to the analysis carried out, the trends of the development of the <b>public</b> services <b>supply</b> system in Lithuania were discussed. It can be predicted that the features of the new public management paradigm will continue to dominate in this system, yet a more elaborate expression of the new public governance features will be seen...|$|R

This study aimed to evaluate the quality of water of <b>public</b> <b>supply</b> wells in Ribeirão Preto considering specific chemical parameters including pH, metals and nitrate. Three sampling collections were performed in 33 wells for water supply in Ribeirão Preto, in May and November 2008, and in July 2009, as well. Analyses of the metals Fe, Zn, Mn, Cr, Pb, Cu and Cd were performed using the Induced Plasma Spectroscopy technique (ICP-OES). The analyses of nitrate concentration were performed using spectrophotometric method. Regarding the metals and nitrate parameters, all samples were within the values established by the ordinance of the Ministry of Health No. 518 of 2004. Regarding pH, a small number of wells had pH below the limit of drinkable water, but values were very close to the lower limit established by the ordinance. Water of <b>public</b> <b>supply</b> wells in Ribeirão Preto are, in general, of good quality, showing no restrictions for use.

5000|$|In the United States, a USGS {{nationwide}} {{compilation of}} <b>public</b> <b>supply</b> withdrawals and deliveries indicates that in 2010 the total daily volume of nonresidential use was approximately 12,000 million gallons per day (mgd) {{and accounted for}} about 29 percent of <b>public</b> <b>supply</b> withdrawals (or 45 gallons per capita per day when divided by the estimated 268 million people who relied on public-supply water). [...] This estimate is obtained by subtracting from total <b>public</b> <b>supply</b> freshwater withdrawals (41,700 mgd) the reported domestic (residential) use (23,800 mgd) and allowing for 14 percent of unaccounted for water (because of leaks, hydrant flushing, tower maintenance, and other system losses, also called non-revenue water). The estimates of average water loss in <b>public</b> <b>supply</b> systems in the U.S. range from 12 to 16 percent. The share of CII use varies across water utilities; {{in a sample of}} 31 utilities in Texas it ranged from less than 4 percent of metered use in Lamar County WSD to 79 percent in Borger MWS, with average share of 35 percent.In order to achieve improvements in the efficiency of CII water use, it is necessary to obtain information about the existing conservation potential in different types of establishments and about specific end uses of water in each CII category. Studies of water use in the CII sector were conducted by the American Water Works Association, Pacific Institute, Colorado WaterWise Council, Conserve Florida Water Clearinghouse (CFWC), and Water Research Foundation (WRF).|$|R
