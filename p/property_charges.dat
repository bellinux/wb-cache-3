Other charges included violations of the Espionage Act, stealing U.S. government <b>property,</b> <b>charges</b> under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act and charges related to the failure to obey lawful general orders under Article 92 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice.

However, he was acquitted of kidnapping conspiracy, since the bodies of the O'Hairs were not found at the time. Karr was sentenced to two life sentences in prison in August 2000 by U.S. District Judge Sam Sparks. Waters was arrested and found guilty of kidnapping, robbery, and murder in the O'Hair case, and was sentenced to 80 years in prison; he was also ordered to pay back a total of $543,665 to the United Secularists of America and to the estates of Madalyn Murray O'Hair, Jon Garth Murray, and Robin Murray O'Hair. It is unlikely that any of these debts were paid, because Waters had no ability to earn money while in prison.

40|$|Heavy drug use, {{of either}} amphetamines or opioids in the 30 {{days prior to}} arrest, is {{associated}} with frequency of property offending. Aim: The primary objective {{of the current study}} was to examine whether the frequency of recent illicit drug use is related to higher levels of offending among police detainees in Australia. In particular, the study investigated whether the frequency of property offending escalates with offenders’ self-reported illicit drug use. Method: Data from the Australian Institute of Criminology’s Drug Use Monitoring in Australia (DUMA) program were analysed for a national cohort of 9, 453 arrestees interviewed between 2008 and 2010. Statistical analysis examined whether the number of property offences recorded at arrest was related to self-reported frequency of illicit opioid and amphetamine consumption in the 30 days prior to arrest, while controlling for other relevant drug use and demographic factors. Results: Results showed a high level of illicit drug use among police detainees. Outcomes from regression modelling revealed that heavy users of illicit opioids and amphetamines, who reported at least 16 days of use in the month prior to arrest, had significantly more <b>property</b> <b>charges</b> recorded at arrest than both less frequent (moderate) users and nonusers. Compared to non-users, heavy opioid users had 57 per cent more <b>property</b> <b>charges</b> recorded at arrest while heavy amphetamine use was associated with a 53 per cent increase in property charge counts. Higher rates of property offending were also related to younger age, being unemployed and having reported illicit use of benzodiazepines in the 30 days prior to arrest. Conclusion: These outcomes clearly demonstrate that heavy drug use, of either amphetamines or opioids in the 30 days prior to arrest, is associated with frequency of property offending. This has important implications for the treatment of drug using offenders within the criminal justice system...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Sex {{offender}} recidivism risk is {{a multifaceted}} phenomenon requiring consideration across multiple risk factor domains. The impact of treatment involvement and subsequent recidivism is given limited attention {{in comparison to}} other forensic mental health issues. The present analysis is a retrospective study of sex offenders treated at a secure facility utilizing a cognitive-behavioral program matched with an untreated correctional sample. Variables stud-ied included demographic, criminal history, offense related, and treatment progress. Recidi-vism was assessed through arrest data. Multivariate analysis suggests that recidivism is signif-icantly related to quality of treatment involvement, offender demographics, offense characteristics, and criminal history. Successfully treated offenders were {{significantly less likely to}} subsequently reoffend. Recidivists were also significantly younger, less likely married, had engaged in more victim grooming or less violent offending behavior, and had significantly more prior <b>property</b> <b>charges.</b> The authors discuss the clinical and policy implications of the interrelationship between treatment involvement and recidivism...|$|E
