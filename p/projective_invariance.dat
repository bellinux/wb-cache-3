40|$|A general affine {{connection}} {{has enough}} {{degrees of freedom}} to describe the classical gravitational and electromagnetic fields in the metric-affine formulation of gravity. The gravitational field is represented in the Lagrangian by the symmetric part of the Ricci tensor and the classical electromagnetic field can be represented by the tensor of homothetic curvature. The simplest metric-affine Lagrangian {{that depends on the}} tensor of homothetic curvature generates the Einstein-Maxwell equations for a massless vector. Metric-affine Lagrangians with matter fields depending on the connection are subject to an unphysical constraint because the symmetrized Ricci tensor is projectively invariant while matter fields are not. We show that the appearance of the tensor of homothetic curvature, which is not projectively invariant, in the Lagrangian replaces this constraint with the Maxwell equations and restores <b>projective</b> <b>invariance</b> of the total action. We also examine several constraints on the torsion tensor to show that algebraic constraints on the torsion that break <b>projective</b> <b>invariance</b> of the connection and impose <b>projective</b> <b>invariance</b> on the tensor of homothetic curvature replace the massless vector with a massive vector. We conclude that the metric-affine formulation of gravity allows for a mechanism that generates masses of vectors, as it happens for electroweak gauge bosons via spontaneous symmetry breaking.

In the past few years, the availability of efficient ARG matching algorithms and their theoretical underpinnings have greatly contributed to many successful applications of ARG representation in tackling high level vision problems. During my past three year investigation into object recognition using ARG representation, we have developed a number of novel theories and techniques in the subject area. Some are image processing techniques which help to segment and generate primitive features for building ARG representation (Chapter 2 and 4). Some are about <b>projective</b> <b>invariance</b> in ARG representations (Chapter 3 and 5). Some are about new ARG matching algorithms (Chapter 6). This thesis serves as a summary document of these theories and techniques. The most important contributions of our work to the domain of computer vision, in my opinion, are in two areas: Firstly, {{in the area of}} projective invariant ARG representation for object recognition. Here, we demonstrated for the first time, a way to systematically derive ARG representation for objects under complex projective transform by exploiting the knowledge of invariance. The methodology developed by us is a sound strategy that generates ARG representations with a number of desirable and provable properties, amongst which, the most important one is the ability to capture global transformation constraint using binary relations only. The approach significantly reduces the heuristic nature of designing relational measurements and paves the way for wider application of ARG representation in 2 D and 3 D object recognition. Secondly, in the area of ARG matching. A new mathematical framework for deterministic relaxation algorithms was developed to overcome a number of problems appeared in the existing theories and practises of efficient ARG labelling. A novel labelling algorithm was proposed based on the new theoretical framework. The algorithm has a number of desirable properties compared to existing algorithms.

40|$|This thesis makes {{contributions}} {{towards the}} solutions to two problems {{in the area of}} visual human motion analysis: human action recognition and human body pose estimation. Although there has been a substantial amount of research addressing these two problems in the past, the important issue of viewpoint invariance in the representation and recognition of poses and actions has received relatively scarce attention, and forms a key goal of this thesis. Drawing on results from 2 D <b>projective</b> <b>invariance</b> theory and 3 D mutual invariants, we present three different approaches of varying degrees of generality, for human action representation and recognition. A detailed analysis of the approaches reveals key challenges, which are circumvented by enforcing spatial and temporal coherency constraints. An extensive performance evaluation of the approaches on 2 D projections of motion capture data and manually segmented real image sequences demonstrates that in addition to viewpoint changes, the approaches are able to handle well, varying speeds of execution of actions (and hence different frame rates of the video), different subjects and minor variabilities in the spatiotemporal dynamics of the action. Next, we present a method for recovering the body-centric coordinates of key joints and parts of a canonically scaled human body, given an image of the body and the point correspondences of specific body joints in an image. This problem is difficult to solve because of body articulation and perspective effects. To make the problem tractable, previous researchers have resorted to restricting the camera model or requiring an unrealistic number of point correspondences, both of which are more restrictive than necessary. We present a solution for the general case of a perspective uncalibrated camera. Our method requires that the torso does not twist considerably, an assumption that is usually satisfied for many poses of the body. We evaluate the quantitative performance of the method on synthetic data and the qualitative performance of the method on real images taken with unknown cameras and viewpoints. Both these evaluations show the effectiveness of the method at recovering the pose of the human body...|$|E
40|$|Measuring 3 D surface {{geometry}} with {{precision and accuracy}} {{is an important part}} of many engineering and scientific tasks. 3 D Scanning techniques measure {{surface geometry}} by estimating the locations of sampled surface points. In recent years, Structured-Light 3 D scanners have gained significant popularity owing to their ability to produce highly accurate scans in real-time at a low cost. In this thesis we describe an approach for Structured-Light 3 D scanning using a digital camera and a digital projector. We utilise the projective geometric relationships between the projector and the camera to carry out both an implicit calibration of the system and to solve for 3 D structure. Our approach to geometric calibration is flexible, reliable and amenable to robust estimation. In addition, we model and account for the radiometric non-linearities in the projector such as gamma distortion. Finally, we apply a post-processing step to efficiently smooth out high-frequency surface noise while retaining the structural details. Consequently, the proposed work reduces the computational load and set-up time of a Structured-Light 3 D scanner; thereby speeding up the whole scanning process while retaining the ability to generate highly accurate results. We demonstrate the accuracy of our scanning results on real-world objects of varying degrees of surface complexity. Introduction The projective geometry for a pair of pin-hole viewing devices is completely defined by their intrinsic calibration and their relative motion or extrinsic calibration in the form of matrices. For a Euclidean reconstruction, the geometry elements represented by the calibration matrices must be parameterised and estimated in some form. The use of a projector as the ‘second viewing’ device has led to numerous approaches to model and estimate its intrinsic parameters and relative motion with respect to the camera's 3 D co-ordinate system. Proposed thesis work assimilates the benefits of projective geometry constructs such as Homography and the invariance of the cross-ratios to simplify the system calibration and the 3 D estimation processes by an implicit modeling of the projector's intrinsic parameters and its relative motion. Though linear modeling of the projective geometry between a camera-projector view-pair captures the most essential aspects of the underlying geometry, it does not accommodate system non-linearities due to radiometric distortions of a projector device. We propose an approach that uses parametric splines to model the systematic errors introduced by radiometric non-linearities and thus correct for them. For 3 D surfaces reconstructed as point-clouds, noise manifests itself as some high-frequency variations for the resulting mesh. Various pre and/or post processing techniques are proposed in the literature to model and minimize the effects of noise. We use simple bilateral filtering of the depth-map for the reconstructed surface to smoothen the surface while retaining its structural details. Modeling Projective Relations In our approach for calibrating the projective-geometric structure of a projector-camera view-pair, the frame of reference for measurements is attached to the camera. The camera is calibrated using a commonly used method. To calibrate the scanner system, one common approach is to project sinusoidal patterns onto the reference planes to generate reference phase maps. By relating the phase-information between the projector and image pixels, a dense mapping is obtained. However, this is an over-parameterisation of the calibration information. Since the reference object is a plane, we can use the projective relationships induced by a plane to implicitly calibrate the projector geometry. For the estimation of the three-dimensional structure of the imaged object, we utilise the invariance of cross-ratios along with the calibration information of two reference planes. Our formulation is also extensible to utilise more than two reference plane to compute more than one estimate of the location of an unknown surface point. Such estimates are amenable to statistical analysis which allows us to derive both the shape of an object and associate reliability scores to each estimated point location. Radiometric Correction Structured-light based 3 D scanners commonly employ phase-shifted sinusoidal patterns to solve for the correspondence problem. For scanners using projective geometry between a camera and a projector, the projector's radiometric non-linearities introduce systematic errors in establishing correspondences. Such errors manifest as visual artifacts which become pronounced when fewer phase-shifted sinusoidal patterns are used. While these artifacts can be avoided by using a large number of phase-shifts, doing so also increases the acquisition time. We propose to model and rectify such systematic errors using parametric representations. Consequently, while some existing methods retain the complete reference phase maps to account for such distortions, our approach describes the deviations using a few model parameters. The proposed approach can be used to reduce the number of phase-shifted sinusoidal patterns required for codification while suppressing systematic artifacts. Additionally, our method avoids the 1 D search steps that are needed when a complete reference phase map is used, thus reducing the computational load for 3 D estimation. The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated with reconstruction of some geometric surfaces and a cultural figurine. Filtering Noise For a structured-light 3 D scanner, various sources of noise in the environment and the devices lead to inaccuracies in estimating the codewords (phase map) for an unknown surface, during reconstruction. We examine the effects of such noise factors on our proposed methods for geometric and radiometric estimation. We present a quantitative evaluation for our proposed method by scanning the objects of known geometric properties or measures and then computing the deviations from the expected results. In addition, we evaluate the errors introduced due to inaccuracies in system calibration by computing the variance statistics from multiple estimates for the reconstructed 3 D points, where each estimate is computed using a different pair of reference planes. Finally, we discuss the efficacy of certain filtering techniques in reducing the high-frequency surface noise when applied to: (a) the images of the unknown surface at a pre-processing stage, or (b) the respective phase (or depth) map at a post-processing stage. Conclusion In this thesis, we motivate the need for a procedurally simple and computationally less demanding approach for projector calibration. We present a method that uses homographies induced by a pair of reference planes to calibrate a structured-light scanner. By using the <b>projective</b> <b>invariance</b> of the cross-ratio, we solved for the 3 D geometry of a scanned surface. We demonstrate the fact that 3 D geometric information can be derived using our approach with accuracy on the order of 0. 1 mm. Proposed method reduces the image acquisition time for calibration and the computational needs for 3 D estimation. We demonstrate an approach to effectively model radiometric distortions for the projector using cubic splines. Our approach is shown to give significant improvement over the use of complete reference phase maps and its performance is comparable to that of a sate-of-the-art method, both quantitatively as well as qualitatively. In contrast with that method, proposed method is computationally less expensive, procedurally simpler and exhibits consistent performance even at relatively higher levels of noise in phase estimation. Finally, we use a simple bilateral filtering on the depth-map for the region-of-interest. Bilateral filtering provides the best trade-off between surface smoothing and the preservation of its structural details. Our filtering approach avoids computationally expensive surface normal estimation algorithms completely while improving surface fidelity...|$|E
