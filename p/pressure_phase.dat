2500|$|In a zero {{magnetic}} field, {{there are}} two distinct superfluid phases of 3He, the A-phase and the B-phase.

50|$|A {{sound wave}} propagates through a {{material}} as a localized pressure change. Increasing {{the pressure of}} a gas or fluid increases its local temperature. The local speed of sound in a compressible material increases with temperature; as a result, the wave travels faster during the high <b>pressure</b> <b>phase</b> of the oscillation than during the lower <b>pressure</b> <b>phase.</b> This affects the wave's frequency structure; for example, in an initially plane sinusoidal wave of a single frequency, the peaks of the wave travel faster than the troughs, and the pulse becomes cumulatively more like a sawtooth wave. In other words, the wave self-distorts. In doing so, other frequency components are introduced, which can be described by the Fourier series. This phenomenon is characteristic of a non-linear system, since a linear acoustic system responds only to the driving frequency. This always occurs but the effects of geometric spreading and of absorption usually overcome the self distortion, so linear behavior usually prevails and nonlinear acoustic propagation occurs only for very large amplitudes and only near the source.|$|E

Below 13 GPa, CeBi maintains its cubic structure of the NaCl-type with a bulk modulus B 0 = 49. 6 GPa, smaller than that reported for LaBi (B 0 = 55 GPa). This anomalous lowering is attributed to a continuous increase of the cerium valence. At P = 13 GPa, CeBi undergoes a crystallographic transition.

The bulk moduli of the high <b>pressure</b> <b>phases</b> are markedly higher than that of the NaCl-type phase. The small volume change at the crystallographic transition is attributed to a decrease of the cerium valence or a lowering of the p-f mixing due to the larger cerium-bismuth distances in both high <b>pressure</b> <b>phases...</b>|$|R

50|$|The {{discharge}} {{of a bomb}} {{is characterized by the}} near-instantaneous sublimation of solids or rapid vaporization of liquids into the gas phase. The amount of explosive materials used, the concentration and identity of secondary materials incorporated into bomb design, and the location and height of bomb placement all determine the magnitude of the explosion. The gas formed displaces the surrounding medium - usually air - and causes a dramatic increase in pressure that forms a characteristic blast wave, {{often referred to as the}} leading shock wave. Physically, this wave is characterized as a non-linear, discontinuous wave front that features infinite amplitude and accompanying acoustic pressure wave that may generate a pressure as high as 100MPa in a time as short as one microsecond. This peak pressure, or blast overpressure point, generates a positive pressure during blast wave propagation and results in the dispersal of positive pressure across the blast radius. This positive <b>pressure</b> <b>phase</b> is immediately followed by a period of negative pressure relative to pre-blast conditions; this phase may also account for injuries sustained during a blast.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the influence of}} Nb on the shear-induced α → ω → β transformation taking place when processing Zr by high pressure torsion (HPT) under suitable conditions of pressure and shear. With that purpose, pure Zr and Zr- 2. 5 %Nb were processed by HPT at room temperature and at pressures ranging from 0. 25 to 6. GPa using 5 anvil turns. Nb causes a further reduction of the transition pressures, which are already lower when applying shear besides pressure. Thus, the transition pressure to the β phase is reduced at least 100 times in the Zr-Nb alloy. Alloying with Nb decreases the grain size of the transformed phases, significantly enhances their thermal stability and increases their UTS and elongation to failure. Selected post-HPT annealing treatments {{lead to the development}} of very tough, multiphase Zr and Zr-Nb with bimodal grain size distributions. The retention of the high <b>pressure</b> <b>phases</b> under ambient conditions is explained by the development of a high internal stress during processing.
