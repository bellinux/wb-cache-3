50|$|The KAF2-mount is {{the same}} as the KAF-mount except that it adds two extra power {{contacts}} to the inside of the mounting ring and transmits modulation transfer function (MTF) data through the digital seventh contact. The power contacts were originally used for <b>power</b> <b>zooming.</b> Since the introduction of the K10D digital SLR model, they are mainly used for powering Silent Drive Motor and DC motor lenses.|$|R

5000|$|Increasingly, macro {{photography}} is accomplished using compact digital cameras and small-sensor bridge cameras, {{combined with a}} high <b>powered</b> <b>zoom</b> lens and (optionally) a close-up diopter lens added {{to the front of}} the camera lens. The deep depth of field of these cameras is an advantage for macro work. [...] The high pixel density and resolving power of these cameras' sensors enable them to capture very high levels of detail at a lower reproduction ratio than is needed for film or larger DSLR sensors (often at the cost of greater image noise). Despite the fact that many of these cameras come with a [...] "macro mode" [...] which does not qualify as true macro, some photographers are using the advantages of small sensor cameras to create macro images that rival or even surpass those from DSLRs.|$|R
50|$|The Sony ILCE-QX1 is {{a mobile}} device mountable, Wi-Fi-controlled camera module {{announced}} by Sony on 3 September 2014. Part of the Sony α family, {{it has a}} 20.1 MP sensor, requires an exchangeable E-mount lens, supports <b>power</b> <b>zoom,</b> and has a pop-up flash, but no in-body image stabilisation.|$|E
50|$|The K100D Super was {{a slight}} upgrade to the K100D {{announced}} in June 2007. The upgrade included some features from the K10D, such as an improved shake reduction (SR) system, a dust removal system, and power contacts for SDM lenses, but which could not enable the <b>power</b> <b>zoom</b> function as the K10D.|$|E
5000|$|The K10D camera {{features}} the [...] "crippled" [...] KAF2 mount. Like the full-featured KAF2 mount, this has power contacts for the lens and supports <b>power</b> <b>zoom</b> and MTF information {{transferred from the}} lens to the body, but lacks the mechanical stop-down coupler necessary for full compatibility with the oldest Pentax K-mount lenses.|$|E
5000|$|In general, HDSLRs use {{the full}} imager area to capture HD video, {{though not all}} pixels (causing video {{artifacts}} to some degree). Compared with the much smaller image sensors found in the typical camcorder, the HDSLR's much larger sensor yields distinctly different image characteristics. [...] HDSLRs can achieve much shallower depth of field and superior low-light performance. However, the low ratio of active pixels (to total pixels) is more susceptible to aliasing artifacts (such as moire patterns) in scenes with particular textures, and CMOS rolling shutter {{tends to be more}} severe. Furthermore, due to the DSLR's optical construction, HDSLRs typically lack one or more video functions found on standard dedicated camcorders, such as autofocus while shooting, <b>powered</b> <b>zoom,</b> and an electronic viewfinder/preview. These and other handling limitations prevent the HDSLR from being operated as a simple point-and-shoot camcorder, instead demanding some level of planning and skill for location shooting.|$|R
5000|$|The 9xi {{used both}} the older Minolta AF lenses and the xi-series lenses. Many {{of the new}} xi lenses had a new [...] "powerzoom" [...] {{function}} where the zoom ring electronically zoomed the lens via a motor. This allowed for a few extra functions, such as auto-zoom and zooming effects while exposing; in practice, however, it was slower to use, drained camera batteries and prevented pre-xi camera bodies from accepting the lenses {{because they did not}} have the ability to <b>power</b> the <b>zoom.</b> The xi-series lenses are generally seen as a failure, and no SLR manufacturer offers power-zooming lenses today.|$|R

Therefore, it can receive wireless triggering signal from a V6 and fire itself accordingly without having to attach an external V6 to the flash. When using with Cactus V6, both <b>power</b> output and <b>zoom</b> level of the RF60 can be adjusted remotely.|$|R
50|$|The latest {{addition}} of the 18-135 series is the EF-S 18-135mm f/3.5-5.6 IS USM, announced on 17 February 2016. New features are the new Nano USM and the possibility to connect the <b>Power</b> <b>Zoom</b> Adapter PZ-E1, which allows a soft zoom for video. The lens is also available as bundle with the Canon EOS 80D, which was announced same date.|$|E
5000|$|The lens {{features}} a compact construction colloquially {{referred to as}} a [...] "pancake lens" [...] and a micromotor-driven <b>power</b> <b>zoom</b> controlled by a switch {{on the side of the}} lens. Given the lens' focal length of 16-50mm, it is generally regarded as a multipurpose lens, though underperforms in low light situations due to its slower variable minimum aperture of f/3.5-5.6.|$|E
5000|$|The lens {{has both}} manual and <b>power</b> <b>zoom</b> (via a rocker switch), useful for smooth zoom motion during videography. Focusing is quiet. The lens has Panasonic's [...] "nano surface coating" [...] for {{increased}} contrast and reduced flare. The {{front of the}} lens neither extends nor rotates, beneficial for polarized filters. The 46mm thread diameter allows sharing of filters with the Panasonic 14mm, 20mm, 25mm, 45mm, and Olympus M.Zuiko Digital ED 12mm f/2 lenses.|$|E
50|$|Due to his slowed {{perception}} of time, Zolomon's physical attributes have been heightened to superhuman levels, {{allowing him to}} effortlessly react to danger {{and be able to}} withstand punches from speedsters while sustaining no serious injuries.

50|$|These {{only have}} the stepped R-cam plus {{electrical}} contacts communicating focal length to the camera. This is only supported on the R8/R9 although the lenses are fully compatible with all R-series cameras.

5000|$|The Panasonic Lumix G X Vario PZ 14-42mm is a {{zoom lens}} in the Micro Four Thirds system. It is a [...] "standard zoom"- ranging from {{moderately}} wide to moderately tele. An unusual feature {{is that the}} lens collapses to pancake size. To do so, focus-by-wire and <b>power</b> <b>zoom</b> are manually controlled by two thumb levers, not grip rings.

50|$|The K10D {{featured}} a pentaprism viewfinder (instead of the slightly dimmer pentamirror on some previous models), full programmed, aperture and shutter priority modes, {{and a new}} Sensitivity-priority mode where the rear dial adjusts light sensitivity and the camera adjusts shutter speed and aperture to maintain correct exposure. Power contacts on the lens mount were introduced to enable Pentax's SDM (Supersonic Drive Motor) for silent focusing. The power contacts also provide the <b>power</b> <b>zoom</b> function in some FA lens that Pentax introduced in the 1990s. In addition, the K10D could write JPEGs and two versions of RAW files (PEF, and the Adobe specification DNG).|$|E
50|$|The two Flashes and Kid Flash {{fight the}} two Zooms, and Kid Flash escapes Zoom by {{vibrating}} to become intangible (the only speedster <b>power</b> <b>Zoom</b> cannot duplicate). The two Zooms grab Wally and jump aboard the treadmill. Zoom forces the Flash {{to watch their}} first fight, in which Linda miscarries their twins. He tells Professor Zoom to replay the experience, feeling that Wally {{should be forced to}} focus on his sorrow and loss. As the scene begins to rewind, Wally's uncle (and mentor) Barry Allen appears on his own cosmic treadmill after searching for Professor Zoom.|$|E
50|$|Professor <b>Zoom's</b> <b>powers</b> {{were changed}} for The New 52 reboot; {{he has the}} ability to alter time {{relative}} to himself, manipulating the speed at which it flows around him. With every step he takes, he uses time travel to control his personal timeline; he slows it down to move faster and speeds it up to move slower. He retains his pre-New 52 counterpart's age altering abilities. In the DC Rebirth relaunch, however, Thawne regains his connection to the negative Speed Force and therefore all of his original powers.|$|R
5000|$|As Wally West's {{return to}} New Earth coincided exactly with Bart's death, Inertia alleged that Bart's loss of powers {{was a direct}} {{consequence}} of Wally absorbing the newly released Speed Force. However, no further blame was put on Wally, who then avenged his protégé by freezing Inertia's body in time but leaving his mind active. Inertia was put on display in a new area of the Flash Museum, dedicated to Bart's life. In Final Crisis: Rogues Revenge, Inertia was unfrozen and continued his rampage trying to kill Bart Allen's family, but was stopped by the Flash's enemy Zoom. Zoom revealed that he wanted Inertia to become the new Kid Flash. Inertia stole <b>Zoom's</b> time manipulation <b>power,</b> leaving <b>Zoom</b> unable to even walk, and renamed himself [...] "Kid Zoom."

50|$|Zoom is {{outraged by}} this, but Kid Zoom turns on him, taking all of <b>Zoom's</b> <b>powers</b> and {{changing}} {{him back into}} Hunter Zolomon. He then proceeds to attack Libra, but the Rogues and Piper rally and attack Kid Zoom all at once, killing him. Libra then tells them that after killing two speedsters (Kid Zoom and Bart), {{they are ready to}} take on the returned Barry Allen in the name of Darkseid. The Rogues are stunned to learn of Barry's return, but turn down Libra, saying they want no part in what is sure to be Libra's defeat; as they leave, Libra shouts at them that evil will win the fight.|$|R

The station operates a news helicopter that is maintained by U.S. Helicopters Inc. of Charlotte and is branded on-air as [...] "Air 7"; it features a gyrostabilized camera system manufactured by Flir Systems International that is outfitted with a 72 <b>power</b> <b>zoom</b> lens and a motorized two power drop-in extender. WSPA's newscasts typically place at either first or second place in most timeslots; The station won a Regional News Emmy Award in 2010 for its breaking news coverage, and its 11:00 p.m. newscast was nominated that year in the [...] "Best Newscast" [...] category.|$|E
50|$|The Panasonic Lumix DMC-GH2 is {{a digital}} camera with HD video {{recording}} capability {{that is part of}} the Micro Four Thirds System. Though commonly referred to as a DSLR (digital single-lens reflex) camera, it has no mirror or optical viewfinder, but has instead both a fold-out LCD screen and a (somewhat higher resolution) electronic viewfinder. Recording is to a SDHC or SDXC flash memory card in AVCHD or M-JPEG format, giving up to high quality HD 1080P video at 24fps with up to 2 hours per take on the USA or Canadian versions (for the European version it's 30 minutes per take maximum due to a European tax on video cameras). The GH2 is also notable for offering 1080/50i and 60i (interlaced) recording modes (compatible with broadcasting) as well as 24p, though 25p and 30p are not supported. The Micro Four Thirds System (crop factor 2 when compared to 35 mm still) does not offer the extreme shallow-focus effects possible with full-frame cameras. Optical image stabilisation is available on Panasonic MFT zoom lenses, and <b>power</b> <b>zoom</b> and power focus is available on some Panasonic X series lenses.|$|E
50|$|The GF3 boasts an {{upgraded}} processor, {{so that it}} {{can focus}} much faster than predecessor GF1 and GF2 models, even though it uses the same 12MP four thirds sensor. The GF3 focus and reaction time is on par with its more expensive Panasonic Lumix DMC-G3 sibling, but the GF3 cannot match the image quality of the newer, higher resolution 16MP G3 sensor, especially under low light conditions where higher ISO (greater than 800) speeds are used. However, even though the GF3 uses the older 12MP sensor the in camera JPEG processing has been improved for better colors and better high ISO performance when compared to the GF 2 and GF1 camera bodies. The GF3 puts small size at a premium, and when paired with a pancake lens made by either Panasonic or Olympus will make a particularly attractive purse or pocketable large sensor, interchangeable lens camera. Examples of such pancake type lenses would be the Panasonic Lumix 14mm f/2.5, the Olympus 17 mm f/2.8 or the Panasonic 20mm f/1.7 pancake lenses. The newly introduced Panasonic 14-42mm f/3.5-5.6 X series <b>power</b> <b>zoom</b> lens is a very compact zoom lens which in storage mode is only slightly larger than the Panasonic 20mm pancake.|$|E
50|$|Thaddeus Thawne (aka Inertia and Kid Zoom) first {{appeared}} in Impulse #51, created by Todd DeZago and Mike Wieringo. A clone of Bart Allen, Inertia first fought Impulse. When Bart aged five years after Infinite Crisis and became the Flash, Inertia fought his genetic template again. Inertia was responsible for Allen's death; Wally West returned, taking revenge by paralyzing Inertia and installing him in the Flash Museum. In Final Crisis: Rogues' Revenge, he was used by Libra and Zoom {{to try to get}} the Rogues to join the Secret Society. Inertia stole <b>Zoom's</b> <b>powers,</b> called himself Kid Zoom and was killed by the Rogues who blamed him for making them kill Bart.|$|R
40|$|Optimizing energy {{consumption}} is paramount {{to sustain the}} growth of cellular networks. One of the approaches to reduce {{energy consumption}} is traffic dependent operation of networks. The traffic demand experienced by the network fluctuates over the duration of a day. Therefore, during the periods of low traffic, we may re-configure the network to trade the excess capacity for energy reduction. For example, we may modulate the BS transmit <b>power</b> (Cell <b>Zooming)</b> so as to maintain the desired QoS. However, determining an optimal network configuration {{is known to be}} computationally hard. Along with Cell Zooming, it is essential to also consider channel re-assignment, for, when the transmit powers of BSs are changed, the channels allocated to BSs must also be suitably changed. Considering therefore channel allocations also as state variables, the search space over which the optimization should be performed blows up, further complicating the problem. In this paper, we propose a framework to address this problem. The proposed algorithmis suitable for such large search spaces, while the framework is general enough to admit several QoS requirements and sophisticated power consumption models. The underlying mathematical formulation is also applicable in other contexts, and is of independent interest as well...|$|R
50|$|Hunter {{decided that}} Wally {{had refused to}} help because, unlike {{previous}} Flash Barry Allen, he had never experienced personal tragedy; if he became the new Zoom and brought tragedy to Wally's life, the Flash {{would be a better}} hero. With this belief as justification he attacked the Flash and his allies, creating a shockwave (by snapping his fingers) which caused West's wife Linda to miscarry their twins. After borrowing speed from the other speedsters to even the playing field (briefly allowing him to match Zoom's speed), Flash prevented his former friend from killing his wife. Wally used slight rips in time created by <b>Zoom's</b> <b>powers</b> to force Hunter into a temporal anomaly in which Hunter is comatose, continuously seeing the death of his father-in-law.|$|R

40|$|Over {{the past}} decades zoom lenses {{have become an}} {{important}} type of objective. Due {{to their ability to}} dynamically change magnification or field angle they are being used in many fields of application. Most zoom lenses consist of a number of lenses or lens groups. The magnification can be changed by axial shifting some of these lens groups with a more or less complicated moving function. However, in principle {{it should be possible to}} construct zoom lenses that do not rely on the movement of some of its components. Instead, the change in magnification is achieved by changing the optical power of at least two lenses within the system (optical <b>power</b> <b>zoom</b> - OPZ). Moreover, for broadband applications it is highly favorable to use mirrors instead of lenses due to the absence of chromatic aberrations. Based on a "Schiefspiegler" approach an all-reflective OPZ objective with a zoom power of three consisting of four mirrors has been designed. Two mirrors are assumed to have a variable radius of curvature for changing optical power. During aberration correction special consideration has been given to the reduction of field curvature, since the optical power change strongly influences field curvature for different zoom positions. The simulation shows adequate image quality for photographic applications over the whole zooming range. For the realization of such an OPZ objective deformable mirrors with a comparatively large stroke are needed. Before starting a complex development of such devices three setups with different fixed focal lengths were built to prove and evaluate the concept for digital imaging...|$|E
40|$|Adaptive optic {{technology}} has revolutionized real time correction of wavefront aberrations. Optofluidic based applied optic devices have offered {{an opportunity to}} produce flexible refractive lenses in the correction of wavefronts. Fluidic lenses have superiority relative to their solid lens counterparts in their capabilities of producing tunable optical systems, that when synchronized, can produce real time variable systems with no moving parts. We have developed optofluidic fluidic lenses for applications of applied optical devices, as well as ophthalmic optic devices. The {{first half of this}} dissertation discusses the production of fluidic lenses as optical devices. In addition, the design and testing of various fluidic systems made with these components are evaluated. We begin with the creation of spherical or defocus singlet fluidic lenses. We then produced zoom optical systems with no moving parts by synchronizing combinations of these fluidic spherical lenses. The variable <b>power</b> <b>zoom</b> system incorporates two singlet fluidic lenses that are synchronized. The coupled device has no moving parts and has produced a magnification range of 0. 1 x to 10 x or a 20 x magnification range. The chapter after fluidic zoom technology focuses on producing achromatic lens designs. We offer an analysis of a hybrid diffractive and refractive achromat that offers discrete achromatized variable focal lengths. In addition, we offer a design of a fully optofluidic based achromatic lens. By synchronizing the two membrane surfaces of the fluidic achromat we develop a design for a fluidic achromatic lens. The second half of this dissertation discusses the production of optofluidic technology in ophthalmic applications. We begin with an introduction to an optofluidic phoropter system. A fluidic phoropter is designed through the combination of a defocus lens with two cylindrical fluidic lenses that are orientated 45 ° relative to each other. Here we discuss the designs of the fluidic cylindrical lens coupled with a previously discussed defocus singlet lens. We then couple this optofluidic phoropter with relay optics and Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensing technology to produce an auto-phoropter device. The auto-phoropter system combines a refractometer designed Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor with the compact refractive fluidic lens phoropter. This combination allows for the identification and control of ophthalmic cylinder, cylinder axis, as well as refractive error. The closed loop system of the fluidic phoropter with refractometer enables for the creation of our see-through auto-phoropter system. The design and testing of several generations of transmissive see-through auto-phoropter devices are presented in this section...|$|E
40|$|Zebrafish {{have long}} been {{utilized}} to study the cellular and molecular mechanisms of development by time-lapse imaging of the living transparent embryo. Here we describe a method to mount zebrafish embryos for long-term imaging and demonstrate how to automate the capture of time-lapse images using a confocal microscope. We also describe a method to create controlled, precise damage to individual branches of peripheral sensory axons in zebrafish using the focused power of a femtosecond laser mounted on a two-photon microscope. The parameters for successful two-photon axotomy must be optimized for each microscope. We will demonstrate two-photon axotomy on both a custom built two-photon microscope and a Zeiss 510 confocal/two-photon to provide two examples. Zebrafish trigeminal sensory neurons can be visualized in a transgenic line expressing GFP driven by a sensory neuron specific promoter 1. We have adapted this zebrafish trigeminal model to directly observe sensory axon regeneration in living zebrafish embryos. Embryos are anesthetized with tricaine and positioned within a drop of agarose as it solidifies. Immobilized embryos are sealed within an imaging chamber filled with phenylthiourea (PTU) Ringers. We have found that embryos can be continuously imaged in these chambers for 12 - 48 hours. A single confocal image is then captured to determine the desired site of axotomy. The region of interest {{is located on the}} two-photon microscope by imaging the sensory axons under low, non-damaging <b>power.</b> After <b>zooming</b> in on the desired site of axotomy, the power is increased and a single scan of tha...|$|R

The Sparrow flew {{from an area}} of sagebrush along the road and perched {{in the top of}} some brush about three to four meters high. The bird appeared to be an adult. Its bill was bluish-gray, breast was white with brownish streaks and a central dark spot. It had two faint pale wingbars, whitish eye-ring, a white stripe above the eye, whitish whisker stripe, grayish brown face patch, and light brown streaks on its sides.

40|$|Optimizing {{the power}} {{distribution}} of fixed and moved lens {{groups as well}} as the motions of the latter, is typically a challenging part of the whole zoom lens optical design task. Once, the merit function is formulated to optimize an initial approach, the paraxial moving equations are solved implicitly in local optima. Hence, finding local optima becomes an ill posed problem when these equations cannot be solved uniquely for certain zoom configurations. Furthermore, an inappropriate initial power distribution can lead to large overall lengths, sensitive lens groups, small zoom ranges, induced aberrations and much more disadvantageous effects. From these reasons it appears as a logical consequence to first consider a paraxial pre-design of the zoom lens. This paper shows how first order aberrations, centering sensitivities as well as all common paraxial requirements can be formulated as a merit function for finding <b>power</b> distributions and (<b>zooming)</b> air spaces. In particular, the benefit of formulating zoom invariants as constraints in order to apply the Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP) is shown. Based on a variation approach, an optimizable characteristic is introduced for control of the uniqueness of the moving equations. Global optimization methods like e. g. Differential Evolution can be used to obtain an initial paraxial approach. This approach can be improved using the SQP or the Damped Least Squares (DLS) method. Finally, the generation of an initial real lens system is described...|$|R
