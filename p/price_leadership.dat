50|$|Firms often collude in {{an attempt}} to {{stabilize}} unstable markets, so as to reduce the risks inherent in these markets for investment and product development. There are legal restrictions on such collusion in most countries. There {{does not have to be}} a formal agreement for collusion to take place (although for the act to be illegal there must be actual communication between companies) - for example, in some industries there may be an acknowledged market leader which informally sets prices to which other producers respond, known as <b>price</b> <b>leadership.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The {{court found}} that the patent {{licenses}} did not contain any price fixing clauses, but nonetheless an understanding existed in the industry as to prices, which Hartford policed by its ability to refuse access to its patented machinery:A system of <b>price</b> <b>leadership</b> obtains in the industry based on the control that Hartford exercises over the glassware produced {{by virtue of its}} restrictive licenses and its retention of title to the machines which it licenses. A system of <b>price</b> <b>leadership</b> obtains in the industry whereby, for example, Owens publishes its price list chiefly covering narrow neck glassware; Hazel-Atlas operates as the price leader for wide mouth glassware; Ball Brothers serves as price leader for fruit jar output; and Thatcher serves as price leader for milk bottles. The record is replete with instances where some of Hartford's favored licensees complained that another company was engaged in price-cutting. The record also discloses that upon receipt of such complaints Hartford took positive action[...] [...] [...] The limited term for which the licenses were issued permitted Hartford to retain such a measure of control over its licensees that it was unnecessary to more than warn them. While there was no compulsory following of these prices, the companies were able to apply moral sanctions, with the cooperation of Hartford, which amounted to the same thing.|$|E
50|$|Tacit {{collusion}} occurs where firms undergo {{actions that}} are likely to minimize a response from another firm, e.g. avoiding the opportunity to price cut an opposition. Put another way, two firms agree to play a certain strategy without explicitly saying so. Oligopolists usually try not to engage in price cutting, excessive advertising or other forms of competition. Thus, there may be unwritten rules of collusive behavior such as <b>price</b> <b>leadership</b> (tacit collusion). A price leader will then emerge and it sets the general industry price, with other firms following suit. For example, see the case of British Salt Limited and New Cheshire Salt Works Limited.|$|E

40|$|Global {{financial}} crisis, {{triggered by}} the U. S. sub-prime mortgage crisis, is now the hot issue all over the world. The crisis has already slowed down the world economy and brought great shocks to almost every industry. For B 2 C companies all over the world, the crisis {{is more of an}} opportunity than a threat and therefore these companies should use marketing techniques to further boost their revenue and profit. In view of this situation, this thesis is dedicated to discuss the price and promotion strategies used by B 2 C companies during the crisis. Through case studies of four B 2 C companies, that is, TaoBao. com, DangDang. com, EBay. com and Amazon. com, we conclude that discount, <b>pricing</b> <b>leadership</b> and penetration <b>pricing</b> are the universal price strategies used, while they also use nearly similar promotion strategies: advertising, public relation and sales promotion. Considering the current crisis, we also think that current price and promotion strategies are insufficient in face of global financial crisis in that they are not flexible enough to adapt themselves to the changing consumer behaviors and economic surroundings. Consequently, to seek to address these problems, we here bring forward three suggestions: strengthened segment-based pricing Strategy, innovative promotion strategy and flexible marketing mix...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The main aim of {{this study}} was to create a model of tacit {{collusion}} that could be used to detect such collusion. The secondary aim was to provide suggestions on how to curb tacit collusion, given the different variables that affect it. The following variables were investigated to gauge the extent of their effect on tacit collusion: demand; firms’ costs; and, finally, the number of firms’ and buyers’ suspicions regarding collusion among firms. Given the complexity of the interactions between firms and buyers, resulting from firms and buyers attempting to follow their individual rules, an agent-based model was used in the study. Agent-based models are a relatively new way of modelling complex interactions while incorporating a multitude of variables. In this way, agent-based models have an advantage over econometric models or standard simulation models, which are incapable of handling such complexity. Results from the agent-based model were consistent with economic theory and suggested that the model was calibrated correctly. A key finding was that <b>pricing</b> <b>leadership</b> behaviour occurs between firms, but that this behaviour may differ, depending on the varying attributes of the different firms. We were able to derive patterns of each such behaviour. In doing so, it was proven, in principle, that tacit collusion can be detected, and, designing an automated system to identify it was indeed possible. M. Com...|$|R

50|$|Through Price's {{skill as}} an organiser, {{he was able}} to further the Baptist cause, not only within his own church, but {{throughout}} the Aberdare valley, by opening Sunday schools and later erecting chapels to cater for the rapidly increasing population. During the mid-century years, Price was instrumental in the formation of additional Welsh Baptist causes. In 1855, the Heolyfelin Baptist Church was formed as a branch of the Hirwaun Baptist Church. Bethel, Abernant, was opened in 1857. In 1849 121 members were transferred to form Gwawr, Aberaman (see below); in 1855, 89 were released to start a cause at Mountain Ash, and in 1862, 163 were released to strengthen Bethel, Abernant; in the same year 131 were released to form a church in Ynyslwyd; in 1865, 49 were transferred to form Gadlys Church. In total, it is estimated that 927 members were released from Calfaria to form churches {{in various parts of the}} district. As these various chapels were established, Price maintained a connection between them and the mother church at Calfaria and he established, as a result, an overarching influence over the various Baptist congregations in the valley 'and provided the basis for a wider authority within the body of nonconformity as a whole in Aberdare'. This was underpinned by decisions such as that made at the monthly meeting of the Aberdare Valley Baptists on 22 July 1878 that the individual churches be encouraged to maintain joint meetings. The close interconnection and cohesion between the different Baptist congregations in the locality, allied with <b>Price's</b> <b>leadership</b> qualities, created a powerful influence upon the social and political life of the Aberdare Valley from the late 1840s, when Price figured prominently in the Blue Books controversy (see below), until the 1868 General Election and beyond.|$|R

The reforms were economic policies introduced prominently to resolve fiscal issues mainly caused by the Great Tenpō famine, and to revisit more traditional aspects of the Japanese economy.
