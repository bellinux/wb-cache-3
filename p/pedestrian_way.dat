Most of the principal buildings were to be constructed along or within easy reach of the campus's main west-east <b>pedestrian</b> <b>way,</b> which became known as University Walk. The measure of 300 feet was chosen as it was seen to represent a 1-minute walk, and Abraham wanted to aim for a design where no two points on campus {{were more than a}} maximum 10-minutes' walk from each other.|$|E

40|$|<b>Pedestrian</b> <b>ways</b> are a {{means to}} protect {{pedestrians}} from the dangers of motor vehicles. However, due to poor arrangement, safe, comfortable and difficult to access cause <b>pedestrian</b> <b>ways</b> become less regular and segmented, causing conflict in the utilization of space. Pemuda street Corridor is a strategic commercial corridor, becoming a shopping center and economic center in Magelang City. In 2011, the road corridor development was conducted, ie the non-motorized lanes were integrated into the <b>pedestrian</b> <b>ways</b> so that it became wider. This led to conflicts in the utilization of road spaces such as misuse of pedestrian paths into motor vehicle parking areas, and road bagiantation problems that caused {{a gap in the}} number of pedestrians in the area. This study found that factors of utilization of <b>pedestrian</b> <b>ways</b> in influential commercial corridors on Jalan Pemuda are convenience, accessibility, land use and activity, safety and regional identity. The purpose of this research is to find the characteristics and factors that can influence the utilization of <b>pedestrian</b> <b>ways</b> in the appropriate commercial corridor in order to solve the problems that arise so as to maximize the utilization of <b>pedestrian</b> <b>ways</b> in the area. The method used in this study is a qualitative deductive method. The method used to find problems in the field then made the framework of research and process it quantitatively to determine the qualitative results.

He was never heard of again. He no doubt got bewildered and lost, and Fatigue delivered him over to Sleep and Sleep betrayed him to Death.

Demolition was 85 percent complete as of August 1, 2011. The demolished structure will be replaced by a double-deck, multimodal span. The top deck will carry vehicles and the lower deck will have a <b>pedestrian</b> <b>way</b> and two railroad tracks (to be added in the future). Completion is scheduled for 2013.

In 1912 the parapet on the western side was removed, providing a cantilevered <b>pedestrian</b> <b>way.</b> In 1934-5 this new section was removed; the Department of Main Roads widening the bridge in order to handle increased traffic. This modification saw the replacement of the cantilevered walk-way with an open concrete type and the straightening of the curved western face.|$|E

50|$|Among the {{artefacts}} {{found was}} an old milestone that was discarded during the rebuilding of the road in 1826. The 1811 Ordnance Survey map was used to identify the original position of the stone where it has since been re-erected. The pre-1826 road is now a <b>pedestrian</b> <b>way</b> to Gibbet Hill. Other artefacts of archaeological interest included two lime kilns found near the Thursley side of the works dating from the 18th or 19th centuries. It is probable that lime produced by the kilns came from Petersfield 25 km away {{and would have been}} used to counteract the acid nature of the soil.|$|E
50|$|The {{construction}} of the bridge was planned to relieve {{the bridge of the}} old town, linking the old marketplace (Stary Rynek) to the Theatre square. Works started in 1867, with the necessity to realize a one-span bridge that does not hinder water navigation on the river.The roadway had a width of 7.32, with a <b>pedestrian</b> <b>way,</b> based on cantilever beams. The steel bridge had two arched lattice girders, it was lit by four gas lamps standing on each side. The building was complete in 1872 under the name Kaiserbr√ºcke, referring to William I, emperor of Germany and king of Prussia.|$|E

Until the 1950s, the street ran uninterrupted through Morningside Heights from Riverside Drive to Morningside Park. In 1953, during Dwight D.

50|$|On {{the north}} side of the church is a chapel {{bordering}} on rue de la Chouette (Owl Street), a <b>pedestrian</b> <b>way.</b> A corner of a buttress of this chapel bears a sculpted bird thought to represent an owl. The ornament could possibly be the personal mark of a stonemason. It cannot be the signature of the original church's architect, as is sometimes suggested, for the chapel was built in the late 15th or early 16th century‚Äîseveral centuries after the original church. The owl became worn over the centuries because of a superstition that luck would accompany anyone who stroked the bird with their left hand while making a wish. As a result, the sculpture lacks detail.|$|E
