25|$|Most of {{what was}} written about Njegoš during his {{lifetime}} {{was the work of}} foreigners (officials, scholars or travelers). One of the earliest detailed academic analyses of Njegoš's works was published by Milan Rešetar in 1890. Following the establishment of a common South Slav state in 1918, scholars reinterpreted Njegoš in a Yugoslav light, despite some of his writings being decidedly anti-Muslim and having the potential to alienate Yugoslavia's Muslim citizens, who formed about ten <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> country's population. During the interwar period, future Nobel Prize winner Ivo Andrić wrote extensively about Njegoš and his works, and published several papers on the vladikas poetry after the war, as well. Other authors who wrote about Njegoš include Mihailo Lalić, Isidora Sekulić and Anica Savić Rebac.|$|E
25|$|A US Census in 2006 {{reported}} that the population of New Hampshire was 1,314,895. 356,897 did not declare a party affiliation. These independent voters make up 44 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>New</b> Hampshire electorate and could have voted in either the Democratic primary or the Republican Party's primary, but couldn't have voted in both. Democratic voters made up a smaller proportion. 216,005 people have registered as a Democrat. These statistics are important because in 2004, the New Hampshire independents leaned towards the Democratic side in favor of then-candidate John Kerry. Since then, New Hampshire has become more Democratic, replacing their Republican governor and state legislature with a government led by Democratic politicians. However, the people of New Hampshire are divided into several smaller regions, so the entire state as a whole wouldn't {{have been expected to}} act in a uniform manner.|$|E
25|$|The Faroe route was the airline's most lucrative, with profits 29 {{million in}} 1987. The Cabinet of the Faroe Islands wanted {{a share of}} this and in 1988 they, in {{cooperation}} with Cimber Air, established Atlantic Airways. Maersk protested and stated that as a Danair partner, Cimber could not operate a competing route. But with Cimber only purchasing 25 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> airline, the clause did not come into effect. Atlantic Airways captured roughly half the market on the route. A large portion of this was new ridership, so Maersk's annual patronage on the route only fell from 100,000 to 80,000. However, the competition {{made it impossible for}} either airline to make a profit on the route. The Cimber Air case ended in arbitration and on 27 October 1994 the Maritime and Commercial Court found that Cimber Air had acted disloyally and sentenced them to pay Maersk Air a compensation of DKK35.5 million.|$|E

25|$|According to the United States Census Bureau the city's {{poverty rate}} of 19 percent in 2004 {{had not changed}} since 2001, while in Manhattan the {{earnings}} of the top fifth of earners ($330,244 on average) were 41 times the earnings of the bottom fifth ($8,019 on average). Bronx County is the second poorest urban county in the United States, with a per capita income of $13,595 (after El Paso County, Texas); Kings County, which is coterminous with Brooklyn, has a per capita of $16,775, which {{is lower than the}} 2000 per capita income of New Orleans. In 2004, the Census' American Community Survey reported, Latinos had the highest poverty rate in the city (29 percent), compared to Blacks (21 percent), Asians (18 percent) and non-Latino Whites (11 percent). Although in 2005 Latinos made up 28 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>New</b> York City's total population, they made up 42 percent of its poverty population. The Mayor's Commission, however, was criticized by advocacy groups like the National Institute for Latino Policy, for not addressing the problem of high and persistent poverty in the Latino community, pointing to the underrepresentation of Latinos on the Commission (only 4 out of 32 commissioners are Latino) and its leadership (no Latinos).|$|E

500|$|The Way I See It was {{engineered}} by Saadiq, Gerry Brown, James Tanksley, and Brungardt, who mixed the album with Saadiq. Saadiq and Brungardt both liked to layer multiple instruments and, prior to recording, had contemplated {{techniques such as}} sampling and drum programming. However, they ultimately found live instrumentalists more dynamic and challenged themselves to reproduce older music productions and the Motown aesthetic of the 1960s. To familiarize themselves with vintage recording techniques, they studied Mark Lewisohn's 1988 book The Complete Beatles Recording Sessions, books about Motown Records, and images of the label's studio personnel, setup of instruments, and microphone placement. They also studied Motown EQs to achieve a tone they found adequate for songs' rhythm guitar parts. Saadiq {{said that he had}} to disregard [...] "about 85 to 90 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> techniques ... People used to take recording very seriously. They used to wear lab coats at Abbey Road. So I got serious with what I was trying to do, both mentally and physically." [...] Brungardt said in an interview for Mix that he abandoned the approach learned on previous records he had engineered, where [...] "they wanted it clean with no distortion.

500|$|A new {{filtration}} plant costing over $3 {{billion was}} built [...] under the park's Mosholu Golf Course and {{was completed in}} 2015. The [...] plant, which is bigger than Yankee Stadium, was built after a 1998 lawsuit by the presidential administration of Bill Clinton, which Mayor Rudy Giuliani settled {{under the condition that}} the city of New York would build the plant by 2006. The city had been studying possible sites for such a plant for more than 20 years in both the Bronx and Westchester. The plant was needed in order to cut the pollution from the Croton River's watershed, which fed about ten <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>New</b> York City water system and had been proposed for filtration for the past several decades. One of the plant's other functions would be to reduce the city's dependence on the Catskill Mountains and Delaware River watersheds, which are only minimally filtered. The filtration plant was originally supposed to cost $800 million, but experienced delays and a ballooning cost because of uproars from the local community, which required the city to propose alternate sites for such a plant. To lessen the disruption caused by the plant's construction, in 2010 the city used mitigation funds from the construction of the plant to restore the Parade Ground. The new plant allowed the city to provide greater capacity for its water system. This was especially important since the city was planning to shut off part of an aqueduct from the Delaware River in 2022 or 2023, allowing the completion of a tunnel that would bypass a leaking section of the aqueduct in Newburgh, New York.|$|E
