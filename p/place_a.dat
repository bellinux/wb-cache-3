5|$|In 1596, Johannes Kepler {{predicted}} “Between Mars and Jupiter, I <b>place</b> <b>a</b> planet” in his Mysterium Cosmographicum. While analyzing Tycho Brahe's data, Kepler {{thought that}} there was too large a gap between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter.|$|E

50|$|<b>Placing</b> <b>a</b> person {{near one}} of the poles of the axes implies that the person tends to convey clear or strong {{messages}} (of warmth, hostility, dominance or submissiveness). Conversely, <b>placing</b> <b>a</b> person at the midpoint of the agentic dimension implies the person conveys neither dominance nor submissiveness (and pulls neither dominance nor submissiveness from others). Likewise, <b>placing</b> <b>a</b> person at the midpoint of the communal dimension implies the person conveys neither warmth nor hostility (and pulls neither warmth nor hostility from others).|$|R
50|$|The {{obstruction}} to <b>placing</b> <b>a</b> PL {{structure on}} a topological manifold is the Kirby-Siebenmann class.

5|$|A {{mandatory}} order is {{an order of}} the High Court commanding a public authority to perform a public duty, while a prohibiting order operates to prevent illegal action by an authority from occurring in the first <b>place.</b> <b>A</b> quashing order, the most commonly sought prerogative order, {{has the effect of}} invalidating an ultra vires decision made by an authority. Obtaining a mandatory, prohibiting or quashing order is a two-stage process, as an applicant must be granted leave by the Court to apply for the order. The Court must find the existence of a proper public law issue and available grounds of review. Leave will be granted provided that an arguable and prima facie case of reasonable suspicion that the authority has acted in breach of administrative law rules is established.|$|E
5|$|After Passover, {{the celebration}} of Mimouna takes <b>place,</b> <b>a</b> {{tradition}} brought to Israel by the Jewish communities of North Africa. In the evening, a feast of fruit, confectionery and pastries is set out for neighbors and visitors to enjoy.

The occasion is celebrated the following day by outdoor picnics at which salads and barbecued meat feature prominently.|$|E
5|$|After an implant is placed, the {{internal}} components {{are covered with}} either a healing abutment, or a cover screw. A healing abutment passes through the mucosa, and the surrounding mucosa is adapted around it. A cover screw is {{flush with the surface}} of the dental implant, and is designed to be completely covered by mucosa. After an integration period, a second surgery is required to reflect the mucosa and <b>place</b> <b>a</b> healing abutment.|$|E

5|$|After the {{destruction}} wreaked during the succession wars between Hyrcanus II and Aristobulus II, Pompey restored {{the independence of}} Azotus, {{as he did with}} all Hellenising coastal cities (Antiquities Book 14, 4:4). A few years later, in 55 BCE, after more fighting, Roman general Gabinius helped rebuild Ashdod and several other cities left without protective walls (Antiquities Book 14, 5:2). In 30 BCE Ashdod came under the rule of King Herod, who then bequeathed it to his sister Salome (Antiquities Book 17, 8:1). By the time of the First Jewish–Roman War (66-70), {{there must have been a}} large enough Jewish presence in Ashdod for Vespasian to feel compelled to <b>place</b> <b>a</b> garrison in the city.|$|E
5|$|After {{years in}} opposition, in 1849, Paraná was {{appointed}} by the national government as president of Pernambuco Province to investigate a Liberal rebellion that had taken <b>place</b> <b>a</b> year earlier, and seek a fair trial for the rebels. Blamed by his party colleagues for the years in opposition and having lost much of his influence within his own party, Paraná accepted the post, believing he could regain his place among his peers. With the nation internally pacified, {{he was sent to}} Uruguay in 1851 to forge an alliance with that country, and with the rebel Argentine provinces of Corrientes and Entre Ríos, against the Argentine Confederation. The alliance triumphed, and the Emperor elevated Paraná to the ranks of the titled nobility.|$|E
5|$|Although Gilbert wrote {{much of the}} {{foundational}} code for Maniac Mansion, {{the majority of the}} game's events were programmed by Lucasfilm employee David Fox. Fox was between projects and planned to work on the game only for a month, but he remained with the team for six months. With Gilbert, he wrote the characters' dialog and choreographed the action. Winnick's concept art inspired him to add new elements to the game: for example, Fox allowed the player to <b>place</b> <b>a</b> hamster inside the kitchen's microwave.|$|E

5|$|An {{alternative}} mourning {{style is}} {{to wrap the}} spherical finial with black cloth and <b>place</b> <b>a</b> black ribbon, known as a , above the flag.

The Cabinet has the authority to announce the half-staffing of the national flag.|$|E
5|$|At {{least some}} wild {{bottlenose}} dolphins use tools. In Shark Bay, dolphins <b>place</b> <b>a</b> marine sponge on their rostrum, presumably {{to protect it}} when searching for food on the sandy sea bottom. This has only been observed in this bay (first in 1997), and is predominantly practiced by females. Sea otters are the only other known marine mammalian tool users. A 2005 study showed mothers most likely teach the behavior to their offspring, evincing culture (behavior learned from other species members).|$|E
5|$|At {{some point}} in the post-medieval period, the tower was {{deliberately}} damaged to put it beyond military use, a process called slighting. This probably occurred {{towards the end of the}} English Civil War, after the defeat of the Royalist forces in Kent at the Battle of Maidstone. The tower was then owned by Sir John Rayney of Wrotham <b>Place,</b> <b>a</b> Royalist, and would have been an effective lookout tower in any future conflict. There appears to have been an attempt to bring down the whole tower by damaging the stair turret at its base, possibly using gunpowder, which failed due to the spiral staircase's unusually strong design. After this the upper storey of the tower was carefully removed instead, leaving the building roofless.|$|E
