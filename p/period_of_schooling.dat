40|$|In {{the eighties}} and nineties of the {{previous}} century researchers started to investigate {{the characteristics of the}} pupils from different sociometric groups. However, such studies were seldom performed with adolescents and also did not include different age groups of pupils. The purpose of the present research was to explore the factors of pupils&# 39; social acceptance in three different <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> <b>schooling</b> &# 8211; in late childhood, middle adolescence, and late adolescence. Pupils (N = 1159) from 49 classrooms of elementary and secondary schools participated in the study. Academic and nonacademiccharacteristics were included as potential factors of social acceptance. To assess different factors validly, three various sources of information were used: peer report, teachers&# 39; report, and self-report. The characteristics of pupils that proved to be the factors of social acceptance in all <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> <b>schooling</b> are: peer perceived kindness, prosocial behaviour, impulsiveness, audacity, popularity, and the number of friendships. Academic behaviour was a significant factor of social acceptance in four-grade pupils and, to a smaller extent, also in older pupils. In all three <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> <b>schooling</b> the differences between pupils of different sociometric groups were the weakest for the measures of self-report...|$|R

60|$|Very {{different}} was {{the aspect}} of the house from the wild Irish cabin appearance that {{it had in the}} M'Carthy days. It was the remains of an old farm-house that had seen better days, somewhat larger than the general run of the Cocksmoor dwellings. Respectable furniture had taken up its abode against the walls, the kitchen was well arranged, and, in spite of the wretched flooring and broken windows, had an air of comfort. A very tidy woman was bustling about, still {{trying to get rid of}} the relics of her former tenants, who might, she much feared, have left a legacy of typhus fever. The more interesting person was, however, a young woman of three or four and twenty, pale, and very lame, and with the air of a respectable servant, her manners particularly pleasing. It appeared that she was the daughter of a first wife, and, after the <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>schooling,</b> had been at service, but had been lamed by a fall downstairs, and had been obliged to come home, just as scarcity of work had caused her father to leave his native parish, and seek employment at other quarries. She had hoped to obtain plain work, but all the family were dismayed and disappointed at the wild spot to which they had come, and anxiously availed themselves of this introduction to beg that the elder boy and girl might be admitted into the town school, distant as it was. At another time, the thought of Charity Elwood would have engrossed Ethel's whole mind, now she could hardly attend, and kept looking eagerly at Richard as he talked endlessly with the good mother. When, at last, they did set off, he would not let her gallop home like a steam-engine, but made her take his arm, when he found that she could not otherwise moderate her steps. At the long hill a figure appeared, and, as soon as Richard was certified of its identity, he let her fly, like a bolt from a crossbow, and she stood by Dr. May's side.|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} aims at {{analysing}} important factors among various perceived determinants influencing intellectual achievements. A 48 -item check list for perceptual determinants was administered on 75 university students as subjects aged from 20 to 30 years. The check list {{was related to}} intellectual achievements at four <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> <b>school</b> ife: elementary school, junior high school, senior high school and university. With respect to the former three <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> <b>school</b> life, retrospective answers were required. Internal-external and home-school dimensions were extracted by a multivariate analysis of the results obtained. It is inferred that our subjects tend to shift from attaching importance to external determinants to taking a serious view of internal determinants, as their judgements are associated with an elder stage <b>of</b> <b>school</b> life. 本研究は学業成績に影響していると認知される様々な規定因の中の重要な要因を分析することをねらいとしている。 48 項目の認知的規定因のチェックリストが 20 才から 30 才までの 75 人の大学生に実施された。チェックリストは学校生活の 4 時期,すなわち小学校,中学校,高校,大学の学業成績と関連づけられた。学校生活のうち前の 3 時期については,回想的回答が求められた。えられた結果の多次元解析により,内的-外的,家庭-学校の次元が抽出された。被験者の判断がより上級の学校と結びつくにつれて,外的な規定因を重視する方向から,内的な規定因を重視する方向へと移っていく傾向があると推測される...|$|R

Also, the differences between girls and boys {{in the relationship between}} teacher&# 39;s liking and perceived teacher&# 39;s support on one side and students&# 39; academic achievement on the other side were examined. 1155 students (fifth and eighth grade <b>of</b> elementary <b>school</b> and second grade <b>of</b> secondary <b>school)</b> and 50 teachers &# 8211; their classteachers &# 8211; participated in the study. The results show that teachers prefer girls to boys in all <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> <b>schooling.</b> This trend is especially evident in eight-graders. Compared to boys, girls have better academic achievement. However, there are no significant differences in the perceived teacher&# 39;s support between girls and boys...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{relation}} between social and academic variables in different school periods and to investigate, whether affective and motivational factors can be regarded as mediating variables in the relation between social and academic variables in school. 1159 students from three different <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> <b>schooling,</b> covering the age range from late childhood through early to middle adolescence, participated in the study. Different models of relations between social and academic variables were tested using structural equation modeling. The results show that the included mediating variables (well-being in school and academic engagement) do not explain the relation between social relations and academic achievement. In younger students, peer relations are related to students’ academic achievement, which does not hold true for both older age groups. Relations to teachers are related to students’ academic outcomes in all <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> <b>schooling.</b> The results also suggest that the method of data assessment is a very important factor in establishing the relations between variables...|$|R

The Humanist concern with widening education that had become significant in the Renaissance was shared by Protestant reformers. Boys might attend the grammar schools or ordinary parish schools. There were also large number of unregulated [...] "adventure schools". By the late seventeenth century there was a largely complete network of parish schools in the Lowlands, but in the Highlands basic education was still lacking in many areas. The widespread belief in the limited intellectual and moral capacity of women, vied with a desire, intensified after the Reformation, for women to take personal moral responsibility, particularly as wives and mothers. They were frequently taught reading, sewing and knitting, but not writing and much lower literacy rates.|$|E
