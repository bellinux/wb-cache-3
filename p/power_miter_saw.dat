50|$|A {{radial arm}} saw is a cutting machine {{consisting}} of a circular saw mounted on a sliding horizontal arm. Invented by Raymond DeWalt in 1922, the {{radial arm saw}} was the primary tool used for cutting long pieces of stock to length until {{the introduction of the}} <b>power</b> <b>miter</b> <b>saw</b> in the 1970s.|$|E
50|$|A <b>power</b> <b>miter</b> <b>saw,</b> {{also known}} as a drop saw, is a power tool used to make a quick, {{accurate}} crosscut in a workpiece at a selected angle. Commonly used for cutting of molding and trim. Most miter saws are relatively small and portable, with common blade sizes ranging from eight to twelve inches.|$|E
50|$|Delta traces {{its roots}} to the Delta Specialty Company founded by Herbert Tautz in 1919 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Based at first in Tautz' garage, Delta Specialty Company thrived, first making small tools for home shops and later {{expanding}} into light industrial machinery. In 1945, Rockwell Manufacturing Company acquired Delta Machinery and renamed it the Delta Power Tool Division of Rockwell Manufacturing Company {{and continued to}} manufacture in Milwaukee. In 1966, Rockwell invented the world's first <b>power</b> <b>miter</b> <b>saw.</b> In 1981, Rockwell's power tool group was acquired by Pentair and re-branded Delta Machinery. Pentair's Tools group was acquired by Black & Decker in 2005.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Power</b> <b>miter</b> <b>saws</b> {{have been}} {{available}} in various forms since the 1970s as specialized cross cut saws but with limited width of cut, especially compared to radial arm <b>saws.</b> Simple <b>miter</b> <b>saws</b> allowed the saw table to pivot allowing miters to be cut in one plane. Compound <b>miter</b> <b>saws</b> also provided saw head tilting allowing compound miters to be cut. <b>Miter</b> <b>saws</b> with abrasive cutting wheels are often used in metal work where they are known as [...] "drop saws" [...] or more commonly [...] "chop saws".|$|R
5000|$|<b>Power</b> {{compound}} <b>miter</b> <b>saws,</b> {{and especially}} the sliding type, have replaced radial arm saws for many woodworkers for MITER cuts.|$|R
5000|$|Riving knives {{are also}} fitted to some {{hand-held}} electrical circular and <b>powered</b> <b>miter</b> or cross-cut <b>saws</b> (known generically as [...] "chop saws").|$|R
50|$|The Rockwell Tools brand {{features}} {{power tools}} (both corded and cordless) and hand tools. Some of these tools include drills, VersaCut circular <b>saws,</b> <b>power</b> planers, <b>miter</b> <b>saws,</b> G-Force angle grinders, sanders, and bench grinders. Many {{of the products}} offered by Rockwell Tools come with free batteries for life. Rockwell Tools also {{offers a variety of}} specialty tools including the Sonicrafter, an oscillating multi-tool that is used for remodeling and general home improvement. The Jawhorse is a clamping device that is similar in style to a bench vise, but offers hands-free operation. Rockwell also offers the ShopSeries, which is a line of tools aimed at budget-conscious DIYers.|$|R
50|$|The <b>miter</b> <b>saw</b> {{was invented}} by Ed Niehaus, a tool {{designer}} for Rockwell, in 1964. The <b>miter</b> <b>saw</b> showcased several innovations still found today: radial arc spring action, blade braking and dust collection. Rockwell did not patent the design, leading to {{a large number of}} manufacturers and innovation improvements.|$|R

5000|$|A primary {{distinguishing}} {{feature of the}} <b>miter</b> <b>saw</b> is the <b>miter</b> index that allows {{the angle of the}} blade to be changed relative to the fence. While most <b>miter</b> <b>saws</b> enable precise one-degree incremental changes to the miter index, many also provide [...] "stops" [...] that allow the miter index to be quickly set to common angles (such as 15°, 22.5°, 30°, and 45°).|$|R

50|$|In {{the late}} 1980s the sliding {{compound}} <b>miter</b> <b>saw</b> was introduced which combined {{all the best}} features of the compound <b>miter</b> <b>saw</b> with sliding tubes allowing the cutter head to traverse for a much wider cut. Since then {{it has become the}} primary cross cut saw for woodworking, largely supplanting the radial arm saw.Manufacturers warn of possible electrocution when used near water or other related saws in a close proximity.|$|R
50|$|During {{the late}} 1970s, the {{compound}} <b>miter</b> <b>saw</b> began {{to replace the}} radial arm saw, but only for crosscuts and miter cuts since <b>miter</b> <b>saws</b> are unable to perform rip cuts. The radial arm saw can be less safe when used by an inexperienced or untrained operator, but is not as dangerous when used properly. In {{the hands of an}} experienced operator, the radial arm saw can safely cut compound miters necessary for picture and door frames, rip lumber precisely to width, cut tongues and grooves, and make variable dadoes. Like the compound <b>miter</b> <b>saw,</b> the radial arm saw can make these cuts with absolute precision, but is capable of making a wider variety of cuts, including more complex ones.|$|R
50|$|A <b>miter</b> <b>saw</b> (mitre in British English) is a saw {{used to make}} {{accurate}} crosscuts and miters in a workpiece.|$|R
5000|$|Compound-miter saw - Compound {{adds the}} ability to rotate the blade head at a range of angles from the board {{allowing}} you to enter the wood at an angle other than 90 degrees. Creates a ramp angled cut {{into the side of}} the wood. Allows for more complex cuts and is commonly used in trim work for homes. A compound <b>miter</b> <b>saw</b> is known as a single compound <b>miter</b> <b>saw,</b> meaning that the head only rotates on one side requiring the user to flip the board to get angle cuts in the other direction.|$|R
50|$|Arbor bolt - Bolt with a washer {{permanently}} attached and reversed threading. Designed {{for use in}} <b>miter</b> <b>saw</b> {{and other}} tools to auto tighten during use to prevent blade fall out.|$|R

50|$|A {{stop block}} {{is a simple}} {{reusable}} jig used in metalworking and woodworking to locate a common edge of a workpiece so that multiple workpieces can get the same operation performed quickly. Common applications are table saws and manual milling machines, {{but they are also}} used on <b>miter</b> <b>saws,</b> band saws, radial arm saws, and abrasive saws.|$|R
5000|$|Standard <b>miter</b> <b>saw</b> - A <b>power</b> tool {{designed}} for straight cross cuts on you lumber {{at a range}} of angles (unlike a chop saw which can only cut 90 degrees to the board). Commonly used to create 45° degree straight cuts for framing.|$|R
50|$|Special {{band saws}} {{designed}} for cutting metal have hardened blades and a feed mechanism for even cutting. Abrasive cut-off saws, {{also known as}} chop saws, are similar to <b>miter</b> <b>saws</b> but with a steel cutting abrasive disk. Cutting torches can cut very large sections of steel with little effort.|$|R
50|$|There are {{two common}} ways to fashion inside corners. One {{is to use}} a {{compound}} <b>miter</b> <b>saw</b> to cut the ends of the corner pieces along two axes simultaneously. The other, called coping, is a two step process, first to cut a simple miter and then to use a coping saw to undercut the miters.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Miter</b> <b>saws</b> are {{inherently}} low hazard as the workpiece is held stationary against a fence while the saw head moves, making kick back almost impossible and normally keeping hands {{clear of the}} blade. [...] Also the saw head is usually drawn back, then lowered and fed forward through the material so that binding is unlikely.|$|R
50|$|The <b>miter</b> <b>saw</b> makes cuts {{by pulling}} a {{spinning}} {{circular saw blade}} down onto a workpiece in a short, controlled motion. The workpiece is typically held against a fence, which provides a precise cutting angle between {{the plane of the}} blade and the plane of the longest workpiece edge. In standard position, this angle is fixed at 90°.|$|R

5000|$|Electric <b>miter</b> <b>saw</b> or [...] "chop saw," [...] or [...] "cut-off saw" [...] or [...] "power miter box": {{for making}} {{accurate}} cross cuts and miter cuts. The basic version has a circular blade fixed at a 90° {{angle to the}} vertical. A [...] "compound miter saw" [...] has a blade that can be adjusted to other angles. A [...] "sliding compound miter saw" [...] has a blade that can be pulled through the work, in an action {{similar to that of}} a radial-arm saw, which provides more capacity for cutting wider workpieces.|$|R
5000|$|Sliding {{compound}} <b>miter</b> <b>saws</b> {{are relatively}} portable, easy to set up, and robust enough to maintain accuracy even when moved around. Because they cut from above {{it is not}} necessary to adjust blade depth for different thicknesses of work piece and, like any bench machine, repeat cuts are very easy. Most saws have an adjustable scale plate for table swiveling with positive stops at commonly used angles. Also, there are usually adjustable stops at 90 and 45 degrees for head tilting allowing easy and very accurate adjustment of the saw.|$|R
50|$|Once {{manufactured}} {{the tops}} need {{only to be}} cut to length, mitered, fitted for assembly, and end capped (only {{if it is a}} visible finished end). A very specific machine for cutting the postform countertop is manufactured by only a few companies, it is commonly called a Cutting Station, Top <b>Saw,</b> or simply <b>Miter</b> <b>Saw.</b> This machine accurately cuts the countertop to field dimensions, making it easy for the installer to make the final scribe cuts on-site to complete the work. Sink cut outs can be made either in the field or at the installers shop.|$|R

25|$|Searching {{elsewhere}} {{in the house and}} grounds of 4315 Charlotte Street, investigators uncovered a human skull inside a closet {{on the second floor of}} his property, and a partially decomposed human head in the backyard. The search also uncovered several human vertebrae scarred by both hacksaw and knife marks stowed in a hallway, and several human teeth stowed in two envelopes. Both a hacksaw and a <b>miter</b> <b>saw</b> were discovered in the basement of the property, and a chainsaw was also found to be soiled with bloodstains, flesh, and pubic hairs. Luminol tests revealed that the floor of Berdella's basement, and two plastic trash barrels, were extensively bloodstained.|$|R
5000|$|Unlike most {{types of}} {{woodworking}} machinery, the {{radial arm saw}} has a clear genesis: it was invented by Raymond De Walt of Bridgeton, New Jersey. DeWalt applied for patents in 1923, which were issued in 1925 (US Patent 1,528,536). [...] DeWalt and others subsequently patented many variations on the original, but DeWalt's original design (sold under the moniker Wonder Worker) remained the most successful: a circular saw blade directly driven by an electric motor held in a yoke sliding along a horizontal arm that is some distance above a horizontal table surface. A saw which combines the sliding and compound features {{is known as a}} sliding compound <b>miter</b> <b>saw</b> or SCMS.|$|R
5000|$|An arbor bolt is {{the bolt}} {{that holds the}} blade to the <b>miter</b> <b>saw.</b> The {{diameter}} of the arbor bolt must match the blade hole size in order to properly secure the blade (12" [...] blades commonly use 1" [...] arbor holes and 10" [...] blades favor 5/8"). Arbor bolts are reversed threaded meaning you have to turn clockwise to loosen the bolt. Many inexperienced users will strip their arbor bolt as a result. The arbot bolt is designed so that the rotational spin of the saw blade is exerting a tightening pressure on the blade, {{as opposed to the}} bolt working its way loose and having the flying blade injure the operator.|$|R
40|$|This article {{describes}} {{the evaluation of the}} generation rate of respirable dust (GAPS, defined as the mass of respirable dust generated per unit linear length cut) from cutting fiber cement siding using different tools in a laboratory testing system. We used an aerodynamic particle sizer spectrometer (APS) to continuously monitor the real-time size distributions of the dust throughout cutting tests when using a variety of tools, and calculated the generation rate of respirable dust for each testing condition using the size distribution data. The test result verifies that power shears provided an almost dust-free operation with a GAPS of 0. 006 g m- 1 at the testing condition. For the same power saws, the cuts using saw blades with more teeth generated more respirable dusts. Using the same blade for all four <b>miter</b> <b>saws</b> tested in this study, a positive linear correlation was found between the saws' blade rotating speed and its dust generation rate. In addition, a circular saw running at the highest blade rotating speed of 9068 rpm generated the greatest amount of dust. All the <b>miter</b> <b>saws</b> generated less dust in the 'chopping mode' than in the 'chopping and sliding' mode. For the tested saws, GAPS consistently decreased with the increases of the saw cutting feed rate and the number of board in the stack. All the test results point out that fewer cutting interactions between the saw blade's teeth and the siding board for a unit linear length of cut tend to result in a lower generation rate of respirable dust. These results may help guide optimal operation in practice and future tool development aimed at minimizing dust generation while producing a satisfactory cut.

50|$|As {{a general}} rule, tools which {{work well for}} rip cutting do not work well for crosscutting. Most woodworkers thus have a table saw, which is used for rip cutting, and a {{separate}} chop or <b>miter</b> <b>saw,</b> which is used for crosscutting. Crosscut power-saws should never be used for ripping a board because it is very dangerous. Circular saw blades designed for rip cutting have {{a smaller number of}} larger teeth than similar blades designed for cross cutting. There are combination blades for table saws {{that can be used for}} ripping and cross cutting but should not be used for non through cuts such as dados and rabbets. If you use a radial arm saw to rip you need a blade with a negative hook angle for the teeth to keep the saw from lifting the board off the saw and kicking back.|$|R
5000|$|With its brands Bosch, Hawera, Dremel, RotoZip, Freud, Vermont American, {{and many}} more, Bosch {{is one of}} the largest {{manufacturers}} of portable power tools worldwide. Bosch manufactures power tools for the building trade, industry and do-it-yourselfers (DIY-ers). In or around 1956, Dr. Hans Erich Slany worked with Bosch to design one of the first plastic power tools. Prior to this time, power tools were metal castings that often conducted electrical sparks or current into the user as well as being very heavy. Today the power tools designed by TEAMS Design have been winning awards worldwide for many years. In 2011, the 12" [...] Dual-Bevel Glide <b>Miter</b> <b>Saw</b> won an EID Silver Award. In 2012, the Dremel Saw Max was awarded a Good Design Award and was chosen as an IDEA Award finalist.
