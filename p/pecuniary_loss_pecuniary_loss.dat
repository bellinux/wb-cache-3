40|$|Non <b>pecuniary</b> <b>losses</b> can be {{characterized}} as losses that are suffered by damaging goods or interests which have in themselves no economic price or value on a financial market. Examples are damage to goods with a primarily sentimental value, such as an album of wedding photos, pain and suffering as a result of physical injury, damage to personal reputation, or even the death of a person. Due to the fact that these goods or interests have no substantial or direct market value, non <b>pecuniary</b> <b>losses</b> are often characterized as losses that cannot be undone with money. Rogers (2001, p. 246) defines non <b>pecuniary</b> <b>losses</b> as “losses which are not damage to a person’s assets or wealth or income and which is are therefore incapable of being quantified in objective financial manner by reference to a market”. Tort law, however, generally recognizes non <b>pecuniary</b> <b>losses</b> to some extent as losses that should be compensated with money...|$|R

40|$|Since 1978 the {{evaluation}} of <b>pecuniary</b> <b>loss</b> resulting from personal injury genuinely derives from the restitutio in integrum principle. In this context the operation of discounting {{the portion of the}} lump sum indemnity representing the victim's future losses takes on particular importance. The method used by the Supreme Court has been considerably improved: the refusal to consider interest rates and inflation rates separately, the recognition of a productivity factor for losses representing future salaries, etc. Four provinces have decided to legislate on one or more discount rates {{to make up for the}} absence or inadequacy of evidence at this level. Despite legislative and courtroom activity, much remains to be done in improving both the present legal system and its replacement by a regime better adapted to the specific problems inherent in evaluating <b>pecuniary</b> <b>losses...</b>|$|R

40|$|In 1967, a {{helicopter}} carrying three passengers and a pilot returning from an offshore drilling platform {{crashed into the}} Gulf of Mexico beyond Louisiana 2 ̆ 7 s territorial waters, killing all aboard. The families of the decedents instituted a wrongful death suit in admiralty, seeking recovery under general maritime law, the Death on the High Seas Act (DOHSA), and the Jones Act. The federal district court found Mobil Oil Corporation, the owner and operator of the helicopter, negligent. In awarding damages the district court limited recovery to <b>pecuniary</b> <b>losses,</b> holding that a <b>pecuniary</b> <b>loss</b> limitation applied regardless {{of the theory of}} recovery. Specifically, the court denied plaintiffs recovery for loss of society damages. The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed, holding that under recent Supreme Court and Fifth Circuit decisions, beneficiaries of a decedent wrongfully killed on the high seas could recover loss of society damages under general maritime law despite the <b>pecuniary</b> <b>loss</b> limitation of DOHSA. Because of conflicting decisions in the circuit courts of appeals regarding the precise limits of the cause of action and remedies for wrongful death under general maritime law, the Supreme Court granted certiorari and, reversing the court of appeals, held in Mobil Oil Corp. v. Higginbotham that nonpecuniary damages could not supplement DOHSA 2 ̆ 7 s <b>pecuniary</b> <b>loss</b> limitation; thus, the Court reinstated the district court 2 ̆ 7 s holding and denied recovery for loss of society damages. Consequently, DOHSA now provides the exclusive remedy for wrongful deaths occurring on the high seas. By so holding, however, the Court ignored the legislative history of DOHSA, which does not mandate this result. Moreover, Higginbotham not only restores various anomalies to maritime wrongful death actions that earlier decisions sought to eliminate, but also contravenes the humane policies of admiralty law. The Court 2 ̆ 7 s decision, therefore, retreats from the modem trend toward fashioning a uniform cause of action and remedy for maritime wrongful deaths and creates further confusion in maritime law...|$|R

40|$|Following {{growing public}} {{awareness}} of the danger from hurricanes and tremendous demands for analysis of loss, many researchers have conducted studies to develop hurricane damage analysis methods. Although researchers have identified the significant indicators, there currently is no comprehensive research for identifying the relationship among the vulnerabilities, natural disasters, and economic losses associated with individual buildings. To address this lack of research, this study will identify vulnerabilities and hurricane indicators, develop metrics to measure the influence of economic losses from hurricanes, and visualize the spatial distribution of vulnerability to evaluate overall hurricane damage. This paper has utilized the Geographic Information System (GIS) to facilitate collecting and managing data, and has combined vulnerability factors to assess the financial losses suffered by Texas coastal counties. A multiple linear regression method has been applied to develop hurricane economic damage predicting models. To reflect the <b>pecuniary</b> <b>loss,</b> insured loss payment was used as the dependent variable to predict the actual financial damage and ratio. Geographical vulnerability indicators, built environment vulnerability indicators, and hurricane indicators were all used as independent variables. Accordingly, the models and findings may possibly provide vital references for government agencies, emergency planners, and insurance companies hoping to predict hurricane damage...|$|R

This article argues that compensatory damages {{are not enough}} to adequately protect consumers and deter consumer victimisation {{on the part of}} businesses. The article first sets out relevant provisions in the statute with regard to damages. Second, the article analyses the regime of damages in relation to other legislation in Canada and Australia from which it has been adapted and looks at how the damages provisions have been interpreted so far. Third, the article considers the types of damages available under the statute and how they may be interpreted by the courts, including <b>pecuniary</b> <b>loss,</b> non-pecuniary loss, the limits of compensatory damages and non-compensatory damages. Finally, the article argues that Parliament, in leaving out exemplary damages under the statute, has weakened its effectiveness in deterring unfair practices aimed at consumers. The authors therefore recommend that Parliament should consider explicitly including exemplary damages in the Consumer Protection (Fair Trading) Act to ensure that the regime effectively deters unfair practices...|$|R
