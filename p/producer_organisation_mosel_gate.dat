40|$|The main co-ordinators/channels used in Hungarian {{fruit and}} {{vegetable}} supply chain are the following: local market, wholesale markets, production co-operatives, marketing cooperatives, <b>producers</b> <b>organisation,</b> processing industry, wholesalers and retailers.

It is very important, therefore, that the farmers have to use marketing channels which could give them the strengths (countervailing power) of more concentrated organisations.

40|$|The {{imbalances}} in {{bargaining power}} between {{the contracting parties}} in the food supply chain have drawn much attention, also from policy makers. The European Commission is committed to facilitate the restructuring of the sector by encouraging the creation of voluntary agricultural <b>producer</b> <b>organisations.</b> DG Agriculture and Rural Development has launched a large study, “Support for Farmers' Cooperatives”, that will provide the background knowledge that will help farmers organise themselves in cooperatives {{as a tool to}} consolidate their market orientation and so generate a solid market income. In addition to agricultural <b>producer</b> <b>organisations</b> and cooperatives, there is also an interest in associations of <b>producer</b> <b>organisations,</b> which are promoted in the fruit and vegetable sector and –if current policy proposals succeed – and in the milk sector...|$|R

Hence, “bargaining” or “governance” might be recognised as <b>producer’s</b> <b>organisation</b> according to Article 152.|$|R

40|$|This {{case study}} {{found out how}} a {{public-private}} partnership in Burkina Faso helped female shea nut producers to link up with the cosmetic industry. Empirical data collected from October-December 2011 revealed that the shea value chain partnership between a international shea processing company, a development organisation, and a local service provider, enabled {{the connection between the}} dynamics of the shea market in Burkina Faso, wherein the demand for shea kernels by international and local buyers affects price setting mechanisms, and the logic of locally embedded organisations, wherein local practices of managing information and financial flows and leadership affect the commitment to collaboration. But could a bilateral agreement between a buying company and <b>producer</b> <b>organisation</b> not have lead to the same result? In this case, the likely answer is no. The case study suggests that the added value of the shea value chain partnership lies beyond the technicalities and practicalities of a collaboration protocol between a private buyer and female <b>producer</b> <b>organisations,</b> and comes down {{to the way in which}} the protocol stimulates joint navigation by the company and <b>producer</b> <b>organisations.</b> The research found that the ‘hands-on approach’ of an ‘institutional entrepreneur’, the service provider in the partnership, played an important role in the processes of joint navigation under whimsical market conditions and stubborn local practices...|$|R
40|$|The role of {{producer}} {{organizations in}} market chains has received increasing attention in recent years, both from governments and donors. In order to lower transaction costs, markets demand that smallholder farmers operate {{in an organized}} manner. However, though the policy openings for support seem promising, smallholder market access through farmer-led economic organisations is not easy. This book presents various approaches to support <b>producer</b> <b>organisations</b> in terms of providing economic services to their members, {{with a focus on}} developing countries. Markets are increasingly fragmented in value chains that link farmers with specific processors, retailers and consumer segments. Several contributions in this book analyse these dynamics in specific value chains, such as the fair trade and organic agriculture and their potential to provide market outlets for smallholder farmers. The sixteen contributions in the book are organized in three sections: - organisational support for producer organisations; - value chain development with producer organisations; - changes in the institutional environment for <b>producer</b> <b>organisations.</b> This book {{is the result of a}} Dutch partnership between policy makers, researchers and practitioners designed to confront ideas with realities. Organized in a platform called Agri-ProFocus, members aim to provide more and better support to <b>producer</b> <b>organisations</b> in the South. Through so-called expert meetings, staff from donor organisations and knowledge centres, government officials, and business representatives, share their experiences and lessons learned. The experiences presented in this book are not recipes for instant success, but instead, highlight that support processes are often more fragile and slower moving than policy makers realise. This book is essential reading for scholars, practitioners and researchers interested in supporting and facilitating trajectories of change led by <b>producer</b> <b>organisations</b> in developing countries.
