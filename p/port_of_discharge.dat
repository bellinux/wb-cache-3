60|$|Yoosoof {{referred}} here to {{the fact}} that when a British cruiser engaged in the suppression of the slave-trade on the east coast of Africa has captured a number of slaves, she is under the necessity of running to the Seychelles Islands, Aden, or some other British <b>port</b> <b>of</b> <b>discharge,</b> to land them there as free men, because, were she to set them free on any part of the coast of Africa, belonging either to Portugal or the Sultan of Zanzibar, they would certainly be recaptured and again enslaved. When therefore the cruisers are absent--it may be two or three weeks on this duty, the traders in human flesh of course make the most of their opportunity to run cargoes of slaves to those ports in Arabia and Persia where they always find a ready market.|$|E
60|$|We {{have already}} remarked on the {{necessity}} that lies on our cruisers, when overladen with rescued slaves, {{to run to}} a distant <b>port</b> <b>of</b> <b>discharge</b> to land them; and on the readiness of the slave-traders {{to take advantage of}} their opportunity, and run north with full cargoes with impunity when some of the cruisers are absent; for it is not possible for a small fleet to guard upwards of a thousand miles of coast effectually, or even, in any degree, usefully. If we possessed a port of discharge--a British station and settlement--on the mainland of the east coast of Africa, this difficulty would not exist. As it is, although we place several men-of-war on a station, the evil will not be cured, for just in proportion as these are successful in making captures, will arise the necessity of their leaving the station {{for weeks at a time}} unguarded.|$|E

30|$|What is {{mentioned}} above describes the original problem in tramp shipping. In turning {{some or all}} the characteristics of ‘optimisation of ship voyage’ referred to in this problem into an OR model, the following research efforts were cited. A general review is given by Christiansen et al. (2004), Christiansen et al. (2013), and Christiansen and Fagerholt (2014). Appelgren (1969, 1971) addressed the problem of tramp shipping for a fleet of cargo ships. The problem of these research papers is to assign an optimal loading sequence of cargoes to each ship during a given time. Each cargo has a loading time window, size, type, <b>port</b> <b>of</b> loading, <b>port</b> <b>of</b> <b>discharging,</b> and cargo handling time in these ports. Each ship has its operational characteristics of the initial position, and expected daily marginal revenue of optional cargoes which may become available during the planning period. All contracted cargoes must be loaded, whereas optional cargoes may be accepted or rejected. A ship may carry only one cargo at a time. The objective is to maximise the revenue of optional cargoes minus cargo handling and fuel cost. The review of these research papers is reported in the follows items. The first is that their research model is most useful for bulk carriers since it assumes only one cargo to be loaded at a time. The second is that the problem known in the literature as the ‘fixed-charge problem’ is not addressed. In this problem, fixed charges; such as port dues, are to be paid {{no matter how many}} cargoes ship selects in each port. The third is that the objective does not consider the time taken to earn revenues. In tramp shipping, revenue or gross profit per day is a common objective.|$|R

Nassau was one of several off shore stopover points for shipments coming into or leaving the Confederate States. [...] Maffitt's duties were broad. [...] "You are authorized to take entire control of all vessels loaded with arms and munitions for the Confederate States." [...] Maffitt's duties included selecting <b>ports</b> <b>of</b> entry and <b>discharging</b> and replacing officers and crews as needed.

5000|$|The {{expansive}} contract language {{corresponds to}} the fact that various modes of transportation would be involved in performing the contract. Kirby and ICC contracted for the transportation of machinery from Australia to Huntsville, Alabama, and, as the crow flies, Huntsville is some 366 miles inland from the <b>port</b> <b>of</b> <b>discharge....</b> Thus, the parties must have anticipated that a land carrier's services would be necessary for the contract's performance. It is clear to us that a railroad like Norfolk was an intended beneficiary of the ICC bill's broadly written Himalaya Clause. Accordingly, Norfolk's liability is limited by the terms of that clause.|$|E
50|$|International freight forwarders, NVOCCs {{and customs}} brokers often charge for {{transferring}} documents to another transportation company at destination. This fee {{is a part}} of the ocean freight charges, being paid by the importer at the <b>port</b> <b>of</b> <b>discharge</b> in the International Commercial Term (incoterm) FOB (free on board), and by the exporter at the origin in the incoterms CFR (cost and freight) and CIF (cost, insurance and freight). This fee is separate from documentation fees charged by carriers and NVOCCs as part of the freight charges on a bill of lading and is separate from other fees for document preparation or for release of cargo. Some companies call this an administration fee, document fee, document transfer fee, but it exists in some form in most destinations and is well known to most shippers. Steamship carriers do not have this fee.|$|E

50|$|In {{commercial}} ship chartering, demurrage is an ancillary {{cost that}} represents liquidated damages for delays. It {{occurs when the}} vessel is prevented from loading or discharging cargo within the stipulated laytime (see Affreightment: under Charter-parties). In the oil industry, {{it refers to the}} excess time taken to discharge or load What the case may be in excess of the allowed laytime. Laytime is the term used to quantify the time allowed within which an operation is allowed to be made. Demurrage is laytime consumed less laytime allocated (if any). The master of the ship must give a Notice of Readiness (NOR) to the charterer when the ship has arrived at the <b>port</b> <b>of</b> loading or <b>discharge.</b> The NOR informs the charterer that the ship is ready to load or discharge. The date and time of the NOR determines when laytime is to commence.|$|R
40|$|With the popularization of the inverter-driven air-conditioner and the {{requirement}} of comfort and energy saving, the operating frequency of inverter-driven air-conditioner is lower and lower, even to 1 Hz. But when the air-conditioner operates under the frequency of 10 Hz, a periodic sound {{will appear in the}} air-conditioner outdoor unit, which should be researched and solved. According to the experiment test and theoretical analysis, it is found that the periodic sound is the excited resonance when the valve opens. The resonator is composed by the <b>discharge</b> <b>port</b> <b>of</b> top-flange and <b>discharge</b> cavity which is made up by cylinder, roller, top-flange and bottom-flange. In one cycle the characteristic of the periodic sound is that the sound will be only taken place when the valve opens and the frequency of the sound will be higher and higher with the crank angle increasing. According to the experimental testing about different type compressor and air-conditioner outdoor unit, it is found that this sound exists in every kinds of rolling piston compressor. Using proper muffler and increasing the thickness of the valve could both reduce this periodic sound...|$|R

50|$|Some clauses {{specify the}} amount of freight to pay and the manner and time of payment. A clause may specify the length of time, usually {{described}} as lay days, for loading and discharging, and for the demurrage to pay if the vessel is detained beyond the lay days. There is usually also a clause that requires that the merchant bear the risk and expense to bring the cargo to the ship and collect it on delivery. Another clause specifies that the master must sign bills of lading for the cargo, either {{at the same rate}} payable under the charter-party, or commonly at any rate of freight (with a stipulation that, if the total bill of lading freight is less than the total freight payable under the charter-party, the charterers pay the difference to the master before the vessel sails). There is usually what is called the cesser clause, by which the charterer's liability under the charter-party ceases on shipment of the cargo, the shipowner taking a lien on the cargo for freight, dead freight, and demurrage. The charter-party is subject to exceptions similar to those in bills of lading. Typically, other clauses provide for commissions paid to the brokers on signing the charter-party, the address commission paid to the agents for the Vessel at the <b>port</b> <b>of</b> <b>discharge,</b> and other details. Clauses in charter-parties vary, but the above outlines what is typical.|$|E

According to Ducruet and Notteboom (2012), on average, a container was handled 3.5 times between the first port of loading and the final <b>port</b> <b>of</b> <b>discharge</b> in 2008, which implies the significance of transshipment operations and that container transshipment volume has grown continuously with vessel enlargements.

40|$|INTRODUCTION. In {{an attempt}} to deal uniformly with several complex and {{delicate}} legal issues that have divided the seafaring {{nations of the world}} {{for most of the last}} century, the Rotterdam Rules 2009 (hereafter: RR) introduce the concept of the “maritime performing party”.

Pursuant to articles 19 and 20 RR, the maritime performing party may be held liable jointly and severally with the contractual carrier for cargo loss or damage or delay in delivery which occurred (basically) be-cause of his own doing or during the time that the cargo was in his care...|$|E

40|$|The United Nations World Food Programme (WFP), {{the largest}} {{humanitarian}} {{agency in the}} world and the logistical arm of the United Nations, reached more than 113 million people in 80 countries in 2004 and delivered more than 50 % of all the food aid in the world. In its endeavor of planning, designing, executing, monitoring and completing each and every one of the projects in which they are involved, all WFP business decisions and logistic steps are tracked down via an information technology tool called WINGS (WFP Information Network and Global System). This database is of extreme importance not only for the actions described above but also because it enables WFP Officers to learn from their past experience and improve their operations and efficiency in the future. This thesis aims to contribute to it. The first half of this study is addressed to briefly describing which business steps are in the WFP commodity pipeline and how the information flows from one another. It then moves into a deep statistical analysis in which lead-times from the moment the donor confirms its contribution to the moment food reaches the <b>port</b> <b>of</b> <b>discharge</b> are calculated. (cont.) Some very interesting conclusions are derived from the analysis, such as which donors are more efficient in their efforts or which kinds of projects require less time and why. The second half of this thesis focuses on calculating some performance and inventory management measures that may help Country Officers. The aim here is to provide them with a wide study regarding performance of the final delivery to the implementing partners. Thus, lead-times from the moment the food has reached the <b>port</b> <b>of</b> <b>discharge</b> until it is delivered to the ending control point are calculated and are used to compute the measures mentioned above. This study had never been done before due to the existence of many uncertain and unique variables in the last part of the delivery system, e. g. transport infrastructure or security situation. Being aware of the limitations in the extrapolation of the results, however, the study performed here may well represent the starting point for a more customized one. by Marc Lopez. Thesis (S.

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{provisions}} of the Rotterdam Rules 2009 relating to the performing party in general and the maritime performing party in particular. Performing party means a person who performs or undertakes to perform any of the carrier’s obligations under a contract of carriage with respect to the receipt, loading, handling, stowage, carriage, keeping, care, unloading or delivery of the goods, to the extent that such person acts, either directly or indirectly, at the carrier’s request or under the carrier’s supervision or control. Maritime performing party means a performing party who performs or undertakes to perform any of the carrier’s obligations during the period between the arrival of goods at the port of loading and their departure from the <b>port</b> <b>of</b> <b>discharge</b> of a ship. The maritime performing party is a new concept introduced by the Rotterdam Rules.
