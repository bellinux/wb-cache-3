The relative <b>permeability</b> <b>coefficients</b> of three phenylpiperidine analogues, meperidine, fentanyl, and sufentanil, all measured on {{a single piece of}} skin, were 3. 7 × 10 − 3, 5. 6 × 10 − 3, and 1. 2 × 10 − 2 cm/hr, respectively. Using membranes from the same skin section, the <b>permeability</b> <b>coefficients</b> of three opioid alkaloids, morphine, codeine, and hydromorphone, were considerably lower, at 9. 3 × 10 − 6, 4. 9 × 10 − 5, and 1. 4 × 10 − 5 cm/hr, respectively. The high <b>permeability</b> <b>coefficients</b> of the former compounds are due to their highly lipophilic nature as reflected in high octanol/water partition coefficients and low solubility parameters. Generally, the <b>permeability</b> <b>coefficients</b> of the narcotics increase as the lipophilicity increases. When viewed in literature perspective, the data suggest that aqueous tissue control of transport is approached {{in the case of the}} phenylpiperidine analogues, all of which have K octanol/water values greater than 40. <b>Permeability</b> <b>coefficients</b> of fentanyl and sufentanil were also determined as a function of pH over the pH range 7. 4 to 9. 4, in this instance with membranes prepared from additional samples of skin. The <b>permeability</b> <b>coefficients</b> of each drug varied less than threefold over the pH range, a behavior consistent with the highly hydrophobic natures of the compounds.

Neither drug influenced the permeation {{of the other}} when they were concurrently applied to the skin membrane. With respect to transdermal delivery, short diffusion lag times of less than 0. 5 hr were observed for each compound. Their permeation rates through heat-isolated epidermis and dermatomed (200 - to 250 -µm) skin sections were essentially the same. However, when the stratum corneum was removed by tape stripping, the respective <b>permeability</b> <b>coefficients</b> were increased > 30 -fold, establishing the stratum corneum as the principal barrier to their skin permeation.

40|$|The matrix {{permeability}} of organic-rich shales and {{its relationship}} with lithological factors including maturity, TOC (total organic carbon) content, porosity and mineralogy is fundamental {{to the process of}} shale oil/gas production from these unconventional reservoirs. The significances of these individual factors controlling matrix permeability are, however, rock-specific and not necessarily of equal importance in all shale gas reservoirs. The matrix permeability of fine-grained sedimentary rocks also depends on the type of permeating fluid, moisture content, pore pressure and effective stress. The effects of these controlling factors on matrix permeability of fine-grained organic-rich shales/mudstones, originating from different potential and producing shale gas plays worldwide (China, Canada, US), have been reviewed and discussed in Chapter 2. The lithotypes occurring in unconventional oil/gas reservoirs have low to extremely-low <b>permeability</b> <b>coefficients</b> which are difficult to measure in the laboratory on a routine basis. The routine experimental procedures applied for high-permeable samples should be verified and tested for these types of rocks. Chapter 3 compares different methodologies (steady state, non-steady state) for the determination of gas <b>permeability</b> <b>coefficients</b> in tight shale samples under controlled confining pressure. For the samples analyzed in this PhD study, the apparent gas <b>permeability</b> <b>coefficients</b> measured using non-steady state techniques were consistently higher than those measured by the steady state method (for dry samples). The Klinkenberg-corrected gas <b>permeability</b> <b>coefficients</b> obtained from steady state and non-steady state techniques were, however, similar but the slip-factors were different, being larger for the non-steady state technique. The Late Mississippian Upper Alum Shale/Chokier Formation (western Germany, Belgium), the Lower Toarcian Posidonia Shale (northern Germany) and the Cambro-Ordovician Scandinavian Alum Shale (Sweden, Denmark) are among the most promising candidates for shale gas production in Western Europe. The fluid transport properties within these potential shale gas reservoirs are, however, still poorly understood. Chapters 4 - 6 present results from laboratory studies investigating the fluid flow mechanisms/properties in the matrix system of these European organic-rich shales, differing in pore network characteristics (porosity, pore size distribution), mineralogy (calcite, clay, quartz), TOC content (3 - 14 %) and maturity (0. 6 - 2. 4 % VRr). Gas (He, Ar, CH 4) and water flow properties were determined at effective stresses ranging between 5 and 37 MPa and temperatures of 45 °C. The effects of different controlling factors/parameters including maturity, porosity, mineralogy, TOC (total organic carbon) content, permeating fluid, pore pressure and effective stress on the conductivity were analysed and discussed. Among the sample suite analyzed, the lowest <b>permeability</b> <b>coefficients</b> parallel and perpendicular to bedding were measured at intermediate maturity levels (oil-window; 0. 88 - 1. 05 % VRr). The Klinkenberg-corrected gas <b>permeability</b> <b>coefficients</b> increased significantly with porosity (4 - 16 %) ranging between 4 • 10 - 22 and 9. 7 • 10 - 17 m². <b>Permeability</b> <b>coefficients</b> measured parallel to bedding were more than one order of magnitude higher than those measured perpendicular to bedding. The permeability anisotropy appeared, furthermore, to be controlled by the mineral composition. <b>Permeability</b> <b>coefficients</b> measured with He were consistently up to five times higher than those measured with Ar and CH 4 under similar experimental conditions. A substantial discrepancy between Klinkenberg-corrected gas <b>permeability</b> <b>coefficients</b> and water <b>permeability</b> <b>coefficients</b> (0. 5 - 10 • 10 - 21 m²) was observed for both immature and overmature samples. Klinkenberg-corrected gas (He, Ar, CH 4) <b>permeability</b> <b>coefficients</b> measured on dry samples were significantly, up to six times, higher than those measured on as-received samples (moisture contents up to 1. 9 wt%). The rate of permeability reduction with increasing effective stress depended significantly on orientation and moisture content.
