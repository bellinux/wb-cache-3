Anthracene- 9 -methanol, an electro-neutral 9 -AC analog, fails to block CFTR, but shows a nearly identical <b>potentiation</b> <b>effect,</b> corroborating the idea that two chemically distinct sites are responsible, respectively, for potentiation and inhibitory actions of 9 -AC. 9 -AC also enhances the activity of ΔR-CFTR, a constitutively active CFTR mutant whose R-domain is removed. In excised inside-out patches, 9 -AC increases Po by prolonging the mean burst durations and shortening the interburst durations. We therefore conclude that two different 9 -AC binding sites for potentiation and inhibitory effects on CFTR channels are located outside of the R-domain. We also speculate that 9 -AC potentiates CFTR activity by directly affecting CFTR gating...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE—To {{investigate}} whether the human cerebellum takes part in fear conditioned potentiation of the acoustic blink reflex.  METHODS—A group of 10 cerebellar patients (eight patients with lesions involving the medial cerebellum, two patients with circumscribed lesions of the cerebellar hemispheres) was {{compared with a}} group of 16 age and sex matched healthy control subjects. The fear conditioned potentiation paradigm consisted of three phases. During the first, habituation phase subjects received 20 successive acoustic blink stimuli. In the subsequent fear conditioning phase, subjects passed through 20 paired presentations of the unconditioned fear stimulus (US; an electric shock) and the conditioned stimulus (CS; a light). Thereafter, subjects underwent the potentiation phase, which consisted of a pseudorandom order of 12 trials of the acoustic blink stimulus alone, 12 acoustic blink stimuli paired with the conditioned stimulus, and six conditioned stimuli paired with the unconditioned stimulus. The EMG of the acoustic blink reflex was recorded at the orbicularis oculi muscles. The <b>potentiation</b> <b>effect</b> was determined as the difference in normalised peak amplitude of the blink reflex evoked by pairs of CS and acoustic blink stimuli and evoked by the acoustic stimulus alone.  RESULTS—In the habituation phase, short term habituation of the acoustic blink reflex was preserved in all cerebellar patients. However, in the potentiation phase, the <b>potentiation</b> <b>effect</b> of the blink reflex was significantly reduced in patients with medial cerebellar lesions compared with the controls (mean (SD) <b>potentiation</b> <b>effect</b> (%), patients: − 6. 4 (15. 3), controls: 21. 6 (35. 6)), but was within normal limits in the two patients with lateral lesions.  CONCLUSIONS—The present findings suggest that the human medial cerebellum is involved in associative learning of non-specific aversive reactions—that is, the fear conditioned potentiation of the acoustic blink reflex. ...|$|E

40|$|Background: Neurosteroids have various {{physiological}} and neuropsychopharmacological effects. In {{addition to the}} genomic effects of steroids, some neurosteroids modulate several neurotransmitter receptors and channels, such as N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors, c-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA A) receptors, and s 1 receptors, and voltage-gated Ca 2 + and K + channels. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the various effects of neurosteroids {{have not yet been}} sufficiently clarified. In the nervous system, inwardly rectifying K + (Kir) channels also play important roles in the control of resting membrane potential, cellular excitability and K + homeostasis. Among constitutively active Kir 2 channels in a major Kir subfamily, Kir 2. 3 channels are expressed predominantly in the forebrain, a brain area related to cognition, memory, emotion, and neuropsychiatric disorders. Methodology/Principal Findings: The present study examined the effects of various neurosteroids on Kir 2. 3 channels using the Xenopus oocyte expression assay. In oocytes injected with Kir 2. 3 mRNA, only pregnenolone sulfate (PREGS), among nine neurosteroids tested, reversibly potentiated Kir 2. 3 currents. The <b>potentiation</b> <b>effect</b> was concentration-dependent in the micromolar range, and the current-voltage relationship showed inward rectification.

40|$|Chemical openers for KCNQ {{potassium}} {{channels are}} useful probes both for understanding channel gating and for developing therapeutics. The five KCNQ isoforms (KCNQ 1 to KCNQ 5, or Kv 7. 1 to Kv 7. 5) are differentially localized. Therefore, the molecular specificity of chemical openers {{is an important}} subject of investigation. Native KCNQ 1 normally exists in complex with auxiliary subunits known as KCNE. In cardiac myocytes, the KCNQ 1 -KCNE 1 (IsK or minK) channel is thought to underlie the IKs current, a component critical for membrane repolarization during cardiac action potential. Hence, the molecular and pharmacological differences between KCNQ 1 and KCNQ 1 -KCNE 1 channels have been important topics. Zinc pyrithione (ZnPy) is a newly identified KCNQ channel opener, which potently activates KCNQ 2, KCNQ 4, and KCNQ 5. However, the ZnPy effects on cardiac KCNQ 1 potassium channels remain largely unknown. Here we show that ZnPy effectively augments the KCNQ 1 current, exhibiting an increase in current amplitude, reduction of inactivation, and slowing of both activation and deactivation. Some of these are reminiscent of effects by KCNE 1. In addition, neither the heteromultimeric KCNQ 1 -KCNE 1 channels nor native IKs current displayed any sensitivity to ZnPy, indicating that the static occupancy by a KCNE subunit desensitizes the reversible effects by a chemical opener. Site-directed mutagenesis of KCNQ 1 reveals that residues critical for the <b>potentiation</b> <b>effects</b> by either ZnPy or KCNE are clustered together in the S 6 region overlapping with the critical gating determinants. Thus, the convergence of <b>potentiation</b> <b>effects</b> and molecular determinants critical for both an auxiliary subunit and a chemical opener argue for a mechanistic overlap in causing potentiation...|$|R
40|$|In {{quantifying}} type B <b>potentiation</b> <b>effects,</b> given earlier merely qualitatively, it {{is found}} that Zn 2 +, 1 — 50 µM, causes increases in action potential duration, twitch tension, and twitch contraction period time, which are all directly proportional to the log of the concentration. Hence, the duration of the action potential, i. e. the magnitude of its mechanically effective period, is a causal factor quantitatively determining the degree of mechanical activation in the isometric twitch. In higher concentrations of Zn 2 + up to 1000 µM, the spike duration and the contraction time continue to increase but the twitch tension is disproportionately smaller, evidently because the high zinc (500 — 1000 µM) raises the mechanical threshold of excitation-contraction (E—C) coupling and reduces the intrinsic strength of the contractile system. Eserine (1. 5 mM) and also high Zn 2 + not only cause type B <b>potentiation</b> <b>effects,</b> but also slow the rise of the spike, thus causing retardation of the very onset of tension production, which is even greater for high Zn 2 + because of the raised mechanical threshold. This retardation is then succeeded by the faster tension output characteristic of type B potentiation resulting from spike prolongation. Thus, the changes in the consecutive, rising and falling phases of the action potential explicitly register their separate effects in the respective very earliest and directly following periods of twitch output; i. e., each phase of the action potential produces its own mechanical "transform. " These transforms, and other effects, suggest that the release of activator Ca 2 + from the sarcoplasmic reticulum during E—C coupling can be graded in both the rate and the total amount of the release...|$|R

Pharmacological concentrations of aspirin and ibuprofen (10 (- 8) - 10 (- 4) M), potentiated histamine (10 (- 6) - 10 (- 4) M) and forskolin (10 (- 5) M) stimulated pepsinogen secretion without affecting basal secretion, acetylcholine (10 (- 6) M) stimulated pepsinogen secretion or cell vitality. Augmentation of secretagogue stimulated pepsinogen secretion {{was dependent on}} extracellular calcium because potentiation was abolished by calcium depletion of the medium. Cimetidine inhibited the <b>potentiation</b> <b>effect</b> on histamine but not on forskolin stimulated pepsinogen secretion, thus suggesting that this augmentation was independent of histamine H 2 receptors. Of interest, potentiation was also independent of endogenous prostaglandin inhibition because exogenous addition of prostaglandin E 2 and D 2 increased both basal and acetylcholine stimulated pepsinogen secretion in a dose dependent way, {{but they did not}} modify histamine or histamine plus aspirin or ibuprofen stimulated pepsinogen secretion. In conclusion, aspirin and ibuprofen potentiate secretagogue stimulated pepsinogen secretion by dispersed human peptic cells and this might be an additional mechanism of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) induced gastric injury.

40|$|At {{vertebrate}} neuromuscular junctions, ATP {{is known}} to stabilize acetylcholine in the synaptic vesicles and to be co-released with it. We have shown previously that a nucleotide receptor, P 2 Y(1) receptor, is localized at the nmjs, and we propose that this mediates a trophic role for synaptic ATP there. In cultured myotubes, the activation of P 2 Y(1) receptors modulated agrin-induced acetylcholine receptor (AChR) aggregation in a potentiation manner. This <b>potentiation</b> <b>effect</b> in agrin-induced AChR aggregation was reduced by antagonizing the P 2 Y(1) receptors. The guanosine triphosphatase RhoA was shown {{to be responsible for}} this P 2 Y(1) -potentiated effect. The localization of RhoA in rat and chicken skeletal muscles was restricted at the neuromuscular junctions. Application of P 2 Y(1) agonists in cultured myotubes induced RhoA activation, which showed an additive effect with agrin-induced RhoA activation. Over-expression of dominant-negative mutant of RhoA in cultured myotubes diminished the agrin-induced AChR aggregation, as well as the <b>potentiation</b> <b>effect</b> of P 2 Y(1) -specific agonist. Application of UTP in the cultures also triggered similar responses as did 2 -methylthioadenosine 5 'diphosphate, suggesting the involvement of other subtypes of P 2 Y receptors. These results demonstrate that RhoA could serve as a downstream mediator of signaling mediated by P 2 Y(1) receptor and agrin, which therefore synergizes the effects of the two neuron-derived trophic factors in modulating the formation and/or maintenance of post-synaptic apparatus at the neuromuscular junctions...|$|E
40|$|International audienceDiclofenac (DCF) adverse {{reactions}} involve diverse mechanisms in different models. We recently demonstrated that DCF-induced toxicity in HepaRG decreases as they express DCF-metabolizing enzymes. DCF metabolism promotes toxicity in Saccharomyces cerevisiae expressing heterologous cytochromes-P 450. N-Acetylcysteine (NAC) {{is used to}} treat diverse medical conditions due to its multiple properties (antioxidant, metal chelator, thiol-disulfide disruption). The latter property accounts for its mucolytic effects and broadens its potential molecular targets to signal transduction proteins, ABC transporters and others. Interaction of NAC with DCF effects depends on the experimental model. This study aims to investigate NAC/DCF interaction and the involvement of ABC transporters in wild type and mutant Saccharomyces cerevisiae. DCF inhibited yeast growth in a dose- and time-dependent manner and the cells started adapting to DCF 24 -h post-treatment. NAC potentiated DCF-induced toxicity if added prior or parallel to DCF. Pretreatment with NAC increased its <b>potentiation</b> <b>effect</b> and compromised cells adaption to DCF. Post-treatment with NAC potentiated DCF toxicity without compromising adaptation. Moreover, mutant strains in ABC transporters Pdr 5, Yor 1, Bpt 1 or Pdr 15, were more sensitive to DCF; while mutant strains in Pdr 5, Vmr 1 or Pdr 12 were more sensitive to NAC/DCF interaction. DCF[*]±[*]NAC elicited on the mutant strain in Yap 1, an oxidative stress-related protein, the same effects as on the wild type. Therefore, oxidative stress {{does not seem to}} be key actor in DCF toxicity in our model.

50|$|Toxicity can {{be broken}} down into two broad {{categories}} of direct and indirect toxicity. Direct toxicity results from a toxicant acting at the site of action in or on the organism. Indirect toxicity occurs with a change in the physical, chemical, or biological environment. Lethality is most common effect used in toxicology and used as an endpoint for acute toxicity tests. While conducting chronic toxicity tests sublethal effects are endpoints that are looked at. These endpoints include behavioral, physiological, biochemical, histological changes. There are a number of effects that occur when an organism is simultaneously exposed to two or more toxicants. These effects include additive <b>effects,</b> synergistic <b>effects,</b> <b>potentiation</b> <b>effects,</b> and antagonistic effects. An additive effect occurs when combined effect is equal to a combination or sum of the individual effects. A synergistic effect occurs when the combination of effects is much greater than the two individual <b>effects</b> added together. <b>Potentiation</b> is an <b>effect</b> that occurs when an individual chemical has no effect is added to a toxicant and the combination has a greater effect than just the toxicant alone. Finally, an antagonistic effect occurs when a combination of chemicals has less of an effect than the sum of their individual effects.|$|R

In type II AC-expressing mouse RAW 264. 7 macrophages, we showed that LPA at 3 – 50 [*]μM increased cyclic AMP formation in a concentration-dependent manner, the effect being additive with that of forskolin or cholera toxin, and synergistic with that of prostaglandin E 1 (PGE 1) or isoproterenol. The <b>potentiation</b> <b>effect</b> of LPA was unaffected by the removal of serum or pertussis toxin treatment. Both colchicine and cytochalasin B potentiated the cyclic AMP response to PGE 1, the effect being additive to that of LPA. On studying the regulation of type II AC by protein kinase C (PKC), phorbol 12 -myristate- 13 acetate (PMA) potentiated the PGE 1 -elicited cyclic AMP response, this effect being non-additive to that of LPA, suggesting that PKC activation was the common mechanism involved in AC potentiation by LPA and PMA.

Our results show that only oxygenated linalool metabolites at carbon 8 positively affect GABAergic currents whereas derivatives hydroxylated or carboxylated at carbon 8 were rather ineffective. Acetylated linalool derivatives resulted in non-significant changes of GABAergic currents. We can conclude that metabolism of linalool reduces its positive allosteric potential at GABAA receptors compared to the significant <b>potentiation</b> <b>effects</b> of the parent molecule linalool itself...|$|R
2500|$|Hydrogen sulfide {{is under}} {{preliminary}} research for its potential {{actions in the}} brain where it could increase {{the response of the}} NMDA receptor and facilitate long term <b>potentiation.</b> Its <b>effects</b> are potentially similar to those of nitric oxide, whereby hydrogen sulfide may have an effect on cardiovascular disease. Although both nitric oxide and hydrogen sulfide relax blood vessels in vitro, their mechanisms of action differ: nitric oxide activates the enzyme guanylyl cyclase, whereas [...] activates ATP-sensitive potassium channels in smooth muscle cells.|$|R
40|$|Pancuronium, vecuronium and a {{combination}} of these were administered in an incremental fashion to study any <b>potentiation</b> of <b>effect</b> with the combination of the two relaxants. The ED 95 (dose producing a 95 % block) of the combination was 29 micrograms kg- 1 for each component in comparison to 57 micrograms kg- 1 for vecuronium and 59 micrograms kg- 1 for pancuronium. The dose-response curves for the three groups did not differ from each other and no potentiation was demonstrated...|$|R
30|$|The {{increase}} in the maximal voluntary concentric torque was found only immediately after the conditioning contraction although the {{increase in}} isometric twitch torque was observed five minutes after conditioning contraction. This difference {{can be explained by}} sensitivity to the <b>potentiation</b> <b>effect</b> of a conditioning contraction (i.e., myosin regulatory light chain phosphorylation which is considered to be the primary mechanism of PAP) (Sweeney et al. 1993). Ca 2 + concentration is much higher in the maximal voluntary concentric contraction (multiple impulses) than in twitch contraction (single impulse). In addition, the extent of increase in torque by conditioning contraction becomes smaller when the Ca 2 + concentration is higher (Persechini et al. 1985). Thus, the increasing effect of the maximal voluntary concentric torque would have diminished faster than that in the isometric twitch torque.|$|E
40|$|Neurotrophins {{have been}} implicated in activity-dependent {{synaptic}} plasticity, but the underlying intracellular mechanisms remain largely unknown. Synaptic potentiation induced by brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), but not neurotrophin 3, was prevented by blockers of adenosine 3 ’, 5 ’-monophosphate (cAMP) signaling. Activators of cAMP signaling alone were ineffective in modifying synaptic efficacy but greatly enhanced the <b>potentiation</b> <b>effect</b> of BDNF. Blocking cAMP signaling abolished the facilitation of BDNF-induced potentiation by presynaptic activity. Thus synaptic actions of BDNF are gated by cAMP. Activity and other coincident signals that modulate cAMP concentrations may specify the action of secreted neurotrophins on developing nerve terminals. Neurotrophins, a family of proteins related to nerve growth factor, are best known for their role in regulating the differentiation and survival of specific populations of developing neurons (1). Neurotrophins ca...|$|E
40|$|The {{responses}} of the canine colonic epithelium to histamine are potentiated by O-alkylhydroxylamines. A study {{of a series of}} such compounds suggested that active compounds had the structure R-O-NH 2, substitution of a nitrogen led to total loss of activity. The locus of the <b>potentiation</b> <b>effect</b> was traced to the inhibition of diamine oxidase. A new series of aliphatic and aromatic O-alkylhydroxylamines were synthesized to explore further the structure-activity relations of this effect. The poten-tiating effects of these compounds were determined by exam-ining the changes in short circuit current (Isc) produced by histamine and from the activity of a soluble preparation of diamine oxidase. We found that 1) branched compounds are less active than their straight chain counterparts, 2) greater steric bulk of the aliphatic substituent decreased activity, 3) th...|$|E

40|$|Introduction. The primary {{trauma of}} {{spinal cord injury}} (SCI) results in severe damage to nervous functions. At the {{cellular}} level, SCI causes astrogliosis. Human umbilical mesenchymal stem cells (HUMSCs), isolated from Wharton’s jelly of the umbilical cord, can be easily obtained. Previously, we showed that the neuroprotective effects of Lavandula angustifolia can lead to improvement in a contusive SCI model in rats. Objective. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the effect of L. angustifolia (Lav) on HUMSC transplantation after acute SCI. Materials and Methods. Sixty adult female rats were randomly divided into eight groups. Every week after SCI onset, all animals were evaluated for behavior outcomes. H&E staining was performed to examine the lesions after injury. GFAP expression was assessed for astrogliosis. Somatosensory evoked potential (SEP) testing was performed to detect the recovery of neural conduction. Results. Behavioral tests showed that the HUMSC group improved in comparison with the SCI group, but HUMSC + Lav 400 was very effective, resulting in a significant increase in locomotion activity. Sensory tests and histomorphological and immunohistochemistry analyses verified the <b>potentiation</b> <b>effects</b> of Lav extract on HUMSC treatment. Conclusion. Transplantation of HUMSCs is beneficial for SCI in rats, and Lav extract can potentiate the functional and cellular recovery with HUMSC treatment in rats after SCI...|$|R
40|$|Intense {{inflammatory}} pain {{caused by}} urate crystals in joints and other tissues is amajor symptom of gout. Among therapy drugs that lower urate, benzbromarone (BBR), an inhibitor of urate transporters, {{is widely used}} because it is well tolerated and highly effective. We demonstrate that BBR is also an activator of voltage-gated KCNQ potassium channels. In cultured recombinant cells, BBR exhibited significant <b>potentiation</b> <b>effects</b> on KCNQ channels comparable to previously reported classical activators. In native dorsal root ganglion neurons, BBR effectively overcame the suppression of KCNQ currents, and the resultant neuronal hyperexcitability caused by inflammatory mediators, such as bradykinin (BK). Benzbromarone consistently attenuates BK-, formalin-, or monosodium urate–induced inflammatory pain in rat and mouse models. Notably, the analgesic effects of BBR are largely mediated through peripheral and not through central KCNQ channels, an observation supported both by pharmacokinetic studies and in vivo experiments. Moreover, multiple residues in the superficial part of the voltage sensing domain of KCNQ channels were identified critical for the potentiation activity of BBR by a molecular determinant investigation. Our data indicate that activation of peripheral KCNQ channels mediates the pain relief effects of BBR, potentially providing a new strategy {{for the development of}} more effective therapies for gout...|$|R
