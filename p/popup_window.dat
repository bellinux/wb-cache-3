2500|$|For example, {{suppose a}} victim clicks a {{malicious}} phishing link beginning with Facebook. A <b>popup</b> <b>window</b> from Facebook will {{ask whether the}} victim would like to authorize the app. If the victim chooses to authorize the app, a [...] "token" [...] {{will be sent to}} the attacker and the victim's personal sensitive information could be exposed. These information may include the email address, birth date, contacts, and work history. In case the [...] "token” has greater privilege, the attacker could obtain more sensitive information including the mailbox, online presence, and friends list. Worse still, the attacker may possibly control and operate the user’s account. Even if the victim does not choose to authorize the app, he or she will still get redirected to a website controlled by the attacker. This could potentially further compromise the victim.|$|E

Our approach uses continuous semantic zooming to make the growth of the window more subtle.

Some also allow for easy navigation back to the original section of code by storing the initial cursor location or by displaying the requested definition in a <b>popup</b> <b>window</b> or temporary buffer.

40|$|Summary: Genome-wide {{association}} studies use {{hundreds of}} thousands of markers making it challenging to present and finally interpret the results. We developed a graphical, web-based solution for an interactive exploration of the results of case-control studies, with a tight integration of related gene information and tissuespecific expression data. Association results are presented as physical position-based vertical bars with known genes included as horizontal bars at their respective physical positions. The interface allows the specification of filtering criteria for the association data and highlights potentially interesting genes with user-specified terms occurring in their reports or with relevant expression patterns. <b>Popup</b> <b>windows</b> and hyperlinks provide drill-down capabilities and quick access to relevant data AssociationDB can either be used as a standalone solution or as a front-end joining association results obtained by other software with genomic information...|$|R

The results indicate that authors can create good quality metadata when working with the Dublin Core, and that is {{in some cases they}} may be able to create metadata that is of better quality than what a metadata professional can produce. This research establishes that authors think metadata is valuable for resource discovery, that it should be created for web resources, and that they, as authors, should be involved in metadata production for their works. The study also indicates that a simple web form, with textual guidance and selective use of features (e. g., <b>popup</b> <b>windows,</b> drop-down menus, etc.) can assist authors in generating good quality metadata.
