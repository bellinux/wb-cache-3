5000|$|Mela shikar ('মেলা চিকাৰ) is a {{traditional}} method of capturing wild elephants <b>for</b> <b>captive</b> <b>use.</b> [...] The process involves lassoing a wild elephant {{from the back of}} a trained one, called a koonki. This practice is prevalent in the northeastern part of India, especially in Assam, {{and is one of the}} methods seen in ancient India. Other traditional elephant capture methods include: khedda, byle shikar, snaring, pit method, and decoying by using a female koonki to lure a male elephant. Mela shikar used to be organized twice a year - after Durga Puja and during Bihu.|$|R

From 1993 to 2003, the two Wyoming toad breeding facilities produced tadpoles and toadlets, all of which were released into either Mortenson Lake, Lake George (located at the nearby Hutton Lake National Wildlife Refuge) and a private release site. The typical method <b>for</b> <b>captive</b> breeding <b>used</b> is containment of six males and four females, housed in 45 gallon aquarium. Inside the aquarium is a cork sponge mat for basking, a water tray, and a variety of foods like mealworms, wax worms, and crickets. Hormonal induction of spermination has been successfully used to increase overall production of eggs per individual and an increased survival rate of fertilized eggs to swimming stage.|$|R
50|$|In 1971, the Government of India nationalized all the 214 coking-coal {{mines and}} 12 coke-ovens {{running in the}} private sector, {{excluding}} those held by TISCO and IISCO <b>for</b> their <b>captive</b> <b>use.</b> On 1st Jan 1972, a new Government company Bharat Coking Coal Limited (BCCL) was formed {{to take control of}} these nationalized mines and coke-ovens. Next year on 30 January 1973, all the remaining 711 non-coking coalmines of the country in private sector were also nationalized. 184 of these mines were handed over to BCCL, and remaining 527 were handed over to a newly opened department Coal Mines Authority. 4 months later on 14 June 1973, this department was converted into a separate Government company CMAL. NCDC, earlier formed in 1957, was merged with CMAL, and 45% share-holding of Central Government in Singareni Collieries Company Ltd was also handed over to CMAL. CMAL started functioning with its 4 divisions, viz, Eastern Coalfields, Central Coalfields, Western Coalfields, and Central Mine Planning & Design Institute.|$|R
50|$|Solar-power plants {{equipped}} with battery-storage systems where net energy metering is used can feed stored electricity into {{the power grid}} when its frequency is below the rated parameter (50 Hz) and draw excess power from the grid when its frequency is above the rated parameter. Excursions {{above and below the}} rated grid frequency occur about 100 times daily. The solar-plant owner would receive nearly double the price for electricity sent into the grid compared to that consumed from the grid if a frequency-based tariff is offered to rooftop solar plants or plants dedicated to a distribution substation. A power-purchase agreement (PPA) is not needed for solar plants with a battery storage system to serve ancillary-service operations and transmit generated electricity <b>for</b> <b>captive</b> consumption <b>using</b> an open-access facility. Battery storage is popular in India, with more than 10 million households using battery backup during load shedding. Battery storage systems are also used to improve the power factor. Battery storage is also used economically to reduce daily/monthly peak power demand for minimising the monthly demand charges from the utility to the commercial and industrial establishments.|$|R

40|$|Mexico, a rich {{country in}} terms of {{amphibian}} diversity, hosts about 375 described species. Population declines have been documented for several species where {{it is evident that}} their habitat is being destroyed or modified. However, other species which inhabit pristine areas are declining as well. It has been suggested that the chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (B. d.) {{may be one of the}} causes of the enigmatic declines in Mexico. We surveyed a total of 45 localities, in 12 states across Mexico, examining a total of 360 specimens representing 14 genera and 30 species. We also examined 91 specimens of Ambystoma mexicanum from a captive population in Mexico City as well as one Pachymedusa dacnicolor obtained in a pet shop. We used a two-tiered technique to detect the pathogen. For wild-caught specimens, we utilized light microscopy to identify presence of B. d. sporangia in amphibian skin. Then, to verify the infection, we used a quantitative real-time PCR assay on collected skin sections which is specific for B. d. <b>For</b> <b>captive</b> animals, we <b>used</b> a nonlethal version of the real-time PCR technique. We found evidence of B. d. infection in 111 animals comprising 14 species in 13 localities. A large percentage (84 %) of Ambystoma mexicanum from the colony were infected with B. d. The two most highly infected individuals were the endangered Ambystoma mexicanum, from a captive colony, and Pachymedusa dacnicolor, purchased at a pet shop...|$|R

This paper examines whether <b>using</b> <b>captives</b> <b>for</b> this purpose is beneficial for employ-ees and whether employee benefit premiums should be tax deductible in this case. We conclude that under the DOL’s conditions, the practice is advantageous for employees. Furthermore, we conclude that unless outside risk and outside premiums {{are added to the}} pooling arrangement, there’s no basis for permitting premiums to be tax deductible. The analysis suggests the Internal Revenue Service’s treatment of employ-ee benefit risk as “outside risk ” when insured by the parent company’s captive insurer is incorrect.

50|$|Thousands of {{box turtles}} are {{collected}} from the wild {{every year for the}} domestic pet trade, primarily from South Carolina, the only remaining state where they can legally be captured from the wild and sold <b>for</b> profit. <b>Captive</b> turtles may have a life span as short as three days if they aren't fed, watered, and held in a proper container. The vivid shell color found in many eastern box turtles often fades when a turtle is brought into captivity. This has led to the mistaken belief that the color fades as the turtle ages. The truth is that insufficient access to full sunlight causes the color in the keratin layer to fade. The eastern box turtle is protected throughout most of its range but many states allow the capture and possession of box turtles <b>for</b> personal <b>use.</b> <b>Captive</b> breeding is fairly commonplace, but not so much that it can supply the market demand. Although box turtles may make hardy captives if their needs are met, and are frequently kept as pets, they are not easy turtles to keep, owing to their many specific requirements.Eastern box turtles require high humidity, warm temperatures with vertical and horizontal thermal gradients, suitable substrate for burrowing, and full spectrum ultraviolet lighting that mimics sunlight. A basking area {{at one end of the}} enclosure is important to offer the turtle the ability to warm itself and is critical to sexually mature males and females for development of sperm and egg follicles respectively.|$|R
