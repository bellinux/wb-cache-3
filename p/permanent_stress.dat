50|$|An unusual {{feature of}} the Candida genus is that in many of its species (including C. albicans and C. tropicalis, but not, for instance, C. glabrata) the CUG codon, which {{normally}} specifies leucine, specifies serine in these species. This is an unusual example of {{a departure from the}} standard genetic code, and most such departures are in start codons or, for eukaryotes, mitochondrial genetic codes. This alteration may, in some environments, help these Candida species by inducing a <b>permanent</b> <b>stress</b> response, a more generalized form of the heat shock response. However this different codon usage makes it more difficult to study C. albicans protein-protein interactions in the model organism S. cerevisiae. To overcome this problem a C. albicans specific two-hybrid system was developed.|$|E

30|$|The {{transfer}} of stress from one fault segment to the neighboring segment {{on the same}} fault, described in the above examples, is a special case of the more general phenomenon of stress transfer, which can potentially occur between any pair of separate faults. When an earthquake occurs, it causes instantaneous <b>permanent</b> <b>stress</b> changes throughout the surrounding region. These stress changes may increase the stress on favorably oriented faults in the region, leading to the subsequent occurrence of earthquakes on some of them that {{may be attributed to}} the triggering effect of the stress increase.|$|E

30|$|The most {{important}} {{information about the}} slope geometry is the slope angle. When the ground is sloping a static shear stress develops in the soil. This stress causes the deformations to accumulate in the downhill direction. Biscontin (2001) {{conducted a series of}} direct simple shear tests on Young Bay Mud from San Francisco Bay. She observed that the effect of a slope (i.e., a consolidation shear stress) increased the strength of the soil when shearing downslope, but reduced the factor of safety (FoS) for the slope by decreasing the difference between the <b>permanent</b> <b>stress</b> and the soil strength.|$|E
30|$|Aftershocks {{following}} {{the occurrence of}} a mainshock are triggered by two main processes: dynamic triggering and static triggering. Dynamic triggering occurs when seismic waves travelling away from the first earthquake cause transient stress perturbations that trigger aftershocks. This has been observed to occur at quite large distances, but at large distances the triggering appears {{to be limited to}} fairly small aftershocks. Static triggering, also known as Coulomb stress transfer (CST), is based on the hypothesis that instantaneous and <b>permanent</b> <b>stress</b> changes near the source region of one earthquake can trigger other earthquakes by increasing the stress on the neighboring faults on which they occur [16].|$|E

40|$|Plants {{from two}} populations of Laurus nobilis (Tunisia issued from a {{semi-arid}} inland site and Algeria originating from a coastal sub-humid area) were exposed during three months under similar controlled conditions to two stress intensities of <b>permanent</b> <b>stress</b> (60 % (S 1) and 20 % (S 2) of Held capacity) or to cyclic water stress, plants being re-watered when the soil moisture dropped to 60 % (S 11) or 20 % (S 22) of field capacity. One-year old plants displayed contrasting physiological strategies {{to cope with}} water stress. Algeria exhibited a higher decrease in osmotic potential (psi s) in relation to stress-induced proline accumulation. Glycinebetaine accumulated in response to drought in response to <b>permanent</b> <b>stress</b> (Algeria) or cyclic stress (Tunisia). The two populations had similar net photosynthesis (A) but Algeria exhibited higher water use efficiency (WUE) than Tunisia. A drought-induced increase in the apoplastic water content (AWC) was noticed in response to mild stress intensities (S 1 and S 11) in Tunisia {{and in response to}} higher stress intensities (S 2 and S 22) in Algeria in relation to a stress-induced accumulation of pectin and proportion of arabinose within the pectic fraction. Bulk modulus of elasticity (E) increased in Tunisia in response to permanent drought and in Algeria in response to cyclic stress, {{as a result of a}} stress-induced increase in cellulose (Algeria) or hemicellulose (Tunisia). It is concluded that water stress tolerance could be achieved by both osmotic and elastic adjustment in the coastal population which did not exhibit a prodigal water use comparatively to the inland population. Differences between populations are strongly influenced by the kinetics of water stress application. (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier Ltd...|$|E

To accomplish this, the fabric is passed through a furnace where the oil is removed by burning. It is known that the oil removal process reduces the tensile strength of the fabric. The burning process is analysed via a simple mathematical model that allows the furnace parameters to be optimized.

Soil or cement dust were applied on peach trees growing in a Mediterranean {{area with the}} above climatic characteristics. Soil and cement dust accumulation onto the leaves decreased the photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) available to the leaves without causing any shade effect. Soil and mainly cement dust deposition onto the leaves decreased stomatal conductance, photosynthetic and transpiration rates, and water use efficiency due possibly to stomatal blockage and other leaf cellular effects. In early autumn, rain events removed soil dust and leaf functions partly recovered, while cement dust created a crust partially remaining onto the leaves and causing more <b>permanent</b> <b>stress.</b> Leaf characteristics were differentially affected by the two dusts studied due to their different hydraulic properties.

40|$|Summary. Hyperhydric malformations {{affecting}} shoots under micropropagation, {{a phenomenon}} called vitrification or hyperhydricity, appear as resulting from an unability of the organs to adapt completely their whole defense battery composed of enzymes against activated oxygen species and of soluble reductants, {{in front of}} several simultaneous stresses due to in vitro culture conditions. Two different types of calli, habituated to both auxins and cytokinins, show typical characteristics of hyperhydricity. Although {{they appear to be}} protected against deleterious reactions generated by stresses, behaviour in darkness instead of light and several biochemical features prone for the calli still being tissues under <b>permanent</b> <b>stress.</b> Paradoxical results unexplained by literature data lead to a reappraisal of fundamental questions related to stresses, especially in relation to hyperhydricity and habituation.

We {{consider}} the eect of <b>permanent</b> <b>stress</b> changes on a velocity strengthening rate-and-state fault, through numerical simulations and ana-lytical results on 1 D, 2 D and 3 D models.

Perturbations that increase the Coulomb stress lead to the strongest transients, but creep bursts can also be triggered by perturbations that decrease the Coulomb stress. In the latter case peak slip velocity is attained long after the perturbation, so {{that it may be}} dicult in practice to identify their origin. The evolution of slip in a creep transient shares many features with the nucleation process of a rate-and-state weak-ening fault: slip initially localizes over a region of size not smaller than Lb, then accelerates transiently and nally expands as a quasi-static propagating crack. The characteristic size Lb implies a constraint on the grid resolution o...|$|E

However, {{the influence of}} water {{is more complex than}} assumed; work has been carried on for better understanding of involved phenomena. Single-mode fibres were aged in hot water at 65 and 85 degrees C for different aging durations. In a first step, fibres were tested after successive 3 months periods. up to 27 months. A second series of experiments was implemented on a shorter time scale, from one day to 3 months. Lifetime evolution of fibres subjected to static stress revealed an oscillatory evolution, while fibre strength in the dynamic mode decrease.
