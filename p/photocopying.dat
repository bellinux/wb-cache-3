5|$|Roughly {{one quarter}} of all zinc output in the United States in 2009 was {{consumed}} in zinc compounds; a variety of which are used industrially. Zinc oxide is widely used as a white pigment in paints and as a catalyst {{in the manufacture of}} rubber to disburse heat. Zinc oxide is used to protect rubber polymers and plastics from ultraviolet radiation (UV). The semiconductor properties of zinc oxide make it useful in varistors and <b>photocopying</b> products. The zinc zinc-oxide cycle is a two step thermochemical process based on zinc and zinc oxide for hydrogen production.|$|E
5|$|The {{demand for}} {{selenium}} by the electronics industry is declining, despite {{a number of}} continuing applications. Its photovoltaic and photoconductive properties are still useful in <b>photocopying,</b> photocells, light meters and solar cells. Its use as a photoconductor in plain-paper copiers once was a leading application, but in the 1980s, the photoconductor application declined (although {{it was still a}} large end-use) as more and more copiers switched to organic photoconductors. Though once widely used, selenium rectifiers have mostly been replaced (or are being replaced) by silicon-based devices. The most notable exception is in power DC surge protection, where the superior energy capabilities of selenium suppressors make them more desirable than metal oxide varistors.|$|E

The National Archives' reading rooms contain a reference library, printed catalogues, <b>photocopying</b> facilities, an information desk featuring a number of publications and fact sheets and tools for preserving Malta's records. Items stored in the archives may be accessed by members of the public by filling out a form. The records are then brought out to the requester's table.

40|$|<b>Photocopy</b> {{documents}} are {{very common in}} our normal life. People are permitted to carry and present <b>photocopied</b> documents to avoid damages to the original documents. But this provision is misused for temporary benefits by fabricating fake <b>photocopied</b> documents. Fabrication of fake <b>photocopied</b> document is possible only in 2 nd and higher order recursive order of <b>photocopies.</b> Whenever a <b>photocopied</b> document is submitted, it {{may be required to}} check its originality. When the document is 1 st order <b>photocopy,</b> chances of fabrication may be ignored. On the other hand when the <b>photocopy</b> order is 2 nd or above, probability of fabrication may be suspected. Hence when a <b>photocopied</b> document is presented, the recursive order number of <b>photocopy</b> is to be estimated to ascertain the originality. This requirement demands to investigate methods to estimate order number of <b>photocopy.</b> In this work, a different approach based on probability distributions like normal, extreme values and exponential is proposed to estimate the recursive order number of the <b>photocopied</b> document under consideration. A detailed experimentation is performed on a generated data set and the method exhibits efficiency close to 84 %...|$|R

People are permitted to carry and produce <b>photocopied</b> documents frequently, to avoid damages or losing the original documents. But this provision is misused for temporary benefits by fabricating fake <b>photocopied</b> documents.

The work in this paper mainly focuses on detecting fabrication of <b>photocopied</b> document in which some contents are manipulated by smearing whitener over the original content and writing new contents above it.

25|$|In the 1950s and 1960s, {{correction}} fluid made its appearance, under brand {{names such as}} Liquid Paper, Wite-Out and Tipp-Ex; it was invented by Bette Nesmith Graham. Correction fluid {{was a kind of}} opaque, white, fast-drying paint that produced a fresh white surface onto which, when dry, a correction could be retyped. However, when held to the light, the covered-up characters were visible, as was the patch of dry {{correction fluid}} (which was never perfectly flat, and frequently not a perfect match for the color, texture, and luster of the surrounding paper). The standard trick for solving this problem was <b>photocopying</b> the corrected page, but this was possible only with high quality photocopiers.|$|E

The case was finally resolved in September 2008 with Cleveland Bridge ordered to pay £6.1million in damages and 20% of Multiplex's costs after the court found Cleveland Bridge was in the wrong to walk off site. The judge criticised both sides for allowing the case to reach court, pointing out that total costs were £22million, including £1million for <b>photocopying.</b> Multiplex's ultimate bill is estimated to be over £10million. In 2007, Multiplex also contested a claim from its concrete contractor, PC Harrington, that Multiplex owes £13.4million to PC Harrington.|$|E

25|$|The library {{operates}} a strict policy on copying of material. Until fairly recently, personal <b>photocopying</b> of library material was not permitted, {{as there was}} concern that copying and excessive handling would result in damage. However individuals may now copy most material produced after 1900, and a staff-mediated service is provided for certain types of material dated between 1801 and 1900. Handheld scanners and digital cameras are also permitted for use on most post-1900 publications and digital cameras may also be used, with permission, with older material. The Library will supply digital scans of most pre-1801 material. Microform copies have been made {{of many of the}} most fragile items in the library's collection, and these are substituted for the originals whenever possible.

It sponsored the campaigns of the Writers' Action Group to establish the Public Lending Right and the Authors' Licensing and Collecting Society which – starting from a single room in the Writers' Guild premises – has collected and distributed over £100 million in payments to writers for <b>photocopying</b> and overseas retransmission of broadcasts. WGGB also hosts the annual Writers' Guild Awards. In 1997 WGGB merged with the Theatre Writers Union, and membership now stands at around 2,400.
