The Command key's purpose is to allow the user to enter keyboard commands in applications and in the system. An [...] "extended" [...] Macintosh keyboard — {{the most common type}} — has two command keys, one {{on each side of the}} space bar; some compact keyboards have one only on the left.|$|E

Combines modern high-pressure-ratio gas-turbine engine with multistage counterrotating power turbine directly coupled to counterrotating, advanced high-speed <b>propellers.</b> <b>Key</b> feature of system is unique direct turbine drive eliminating need for gearbox to transmit power to propeller blades...|$|R
40|$|There is {{increased}} interest {{in the ability to}} predict the noise associated with commercial ship <b>propellers.</b> <b>Key</b> components of the computational analysis process are considered for two test cases and the future direction in resolving the associated challenges is presented. Firstly, the Potsdam Propeller Test Case is used to compute tonal blade passage noise using the Ffowcs Williams–Hawkings acoustic analogy. Cavitation extents predicted using the Sauer and Schnerr mass transfer model agree well with the experiment but show little unsteadiness due to URANS being used. A complementary study of initial results from the study of cavitation noise modelling attempt is presented for a NACA 0009 section, used as a simplified representation of a propeller blade. Large Eddy Simulation and FW-H acoustic analogy are used in order to estimate the cavitation-induced noise. Results indicate that the discussed approach provides the means for identifying low-frequency noise generation mechanisms in the flow, but does not allow for the fine-scale bubble dynamics or shockwave formation to be resolved. It is concluded that the discussed approach is a viable option to predict large parts of the marine propeller noise spectra but still further work is needed in order to account for the broadband component...|$|R
40|$|Preliminary {{results are}} {{presented}} from a numeri-cal study of the unsteady hydrodynamics of an AUV thruster. A vortex-lattice, lifting-surface model, devel-oped originally for ship propellers operating under nor-mal design conditions at constant angular velocity, is modified to handle unsteady operating conditions of an AUV thruster during dynamic positioning and maneu-vering. The present numerical code applies to an un-ducted propeller though the method can be modified to handle ducted propellers. The results from sample runs of the thruster undergoing step changes and sinusoidal oscillations in the angular velocity of the <b>propeller</b> are shown. <b>KEY</b> WORDS: AUV thruster, unsteady propeller hydrody-namics...|$|R
40|$|Oligopeptidase B cleaves after basic {{amino acids}} in {{peptides}} up to 30 residues. As a virulence factor in bacteria and trypanosomatid pathogens that is absent in higher eukaryotes, this is a promising drug target. Here we present ligand-free open state and inhibitor-bound closed state crystal structures of oligopeptidase B from Trypanosoma brucei, the causative agent of African sleeping sickness. These (and related) structures show the importance of structural dynamics, governed by a fine enthalpic and entropic balance, in substrate size selectivity and catalysis. Peptides over 30 residues cannot fit the enzyme cavity, preventing the complete domain closure required for a <b>key</b> <b>propeller</b> Asp/Glu to fix the catalytic His and Arg in the catalytically competent conformation. This size exclusion mechanism protects larger peptides and proteins from degradation. Similar bacterial prolyl endopeptidase and archael acylaminoacyl peptidase structures demonstrate this mechanism is conserved among oligopeptidase family enzymes across all three domains of life...|$|R
40|$|A low Reynolds number, high subsonic {{mach number}} flight regime is fairly {{uncommon}} in aeronautics. Most flight vehicles do not fly under these aerodynamic conditions. However, recently {{there have been}} a number of proposed aircraft applications (such as high altitude observation platforms and Mars aircraft) that require flight within this regime. One of the main obstacles to flight under these conditions is the ability to reliably generate sufficient thrust for the aircraft. For a conventional propulsion system, the operation and design of the <b>propeller</b> is the <b>key</b> aspect to its operation. Due to the difficulty in experimentally modeling the flight conditions in ground-based facilities, it has been proposed to conduct propeller experiments from a high altitude gliding platform (APEX). A preliminary design of a propeller experiment under the low Reynolds number, high mach number flight conditions has been devised. The details of the design are described as well as the potential data that will be collected...|$|R
40|$|The {{importance}} of good teachers is no secret. Over {{the last two}} decades, research on student achievement has pinpointed {{the central role of}} teachers as one of the <b>key</b> <b>propellers</b> referred to in terms of a focus on student outcomes. This review exploits the teacher’s effectiveness and what makes an effective teacher. Classroom management, classroom climate and teaching are the three factors that had statistically significant positive impacts on student academic outcomes. Teachers’ sense of professional identity influences their relative commitment and resilience as well as their capacities to manage variations to sustain their teaching effectiveness. It draws out implications for policymakers in education and for improving classroom practice. In order to improve teacher efficacy, greater subject specific training in theory and practical work, both in pre-service and continuing teacher training programs could be offered. Conclusions are drawn that highly-qualified teachers are still in high demand for boosting student’s motivation for optimum outcome. The findings unraveled in this study that the trend of augmentation in the Sri Lankan science secondary education context is growing at a slow but steady pace and also no significant impacts of teacher training on either teacher or student thus imply the ineffectiveness of short-term teacher training programmes on teacher and student performance...|$|R
