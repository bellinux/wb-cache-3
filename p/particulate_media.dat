40|$|Cement grouted soils, which {{consist of}} <b>particulate</b> soil <b>media</b> and {{cementation}} agents, {{have been widely}} used for the improvement of the strength and stiffness of weak ground and for the prevention of the leakage of ground water. The strength, elastic modulus, and Poisson’s ratio of grouted soils have been determined by classical destructive methods. However, the performance of grouted soils depends on several parameters such as the distribution of particle size of the <b>particulate</b> soil <b>media,</b> grouting pressure, curing time, curing method, and ground water flow. In this study, elastic wave velocities are used to estimate the strength and elastic modulus, which are generally obtained by classical strength tests. Nondestructive tests by using elastic waves at small strain are conducted before and during classical strength tests at large strain. The test results are compared to identify correlations between the elastic wave velocity measured at small strain and strength and stiffness measured at large strain. The test results show that the strength and stiffness have exponential relationship with elastic wave velocities. This study demonstrates that nondestructive methods by using elastic waves may significantly improve the strength and stiffness evaluation processes of grouted soils...|$|R

Prefilter and <b>particulate</b> air filter <b>media</b> are susceptible to rapid fouling that adversely affects their performance {{and can lead to}} catastrophic failure of the air revitalization system, which may result in mission failure. For a long-term voyage, it is impractical to carry replacement particulate prefilter and filter modules due to the usual limitations in size, volume, and weight. The only solution to this problem is to reagentlessly regenerate prefilter and filter media in place. A method was developed to modify the <b>particulate</b> prefilter <b>media</b> to allow them to regenerate reagentlessly, and in place, by the application of modest thermocycled transverse or reversed airflows. The innovation may allow NASA to close the breathing air loop more efficiently, thereby sustaining the vision for manned space exploration missions of the future. A novel, self-cleaning coatings technology was developed for air filter media surfaces that allows reagentless in-place regeneration of the surface. The technology grafts thermoresponsive and nonspecific adhesion minimizing polymer nanolayer brush coatings from the prefilter media. These polymer nanolayer brush architectures can be triggered to contract and expand to generate a "pushing-off" force by the simple application of modestly thermocycled (i. e. cycling from ambient cabin temperature to 40 C) air streams. The nonspecific adhesion-minimizing properties of the coatings do not allow the particulate foulants to adhere strongly to the filter media, and thermocycled air streams applied to the media allow easy detachment and in-place regeneration of the media with minimal impact in system downtime or astronaut involvement in overseeing the process...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We present {{here the}} {{application}} of the Maxwell Garnett (MG) and the Bruggeman (Br) formalisms to homogenize very general linear bianisotropic-in-bianisotropic <b>particulate</b> composite <b>media</b> with ellipsoidal inclusions. Both formalisms involve the calculation of certain depolarization dyadics, which generally amounts to the numerical evaluation of several two-dimensional integrals. The MG estimate of the constitutive dyadic of the homogenized composite medium can then be obtained by straightforward matrix manipulations. The Br estimate, however, involves nonlinear equations which have to be solved iteratively. We present an iteration scheme that converged rapidly in most cases tested. Numerical results are given for those composite media for which the Bruggeman formalism so far has not been implemented: spherical chiral inclusions in a uniaxial dielectric host medium, spheroidal chiral inclusions in free space, spherical chiral inclusions in a biaxial dielectric host medium, and spherical voids in a gyrotropic dielectric host medium. 1...|$|R

It is important to emphasize that they principally differ from continuous beds, polymer rods (better known as monoliths), which are <b>particulate</b> separation <b>media</b> with pores permitting hydrodynamic flow through the columns. Monoliths, thus, are more similar to beds conventionally packed with beads, although the particles building up monolithic columns are usually smaller in size (few submicometers) and covalently linked together. Consequently, homogeneous gels deserve better the term “monoliths” having a non-particulate structure formed by crosslinked free polymer chains (according to a dictionary a monolith is a non-modularized column). The goals of this minireview are to clarify the position of homogeneous gels among the separation media (including polymer solutions), to explain and to exemplify their outstanding (electro) chromatographic properties.

40|$|In {{order to}} further {{understand}} the behaviour of magnetic recording media {{the relationship between}} the microscopic and the macroscopic behaviour must be more precisely understood.

Presented here are several computer simulations of <b>particulate</b> recording <b>media,</b> based on models of their microscopic behaviour. The simulations were used to probe the macroscopic behaviour of the systems and relate this to the microscopic models used. The four areas covered are: Time dependence in magnetic systems. A refinement of an established model of a perpendicular thin film. Results have been obtained for the logarithmic time dependence of the magnetisation together with the temperature dependence of both the remanent magnetisation and the viscosity coefficient. These all showed good agreement with previous work as did the results for the magnetisation decay of a small area of film. The linear transverse susceptibility of <b>particulate</b> recording <b>media.</b> Calculations have been made for a set of non-interacting Stoner-Wohlfarth particles. The introduction of both angular and magnitude distributions for the anisotropy yielded some very interesting results. Calculations were made for a range of differently textured systems.

40|$|While {{tribology}} {{involves the}} study of friction, wear, and lubrication of interacting surfaces, the tribosurfaces are the pair of surfaces in sliding contact with a fluid (or <b>particulate)</b> <b>media</b> between them. The ubiquitous nature of tribology {{is evident from the}} usage of its principles in all aspects of life, such as the friction promoting behavior of shoes on slippery water-lubricated walkways and tires on roadways to the wear of fingernails during filing or engine walls during operations. These tribosurface interfaces, due to the small length scales, are difficult to model for contact mechanics, fluid mechanics and particle dynamics, be it via theory, experiments or computations. Also, there is no simple constitutive law for a tribosurface with a <b>particulate</b> <b>media.</b> Thus, when trying to model such a tribosurface, {{there is a need to}} calibrate the <b>particulate</b> <b>media</b> against one or more property characterizing experiments. Such a calibrated media, which is the “virtual avatar” of the real <b>particulate</b> <b>media,</b> can then be used to provide predictions about its behavior in engineering applications. This thesis proposes and attempts to validate an approach that leverages experiments and modeling, which comprises of physics-based modeling and machine learning enabled surrogate modeling, to study <b>particulate</b> <b>media</b> in two key particle matrix industries: metal powder-bed additive manufacturing (in Part II), and energy resource rock drilling (in Part III). The physics-based modeling framework developed in this thesis is called the Particle-Surface Tribology Analysis Code (P-STAC) and has the physics of particle dynamics, fluid mechanics and particle-fluid-structure interaction. The Computational Particle Dynamics (CPD) is solved by using the industry standard Discrete Element Method (DEM) and the Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is solved by using finite difference discretization scheme based on Chorin 2 ̆ 7 s projection method and staggered grids. Particle-structure interactions are accounted for by using a state-of-the art Particle Tessellated Surface Interaction Scheme and the fluid-structure interaction is accounted for by using the Immersed Boundary Method (IBM). Surrogate modeling is carried out using back propagation neural network. The tribosurface interactions encountered during the spreading step of the powder-bed additive manufacturing (AM) process which involve a sliding spreader (rolling and sliding for a roller) and <b>particulate</b> <b>media</b> consisting of metal AM powder, have been studied in Part II. To understand the constitutive behavior of metal AM powders, detailed rheometry experiments have been conducted in Chapter 5. CPD module of P-STAC is used to simulate the rheometry of an industry grade AM powder (100 - 250 microns Ti- 6 Al- 4 V), to determine a calibrated virtual avatar of the real AM powder (Chapter 6). This monodispersed virtual avatar is used to perform virtual spreading on smooth and rough substrates in Chapter 7. The effect of polydispersity in DEM modeling is studied in Chapter 8. A polydispersed virtual avatar of the aforementioned AM powder has been observed to provide better validation against single layer spreading experiments than the monodispersed virtual avatar. This experimentally validated polydispersed virtual avatar has been used to perform a battery of spreading simulations covering the range of spreader speeds. Then a machine learning enabled surrogate model, using back propagation neural network, has been trained to study the spreading results generated by P-STAC and provide much more data by performing regression. This surrogate model is used to generate spreading process maps linking the 3 D printer inputs of spreader speeds to spread layer properties of roughness and porosity. Such maps (Chapters 7 and 8) can be used by a 3 D-printer technician to determine the spreader speed setting which corresponds to the desired spread layer properties and has the maximum spread throughout. The tribosurface interactions encountered during the drilling of energy resource rocks which involve a rotary and impacting contact of the drill bit with the rock formation in the presence of drilling fluids have been studied in Part III. This problem involves sliding surfaces with fluid (drilling mud) and <b>particulate</b> <b>media</b> (intact and drilled rock particles). Again, like the AM powder, the <b>particulate</b> <b>media,</b> viz. the rock formation being drilled into, does not have a simple and a well-defined constitutive law. An index test detailed in ASTM D 5731 can be used as a characterization test while trying to model a rock using bonded particle DEM. A model to generate weak concrete-like virtual rock which can be considered to be a mathematical representation of a sandstone has been introduced in Chapter 10. Benchtop drilling experiments have been carried out on two sandstones (Castlegate sandstone from the energy rich state of Texas and Crab Orchard sandstone from Tennessee) in Chapter 11. Virtual drilling has been carried out on the aforementioned weak concrete-like virtual rock. The rate of penetration (RoP) of the drill bit has been found to be directly proportional to the weight on bit (WoB). The drilling in dry conditions resulted in a higher RoP than the one which involved the use of water as the drilling fluid. P-SATC with the bonded DEM and CFD modules was able to predict both these findings but only qualitatively (Chapter 11...|$|E

40|$|The soil-structure {{interface}} {{is fundamental}} {{to the performance of}} many geotechnical engineering systems; including penetration test devices, deep foundations, and retaining structures. In geotechnical engineering structures, the counterface may range from a polymer {{in the case of a}} geosynthetically reinforced earth retaining structure to steel for cone penetration testing or pile foundations. Interface strength is affected by many factors, among which surface roughness is the most dominant. To date common practice has been to characterize counterface surface roughness by a roughness parameter based on only its spatial properties and soil roughness separately by various incompatible means resulting in two roughness values unrelated to each other. The vast number of analyzing methods and developed parameters reveal the general confusion regarding this concept. Rather than analyzing the <b>particulate</b> and continuum <b>media</b> separately, it is compulsory to coalesce the analysis and quantify the relative nature of interface behavior. This can be accomplished by examining the <b>particulate</b> and continuum <b>media</b> through the same powerful tools. The motive of this study is to develop a unified approach to determining the index properties of particles and surfaces in a particle-surface interface. This is accomplished by examining several particle shape and surface roughness parameters in terms of their ability to uniquely describe and distinguish particulate medium and continuum roughness, respectively. In this study, surfaces are analyzed as derived particles by wrapping surface profiles and particles are evaluated as derived surfaces via unrolling particle outlines. In addition, particle shape parameters are modified to allow surface roughness analysis and surface roughness parameters are modified to characterize particle shape. A unified approach for particulate shape and continuum roughness would ultimately lead to a better understanding of micro-scale interaction mechanism and better quantification of macro-scale mobilized resistance for soil and engineering surface interaction.

The general two-dimensional model allows analysis of various recording head configurations; a single pole head, a ring head, a dual stripe head and a differential head. The analysis accommodates both longitudinal recording (with no soft magnetic underlayer present) and perpendicular recording (in {{the presence of a}} soft underlayer). Typical field, spectral response function and output voltage pulse plots for double-element MR heads are given and compared to published, approximate solutions. The integrals arising in the determination of the Fourier series coefficients, magnetic potential and magnetic field components are expressed either as rapidly convergent infinite series or in terms of special functions to provide a more efficient means of evaluation than numerical integration. It is shown that, in many situations, it is only necessary to take the first Fourier coefficient in the calculation of output voltage pulse shapes in order to achieve sufficiently accurate results. Bi-variate regression techniques are used to provide a convenient method to approximate the first Fourier series coefficient for a broad range of typical head dimensions. The thesis goes on to examine high speed switching behaviour in two classes of recording media by considering two different particle orientation distributions; 2 D random media - intended to simulate a modern thin film rigid disk, and 3 D oriented media- simulating a single domain <b>particulate</b> tape <b>media.</b> The gyromagnetic switching constant of a medium is calculated directly from the Landau - Lifshitz - Gilbert (L-L-G) equation of motion, which is solved numerically. The switching constants produced are discussed and compared with published experimental values for different media. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|In {{addition}} to {{previous research on}} the magnetization reversal for sputtered CoCr films, two <b>particulate</b> perpendicular recording <b>media,</b> namely Ba-ferrite and Alumite have been measured. For comparison an isotropic Ba-ferrite sample and an in-plane g Fe 2 O 3 magnetic tape have also been evaluated. Only a few properties are compared which have been determined from the field- and angle-dependent VSM measurements. It was discovered for high Hc/Hk CoCr films and the orientated Ba-ferrite media, in which the perpendicular anisotropy mainly results from crystalline anisotropy, that the magnetization reversal is mainly controlled by a Cos-type of incoherent rotation. On the other hand, for a magnetic tape having a high longitudinal orientation ratio, the magnetization reversal {{is determined by the}} curling-type of incoherent rotation. The isotropic Ba-ferrite media exhibit rather good in-plane characteristics. For Alumite (an array of Fe needles) {{it was found that the}} measured reduced coercivity vs. reduced diameter fit very well with the theoretical curling mode. But if the applied field deviates from the film normal, the magnetization reversal can be interpreted rom the superposition of Cos-type of incoherent rotation and a contribution from the demagnetizing field and dipole-dipole field...|$|R
40|$|The air {{revitalization}} system {{aboard the}} International Space Station (ISS) provides the vital function {{of maintaining a}} clean cabin environment for the crew and the hardware. This becomes a serious challenge in pressurized space compartments since no outside air ventilation is possible, and a larger particulate load is imposed on the filtration system {{due to lack of}} sedimentation due to the microgravity environment in Low Earth Orbit (LEO). The ISS Environmental Control and Life Support (ECLS) system architecture in the U. S. Segment uses a distributed particulate filtration approach consisting of traditional High-Efficiency <b>Particulate</b> Adsorption (HEPA) <b>media</b> filters deployed at multiple locations in each U. S. Segment module; these filters are referred to as Bacterial Filter Elements, or BFEs. These filters see a replacement interval, as part of maintenance, of 2 - 5 years dependent on location in the ISS. In this work, we present particulate removal efficiency, pressure drop, and leak test results for a sample set of 8 BFEs returned from the ISS after filter replacement. The results can potentially be utilized by the ISS Program to ascertain whether the present replacement interval can be maintained or extended to balance the on-ground filter inventory with extension of the lifetime of ISS beyond 2024. These results can also provide meaningful guidance for particulate filter designs under consideration for future deep space exploration missions...|$|R
