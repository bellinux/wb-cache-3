5|$|Vanadium traces in diesel fuels are {{the main}} fuel {{component}} in high temperature corrosion. During combustion, vanadium oxidizes and reacts with sodium and sulfur, yielding vanadate compounds with melting points as low as 530°C, which attack the <b>passivation</b> <b>layer</b> on steel and render it susceptible to corrosion. The solid vanadium compounds also abrade engine components.|$|E

As a <b>passivation</b> <b>layer</b> for microchips, it is superior to silicon dioxide, {{as it is a}} significantly better diffusion barrier against water molecules and sodium ions, two major sources of corrosion and instability in microelectronics. It is also used as a dielectric between polysilicon layers in capacitors in analog chips.|$|E
40|$|Waveguide {{structures}} of the stand-alone electroabsorption (EA) modulator and the electro-absorption modulated laser (EML) are investigated using the 3 D beam propagation method. The EA waveguide structures with InP-based <b>passivation</b> <b>layers</b> show saturation in the extinction ratio (ER) due to the stray light traveling through the <b>passivation</b> <b>layers.</b> This paper demonstrates that narrower <b>passivation</b> <b>layers</b> suppress stray-light excitation in the EA waveguide, increasing the ER. A taper structure in the isolation section of the EML waveguide can reduce the mode mismatch and suppress the excitation of the stray light, increasing the ER further. Low-index-polymer <b>passivation</b> <b>layers</b> can confine the mode more tightly in the active waveguide, yielding an even higher ER...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{characterizes the}} {{adhesion}} quality of evaporated aluminum rear metallization on rear <b>passivation</b> <b>layers</b> of silicon solar cells. A peel-test is introduced for adhesion rating and the adhesion quality between various Al and <b>passivation</b> <b>layers</b> on test structures is compared and discussed. The {{results show that}} the adhesion strongly varies with passivation type and evaporation parameters. Strong adherence is attributed to the formation of a strongly bonded, extended interphase layer. We derive factors that influence adhesion quality on our sample structures and find that an intimate contact between the layers and elevated temperatures are very important parameters. Additionally, a sufficiently high adhesion quality for an evaporated rear metallization of passivated emitter and rear cells (PERC) is achieved for all investigated <b>passivation</b> <b>layers...</b>|$|R
25|$|Aluminium oxide is {{responsible}} for the resistance of metallic aluminium to weathering. Metallic aluminium is very reactive with atmospheric oxygen, and a thin <b>passivation</b> <b>layer</b> of aluminium oxide (4nm thickness) forms on any exposed aluminium surface. This layer protects the metal from further oxidation. The thickness and properties of this oxide layer can be enhanced using a process called anodising. A number of alloys, such as aluminium bronzes, exploit this property by including a proportion of aluminium in the alloy to enhance corrosion resistance. The aluminium oxide generated by anodising is typically amorphous, but discharge assisted oxidation processes such as plasma electrolytic oxidation result in a significant proportion of crystalline aluminium oxide in the coating, enhancing its hardness.|$|E
500|$|Vanadium is a medium-hard, ductile, steel-blue metal. Some sources {{describe}} vanadium as [...] "soft", {{perhaps because}} it is ductile, malleable and not brittle. Vanadium is harder than most metals and steels (see Hardnesses of the elements (data page) and iron). It has good resistance to corrosion and it is stable against alkalis and sulfuric and hydrochloric acids. It is oxidized in air at about 933K (660°C, 1220°F), although an oxide <b>passivation</b> <b>layer</b> forms even at room temperature.|$|E
500|$|Cubic {{boron nitride}} (CBN or c-BN) {{is widely used}} as an abrasive. Its {{usefulness}} arises from its insolubility in iron, nickel, and related alloys at high temperatures, whereas diamond is soluble in these metals to give carbides. Polycrystalline c-BN (PCBN) abrasives are therefore used for machining steel, whereas diamond abrasives are preferred for aluminum alloys, ceramics, and stone. When in contact with oxygen at high temperatures, BN forms a <b>passivation</b> <b>layer</b> of boron oxide. Boron nitride binds well with metals, due to formation of interlayers of metal borides or nitrides. Materials with cubic boron nitride crystals are often used in the tool bits of cutting tools. For grinding applications, softer binders, e.g. resin, porous ceramics, and soft metals, are used. Ceramic binders {{can be used as}} well. Commercial products are known under names [...] "Borazon" [...] (by Diamond Innovations), and [...] "Elbor" [...] or [...] "Cubonite" [...] (by Russian vendors).|$|E
40|$|An {{important}} {{approach for}} solving the world's sustainable energy challenges is {{the conversion of}} solar energy to chemical fuels. Semiconductors {{can be used to}} convert/store solar energy to chemical bonds in an energy-dense fuel. Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water-splitting cells, with semiconductor electrodes, use sunlight and water to generate hydrogen. Herein, recent studies on improving the efficiency of semiconductor-based solar water-splitting devices by the introduction of surface <b>passivation</b> <b>layers</b> are reviewed. We show that <b>passivation</b> <b>layers</b> have been used as an effective strategy to improve the charge-separation and transfer processes across semiconductor–liquid interfaces, and thereby increase overall solar energy conversion efficiencies. We also summarize the demonstrated passivation effects brought by these thin layers, which include reducing charge recombination at surface states, increasing the reaction kinetics, and protecting the semiconductor from chemical corrosion.

Through measurements and calculated results, it is shown that attenuation {{is dominated by}} conductor loss if silicon substrates with a resistivity greater than 2500 Ohm-cm are used. Si <b>passivation</b> <b>layers</b> affect the transmission line attenuation; however, measured results demonstrate that <b>passivation</b> <b>layers</b> do not necessarily increase attenuation. If standard, low resistivity Si wafers must be used, alternative transmission lines such as thin film microstrip and Co-Planar Waveguide (CPW) on thick polyimide layers must be used. Measured results presented here show that low loss per unit length is achievable with these transmission lines...|$|R

More recent investigations of typical multi-layered electronic devices have uncovered that CTR is also influenced dramatically by the presence of a surface <b>passivation</b> (transparent) <b>layer.</b> It is believed that the effective CTR is made up of a combination of an intrinsic value and a contribution resulting from the interference of the light beams reflecting from the interfaces of the layers in the light path.
