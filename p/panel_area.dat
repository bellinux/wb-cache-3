5000|$|At {{approximately}} 9 p.m. on Wednesday, July 24, the eighteen miners were {{in danger}} 240 ft underground, below the fields of Dormel Farm when the flooded Saxman mine was breached as the mining progressed eastward. Water had broken through the face and was inundating the entry, and the nine miners in the 1-Left <b>panel</b> <b>area</b> used the mine's phone system to notify the other group of nine miners in the 2-Left panel to evacuate immediately. These miners were able to escape at around 9:45 p.m. and alert others, and a 911 call was made at 9:53 p.m. However, the mine was flooding too rapidly for the miners in the 1-Left <b>panel</b> <b>area</b> to evacuate. Twice they tried to travel in the four-foot-high tunnels over 3,000 ft to a shaft that would lead them to the surface, but these were also flooded. Back on the surface, Pennsylvania State Police were guarding the Quecreek mine site by 10:30 p.m., and instructed reporters {{to go to the}} local church for a press conference scheduled to occur later that night. State Police Cpl. Robert Barnes Jr. also telephoned families of missing miners asking them to come to the Sipesville firehouse for more information. Around 11 p.m., Barnes also asked United Methodist pastor, Barry Ritenour, if he could spend the night at the firehouse with the families. In addition, calls were made between 11:30 PM and 12 AM to find a drill that could bore a hole big enough to raise men from a mine. One was located in Clarksburg, West Virginia.|$|E

50|$|The Columbia 400 was marketed with an {{optional}} ice protection system, known as E-Vade {{that was not}} certified for flight into known icing. The system consists of heat-conducting graphite foil panels on the wing and tail leading edges.

50|$|The {{collector}} {{panels are}} usually {{mounted on a}} nearby roof, or ground-mounted on a tilted rack. Due to the low temperature difference between {{the air and the}} water, the panels are often formed collectors or unglazed flat plate collectors. A simple rule-of-thumb for the required <b>panel</b> <b>area</b> needed is 50% of the pool's surface area. This is for areas where pools are used in the summer season only. Adding solar collectors to a conventional outdoor pool, in a cold climate, can typically extend the pool's comfortable usage by months and more if an insulating pool cover is used. An active solar energy system analysis program may be used to optimize the solar pool heating system before it is built.|$|E

Eliminating the glovebox and minimizing the instrument panel allows shifting the front passenger about six-inches ahead of the driver’s seating position. In turn, the second inside passenger, sitting in tandem behind the inside passenger, has approximately the same leg, shoulder, and headroom as the front passenger. The Kabura includes a secondary passenger-side door, allowing easier access to the seat behind the front passenger.

5000|$|After World War II {{the company}} was renamed Panhard (without [...] "Levassor"), and {{produced}} light cars such as the Dyna X, Dyna Z, PL 17, 24 CT and 24 BT. The company had long noted the weight advantages of aluminum, and this as well as postwar government steel rationing (designed to limit new car models to ensure an orderly return to production at the major firms), encouraged the firm {{to proceed with the}} expensive alternative of making the bodies and several other components out of aluminum; thus the Dyna X and early Dyna Z series 1 had aluminum bodies. Unfortunately, cost calculations by Jean Panhard himself, inheriting son and managing director of the firm, failed to account fully for all of the extra cost of aluminum vs steel, as his calculation were made for the sheet metal <b>panel</b> <b>area</b> actually utilized per body shell, and erroneously did not account for the cut offs and scrap of each of the stampings making up the shell. Once in production, a re-examination cost analysis showed a cost of 55,700fr for aluminum shells and only 15,600fr for steel. The use of aluminum had pushed the firm perilously close to bankruptcy, and a rush engineering job saw the firm return to steel. Thus, the later Dyna Z (from mid September 1955) and the successor PL 17 bodies were steel, and the major stampings retained the heavier gauge intended for durability with aluminum, so as to avoid complete replacement of the stamping dies.|$|E

As shown in Fig.  3 c, the required area of the solar panel (As) increases {{with the number of}} stories (N) to achieve the energy balance from Eq. (18). When the number of stories is larger than 10, the required solar <b>panel</b> <b>area</b> (As) typically exceeds the available roof area (i.e., As/A[*]>[*] 1.0). Therefore, this paper focuses on the residential building with the number of stories not more than 10.|$|E
