Our results show that use of the IsGroupOf <b>protocol</b> data <b>units</b> can reduce wide area network bandwidth by as much as 80 - 90 %.

40|$|The {{performance}} of distributed systems depends {{heavily on the}} design of interprocess communication facilities of the underlying system architecture. In this paper we aim towards an optimal communication protocol for distributed system architectures. Thus we present different approaches of the logical structure of the protocol of the interprocess communication (IPC) systems and analyze the resulting runtime behavior heuristically. We introduce the notion of a logical <b>protocol</b> <b>unit</b> (LPU). An LPU groups all basic operations (or actions) of the system logically into units, which are transferred in one single block via the interprocess communication facilities of the underlying operating system. An algorithm for the calculation of specific LPUs for software applications in practice is presented. It is shown heuristically that the overall {{performance of}} real systems can be improved dramatically by the employment of different protocol structures based on the LPU approach.

In this paper different approaches of the logical structure of the protocol of the IPC communication are proposed and analyzed. The term of a logical <b>protocol</b> <b>unit</b> (LPU) is defined. All basic actions of the software system are logically grouped into units and transferred jointly via the interprocess communication facilities of the underlying operating system.

Objective: To analyze the implantation of Plans of Taken care of in the medical units of the Hospital Santa Barbara of Soria through GACELA Care. Material and Method: Observational, descriptive, retrospective and cross. 776 events were analyzed. Study variables, patients with care plans, with <b>protocol</b> <b>unit</b> admission and self-care, nursing diagnoses, potential complications, and outcomes assessment at admission and discharge. Result:Of the 776 episodes analyzed, 74. 48 % had a correct record of PC. There were a total of 1070 DDE in all units of which 526 are real DdE (49. 15 %), while 544 are at risk (50. 84 %). DdE most prevalent is the risk of infection. The CPO registration is more often was pain. Of the 578 episodes that were recorded on the PC either three units, only 131 {{of them had been}} measured indicators of patient admission (22. 66 %).

Where by using this tool, unnecessary purchases inscribe handphone number that want to loaded the voucher, but purchases can do recharge voucher self. This tool is made based on error quantity that make by seller and or purchases. Error that caused by at the purchase writing handphone number, sometimes the writing can’t or wrong seller interprets number that written. Using handphone that can communicated according to serial and facilities SMS (short message service) serve the purpose of data control. Use microcontroller ATMEL AT 89 S 8252 as data processor, to do recharge electronik voucher.
