25|$|The {{provision}} of a lighthouse {{is a standard}} example of a public good, since {{it is difficult to}} exclude ships from using its services. No ship's use detracts from that of others, but since most of the benefit of a lighthouse accrues to ships using particular ports, lighthouse maintenance can be profitably bundled with <b>port</b> <b>fees</b> (Ronald Coase, The Lighthouse in Economics 1974). This has been sufficient to fund actual lighthouses.|$|E
25|$|Rather than cargo, modern pirates have {{targeted}} the personal belongings {{of the crew}} and {{the contents of the}} ship's safe, which potentially contains large amounts of cash needed for payroll and <b>port</b> <b>fees.</b> In other cases, the pirates force the crew off the ship and then sail it to a port to be repainted and given a new identity through false papers purchased from corrupt or complicit officials.|$|E
25|$|The most {{important}} {{move to a}} market-oriented exchange rate was an easing of controls on trade and other current account transactions, as occurred in several very early steps. In 1979 the State Council approved a system allowing exporters and their provincial and local government owners to retain a share of their foreign exchange earnings, referred to as foreign exchange quotas. At the same time, the government introduced measures to allow retention of part of the foreign exchange earnings from non-trade sources, such as overseas remittances, <b>port</b> <b>fees</b> paid by foreign vessels, and tourism.|$|E

5000|$|By {{the fall}} of the Carolingian Empire, the area was part of Lotharingia and later part of the County of Provence. In 1295, Charles II, Duke of Anjou, then Count of Provence, enticed the {{inhabitants}} of Montolivo and surroundings to settle closer to the coastline in order to secure the area from pirates. By charter, he established Villefranche as a [...] "free port", thus the name, granting tax privileges and <b>port</b> <b>fee</b> rights that lasted well into the 18th century.|$|R
50|$|Most {{commercial}} Internet transit agreements {{require a}} minimum traffic commitment level, which the customer must pay regardless if their usage is below that point.

As a not-for-profit, TorIX charges a small <b>port</b> <b>fee</b> based on {{the speed of the}} port the member desires, rather than the amount of traffic traveling over TorIX. The more traffic, the better, but peers are not penalized for lower traffic levels.|$|R
25|$|At {{the end of}} 1997, Lion King {{was sold}} to Tallink, who renamed her MS Fantaasia and placed her on the Helsinki–Tallinn route (where she served {{alongside}} her old Viking Line fleetmate MS Meloodia). In 2002, after the delivery of the new MS Romantika, the Fantaasia {{was moved to the}} Tallinn–Stockholm route, where she sailed alongside another old fleetmate from the Viking Line days, MS Regina Baltica. In 2004, the new MS Victoria I replaced Fantaasia on the Tallinn–Stockholm route, and from the start of April of the same year Fantaasia opened a new Helsinki–Tallinn–St. Petersburg route for Tallink. Due to a rise in <b>port</b> <b>fees</b> issued by the Russian government and due to visa regulations not being prognosed to get any better between Russia and the European Union as it had been presumed when the line was started, the line was terminated by Tallink on 2 January 2005.|$|E
500|$|The {{leaders of}} the colony {{decided to leave the}} smaller Speedwell behind after {{numerous}} delays caused by leaking, which had caused them to return to port twice. The Standishes and most of the Speedwell passengers crowded into the Mayflower, and the Speedwell went on to London to be resold, now with only a few passengers. (She subsequently made numerous successful journeys as a cargo vessel for her new owners, but never sailed to the New World.) The Mayflower passengers, meanwhile, sold some valuable supplies such as butter to pay the mounting <b>port</b> <b>fees,</b> and finally departed Plymouth, England on September 6, 1620, bound for {{the northern part of the}} Virginia Colony.|$|E
500|$|The {{departure}} of the Mayflower and Speedwell for America was beset by delays. Further disagreements with the Merchant Adventurers held up the departure in Southampton. A total of 120 passengers finally departed on August 5—90 on the Mayflower and 30 on the Speedwell. Leaving Southampton, the Speedwell suffered significant leakage, which required the ships to immediately put in at Dartmouth. The leakage was partly caused by being overmasted and being pressed too much with sail. Repairs were completed, and a further delay ensued as they awaited favorable winds. The two ships finally set sail on August 23; they traveled only two hundred miles beyond Land's End before another major leak in the Speedwell forced the expedition to return again to England, this time to the port of Plymouth. The Speedwell {{was found to be}} unseaworthy; some passengers abandoned their attempt to emigrate, while others joined the Mayflower, crowding the already heavily burdened ship. Later, it was speculated that the crew of the Speedwell had intentionally sabotaged the ship to avoid having to make the treacherous trans-Atlantic voyage. The delays had significant consequences; the cost of the repairs and <b>port</b> <b>fees</b> required that the colonists sell some of their invaluable provisions. More importantly, the delays meant that everyone had to spend the entire winter on board the Mayflower off Cape Cod in what could only be described as squalid conditions.|$|E

2500|$|On 30 December, Mi Amigo was towed to IJmuiden by {{the tender}} Euro Trip. Permission to enter port was {{initially}} refused as Mi Amigo had no papers. Assurances were given that <b>port</b> <b>fees</b> would be paid, and Mi Amigo {{was allowed to}} dock in Amsterdam. Officers from the Dutch Radio Controle Dienst [...] boarded the ship, but her transmitting equipment was not confiscated as it was incomplete. Member of the Scheepvaartinspectie declared that the MV Mi Amigo was unseaworthy and ordered repairs to be made. At court in Haarlem, an injunction was granted to the captain of Mi Amigo and the ship was impounded. On 1 January 1973, two tugs towed Mi Amigo to IJmuiden where the Scheepvaarinspectie ordered that a leak in the engine room was repaired, giving the crew just two hours to complete the task. Early the next day, outstanding monies were paid, and Mi Amigo was allowed to sail.|$|E

40|$|This article {{assesses the}} 2009 {{amendments}} to the Polish Telecommunications Law and the most significant executive regulations that have been passed in its context. The amendments are discussed considering their compliance with EU law, {{taking into account the}} rulings of the European Court of Justice on the conformity of some of the Polish provisions with the set of directives constituting the European telecommunications regulatory framework of 2002. The analyzed amendments relate to, in particular, the manner in which ex ante regulation should be implemented, the principles of telecoms services provision to end-users and the performance of state security and defence obligations (the implementation of Directive 2006 / 24 /EC on Data Retention). Furthermore, the article contains an analysis of key Polish caselaw issued in 2009 with respect to the telecoms field covering the most controversial cases decided in that period by both, domestic administrative courts as well as the Supreme Court. The jurisprudence under consideration concerns the following regulatory issues: (1) number <b>porting</b> <b>fees,</b> (2) the term for the expiration of claims regarding the provision of telecoms services as well as, (3) the appropriate procedure to be followed when appealing certain decisions of the National Regulatory Authority relating to the performance of regulatory obligations. The lack of a clear distinction of procedural competences of civil as opposed to administrative courts in this latter regard is shown. The article also covers the ruling of the Court of Justice of 1 July 2010 issued in response to a preliminary reference submitted by the Polish Supreme Court concerning the establishment of number <b>porting</b> <b>fees</b> (case C- 99 / 09).

50|$|The {{original}} Atlanta Internet Exchange {{was created}} in February 1997 by Bay Networks, Epoch Networks, Siemens Business Services, and GridNet. Then known as AIX, the peering point provided 10BaseT, T1 and DS3 connectivity. The AIX was located within the Atlanta POP of Epoch Networks. AIX never became a popular Internet Exchange Point, {{in part due to}} the high re-occurring costs of connecting to the switch. In March 2000, Michael Lucking, then an employee of Epoch Networks, now incarcerated for murder, decommissioned the equipment. In mid-2003, while meeting with a group of other peering coordinators in the Atlanta Area, Michael decided to resurrect the exchange. By August 2003, Michael had worked a deal with 56 Marietta Street Partners to provide space and power, WV Fiber (Now Host.net) to provide the first switch and cabling, and GreatAccess.com to provide domain hosting, and any costs for domain names and IP address registration fees. The new AtlantaIX operated at no expense to participants. In January 2007, Michael provided a second switch capable of supporting 10 Gigabit Ethernet connections. The AtlantaIX then began charging a one time <b>port</b> <b>fee</b> to aid in paying back the costs of the recently upgraded switch infrastructure.|$|R
