This study was aimed to estimate current levels of <b>pollution</b> <b>indicator</b> {{as well as many}} groups of human pathogenic bacteria and their seasonal variations in different locations in Mandovi and Zuari Rivers in the central west coast of India.

Both the {{abundance and}} types of autochthonous and allochthonous microbial populations in the near shore environments are affected by land drainages, domestic sewage outfalls and other discharges.

40|$|On {{the basis}} of total {{temperature}} increase, normal dehydration, and maturity, the odor compositions of surface and internal piles in a well-run sewage sludge compost plant were analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry with a liquid nitrogen cooling system and a portable odor detector. Approximately 80 types of substances were detected, including 2 volatile inorganic compounds, 4 sulfur organic compounds, 16 benzenes, 27 alkanes, 15 alkenes, and 19 halogenated compounds. Most pollutants were mainly produced in the mesophilic and pre-thermophilic periods. The sulfur volatile organic compounds contributed significantly to odor and should be controlled primarily. Treatment strategies {{should be based on}} the properties of sulfur organic compounds. Hydrogen sulfide, methyl mercaptan, dimethyl disulfide, dimethyl sulfide, ammonia, and carbon disulfide were selected as core indicators. Ammonia, hydrogen sulfide, carbon disulfide, dimethyl disulfide, methyl mercaptan, dimethylbenzene, phenylpropane, and isopentane were designated as concentration indicators. Benzene, m-xylene, p-xylene, dimethylbenzene, dichloromethane, toluene, chlorobenzene, trichloromethane, carbon tetrachloride, and ethylbenzene were selected as health indicators. According to the principle of odor <b>pollution</b> <b>indicator</b> selection, dimethyl disulfide was selected as an odor <b>pollution</b> <b>indicator</b> of sewage sludge composting. Monitoring dimethyl disulfide provides a highly scientific method for modeling and evaluating odor pollution from sewage sludge composting facilities. Implications: Composting {{is one of the most}} important methods for sewage sludge treatment and improving the low organic matter content of many agricultural soils. However, odors are inevitably produced during the composting process. Understanding the production and emission patterns of odors is important for odor control and treatment. Core indicators, concentration indicators, and health indicators provide an index system to odor evaluation.

We examine four industrial water <b>pollution</b> <b>indicators</b> (wastewater, chemical oxygen demand, hexavalent chromium compounds, and petroleum-like matter) and four industrial air <b>pollution</b> <b>indicators</b> (waste gas, sulphur dioxide, soot and dust).

The share of total output produced by firms from Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan has {{a positive effect on}} emissions although this effect is only significant for three industrial water pollution emissions. The share of total output produced by firms from other foreign economies can be beneficial, detrimental or neutral, depending on the pollutants considered.

40|$|Monitoring of {{effluent}} discharges {{from industrial}} establishments discharging directly into municipality sewers {{is one of}} the major water pollution control activities conducted by municipalities. For largely industrialised municipalities the task can be quite expensive and not effective if sampling programmes are not properly designed. In most cases samples are randomly collected without proper knowledge of the discharge patterns of various industries. As a result the information obtained does not give a good reflection of the quality of effluent being discharged. These problems can be resolved by adapting a statistical approach to the design of sampling programmes. This approach is useful in determining the frequency of sampling, the number of samples needed to estimate the average concentration of target <b>pollution</b> <b>indicator</b> parameters and the magnitude of the uncertainty involved. The benefits and applications of this approach are demonstrated by a case study presented in this paper. It was found that the number of samples and cost of sample analysis can be greatly reduced by the use of systematic instead of random sampling. The statistical approach greatly improves the estimate of monthly means of <b>pollution</b> <b>indicator</b> parameters and is an effective approach for pollution control when coupled with the “polluter pays principle”...|$|E

Sampling points were {{on the basis of}} human and aquatic activities around the lake. Determinations were conducted on-sites with Jenway portable meters for DO; while Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) and Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) were determined by standard methods, respectively. Results show variations in values with season with DO value ranging between (5. 70 + 0. 29 – 6. 66 + 0. 30) with Baga wet season having highest DO (6. 66 + 0. 30 mg/l) and low BOD value of 3. 20 + 0. 21. The BOD was higher during the wet season than the dry season.

The overall goal {{of this paper is}} to estimate whether the impacts of FDI positive or negative on environment in host countries. To meet this overall goal, it is constructed a simultaneous system with data of 28 provinces in China (1992 - 2008). This system supposes the <b>pollution</b> <b>indicators</b> to be determined by economic scale, industrial composition and pollution density of a province, in which pollution density is created to estimate the environmental effect of FDI more exactly than traditional technological character.

Based on a panel data of 28 provinces (1992 - 2008) with the three-stage least squares (3 sls) estimator, the results of the system show that with the domestic investment, the environmental effect is positive, which means that FDI increases pollution emission.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} the compositional analysis of sewage supplied to and {{discharged from the}} wastewater treatment plant in Kolbuszowa Dolna in the Subcarpathian region. The analysis was based on three basic indicators of sewage pollution (BOD 5, COD Cr, total suspended solids) and two biogenic indicators (total nitrogen and total phosphorus). The composition of sewage was studied in the years 2010 – 2015. Basic descriptive statistics for {{the values of the}} analyzed indicators of sewage pollution were summarized and the obtained results were interpreted. The study showed that the sewage was susceptible to biological treatment. Descriptive statistics for the relationship between the following indicators were presented: COD Cr /BOD 5, BOD 5 /N tot, BOD 5 /P tot. The collected results indicate high variability of the composition of sewage entering the studied facility. The coefficients of variation for the values of basic indicators (BOD 5, COD Cr, total suspended solids) in the raw sewage were similar and amounted to W n = 0. 45 while for total nitrogen it was W n = 0. 33 and for total phosphorus W n = 0. 40. The analysis of the collected material showed that sewage entering the treatment plant was readily biodegradable. On the other hand, the treated sewage was characterized by low values of the analyzed indicators, much below the permissible values provided by the water permit. The raw sewage was divided into five groups depending on the concentration of each <b>pollution</b> <b>indicator.</b> The number of raw sewage samples was determined for each group of the analyzed <b>pollution</b> <b>indicator</b> concentrations...|$|E
