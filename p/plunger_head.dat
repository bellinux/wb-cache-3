50|$|The National Poultry Show {{is being}} held, and Daffy Duck {{looks at the}} matinee showing the prizes for the judging. The first prize for best rooster is $5000, and the best duck is $5. Daffy, having {{traveled}} {{all the way from}} Dubuque for the contest, is outraged that ducks rate such a low prize and decides to disguise himself as a rooster (using rubber gloves and the tail feathers of another rooster, affixed through a <b>plunger</b> <b>head)</b> to get $5000. Meanwhile, Henery is being taught all about roosters by his father, George K. (or G.K.) Chickenhawk (a reference to G.K. Chesterton). Henery decides to head to the poultry show and catch himself a rooster.|$|E
40|$|A {{push type}} {{fastener}} for fastening a movable structural part (41) to a fixed structural part (43), wherein the coupling and decoupling actions are both a push type operation, the fastener {{consisting of a}} plunger (12) having a shank (20) with a <b>plunger</b> <b>head</b> (18) {{at one end and}} a threaded end portion (26 a) at the other end, an expandable grommet (14) adapted to receive the plunger shank (20) therethrough, and an attachable head (16) which is securable to the threaded end of the plunger shank (20). The fastener (10) requires each structural part (41, 43) to be provided with an aperture (45, 46) and the attachable head (16) to be smaller than the aperture (46) in the second structural part. The plunger (12) is extensible through the grommet (14) and is structurally configured with an external camming surface (25) which is cooperatively engageable with internal surfaces (38) of the grommet so that when the plunger is inserted in the grommet, the relative positioning of said cooperable camming surfaces determines the expansion of the grommet. Coupling of the parts is effected when the grommet is inserted in the aperture (46) in the fixed structural part (43) and expanded by pushing the <b>plunger</b> <b>head</b> (18) and plunger at least a minimal distance through the grommet. Decoupling is effected by pushing the attachable head (16) ...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{describe}} about modifying {{of engine}} from four stroke engines to six stroke engines. Two more additional strokes are the fifth stroke, which called water injection stroke while the last stroke is called exhaust stroke. Besides, the stroke engine {{also known as}} engine two-stroke, four-stroke and also six-stroke which are new things for us. Some modification has {{to do at the}} conventional four-stroke to six-stroke. Whereas some of them are modification at the camshaft, which is gear to contact between camshaft and crankshaft with ratio 3 : 1, shape of <b>plunger,</b> <b>head</b> cover engine and add more other components such as water injector and pump to make the system operate well. After the modification, performance results outcomes are compare with the conventional four-stroke engines. Unfortunately, this engine is not running as well as expected when some problems occur at few part of the engine. To fix the entire problems, analysis has been undertaken to improve some part of the followers, especially since his main problems in their engines. For the future work, the follower must be upgrading the level to get the best design and strength to make sure this engine running well...|$|E
40|$|Precision Agriculture is {{continuously}} {{trying to}} address the sources and factors affecting the in-field variability and taking appropriate managerial decisions. One of the popular research focuses in the recent three decades {{has been on the}} development of new approaches to making yield variability maps. Advancement in development of sensors and the importance of quality factor in high value crops has motivated scientists to investigate real-time and nondestructive testing methods. This study tried to introduce and evaluate a new approach to concurrent yield mapping and to estimate some nutritional qualitative factors of alfalfa production. In this study, yield quantity was determined by measurement of added hay slice in every hay compression cycle by employing a new star wheel and integrating its output with positioning data from Global Positioning System. To predict some nutritional quality properties, measurement of specific shear energy applied on the cutting blade and compressive energy on <b>plunger</b> <b>head</b> of a hay baler in field conditions were also evaluated. The results of statistical analysis of yield quantity measurement data showed a very good correlation between the suggested approach and yield mass (r= 0. 96 and R 2 = 0. 92). The results of using specific shear energy for estimation of crude fiber and cumulative index RFV with regard to field conditions were rated as acceptable. Using specific compression energy was suitable only for estimating the dry matter. None of the suggested methods was able to estimate the hay crude protein. Further investigations at more extensive variations of quality indices and alfalfa varieties are suggested...|$|E
30|$|Figure  8 {{shows that}} the whole process is divided into 6 parts: during 0 – 25, 329  min (the 1 – 1101 groups of samples), it is the normal status. In this period, the variety of DCSE is faint and stable; During 25, 330 – 29, 284  min (the 1102 – 1273 groups of samples), the period is the mild wear status (F 1). In this stage, the {{friction}} pairs in the hydraulic pump {{had been working for}} a long time in the accelerated condition. Signs of abrasion occurred because of the continuous friction. Therefore, DCSE tends to decrease; During 29, 285 – 31, 548  min (the 1274 – 1372 groups of samples), it is the slow development status (F 2). In this period, the decreasing trend of DCSE become more obvious caused by the aggravation of the continuous friction between the friction pair; during 31, 549 – 33, 416  min (the 1373 – 1453 groups of samples), it is the initial degradation status (F 3). There had been signs of some failure mode along with the aggravation of friction. The variety of DCSE is violent and it tends to be momentary steady; During 33, 417 – 34, 439  min (the 1454 – 1497 groups of samples), it is the accelerated degradation status (F 4). Since the moment coefficient of the friction pairs became larger, the oil slick became thinner and the fitting clearance became longer. As a result, there were oil leakage and the performance parameters of the pump changed severely. Therefore, DCSE continues decreasing with obvious fluctuation; during 34, 440 – 37, 214  min (the 1498 – 1619 groups of samples), it is the loose slipper status (F 5). The metallic particles in the hydraulic fluid had entered into the fitting clearance between the piston cap and the <b>plunger</b> <b>head,</b> which greatly aggravated the friction of the slipper pair. The hydraulic pump performance in this stage can hardly meet the engineering requirements. Therefore, DCSE in this period appears with severe fluctuations.|$|E
40|$|Caterpillars {{are very}} {{successful}} soft-bodied climbers that navigate in complex environments. This paper develops a multi-segmented robot climbing on vertical surfaces using dry adhesive pads, inspired by caterpillar locomotion. The miniaturized robot {{consists of four}} segments, and each segment uses a solenoid actuator with a permanent magnet <b>plunger.</b> The <b>head</b> and body segments adapt a novel mechanism and Scott-Russell linkages to generate a bi-directional plane motion using one solenoid actuator, resulting to reliable attaching and peeling motions of gecko pads. A tail is also attached {{at the back of}} the last segment to avoid falling or exhibiting unstable motion. Gecko-inspired adhesive pads are fabricated from polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) with the area of 20 mm x 10 mm. We have conducted experiments on the locomotion performance of the segment robot climbing vertical surfaces for two types of locomotion, achieving the fast and stable climbing motion...|$|R

The atomizer for thermal management system includes a housing having a coolant passage and a dispensing end, an orifice within the dispensing end, and an actuator manipulating a plunger within the housing. The <b>plunger</b> includes a <b>head</b> that is sealable within a recessed portion of the orifice to open or close the orifice. The coolant passes through the coolant passage into the orifice for spraying upon a heat producing device. The actuator may reciprocate so that the coolant spray emitted through the orifice is pulsating. The pulsing frequency may be increased to increase cooling or decreased to decrease cooling of the heat producing device...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} study, novel dry-contact sensors for {{measuring}} electro-encephalography (EEG) signals without any skin preparation are designed, fabricated by an injection molding manufacturing process and experimentally validated. Conventional wet electrodes {{are commonly used}} to measure EEG signals; they provide excellent EEG signals subject to proper skin preparation and conductive gel application. However, a series of skin preparation procedures for applying the wet electrodes is always required and usually creates trouble for users. To overcome these drawbacks, novel dry-contact EEG sensors were proposed for potential operation in {{the presence or absence}} of hair and without any skin preparation or conductive gel usage. The dry EEG sensors were designed to contact the scalp surface with 17 spring contact probes. Each probe was designed to include a probe <b>head,</b> <b>plunger,</b> spring, and barrel. The 17 probes were inserted into a flexible substrate using a one-time forming process via an established injection molding procedure. With these 17 spring contact probes, the flexible substrate allows for high geometric conformity between the sensor and the irregular scalp surface to maintain low skin-sensor interface impedance. Additionally, the flexible substrate also initiates a sensor buffer effect, eliminating pain when force is applied. The proposed dry EEG sensor was reliable in measuring EEG signals without any skin preparation or conductive gel usage, as compared with the conventional wet electrodes...|$|R
