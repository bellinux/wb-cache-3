Attempts were made to resolve the situation to the satisfaction of all parties, but these were unsuccessful. The mania finally ended, Mackay says, with individuals stuck with the bulbs they held {{at the end of the}} crash—no court would enforce <b>payment</b> <b>of</b> a contract, since judges regarded the debts as contracted through gambling, and thus not enforceable by law.|$|E
