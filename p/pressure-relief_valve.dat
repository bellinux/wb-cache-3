50|$|Although the {{operating}} pressure was maintained by an automatically controlled bleed valve once the plant had reached steady state, the valve {{could not be used}} during start-up, when there was no air feed, the plant being pressurised with nitrogen. During start-up the bleed valve was normally isolated and there was no route for excess pressure to escape; pressure was kept within acceptable limits (slightly wider that those achieved under automatic control) by operator intervention (manual operation of vent valves). A <b>pressure-relief</b> <b>valve</b> acting at 11 kg/cm2 (156 psi) gauge was also fitted.|$|E
50|$|Hydraulic rescue {{tools are}} {{powered by a}} {{hydraulic}} pump, which can be hand-, foot-, or engine-powered, or even built into the tool. These tools may be either single-acting, where hydraulic pressure will only move the cylinder in one direction, and the {{return to starting position}} is accomplished using a <b>pressure-relief</b> <b>valve</b> and spring setup, or dual-acting, in which hydraulic pressure is used to both open and close the hydraulic cylinder. Recently, manufacturers of these rescue tools have begun offering options for electrically-powered versions as well using simple electric rotation motors or screw pistons rather than the aforementioned setup, promising greater reliability, lower cost of ownership, lower weight and better handling, greater portability, quicker and more direct operation, and greater potential power.|$|E

The equipment in the tower includes a 100-ton capacity elevating module for lifting experiments {{to the top of the}} tower, internal cranes for receiver fabrication, water glycol cooling systems and air coolers to provide heat removal from experiments, air compressors, control valves, generators, uninterruptible power supplies, piping systems, and <b>pressure-relief</b> <b>valves.</b>|$|R
50|$|Extending {{the shelf}} life of roasted coffee relies on {{maintaining}} an optimum environment {{to protect it}} from exposure to heat, oxygen, and light. Roasted coffee has an optimal typical shelf life of two weeks, and ground coffee about 15 minutes. Without some sort of preservation method, coffee becomes stale. The first large-scale preservation technique was vacuum packing in cans. However, because coffee emits CO2 after roasting, coffee to be vacuum-packed must be allowed to de-gas for several days before it is sealed. To allow more immediate packaging, pressurized canisters or foil-lined bags with <b>pressure-relief</b> <b>valves</b> can be used. Refrigeration and freezing retards the staling process. Roasted whole beans can be considered fresh for up to one month if kept cool. Once coffee is ground it is best used immediately.|$|R
5000|$|Cryogens present several {{safety hazards}} and storage vessels are {{designed}} to reduce the associated risk. Firstly, no dewar can provide perfect thermal insulation and the cryogenic liquid slowly boils away, which yields an enormous quantity of gas. For example, the expansion ratio of cryogenic argon from the boiling point to ambient is 1 to 847, liquid hydrogen 1 to 851, liquid helium 1 to 757, liquid nitrogen 1 to 696, and liquid oxygen 1 to 860; Neon has the highest expansion ratio with 1 to 1438. [...] In dewars with an open top, the gas simply escapes into the surrounding area. However, very high pressures can build up inside sealed dewars, and precautions are taken to minimise the risk of explosion. One or more <b>pressure-relief</b> <b>valves</b> allow gas to vent away from the dewar whenever the pressure becomes excessive. In an incident in 2006 at Texas A&M University, the pressure-relief devices of a tank of liquid nitrogen were sealed with brass plugs. As a result, the tank failed catastrophically and exploded.|$|R
5000|$|The ambu-bag was {{a further}} {{advancement}} in resuscitation. Introduced in the 1960s by the Danish company Ambu, this device allowed two rescuers to perform CPR and ventilation on a non-breathing patient with an acceptable chance of success. The ambu-bag has now mostly replaced the demand valve {{as the primary}} method of ventilation, largely due to concerns of potential over-inflation with the demand valve by untrained rescuers. The ambu-bag, unlike the older version of the demand valve (all new models of demand valve now have pressure relief valves set at 60 cm of water to prevent accidental overinflation of the lungs), has a [...] "pop-off" [...] valve to prevent inflation at greater than 40 pounds -per-square-inch (275.79 kilo-pascals), with the result being that it is generally {{more common in the}} pre-hospital setting than the demand valve. However, the demand valve remains popular with BLS providers, and in situations where conserving supplies of oxygen is of paramount importance. The demand valve, while less popular today than it was previously, still remains in service, albeit with important safety features added, including the addition of a <b>pressure-relief</b> <b>valve</b> to prevent over-inflation and the restriction of its flow to 40 liters a minute.|$|E
5000|$|Some common but unrecommended {{practices}} can {{adversely affect}} the Svea’s performance and reliability. For example, when using a wind screen or shield {{other than the}} built-in wind screen (such as the flexible aluminum foil windscreens used with stoves made by Mountain Safety Research), care should be taken not to wrap the windscreen too tightly around the stove because {{this may cause the}} stove to overheat and the fuel tank to over-pressurize. [...] This in turn will cause the <b>pressure-relief</b> <b>valve</b> in the filler cap to open and the over-pressurized gas vapor to escape, which may catch fire and result in a dangerous [...] "flareup" [...] or large fireball. In addition, while the Svea is capable of burning unleaded automobile gasoline, only naphtha or [...] "Coleman fuel" [...] is recommended: Coleman fuel contains rust inhibitors and is specially refined for use in camping stoves, while automotive fuel contains additives that vaporize when burned and leave gumlike deposits behind that causes clogging. [...] The stove should also not be allowed to run dry because doing so will burn or char the cotton wick inside the fuel tank, which will inhibit the wick’s ability to draw fuel to the vaporizing tube.|$|E
5000|$|Made {{of solid}} brass, the Svea 123 weighs about 500 grams (19 ounces), {{measures}} 100 mm x 130 mm (3.9” x 5.1”) and will burn {{for over an}} hour on full tank (about 4 ounces) of fuel. Later models (designated the “Svea 123R” and also sold as the Optimus “Climber”) were made with a built-in cleaning needle to keep the burner jet from clogging by pushing soot or other impurities outward; early Sievert models without the self-cleaning needle came with a small wire pricker that is used to clean the burner jet manually by pushing the soot inwards. These older models are distinguishable by their downwardly-angled spindle and control valve, to which the adjusting key is attached. The spindle on a Svea 123R with the self-cleaning needle is at a right angle to the stem. Other differences between older and newer models include the vaporizer on older models, which is smooth, while newer models of both the Svea 123 and the 123R are finned and have a stronger joint configuration at the base. The <b>pressure-relief</b> <b>valve</b> in the filler cap has also been redesigned several times to improve both reliability as well as re-seating of the valve after it has opened. [...] The pentagonal hole in the pressure relief valve is designed as a vent, not a key socket. The valve disassembles easily with a pliers. A brass windscreen attaches directly to the stove, and has built-in pot supports that fold inward for storage. The aluminum lid comes with a detachable handle and can also be used as a small cook-pot.|$|E
40|$|The U. S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission {{has been}} {{conducting}} studies to evaluate the risk associated with steam generator tube failure during low probability severe accidents in pressurized-water reactors (PWRs) employing U-tube-type steam generators {{as part of the}} agency’s Steam Generator Action Plan (ML 011300073). The evaluations focus on station blackout events that include a series of unlikely events and conditions that result in a “high-drylow” plant condition. The high-dry-low condition refers to high primary side pressure along with a dried-out steam generator that is at low pressure. Failures of hot leg piping, pressurizer surge-line piping, and the reactor vessel lead to discharge of fission products into the containment. Failure of steam generator tubes prior to the failure of one of these other components leads to discharge of some fission products into the steam generator secondary system from where they may be discharged to the environment through the <b>pressure-relief</b> <b>valves.</b> This latter sequence is potentially more risk-significant since it involves a containment bypass scenario. The relative timing of these structural failures therefore affects the event sequence and whether the containment is bypassed.

5000|$|The {{actions of}} Yermak also redefined {{the meaning of}} the word Cossack. While it is {{uncertain}} whether Yermak’s group was related in any way to the Yaik or Ural Cossacks, it is known that their company was previously outlawed by the Russian government. However, in sending his letter and his trusted lieutenant Ivan Kolzo to Ivan the Terrible, Yermak transformed the image of the Cossack overnight from a bandit to a soldier recognized by the Tsar of Moscow. Now, Yermak’s Cossacks had effectively been incorporated into the military system and were able to receive support from the tsar. This new arrangement also acted as a sort of <b>pressure-relief</b> <b>valve</b> for the Cossacks, who had a history of being troublesome on the Russian frontier. In sending as many of them as possible further east into unconquered lands, the burgeoning and extremely profitable lands on the borders of Russian territory were given respite. Yermak’s call for aid thus spawned a new type of Cossack which, by virtue of its link to the government, would enjoy significant favor from future Russian rulers. Despite this new shift in orientation, it is worth noting that the Cossack name remained in place in Siberia, and that soldiers sent as reinforcements often adopted this title. [...] Furthermore, this realignment was not without criticism, however, and some saw Yermak as a traitor to the Cossack name. Such detractors saw Yermak’s death as punishment for turning away from the Cossack code and becoming a pawn of the tsar. Fittingly, then, it was his armor, the very symbol of the tsar, that dragged him down to his fate.|$|E

40|$|A passive {{vaporizing}} {{heat sink}} {{has been developed}} as a relatively lightweight, compact alternative to related prior heat sinks based, variously, on evaporation of sprayed liquids or on sublimation of solids. This heat sink is designed for short-term dissipation of {{a large amount of}} heat and was originally intended for use in regulating the temperature of spacecraft equipment during launch or re-entry. It could also be useful in a terrestrial setting {{in which there is a}} requirement for a lightweight, compact means of short-term cooling. This heat sink includes a hermetic package closed with a <b>pressure-relief</b> <b>valve</b> and containing an expendable and rechargeable coolant liquid (e. g., water) and a conductive carbon-fiber wick. The vapor of the liquid escapes when the temperature exceeds the boiling point corresponding to the vapor pressure determined by the setting of the <b>pressure-relief</b> <b>valve.</b> The great advantage of this heat sink over a melting-paraffin or similar phase-change heat sink of equal capacity is that by virtue of the = 10 x greater latent heat of vaporization, a coolant-liquid volume equal to = 1 / 10 of the paraffin volume can suffice...|$|E

40|$|Author: Sosnick Lab, University of Chicago ### Description For protein concentration, gas {{pressure}} is applied directly to ultrafiltration cell. Solutes above the membrane's molecular weight (MW) cut-off are retained in cell, while water and solutes below the cut-off {{pass into the}} filtrate and out of cell. ![Table]([URL] "`Table 1 ") ### Membranes 1. YM 10 Ø 43 mm (for 8050), Amicon # 13622, 10 pack: $ 108 - YM 10 Ø 76 mm (for 8400), Amicon # 13642, 10 pack: $ 139 - **Prewash**: float membrane with glossy side down in beaker with distilled water for at least 1 hour changing water 3 times. All membranes are pretreated with glycerine to prevent drying, YM membranes are treated with sodium azide as a preservative. - **Cleaning**: rinse with 0. 1 M NaOH, followed by thorough flushing with distilled water. For strongly absorbed protein, soak in 0. 1 % protease solution and rinse thoroughly. - **Storage**: for reuse, store membranes in 10 % ethanol water solution at 4 °C. ### Assembly 1. Place membrane in holder, **shiny side up**; then place O-ring on top of membrane. Gently push O-ring down so that it contacts and seats membrane evenly in bottom of holder. **Handle membrane by its edges to avoid scratching or contaminating surface**. - Fit membrane holder into cell body, aligning tabs on sides of holder with slots in base of cell body. - Invert cell body and membrane holder; screw base firmly into bottom of cell body. A definite "stop" will be felt when base and body are fully engaged. Top of membrane holder will be flush with bottom of slots in cell body. - Push filtrate exit tubing onto exit spout of membrane support. - Place stirrer assembly into cell body. When properly installed, arms of stirrer assembly will rest on small ridge inside top of cell body. - Introduce sample into cell. - With a twisting motion, push cap down onto cell body, orienting gas inlet port on cap opposite filtrate exit port on holder. If cap assembly does not slide easily, lubricate O-ring lightly with petroleum jelly. **Do not allow petroleum jelly to contact membrane!** - Set <b>pressure-relief</b> <b>valve</b> to horizontal (open) position. - Slide cell into retaining stand, fitting ring on cell base into hole in stand. Flattened edges on bottom flange of cap ensures that cell is inserted properly and prevents rotation of cell once inside stand. - Turn <b>pressure-relief</b> <b>valve</b> to vertical (closed) position. - Attach {{gas pressure}} line. ### Operation 1. Place cell on magnetic stirring table. - Connect inlet line to regulated gas pressure source (Nitrogen gas is recommended for pressurizing cell! Use of compressed air can cause large pH shifts due to dissolution of carbon dioxide. With sensitive solutions, oxidation can also occur, leading to other potential problems.) - Hold cell steady on the stirring table and pressurize according to instructions in membrane package. Generally ** 55 psi** (3. 7 kg/cm 2) is optimal, maximal 70 psi (4. 7 kg/cm 2) nitrogen gas pressure. Cap assembly moves upward, forming a secure lock with retaining stand once system is pressurized. - Turn on stirring table and adjust stirring rate until the vortex created is approximately one-third {{the depth of the}} liquid volume. - Monitor concentration. Do not allow retentate to run through. - Collect permeate. - Highly viscous solutions filter slowly, as do solutions containing particulate matter, such as colloids. Where the viscous agent (sucrose, glycerin, etc.) is to be removed, flow can often be increased by predilution. - **Prefilter or centrifuge** any solution containing particulate matter, such as cell debris or precipitates. - To maximize recovery of retained substances, continue stirring for a few minutes after depressurization. This will resuspend the polarized layer at the membrane surface. - When finished, turn off nitrogen pressure source and stirring table. - Vent pressure inside cell by slowly turning pressure-relief knob to horizontal position. Push cap down, then slide cell out from retaining stand. *Note: Overly rapid depressurization can cause the membrane to buckle up and rupture*. - Using a twisting motion, remove cell cap and the magnetic stirrer assembly. Always remove the cell top with the <b>pressure-relief</b> <b>valve</b> set to the horizontal (open) position. Removal in vertical (closed) position can create a partial vacuum which can rupture the membrane! Pour out solution. - Disassemble cell, then wash all components with a mild detergent/water solution, then rinse thoroughly. Caustic cleaning solutions may damage the anodized aluminum retaining stand. Leave ultrafiltration cell disassembled whenever it is unlikely to be used for several weeks. ### Limits - max. cell operating **pressure**: 75 psi (5. 3 kg/cm 2) - max. membrane operating pressure: 70 psi (4. 7 kg/cm 2) - <b>pressure-relief</b> <b>valve</b> preset: 90 psi (6. 3 kg/cm 2) - Although brief exposure to higher **temperatures** is possible, do not operate cell continuously above 85 °C (185 °F). - **pH** 2 to 10 - Do not use the following **chemicals**: Ketones (including acetone), Aromatic hydrocarbons (including toluene), Cellosolvers, Halogenated hydrocarbons, DMF, Aliphatic esters, DMSO, Polar Aromatics. *Note:The spring in the <b>pressure-relief</b> <b>valve</b> is not compatible with 0. 1 N NaOH*. ### Sterilization Amicon stirred ultrafiltration cells can be autoclaved at 121 °C (250 °F) for 30 minutes. They are compatible with standard sterilizing gas mixtures, 70 % ethanol, isopropanol or 5 % formalin. **CAUTION**: Tighten the base partially before autoclaving. ### Maintenance - Replace O-rings {{at the first sign of}} damage or wear. - If installation or removal of cap assembly becomes difficult, lubricate cap O-ring with a small amount of petroleum jelly. **Do not allow petroleum jelly to come in contact with membrane!** - Check stirrer periodically for rough edges that could possibly damage the membrane. - Replace transparent body immediately should it become cracked or crazed. ### Troubleshooting **Little or no filtrate obtained:** 1. Rotate <b>pressure-relief</b> <b>valve</b> to check for pressure. If not pressurized, check nitrogen source and regulator. - Make sure glossy side of disc membrane faces up. - If sample solution is highly viscous due to microsolutes, either dilute or diafilter to increase flow rate. - Check membrane holder and filtrate port for blockage. **Filtrate rate abnormally high:** 1. Check membrane for lesions, scratches, or roughness. - Make sure correct membrane type is being used. - Check stirrer assembly to ensure that stirring bar is not contacting the membrane surface. **Cell leaks:** 1. Be sure lower O-ring rests entirely on the membrane peripheral surface. - Check O-rings for nicks and cuts. - Make sure membrane support is seated properly, and that the base is screwed in firmly. - Make sure O-rings are not squeezed out of slots. - Check fittings on gas inlet tubing for correct order and position...|$|E
40|$|Accident {{precursors}} are {{events that}} must occur for an accident {{to happen in}} a given scenario, but that have not resulted in an accident so far. High-hazard industries, such as nuclear power and aviation, that would put many people at risk {{in the event of}} a single accident are particularly sensitive to precursors and consider them opportunities to avoid accidents. Accidents happen when precur-sors occur in combination and/or when system defenses fail to mitigate a situa-tion. Every precursor event is, therefore, both a test of the adequacy of system defenses and an opportunity to develop and apply knowledge to avoid accidents.

Monitoring the prosthesis wearing times and physical activity of prosthesis users would provide invaluable information regarding rehabilitation progress and suitability of the prosthesis. The validation of a method to determine wearing times and physical activity state, as well as strides taken, of amputees wearing suction suspension sockets is reported. Eight participants with transtibial amputation were fitted with custom-made suction sockets. Analysis algorithms were used to automatically characterize physical activity based on the pressure at the socket’s relief valve. The algorithms were validated in a laboratory-based protocol that included walking, stair climbing, standing, sitting, donning, and doffing. Intraclass correlation coefficient (2, 1) values of > 0. 98 were achieved with mean differences of – 2. 0 %, 0. 3 %, 1. 3 %, and 0. 7 % for agreement between "off," "static," and "dynamic" times and stride count, respectively, {{as determined by the}} analysis algorithms and a concurrent video analysis.

40|$|Pastoral {{guidance}} for the self-mutilator. In this article {{it seemed that}} the increase in the occurrence of self-mutilation among young people in many cases served as a <b>pressure-relief</b> <b>valve</b> and not a suicide attempt as such. It was very often the outcome of ill-treatment and/or sexual abuse and the person used this method {{to get rid of the}} inner pain. Feelings of aloneness, a need to be in control, a need to feel at least something and a need to punish the self could also have played a role. The family climate was generally very important. This provided a special challenge for pastoral counsellors as well as the church by, among others, focussing more on the problem of pain and how to handle it. This was relevant to the fact that denial had played a significant role in certain church circles as well as within some families. As part of the pastoral-therapeutic strategy in helping the self-mutilator, aspects such as identifying the role of lies, the use of solutions from the past, forgiveness, the Lord’s Supper, prayer, and meditation were therefore very important components in the healing process.

40|$|A {{series of}} three {{pressurized}} sulfuric acid decomposition tests were performed to (1) obtain data on the fraction of sulfuric acid catalytically converted to sulfur dioxide, oxygen, and water {{as a function of}} temperature and pressure, (2) demonstrate real-time measurements of acid conversion for use as process control, (3) obtain multiple measurements of conversion as a function of temperature within a single experiment, and (4) assess rapid quenching to minimize corrosion of metallic components by undecomposed acid. All four of these objectives were successfully accomplished. This report documents the completion of the NHI milestone on high pressure H{sub 2 }SO{sub 4 } decomposition tests for the Sulfur-Iodine (SI) thermochemical cycle project. All heated sections of the apparatus, (i. e. the boiler, decomposer, and condenser) were fabricated from Hastelloy C 276. A ceramic acid injection tube and a ceramic-sheathed thermocouple were used to minimize corrosion of hot liquid acid on the boiler surfaces. Negligible fracturing of the platinum on zirconia catalyst was observed in the high temperature decomposer. Temperature measurements at the exit of the decomposer and at the entry of the condenser indicated that the hot acid vapors were rapidly quenched from about 400 C to less than 20 C within a 14 cm length of the flow path. Real-time gas flow rate measurements of the decomposition products provided a direct measurement of acid conversion. Pressure in the apparatus was preset by a <b>pressure-relief</b> <b>valve</b> that worked well at controlling the system pressure.
