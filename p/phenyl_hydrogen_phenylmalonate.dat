40|$|The curved [pi] {{surface of}} fullerene, C[subscript] 60, shows a {{tendency}} to interact with other molecules, making it an interesting target for building supramolecular arrays. The interaction can be relative strong and may even exist in solutions, often leading to stable complexes. An important class of the macrocycles that interacts with fullerenes is the porphyrins. In our study, [superscript] 1 H NMR spectrometric {{studies have been done}} to gain information on the nature and the precise interaction site of fullerene 1, with tetraphenylporphyrin, H[subscript] 2 [TPP] 2, and para-substituted tetraphenylporphyrins, H[subscript] 2 [(p-X) [subscript] 4 TPP], where X= CN and OCH[subscript] 3 in deuterated chlorobenzene-d[subscript] 5 (CBZ) and toluene-d[subscript] 8. The porphyrin derivatives have been used to investigate any correlation in the interaction site due to changes in substituent. Relaxation rates of the pyrrole and <b>phenyl</b> <b>hydrogen</b> in the porphyrins were determined at temperatures of 288, 298 and 313 K for all the complexes in the presence {{and in the absence of}} fullerene, C[subscript] 60. To study solvent effects on interactions, Toluene-d[subscript] 8 and chlorobenzene-d[subscript] 5 solvents were used. Overall, our data indicated that C[subscript] 60 interacted with H[subscript] 2 [TPP] at both the pyrrole and <b>phenyl</b> <b>hydrogen</b> sites however, these intermolecular interaction are not long-lasting in chlorobenzene-d[subscript] 5. 	   The porphyrin derivatives showed that the substituents have an effect on which site is preferred for interaction.

40|$|Part I. Photocages, {{which are}} light cleavable {{protecting}} groups, {{are an important}} class of chemical tools that allow light to unmask bioactive substrates with precise spatiotemporal resolution in biological microenvironments. Due to their effectiveness in biological systems, {{it has become increasingly}} important to find logically designed photocages that can cleave under visible light and Near IR conditions, wavelengths with minimal phototoxicity and increased tissue penetration compared to ultraviolet light. The scope of this research is to both rationally design and synthesize a new class of photocage based on the BODIPY moiety, as well as to modify these photocages to absorb in region of the biological window (600 - 1000 nm), where tissues have maximal transparency. In chapter 1, photocages derived from meso-substituted BODIPY dyes were synthesized that release acetic acid when irradiated with green wavelengths (3 ̆e 500 nm). The structures of the photocages were derived by computationally searching for carbocations with low-energy diradical states as a possible indicator of nearby productive conical intersections. These photocages were found to have superior optical properties than the popular o-nitrobenzyl systems, which make them promising alternatives. The utility of these photocages in living cells was successfully demonstrated by our collaborators (Prof. Emily Smith and Aleem Syed) in cultured S 2 cells. In Chapter 2, Knoevenagel type reactions were used to extend the π electron conjugation of the aromatic rings of the BODIPY photocages. This extended conjugation of these BODIPY photocages resulted in a bathochromic shift in absorbance towards red light (3 ̆e 600 nm) and allows cleavage using wavelengths in the biological window. Part II. Self-immolative linkers can be used to trigger the release of an important cargo molecule like a drug or a biomolecule. A variety of trigger stimulants including light, chemo and enzyme are known in literature. However, {{there is a need for}} new linker units which would have fast and controllable kinetics of cargo release. During my research, I identified improved self-immolative linker units based on aryl phthalate esters with a modular design, which can tolerate a range of different trigger and cargo units. In Chapter 3, new types of self-immolative linkers based on the <b>phenyl</b> <b>hydrogen</b> phthalate system were synthesized. The fast kinetic rate for the hydrolysis of <b>phenyl</b> <b>hydrogen</b> phthalate system and the resulting benign byproducts promise a robust self-immolative linker system that can be used in biological systems. The linker system was shown to release phenol based cargo molecules including phenol and coumarin dyes upon cleavage by a fluoride sensitive trigger. This type of linker can also be potentially used as an efficient fluoride sensor. In Chapter 4, the scope of self-immolative linkers based on <b>phenyl</b> <b>hydrogen</b> phthalate system was extended. Light and peroxide sensitive triggers were incorporated into the linker system. Coumarin based cargo molecules were used as reporter molecules and the increase in their fluorescence after release was monitored.

40|$|Mild self-etch {{adhesives}} demineralize dentin only partially, leaving hydroxyapatite around collagen {{within a}} submicron hybrid layer. We hypothesized that this residual hydroxyapatite {{may serve as}} a receptor for chemical interaction with the functional monomer and, subsequently, contribute to adhesive performance in addition to micro-mechanical hybridization. We therefore chemically characterized the adhesive interaction of 3 functional monomers with synthetic hydroxyapatite, using x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and atomic absorption spectrophotometry. We further characterized their interaction with dentin ultra-morphologically, using transmission electron microscopy. The monomer 10 -methacryloxydecyl dihydrogen phosphate (10 -MDP) readily adhered to hydroxyapatite.

Conversely, the lone electron pair in the pyridyl compounds engage in a repulsive electrostatic interaction.

This paper uses a combined theoretical and experimental approach to study the activity and selectivity of three Lewis acid catalysts for this reaction, namely ZnBr 2, aluminum tris(2, 6 -diphenylphenoxide) (ATPH), and the heterogeneous metal–organic framework Cu 3 BTC 2 (BTC = benzene- 1, 3, 5 -tricarboxylate). ATPH is a strong Lewis acid homogeneous catalyst with bulky ligands which provides very high selectivities for the desired stereoisomer (> 99 %). The performance of the catalysts was evaluated {{as a function of}} temperature, which revealed that a higher catalyst activity allows working at lower temperatures and improves the selectivity for isopulegol. The selectivity distribution is kinetically driven for ZnBr 2 and ATPH. The theoretical selectivity distributions rely on the determination of an extensive set of diastereomeric transition states, for which the differences in free energy have been calculated using a complementary set of ab initio techniques. Given the sensitivity of the selectivity to small Gibbs free-energy differences, the agreement between experimental and theoretical selectivities is satisfactory. On basis of the obtained insights, rational design of new catalysts may be obtained. As proof of concept, the hypothetical Cu 3 (BTC-(NO 2) 3) 2 Lewis catalyst – in which each <b>phenyl</b> <b>hydrogen</b> of the BTC ligand is replaced by a nitro group – is predicted to be very selective. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: Specific {{functional}} monomers as {{contained in}} self-etch adhesives {{have been documented}} to chemically bond to hydroxyapatite (HAp). In addition to this chemical bonding potential, also the etching (demineralization) potential of these acidic monomers is important for smear-layer dissolution and to provide surface micro-retention. The etching efficacy of functional monomers is commonly determined by measuring the pH. However, the pH of adhesive solutions cannot be accurately determined. Better is to measure the actual HAp-dissolving capacity, taking into account also the potential of functional monomers to deposit stable monomer-calcium salts. In this study, we investigated the etching efficacy of functional monomers by measuring the calcium concentration using ICP-AES {{and the amount of}} monomer-Ca salt formation using NMR. Methods: The functional monomers 2 -methacryloyloxyethyl dihydrogen phosphate (2 -MEP), 6 -methacryloyloxyhexyl dihydrogen phosphate (6 -MHP), 10 -methacryloyloxydecyl dihydrogen phosphate (10 -MDP), 2 -methacryloxyethyl <b>phenyl</b> <b>hydrogen</b> phosphate (phenyl-P), 4 -methacryloxyethyl trimellitic acid (4 -MET), glycerol phosphate dimethacrylate (GPDM), and 10 -methacryloyloxy tetraethyleneglycol dihydrogen phosphate (MTEGP) were investigated. 1. 0 g functional monomer was used to prepare a 15 wt% monomer/ 45 wt% ethanol/ 40 wt% water solution that was subsequently mixed with 0. 2 g of HAp for 1 hr. [Ca] and [P] of the initial and supernatant liquid were measured using ICP-AES. The precipitation of monomer-Ca salts was confirmed with XRD and analyzed using 31 P MAS NMR. Results: ICP-AES revealed the highest [Ca] produced by phenyl-P, followed in order by 2 MEP = MTEG-P > GPDM > 6 -MHP > 10 -MDP > 4 -MET. Only 10 -MDP formed 10 -MDP_Ca salt, indicating that 10 -MDP released more Ca from HAp than was measured by ICP-AES. Although 10 -MDP seemed to have etched HAp less as appeared from the lower [Ca] measured, part of the released Ca was consumed to form 10 -MDP_Ca salts. Conclusions: The high bonding potential of 10 -MDP-based adhesives is suggested to result from a combined etching and chemical bonding potential. status: submitte...|$|R

By using structure sensitive reagent ions, the dimethoxyphosphenium and 1, 3 -dioxalane- 2 -phosphenium ions, it was determined that five-carbon monosaccharides maintain their six-membered, crystalline structure in the gas phase. Computational examination of possible sugar conformers also revealed that the six-membered ring form is the most stable form for all five-carbon monosaccharides except D-lyxose, which prefers a five-membered ring. ^ The second part of this thesis explores the reactivity of five charged phenyl radicals toward three alcohols and seven amino acids. First, the regioselectivity of four charged <b>phenyl</b> radicals in <b>hydrogen</b> atom abstraction reactions with ethanol, isopropanol, and t-butanol, was examined. It was determined that the H-atom abstraction reaction efficiency is predominantly controlled by the electron affinity of the reacting radical. It was also discovered that the regioselectivity is dependent on the electrophilicity of the radical, and less so on the hydrogen bond strength (i. e., BIDE of C-H bond), a result that was unexpected. Less electrophilic radicals were found to prefer hydroxyl hydrogens over carbon hydrogens, even though the O-H bond is significantly stronger than the C-H bond. Reactions with amino acids revealed several other reaction pathways besides H-atom abstraction, such as NH 2 abstraction, SH abstraction and SCH 3 abstraction. These reaction pathways seem to dominate the reactivity of most electrophilic radicals, whereas with least electrophilic radicals, these reaction pathways are undetectable. Some computational and experimental evidence suggests that these reactions may not be radical type reactions, but addition-elimination reactions. ...|$|R

The methyl compound CP* 2 Ti(Me) Ph (from 5 and MeLi) decomposes thermally to Cp*FvTiPh and methane (DELTA-H double dagger = 96. 4 (7) kJ. mol- 1, DELTA-S double dagger = - 41 (9) J. mol- 1. K- 1. Labeling experiments and kinetic studies show that thermolysis occurs via a rate-determining <b>phenyl</b> ortho <b>hydrogen</b> abstraction (k(H) /k(D) = 5. 7 for the thermolysis of CP* 2 Ti-(Me) (Ph-d 5)) giving an o-phenylene intermediate. The intermediate can be trapped by CO 2 to yield CP* 2 Ti(o-C 6 H 4) C(O) O. The benzyl complex CP* 2 Ti(Me) CH 2 Ph (from 1 and KCH 2 Ph) decomposes by homolysis of the Ti-CH 2 Ph bond, and in the methyl alkoxide CP* 2 Ti(O-n-Pr) Me (from 6 and MeLi) homolysis of the Ti-Me bond occurs...|$|R
40|$|The {{chemistry}} {{of the main}} group elements with nitrogen based ligands has been {{an area that has}} received little attention in comparison to transition metals. The preliminary investigations have focused on groups 13 and 14 revealing new bonding motifs and interesting reactivity. This has motivated us to synthesize group 15 and 16 derivatives in new bonding arrangements capable of activating small molecules. In pursuit of isolating such species, the reactivity of sulfur dichloride and “S(OTf) 2 ” with a series of diazabutadiene (DAB) ligands was explored. The substitution on the ligand was extremely influential on the outcome of the reaction. Alkyl groups on the nitrogen atom resulted in the production of 1, 2, 5 -thiadiazolium heterocycles by loss of an alkyl group whereas methyl groups on the backbone carbon atom led to reaction with the eneamine tautomer of the ligand to give N,C-bound heterocycles. This could be avoided with aryl groups or hydrogen atoms on the backbone carbons and aryl groups on the nitrogen centres. The latter reactions produced dicationic analogues of the N-Heterocyclic carbene, the first examples for sulfur. The {{chemistry of}} the chalcogen halides and bistriflate synthons with the diiminopyridine (DIMPY) ligand showed similar trends. Methyl groups on the backbone carbon resulted in bonding through a methyl carbon whereas <b>phenyl</b> groups or <b>hydrogen</b> atoms in the same position produced N,N’,N’’-chelated cations or dications. The dicationic triflate salts are stable in the open atmosphere, a remarkable feature for highly charged cations. The chemistry was also extended to phosphorus. Collectively these species represent the first DIMPY complexes for phosphorus, sulfur, selenium and tellurium. Sulfur(II) dications with amine donors, namely pentamethyldiethylenetriamine could also be prepared. The complex was highly unstable indicating imine and pyridine groups offer greater stabilization. In addition to the chelate complexes, monodentate pyridine ligands coordinate to a dicationic sulfur centre. The monodentate species displayed reactivity with a variety of unsaturated organic substrates. Altering the group on the para position of the pyridine proved to {{have a significant effect on}} the reactivity indicating potential tuneability for the system...|$|R
