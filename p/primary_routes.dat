5|$|Based on the {{analysis}} of rat and human urine by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry, mephedrone {{is thought to be}} metabolised by three phase 1 pathways. It can be demethylated to the primary amine (producing compounds 2, 3 and 5), the ketone group can be reduced (producing 3) or the tolyl group can be oxidised (producing 6). Both 5 and 6 are thought to be further metabolised by conjugation to the glucuronide and sulfate derivatives. Knowledge of the <b>primary</b> <b>routes</b> of metabolism should allow the intake of mephedrone to be confirmed by drug tests, as well as more accurate determination of the causes of side effects and potential for toxicity.|$|E
5|$|Both Braathens SAFE and SAS {{had been}} cross-subsidizing their routes. Through the regulations, the {{airlines}} {{had agreed to}} fly to unprofitable airports, in exchange for making higher profits on other routes. With free competition, {{this would not be}} followed, and the authorities announced the introduction of public service obligations on routes that were not profitable. To finance these, a NOK10 fee would be charged on all <b>primary</b> <b>routes.</b> The cost of collecting this fee was so high that SAS and Braathens SAFE announced it was cheaper to continue to fly to the unprofitable airports. Braathens SAFE stated that their routes Haugesund–Bergen and Oslo–Røros–Trondheim were not profitable.|$|E
5|$|During the {{discussion}} about deregulation, Braathens SAFE considered several possibilities to strengthen itself. In particular, it had discussions with the large European airlines Lufthansa, British Airways and KLM about an alliance, but these were rejected by Braathens SAFE, stating that the agreements were all about getting traffic to the partner's hub. Minister of Transport, Kjell Opseth and director of SAS in Norway, Jan Reinås, both proposed a merger between Braathens SAFE and SAS, {{to ensure that the}} company had a 100% market share on the <b>primary</b> <b>routes</b> before the merger. This would, according to them, secure that no foreign company could compete with the merged company. The proposal was rejected by Braathens SAFE's management. Still, negotiations started between the companies in 1992, although they were quickly abandoned. The press reported the price of Braathens SAFE to be NOK1.2 billion, but that this had been rejected as too expensive by SAS.|$|E
50|$|Most {{traffic from}} and to Varde goes via <b>primary</b> <b>route</b> 11, which starts in Tønder goes via Varde {{all the way}} to Aalborg in {{northern}} Jutland. <b>Primary</b> <b>route</b> 11 crosses the E20 (the Esbjerg highway) near Korskro, from where there is approximately 10 km to Varde via <b>primary</b> <b>route</b> 11.|$|R

5000|$|North-east of the motorway, {{the road}} is {{classified}} as a non <b>primary</b> <b>route,</b> while south-west of the motorway, {{the road is}} classified as a <b>primary</b> <b>route.</b> In both instances, the road is operated by Carmarthenshire County Council.|$|R
25|$|Some A {{roads are}} {{designated}} trunk roads, which implies that central government rather than local government has responsibility for them. A more recent classification {{is that of}} <b>primary</b> <b>routes,</b> the category of recommended routes for long distance traffic. <b>Primary</b> <b>routes</b> include both trunk and non-trunk roads.|$|E
25|$|<b>Primary</b> <b>routes</b> are {{generally}} given numbers under 600. The two exceptions - State Route 785 and State Route 895 - are numbered as Interstate Highway spurs.|$|E
25|$|Roads in Ireland are {{currently}} classified as motorways, National <b>Primary</b> <b>routes,</b> National secondary routes, Regional roads and Local roads. The introduction of this classification system began in 1977.|$|E
50|$|The A560 is a <b>primary</b> <b>route</b> {{that runs}} from the A56 in Altrincham, Greater Manchester, to Hattersley, Tameside {{following}} a complex <b>route</b> that involves <b>Primary</b> <b>Route,</b> non-primary route, single and dual carriage way, some complex motorway junctions and, at one point, carriageways running {{on both sides of}} the M56 Motorway.|$|R
50|$|In Ireland all {{motorways}} {{form part}} of a national route. The M50 was the only motorway that initially did not {{form part of}} an existing national <b>primary</b> <b>route,</b> though it was designated as the national <b>primary</b> <b>route</b> N50 in 1994.|$|R
50|$|In the 1850s, Whitehorse Road {{was built}} to be the <b>primary</b> <b>route</b> from Melbourne to Gippsland, a rather {{circuitous}} route which went via the Dandenong Ranges.

25|$|Ireland has an {{extensive}} network of public roads which connect {{all parts of}} the country with each other. Roads in Ireland are currently classified as motorways, National <b>Primary</b> <b>routes,</b> National secondary routes, Regional roads and Local roads. The introduction of this classification system began in 1977.|$|E
25|$|The {{road network}} in Ireland is {{primarily}} focused on Dublin. The M50 motorway, a semi-ring road which runs around the south, west {{and north of}} the city, connects important national <b>primary</b> <b>routes</b> {{to the rest of}} the country. In 2008, the West-Link toll bridge was replaced by the eFlow barrier-free tolling system, with a three-tiered charge system based on electronic tags and car pre-registration.|$|E
25|$|In {{common with}} most American {{railroad}} companies, the Rock Island once operated an extensive passenger service. The <b>primary</b> <b>routes</b> served were: Chicago-Los Angeles, Chicago-Denver, Memphis-Tucumcari, and Minneapolis-Dallas. The Rock Island ran both Limited and Local service on those routes {{as well as}} locals on many other lines on its system. In 1937, the Rock Island introduced Diesel power to its passenger service, with the purchase of six lightweight Rocket streamliners.|$|E

25|$|Like the American Indian ‘occupation’ of the Indiana Dunes, {{exploration}} by Europeans {{swirled around}} the southern shore of Lake Michigan, {{rather than through}} the heart of the dunes. The French quickly ‘discovered’ or were told of the water routes that passed from the south side of Lake Michigan to places further south. The two <b>primary</b> <b>routes</b> were by the Chicago Portage in Illinois or by the portage between the St. Joseph River and the Kankakee River in northern Indiana.|$|E
25|$|All of {{the above}} {{objectives}} were achieved by December 2010. The M50 was completed in 2005 and underwent a major upgrade between 2006 and 2010, the Dublin Port Tunnel opened to all traffic on 28 January 2007, one major inter-urban route (the M1/N1 from Dublin to the border north of Dundalk) was completed in 2007 and the other major inter-urban routes were completed by December 2010. Major improvements were made to other national <b>primary</b> <b>routes,</b> notably the N11 (Dublin-Wexford) and N18/N19 (Limerick-Shannon-Galway) routes.|$|E
25|$|The parkway {{continues}} {{to provide access}} to several state parks, including one named for Roosevelt. It has also become an important regional artery, one of the <b>primary</b> <b>routes</b> to northern New England and upstate New York from New York City and Long Island. The southern sections, particularly in Westchester County, have become a commuter route into the city for residents who moved into towns that became suburbanized {{as a result of the}} parkway. The state and regional transportation planners have worked to adapt to this change since the 1940s.|$|E

25|$|The N7 road is a {{national}} primary road in Ireland, connecting Limerick and Dublin. The majority of the route (between Naas and Limerick) is motorway standard and is designated as the M7 motorway. At the Rosbrien interchange in Limerick the route continues as the N18 dual carriage to Shannon and Ennis. The road passes through the midlands of Ireland, and acts as a trunk route out of Dublin for the N8 and N9 national <b>primary</b> <b>routes</b> to Cork and Waterford respectively. It forms part of European route E20.|$|E
25|$|Motorway signs use white text {{on a blue}} background. Non-motorway {{national}} <b>primary</b> <b>routes</b> use white text on a green background, {{with the}} specific route number in yellow bold text. Regional and local county roads use black text on white background. Signs to points of interest (services, institutions, tourist sights) have white text on a brown background. Patching (according to the Guildford Rules) is used to show roads of different classification on signs. On all purpose roads, signs for roads whose only destination is a motorway should display the motorway symbol.|$|E
25|$|The {{airport is}} on the R708 road, which can be {{accessed}} from the R710 outer ring road in Waterford. Car hire {{is available in the}} arrivals hall of the terminal building, with two car rental companies. There are 200 car parking spaces outside the terminal. Cars may only be parked during the airport's opening hours, and vehicles cannot be accessed outside of these hours. Waterford has a by-pass, and thus the airport can be very easily reached from Dungarvan, Tipperary, Kilkenny, Carlow and Wexford. After reaching the outer ring road, three major <b>primary</b> <b>routes</b> can be accessed from Waterford: towards New Ross, Dublin and Cork.|$|E
