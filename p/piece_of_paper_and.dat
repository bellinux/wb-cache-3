5|$|The {{penalty of}} the sack, {{with the animals}} included, {{experienced}} a revival in parts of late medieval, and early modern Germany (particularly in Saxony). The 14th century commentator on the 13th century compilation of laws/customs Sachsenspiegel, Johann von Buch, for example, states that the poena cullei is the appropriate punishment for parricides. Some differences evolved within the German ritual, relative to the original Roman ritual, though. Apparently, the rooster was not included, and the serpent might be replaced with {{a painting of a}} serpent on a <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> <b>and</b> the monkey could be replaced with a cat. Furthermore, the cat and the dog were sometimes physically separated from the person, and the sack itself (with its two partitions) was made of linen, rather than of leather.|$|E

25|$|Alpha can {{be stopped}} quite easily {{by a few}} {{centimetres}} in air or a <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> <b>and</b> is equivalent to a helium nucleus. Beta can be cut off by an aluminium sheet just a few millimetres thick and are electrons. Gamma is the most penetrating of the three and is a massless chargeless high energy photon. Gamma radiation requires an appreciable amount of heavy metal radiation shielding (usually lead or barium-based) to reduce its intensity.|$|E
25|$|Upon this, {{there was}} a clamour among the crowds, and Mirza Ghulam Ahmad was {{informed}} that the other party alleged {{that he was at}} odds with Islamic beliefs and was a disbeliever; therefore, it was not proper to debate with him unless he clarified his beliefs. Ghulam Ahmad wrote his beliefs on a <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> <b>and</b> had it read aloud, but due to the clamour among the people, it could not be heard. Seeing that the crowd was drifting out of control and that violence was imminent, the police superintendent gave orders to disperse the audience, and the debate did not take place. A few days later, however, a written debate did take place between Mirza Ghulam Ahmad and Maulwi Muhammad Bashir of Bhopal, which was later published.|$|E

Chaough crosses out $18,000 and writes $19,000.|$|E
60|$|The sailor {{hesitated a}} moment, looked anew at the woman, came in, {{unfolded}} five crisp <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper,</b> <b>and</b> threw them {{down upon the}} tablecloth. They were Bank-of-England notes for five pounds. Upon {{the face of this}} he clinked down the shillings severally--one, two, three, four, five.|$|R

In recent years there has been a shift towards paperless, electronic statements, and some financial institutions offer direct download into account holders accounting software.|$|R
500|$|During his arraignment, Modell {{uses his}} ability to make the judge let him go. The agents look into Modell's past and find that he failed to enter the FBI after a {{psychological}} examination deemed him to be grossly egocentric and sociopathic. Meanwhile, after writing the word [...] "pass" [...] on a <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> <b>and</b> putting it in his shirt pocket, Modell is able to pass security and enter FBI headquarters. He [...] "pushes" [...] an agent, Holly (Julia Arkos), into pulling up Mulder's file for him. When Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) intervenes, Modell convinces Holly {{that he was a}} man who mugged her, causing her to spray Skinner with mace and beat him. Scully is unable to explain how Modell has his power, but now agrees with Mulder's theory that he can push people into doing whatever he wants.|$|E
500|$|Paul {{built the}} members a cabana style house on his pool deck with air conditioning, a TV, and beds so the members felt {{comfortable}} while recording. Paul produced {{the record and}} Gray felt Paul [...] "facilitated the whole thing". The album was completed in roughly a month, with three recording sessions. The band worked on the record for eight days and returned home for a break. A 14-day session, followed the break and then another 10 days in the studio. Gray asserts the breaks in between recording sessions were to [...] "re charge the batteries", and [...] "get a fresh head". As the line-up was complete, the band started to brainstorm names. When a member thought of a name they would write it on a <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> <b>and</b> put it in an amp box outside the studio. Someone wrote [...] "Hellyeah", and the band {{thought it was a}} perfect choice. Paul says it's [...] "very affirmative and full of attitude. When your buddy asks {{if you want to get}} a beer tonight, you don't just say 'yes,' you say, [...] "Hell yeah!". Gray attributes the name to [...] "late teens, keggers and chicks and AC/DC and Metallica".|$|E
500|$|There {{are about}} 200 minigames {{included}} in WarioWare: Smooth Moves, an amount similar to previous WarioWare titles. Abe determined which minigames were included after each team member wrote down an idea on a <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> <b>and</b> {{sent it to}} him. The minigames were inspired by [...] "very original, everyday life issues". To offer a different visual style for each minigame, developers were asked {{to make their own}} design for the minigame that they were working on. During development, one of the game's basic concepts was to [...] "make a different taste for every single game". The only rule that Abe imposed on the minigame designs was for the developers to make it instantly obvious as to {{what is happening in the}} minigames. The Wii Remote's speaker is used in the game to [...] "add a greater sense of feel". For example, in one microgame, the player must bounce a tennis ball on a racquet. When the ball touches the racquet, the Wii Remote's speaker emits a bouncing sound and a rumble to [...] "add a very strong reality to the game". The game mostly forgoes the Wii nunchuk attachment and functions strictly with the Wii Remote. Its visual presentation is similar to [...] for the Nintendo GameCube, and it does not run in widescreen mode.|$|E

This woman, Doris Mirman, {{a survivor of}} the Koszedary labor camp in Poland, wrote poems in Yiddish {{as soon as she}} could find a <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> <b>and</b> a pencil. When she arrived in the United States, in July 1949, she translated the poems into English. [...] She feels her poetry comes from a deep, embedded place in her. [...] Decades later, as another form of artistic catharsis, Doris went on to paint and make collages.|$|E
5000|$|Some of this text, however, {{had been}} {{accompanied}} by notes in English. In Hampton's writing, for example, he used the title [...] "Director, Special Projects for the State of Eternity" [...] and ended each page with the word [...] "Revelation". Hampton had also written texts, some of which refer to religious visions, on various <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> <b>and</b> cardboard and on a few pages in each of seven other notebooks.|$|R

2500|$|With a large {{influx of}} foreign [...] "invaders", {{the effects of}} a {{xenophobia}} that had not been seen before became apparent. [...] Novelist Jose Rafael Pocaterra described the oilmen as [...] "the new Spaniards". He wrote in 1918:One day some Spaniards mounted a dark apparatus on three legs, a grotesque stork with crystal eyes. [...] They drew something (on a <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper)</b> <b>and</b> opened their way through the forest. [...] Other new Spaniards would open roads…would drill the earth from the top of fantastic towers, producing the fetid fluid…the liquid gold converted into petroleum.|$|E
2500|$|In {{order to}} give the strike teeth and to protect himself from harm, Verro {{became a member of}} a Mafia group in Corleone, the Fratuzzi (the Brothers).

I entered a mysterious room where there were many men armed with guns sitting around a table. In the center of the table there was a skull drawn on a <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> <b>and</b> a knife. In order to be admitted to the Fratuzzi, [...] had to undergo an initiation consisting of some trials of loyalty and the pricking of the lower lip with the tip of the knife: the blood from the wound soaked the skull." ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{significant}} change {{began in the}} establishment of Victorian society in Europe. In an attempt to civilize anything that seemed coarse or uncivil, much of Victorian society would adapt cultural items to suit their tastes. Ironically the British adopted the paper wrapped minced tobacco. Such an item, originally relegated to the poor in Spain, seemed at face value a contradiction; however, one must consider the need for human manipulation of tobacco, including, chopping it up, wrapping it in a man-made <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper,</b> <b>and</b> then inserting it into a piece of cane for a mouth piece. One can then see that this was just another way of civilizing part of the coarser aspects of the British Empire. A feministic culture dominated smoking at this time as well as lots of tobacco, and this gave further rise to this [...] "dainty" [...] cigarette, bearing a feminine name.|$|E
50|$|Blesson also {{observed}} {{differences in the}} color and heat of the flames in different marshes. The ignis fatuus in Malapane, Upper Silesia (now Ozimek, Poland) could be ignited and extinguished, but were unable to burn <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> or wood shavings. Similarly, the ignis fatuus in another forest in Poland coated <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> <b>and</b> wood shavings with an oily viscous fluid instead of burning them. Blesson also accidentally created ignis fatuus in the marshes of Porta Westfalica, Germany, while launching fireworks.|$|R

60|$|The shaft {{had been}} sunk some fifty fathoms, but was now full of water, to within forty {{feet of the}} surface.

2500|$|Aaahh!!! Real Monsters {{was created}} by Gábor Csupó and Peter Gaffney, and was {{produced}} by Csupó's company Klasky Csupo, which also created the animated shows The Simpsons, [...] Rugrats and Duckman on USA Network. Before the final title was chosen, which took over 5 years, the series had the working titles Monsters and Real Monsters. The show was conceived after Csupó {{and his wife and}} creative partner Arlene Klasky were approached by the network Nickelodeon to create a follow-up series to Rugrats. Csupó was inspired to write a show about monsters because his own young children loved them. He also said he knew Nickelodeon would not want a series about human characters because everybody else was pitching shows about animals. Csupó drew some sketches of possible monsters on a <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> <b>and</b> successfully pitched the idea to the network: [...] "I wanted them silly and not too skillful– and the idea worked." ...|$|E

2500|$|Otis Redding {{recorded}} a rendition of [...] "Satisfaction" [...] for his album Otis Blue/Otis Redding Sings Soul, released in 1965. Redding {{claimed that he}} did not know the lyrics of the song. [...] "I use a lot of words different than the Stones' version," [...] he noted. [...] "That's because I made them up." [...] Of that session, Steve Cropper said, [...] "...if you ever listened to the record you can hardly understand the lyrics, right? I set down to a record player and copied down what I thought the lyrics were and I handed Otis a <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> <b>and</b> before we got through with the cut, he threw the paper on the floor and that was it." [...] Music writer Robert Christgau described it as an [...] "anarchic reading" [...] of the Stones' original. Redding's soul-style arrangement featured horns playing the main riff, as Keith Richards had originally intended. In 2003, Ronnie Wood noted that the Rolling Stones' later concert renditions of the number reflect Redding's interpretation.|$|E
