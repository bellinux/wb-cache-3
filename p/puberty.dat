5|$|During early {{childhood}} androgen synthesis and secretion remain low, but {{several years before}} <b>puberty</b> (from 6–8 years of age) changes occur in both anatomical and functional aspects of cortical androgen production that lead to increased secretion of the steroids DHEA and DHEA-S. These changes {{are part of a}} process called adrenarche, which has only been described in humans and some other primates. Adrenarche is independent of ACTH or gonadotropins and correlates with a progressive thickening of the zona reticularis layer of the cortex. Functionally, adrenarche provides a source of androgens for the development of axillary and pubic hair before the beginning of <b>puberty.</b>|$|E
5|$|Hormonal activity, such as {{occurs during}} menstrual cycles and <b>puberty,</b> may {{contribute}} to the formation of acne. During <b>puberty,</b> an increase in sex hormones called androgens causes the skin follicle glands to grow larger and make more oily sebum. Several hormones have been linked to acne, including the androgens testosterone, dihydrotestosterone (DHT), and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA); high levels of growth hormone (GH) and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) have also been associated with worsened acne. Both androgens and IGF-1 seem to be essential for acne to occur, as acne does not develop in individuals with complete androgen insensitivity syndrome (CAIS) or Laron syndrome (insensitivity to GH, resulting in very low IGF-1 levels).|$|E
5|$|In North India, Shashthi is worshipped at {{childbirth}} and <b>puberty,</b> {{and during}} marriage rites. When the pregnant woman is isolated during childbirth in the lying-in chamber, a cow-dung {{figure of the}} goddess is traditionally kept in the room. The birth of a living child is considered the blessing of Shashthi, while {{the birth of a}} stillborn infant or the early death of a child are considered manifestations of her wrath. Before childbirth, Shashthi is worshipped to protect the welfare of the expecting mother. She is also invoked after childbirth on the sixth day of each month until the child reaches <b>puberty,</b> especially when the child is sick.|$|E
5|$|In some cultures, {{males are}} {{generally}} {{required to be}} circumcised shortly after birth, during childhood or around <b>puberty</b> {{as part of a}} rite of passage. Circumcision is commonly practiced in the Jewish and Islamic faiths.|$|E
5|$|Juvenile red-tailed black {{cockatoos}} resemble females until <b>puberty,</b> {{which occurs}} around {{four years of}} age, but have paler yellow barred underparts. As the birds reach maturity, males gradually replace their yellow tail feathers with red ones; the complete process takes around four years.|$|E
5|$|Other {{reproductive}} {{and sexual}} health issues include sex education, <b>puberty,</b> sexuality and sexual function. Women also experience {{a number of}} issues related to the health of their breasts and genital tract, which fall into the scope of gynaecology.|$|E
5|$|The Feast for Fire/The Feast for Water. These feast {{days are}} usually taken as being {{when a child}} hits <b>puberty</b> and steps unto the path of adulthood. The Feast for Fire is celebrated for a male, and the Feast for Water for a female.|$|E
5|$|The zona incerta, grouped {{between the}} arcuate and periventricular nuclei, {{projects}} to several {{areas of the}} hypothalamus, and participates in the control of gonadotropin-releasing hormone, which is necessary to activate {{the development of the}} male and female reproductive systems, following <b>puberty.</b>|$|E
5|$|Genetics {{is thought}} to be the primary cause of acne in 80% of cases. The role of diet and {{cigarette}} smoking is unclear, and neither cleanliness nor exposure to sunlight appear to play a part. During <b>puberty,</b> in both sexes, acne is often brought on by an increase in hormones such as testosterone. A frequent factor is excessive growth of the bacterium Propionibacterium acnes, which is normally present on the skin.|$|E
5|$|Hormones {{can act as}} immunomodulators, {{altering}} {{the sensitivity of the}} immune system. For example, female sex hormones are known immunostimulators of both adaptive and innate immune responses. Some autoimmune diseases such as lupus erythematosus strike women preferentially, and their onset often coincides with <b>puberty.</b> By contrast, male sex hormones such as testosterone seem to be immunosuppressive. Other hormones appear to regulate the immune system as well, most notably prolactin, growth hormone and vitamin D.|$|E
5|$|In older {{children}} and adolescents, {{the symptoms of}} hypothyroidism may include fatigue, cold intolerance, sleepiness, muscle weakness, constipation, a delay in growth, overweight for height, pallor, coarse and thick skin, increased body hair, irregular menstrual cycles in girls, and delayed <b>puberty.</b> Signs may include delayed relaxation of the ankle reflex and a slow heart beat. A goiter may be present with a completely enlarged thyroid gland; sometimes {{only part of the}} thyroid is enlarged and it can be knobby in character.|$|E
5|$|In the Uttara Kanda {{book of the}} Ramayana (regarded by most {{scholars}} as a later addition to the epic), Brahma crafts Ahalya as {{the most beautiful woman}} and places her in the care of Gautama until she reaches <b>puberty.</b> When that time arrives, the sage returns Ahalya to Brahma, who, impressed by Gautama's sexual restraint and asceticism, bestows her upon him. Indra, who believes that the best women are meant for him, resents Ahalya's marriage to the forest-dwelling ascetic.|$|E
5|$|Several {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} that the condition in most children improves with maturity. Tics may be at their highest severity at the time that they are diagnosed, and often improve with understanding of the condition by individuals and their families and friends. The statistical age of highest tic severity is typically between eight and twelve, with most individuals experiencing steadily declining tic severity as they pass through adolescence. One study showed no correlation with tic severity and the onset of <b>puberty,</b> in contrast with the popular belief that tics increase at <b>puberty.</b> In many cases, a complete remission of tic symptoms occurs after adolescence. However, a study using videotape to record tics in adults found that, although tics diminished in comparison with childhood, and all measures of tic severity improved by adulthood, 90% of adults still had tics. Half of the adults who considered themselves tic-free still displayed evidence of tics.|$|E
5|$|Sheep {{follow a}} similar {{reproductive}} strategy to other herd animals. A group of ewes is generally mated {{by a single}} ram, who has either been chosen by a breeder or (in feral populations) has established dominance through physical contest with other rams. Most sheep are seasonal breeders, although some are able to breed year-round. Ewes generally reach sexual maturity at six to eight months old, and rams generally at four to six months. However, there are exceptions. For example, Finnsheep ewe lambs may reach <b>puberty</b> as early as 3 to 4 months, and Merino ewes sometimes reach <b>puberty</b> at 18 to 20 months. Ewes have estrus cycles about every 17 days, during which they emit a scent and indicate readiness through physical displays towards rams. A minority of rams (8% on average) display a preference for homosexuality and {{a small number of}} the females that were accompanied by a male fetus in utero are freemartins (female animals that are behaviorally masculine and lack functioning ovaries).|$|E
5|$|The sebaceous glands {{of a human}} fetus secrete a {{substance}} called vernix caseosa, a waxy, translucent white substance coating the skin of newborns. After birth, activity of the glands decreases until {{there is almost no}} activity during ages 2–6 years, and then increases to a peak of activity during <b>puberty,</b> due to heightened levels of androgens.|$|E
5|$|The story {{depicts a}} young student named Shuichi Nitori, {{described}} by the author as a transgender girl, and Shuichi's friend Yoshino Takatsuki, described as a transgender boy. The series deals with issues such as being transgender, gender identity, {{and the beginning of}} <b>puberty.</b> Shimura was originally going to write the story about a girl in high school {{who wants to be a}} boy, but she realized that a boy who wants to be a girl before entering into <b>puberty</b> would have a lot of worries related to growing up, and changed the story to fit this model. Wandering Son was selected as a recommended work by the awards jury of the tenth Japan Media Arts Festival in 2006. The series has been lauded for its use of gender reversal as the core of the story, though the emotional realism of the young characters has been called into question.|$|E
5|$|According to {{traditional}} sources Aisha was {{six or seven}} years old when betrothed to Muhammad, with the marriage not being consummated until she had reached <b>puberty</b> at the age of nine or ten years old. She was therefore a virgin at marriage. Modern Muslim authors who calculate Aisha's age based on other sources of information, such that available about her sister Asma about whom more is known, estimate that she was over thirteen and perhaps in her late teens {{at the time of her}} marriage.|$|E
5|$|Cats {{are ready}} to go to new homes at about 12 weeks of age, when they {{are ready to}} leave their mother. They can be surgically sterilized (spayed or castrated) as early as 7 weeks to limit {{unwanted}} reproduction. This surgery also prevents undesirable sex-related behavior, such as aggression, territory marking (spraying urine) in males and yowling (calling) in females. Traditionally, this surgery was performed at around six to nine months of age, but it is increasingly being performed prior to <b>puberty,</b> at about three to six months. In the US, about 80% of household cats are neutered.|$|E
5|$|Deficiency of {{luteinizing hormone}} (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), {{together}} {{referred to as}} the gonadotropins, leads to different symptoms in men and women. Women experience oligo- or amenorrhea (infrequent/light or absent menstrual periods respectively) and infertility. Men lose facial, scrotal and trunk hair, as well as suffering decreased muscle mass and anemia. Both sexes may experience a decrease in libido and loss of sexual function, and have an increased risk of osteoporosis (bone fragility). Lack of LH/FSH in children is associated with delayed <b>puberty.</b>|$|E
5|$|Elves {{are born}} about one year from their {{conception}}. The {{day of their}} conception is celebrated, not the actual birthday itself. Their minds develop more quickly than their bodies; by their first year, they can speak, walk and even dance, and their quicker onset of mental maturity makes young Elves seem, to Men, older than they really are. Physical <b>puberty</b> comes in around their fiftieth to one hundredth year (by age fifty they reach their adult height), and by their first hundred years of life outside the womb all Elves are fully grown. Elven bodies eventually stop aging physically, while human bodies do not.|$|E
5|$|For most girls, {{childhood}} {{came to an}} {{end with}} the onset of <b>puberty,</b> which was followed shortly after by betrothal and marriage. Although marriage arranged by the family was the norm, romantic love was not unknown. Most women bore many children but few survived infancy, and grief for the loss of a loved one was an inalienable part of life. The main form of birth control was abstinence, and while there is evidence of contraception it seems to have been mainly used by prostitutes.|$|E
5|$|In 2015, acne was {{estimated}} to affect 633 million people globally, making it the 8th most common disease worldwide. Acne commonly occurs in adolescence and affects an estimated 80–90% of teenagers in the Western world. Lower rates are reported in some rural societies. Children and adults may also be affected before and after <b>puberty.</b> Although acne becomes less common in adulthood, it persists in nearly half of affected people into their twenties and thirties and a smaller group continue to have difficulties into their forties.|$|E
5|$|It is {{important}} for forensic anthropologists {{to take into account}} all available markers in the determination of sex due to the differences that can occur between individuals of the same sex. For example, it is possible that a female may have a slightly more narrow than normal pubic arch. It {{is for this reason that}} anthropologists usually classify sex as one of five possibilities: male, may be male, indeterminate, may be female, or female. In addition, forensic anthropologists are generally unable to make a sex determination unless the individual was an adult at the time of death. The sexual dimorphisms present in the skeleton begin to occur during <b>puberty</b> and are not fully pronounced until after sexual maturation.|$|E
5|$|On 14 July 1909, Ramanujan married Janaki (Janakiammal) (21 March 1899 – 13 April 1994), a girl whom {{his mother}} had {{selected}} for him a year earlier, and who was {{was ten years old}} when they married. It was not unusual for marriages to be arranged with young girls. She came from Rajendram, a village close to Marudur (Karur district) Railway Station. Ramanujan's father did not participate in the marriage ceremony. As was common at that time, Janakiammal continued to stay at her maternal home for three years after marriage till she attained <b>puberty.</b> In 1912, she and Ramanujan's mother joined Ramanujan in Madras.|$|E
5|$|The main {{hormonal}} {{driver of}} oily sebum {{production in the}} skin is dihydrotestosterone. Another androgenic hormone responsible for increased sebaceous gland activity is DHEA-S. Higher amounts of DHEA-S are secreted during adrenarche (a stage of <b>puberty),</b> and this leads {{to an increase in}} sebum production. In a sebum-rich skin environment, the naturally occurring and largely commensal skin bacterium P. acnes readily grows and can cause inflammation within and around the follicle due to activation of the innate immune system. P. acnes triggers skin inflammation in acne by increasing the production of several pro-inflammatory chemical signals (such as IL-1α, IL-8, TNF-α, and LTB4); IL-1α is known to be essential to comedo formation.|$|E
5|$|Typically {{carried out}} by a {{traditional}} circumciser using a blade, FGM is conducted from days after birth to <b>puberty</b> and beyond. In half the countries for which national figures are available, most girls are cut {{before the age of}} five. Procedures differ according to the country or ethnic group. They include removal of the clitoral hood and clitoral glans; removal of the inner labia; and removal of the inner and outer labia and closure of the vulva. In this last procedure, known as infibulation, a small hole is left for the passage of urine and menstrual fluid; the vagina is opened for intercourse and opened further for childbirth.|$|E
5|$|Acne is a {{very common}} problem, {{particularly}} during <b>puberty</b> in teenagers, and is thought to relate to an increased production of sebum due to hormonal factors. The increased production of sebum {{can lead to a}} blockage of the sebaceous gland duct. This can cause a comedo, (commonly called a blackhead or a whitehead), which can lead to infection, particularly by the bacteria Propionibacterium acnes. This can inflame the comedones, which then change into the characteristic acne lesions. Comedones generally occur on the areas with more sebaceous glands, particularly the face, shoulders, upper chest and back. Comedones may be 'black' or 'white' depending on whether the entire pilosebaceous unit, or just the sebaceous duct, is blocked. Sebaceous filaments—innocuous build-ups of sebum—are often mistaken for whiteheads.|$|E
5|$|Almost 25% {{of women}} will {{experience}} {{mental health issues}} over their lifetime. Women are at higher risk than men from anxiety, depression, and psychosomatic complaints. Globally, depression is the leading disease burden. In the United States, women have depression twice as often as men. The economic costs of depression in American women {{are estimated to be}} $20 billion every year. The risks of depression in women have been linked to changing hormonal environment that women experience, including <b>puberty,</b> menstruation, pregnancy, childbirth and the menopause. Women also metabolise drugs used to treat depression differently to men. Suicide rates are less in women than men (<1% vs. 2.4%), but are a leading cause of death for women under the age of 60.|$|E
5|$|Educator Daniel Challener, in his 1997 book Stories of Resilience in Childhood, {{analyzed}} {{the events in}} Caged Bird to illustrate resiliency in children. Challener states that Angelou's book provides a useful framework for exploring the obstacles many children like Maya face and how a community helps these children succeed as Angelou did. Psychologist Chris Boyatzis has used Caged Bird to supplement scientific theory and research in the instruction of child development topics such as the development of self-concept and self-esteem, ego resilience, industry versus inferiority, effects of abuse, parenting styles, sibling and friendship relations, gender issues, cognitive development, <b>puberty,</b> and identity formation in adolescence. He has called the book a highly effective tool for providing real-life examples of these psychological concepts.|$|E
5|$|Elephants have a fission–fusion {{society in}} which {{multiple}} family groups come together to socialise. Males ("bulls") leave their family groups when they reach <b>puberty</b> and may live alone or with other males. Adult bulls mostly interact with family groups when looking for a mate and enter a state of increased testosterone and aggression known as musth, which helps them gain dominance and reproductive success. Calves are the centre of attention in their family groups and rely on their mothers {{for as long as}} three years. Elephants can live up to 70 years in the wild. They communicate by touch, sight, smell, and sound; elephants use infrasound, and seismic communication over long distances. Elephant intelligence has been compared with that of primates and cetaceans. They appear to have self-awareness and show empathy for dying or dead individuals of their kind.|$|E
5|$|Eugenides {{and several}} critics {{compared}} Cal's condition to mythical creatures {{described by the}} ancient Greeks. The author alluded his protagonist's nature and heritage to the Minotaur, the half-man and half-bull creature. Cal's father is conceived after his grandparents' attendance of a theatric play entitled The Minotaur. The puzzle of Cal's genetic identity is akin to the creature's labyrinth, and the thread that leads out of the maze is held here by his paternal grandmother, a former silk farmer. Frances Bartkowski, a scholar of English, named Callie in her <b>puberty</b> as a chimera. The mythical monster is an analogy for a complex personality, a mixture of body parts from various animals that each represents a human aspect or characteristic. Similarly, adolescent Callie is an amalgamation of her genes, neither male nor female, neither adult nor child, and yet all {{of them at the}} same time.|$|E
5|$|Female hippos reach sexual {{maturity}} at {{five to six}} years and have a gestation period of eight months. A study of endocrine systems revealed that female hippopotamuses may begin <b>puberty</b> as early as three or four years. Males reach maturity at around 7.5 yr. A study of hippopotamus reproductive behaviour in Uganda showed that peak conceptions occurred during {{the end of the}} wet season in the summer, and peak births occurred toward the beginning of the wet season in late winter. This is because of the female's oestrous cycle; as with most large mammals, male hippopotamus spermatozoa is active year-round. Studies of hippos in Zambia and South Africa also showed evidence of births occurring {{at the start of the}} wet season. After becoming pregnant, a female hippopotamus will typically not begin ovulation again for 17 months.|$|E
5|$|In 1988, Jackson {{released}} his only autobiography, Moonwalk, which took {{four years to}} complete and sold 200,000 copies. He wrote about his childhood, the Jackson 5, and the abuse he had suffered. He also wrote about his changing facial appearance, attributing it to <b>puberty,</b> weight loss, a strict vegetarian diet, a change in hairstyle, and stage lighting. Moonwalk reached the top position on The New York Times best sellers' list. Jackson released a film, Moonwalker, which featured live footage and short films starring Jackson and Joe Pesci. Due to financial issues, the film was only released theatrically in Germany; in other markets it was released direct-to-video. It debuted {{at the top of}} the Billboard Top Music Video Cassette chart, staying there for 22 weeks. It was eventually knocked off the top spot by Michael Jackson: The Legend Continues.|$|E
5|$|Much like elephants, {{manatees}} are polyphyodonts, and continuously replace {{their teeth}} {{from the back}} of the jaw. Adults lack incisors, canines, and premolars, and instead have 8 to 10 cheek teeth in their mouth. Manatees have an infinite supply of teeth moving in from the back and shedding in the front, which are continuously formed by a dental capsule behind the tooth-row. These teeth are constantly worn down by the abrasive vascular plants they forage, particularly aquatic grasses. Unlike in manatees, the dugong's teeth do not continually grow back via horizontal tooth replacement. The dugong has two tusks which emerge in males during <b>puberty,</b> and sometime later in life for females after reaching the base of the premaxilla. The number of growth layer groups in a tusk indicates the age of a dugong.|$|E
5|$|Periyar {{fought against}} the {{orthodox}} traditions of marriage as suppression of women in Tamil Nadu and throughout the Indian sub-continent. Though arranged marriages were meant to enable a couple to live together throughout life, it was manipulated to enslave women. Much worse was the practice of child marriages practised throughout India at the time. It was believed {{that it would be}} a sin to marry after <b>puberty.</b> Another practice, which is prevalent today, is the dowry system where the bride's family is supposed to give the husband a huge payment for the bride. The purpose of this was to assist the newly wedded couple financially, but in many instances dowries were misused by bridegrooms. The outcome of this abuse turned to the exploitation of the bride's parents wealth, and in certain circumstances, lead to dowry deaths. There have been hundreds of thousands of cases where wives have been murdered, mutilated, and burned alive because the father of the bride was unable to make the dowry payment to the husband. Periyar fiercely stood up against this abuse meted out against women.|$|E
