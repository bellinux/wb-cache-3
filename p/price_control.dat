5|$|Liquor {{was another}} {{profitable}} private industry nationalized {{by the central}} government in 98 BC. However, this was repealed in 81 BC and a property tax rate of two coins for every 0.2L (0.05 gallons) was levied for those who traded it privately. By 110 BC Emperor Wu also interfered with the profitable trade in grain when he eliminated speculation by selling government-stored grain {{at a lower price}} than demanded by merchants. Apart from Emperor Ming's creation of a short-lived Office for Price Adjustment and Stabilization, which was abolished in 68 AD, central-government <b>price</b> <b>control</b> regulations were largely absent during the Eastern Han.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: <b>Price</b> <b>controls</b> are a {{contentious}} topic {{in society and}} hence a good source for economics classroom engagement. The standard textbook analysis of <b>price</b> <b>controls</b> is lacking, however. This paper presents real-world examples and classroom exercises {{on the topic of}} <b>price</b> <b>controls.</b> The exercises complement the standard textbook analysis of <b>price</b> <b>controls</b> by including costs related to misallocation and quality degradation. The discussion questions and analytical exercises provide students with a broad view of <b>price</b> <b>controls</b> and their policy implications...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the use of}} <b>price</b> <b>controls</b> on pharmaceuticals, while controlling for both market structure and of firm (and product) characteristics, in estimating the extent and timing of the launch of new drugs around the world. <b>Price</b> <b>controls</b> are {{found to have a}} statistically and quantitatively important effect on pharmaceutical launches. Drugs invented by firms headquartered in countries that use <b>price</b> <b>controls</b> reach fewer markets and take longer to diffuse than products that originate in countries without <b>price</b> <b>controls.</b> <b>Price</b> <b>controls</b> have a non-uniform impact on firms in different countries; in particular, Italian and Japanese firms tend to introduce their products in <b>price</b> <b>controlled</b> markets more quickly than American or British firms. Companies delay launch into price-controlled markets, and are less likely to introduce their products in additional markets after entering a country with <b>price</b> <b>controls.</b> Overall, the results suggest that a country’s use of <b>price</b> <b>controls</b> not only has a substantial impact on entry into that market, but into other countries as well...|$|R

5|$|After {{all that}} has been said and done, {{what are we to}} make of Lloyd George’s legacy as a war leader? On the home front he {{achieved}} varied results in tackling difficult, and in some instances, unprecedented problems. It would be hard to have improved on his dealings with labour and the program to increase homegrown food, but in the sectors of manpower, <b>price</b> <b>control</b> and food distribution he adopted the same approach as his predecessor, taking action only in response to the changing nature of the conflict. In the vital area of national morale, while he did not have the technical advantages of Churchill, his personal conduct damaged his ability to do more to inspire the nation. All things considered, it is unlikely that any of his political contemporaries could have handled matters at home as effectively as he did, although it can be argued that if someone else had been in charge, the difference would not have been sufficient to change the final outcome. In his conduct of the war he did advance the cause of the Entente significantly in some ways, but in determining strategy, one of the most important tasks for which a prime minister must be responsible, he was undeniably a failure. To sum up, while Lord George's contributions outweighed his mistakes, the margin is too narrow, in my opinion, to include him In the pantheon of Britain's outstanding war leaders.|$|E

50|$|Another method {{attempted}} in {{the past}} have been wage and <b>price</b> <b>controls</b> ("incomes policies").

40|$|Most economists’ instinctive {{reaction}} to <b>price</b> <b>controls</b> {{is that they}} are harmful. If enforced, they result in shortages and resource misallocation. With weak enforcement they often result in black markets, and high transaction costs. In this paper we assess {{the pros and cons of}} rice <b>price</b> <b>controls</b> in Vietnam given these instincts. We argue that these <b>price</b> <b>controls</b> fix producer <b>prices</b> and allow government marketing agencies to sell at higher prices and hence are, in part, a revenue raising device. As such they may be part of an efficient tax mix, particularly so since agricultural incomes and production go untaxed under the formal tax system. We also argue that such controls can act to dampen costly domestic adjustments in the face of volatile world prices. We develop a multi sector multi household general equilibrium model to numerically analyse the consequences of these <b>price</b> <b>controls,</b> and show that this system can be supported as welfare enhancing under conditions which currently prevail in the Vietnamese economy. The case against <b>price</b> <b>controls</b> may hold in other circumstances, but in this case the arguments seem to be more nuanced. <b>Price</b> <b>controls,</b> General Equilibrium, Tax-mix, Rice, Vietnam...|$|R
40|$|<b>Price</b> <b>controls</b> {{have always}} aroused controversy. Before the Second World War, most economists {{saw them as}} either {{impossible}} to implement or unwise. Even during wartime it was widely believed that prices should remain as free as possible. Many economists saw benefits to <b>price</b> <b>controls</b> during the war, but also identified numerous costs to these controls. They also tended to favor limited <b>price</b> <b>controls,</b> applying to only those goods needed to fight the war. John Kenneth Galbraith was generally sympathetic to <b>price</b> <b>controls</b> during the war. He too supported limited controls, but then {{changed his mind and}} supported more extensive <b>price</b> <b>controls</b> during the Second World War. After the war, inflation tended to reappear long before full-employment was reached, even when production and employment were falling. From his wartime experiences, Galbraith tried to draw lessons for peacetime inflation. He proposed price and wage monitoring for a few hundred big companies and the unions with whom they negotiate. ...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the success of <b>price</b> <b>controls</b> in {{stabilizing}} high inflation rates and their effects on the real economy under an imperfect competition setting derived by optimal maximization. Our model builds on Helpman 2 ̆ 019 s work of <b>price</b> <b>controls</b> and imperfect competition, and incorporates inflation inertia through adaptive expectations. The model predicts that under these circumstances <b>price</b> <b>controls</b> can be an effective method of curving inflation when they accompany an orthodox monetary restriction programme; incomes policies alone cannot curve inflation substantially. Efforts where monetary growth is decreased gradually and <b>price</b> <b>controls</b> are implemented to achieve zero inflation result in the boom-recession cycle observed in many real life programmes. When monetary growth is curved immediately and <b>price</b> <b>controls</b> are implemented to achieve zero inflation, there follows a recession and not a boom.

25|$|In {{mainstream}} economic theory, a {{free market}} rations an increasingly scarce commodity by increasing its price. A higher price should stimulate producers to produce more, and consumers to consume less, while possibly shifting to substitutes. The first three mitigation strategies in the above list are, therefore, in keeping with mainstream economic theory, as government policies can affect the supply and demand for petroleum {{as well as the}} availability of substitutes. In contrast, the last type of strategy in the list (attempting to shield consumers from rising prices) would seem to work against classical economic theory, by encouraging consumers to overconsume the scarce quantity, thus making it even scarcer. To avoid creating outright shortages, attempts at <b>price</b> <b>control</b> may require some sort of rationing scheme.|$|E

25|$|Two {{developments}} {{dominated the}} decade that followed: the increasingly apparent crumbling of the Soviet Union's {{economic and political}} structures, and the patchwork attempts at reforms to reverse that process. After the rapid succession of former KGB Chief Yuri Andropov and Konstantin Chernenko, transitional figures with deep roots in Brezhnevite tradition, Mikhail Gorbachev announced perestroika {{in an attempt to}} modernize Soviet communism, and made significant changes in the party leadership. However, Gorbachev's social reforms led to unintended consequences. Because of his policy of glasnost, which facilitated public access to information after decades of government repression, social problems received wider public attention, undermining the Communist Party's authority. In the revolutions of 1989 the USSR lost its allies in Eastern Europe. Glasnost allowed ethnic and nationalist disaffection to reach the surface. Many constituent republics, especially the Baltic republics, Georgian SSR and Moldavian SSR, sought greater autonomy, which Moscow was unwilling to provide. Gorbachev's attempts at economic reform were not sufficient, and the Soviet government left intact most of the fundamental elements of communist economy. Suffering from low pricing of petroleum and natural gas, ongoing war in Afghanistan, outdated industry and pervasive corruption, the Soviet planned economy proved to be ineffective, and by 1990 the Soviet government had lost control over economic conditions. Due to <b>price</b> <b>control,</b> there were shortages of almost all products, reaching their peak in the end of 1991, when people had to stand in long lines and to be lucky enough to buy even the essentials. Control over the constituent republics was also relaxed, and they began to assert their national sovereignty over Moscow.|$|E

25|$|At last Gorbachev {{attempted}} {{to restructure the}} Soviet Union into a less centralized state. However, on 19 August 1991, a coup against Gorbachev, conspired by senior Soviet officials, was attempted. The coup faced wide popular opposition and collapsed in three days, but disintegration of the Union became imminent. The Russian government took {{over most of the}} Soviet Union government institutions on its territory. Because of the dominant position of Russians in the Soviet Union, most gave little thought to any distinction between Russia and the Soviet Union before the late 1980s. In the Soviet Union, only Russian SFSR lacked even the paltry instruments of statehood that the other republics possessed, such as its own republic-level Communist Party branch, trade union councils, Academy of Sciences, and the like. The Communist Party of the Soviet Union was banned in Russia in 1991–1992, although no lustration has ever taken place, and many of its members became top Russian officials. However, as the Soviet government was still opposed to market reforms, the economic situation continued to deteriorate. By December 1991, the shortages had resulted in the introduction of food rationing in Moscow and Saint Petersburg {{for the first time since}} World War II. Russia received humanitarian food aid from abroad. After the Belavezha Accords, the Supreme Soviet of Russia withdrew Russia from the Soviet Union on 12 December. The Soviet Union officially ended on 25 December 1991, and the Russian Federation (formerly the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic) took power on 26 December. The Russian government lifted <b>price</b> <b>control</b> on January 1992. Prices rose dramatically, but shortages disappeared.|$|E
