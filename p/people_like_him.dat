5|$|As {{a student}} holidaying in coastal towns, Hesketh had {{become aware of}} the lack of resorts in Lancashire. He was {{concerned}} that the working classes of Lancashire could not afford to travel south for their holidays as wealthy <b>people</b> <b>like</b> <b>him</b> could. The number of railways in Great Britain steadily increased {{in the first half of}} the 19th century, and Hesketh was impressed by the arrival in 1828 of the steam locomotive in Lancashire. As High Sheriff of Lancashire, he attended the opening of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway on 15 December 1830. The event filled him with great excitement at the idea of bringing the railway to the coast and enabling Lancashire mill workers to take day-trips to the seaside.|$|E
5|$|In this situation, {{the court}} had decided in {{previous}} cases that immigration detention, {{for the purposes of}} processing and removal, did not infringe on Chapter III. Al-Kateb argued that if indeed the provisions of the Migration Act extended as far as to allow the indefinite detention of <b>people</b> <b>like</b> <b>him,</b> then it would have gone beyond those valid purposes and would infringe Chapter III. That is, non-judicial detention is permitted for the purposes of facilitating the removal of unlawful non-citizens, and if the prospects of removal are remote or impracticable for the reasonably foreseeable future, then the detention can no longer be considered to be for the purpose of removal. Al-Kateb's argument in this respect relied on a decision of the Federal Court in another case, Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v Al Masri, in which a Full Court of the Federal Court found that a person in a very similar situation to Al-Kateb was entitled to be released.|$|E
5|$|Things {{come to a}} {{head the}} day after the party. As Cassandra uses a voodoo doll on Masha, trying to dissuade {{thoughts}} of selling the house, Sonia receives {{a phone call from a}} man she met at the party, requesting a date. Hesitantly, she accepts. Vanya, who is secretly writing a play inspired by Konstantin's imagined symbolist drama in The Seagull, is convinced by Nina to let her read it in front of the others. During the reading (which stars Nina as a molecule and takes place after the destruction of the earth), Spike rudely answers a text on his phone, and dismisses Vanya's suggestion of a handwritten response. Vanya reacts by launching into an impassioned rant, criticizing America's cultural regression in communication and media, while fondly and wistfully recalling the surroundings and memories of his childhood. Concluding that the intent of such progress seems to make <b>people</b> <b>like</b> <b>him</b> feel lost and forgotten, he retreats into the kitchen in tears.|$|E

25|$|At the {{suggestion}} of farmer Dr. Anton Schott, a graduate in Theology and Philosophy, Koerner, together with other Latin Farmers, in 1836 founded the public library in Belleville, probably the first in Illinois. Although he had never pursued agriculture as a profession, he is counted among the group of Latin farmers, which was a half-satirical, half-respectful designation for <b>people</b> <b>like</b> <b>him,</b> German immigrants in the United States who had received an advanced academic education.|$|E

As Michael leaves in the car, Gemini calls Michael and {{explains}} that he was intrigued by Michael's success in tracking him down. He broke into Evans' office, read her files, and asks Michael if he is awake or asleep.

500|$|Many Republicans were touting Huntsman as a {{possible}} rising star in the party {{and that he has}} a role in reshaping the party. Utah businessman Republican activist Tim Bridgewater said [...] "Huntsman has a very bright future." [...] Huntsman said that [...] "I {{think there will be a}} lot of personalities emerging between now and 2012. I think the party needs to be smart enough to maintain an open mind. Obama was nowhere on the radar screen four years ago." [...] In June 2009, Huntsman top advisor John Weaver, who was also an advisor for McCain, claimed [...] "I firmly believe that Huntsman and <b>people</b> <b>like</b> <b>him</b> are the prescription for what ails us. But I have the feeling that our party maybe won't order that prescription in 2012." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{album was}} {{released}} in September 2008 and debuted at number two on the Billboard 200 chart. Lovato recalled the experience, [...] "It was like, O.K., you've done it. You're no longer just succeeding because you're in a movie with the Jonas Brothers. These people bought your music for you." [...] Later in February 2009, Lovato's first headlining sitcom, Sonny with a Chance, premiered on Disney Channel. Don't Forget was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and spawned two singles, [...] "Get Back" [...] and [...] "La La Land". In January 2009, Lovato announced to MTV News that she had already begun writing songs for her second studio album, as well as revealing its approach: [...] "It's {{going to take a}} different sound, so hopefully it goes over well. I sing a lot of rock, but this time I want to do more John Mayer-ish type of songs. Hopefully I can write with <b>people</b> <b>like</b> <b>him.</b> I love their music — it would be amazing." ...|$|E
500|$|Webb {{felt that}} the Lizard was the best villain because, [...] "He's the literal {{embodiment}} of {{the theme of the}} movie, which is we all have a missing piece. He has no arm. Peter has no parents, and he fills that void with Spider-Man." [...] Producer Avi Arad felt likewise, explaining, [...] "ou look at Peter, he misses the parents, [...] Connors has one arm. ...motionally, [...] is a very similar problem. It is a cautionary tale." [...] Webb said that the Lizard [...] "is not the worst villain on the planet. He's not a mustache-twirling guy who wants to terrorize people. He believes he's doing the right thing." [...] Actor Rhys Ifans described his character as a flawed character comparable to Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. [...] "Curt Connors is by no means an evil villain," [...] Ifans stated. [...] "He's not like the Batman villains, like the Joker, who are the embodiment of evil. Curtis Connors is a great man who makes a bad decision. ... hat's the whole magic of the Spider-Man idea. These people are the embodiment of our flaws and our desires that lead to tragedy." [...] Ifans described Connors as a force for good throughout his life: [...] "He's a geneticist who wants to help <b>people,</b> <b>like</b> <b>him,</b> who are limbless. In his eagerness to advance that science, he makes a mistake and that's an occurrence we've seen throughout time, sometimes to our benefit, sometimes to our detriment." [...] "...He is a broken man who wants to fix himself." [...] Ifans added, [...] "I'm not portraying a villain in any sense. Connors does feel cheated by God, and he's looking for answers in science. God seems to intervene." ...|$|E

2500|$|In France, Bourdieu {{was seen}} {{not as an}} ivory tower {{academic}} or [...] "cloistered don" [...] but as a passionate activist for those he believed to be subordinated by society. In 2001, a documentary film about Bourdieu – Sociology is a Martial Art – [...] "became an unexpected hit in Paris. Its very title stressed {{how much of a}} politically engaged intellectual Bourdieu was, taking on the mantle of Émile Zola and Jean-Paul Sartre in French public life and slugging it out with politicians because he thought that was what <b>people</b> <b>like</b> <b>him</b> should do." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Platonism" [...] {{is a term}} {{coined by}} {{scholars}} {{to refer to the}} intellectual consequences of denying, as Plato's Socrates often does, the reality of the material world. In several dialogues, most notably the Republic, Socrates inverts the common man's intuition about what is knowable and what is real. While most people take the objects of their senses to be real if anything is, Socrates is contemptuous of people who think that something has to be graspable in the hands to be real. In the Theaetetus, he says such people are eu amousoi (εὖ ἄμουσοι), an expression that means literally, [...] "happily without the muses" [...] (Theaetetus 156a). In other words, such people live without the divine inspiration that gives him, and <b>people</b> <b>like</b> <b>him,</b> access to higher insights about reality.|$|E

In October 1991 after protests in part of Columbus Day and Dia de la Raza celebrations, the Fallon statue plan was scrapped and the statue was stored in a warehouse in Oakland for more than a decade. The statue was returned to public display in 2002, albeit in a less conspicuous location: Pellier Park, a small triangular patch formed by the merge of West Julian and West St. James streets.|$|E
2500|$|Gloucester assures Eleanor {{that as long}} as he has truth on his side, {{his enemies}} cannot destroy him: [...] "I must offend before I be attainted,/And had I twenty times so many foes,/And each of them had twenty times their power,/All these could not procure me any scathe/So long as I am loyal, true, and crimeless" [...] (2.4.60–64). His claims prove false, however, as he is arrested on false charges and then assassinated before his trial. Later in the play, Lord Saye makes a similar claim. When Buckingham warns him to be careful as the rebels are {{targeting}} <b>people</b> <b>like</b> <b>him,</b> Saye responds [...] "The trust I have is in mine innocence,/And therefore am I bold and resolute" [...] (4.4.58-59).

60|$|That {{is how we}} came by the Dwarf; and a good fellow he was. Joan {{picked him}} out on sight, but it wasn't a mistake; {{no one could be}} faithfuler than he was, and he was a devil and the son of a devil when he turned himself loose with his ax. He was so big that he made the Paladin look like an {{ordinary}} man. He <b>liked</b> to <b>like</b> <b>people,</b> therefore <b>people</b> <b>liked</b> <b>him.</b> He <b>liked</b> us boys from the start; and he liked the knights, and liked pretty much everybody he came across; but he thought more of a paring of Joan's finger-nail than he did of {{all the rest of the}} world put together.|$|R
