40|$|Chilling at 2. 5 C {{accelerated}} {{the synthesis of}} 1 -aminocyclopropane- 1 -carboxylic acid (ACC) and C 2 H 4 production in cucumber fruit. Skin tissue contained higher levels of ACC and was more sensitive to chilling than was cortex tissue. Accumulation of ACC in chilled tissue was detected after 1 day of chilling and remained elevated even after C 2 H 4 production started to decline. These data suggest that ACC synthesis is readily stimulated by chilling, whereas the system that converts ACC to C 2 H 4 is vulnerable to chilling injury. Chilling-induced C 2 H 4 production was inhibited by amino-ethoxyvinylglycine, sodium <b>benzoate,</b> <b>propyl</b> gallate, 2, 4 -dinitrophenol, carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone, and cycloheximide. The utilization of methionine for ACC formation and chilling-induced C 2 H 4 biosynthesis was established using l-[3, 4 - 14 C]methionine. Chilled tissue had a higher capacity to convert l-[3, 4 - 14 C]methionine to ACC and C 2 H 4 than did nonchilled tissue...|$|R
40|$|Ethyl 2 -((2, 3 -bis(nitrooxy) <b>propyl)</b> disulfanyl) <b>benzoate</b> (GT- 094) {{is a novel}} {{nitric oxide}} (NO) chimera {{containing}} an nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) andNOmoieties and also a disulfide pharmacophore that in itself exhibits cancer chemopreventive activity. In this study, the effects and mechanism of action of GT- 094 were investigated in RKO and SW 480 colon cancer cells. GT- 094 inhibited cell proliferation and induced apoptosis in both cell lines and this was accompanied by decreasedmitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and these responseswere reversed after cotreatmentwith the antioxidant glutathione. GT- 094 also downregulated genes associated with cell growth [cyclin D 1, hepatocyte growth factor receptor (c-Met), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) ], survival (bcl- 2, survivin), and angiogenesis [VEGF and its receptors (VEGFR 1 andVEGFR 2) ]. Results of previous RNA interference studies in this laboratory has shown that these genes are regulated, in part, by specificity protein (Sp) transcription factors Sp 1, Sp 3, and Sp 4 that are overexpressed in colon and other cancer cell lines and not surprisingly, GT- 094 also decreased Sp 1, Sp 3, and Sp 4 in colon cancer cells. GT- 094 –mediated repression of Sp and Sp-regulated gene products was due to downregulation of microRNA- 27 a (miR- 27 a) and induction of ZBTB 10, an Sp repressor that is regulated by miR- 27 a in colon cancer cells. Moreover, the effects of GT- 094 on Sp 1, Sp 3, Sp 4, miR- 27 a, and ZBTB 10 were also inhibited by glutathione suggesting that the anticancer activity of GT- 094 in colon cancer cells is due, in part, to activation of an ROS-miR- 27 a:ZBTB 10 -Sp transcription factor pathway.

40|$|Abstract The {{structure}} and dynamics of pure and mixed liquid aromatic esters is studied through microwave dielectric relaxation spectroscopy in the 200 MHz – 20 GHz frequency range. Methyl, ethyl, <b>propyl</b> and butyl <b>benzoate</b> were studied at 298. 15 K to infer the alkylic chain length effect on solvents properties {{showing that the}} relaxational behaviour for the four esters is properly described with a single Debye type function for the considered range. Methylbenzoate behaviour was also analyzed in the 278. 15 – 358. 15 K temperature range to study the temperature effect on their properties. Experiments on phenyl acetate were carried out to analyze the effect of aromatic ring position on fluid structure. We have also considered the properties at 298. 15 K of different methylbenzoate containing mixed fluids with n-hexane, cyclohexane, 1 -chlorohexane, 1 -hexanol, hexanoic acid and diisopropyl ether to study the effect of different functional groups on fluid structure upon mixing. All the binary mixtures studied are properly described using a bimodal Debye process in the whole composition range. Data are analyzed {{in terms of the}} proposed different species present in the fluids and their evolution with composition for mixtures, and with temperature and chain length for pure esters.

40|$|Biochemical changes {{occurring}} in developing green peas were studied {{in order to}} understand the textural and flavor changes. The activity of pectinmethylesterase (PME), a pectin modifying enzyme, was measured by the continuous spectrophotometric assay. Specific activity of PME decreased over all varieties and all sieve sizes as the seeds matured. Chelate soluble pectin contents were decreased or remained constant in all varieties. Decreased PME activity and pectin content indicated that the crosslinking of pectin and calcium might not play an important role in the firmness of green peas. The moisture level decreased as maturity increased, which was inversely related to an increase in protein and nonpectin carbohydrate polymers;Sensory analyses showed that all cultivars except one of the round seeded samples exhibited increased firmness as they matured. The pastiness attribute significantly increased in all cultivars. The seed coat toughness and green pea flavor changed in a less consistent fashion. The sweetest scores for all cultivars decreased throughout the study;For all cultivars, the most abundant volatile compounds were hexanal, n-nonane, methyl heptanoate, n-undecane, and <b>propyl</b> <b>benzoate.</b> Each cultivar exhibited a different pattern of changes in major volatile compounds. There was no single volatile which could be used to indicate harvestable maturity...|$|E
40|$|The antitubercular {{activity}} {{of a series}} of thiols, dithiolans, thiol esters, dimercaptopropyl esters, and episulphides has been examined in vitro and in vivo in mice infected with the H 37 Rv strain of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Most of the thiol compounds were inactive, although dimercaprol (2, 3 -dimercaptopropanol; B. A. L.) and a few closely related compounds showed slight activity in vivo, the only exception being 2, 3 -dimercaptopropyl chloride which was very active. The dithiolans were inactive, but some of the thiol esters were moderately active, in particular 2, 3 -di(acetylthio) propyl acetate and 1, 2, 3 -tri(acetylthio) propane. The majority of the dimercaptopropyl esters had significant activity, the most active compounds being 2, 3 - dimercaptopropyl benzoate, 1, 3 - dimercapto - 2 - <b>propyl</b> <b>benzoate,</b> 2, 3 - dimercaptopropyl o-chlorobenzoate, and 2, 3 -dimercaptopropyl p-chlorobenzoate. All the S-acyl derivatives of 3 -mercaptopropylene sulphide had good antitubercular activity, some being more active than streptomycin. The most active compound of the series was 3 -(2 -furoylthio) propylene sulphide. The {{activity of}} the compounds is believed to be due to their conversion in vivo to 3 -mercaptopropylene sulphide and not due to the formation of ethanethiol. Slight deviation from the basic structure abolishes antitubercular activity...|$|E
40|$|The rhizobitoxine analog, L- 2 -amino- 4 -(2 -aminoethoxy) -trans- 3 -butenoic acid (Ro), which {{effectively}} inhibits ethylene {{production in}} apple (Malus domestica Borkh.) and other tissues at concentrations at about 68 micromolar, inhibited ethylene production by about 50 to 70 % in green tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.) fruit slices {{but only by}} about 15 % in pink and ripe tomato tissue slices. Ethylene production in climacteric-rise and postclimacteric avocado slices was likewise relatively insensitive to 68 micromolar Ro. At 340 micromolar Ro, inhibition of ethylene production increased up to 50 % in pink tomato slices, whereas 680 micromolar Ro was required to inhibit ethylene production by 30 % in avocado slices. Incorporation of 14 C from [14 C]methionine into ethylene in green and pink tomato tissues was inhibited by Ro to about the same extent as inhibition of total ethylene production. Results thus far are inconclusive as to the mechanism of Ro resistance in tomato and avocado tissues. At 1 millimolar, free radical scavengers such as <b>benzoate,</b> <b>propyl</b> gallate, nordihydroguaiaretic acid, {{and to a lesser}} extent, eugenol, inhibited ethylene production in both Ro-sensitive (green tomato and apple) tissues and Ro-resistant (pink tomato and avocado) tissues. Therefore, free radical steps are suggested in the ethylene-forming systems...|$|R
