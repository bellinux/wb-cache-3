5|$|In early human {{embryonic}} life, {{a series of}} five branchial arches and four branchial pouches form {{that give rise to}} the human face, neck, and surrounding structures. The pouches are numbered such that the first <b>pouch</b> is the closest {{to the top of the}} embryo's head and the fourth is the furthest from it. The parathyroid glands originate from the interaction of the endoderm of the third and fourth <b>pouch</b> and neural crest mesenchyme. The position of the glands reverses during embryological life. The pair of glands which is ultimately inferior develops from the third <b>pouch</b> with the thymus, whereas the pair of glands which is ultimately superior develops from the fourth <b>pouch.</b> During embryological development, the thymus migrates downwards, dragging the inferior glands with it. The superior pair are not dragged downwards by the fourth <b>pouch</b> to the same degree. The glands are named after their final, not embryological, positions. Since the thymus's ultimate destination is in the mediastinum of the chest, it is occasionally possible to have ectopic parathyroids derived from the third <b>pouch</b> within the chest cavity if they fail to detach in the neck.|$|E
5|$|Krycek {{leads the}} agents to Dulles International Airport, where {{they try to}} {{apprehend}} a second courier carrying a diplomatic <b>pouch</b> from Russia. The courier leads the agents on a pursuit through the airport, but drops the <b>pouch</b> before escaping. The <b>pouch</b> is revealed to carry a seemingly unremarkable rock. Mulder has Krycek confined at the high rise apartment of Assistant Director Walter Skinner before having the rock analyzed at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. Dr. Sacks, a NASA scientist, tells Mulder and Scully that the rock is a prehistoric meteorite fragment that might contain fossilized alien bacteria.|$|E

5|$|Under each foreleg, the {{sea otter}} has a loose <b>pouch</b> of skin that extends across the chest. In this <b>pouch</b> (preferentially the left one), the animal stores {{collected}} food {{to bring to}} the surface. This <b>pouch</b> also holds a rock, unique to the otter, that is used to break open shellfish and clams. There, the sea otter eats while floating on its back, using its forepaws to tear food apart and bring it to its mouth. It can chew and swallow small mussels with their shells, whereas large mussel shells may be twisted apart. It uses its lower incisor teeth to access the meat in shellfish.|$|E
5|$|When {{it reaches}} the <b>pouch,</b> the {{underdeveloped}} joey suckles the teat {{of one of the}} four mammary glands while the others recede. The joey remains attached to the teat for 100–125 days, after which it ceases its attachment but remains in the <b>pouch</b> and continues to suckle, but more intermittently. The joey begins to leave the <b>pouch</b> and eat grass at around 200 days when it is more developed. It still suckles, more forcefully but less regularly. By 250 days, the joey no longer needs the <b>pouch,</b> and it is fully weaned at around 300–350 days. The tammar wallaby has been observed to engage in alloparental care, in which an adult may adopt another's young. Male tammars may live for around 11 years, while females live for 14 years.|$|E
5|$|Campbell's dwarf hamster has cheek pouches, {{which are}} an {{extension}} of the mouth, extending from the mouth {{all the way to the}} rear legs. Food is transferred into these pouches through the diastema. The inside of the <b>pouch</b> contains a large number of folds of dermal papillae. When the <b>pouch</b> is full, it extends and becomes part of the structure of the skin. By 11 days of age, the cheek pouches are fully grown and can carry objects up to the size of a sunflower seed. When the cheek pouches become full, they extend back to the shoulder blades, which restrict movement.|$|E

5|$|Healthy {{pelicans}} {{can usually}} {{cope with their}} lice, but sick birds may carry hundreds of individuals, which hastens their demise. The <b>pouch</b> louse Piagetiella peralis, which occurs in the <b>pouch</b> and therefore cannot be removed by preening, is usually not a serious problem, even when present in such numbers that it covers the whole interior of the <b>pouch,</b> but sometimes inflammation and bleeding may harm the host. The brown pelican has a similarly extensive range of parasites. The nematodes Contracaecum multipapillatum and C. mexicanum and the trematode Ribeiroia ondatrae have caused illness and mortality in the Puerto Rican population, possibly endangering the pelican on this island. In May 2012, hundreds of Peruvian pelicans {{were reported to have}} perished in Peru from a combination of starvation and roundworm infestation.|$|E
5|$|One temnospondyl, the dvinosaur Trimerorhachis, {{may have}} brooded young {{in an area}} between the gills called the {{pharyngeal}} <b>pouch.</b> Small bones belonging to younger Trimerorhachis individuals {{have been found in}} these pouches. The living Darwin's Frog is also a mouth brooder and would be the closest modern analogue to Trimerorhachis if it cared for its young in this way. An alternative possibility is that Trimerorhachis was cannibalistic, eating its young like many amphibians do today. If this was the case, the bones of these smaller individuals were originally located in the throat and were pushed into the pharyngeal <b>pouch</b> as the animal fossilized.|$|E
5|$|Parathyroid glands share {{a similar}} blood supply, venous {{drainage}}, and lymphatic drainage to the thyroid glands. Parathyroid glands {{are derived from}} the epithelial lining of {{the third and fourth}} branchial pouches, with the superior glands arising from the fourth <b>pouch,</b> and the inferior glands arising from the higher third <b>pouch.</b> The relative position of the inferior and superior glands, which are named according to their final location, changes because of the migration of embryological tissues.|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1983 Thiamin and {{ascorbic acid}} content and {{retention}} were determined in raw, blanched, <b>pouched</b> and canned green beans immediately after processing and after storage {{for four months}} at room temperature or at 37. 5 °C. Ascorbic acid was also determined in raw, <b>pouched</b> and canned Royal Ann cherries immediately after processing and after storage for six months at room temperature. Five replicates of green beans and three replicates of cherries were assayed. Compared to the raw green beans, the blanched green beans were higher in apparent thiamin and lower in ascorbic acid. There was significantly more thiamin and ascorbic acid in the <b>pouched</b> green beans and more ascorbic acid in the <b>pouched</b> cherries than in the canned ones. There were no significant losses in these two vitamins in the <b>pouched</b> and canned products after four months storage at room temperature. These vitamins, however, were significantly lower in the <b>pouched</b> and canned products after four months storage at 37. 8 °C. The liquid portions of the <b>pouched</b> products had significantly higher concentrations of these water soluble vitamins than the canned ones. However, {{the total amount of}} liquid portion was lower in the <b>pouched</b> than in the canned products, leading to smaller total vitamin losses in the <b>pouched</b> products. Canned green beans were yellower and lighter in color than <b>pouched</b> green beans. <b>Pouched</b> cherries were significantly darker red than the canned cherries. The <b>pouched</b> products were firmer in texture than the canned. Results of this study demonstrate that <b>pouched</b> green beans and cherries have a better nutritional value, color and texture than the canned ones...|$|R

5|$|The {{legends of}} self-wounding and the {{provision}} of blood may have arisen because of the impression a pelican sometimes gives that it is stabbing itself with its bill. In reality, it often presses this onto its chest in order to fully empty the <b>pouch.</b> Another possible derivation is the tendency of the bird to rest with its bill on its breast; the Dalmatian pelican has a blood-red <b>pouch</b> in the early breeding season and this {{may have contributed to the}} myth.|$|E
40|$|The role of tumor {{necrosis}} factor (TNF) in macrophage-dependent neutrophil accumulation {{induced by}} lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was examined {{through the use}} of cutaneous air <b>pouches</b> formed on the backs of mice. To investigate the possibility that TNF functions in LPS-induced neutrophil accumulation, we injected LPS into newly formed air <b>pouches</b> (containing relatively few endogenous macrophages), 48 -h-old air <b>pouches</b> (containing large numbers of endogenous macrophages), or newly formed air <b>pouches</b> instilled with 10 (6) alveolar macrophages (AM). Six hours after LPS injection, air <b>pouches</b> possessing either AM or endogenous macrophages contained large numbers of neutrophils. Infusion of anti-TNF immunoglobulin G into the air <b>pouches</b> inhibited LPS-induced neutrophil accumulation by 84 % in air <b>pouches</b> containing AM and 71 % in air <b>pouches</b> containing large numbers of endogenous macrophages. TNF was also capable of including neutrophil accumulation when injected into air <b>pouches</b> containing relatively large numbers of either endogenous or exogenous macrophages but not when injected into air <b>pouches</b> containing small numbers of macrophages. In addition, incubation of AM in vitro with TNF induced the AM to cause neutrophil accumulation upon injection into newly formed air <b>pouches.</b> These results indicate that TNF functions in LPS-induced neutrophil accumulation. Furthermore, the results indicate that TNF functions by enhancing the ability of macrophages to cause neutrophil emigration. This is consistent with the possibility that LPS induces TNF production and that TNF, in turn, induces macrophages to produce cytokines with inflammatory activities...|$|R

5|$|Mating {{occurs during}} the winter months. Once a female quoll has been impregnated, the folds on her abdomen convert into a <b>pouch</b> that opens at the back. The {{gestation}} period is 21 days. A baby quoll, or pup, {{is the size of}} a grain of rice. Up to 18 quolls are born in each litter, but only six survive the first two weeks. The survivors stay in their mother's <b>pouch</b> for eight weeks, suckling on one of the mother's six teats for milk. During the ninth week, the pups venture out of the <b>pouch</b> and onto the mother's back, where they remain for six weeks. Quolls reaches maturity when they are one year old, and have a natural lifespan of between two and five years. A 2008 study of the pouches of tiger quolls reported the pouches' appearance' were reliable indicators of the quolls' reproductive status: during the follicular phase, pouches were found to be red and have many secretions. After ovulation, pouches became deep and wet. Researchers can use this information to determine where a female quoll is in her ovarian cycle, which is anticipated to be helpful in breeding management.|$|E
5|$|Otters are {{the only}} marine animals {{that are capable of}} lifting and turning over rocks, which they often do with their front paws when searching for prey. The sea otter may pluck snails and other organisms from kelp and dig deep into {{underwater}} mud for clams. It is the only marine mammal that catches fish with its forepaws rather than with its teeth. Under each foreleg, sea otters have a loose <b>pouch</b> of skin that extends across the chest which they use to store collected food to bring to the surface. This <b>pouch</b> also holds a rock that is used to break open shellfish and clams, an example of tool use. The sea otters eat while floating on their backs, using their forepaws to tear food apart and bring to their mouths. Marine otters mainly feed on crustaceans and fish.|$|E

50|$|Cheek <b>pouches</b> {{have several}} roles; they allow the rapid {{collection}} of food, but {{also serve as}} temporary storage and transport. In monkeys of the subfamily of Cercopithecinae, they allow for more predigested food. Cheek <b>pouches</b> contribute {{to the protection of}} animals by allowing them to carry their food in the <b>pouches</b> to shelter, allowing them to transport their food to safer locations, as they are pressing these <b>pouches</b> {{to the back of the}} mouth with the back of the leg, or moving the jaw. The females of some species of hamster are known to hide their young in their cheek <b>pouches</b> to carry them away when they fear danger. Other species of hamsters are known to fill their <b>pouches</b> with air, allowing them to float better while they swim.The cheek <b>pouches</b> can become infected as a result of an injury caused by a sharp object inserted into them or a fight. An abscess can form, which can be confused with protuberance with stored food. If the abscess bursts and the pus contained therein is absorbed by the animal, it can be a victim of sepsis and die of the poisonous toxins. The cheek <b>pouches</b> can also turn outwards.|$|R
