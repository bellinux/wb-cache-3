5000|$|In 1884, {{the city}} counsel decided to <b>purchase</b> <b>Block</b> 32 in what archaeologists have now {{determined}} were {{the ruins of}} a pre-Columbian Hohokam community which they named [...] "La Villa". The families who had their loved ones buried in the old cemetery, had them moved to the new one. The city also reburied the unclaimed bodies in a common grave in the new cemetery. On October 8, 1884, John R. Loosley became the owner of some of the western portion of [...] "Block 32". He moved bodies from the potters field of old cemetery and buried them in {{what became known as the}} [...] "City" [...] or [...] "Loosley" [...] cemetery. In 1888, Lulu G. Porter, wife of DeForest Porter, acquired the south half of Block 32 and had it laid out as a cemetery, which is now known as Porter cemetery.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the late}} 1930s, Henry Weihofen, a young {{professor}} at CU-Boulder, had become dissatisfied with available housing options for university faculty families. With {{the help of}} university regent, Valentine Fischer, Weihofen gathered a group of junior faculty together (all on low salaries) to develop a housing plan. The eight professors were: Henry Weihofen (law), James G. Allen (history), Francis (Frank) Geck (fine arts), Morris E. Garnsey (economics), Earl F. Swisher (Asian studies), Paul V. Thompson (English), Norman A. Parker (mechanical engineering), and Elbert W. Harrington (speech). Over a series of evening meetings, the eight faculty members and their wives decided to <b>purchase</b> <b>Block</b> 17 in the Floral Park area (just east of Chautauqua Park) {{with the intention of}} creating a [...] "community housing project" [...] for the enjoyment of their growing families. At the philosophical core of their housing plan was the creation of a shared open space. The city agreed to vacate the alleyway, leaving a large, undeveloped section of land running {{through the center of the}} block. The families designated this area - The Commons.|$|E
40|$|Using {{high-frequency}} {{data from}} the European Climate Exchange (ECX), we examine the determinants of price impact of € 21 billion worth of block trades during 2008 – 2011 in the European carbon market. We find that wider bid-ask spreads and volatility are characterised by a smaller price impact. Larger levels of price impact {{are more likely to}} occur {{during the middle of the}} trading day, specifically the four-hour period between 11 a. m. and 3 p. m., than during the first or final hours. <b>Purchase</b> <b>block</b> trades induce a relatively smaller price impact on price run-up, while sell block trades exhibit a larger price impact on price run-up. We conclude that block trades on the ECX induce less price impact than in equity or conventional futures markets, and that a significant proportion of the effects contradict findings on block trades in those markets; thus, we provide the first evidence of the curious bent to block trading in the European Union emissions trading scheme...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} causes and {{consequences}} of activist <b>block</b> share <b>purchases</b> in the 1980 s. We find that activist investors {{were most likely to}} <b>purchase</b> large <b>blocks</b> of shares in highly diversified firms with poor profitability. Activists were not less likely to <b>purchase</b> <b>blocks</b> in firms with shark repellents and employee stock ownership plans. Activist <b>block</b> <b>purchases</b> were followed by increases in asset divestitures, decreases in mergers and acquisitions, and abnormal share price appreciation. Industry-adjusted operating profitability also rose. This evidence supports the view that the market for partial corporate control {{plays an important role in}} limiting agency costs in U. S. corporations. IT IS NOW WELL UNDERSTOOD that the hostile takeovers and leveraged buyouts of the 1980 s were typically followed by improvements in shareholder value and profitability. 1 Less well understood, but even more frequent, were attempts by activist minority investors to influence corporate policy and performance.

50|$|In May 1882, the Rossons <b>purchased</b> <b>Block</b> 14 (now Heritage Square) in Phoenix, from Flora’s half-sister, Margaret A. Richardson and {{her husband}} Mark P. Richardson for $1000. A {{newspaper}} article indicates that the Rossons spent $275 improving their residence in 1882, however {{the location of the}} residence is not noted. Prior to the construction of the Rosson House, {{it is likely that the}} Rossons lived on Block 14 in an adobe house. Sanborn maps indicate that the house was probably just south of the new house location.|$|R
50|$|On September 1, 1994, Metroplex Communications sold WERE {{and sister}} station WNCX FM 98.5 (along {{with the rest}} of Metroplex's {{stations}} in Florida and New York) to Clear Channel Communications. WERE continued with the format featuring mostly brokered programs. Here, a radio producer would <b>purchase</b> <b>blocked</b> time from the station, and then produced the program, sold commercial air time, and keep the profit. As a result, the programming was very diverse, but listenership was very sparse, with WERE sometimes not even showing up in the Arbitron ratings.|$|R
50|$|In 1898, John Crichton-Stuart, 3rd Marquess of Bute sold a {{large piece}} of land to Cardiff Council for the {{building}} of a new City Hall, imposing strict conditions regarding what purpose and where development could take place. As a result, the city hall was built as far south in the <b>purchased</b> <b>block</b> of land as was possible, and the residual area to its north used for civic, cultural and educational purposes only. The City Hall, which cost £129,000, was completed in 1905 when Cardiff was awarded city status.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} block trades on the Australian Stock Exchange {{using an}} event study approach. A major finding {{in studies of}} this nature is an immediate reversal for the trade subsequent to the block transaction, for both <b>block</b> <b>purchases</b> and <b>block</b> sales. This reversal is inconsistent with {{the overwhelming majority of}} previous findings which show a stock price continuation following purchases to the close of trading. We confirm the reversals first using transaction prices, and then show that continuations follow both <b>block</b> <b>purchases</b> and sales when quote data is used. We conclude that the transaction price reversal is driven by using quote based rules to classify <b>block</b> transactions into <b>purchases</b> and sales, in conjunction with natural bid-ask bounce. ...|$|R

50|$|Commencing in 1781, the British {{government}} <b>purchased</b> <b>blocks</b> of {{land from}} the Mississauga Nation. In 1818, they purchased land that later became the townships of Esquesing and Nassagaweya. The task of laying out the townships fell to Timothy Street and Abraham Nelles. Charles Kennedy was hired by Nelles to survey {{the northern part of}} Esquesing Township in 1819, and Charles Kennedy received a significant parcel of land as payment for his work. The brothers of Charles Kennedy, John, Morris, Samuel and George, all acquired land close to each another in the Silver Creek Valley. Charles Kennedy built a sawmill in a location where Main Street meets Wildwood Road today.|$|R
5000|$|In recent years, record {{freshman}} {{classes and}} increased interest by upperclass students {{has led to}} higher demand than supply for on-campus residence halls. To meet this demand, UC Housing and Food Services has added residence halls (Morgens Hall in 2013) and <b>purchased</b> <b>block</b> leases at University Park Apartments, Campus Park Apartments (formerly Sterling Manor), University Edge Apartments, and Stetson Square Apartments near campus. This has pushed the [...] "on-campus" [...] housing student population higher and the university announced that Scioto Hall will undergo a renovation and open in fall 2016 in addition to {{plans for a new}} residence hall and dining center where Sawyer Hall once stood.|$|R

40|$|We {{analyze the}} {{permanent}} (information effect) and temporary (liquidity effect) impact of block trades transacted in the National Stock Exchange of India. Block trades are identified using multiple criteria based on trade value and trade volume. Overall, the permanent price impact is more for <b>block</b> <b>purchases</b> than for <b>block</b> sales indicating that <b>block</b> <b>purchases</b> are more informative than block sales, {{which may be}} motivated by liquidity need. Unlike in other markets, we observe that the temporary impact {{is greater than the}} permanent impact in case of <b>block</b> <b>purchase.</b> We classify the block trades as All-or-None (AON) and Not-AON trades depending on the number of transactions through which a block order is executed. As expected, the price impact is higher for Not-AON trades as compared to AON trades (which can be assumed to be pre-negotiated trades). Further, arrival of multiple block trades increases market confidence on the information. The permanent price impact is higher for days where there are more than one block trade of similar nature than for days with only one block trade. To analyze the speed of market response to the information associated with block trades, we have used the ‘transaction time event approach’, as used by Holthausen et al. (1990). We find that the prices start increasing (front running) 8 minutes before <b>block</b> <b>purchases</b> but not in case of block sales i. e. some information about the impending <b>block</b> <b>purchase</b> is factored in by the market when the block trade is for purchases. Further, in the case of block sales, prices revert quickly leaving very small permanent price impact. ...|$|R

50|$|Beginning in 1980, Houston-based insurer American General began <b>purchasing</b> <b>blocks</b> of NLT stock, {{eventually}} becoming NLT's largest shareholder {{and setting}} the stage for an outright takeover.

Unable to acquire television and radio assets due to FCC ownership restrictions of the time, American General influenced NLT to sell WSM-TV to Gillett Broadcasting (operated by George N. Gillett Jr.), which bought the station on November 3, 1981 and changed the station's callsign to WSMV (officially modified to WSMV-TV on July 15, 1982).|$|R

50|$|Another result {{revealed}} in the report was {{that as a result}} of the Act, many local broadcast stations dropped their locally produced educational shows and <b>purchased</b> <b>blocks</b> of pre-produced children's programs from the major networks. This was largely due to the fact that the rules in the Act stated that stations only had to meet the minimum requirement to provide three hours of educational programming content on a weekly basis. Many of the stations thought in terms of profits and eliminated their own shows, which had more educational content than the programs they acquired via syndication, to reduce monetary costs that would be incurred in producing their own educational programs and still meet the minimum requirements to qualify for the renewal of their broadcast licenses.|$|R
