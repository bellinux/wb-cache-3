The station's coal storage area would have stored a minimum 45 days worth of coal supply. All of the station's <b>pulverised</b> fuel ash (PFA) may have been sold to the construction industry, transported to which in dry dust tankers.

5|$|The Southern Railway {{operating}} department undertook trials to improve fleet efficiency. When built, Eastbourne-based No. A629 was fitted with an experimental <b>pulverised</b> fuel burner of German design; {{the experiment was}} terminated when a minor explosion {{was caused by the}} powdered coal coming into contact with sparks thrown from the blastpipe. The experiment also proved that <b>pulverised</b> coal was a false economy, as much of the fine dust was sucked through the chimney without combustion taking place. The locomotive was returned to normal coal burning in 1935. In 1947 the class became a test-bed for a government-backed scheme regarding fuelling arrangements in anticipation of a coal shortage. Two of the class, Nos. 1625 and 1797, were converted to oil burning, with more set to follow suit; but the project was abandoned and the two oil burners were reverted to coal-firing before this could take place.|$|E
5|$|Fly ash {{and bottom}} ash are two {{byproducts}} made through {{the burning of}} coal in power stations. Ash is normally dumped in the station's Ash Lagoons landfill site, which is located on site. Since 2006, ash produced at Lynemouth Power Station has been recycled and used as a sub-fill material {{in the construction industry}} and in the production of grout. In 2007, 63,000 tonnes of ash from the station, along with 100,000 tonnes of ash from the Ash Lagoons, was taken and recycled. In September 2007, <b>Pulverised</b> Fuel Ash was utilised as a filling material in the capping of Woodhorn Landfill, which had been used for the disposal of spent potlining from the smelter.|$|E

5|$|In 1949, the 48MW Kohtla-Järve Power Station– {{the first}} power {{station in the}} world to use <b>pulverised</b> oil shale at an {{industrial}} scale– was commissioned, followed by the 72.5MW Ahtme Power Station in 1951. To ensure sufficient electricity supply in Estonia, Latvia and north-west Russia, the Balti Power Station (1,430MW) and the Eesti Power Station (1,610MW) were built, the former between 1959 and 1971 and the latter between 1969 and 1973. The stations, collectively known as the Narva Power Stations, are the world's two largest oil shale-fired power stations. In 1988 Moscow-based authorities planned a third oil shale-fired power station in Narva with a capacity of 2,500MW, together with a new mine at Kuremäe. The plan, disclosed {{at the time of the}} Phosphorite War and the Singing Revolution, met with strong local opposition and was never implemented.|$|E
5|$|The station's {{boiler house}} houses three 380MWth International Combustion boilers, which are fuelled by <b>pulverised</b> {{bituminous}} coal. Each of these provide steam {{for one of}} three 140 megawatt (MW) Parsons turbo-alternators, situated in the station's turbine hall. These give the station a total generating capacity of 420MW. The electricity generated was fed at 24 kilovolt (kV) to a substation to power the smelter during operation. The substation also has a 132kV connection to the National Grid, where electricity is distributed to homes and other industries by Northern Electric Distribution Limited. The smelter's two pot lines required 310MW of the 420MW that the power station produces, so the excess 110MW which was fed into the national grid. Since the mothballing of the smelter, all exports now go to the grid.|$|E
5|$|Volcanic ash {{particles}} erupted during magmatic eruptions {{are made}} up of various fractions of vitric (glassy, non-crystalline), crystalline or lithic (non-magmatic) particles. Ash produced during low viscosity magmatic eruptions (e.g., Hawaiian and Strombolian basaltic eruptions) produce a range of different pyroclasts dependent on the eruptive process. For example, ash collected from Hawaiian lava fountains consists of sideromelane (light brown basaltic glass) pyroclasts which contain rare microlites (small quench crystals) and phenocrysts. Slightly more viscous eruptions of basalt (e.g., Strombolian) form a variety of pyroclasts from irregular sideromelane droplets to blocky tachylite (black to dark brown microcrystalline pyroclasts). In contrast, most high-silica ash (e.g. rhyolite) consists of <b>pulverised</b> products of pumice (vitric shards), individual phenocrysts (crystal fraction) and some lithic fragments (xenoliths).|$|E

40|$|Summary. The paper {{describes}} {{the structure and}} operation of {{a new type of}} a <b>pulverising</b> aerator and stresses the necessity of developing and implementing aeration techniques to improve water quality of inland reservoirs. Mathematical modelling of hypolimnetic water inflow to the aerator intake chamber is presented, as well as the model being used to select the aerator’s operation pa-rameters and to determine the aerator conical turbine energy demand for <b>pulverising</b> aeration of hypoxic and anoxic water masses present in the near-bottom zone of numerous temperate water reservoirs...|$|R
5|$|The A Station {{generated}} electricity {{using three}} turbo alternators; two 69 megawatt (MW) Metropolitan-Vickers British Thomson-Houston sets, and one 105MW Metropolitan-Vickers set, totalling 243MW. At {{the time of}} its commissioning, the 105MW generating set was the largest in Europe. The B Station also had three turbo alternators, all made by Metropolitan-Vickers. This consisted of two units which used 16MW high-pressure units exhausting to a 78MW and associated with a 6MW house alternator, giving these units a total rating of 100MW. The third unit consisted of a 66MW machine associated with a 6MW house alternator, giving the unit a rating of 72MW. Combined, these gave the B station a generating capacity of 260MW, making the site's generating capacity 503MW. All of the station's boilers were made by Babcock & Wilcox, fuelled by <b>pulverised</b> coal from pulverisers also built by Babcock & Wilcox. There were nine boilers in the A station and six in the B station. The B station's boilers were the largest ever built in the UK at that time. The B station also had the highest thermal efficiency of any power station in the country for the first twelve years of its operation.|$|E
25|$|Huge {{quantity}} of imported coal {{is being used}} in <b>pulverised</b> coal-fired power stations. Raw biomass {{can not be used}} in the <b>pulverised</b> coal mills as they are difficult to grind into fine powder due to caking property of raw biomass. However biomass can be used after Torrefaction in the <b>pulverised</b> coal mills for replacing imported coal. North west and southern regions can replace imported coal use with torrefied biomass where surplus agriculture/crop residual biomass is available. Biomass power plants can also get extra income by selling the Renewable Purchase Certificates (RPC).|$|E
