25|$|Nylon mania came to {{an abrupt}} stop at the end of 1941 when the USA entered World War II. The {{production}} capacity that had been built up to produce nylon stockings, or just nylons, for American women was taken over to manufacture vast numbers of <b>parachutes</b> <b>for</b> fliers and paratroopers. After the war ended, DuPont went back to selling nylon to the public, engaging in another promotional campaign in 1946 that resulted in an even bigger craze, triggering the so-called nylon riots.|$|E
25|$|The board {{found that}} the crew and {{passengers}} had not jumped immediately from the aircraft owing to several factors, including a loss of altitude while attempting to find an emergency field, the rapidly spreading fire, which blocked or impeded egress from the plane, {{and the fact that}} a sufficient number of parachutes were either not on board or were not being worn. Almost immediately following the crash, Prime Minister Churchill issued a directive requiring any test flights with civilians or scientific personnel to carry a sufficient number of <b>parachutes</b> <b>for</b> all individuals involved.|$|E

25|$|The Paresev {{completed}} nearly 350 flights {{during a}} research program that ran from 1962 until 1964. Using the fully flexible parawing or the tube-stiffened paraglider of the Paresev 1A, 1B, 1C as an alternate to spacecraft recovery was deemed too unreliable upon unfolding so round <b>parachutes</b> <b>for</b> water landings were used instead. The Paresev and other flexible-wing {{projects such as}} the Ryan XV-8 stopped being funded by NASA on 1965. Although Rogallo wrote about, modeled, and spoke about recreational applications including hang gliding, NASA {{was not in the}} business of applying Rogallo's family of airfoils to personal aircraft such as kites, hang gliders, and powered light aircraft.|$|E
25|$|SRE-1 is a 555kg capsule. It {{comprises}} aero-thermo structure, internal structure, Mission Management Unit, Altitude {{sensors and}} Inertial measurement unit, S-band transponder with unique belt array antenna embedded to ATS, power and electronics packages to support deceleration and flotation system. It also houses two microgravity payloads. It has a sphere-cone-flare configuration with a spherical nose of about 0.5 m radius, base diameter of 2 m and 1.6 m height. The parachute, pyro devices, avionics packages of triggering unit and sequencer, telemetry and tracking system and sensors for measurement of system performance parameters are placed inside the SRE-1 capsule. <b>Parachutes</b> <b>for</b> SRE capsule {{were provided by}} ADRDE.|$|E
25|$|A typical annual {{training}} programme for 12 Squadron consisted of individual {{training in the}} autumn, working up to Squadron training in the summer consisting of bombing, formation flying, navigation exercises and gunnery. Experimental trials carried out included some limited night flying and the introduction into service and testing of <b>parachutes</b> <b>for</b> aircrew. This involved a number of practice jumps being performed by observers, who would {{climb out of the}} aircraft onto a small ladder and await a signal from the pilot as the aircraft flew over the airfield at 2000ft. The observers carried no reserve parachutes, and the silk material from which the parachutes were constructed had a tendency to build up a static charge whilst in storage, such that when the ripcord was pulled, the silk stuck together. 12 Squadron was also tasked with further trials work, experimenting with oxygen systems, high altitude photography, and low temperature trials work, particularly in respect to lubricants. In addition, cloud flying in formation and pattern bombing techniques were tested.|$|E

25|$|At {{the same}} time, however, the insurgents were {{equipped}} with Soviet-made weaponry, including 37-mm antiaircraft guns, which {{were to take}} a toll of the U.S. and French aircraft trying to attack their forces, including with napalm, {{in an effort to}} repel them and thus relieve the besieged garrison, which eventually capitulated to Giap's troops on May 7, 1954. In total, the French lost sixty-two aircraft destroyed or severely damaged in the last major battle fought in French Indochina, which, as a colony, was consigned to history with the signing of an agreement in Geneva in July to carve up Vietnam into two countries along the 17th parallel. France, though, was permitted to maintain a small military presence in the new Republic of Vietnam, known to the West as South Vietnam, and the Americans still present were also permitted to remain, servicing the Armée de l’Air’s contingent of B-26s and C-47s, plus the C-119s. They even packed <b>parachutes</b> <b>for</b> French airborne troops. The Americans left Vietnam eventually on September 6, 1954, albeit five days after the original leaving date promised by the French. Other Armée de l’Air units were meanwhile dedicating itself to the training of Vietnamese Air Force (VNAF) technical and flight personnel at Nha-Trang.|$|E
500|$|In 1926, Williams {{mandated}} {{the use of}} <b>parachutes</b> <b>for</b> all RAAF aircrew. He {{had visited}} the Irvin Air Chute Company while in the US during 1924 and recommended purchase at the time, but a backlog of orders for the RAF meant that the Australian equipment took almost two years to arrive. Flying Officer Ellis Wackett was assigned to instruct volunteers at RAAF Richmond, and made the country's first freefall descent from a military aircraft, an Airco DH.9, on 26May. Williams himself jumped over Point Cook on 5August, having decided that it would set [...] "a good example if, before issuing an order for the compulsory wearing of parachutes, I showed my own confidence in them..." [...] Though his descent took him perilously close to the base water tank ("I {{thought it would be}} a poor ending to drown there, or even to be pulled out dripping wet") and [...] "too close to be comfortable to a 30,000 volt electric transmission line", he completed the exercise unscathed.|$|E
500|$|... {{and wooden}} boxes rotted or were eaten by insects. <b>Parachutes</b> <b>for</b> air {{dropping}} were in short supply. [...] Orders for parachutes {{were placed in}} Australia, the United States and India. A request for 5,000 cargo parachutes with containers was made to Washington on 21 July. On 22 September {{it was decided to}} send 1,000 without containers by air, while the rest went by sea. Due to the shortage of parachutes, most supplies had to be [...] "free-dropped"—dropped without parachutes—so the rate of breakage was high. As the contents of the packaging usually burst, they were encased in two or more sacks, the outer being much larger than the inner, so it could contain the contents when the inner burst, and prevent them from scattering. Three layers was found necessary. Items such as sacks and blankets were preferred as packaging, as these were useful to the troops. About 12,000 blankets were used in the five weeks up to 12 October. The earlier adoption of blankets as packaging would not only have saved supplies from breakage, but would have also increased the volume of supplies delivered over the track, as thousands of blankets were sent by carrier. Without a well-organised recovery effort, less that 50 percent of what was dropped was recovered, and perhaps 70 per cent of what was recovered was found to be in a usable condition.|$|E

2500|$|By 1957, PARU {{consisted}} of two light infantry companies, {{as well as a}} pathfinder company personally commanded by Lair. Although dubbed [...] "police", the extensively cross-trained PARU agents were trained to special forces standards. In September 1957, the PARU narrowly escaped disbandment when General Phao was forced into exile by the head of the Royal Thai Army, General Sarit. In early 1958, they were renamed with the PARU designation. They began to shift their training base from Hua Hin to Phitsanulok, which was closer to their area of operations. In 1958, they became involved in the CIA's international operations. They rigged <b>parachutes</b> <b>for</b> dropping weapons to insurgents in Indonesia. They packed pallets of weaponry for shipment from Takhli to the anti-Chinese Communist resistance in Tibet.|$|E
50|$|In {{the late}} 1950s and early 1960s, U.S. {{aerospace}} manufacturers worked on <b>parachute</b> designs <b>for</b> space capsule recovery.

2500|$|In 1947, Scottish {{housewife}} Valerie Hunter Gordon started {{developing and}} making Paddi, a 2-part system {{consisting of a}} disposable pad (made of cellulose wadding covered with cotton wool) worn inside an adjustable plastic garment with press-studs/snaps. Initially, she used old <b>parachutes</b> <b>for</b> the garment. She applied for the patent in April 1948, and it was granted for the UK in October 1949. [...] Initially, the big manufacturers were unable to see the commercial possibilities of disposable nappies. In 1948, Gordon made over 400 Paddis herself using her sewing machine at the kitchen table. Her husband had unsuccessfully approached several companies for help until {{he had a chance}} meeting with Sir Robert Robinson at a business dinner. In November 1949 Valerie Gordon signed a contract with Robinsons of Chesterfield who then went into full production. In 1950, Boots UK agreed to sell Paddi in all their branches. In 1951 the Paddi patent was granted for the USA and worldwide. Shortly after that, Playtex and several other large international companies tried unsuccessfully to buy out Paddi from Robinsons. Paddi was very successful for many years until the advent of 'all in one' diapers.|$|E
