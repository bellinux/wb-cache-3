From different fields of knowledge (evolutionary philosophy, anthropology and economics) Herbert Spencer (1860 / 1904), Edward Tylor (1881 / 1973) and Thorstein Veblen (1899 / 2005) agreed to question the primacy of sports over traditional practices, rituals and folk. These authors, without reaching the ends of the luddites respect of industrial machines, extolled the unfavorable aspects of physical exercises, <b>planting</b> <b>a</b> <b>seed</b> <b>of</b> doubt that continues to this day. The importance of knowing these arguments lies in the way they faced the sporting phenomenon when it began to be institutionalized in a new set of corporal, transformative exercises and apparently a generator of fitness and healt...|$|E

40|$|The EM {{field pattern}} created by spectators in {{relativistic}} heavy-ion collisions <b>plants</b> <b>a</b> <b>seed</b> <b>of</b> positive (negative) magnetic helicity {{in the hemisphere}} above (below) the reaction plane. Owing to the chiral anomaly, the magnetic helicity interacts with the fermionic helicity of the collision system, and causes photons emitted in upper- and lower-hemispheres to have different preferences in the circular polarization. In this paper, we lay down a procedure to measure the variation of the circular polarization w. r. t the reaction plane in relativistic heavy-ion collisions for massless photons, as well as similar polarization patterns for vector mesons decaying into two daughters.

40|$|Renal cell {{carcinoma}} (RCC) {{is a common}} form of urologic tumor that originates from the highly heterogeneous epithelium of renal tubules. Over the last decade, targeting therapies to renal cancer cells have transformed clinical care for RCC. Recently, it was proposed that renal cancer stem cells (CSCs) isolated from renal carcinomas were responsible for driving tumor growth and resistance to conventional chemotherapy and radiotherapy, according {{to the theory of}} CSCs; this has provided the rationale for therapies targeting this aggressive cell population. Precise identification of renal CSC populations and the complete cell hierarchy will accurately inform characterization of disease subtypes. This will ultimately contribute to more personalized and targeted therapies. Here, we summarize potential targeting strategies for renal cancer cells and renal CSCs, including tyrosine kinase inhibitors, mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors (mTOR), interleukins, CSC marker inhibitors, bone morphogenetic protein- 2, antibody drug conjugates, and nanomedicine. In conclusion, targeting therapies for RCC represent new directions for exploration and clinical investigation and they <b>plant</b> <b>a</b> <b>seed</b> <b>of</b> hope for advanced clinical care...|$|R

From clients to contractors, politics to energy concerns, material usage to money management, architects of the world have the amazing task of delivering a product that influences the physical and mental environments of its users.

Whereas in local contemporary developments like Fallbrook, (a residential development on the northwest side of Lincoln) the single family house is a projection of a sentimental urban dream predicted to fail because the conditions it is based upon no longer exist. Even in more progressive communities houses are reminiscent of the owner’s imagery of a house. The investigation here is to explore the house as the nucleus for change, where the perception of a house can be challenged. If we as architects accept peoples need to live their suburban dream, then the investigation will be to combine tools of ecological efficiency and space, rather than form-making to produce a kind of “contagiousness”, which could effect not the growth but the impact of our growing cities...|$|R
50|$|Archeologists have {{conducted}} an exhaustive study of Hut 1 at Ohalo II; this hut yielded over 90,000 seeds. The seeds {{account for more}} than 100 species of wild barley and fruits. Such <b>a</b> high concentration <b>of</b> <b>seeds</b> in the hut makes it highly unlikely that they were accidentally deposited into the hut via natural forces such as wind. In addition, statistical analysis demonstrates that the concentration of plant matter was significantly higher around the walls than the center. Had the seeds been deposited by the collapsed roof, they would have evenly scattered on the ground. Furthermore, just 13 species of fruit and cereal make up about half of the total number <b>of</b> <b>seeds</b> found in the area; these include brome grains (Bromus pseudobrachystachys), wild barley (Hordeum spontaneum) and millet grass grains (Piptatherum holciforme), just to name a few. This suggests a marked preference of certain species <b>of</b> edible <b>plants.</b> <b>A</b> <b>seed</b> <b>of</b> particular interest comes from the Rubus fruit, which was fragile, difficult to transport, and preferably eaten immediately after collection. The presence <b>of</b> Rubus <b>seeds</b> at the Ohalo II site could indicate that the seeds were dried in the sun or by the fire for storage: early evidence for advanced planning of plant food consumption. Most importantly, the extremely high concentration <b>of</b> <b>seeds</b> clustering around the grinding stone in the northern wall of Hut 1 led archeologist Ehud Weiss to believe that humans at Ohalo II processed the grain before consumption.|$|R

40|$|In {{the heart}} of the more objectivistic line of Rationalism, Leibniz <b>planted</b> <b>an</b> ontological <b>seed</b> <b>of</b> vital spontaneity that would bear fruit three centuries later in the {{reflective}} conversion of Husserlian phenomenology into the one subjective/objective field of research of the Erlebnisse and of the Sachen selbst. Anna-Teresa Tymieniecka carries out and gives structure to these ideas of philosophical solidarity between spirit and life, both pursuing the subjective road in empathizing with the profound intentionality of her masters, Leibniz and Ingarden in primis, and applying herself to the objective level to give rise to a phenomenology of phenomenology, through which she intends to realize an intuitive re-seeding of phenomenology itself. The surprising result of this phenomenological work has been the discover of the ontopoietic logos of life, which runs through and pervades every sphere of being, from the physical to the metaphysical level, with its expansive and evolutive dynamic of impetus and equipoise. Thus Tymieniecka threw open the ancient Parmenidean concept of being as a “mass of well rounded sphere” to the spectacle of being that gushes and runs in history, as if surging from an inexhaustible spring...|$|R

40|$|Age {{and lack}} of time was a {{constant}} problem for my family and a personal concern for myself growing up, maybe because I am {{the only person in}} my family under the age of 55. Lack of energy became neglect for my family’s 142 -year-old farm and 40 -year-old tire business. Growing up, I became all too familiar with visions of decay in what once had been a thriving place of growth and order. My aging family’s lack of energy was a main ingredient in the state of decay but economic flux and failure {{to keep up with the}} times were also to blame. Witnessing this decline <b>planted</b> <b>a</b> <b>seed</b> <b>of</b> desire to see progress and a way out from the current state of things. “Ad-hocism” and off-the-cuff construction using materials that were readily at hand to solve utilitarian problems became a wellspring of inspiration and creative opportunity for me. Growing up, fences, roofs, mailbox stands, gate latches, and feed troughs name but a few of the things made from old tires I found; from tarps made from inter-tubes to chairs made of steel wheels, the list could go on. As an artist, I continue the essence of my family’s ingenuity combined with my physical and mental need to improve and build. In some of my recent sculptures, I make use of tire parts linked and woven into forms that simultaneously seem to be on the verge of falling apart while having a noticeable structural integrity. I hope to portray to the viewer a foretaste of the atmosphere from which the resources came and a sense that a new possibility for the materials is being found. The idea of struggle and acceptance of limitations and failures in the construction process can be seen in my work and serve as important references to the reality of what is possible as I quest for new possibilities. These intentions spill over into my ceramic work with the tower-like forms built from loops of clay, mimicking the shape of tires. Juxtaposing play, structure, and defiance against forces that overwhelmingly oppose their creation is a goal of mine. I strive to create works that have an open ending or a kind of ambiguous existence, leaving the viewer free to impose their own narrative on the forms. As guiding rails to that narrative, I implant elements of hope, somberness, playfulness, and urgency. An influence on this approach is historic Cabinets of Curiosity that speak on the nature of wonder and humanities desire to both understand and not know. Indeed wonder is very often found in the things we feel a kind of connection to without having an understanding. Alwyn O’Brien‘s ceramic work has also been an influence of mine in terms of its playfulness, fragility and urgency. Sterling Ruby and Leonardo Drew are also large influences on my work due to the raw and unkempt aesthetic of their sculptures along with conceptual themes of masculinity and its fragility.

By empowering these youth with skills, confidence, inspiration, responsibility, hope, service, and courage, this program provides a path to a productive life. By challenging and rewarding them, the fulfilling nature of this work can <b>plant</b> <b>a</b> <b>seed</b> <b>of</b> purpose in their lives. Unhealthy and healthy habits formed in the adolescent stage of life, such as physical activity and nutritional practices, have been found to travel into adulthood (Craigie et al., 2011), which makes this stage of life critical to instill positive behaviors and form skills that turn into permanent healthy lifestyles. ^ This practice-based culminating experience will use qualitative methodology to explore the long-term effects of the Urban Roots Farm Intern program on life and job skills, lifestyles, and diet. The information will be important to understand the long term influences of the program as young people start to pursue lives, further their education, and become adults. I partnered with Urban Roots to collect data for this study through one-on-one phone interviews. Youth were contacted 2 - 5 years after they completed the internship with the aim of improving program delivery and providing substantial evidence of the outcomes and impacts the program has on the youth after they complete the program. ^ When asked about their experiences during the Urban Roots farm internship, interviewees thoughtfully reflected on their time spent on the farm, in workshops, battling cold and hot weather, developing skills, making friends, learning how {{what it means to be}} of service to the community, and working hard all summer. For the majority of the participants, this was their first job- the professional experience to which the rest will be compared. If they say you will always remember your first love, you will definitely always remember your first job. The most valuable aspects of the program were: opportunities to try new and different things, life-changing personal growth, and connections to people, places, and things. Overall, they all seemed to have fun, enjoy themselves, and learn more than they expected. ^ Urban Roots as a youth development program is no doubt having a significant impact on the lives of 14 - 17 year olds that complete the farm internship. Their program embodies the most dire and vital aspects of youth development programs. Youth are treated with respect, kindness, caring, and held accountable for their actions. The interviews were overwhelmingly positive and experiences were reflected upon with joy and appreciation. The meaningful opportunity that Urban Root provides for youth through workshops, curriculum, and hands-on activities will continue to be worthwhile. The fact that youth were overwhelmed with excitement at the thought of all high school students participating in the program shows that through their sweat, time, and hard-work, they believe in this program and its potential. ...|$|R
5000|$|You have to <b>plant</b> <b>a</b> lot <b>of</b> <b>seeds</b> in {{the spring}} and the summer so you can {{capitalize}} on it. If you have a story that's going to hit in the middle of September, middle of October, what {{you really want to do}} is build several things that come off of the story so that it's not just a one-day hit. If the story runs on the front page of a major paper, you also want to set it up so that it hits some of the television morning shows, and from there you want to have surrogates out the next day, so that you get a second hit. On the third day, ideally, you have some additional information you've been holding back that you can feed into it, another round of stories. On the fourth or fifth day you try to hold your candidate back from saying anything, so that eventually, when he does say something about the issue, you get another round of stories. If you do it all effectively, you can basically wipe out a guy's entire week. He'll spend the entire week responding to a story that showed up on a Monday.:— Chris Lehane, quoted in Atlantic Monthly, June 2004 ...|$|R
40|$|The {{application}} of phytoremediation for purification of an anaerobically treated dairy manure {{and production of}} forage crops was investigated. Four crops (two cereals and two grasses) were examined {{for their ability to}} grow hydroponically and to remove pollutants (nutrients) from dairy wastewater. The preliminary experiments showed that timothygrass and orchardgrass did not perform well as aquatic plants. Only 24 and 29 % <b>of</b> the <b>seeds</b> germinated after 19 - 21 days giving a crop yield of 21 and 19 t ha &# 713; 1 for timotygrass and orchardgrass, respectively. Wheat and barley grow very well as aquatic <b>plants</b> with <b>a</b> <b>seed</b> germination <b>of</b> 83 and 73 (in 7 days) and a crop yield of 106 and 86 t ha &# 713; 1 for wheat and barley, respectively. The effect <b>of</b> light duration, <b>seeding</b> rate, wastewater application rate and fungicidal treatment on the wheat crop yield and pollution potential reduction were studied. The results indicated that with this system, a wheat forage crop could be produced in 21 days from germination to harvest. A treatment combination of wastewater application rate of 900 mL day &# 713; 1, <b>a</b> <b>seeding</b> rate <b>of</b> 400 g and a light duration of 12 hrs gave the best results for crop yield (3. 81 kg of wheat tray &# 713; 1). Based on thirteen harvests per year, a total possible yield of 3300 t ha &# 713; 1 per year can be achieved with the system. This is more than 102 times grater than the yield obtainable from a filed grown conventional forage of 245 t ha &# 713; 1 per year. Wheat had a superior nutritional value (higher digestible energy, higher carbohydrates, fat, protein and mineral contents and less crude fiber) compared to the other field forage crops. It also contained higher macro and micro nutrients (Sodium, Magnesium, Manganese, Iron, Copper, Boron, Selenium, Iodine and Cobalt) than field forage crops. Removal efficiencies of 72. 4, 88. 6 and 60. 8 % can be achieved for the total solids, Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) and ammonium nitrogen, respectively. A nitrate nitrogen concentration of 7. 1 mg L &# 713; 1 was also found in the effluent from the hydroponic system. This is below the Canadian Environmental and Health Guidelines of 10 mg L &# 713; 1...|$|R
