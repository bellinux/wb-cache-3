500|$|There {{are several}} {{variations}} to this case-control approach. [...] A common alternative to case-control GWA studies is {{the analysis of}} quantitative phenotypic data, e.g. height or biomarker concentrations or even gene expression. Likewise, alternative statistics designed for dominance or recessive penetrance patterns can be used. Calculations are typically done using bioinformatics software such as SNPTEST and <b>PLINK,</b> which also include support {{for many of these}} alternative statistics. Earlier GWAS focused on the effect of individual SNPs. However, the empirical evidence shows that complex interactions among two or more SNPs, epistasis, might contribute to complex diseases. Moreover, the researchers tries to integrate GWA data with other biological data such as protein protein interaction network [...] to extract more informative results.|$|E
500|$|The {{songs on}} The High End of Low {{appear on the}} album in {{the order in which}} they were written. The album {{contains}} material which spans across a wide variety of genres, such as industrial metal, glam rock, garage rock, blues, country, and synthpop. Its first track, [...] "Devour", is a mid-tempo rock song which begins with an acoustic guitar, with heavy drums and distorted, screamed vocals becoming more prominent as it progresses. It was written in response to the [...] "Shakespearean ideal of romance" [...] presented on Eat Me, Drink Me. Lana Cooper of PopMatters said the song [...] "runs an emotional gauntlet", and could [...] "very well be the most depressing break-up song of all time. The lonely <b>plink</b> of guitar strings being tuned give way to Manson's soul-wrenching eruption of [...] "And I'll love you / If you'll let me". [...] he turns on a dime, and a few lines later is vowing revenge, spitting [...] "I will blow your heart to pieces." [...] Metal Hammer later included it on their list of the 10 most underrated Marilyn Manson songs.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Plinking</b> {{refers to}} {{informal}} target shooting done for pleasure typically at non-standard targets such as tin cans, logs, soda bottles, {{or any other}} homemade or naturally occurring target.

5000|$|In {{contrast}} to shooting done at established target ranges, <b>plinking</b> is generally done at home, in a gravel pit, open field, or other private land for no fee.

50|$|The targets {{themselves}} {{that are used}} {{are one of the}} main reasons why <b>plinking</b> is popular among gun enthusiasts, especially hunters. A three dimensional target in an outdoors setting is much more akin to a real world hunting scenario, allowing a hunter the opportunity for practice. Since any reasonably sized object, from a soda can or a charcoal briquet to an arbitrary spot on a tree can be used as a target, a three dimensional <b>plinking</b> range can easily be set up that will simulate situations commonly found while hunting small game, such as when the animal is behind cover, or up in a tree. A <b>plinking</b> target will also often react much more positively to a hit than a paper target will, either with an audible impact, or visually confirmable by moving, splattering or falling over. Steel targets, which are used for formal action and long range shooting competitions, are also popular among plinksters due to their relative ease to set up, as well as being easy to confirm good hits.|$|R

5000|$|The {{most common}} calibre used for <b>plinking</b> is the [...]22 Long Rifle rimfire cartridge, since these rounds are {{relatively}} inexpensive {{and have a}} low recoil. Airguns and airsoft guns are also used, often for cost or safety reasons or because {{they are subject to}} less stringent regulation - a similar practice with a bow and arrow is usually termed [...] "stump shooting".|$|R
5000|$|Today, [...]22 LR (Long Rifle) {{accounts}} {{for the vast majority}} of all rimfire ammunition used. Standard [...]22 LR rounds use an essentially pure lead bullet plated with a typical 95% copper, 5% zinc combination. These are offered in supersonic and subsonic types, as well as target, <b>plinking,</b> and hunting versions. These cartridges are usually coated with a hard wax for fouling control.|$|R
5000|$|Typically BBs {{are used}} for indoor practice, casual outdoor <b>plinking,</b> {{training}} children, or for air gun enthusiasts who like to practice, but cannot afford high-powered air gun systems that use pellets.
