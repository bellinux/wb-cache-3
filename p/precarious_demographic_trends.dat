India has used the labor cost advantage to gain reasonable market share in these activities. It however faces serious internal and external challenges in sustaining its international competitiveness, {{particularly with respect to}} labor cost.

40|$|<b>Demographic</b> <b>trends</b> {{underlie}} a {{great many}} economic and social processes. However, because populations tend to change relatively slowly, demography is often taken for granted and its impact under-appreciated. Rather like some slow geological process that is imperceptible in the short run, demographic change often has an ineluctable force, and ends up changing the whole social and economic landscape. When {{trying to understand the}} relationship between the European Union and its neighbours to the South and East of the Mediterranean, an understanding of the demographic forces at work is essential. In this chapter I will present an outline of the main <b>demographic</b> <b>trends</b> in Europe and the Mediterranean over the last half century, and will look forward to sketch the most likely developments for the coming decades. The EU and its neighbours do not only share the Mediterranean, we also share a common future and <b>demographic</b> <b>trends</b> will {{play a crucial role in}} determining the nature of that future...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{describes}} the basic demographic processes on the Kvarner {{islands in the}} last twenty years. The census data from this period show a constant population growth on the Kvarner islands and promote them {{into one of the}} most vital sub-regions of the Primorje-Gorski Kotar County. The results of the analysis show that the mechanical component of the total population change, i. e. immigration, which managed to overcome the negative natural <b>demographic</b> <b>trend,</b> was the cause of this positive <b>demographic</b> <b>trend.</b> As a result, natural population change on the Kvarner islands 1991 - 2011 belongs to the "regeneration by immigration" type. However, since increased immigration did not influence the reduction of the negative natural <b>demographic</b> <b>trend,</b> it is safe to presume that "fictive" residents dominate the immigration contingent. This hypothesis is supported by the comparison of the census change index 2011 / 2001 and the type of demographic resources index in 2001...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{contributes to}} the field of land use planning by examining the effects of <b>demographic</b> <b>trends</b> [...] also known as demographic futures [...] on growth and development projections for seven communities in the Mojave Desert region of San Bernardino County, California. <b>Demographic</b> <b>trends</b> based on California Department of Finance projections and land development data supplied by the Southern California Association of Governments were obtained for each of the communities for the period between 1990 and 2001. By using a spatially explicit urban growth model, these trends and data were then used to allocate community-specific future growth for Adelanto, Apple Valley, Barstow, Hesperia, Twentynine Palms, Victorville, and Yucca Valley. The research compared three projected settlement densities for each community. These three densities were based on settlement trends between 1990 and 2001, on existing densities as of 2001, and on densities that had been derived from prior research in the Mojave Desert region as a whole. The overall effect of using <b>demographic</b> <b>trends</b> to estimate settlement densities results in less development of open space and undeveloped lands than under existing densities or densities derived from prior research. Indeed, using demographic trend-derived densities in place of existing densities resulted in nearly 3, 900 more acres of vacant land in the seven communities remaining undeveloped by the year 2020. Similarly, using demographic trend-derived densities in place of densities developed by prior research resulted in nearly 22, 000 more acres of vacant land in the seven communities remaining undeveloped by the year 2020. Differences in projected land use patterns based on <b>demographic</b> <b>trends</b> are a key point for land use planners to consider when determining future development in each of the communities. Accounting for these <b>demographic</b> <b>trends</b> provides a way of 2 ̆ 2 fine tuning 2 ̆ 2 projections to ensure that they are more representative of the needs and expectations of future populations...|$|R

40|$|In {{line with}} global trends, the Croatian {{military}} is currently {{going through a}} transformation, but is being stifled by a long recession and negative <b>demographic</b> <b>trends.</b> The {{purpose of this article}} is to outline the possibilities of applying system dynamics models in testing the sustainability of the Croatian military forces (CMF) with respect to their size and composition. The article mainly focuses on the <b>demographic</b> <b>trends</b> and their implications on the CMF. After a brief exposition of the research done in this field to date, the article presents two developed models – a demographic model and a military recruitment model. The models were carefully tested using validation tests suitable for system dynamics modelling. Subsequent to validation, the models were merged into a single integral system dynamics model of the CMF. Three experiments were conducted based on different fertility values, and the impact of <b>demographic</b> <b>trends,</b> which emerge from the different fertility levels. The results of the simulation, based on demographic data from the 2011 Census, as well as estimated data, though not accessible at the time, suggest that the Croatian military will encounter difficulties in meeting its demands for recruits in the next 20 - 30 years. Further implications of current <b>demographic</b> <b>trends</b> on the CMF’s sustainability are discussed towards the end of the paper.
