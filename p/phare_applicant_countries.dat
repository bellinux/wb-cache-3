40|$|Direct aid {{payments}} to new EU member states {{are to be}} phased in over a ten year period, starting in 2004 from an initial base of 25 % of the level currently applied to existing EU members. By 2013 new <b>applicant</b> <b>countries</b> will receive the full amount then being applied in existing EU member states. During this period emphasis will be placed on rural development programmes in the <b>applicant</b> <b>countries</b> for dynamic restructuring of existing farming enterprises. This will include special rural development measures intended to assist semi-subsistence farmers to restructure. Initially this will consist of a flat rate Euro 750 payment, which would be conditional upon the submission of a business plan demonstrating the future economic viability of the enterprise. It is felt that this will avoid locking in uncompetitive forms of production and will allow for the dynamic restructuring of existing farm enterprises along more commercial lines. Rural development measures in new <b>applicant</b> <b>countries</b> will also provide assistance with meeting EU food safety and food quality standards. In addition it is envisaged that assistance to improve processing and marketing of agricultural products in <b>applicant</b> <b>countries</b> will also be forthcoming from the Structural Fund. Comment: The movement away from price support to direct aid programmes has greatly facilitated {{the management of the}} integration of new <b>applicant</b> <b>countries</b> into the common agricultural policy. It is envisaged that this staggered integration of new countries into the CAP will avoid locking in existing inefficient production structures and avoid the stimulation of high levels of additional new production. The programmes currently being put in place for <b>applicant</b> <b>countries</b> are designed to encourage small scale and subsistence farmers towards more commercial forms of production. This could hold important lessons for ACP countries. As in the EU, support for promoting more competitive export orientated forms of agro-processing activities is also being financed from Structural Funds, which are not subject to such close scrutiny under the WTO provisions on agricultural support.

40|$|The {{economic}} {{implications of}} liberalization of integration flows {{during the past}} ten years, and the prospects for the coming ten years are investigated. The conclusion is that only goods and capital flows have been liberalized, while labour flows are blocked and likely to stay blocked. This pattern of liberalization is unfavourable for the <b>applicant</b> <b>countries.</b> Several dimensions of asymmetries have been identified: between different integration flows; between timing of costs and benefits for EU members and for applicants: between timing of net effects; between timing of liberalization and access to EU funds; between treatment of the <b>applicant</b> <b>countries</b> for the Southern and the Eastern enlargement, etc. The EU countries first reap the benefits and only later incur costs. The opposite {{is true for the}} <b>applicant</b> <b>countries.</b> A major finding is that the overall net effects for the candidate countries are negative in the short- and medium term, and may evolve into positive effects only in the long term. For Bulgaria this period is 12 - 14 years. The overall net effects for the EU members are positive throughout. In order to assure the accession of well-prepared countries only, EU members and the <b>applicant</b> <b>countries</b> must identify an appropriate mix among the three key variables: deadlines for accession, pre-accession transfers and transitional arrangements. Under the presently expected deadlines for accession and meager pre-accession transfers most of the candidate countries will be ill- prepared to join during the coming 5 - 10 years. The accession preparation costs are unbearable for Bulgaria and other <b>applicant</b> <b>countries</b> if they are to comply with EU standards within 10 years. The decisions for accession must be taken only on the basis of solid economic fundamentals, supplemented by political considerations, and not vice-versa {{as was the case with}} the invitations for negotiation. Important recommendations are made to the Bulgarian government, the governments of other CEECs, to the European Commission and the governments of the EU members. The author substantiates a major conclusion, that Bulgaria and the other CEECs have no viable alternative to accession in the European Union. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{legal systems}} of the European Union (EU) and the United States (U. S.) are premised upon common norms, {{resulting}} in very similar bodies of jurisprudence. Due to these shared legal principles, one would expect the EU and the U. S. to use similar standards in the adjudication of asylum claims. For the most part, this expectation holds true. However, a glaring difference exists when an <b>applicant’s</b> <b>country</b> of origin is an EU member state. Asylum adjudicators in the U. S. examine the individual merits of a claim, regardless of the <b>applicant’s</b> <b>country</b> of origin. On the other hand, EU adjudicators are required to presume that asylum claims filed by EU nationals are without merit. This presumption comes primarily from the Protocol on Asylum for Nationals o...|$|R
40|$|Accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO) {{is unlike}} {{accession}} to other global organizations. It is extremely demanding on <b>applicant</b> <b>countries,</b> time consuming and essentially power- rather than rule-based. This article argues that existing WTO members select {{themselves into the}} Working Party of <b>applicant</b> <b>countries,</b> the body which determines the timing and conditions of accession, {{in order to have}} the option to strategically delay membership by the applicant and/or extract concessions from it. Existing members will select themselves into a specific Working Party if their own trade interests are strongly affected, which will be the case if the existing member's bilateral trade with the <b>applicant</b> <b>country</b> forms a large share of its income, unless both countries already have a preferential trade agreement (PTA) between them. Trade interests are also strongly affected if the existing member competes with the applicant in terms of export product and market structure. Conversely, where both member and applicant have more PTAs with third countries of large economic size in common, potential accession will affect the member's trade interests less. An empirical analysis of Working Party membership since 1968 estimates to what extent these three different facets of trade interests are substantively important determinants of Working Party composition...|$|R

40|$|Much of {{our recent}} {{scholarship}} argues that public support in member countries {{is integral to}} the success of European Union (EU) policies and initiatives. Despite growing evidence that public support is also often crucial to attaining (and sustaining) EU membership—as evidenc-ed by the volatile Maastricht referenda in Denmark and France and the unsuccessful Norwegian accession—there is little systematic research on accession countries. This study develops an analytic framework for understanding EU public opinion in <b>applicant</b> <b>countries</b> undergoing democratic transitions. Using data from a 1996 survey, the analysis tests both utilitarian and value models of support and finds general attitudes toward democracy and capitalism and an individual’s political partisanship to be the strongest determinants of support for EU member-ship. The results challenge dominant explanations for public opinion in member states and sug-gest how we might better adapt these models to examine attitudes in <b>applicant</b> <b>countries...</b>|$|R
