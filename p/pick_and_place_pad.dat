30|$|As {{mentioned}} above, at {{the beginning}} of 2000 s, Single Head architectural technology was adapted for use in the <b>Pick</b> <b>and</b> <b>Place</b> machine. Single Head is the general acceptance of particular product architecture and is characteristic of technical evolution in a <b>Pick</b> <b>and</b> <b>Place</b> machines. Single Head architectural technology actually dominated the <b>Pick</b> <b>and</b> <b>Place</b> machine market. A dominant design often emerges in response to the opportunity to obtain economies of scale or to take advantage of externalities (Arthur, 1988). The K as a front runner of OSAT, adapted it in spite of having plenty of its own technologies because customers such as Samsung has strongly required it. Figure 1 presents the operation principle of Single Head <b>Pick</b> <b>and</b> <b>Place</b> Module. By utilizing the single head, <b>Pick</b> <b>and</b> <b>Place</b> machines <b>pick</b> the die from on wafer <b>and</b> <b>placing</b> them in the holes. Single Head technology is principle operation method, thus architecture technology. The K having accumulated knowledge about the operation principle of the <b>Pick</b> <b>and</b> <b>Place</b> machine began the innovation, because single Head component had a time lag during the process from picking the die to placing it the hole. Also the time required to move the die hindered quality control. Real time product inspection is much more important for OSATs.|$|R
30|$|In 1940 s, {{a printed}} circuit board (PCB) was created. It reduced the {{increasing}} complexity of attempting to wire circuits manually. However, as PCBs became more prevalent and advanced, it also became difficult to quickly and accurately produce circuit boards in large quantities. To solve these difficulties, the <b>Pick</b> <b>and</b> <b>Place</b> method, with its ability to place a large quantity of components on board extremely quickly arrived. <b>Pick</b> <b>and</b> <b>Place</b> machines all function by picking up a component in one <b>place</b> <b>and</b> putting it in another, instead of using fingers or tweezers like a human operator would use.

40|$|Abstract — In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} {{constructive}} heuristic to optimise the component <b>pick</b> <b>and</b> <b>place</b> operations of a hybrid <b>pick</b> <b>and</b> <b>place</b> machine, which is {{a new type of}} surface mount device placement machine. Since a nozzle change operation is very expensive (it significantly adds to the overall assembly time), the heuristic gives highest priority to minimising the number of nozzle changes. The ordered nozzle selection heuristic begins by choosing the best nozzle pair that is most effective for <b>picking</b> <b>and</b> <b>placing</b> components onto the printed circuit board (PCB). Next, we schedule all pairs of PCB points, that are expecting components from the chosen nozzle pair. Then, the nozzle pairs are re-ranked based on the availability of component feeders and the PCB points that need to be scheduled. Again, the best nozzle pair is chosen and the previous steps are repeated. When none of the selected nozzle pairs can <b>pick</b> <b>and</b> <b>place</b> two components in a sub tour, we schedule the one component sub tour. Finally, when all the available PCB points, have been scheduled, we then reoptimise the schedule by minimising the nozzles changes. Computational results are presented. ...|$|R

30|$|From the findings, I can {{see that}} once {{dominant}} design, <b>Pick</b> <b>and</b> <b>Place</b> had been accepted, engineers {{are not likely to}} re-evaluate like the radical innovation (e.g., from PCB to <b>Pick</b> <b>and</b> <b>Place</b> way). Engineers tried to refine the initial set of components and tried to shape component improvements in the component within the framework of a stable architecture by using architectural knowledge. New component knowledge becomes more valuable to a firm than new architectural knowledge because completion between designs revolves around refinements in particular components (Henderson and Clark, 1990). The K have strongly focused on development of customised equipment to fit the needs of a customer since in an industry characterized by a dominant design (<b>Pick</b> <b>and</b> <b>Place)</b> architectural knowledge is stable (Henderson and Clark, 1990; Christensen, 1997).

40|$|At present, the {{majority}} of industrial robots are not well suited to {{the specific needs of}} the food industry. Additionally the high cost of robotic systems means that it is cur- rently difficult for food manufacturers to financially justify the use of this technology. The availability of low-cost industrial robots specifically designed for food production might encourage a wider adoption of robotics and automation in the food industry and would benefit food manufacturers by reducing production cost. s and increasing compet- itiveness in what is becoming an increasingly difficult market. This thesis examines the unique requirements of the food industry relevant to robot. manipulator design and describes the design, manufacture and evaluation of a low-cost, high-speed robotic arm developed specifically for use in food production. Industrial requirements for hygienic design, low cost, high <b>pick</b> <b>and</b> <b>place</b> speed, safety for operation alongside human work- ers and ease of reprogramming are discussed in detail. A successful manipulator design must consider these functional requirements from the very outset of the design process. The low-cost robot prototype presented is an articulated arm. high-speed <b>pick</b> <b>and</b> <b>place</b> robot, hygienically designed in food grade stainless steel. Suitable for primary and sec- ondary packaging of foods, the arm has 4 degrees of freedom, a reach of 720 mm and weighs 20 kg. It is capable of <b>pick</b> <b>and</b> <b>place</b> speeds in excess of 100 picks/minute, has a payload capacity of 1 kg and repeatability of ± 0. 2 mm. The robot is also fully back- driveable with a low average power consumption at full speed of around 110 W, which is comparable to levels which might. be considered safe for robot-human interaction. Op- tirnised performance was achieved by means of a novel trajectory planning algorithm, using an elliptical <b>pick</b> <b>and</b> <b>place</b> path coupled with a Modified Sine cam motion pro- file. This is compared to traditional methods of trajectory planning used in industry. The elliptical trajectory exhibits very smooth, continuous motion curves. Asymmetric acceleration is additionally used t. o reduce peak joint torques <b>and</b> increase maximum <b>pick</b> <b>and</b> <b>place</b> speed further. An asymmetry factor look-up table, calculated through dynamic modelling of the robot arm, specifies the optimum degree of asymmetry to use for any given trajectory. This enables the generation of high-speed, asymmetric <b>pick</b> <b>and</b> <b>place</b> trajectories over the entire work envelope. The performance of the food robot prototype is comparable to that of commercial high-speed industrial robots in terms of <b>pick</b> <b>and</b> <b>place</b> speed, payload capacity and repeatability.
