The effects of: (i) the ratio of lug width (w) to hole diameter (d), (ii) {{the ratio of the}} distance of the hole centre from the free end of the lug (h) to hole diameter (4, and (iii) the pin interference/clearance, on the magnitude and position of the maximum circumferential stress around the hole in the lug are established and discussed. <b>Pin</b> <b>fit</b> is shown to be a particularly important detail and the beneficial effects of an interference fit are shown to be considerable.

Criteria are measuring factors including interface connector attributes, such as the number, size, and weight; positioning attributes, such as the ease of position, and easy of handling; and operation attributes, such as accessibility, ease of assembly, tool applications. Geometry complexity includes parts’ size, shape and weight. Operation complexity considers fasteners’ operation and position. Values of these elements are assigned by weighting factors for their importance in interface operations, including parts connected, connectors used, geometry complexity, operation complexity, tools used in the operation, and operation accessibility. For commonly used various fasteners, including bolt-nut-washer, screw, screw-washer, <b>pin</b> <b>fit,</b> taper fit, key-key way, and spline fit, their weighting factors are assigned considering the number of parts and tools used in the operation.|$|E

40|$|Fatigue {{tests have}} been {{conducted}} on single-pinned and double-pinned lugs made from alloy steel FV 520 B and loaded by means of 2 in diameter pins. The effects of <b>pin</b> <b>fit</b> for both clearance and interference and of various treatments were investigated. The treatments included side relieving the lug hole, bushing the bore, applying the Sulhuz process to the lug or overstraining the lug bore. Two conditions of mean stress were investigated, namely, pulsating or repeated tension and 15 tons/ina mean tension. Basing comparison on the fatigue strength at 30 x lo 8 cycles, the untreated lugs with close fit pins showed the lowest strength of all. Both clearance and interference fits were beneficial and by appropriate choice, the fatigue strength could be at least doubled {{and in some cases}} trebled. Lugs which had side relief, had been bushed, Sulfinuz treated or which had oversuained bores also gave worthwhile increases in fatigue strength and the strength ratios were generally in excess of 2. An increase in mean stress significantly reduced fatigue strength for all lugs tested, except for those with close fit or clearance fit pins. Comparing the present results with those obtained on lugs one-quarter the size, a considerable sue effect is evident for some conditions, large lugs being weaker than small lugs...|$|E
