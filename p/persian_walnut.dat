5|$|English walnut (Juglans regia) (or <b>Persian</b> <b>walnut)</b> was {{introduced}} to California around 1770. California now represents 99% of US walnut growth. It is often combined with salads, vegetables, fruits or desserts because of its distinctive taste.|$|E
25|$|Tamburs {{are made}} {{almost entirely of}} wood. The shell (Tekne) is {{assembled}} from strips of hardwood called ribs joined edge to edge to form a semi-spherical body for the instrument. The number of ribs traditionally amounts to 17, 21 or 23, yet examples with slightly wider and consequently fewer ribs (7, 9 or 11) {{can also be found}} among older specimens. Traditionally, thinner strips called fileto are inserted between the ribs for ornamental purposes, but are not obligatory. The most common tonewood veneers used for rib-making are mahogany, flame maple, <b>Persian</b> <b>walnut,</b> Mecca balsam wood (Commiphora gileadensis), Spanish chestnut, Greek juniper, mulberry, Oriental plane, Indian rosewood and apricot. Ribs are assembled on the bottom wedge (tail) and the heel on which the fingerboard is mounted.|$|E
2500|$|The eastern {{black walnut}} (J.nigra) {{is a common}} species in its native eastern North America, and is also widely {{cultivated}} elsewhere. The nuts are edible, and though they are often used in expensive baked goods, the <b>Persian</b> <b>walnut</b> is preferred for everyday use because {{it is easier to}} extract the nutmeat.

5000|$|Walnut oil is oil {{extracted}} from <b>walnuts</b> Juglans regia (<b>Persian</b> <b>walnuts).</b> Each 100 g of oil provides about 63.3 g polyunsaturated fatty acids, 22.8 g monounsaturated fats, and 9.1 g saturated fats. It contains no cholesterol.|$|R
50|$|The heartnut is a {{cultivar}} of Japanese walnut {{distinguished by}} its fruit, which is heart-shaped in cross section, easier to crack, {{and able to}} yield an unbroken nut meat when cracked.

2500|$|The best-known {{member of}} the genus is the <b>Persian</b> <b>walnut</b> (J.regia, {{literally}} [...] "royal walnut"), native from the Balkans in southeast Europe, southwest and central Asia to the Himalaya and southwest China. Walnuts are a traditional feature of Iranian cuisine; the nation has extensive orchards which are an important feature of regional economies. In Kyrgyzstan alone, there are 230,700 ha of walnut-fruit forest, where J.regia is the dominant overstory tree (Hemery and Popov 1998).

50|$|Many {{species of}} tree show {{varying degrees of}} resistance, such as the heartnut, Butternut, and the Japanese, Black, and <b>Persian</b> <b>Walnuts.</b> It is {{sometimes}} claimed that higher levels of resistance result from thicker bark; however, since the disease enters through breaks in the bark, {{it is unlikely that}} bark thickness influences resistance. Additionally, both trees produce phenolics immediately upon attack, later producing gums and tyloses to surround the pathogen.|$|R
5000|$|Edible {{fruit is}} {{produced}} in husks that are yellow-green when ripe; collection is either by picking fallen fruits from the ground, or otherwise harvesting from the canopy when the husks show signs of being ripe. The sap of the fruit husk is a strong dye and can stain hands and clothing. The nut inside is within a much harder {{and more difficult to}} crack shell than <b>Persian</b> <b>walnuts,</b> but the meat inside is comparable in flavour, perhaps a bit sweeter. [...] "Tocte", the fruit of the Andean walnut, are often sold in the farmer's markets of Ecuador. The process of husk removal often stains the shells of the nuts black.|$|R

50|$|The {{progress}} of thousand cankers will vary due to several factors, notably the susceptibility of the host. There {{appears to be}} a considerable range of TCD susceptibility among various Juglans species with Juglans nigra (black walnut) being particularly susceptible. Conversely, Arizona walnut (Juglans major) appears to be quite resistant to the disease, with bark beetle attacks largely limited to small diameter branches, the fungus growing to a very limited extent, and effects of the disease rarely, if ever, progressing to involve large areas of the tree. Similarly southern California walnut (Juglans californica) and little walnut (Juglans microcarpa) may show fairly high resistance. Northern California walnut (Juglans hindsii) and the commercial nut-producing <b>Persian</b> (English) <b>walnut</b> (Juglans regia) apparently show various degrees of intermediate TCD susceptibility.|$|R

50|$|The {{two most}} common major species of walnuts are grown for their seeds - the <b>Persian</b> or English <b>walnut</b> {{and the black}} walnut. The English walnut (J. regia) {{originated}} in Persia, and the black walnut (J. nigra) is native to eastern North America. The black walnut is of high flavor, but due to its hard shell and poor hulling characteristics it is not grown commercially for nut production. Numerous walnut cultivars have been developed commercially, which are nearly all hybrids of the English walnut.|$|R
50|$|A walnut is the nut of any tree of {{the genus}} Juglans (Family Juglandaceae), {{particularly}} the <b>Persian</b> or English <b>walnut,</b> Juglans regia. Technically a walnut is the seed of a drupe or drupaceous nut, and thus not a true botanical nut. It is used for food after being processed while green for pickled walnuts or after full ripening for its nutmeat. Nutmeat of the eastern black walnut from the Juglans nigra is less commercially available, as are butternut nutmeats from Juglans cinerea. The walnut is nutrient-dense with protein and essential fatty acids.|$|R

40|$|A new {{bacterial}} disease of <b>Persian</b> (English) <b>walnut</b> (Juglans regia) {{has been observed}} in France. This disease, called vertical oozing canker (VOC), is characterized by vertical cankers on trunks and branches of affected walnut trees with oozing exudates. To determine the aetiology of the disease, a study {{was carried out in}} 79 walnut orchards and nurseries located in southeastern and southwestern France. Bacterial analysis from diseased samples yielded 36 strains identified as Xanthomonas arboricola and 32 strains identified as Brenneria nigrifluens on the basis of biochemical tests. The causal agent of VOC was identified as X. arboricola by pathogenicity tests on walnut. Fluorescent amplified fragment length polymorphism (F-AFLP) was carried out on 36 strains ofX. arboricola collected in this study, 24 strains of X. arboricola pv. juglandis isolated from walnut blight symptoms and one strain of X. arboricola pv. corylina included as an outgroup. Based on cluster analysis of F-AFLP data,most X. arboricola strains responsible formain VOCoutbreaks showed a high degree of similarity, forming a cluster clearly separate from strains of X. arboricola pv. juglandis isolated from walnut blight symptoms. It is suggested that VOC is caused by a distinct genetic lineage within the pathovar juglandis of X. arboricola that is also able to cause classical bacterial blight symptoms on walnut leaves and fruits.

40|$|India was a fore – runner in art {{of natural}} dyeing, an art perfected during {{the era of}} the great Epics. It was known as a leading source of the {{earliest}} natural dyes and still continues {{to be one of the}} imminent producers of the same and enjoys its place as a land with a rich cultural heritage of traditional crafts. One such craft perfected in India is the fabric tie- dye technique known as Bandhani and Leheriya. Bandhani as it is popularly known in India comes from the Hindi word which means tying to give a dotted pattern and Leheriya means tying of fabric diagonally to produce a stripe pattern and is mostly done in the Western states of Rajasthan and Gujarat. Traditionally tie and dye was done employing natural dyes. But with the advent of synthetic dyes, tie and dye with natural dyes were found to be losing their grounds.
