50|$|At the {{beginning}} of her career (1973-1975), using play, therapeutic discussions and <b>parent</b> <b>guidance</b> as her means of intervention, Yahav worked with children, adolescents and their parents. For 15 years, beginning in 1975, she worked at the Technion’s Psychological Services where she specialized in psychotherapy for young adults with a variety of difficulties: students suffering from exam anxiety, shyness, depression, personality disorders, eating disorders, interpersonal problems, identity issues, separation difficulties, marital problems, and more. Her therapeutic work is based on classic and contemporary psychodynamic theory, psychosocial approaches, cognitive-behavioural approaches and a number of family therapy approaches. In 1978-1979, Yahav worked with patients of Rambam Hospital’s Psychiatric Clinic who were living in the community, conducting family interventions as well. In the 1980s, Yahav opened a private clinic that she maintains to the present day. She generally sees long-term psychodynamic psychotherapy clients and she supervises other clinicians. Toward the mid-1980s, the emphasis in her work and her therapy moved to theories she saw as more complex and she deepened her studies and therapy, studying Jungian psychotherapy and afterward classic and contemporary psychodynamic approaches: Freud’s Drive Theory, Anna Freud’s Ego-Psychology Theory, Object Relations Theory of Fairburn, Melanie Klein and Winnicott, and self-psychology and inter-subjective psychology. Yahav applies these approaches when conducting psychotherapy with adults, in parental guidance. This clinical work provides a fertile base upon which to do research.|$|E

This dissertation deals with this prominence of children and mothers in urban policies in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. It departs from the observation that mothers, in particular, matter in urban policy making and the struggle of former industrial cities to reinvent themselves. I was curious about why mothers and children featured so very prominently in urban policies in Rotterdam and also how this resulted in policy practices and what was done in these practices. For this purpose, I did participatory, ethnographic research in a range or <b>parenting</b> <b>guidance</b> practices. I was interested in what goes on in the room. What happens when policy ambitions for the city enter a classroom, school kitchen, family home or community centre where "parenting guidance" is taking place? What do professionals such as teachers, pedagogues and social workers produce together with participating mothers? And how does this relate to imagined urban futures and the new post-industrial economy...|$|R

This article looks at a case of paternalist intervention there: <b>parenting</b> <b>guidance.</b> Using ethnographic data, it argues that today’s paternalism is distinctly egalitarian in its form. Egalitarian interactional forms such as debate and negotiation were produced between mothers and practitioners. These forms prevailed, no matter what content practitioners and mothers discussed.

The research problem that was investigated was: Do Xhosa parents with children with cerebral palsy need guidance programmes, and what guidelines can be given pertaining to such programmes? The aim {{was to determine whether}} Xhosa parents needed guidance programmes and if so, to provide guidelines that addressed this need. A literature study was done and thereafter a survey was conducted using a questionnaire with closed items to collect data from 180 Xhosa parents with children with cerebral palsy living in the rural areas of the Eastern Cape's former Transkei. They were sampled by using a non-random (purposive) sampling method. One hundred and two (102) parents (out of the total of 180) answered the questions in the questionnaires and returned them by mail. The same types of questions were used to interview 54 parents. The data was analyzed by a statistical analyst by Microsoft Excel spread sheets. Data was presented in the form of tables and pie charts and the researcher interpreted the outcomes {{in the light of the}} literature and her own indigenous knowledge of the Xhosa community. The implications of findings for all Xhosa parents with children with cerebral palsy are that they lack knowledge of issues such as cerebral palsy, inclusive education and how to deal with their children with cerebral palsy.

It would seem therefore, that the single-parent (more than other parents) is reliant on help and/or guidance {{in dealing with the}} problems which he/she and his/her child(ren) face. Although much research. has been done regarding single-parent families, studies of available literature indicate a lack of guidelines for single-parents concerning the effective management of the crises of the single-parent family, especially of the child(ren) involved. This void, together with the increasing reality of single-parent families in the South African society, motivated the author to undertake this study. To accomplish the aims of this study, namely: * to determine the specific needs which single-parents and their children have; * to ascertain whether single-parents would benefit from attending a <b>parent</b> <b>guidance</b> programme; and * to propose some guidelines towards developing a <b>parent</b> <b>guidance</b> programme for single-parents, a literature study and an empirical study were undertaken. The literature study covers the phenonema of single-parent families, <b>parent</b> <b>guidance</b> and relating themes, while the empirical study serves as and extension and confirmation of information surrounding the problems of single-parent families, with emphasis on the child(ren) in single-parent families. The empirical study comprises of three case studies of children in single-parent families seen at the Institute of Child and Adult Guidance of the Rand Afrikaans University. Both the literature study and the empirical study reveal that parents and children in single-parent families have unique and unenviable problems and difficulties which could, to some degree, be alleviated or even circumvented if single-parents were to receive some form of guidance concerning the proper and effective management of their and their children's (changed) circumstances and relationships.

Local literature showed a dearth of information on the current service delivery and roles of speech-language therapists (SLTs) and audiologists in neonatal nurseries in the South African context. SLTs have the opportunity to provide the earliest intervention, provided that intervention is well-timed in the neonatal nursery context. The aim of the research was to compile a locally relevant neonatal communication intervention instrument/tool for use by SLTs in neonatal nurseries of public hospitals. The study entailed descriptive, exploratory research. During phase 1, a survey was received from 39 SLTs and 2 audiologists in six provinces. The data revealed that participants performed different roles in neonatal nurseries, which depended on the environment, tools, materials and instrumentation available to them. Many participants were inexperienced, but resourceful in their attempts to adapt tools/materials.

Design: Children (n= 52, aged 4 - 18) were randomly allocated to either CBT (n= 26) or EMDR (n= 26) in a disaster mental health after-care setting after an explosion of a fireworks factory.
