5|$|The {{adrenal gland}} secretes {{a number of}} {{different}} hormones which are metabolised by enzymes either within the gland or in other <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body.</b> These hormones are involved in a number of essential biological functions.|$|E
5|$|All {{vertebrates}} have a blood–brain {{barrier that}} allows metabolism inside {{the brain to}} operate differently from metabolism in other <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body.</b> Glial cells {{play a major role}} in brain metabolism by controlling the chemical composition of the fluid that surrounds neurons, including levels of ions and nutrients.|$|E
5|$|Sometimes, pain {{caused in}} one <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> {{feels like it}} is coming from another <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body.</b> This is called {{referred}} pain.|$|R

5|$|Brachytherapy can be {{used with}} the aim of curing the cancer in cases of small or locally {{advanced}} tumours, provided the cancer has not metastasized (spread to other <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body).</b> In appropriately selected cases, brachytherapy for primary tumours often represents a comparable approach to surgery, achieving the same probability of cure and with similar side effects.|$|E
5|$|However, {{according}} to some hadiths regarding the rules of awrah, women are required to grow hair long, long enough that it would cover the breasts or as much awrah <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> when they're being buried, because she lacks clothes and long hair would {{be used as a}} covering instead.|$|E
5|$|Pain {{in cancer}} can be {{produced}} by mechanical (e.g. pinching) or chemical (e.g. inflammation) stimulation of specialized pain-signalling nerve endings found in most <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> (called nociceptive pain), {{or it may be}} caused by diseased, damaged or compressed nerves, in which case it is called neuropathic pain. Neuropathic pain is often accompanied by other feelings such as pins and needles.|$|E

5|$|The {{function}} of the brain is to provide coherent control over the actions of an animal. A centralized brain allows groups of muscles to be co-activated in complex patterns; it also allows stimuli impinging on {{one part of the}} body to evoke responses in other parts, and it can prevent different <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> from acting at cross-purposes to each other.|$|E
5|$|The lung is {{a common}} place for the spread of tumors from other <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body.</b> Secondary cancers are {{classified}} by the site of origin; e.g., breast cancer that has spread to the lung is called metastatic breast cancer. Metastases often have a characteristic round appearance on chest radiograph.|$|E
5|$|A soccer kick is {{performed}} when a fighter is standing {{to the side}} or {{in front of an}} opponent on the ground and kicks the grounded opponent's head. This is done in a style similar to an association football player kicking a football. Most practitioners aim to use their shins for the point of impact rather than the foot. While soccer kicks are usually delivered to the head, kicks to other <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> in a similar style are also referred to as soccer kicks.|$|E

5|$|Although {{spinal cord}} injury (SCI) often causes sexual dysfunction, many people with SCI are able to have {{satisfying}} sex lives. Physical limitations acquired from SCI affect sexual function and sexuality in broader areas, {{which in turn has}} important effects on quality of life. Damage to the spinal cord impairs its ability to transmit messages between the brain and <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> below the level of the lesion. This results in lost or reduced sensation and muscle motion, and affects orgasm, erection, ejaculation, and vaginal lubrication. More indirect causes of sexual dysfunction include pain, weakness, and side effects of medications. Psycho-social causes include depression and altered self-image. Many people with SCI have satisfying sex lives, and many experience sexual arousal and orgasm. People with SCI employ a variety of adaptations to help carry on their sex lives healthily, by focusing on different areas of the body and types of sexual acts. Neural plasticity may account for increases in sensitivity in <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> that have not lost sensation, so people often find newly sensitive erotic areas of the skin in erogenous zones or near borders between areas of preserved and lost sensation.|$|E
5|$|As in all arthropods, the chelicerate {{body has}} a very small coelom {{restricted}} to small areas round the reproductive and excretory systems. The main body cavity is a hemocoel that runs most {{of the length of}} the body and through which blood flows, driven by a tubular heart that collects blood from the rear and pumps it forward. Although arteries direct the blood to specific <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body,</b> they have open ends rather than joining directly to veins, and chelicerates therefore have open circulatory systems as is typical for arthropods.|$|E
5|$|Dr Sadiq Alekry, a 44-year-old plastic surgeon, voluntarily {{offered his}} {{services}} at the roundabout {{on the evening of}} 16February, shortly after he had returned from Houston. According to Human rights watch, Alekry along with other staff were wearing special medical jackets showing the Red Crescent. During the raid, riot police attacked his tent and cut through it; despite telling them he was a physician, police handcuffed him from his back and a number of security officers repeatedly punched, kicked and hit him with sticks on his head and other <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body.</b>|$|E

5|$|Endometrial {{cancer is}} a cancer that arises from the {{endometrium}} (the lining of the uterus or womb). It {{is the result of}} the abnormal growth of cells that have the ability to invade or spread to other <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body.</b> The first sign is most often vaginal bleeding not associated with a menstrual period. Other symptoms include pain with urination, pain during sexual intercourse, or pelvic pain. Endometrial cancer occurs most commonly after menopause.|$|E
5|$|Generally, {{the areas}} {{affected}} are exposed skin not usually protected by clothing; however {{it can also}} occur in areas covered by clothing. Areas constantly subjected to the sun's rays may only be slightly affected if at all. People with extreme cases will also have reactions to light bulbs that emit a UV wavelength (any bulb {{that is not an}} LED). <b>Parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> only thinly covered can also potentially be subjected to an outbreak.|$|E
5|$|In other <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body,</b> {{circulation}} in the lymphatic vasculature clears extracellular waste {{products from the}} cell tissue. For the tissue of the brain, such a system {{has not yet been}} identified. However, the presence of a glymphatic pathway has been proposed. Newer studies from two laboratories have shown the presence of meningeal lymphatic vessels running alongside the blood vessels, and these have been shown with lymph valves, to be more extensive {{at the base of the}} brain where they exit with the cranial nerves.|$|E

5|$|Lung cancer, {{also known}} as lung carcinoma, is a {{malignant}} lung tumor characterized by uncontrolled cell growth in tissues of the lung. This growth can spread beyond the lung {{by the process of}} metastasis into nearby tissue or other <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body.</b> Most cancers that start in the lung, known as primary lung cancers, are carcinomas. The two main types are small-cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) and non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). The most common symptoms are coughing (including coughing up blood), weight loss, shortness of breath, and chest pains.|$|E
5|$|Preservation of {{the outer}} <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> was {{normally}} achieved {{through a combination of}} resins and animal skin wrappings. The resins were prepared with a mixture of minerals, plants, and fats. These were spread across the body prior to allowing it to dry, either in the sun or through smoking. Finally, the deceased was wrapped in animal skins and laid to rest. The number of animal skins used in wrapping corresponded with the individual’s social status, with kings being wrapped with up to 15 skins.|$|E
5|$|Scales {{may have}} evolved {{initially}} for providing insulation.
