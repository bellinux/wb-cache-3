40|$|Morphine is {{the most}} {{effective}} <b>pain-relieving</b> <b>drug,</b> but it can cause unwanted side effects. Direct neuraxial administration of morphine to spinal cord not only can provide effective, reliable pain relief but also can prevent the development of supraspinal side effects. However, repeated neuraxial administration of morphine may still lead to morphine tolerance. To better understand the mechanism that causes morphine tolerance, we induced tolerance in rats at the spinal cord level by giving them twice-daily injections of morphine (20 µg/ 10 µL) for 4 days. We confirmed tolerance by measuring paw withdrawal latencies and maximal possible analgesic effect of morphine on day 5. We then carried out phosphoproteomic analysis to investigate the global phosphorylation of spinal proteins associated with morphine tolerance. Finally, pull-down assays were used to identify phosphorylated types and sites of 14 - 3 - 3 proteins, and bioinformatics was applied to predict biological networks impacted by the morphine-regulated proteins. Our proteomics data showed that repeated morphine treatment altered phosphorylation of 10 proteins in the spinal cord. Pull-down assays identified 2 serine/threonine phosphorylated sites in 14 - 3 - 3 proteins. Bioinformatics further revealed that morphine impacted on cytoskeletal reorganization, neuroplasticity, protein folding and modulation, signal transduction and biomolecular metabolism. Repeated morphine administration may affect multiple biological networks by altering protein phosphorylation. These data may provide insight into the mechanism that underlies the development of morphine tolerance...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{efficacy}} {{of many of}} <b>pain-relieving</b> <b>drugs</b> is based on mechanisms by which the drugs interfere with the body’s natural pain-mediating pathways. By contrast, although it is less popular, other drugs including opioids exert more powerful analgesic actions by augmenting endogenous inhibitory neural circuits for pain mediation. Recently, a novel endogenous pain-inhibitory principle was suggested and is now attracting both scientific and clinical attentions. The central players for the actions are particular body lipids: resolvins. Although research is in the preclinical phase, multiple hypotheses have actively been matured regarding the potency and molecular and neural processes of the analgesic effects of these substances. Consistently, accumulating experimental evidence has been demonstrating that treatment with these lipid substances is strongly effective at controlling diverse types of pain. Treatment of resolvins {{does not appear to}} disturb the body homeostasis as severely as many other therapeutic agents that interrupt the body’s natural signaling flow, which enables us to predict their fewer adverse effects. This paper serves as a review of currently documented painkilling actions of resolvins, summarizes the potential cellular and receptor-mediated mechanisms to date, and discusses the many clinical uses for these therapeutic lipids that have not yet been tested. Future scientific efforts will more concentrate to unveil such aspects of the substances and to construct clear proofs of concept for pain relief...|$|R
40|$|Experimental and {{clinical}} studies {{concerned with the}} effects of "hypnotically-sug-gested analgesia " in surgery, in labor, and in chronic pain are critically evaluated. The review suggests that "hypnotic analgesia " at times produces not a reduction in pain but an unwillingness to state directly to the hypnotist that pain was experienced or a temporary "amnesia " for the pain experienced. In other instances, suggestions of pain relief given under "hypnosis " produce some degree of diminution in anxiety and pain as indicated by reduction in physiological responses to noxious stimuli and by reduc-tion in requests for <b>pain-relieving</b> <b>drugs.</b> The data suggest that "the hypnotic trance state " may be an extraneous variable in ameliorating pain experience in situations de-scribed as "hypnosis; " the critical variables appear to include: (a) suggestions of pain relief, which are (b) given in a close interpersonal setting. A NUMBER OF INVESTIGATOHS 34 contend that "hypnotically-suggested analgesia" lessens or entirely prevents pain, while others 82 are of the opinion that hypnotic suggestions produce verbal denial of pain experience without affecting pain and suf-fering. This paper critically evaluates the effects of "hypnosis " on pain. Relevant clinical and experimental studies are re-viewed to answer two questions: (1) Does "hypnotically-suggested analgesia" refer to reduction of pain, to verbal de-nial of the pain experienced, or to a com-bination of both of these effects?

40|$|Treatment for CIN {{is usually}} {{undertaken}} in an outpatient colposcopy clinic {{to remove the}} pre-cancerous cells from the cervix. It commonly involves lifting the cells off the cervix with electrically heated wire (diathermy) or laser, or destroying the abnormal cells with freezing methods (cryotherapy). This is potentially a painful procedure. The purpose of this review is to determine which, if any, pain relief should be used during cervical colposcopy treatment. We identified 17 trials and these reported different forms of pain relief before, during and after colposcopy. Evidence from two small trials showed that women having a colposcopy treatment had less pain and blood loss if the cervix was injected {{with a combination of}} a local anaesthetic drug and a drug that causes blood vessels to constrict (narrow), compared with placebo. Although taking oral <b>pain-relieving</b> <b>drugs</b> (e. g. ibuprofen) before treatment on the cervix in the colposcopy clinic is recommended by most guidelines, evidence from two small trials did not show that this practice reduced pain during the procedure. Most of the evidence in this field is of a low to moderate quality and further research may change these findings. Additionally, we were unable to obtain evidence with regards to dosage of the local anaesthetic drug or method of administering local anaesthetic into the cervix.

40|$|Over {{the past}} two decades, a steeply growing number of persons with chronic non-cancer pain have been using opioid analgesics chronically to treat it, {{accompanied}} by a markedly increased prevalence of individuals with opioid-related misuse, opioid use disorders, emergency department visits, hospitalizations, admissions to drug treatment programs, and drug overdose deaths. This opioid misuse and overdose epidemic calls for well-designed randomized-controlled clinical trials into more skillful and appropriate pain management and for developing effective analgesics which have lower abuse liability and are protective against stress induced by chronic non-cancer pain. However, incomplete knowledge regarding effective approaches to treat various types of pain has been worsened by an under-appreciation of overlapping neurobiological mechanisms of stress, stress-induced relapse to opioid use, and chronic non-cancer pain in patients presenting for care for these conditions. This insufficient knowledge base has unfortunately encouraged common prescription of conveniently-available opioid <b>pain-relieving</b> <b>drugs</b> with abuse liability, as opposed to treating underlying problems using team-based multidisciplinary, patient-centered, collaborative-care approaches for addressing pain and co-occurring stress and risk for opioid use disorder. This paper reviews recent neurobiological findings regarding overlapping mechanisms of stress-induced relapse to opioid misuse and chronic non-cancer pain, and then discusses these {{in the context of}} key outstanding evidence gaps and clinical-treatment research directions which may be pursued to fill these gaps. Such research directions, if conducted through well-designed randomized controlled trials, may substantively inform clinical practice in general medical settings on how to effectively care for patients presenting with pain-related distress and these common co-occurring conditions...|$|R
5000|$|Eleven {{countries}} have national classification systems {{of pain and}} suffering experienced by animals used in research: Australia, Canada, Finland, Germany, The Republic of Ireland, The Netherlands, New Zealand, Poland, Sweden, Switzerland, and the UK. The US also has a mandated national scientific animal-use classification system, but it is markedly different from other countries in that it reports on whether <b>pain-relieving</b> <b>drugs</b> were required and/or used. The first severity scales were implemented in 1986 by Finland and the UK. The number of severity categories ranges between 3 (Sweden and Finland) and 9 (Australia). In the UK, research projects are classified as [...] "mild", [...] "moderate", and [...] "substantial" [...] {{in terms of the}} suffering the researchers conducting the study say they may cause; a fourth category of [...] "unclassified" [...] means the animal was anesthetized and killed without recovering consciousness.

Morphine is a potent analgesic that provides effective pain relief in adults, but there is inconclusive evidence for its effectiveness in infants. The {{purpose of this study}} is to establish whether oral morphine provides effective analgesia for procedural pain in infants.   A blinded, placebo-controlled, parallel-group randomized, phase II, clinical trial will be undertaken to determine whether morphine sulphate administered orally prior to clinically-required retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) screening and heel lancing provides effective analgesia.   156 infants between 34 and 42 weeks’ gestational age who require a clinical heel lance and ROP screening on the same test occasion will be included in the trial. Infants will be randomised to receive either a single dose of morphine sulphate (100 μg/kg) or placebo. Each infant will be monitored for 48 hours and safety data will be collected during the 24 hours following drug administration.   The primary outcome will be the Premature Infant Pain Profile–revised (PIPP-R) score 30 seconds after ROP screening. The co-primary outcome will be the magnitude of nociceptive-specific brain activity evoked by a clinically-required heel lance. Infant clinical stability will be assessed by comparing the number of episodes of bradycardia, tachycardia, desaturation and apnoea, and changes in respiratory support requirements in the 24 -hour periods before and after the clinical intervention. In addition, drug safety will be assessed by considering the occurrence of apnoeic and hypotensive episodes requiring intervention in the 24 -hour period following drug administration.

40|$|Pain {{management}} in conditions of chronic inflammation is a clinical challenge, and increasing {{our understanding of}} the mechanisms driving this type of pain is important. In the previous issue of Arthritis Research & Therapy, Boettger and colleagues examine the role of IL- 6 in antigen-induced arthritis using the IL- 6 neutralizing soluble glycoprotein 130 and link IL- 6 to a pathophysiological role in the generation of pain, independent of the proinflammatory properties of IL- 6. The findings presented in this study add to a growing body of evidence highlighting the role of IL- 6 in the induction and maintenance of pain. Adequate pain {{management in}} conditions of chronic inflammation, such as rheumatoid arthritis, is a clinical challenge. While <b>pain-relieving</b> <b>drugs</b> such as cyclooxygenase-inhibitors and opioids work well in the short term, long-term use is frequently associated with side effects. The ongoing search for novel drugs for treatment of chronic pain is therefore well motivated. Proinflam matory cytokines such as TNF, IL- 1 and IL- 6 are major mediators of joint inflammation and destruction, and an increasing pool of preclinical data indicates that these cytokines are also key players in the generation and maintenance of pain. In the previous issue of Arthritis Research & Therapy, Boettger and colleagues focus on IL- 6 and report that this cytokine plays a significant role in arthritis-induced joint pain [1]. IL- 6 is a multifunctional cytokine, with proinflammatory and other regulatory properties. IL- 6 exerts its effect on target cells by binding to the IL- 6 specific membrane receptor (IL- 6 R), which activates the transducer glycoprotein 130 (gp 130), the second subunit of the IL- 6 R complex. Neurons are devoid of membrane-bound IL- 6 R, but these cells can still react to IL- 6 when IL- 6 is boun...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the present criminal law position {{with respect to}} medically administered active voluntary euthanasia in Australia. Under existing criminal law principles, whilst there is some scope for passive euthanasia, active volunta. rY euthanasia is treated as murder and no account is taken of the special circumstances existing in such cases. Notwithstanding this prohibition, {{there is evidence that}} Australian doctors are involved in the practice of active voluntary euthanasia. However, police and prosectors appear reluctant to intervene in this area of medical practice, and judging from the experience in other jurisdictions, there is every likelihood that if a doctor were prosecuted in Australia for having administered active voluntary euthanasia, the doctor would escape the full rigours of the criminal law. Against this background, this thesis seeks to highlight the problems which exist {{as a result of the}} marked discrepancies between law and practice in this area. Attention is also drawn to the law's differential treatment of active and passive euthanasia and the difficulties and anomalies which arise from the legal characterisation of a number of other medical practices which bear some similarity to active voluntary euthanasia such as the turning off of artificial life-support and the administration of <b>pain-relieving</b> <b>drugs</b> which are known to be likely to hasten the patient's death. The thesis argues that active voluntary euthanasia should not be subject to a blanket criminal law prohibition. This argument is based on a number of factors including the principle of self-determination, current legal and medical practice, changing community attitudes, and jurisprudential arguments regarding the proper role of the criminal law. The conclusion of this thesis is that the law with regard to active voluntary euthanasia in Australia should be reformed by the introduction of legislation creating· a very limited exception to the homicide laws that would confer on doctors an immunity from liability, provided active voluntary euthanasia is performed in accordance with strict criteria and safeguards. It is argued that the practice of active voluntary euthanasia by doctors in the Netherlands provides a useful guide to law reform in Australia...|$|R
40|$|Historically, {{treatment}} for pain relief has varied {{according to the}} social status of the sufferer. A similar tendency to make arbitrary distinctions affecting pain relief was found in an ethnographic study of animal research laboratories. The administration of <b>pain-relieving</b> <b>drugs</b> for animals in laboratories differed from standard practice for humans and, perhaps, for companion animals. Although anesthesia was used routinely for surgical procedures, its administration was sometimes haphazard. Analgesics, however, were rarely used. Most researchers had never thought about using analgesics and did not consider the subject worthy of serious attention. Scientists interviewed for this study agreed readily that animals are capable offeeling pain, but such assertions were muted by an overriding view of lab animals as creatures existing solely {{for the purposes of}} research. As a result, it was the exceptional scientist who was able to focus on anything about the animal's subjective experience that might lie outside the boundaries of the research protocol. As Martin Pemick tells it, "The Case of McGonigle's Foot " is a horror story (Pemick, 1985, pp. 3 - 8). On a summer day in 1862 a Philadelphia laborer named McGonigle took a fall and fractured his ankle. He was rushed to a hospital, where doctors immediately amputated the man's foot-without anesthesia. This occurred 16 years after a public demonstration of ether anesthesia at the Massachusetts General Hospital had shown an astonished world that surgery could be painless. The Pennsylvania Hospital, where McGonigle was taken, had been among the last of the major medical institutions in the United States to introduce anesthetic drugs, but even there ether had been in use for a good 10 years. Chloroform and nitrous oxide had been in general use for almost as long as ether, and all were inexpensive and readily available in 1862. So why no anesthesia for poor McGonigle? (Who, incidentally, died of shock two days later.) The case was not an isolated incident For several decades after its discovery, anesthesia was withheld in a large proportion of surgical operations.

40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyDepartment of Diagnostic Medicine and PathobiologyRonette GehringThe {{absence of}} pain {{management}} for common husbandry procedures, such as dehorning and castration of cattle, {{is considered to}} be an important animal welfare consideration, but there are currently no drugs approved by the FDA for the purpose of providing pain relief in cattle. The FDA’s Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM) recognizes the need for the availability of <b>pain-relieving</b> <b>drugs</b> and has encouraged research into the development of behavioral and physiologic measures which can reliably demonstrate the effectiveness in that species. The USDA has also recognized this need by providing grants for research into investigating pain models for cattle {{that can be used for}} the development of pain mitigation methods. The studies reported in this dissertation were funded by the USDA and the American Association of Bovine Practitioners. They add to the body of knowledge from which a pain model in cattle may eventually be validated for use in the drug approval process and also contribute to knowledge base for a candidate non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug for convenient use in cattle. The study reported in Chapter 2 was conducted to support research of a candidate pain-assessment variable, substance P. This study provides future researchers with recommended sample handling procedures for obtaining reliable and repeatable results, which is important if substance P is to be validated as pain biomarker in cattle. The study in Chapter 3 investigated the use of several variables for use in a pain model. The results provided researchers, veterinarians and policy-makers with evidence to support the common practice of castrating and dehorning calves at the same time rather than as individual procedures separated by a healing interim. The study in Chapter 4 investigated the pharmacokinetics of oral meloxicam when administered to juvenile ruminant and pre-ruminant calves. This study added to the growing knowledge base of the pharmacokinetics of oral meloxicam in cattle and also provided practitioners with practical information concerning the administration of the drug in milk replacer.

40|$|In this Special Section of the journal, {{we present}} some {{articles}} {{from a recent}} study that has attempted to piece together a detailed history {{of the field of}} cancer pain relief since 1945. Our interdisciplinary team of authors has expertise from the social sciences, from ethics and history, and from medicine and nursing. Our focus has been on identifying key forms of technological innovation, such as new pharmaceutical inventions and discoveries, as well as the redeployment into pain management of existing technologies used in other areas of health care. We have looked at how changing approaches to cancer pain relief are tied up with shifting understandings of patients and the problems they encounter with their disease, and how these are expressed in narratives of pain. At the same time, we have examined public health perspectives, seeing policy and strategic planning as ‘technologies’ that may impact upon cancer patients suffering pain. We have undertaken wide-ranging literature reviews, studied the detailed post–World War II history of the field of cancer pain relief, conducted interviews with key leaders in the field {{on both sides of the}} Atlantic, and traced patterns of innovation in new drugs, their modes of delivery, and the forces that shape clinical change. We have shown how, over the past fifty years, cancer patients have become more actively involved in their treatment and care; how concepts of cancer pain have moved beyond the physical to encompass mental, spiritual, and social suffering; and how the understanding of pain mechanisms and measurement has deepened. In this context, the promotion of patient autonomy has been a key driver of change—leading to the introduction of long-acting, <b>pain-relieving</b> <b>drugs,</b> special technologies for their delivery, and the vision of individually tailored pain management strategies. Such benefits have come within the compass of many—though not all—cancer patients in affluent nations. Elsewhere, in the poorer regions of the world, great problems persist. Draconian laws inhibit the manufacture, transportation, and medical use of strong opioids, clinicians remain anxious about their use, and patients fear the stigma associated with such treatments. From time to time, such concerns resurface in countries with otherwise well-developed approaches to pain and palliative care. The world of cancer pain is, therefore, fractured by significant moral and practical dilemmas that continue to demand attention. We hope that by setting out some aspects of historical development, our study can contribute to several key debates about freedom from pain as a basic human right, the ethical challenges that surround it, and the scientific, clinical, and political strategies that should prevail in the further development of innovative technologies for comprehensive and equitable cancer pain relief for all...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Although repeat {{radiation}} treatment {{has been shown}} to palliate pain in patients with bone metastases from multiple primary origin sites, data for the best possible dose fractionation schedules are lacking. We aimed to assess two dose fractionation schedules in patients with painful bone metastases needing repeat radiation therapy. METHODS: We did a multicentre, non-blinded, randomised, controlled trial in nine countries worldwide. We enrolled patients 18 years or older who had radiologically confirmed, painful (ie, pain measured as ≥ 2 points using the Brief Pain Inventory) bone metastases, had received previous radiation therapy, and were taking a stable dose and schedule of <b>pain-relieving</b> <b>drugs</b> (if prescribed). Patients were randomly assigned (1 : 1) to receive either 8 Gy in a single fraction or 20 Gy in multiple fractions by a central computer-generated allocation sequence using dynamic minimisation to conceal assignment, stratified by previous radiation fraction schedule, response to initial radiation, and treatment centre. Patients, caregivers, and investigators were not masked to treatment allocation. The primary endpoint was overall pain response at 2 months, which was defined as the sum of complete and partial pain responses to treatment, assessed using both Brief Pain Inventory scores and changes in analgesic consumption. Analysis was done by intention to treat. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials. gov, number NCT 00080912. FINDINGS: Between Jan 7, 2004, and May 24, 2012, we randomly assigned 425 patients to each treatment group. 19 (4 %) patients in the 8 Gy group and 12 (3 %) in the 20 Gy group were found to be ineligible after randomisation, and 140 (33 %) and 132 (31 %) patients, respectively, were not assessable at 2 months and were counted as missing data in the intention-to-treat analysis. In the intention-to-treat population, 118 (28 %) patients allocated to 8 Gy treatment and 135 (32 %) allocated to 20 Gy treatment had an overall pain response to treatment (p= 0 · 21; response difference of 4 · 00 % [upper limit of the 95 % CI 9 · 2, less than the prespecified non-inferiority margin of 10 %]). In the per-protocol population, 116 (45 %) of 258 patients and 134 (51 %) of 263 patients, respectively, had an overall pain response to treatment (p= 0 · 17; response difference 6 · 00 % [upper limit of the 95 % CI 13 · 2, greater than the prespecified non-inferiority margin of 10 %]). The most frequently reported acute radiation-related toxicities at 14 days were lack of appetite (201 [56 %] of 358 assessable patients who received 8 Gy vs 229 [66 %] of 349 assessable patients who received 20 Gy; p= 0 · 011) and diarrhoea (81 [23 %] of 357 vs 108 [31 %] of 349; p= 0 · 018). Pathological fractures occurred in 30 (7 %) of 425 patients assigned to 8 Gy and 20 (5 %) of 425 assigned to 20 Gy (odds ratio [OR] 1 · 54, 95 % CI 0 · 85 - 2 · 75; p= 0 · 15), and spinal cord or cauda equina compressions were reported in seven (2 %) of 425 versus two (< 1 %) of 425, respectively (OR 3 · 54, 95 % CI 0 · 73 - 17 · 15; p= 0 · 094). INTERPRETATION: In patients with painful bone metastases requiring repeat radiation therapy, treatment with 8 Gy in a single fraction seems to be non-inferior and less toxic than 20 Gy in multiple fractions; however, as findings were not robust in a per-protocol analysis, trade-offs between efficacy and toxicity might exist.

40|$|Cancer {{of unknown}} primary (CUP) is a {{heterogeneous}} syndrome diagnosed at metastatic sites. The etiology is unknown but immune dysfunction {{may be a}} contributing factor. Patients with autoimmune diseases were identified from the Swedish Hospital Discharge Register and linked to the Swedish Cancer Registry. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) were calculated for subsequent CUP and compared with subjects without autoimmune diseases. A total of 789, 681 patients were hospitalized for any of 32 autoimmune diseases during years 1964 - 2012; 2658 developed subsequent CUP, giving an overall SIR of 1. 27. A total of 16 autoimmune diseases were {{associated with an increased}} risk for CUP; polymyositis/dermatomyositis showed the highest SIR of 3. 51, followed by primary biliary cirrhosis (1. 81) and Addison's disease (1. 77). CUP risk is known to be reduced in long-time users of <b>pain-relieving</b> nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory <b>drugs</b> (NSAIDs), such as aspirin. For patients with ankylosing spondylitis and with some other autoimmune diseases, with assumed chronic medication by NSAIDSs, CUP risks decreased in long-term follow-up. The overall risk of CUP was increased among patients diagnosed with autoimmune diseases, which call for clinical attention and suggest a possible role of immune dysfunction in CUP. The associations with many autoimmune diseases were weak which may imply that autoimmunity may not synergize with CUP-related immune dysfunction. However, long-term NSAID medication probably helped to curtail risks in some autoimmune diseases and CUP risks were generally higher in autoimmune diseases for which NSAIDs are not used and for these CUP appears to be a serious side-effect.

40|$|Background: Canine hip {{dysplasia}} (HD) {{is characterized by}} hip joint laxity and subluxation. It {{is the most common}} cause of osteoarthritis in dogs, especially in larger breeds. Its management includes nutritional supplements, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, physical therapy, acupuncture or surgical procedures. Implantation of gold beads in acupuncture points and trigger points around a joint has been used in the treatment of osteoarthritis in dogs for at least 30 years. Gold bead implants(GBI) acts as continuous acupuncture stimulation and trigger point treatment in canine HD with long lasting results. Electrophysiological investigations of trigger points reveal dysfunctional muscle spindles which indicate that the electrical activity of active loci arises from extrafusal motor endplates. Case: This is a report on the use of acupuncture and GBI for bilateral HD in a nine year old female German Shepherd. The patient has a HD non-responsive to anti-inflammatory drugs and was unable to stand up or walk by its own. Radiographs showed marked dysplasia, significant subluxation with the femoral head partly out of a shallow acetabulum and massive secondary arthritic bone changes, mainly on the right side. The animal was submitted to eight acupuncture sessions with seven days interval. After the first acupuncture session the use of NSAID was interrupted. After eight weeks the dog was considered rehabilitated and underwent GBI in acupoints and trigger points as maintenance treatment. During the one-year follow-up period the improvement remained unchanged with no need of analgesics. Discussion: It has been suggested that acupuncture or GBI can treat the chronic pain resulting from osteoarthritis induced by HD. According to AP theory, GBI is permanent and long-lasting acupoint stimulation. Moreover, the method is inexpensive, quick and easy to perform, with no postoperative pain or need of exercise restriction. Although gold is extremely corrosion-resistant, the surface of the gold implants stimulates a reaction from the immune system causing an oxidative liberation of gold ions with anti-inflammatory actions. It is well known that gold ions are effective inhibitors of the respiratory burst of neutrophils and monocytes and the proliferation of lymphocytes. These findings suggest that gold implantation, on a local scale, mimics the anti-inflammatory and <b>pain-relieving</b> effect of <b>drugs</b> with chemically bound gold ions. The relatively slow speed of the process results in a limited liberation of gold ions securing that they are taken up almost exclusively by cells close to the implant. The nine year old female German shepherd had a positive response to acupuncture with pain relieve and locomotor rehabilitation. For the nine year old female German shepherd previous acupuncture sessions to GBI resulted in no post-implant worsening period. Indeed, the association acupuncture/GBI does not have the anti-inflammatory drugs undesirable effects and brings long lasting results. In conclusion, GBI therefore should be considered for canine HD when conservative or medical treatments fail to give the desired effect...|$|R
