Part II expands on this idea by showing how this can be done while keeping the throughput and the product characteristics unchanged. The outcome is that placing several flashes after the heat exchangers and feeding the corresponding vapour streams to the appropriate trays of the column reduces the pumparound flows and the heat brought to the preheating train. The resulting heat deficit may then be compensated in an additional heat exchanger by using low level heat recuperated from the products of the distillation and/or imported from other processes. The use of this residual heat reduces the furnace duty by approximately an equivalent amount. Thus high level energy (fuel-gas burnt in the furnace) is replaced by residual low level heat. The simulation with an example flowsheet shows that the savings on fuel could be as high as 21 %...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} keep a high level and to stay {{competitive}} in the world market in the future, {{it is important for}} the Swedish steel industry to improve their efficiencies continuously and to reduce the energy consumption. In order to realize these goals, the Swedish steel association Jernkotoret was found and by their initiative Triple Steelix was found in 2006 in Berglanden, a significant area for the steel industry. In 2009, the Clean Production Centre was found in Hofors in order to build a cluster of local steel manufacturers, factories and companies. One of those companies is Gästrike Härdverkstad, a small steal heat treatment industry with six employees and about 700. 000 tons treated materials every year. The aim for this thesis is to suggest solutions for recovering waste heat and lowering the total energy consumption in furnaces for heat treatment in the case of Gästrike Härdverkstad. Some limitations were necessary to complete the analysis and to come to conclusions. The yearly treated material and energy prices were assumed to be constant and the yearly power consumption was estimated by an extrapolation of a one to five days measurement. Gästrike Härdverkstad is located in Uhrfors, the southern part of Åshammar, a village with 727 inhabitants. There are not any buildings with a possibility to supply heat and there is no district heating in the surroundings. The company has a power consumption of 1. 40 GWh/year, of which 65. 7 % is consumed by the 12 main furnaces. The rest is used by eight seldom used furnaces, devices and auxiliary machines of the support process like fans, pumps, compressor, office heating, and some other. The efficiencies of the main furnaces are between 10 % and 20 %. The estimated energy consumption of the space heating is about 27 MWh/year, which completely can be covered by the material coolant and the combustion heat of the exhaust gases from the hardening furnaces. Since there are 10 different types of furnaces with different duties and efficiencies, the <b>preheating</b> <b>furnace</b> was taken as an example and compared with a new furnace. According to the needs of Gästrike Härdverkstad, the furnace VAW 60 / 100 - 650 °C from the company Vötsch was chosen at the cost of 248, 827 SEK. The payback time depends on the efficiency. With an efficiency of 40 % the payback time would be about 13 years, see Figure 20. After the annealing and ageing, the finished products are cooled down in the building hall by the ambient air. In future, the possibility of preheating the material with the heat of the finished products should be considered. With an efficiency of 30. 87 %, one <b>preheating</b> <b>furnace</b> could bereplaced, and taken a payback time of 5 years into account; the price of the construction would be allowed to be up to 253, 200 SEK...|$|E
40|$|Energy {{efficiency}} {{measures have}} become a top priority for large energy consuming companies because of the increasing energy prices and implemented energy policies. Many companies also receive demands from their customers to reduce their climate impact. Heat treatment processes are performed at high temperature, sometimes up to 1000 °C, and the holding time can be up to several hours. A {{large amount of energy}} is needed for these processes and this reflects in a large energy cost for these companies. The purpose of this project was to identify advantageous, both economically and environmentally, energy efficiency improvements in a specific steel heat treatment plant. The first part of the project was to perform an energy audit and map the energy consumption in the plant. When the distribution of the energy consumption had been determined, the largest energy consumers could be identified. The search for energy efficiency opportunities was then focused on the largest energy consumers in the plant. The profitability of the identified energy saving possibilities was evaluated as well as the environmental benefits of the suggestions. The energy audit showed that the major part of the energy was consumed in the process itself and that the largest energy consumer among the support processes is the ventilation system. The hardening and nitrokarburizing furnaces, or the main furnaces, are the largest energy consumers of the process equipment. It was found that 753 MWh/year (7. 7 %) of electricity can be saved by housekeeping measures. The suggested measures were to remove unnecessary lighting, turn off the manual equipment during weekends, plan the production more energy efficiently, search the compressed air system for leaks and close a damper in a <b>preheating</b> <b>furnace.</b> The proposed energy saving investment measures will all together save 418 MWh/year (4. 3 %) of electricity and remove the district heating demand. The suggested investments were to switch the lighting to low energy lamps, insulate the door hoods of the main furnaces, move the intake to the compressor outdoors, heat exchange exhaust furnace gases with washing water and heat exchange the waste heat from the compressor with the heating of the offices. All suggested investment were shown to be profitable, i. e. having a positive net present value. However, the payback periods for the heat exchanging between the compressor and the offices and the low energy lighting may be regarded to be too long as they were more than five years. If all housekeeping measures and all investment measures were implemented, the energy cost for the plant would decrease with almost 1 MSEK/year...|$|E

40|$|Single-walled carbon {{nanotubes}} (SWNTs) {{have been}} intensively studied {{because of their}} many potential applications. However, all known processes for formation of SWNTs involve transition-metal catalysts, residues of which are invariably present in the as-produced SWNT material. To truly realize the full potential of SWNTs, a controlled and scalable multi-step purification method has been developed to remove iron impurities and non-nanotube carbon materials from raw SWNTs produced in the high pressure CO (HiPco) process. Here, iron nanoparticles, coated by carbon, are exposed and oxidized by multiple step oxidation at increasing temperatures. To avoid catalytic oxidation by iron oxide of carbon nanotubes, the exposed and oxidized iron oxide is deactivated by reaction with C 2 H 2 F 4 or SF 6. The iron fluorides are removed by a soxhlet extraction with a 6 M HCl solution. Iron content of approximately 1 wt% with approximately 70 % SWNT yield has been achieved by this method. Furthermore, a hot filament chemical vapor deposition (HFCVD) method has been developed to grow vertically aligned single-walled carbon nanotubes (VA-SWNTs). Silicon substrates decorated with islands of iron were rapidly inserted into a <b>preheated</b> <b>furnace</b> in which a hot filament (temperature greater than 2000 °C) is activating the gas. Characterization of VA-SWNTs by using Raman spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy, scanning electron microscope (SEM) and transmission electron microscope (TEM) clearly shows that the VA-SWNTs have diameters ranging from 0. 78 to 1. 6 nm. Finally, HFCVD method {{has been used to}} investigate the effect of atomic hydrogen on the growth of VA-SWNTs. It is obvious that rapid heating of the substrate in the presence of atomic hydrogen facilitates the nucleation and growth of SWNTs before the aggregation of catalyst occurs. By comparing the Raman shifts of SWNTs synthesized from a mixture of isotopic methane (13 CH 4) and normal acetylene (12 C 2 H 2), we found that SWNT growth occurs with addition of acetylene and ethylene that are formed by methane decomposition on the hot filament...|$|R
30|$|Carbon (C), {{hydrogen}} (H), nitrogen (N) and sulphur (S) {{contents and}} oxygen (O) {{is determined by}} the difference using elemental analyser Elementar from Perkin-Elmer for elemental analysis. Gases resulting from combustion of sample in pure oxygen are measured by the instrument to find the content of the elements as per cent. Bomb calorimeter is used to determine the heating values [24]. Proximate analysis is performed according to the standard methods [25] which involve the determination of ash [26], fixed carbon, moisture [27] and volatile matter [28]. Upon drying the sample in an oven for 3 – 4  h at a temperature 103  ±  1 °C, the moisture is determined by weight difference. Percentage of volatile matter is determines by the loss in weight of sample, when ignited in <b>preheated</b> muffle <b>furnace</b> at 950  ±  20 °C. Finally, the fixed carbon is determined by adding the percentage values of ash, moisture and volatile matter and the sum is subtracted from 100.|$|R
40|$|Today, much {{interest}} {{is given to}} the utilisation of materials of plant origin as substitutions of fossil fuels in meeting energy needs to reduce the level of atmospheric pollutant emissions and global warming threat, and emphasis has been placed on the co-combustion of coal and biomass. In this study, volatiles and char combustion behaviour of the fuel pellets composed from demineralised lignite and poplar wood sawdust, were investigated in a cylindrical wire mesh basket placed in a <b>preheated</b> tube <b>furnace.</b> The results have shown that ignition times of the pellets decreased with the burning temperature and shortened further due to demineralisation of lignite. Volatiles combustion rates of the samples did not correlate well with combustion times. However, they can be correlated with their respective proximate volatile matter contents. Char burnout times decreased with increasing combustion rates and correlated well with the respective proximate fixed carbon contents of the samples. Deviations were more considerable in the case of rate data. Co-combustion Lignite Poplar wood Volatiles combustion Char combustion...|$|R
40|$|In 2002 the {{commissioning}} of an ilmenite smelter on the North Coast of South Africa {{was extended}} by three months {{due to the}} failure and subsequent replacement of the magnesia-based refractory lining. The lining failed due to the hydration of magnesia caused by an unexpected source of water. The incident resulted in significant financial losses and a prolonged insurance claim which was settled in 2009. As magnesia-based refractories are used extensively in both ferrous and non-ferrous applications, {{the authors of the}} paper want to share the experience gained from this incident with others. The paper reviews the literature available on furnace start-up practices and explains the hydration of magnesia using available sources. The incident is studied in more detail, both technically and economically, and the costs incurred are quantified in terms {{of the cost of the}} original lining. The paper concludes with lessons learned and recommendations made for future work. The intention of the paper is to stimulate open debate regarding best practices in <b>preheating</b> of <b>furnaces</b> lined primarily with magnesia. [URL]...|$|R
50|$|The process starts by {{charging}} solid sinter and heated coke {{into the top}} of the blast <b>furnace.</b> <b>Preheated</b> air at 190 to 1050 C is blown {{into the bottom of the}} furnace. Zinc vapour and sulfides leave through the top and enter the condenser. Slag and lead collect at the bottom of the furnace and are tapped off regularly. The zinc is scrubbed from the vapour in the condenser via liquid lead. The liquid zinc is separated from the lead in the cooling circuit. Approximately 5000 MT of lead are required each year for this process, however this process recovers 25% more lead from the starting ores than other processes.|$|R
