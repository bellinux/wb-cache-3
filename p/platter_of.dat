25|$|Jatin {{was born}} to Sharatshashi and Umeshchandra Mukherjee in Kayagram, a village in the Kushtia {{subdivision}} of Nadia district {{in what is now}} Bangladesh. He grew up in his ancestral home at Sadhuhati, P.S. Rishkhali Jhenaidah until his father's death when Jatin was five years old. Well versed in Brahmanic studies, his father liked horses and was respected for the strength of his character. Sharatshashi settled in her parents' home in Kayagram with her husband and his elder sister Benodebala (or Vinodebala). A gifted poet, she was affectionate and stern in her method of raising her children. Familiar with the essays by contemporary thought leaders like Bankimchandra Chatterjee and Yogendra Vidyabhushan, she was aware of the social and political transformations of her times. Her brother Basanta Kumar Chattopadhyay (father of Indian revolutionary and politician Haripada Chattopadhyay) taught and practised law, and counted among his clients the poet Rabindranath Tagore. Since the age of 14, Tagore had claimed in meetings organised by his family members equal rights for Indian citizens inside railway carriages and in public places. As Jatin grew older, he gained a reputation for physical bravery and great strength; charitable and cheerful by nature, he was fond of caricature and enacting mythological plays, himself playing the roles of god-loving characters like Prahlad, Dhruva, Hanuman, Râja Harish Chandra. He not only encouraged several playwrights to produce patriotic pieces for the urban stage, but also engaged village bards to spread nationalist fervour in the countryside. Jatin had a natural respect for the human creature, heedless of class or caste or religions. He carried for an aged Muslim villager a heavy bundle of fodder and, on reaching her hut, he shared with her the only <b>platter</b> <b>of</b> rice she had, and sent her some money every month.|$|E
500|$|In 2003, Lim Juan of The Star {{speculated that}} the revised P2 looked [...] "a lot less {{substantial}} than its ancestor", because of cost-cutting. Whilst the <b>platter</b> <b>of</b> the costlier Rega decks, P3 and P25, continued to be of glass, reviewers derided the fibreboard <b>platter</b> <b>of</b> the P2 as [...] "not inspiring much confidence". The plinth, which the Rega website described as a low mass particulate core sandwiched by highly rigid phenolic laminates, [...] "looks like any plain cheap medite board", according to Lim. The badly-toleranced medite platter proved unpopular with prospective buyers so Rega reverted to glass platters for a while, until the P2 was discontinued in 2005.|$|E

2500|$|Duncan Hines, an American entrepreneur, often enjoyed ham {{and eggs}} as a supper meal. He {{said that people}} should choose ham and eggs as a meal at a diner when {{uncertain}} about what to order, because cooks cannot [...] "disguise a bad egg nor spoil a slice of good ham." [...] According to his own account, on one occasion in 1899, Hines ordered five dollars' worth of ham and eggs at Harry Hynd's Restaurant in Cheyenne, Wyoming, a very large amount of food (according to U.S. government statistics, $5 in 1899 {{was the equivalent of}} $143.60 in 2015 dollars). Hines had had hardly anything to eat for four days, having had to walk about [...] to Cheyenne after his horse gave out. About two miles into his hike, he had been given a few scraps of food by a hermit, after which he continued to Cheyenne, with five inches of snow on the ground. The counter person initially refused the order, saying that {{it would be impossible to}} finish it, but Hines was eventually provided with a large <b>platter</b> <b>of</b> ham and eggs and ate it all. Years later he wrote that nothing else had tasted as good as that <b>platter</b> <b>of</b> ham and eggs at that time.|$|E
