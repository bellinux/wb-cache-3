The mission is designed to carry out similar studies to that of LAGEOS 2 but with much greater precision.|$|E
50|$|There are {{two major}} classes of {{communications}} <b>satellites,</b> <b>passive</b> and active. <b>Passive</b> <b>satellites</b> only reflect the signal coming from the source, toward {{the direction of the}} receiver. With <b>passive</b> <b>satellites,</b> the reflected signal is not amplified at the satellite, and only a very small amount of the transmitted energy actually reaches the receiver. Since the satellite is so far above Earth, the radio signal is attenuated due to free-space path loss, so the signal received on Earth is very, very weak. Active satellites, on the other hand, amplify the received signal before retransmitting it to the receiver on the ground. <b>Passive</b> <b>satellites</b> were the first communications satellites, but are little used now.Telstar was the second active, direct relay communications satellite. Belonging to AT&T as part of a multi-national agreement between AT&T, Bell Telephone Laboratories, NASA, the British General Post Office, and the French National PTT (Post Office) to develop satellite communications, it was launched by NASA from Cape Canaveral on July 10, 1962, in the first privately sponsored space launch. Relay 1 was launched on December 13, 1962, and it became the first satellite to transmit across the Pacific Ocean on November 22, 1963.|$|R

The first US system, Minitrack, was already in existence {{at the time of}} the Sputnik launch, but the US quickly discovered that Minitrack could not reliably detect and track satellites. The US Navy designed Minitrack to track the Vanguard satellite, and so long as satellites followed the international agreement on satellite transmitting frequencies, Minitrack could track any satellite. However, the Soviets chose not to use the international satellite frequencies. Thus, a major limitation of this system became visible.

The sphere is engraved with a map of Earth and surrounded by an aluminium layer, a thermal layer and several layers of titanium and other heavy materials intertwined with vacuum.

As the satellite enters the atmosphere, the thermal layer will produce an artificial aurora to give a signal of the satellite's re-entry. The <b>passive</b> <b>satellite</b> will not carry any communications or propulsion systems.
