50|$|The apadravya, {{like the}} ampallang, is a {{piercing}} that <b>passes</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> glans. While <b>the</b> ampallang <b>passes</b> horizontally <b>through</b> <b>the</b> glans, <b>the</b> apadravya <b>passes</b> vertically <b>through</b> <b>the</b> glans {{from top to}} bottom, almost always placed centrally and <b>passing</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> urethra. Off-center apadravyas are also possible, wherein the piercing is deliberately offset, yet usually still <b>passes</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> urethra. The piercing is often done on a slightly forward angle to the hips.|$|R

5|$|According to Transport for London (TfL), {{the station}} is at {{capacity}} {{because of the large}} number of passengers leaving and entering the station, as well as the large numbers of passengers changing between lines. Currently, everyone who uses the station has to <b>pass</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> intermediate concourse {{at the bottom of the}} main escalators. This causes congestion and delays.|$|E
5|$|Although Captain Apolinar Calvo of the Corregidor {{had prior}} {{experience}} navigating the mined entrance to Manila Bay (the mines {{had been in}} place since July), the Navy had changed its procedures on that day. Rather than post a gunboat near the safe channel as they had in days previous, lighted buoys were used to guide boats through. As the Corregidor sailed close to the island of Corregidor to <b>pass</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> channel at around 01:00, the ship was observed turning toward the electrically-controlled minefield. Some officers posted at the Army's Seaward Defense Command headquarters on the island recommended that the mines be temporarily disarmed so that the ship could <b>pass</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> minefield. A number of accounts state that Seaward Defense Commander Colonel Paul Bunker ordered that the mines be kept active.|$|E

5|$|August 23, 2000– The National Hurricane Center {{forecasts}} Hurricane Debby to <b>pass</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> Florida Keys as a Category 2 hurricane, {{with one}} computer model predicting a Category4 hurricane in the area. This results in officials declaring a mandatory evacuation for all non-residents in the keys, causing a significant loss of tourism revenue for Monroe County. Debby dissipates {{before hitting the}} area, though its remnants produce heavy rainfall across southern Florida.|$|E
5|$|Birmingham is a snowy city {{relative}} to other large UK conurbations, due to its inland location and comparatively high elevation. Between 1961 and 1990 Birmingham Airport averaged 13.0 days of snow lying annually, compared to 5.33 at London Heathrow. Snow showers often <b>pass</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> city via the Cheshire gap on north westerly airstreams, but can also come off the North Sea from north easterly airstreams.|$|E

The Koota railway station is to the south of the town.|$|R
5|$|Early in its life, Debby was {{forecast}} to <b>pass</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> southern Cape Verde islands as {{a tropical}} storm, potentially causing life-threatening flooding. Most computer models consistently predicted Debby to track {{to the northwest}} throughout its lifetime, though intensity was more problematic for forecasters. The National Hurricane Center continually predicted Debby to intensify to hurricane status, though strong vertical shear ultimately prevented the storm from becoming a hurricane.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, {{one morning}} {{northbound}} CrossCountry service {{would make a}} stop at Nailsea and Backwell {{to serve as a}} morning peak service, but this operation has ceased. CrossCountry services still <b>pass</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> station, but do not stop.

5|$|Initial {{predictions}} {{suggested that}} the cyclone would <b>pass</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> Hawaiian Islands as a tropical storm; however, Daniel's remnants dissipated southeast of Hawaii.
