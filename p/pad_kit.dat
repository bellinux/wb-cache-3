50|$|The 5L, 6L; and 3100 and 3150 all had {{an issue}} with {{multiple}} paper-feed jams which was resolved via class action lawsuit, the remedy of which was to freely supply an easily insertable replacement pad. The free supply of the Replaceable Separation <b>Pad</b> <b>Kit</b> has since expired {{but they can be}} found on eBay.|$|E

50|$|The SisterPADS {{program run}} by Sister Namibia is {{committed}} to bringing agency and mobility to menstruating school girls and women by providing re-usable pads. The project was created in part to overcome the problem in Namibia where girls miss {{an average of three}} school days every month due to lack of menstrual pads. Sister Namibia believes that no girl should have to stay home because she can’t afford pads. SisterPADS are made of cotton and waterproof polyurethane laminate material and are manufactured in the United States. The material is not only reusable, but soft, stretchy, flexible, and durable. A representative from Sister Namibia says: “they have no reports of discomfort or allergies.” Some of the girls in the SisterPADS program who previously used pillow stuffing and other materials prior to the implementation of the program are now attending school and engage in social activities without fear of embarrassment. SisterPADS has provided menstrual <b>pad</b> <b>kits</b> to approximately seven hundred and sixty girls in Namibia through donations and support across the globe and is anticipating to expand their reach.|$|R
50|$|The table {{shows the}} {{configuration}} of the original (discontinued, but still available) Philips gaming kits (large installed user base). These kits come with speakers integrated into each satellite light. Although each wallwasher (rear lights) supports a maximum of two satellite lights, two fans, and one rumble <b>pad,</b> several <b>kits</b> may be used on a single PC to create a larger setup. Wallwashers may be used independently of all other peripherals, but are required for all AmBX applications via Philips kits.|$|R
40|$|Protein citrullination catalyzed by peptidyl {{arginine}} deiminase (PADs) {{is involved}} in autoimmune disease pathogenesis, especially in rheumatoid arthritis. Calcium is a key regulator of PAD activity, but under normal physiological conditions it remains uncertain how intracellular calcium levels can be raised to sufficiently high levels to activate these enzymes. In pursuit of trying to identify other factors that influence PAD activity, we identified bicarbonate as a potential regulator of PAD activity. We demonstrate that physiological levels of bicarbonate upregulate citrullination by recombinant PAD 2 / 4 and endogenous PADs in neutrophils. The impact of bicarbonate is independent of calcium and pH. Adding bicarbonate to commercial <b>PAD</b> activity <b>kits</b> could increase assay performance and biological relevance. These results suggest that citrullination activity is regulated by multiple factors including calcium and bicarbonate. We also provide commentary on the current understanding of PAD regulation and future perspective of research in this area...|$|R
50|$|Simmons {{began to}} expand their product line with smaller <b>kits</b> and <b>pads,</b> {{including}} the SDS-1, which was a single pad with a built-in EPROM reader for playing a single drum sound sample, and the all-analog SDS-200 (2 tom system), SDS-400 (4 tom system), and SDS-800 (bass, snare, and 2 tom system). These products were aimed at acoustic drummers who wanted to add a couple of Simmons <b>pads</b> to their <b>kit</b> on a budget. Some of these products also feature the run generator, which allows drummers to play a descending drum roll with a single pad hit.|$|R
40|$|Great {{attention}} has been paid recently to the capabilities of computers to provide environments in which active learners can construct their own understanding through open-ended interaction. Yet discussion of constructivist learning environments has commonly focused on the learner as an individual, learning in isolation from other learners. For example, Perkins (1991) characterizes a learning environment as being composed of five facets: information banks, symbol <b>pads,</b> construction <b>kits,</b> phenomenaria, and task managers. Each of these is a valuable resource for an individual learner but none provides a means for a learner to interact with, influence, or be influenced by other learners. In our research, we start with a constructivist belief in the importance of an active learner interacting with a variety of resources, developing his or her own understanding through a mixture of experimentation, experience, and expert guidance. However, we supplement this constructivist outlook with a sociocultural commitment to the importance of communication and collaboration with other learners throughout the knowledge construction process. In this chapter, we describe a learning environment that we have developed that combines constructivist-inspired tools for open-ended investigation with communication and collaboration tools that support both expert guidance and multi-learner collaboration. We begin by presenting our rationale for this approach...|$|R
