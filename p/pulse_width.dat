5|$|The minimum {{range of}} any radar system {{is due to}} its <b>pulse</b> <b>width,</b> {{the length of time}} that the {{transmitter}} is turned on before it turns off so the receiver can listen for reflections from targets. If the echo from the target is received while the transmitter is still sending, the echo will be swamped by the transmitted pulse backscattering off local sources. For instance, a radar with a <b>pulse</b> <b>width</b> of 1µs {{would not be able to}} see returns from a target less than 150m away, because the radar signal travelling at the speed of light would cover the round trip distance of 300m before that 1µs interval had passed.|$|E
5|$|In {{the case}} of ASV {{this was not a}} problem; {{aircraft}} would not approach a ship on the surface more closely than its altitude of perhaps a few thousand feet, so a longer <b>pulse</b> <b>width</b> was fine. But in the AI role, the minimum range was pre-defined by the pilot's eyesight, at 300m or less for night interception, which demanded sub-microsecond pulse widths. This proved very difficult to arrange, and ranges under 1,000feet were difficult to produce.|$|E
25|$|Following the pulse, the nuclei are, on average, {{excited to}} a certain angle vs. the {{spectrometer}} magnetic field. The extent of excitation can be controlled with the <b>pulse</b> <b>width,</b> typically ca. 3-8 µs for the optimal 90° pulse. The <b>pulse</b> <b>width</b> can be determined by plotting the (signed) intensity {{as a function of}} <b>pulse</b> <b>width.</b> It follows a sine curve, and accordingly, changes sign at pulse widths corresponding to 180° and 360° pulses.|$|E

It is shown that high-power <b>pulses</b> with <b>pulse</b> <b>widths</b> as short as 1 ns can be generated with PTM Q-switched in LD-pumped Nd:YAG lasers.

40|$|The {{attitude}} control thrusters on the Voyager spacecraft were tested for operation at electrical <b>pulse</b> <b>widths</b> {{of less than}} the current 10 -millisecond minimum to reduce impulse bit and, therefore, reduce image smear of pictures taken during the Uranus encounter. Thrusters with the identical configuration of the units on the spacecraft were fired in an altitude chamber to characterize impulse bit and impulse bit variations {{as a function of}} electrical <b>pulse</b> <b>widths</b> and to determine if the short pulses decreased thruster life. <b>Pulse</b> <b>widths</b> of 4. 0 milliseconds provide approximately 45 percent of the impulse provided by a 10 -ms pulse, and thruster-to-thruster and pulse-to-pulse variation is approximately plus or minus 10 percent. <b>Pulse</b> <b>widths</b> shorter than 4 ms showed wide variation, and no pulse was obtained at 3 ms. Three thrusters were each subjected to 75, 000 short pulses of 4 ms or less without performance degradation. A fourth thruster exhibited partial flow blockage after 13, 000 short pulses, but this was attributed to prevous test history and not short pulse exposure. The Voyager {{attitude control}} thrusters should be considered flight qualified for short pulse operation at <b>pulse</b> <b>widths</b> of 4. 0 ms or more...|$|R
40|$|The {{characteristics}} of pulse compression during the laser pulse amplification using a counter-propagating pump and plasmas {{have been investigated}} using a one-dimensional fluid model of stimulated Raman backscattering. The <b>pulse</b> <b>widths</b> of the amplified laser at {{the front and rear}} half are examined in terms of the initial amplitudes of the pump and the seed, and the ratio of the electron plasma frequency to the laser frequency. The <b>pulse</b> <b>widths</b> have a common scaling behaviour in time over the considered parameter regime.

An ExAblate&# 8482; 4000 HIFU headsystem (InSightec, Inc., Israel) was used. Artificial blood clots were placed into test tubes inside a human calvarium and exposed to pulsatile flow. Four different duty cycles were tested against four different <b>pulse</b> <b>widths.</b> For all study groups, an increase in thrombolysis efficacy {{could be seen in}} association with increasing DC and/or PW (p&# 8201;<&# 8201; 0. 0001). Using transcranial HIFU, significant thrombolysis can be achieved within seconds and without the use of lytic drugs in vitro.

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the {{synthesis}} of band-limited functions that are generated by properly low-pass filtering a sequence of equally-spaced width-modulated unit-height pulses; simply choosing the <b>pulse</b> <b>widths</b> proportional to the corresponding sample values of the band-limited function to be generated, would result in an error. The exact relationship between the <b>pulse</b> <b>widths</b> and the corresponding sample values of the band-limited function to be synthesized, is derived. Error reduction {{can be achieved by}} using this relationship to calculate the <b>pulse</b> <b>widths</b> from the required sample values; in principle, a band-limited function can thus be realised to any degree of accuracy. It is shown which amount of error reduction can be obtained, when {{only a limited number of}} terms of the exact relationship is taken into account. The application to computer-generated half-tone transparencies is described...|$|R
25|$|The gate pulses are {{characterized}} {{in terms of}} gate trigger voltage (VGT) and gate trigger current (IGT).

25|$|The Mk. II also {{included}} a new transmitter, which had increased in power three times from 50 to 150kW. This extra power offered somewhat better range, but more importantly it allowed the <b>pulse</b> <b>width</b> to be significantly reduced while offering the same range. The sharpness of the echo {{is a function of}} the <b>pulse</b> <b>width,</b> so by reducing it the system became more accurate. The Mk. II could offer bearing measurements as accurate as ½ degree, about twice as accurate as the Mk. I*, and just within the range needed to directly aim the guns. The Mk. II had largely replaced the Mk. I* by mid-1942 and remained in service until 1943. An analysis demonstrated that the Mk. II improved the rounds-per-kill to 2,750, another significant advance. 1,679 GL Mark II sets were produced between June 1940 and August 1943.|$|E
25|$|To {{measure the}} delay, the {{receiver}} compares the bit sequence {{received from the}} satellite with an internally generated version. By comparing the rising and trailing edges of the bit transitions, modern electronics can measure signal offset to within about one percent of a bit <b>pulse</b> <b>width,</b> , or approximately 10 nanoseconds for the C/A code. Since GPS signals propagate {{at the speed of}} light, this represents an error of about 3 meters.|$|E

Tight capacitance tolerances are required for timing applications in signal lights or <b>pulse</b> <b>width</b> generators to control the speed of motors, PP film capacitors are also well-suited because of their very low leakage current.|$|E
25|$|Early {{automobile}} {{generators and}} alternators had a mechanical voltage regulator using one, two, or three relays and various resistors {{to stabilize the}} generator's output at slightly more than 6 or 12 V, independent of the engine's rpm or the varying load on the vehicle's electrical system. Essentially, the relay(s) employed <b>pulse</b> <b>width</b> modulation to regulate {{the output of the}} generator, controlling the field current reaching the generator (or alternator) and in this way controlling the output voltage producing back into the generator and attempting to run it as a motor. The rectifier diodes in an alternator automatically perform this function so that a specific relay is not required; this appreciably simplified the regulator design.|$|E
25|$|Since neutrinos {{could not}} be {{accurately}} tracked to the specific protons producing them, an averaging method had to be used. The researchers added up the measured proton pulses to get an average distribution in time of the individual protons in a pulse. The time at which neutrinos were detected at Gran Sasso was plotted to produce another distribution. The two distributions were expected to have similar shapes, but be separated by 2.4milliseconds, {{the time it takes}} to travel the distance at light speed. The experimenters used an algorithm, maximum likelihood, to search for the time shift that best made the two distributions to coincide. The shift so calculated, the statistically measured neutrino arrival time, was approximately 60nanoseconds shorter than the 2.4milliseconds neutrinos would have taken if they traveled just at light speed. In a later experiment, the proton <b>pulse</b> <b>width</b> was shortened to 3nanoseconds, and this helped the scientists to narrow the generation time of each detected neutrino to that range.|$|E
