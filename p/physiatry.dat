50|$|Sport and {{exercise}} medicine doctors are specialist physicians who have completed medical school, appropriate residency training and then specialize further in sports medicine or 'sports {{and exercise}} medicine' (the preferred term). Specialization in sports medicine {{may be a}} doctor's first specialty (as in Australia, Netherlands, Norway, Italy). It {{may also be a}} sub-specialty or second specialisation following a specialisation such as <b>physiatry</b> or orthopedic surgery. The various approaches reflect the medical culture in different countries.|$|E
50|$|Cutaneous, or skin reflexes, are {{activated}} by skin receptors {{and play a}} valuable role in locomotion, providing quick responses to unexpected environmental challenges. They {{have been shown to}} be important in responses to obstacles or stumbling, in preparing for visually challenging terrain, and for assistance in making adjustments when instability is introduced. In addition to the role in normal locomotion, cutaneous reflexes are being studied for their potential in enhancing rehabilitation therapy (<b>physiatry)</b> for people with gait abnormalities.|$|E
5000|$|International Members - An International {{member is}} a {{physician}} legally qualified to practice medicine in his/her country of residence, with {{training and experience}} comparable to Diplomates of the ABPMR.

International members enjoy all of the privileges of membership except voting and holding office.|$|E
5000|$|Physical {{medicine}} and rehabilitation (PM&R), {{also known as}} <b>physiatry</b> [...] or rehabilitation medicine, or physical and rehabilitation medicine (PRM) outside of the United States, is a branch of medicine that aims to enhance and restore functional ability {{and quality of life}} to those with physical impairments or disabilities. A physician having completed training in this field is referred to as a physiatrist. Physiatrists specialize in restoring optimal function to people with injuries to the muscles, bones, ligaments, or nervous system.|$|E
50|$|The AAP Newsletter {{began in}} 1982 {{as a tool}} to provide {{academic}} physiatrists with information regarding the availability of clinical and research fellowships and research grants and contracts for projects relating directly or indirectly to Rehabilitation Medicine. In 1983, the AAP Board of Trustees authorized up to 4 editions of the Newsletter per year. Over the years, the information has expanded to include all material relevant to the field of PM&R to accomplish the AAP's mission of providing a forum to inform and stimulate discussion regarding relevant issues pertaining to academic <b>physiatry</b> and the AAP itself.|$|E
50|$|The International Association for the Study of Pain advocates {{that the}} relief of pain should be {{recognized}} as a human right, that chronic pain should be considered a disease in its own right, and that pain medicine should have the full status of a specialty. It is a specialty only in China and Australia at this time. Elsewhere, pain medicine is a subspecialty under disciplines such as anesthesiology, <b>physiatry,</b> neurology, palliative medicine and psychiatry. In 2011, Human Rights Watch alerted that {{tens of millions of people}} worldwide are still denied access to inexpensive medications for severe pain.|$|E
50|$|U.S. News & World Report made a {{directory}} of top physicians around the United States. UI Hospitals and Clinics had 126 Adult Specialists nominated {{by their peers}} -doctors nominating doctors- within these specialties:Allergy and Immunology, Cardiac electrophysiology, Colon and Rectal Surgery (colorectal surgery), Critical Care Medicine, Dermatology, Diagnostic Radiology, Endocrinology, Family Medicine, Gastroenterology, Geriatric Medicine, Gynelogic Oncology, Hematology, Internist, Medical Oncology, Infectious Disease, Internal Medicine, Medical Oncology and Hematology, Nephrology, Neurological Surgery (neurosurgery), Neurology, Nuclear Medicine, Obstetrics and Gynecology, Ophthalmology, Orthopedic Surgery, Pathology, Perinatology, <b>Physiatry,</b> Psychiatry, Pulmonary Medicine, Radiation Oncology, Reproductive Endocrinology (fertility medicine), Rheumatology, Surgery, Thoracic and Cardiac Surgery (cardiothoracic surgery), Urology, and Vascular Surgery.|$|E
50|$|Behavioral {{medicine}} is an interdisciplinary field combining both medicine and psychology and {{is concerned with}} the integration of knowledge in the biological, behavioral, psychological, and social sciences relevant to health and illness. These sciences include epidemiology, anthropology, sociology, psychology, physiology, pharmacology, nutrition, neuroanatomy, endocrinology, and immunology. The term is often used interchangeably, but incorrectly, with health psychology.. The practice of behavioral medicine encompasses health psychology, but also includes applied psychophysiological therapies such as biofeedback, hypnosis, and bio-behavioral therapy of physical disorders, aspects of occupational therapy, rehabilitation medicine, and <b>physiatry,</b> as well as preventive medicine. In contrast, health psychology represents a stronger emphasis specifically on psychology's role in both behavioral medicine and behavioral health.|$|E
50|$|Radiculopathy is a {{diagnosis}} commonly made by physicians {{in primary care}} specialities, Chiropractic, orthopedics, <b>physiatry,</b> and neurology. The diagnosis may be suggested by symptoms of pain, numbness, and weakness in a pattern consistent with the distribution of a particular nerve root. Neck pain or back pain may also be present. Physical examination may reveal motor and sensory deficits {{in the distribution of}} a nerve root. In the case of cervical radiculopathy, Spurling's test may elicit or reproduce symptoms radiating down the arm. In the case of lumbosacral radiculopathy, a Straight leg raise maneuver may exacerbate radiculopathic symptoms. Deep tendon reflexes (also known as a Stretch reflex) may be diminished or absent in areas innervated by a particular nerve root.|$|E
50|$|Kuczborski {{obtained}} {{his high}} school diploma in 1930, at the Mikołaj Kopernik Boys’ High School in Łódź. In 1930 he began his studies at the Medical Department of the Warsaw University. As a student, he contracted tuberculosis and was referred to Warsaw University's Sanatorium in Zakopane. This experience caused him to focus his medical studies. After he finished a one-year postgraduate internship in Warsaw hospitals, he worked in a sanatorium in Otwock, near Warsaw. There he expanded {{work in the field}} of internal medicine, particularly Physical medicine and rehabilitation (PM&R), or <b>physiatry.</b> He spent the years during the Nazi occupation in the sanatorium. After World War II, he returned to his home city of Łódź. In 1951, he received his PhD from the Medical University of Silesia.|$|E
5000|$|Government Institute of Rehabilitation Medicine {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} {{rehabilitation}} centers in India [...] This is the second institute in India which was started in the year 1959, after the King Edward Memorial Hospital, Mumbai. It {{is one of the}} Institute of Madras Medical College, it found its current own place away from Madras Medical College at Ashok Nagar, Chennai, Tamil Nadu. The institute includes a hospital, headed by a director who is a Physiatrist, chief of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation Department's Post Graduate Medical Courses. GIRM conducts 3 year MD(PMR), and 2 year Diploma in Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (<b>PHYSIATRY</b> otherwise called PMR) courses for medical (Post MBBS) graduates. Institute also hosts allied Health Science Courses and has College of Physiotherapy, School of Orthotics and Prosthetics and Artificial Limb center. GIRM was a Regional Rehabilitation and Training Center under Ministry of Health, India.|$|E
50|$|In the United Kingdom and Ireland, {{neurology}} is a subspecialty {{of general}} (internal) medicine. After five to {{nine years of}} medical school and {{a year as a}} pre-registration house officer (or two years on the Foundation Programme), a neurologist must pass the examination for Membership of the Royal College of Physicians (or the Irish equivalent) before completing two years of core medical training and then entering specialist training in neurology. A generation ago, some neurologists would have also spent a couple of years working in psychiatric units and obtain a Diploma in Psychological Medicine. However, this requirement has become uncommon, and, now that a basic psychiatric qualification takes three years to obtain, the requirement is no longer practical. A period of research is essential, and obtaining a higher degree aids career progression: Many found it was eased after an attachment to the Institute of Neurology at Queen Square, London. Some neurologists enter the field of rehabilitation medicine (known as <b>physiatry</b> in the US) to specialise in neurological rehabilitation, which may include stroke medicine as well as brain injuries.|$|E

40|$|Based on the {{experience}} of 2 physicians from <b>physiatry</b> and developmental pediatrics, this article proposes a framework for improving care and outcomes for children with spina bifida. The combined skills of physiatrists and developmental pediatricians, along with other disciplines, can form the ideal team to manage the complex issues faced by this population. The developmental pediatrician is best suited for directing care for younger children through the elementary and middle school years, during which time behavioral and educational issues are prominent. As the child assumes more responsibility for self-management in adolescence, the physiatrist is ideally suited to provide major clinical input that improves functional outcomes. The addition of the discipline of <b>physiatry</b> to traditional, developmentally oriented pediatric interdisciplinary teams can add the much needed dimensions of activity and participation, and improve functional outcomes at the adult level by encouraging activities in adolescence that lead to full participation in adulthood. © 2010...|$|E
40|$|There are {{numerous}} multidisciplinary spina bifida (SB) clinics (typically including urology, orthopedics, neurosurgery, developmental pediatrics, <b>physiatry,</b> nursing, social work, and physical and occupational therapy) throughout the U. S. Many SB clinics have a nurse coordinator. The coordinator's role is truly multifaceted. It {{goes far beyond}} coordinating the clinic visit in which patients and families are seen for care. The frequency of clinical visits varies from program to program, from a few hours once a month to a full day every week.

This will be done by using two case reports of patients who have typical temporoman-dibular joint (TMJ) dysfunction syndrome. Within the last several years, TMJ dysfunction syndrome has received attention from many medical disciplines. Be-cause of the increased knowledge about its existence and treatment, numerous allied professionals have become in-volved with its management and have contributed greatly to the efficacy of treatment. Included among these medical specialties are periodontics, orthodontics, prosthodontics, oral and maxilla facial surgery, orthopedics, neurology, <b>physiatry,</b> otolaryngology, and physical therapy.

40|$|The {{progressive}} {{aging of the}} U. S. population presents anunprecedented demographic challenge to our health care system. To address this imperative, gerontology (the study of aging) and geriatrics (the health and social care of the elderly) must become embedded into medical educa-tion at all levels, especially the postgraduate training of all residents and fellows (except perhaps pediatricians). Fur-thermore, since the needs of elderly patients are typically chronic, progressive, and complex and the care of these patients is quintessentially multidisciplinary, communica-tion and collaboration among specialists must be a cardinal feature of effective geriatric care. In this picture {{of the world of}} geriatric care, general internal medicine and fam-ily practice will share the leading role in primary care, skillfully orchestrating contributions from all of the medi-cal subspecialties, neurology, psychiatry, <b>physiatry,</b> an...|$|E
