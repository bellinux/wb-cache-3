25|$|Splitter: A {{splitter}} or {{riving knife}} is a vertical projection located behind the saw blade. This {{can be a}} pin or a fin. It is slightly narrower in width than the blade and located directly {{in line with the}} blade. The splitter prevents the material being cut from being rotated thereby helping to prevent kickback. Splitters may incorporate <b>pawls,</b> a <b>mechanism</b> with teeth designed to bite into wood and preventing kickback. Splitters can take many forms, including being part of the blade guard that comes standard with the saw. Another type of splitter is simply a vertical pin or fin attached to an insert. Splitters are available commercially or can be made from wood, metal or plastic.|$|R

Belted ammunition is introduced into the feed tray port from the left side, while the magazine is inserted vertically into the magazine well {{at the base of the}} receiver.

The non-reciprocating charging handle is located on the right side of the weapon.|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} planning and predicting the motion of a flexible object amidst obstacles in the plane. We model the flexible object as a rigid "root" body, attached to compliant members by torsional springs. The root's position may be controlled, but the compliant members move in response to forces from contact with the environment. Such a model encompasses several important and complicated mechanisms in mechanical design and automated assembly: snap-fasteners, latches, ratchet and <b>pawl</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> and escapements. The problem is to predict the motion of such a mechanism amidst fixed obstacles. For example, our algorithm {{could be used to}} determine whether a snap-fastener design can be assembled with a certain plan. In this paper, we analyze the physics of these flexible devices, and develop combinatorially precise algorithms for predicting their movement under a motion plan. Our algorithms determine when and where the motion will terminate, and also computes the time-history of contacts and mating forces. In addition to providing the first known exact algorithm that addresses flexibility in motion planning, we also note that our approach to compliance permits an exact algorithm for predicting motions under rotational compliance, which was not possible in earlier work. We discuss the following issues: the relevance of our approach to engineering (which we illustrate through the examples we ran using our system), the computational methods employed, the algebraic techniques for predicting motions in contact with rotational compliance, and issues of robustness and stability of our geometric and algebraic algorithms. Our computational viewpoint lies in the interface between differential theories of mechanics, and combinatorial collision detection algorithms. From this viewpoint, subtle mathematical difficulties arise in predicting motions under rotational compliance, such as the forced non-genericity of the intersection problems encountered in configuration space. We discuss these problems and their solutions. Finally, we extend our work to predict the forces on the manipulated objects as a function of time, and show how our algorithm can easily be extended to include uncertainty in control and initial conditions. With these extensions, we hope that our system could be used to analyze and design objects that are easy to assemble, even given control and sensing errors, and that require more force to disassemble than to mate...|$|R

2500|$|The Baitcasting reel or revolving-spool reel, {{like the}} {{conventional}} reel, is a multiplying reel – {{that is to}} say that the line is stored on a bearing-supported revolving spool that is geared so that a single revolution of the crank handle results in multiple revolutions of the spool. [...] The bait casting reel is mounted above the rod, hence its other name given to it in New Zealand and Australia, the overhead reel. [...] The baitcasting reel dates from at least the mid-17th century, but came into wide use by amateur anglers during the 1870s. [...] Early bait casting reels were often constructed with brass or iron gears, with casings and spools made of brass, German silver, or hard rubber. [...] Featuring multiplying gears ranging from 2:1 to 4:1, these early reels had no drag mechanism, and anglers used their thumb on the spool to provide resistance to runs by a fish. [...] As early as the 1870s, some models used bearings to mount the spool; as the free-spinning spool tended to cause backlash with strong pulls on the line, manufacturers soon incorporated a clicking <b>pawl</b> <b>mechanism.</b> [...] This 'clicker' mechanism was never intended as a drag, but used solely to keep the spool from overrunning, much like a fly reel. [...] Baitcasting reel users soon discovered that the clicking noise of the pawls provided valuable warning that a fish had taken the live bait, allowing the rod and reel to be left in a rod holder while awaiting a strike by a fish.|$|E

50|$|It {{is highly}} inadvisable {{to use the}} parking pawl to stop a vehicle in motion. Modern parking pawls are {{connected}} to a safety mechanism that prevents the pawl from engaging unless the vehicle is stopped first.

Under that much stress, the pawl may simply break off in the transmission, leading to costly repairs.|$|E
50|$|The {{intermittent}} mechanism can {{be constructed}} in different ways. For smaller gauge projectors (8 mm and 16 mm), a <b>pawl</b> <b>mechanism</b> engages the film's sprocket hole one side, or holes on each side.

50|$|The {{parking pawl}} locks the {{transmission}}'s output shaft to the transmission casing by engaging a pawl (a pin) that engages in a notched wheel on the shaft, stopping it (and thus the driven wheels) from rotating. The main {{components of a}} parking <b>pawl</b> <b>mechanism</b> are the parking gear, parking pawl, actuator rod, cam collar, cam plate, pivot pin and parking pawl return spring. The mechanism assembly is designed so that the parking pawl tooth collides and overrides the parking gear teeth (ratchets) until a safe engagement speed for the vehicle is reached.

50|$|The {{advancement}} of a rotor {{other than the}} left-hand one was called a turnover by the British. This was achieved by a ratchet and <b>pawl</b> <b>mechanism.</b> Each rotor had a ratchet with 26 teeth and every time a key was pressed, the set of spring-loaded pawls moved forward in unison, trying to engage with a ratchet. The alphabet ring of the rotor to the right normally prevented this. As this ring rotated with its rotor, a notch machined into it would eventually align itself with the pawl, allowing it to engage with the ratchet, and advance the rotor on its left. The right-hand pawl, having no rotor and ring to its right, stepped its rotor with every key depression. For a single-notch rotor in the right-hand position, the middle rotor stepped once for every 26 steps of the right-hand rotor. Similarly for rotors two and three. For a two-notch rotor, the rotor to its left would turn over twice for each rotation.|$|E
50|$|The {{earliest}} {{examples of}} what today is called a revolver were made in Germany in the late 16th century. These weapons featured a single barrel with a revolving cylinder holding the powder and ball. They would soon be made by many European gun-makers, in numerous designs and configurations. However, these weapons were difficult to use, complicated and prohibitively expensive to make, and as such they were not widely distributed.

5000|$|Researchers {{from the}} University of Twente, the University of Patras in Greece, and the Foundation for Fundamental Research on Matter have {{constructed}} a Feynman-Smoluchowski engine which, {{when not in}} thermal equilibrium, converts pseudo-Brownian motion into work {{by means of a}} granular gas, which is a conglomeration of solid particles vibrated with such vigour that the system assumes a gas-like state. The constructed engine consisted of four vanes which were allowed to rotate freely in a vibrofluidized granular gas. [...] Because the ratchet's gear and <b>pawl</b> <b>mechanism,</b> as described above, permitted the axle to rotate only in one direction, random collisions with the moving beads caused the vane to rotate. This seems to contradict Feynman's hypothesis. However, this system is not in perfect thermal equilibrium: energy is constantly being supplied to maintain the fluid motion of the beads. Vigorous vibrations on top of a shaking device mimic the nature of a molecular gas. Unlike an ideal gas, though, in which tiny particles move constantly, stopping the shaking would simply cause the beads to drop. In the experiment, this necessary out-of-equilibrium environment was thus maintained. Work was not immediately being done, though; the ratchet effect only commenced beyond a critical shaking strength. For very strong shaking, the vanes of the paddle wheel interacted with the gas, forming a convection roll, sustaining their rotation. [...] The experiment was filmed.|$|E

40|$|Compared with {{conventional}} robots that require {{some sort of}} safety measures in operation, compliant robots capable of interacting with the environment in a gentle way and perform self-adjustment according to the surroundings are of greater need nowadays. To achieve compliance, robots with variable stiffness are highly desirable. Principles of stiffness control for conventional actuators and rigid robots, such as spring-based variable stiffness and impedance mechanisms, have been thoroughly studied. In this thesis, {{the focus is on}} the novel principles of variable stiffness, in particular, on geometry-based and jamming-based methods, and their innovative applications in robotics. The utilization of 3 D printing technology in this research brings new insight into robotic research. At first, a non-assembly design of a compliant pneumatic stepper motor based on the ratchet and <b>pawl</b> <b>mechanism</b> is proposed for robotic drives. The proposed stepper motor can generate rotary stepping motion in response to a train of pulse air pressure. In addition, the pawl is designed as a compliant mechanism instead of conventional rigid component. As a result, the whole mechanism can be fabricated by 3 D printing without any post-assembly or installation of other components. However, the ratchet and <b>pawl</b> <b>mechanism</b> based stepper motor has speed limitation and velocity discontinuity problems. An updated design of non-assembly pneumatic stepper motor allows velocity control, and the switch between continuous motion and stepping motion. The key element to realize the dual motion pattern is an innovative design of a roller valve inspired by the cam-follower mechanism. The roller valve can also modulate the stiffness of robots by air pressure control. The proposed concept of non-assembly robotic design and fabrication based on 3 D printing and the proposed stepper motor designs can bring design innovation to various robots, such as household robots, industrial robots and so on. The geometry-based principle is applicable for compliant robots with rigid parts. For better compliance, jamming technique is applied to a proposed soft robotic spine design. The soft robotic spine is proposed based on the integration of particle jamming and ball joint. The combined mechanism effectively overcomes the unpredictable behavior of jamming due to particle rearrangement and deformation which severely affects its repeatability and stability. The experimental studies have shown stiffness enhancement of 13 times. The compliant spine mechanism can be coupled with an actuation method such as wires/tendons, or soft actuators for robotic applications. The research also finds that the particle jamming technology can bring unexpected effects into biomimetic robotic hand design. The proposed robotic finger design based on the integration of particle jamming and fiber-reinforced soft bending actuator provides an instructive model for robotic gripper applications. The prototype robotic hand demonstrates great performance of reliable grasping. Based on similar jamming interface, a bioinspired robotic palm is designed for the hand. The property of controllable stiffness of the palm allows a full contact of the palm with the object being grasped, thus providing a stable support for object grasping. The proposed palm design demonstrates a close emulation of human palm functions. published_or_final_versionMechanical EngineeringDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|E
