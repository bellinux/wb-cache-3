50|$|The IBM Electromatic Table Printing Machine was a typesetting-quality printer, {{consisting}} of a modified IBM Electromatic Proportional Spacing Typewriter connected to a modified IBM 016 keypunch. A <b>plugboard</b> <b>control</b> panel was used for programming and formatting of the printout.|$|E
50|$|The IBM 305 RAMAC used a {{plugboard}} for all program compare {{operations and}} all branch operations. Other <b>plugboards</b> <b>controlled</b> card reading and punching, the printer and the console typewriter. Many peripheral devices, e.g. the IBM 711 and 716, for {{first and second}} generation IBM computers, including the IBM 700/7000 series and the IBM 650, were based on unit record machines and included plugboards.|$|R
50|$|The 608 was {{supplied}} with a type 535 card reader/punch {{which had its}} own <b>control</b> <b>plugboard.</b>|$|R
50|$|A <b>plugboard,</b> or <b>control</b> panel (the {{term used}} {{depended}} on the application area), is an array of jacks, or sockets (often called hubs), into which patch cords can be inserted to complete an electrical circuit. Control panels were used to direct the operation of some unit record equipment. Plugboards were used on some s, and some early computers.|$|R
50|$|Programming the 305 {{involved}} {{not only}} writing machine language instructions {{to be stored}} on the drum memory, but also almost every unit in the system (including the computer itself) could be programmed by inserting wire jumpers into a <b>plugboard</b> <b>control</b> panel.|$|E
50|$|Information to {{be printed}} {{could be placed}} in any {{sequence}} via <b>plugboard</b> <b>control</b> panel selections. The machine operated {{at the rate of}} 75 cards a minute. The feed hopper had a capacity of 800 cards, and the stacker had a capacity of 1,000 cards.|$|E
50|$|The IBM 370 printer {{was used}} on the IBM 305 RAMAC {{computer}} system, introduced by IBM on September 14, 1956. The 370 {{was connected to the}} 305 by a serial data line from the S track of the computer's drum memory and printed 80-columns with a punched tape controlled carriage. Line formatting was programmed by inserting wire jumpers into a <b>plugboard</b> <b>control</b> panel.|$|E
5000|$|The 533 could punch 100 cards {{per minute}} {{and had a}} set of read brushes {{downstream}} from the punch station {{that were used to}} verify proper punching. The card reader was similar to that on the IBM 402 accounting machine and could read 200 cards per minute. The 533 was controlled by a <b>plugboard</b> <b>control</b> panel, typical of IBM unit record equipment of the time. p. 19 ff ...|$|E
50|$|While the {{architectures}} differ, {{the machines}} {{in the same class}} share electronics technologies and generally use the same peripherals. Tape drives use 7-track format, with the IBM 727 for vacuum tube machines and the 729 for transistor machines. Both the vacuum tube and most transistor models use the same card readers, card punches and line printers that were introduced with the 701. These units, the IBM 711, 721 and 716, are based on IBM accounting machine technology and even include <b>plugboard</b> <b>control</b> panels. They are relatively slow and it was common for 7000 series installations to include an IBM 1401, with its much faster peripherals, to do card-to-tape and tape-to-line-printer operations off-line. Three later machines, the 7010, the 7040 and the 7044, adopted peripherals from the midline IBM 1400 series. Some of the technology for the 7030 was used in data channels and peripheral devices on other 7000 series computers, e.g., 7340 Hypertape.|$|E
50|$|Starting {{at the end}} of {{the nineteenth}} century, well before the advent of {{electronic}} computers, data processing was performed using electromechanical machines called unit record equipment, electric accounting machines (EAM) or tabulating machines.Unit record machines came to be as ubiquitous in industry and government in the first two-thirds of the twentieth century as computers became in the last third. They allowed large volume, sophisticated data-processing tasks to be accomplished before electronic computers were invented and while they were still in their infancy. This data processing was accomplished by processing punched cards through various unit record machines in a carefully choreographed progression. This progression, or flow, from machine to machine was often planned and documented with detailed flowcharts that used standardized symbols for documents and the various machine functions. All but the earliest machines had high-speed mechanical feeders to process cards at rates from around 100 to 2,000 per minute, sensing punched holes with mechanical, electrical, or, later, optical sensors. The operation of many machines was directed by the use of a removable <b>plugboard,</b> <b>control</b> panel, or connection box. Initially all machines were manual or electromechanical. The first use of an electronic component was in 1940 when a gas triode vacuum tube replaced a relay in an IBM card sorter. Electronic components were used on other machines beginning in the late 1940s.|$|E
5000|$|For some {{computer}} applications, binary formats were used, {{where each}} hole represented a single binary digit (or [...] "bit"), every column (or row) {{is treated as}} a simple bitfield, and every combination of holes is permitted. For example, the IBM 711 card reader used with the 704/709/7090/7094 series scientific computers treated every row as two 36-bit words, ignoring 8 columns. (The specific 72 columns used were selectable using a <b>plugboard</b> <b>control</b> panel, which is almost always wired to select columns 1-72.) Sometimes the ignored columns (usually 73-80) were used to contain a sequence number for each card, so the card deck could be sorted to the correct order in case it was dropped. An alternative format, used by the IBM 704's IBM 714 native card reader, {{is referred to as}} Column Binary or Chinese Binary, and used 3 columns for each 36-bit word. [...] Later computers, such as the IBM 1130 or System/360, used every column. The IBM 1401's card reader could be used in Column Binary mode, which stored two characters in every column, or one 36-bit word in three columns when used as input device for other computers. However, most of the older card punches were not intended to punch more than 3 holes in a column. The multipunch key is used to produce binary cards, or other characters not on the keyboard.|$|E
