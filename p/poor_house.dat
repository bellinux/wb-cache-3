25|$|Orville was {{actively}} involved in his community, making a point to give back and help those less fortunate. One of the big problems then and now was poverty. As a result, Jefferson County established a <b>poor</b> <b>house</b> system paid for by appropriations from each town. In 1826, Hungerford was appointed {{as one of the}} first superintendents of the <b>poor</b> <b>house</b> located on the 150-acre Dudley Farm in Le Ray, New York. People sent to the <b>poor</b> <b>house</b> would have a place to live and would be provided with food and rudimentary medical care in exchange for some work, usually tied in with farming, e.g., picking oakum.|$|E
25|$|In 1833, Hungerford's {{brother-in-law}} {{and former}} business partner, Jabez Foster, sold the County some land near Watertown for $1,500.00 {{on which to}} build a new <b>poor</b> <b>house.</b> Hungerford and two others were tasked with setting up the new establishment.|$|E
25|$|On August 1, 1828, {{a man by}} {{the name}} of Barney Griffin, who had {{travelled}} from Syracuse to the Village of Sackets Harbor several days earlier, ended up dying in the Jefferson County <b>Poor</b> <b>House.</b> Orville went over to investigate. Upon searching Griffin's clothes, he found the cash sum of two hundred and twenty-two dollars and fifteen cents - more than enough money for Griffin to pay for a hotel. Hungerford put an advertisement in the a paper to see if a relative would claim the money. No one did. He then turned the money over to the County Treasurer for use of the <b>Poor</b> <b>House,</b> deducting a dollar for the advertisement money that came out of his own pocket. Understanding the nature of greed, he asked the County Board of Supervisors to indemnify him for his actions, which it agreed to do.|$|E

The offending <b>poor</b> <b>houses</b> were subsequently demolished and the land, along with part of the common, were sold to the owner of Wick House for an extension to the garden. The £250 raised from the sale was used in 1809 towards construction of new <b>poor</b> <b>houses</b> {{at the foot of the}} common.|$|R

Of the 6 million Americans who experience <b>poor</b> <b>housing</b> conditions, blacks and Hispanics fare much worse than whites. Moreover, <b>poor</b> <b>housing</b> conditions are disproportionately found in inner cities and rural areas {{as opposed to the}} suburbs. Inner city minorities have poorer health than suburban whites. Black homeowners are more likely than Hispanic and white homeowners to experience severe and moderate housing problems. 2.1% of all homeowners have moderate housing quality problems. 5.9% of black homeowners and 3.8% of Hispanic homeowners experience moderate housing quality problems.|$|R

North of there was the African Burial Ground, which was rediscovered in 1991 during survey work for construction at 26 Federal Plaza in lower Manhattan. In consultation with the African-American community, the remains of 400 people, including children, were removed and studied. They were reburied in a formal ceremony. Likely the site of up to 20,000 African burials during the colonial period, it has been designated as a National Historic Landmark.|$|E
500|$|After the {{decommissioning}} {{of the military}} prison, Melville Island {{was used as a}} receiving depot for some of the black refugees, the estimated 1600–2000 escaped slaves who arrived in Halifax between 1815 and 1818. In April 1815, seventy-six refugees were moved to Melville from the Halifax <b>Poor</b> <b>House,</b> many ill with smallpox. The refugees were given blankets, [...] "colourful" [...] clothing (often the uniforms of captured or demobilized soldiers), and children's shoes. Rations included pork or beef, potatoes, rice, cornmeal, molasses, spruce beer (to prevent scurvy), and sometimes coffee. To discourage men from leaving their families at the depot as they worked in Halifax, rations were only given to heads of families. Thomas Jeffery was granted a salary of £1500 (£86,655 as of 2010) for administering the depot. Eighty-two refugees died during the smallpox outbreak, and 500 were vaccinated to prevent the further spread of the disease. An increasing number passed through Melville Island on their way to Canadian settlements: between 727 and 798 are recorded from April to July 1815. Most of these found work in Halifax or moved to land grants, but some returned the following winter [...] "when in distress". At least 107 of these refugees died on Melville Island. The province's lieutenant-governor ordered that the refugees be moved to Preston or Halifax in May 1816, and put the land up for lease to [...] "a person of unexceptionable character", but no lease is recorded during this period. The hospital was officially closed in June 1816.|$|E

2500|$|Insufficient {{financial}} resources [...] {{and lack of}} coordination in government bureaucracy [...] are two main causes of <b>poor</b> <b>house</b> planning. Financial deficiency in some governments may explain the lack of [...] affordable public housing for the poor since any improvement of the tenant in slums and expansion of public housing programs involve a great increase in the government expenditure. The problem can also lie on the failure in coordination among different departments in charge of economic development, urban planning, and land allocation. In some cities, governments assume that the housing market will adjust the supply of housing with a change in demand. However, with little economic incentive, the housing market {{is more likely to}} develop middle-income housing rather than low-cost housing. The urban poor gradually become marginalized in the housing market where few houses are built to sell to them.|$|E

The purchase was made mostly on credit, for mother was still hoping to get her five thousand off of Strakhov which never came. The tiny village father had bought was eventually sold for debts," [...] Leskov later remembered. What the Leskovs, with their three sons and two daughters, were left with was a small Panin khutor, one very <b>poor</b> <b>house,</b> a watermill, a garden, two peasants' houses and 40 dessiatins of land. This is where Nikolai had his first experiences with oral folklore and the 'earthy' Russian dialecticisms he would later become famous for reviving in his literary work.|$|E
2500|$|One {{critical}} issue addressed by Moreton in this pamphlet involves the night watch, a highly significant {{institution in the}} panorama of eighteenth-century London. As described by Moreton, the watchmen were [...] "decrepit, superannuated wretches, with {{one foot in the}} grave and the other ready to follow" [...] and therefore more suited to the <b>Poor</b> <b>House</b> than for patrolling of the streets: [...] "so little terror they carry with them, that hardly thieves make a mere jest of them". He even supposes that some of them, discouraged by their low social status, might decide to make their fortunes by passing to the other side and enlarging the ranks of criminals. Along with many of his peers, Moreton believes that English society is completely at the mercy of a dramatic rise in numbers of street-robberies, burglaries, and house-breakings, crimes which are generating anxiety among all social classes in the capital. House-breaking especially seems to directly concerned the entire metropolis, including the more wealthy and fashionable parishes. Moreover, the latest changes of the urban surroundings have hardened the policing of the streets, especially with shops, taverns, coffee-houses, theatres, pleasure gardens, remaining open in the evening and such {{a large number of people}} moving around after dusk.|$|E
2500|$|In late antiquity {{and in the}} Middle Ages many {{monks and}} hermits renounced meat-eating {{in the context of}} their asceticism. The most {{prominent}} of them was St Jerome († 419), whom they used to take as their model. The Rule of St Benedict (6th century) allowed the Benedictines to eat fish and fowl, but forbade the consumption of the meat of quadrupeds unless the religious was ill. Many other rules of religious orders contained similar restrictions of diet, some of which even included fowl, but fish was never prohibited, as Jesus himself had eaten fish (Luke 24:42-43). The concern of those monks and nuns was frugality, voluntary privation, and self-mortification. William of Malmesbury writes that Bishop Wulfstan of Worcester (d. 1095) decided to adhere to a strict vegetarian diet simply because he found it difficult to resist the smell of roasted goose. Saint Genevieve, the Patron Saint of Paris, is mentioned as having observed a vegetarian diet—but as an act of physical austerity, rather than out of concern for animals. [...] Medieval hermits, at least those portrayed in literature, may have been vegetarians for similar reasons, as suggested in a passage from Sir Thomas Malory's Le Morte d'Arthur: 'Then departed Gawain and Ector as heavy (sad) as they might for their misadventure (mishap), and so rode till that they came to the rough mountain, and there they tied their horses and went on foot to the hermitage. [...] And when they were (had) come up, they saw a <b>poor</b> <b>house,</b> and beside the chapel a little courtelage (courtyard), where Nacien the hermit gathered worts (vegetables), as he which had tasted none other meat (food) of a great while.' ...|$|E

In 1970 a large collection of Beuys' work formed under the artist's own aegis, the Ströher Collection, was installed in the Hessisches Landesmuseum in Darmstadt, which remains the most important public collection of his work. Pontus Hultén invited him to exhibit at Moderna Museet in 1971. Beuys exhibited and performed at each Documenta Kassel most notably with 'The Honeypump at the FIU Workplace' in 1977 and with 7,000 Oaks in 1982. He showed four times at the Edinburgh International Festival and represented Germany at the Venice Biennale in 1976 and 1980. A retrospective of his work {{was held at the}} Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York, in 1979. In 1984, Beuys visited Japan and showed various works, including installations and performances, while also holding discussions with students and giving lectures. His first Beuys exhibition took place at the Seibu Museum of Art in Tokyo that same year. The DIA Art Foundation held exhibitions of Beuys's work in 1987, 1992, and 1998, and has planted trees and basalt columns in New York City as part of his 7000 Eichen, echoing his planting of 7,000 oaks each with a basalt stone project begun in 1982 for Documenta 7 in Kassel, Germany. [...] Large collections of his multiples are held by Harvard University, Walker Art Center Minneapolis, and Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art, which also has a collection of Beuys vitrines, The Schellmann and D'Offey collections. Most of the Marx collection of Beuys works including 'The secret Block for a Secret Person in Ireland' drawings is at The Hamburger Bahnhof Museum, Berlin. All the major art museums in Germany have many Beuys works including Fond III at Landesmuseum Darmstadt, ehil Moechengladbach Museum has the <b>Poor</b> <b>House</b> Doors and much else, Beuys gave a large collection to the Solidarinosc Movement in Poland. Feuerstätte I und Feuerstätte II (Hearth I and Hearth II) and other works are at the Museum for Contemporary Art Basel, and a dedicated museum was created for 'The Museum des Geldes' collection mainly of FIU blackboards from Documenta 6.

Housing problems tend to persist over time but {{little is known about the}} mental health consequences of living with persistent housing problems. We investigated if persistence of <b>poor</b> <b>housing</b> affects mental health over and above the effect of current housing conditions. We used data from 13 annual waves of the British Household Panel Survey (1996 to 2008) (81, 745 person/year observations from 16, 234 individuals) and measured the persistence of housing problems by the number of years in the previous four that a household experienced housing problems. OLS regression models and lagged-change regression models were used to estimate the effects of past and current housing conditions on mental health, as measured by the General Health Questionnaire. Interaction terms tested if tenure type modified the impact of persistent <b>poor</b> <b>housing</b> on mental health. In fully adjusted models, mental health worsened as the persistence of housing problems increased. Adjustment for current housing conditions attenuated, but did not explain, the findings. Tenure type moderated the effects of persistent <b>poor</b> <b>housing</b> on mental health, suggesting that those who own their homes outright and those who live in social housing are most negatively affected.
