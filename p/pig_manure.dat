40|$|Abstract: To {{determine}} {{the contents of}} heavy metal (Cu, Zn, As, Cr, Cd and Pb) in animal feeds and manures, 104 livestock feeds and 118 animal manure samples from farms of different herd size and located in northeast China were collected and their heavy metal concentrations were determined. The content of Cu, As and Cd ranged from 2. 3 – 1, 137. 1 mg/kg dm, 0. 02 – 13. 03 mg/kg dm and non-detectable (nd) − 31. 65 mg/kg dm in pig feeds, 2. 88 – 98. 08 mg Cu/kg dm, 0. 02 – 6. 42 mg As/kg dm and non-detectable (nd) – 8. 00 mg Cd/kg dm in poultry feeds, and their content in cattle feeds {{was similar to that}} in poultry feeds.

40|$|In this study, 183 {{livestock}} feeds and 85 {{animal manure}} {{samples were collected}} from commercial farms in England and Wales and analysed to determine their heavy metal (zinc, copper, nickel, lead, cadmium, arsenic, chromium and mercury) contents.

40|$|Forty-seven {{different}} animal wastes {{were characterized}} using chemical and organic matter fractionation methods (water extraction and Van Soest method) and 224 -day incubation studies {{to assess their}} decomposition in soil. Simple correlation and multiple factor analysis were performed to establish relationships between the composition of these wastes and C and N mineralization. Carbon and N contents ranged from 101 to 469 mg C kg− 1 dry matter (d. m.) and from 4 to 39 mg N kg− 1 d. m. Soluble C and N represented less than 9 % of organic C and 1. 5 % of total N at 20 °C, respectively. The C fractions soluble at 100 °C or in neutral detergent were larger and represented 14 and 32 % of the organic C, respectively. The hemicellulose-like (HEM) and cellulose-like (CEL) fractions contained about 16. 5 and 6 % of the organic N, respectively. The C distribution in the lignin-like (LIG) and CEL fractions was comparable, but the former contained more N. Carbon mineralization varied from 5 to 62 % of the organic C added during the 224 -day incubation; 70 % of the wastes induced net N mineralization {{at the end of}} incubation (from 3 to 51 % of organic N). Other wastes induced net soil inorganic N immobilization, from − 1 to − 31 % of the organic N added. Most highly significant correlations were established between the C mineralization and the C present in the water-soluble fraction at 20 °C, and the HEM and LIG fractions. Relationships between N mineralization and biochemical characteristics were weak, except with the soluble Van Soest fraction, and highly significant correlations were observed between N mineralization rates calculated at 224 days of incubation and the organic N content or C/N ratio of wastes. Finally, an objective hierarchical classification based on composition criteria and C and N mineralization led to the definition of six different classes of wastes. It permitted differentiation between four composted wastes and intrinsically different wastes (i. e., cattle <b>manures,</b> <b>pig</b> <b>manures,</b> and poultry manures) which could not be objectively regrouped. It also placed some very different types of waste (solid phase from pig slurry separation, <b>pig</b> <b>manures,</b> and composted <b>pig</b> mixtures) in the same class...|$|R

30|$|Biochar, however, {{may contain}} enough labile C (Zimmerman 2010; Luo et al. 2011) and high {{nutrient}} levels that can prime soil microbes to induce {{the production of}} extracellular enzymes to degrade native SOC through co-metabolism (Kuzyakov et al. 2000; Zimmerman et al. 2011). A significant loss of native SOC following biochar addition to a forest soil (positive priming effect) was reported by Wardle et al. (2008). The indirect changes in soil microbial activity triggered {{by the addition of}} biochar, resulting in increased mineralization of native SOC can influence microbial C cycling processes in soils. Other researchers, however, have reported no effect on SOC mineralization following biochar application (Kuzyakov et al. 2009; Novak et al. 2010). The combined application of biochar and organic amendments such as green and <b>pig</b> <b>manures</b> have also been shown to result in increased CO 2 efflux compared to individual applications (Luo et al. 2011; Troy et al. 2013).

The presence of a rooting area and of a drinker on the outdoor run were tested in a 2 x 2 factorial design. The pens with the rooting areas had a higher number of pigs on the outdoor run than the pens without a rooting area (1. 6 vs 1. 2 pigs). This was caused by more pigs in area 2 and 3. At higher temperatures there were more pigs outside, except in the root-ing area: this was popular at all temperatures. A rooting area resulted in a cleaner outdoor area, however {{in some cases the}} root-ing area became a dunging area.

40|$|The use {{of organic}} waste as {{fertilizers}} {{in the urban}} and peri-urban agriculture can contribute to maintain soil fertility and solve food security. This study was done to evaluate {{the effect of the}} <b>manure</b> (<b>pig</b> and cattle) on the chemical parameters of the soils in Bobo-Dioulasso area. With that aim in mind, eight (8) farms where the animal waste is used as well as some non-cultivated plots were identified in 2012 for the study. Some samples of soil were taken for chemical analysis in a laboratory. The results showed a fall of the pHH 2 O balance of 0. 46 and 0. 51 unit respectively in the 0 - 10 cm and 10 - 20 cm depths following the use of the pig waste. The content of the manure had a positive impact on the organic status of the soils by the increase of their C and N rates. An easily absorbed phosphorus rate higher in the 0 - 10 cm and 10 - 20 cm depths was noted in the plots which were fertilized with <b>pigs</b> <b>manure.</b> Moreover, the content of the cattle manure is materialized by an increase of total K respectively 1210 ppm for the 0 - 10 cm depth and 1351 ppm for the 10 - 20 cm deph.

40|$|In many countries, the {{patenting}} {{of genetically}} engineered animals is now largely uncontroversial. In this paper, I argue that assemblage theory offers an alternative analysis of patents and genetically engineered animals. This emphasises heterogeneity and relations, and focuses attention on the processes of territorialisation (stabilisation) and deterritorialisation (destabilisation). More specifically, by conceptualising the genetically engineered EnviroPig as an assemblage of heterogeneous actants I uncover some of relations between different actants such as <b>pigs,</b> <b>manure,</b> the environment, patents, industry and advocacy groups, regulatory frameworks and so on. I also situate patents within the EnviroPig-assemblage and show that while patents cannot, in themselves, make genetically engineered animals live they do {{have the capacity to}} both stabilise and destabilise a genetically engineered assemblage. In the end, though, patents (legally) are just one actant in an assemblage, and the case of the EnviroPig points out the contingent and situational nature of patented life forms, and the complexity and instability of the bricolages which are necessary to bring them into the world and maintain their existence. The story of the EnviroPig-assemblage shows a genetically engineered life cut short by a mixture of actants including the complexities of regulatory frameworks, environmental and animal welfare concerns, and organised resistance from activists and anti-GM advocacy groups...|$|R
