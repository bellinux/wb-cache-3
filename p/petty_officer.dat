5000|$|In the U.S. Navy, both {{commissioned}} <b>officers</b> and Chief <b>Petty</b> <b>Officers</b> {{are often}} colloquially {{referred to as}} [...] "khakis". In the past, commissioned <b>officers</b> and chief <b>petty</b> <b>officers</b> wore khaki-colored uniforms while onboard seagoing vessels, in direct contrast to <b>petty</b> <b>officers</b> and seamen, who were referred to as deckplate sailors, or blueshirts. However, since 2009, while khakis are still worn ashore, the U.S. Navy has begun using a blue and gray camouflage working uniform which replaced the khaki-colored ones worn by commissioned <b>officers</b> and chief <b>petty</b> <b>officers</b> on board ships, and also adopted a new service uniform for <b>petty</b> <b>officers</b> and seamen in pay grades E-6 and below, consisting of a khaki shirt and black trousers. The latter has caused some discontent among some chief <b>petty</b> <b>officers</b> and commissioned officers as a result. In the U.S. Coast Guard, <b>petty</b> <b>officers,</b> chief <b>petty</b> <b>officers,</b> warrant officers, and commissioned officers all wear similar uniforms.|$|R

5000|$|The {{remainder}} of the ship's company, who lived and berthed in the common crew quarters, were the <b>petty</b> <b>officers</b> and seamen. <b>Petty</b> <b>officers</b> were seamen who had been [...] "rated" [...] to fill a particular specialist trade on board ship. This rating set the <b>petty</b> <b>officers</b> apart from the common seaman by virtue of technical skill and slightly higher education. No special uniform was allocated for <b>petty</b> <b>officers,</b> although some Royal Navy ships allowed such persons to don a simple blue frock coat to denote their status.|$|R
