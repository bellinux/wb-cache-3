A 175 km canal connecting the dam with towns of Qarveh and Dehlegan will annually supply over [...] of water for agricultural purposes to these towns. As the water table of these towns have gone down by over 18 m due to the excessive use of underground water for crop cultivation, the construction of this dam will help to conserve the underground water sources of the area. One village had to be relocated due to construction of the dam and another new village has been built near the body of the dam. It is estimated that Azad dam will yearly produce approximately 95 GWh of electricity. The dam is to become fully operational by 2013.|$|E
