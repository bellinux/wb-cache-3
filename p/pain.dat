5|$|Antidepressants may be {{effective}} for treating chronic <b>pain</b> associated with symptoms of depression, {{but they have}} a risk of side effects. Although the antiseizure drugs gabapentin and carbamazepine are sometimes used for chronic low back <b>pain</b> and may relieve sciatic <b>pain,</b> there is insufficient evidence to support their use. Systemic oral steroids have not been shown to be useful in low back <b>pain.</b> Facet joint injections and steroid injections into the discs have not been found to {{be effective}} in those with persistent, non-radiating pain; however, they may be considered for those with persistent sciatic <b>pain.</b> Epidural corticosteroid injections provide a slight and questionable short-term improvement in those with sciatica but are of no long term benefit. There are also concerns of potential side effects.|$|E
5|$|As the {{structure}} of the back is complex and the reporting of <b>pain</b> is subjective and affected by social factors, the diagnosis of low back <b>pain</b> is not straightforward. While most low back <b>pain</b> is caused by muscle and joint problems, this cause must be separated from neurological problems, spinal tumors, fracture of the spine, and infections, among others.|$|E
5|$|Aspirin is an {{effective}} analgesic for acute <b>pain,</b> but is generally considered inferior to ibuprofen for the alleviation of <b>pain</b> because aspirin {{is more likely to}} cause gastrointestinal bleeding. Aspirin is generally ineffective for those pains caused by muscle cramps, bloating, gastric distension, or acute skin irritation. As with other NSAIDs, combinations of aspirin and caffeine provide slightly greater <b>pain</b> relief than aspirin alone. Effervescent formulations of aspirin, such as Alka-Seltzer or Blowfish, relieve <b>pain</b> faster than aspirin in tablets, which makes them useful for the treatment of migraines.

40|$|Objective: To {{establish}} the clinical aspects of growing <b>pains</b> and to determine, through differential diagnosis, how many patients who referred {{themselves to a}} specialized clinic {{were found to have}} growing <b>pains.</b> Methods: This study prospectively examined the presence of growing <b>pains</b> in a self-reported population of children and adolescents with signs and symptoms (lower limb <b>pains)</b> of unexplained etiology. Results: A total of 345 children and adolescents were evaluated; 174 (50. 4 %) were males and 171 (49. 6 %) were females. Three hundred cases were classified as growing <b>pains</b> (87 %). Conclusion: A high frequency of growing <b>pains</b> was found in our study population and it shows that in a prospective evaluation of patients with signs and symptoms of unknown etiology we can find a frequency higher than that reported in literature...|$|R

5|$|Behavioral therapy may {{be useful}} for chronic <b>pain.</b> There are several types available, {{including}} operant conditioning, which uses reinforcement to reduce undesirable behaviors and increase desirable behaviors; cognitive behavioral therapy, which helps people identify and correct negative thinking and behavior; and respondent conditioning, which can modify an individual's physiological response to <b>pain.</b> Medical providers may develop an integrated program of behavioral therapies.

40|$|AbstractThere {{has been}} no {{previous}} side-by-side comparison of the diagnostic criteria for restless legs syndrome (RLS) (Willis–Ekbom disease) and growing <b>pains.</b> In our review, we explore this comparison emphasizing overlaps and disconnects, summarize recent literature exploring {{the relationship between the}} 2 entities, and make suggestions for future research. There is considerable overlap in the diagnostic criteria for childhood RLS and growing <b>pains.</b> The literature also indicates that RLS and growing <b>pains</b> more commonly occur together than one would expect based on chance alone, and the family histories of RLS and growing <b>pains</b> often are overlapping. Leg rubbing to obtain relief from leg discomfort is common to both disorders, though walking to obtain relief seems unique to RLS. Childhood RLS also has been reported to be painful in up to 45 % of cases. The development of standard diagnostic criteria is necessary to move forward in the field of growing <b>pains</b> research. A quantitative and validated rating scale for growing <b>pains</b> severity already exists. Because of the clinical and genetic similarity between RLS and growing <b>pains,</b> studies that parallel those previously performed in RLS patients are recommended for growing <b>pains</b> patients. For example, a genome wide association study in growing <b>pains</b> patients of all possible genes with particular attention to those identified as related to RLS and a therapeutic trial of medications known to be effective in RLS would be welcome. Abnormalities in vitamin D metabolism also may be common to both disorders...|$|R
5|$|For {{persistent}} {{low back}} <b>pain,</b> the short-term outcome is also positive, with {{improvement in the}} first six weeks but very little improvement after that. At one year, those with chronic low back <b>pain</b> usually continue to have moderate <b>pain</b> and disability. People at higher risk of long-term disability include those with poor coping skills or with fear of activity (2.5 {{times more likely to have}} poor outcomes at one year), those with a poor ability to cope with <b>pain,</b> functional impairments, poor general health, or a significant psychiatric or psychological component to the <b>pain</b> (Waddell's signs).|$|E

40|$|Magnetic {{nanoparticles}} were {{coated with}} either dextran or polyacrylic acid (PAA), and compared as potential traceable carriers for targeted intraneuronal therapeutics. Nanoparticles were fabricated using a chemical reduction method and their number mean diameter, aggregation, surface chemistry, crystal structure and magnetic properties were characterized. The crystalline {{core of the}} dextran-coated nanoparticles was Fe 3 O 4, while the PAA-coated sample had an iron core. The dextran-coated iron oxide nanoparticles (DIONs) and PAA-coated iron nanoparticles (<b>PAINs)</b> were both stable and had a similar mean diameter of less than 10 nm. However, morphologically, the <b>PAINs</b> were well dispersed, while the DIONs aggregated. DIONs exhibited the presence of hysteresis and ferromagnetic properties due to aggregation, while <b>PAINs</b> displayed superparamagnetic behavior. Surface chemistry analysis after 2 weeks of being exposed to air indicated that DIONs oxidized to Fe 2 O 3, while <b>PAINs</b> were composed of a metallic Fe core and a mixed oxidation state shell. Based on these analyses, we concluded that <b>PAINs</b> are stronger candidates for examining axonal transport, since they were less prone to aggregation, offered a stronger magnetic signal, and were less oxidized. Neurotoxicity analysis of <b>PAINs</b> revealed that no significant toxicity was observed compared to negative controls for concentrations up to 1 mg/ml, thus further indicating their potential utility for biological applications. Finally, we successfully conjugated <b>PAINs</b> to a fluorophore, rhodamine 110 chloride, through a simple two-step reaction, demonstrating the feasibility of functionalizing <b>PAINs.</b> This study suggests that <b>PAINs</b> should be further evaluated as a candidate technology for intraneuronal diagnostics and therapy...|$|R
