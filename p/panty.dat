5|$|By the 1960s, the bikini {{swimsuit}} influenced <b>panty</b> {{styles and}} {{coincided with the}} cut of the new lower rise jeans and pants. In the seventies, {{with the emergence of}} skintight jeans, thong versions of the <b>panty</b> became mainstream, since the open, stringed back eliminated any tell-tale <b>panty</b> lines across the rear and hips. By the 1980s the design of the French-cut <b>panty</b> pushed the waistband back up to the natural waistline {{and the rise of the}} leg openings was nearly as high (French Cut panties come up to the waist, has a high cut leg, and usually are full in the rear). As with the bra and other type of lingerie, manufacturers of the last quarter of the century marketed <b>panty</b> styles that were designed primarily for their sexual allure. From this decade sexualization and eroticization of the male body was on the rise. The male body was celebrated through advertising campaigns for brands such as Calvin Klein, particularly by photographers Bruce Weber and Herb Ritts. Male bodies and men's undergarments were commodified and packaged for mass consumption, and swimwear and sportswear were influenced by sports photography and fitness. Over time, swimwear evolved from weighty wool to high-tech skin-tight garments, eventually cross-breeding with sportswear, underwear and exercise wear, resulting in the interchangeable fashions of the 1990s.|$|E

50|$|Though {{women are}} often shown wearing <b>panties</b> under a garter belt with stockings, <b>panties</b> are {{actually}} worn over the garters {{to allow the}} <b>panties</b> to be easily pulled down or removed without unfastening the garters.

25|$|The monsters of {{the week}} in the series, Ghosts are twisted aberrations born from the regrets or {{suffering}} {{of people who have}} died and become lost in limbo. <b>Panty</b> and Stocking are tasked with their destruction, which allows them to pass on to Heaven, leaving behind Heaven Coins. Although most Ghosts are savage or destructive, some are relatively harmless annoyances or even oppose their true nature and try to live peacefully. Ghosts are usually slain with angelic weapons, but there are other means of destroying them, such as Ghosts killing each other or peacefully accomplishing what they wanted to achieve in life. As a recurring joke, whenever <b>Panty</b> and Stocking defeat a Ghost with their angelic weapons, a paper-mache model of the Ghost is filmed being blown-up.|$|E

25|$|Several other designs {{have been}} tried since then, but they {{required}} the user either to hover awkwardly or to bring her genitals into close contact with the fixture. Most have not caught on. Current clothes fashions, such as <b>panty</b> hose and slacks, inhibit women from using them {{because they do not}} want their garments to touch the urinal or the floor. Often, women have little experience with urinals and do not know whether to approach them forward or backward.|$|E

25|$|A manga {{adaptation}} of the series by Tagro was serialized in Kadokawa Shoten's Young Ace magazine between August 2010 and June 2011.

25|$|While {{the name}} bikini {{was applied to}} the skimpy fashion that first {{revealed}} the wearer's navel, the fashion industry considers any two-piece swimsuit a bikini. Modern bikini fashions today are characterized by a simple, brief design: two triangles of fabric that form a bra and cover the woman's breasts and two triangles of fabric on the bottom forming a <b>panty</b> cut below the navel that cover the groin in front and the buttocks in back. The amount of coverage can vary widely, from a string bikini with very little coverage to a full design with maximum coverage. A topless swimsuit may still be considered a bikini, although naturally it is no longer a two-piece swimsuit.|$|E

500|$|During production, the album's title {{changed from}} Bipolar to <b>Panty</b> Sniffer, {{and then to}} Results May Vary.

On August 20, 2003, Fred Durst posted on the Limp Bizkit website: [...] "The album title is Results May Vary.

500|$|After {{recording}} another album without Smith, {{the band}} scrapped the new sessions and assembled {{a new album}} combining songs from different sessions.

Under Durst's sole leadership, the album encompassed a variety of styles, and featured a cover of The Who's [...] "Behind Blue Eyes", which differed from the original's arrangement in its inclusion of a Speak & Spell during the song's bridge.|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} {{received}} mixed reviews from critics, with some arguing that Spears' body was digitally altered. The Daily Telegraph commented [...] "Britney – presumably {{with the help}} of some serious digital remastering – has turned back the clock, looking every part the young starlet that gave us 'Oops'". Dose said [...] "shockingly, it's not that bad. Well, not that bad for everyone's favourite <b>panty</b> protesting, deposition skipping, weave wearing pop-tard". On August 17, 2008, it was announced that the video was nominated for Best Female Video, Best Pop Video and Video of the Year at the 2008 MTV Video Music Awards. The ceremony was held on September 7, 2008, and Spears won all three categories. On October 18, 2008, during a live interview with New York's Z100, she explained that she was shocked when she won, saying, [...] "It's a cool video, but I think by far I've done videos that are way better, so I was really shocked that it got [...] It was just inspiring, though, because now, going forward with the videos that I'm doing now, I can really go there and do something crazy and see what happens".|$|E
500|$|As the {{swimsuit}} was evolving, the underwear {{started to}} change. Between 1900 and 1940, swimsuit lengths followed {{the changes in}} underwear designs. In the 1920s women started discarding the corset, while the Cadole company of Paris started developing something they called the [...] "breast girdle". During the Great Depression, panties and bras became softly constructed and were made of various elasticized yarns making underwear fit like a second skin. By 1930s underwear styles for {{both women and men}} were influenced by the new brief models of swimwear from Europe. Although the waistband was still above the navel, the leg openings of the <b>panty</b> brief were cut in an arc to rise from the crotch to the hip joint. The brief served as a template for most all variations of panties {{for the rest of the}} century. Warner standardized the concept of Cup size in 1935. The first underwire bra was developed in 1938. Beginning in the late thirties skants, a type of skanty men's briefs, were introduced, featuring very high-cut leg openings and a lower rise to the waistband. Howard Hughes designed a push-up bra to be worn by Jane Russell in The Outlaw in 1943, although Russell stated in interviews that she never wore the 'contraption'. In 1950 Maidenform introduced the first official bust enhancing bra.|$|E
500|$|The Tenjho Tenge anime is {{described}} as a significantly toned down version of the Japanese manga, but still retains most of the spirit of its predecessor. Much of the nudity was removed by the animators, but was made up in the way of sexual innuendos, gratuitous cleavage, and <b>panty</b> shots. Since the anime is a close adaptation to the manga, critique of the plot is comparable to the manga's. Some reviewers felt that the anime was handled in a frantic and ill-planned manner that made the conclusion not satisfactory even with the original video animation. The animation done by Madhouse is considered to be well done. They used bright vibrant colors, solid backgrounds and plenty of visible detail with very little pixelation or jagged movement, but at times used repeated character shots and animations. The animation done during the fight scenes is done in real time and is done as close to reality as possible while still bending, and often violating, the laws of physics. [...] The early fight scenes are thought to be the [...] "...most intense seen in recent anime" [...] by Kevin Gilvear of DVD Times. Carlo Santos of Anime News Network affirmed the quality of animation in these scenes does drop somewhat over time, but the action still looks better than the average fighting anime. Both the Japanese and English voice acting are considered to be good, but the English dub at times can be a little uneven. The English dub on occasion has poor dialogue, according to Anime News Network's Patrick King, which causes it to lose much of the anime's sincerity. Overall, the anime is considered to be above average, but suffers from a lack of a good ending, mainly because the anime only covered the first arc of the story.|$|E
5000|$|Visual {{access to}} {{underwear}} [...] - [...] Because underwear is so {{closely tied to}} sexuality (even more so than nudity in Xanth), men become automatically [...] "freaked out" [...] when they view <b>panties.</b> This is made a common joke, most prominently in the novel The Color of Her <b>Panties,</b> and is often used by women to gain advantage over men. <b>Panties</b> only carry their effects when worn, but because of their nature, they are forbidden to be shown to children.|$|R

50|$|Following the anime episode ending that {{involved}} flying <b>panties,</b> Rocket Girls creator Hōsuke Nojiri created {{a rubber band}} powered ornithopter {{in the shape of}} the <b>panties,</b> and posted the video on Nico Nico Douga where it soon became viral. NKH (Niconico's live streaming station) and a local school (Niconico Technical Community) then hosted a Sora Fes event on March 6, 2010, where participants built and flew model airplanes in the likeness of the flying <b>panties.</b> Nojiri, along with OpenSky's media artist Kazuhiko Hachiya, director Hisashi Saito, and TBS announcer Jun Suzuki also attended the event.|$|R
