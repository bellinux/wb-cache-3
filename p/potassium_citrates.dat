40|$|Eight {{different}} poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) /salt aqueous two-phase systems (ATPS's) {{were characterized}} at 23 °C. PEGs with different molecular weights (1500 and 8000) were combined with different salts (sodium or <b>potassium</b> <b>citrates</b> and formates) {{to study the}} effect of each ATPS constituent in the phase diagram. The binodal curve and several tie-lines were determined for each system using common analytical techniques described in the literature for ATPS's (cloud point method, conductivity, and gravimetric analysis after lyophilization). According to the results, {{it was found that}} each ATPS constituent produced a particular effect in the phase diagram. For the salts, changes in the anion produced larger variations in the heterogeneous region size than changes of the cation. Thus, the effect of salt type seems to be largely dependent on the anion, which makes the dominant contribution. The ability to form ATPS's is connected with the Gibbs energy of hydration, ΔG hyd, of the anions: more negative ΔG hyd values facilitate ATPS formation. Changes in the PEG molecular weight affected also the phase diagram: the size of the heterogeneous region increases with the increase in the polymer molecular weight.

40|$|Effect of potassium-magnesium citrate on urinary {{biochemistry}} and crystallization of stone-forming salts {{was compared}} with that of <b>potassium</b> <b>citrate</b> at same dose of potassium in five normal subjects and five patients with calcium nephrolithiasis. Compared to the placebo phase, urinary pH rose significantly from 6. 06 +/- 0. 27 to 6. 48 +/- 0. 36 (mean +/- SD, p less than 0. 0167) during treatment with <b>potassium</b> <b>citrate</b> (50 mEq/day for 7 days) and to 6. 68 +/- 0. 31 during therapy with potassium-magnesium citrate (containing 49 mEq K, 24. 5 mEq Mg, and 73. 5 mEq citrate per day). Urinary pH was significantly higher during potassium-magnesium <b>citrate</b> than during <b>potassium</b> <b>citrate</b> therapy. Thus, the amount of undissociated uric acid declined from 118 +/- 61 mg/day during the placebo phase to 68 +/- 54 mg/day during <b>potassium</b> <b>citrate</b> treatment and, more prominently, to 41 +/- 46 mg/day during potassium-magnesium citrate therapy. Urinary magnesium rose significantly from 102 +/- 25 to 146 +/- 37 mg/day during potassium-magnesium citrate therapy but not during <b>potassium</b> <b>citrate</b> therapy.

Consequently, urinary saturation (activity product) of calcium oxalate declined significantly (from 1. 49 x 10 (- 8) to 1. 03 x 10 (- 8) M 2) during potassium-magnesium citrate therapy and marginally (to 1. 14 x 10 (- 8) M 2) during <b>potassium</b> <b>citrate</b> therapy.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the inhibition effects of the terpenoid of Plantago major on calcium oxalate crystals in vitro and to compare the effects of Plantago major with clinically used drugs like zyloric and <b>potassium</b> <b>citrate</b> for the treatment of urinary stone. Modified Schneider slide gel method was used for in vitro study and crystals formed were measured by Image Analyser System (Leica) after 24 h of treatment. The active compound in the methanol extract of Plantago major was isolated by bioassay - guided fractionation & isolation method. Dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO) was used as the negative control and zyloric and <b>potassium</b> <b>citrate</b> were used as positive controls. The results showed that crude methanol extract of Plantago major contained the active compound terpenoid.

40|$|Objectives: To {{evaluate}} by {{a prospective}} randomized controlled study {{the efficacy of}} the association of <b>potassium</b> <b>citrate</b> and dry extract of couch grass (Agropyrum repens) (CalcoMEV®) in renal stone treatment. Materials and Methods: 50 patients with nephrolithiasis associated with one or more active metabolic alterations that constitute an indication to the use of <b>potassium</b> <b>citrate</b> were randomly divided in two equal unblinded treatment groups. A group of patients was assigned to treatment with the association of <b>potassium</b> <b>citrate</b> and couch grass (at the dose of 24 mEq of <b>potassium</b> <b>citrate</b> and 100 mg of dry extract of Agropyrum repens bis in die) and the other group to <b>potassium</b> <b>citrate</b> (at a dose of 20 mEq ter in die). Each form of main treatment was associated, depending on the results of metabolic basal assessment, to allopurinol and/or an association of amiloride and hydrochlorothiazide and/or pyridoxine. Patients of both groups were advised the same diet based on a reduced intake of sodium, foods rich in oxalate and protein of animal origin, a normalized intake of calcium and an increase in fluid intake (> 2 liters every day). Results: At the end of the 5 -month follow-up period, the group treated with the association of <b>potassium</b> <b>citrate</b> and couch grass showed a significant reduction in the total number of stones (- 1. 0 ± 0. 2 vs 0. 0 ± 0. 2 stones) and in the larger diameter of the stones (- 3. 6 ± 0. 9 mm vs 0. 0 ± 0. 8 mm), as well as a statistically significant reduction of uric acid urinary excretion (- 164. 7 ± 45. 3 vs - 38 ± 42 mg/ 24 h). No significant differences in the two groups were observed with respect to urinary citrate, oxalate and calcium urinary excretions and urinary pH. Conclusions: This prospective randomized study demonstrates the superiority of the association of <b>potassium</b> <b>citrate</b> and dry extract of couch grass, in combination with standard pharmacological and dietary treatment, in reducing the number and size of urinary stones with respect to <b>potassium</b> <b>citrate</b> in association with the same pharmacological and dietary regimen...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Acidosis and {{transplantation}} {{are associated}} with increased risk of bone disturbances. This study aimed to assess bone morphology and metabolism in acidotic patients with a renal graft, and to ameliorate bone characteristics by restoration of acid/base homeostasis with <b>potassium</b> <b>citrate.</b> METHODS: This was a 12 -month controlled, randomized, interventional trial that included 30 renal transplant patients with metabolic acidosis (S-[HCO(3) (-) ] 24 mmol/L, or potassium chloride (control group). Iliac crest bone biopsies and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry were performed at baseline and after 12 months of treatment. Bone biopsies were analyzed by in vitro micro-computed tomography and histomorphometry, including tetracycline double labeling. Serum biomarkers of bone turnover were measured at baseline and study end. Twenty-three healthy participants with normal kidney function comprised the reference group. RESULTS: Administration of <b>potassium</b> <b>citrate</b> resulted in persisting normalization of S-[HCO(3) (-) ] versus potassium chloride. At 12 months, bone surface, connectivity density, cortical thickness, and cortical porosity were better preserved with <b>potassium</b> <b>citrate</b> than with <b>potassium</b> chloride, respectively. Serological biomarkers and bone tetracycline labeling indicate higher bone turnover with <b>potassium</b> <b>citrate</b> versus <b>potassium</b> chloride. In contrast, no relevant changes in bone mineral density were detected by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry.

Urinary content of undissociated uric acid, which was high {{to begin with}} at 204 ± 82 mg/day, decreased to the normal range (64 to 108 mg/day) following treatment. Urinary citrate rose from 503 ± 225 mg/day to 852 to 998 mg/day. Urinary saturation of calcium oxalate significantly declined with <b>potassium</b> <b>citrate</b> treatment. New stone formation rate declined from 1. 20 ± 1. 68 stones/year to 0. 01 ± 0. 04 stones/year (P < 0. 001 by chi square). Remission was experienced in 94. 4 % of patients, and the group stone formation rate declined by 99. 2 %. Detailed case reports were obtained in five patients showing different responses between sodium alkali and potassium alkali treatment. All five patients had persistently low urinary pH (typically < 5. 5) and normouricosuria, and four had hyperuricemia.
