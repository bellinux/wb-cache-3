40|$|We {{discuss the}} {{application}} of Generalized <b>Parity</b> <b>Relations</b> to two experimental flexible space structures, the NASA Langley Mini-Mast and Marshall Space Flight Center ACES mast. We concentrate on the generation of residuals and make no attempt to implement the Decision Function. It should be clear from the examples that are presented {{whether it would be}} possible to detect the failure of a specific component. We derive the equations from Generalized <b>Parity</b> <b>Relations.</b> Two special cases are treated: namely, Single Sensor <b>Parity</b> <b>Relations</b> (SSPR) and Double Sensor <b>Parity</b> <b>Relations</b> (DSPR). Generalized <b>Parity</b> <b>Relations</b> for actuators are also derived. The NASA Langley Mini-Mast and {{the application of}} SSPR and DSPR to a set of displacement sensors located at the tip of the Mini-Mast are discussed. The performance of a reduced order model that includes the first five models of the mast is compared to a set of <b>parity</b> <b>relations</b> that was identified on a set of input-output data. Both time domain and frequency domain comparisons are made. The effect of the sampling period and model order on the performance of the Residual Generators are also discussed. Failure detection experiments where the sensor set consisted of two gyros and an accelerometer are presented. The effects of model order and sampling frequency are again illustrated. The detection of actuator failures is discussed. We use Generalized <b>Parity</b> <b>Relations</b> to monitor control system component failures on the ACES mast. An overview is given of the Failure Detection Filter and experimental results are discussed. Conclusions and directions for future research are given...|$|R
40|$|One {{approach}} to fault detection and identification (FDI) in control systems {{is based on}} computing the so-called <b>parity</b> <b>relations</b> for sensors and actuators. We state the problem of generating those <b>parity</b> <b>relations</b> {{in the language of}} constraints, and describe an implementation of a parity solver in the Constraint Programming Language CLP(!). The solver adopts a discrete linear time-invariant (LTI) model of control systems, and outputs a set of single-component <b>parity</b> <b>relations.</b> We describe a FDI procedure, also in CLP(!), that monitors system behavior and computes singlefault diagnoses. The CLP approach enhances the naturalness of representation of system relations, and makes use of the resolution capability of CLP both for deriving <b>parity</b> <b>relations</b> and for making diagnostic decisions. An example is given to illustrate the viability of the CLP approach. This work was supported by the Austrian "Fonds zur Forderung der wissenschaftlichen Forschung" under grant P 9426 -PHY.

5000|$|First, 4 April Call options {{contracts}} with strikes nearest to current stock price (spot) are selected—they {{are used to}} calculate IV Index for April. [...] "IVX Call April" [...] is their weighted average, where weighting is by Vega (option price sensitivity {{to a change in}} implied volatility). Some of these options, however, can be considered [...] "bad" [...] and filtered out of further calculations. For example, options with expiry less than 1 week from now are always discarded. The other check is that so-called put-call <b>parity</b> <b>relation</b> should not vary significantly.

The upper bound of the American-style put-call <b>parity</b> <b>relation</b> is adjusted upwards by the amount of the present value of expected dividends.

40|$|Many {{applications}} {{require that}} a control {{system must be}} tolerant {{to the failure of}} its components. This is especially true for large space-based systems that must work unattended and with long periods between maintenance. Fault tolerance can be obtained by detecting the failure of the control system component, determining which component has failed, and reconfiguring the system so that the failed component is isolated from the controller. Component failure detection experiments that were conducted on an experimental space structure, the NASA Langley Mini-Mast are presented. Two methodologies for failure detection and isolation (FDI) exist that do not require the specification of failure modes and are applicable to both actuators and sensors. These methods are known as the Failure Detection Filter and the method of Generalized <b>Parity</b> <b>Relations.</b> The latter method was applied to three different sensor types on the Mini-Mast. Failures were simulated in input-output data that were recorded during operation of the Mini-Mast.

40|$|In this paper, a set-membership parity space {{approach}} for linear uncertain dynamic systems is proposed.

On the other hand, fault detection is then based on checking, at every sample time, the non existence of a parameter value in the parameter uncertainty set such that the model is consistent with all the system measurements. The proposed approach is applied to two examples: a first illustrative case study based on a two-tank system and a more realistic case study based on the wind turbine FDI benchmark in order to evaluate its effectiveness...|$|R

40|$|Cointegration {{analysis}} of a productivity-modified purchasing power <b>parity</b> <b>relation</b> supports the hypothesis that—in the long run—the nominal exchange rate adjusts to accommodate different national rates of productivity growth in the traded goods sector. Accordingly, in the long run, an absence of exchange rate flexibility combined with productivity growth differentials is likely to generate an intractable adjustment problem. Because Germany and France display a similar evolution of productivity, this analysis supports their participation in monetary union, whereas a markedly different pattern of productivity growth in the UK constitutes an argument against membership. In passing, we find empirical support for Michael Porter's hypothesis that continuous devaluation can reduce the rate of productivity growth. This also has implications for UK membership. ...|$|E
