The implementation of ERTMS in Sweden is performed by Trafikverket and two pilot projects have been done. Now the experiences from the traffic managements for these <b>pilot</b> <b>tracks</b> must be preserved. The purpose of this master thesis was to identify key aspects to facilitate the implementation of ERTMS for the traffic management in Sweden. The main task was to collect the experiences from the introduction of ERTMS on the <b>pilot</b> <b>tracks</b> from the traffic management in Ånge and Boden. The problems that occurred before, {{during and after the}} implementation process of ERTMS on the <b>pilot</b> <b>tracks</b> have been identified and further recommendations have been developed for how these problems can be avoided and managed in the upcoming implementation of the remaining tracks in Sweden. The main contribution of the thesis is recommendations to Trafikverket on how to facilitate the ERTMS implementation process for the traffic management. The key recommendations are: That the technology works and that the traffic management has the opportunity to influence the development of new versions of the system. That the traffic management should be informed about the project and involved in the implementation process. That the education and practice for the traffic management in ERTMS will satisfy their need in terms of adapted material and that they have access to an ERTMS simulator. If Trafikverket takes into consideration the problems that have occurred and work out solutions for how to manage and avoid them in the upcoming implementation of ERTMS in Sweden, the outcome should be successful...|$|R

Our results were substantially above the medians for all categories. We found that major improvements for German retrieval derived from successful blind feedback (between 53 and 72 percent improvement in MAP depending upon the run type) rather than decompounding of German compound words. Manual expansion of geographic references (e. g. Europe to individual country names) was disastrous to retrieval performance. Clearly, successful geographic information retrieval will require substantially more research to improve upon heuristic approaches...|$|E

The purpose of GeoCLEF is to test and evaluate cross-language geographic information retrieval (GIR) : retrieval for topics with a geographic specification. For GeoCLEF 2006, twenty-five search topics were defined by the organizing groups for searching English, German, Portuguese and Spanish document collections. Topics were translated into English, German, Portuguese, Spanish and Japanese. Several topics in 2006 were significantly more geographically challenging than in 2005. Seventeen groups submitted 149 runs (up from eleven groups and 117 runs in GeoCLEF 2005). The groups {{used a variety of}} approaches, including geographic bounding boxes, named entity extraction and external knowledge bases (geographic thesauri and ontologies and gazetteers). ...|$|E

We have ported AFNER, the NE recogniser of the AnswerFinder questionanswering project, to the set of answer types expected in the QAst track. AFNER uses a combination of regular expressions, lists of names (gazetteers) and machine learning to find NeWS in the data. The machine learning component was trained on a development set of the AMI corpus. In the process we identified various problems with scalability of the system and the existence of errors of the extracted annotation, which lead to relatively poor performance in general. Performance was yet comparable with state of the art, and the system was second (out of three participants) in one of the QAst subtasks. ...|$|E
