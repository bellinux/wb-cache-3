2500|$|Mr Dinos {{was then}} aimed, as expected, at the Group One Ascot Gold Cup over {{two and a}} half miles. The {{build-up}} to the race was exceptionally difficult for Paul Cole as seventy percent of the horses at Whatcombe were affected by a viral infection and Mr Dinos had to be kept in isolation, attended only by his stable lad Tom Pirie. Kieren Fallon took over the ride in Gold Cup 19 June and Mr Dinos started 3/1 second favourite behind his old rival Mamool. Black Sam Bellamy, Pole Star, Kasthari and Persian Punch were again in the field whilst the other runners were Fight Your Corner (Chester Vase), Tholjanah (Noel Murless Stakes), Jardines Lookout (Goodwood Cup), Savannah Bay (Prix de Lutece), Pugin (runner-up in the Irish St Leger) and Alcazar. Persian <b>Punch</b> <b>set</b> the pace with Mr Dinos settling third before moving up into second place with nine furlongs left to run. Fallon sent the colt into the lead three furlongs out and Mr Dinos [...] "forged clear" [...] in the straight to win [...] "easily" [...] by six lengths from Persian Punch. After the race Fallon said [...] "I rode a horse who could take me there. He travelled well, he travelled all the way, even though he was a bit lazy. When I switched him on he found another gear and that's the sign of a good horse". Cole commented [...] "I've never had a runner in the Gold Cup and it's a race I've always wanted to win.

A 3/4 inch conduit size punch actually punches a hole that is approximately 1.1 inches diameter for 3/4 nominal size conduit. A dimensional size punch makes a hole very close to the indicated size. <b>Punch</b> <b>sets</b> are available on both imperial and metric sizes.|$|R

50|$|Die and <b>punch</b> <b>sets</b> can be {{used for}} thicker {{materials}} or materials that require large holes; this process is the most common for metalworking. The workpiece is sheared by pressing (either by machine or hand tool) the punch through the workpiece and into the die. The middle section of the workpiece is scrap; commonly known as the chad in paper and similar materials. The punch and die are shaped to produce the desired shaped hole. The clearance (the distance between the outside circumference of the punch and the inner circumference of the die) must be properly maintained to ensure a clean cut. Burrs are produced {{on the side of the}} workpiece that is against the die.|$|R

5000|$|The IBM 1400 {{series are}} character-addressable machines, each {{location}} being six bits labeled B, A, 8, 4, 2 and 1, plus an {{odd parity check}} bit (C) and a word mark bit (M). For encoding digits 1 through 9, B and A are zero and the digit value represented by standard 4-bit BCD in bits 8 through 1. For most other characters bits B and A are derived simply from the [...] "12", [...] "11", and [...] "0" [...] "zone punches" [...] in the punched card character code, and bits 8 through 1 from the 1 through 9 punches. A [...] "12 zone" [...] <b>punch</b> <b>set</b> both B and A, an [...] "11 zone" [...] set B, and a [...] "0 zone" [...] (a 0 punch combined with any others) set A. Thus the letter A, which is (12,1) in the punched card format, is encoded (B,A,1). The currency symbol $, (11,8,3) in the punched card, was encoded in memory as (B,8,2,1).

One important special case is digit 0, represented by a lone 0 punch in the card, and (8,2) in core memory.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A {{finite element}} inverse {{analysis}} is utilized to consider forming {{effects of an}} S-rail on the crashworthiness with small amount of computation time. A crash analysis can be directly performed after the inverse simulation of a forming process without a smoothing or remeshing scheme.

The finite element inverse analysis is proved to be an effective tool in consideration of forming effects for the crash analysis...|$|E

40|$|For {{the first}} time, a superconducting solenoid (SCM) {{was used to}} {{increase}} the remnant magnetization of sintered NdFeB permanent magnets (PMs). In particular, improved magnetic alignment of commercial-grade PM powder was achieved, as it was axial die pressed into 12. 7 -mm diameter cylindrical compacts in the 76. 2 -mm warm bore of a 9 -T SCM. The press used to compact the powder is unique and was specifically designed for use with the SCM. Although the press was operated in the batch mode for this proof of concept study, its design is intended to enable automated production. In operation, a simple die and <b>punch</b> <b>set</b> made of nonmagnetic materials was filled with powder and loaded into a nonmagnetic press tube. The cantilevered press tube was inserted horizontally, on a carrier manually advanced along a track, into the SCM. The robustness of the mechanical components and the SCM, in its liquid helium dewar, were specifically designed to allow for insertion and extraction of the magnetic powder and compacts, while operating at 9 T. Compaction was achieved by pressing the punches between the closed end of the press tube and the hydraulic cylinder mounted on the opposite end. Improvements up to 10 % in magnetization and 20 % in energy products of the permanent magnets were obtained, as the alignment fields were increased above the 2 -T maximum field of the electromagnets used in industry. Increases in magnetization of 3 % are significant in the mature sintered magnet industry...|$|E
