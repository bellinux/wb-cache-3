5|$|Children with high-functioning autism {{suffer from}} more intense and {{frequent}} loneliness compared to non-autistic peers, despite the common belief {{that children with}} autism <b>prefer</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> alone. Making and maintaining friendships often proves to be difficult for those with autism. For them, the quality of friendships, not the number of friends, predicts how lonely they feel. Functional friendships, such as those resulting in invitations to parties, may {{affect the quality of}} life more deeply.|$|E

Sandro pays for Tiny's boxing training in hopes of his becoming a professional boxer, although Tiny would <b>prefer</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> an artist.|$|E
5|$|The {{obligation}} {{of a professional}} medical care provider to alleviate suffering may occasionally come into conflict with the obligation to prolong life. If a terminally ill person prefers to be painless, despite {{a high level of}} sedation and a risk of shortening their life, they should be provided with their desired pain relief (despite the cost of sedation and a possibly slightly shorter life). Where a person is unable to be involved in this type of decision, the law and the medical profession in the United Kingdom allow the doctor to assume that the person would <b>prefer</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> painless, and thus the provider may prescribe and administer adequate analgesia, even if the treatment may slightly hasten death. It is taken that the underlying cause of death in this case is the illness and not the necessary pain management.|$|E

25|$|Negative {{effects of}} {{solitude}} may also depend on age. Elementary age school children who experience frequent solitude may react negatively. This is largely because, often, solitude {{at this age}} is not something chosen by the child. Solitude in elementary-age children may occur when they are unsure of how to interact socially with others so they <b>prefer</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> alone, causing shyness or social rejection.|$|E

A 1993 study published in FDA Consumer found that 50% of Americans believed fillings containing mercury caused health problems. Some dentists (including {{a member of the}} FDA's Dental Products Panel) suggest that there is an obligation to inform patients that amalgam contains mercury.|$|E
25|$|When one is {{considering}} allylic strain, {{one needs to}} consider the possible conformers and the possible stereoelectronic demand of the reaction. For example, in the conformation of (Z)-4-methylpent-2-ene, the molecule isn't frozen in the favored conformer but rotates in the dihedral angle around 30° at <1kcal/mol cost. In stereoselective reactions, there are 2 effects of allylic strain on the reaction which is the sterics effect and the electronic effects. The sterics effect is where the largest group <b>prefer</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the farthest from the alkene. The electronic effect is where the orbitals of the subsituents prefer to align anti or outside of the orbitals depending on the reaction.|$|E

25|$|In 2001, Al-Muhajiroun, a banned and {{now defunct}} {{international}} organization who sought {{the establishment of}} a global Islamic caliphate, issued a fatwa declaring that all members of Al-Fatiha were murtadd, or apostates, and condemning them to death. Because of the threat and coming from conservative societies, many members of the foundation's site still <b>prefer</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> anonymous so as to protect their identity while continuing a tradition of secrecy. Al-Fatiha has fourteen chapters in the United States, as well as offices in England, Canada, Spain, Turkey, and South Africa. In addition, Imaan, a social support group for Muslim LGBT people and their families, exists in the UK. Both of these groups were founded by gay Pakistani activists.|$|E
25|$|Wooden cages made of tiny {{rods and}} planks were once {{the most common}} type of insect house. The people of Shanghai and Hangzhou areas still use stool-shaped cages for keeping captive grasshoppers. Elsewhere, cages were {{historically}} used for keeping captive cicadas. They were suspended outdoors, at the eaves of the houses and from tree branches. Their use declined when the Chinese concentrated on keeping crickets. Small cages are still used for transporting crickets. Some are curved to follow the shape of a human body; crickets need warmth and <b>prefer</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> kept close to the body. The cage is placed in a tao, a kind of protective silk bag, and is ideally carried in the pocket of a shirt. A special type of funnel-shaped wire mesh cage is used to temporarily contain the cricket while its main home is being cleaned.|$|E

Amidst negotiations for the British departure from India, the Congress party agreed to the partition of India on the provision that a referendum was held to ascertain whether NWFP would <b>prefer</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> part of the new state of Pakistan or India. Realising they were in an untenable position the KK movement decided to boycott the referendum which allowed a landsliding victory for the Pakistan vote.over 99% votes were in favor of Pakistan. The KK movement faced a backlash from the new Pakistani government following partition, its government was dismissed and the movement banned.|$|E
