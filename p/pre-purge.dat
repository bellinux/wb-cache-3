However, in the Star Wars Rebels episode [...] "Path of the Jedi", Kanan Jarrus stated: [...] "...There were around 10,000 Jedi Knights defending the galaxy. Now, we are few. But in those days, we had small outposts, temples spread throughout the stars. The Empire sought out these temples and destroyed many of them..." ...|$|E
50|$|On Wednesday 6 December Colonel Pride’s Regiment of Foot took up {{position}} on the stairs leading to the House, while Nathaniel Rich’s Regiment of Horse provided backup. Pride himself stood {{at the top of}} the stairs. As MPs arrived, he checked them against the list provided to him; Lord Grey of Groby helped to identify those to be arrested and those to be prevented from entering. The purge was not over in one day, and a military watch was kept on the entrance until 12 December. By then 45 members had been imprisoned of which 25 were released before Christmas. It is not known exactly how many were excluded as many, once they heard of the purge, voluntarily stayed away, either because they feared they would be arrested but more usually as a sign of protest. <b>Pre-purge</b> the number of members who were still eligible to sit in the house was 507 but 18 seats were vacant and a further 18 members had not sat for a long time which meant that there were 471 active members. After the purge just over 200 members sat in what would become known as the Rump Parliament. Of the 200, 86 absented themselves voluntarily, 83 were allowed back in Parliament after formally dissenting from the decision to accept the King's proposals, and 71 were supporters of the army from the outset (see List of MPs not excluded from the English parliament in 1648).|$|E
30|$|To retard the {{oxidation}} of Ag-NW, TiO 2 barrier was uniformly deposited by {{an atomic}} layer deposition (ALD) system. Titanium (IV) isopropoxide (TTIP, UPChem) {{was used as the}} Ti precursor and H 2 O was employed as the oxygen source. High purity Ar was used a purge gas and to carry the TTIP. Each cycle of deposition was comprised of 10  s of <b>pre-purging,</b> 3  s of TTIP source injection, and 1  s of H 2 O flow.|$|R
30|$|In {{contrast}} to the batch experiments, there are two publications working with an anaerobic sequencing batch reactor (ASBR). In the study of Angenent et al. [4], a 5 -L ASBR was run by sequencing through a feed step, a react step, a settling step, and a decant step. An intermittent mixing process was thereby performed by biogas recycling. Tylosin half-life experiments were conducted by taking manure from the ASBR, placing it into capped 5 -mL glass serum vials (<b>pre-purged</b> with N 2), and spiking with tylosin. The vials were stored for a duration of 48  h at a temperature of 25  °C in a water bath. Cetecioglu et al. [14] also used an ASBR with a 24 -h cycle to measure the impact of tetracycline on biogas production and the biodegradation of a synthetic organic substrate. In {{contrast to}} Angenent et al. [4], they monitored the tetracycline mass balance between the influent and the effluent of the ASBR considering the sludge inside the ASBR. With this setup, {{it was not possible}} to determine DT 50 values. Huang et al. [29] and Wang et al. [72] also worked with a kind of ASBR. Riemenschneider et al. [57] worked with both a batch experiment and a constant feeding experiment using a 20 -L laboratory-scale reactor. Grote et al. [21] only conducted the transformation study with a realistic outdoor scenario, working with chlortetracycline (CTC), sulfadiazine (SDZ), and trimethoprim (TMP). The medicated pigs excreted the pharmaceuticals over a long period of time, thus all relevant metabolites were considered. It is not easily possible to determine DT 50 values for this approach, but it is possible to study the realistic transformation of a pharmaceutical.|$|R
40|$|In general, {{volatile}} organic compounds in ambient air are quantified by following a well-defined standard calibration procedure using a gas-/liquid-phase standard. If the liquid standard is analyzed by a thermal desorption, the solvent effect is unavoidable through the alteration of breakthrough properties or retention times. To {{learn more about the}} variables of the thermal desorption-based analysis, the effect of <b>pre-purge</b> conditions was evaluated for 18 {{volatile organic}} compounds with different types of sorbent tube materials by fixing standard volume (1 mu L) and flow rate (100 mL/min). The gas phase calibration was also carried out as reference for the non-solvent effect. A single tube filled with Tenax TA exhibited the least solvent effect with the short <b>pre-purge</b> (1 min), while being subject to the breakthrough at or above 10 min <b>pre-purge.</b> For a three-bed sorbent tube with Carboxen 1000, at least 10 min of <b>pre-purge</b> was needed for the compounds with a retention time close to methanol (e. g., propanal). Another three-bed tube with Carbopack X reduced the solvent effect efficiently for a short <b>pre-purge</b> (2 min) without the breakthrough. As such, the solvent effect can be adjusted by the proper control of the sorbent tube application.

40|$|The {{electrical}} and structural properties of Mg delta-doped GaN epilayers grown by MOCVD were investigated. Compared to uniform Mg-doping GaN layers, {{it has been}} shown that the delta-doping (delta-doping) process could suppress the dislocation density and enhance the p-type performance. The influence of <b>pre-purge</b> step on the structural properties of GaN was also investigated. The hole concentration of p-GaN decreases when using a <b>pre-purge</b> step. These results can be explained convincingly using a simple model of impurity incorporation under Ga-free growth condition. (C) 2007 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|When a {{building}} is {{used only for}} intermittent occupancy, continuous operation of ventilation system is not necessary for achieving good indoor air quality during the occupation periods. Such buildings have a great energy saving potential which is not harnessed enough yet. Indeed, energy loss can be avoided by promoting natural means and managing mechanical ones. Therefore, control strategies based on time and/or occupancy scheduled ventilation associated to <b>pre-purge</b> ventilation constitute a key for an energy efficient ventilation system. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to provide recommendations on the management and the control of ventilation systems in case of intermittent occupancy. Thus, several surveys and experimentations were carried out using both ENTPE classrooms and an experimental apparatus in order to characterize existing ventilation systems and to test our control strategies. Those strategies have been developed and tuned using a simulation tool (HYBCELL) based on finite differences and pressure air flow models...|$|E
40|$|Residential gas {{furnaces}} contain blowers {{to distribute}} warm air. Currently, furnace blowers use either a Permanent Split Capacitor (PSC) or a Brushless Permanent Magnet (BPM) motor. Blowers {{account for the}} majority of furnace electricity consumption. Therefore, accurate determination of the blower electricity consumption is important for understanding electricity consumption of furnaces. The electricity consumption of blower motors depends on the static pressure across the blower. This paper examines both types of blower motors in non-condensing non-weatherized gas furnaces at a range of static pressures. Fan performance data is based on manufacturer product literature and laboratory tests. We use field-measured static pressure in ducts to get typical system curves to calculate how furnaces would operate in the field. We contrast this with the electricity consumption of a furnace blower operating under the DOE test procedure and manufacturer rated conditions. Furnace electricity use is also affected by operating modes that happen {{at the beginning and end}} of each furnace firing cycle. These operating modes are the <b>pre-purge</b> and post-purge by the draft inducer, the on-delay and off-delay of the blower, and the hot surface ignitor operation. To accurately calculate this effect, we use the number of firing cycles in a typical California house in the Central Valley of California. Cooling hours are not considered in the DOE test procedure. We also account for furnace blower use by the air conditioner and stand-by power. Overall BPM motors outperform PSC motors, but the total electricity savings are significantly less than projected using the DOE test procedure conditions. The performance gains depend on the static pressure of the household ducts, which are typically much higher than in the test procedures...|$|E
