25|$|The wave peel {{angle is}} one of the main {{constituents}} of a potential surfing wave. Wave peel angle measures the distance between the peel-line and the line tangent to the breaking crest line. This angle controls the speed of the wave crest.

50|$|The last {{technique}} {{can be used}} {{to measure}} the seismic anisotropy is related to the sonic logging information of a deviated well. In a deviated well, the wave <b>propagation</b> <b>velocity</b> is higher than the wave <b>propagation</b> <b>velocity</b> in a vertical well at the same depth. This difference in velocity between deviated well and vertical well reflects the anisotropy parameters of the rocks near the borehole.

40|$|Mining induced {{seismicity}} {{can lead to}} bumps which cause problems at many mines within the United States and around the world. This seismicity, {{often referred to as}} bumps or bursts, can result in injuries, fatalities, and expensive capital damage and production interruptions. There are many factors that contribute to mining {{induced seismicity}} but there is still no concrete method to forecast future seismic activity around a mine. One of the main precursors to large seismic events is an increase in situ stress. One way to find areas within geological strata that are highly stressed is to measure p-wave <b>propagation</b> <b>velocities.</b> High p-wave <b>propagation</b> <b>velocities</b> are associated with high in-situ stress levels. By using tomography programs a three-dimensional velocity model can be constructed. When seismic activity is present the event arrival times at each geophone, the locations of each geophone, and the three dimensional velocity model are used in conjunction with one another to locate the seismic events.

40|$|Pulse {{broadening}} for optical solitons due to birefringence is investigated. We {{present an}} analytical solution which describes {{the propagation of}} solitons in birefringent optical fibers. The special solutions consist {{of a combination of}} purely solitonic terms propagating along the principal birefringence axes and soliton-soliton interaction terms. The solitonic part of the solutions indicates that the decay of initially localized pulses could be due to different <b>propagation</b> <b>velocities</b> along the birefringence axes. We show that the disintegration of solitonic pulses in birefringent optical fibers can be caused by two effects. The first effect is similar as in linear birefringence and is related to the unequal <b>propagation</b> <b>velocities</b> of the modes along the birefringence axes. The second effect is related to the nonlinear soliton-soliton interaction between the modes, which makes the solitonic pulse-shape blurred.

50|$|The {{electromagnetic}} wave carried by a microstrip line exists partly in the dielectric substrate, and partly {{in the air}} above it. In general, the dielectric constant of the substrate will be different (and greater) than that of the air, so that the wave is travelling in an inhomogeneous medium. In consequence, the <b>propagation</b> <b>velocity</b> is somewhere between the speed of radio waves in the substrate, and the speed of radio waves in air. This behaviour is commonly described by stating the effective dielectric constant (or effective relative permittivity) of the microstrip; this being the dielectric constant of an equivalent homogeneous medium (i.e., one resulting in the same <b>propagation</b> <b>velocity).</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The goal of {{this paper}} is to {{determine}} the bulk acoustic wave (BAW) <b>propagation</b> <b>velocities</b> (quasi-longitudinal, quasi-shear vertical and quasi-shear horizontal) in two important piezoelectric smart materials, Lithium Niobate (LiNbO 3) and Lithium Tantalate (LiTaO 3). To determine the BAW <b>propagation</b> <b>velocities,</b> the BAW elemental equations are deduced. The BAW velocities are calculated for each direction by solving the Christoffel’s equation systematically based on the theory of acoustic waves in anisotropic solids exhibiting piezoelectricity. The modification of the BAW velocities by the piezoelectric effect are calculated and graphically compared with the velocities in the corresponding non-piezoelectric materials. Furthermore, the electromechanical coupling factors are defined and investigated. The results obtained in this study can be applied to signal processing, sound systems and wireless communication in addition to the improvement of surface acoustic wave (SAW) devices and military defense equipment...|$|R

40|$|Experiments were {{performed}} to determine the plasma <b>propagation</b> <b>velocities</b> resulting from KrF laser irradiation of copper wire target (75 microns diameter) and water droplets (75 microns diameter) at irradiance levels ranging from 25 to 150 GW/sq cm. Plasma <b>propagation</b> <b>velocities</b> were measured using a streak camera system oriented orthogonally to the high-energy laser <b>propagation</b> axis. Plasma <b>velocities</b> were studied {{as a function of}} position in the focused beam. Results show that both the shape of the plasma formation and material removal from the copper wire are different and depend on whether the targets are focused or slightly defocused (approximately = 0. 5 mm movement in the beam axis). Plasma formation and its position relative to the target {{is an important factor in}} determining the practical focal point during high-energy laser interaction with materials. At irradiance of 100 GW/sq cm, the air plasma has two weak-velocity components which propagate toward and away from the incident laser while a strong-velocity component propagates away from the laser beam as a detonation wave. Comparison of the measured breakdown velocities (in the range of 2. 22 - 2. 27 x 10 (exp 5) m/s) for air and the value calculated by the nonlinear breakdown wave theory at irradiance of 100 GW/sq cm showed a quantitative agreement within approximately 50 % while the linear theory and Gaussian pulse theory failed.
