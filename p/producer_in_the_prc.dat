Strong political control governed diagnosis and treatment as well as detention and discharge of mental patients during the Cultural Revolution (1964 - 1976). Later, because of modernization and reform advocated by Deng Xiao-ping, western models of treatment and rehabilitation were gradually introduced by psychiatrists <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>PRC.</b> Nevertheless, dilemmas such as human rights versus political control, community integration versus community control, diversity versus centrality, huge demand but inadequate services seemed to challenge the further development of the mental health service <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>PRC.</b> Department of Applied Social Science...|$|R

The main factors causing <b>the</b> <b>PRC’s</b> high energy use and intensity are (i) an inappropriate pricing regime with inadequate market-based signals for energy conservation, (ii) energy-intensive industrial output accounting for a high share of GDP, (iii) poor fuel consumption mix, (iv) use of obsolete industrial technologies, and (v) poor energy management. <b>The</b> <b>PRC</b> is <b>the</b> second largest electricity <b>producer</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> world.

40|$|The rapid {{economic}} growth of the People’s Republic of China (<b>PRC)</b> over <b>the</b> last 30 years has generated many environmental problems and a concomitant rise <b>in</b> <b>the</b> number of environmental disputes.
