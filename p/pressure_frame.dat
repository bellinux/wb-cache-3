High <b>pressure</b> <b>frame</b> assembly is a leak proof container design to hold precious electronics at a pressure substantially {{different from the}} abient pressure. Design is carired according to American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) code,deals with the study of various parts like flanges,support etc. various methods of facbrication and testing are also included. Using PRO-E software different 3 D models are generated and analysised by using ANSYS software, a versatile Finite Element pakage. The final AHU “(Antenna Head Unit) ” frame assembly has to be designed in a tradeoff between strength, weight maintenance and thermal aspects. To overcome the problems in existing rectangle cross sectional vessel design, in our proposed design the stresses developed in the circular cross section with hemispherical end caps are very less as compared to rectangle cross sectional vessel. Also in the circular cross section, the stresses and deflections are minimum. and from the results Factor of safety in the case with hemispherical end caps is 1. 8...|$|E

40|$|Abstract- Tactile imaging uses {{a passive}} {{pressure}} sensitive sensor {{to record the}} reaction pressure distribution on its surface. When pressed into and scanned over tissue of interest, it generates an image that {{is dependent on the}} mechanical properties and geometric distribution of the structures within the tissue. Since pathology is related to tissue stiffness, stiffness measurement would be of great use to provide insight into disease processes and an aid to diagnosis. We have developed an algorithm that inverts the tactile image and determines the salient features of the underlying tissue. The features of interest are the stiffness and depth of the background tissue and the stiffness and size of a round inclusion. A finite element model was constructed in order to simulate the tactile imaging process. The analysis was performed on models spanning an experimentally determined range of material properties. By analyzing each <b>pressure</b> <b>frame</b> and performing a least-squares fit between the pressure frames and the model features we were able to determine an inverse relationship to extract tissue stiffness from tactile frames...|$|E

A soil barrier- 24 mm thick, polyethylene plastic- 2 mm thick with centered 5 mm hole simulated the circular defected geomembrane and a 225 mm thick buffering profile (BP) completed the experimental setup. A Modular Consolidometer-Percolation Column Hybrid model of 160 mm diameter is coupled to a hydraulic <b>pressure</b> <b>frame</b> capable of applying up to 1000 kPa pressure to the liner. Leakages through barrier-BP system were evaluated for tests under pressure of up to 150 kPa. Measured leakage rates for good geomembrane/soil interface contact conditions {{were found to be}} valid whereas that of a perfect contact condition was unachievable in this study. However, outcomes show notable reduction in leakage rates with increased pressure, p, on the geomembrane. This is plausibly due to reduced barrier system transmissivity, θ, and densification of the barrier. Concentrations of dreaded Organic matter in the BP after percolation tests confirmed leakage through the defected polyethylene-soil liner and showed poor buffering abilities of three natural soils investigated in this study to migrating organics...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the role of}} institutional context in shaping policy agendas through {{a case study of}} the World’s Bank’s gender lending in Ecuador. Using interviews with employees and analysis of policy texts I explore the complex institutional location of Bank gender policymakers, identifying two key constraints on their policy output: 1. the <b>pressure</b> to <b>frame</b> gender policy using appeals to productivity and efficiency, and 2. the <b>pressure</b> to <b>frame</b> gender policy as producing complementary sharing between men and women. Given that the efficiency constraint has been much debated in feminist Bank scholarship I explicate the complementarity constraint in more detail. Specifically, I argue that the institutional pressure to define gender policy through a complementary focus on couples led poor men to become hyper-visible as irresponsible partners, and as the crux of the gender policy problem. In turn Bank gender policy was focused on efforts to change them, by encouraging their loving attachment to family and willingness to do domestic labor. I see cause for concern at the dominance of these policy solutions, and I consider how to facilitate their contestation in closing...|$|R
40|$|Play {{is valued}} conceptually and pedagogically, {{although}} {{its place in}} early years settings is under increasing <b>pressure.</b> <b>Framed</b> by the sociology of childhood and understandings of children’s agency, this article reports on an ethnographic study with children aged {{five years in the}} first year of primary school in Australia. The study investigated children’s understandings of play in classroom activities involving different periods of teacher-framed and child-selected activities. Drawing on children’s accounts and video-recorded observations, the study found that children’s participation was influenced by teacher-framed agendas, and the agency afforded to them to engage in self-chosen activities and to design and negotiate their play spaces. For instance, children generally were unenthusiastic about writing activities and called these activities ‘work’ if they were directed by the teacher, and yet they consistently chose to engage in writing activities during periods of freely chosen activities. The findings raise questions about what counts as ‘play’ and ‘work’ for children, and the important function of play and free choice to mobilise participation in foundational academic activities such as writing. These understandings generate opportunities for educators to reflect upon ways to enhance children’s participation in everyday play activities in the classroom as supporting foundational academic activities...|$|R

In the theoretical part, brief overview of behavioral economics and its contributions to health economics is outlined. Additionally, direct application of nudging concepts and behavioral features in healthcare is illustrated, primarily focused on the vaccination issue. In the analytical part, two neighboring countries have been chosen for the research, Austria and Czech Republic and their regions Vorarlberg, Prague and South Bohemia. Their rates of vaccination based on data gathered from both private institutions as well as public sources were compared using documentary comparative analysis as a research method. Two hypotheses were set for testing: (1) Czech mandatory vaccination policy against measles had been historically more effective than Austrian opt-in system and (2) Choice architecture had profound effect on levels of coverage. None of the hypotheses was refuted. Research was narrowed down to examination of measles due to data availability. In final part, implications from findings were elaborated on.

Studies show that universe is accelerating its rate of expansion. Here I am trying to get some conclusions according to my thoughts. In my opinion, our universe is under a gravitational frame with all the matters in it. In this gravitational frame of universe we can consider our universe as a closed system and the empty space outside the frame as an open system. There are two possibilities we can find. One is relative motion of the objects inside the frame. By this way we can feel the universe is accelerating its expansion, but it is not. Another one is the vacuum energy absorption and negative <b>pressure</b> inside the <b>frame.</b> According to this thought, we can say that universe is accelerating and it can continue its motion at present conditions on it, even the force created by the big bang is decreasing. The other point is that, once the absorbed vacuum can create a negative <b>pressure</b> inside the <b>frame,</b> {{there is no need for}} the concept of dark energy in our universe [1]. According to this model, negative <b>pressure</b> inside the <b>frame</b> will be created by the absorbed vacuum from the space. So the existence of dark energy can be questioned. In this model, dark energy doesn't play any role in the expansion or rate of acceleratio...|$|R

30|$|SCU {{patterns}} of chromatophore genome of P. chromatophora and S. elongatus may be {{closely associated with}} living habitats. The adapted habitat of P. chromatophora is a submerged vegetation in freshwater. Mud loving nature of this organism protects it from potential extrinsic mutagens like UV-B radiation and which in turn causes genome wide mutation as reported in Prochlorococcus (Partensky et al. 1999). Freshwater β – cyanobacterium S. elongatus PCC 6301 is less adaptive to varying environments as it resides strictly in euphotic zones, relatively with low nutrient contents at mesophilic temperature (Waterbury et al. 1986) unlike marine Synechococcus which is more adaptive to grow in varying nutrient conditions and temperatures (Moore et al. 1998). To make marine Synechococcus more adaptive to environment, translational selection shapes the codon usage patterns (Yu et al. 2012) but mutational <b>pressure</b> <b>frames</b> codon usage in less adaptive fresh water S. elongatus. Closely related species, living in distinct environments may exhibit considerable genomic diversity (Paul et al. 2010) that lead to differences in factors behind diversification of SCU patterns. Mutational pressure {{was found to be}} the major factor, influencing SCU pattern across PCG in strictly thermophilic cyanobacterium Thermosynechococcus elongatus BP- 1 (Prabha et al. 2012) which is less adaptive to other temperature ranges as growth of thermophiles is restricted to particular environment at specific temperature (Botzman and Margalit 2011). These reports support our finding that SCU pattern of P. chromatophora and S. elongatus is dictated by mutational pressure due to their less adaptation to varying environments.|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} is a {{case study}} of an English Department at a leading university in Tirana, Albania that investigates the Higher Education reforms resulting from the Albanian Government???s commitment to the Bologna Agreement and the subsequent reforms in English Language Education. Both reforms are products of emerging neoliberal global trends, designed to produce a new kind of English-speaking human capital with the necessary knowledge and skills to ensure successful national and individual competition in the global markets. The globalization of English and diverse global <b>pressures</b> <b>framed</b> the study. These global pressures gave rise to both continuity and change in policies related to English Language Education and guided the Albanian Higher Education reforms. As a higher education institution involved in the negotiation, interpretation, and implementation of higher education reforms as well as those in the English Language Education due to the centrality of ELT and the training of English teachers for all levels of education, the English Department was the perfect research site. The study findings shed light on the Albanian manifestations of global processes and policies, shaped by the local history, economy, politics, and cultural traditions as well as by institutional features such as organizational arrangements and practices, the faculty and students, university key administrators, all with their respective roles in policy negotiation, interpretation, and implementation. Further the findings highlight the influence of the European Union and other similar organizations on the Higher Education and English Language Education polices of Albania, which led to the reorganization of curricula and increasing demands for faculty professional development. Such effects were in response to policy discourses that emphasized the preparation of young Albanians to be successfully mobile within European and global education institutions and labor markets. The study has implications for the understanding and the development of higher education not only in Albania but also in countries with a similar history, economy, and politics which have to negotiate, interpret, and implement in their national and local arenas policies driven by global trends, policies, and organizations...|$|R

40|$|The main {{objective}} of this thesis was to increase the yield of first-class exterior cladding by improving the drying process. Secondary objectives was to investigate how the drying process at AB Hilmer Andersson works today {{and how it can}} be improved to get better drying results and thereby yields. The work has been performed at AB Hilmer Andersson, a sawmill / planing mill located in western Värmland. The end product of the yield measurement was measured on sawed rectangular spruce panel 19 x 148, sawn from planks with dimensions 63 x 150. The work began with interviews to find out what is problematic with the drying and which drying damages that is most common at AB Hilmer Andersson. The most common problems was poorly sticked packages, kilns are not charged accurate and that the conditioning equipment was not working. The most common drying damages was warping and cracking. Through theoretical studies of drying solutions to drying damages were identified, and new drying schedules were developed to compare with existing drying. The new schedules had gentler drying to achieve less tension in the wood and therefore less cracking and warping. The problem of sticking was solved by modifying the stacking of the green sorting. Some of the poor recharging of the kilns was solved by a larger compressor to make the <b>pressure</b> <b>frames</b> move more accurate. The main conclusions are as follows; It was not worth the cost of an expensive drying process in relation to the economic benefit, they should continue with progressive kiln drying on wood that is to be split. Drying is very seasonal so in the dry season in March-June, dryer operator must be extra careful and plan the drying so that no timber may be left outdoors for long. The drying operator must get instructions about the saw planning in time so he knows which end products the sawn goods will be. Stacking and packing {{is an important part of}} the drying process and must be correct for good drying results and therefore, the staff must be careful with the maintenance and report errors immediately.

40|$|Purpose: Swimming goggles {{increase}} the intraocular pressure (IOP) via the periorbital <b>frame</b> <b>pressure</b> and suction effect. In comparison, diving masks {{have a larger}} frame rim and incorporate the nose. The exact effect(s) of diving masks on IOP is unknown. This study evaluates the influence of diving masks on IOP in normal, healthy subjects. Methods: Tonometry was performed in both eyes of all subjects with an AVIA®Tono-Pen by a single investigator. Measurements were taken at baseline without the diving mask and with the subjects wearing a small-volume, double-window diving mask, but with the mask lenses removed. Two IOP readings in each eye were measured, and an additional reading was measured if {{the difference between the}} initial 2 was ≥ 2 mm Hg. Central corneal thickness (CCT) was also measured in each eye, using a contact pachymeter (OcuScan®Alcon). Results: Forty eyes of 20 healthy volunteers (age 29. 7 ± 9. 3 years; range 21 – 52) were included. The mean CCT was 544. 4 ± 43. 5 µm. The mean IOP before the diving mask was worn had been 17. 23 ± 2. 18 mm Hg (n = 40). The IOP decreased by 0. 43 mm Hg (p &#x 3 c; 0. 05) to 16. 80 ± 2. 57 mm Hg after the diving mask had been put on. There was no correlation between IOP change and age (r = 0. 143, p = 0. 337), gender (r = – 0. 174, p = 0. 283) or CCT (r = – 0. 123, p = 0. 445). Conclusion: There was no increase in IOP after the diving mask had been worn. A small but statistically significant decrease in IOP was observed.

This article investigates a system {{innovation in the}} making that is driven by normative concerns, such as sustainability or animal welfare, initially formulated by outsiders like special-interest groups. Our central research question is: How, when and why is normative contestation of existing regimes effective in influencing the orientation of transitions in the making? The conceptual framework enriches innovation studies and the multi-level perspective with insights from social movement theory (SMT) and political science. SMT is {{used to analyze the}} build up of normative <b>pressure</b> (through <b>framing,</b> resource mobilization, and political opportunity structures). From political science we use the notion of multiple streams, in our analysis a problem, regulatory, market and technology stream. The research design consists of a comparative case study of pig husbandry systems. One case analyses the sub-sector of pregnant sows where normative pressures, after several decades, led to the changes advocated by the contestants. The second case concerns the sub-sector of pig fattening where normative pressure was less successful. The difference is partly explained by the normative pressure for pregnant sows being larger than for fattening pigs. The other part of the explanation is that in the first case normative pressure aligned better with the three other streams (regulatory, market and technology) to lead to the changes desired by the contestants. 2010 Elsevier B.

In the field conditions, where bentonite is subjected to coupled thermo-hydro-mechanical actions, its thermo-mechanical behavior may change with suction and stress variations. This work focuses on the compacted Gaomiaozi (GMZ) bentonite, which has been chosen as potential sealing/backfill material in the Chinese repository concept. The effects of vertical stress and suction on the volume change behaviour during thermal loading (heating) were experimentally investigated. A high <b>pressure</b> oedometer <b>frame</b> permitting simultaneous control of temperature, suction and pressure was used for testing. Compacted samples were heated from the original temperature of 20 to 80 °C at total suctions ranging from 4. 2 to 110 MPa, and vertical stress of 0. 1 or 5 MPa. Results show that heating at constant suction and vertical stress induces either swelling or contraction. At a constant vertical stress, samples with higher suctions swell during heating, and the lower the suction the lower the swelling strain; on the contrary heating resulted in a thermal contraction with lower suctions. At a constant higher suction (110 MPa), sample swells during heating; however, for a relative lower suction, a contraction was induced by heating for a higher vertical stress of 5 MPa. In short, at high pressure and low suction, heating tends to induce contraction, while at low pressure and high suction, heating induced expansion...|$|R

All elements of the design survived the test conditions in good condition. Window system for the shuttle orbiter vehicle...|$|R
40|$|Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains {{have spread}} in Saudi Arabia, {{increasing}} morbidity, mortality, and financial burdens. Recent {{studies have suggested}} the phenotyping methods typically used to classify MRSA as either health care MRSA (HA-MRSA) or community-associated MRSA (CA-MRSA) cases are unreliable, because they lack concordance {{with the results of}} genotyping. Yet the expense associated with genotyping precludes its use in the Saudi Aramco population in Saudi Arabia. The absence of a standardized and affordable method to classify MRSA into CA-MRSA and HA-MRSA has been a challenge for infection control programs in Saudi Arabia. The objective of this quantitative, secondary data analysis was to determine the most reliable phenotyping approach to strain identification using John Hopkins Aramco hospital data. The ecological and antibiotics selection <b>pressure</b> theories <b>framed</b> this research. The results of concordance, and sensitivity and specificity tests, suggested hospital admission profiles and susceptibility pattern were the most reliable phenotypic predictors of genotype-based classifications. Multiple logistic regression for susceptibility pattern (OR = 15. 47, p 3 ̆c. 001) and hospital admission profile (OR = 2. 87, p =. 008) confirmed those results, whereas all other variables were not found to be statistically significant. These results can be used to clarify the epidemiological and molecular factors that affect the transition of MRSA from health care facilities to the Saudi Aramco community. Implications for positive social change include faster and more reliable classification of MRSA to aid in disease surveillance and the selection of appropriate treatments to reduce MRSA-related morbidity and mortality...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Alternative {{splicing}} (AS) {{has been}} regarded capable of altering selection pressure on protein subsequences. Particularly, {{the frequency of}} reading frame preservation (FRFP), {{as a measure of}} selection pressure, has been reported to be higher in alternatively spliced exons (ASEs) than in constitutively spliced exons (CSEs). However, recently {{it has been reported that}} different ASE types – simple and complex ASEs – may be subject to opposite selection forces. Therefore, it is necessary to re-evaluate the evolutionary effects of such splicing patterns on frame preservation. Results Here we show that simple and complex ASEs, respectively, have higher and lower FRFPs than CSEs. Since complex ASEs may alter the ends of their flanking exons, the selection <b>pressure</b> on <b>frame</b> preservation is likely relaxed in this ASE type. Furthermore, conservation of the ASE/CSE splicing pattern increases the FRFPs of simple ASEs but decreases those of complex ASEs. Contrary to the well-recognized concept of strong selection pressure on conserved ASEs for protein reading frame preservation, our results show that conserved complex ASEs are relaxed from such pressure and the frame-disrupting effect caused by the insertion of complex ASEs can be offset by compensatory changes in their flanking exons. Conclusion In this study, we find that simple and complex ASEs undergo opposite selection pressure for protein reading frame preservation, with CSEs in-between. Simple ASEs have much higher FRFPs than complex ones. We further find that the FRFPs of complex ASEs coupled with flanking exons are close to those of simple ASEs, indicating that neighboring exons of an ASE may evolve in a coordinated way to avoid protein dysfunction. Therefore, we suggest that evolutionary analyses of AS should take into consideration the effects of different splicing patterns and the joint effects of multiple AS events. </p...|$|R
40|$|This article aims {{to develop}} a {{conceptual}} framework for the identification of dunes ecosystem services (ES), it´s main pressure sources, the beneficiaries of those services and management responses based {{on the use of}} a framework developed by the Integrated Coastal Management Laboratory of UFSC. It refers to a case study on three protected areas with dunes systems located on Santa Catarina Island, Brazil. The methodologies used were Ecosystem Based Management and Knowledge, developed by the Integrated Costal Management Lab/UFSC as a tool for services identification and classification, and Threats Classification Scheme, from the IUCN, for the identification and evaluation of dune system threats degrees. Santa Catarina Island has 18 environmental systems supplying around 50 environmental and social needs. For dunes systems, nine prevailing services were identified, classified as: habitat support; freshwater and mineral resources supply; aquifer regulation and recharge; sediment flow; erosion control; nutrients cycling and filtering; and cultural, related to the landscape. The main beneficiaries and the actors most affected by the use and diminishing offer and quality of those ES are local communities and the whole touristic sector. As for the threats upon the dunes, 18 pressure vectors were highlighted. The classified as “very high” were: subterranean water catchment and sewage discharge. Classified as “high” are touristic and recreational activities, housing and commercial infrastructure, and roads/pathways. n the face of these results, the challenge is to develop public policies to encourage knowledge gathering on the coastal zone ES as they are central to reaching an effective management of its natural resources. The use of EBM enables the identification of <b>pressure</b> vectors, <b>framing</b> a technical and scientific information base as a way to subsidize decision making and popular knowledge aimed at diminishing impacts on ecosystem services and processes while maintaining human wellbeing for present and future generations. ...|$|R
