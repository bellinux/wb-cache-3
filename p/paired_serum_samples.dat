50|$|An ELISA {{technique}} for CMV-specific IgM is available, but may give false-positive results unless steps {{are taken to}} remove rheumatoid factor {{or most of the}} IgG antibody before the serum sample is tested. Because CMV-specific IgM may be produced in low levels in reactivated CMV infection, its presence is not always indicative of primary infection. Only virus recovered from a target organ, such as the lung, provides unequivocal evidence that the current illness is caused by acquired CMV infection. If serologic tests detect a positive or high titer of IgG, this result should not automatically be interpreted to mean that active CMV infection is present. However, if antibody tests of <b>paired</b> <b>serum</b> <b>samples</b> show a fourfold rise in IgG antibody and a significant level of IgM antibody, meaning equal to at least 30% of the IgG value, or virus is cultured from a urine or throat specimen, the findings indicate that an active CMV infection is present.|$|E

40|$|SummaryMeasles among {{healthcare}} workers (HCWs) {{is associated}} with a significant risk of nosocomial transmission to susceptible patients. When a measles case occurs in the healthcare setting, most guidelines recommend exhaustive measures. To evaluate the effects of measures against measles transmission in the healthcare setting precisely, it is essential to determine whether secondary transmission generally occurs. This study describes, for the first time, the actual secondary transmission rate for a measles-infected HCW in a ward with no special air ventilation capacity. The routine treatment of a number of immunocompromised patients occurs in this ward, and thus patients as well as HCWs have a thorough understanding and practice of standard and extended precautions. Our <b>paired</b> <b>serum</b> <b>sample</b> study revealed that none {{of the people in the}} ward exposed to the HCW at the catarrhal stage over a period of 4 days exhibited elevated levels of antibodies against measles.

RESULTS Promoter CpG island methylation of MGMT, hMLH 1 and hMSH 2 was detected {{and the results were}} 46. 2 %, 10. 3 % and 20. 5 %, respectively in tumor DNA of the cases with gliomas, and 40. 6 %, 9. 4 % and 18. 8 %, respectively in serum DNA of the cases. The methylation pa Ĵ ern in primary tumor and serum was found to be concordant in matched tissue and <b>serum</b> <b>samples</b> of 21 patients. In the cases with positive result of methylation for MGMT, hMLH 1 and hMSH 2 in tumor tissues, the results of detection for those in the <b>paired</b> <b>serum</b> <b>sample</b> were 77. 8 % (7 / 9), 66. 7 % (2 / 3) and 75. 0 % (3 / 4), respectively.

Phylogenetic analysis of the partial ORF 2 region was used to genotype the strains detected. ResultsNoVs were detected in 34. 1 % (29 / 85) of stool samples. By qRT-PCR, we found a high rate of NoVs’ RNA in <b>serum</b> <b>samples</b> (34. 5 %) among NoVs-positive AGE cases, and was associated with a longer hospitalization (6. 5 vs. 4. 0 days; p= 0. 006), as well as with a higher stool viral load (3. 9 × 1011 vs. 1. 1 × 1011 GC/g; p= 0. 0472).

In this study was investigated the differences in dengue cases and viruses isolated in according with surveillance strategy. Study design and methods: Two surveillance strategies were analyzed in this study. First (Local Surveillance System) : single <b>serum</b> <b>sample</b> (acute or convalescent) was collected from 337 dengue suspected cases and then kept at 4 oC. IgM antibodies were detected using UMELISA DENGUE kit (IPK, Cuba), and serotypes identification was performed by viral isolation attempts in C 6 / 36. Second: <b>paired</b> <b>serum</b> <b>sample</b> were collected from 318 dengue suspected cases and then kept at - 70 ºC. IgM antibodies were detected using MAC-ELISA test and virus isolation as above. Some paired sera analyzed by MAC-ELISA were processed by “Dengue IgM-capture ELISA” kit (PANBIO) and “IgM*ELISA anti-dengue” (IPK, Cuba). Results: More IgM+ dengue cases were detected by the first than second strategy using acute or convalescent serum: 61. 1 vs 22 % (p< 0. 001) y 86. 8 vs 49. 3 % (p< 0. 001), respectively. Dengue diagnosis by MAC-ELISA was concordant in 85 % (K= 0. 29) respect to UM-ELISA, but 100 % (K= 1) and 90. 4 % (K= 0. 84) respect to “IgM ELISA anti-dengue” and “Dengue IgM-capture ELISA” kits. Differences in dengue cases detected by the second strategy were found when serological result with single acute or paired samples was compared: 70 (22 %) vs 155 (48. 7 %) (p< 0. 001). Dengue virus was isolated more frequently from sera kept at - 70 ºC than those kept at 4 ºC: 17. 8 % vs. 4. 7 % (p< 0. 001). All virus serotypes were isolated. The UMELISA DENGUE test specificity and relationship between impact dengue surveillance and implemented strategy are analyzed.

Detection of Taenia solium Antigens and Anti–T. solium Antibodies in <b>paired</b> <b>Serum</b> and Cerebrospinal Fluid Samples from Patients with Intraparenchymal or Extraparenchymal Neurocysticercosis. Journal of Infectious Diseases. [en línea]. may 2009, 199. p. 1345 - 1352. ISSN 0022 - 1899. Background. Neurocysticercosis (NCC) is a {{frequent}} cause of epilepsy worldwide. Compared with the more common parenchymal brain cysts, extraparenchymal infections are difﬁcult to manage and have a poor prognosis. Serological assays are used to detect circulating Taenia solium antigens or anti–T. solium antibodies in serum or cerebrospinal ﬂuid (CSF) samples. There are no guidelines on whether to use serumor CSF specimens for a particular assay. Methods. We obtained <b>paired</b> <b>serum</b> and CSF <b>samples</b> from 91 patients with NCC (48 had intraparenchymal NCC, and 43 had extraparenchymal NCC) for detection of antibodies, using an enzyme-linked immunotransfer blot (EITB) assay, and antigens, using a monoclonal antibody–based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Results. For the intraparenchymal NCC group, the EITB assay yielded more true-positive results for <b>serum</b> <b>samples,</b> and the ELISA yielded slightly more true-positive results for CSF <b>samples</b> than for <b>serum</b> <b>samples,</b> {{but none of these}} differences were statistically signiﬁcant.
