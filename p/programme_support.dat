[...] With the ISP available, mothers now give birth more frequently in the health clinic rather than at home without trained help. [...] The ISP has expanded three rural projects in neighboring villages to serve women who are generally underserved. [...] In order to reach these locations, the ISP received funds for a 4-wheel drive vehicle to transport field staff to remote locations.
