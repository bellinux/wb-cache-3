5|$|Henry {{was born}} in Silsbee, Texas. As a child, {{he was a big}} wrestling fan and André the Giant was his {{favorite}} wrestler. While attending a wrestling show in Beaumont, Texas, young Henry tried to touch André as he was walking down the aisle, but tripped over the barricade. André picked him up out of the crowd and <b>put</b> <b>him</b> <b>back</b> behind the barricade. When Henry was 12 years old, his father, Ernest, died of complications from diabetes. When he was 14 years old, Henry was diagnosed with dyslexia.|$|E
5|$|The {{predominant}} match {{from the}} SmackDown brand was a Championship Scramble for the WWE Championship, in which title holder Triple H faced Jeff Hardy, The Brian Kendrick, Shelton Benjamin, and Montel Vontavious Porter (MVP). The {{build up to}} the match began on the August 22 episode of SmackDown!, when General Manager Vickie Guerrero announced that SmackDown would have a Championship Scramble match and that the competitors would include WWE Champion Triple H and four men to be decided later in the night {{through a series of}} qualifying matches. The first qualifying match was a ten man battle royal, which saw The Big Show disrupt the match and throw all the competitors over the top rope. The Brian Kendrick, however, was saved by his bodyguard, Ezekiel Jackson, who caught Kendrick and <b>put</b> <b>him</b> <b>back</b> in the ring after the Big Show had eliminated all other competitors. Thus, Kendrick qualified for the Championship Scramble. The second qualifying match saw MVP defeat Festus by count out, qualifying for the match. The third qualifying match was Shelton Benjamin versus Finlay, which Benjamin won. The final qualifying match was Jeff Hardy versus The Great Khali, which Hardy won.|$|E
5|$|As the {{championship}} {{moved into the}} second half of the season, Fernando Alonso maintained a thirty-four-point lead over his nearest rival, Mark Webber, with Sebastian Vettel a further ten points behind. Alonso's outlook for the race was dour, qualifying sixth and pinning his hopes on a wet race as Lewis Hamilton continued McLaren's mid-season resurgence, returning to pole position for the first time since the Malaysian Grand Prix. Following an aborted start triggered by Michael Schumacher lining up in the wrong grid position and then shutting his engine off in the confusion, Hamilton and Grosjean lead the field away. After prematurely moving Jenson Button onto a three-stop strategy, McLaren gave Hamilton the order to hold position as the tight confines of the Hungaroring circuit forced the teams to try to make up positions in the pits. This was evidenced by Kimi Räikkönen, who inherited the lead after the first set of stops and produced a series of fast laps that allowed him to rejoin in second, coming dangerously close to team-mate Grosjean under brakes as he emerged from the pit lane. Despite taking two seconds out of Hamilton's lead within five laps of rejoining the race, Räikkönen was powerless to reel Hamilton in any further. Hamilton won the race, the nineteenth of his career, with Räikkönen second and Grosjean in third. Hamilton's victory brought with it twenty-five points that <b>put</b> <b>him</b> <b>back</b> in championship contention, while a late decision by Red Bull to move Mark Webber onto a three-stop strategy saw the Australian slip further behind Fernando Alonso, as the Spaniard extended his championship lead to forty points.|$|E
25|$|Shafik {{was first}} disqualified {{in the wake}} of the {{ratification}} of the Corruption of Political Life Law (aka the Disenfranchisement Law), which banned Mubarak-era PMs from nomination. He immediately appealed the decision and on 25 April the Supreme Presidential Electoral Commission (SPEC) accepted his appeal, which <b>puts</b> <b>him</b> <b>back</b> in the race.|$|R
50|$|At the 2007 Canadian Grand Prix Davidson {{was running}} third when his car struck a {{groundhog}} on the straight before the pits, ultimately <b>putting</b> <b>him</b> <b>back</b> to 11th place and ending {{his bid for}} his first career points. At the Hungarian Grand Prix Davidson's rear suspension was broken during a collision with Giancarlo Fisichella, which forced him to retire. Davidson finished the season in 23rd place having scored no points.|$|R
50|$|After {{his release}} from the WEC, Davis {{returned}} home to Kansas City {{to work on his}} training where he eventually decided to drop down to the bantamweight division. Davis made his bantamweight debut on May 25, 2012 at Titan Fighting Championships 22 against Bill Kamery. Davis defeated Kamery in the second round via TKO <b>putting</b> <b>him</b> <b>back</b> in the win column for first time in over two years.|$|R
25|$|In {{the twelfth}} stage, all the favourites {{finished}} together. That stage was won by Belgian Maurice Blomme, {{but not without}} difficulties: he was so exhausted that he mistook a dark shadow for the finish line, and stopped racing. The secretary of the Tour de France, Jean Garnault, had to <b>put</b> <b>him</b> <b>back</b> on his bicycle so he would ride the last meters of the stage.|$|E
25|$|McCoy {{considered}} Blob's mutation useless which enraged Blob. Dukes freed himself, {{and attacked}} his experimenter. Havok came to McCoy's rescue, but Dukes {{proved to be}} even {{too much for the}} Prelate to handle. His pseudo freedom was fleeting for moments later the head of the pens, Havok's older brother Cyclops, showed up to deliver a searing optic blast that would <b>put</b> <b>him</b> <b>back</b> in his place.|$|E
25|$|According to Eliade, one of {{the most}} common shamanistic themes is the shaman's {{supposed}} death and resurrection. This occurs in particular during his initiation. Often, the procedure is supposed to be performed by spirits who dismember the shaman and strip the flesh from his bones, then <b>put</b> <b>him</b> <b>back</b> together and revive him. In more than one way, this death and resurrection represents the shaman's elevation above human nature.|$|E
50|$|In 1891, Archbishop Herrera was {{appointed}} Archbishop of Bogotá, <b>putting</b> <b>him</b> <b>back</b> {{into contact with}} the seminary. He gave the seminary new statutes, and wished to construct it a new building. Construction began on the building, located on 11th Street in Bogotá, and the seminary moved its facilities there, but the building was never fully completed. In 1917, upon the publication of the new Code of Canon Law, the seminary's statutes were updated to keep in accordance.|$|R

After helping the woman to give birth, ALF pretends to be a toy and Mr. Foley <b>puts</b> <b>him</b> <b>back</b> in the trunk and they drive away. When Mr. Foley is about to jump off a bridge, ALF disguises himself as Santa and convinces Mr. Foley to drive back to the cabin, where ALF is reunited with the Tanners.|$|R
5000|$|Aella {{orders the}} Viking leader bound and {{thrown into a}} pit filled with starved wolves. To give Ragnar a Viking's death (so that he can enter Valhalla), Eric, who is granted the honour of forcing him into the pit, cuts the prisoner's bonds and gives him his sword. Laughing, Ragnar jumps to his death. In {{response}} to Eric's [...] "treason", Aella cuts off his left hand, <b>puts</b> <b>him</b> <b>back</b> on his ship and casts him adrift.|$|R
25|$|Behind {{the leaders}} was Subaru driver Petter Solberg. The new Subaru was more disappointing than on {{its debut in}} Greece with Petter Solberg nearly 50 seconds off the pace. Matthew Wilson was in seventh spot, just over a minute behind despite {{suffering}} with a cold. In the final points paying position was Dani Sordo. Sordo was running in fifth until suspension damage on stage 7 <b>put</b> <b>him</b> <b>back</b> into 8th place.|$|E
25|$|Travelling with twelve other monks, Hakuin {{made his}} way to Zuiun-ji, the {{residence}} of Baō Rōjin, a respected scholar but also a tough-minded teacher. While studying with the poet-monk Bao, he had an experience that <b>put</b> <b>him</b> <b>back</b> along the path of monasticism. He saw a number of books piled out in the temple courtyard, books from every school of Buddhism. Struck by the sight of all these volumes of literature, Hakuin prayed to the gods of the Dharma to help him choose a path. He then reached out and took a book; it was a collection of Zen stories from the Ming Dynasty. Inspired by this, he repented and dedicated himself to the practice of Zen.|$|E
25|$|Again, the Oklahoma {{freshman}} {{stole the}} show. Quarterback Sam Bradford finished the game connecting 21 of his 26 passes for 353yards and three touchdowns. The performance <b>put</b> <b>him</b> <b>back</b> atop the passing efficiency standings {{where he spent}} most of the early season. His passing efficiency for the season through Baylor was 180.4, ahead of Florida's Tim Tebow at 177.1. DeMarco Murray scored four touchdowns and averaged over seven yards on his 13rushing attempts. Murray was also named the Big 12 Special Teams Player of the Week for his accomplishments. However, the Baylor offense also performed better than expected. The Sooners' ninth-ranked defense allowed Baylor to gain 450yards of total offense. Baylor running back Brandon Whitaker (from Edmond, Oklahoma) had 15carries for 149yards and 10catches for 68yards.|$|E
50|$|He {{was a world}} {{championship}} Candidate twice, losing out to Andrei Sokolov in 1986 and to Lajos Portisch in 1988. It is estimated that he has won in excess of thirty tournaments in all, and as recently as 2004, tied for {{first place in the}} Moscow's Aeroflot Open with Sergei Rublevsky and Valerij Filippov. In January 2005, his Elo rating briefly reached a 21st-century high at 2670, <b>putting</b> <b>him</b> <b>back</b> into the world's top 50, despite being in his mid-fifties.|$|R
50|$|Krazy's {{train is}} so full that its cars bulge {{almost to the}} point of bursting. Nevertheless, it remains in one piece. And {{although}} he manages to get a ride, Krazy has to avoid getting smushed by the passengers. When the train reaches its destination, the passengers come out flat, and a station employee has to inflate them with a pump. Krazy is in a worse situation as he is in pieces similar to a jigsaw puzzle. Fortunately, the station employee <b>puts</b> <b>him</b> <b>back</b> together on time.|$|R
5000|$|Death tells Furrows {{that he has}} met his {{quota of}} saying [...] "I wish I were dead" [...] and must die, and Furrows {{complains}} about the stupidity of the rule until Death, unable to scare Furrows into line, <b>puts</b> <b>him</b> <b>back</b> into his body. Furrows awakes with frightened Al standing over him, trying to wake him. The story ends with the two going out to a restaurant, though Furrows' insistence that they serve him cereal suggesting {{the lessons of the}} past day were lost on him.|$|R
25|$|Woods {{returned}} to competitive golf four weeks later {{to defend his}} title at The Memorial Tournament. He made the cut {{and went on to}} finish T19, his worst finish in that tournament since 2002. His next competitive tournament began June 17 at the U.S. Open held at Pebble Beach, the site of his 2000 win by a record 15 shots. After a relatively unspectacular performance through the first two rounds, Woods showed signs of his pre-2010 form, as he managed a back nine 31 en route to shooting a five-under-par 66 on Saturday, which would tie for the low round of the tournament and <b>put</b> <b>him</b> <b>back</b> into contention. However, he was unable to mount a charge on Sunday, despite the collapse of 54-hole leader Dustin Johnson, and went on to finish the tournament at three-over-par and in a tie for fourth place, repeating his top-5 result at the 2010 Masters Tournament.|$|E
25|$|Su Shi {{and friends}} {{continued}} to write poetry, despite (or perhaps encouraged by) their frequent banishment. Su Shi collected {{some of his}} extent works from friends, having ensured that any offending lines had been removed (Murck, 50). Some of his poetry began {{more and more to}} use such a deep and subtle allusive process that {{it would be difficult for}} those outside his group to grasp the real meaning, let alone <b>put</b> <b>him</b> <b>back</b> on trial. One of these techniques was to use rhymes from other poems; thus, alluding to lines from that poem, and also alluding to other poems which Su Shi and his friends circulated which also matched these rhymes. Subtle complexities of profound political dissent could then be masked under cover of seemingly innocuous lines about nature scenes in the Xiaoxiang region: indeed a set of 8 conventional scenes evolved (Murck, passim). These are known as the Eight Views of Xiaoxiang.|$|E
25|$|During the {{continued}} investigation in Tashkent, {{the three were}} put under surveillance {{in one of the}} rooms for as long as four weeks where they were investigated for the reliability of their claims by the KGB. Soon after, they were satisfied with the results and sent them to Bulgaria for a secret retreat. On 9 October, the Soviet secret service had a meeting in which Bogdanov, Gorelov, Pavlonsky and Puzanov were the main chiefs who were discussing what to do with Amin who was very harsh at the meeting. After the two-hour meeting they began to worry that Amin will establish an Islamic Republic in Afghanistan and decided to seek a way to put Karmal back in. They brought him and three other ministers secretly to Moscow during which time they discussed how to <b>put</b> <b>him</b> <b>back</b> in power. The decision was to fly him back to Bagram airbase by 13 December. Four days later, Amin's nephew, Asadullah, was taken to Moscow by the KGB for acute food poisoning treatment.|$|E

25|$|On October 1, 1973 Austin won {{his first}} singles title when he became the NWA Mississippi Heavyweight Champion, {{something}} which helped cement Austin Novell {{as one of the}} pioneers in breaking down the racial barriers in the south. In 1975 Austin teamed up with Rocket Monroe (Sputnik's storyline brother) to briefly hold the Gulf Coast Championship Wrestling version of the NWA United States tag team titles. After working together for three years which saw the team even tour Japan Norvell Austin decided {{that it was time to}} work as a singles wrestler ending his association with Sputnik Monroe. From 1975 Austin kept working for NWA Mid-America both the southern part of the territory that was promoted by Nick Gulas and the northern part promoted by Jerry Jarrett that would later split off and become Continental Wrestling Association (CWA). Despite wanting to wrestling more as a singles wrestler Austin was usually booked in the tag team division, teaming with for instance Butch Malone to win the NWA Tennessee Tag Team Championship. After the title loss Austin was given an opportunity to feud with his former partner Butch Malone for a brief period of time. The feud with Malone did not convince the bookers to give Austin more of a singles push but instead <b>put</b> <b>him</b> <b>back</b> in the tag team division with a variety of partners such as Bill Dundee, Pat Barrett and Jimmy Golden all of whom he held tag team championships in NWA Mid-America or Gulf Coast Championship Wrestling (renamed Southeast Championship Wrestling (SECW) in 1978).|$|E

Second-placed Vettel praised the track and his team's effort in preparing the car after difficulties in Friday's free practice. Sergio Pérez emphasised his recovery after his gearbox penalty, which <b>put</b> <b>him</b> <b>back</b> five places on the starting grid and the satisfaction of overtaking Räikkönen on the last lap of the race. During the following press conference, Vettel expressed surprise at the fact that no safety car period had emerged {{over the course of the}} race.|$|E

[...] Joyce himself revealed that the book [...] "ends {{in the middle of}} a sentence and begins in the middle of the same sentence." [...] The introductory chapter (I.1) establishes the book's setting as [...] "Howth Castle and Environs" [...] (i.e. the Dublin area), and introduces Dublin hod carrier [...] "Finnegan", who falls to his death from a ladder while constructing a wall. Finnegan's wife Annie puts out his corpse as a meal spread for the mourners at his wake, but he vanishes before they can eat him. A series of episodic vignettes follows, loosely related to the dead Finnegan, most commonly referred to as [...] "The Willingdone Museyroom", [...] "Mutt and Jute", and [...] "The Prankquean". At the chapter's close a fight breaks out, whiskey splashes on Finnegan's corpse, and [...] "the dead Finnegan rises from his coffin bawling for whiskey and his mourners <b>put</b> <b>him</b> <b>back</b> to rest”, persuading him that he is better off where he is. The chapter ends with the image of the HCE character sailing into Dublin Bay to take a central role in the story.|$|E
